[37:04] the spirit reap life
[37:07] Everlasting let us not be weary and
[37:09] well-doing for in due season we shall
[37:12] reap if we faint not amen and as we have
[37:16] therefore opportunity let us do good
[37:19] unto all men especially unto them who
[37:22] are of the household of faith amen far
[37:26] ahead for a word of prayer dear Lord
[37:29] Jesus Heavenly Father we just ask that
[37:33] Lord you'll just come and break the
[37:35] bread of life with us Lord that you'll
[37:38] cleanse our hearts of our sins and our
[37:40] unbelief Lord and our iniquities that
[37:42] you'll just wash us in your blood and
[37:45] Lord that you'll just come and father
[37:47] that you'll just speak to us that you'll
[37:49] just give us encouraging words in this
[37:52] hour Lord we love you we thank you Lord
[37:55] we commit everything in your hands for
[37:56] your honor and your glory in Jesus
[37:59] Christ's name we ask it amen amen you
[38:02] may be
[38:03] seated praise the Lord
[38:06] amen so I'd like
[38:10] to talk to you for a little
[38:13] while I
[38:16] guess and I like to talk to you about in
[38:19] his time
[38:23] amen uh the other day I was I got
[38:27] listening to a series of messages that
[38:29] brother brandham preached back in
[38:31] January of
[38:34] 1955 and I found them pretty outstanding
[38:38] so I want to read some of the quotes out
[38:39] of there but we noticed that in the
[38:42] opening scripture it said that for
[38:44] everything there is a
[38:47] season and for everything there is a
[38:49] Time Amen brother brandom said so the
[38:53] main thing is if we can find where God's
[38:56] word belongs in our life God sets times
[39:00] and time limits and then it works all to
[39:03] that
[39:04] time many of them before the coming of
[39:07] the Lord Jesus there was many false
[39:09] things raised up and said this is the
[39:12] Messiah and this is and there was many
[39:14] false things taking place according to
[39:16] the scriptures just before the coming of
[39:18] the Lord Jesus so we know we're we're in
[39:21] the season we're in the time you know
[39:24] we've gotten now to
[39:27] 2024 which is quite amazing I
[39:31] mean it's really quite
[39:34] amazing when
[39:37] I
[39:38] I found the Lord because he always knew
[39:42] where I was I just didn't know where he
[39:44] was but when I found the Lord in 76 I
[39:47] thought oh my he's coming
[39:49] tomorrow and there was many things that
[39:53] uh Donna and I we we were living
[39:55] together we had to get things
[39:57] straightened up because God was coming
[40:00] and so you know we straightened up we
[40:02] got married and then and then we got
[40:04] baptized right away and then I said well
[40:06] I want the Holy Ghost right now and I
[40:08] mean that's a good thing to
[40:10] want but God has a time in a season for
[40:13] that and so there was things that had to
[40:16] be straightened up and things you know
[40:18] you have to learn how to repent and then
[40:20] you have to learn how to get a hold of
[40:21] God and then God finally comes you know
[40:24] his promises yay and amen he's not going
[40:27] to fail he's going to give the Holy
[40:30] Ghost to them who seek after him amen so
[40:33] brother brandham here you'll notice that
[40:35] in the scriptures that we read we said
[40:38] there Solomon was writing the Book of
[40:41] Ecclesiastes he said there is a season
[40:44] and a time for
[40:46] everything and of course we thought that
[40:49] God was you know that the holy ghost
[40:51] that that Jesus was coming back right
[40:54] then and and we made prepar preparations
[40:56] for that but I want you to notice that
[40:59] brother brandham says the main thing the
[41:02] very first thing you got to do is you've
[41:04] got to find out where God's word belongs
[41:07] in your
[41:08] life that's the very first lesson that a
[41:12] Christian needs to learn is that God is
[41:15] in control of all of this and that God's
[41:19] word is the guidepost it's the compass
[41:23] that you need if you're going to succeed
[41:25] in this hour amen because this is a
[41:28] perilous time but it's also a glorious
[41:32] time amen so sometimes we have to be
[41:36] reminded of these
[41:37] things so brother brandom notice here in
[41:41] this in this quote he says God sets
[41:44] times and time limits and then he works
[41:47] all of that according to his
[41:50] time and right
[41:52] away he goes back and says when Jesus
[41:56] came came the first time there was all
[41:58] kinds of false things that rose
[42:02] up he talks about the time of Jesus
[42:05] coming now and right away puts a warning
[42:09] in there that there's all kinds of
[42:11] Trials and troubles and things false
[42:13] things it'll raise up and you say
[42:16] they'll call it this is the Messiah and
[42:18] this is that and many false things taken
[42:20] place according to the scriptures just
[42:22] before the coming of the Lord Jesus and
[42:25] people try to do it within themselves
[42:28] they try to make God's word fit in their
[42:31] program but you got it vice versa you've
[42:33] got to fit in God's program and that's
[42:36] what we find out that that's true amen
[42:40] amen so we get down now you know we're
[42:43] in 2024 now and we've seen a lot of
[42:47] things we thought you know in 2000 we
[42:50] thought well God's coming we thought in
[42:53] well I thought in 1980 God was coming
[42:56] because they had all the planets lining
[42:58] up on one side of the Earth and the
[42:59] Earth was going to completely explode
[43:02] but it didn't happen and then we thought
[43:05] other times that God was coming we
[43:08] thought you know you you think oh but
[43:11] see God has a time and God has a
[43:16] season and when things don't just work
[43:19] out the way you think they should work
[43:21] out then you need to make sure that you
[43:25] can find where the word of God is
[43:28] settled in your
[43:30] life because that is the Tie
[43:34] poost
[43:35] amen and Christ is identified the same
[43:38] in all generations this 1964 brother
[43:41] brandom says many times we get nervous
[43:43] and we begin to think well it ought to
[43:45] be this way and we've got to make it
[43:47] this way or make it that way or we we we
[43:50] he says we don't have anything to do
[43:52] with it just play out your part that he
[43:55] leads us to play amen and remember
[43:57] there's nothing out of cater the great
[44:00] omnipotent God knows just exactly before
[44:04] the foundation of the world that we
[44:06] would sit here
[44:08] tonight and people don't really think
[44:11] about that see but if the word of God is
[44:14] something that you meditate on day and
[44:16] night or at least think about it at
[44:18] least once a
[44:20] day that God knows
[44:24] everything and because of for knowledge
[44:27] he can
[44:29] predestinate and he already knows
[44:32] exactly what's going to happen tomorrow
[44:35] he knows everything
[44:38] amen and we think well it ought to be
[44:40] like this or we ought to make it this
[44:42] way or we ought to do that way he says
[44:44] you don't have anything to do with it
[44:46] you know Jesus the disciples they all
[44:49] they were all upset and nervous and
[44:50] everything else said which one of you by
[44:52] taking thought can make yourself taller
[44:56] right which one of you by taking thought
[44:59] can make yourself
[45:01] thinner heal
[45:03] yourself you know when you're sick you
[45:05] go oh I know God's A Healer and you go
[45:07] in to pray and you pray and you pray and
[45:09] you pray and and and then the doubts all
[45:13] come so you have to know that the word
[45:17] of God is true regardless of the outcome
[45:20] regardless of what happens you've got to
[45:23] know that the word of God is true amen
[45:26] amen the great omnipotent God knows just
[45:29] exactly before the foundation of the
[45:31] world that we would sit here tonight if
[45:34] he's infinite he has to know that so he
[45:37] can't be infinite without knowing all
[45:39] things and by his foreign knowledge he
[45:41] knew that this meeting would be here and
[45:43] perhaps ordained of him I trust that it
[45:46] is to bring some more into the kingdom
[45:49] amen so I want to go over here to 2
[45:53] Thessalonians and there's just a couple
[45:55] of scriptures that I really want to zero
[45:57] in but as I was looking at it I thought
[45:59] wow you're really not going to see this
[46:01] unless we read the the whole first
[46:04] chapter so this is 2 Thessalonians
[46:07] chapter 1 starting at verse one it says
[46:10] Paul and salanus and timotheus under the
[46:14] Church of the Thessalonians in God our
[46:16] Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace
[46:19] unto you and peace I like
[46:24] that let's relax
[46:28] I know it's tax time but let's just
[46:31] relax from God our Father and the Lord
[46:34] Jesus Christ we are bound to thank God
[46:38] always for you Brethren as it is meat
[46:41] because that your faith groweth
[46:44] exceedingly you know if your faith is
[46:46] growing at all it's a great
[46:51] thing Faith growing is something that
[46:53] you don't really know about
[46:57] you really don't know I mean Faith just
[46:59] happens and then one day you're you're
[47:02] in you know Faith can't even be proven
[47:05] without a trial that's right you can say
[47:09] well I have all kinds of Faith but
[47:11] unless you have it tried you just have a
[47:13] bunch of
[47:15] words but Paul writing to the
[47:17] Thessalonians he said he already he said
[47:20] your faith is
[47:22] growing and the charity of every one of
[47:25] you all toward each other aboundeth
[47:27] isn't that
[47:29] wonderful amen so that we ourselves
[47:33] glory in you in the Churches of God for
[47:35] your patience and faith and all of your
[47:38] persecutions and tribulations that you
[47:40] endure amen
[47:43] amen now if you were to ask
[47:47] me people aren't throwing Tomatoes at my
[47:51] house when I go out and I go to the
[47:54] supermarket I'm not getting followed
[47:56] around with a bunch of people with
[47:57] pitchforks trying to kill
[47:59] me so I don't understand about
[48:02] persecutions and tribulations like Paul
[48:04] was talking to the Thessalonian
[48:07] church we live in a different age in a
[48:11] different
[48:13] time God has a season for everything
[48:19] okay he says here he
[48:22] says which is a manifest token
[48:26] of the righteous Judgment of God that
[48:29] you may be counted worthy of the kingdom
[48:31] of God for which you also suffer amen so
[48:35] whenever there's anything that pressure
[48:38] comes in your life it is an it's a
[48:41] manifest token of God's love that you're
[48:44] in the Kingdom it's not that he cursed
[48:47] you he's blessing you he's trying to
[48:50] show you that you are everything's going
[48:54] to be all right if if you trust in the
[48:56] Lord with all your might he will direct
[48:58] your path if you trust in the Lord in
[49:01] your darkest hour he will take care of
[49:04] it he will take care of it and it's a
[49:07] manifest token
[49:10] amen verse six says seeing it is a
[49:13] righteous thing with God to recompense
[49:16] tribulations to them that trouble you oh
[49:19] that's that's a comforting
[49:20] thought but I might thinking I'd like to
[49:23] have that happen now man maybe I don't
[49:26] like my boss maybe I don't like the guy
[49:28] that's working next to me maybe I don't
[49:30] like my neighbor and I'd love God to
[49:34] recompense because the scripture says so
[49:37] but you didn't read all the scriptures
[49:39] because I want you to that's why I said
[49:41] I get you got to read all of this to get
[49:42] to where I want to go seeing it is a
[49:45] righteous thing with God to recompense
[49:48] tribulation to them that trouble you and
[49:50] to you who are troubled
[49:54] rest
[49:57] rest
[50:00] rest when the Lord Jesus shall be
[50:02] revealed from heaven with his mighty
[50:04] Angels you have to be patient and look
[50:07] at how he's he Paul when he's writing
[50:10] this he tells
[50:11] them this is when he's going to
[50:15] recompense is when he comes back when
[50:18] he's revealed from heaven with Mighty
[50:20] Angels INF flaming fire taking Vengeance
[50:23] on them that know not God and that obey
[50:26] not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:28] who shall be punished with Everlasting
[50:30] destruction from the presence of the
[50:32] Lord and from the glory of his power
[50:35] that is not in this lifetime
[50:39] friends that's at his
[50:42] coming so you may have an awful boss you
[50:45] may have an awful boss for a year you
[50:47] may have an awful boss for a couple
[50:49] years you have a may have a neighbor
[50:52] that every time that you go out in your
[50:54] yard he spits on you
[50:56] you but God is Not giv you a
[51:02] promise what did Paul say as we have
[51:06] therefore
[51:07] opportunity let us do good unto all
[51:13] men and then especially unto the house
[51:17] of household of
[51:19] faith we need to live peaceably
[51:24] amen
[51:26] because verse 10 says why why was Paul
[51:29] saying this he says when he shall come
[51:32] to be glorified in his Saints and to be
[51:36] admired in all them that believe because
[51:39] our testimony among you was believed in
[51:41] that day God has one purpose for giving
[51:45] you the Holy
[51:46] Ghost you might think it's for raising
[51:49] the dead and for you answering your
[51:50] prayers and Healing The Sick and
[51:53] everything else but God's got one
[51:55] purpose purpose I got a quote the other
[51:57] day and I was reading it and then I got
[52:00] to thinking about it brother Brandon
[52:01] made this statement he said he said
[52:04] Jesus would not let the disciples go out
[52:08] and preach until they were endured with
[52:11] and power from on high on the day of
[52:14] Pentecost well I went back and I
[52:18] looked and Jesus when he called the 12
[52:21] disciples he gave them power over all
[52:23] kinds of devils and demons
[52:26] and he told them
[52:29] preach and I went wait a
[52:33] minute he told them to preach he told
[52:37] them to go out and say that the kingdom
[52:38] of heaven was at hand amen and they went
[52:41] and did all those things so much so that
[52:44] they came back
[52:46] rejoicing but yet there was something
[52:49] that they did not have that Pentecost
[52:52] required amen so so you thinking that
[52:56] wow if I could get the Holy Ghost then I
[52:58] could have all the signs of Mark 16 well
[53:01] that would be wonderful because I'd like
[53:03] to have all the signs of Mark 16 that
[53:06] would be great but Paul said the greater
[53:09] thing what he was telling the the
[53:11] Thessalonian Church the greater thing is
[53:14] that the word The Life of Christ the
[53:18] character of Christ would be magnified
[53:21] in you amen amen because the disciples
[53:26] were still the
[53:28] disciples Peter even though he had all
[53:31] those signs and all those things he
[53:32] could do he still didn't have control
[53:35] over his temper he still didn't have the
[53:38] the goods on the inside that could keep
[53:41] him from shooting his mouth
[53:43] off right but after Pentecost his whole
[53:48] he became
[53:50] Fearless you see Paul rending to the
[53:53] Thessalonians he says wherefore also we
[53:56] pray see we pray always for you that our
[54:00] God would count you worthy of this
[54:03] calling what calling not just the
[54:07] calling of having gifts and the
[54:09] supernatural in your life but that you
[54:11] can live the life of Christ what Jesus
[54:16] Jesus was a little bit
[54:19] disappointed when he walked on the earth
[54:21] as a man he was only
[54:24] one he could only go so far he could
[54:28] only do so much but on the day of
[54:31] Pentecost there was 5,000 jesuses
[54:34] now there was 5,000 Jesus and they could
[54:38] go places and when the persecution came
[54:41] in the in the book of Acts the fire was
[54:45] in them and the Flames got really
[54:48] brushed and Scattered them all around
[54:52] and what were they doing the Jesus that
[54:54] they were trying to to get rid of they
[54:56] were just scattering in other
[54:58] places and everyone that got filled with
[55:01] the Holy Ghost wasn't just so much to do
[55:04] Miracles and sign and wonders but to
[55:06] live like Jesus Christ
[55:11] amen in different places all around the
[55:14] world
[55:17] Amen praise the Lord count you worthy of
[55:20] this calling and fulfill all the good
[55:23] pleasure of his good
[55:25] and the work of Faith with power that
[55:29] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ might
[55:31] be glorified in you and you in
[55:35] him according to the grace of our God
[55:39] and the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[55:43] praise the Lord so now we're in 2024 I
[55:46] mean sorry we're here we'd like to see
[55:49] God come we'd like to see Jesus Christ
[55:53] come we'd like to we'd like to see the
[55:56] resurrection we would like to see a lot
[55:58] of things but God has set a time and a
[56:02] season as a place and now we have to
[56:05] learn to be
[56:06] mature we have to be mature enough to
[56:10] wait for his time his season his
[56:14] place
[56:16] amen amen praise the
[56:20] Lord God's got a time for all things
[56:24] he's got a time now we plant corn we got
[56:27] a time that we plow corn right now the
[56:30] weather's a little bit screwed up this
[56:32] is still February don't go out and plant
[56:35] your garden you're going to be in
[56:37] trouble snow's coming
[56:39] back we plant corn we got a time that we
[56:42] plow corn then at the time we harvest
[56:45] corn the spring rains come the draw it
[56:47] through the summer the rain falls the
[56:49] Snows you just can't say I plant my
[56:51] wheat today and tomorrow and I go out
[56:53] and harvest it God has times for Seasons
[56:56] he has seasons for his word he has times
[57:00] when the scripture here he said and the
[57:02] presence of the Lord was there to heal
[57:04] the sick that's when Jesus was
[57:06] ministering too at the presence of the
[57:09] Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at
[57:11] other times the presence of the Lord
[57:13] wasn't there to heal the
[57:15] sick we find out that God works
[57:18] everything seasonally
[57:21] amen so brother Brenham goes on he says
[57:24] so now we see as Full Gospel people I
[57:27] think we've made many mistakes looking
[57:29] into the word and saying God said this
[57:32] and I'm guilty just as anybody else I
[57:35] look in the Bible and I go but the word
[57:37] says
[57:39] this well you can't make the situation
[57:43] match the
[57:44] word you have to let the word right you
[57:50] have to let the word of God Be Your
[57:52] guide you're going to you you'll see
[57:56] he says so brother random said he said
[57:58] so I think I think we many times make
[58:01] the mistake by looking into the word and
[58:03] say God said this and we failed to find
[58:06] the direct revelation of our life to fit
[58:10] in that
[58:12] program so the first thing we have to
[58:15] find the word and get it in the right
[58:19] place in our life then we have to start
[58:22] following it and as we start following
[58:25] it then we have to have God reveal to us
[58:29] what the purpose he has for us and for
[58:33] our family and for where we live and for
[58:36] where we work and for everything that we
[58:38] do God has a purpose God has a plan amen
[58:44] amen so now you're happy right veryy
[58:48] amen okay so we take a couple examples
[58:53] um we we going to talk about Noah so the
[58:56] time came when time for God to destroy
[58:58] the world with water right now we are in
[59:01] the the preus we want to see the world
[59:05] we know that this is the hour when God's
[59:07] going
[59:07] to destroy the world by fire right we
[59:11] know that we know we're in the time the
[59:14] season of the rapture we know that we
[59:16] know we are in the season of the body
[59:18] change we know that but now we got to
[59:21] wait for God's time we're not going to
[59:24] be able to fast our way into it we're
[59:27] not going to be able to pray our way
[59:28] into it the other night we were watching
[59:30] the news and uh this big time preacher
[59:34] over in Africa they just arrested him
[59:37] because he had a compound and he was he
[59:39] had a lot of followers a lot of
[59:41] Believers and they were coming and they
[59:44] found out that these people got in this

[1:01:33] live
[1:01:35] right and I went out I I I met Donna and
[1:01:39] and then I wasn't I wasn't think I
[1:01:42] wasn't even thinking about
[1:01:44] God and the first job I got I I got
[1:01:48] introduced to the religious nut of the
[1:01:51] company they said watch out for this guy
[1:01:53] he's a nut and I I says
[1:01:55] okay the very first launch we sat down
[1:01:59] and we started talking and he said do
[1:02:01] you know well there's other parts of my
[1:02:04] testimony but I'm not going to go into
[1:02:05] it but he started asking me he says do
[1:02:07] you know that God was going to send us a
[1:02:09] prophet in the last days and I said yes
[1:02:12] I
[1:02:13] did and I knew because I had memorized
[1:02:16] Malachi 4 when I was in uh fifth grade W
[1:02:21] in the Presbyterian
[1:02:22] Church wow
[1:02:24] yeah that's a wow to
[1:02:26] me that's a big
[1:02:30] deal then God because I
[1:02:34] found him because I found the pearl of
[1:02:37] great price because I put the word in
[1:02:39] the center of my life amen a guy with no
[1:02:44] degrees no education ended up becoming
[1:02:47] an IT manager how's that even possible
[1:02:50] found favor with people around me found
[1:02:55] God did everything and now I'm retired
[1:02:58] and I don't even know how it
[1:02:59] [Laughter]
[1:03:01] happened I don't even know how I mean
[1:03:03] the Lord has taking care of us we have
[1:03:05] plenty of food we have money we have we
[1:03:08] have a house it's paid for we have all
[1:03:09] these things because we found the word
[1:03:13] and then we put the word first and then
[1:03:16] whatever took place we always looked in
[1:03:18] the word and say okay what do we do now
[1:03:21] and we followed the Lord amen amen you
[1:03:25] forgot what the name of the subject is
[1:03:27] in his time amen so there came a time
[1:03:30] for God to destroy the world with water
[1:03:34] and he sent a man by the name of Noah
[1:03:36] and God got the world ready for judgment
[1:03:38] and he taken the time came for Noah to
[1:03:41] go into the ark so let's look at Genesis
[1:03:48] 6 praise the Lord amen amen you say oh
[1:03:52] but Brother Bruce we already know these
[1:03:54] stories no open up your Bible go to
[1:03:58] Genesis 6 and then underline it amen so
[1:04:02] that when you forgot about me you can
[1:04:05] open up the Bible one day and go oh I
[1:04:08] got this
[1:04:09] highlighted verse five says and God saw
[1:04:13] that the wickedness of man was great on
[1:04:15] the earth and that every imagination of
[1:04:17] the thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:04:19] continually and it repented the Lord
[1:04:21] that he had made man on the Earth and
[1:04:24] grieved him at his heart and the Lord
[1:04:26] said I will destroy man who I have
[1:04:28] created from the face of the Earth both
[1:04:30] man and Beast and the creeping thing and
[1:04:32] the fowls of the air for it repenteth me
[1:04:35] that I have made them but Noah found
[1:04:39] Grace in the eyes of the Lord you know
[1:04:42] what that means brother Jonathan there's
[1:04:44] a chance for you and
[1:04:46] me that's right brother Dennis there's a
[1:04:48] chance for you and
[1:04:50] me because when we read about Noah we
[1:04:54] think of Noah as being a righteous man
[1:04:56] but none of us would stand up and admit
[1:04:58] that we were
[1:05:00] righteous right that's right because we
[1:05:02] all see our failures amen amen now
[1:05:06] brother Bron makes this point he says
[1:05:08] look Noah could not go into the ark
[1:05:12] before God was ready for him to
[1:05:14] go settle that in your
[1:05:17] heart I am here till the either the
[1:05:20] grave takes me or the Rapture
[1:05:23] comes
[1:05:24] and I'm going to serve the Lord no
[1:05:26] matter how many blown things they put on
[1:05:29] Facebook or whatever they want to do is
[1:05:32] fine with me my mind's already made up
[1:05:35] I've already seen the evidence of this
[1:05:39] and I know that it works and I know that
[1:05:41] God is not a liar so what that puts me
[1:05:45] in a in a precarious place so to speak
[1:05:49] because what are you going to do when
[1:05:51] things don't go well I'm just going to
[1:05:53] keep moving moving ahead that's what I'm
[1:05:55] going to do I'm going to keep I'm I'm
[1:05:57] just getting ready just going to keep
[1:06:00] going Noah could not go in the
[1:06:05] ark before it was time for him to go but
[1:06:08] when the season came for Noah to go into
[1:06:11] the ark God shut the door behind him
[1:06:15] Noah is that right all the opportunities
[1:06:18] for anyone else to ever enter it was
[1:06:20] gone because that God had closed the
[1:06:22] door so now notice when the time came
[1:06:25] for Noah to go into the ark the door
[1:06:28] closed and they could not
[1:06:30] close they couldn't even
[1:06:33] close until that
[1:06:36] time you imagine how many times Noah got
[1:06:39] frustrated with the people he was
[1:06:41] talking
[1:06:43] to come out there the next day I'm going
[1:06:45] to work on the ark today and somebody
[1:06:47] just stole my tools
[1:06:50] again or maybe the supply chain didn't
[1:06:53] Supply the gopherwood or he ordered so
[1:06:56] many gallons of tar and and pitch and
[1:06:59] only half of it showed
[1:07:03] up you don't believe me but okay let's
[1:07:06] go to First Peter 3 let's take a look at
[1:07:09] First Peter 3 then we'll go back
[1:07:13] there that's why the word of God has got
[1:07:16] to be your
[1:07:18] centerp it's got to be you can't you
[1:07:21] can't put it on brother
[1:07:22] John you can't put it on me don't follow
[1:07:25] me I'm a
[1:07:28] mess and I'm big enough to tell you
[1:07:32] that you don't have to say
[1:07:35] Amen First Peter 1 okay First Peter
[1:07:40] chapter 3: 18 for Christ also hath once
[1:07:44] suffered for sins the just for the
[1:07:47] unjust aren't you glad for
[1:07:50] that we are unjust but he Di died for us
[1:07:54] thank you
[1:07:56] Lord that he might bring us to God being
[1:08:00] put to death in the flesh but quickened
[1:08:03] by the spirit see so without the Holy
[1:08:08] Ghost by which also he went and preached
[1:08:11] under the spirits in prison which
[1:08:13] sometime were disobedient when Once the
[1:08:16] longsuffering of God waited in the days
[1:08:20] of
[1:08:21] Noah 120 years years he
[1:08:25] waited Noah didn't wait God
[1:08:30] waited cuz God had a set time when he
[1:08:34] was going to shut the
[1:08:36] door and God's longsuffering think how
[1:08:40] patient he is with us right because we
[1:08:44] pray and then we don't get the answer we
[1:08:46] want and we kind of Stomp our feet and
[1:08:48] we walk out and and God knows that and I
[1:08:52] appreciate that he knows that I'm
[1:08:54] flesh and he knows that I'm a
[1:08:57] mess and that I'm depending on a
[1:09:00] sacrifice that he
[1:09:02] provided and that's good enough for him
[1:09:04] it's good enough for me
[1:09:06] amen cuz he says God waited in the days
[1:09:11] of Noah while the ark was in a preparing
[1:09:14] wherein few that is eight Souls were
[1:09:17] saved by
[1:09:21] water in sup brother said so when God
[1:09:24] raised up Noah it was a sign that that
[1:09:28] intellectual age had come to its end
[1:09:32] why because he was fulfilling what Paul
[1:09:36] said there in 2
[1:09:38] Thessalonians Noah was God's word in the
[1:09:44] flesh
[1:09:46] manifested
[1:09:47] walking
[1:09:49] talking
[1:09:51] pleading just trying to be a friend to
[1:09:53] to the unlovable doing he was he was
[1:09:58] Christ manifested in the
[1:10:02] flesh standing before his neighbors
[1:10:05] living that life amen
[1:10:09] amen it was a sign that that
[1:10:11] intellectual age had come to its end and
[1:10:13] Noah preached the judgments of God
[1:10:16] coming and he was rejected and laughed
[1:10:18] at and made fun of but Noah went into
[1:10:21] the ark and God condemned those who left
[1:10:23] at him Noah was a sign of the uncoming
[1:10:27] Judgment God's sign to the Earth and if
[1:10:30] you think about just that little
[1:10:32] paragraph that little quote that is
[1:10:34] exactly what we read in 2 Thessalonians
[1:10:37] chapter 1 it is a manifest token of his
[1:10:41] love towards
[1:10:43] Noah even though Noah lived out verse 10
[1:10:48] through verse2 he lived out Christ but
[1:10:52] yet God then destroyed DED everybody
[1:10:56] that didn't listen to Noah amen Noah
[1:10:59] didn't destroy them Noah didn't take
[1:11:02] Vengeance on them that's a big problem
[1:11:04] that we have you know we have tempers we
[1:11:07] have sometimes we just you know and we
[1:11:10] lose it we don't want to admit that but
[1:11:14] we get upset but it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:11:18] it takes an extra measure of Grace say
[1:11:21] Lord please if you could if he already
[1:11:25] demonstrated it for us he showed us Amen
[1:11:29] in Genesis 7 verse1 it says and the Lord
[1:11:32] said unto Noah Come Thou and all the
[1:11:35] house into the ark for thee have I seen
[1:11:38] righteous before me and this
[1:11:41] generation and when God shut the door
[1:11:44] Noah couldn't open
[1:11:47] it God closed the
[1:11:50] door
[1:11:51] amen let's take a look at at
[1:11:56] Moses so in order to see Moses you have
[1:12:00] to go to Genesis
[1:12:05] 15 and Genesis 15 is a great prophecy
[1:12:09] about
[1:12:11] Moses but God never told Abraham he was
[1:12:14] going to do it with a
[1:12:17] Moses and in verse 13 it says and he
[1:12:20] said unto Abraham know of assurity that
[1:12:24] thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
[1:12:26] that is not theirs and Shall Serve them
[1:12:29] and they shall afflict them 400 years
[1:12:32] now how would you like to have that for
[1:12:33] a
[1:12:34] prophecy right brother Jonathan guess
[1:12:37] what you're going to lose your job
[1:12:40] you're going to lose everything I'm
[1:12:42] going to take it all away you're going
[1:12:43] to suffer and then one day I'm going to
[1:12:45] lift you up are you ready
[1:12:49] nope Abraham never comprehended what God
[1:12:53] said to him God just told it to
[1:12:57] him and also that Nation whom they Shall
[1:13:01] Serve will I judge and afterward shall
[1:13:04] they come out with great substance and
[1:13:07] thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace
[1:13:09] and thou shall be buried in a good old
[1:13:13] age that's the part about Moses then the
[1:13:16] rest is about
[1:13:21] Abram brother brandham said he said so
[1:13:23] he says it the time it came time one
[1:13:27] time for the children of Israel to be
[1:13:29] delivered from the Egyptian bondage was
[1:13:32] which is exactly what he's talking about
[1:13:35] here let's go to Exodus 1 because I want
[1:13:38] to read this and then read you this
[1:13:42] quote I hope you have not fallen
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:48] asleep because you should be hearing the
[1:13:51] still Small Voice in the background
[1:13:53] Crown if not I'll yell at you after a
[1:13:55] little
[1:13:58] bit in verse 7 of Exodus 1 it says and
[1:14:01] the children of Israel were fruitful and
[1:14:04] increased abundantly and multiplied and
[1:14:07] waxed exceedingly mightily and the land
[1:14:09] was filled with them it was a time of
[1:14:11] great blessings it was
[1:14:14] wonderful incomes was up they had nice
[1:14:17] houses they had kids they had grandkids
[1:14:20] they had Aunts Uncles life was good
[1:14:24] it's kind of like in the
[1:14:26] 60s it was
[1:14:28] good and then there arose up a new king
[1:14:31] over
[1:14:33] Egypt which knew not
[1:14:38] Joseph when the time of the promise Drew
[1:14:43] nigh there raised up a pharaoh who did
[1:14:45] not know
[1:14:47] Joseph why the season was
[1:14:52] there they
[1:14:53] respected Israel up to that
[1:15:01] time they respected the
[1:15:05] Israelites they respected them but God's
[1:15:09] time piece said it's
[1:15:12] time it's
[1:15:14] time and watch what God did you're still
[1:15:18] in Exodus
[1:15:19] right verse 9 and he said unto the
[1:15:22] people beh behold the people of the
[1:15:24] children of Israel are more and mightier
[1:15:26] than we so first of all he recognized he
[1:15:29] had a problem come on let us deal wisely
[1:15:32] with them lest they multiply and it come
[1:15:34] to pass that when they fall out fall
[1:15:37] without out any War they join also unto
[1:15:39] our
[1:15:40] enemies wisely that word's interpreted
[1:15:44] wrong let us deal deceitful with
[1:15:49] them
[1:15:50] right yeah let's let's we got to be
[1:15:54] careful because these Jews they could
[1:15:57] join with our enemies and fight against
[1:15:59] us and so get them up out of the land we
[1:16:02] need to get them out therefore did it
[1:16:04] Ser over them task Masters to afflict
[1:16:06] them with their burdens than anybody go
[1:16:09] back and read
[1:16:11] Genesis no these people came home and
[1:16:14] they were frustrated because now gas was
[1:16:17] going
[1:16:19] up now things were not quite the things
[1:16:22] were not quite the way they were when
[1:16:25] they started on this
[1:16:27] journey but God was fulfilling his
[1:16:31] word
[1:16:33] amen to afflict them and they built for
[1:16:37] Pharaoh treasured cities Fifth and
[1:16:42] ramsy you know King Tut you've probably
[1:16:44] seen that in the history books that's
[1:16:47] all the Jews
[1:16:49] work it is you can prove it in history
[1:16:54] and they were grieved because of the but
[1:16:57] the more they Afflicted them the more
[1:16:59] they multiplied and the more they grew
[1:17:02] but you see we're not in that hour I I
[1:17:04] don't know if you know that we're not in
[1:17:06] that hour We're in the top of the
[1:17:08] pyramid and when you're in the top of
[1:17:10] the pyramid the group gets less and less
[1:17:12] and less not more and more and
[1:17:15] more so there's going to be less and
[1:17:17] less Believers as we get closer and
[1:17:19] closer to the coming of the Lord amen
[1:17:25] but they they grew more and more they
[1:17:27] multiplied they grew and they were
[1:17:29] grieved because of the children of
[1:17:31] Israel and the Egyptians made the
[1:17:32] children of Israel to serve with rigor
[1:17:37] amen amen and then it says and they made
[1:17:40] their lives
[1:17:42] bitter with hard bondage in Mortar brick
[1:17:46] all manner of service in the field all
[1:17:49] their service wherein they made them
[1:17:50] serve was with rigor
[1:17:55] amen and what was it what was God doing
[1:17:58] brother Bram said but the season was
[1:18:00] there for no more
[1:18:03] respect that God could shower down his
[1:18:07] judgment upon the
[1:18:10] Egyptians he could not judge the
[1:18:14] Egyptians without them losing respect
[1:18:17] for the
[1:18:20] Believers amen
[1:18:24] chapter 2 it all changes with the birth
[1:18:27] of Moses Moses comes on the scene and
[1:18:32] Moses he was he was
[1:18:35] thinking Moses if you if you study it
[1:18:38] and and we don't have time but Moses had
[1:18:41] a supernatural birth he was he was born
[1:18:44] at the wrong time they were murdering
[1:18:47] all the male children his parents didn't
[1:18:50] obey their federal law they hid the
[1:18:52] child for three months till he got too
[1:18:54] big he started making too much noise
[1:18:57] they prayed God said put him in a basket
[1:19:01] take him down and put him in the Nile
[1:19:04] River and they protested they said you
[1:19:06] know the Lord don't you know there's
[1:19:08] alligators down there why would I give
[1:19:11] this nice smelling young boy to the
[1:19:16] alligators for
[1:19:18] lunch but God had a plan God took him
[1:19:23] down let took him right to Pharaoh's
[1:19:25] it's great it's a it's beautiful he goes
[1:19:28] right down to Pharaoh's uh daughter's
[1:19:31] feet and she says it's a Hebrew why
[1:19:34] don't you just drown it
[1:19:36] then but she didn't because God's season
[1:19:41] and time and he watches over not the he
[1:19:46] watches over his
[1:19:49] word so because Moses was a fulfillment
[1:19:52] of the word God wasn't so much concerned
[1:19:54] about the vessel but the promise that
[1:19:57] laid in the
[1:19:58] vessel The Vessel you see you're just
[1:20:01] the vessel of God so that God can
[1:20:04] manifest his
[1:20:05] word he wants to manifest his word and
[1:20:09] if he destroys the vessel how's he going
[1:20:11] to do that so then he'll watch over
[1:20:13] you amen praise the Lord amen amen amen
[1:20:18] so Moses went out and he killed the
[1:20:20] Egyptian we know the story he killed the
[1:20:21] Egyptian but one little detail that I
[1:20:24] had failed to miss in 30 years or
[1:20:26] whatever of serving the lord I want you
[1:20:29] to look at verse
[1:20:31] 21 verse 21 of chapter 2 says and Moses
[1:20:35] was content to dwell with the
[1:20:39] man and he gave Moses Zora his
[1:20:43] daughter Moses was
[1:20:46] content once he once he fled out into
[1:20:48] the Wilderness and he fled from Pharaoh
[1:20:52] he was good to get away
[1:20:54] from he was good to get away from God he
[1:20:57] was good to get away from the promise he
[1:21:00] was good he was
[1:21:02] good and he was
[1:21:04] content the priest of Midian he says
[1:21:07] yeah he says this is a good life for me
[1:21:08] I can have a child here the Egyptians
[1:21:11] are way far away children of Israel they
[1:21:14] don't believe me they don't want me as
[1:21:17] their
[1:21:18] deliverer and here I am I I just I'm
[1:21:21] good
[1:21:23] in the believer's position in Christ
[1:21:25] brother brandham says so now Moses when
[1:21:27] he was here knowing that God had made a
[1:21:29] promise that he was going to deliver the
[1:21:32] children of Israel why Moses knowing
[1:21:35] that he was called for that
[1:21:39] purpose now when you have a call from
[1:21:42] God that doesn't mean altogether that
[1:21:44] you can just jump right out and you're
[1:21:46] going to do the will of God you have to
[1:21:49] find the will of God and the time time
[1:21:53] of God to do it Moses thought well the
[1:21:56] children of Israel will certainly
[1:21:58] understand now that I'm to be their
[1:22:00] deliverer so he starts out to be so he
[1:22:02] kills a man he find out that the
[1:22:04] children of Israel did not
[1:22:06] understand then Moses lost all the hopes
[1:22:10] and all the power that he had why
[1:22:12] because his faith was shaken and when
[1:22:15] you when you when you get rid of your
[1:22:17] faith you lose your
[1:22:21] power cuz you can't make the word
[1:22:24] live God makes the word live and that
[1:22:27] gives you faith and when you deny God
[1:22:31] living in you then you have no
[1:22:34] power right long as Samson let his hair
[1:22:37] grow out because that was the word he
[1:22:40] was good but when he F when he said yeah
[1:22:43] go ahead cut him off and he thought he
[1:22:45] said when he when he rose up he said oh
[1:22:47] I think I think I'll shake myself like I
[1:22:49] did in time past and he knew not that he
[1:22:52] was faithless and that he had lost all
[1:22:55] his
[1:22:56] power Moses lost all the hope all the
[1:22:59] power that he had thinking that freedom
[1:23:02] wasn't even for the children of Israel
[1:23:04] the whole promise is a lie in the last
[1:23:07] days the scripture says that people
[1:23:10] Believers will say where's the promise
[1:23:12] of his coming right you
[1:23:16] see you got to rest you got to find
[1:23:19] where the word applies to you you got to
[1:23:21] put it in the center of your life you
[1:23:23] got to stay I mean you can you can do
[1:23:25] what you want brother John tells you all
[1:23:27] the time you're a free moral agent right
[1:23:31] right but choose the word you'll be all
[1:23:33] right
[1:23:37] Amen brother brandom in another message
[1:23:39] called gifts he says then he did not do
[1:23:42] nothing within himself no Prophet ever
[1:23:44] did anything within himself until first
[1:23:47] God showed what to
[1:23:50] do what a mistake Moses made when he
[1:23:53] went out without the vision of God and
[1:23:55] smokee that
[1:23:57] Egyptian thought he'd liberate them with
[1:23:59] his hands because he thought he had a
[1:24:01] lot of faith and that he could do it
[1:24:04] because he was called to do the
[1:24:06] job no matter how much you're called for
[1:24:09] the job God has to do the leading you
[1:24:11] see he failed of all of his schooling
[1:24:14] and his military mind and his training
[1:24:17] as a great Egyptian leader yet it failed
[1:24:20] because God had a program and we've got
[1:24:23] to work according to God's program no
[1:24:26] matter what we do how smart we are we've
[1:24:28] got to Humble ourselves and work
[1:24:30] according to God's program amen so he
[1:24:34] failed and God had to keep him another
[1:24:36] 40 years to educate him you know what he
[1:24:39] was educating him it wasn't so much that
[1:24:41] he had to forget everything that he
[1:24:42] learned from the Egyptians but he had to
[1:24:44] learn to trust
[1:24:46] God that's the only lesson he had to
[1:24:49] learn the only lesson you have to learn
[1:24:51] is to trust God God you already know
[1:24:54] math you know science you know how to
[1:24:56] read you know how to write you don't
[1:24:58] have to learn all of that to get rid of
[1:25:00] all that to become a Christian right to
[1:25:02] become a Christian you got to learn to
[1:25:04] trust God Amen and Trust his word and
[1:25:07] stay with his word when things go wrong
[1:25:10] and look for his promise amen because
[1:25:13] his promise is yay and amen amen amen
[1:25:16] see so we failed God had to keep him
[1:25:20] another 40 years to educate him so what
[1:25:22] it was he must forget himself and it's
[1:25:26] not him but it's God the promise to
[1:25:31] Abraham wasn't that I've got this man
[1:25:34] and he's going to come and deliver you
[1:25:36] that isn't what the prophecy said the
[1:25:38] prophecy said I will bring them out with
[1:25:42] a mighty hand amen I'm going to do the
[1:25:45] work because I'm the one who's sending
[1:25:46] him down there you think about how when
[1:25:50] everything when the promise of God which
[1:25:52] was a blessing it wasn't a blessing to
[1:25:56] Joseph see now I'm in trouble cuz I'm
[1:25:59] starting to preach and we're out of
[1:26:02] time Joseph Joseph was 17 year olds he
[1:26:06] couldn't it was not his fault that he
[1:26:08] had the
[1:26:10] dream his fault was that he testified
[1:26:12] about the
[1:26:13] dream he probably shouldn't have shared
[1:26:15] it with anybody he shared it with his
[1:26:18] brothers and made his brothers mad then
[1:26:20] he had another dream so he shared it
[1:26:21] with his dad and they got mad right and
[1:26:25] then when he went down his brother said
[1:26:27] oh here comes the dreamer they weren't
[1:26:30] complaining about the coat and
[1:26:31] everything else the
[1:26:33] dreamer here comes the
[1:26:36] dreamer let's kick him out of here and
[1:26:38] see how his dreams work out now God was
[1:26:44] taking him right where he needed to
[1:26:46] be taking him every and you know when he
[1:26:50] went to Piper's house you know people
[1:26:52] think they they they got the wrong
[1:26:56] idea I'm going to give you some advice
[1:26:58] brother Jonathan don't make yourself
[1:27:00] weird don't don't put yourself out there
[1:27:02] like some kind of a
[1:27:04] nut God wants you to be Jesus Christ
[1:27:07] that's what he wants you to be be loving
[1:27:10] kind be a help to The Sinner do
[1:27:13] something for somebody don't be crazy
[1:27:15] that's
[1:27:16] right because Joseph went down to
[1:27:19] Piper's house and he became the vice
[1:27:21] president of the company
[1:27:23] he did and it wasn't that Joseph was the
[1:27:26] problem Piper's wife was the problem
[1:27:28] because God said okay we got him now I'm
[1:27:31] going to take him down I'm the Potter
[1:27:33] he's the clay I'm going to Mar him down
[1:27:35] here a little bit work on him a little
[1:27:37] bit more he took him down and put him in
[1:27:38] the prison that's a bad place right he
[1:27:40] not a bad place but you know what he
[1:27:42] come the head
[1:27:44] chef he became the guy that gave
[1:27:46] everybody else to food and he still had
[1:27:49] dreams he still had interpreting of
[1:27:51] Dreams you see you're looking at all the
[1:27:54] circumstances and everything you're
[1:27:55] looking at all wrong we know that we're
[1:27:59] in 2024 I don't really care because I'm
[1:28:02] looking at the word of God we know that
[1:28:06] everything is kind of a
[1:28:07] mess we know that let me read those last
[1:28:10] couple quotes and then and you know I'm
[1:28:15] not going to do those
[1:28:16] 75 scriptures I got
[1:28:20] afterwards hey had
[1:28:22] lost all thoughts of Freedom till God
[1:28:25] met him one day in a burning bush and
[1:28:28] then when God season came along just
[1:28:32] exactly then he revealed his plan to
[1:28:37] Moses so when God killed the Egyptian it
[1:28:39] wasn't God's season when he went out
[1:28:42] into the desert it wasn't God's season
[1:28:45] but God had to train Moses he had to
[1:28:49] teach Moses to trust him trust the word
[1:28:53] trust me trust me I will take care of
[1:28:57] you oh but I can't I just don't you know
[1:29:00] that's a thing it's a funny thing
[1:29:02] right I'm going to say this once and
[1:29:04] then probably never say it again but you
[1:29:06] know that's a thing with ties ties is an
[1:29:09] act of worship it's not an act of giving
[1:29:12] it's just it's not it's not an act of
[1:29:14] you doing anything it's an act of
[1:29:16] worship right and if you don't have
[1:29:18] faith to worship then don't don't do it
[1:29:20] don't do it to say God give increase my
[1:29:23] faith and let let God prove that he can
[1:29:27] keep his word amen am amen now the
[1:29:32] reason Moses had forgotten about Freedom
[1:29:34] God's promise that he would free them
[1:29:37] but God had not forgot his promise Moses
[1:29:40] tried in himself and failed and that's
[1:29:43] what the church has done many times
[1:29:46] we've tried in ourselves to do things
[1:29:48] and when we fail to find God's element
[1:29:52] of time God's got a time for all things
[1:29:57] amen so what season do we live in well
[1:30:00] according to Luke 17 as it was in the
[1:30:03] days of Noah okay so we know in the days
[1:30:05] of Noah it was a time of prosperity but
[1:30:08] we also know that it was every
[1:30:10] imagination on the man was wickedness
[1:30:13] and evil and everything else so quit
[1:30:15] complaining about it the scriptures are
[1:30:17] being
[1:30:18] fulfilled right as it was in the days of
[1:30:20] Noah so there also in Luke 21 it says
[1:30:24] earthquakes in diverse places and the
[1:30:27] Sea roaring we just see California this
[1:30:30] La this past week California got half a
[1:30:33] year worth of rain in one
[1:30:35] day half a year worth the rain in one
[1:30:39] day you g to stop that well I mean I I
[1:30:43] agree I believe global warming is true I
[1:30:45] I don't think it's fake carbon emissions
[1:30:48] is a bad thing yep but you going to stop
[1:30:50] that we turn on all the cars to electric
[1:30:52] and we're still not going to stop that
[1:30:54] because we've given up on God we've
[1:30:57] turned our back on God and what are we
[1:30:59] we are
[1:31:01] Noah right amen we are we have found
[1:31:04] Grace in his sight and all God wants us
[1:31:06] to do is second in Thessalonians 1 Let
[1:31:09] Jesus Christ live in you amen
[1:31:13] earthquakes in diverse places the sea
[1:31:15] roaring Ezekiel 7:19 says it'll come a
[1:31:18] time when they'll cast their silver into
[1:31:21] the streets and their gold will not save
[1:31:25] them yeah so if my 41 K goes oh well
[1:31:32] right but I don't know because the
[1:31:34] scripture said you know when that
[1:31:36] happens I should be saying praise the
[1:31:38] Lord God's word it's another piece it's
[1:31:41] another element it's another brick in
[1:31:43] the place because every time he does
[1:31:45] fulfill something we're getting closer
[1:31:47] to his coming that's right amen Daniel
[1:31:50] 12 1-4 says that in the last days
[1:31:53] they'll run to and fro and knowledge
[1:31:55] shall increase we're there praise the
[1:31:58] Lord praise the
[1:32:00] Lord when we sing glory to his name we
[1:32:02] should think about the things that God's
[1:32:04] fulfilling around us
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:09] amen and then we all know 2 Timothy 3
[1:32:12] 1-5 where it says in the last day
[1:32:14] perilous times will come and men will be
[1:32:16] lovers of their themselves and they'll
[1:32:17] be transvestites and they'll be gay
[1:32:20] marriage and even the pope now is
[1:32:21] thinking that maybe he should soften his
[1:32:23] stance on gay marriage and why there's
[1:32:26] nothing you can do about it because it's
[1:32:27] the word of God being
[1:32:31] fulfilled I'm not I'm not okay good I'm
[1:32:36] happy for
[1:32:39] you Romans 4 tells me I believe it's
[1:32:41] Romans 4 tells me it says when they knew
[1:32:44] God they didn't want to know him and he
[1:32:46] turned them over to a reprobate mind
[1:32:48] that they'd do ungodly things amongst
[1:32:50] themselves and everything else it's
[1:32:51] right there in the Bible you don't want
[1:32:53] you going to rip that page out fine I
[1:32:55] choose not
[1:32:56] to amen
[1:33:00] am Revelations 3:10 says that there will
[1:33:04] come a time on the pace of the Earth
[1:33:05] when the Temptation will come that will
[1:33:07] try the whole world now I know everybody
[1:33:11] listens to the news and we all think the
[1:33:13] economy here is bad but you don't have
[1:33:14] to open your eyes very much to find out
[1:33:16] that the economy is bad
[1:33:20] worldwide it's not not here our economy
[1:33:23] is actually doing pretty good when I
[1:33:25] look at places that got 200% inflation
[1:33:28] I'm thankful for whatever I'm paying for
[1:33:30] a loaf of
[1:33:32] bread
[1:33:35] really and Argentina I I read where
[1:33:38] Argentina right after World War II was
[1:33:41] one the almost the richest nation in
[1:33:44] South America because of beef sales they
[1:33:47] got 200% inflation there right now and
[1:33:51] the guy that just took over as president
[1:33:53] in that country he wants to completely
[1:33:56] get rid of their uh whatever their their
[1:34:00] uh currency is and they want to use US
[1:34:04] dollars but the government is so crooked
[1:34:07] that the government won't let him do
[1:34:10] it and the other thing that you had to
[1:34:12] notice I
[1:34:13] mean I like it a lot to say but I'm not
[1:34:16] going to say
[1:34:18] it and then Revelations 13 you forgot to
[1:34:21] look at Revelations 13 you should
[1:34:22] probably read Revelations 13 once a
[1:34:25] month because the Bible says that in the
[1:34:28] last days the Beast will give the power
[1:34:31] to the image of the Beast to speak as
[1:34:34] and he will he'll come after the Saints
[1:34:36] and he's going to go part of the economy
[1:34:39] he's going to have everything in his
[1:34:40] hands praise the Lord God said he'd take
[1:34:43] care of
[1:34:44] me and that's what I'm concerned about
[1:34:47] oh that looks like it's all really
[1:34:48] really bad but if you give me another
[1:34:50] five minutes I hope I help you so in
[1:34:53] Luke 22:32 let's put that one up there
[1:34:56] we'll do the last couple
[1:34:58] here what's that say fear not fear not
[1:35:03] little flock for it is your father's
[1:35:04] good pleasure to give you the kingdom

[1:35:48] the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the
[1:35:52] evening light has come it's a fact that
[1:35:55] God and Christ are one it shall come to
[1:35:58] pass in that day that the light shall
[1:35:59] not be clear nor dark but
[1:36:05] yeah things that were true for years are
[1:36:08] no longer true what's the next verse
[1:36:10] say who art th oh great M he shall bring
[1:36:14] forth well here we go see crying Grace
[1:36:18] who art thou oh great Mountain before
[1:36:20] his rebble thou sh become a plane and he
[1:36:22] shall bring forth The Headstone thereof
[1:36:24] with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto
[1:36:27] it you know what the headstone is we're
[1:36:29] part of that Noah found Grace in the
[1:36:32] eyes of the Lord amen amen praise the
[1:36:36] Lord that's a promise for us not to be
[1:36:39] worried about the economy or what the
[1:36:41] gays and the lesbians are doing they're
[1:36:43] okay leave them
[1:36:44] alone amen Malachi 4 told me behold I I
[1:36:51] God himself shall send you Jonathan
[1:36:55] thank you he sent you Elijah the prophet
[1:36:58] thank you Lord he sent me Elijah the
[1:37:00] prophet so if you don't want him I'm

[1:37:13] good one and such it do wickedly against
[1:37:16] the Covenant shall be corrupted by
[1:37:18] flatteries well we're doing that now but
[1:37:20] the people that do know their God shall
[1:37:23] be strong and do exploits praise the
[1:37:28] Lord and the first exploit that they're
[1:37:30] going to do is they're going to live
[1:37:32] like Christians amen that's what they're
[1:37:35] going to do
[1:37:37] amen and then I'm just close with
[1:37:39] Philippians
[1:37:41] 2:15 and you can forget about everything

[1:37:57] perverse Nation so why are you praying

[1:38:03] perverse then you're breaking the
[1:38:06] scriptures somebody's got to be here to
[1:38:09] be that
[1:38:11] amen how many I mean I'm a Son of God I
[1:38:14] don't care if you put your hand up or

[1:40:17] Jewish rabbi in there he was talking to
[1:40:20] this guy
[1:40:21] he said there was a man there was a man
[1:40:23] that that he he got up one day and he he
[1:40:27] got done saying his prayers at the
[1:40:29] synagogue and he went out and he said he
[1:40:30] found out that somebody this he he read
[1:40:33] an article this guy needed a
[1:40:36] kidney so we went to the doctor and he
[1:40:38] had the blood test and go he found out
[1:40:40] hey my kidney I could help this guy so
[1:40:43] he signed up had his kidney taken out
[1:40:45] gave it to this guy and he felt pretty
[1:40:48] good for a couple of days then he found
[1:40:50] out there with somebody else then they
[1:40:53] needed a liver and he said oh I can't
[1:40:54] live without a liver but they found
[1:40:56] somebody who could use some blood so he
[1:40:58] started gave he gave blood then he found
[1:41:01] his people were hungry so he took
[1:41:03] everything from his grocery store and he
[1:41:05] went down and he gave it to the homeless
[1:41:07] shelter and everything else well then it
[1:41:09] got so burdensome in
[1:41:12] him that he finally went down to the
[1:41:14] registry and he he donated all of his
[1:41:18] all of his organs and then he went home
[1:41:21] and he got in his bathtub and he slid
[1:41:22] his wrists and called

[1:41:31] how we

[1:41:35] everyone but we can pray for everyone
[1:41:38] Jesus said not everybody can go to the
[1:41:40] mission field but he says pray to the
[1:41:42] Lord of the Harvest that he'll send
[1:41:45] someone that he'll send someone that
[1:41:48] knows their language someone that knows
[1:41:50] their custom
