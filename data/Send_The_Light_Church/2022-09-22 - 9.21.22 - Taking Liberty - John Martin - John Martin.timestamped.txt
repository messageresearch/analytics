[35:10] saint luke chapter 4 starting with verse
[35:12] number 16
[35:14] and he came to nazareth
[35:17] where he had been brought up and as his
[35:20] custom was he went to the synagogues on
[35:22] the sabbath day and stood up for to read
[35:27] and there was delivered unto him the
[35:28] book of the prophet isaiah
[35:31] and
[35:32] when he had opened the book
[35:34] he found the place when it was written
[35:37] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[35:40] because he have anointed me to preach
[35:42] the gospel to the poor he have set
[35:45] have sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[35:48] to preach deliverance to the captives
[35:51] and to recover the sight of the blind
[35:54] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[35:57] to preach the acceptable year of the
[36:00] lord
[36:02] and he closed the book he gave it again
[36:05] to the minister and he sat down and the
[36:08] eyes of all them that were in the
[36:09] synagogue were fastened on and we began
[36:11] to say unto them this day
[36:14] is the scripture fulfilled in your ears
[36:18] amen god bless you may be seated
[36:22] we just want to entitle this message
[36:24] taking liberty
[36:26] taking liberty just
[36:30] we want to broaden our our scope of
[36:32] understanding about liberty amen
[36:39] not so much in an evangelistical
[36:43] way
[36:44] um
[36:46] but
[36:47] uh in a way to
[36:49] to to greater give us an understanding
[36:53] and how many has ever wondered
[36:57] why there wasn't more liberty
[36:59] in our church
[37:01] has anybody ever
[37:03] wondered that
[37:07] okay praise the lord praise the lord
[37:11] you know the high priest he had liberty
[37:14] to go into the holiest of holies
[37:18] once he
[37:20] take the take this liberty go in there
[37:22] and offer the sins of the people
[37:25] he had liberty to do that
[37:28] but that
[37:29] but that doesn't mean he could do
[37:32] whatever he wanted to
[37:35] or do it the way he wanted to
[37:38] he still
[37:39] had to use the liberty that was given to
[37:41] him to do it the way god wanted him to
[37:45] [Music]
[37:47] when someone comes over your house do
[37:49] you do you want them to feel welcomed
[37:53] of course
[37:54] do you want them to to sit down if they
[37:56] want to sit
[37:58] do you want them to ask for a glass of
[38:00] water if they're thirsty
[38:02] you want them to feel that liberty do
[38:04] you you want them to to better use the
[38:06] bathroom if they want to use the
[38:08] bathroom of course you want them to have
[38:11] that liberty
[38:13] but do you want them going through all
[38:15] the drawers in your house in your
[38:16] bedroom
[38:19] so
[38:20] but what if they want to
[38:22] see
[38:24] it doesn't matter
[38:26] liberty has boundaries
[38:31] liberties have boundaries
[38:34] we think about uh
[38:36] it also has responsibilities
[38:39] we think about the ten the parable
[38:42] where the talents were given out and
[38:45] jesus said
[38:46] just take your liberty and go do what
[38:49] you want to do with these but i want to
[38:52] return
[38:55] and those that took their liberty to do
[38:57] what they wanted to do with it got in
[38:59] trouble
[39:01] but those that took the liberty that
[39:03] they had and did what god told him to do
[39:06] got rewarded
[39:08] so liberty
[39:10] isn't necessarily what we think liberty
[39:13] is
[39:14] in the message the mighty conqueror
[39:16] brother branham said the spirit of the
[39:18] lord is in this building tonight
[39:22] to set free and give liberty
[39:25] for the mighty conqueror has paid the
[39:27] price and men are at liberty to be
[39:31] healed
[39:32] and to be set free
[39:34] oh how precious is his word to us
[39:38] now we read in our opening scripture
[39:40] that this jesus said the spirit of the
[39:43] lord is upon me
[39:47] but that spirit
[39:50] led him to calvary
[39:53] it didn't lead him to do what he wanted
[39:55] to do
[39:56] but to go to calvary
[39:58] calvary is where the price was paid for
[40:01] our sins where we got liberated from
[40:04] amen amen the price for our liberty was
[40:07] paid at
[40:08] calvary isaiah 53 verse 4 says surely he
[40:12] had borne our griefs and carried her
[40:14] sorrows yet
[40:15] we did not esteem him stricken smitten
[40:18] of god and afflicted but he was wounded
[40:20] for our transgression he was bruised for
[40:22] our iniquities and the chastisement of
[40:24] our peace was upon him and with his
[40:27] stripes we are healed
[40:33] this was for our liberty
[40:39] jesus took his liberty
[40:44] and walked in obedience to what the
[40:46] father told him to do that we might have
[40:49] liberty
[40:51] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 says and you
[40:54] have he quickened who were dead in
[40:56] trespasses and sins where in times past
[40:59] ye walked according to the course of
[41:01] this world according to the prince of
[41:03] the power the spirit that now worketh in
[41:05] the children of disobedience
[41:08] among whom also we all had our
[41:11] conversations in times past fulfilling
[41:15] the lust of the flesh or i could just
[41:17] say like this the liberty to do what we
[41:18] want to do
[41:20] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[41:22] of the mind and we're by nature
[41:25] the children of wrath even as others if
[41:26] you if you just didn't get what you want
[41:30] you made it
[41:32] known but god who is rich in mercy for
[41:36] his great love wherewith he loved us for
[41:38] when we were dead in sins have he
[41:40] quickened us together with christ by
[41:42] grace are ye saved
[41:45] god
[41:46] has set us free
[41:49] and have raised us up together and made
[41:51] us to sit together in heavenly places in
[41:54] christ jesus that in the ages to come
[41:57] this this age that we're living in that
[41:59] in the ages to come he might show the
[42:02] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[42:04] kindness
[42:05] towards us
[42:08] through jesus christ he has
[42:11] shown his goodness to us by revealing to
[42:14] us that we can be set free from that
[42:16] type of life
[42:18] from the from the world
[42:22] calvary paid the price
[42:24] for our sins
[42:26] we've been set free we've been set at
[42:28] liberty we're no longer under the
[42:30] bondage
[42:32] of this world we're no longer
[42:34] we don't have to listen to the devil
[42:37] we no longer have to live underneath the
[42:40] privileges
[42:42] that god has given us
[42:44] we've been set free it's
[42:46] it's it's it's recognizing it amen
[42:50] but we need to keep pursuing more truth
[42:54] for our personal life because we're on
[42:56] different levels of walking in whatever
[42:57] truth god has shown us
[42:59] and we need to continue walking in it
[43:03] john 8 verse 31
[43:06] then jesus said to the jews which
[43:08] believed on him if i could say it like
[43:09] this if jesus was here he would he would
[43:12] speak to the christians which believed
[43:14] on him
[43:15] and what would he say he would say if
[43:18] you continue in my word then are you my
[43:21] disciples indeed
[43:23] so there's a continuation that is
[43:25] required and you shall know the truth
[43:28] and the truth shall make you free
[43:32] truth continues to liberate us
[43:36] i know we've been saved but all you've
[43:38] got to do is go through the course of
[43:40] the day and say oh wretched man that i
[43:43] am who's going to who's going to who's
[43:44] going to take care of me
[43:48] so
[43:49] we got to walk in the truth that god
[43:51] shows us every
[43:52] day because we're all longing to be
[43:56] liberated to have more freedom
[44:03] liberty is essential
[44:07] it's one of the building blocks of our
[44:09] nation
[44:10] was liberty
[44:12] there were certain individuals that
[44:14] didn't want to be tied to the rule of
[44:16] the british
[44:17] they wanted to be set free from their
[44:20] laws and they wanted to be liberated
[44:22] it was so important to them that they
[44:24] were willing to fight for liberty
[44:28] we remember patrick henry said give me
[44:30] liberty or give me death that's how
[44:32] important liberty
[44:34] was it's important to a christian
[44:38] our first uh
[44:42] amendment
[44:43] established liberty for us it was the
[44:45] freedom of speech
[44:46] religion press
[44:48] of the assembly together and the right
[44:51] to petition
[44:52] the government
[44:54] amen
[44:55] freedom to do that that's our first
[44:57] amendment
[45:02] i pledge allegiance to the flag of the
[45:04] united states of america
[45:07] and to the republic for which it stands
[45:10] one nation under god invisible with
[45:13] liberty
[45:14] and justice for all
[45:17] liberty is important
[45:20] it's important to the believer
[45:23] of course we know that the spirit of
[45:26] this age
[45:27] is trying to change our constitution
[45:32] they're trying to take our liberty away
[45:34] our rights away
[45:36] our guns away everything that it can
[45:38] take it away and bring us back into
[45:40] bondage
[45:44] there was a time that our colonies
[45:46] didn't want to pay
[45:47] taxes without representation of where
[45:49] that money was going
[45:58] oh what did
[46:01] our government who stood for that what
[46:03] did they end up turning into
[46:06] taking our money without us giving to
[46:08] say so where it's going
[46:11] and they said it was taxation without
[46:14] representation it's still tyranny
[46:18] no different
[46:20] it just
[46:22] it happened so slow
[46:26] the devil is trying to take our liberty
[46:29] our rights
[46:31] and to bring us under bondage
[46:34] we need to remember the words of our
[46:36] savior he that the son has set free is
[46:38] free indeed
[46:41] and to stand there
[46:42] in that liberty amen
[46:46] liberty is such an important element for
[46:48] the believer
[46:50] believers must have liberty to worship
[46:53] god from the dictates of their heart
[46:55] amen
[46:56] and that's in spirit and in truth
[47:00] believers must have liberty to hear the
[47:02] truth to to come to a place
[47:05] to where they know they're hearing the
[47:07] truth because
[47:08] it's the continuation of truth that
[47:11] continues to set us more free
[47:17] believers need liberty for god to move
[47:20] in their behalf
[47:22] without liberty change cannot take place
[47:25] i'm going to be read the next two
[47:27] scriptures
[47:28] were read in our men's meeting
[47:31] but they were already printed off the
[47:33] computer on my desk before the men's
[47:35] meeting
[47:37] i didn't want to say anything but turn
[47:38] with me to second corinthians chapter 3
[47:41] verse 17.
[47:46] now the lord is that spirit and where
[47:48] the spirit of the lord is
[47:51] there is liberty
[47:53] we need the spirit of the lord
[48:00] but we all with open face beholding as
[48:03] in a glass the glory of the lord
[48:06] are changed into the same image from
[48:09] glory
[48:10] to glory even as the spirit
[48:12] even as by the spirit of the lord
[48:18] we as believers must give liberty
[48:22] to god to change us
[48:26] we're not going to be changed
[48:29] if we take liberty
[48:30] if we have liberty
[48:33] we got to
[48:35] what why is jesus knocking on the door
[48:37] here
[48:40] unless we open the door let him come in
[48:42] he's not going to change us
[48:45] so the the liberty god doesn't come
[48:49] where he's not welcomed
[48:52] that's why he inhabits the praises of
[48:53] his people
[48:55] that's why he kicks out the doubt
[48:57] and brings faith around him
[49:02] liberty is so god can work
[49:05] liberty is not so we can do what we want
[49:07] to do
[49:09] the holy spirit works through free more
[49:11] agency to bring the changes that need to
[49:14] take place in our life or that we long
[49:16] for
[49:18] liberty gives the believer power to
[49:21] change more into the image of god
[49:24] power to manifest christ power to
[49:27] cast out unclean spirits out of our
[49:29] lives
[49:31] power to become
[49:33] that's what liberty does
[49:36] he came to his own his own received and
[49:38] not but as many as received them
[49:41] gave him power
[49:42] to become the sons of god
[49:46] so it's it's through giving god
[49:50] liberty in our lives
[49:53] the word of god is not a law of do's and
[49:56] don'ts
[49:58] the word of god is simply liberty
[50:02] the word of god is simply our liberty
[50:07] and
[50:08] and and it's it's hard to
[50:11] comprehend it but it's the truth that
[50:14] sets us free
[50:15] that liberates us
[50:17] truth leads us to true freedom
[50:21] james chapter 1 verse 25 but whosoever
[50:25] looketh into the perfect
[50:27] law of liberty
[50:30] and continueth therein
[50:33] he being not a forgetful hearer
[50:35] but a doer of the work this man is going
[50:38] to be blessed in his deed
[50:41] that's why we love the truth here
[50:43] it brings freedom
[50:45] give me liberty or give me death
[50:51] luke chapter 10 verse 17. so here the
[50:55] the 70 were sent out and they returned
[50:58] again with joy saying lord even the
[51:00] devils are subject unto us through thy
[51:02] name
[51:05] notice
[51:07] it's through jesus
[51:09] that we get everything we need
[51:13] and jesus said unto them i beheld satan
[51:16] as lightning
[51:18] falling from heaven
[51:23] all through the name of jesus
[51:27] all we need is faith in jesus
[51:32] that's all we need
[51:34] we don't need anything else
[51:40] it's us and him
[51:44] it's
[51:47] do not put the responsibility on 15
[51:49] other people three other people two
[51:51] other people one other people
[51:54] it's you and jesus
[51:58] if i
[51:59] blame
[52:03] my wife
[52:08] for something
[52:10] then i could i could all i have to do is
[52:12] i don't have to take responsibility
[52:20] the tendency that we have
[52:23] is to feel that we are put in a box
[52:26] because of a situation
[52:30] and you and god are a majority
[52:34] you take your liberty in christ
[52:39] that's all you need
[52:41] and we'll you're going to understand
[52:42] more as we're going on because
[52:45] because
[52:46] liberty is not for us to do what we feel
[52:49] to do
[52:50] that's not what liberty is for
[52:53] liberty is to do what god wants us to do
[52:57] that's what liberty's given to us for
[53:04] most everyone
[53:06] that is alive wants liberty
[53:09] to do what they want to do
[53:12] but it comes with a responsibility
[53:16] liberty without the responsibility of
[53:18] respect to god's word is the same thing
[53:21] as power without character
[53:23] it's satanic
[53:25] that's that's how dangerous liberty is
[53:28] when it's not in control by the holy
[53:30] ghost
[53:32] we've all seen children when they don't
[53:33] get what they want at home they'll begin
[53:35] to manipulate
[53:39] well bobby's parents let them watch
[53:41] anything they want to on tv why can't we
[53:46] well the last place i work they let me
[53:49] take as many breaks as i want
[53:54] well brother so-and-so lets his kids
[53:57] brother so-and-so lets his church
[53:59] brother so-and-so lets his wife
[54:02] they can wear
[54:06] see
[54:07] people want liberty to do what they want
[54:09] to do
[54:13] but just doing what you want to do
[54:16] doesn't make it right
[54:19] everyone wants more liberty to do what
[54:20] they want to do
[54:22] lucifer had liberty to do what he wanted
[54:26] we don't know how many years lucifer
[54:30] did the right thing he was a perfect
[54:32] angel
[54:33] he was absolutely perfect and he he he
[54:37] got the whole church in heaven to be in
[54:40] perfect harmony
[54:42] pointing all of them to that
[54:45] that jesus was god
[54:47] the only god
[54:50] there was nothing in there about a
[54:52] possibility of me
[54:54] i mean he was a perfect angel using his
[54:56] liberty to do what god wanted him to do
[55:00] until
[55:03] until
[55:04] he used his liberty
[55:06] to do what he wanted to do
[55:11] and then it became dangerous
[55:14] one day jealousy set in
[55:17] i want to be like the most high
[55:19] i want to exalt my throne above the
[55:21] stars of god i want to ascend to the
[55:22] heights of the clouds i want to sit on
[55:24] the mountain of the congregation
[55:28] he mixed what he was doing
[55:31] with his will
[55:33] and his agenda
[55:37] liberty is dangerous
[55:42] he took his liberty and little by little
[55:44] he convinced a third of heaven
[55:48] to start following their own will
[55:52] why stay in heaven and have to do what
[55:54] god wants you to do
[55:55] when you can just do what you want to do
[55:59] man
[56:00] that was enticing
[56:04] he took his liberty and used it for
[56:07] himself
[56:10] liberty without doing god's will is
[56:13] still satanic
[56:15] it's the same thing as having power
[56:17] without character
[56:19] in the message things that are to be
[56:20] brother and says but when you come to a
[56:22] church into a church
[56:25] usually certainly a spiritual
[56:27] congregation it seems like there is you
[56:30] feel more at liberty
[56:33] like there's something the presence of
[56:34] the lord the presence of god is there
[56:36] you know it seems to be different
[56:41] because we're the spirit of the lord as
[56:42] there is liberty
[56:45] i've
[56:46] had so many ministers
[56:49] talk about the liberty and the love of
[56:52] god that they feel in this church
[56:55] for as many years as we've had a church
[57:01] and the way this atmosphere is created
[57:04] is very simple
[57:06] it's keeping god first
[57:10] keeping the flesh out keeping the will
[57:13] of men you cannot have a man run the
[57:15] church it's got to be the holy ghost
[57:21] and
[57:23] well if
[57:24] just one
[57:26] child acting wrong after a service is
[57:29] done can affect the next service
[57:34] god
[57:37] god is sensitive
[57:40] and and we've all been given
[57:43] a liberty
[57:46] and
[57:47] that liberty needs to be used only
[57:52] to serve god to do his will
[57:55] liberty is very dangerous in the hands
[57:57] of a carnal mind
[57:59] galatians 5 13 says for brethren you
[58:02] have been called unto liberty
[58:04] only use not liberty
[58:08] for an occasion to the flesh
[58:11] well then what in the world i do with it
[58:13] but by love serve one another that's
[58:17] what liberty's been given for
[58:23] so there's a wrong way to use liberty
[58:27] if you're going to use liberty that's
[58:28] been given to you to exalt yourself
[58:31] you're wrong
[58:34] any occasion to exalt yourself pride
[58:36] reputation your image
[58:39] you're absolutely 100 percent wrong
[58:45] when god gives you liberty
[58:47] by love
[58:48] serve the person
[58:50] serve them
[58:52] that's what the scripture tells us for
[58:54] all the laws fulfilled in one word even
[58:56] this that thou shall love thy neighbor
[58:58] as thyself
[59:01] so we've been given liberty to serve
[59:04] amen
[59:05] that's it
[59:06] the liberty from almighty god we're the
[59:09] spirit of the lord as there is liberty
[59:11] we've been given that liberty to serve
[59:13] amen to serve others it's not about us
[59:16] anymore it's not about us getting to do
[59:18] what we want to do
[59:20] it's about doing his will god gives us
[59:22] liberty to do his will
[59:26] because we've been given liberty do what
[59:28] we want doesn't mean
[59:29] we can do what we want
[59:34] we've been given when we've been given
[59:36] liberty always love all we serve always
[59:39] give always esteem others better than
[59:41] yourself
[59:42] always
[59:44] do the will of god
[59:46] amen
[59:48] if we could say at least brother adam
[59:49] said mission work is always in the will
[59:51] of god
[59:53] take your liberty
[59:54] [Laughter]
[59:57] do a missionary word
[1:00:00] well he didn't tell me where to go well
[1:00:02] just start walking go ye into all the
[1:00:04] earth
[1:00:06] right
[1:00:06] we got scripture
[1:00:08] always say something take your liberty
[1:00:10] when you got an opportunity to say
[1:00:12] something about somebody
[1:00:16] take your liberty to always say
[1:00:18] something good
[1:00:20] not your liberty well this is my opinion
[1:00:22] about the guy
[1:00:23] about the girl about the family about
[1:00:26] the child
[1:00:27] no
[1:00:28] your liberty is to say something good
[1:00:32] in the message adoption
[1:00:35] brother branham says oh jesus was
[1:00:37] training 12 men
[1:00:39] and those
[1:00:40] 12 men
[1:00:42] was to take the gospel to the world
[1:00:44] but jesus said for thy sake i sanctify
[1:00:48] myself
[1:00:50] for i'm sorry for their sake i sanctify
[1:00:53] myself and he's referring to
[1:00:55] um
[1:00:56] i believe saint john chapter 17
[1:01:00] continuing the quote make and here's
[1:01:02] brother bram talking to us make yourself
[1:01:05] for your neighbor's sake
[1:01:08] for for somebody else's sake
[1:01:10] don't use your liberty for a cloak
[1:01:15] said paul but sanctify yourself behave
[1:01:18] yourself in the neighborhood like a real
[1:01:20] christian ought to let your
[1:01:22] communications be if you meet your enemy
[1:01:24] sanctify yourself for his sake
[1:01:27] not knowing what you might do
[1:01:33] see this the liberty that god has given
[1:01:36] us is for others it's not for ourselves
[1:01:40] satan
[1:01:41] is the only one that offers you liberty
[1:01:43] to do what you want to do
[1:01:46] that's not what god gives us liberty for
[1:01:53] we often have liberty to do what we want
[1:01:55] to do
[1:01:59] but it doesn't mean
[1:02:01] for us to go do what we want to do with
[1:02:03] it
[1:02:04] there's such a responsibility that comes
[1:02:06] with that
[1:02:07] lord what do you want me to do
[1:02:11] what do you how do you want me to do it
[1:02:13] lord
[1:02:15] james chapter 4

[1:02:18] we've read this many times but just look
[1:02:21] about in in the light of of liberty here
[1:02:24] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[1:02:27] we're going to go into such a city and
[1:02:28] continue there a year and buy and sell
[1:02:30] and get gain whereas you know not with
[1:02:32] the tomorrow what shall be on the moral
[1:02:34] for what is your life it's even a vapor
[1:02:36] that appears for a little time and then
[1:02:37] vanished away for that ye ought to say
[1:02:40] it if the lord will
[1:02:43] we shall live we shall do this well
[1:02:45] that's the way it should be when you
[1:02:46] have liberty in church
[1:02:48] it's the same thing
[1:02:51] but he says now you're rejoicing you're
[1:02:53] you're
[1:02:54] but you rejoice in your boostings all
[1:02:56] such rejoicing is evil so you can take
[1:03:00] your liberty
[1:03:01] and rejoice with your liberty
[1:03:04] and it be absolutely wrong
[1:03:09] therefore to him that knoweth to do good
[1:03:12] and doeth it not
[1:03:14] to him that is sin
[1:03:21] even though jesus says set us free
[1:03:23] he has placed a yoke on us
[1:03:26] christians have a yoke
[1:03:28] we just can't do whatever we want
[1:03:30] matthew chapter 11 verse 28 come unto me
[1:03:33] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[1:03:36] and i will give you rest
[1:03:38] take my yoke upon you and he said learn
[1:03:41] of me
[1:03:44] for i'm meek and lowly in heart you
[1:03:46] shall find rest for your souls for my
[1:03:48] yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:03:52] so when he gives us liberty
[1:03:55] um we it
[1:03:57] doesn't mean we can do what we want to
[1:03:59] do because
[1:04:00] we still have a yoke
[1:04:03] it's it's not the yoke of the devil
[1:04:05] every time he tricks us into something
[1:04:07] he just drags us through the mud
[1:04:11] we pay for it dearly
[1:04:14] but we're told jesus is telling here to
[1:04:17] take
[1:04:18] god's joke it's a collar it's a harness
[1:04:22] it's it's being joined together
[1:04:26] with christ amen it's being coupled to
[1:04:29] him whatever the word says we just do it
[1:04:31] whatever he tells us to do however he
[1:04:33] tells us to serve we just do it that's
[1:04:35] what it means to be yoked
[1:04:41] we're not at liberty to do what we want
[1:04:43] to do anymore
[1:04:48] turn with me if you would to romans
[1:04:50] chapter 6.
[1:04:54] we've been set free but not just to do
[1:04:56] whatever we want
[1:04:58] right amen we've been set free to be a
[1:05:01] servant of christ
[1:05:03] romans chapter 6 verse 24 when he were
[1:05:06] the servants of sin okay out in the
[1:05:08] world
[1:05:09] do you know you were free from
[1:05:10] righteousness
[1:05:12] you didn't have to listen to anybody
[1:05:14] you could just do whatever you wanted to
[1:05:16] do
[1:05:19] because you're out in the world
[1:05:21] you were free i don't want to go to
[1:05:23] church and get tied down
[1:05:25] right you know how it was
[1:05:28] what fruit
[1:05:29] had ye then in those things where of
[1:05:32] your are now ashamed
[1:05:34] yeah every one of us are ashamed of the
[1:05:37] things that we did
[1:05:39] when we were serving sin or serving
[1:05:42] ourselves
[1:05:44] for the end of those things is death
[1:05:48] but now being made free from sin jesus
[1:05:50] set us free
[1:05:52] we've become now servants to god
[1:05:56] and you have your fruit unto holiness
[1:05:59] and to everlasting life so if i
[1:06:02] understand the scriptures we don't have
[1:06:05] liberty just to do what our whatever we
[1:06:07] want to do
[1:06:11] so when god says take your liberty
[1:06:14] what is he really offering
[1:06:16] you he's offering you an opportunity to
[1:06:20] do what he wants you to do amen that's
[1:06:24] right nothing more right
[1:06:27] nothing less
[1:06:29] it's it's a fearful thing
[1:06:33] christ is our example of liberty
[1:06:38] amen
[1:06:40] how come it's so quiet here
[1:06:44] turn with me if you would to philippians
[1:06:46] chapter 2.
[1:06:49] jesus took upon himself the father's
[1:06:52] yoke
[1:06:54] leaving us an example to take christ's
[1:06:57] yoke
[1:06:58] because he said take my yoke upon you
[1:07:01] so here it is verse 3 let nothing be
[1:07:03] done through strife or vain glory
[1:07:06] but in lowliness of mind let each esteem
[1:07:08] the other better than themselves when is
[1:07:10] the last time you esteem somebody better
[1:07:12] than you
[1:07:16] okay
[1:07:17] okay how about this question now when
[1:07:19] was the last time you wish somebody
[1:07:21] esteemed you
[1:07:24] see the difference right
[1:07:27] okay
[1:07:29] look not every man on his own things his
[1:07:32] own agenda this is what i want to
[1:07:33] accomplish
[1:07:35] but every man also on the things of
[1:07:37] others
[1:07:40] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:07:42] in christ jesus
[1:07:43] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:07:45] not robbery to be equal god or what
[1:07:47] yoked with god
[1:07:49] he was robbery to be connected to what
[1:07:52] the father's will was amen
[1:07:55] it shouldn't be robbery for us to be
[1:07:57] connected to christ
[1:07:59] what christ wants us to do
[1:08:05] but made himself of no i just want to
[1:08:08] say this
[1:08:09] here he was in the garden and and he
[1:08:11] wanted liberty to not go to calvary
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:18] and he had liberty not to go to calvary
[1:08:22] he could call for allegiance of angels
[1:08:24] if he wanted to
[1:08:26] but he surrendered
[1:08:28] he took the liberty that god gave him he
[1:08:31] surrendered his wealth not my will but
[1:08:34] your will be done father
[1:08:38] so he made himself of no reputation
[1:08:41] he took upon him the form of a servant
[1:08:44] and was made in the likeness of men and
[1:08:46] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:08:48] humbled himself and he became
[1:08:51] obedient
[1:08:53] so he was obedient but now he became
[1:08:56] obedient unto death
[1:08:58] and then he stretches it even to the
[1:09:01] death of the cross
[1:09:03] so i'm saying here we constantly have
[1:09:05] liberty but what do we do with it
[1:09:07] are we want liberty to do more what we
[1:09:09] want
[1:09:10] are we looking for liberty to serve god
[1:09:14] to do what he's called us to do
[1:09:19] very powerful
[1:09:22] to me it was powerful
[1:09:25] brother brahms speaking of satan's
[1:09:28] temptation to get jesus
[1:09:30] to take the kingdoms of the world
[1:09:31] without going to the cross here in a
[1:09:33] message how can i overcome he said if he
[1:09:36] did we'd be lost
[1:09:40] he could have took the kingdom
[1:09:43] he was tempted to do it now death
[1:09:46] is a hard thing he was tempted to take
[1:09:48] his liberty
[1:09:50] and be the king of the earth without the
[1:09:53] cross
[1:09:55] but
[1:09:56] if he did his subjects would have died
[1:10:00] and satan would have gladly made that
[1:10:02] proposition with him
[1:10:05] see satan wants us to take our liberty
[1:10:07] to do what we want to do
[1:10:10] because when that happens
[1:10:12] subjects are going to die
[1:10:17] because we're we're
[1:10:18] we're made we're always bearing about
[1:10:22] in our body the dying of the lord jesus
[1:10:24] why
[1:10:25] that the life of christ
[1:10:28] may be manifest that the will of god
[1:10:31] could be done and others could be helped
[1:10:33] and served
[1:10:35] it's no different
[1:10:39] liberty is not for our flesh
[1:10:42] it's to do the will of god that's what
[1:10:44] liberty's for
[1:10:46] if we want to take his yoke upon us we
[1:10:49] got to be joined to everything that this
[1:10:52] word says
[1:10:53] everything that god wants us to
[1:10:56] do where he was a servant
[1:11:00] we're become a servant where he loved we
[1:11:02] love where he forgave we forgive where
[1:11:05] he lay down his life we lay down our
[1:11:07] life where he became obedient we become
[1:11:10] obedient that's what the liberty is for
[1:11:15] because before you were in the liberty
[1:11:18] of god
[1:11:19] you couldn't do that
[1:11:22] you didn't want to do it
[1:11:24] you wanted to be number one
[1:11:28] you wouldn't settle for number two
[1:11:34] we become completely joined to christ
[1:11:37] the word that's the true liberty that
[1:11:39] god wants us to take
[1:11:42] so when we take our liberty
[1:11:45] we take our liberty
[1:11:47] in christ to do his will
[1:11:52] i'm going to go through a few scriptures
[1:11:54] here james chapter 1 verse 1
[1:11:56] james a servant
[1:11:59] of god
[1:12:00] and of the lord jesus christ
[1:12:04] to
[1:12:05] the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad
[1:12:08] so here's james he's a servant
[1:12:12] he's a servant of god
[1:12:14] but he's a servant to others
[1:12:17] when we think about servants of god we
[1:12:19] just think about oh wow there's a
[1:12:21] servant of god
[1:12:23] wow look god's using them
[1:12:26] what we ought to be thinking about is if
[1:12:28] we're a servant of god who are we
[1:12:29] serving
[1:12:34] here here james was a servant to the 12
[1:12:38] tribes that means he was serving the 12
[1:12:41] tribes
[1:12:43] he wasn't just writing them a letter
[1:12:45] he was serving them
[1:12:47] he wasn't just preaching them a sermon
[1:12:50] amen but he was servant
[1:12:52] jude chapter 1 verse 1
[1:12:54] jude the servant of jesus christ
[1:12:58] and the brother of james
[1:13:00] to what to them that are sanctified by
[1:13:04] god the father and preserving christ
[1:13:06] jesus
[1:13:08] in jesus christ and called so here he is
[1:13:11] jude is a servant
[1:13:16] he takes his liberty
[1:13:19] unto
[1:13:20] others
[1:13:22] to them that are sanctified those that
[1:13:24] are walking with christ
[1:13:28] ii peter chapter one verse one simon
[1:13:30] peter a servant and an apostle of jesus
[1:13:33] christ
[1:13:34] another servant to who
[1:13:38] to god
[1:13:39] to them
[1:13:41] that have obtained
[1:13:42] like precious
[1:13:44] faith with us through the righteousness
[1:13:47] of god and our savior jesus christ see
[1:13:50] we want to correlate
[1:13:53] being a servant to others
[1:13:59] liberty to help others
[1:14:02] that's what we've been given it for
[1:14:05] not for ourselves
[1:14:07] many places paul refers to himself as as
[1:14:11] as a servant not just of god
[1:14:14] but unto others
[1:14:16] first corinthians chapter 9 verse 19. if
[1:14:19] you want to write it down
[1:14:20] for though i be free from all men yet
[1:14:23] have i made myself a servant unto all
[1:14:27] that i might gain the more
[1:14:29] so here he was he's been set free
[1:14:33] he got clobbered on the way
[1:14:35] on the road to damascus god got his
[1:14:37] attention got kicked off his eye a horse
[1:14:41] a man laid his hands on him he received
[1:14:44] his sight received the holy ghost he was
[1:14:46] free
[1:14:47] he was free
[1:14:50] but now he took the liberty that he had
[1:14:54] and he subjected himself to the will of
[1:14:56] god amen
[1:14:58] and he became a servant to all
[1:15:01] that he might gain
[1:15:03] some
[1:15:06] verse 22 to the week became i is weak
[1:15:08] that i might gain the weak i made all
[1:15:10] things to all men that i might by all
[1:15:12] means save
[1:15:14] some
[1:15:16] you're not going to save everybody
[1:15:21] but if you subject if you take the
[1:15:23] liberty that god's given you
[1:15:26] and you serve others you will win some
[1:15:31] in the message a prisoner brother brahm
[1:15:34] says oh god sometimes
[1:15:36] sometimes god sometimes takes his people
[1:15:39] out like that and shaves a few of their
[1:15:41] own wills off
[1:15:45] shows them that they can't do just
[1:15:47] whatever they want to do
[1:15:49] you know what i mean
[1:15:50] they're not in liberty to do what they
[1:15:52] want to do
[1:15:54] before they could just they could come i
[1:15:57] said before they could come into the
[1:15:59] full power
[1:16:01] and be a love slave to christ they had
[1:16:04] to be shaved off and then presented
[1:16:07] sometimes he takes them to the desert to
[1:16:10] do
[1:16:11] that to shave them all
[1:16:15] sometimes we forget that the liberty
[1:16:17] that god has given us is not to be used
[1:16:19] for an occasion for our flesh
[1:16:21] you know the thing is the devil he's not
[1:16:23] going to blatantly put it right in front
[1:16:25] of us he's going to like kind of mix it
[1:16:26] in he's going to mix it in so you can't
[1:16:29] see it when motives get mixed objectives
[1:16:32] get mixed we can miss
[1:16:36] the purity of serving christ
[1:16:40] first corinthians chapter 6 verse 19
[1:16:42] what know ye not that that your body is
[1:16:45] the temple of the holy ghost which is in
[1:16:47] you which you have of god and you are
[1:16:49] not your own amen for you've been bought
[1:16:52] with a price
[1:16:54] when you think about that
[1:16:56] if i said i bought your car
[1:17:00] and i handed you the money that you
[1:17:02] wanted for your car
[1:17:05] and i drive the car away
[1:17:08] get the title you got the money you put
[1:17:10] it in the bank
[1:17:12] you can't change your mind
[1:17:16] you can't come over my house with the
[1:17:19] second set of keys that you didn't give
[1:17:21] me
[1:17:22] and take the car
[1:17:24] take the liberty
[1:17:26] you've been bought it's been bought
[1:17:31] we don't have liberty to do what we want
[1:17:32] to do that is so antichrist
[1:17:37] god's given us liberty to serve him amen
[1:17:43] for your bought with the price therefore
[1:17:45] glorify god in your body and your spirit
[1:17:47] which are god's
[1:17:49] we're all all of us here our servants of
[1:17:52] christ amen
[1:17:54] we've been called at liberty to what to
[1:17:57] serve one another
[1:17:59] no things don't have to be perfect
[1:18:01] to do that
[1:18:03] things don't have to be perfect with one
[1:18:05] another
[1:18:06] things don't have to be perfect with you
[1:18:09] i'll tell you how many times have we
[1:18:11] washed one another's feet
[1:18:13] and we haven't been perfect
[1:18:16] we still wash feet
[1:18:22] our liberty is to serve
[1:18:26] if we could just see
[1:18:28] the
[1:18:29] we have so much liberty here
[1:18:32] so much liberty
[1:18:34] to serve
[1:18:37] if we want liberty for something
[1:18:39] different than that it's probably not
[1:18:41] the place to be
[1:18:47] where the spirit of the lord is there's
[1:18:49] liberty what does christ do he serves
[1:18:50] every one of us
[1:18:52] we get up in the morning we say god
[1:18:54] thank you for this day
[1:18:56] his mercies are new each day we need
[1:18:58] mercies every day from god we need his
[1:19:00] grace we we need him
[1:19:03] he serves us
[1:19:07] it doesn't do anything god is good he
[1:19:08] doesn't do anything
[1:19:10] ill
[1:19:12] that's why love worketh no ill to its
[1:19:14] neighbors no matter if we think they
[1:19:16] deserve it or not
[1:19:18] maybe they do deserve it but you know
[1:19:20] what so do i so do you
[1:19:22] we all deserve it
[1:19:24] we all deserve ill we all deserve to die
[1:19:28] we all deserve not to have the grace of
[1:19:30] god
[1:19:33] but god has called us to liberty
[1:19:37] to serve one another amen to serve one
[1:19:40] another find something somehow some way
[1:19:44] to serve someone
[1:19:45] amen
[1:19:47] take his yoke
[1:19:48] the word
[1:19:50] it's your absolute let it teach you how
[1:19:53] to serve
[1:19:55] because i tell you what i feel we need
[1:19:58] some learning how to serve
[1:20:01] i'm not pointing any fingers but i'm
[1:20:03] just being honest with you
[1:20:05] um
[1:20:06] how many uh let me see how many
[1:20:09] how many likes eggs
[1:20:12] all right which way do you like your
[1:20:14] eggs
[1:20:15] scrambled
[1:20:28] yeah
[1:20:29] good good yes boiled that's a good one
[1:20:33] that's a good one
[1:20:36] dry okay yeah
[1:20:38] the runny can kind of be gooey
[1:20:41] so so now let me just say like this you
[1:20:43] said you like them scrambled right
[1:20:47] what if i gave it to you gooey
[1:20:50] what if i give it to you over easy
[1:20:52] okay so now we're just take one of us
[1:20:55] and
[1:20:56] one of us likes
[1:20:58] the egg just like this
[1:21:02] after a while it's just like i get i'm
[1:21:04] getting tired of eggs
[1:21:07] i think my daughter took a chef class
[1:21:09] and she learned that there was over 100
[1:21:11] ways to cook an egg which i cannot
[1:21:14] believe it there's a hundred ways to
[1:21:16] cook an egg
[1:21:17] because i'm just one you know two or
[1:21:18] three at the most with me
[1:21:21] you know
[1:21:23] the thing is
[1:21:25] we think
[1:21:26] what can i do to serve i just i'm
[1:21:28] running out of things to do to serve
[1:21:32] that's why i think we need to spend time
[1:21:34] studying the word with this motive lord
[1:21:36] show me how i can serve the body
[1:21:39] show me how i can serve because there
[1:21:41] are other ways
[1:21:44] ii timothy chapter 2 verse 24 second
[1:21:47] timothy chapter 2 verse 24 and the
[1:21:49] servant of god must not strive
[1:21:55] but be gentle
[1:21:57] unto all men
[1:21:59] an apt to teach
[1:22:01] patient i'll say like this every parent
[1:22:04] needs somehow
[1:22:05] has to have some ability to teach their
[1:22:07] child
[1:22:09] so everybody
[1:22:10] can do this
[1:22:12] we can learn how to help one another
[1:22:17] in meekness instructing those
[1:22:20] that oppose themselves
[1:22:23] if god pre-eventually give them
[1:22:26] repentance to acknowledging of the truth
[1:22:29] that there may be recover themselves out
[1:22:31] of the snare of the devil who have taken
[1:22:32] them captive
[1:22:34] at
[1:22:35] his his will
[1:22:38] so god wants us to take his yoke upon us
[1:22:41] and learn of him
[1:22:43] learn how we can take this great liberty
[1:22:46] that we have and not just miss church
[1:22:48] where we want to miss church
[1:22:51] not just not pay any offering because we
[1:22:53] don't feel like paying any offerings
[1:22:56] did you know
[1:22:58] august was the first month that we
[1:23:00] didn't have enough money to pay rent
[1:23:05] did you know we only got a hundred
[1:23:07] dollar off 100 came in for brother when
[1:23:10] brother aaron was here with all the
[1:23:11] services
[1:23:13] did you know we didn't have one dollar
[1:23:16] come in that back for brother
[1:23:19] george smith
[1:23:23] we take our liberty and we do what we
[1:23:25] want but the liberty that god has given
[1:23:28] us
[1:23:30] is to do his will amen
[1:23:33] so it's something that we should think
[1:23:35] about this great liberty that god's
[1:23:37] given us
[1:23:40] is to serve him
[1:23:45] and and
[1:23:47] we just spend some time lord show me
[1:23:50] teach me show me
[1:23:52] now i wanna i wanna help my body i wanna
[1:23:54] help my brother wanna help my sister
[1:23:58] we had
[1:24:01] one brother in the church give an
[1:24:02] offering straight to brother george
[1:24:04] smith
[1:24:06] but nothing came into the box
[1:24:10] but we still have to give out the money
[1:24:12] right we sell the plane tickets and and
[1:24:15] those things
[1:24:16] and we don't pump for money here but i'm
[1:24:18] just being honest with you
[1:24:21] it's part of business
[1:24:22] i mean the prophet said no
[1:24:25] service is complete
[1:24:28] without an offering
[1:24:30] and it just is something to pray about
[1:24:33] something to pray about
[1:24:35] are you with me
[1:24:39] god's given us liberty for what to serve
[1:24:41] one another
[1:24:43] eternal life is living for you talk
[1:24:45] about liberty
[1:24:46] eternal life is liberty
[1:24:49] to serve one another
[1:24:54] now even though that we've been set free
[1:24:56] by the blood of christ
[1:24:59] and by the word of god
[1:25:01] satan will not stop trying to bring us
[1:25:04] back into bondage
[1:25:05] that's true
[1:25:07] he will keep enticing us
[1:25:09] and he'll keep trying to give us what
[1:25:11] our flesh wants
[1:25:13] because
[1:25:15] what we want in our flesh brings us into
[1:25:17] bondage
[1:25:20] saint wants you to use your liberty for
[1:25:22] your flesh your personal agenda your
[1:25:24] purposes your reputation
[1:25:26] anything that isn't of god is going to
[1:25:29] bring us back into bondage
[1:25:30] amen how do people backslide
[1:25:34] how do people lose their joy
[1:25:37] how do people
[1:25:39] get away from god
[1:25:42] god never leaves anybody
[1:25:45] everybody leaves god
[1:25:47] and we find god where we go
[1:25:50] where we left him the prophet taught us
[1:25:52] galatians chapter 5 verse 1 stand fast
[1:25:55] therefore in the liberty where we're
[1:25:58] with christ have made us free amen and
[1:26:03] be not uh entangled again with the yoke
[1:26:06] abundance that's telling me that i can
[1:26:08] get in bondage again
[1:26:11] we need to take the the liberty that god
[1:26:13] has given us and put on the whole armor
[1:26:16] of god
[1:26:17] that we may be able to stand against the
[1:26:18] wiles of the devil because he's
[1:26:21] constantly working through this laodicea
[1:26:23] spirit to keep giving us what we want
[1:26:26] to keep taking liberty in our flesh
[1:26:32] when the children of israel
[1:26:34] were liberated and set free
[1:26:38] came out of egypt and they were dancing
[1:26:40] you know what they did they took their
[1:26:41] liberty
[1:26:42] to do their own will
[1:26:45] they began to murmur complain they
[1:26:48] wanted different leadership
[1:26:52] and they took liberty
[1:26:54] they talked about it
[1:26:58] and it spread like a poison like a
[1:26:59] cancer
[1:27:04] they took the liberty that god had given
[1:27:07] them and said
[1:27:09] i don't need to really press into the
[1:27:11] promised land
[1:27:14] i'm satisfied with just going to church
[1:27:18] and god said you need to continue in the
[1:27:20] word
[1:27:23] you got to take possession
[1:27:26] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:27:27] shall make you free
[1:27:29] i'm looking for more freedom in myself
[1:27:34] i hate this old man
[1:27:36] and i mean that he may think i'm saying
[1:27:38] oh man cause i'm an old man which is you
[1:27:40] know probably true
[1:27:41] but it's still an old man at any age
[1:27:44] right it's an old man to any age
[1:27:47] uh he's
[1:27:49] he needs to die daily there's no remedy
[1:27:51] that you know you kill him once and you
[1:27:53] don't have to worry about in the rest of
[1:27:54] your christian walk
[1:27:55] he gets up every day
[1:27:57] hoping to get the edge on you
[1:28:02] all right in the message greatest bet
[1:28:04] over fault
[1:28:05] brother brandon said the greatest battle
[1:28:07] ever fault she is going on right now
[1:28:09] going on right in here now yes sir
[1:28:12] between life and death between sickness
[1:28:15] and health between faith and doubt all
[1:28:18] my oh my
[1:28:20] between
[1:28:21] liberty and bondage
[1:28:25] he said the battle is on shine your
[1:28:27] spear soldiers polish your armor
[1:28:30] god is getting his soldiers ready
[1:28:33] amen god anoints his army
[1:28:38] so we're in a battle
[1:28:40] and the devil is going to constantly be
[1:28:42] trying to get you your mind off of
[1:28:45] taking the liberty that you have to
[1:28:47] serve one another
[1:28:49] he's going to try to get you anytime
[1:28:52] that you can judge somebody
[1:28:54] oh you're no longer serving you become a
[1:28:57] judge
[1:28:58] so he's won the victory there you're not
[1:29:00] going to serve anybody when you're
[1:29:01] judging him
[1:29:05] when you've been given liberty always
[1:29:07] use it to serve
[1:29:10] serve the one who's given you the
[1:29:12] liberty
[1:29:14] if your boss
[1:29:15] gives you a bonus gives you a raise
[1:29:18] serve them a little bit more be grateful
[1:29:20] show it
[1:29:22] god gives you liberty serve them
[1:29:26] take the liberty that god has given you
[1:29:28] and serve him with it
[1:29:34] don't do what satan did he used his
[1:29:36] liberty for himself i will
[1:29:39] don't use your liberty for an
[1:29:41] opportunity just
[1:29:43] to keep building your life
[1:29:46] your own life
[1:29:47] let god build your life
[1:29:49] you just do what he told you he told you
[1:29:51] to seek first the kingdom
[1:29:53] and his righteousness and he'll do all
[1:29:55] the building
[1:29:57] he'll build your life
[1:29:58] he'll add it one thing at a time
[1:30:02] we always want liberty to do what we
[1:30:04] want
[1:30:06] but sometimes
[1:30:07] it disagrees
[1:30:09] with the liberty that somebody else
[1:30:11] wants
[1:30:14] right
[1:30:15] everybody wants liberty to do what they
[1:30:16] want but sometimes the liberty they want
[1:30:20] disagrees with the liberty that somebody
[1:30:22] else wants
[1:30:23] and this would be a typical thing in the
[1:30:25] marriage
[1:30:26] well i think well i think
[1:30:28] well i wear the pants and whatever
[1:30:34] you take the uh
[1:30:36] the arab nations they're always fighting
[1:30:38] against one another they want liberty to
[1:30:40] do what they want
[1:30:42] but if it disagrees with them they'll
[1:30:44] fight for it
[1:30:47] and this is the the the the scary thing
[1:30:50] about wanting liberty
[1:30:53] it may disagree with somebody else's
[1:30:55] liberty
[1:30:56] and then what do you got
[1:30:59] but if you take the liberty that god's
[1:31:00] given you and serve
[1:31:03] by love serve one another
[1:31:06] you'll never be lacking
[1:31:08] for accomplishment
[1:31:10] you'll never
[1:31:11] be lacking for accomplishment
[1:31:14] because you've got your agenda out of
[1:31:16] there
[1:31:17] it's all about god's agenda
[1:31:21] but when there's when there's a
[1:31:24] your liberty and somebody else's liberty
[1:31:25] there's a there's a disagreement that's
[1:31:27] why we have church
[1:31:28] order right god is not the altar of
[1:31:31] confusion
[1:31:33] that's why the bible says the spirit of
[1:31:34] the prophets is subject to the prophets
[1:31:37] that's why we must endeavor to keep the
[1:31:39] unity of the spirit and the bond of
[1:31:41] peace
[1:31:42] there's one body one spirit even as
[1:31:44] you're called into one hope if you're
[1:31:45] calling one lord one faith
[1:31:47] one
[1:31:49] so there needs to be unity
[1:31:52] where the spirit of the lord is there is
[1:31:54] liberty
[1:31:56] there's freedom
[1:31:58] and it's not to do what we want
[1:32:00] but it's simply to do what he wants us
[1:32:02] to do now here's the problem
[1:32:05] everybody that wants liberty
[1:32:07] thinks that what they're wanting is
[1:32:09] exactly what god wants
[1:32:13] the music you listen to you think that's
[1:32:15] the music god likes
[1:32:21] in reality every man's right in his own
[1:32:23] eyes
[1:32:24] so we can't go by that
[1:32:27] if we feel something should be different
[1:32:32] we pray
[1:32:34] that's always a powerful weapon
[1:32:37] we pray
[1:32:38] we look at we all think we none of us
[1:32:41] want sickness in our church
[1:32:43] but we can't force it god to change it
[1:32:48] we can't
[1:32:49] we can't demand it
[1:32:51] from god
[1:32:53] all we do is we
[1:32:54] we pray to god
[1:32:56] we take our position in the word
[1:32:59] we lay claims
[1:33:01] promises
[1:33:03] but you can't force
[1:33:05] healing
[1:33:07] so why do you think you can force
[1:33:08] anything else
[1:33:10] you understand i'm saying you've got to
[1:33:12] place things in the hands of god
[1:33:15] but now if you want to see any what can
[1:33:17] you do well you could just keep praying
[1:33:18] keep fasting keep calling on god keep
[1:33:21] believing keep trusting
[1:33:23] the same is for every other need in the
[1:33:26] church
[1:33:28] that's how you
[1:33:31] accomplish seeing god having his way in
[1:33:33] the church
[1:33:38] in the message questions and answers
[1:33:40] number three
[1:33:41] the question came what does paul mean
[1:33:45] by freedom and liberty in christ
[1:33:48] what way is freedom from law
[1:33:52] brother bran says well
[1:33:54] you're not bound by the law say for
[1:33:56] instance here's the same thing i'll
[1:33:58] explain it
[1:34:00] in the natural way quickly for instance
[1:34:03] out here it says go down the street 30
[1:34:07] miles per hour
[1:34:10] is all the faster you can go alright now
[1:34:12] if i go down the street 40 miles per
[1:34:14] hour
[1:34:16] i'm condemned by the law
[1:34:20] he says i'm condemned by the law
[1:34:23] but if i go down the street just 30
[1:34:26] miles an hour
[1:34:28] i'm not under the law see
[1:34:30] that's freedom in christ
[1:34:32] the same
[1:34:34] thing
[1:34:36] you still have to do what the word says
[1:34:41] it's just you're not condemned
[1:34:45] he says you're not bound by the law as
[1:34:48] long as i
[1:34:49] as i don't steal
[1:34:51] as i don't lie smoke commit adultery any
[1:34:53] of these things i'm ba i'm not bound by
[1:34:56] no law see i'm free from the law i'm in
[1:35:00] christ
[1:35:01] well i used to hear brother i don't i i
[1:35:04] don't know where it came from and i i
[1:35:06] don't know if it
[1:35:08] it came from brother ray lanning or not
[1:35:09] but i remember him years ago
[1:35:12] he would say i smoke all that i want
[1:35:15] i drink all that i want
[1:35:18] he says i just don't want to
[1:35:21] so i don't do it
[1:35:24] and
[1:35:25] if you abide by the word you're in the
[1:35:28] perfect law of liberty
[1:35:33] galatians 5 verse 22 we're closing very
[1:35:35] quickly
[1:35:38] galatians 5 22 but the fruit of the
[1:35:40] spirit is love
[1:35:41] joy
[1:35:42] peace longsuffering gentleness goodness
[1:35:46] faith meekness temperance look at this
[1:35:48] against such
[1:35:50] there is no law
[1:35:55] when you are in the spirit when you are
[1:35:58] in
[1:35:59] the when you have
[1:36:02] the liberty
[1:36:04] to love
[1:36:05] your enemy
[1:36:09] to to be long-suffering to be to be
[1:36:11] gentle to be good
[1:36:14] and you abide
[1:36:16] in that
[1:36:20] there is no law against you
[1:36:22] but as soon as you step out
[1:36:25] i don't i'm not gonna love him
[1:36:28] i'm not gonna i don't need to be long
[1:36:30] suffering
[1:36:33] now
[1:36:35] that law
[1:36:37] is over you and you're condemned
[1:36:42] liberty has been given to us to stay
[1:36:44] within the word
[1:36:48] not to do what we want to do and say
[1:36:50] this is the reason for it
[1:36:52] that's not true liberty
[1:36:54] because he that is that the son is set
[1:36:56] free he's really free indeed he can love
[1:36:59] his enemy he's not tied down by some
[1:37:01] hatred
[1:37:03] are you with me
[1:37:05] all right this is the last quote and i'm
[1:37:06] stopping
[1:37:10] this is in the mighty conquer and
[1:37:11] brother graham's talking about arnold
[1:37:13] van winkled
[1:37:16] remember there that the whole
[1:37:18] switzerland was
[1:37:20] being under attacked
[1:37:23] and they said arnold von
[1:37:25] winkle red sorry i can't pronounce his
[1:37:28] name what can you do against such a
[1:37:30] great host coming on
[1:37:32] he said just beyond the mountains i've
[1:37:35] kissed goodbye my wife my three children
[1:37:38] and there's a little
[1:37:39] white house and they're standing in the
[1:37:41] door to watch me come home but
[1:37:44] said i'll never see them
[1:37:46] again in this earth for today i give my
[1:37:50] life for switzerland
[1:37:52] and it's right
[1:37:54] they said what will you do mr arnold von
[1:37:58] wrinklered
[1:38:00] kind of like spoil the story because i
[1:38:02] don't want to say his name
[1:38:06] so you just have to bear with me
[1:38:08] i should just call mr arnold
[1:38:10] he said you just follow me and whatever
[1:38:14] you've got to fight with fight with all
[1:38:17] that's in you
[1:38:19] and they said what will you do
[1:38:23] now he had liberty
[1:38:25] he had liberty to do what he wanted to
[1:38:26] do
[1:38:27] and he threw down what he had in his
[1:38:30] hand
[1:38:31] and he seen the great army coming on and
[1:38:33] he looked
[1:38:35] it all over until he found the very
[1:38:38] thickest of spears
[1:38:40] and as the story goes he raised his
[1:38:43] hands
[1:38:45] and took right towards the midst of the
[1:38:47] spear screaming
[1:38:49] make way for liberty
[1:38:52] and he screamed again make way for
[1:38:54] liberty
[1:38:56] and he ran into
[1:38:58] those hundred spears to catch him
[1:39:02] and he threw
[1:39:03] his
[1:39:04] uh his
[1:39:05] arms and got all a whole armload of them
[1:39:08] and plunged them into his chest
[1:39:11] such a display of heroism
[1:39:14] it routed the army and those little
[1:39:16] swiss men with their sticks and stones
[1:39:19] and sickle blades
[1:39:21] routed that army out of their territory
[1:39:24] and they haven't had a war since
[1:39:28] make way
[1:39:29] for liberty
[1:39:31] do you want liberty
[1:39:33] more liberty

[1:39:39] give
[1:39:41] that will bring the presence of god

[1:41:59] to do the father's will
