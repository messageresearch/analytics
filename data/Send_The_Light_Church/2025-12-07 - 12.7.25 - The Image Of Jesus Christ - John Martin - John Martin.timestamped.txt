[17:19] Amen. Hallelujah. Are you looking for
[17:22] that day? Hallelujah.
[17:25] You know, we need to look. We need to be
[17:27] looking forward to something because if
[17:31] you're not, then you don't have a
[17:32] vision.
[17:35] There is coming [singing] a day when no
[17:40] heartache
[17:42] shall come. No more clouds in the sky.
[17:47] No more tears that dim the eye. All is
[17:52] peace forever more on that happy golden
[17:57] shore. What a day, a glorious day that
[18:03] will be. Hallelujah.
[18:06] What a day that will be when my Jesus I
[18:12] shall see. When I look upon his face,
[18:17] the one who saved me by his grace. When
[18:22] he takes me by the hand and leads me
[18:26] through the promised land, what a day, a
[18:31] glorious day that will be.
[18:36] There'll be no sorrow there. No more
[18:41] burdens
[18:42] to bear. No more sickness, no pain, no
[18:48] more parting over there. And forever I
[18:54] will be when the one who died for me.
[18:59] What a day, a glorious day that will be.
[19:06] What a day that will be. When my Jesus I
[19:12] shall see. When I look upon his face,
[19:17] the one who saved me by his grace. When
[19:21] he takes [singing]
[19:22] me by the hand and leads me through the
[19:26] promised land. What a day, a glorious
[19:30] day that will be. Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:36] Hallelujah. What a day that will be.
[19:40] You know, we work all our life to save
[19:43] enough money to retire, but we also work
[19:47] all our life for the Lord to get the
[19:51] reward.
[19:55] What a day it will be. Amen. Let's just

[22:32] forever. So we come with our our triumph
[22:36] this morning
[22:38] believing the word of God for our lives.
[22:41] Amen. Um
[22:44] this morning, brother Ron had just made
[22:46] mention about that we need to have a
[22:49] some vision that we're looking forward
[22:51] to. And um
[22:55] I pray that this service this morning
[22:57] would help us to see our vision that we
[22:59] need for the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[23:03] It's good to see everyone here this
[23:06] morning and weathering uh our maybe not
[23:11] the best roads and
[23:13] maybe circumstances at home or maybe our
[23:16] health and you you pressed in. God bless
[23:19] you for that. And my prayer is that you
[23:22] would really truly receive something
[23:24] from Jesus Christ. Amen. That's why
[23:27] we're here is to to meet with him and to
[23:29] receive from him. Let's look to the Lord
[23:32] in a word of prayer. We'll get into the
[23:34] word.
[23:36] Father, Lord,
[23:39] creator of heaven and earth.
[23:43] We know who we are approaching when we
[23:46] come to you in prayer.
[23:48] And Lord, we're we're unworthy.
[23:53] We pray Lord that your blood would cover
[23:55] us our sins.
[23:58] Lord, we want to set aside the flesh at
[24:01] this time and we want to yield our
[24:04] spirit and our souls to you.
[24:08] We pray, Lord, that you'd remove every
[24:11] every doubt, every unbelief, anything
[24:13] that would stand in the way from us
[24:15] hearing your voice,
[24:18] knock it on our heart, and then from us
[24:20] saying, "Yes, Lord, we want to walk with
[24:22] you in this light."
[24:25] We pray Lord that you would bless each
[24:28] one of us now with ears to hear and a
[24:32] revelation
[24:34] uh to uh see your church built inside of
[24:38] our lives that we might become more in
[24:40] your image. pray that you would be with
[24:43] these that are sick and afflicted, those
[24:46] that could not make it, Lord, those that
[24:49] are have uh needs, Lord, that only you
[24:54] are capable of meeting. We pray that you
[24:57] would stretch forth your mighty hand in
[25:00] their behalf, Lord, that they may have
[25:03] victory. We pray. Bless us now, Lord, as
[25:07] we enter into the word. May we all feel
[25:09] your presence, feel you stalking to us
[25:12] as if we were the only one in the
[25:15] service with you. We love you and we
[25:17] thank you for these things now. We give
[25:19] you praise and honor in Jesus Christ's
[25:21] name. Amen.
[25:24] Amen. God bless you. Let's turn in our
[25:26] Bibles to the book of Hebrews.
[25:35] I was going to try to um administer with
[25:40] the brace off today, but I got a
[25:43] doctor's appointment tomorrow. I'm going
[25:45] to see
[25:47] what he'll let me do because I know I'm
[25:49] cheating a little bit already.
[25:51] Brother, Brother Marty's
[25:55] correcting me and I need that
[25:59] first three verses here in the book of
[26:01] Hebrews chapter 1.
[26:03] God, who in at sunder times and in
[26:05] diverse manner spake in time past unto
[26:09] the fathers by the prophets, have in
[26:13] these last days spoken unto us by his
[26:16] son, whom he hath appointed heir of all
[26:22] things, by whom also he made the worlds,
[26:28] who being in the brightness
[26:31] of God's glory,
[26:33] and in the express image of God's person
[26:38] and upholding all things by the word of
[26:41] his power
[26:43] when he had made himself purged our sins
[26:46] when he him had by himself purged our
[26:51] sins sat down at the right hand of the
[26:53] majesty on high. Amen. God bless you.
[26:57] You may be seated. May God add the
[27:00] blessings to the reading of the word
[27:02] today.
[27:03] For Jesus Christ is the very same image
[27:09] of our heavenly father.
[27:12] For Jesus, the Bible says, is the
[27:14] express image of God's person. We want
[27:18] to put a title to this, the image of
[27:21] Jesus Christ.
[27:23] So, we just want to focus on, you know,
[27:26] we've been blessed to really understand
[27:28] the Godhead.
[27:30] And without this message, I don't think
[27:33] we we thoroughly could because there's
[27:35] so many scriptures in the Bible that it
[27:37] makes it look like there's two gods or
[27:40] there's a, you know, a higher God and a
[27:42] lesser God and somehow one created all
[27:45] things even though he wasn't born yet. I
[27:49] mean it can really become confusing
[27:52] but when we uh have a revelation from
[27:56] above we take the word for what it says
[28:00] that they are one and we got scripture
[28:03] for that. We kind of want to go through
[28:05] that and so we're going to go kind of
[28:07] speedy lay a foundation here. Colossians
[28:10] 1 chapter 13 says, "God has delivered us
[28:14] from the power of darkness and has
[28:17] translated us into the kingdom of his
[28:20] dear son in whom we have redemption
[28:23] through his blood and forgiveness of
[28:25] sins who is in who is the image of the
[28:30] invisible God, the firstborn of every
[28:34] creature." The image.
[28:37] Now, if I was to ask you to pull out
[28:40] your driver's license, on that there
[28:41] would be a picture of you. That picture
[28:45] would be the image of who you are in in
[28:49] picture form. But we understand in this
[28:53] image, we're referring to the very
[28:55] nature of God, the invisible God,
[28:59] &gt;&gt; who was seen in Jesus Christ. And the
[29:02] Bible says, "For by him all things were
[29:04] all things were all things created that
[29:06] are in heaven, that are earth, visible
[29:08] and invisible, whether there be thrones
[29:10] or dominions, principalities, powers,
[29:12] all things were created by him and for
[29:14] him. And he is before all things. And by
[29:17] him all things consist." It's like we
[29:19] can't live without God.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; And he is the head of the body, the
[29:24] church, which is us. He's our head. who
[29:27] is the beginning, the firstborn from the
[29:29] dead, that in all things he wants to
[29:31] have the preeminence. We can't get away
[29:34] from it. He has to have the preeminence
[29:35] in our life. For it pleased the father
[29:38] that in Jesus Christ should all fullness
[29:42] dwell.
[29:43] Showing again that he is the very image
[29:46] of God. If we want to know who God
[29:49] really is, we won't find him outside of
[29:52] Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ expresses who
[29:55] really the invisible God is.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; 1 Timothy 3:16, for without controversy,
[30:01] great is the mystery of godliness. God
[30:05] was manifested in the flesh.
[30:12] Not he birthed a child.
[30:16] You know, you think about this. We have
[30:18] children. They don't always reflect us.
[30:23] In fact, have you ever said, "Well,
[30:24] you're you're just like your dad." And
[30:27] the dad would say, "You're" the father
[30:28] would say, "You're just like your
[30:29] mother." You understand what I'm saying?
[30:31] You're pulling out certain things.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; And it a it isn't what God did. He
[30:38] didn't just birth something that wasn't
[30:40] him.
[30:42] He birthed he he manifested himself in
[30:45] the flesh. It was different person.
[30:50] That's why the because you can't
[30:52] reproduce God if we get time into it.
[30:54] You can't you can't God can't have as it
[30:58] were a an offspring of difference than
[31:01] him.
[31:03] That's why the Jews and the Pharisees
[31:05] had a a hard time accepting that he was
[31:07] the son of God. That that he was they
[31:09] didn't understand it. But as we get into
[31:13] it, um I hope and trust that you'll
[31:16] catch what I'm saying. But the bottom
[31:19] line is that God manifested himself in a
[31:22] body.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; It it wasn't different. It wasn't like
[31:26] he had a million different sperm cells
[31:29] and one came out and it was Jesus
[31:30] Christ. It wasn't like that.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; It it isn't like that. It was God
[31:35] himself. And that's why we can have
[31:36] confidence when we read the scriptures.
[31:38] What Jesus said, it was the word of God.
[31:45] justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
[31:46] preached unto the Gentiles, believed on
[31:48] in the world, and received up into
[31:50] glory. All right. First John, not first
[31:52] John, but St. John chapter one. In the
[31:54] beginning was the word, and the word was
[31:56] with God, and the word was God. Now,
[31:58] that word word really means Jesus
[32:01] Christ,
[32:02] &gt;&gt; which is the word of God.
[32:05] And verse 14, and the word was made
[32:08] flesh, and it dwelt among us, and we
[32:11] beheld his glory, the glory of the one
[32:14] and only begotten of the father, full of
[32:16] grace and in [snorts] truth. Just just
[32:18] laying some scriptural foundations that
[32:22] uh God and Jesus are the same. St. John
[32:25] 3:16, we all know this scripture. For
[32:28] God so loved the world that he gave his
[32:30] only begotten son that whosoever
[32:33] believeth in him should not perish but
[32:35] have everlasting life. I believe that
[32:38] Isaiah chapter 9:6 kind of interprets
[32:42] the the fullness of what it means the
[32:44] only begotten son here it says in Isaiah
[32:47] 9:6 for unto us a child is born unto us
[32:51] a son is given and the government shall
[32:55] be upon his shoulders and his name shall
[32:57] be called wonderful counselor the mighty
[33:00] God
[33:02] this son shall be called the everlasting
[33:05] father okay we don't got the scriptures
[33:06] up there. You just you just have to
[33:08] write him down. The prince of peace.
[33:11] Notice this son is called the
[33:13] everlasting father.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Not the everlasting son, the everlasting
[33:20] father. And he's also the prince of
[33:23] peace.
[33:24] All right. John chapter 10. If you want
[33:27] to turn there real quick, if you got
[33:28] your Bibles, since we we don't have them
[33:30] up on the screen where you just you
[33:32] don't want to take my word for it, you
[33:34] just you read it. You know, you can
[33:36] actually retain more when you read and
[33:37] listen at the same time.
[33:41] But here Jesus is talking in St. John
[33:43] chapter 10 in verse number 30. He says,
[33:45] "I and my father are one."
[33:50] Then the Jews took up stones again to
[33:52] stone him. And Jesus answered them,
[33:55] "Many good works have I showed you from
[33:57] my father. For which of those works do
[34:00] you want to stone me?" And the Jews
[34:02] answered and said, "For a good work. We
[34:05] don't want to stone you. But because you
[34:08] blaspheme
[34:10] that you being a man, you make yourself
[34:12] God." That was their hangup. They They
[34:16] could not see God because of the veil of
[34:18] flesh,
[34:19] &gt;&gt; right? He bled, he sweated, he had
[34:21] headaches. He was just a human being in
[34:24] their sight.
[34:26] But shows that God can live inside of a
[34:29] human flesh.
[34:32] And Jesus answered them, "Is it not
[34:34] written in your law, I said, you are
[34:38] gods?
[34:40] If he called them gods, unto whom the
[34:42] word of God came and the scripture
[34:44] cannot be broken, say ye of him whom the
[34:47] father hath sanctified and said into the
[34:49] world, speaking of himself, thou
[34:50] blasphemist, because I said I am the son
[34:54] of God." Question. If I do not the works
[34:57] of my father, then don't believe me.
[35:01] But if I do, though ye believe not me,
[35:05] because I'm human and I say I'm God,
[35:07] believe me for the works.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; That you may know and believe that the
[35:12] father is in me and I in him. So it's
[35:15] important to pay attention to works.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Works is a person's life. It is not what
[35:23] they say because Jesus is making an in
[35:26] clear indication here. Do not believe me
[35:28] for what I'm saying.
[35:30] Believe me, for the works that I
[35:31] produce,
[35:33] &gt;&gt; it's it's the life that we live that
[35:36] shows what's on the inside.
[35:39] Can you say amen to that?
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus said by their fruit.
[35:45] You should know them.
[35:49] Therefore, they saw it again. Verse 20
[35:52] 39, therefore they saw it again to take
[35:54] him, but he escaped out of their hand.
[35:57] [laughter]
[35:59] uh just kind of gives you a little
[36:00] picture of what was going on there.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the express image of the
[36:07] invisible God. I'm so glad that we can
[36:09] know God.
[36:11] John 14, if you want to turn there,
[36:14] we'll read some scriptures there. John
[36:16] 14, uh chapter 8. I'll give you some
[36:19] time to get your Bibles and open your
[36:21] Bibles to John 14. John 14.
[36:25] Yes, we must take our time and
[36:28] can't rely on the screens.
[36:32] You know, remember there was a day where
[36:34] they didn't have screens
[36:37] and there they were just flat wooden
[36:39] benches and
[36:41] no glass in the windows and the air was
[36:44] going through and you were happy to
[36:46] gather together in that in that room and
[36:49] &gt;&gt; feel the presence of God.
[36:52] John 14:8 says, "Philip saith unto him,
[36:55] Lord, show us the Father,
[36:59] and we'll be satisfied."
[37:02] And Jesus saith unto him, "Have I been
[37:06] so long a time with you, and yet thou
[37:09] has not known me, Philillip?
[37:13] He that have seen me has seen the
[37:16] father.
[37:19] Showing that he is the express image of
[37:22] the invisible God.
[37:25] Jesus Christ is the express image of the
[37:28] invisible God. God made himself known
[37:31] through Jesus Christ. And if you want to
[37:34] know God,
[37:36] you'll have to know God through the life
[37:38] that was manifested through Jesus
[37:40] Christ. It can't be through us figuring
[37:43] out books, reading books, listening to
[37:44] other people's opinions.
[37:47] We we got to ourselves getting to know
[37:49] who Jesus Christ is. Jesus said, "No man
[37:53] can come to the father but by me.
[37:57] He is the way to understand who God is."
[38:02] Jesus said upon this rock, this rock
[38:04] where the father reveals to us who Jesus
[38:09] Christ is that he will build his church.
[38:14] All right. Verse 10. St. John 14:10.
[38:17] Believest thou not that I am in the
[38:19] father and the father in me? Question
[38:22] mark.
[38:24] The words that I speak unto you, I speak
[38:26] not to myself, but the father that
[38:28] dwelleth in me. He doeth the works.
[38:32] believe me and that believe me that I am
[38:35] in the father and the father in me or
[38:37] else believe me for the very work's
[38:39] sake. So here he goes is a different
[38:41] chapter four chapters later and he's
[38:44] saying the same thing. Look at my life.
[38:47] Look at my life. It tells you who I
[38:50] belong to.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Who is manifested their self inside of
[38:55] me?
[38:58] We want to use this verse,
[39:04] this this verse here, this verse 12. And
[39:07] when we're trying to express the image
[39:08] of Jesus Christ, verily, verily, I say
[39:10] unto you, he that believeth on me, the
[39:13] works that I do shall he do also, and
[39:17] greater works shall he do, because I go
[39:20] unto my father. And Jesus only lived to
[39:23] 33.
[39:25] Think about that.
[39:27] If we're older than 33, we've lived
[39:29] longer than Jesus,
[39:31] which to whom much is given, much is
[39:33] required, more works, more in quantity.
[39:40] Brother Brandon would often quote this
[39:42] scripture for a couple reasons.
[39:45] He was trying to get the people to
[39:46] recognize that God was amongst them.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; And that God is alive. He's a well.
[39:54] And number two, that God inside of us
[39:56] will create the same life.
[40:00] Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ the same
[40:02] yesterday, today, and forever.
[40:07] All right. St. John chapter 17 verse 20.
[40:10] Now we're coming into this part where
[40:13] God is wanting
[40:16] us to become one in the same image of
[40:19] him. We see that Jesus is in the same
[40:22] image of God. And now God is wanting us
[40:26] to be in the same image of Jesus Christ.
[40:28] If I could say it like this, the prophet
[40:30] would go on to say, he would say, "All
[40:32] that God was, he poured into Christ. All
[40:34] that Christ was, he poured into the
[40:36] church."
[40:38] &gt;&gt; John 17:20, "Neither pray I for these
[40:41] alone, but for them also which shall
[40:45] believe on me through their word."
[40:49] Now that is us. that every that is every
[40:52] one of us because we have read the Bible
[40:56] where they have spoken because Jesus is
[40:58] praying for his disciples. Disciples,
[41:00] you know, wrote
[41:02] the word and we're believing on the
[41:05] word. So he prayed for us to
[41:10] that they all may be one
[41:14] &gt;&gt; as thou Father art in me and I in thee
[41:19] that they also may be one in us
[41:22] &gt;&gt; that the world may believe that thou has
[41:24] sent me. Now notice there's such a
[41:27] oneness here. Now if I was going to say
[41:30] to you I want to be one with you brother
[41:32] Stan. I want us to figure out how we're
[41:35] going to do this next project and I want
[41:36] to be one in that. And we can't agree
[41:40] in being one. But that doesn't mean
[41:43] we're one.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Being one is of the same spirit,
[41:49] the same mind, the same uh character.
[41:55] It's exactly the same.
[41:58] Uh,
[42:04] there's three that bear witness on
[42:07] earth.
[42:10] I'm sorry I can't quote it right now.
[42:11] It's in John, but I'll just say it like
[42:13] this. To be one with God. It It is not
[42:18] joining a church or saying I'm in the
[42:21] message or or saying I believe that
[42:24] William Brandon was a prophet. It it
[42:27] isn't like your idea what God is.
[42:31] Being one with God is being God.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; It's being God in the flesh.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; It is taking your life and emptying out
[42:39] and saying, God, come inside and
[42:41] manifest yourself. That is what Jesus
[42:43] was praying.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Verse 22.
[42:49] And the glory which thou gavest me, I
[42:51] have given them that they may be one
[42:54] even as we are one. See, she's showing
[42:57] here the very heart desire of Jesus
[43:00] Christ is to be one with the church. I
[43:04] think this is so beautiful.
[43:08] Jesus prayed a prayer for us that we
[43:10] would be one and manifest him through
[43:12] our flesh. That's what needed to be.
[43:14] He's wanting to see his nature
[43:16] manifested through us. In order for that
[43:18] to happen, we've got to die out from our
[43:20] nature. We got to say, "Yes, Lord. I'm
[43:22] going to be one with you.
[43:25] The oneness, it's him inside of us."
[43:27] Brother Brandon preached in a message
[43:30] called the images of Christ. And he took
[43:33] this subject.
[43:35] He says, "What does it take to make a
[43:39] Christian?"
[43:41] He said, "It's not doing the acts of
[43:43] Christianity that makes you a Christian.
[43:48] He said, 'I believe that that being in
[43:50] the image of Christ makes you a
[43:52] Christian. There it is. I believe being
[43:54] in the image of Christ makes you
[43:57] Christian.
[43:59] Not my opinion,
[44:02] not my knowledge,
[44:05] nothing to do about what I am capable of
[44:08] doing.
[44:10] It's all about him living in me. Right?
[44:14] &gt;&gt; I'm now manifesting an image of Christ
[44:18] that makes me Christlike or a Christian.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; He says it's not what we do outwardly.
[44:28] It's what happens inwardly that makes us
[44:30] what we are. Then therefore if he is our
[44:35] image and we are his we are in his
[44:39] likeness and members of his body we
[44:42] should be images like him.
[44:46] Then our lives should reflect the image
[44:49] of Christ.
[44:51] Not in our joining the church or in our
[44:55] packing a crucifix or our emotions,
[44:59] but it should be in the living presence
[45:03] of the living God that's reflected
[45:06] through our lives.
[45:10] Now, there's only one way to get that
[45:13] and that's when the Holy Spirit has its
[45:15] way inside of our life.
[45:18] It takes the very life of God. Only
[45:20] Christ can manifest Christ.
[45:23] There's a lot of people can can mimic
[45:25] it, fake it, pretend it, but only
[45:31] Christ can bear Christ.
[45:34] Amen. We got one amen out of that one.
[45:37] [laughter]
[45:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Romans chapter 8. This is
[45:40] familiar scripture. We've read it many
[45:43] times, but it should be part of our our
[45:46] our vision. As brother Ron was saying,
[45:48] our vision, what we're what we're
[45:49] looking forward to. Romans 8 8:28 says,
[45:53] "For we know that all things work
[45:55] together for the good to them that love
[45:56] God,
[45:57] &gt;&gt; to them who are called according to his
[45:59] purpose." Now, I wonder what that
[46:01] purpose is. Well, it's to be one. We
[46:03] just read to be one. For whom he did
[46:06] forno, he also did predestinate to be
[46:10] conformed
[46:12] to the image of his son
[46:16] that he might be the firstborn among
[46:20] many brethren.
[46:23] Think about that.
[46:26] His prayer is his purpose is for us to
[46:30] become one, to become conformed into his
[46:33] image. That is where God is at. We can
[46:35] go home. We can leave church. We can get
[46:37] involved with the things of this world.
[46:39] And we can forget all about God's
[46:40] purpose. Well, I'm telling you, you have
[46:42] no promise that all things work together
[46:44] for the good.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Here's the thing. No matter what
[46:49] happens, God is coming back for a bride
[46:51] that's just like him.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't God will not gift that to
[46:56] us. It's something that you've got to be
[46:59] willing to say, "My nature is worth
[47:02] dying out for to get his.
[47:06] I'm I'm I'm worth dying daily that I
[47:09] could see Jesus more manifested in my
[47:11] life.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; See, the denominational belief is, hey,
[47:16] if you speak in tong, you got the Holy
[47:17] Ghost, great. You're going in
[47:19] or something like that.
[47:24] But God says you, there's no scripture
[47:27] for these in the Bible, but we do have
[47:29] scriptures to become in his image.
[47:33] And that is what really God is
[47:34] requiring. So he says in verse 30,
[47:37] "Moreover, whom he did predestinate, he
[47:39] also called. And to whom he called, them
[47:41] he justified, to whom he justified, them
[47:43] he also glorified."
[47:45] What are we going to say to these
[47:46] things? If God before us, who can be
[47:49] against us. So God has already said yes,
[47:52] it's going to happen. We just got to
[47:55] believe it. Now, I love this next verse.
[47:59] 32. He that spared not his own son, but
[48:04] delivered him up for us all, how shall
[48:08] he not with him also freely give us all
[48:12] things?
[48:14] All things
[48:16] all things to be in his image.
[48:24] In other words, we should never doubt.
[48:27] We should never question that we're
[48:28] going to be just like Jesus.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; If God's for us, it's going to happen.
[48:37] Alls we got to do is be for God.
[48:39] [laughter]
[48:41] Amen. First John chapter 3:1,
[48:45] "Beloved, what manner of love the Father
[48:49] have bestowed upon us that we should be
[48:52] called the sons of God.
[48:54] Therefore the world knoweth us not
[48:57] because it knew him not. Imagine this
[48:59] that Jesus Christ walked the earth but
[49:02] he was hid from everybody.
[49:04] He came to his own. His own received him
[49:06] not. They were they were blinded. But
[49:09] yet he was God manifested in the flesh.
[49:13] And it you know and the prophet taught
[49:14] us is because they had their own
[49:18] way of thinking of how they thought God
[49:21] would be. remember he come in on a red
[49:23] carpet and say I am here not not going
[49:25] to come born in a manger and but God is
[49:29] so humble that's what people don't
[49:32] realize
[49:33] God is able to create the whole universe
[49:38] and never have an ounce of pride in him
[49:43] &gt;&gt; humble himself to where we need to be
[49:46] careful because we could be entertaining
[49:47] strangers unawares
[49:51] God could be right in our midst and we
[49:53] we'd miss it
[49:55] because God is so humble.
[50:02] It didn't know him. Jesus said, "The
[50:04] kingdom of God cometh not with
[50:05] observation." You know, many people go
[50:07] to services and they look at a service
[50:09] of what happens on the outside and
[50:10] dictate whether it's a good service or
[50:12] not.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; It's about observation. It's about what
[50:16] what how the spirit is moving outwardly
[50:18] in the flesh. Well, I'm telling you,
[50:20] there wasn't a whole lot of sensation
[50:21] that Mary had when she birthed Jesus.
[50:26] You know, it's really what's happening
[50:27] on the inside of us.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it wouldn't be a
[50:32] public show. It's all about the
[50:35] character of God in our human bodies.
[50:38] Verse two, beloved, now are we the sons
[50:43] of God. And it does not yet appear what
[50:44] we shall be, but we know that when he
[50:46] shall appear, we're going to be just
[50:48] like him, for we shall see him as he is.
[50:51] In other words, he's coming back for
[50:52] himself.
[50:54] He's coming back for his bride, which is
[50:56] in him. He took a part of it out when he
[50:59] created Adam and Eve, and now he's
[51:01] coming back
[51:04] for that same bride manifested through
[51:06] Satan's Eden.
[51:08] Amen.
[51:11] Now, it's not our bodies
[51:15] that's going to be just like him. It's
[51:17] going to be our spirit. It's going to be
[51:20] our character.
[51:22] That's what it's going to be. And every
[51:24] man that has this hope in him purifith
[51:27] himself even as he is pure. This is this
[51:31] is where we have a chance to become like
[51:35] Christ.
[51:38] Every man that has this hope of being
[51:40] like Christ knows that there is a
[51:44] process. There's a process to becoming
[51:47] like Christ. Sitting in church does not
[51:50] make you Christian because you can sit
[51:53] in the barn and become a goat or a
[51:55] chicken or a horse.
[51:58] So there is a process
[52:01] &gt;&gt; and the process has nothing to do with
[52:04] sitting in church. It has to do with
[52:07] being in his presence when you're in
[52:08] church
[52:10] &gt;&gt; and to receiving the revelation of his
[52:12] word so you can able manifest it. It's
[52:15] not a gift. It's not gifted to
[52:18] believers. But we must go through a
[52:20] process to obtain his character. And
[52:23] every man that has this hope in him
[52:26] purifies himself. There's something that
[52:29] he's doing.
[52:32] I'm sure you've all spent time purifying
[52:34] something,
[52:36] right? Either cooking cooking something
[52:38] with hot water
[52:40] or getting alcohol. And
[52:43] we've all spent time, we understand what
[52:45] it means to purify itself. There's an
[52:47] action that takes place to get it in a
[52:49] in a place that I I I
[52:53] mean there is probably times that all of
[52:55] us have been guilty of picking up a
[52:57] fork, a spoon, a knife that wasn't
[53:00] completely washed and using it sometime
[53:02] in our life,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Well, there's no way when I wanted to go
[53:06] have surgery that I wanted the same
[53:08] utensils used on the last guy being used
[53:10] on me.
[53:14] and and and God does not want our nature
[53:16] in heaven. He doesn't it's
[53:19] [clears throat] it's emnity. He he
[53:20] doesn't like our nature. We were born in
[53:22] sin shaped iniquity. He hates my ideas.
[53:26] He hates my opinions.
[53:29] What he wants me is to love being what
[53:32] he wants me to be because he's God, not
[53:35] me. He's the potter. I'm the clay.
[53:38] Brother Brandon would go on to say that
[53:40] God's character can only be built
[53:42] through trials.
[53:46] Character's only chance of being built
[53:50] is when we're going through a trial.
[53:55] Now, that trial can happen right here in
[53:57] church. When the word is being presented
[53:59] to you, God provides us an opportunity
[54:03] to build character through trials. And
[54:06] that's it. Because why is that? Why why
[54:08] did he choose that? Because the nature
[54:10] we were born with has to die. That's I
[54:13] mean if you just just
[54:15] Jesus said you must be born again
[54:19] &gt;&gt; because this the nature that you have
[54:22] does not want to submit to my word.
[54:25] It it's emnity.
[54:27] It's emnity. God's is emnity in our
[54:29] flesh's enmity with God.
[54:32] We don't. If you think about it, every
[54:34] one of us that came to Christ didn't
[54:35] really want to surrender when we came.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; We fought it. We fought that thing
[54:42] &gt;&gt; because we wanted to do it our way, the
[54:44] Frank Sinatra way.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And and and Jesus said, "You must be
[54:49] born. That thing must go because that
[54:51] thing cannot be tamed.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; That thing cannot be controlled. that
[54:57] thing cannot be uh used to fit in. God
[55:02] hates it. So, we must die out. And it
[55:06] takes a a trial to where we come up
[55:08] right to
[55:10] right to our our our place where we have
[55:13] to make a decision. Surrender to God or
[55:16] bulldoze our way through just doing what
[55:18] we want to do. And that's the way the
[55:20] world does it. They really don't care
[55:22] about God's way. They don't care about
[55:24] what God's speaking to them, what God's
[55:26] trying to say to them, what character
[55:27] needs to be changed. They just want to
[55:29] fix the problem, get it out of the way,
[55:30] and go on with life. And that's how the
[55:32] world works. And then you've got
[55:35] so-called
[55:37] nominal worldly Christians
[55:40] who just uh try to find some way to
[55:45] halfway go through that process. But the
[55:48] bride understands that God is in control
[55:51] of their life.
[55:54] and and that she submits herself to God
[55:58] in those trials. [snorts]
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And it's through that process of
[56:02] surrendering. Yeah, you feel like
[56:04] nothing, right? You feel like you're
[56:06] just flat out nothing when it happens,
[56:09] but something is being built inside of
[56:11] you that's much more precious than gold.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Character is built on the inside.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; It happens. If I could say this, it
[56:23] happens in our heart and not our head.
[56:27] That's why you can't study to be a
[56:28] Christian,
[56:31] right? You can't become born again
[56:33] through knowledge,
[56:36] you know, off the tree of knowledge. It
[56:38] puffs you up. It makes you feel you're
[56:39] something when you're not. And and in
[56:42] your heart, there's where your humility
[56:44] is at.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; But
[56:47] it starts there. And then you become
[56:48] humble in your mind. it it controls it.
[56:51] All right. I got some quotes to read if
[56:53] it's okay. And and since you're not
[56:56] going anywhere today, you know what I'm
[56:58] saying? You know what I'm gonna say. I'm
[57:00] just going to take my time.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; In the messages of the uh Thorian, no,
[57:06] Thotarian church age. Brother Ram said,
[57:09] "Now faithfulness and patience go
[57:12] together." Think about that.
[57:13] Faithfulness and patience, they go
[57:16] together. In fact, patience is the
[57:19] outcome of faithfulness. Think about
[57:23] that. If you ever want to have patience
[57:24] and we say, "Well, you ask for patience,
[57:26] you're asking for trials, right?" But
[57:30] brother Brandham's saying here, it's
[57:31] faithfulness that brings trials. But
[57:34] it's like this, you have to be faithful
[57:35] through the trial
[57:37] and that will bring about your um your
[57:41] patience. For it says, "The trying of
[57:45] your faith workketh patience." There's
[57:48] absolutely no other way in which to gain
[57:51] patience. It has to come by the trial of
[57:54] our faith. Tribulation workketh
[57:56] patience. How highly God regards this
[58:01] outward outworking of our patience is
[58:05] seen in James 14 uh chapter 1 verse4.
[58:09] But let patience have her perfect work
[58:12] that you may be perfect and entire
[58:15] lacking nothing.
[58:17] God's will for us is perfection. He said
[58:22] and that perfection is patience.
[58:26] Waiting on God, waiting for God. This is
[58:30] the process of character development.
[58:37] Now I got a glimpse of how I can become
[58:40] in the image of Christ because with this
[58:42] is the process. You you can't go to
[58:45] school and study how to become like
[58:47] Jesus. You can't go to college. You
[58:49] can't go to seminary. You can't Google
[58:52] it.
[58:54] It's going through the process.
[58:57] And the Bible tells us the process.
[59:00] In the Leoian church age, brother says,
[59:02] "Listen to me." Naked physically we came
[59:05] into this world and naked spiritually we
[59:08] will not leave it.
[59:10] Oh no, we're going to take something
[59:13] with us. What that something is is all
[59:17] we can take with us. Nothing less and
[59:20] nothing more. So we have better be real
[59:24] careful now to see that we can take
[59:26] something that will make us right before
[59:30] God.
[59:32] Notice not we saying we accepted Jesus
[59:36] Christ when we on the earth.
[59:38] That doesn't make us right with God.
[59:41] Getting baptized, joining a church. I'm
[59:44] sorry. That doesn't make us right with
[59:46] God. Brother Brandham says we have to
[59:49] take something with us to make us right.
[59:53] We can't take that.
[59:56] Baptism is just an an outward expression
[59:59] of something we're claiming is going on
[1:00:02] on the inside of us. But our life, if
[1:00:04] our life don't follow up with what we
[1:00:07] what we confessed in that water baptism,
[1:00:10] then brother Brandham says we just come
[1:00:11] up a dry sinner. I mean a wet sinner.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; So then what will he take? What will we
[1:00:23] take with us? question mark. We will
[1:00:26] take our character, brother.
[1:00:29] That is what we will take with us. Now,
[1:00:32] what kind of character will you take
[1:00:34] with you?
[1:00:36] Will it be like his,
[1:00:40] speaking of Jesus Christ, whose
[1:00:42] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:00:46] fiery furnace of affliction?
[1:00:48] Or will it be the softness of this
[1:00:51] characterless characterless Leodysian
[1:00:54] people?
[1:00:55] He says it's up to each one of us for in
[1:00:59] that day every man will bear his own
[1:01:02] burden. You know, some people can't bear
[1:01:03] a burden. They can't pay the price. They
[1:01:06] they don't want to die out. They don't
[1:01:09] want to crucify their flesh. Their their
[1:01:11] burden is too heavy. I I can't do this.
[1:01:14] Lord, uh take this cup away from me. But
[1:01:17] then you've got the other group that
[1:01:18] says, "Nevertheless, not my will, thy
[1:01:20] will be done."
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And they're willing to bear the the the
[1:01:25] cross, to pick up the cross and follow
[1:01:28] him. Praise God. How many's happy this
[1:01:31] morning?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; I'm happy in Jesus. Revelation 3:18,
[1:01:35] Jesus speaking here to us, the church.
[1:01:38] He says, "I counsel you to buy of me
[1:01:42] gold. I've got what it takes. Tried in
[1:01:45] the fire that thou mayest be rich in
[1:01:47] white raignant that the and that thou
[1:01:49] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[1:01:52] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:01:54] thy eyes with eyes that thou mayest see.
[1:01:56] Now notice what he's saying here.
[1:01:59] Brother Brandham says you got to make
[1:02:00] sure you take something with you that'll
[1:02:02] make you right before God when you get
[1:02:04] there. And Jesus is saying here, you've
[1:02:06] got to buy me gold. What is he referring
[1:02:08] to? Deity. That's his own life. that
[1:02:11] that's the only thing that'll be
[1:02:12] acceptable on the other side is the
[1:02:14] character of Jesus Christ. Now, if if
[1:02:18] God's character could be manifested in
[1:02:20] Jesus and Jesus is the same yesterday,
[1:02:22] today and forever, then we should have
[1:02:24] faith as his bride to believe that we
[1:02:26] will manifest Jesus Christ.
[1:02:31] There is in church age, brother Brand
[1:02:33] speaking. He says, "But there is a gold
[1:02:35] of God
[1:02:37] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:02:39] more precious than gold that perisheth,
[1:02:41] the gold of God is a Christlike
[1:02:45] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:02:48] of affliction." That is the right kind
[1:02:51] of gold.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; So if we're ever going to become in his
[1:02:56] image, we've got to be paying attention
[1:02:59] to this furnace.
[1:03:02] Because usually when people get in a
[1:03:03] furnace, what's the first thing you want
[1:03:04] to do is get out.
[1:03:08] And if you get out before the character
[1:03:10] has been molded, what happens?
[1:03:14] What happens? What? Okay,
[1:03:19] Sister Lynn. Well, all of us bake. I'm
[1:03:21] just going to pick on you for a second.
[1:03:22] You make it such a delicious chocolate
[1:03:24] cake.
[1:03:25] You get that batter all perfect and you
[1:03:27] stick it in the oven. What if that cake
[1:03:29] batter says, "WHOA, IT'S GETTING HOT IN
[1:03:32] HERE. Let's [clears throat] get this
[1:03:33] thing out of here." Knocking on the
[1:03:34] door. Let me out of here. And the cake
[1:03:36] comes out
[1:03:38] like five minutes after it's put in.
[1:03:41] Well, it's not going to be molded into
[1:03:43] what it was needed to be.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing when we're
[1:03:50] going through trials. We may be saying,
[1:03:52] "What in the world's going on?" But God
[1:03:55] is there and he's got something else in
[1:03:57] mind than what we're thinking about.
[1:04:01] Same church age brother Ram said think
[1:04:03] it quoting the scripture think it not
[1:04:05] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[1:04:07] are to try you. He said that is what
[1:04:10] Peter said it's a and he then he says is
[1:04:13] it strange asking a question. Is it
[1:04:15] strange that God wants to develop a
[1:04:17] Christlike character that comes through
[1:04:19] suffering? That's what brother
[1:04:21] Brandham's asking the church here.
[1:04:23] Is it strange? He says, "No, sir.
[1:04:27] And we all have trials. We are all tried
[1:04:31] and chasened as sons.
[1:04:34] Not one but goes through that. The
[1:04:37] church that is not suffering, listen to
[1:04:39] this, the church that is not suffering
[1:04:42] and is not being tried hasn't got it."
[1:04:47] He said, "It isn't of God."
[1:04:50] Trials in a church do not bother me.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; God is trying to develop character.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people all they can
[1:05:02] do is murmur and complain about a
[1:05:04] problem in a church.
[1:05:08] And brother and and and brother Brandham
[1:05:10] is saying he says if if we're doing
[1:05:12] that, God is not in it.
[1:05:17] No, God is looking for somebody to step
[1:05:19] up and help the church,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; help the body.
[1:05:28] Anybody somehow today something
[1:05:32] happened, we slipped and we cut oursel
[1:05:35] and you're bleeding.
[1:05:37] There's no doubt that every one of us is
[1:05:40] going to pay some attention to that.
[1:05:43] We're going to go, "Oo, I got to get to
[1:05:45] the bathroom. I got to wipe this off. I
[1:05:46] got to get a band-aid. I got to do
[1:05:48] something." You want to take care of it.
[1:05:50] Why? Because you're hurting. You're
[1:05:52] bleeding.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Can it get through your clothes?
[1:05:54] Whatever. Well, look, when there's
[1:05:56] somebody in the body of the church
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; that's bleeding, that's hurting, that
[1:06:03] there's a need. If you're part of the
[1:06:05] body, you care about that. Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Now understand there have been people
[1:06:12] that come and go in this church.
[1:06:15] This church would not be big enough if
[1:06:17] we did it three times bigger to hold the
[1:06:20] people that have come and gone.
[1:06:23] And there are people who just come in
[1:06:26] periodically once in a while.
[1:06:30] But I am talking about who the body is.
[1:06:36] There's a big difference.
[1:06:40] Brother Brandham said it like this
[1:06:44] in the church order. Someone who comes
[1:06:46] to church faithfully for two years,
[1:06:49] pays your tithes,
[1:06:53] supports supports the church with your
[1:06:55] tithes, your offerings, and the pastor.
[1:06:58] That makes you a member of that church.
[1:07:05] I mean, there's a big difference between
[1:07:08] being all in and like I'm not sure.
[1:07:18] All right. So, let me finish this quote.
[1:07:20] Brother Brand said Hebrews 12, quoting
[1:07:22] Hebrews 12 6 and 8. He says, "For whom
[1:07:25] the Lord loveth, what does he do?
[1:07:28] chastineth, and he scourgeth every son
[1:07:32] whom he receiveth. But if you be without
[1:07:36] chastisement,
[1:07:37] wherefore all of us are partakers, then
[1:07:40] you are bastards. You are bastards and
[1:07:43] not sons. Think about this statement
[1:07:46] right here. If we don't want to be
[1:07:48] corrected,
[1:07:50] then I um you know, we all might as well
[1:07:53] just follow out all these people that
[1:07:54] are leaving. [laughter]
[1:07:56] I'll just take this. I'll just take the
[1:07:58] notes with me. We'll we'll preach along
[1:07:59] the way. [laughter]
[1:08:03] If we if we do not receive correction,
[1:08:07] all we're saying is I'm not part of God.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And it's such a a dangerous thing. I
[1:08:13] want I want us to catch this here. It's
[1:08:15] in 2 Corinthians chapter 5. I'm sorry. 2
[1:08:18] Corinthians chapter 3:15. If you have
[1:08:20] your Bibles,
[1:08:23] 2 Corinthians 3:15
[1:08:26] says, "But even until this day, when
[1:08:29] Moses is read from the Bible,
[1:08:33] the veil is upon their heart." Notice
[1:08:38] their head. they can maybe figure things
[1:08:41] out and
[1:08:43] either uh talk about it in a a way that
[1:08:49] uh could prove it wrong. But he's saying
[1:08:52] the reason that is there is because
[1:08:53] there's a veil in their heart. And Jesus
[1:08:57] said if this go uh Paul said if this
[1:08:59] gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
[1:09:01] are lost. who who who uh God has God of
[1:09:05] this evil age has blinded the minds of
[1:09:07] them that believe not.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; So it all starts in the heart.
[1:09:13] Verse 16, nevertheless,
[1:09:16] when it the heart shall turn to the
[1:09:20] Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And now the Lord is that spirit. And
[1:09:27] where the spirit of the Lord is, there
[1:09:30] is liberty.
[1:09:32] So what's happening right here?
[1:09:35] He's coming. We come to church and he
[1:09:38] knocks on our heart with the word of
[1:09:40] God.
[1:09:42] He says, "I would like to come into your
[1:09:44] heart and have liberty.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I would like to be in your decision
[1:09:48] making. I would like to be in that place
[1:09:50] of where free will uh you have a you
[1:09:53] choose me with your free will.
[1:09:56] And if you let him in your heart, then
[1:09:58] God is in your heart." But do you know
[1:10:00] how many people say, "God is in my
[1:10:02] heart." But they don't let him come in
[1:10:03] their heart.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; That is how deceiving the devil is.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; They say, "Yeah, God's with me. God's in
[1:10:10] my heart." But they won't let him in.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; So now the Lord is that spirit. Where
[1:10:18] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[1:10:19] liberty. But we all with open face
[1:10:22] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:10:25] Lord are changed into the same image of
[1:10:29] Jesus Christ from glory to glory even as
[1:10:33] by the spirit of the Lord.
[1:10:37] Now trials provide us that opp that that
[1:10:42] opportunity to be changed.
[1:10:46] So this scripture is is really twofold
[1:10:49] if I could say it like this. First of
[1:10:52] all, you enter into a trial and it's at
[1:10:55] that time that God is wanting you to
[1:10:57] surrender to him and let him be
[1:10:59] manifested in this trial
[1:11:03] and you have a choice to make. And if
[1:11:04] God takes if God if you truly give God
[1:11:07] liberty in your trial, then he's going
[1:11:10] to manifest himself there.
[1:11:13] But the scripture is also talking about
[1:11:15] sitting in church and you're hearing the
[1:11:16] word of God being preached
[1:11:19] and you're hearing the word of God and
[1:11:21] the word of God says you need to do
[1:11:22] this. You need to start doing that. The
[1:11:24] preacher could be saying one thing but
[1:11:26] God is speaking directly to you about
[1:11:28] something else. And I'm telling you in
[1:11:30] church there's a lot of trials that are
[1:11:31] going on.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; And at that point you have got to yield
[1:11:37] your vessel to God and say God have your
[1:11:39] way in my life. I want it to be changed.
[1:11:41] Well, I wanted to be changed now. I want
[1:11:43] to become more like you. I want to
[1:11:44] become in your image.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; You know how many people go to church
[1:11:48] and they put peacock feathers in?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; They want to act a certain way,
[1:11:54] but then they go home and they just live
[1:11:55] different.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; We are changed
[1:12:02] when we give God liberty in the middle
[1:12:04] of our decision- making.
[1:12:08] Because when we're not going through a
[1:12:09] trial, there's not a whole lot of
[1:12:11] decision- makingaking there, right? It's
[1:12:14] it's it's through the through the trial
[1:12:16] and and that's why it's it's it's much
[1:12:19] more comfortable coming to church and
[1:12:21] hearing a sermon where you're not
[1:12:22] challenged. It is it's it's much more
[1:12:26] comfortable. It's easy to get behind and
[1:12:28] say, "Amen." And I'm enjoying this and
[1:12:31] yes, I'm a child of the king and but
[1:12:33] when we're when we're challenged like
[1:12:35] brother Brandham challenges us. He
[1:12:36] really does. He challenges us. It makes
[1:12:40] us step back and wait a minute. Maybe I
[1:12:44] need to be doing more.
[1:12:46] Maybe this is God speaking to me what I
[1:12:48] need to be doing next. And it's at that
[1:12:50] point that we begin to change from glory
[1:12:52] unto glory. Amen. The word is
[1:12:55] transforming us honestly into the image
[1:12:57] of Jesus Christ. Romans 12:2 says, "And
[1:13:00] be not conformed to this world, but be
[1:13:03] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:13:04] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:13:06] acceptable and perfect will of God."
[1:13:10] So we come to church or we're at home
[1:13:13] and we're going through a trial, he
[1:13:14] speaks to us, "As many as I love, I
[1:13:16] rebuke and chasen." He says, "Be
[1:13:19] zealous, therefore, repent." In other
[1:13:22] words, turn around.
[1:13:25] Don't say, "I'm sorry."
[1:13:29] Turn around.
[1:13:31] Turn the direction and head a different
[1:13:35] direction. He says, "Behold, I stand at
[1:13:37] the door and I knock. If any man will
[1:13:40] hear my voice and open the door, I will
[1:13:42] come to him and s with him and he and he
[1:13:44] with me." Think about this. Can you
[1:13:46] imagine coming to church and not even
[1:13:47] hearing God speak to you?
[1:13:50] That would mean that you're not paying
[1:13:51] attention.
[1:13:53] That's the only thing that means
[1:13:56] because God is faithful
[1:14:00] to him that overcomemeth overcomemeth
[1:14:02] what their ugly nature will I grant to
[1:14:05] sit with me on my throne even as I
[1:14:07] overcame and has sat down with my father
[1:14:08] in his throne. He that have an ear let
[1:14:10] him hear what the spirit is seeing. What
[1:14:13] does Jesus want to come into our heart
[1:14:14] for? He wants to change our nature.
[1:14:19] He wants to be he wants us to become one
[1:14:21] with him.
[1:14:23] And the what we got to overcome. We got
[1:14:26] to overcome the the the temptation of
[1:14:28] not opening the door.
[1:14:31] The the the temptation of no, I don't
[1:14:33] want you to come in. We got to overcome
[1:14:36] that. We said just wing that door open.
[1:14:38] God, come on into my life.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam told a story about
[1:14:45] beating the dross out of the gold.
[1:14:47] He says before they had the days of the
[1:14:50] smelter, the Indians and the old uh
[1:14:53] goldsmith, they used to beat the dross
[1:14:54] out by getting a hammer and just beating
[1:14:56] it, beating the gold before they were
[1:14:59] melting it. They would beat it and beat
[1:15:01] it and then turn it over and they would
[1:15:03] beat it and they would keep beating it
[1:15:05] until the draws or all that wasn't gold
[1:15:07] was beaten out. And the only way they
[1:15:10] knew that the draws was all out is when
[1:15:12] they looked at that gold that they were
[1:15:14] beating and they could actually see the
[1:15:16] reflection of himself in it.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; And he said it was so much to the point
[1:15:22] that they could literally shave like a
[1:15:24] mirror. He said,
[1:15:27] brother Brandon says here in the images
[1:15:30] of Christ, he says that when the Holy
[1:15:32] Spirit of God begins to beat on us with
[1:15:34] the gospel hammer until all the things
[1:15:37] of the world is beaten out and we can
[1:15:40] reflect the image of the Lord God, then
[1:15:43] I believe we become Christians.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; That's a lot different than I'm going to
[1:15:48] get baptized and join a church and uh
[1:15:51] okay, I'm a Christian.
[1:15:53] No. That's why I'm so Larry about people
[1:15:56] that want to get baptized. Why do you
[1:15:58] want to get baptized?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Have you Have you truly made the
[1:16:04] decision to let the gospel beat beat the
[1:16:07] world out of you?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Because you know how many times I deal
[1:16:12] with people that want to get rebaptized?
[1:16:15] Had that happen just just lately? It's
[1:16:17] important that you know what decision
[1:16:19] you're making when you want to get
[1:16:20] baptized.
[1:16:23] He says, 'I believe we become Christians
[1:16:24] for the word Christian means Christlike
[1:16:27] and to reflect him.
[1:16:30] Now we don't have to reflect his
[1:16:32] physical image, the beard and all that.
[1:16:35] He says, but we must in our souls
[1:16:38] reflect the spirit, his spirit image
[1:16:42] and his manner of life. And I believe
[1:16:45] it's a reflection of Jesus Christ in a
[1:16:48] human being. For we are his members and
[1:16:50] members of his body and we bear his
[1:16:52] image. The scripture says, I think
[1:16:54] brother B makes it real clear what it
[1:16:57] means to be a Christian.
[1:17:00] Now what kind of image was he?
[1:17:03] He came not to be some great somebody.
[1:17:07] Yet he was. But he came as a servant. He
[1:17:10] came not to be ministered to but to
[1:17:12] minister.
[1:17:14] Our text tonight reflects what that was.
[1:17:17] That's what makes him great. Yet being
[1:17:21] the very God of eternity, the very God
[1:17:23] who created the heavens and the earth,
[1:17:25] when he came here, he took the lowest
[1:17:27] position, the most disdesirable job that
[1:17:32] anybody could ever had, and that was a
[1:17:34] footwash flunky.
[1:17:39] In all the pains of the early days in
[1:17:42] the oriental world, the footwash flunky
[1:17:46] was the lowest paid man of all. For in
[1:17:49] those days, animals walked in the
[1:17:51] highways and they were by the byways and
[1:17:53] they went by and along the road it stunk
[1:17:55] and all the road with the animals and
[1:17:59] the dust flew up and got on their legs
[1:18:01] and their feet and such an awful stink
[1:18:04] it as it was. And as soon as someone
[1:18:07] would come and visit another, he could
[1:18:09] not come into the in that manner. He he
[1:18:12] smelt bad from the stink of the road and
[1:18:14] the dust and like around a li a livery
[1:18:18] stable. he says.
[1:18:20] So the first thing he did, he had to get
[1:18:22] a little booth and a reception booth and
[1:18:24] the lowest paid man on the place, just
[1:18:26] like some slaves, stayed back in there
[1:18:29] to wash the feet of the guests that was
[1:18:31] coming and give him another pair of
[1:18:33] shoes to put on a little sandals to slip
[1:18:35] on him. And when he was anointed and
[1:18:38] then with the oil and he come out to be
[1:18:40] the guest of his friend because he'd
[1:18:43] feel all out of place going in there so
[1:18:46] full of stink of the roads and sweaty
[1:18:48] and so forth. And the footwash flunk he
[1:18:51] was paid less than any that there was.
[1:18:56] And the God of heaven humbled himself.
[1:18:58] The greatest that there was became the
[1:19:01] lowest that there was.
[1:19:04] What is brother Brandham showing us
[1:19:06] here? He's showing us what the real
[1:19:08] image of God is.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Because we might have missed that. We
[1:19:13] might have been looking at the the
[1:19:15] fishes and the loaves and the walking on
[1:19:17] the water and and the people getting
[1:19:19] healed. We might have been looking at
[1:19:21] that power and missing the nature of
[1:19:25] Christ.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; What is this representing? By this shall
[1:19:32] all men know you're my disciples. When
[1:19:34] you have love one for another, when you
[1:19:36] can stoop down so low,
[1:19:47] you just live that life.
[1:19:49] You can't make people love God,
[1:19:57] but you can live such a life that
[1:19:59] represents Christ. Christ did not go
[1:20:03] around trying to get Judas to make a
[1:20:06] different decision,
[1:20:08] right? Didn't try to run after the rich
[1:20:10] young ruler, make a different decision.
[1:20:14] He didn't do that. That was not his
[1:20:15] nature.
[1:20:17] But his nature was to give an
[1:20:18] opportunity.
[1:20:21] But it must go through free more agency.
[1:20:26] What did he do?
[1:20:29] What did Jesus do? He laid his garments
[1:20:31] down and he took a towel and he girded
[1:20:34] himself
[1:20:36] and he poured water into a base and
[1:20:38] began to wash the disciples feet to wipe
[1:20:40] them with the towel which which he was
[1:20:42] gerted.
[1:20:43] In John 13:12, he says, "Afterwards,
[1:20:47] after he washed the feet of his
[1:20:48] disciples, he had taken his garment and
[1:20:50] he sat down and he said unto them, do
[1:20:53] you know what I just done to you? I
[1:20:55] washed your feet. Now, do you know what
[1:20:57] I've done to you?"
[1:20:59] He says, "You call me Master and Lord,
[1:21:02] and you say the right thing, for so I
[1:21:05] am.
[1:21:07] If I then, your Lord and Master, have
[1:21:09] washed your feet, you ought to wash one
[1:21:12] another's feet. For I have given you an
[1:21:14] example that you should do as I have
[1:21:17] done unto you. And I just wonder how
[1:21:19] many times we find ourselves complaining
[1:21:22] about somebody else
[1:21:26] instead of going and trying to help that
[1:21:28] person.
[1:21:35] Jesus gave us an example.
[1:21:39] We didn't. The disciples Jesus did not
[1:21:43] get all the disciples dirty. He didn't
[1:21:46] say, "Gabe, come on over to my barn.
[1:21:48] Shove it out your feet and I'm going to
[1:21:49] wash your feet afterwards."
[1:21:52] It wasn't like that.
[1:21:54] It was like they got their own feet
[1:21:57] dirty. They walked in all the places
[1:21:58] they walked. They got their hands dirty.
[1:22:01] And he says, 'You know what? I'm going
[1:22:02] to wash you up
[1:22:05] because I love you.
[1:22:08] I created the heavens, but I'm not too
[1:22:10] great that I can't wash your feet. I
[1:22:12] can't I I It's so easy to see pride a
[1:22:15] million miles away.
[1:22:17] People can't humble themsel to be real.
[1:22:24] If you want to know the nature of God,
[1:22:26] you won't find it outside of humility.
[1:22:29] He said, "I I am the lofty one, yet I
[1:22:32] dwell with the humble
[1:22:34] to them that are broken and contrite. I
[1:22:36] get real low.
[1:22:40] I I came I came to seek those that were
[1:22:44] lost."
[1:22:49] Can you imagine if Jesus told his
[1:22:51] disciples, "I want you to go find a
[1:22:53] person, and all you do, I want you to
[1:22:54] spend the rest of your life trying to
[1:22:56] get them to me." That's not what he
[1:22:59] said. His instructions was, "Go yell and
[1:23:01] preach it to everybody."
[1:23:07] Now, I tell you, every single person I
[1:23:08] have ever known,
[1:23:13] they do not mind you serving them
[1:23:15] forever.
[1:23:19] Whether they're Christian or
[1:23:20] non-Christian,
[1:23:22] everybody wants to be served.
[1:23:25] But God gave us a commission. And it was
[1:23:27] for the great commission. We need to be
[1:23:30] thinking about inviting people to
[1:23:31] church, inviting people to the truth,
[1:23:34] inviting people to this message.
[1:23:37] That is our job.
[1:23:40] And it is is a responsibility not from
[1:23:43] Pastor John, but from Jesus Christ. He's
[1:23:46] the one that spoke it. We're
[1:23:48] ambassadors.
[1:23:50] That's what happens when you become born
[1:23:52] again and old things are passed away and
[1:23:55] behold all things become new. We become
[1:23:58] ambassadors for Jesus Christ. We now
[1:24:00] bring other people to the same place
[1:24:02] we're at. And I wonder sometimes why
[1:24:04] we're not bringing people to where we're
[1:24:07] at.
[1:24:09] Are you with me? It's getting awful
[1:24:11] quiet in here. [laughter]
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I think God is calling us higher.
[1:24:18] All right. Philippians chapter 2. Well,
[1:24:20] the time is up, but you know what? I'm
[1:24:22] not up
[1:24:26] because um I'm waiting for the other
[1:24:28] people come back to church that left.
[1:24:32] Philippians chapter 2 verse number two.
[1:24:39] Yes, you bear with me just a little bit.
[1:24:40] Okay, will you do that? Okay. How you do
[1:24:43] that is you say amen a lot.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And you don't get too quiet on me. say,
[1:24:49] "I'm hungry for this. I want to hear
[1:24:50] what you got to say."
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; I've been praying for this all week.
[1:24:54] Philippians chapter 2 verse two,
[1:24:56] speaking here of the very image of Jesus
[1:24:59] Christ who we are to become. Fulfill ye
[1:25:02] my joy and be likeminded. Verse two
[1:25:05] says, "Having the same love, being of
[1:25:07] one accord and of one mind, let nothing
[1:25:10] be done through strife or vain glory.
[1:25:14] But in loneliness of mind, let each
[1:25:17] esteem the other better than themselves.
[1:25:20] Our youth had a little bit of this,
[1:25:21] didn't they? Our our goal as a a a
[1:25:27] Christian is to become more like Christ,
[1:25:29] which is to not think about ourselves.
[1:25:32] Is not to do things through, hey, look
[1:25:34] at me. Look at me. I'm better. Strife,
[1:25:36] vain glory, but to actually care about
[1:25:39] other people. Look not every man on his
[1:25:41] own things, but every man also on the
[1:25:44] things of others. Let this mind be in
[1:25:45] you which was also in in Christ Jesus.
[1:25:48] Verse eight, but he made himself of no
[1:25:51] reputation
[1:25:53] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:25:56] and was made in the likeness of men. And
[1:25:58] he and he be and being found in fashion
[1:26:00] as a man, he humbled himself and became
[1:26:03] obedient to death, even the death of the
[1:26:05] cross.
[1:26:07] Now Jesus said the the father doth love
[1:26:10] me. Why does the father love me? He said
[1:26:14] because I lay my life down.
[1:26:19] You want God to love you? Lay your life
[1:26:21] down for your brothers and sisters. For
[1:26:23] someone that doesn't know Christ
[1:26:25] continuing to to read in that images of
[1:26:28] Christ, brother Ram says, "What a
[1:26:29] difference of the so-called reflecting
[1:26:32] Christian today." What a difference. Why
[1:26:35] the so-called Christian today, he wants
[1:26:38] to be served. Oh, he begins to think
[1:26:41] he's somebody.
[1:26:43] What a difference from it was when he uh
[1:26:46] when he reflected him. He never come in
[1:26:48] to be ministered, but he came to
[1:26:50] minister.
[1:26:51] Let he that's greatest among you
[1:26:55] be the servant of all. Brother Bram's
[1:26:58] quoting. And when he had seen today, and
[1:27:01] we have seen today that our modern trend
[1:27:03] of Christianity is I'm somebody and
[1:27:07] you're nothing.
[1:27:09] That's what modern Christianity is. Oh,
[1:27:13] it's a it's wrong. It should not be that
[1:27:16] way. We're trying to reflect
[1:27:17] Christianity in the wrong way. God
[1:27:20] doesn't want us to do it that way. We
[1:27:22] sang that song to be like Jesus. And
[1:27:24] when it comes to humbleing our pride and
[1:27:26] to get down like he did, that's where we
[1:27:29] draw the line. In other words, we don't
[1:27:31] give him liberty there. The door is
[1:27:34] still shut.
[1:27:37] And in doing so, man has formed
[1:27:40] denominations. And if I could just say
[1:27:42] it like this, I don't mean just church
[1:27:44] denominations,
[1:27:46] but boundaries between other people. You
[1:27:49] know, there's a lot of people in this
[1:27:51] message who have denominations.
[1:27:54] I'm speaking the truth. They have a
[1:27:56] denominational spirit.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; They separate themselves from others.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; But they feel comfortable because
[1:28:06] they're somebody and they got a powerful
[1:28:08] revelation about the message.
[1:28:11] It's he says brother Brandon says
[1:28:15] seemingly having not the spirit as the
[1:28:20] scriptures say they separate themselves
[1:28:21] we belong to certain so and so church we
[1:28:24] belong to this church we belong to that
[1:28:25] church and our churches is greater he
[1:28:28] said that doesn't act that doesn't act
[1:28:31] like Jesus that that doesn't reflect his
[1:28:36] love and his personality if I could say
[1:28:37] it like this his character
[1:28:40] Jesus Jesus said, "A new commandment I
[1:28:42] give unto you, that you love one another
[1:28:44] as I have loved you. By this shall all
[1:28:46] men know you're my disciples, when you
[1:28:48] have love one for another."
[1:28:52] God's character is what we are to
[1:28:54] become. And the only way to become that
[1:28:57] is to recognize that this is your
[1:29:02] responsibility. And the only way to get
[1:29:04] that is to let his spirit to come inside
[1:29:06] you. We can't we can't act like it. It
[1:29:12] has to become him. So God is interested
[1:29:14] in that that personal relationship to
[1:29:16] where we say, "Jesus, come into my
[1:29:18] heart. I want to become more one with
[1:29:20] you. I want to get serious about this. I
[1:29:22] want to become in your image."
[1:29:26] Now, we've been predestinated to it.
[1:29:31] All that was in God, he poured into
[1:29:32] Christ.
[1:29:35] God was manifested in the flesh in Jesus
[1:29:38] Christ and Jesus has prayed for us that
[1:29:40] we would become one with him
[1:29:43] and we're I believe the bride the true
[1:29:45] bride of Jesus Christ is in the process
[1:29:48] of becoming like Jesus in the same image
[1:29:51] the same character you know you think
[1:29:54] about the scripture says if the
[1:29:57] righteous scarcely make it scarcely I'm
[1:30:00] tell if there's a fire in here and the
[1:30:02] last person makes it out. His pants are
[1:30:05] like singed with fire. I would say he
[1:30:09] scarcely made it.
[1:30:11] And if the righteous scarcely make it,
[1:30:13] what's happened to those who are just
[1:30:15] flopping around
[1:30:17] just not really putting their heart into
[1:30:19] it? They've been deceived thinking that
[1:30:22] they're okay. And that's the spirit of
[1:30:24] this age, Leodysa, in need of nothing.
[1:30:27] And that's the thing that we got to
[1:30:28] fight. We must go on to perfection. We
[1:30:31] must look at our life and say, "Am I am
[1:30:33] I humble? Am I truly humble? Do I have
[1:30:35] that nature or do I have something
[1:30:37] rising up inside of me that wants to be
[1:30:39] um better than others or cut others down
[1:30:42] or think I don't need this?" I mean,
[1:30:44] that is what we really need. What we
[1:30:47] really should be doing. All right, let's
[1:30:49] stand together. [clears throat]
[1:30:55] The children of God are going to
[1:30:56] manifest the true spirit of humility.
[1:31:01] They're going to exercise agape love.
[1:31:04] The same love that God loved them with.
[1:31:06] They're going to exercise it in love.
[1:31:09] They're going to manifest it.
[1:31:14] How many wants to manifest that?
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; It's my desire, too. I'm right with you.
[1:31:21] I'm right there. I want to be more like
[1:31:23] Jesus.
