good to be in God's house to be in his presence and I I feel his presence this morning not that we go by feelings but it's it's good when you feel his presence too it just it's a blessing um we certainly appreciate the time that we had yesterday evening and I I followed his presence during that little uh time that we had uh talking about Israel and uh the fellowship we just are grateful for God's goodness to us amen if you would turn with me into Bible to the Book of James chapter 4. amen amen maybe before we begin reading in God's booklets just bow in a word of prayer and as for his his grace to be with us now Heavenly Father we we do thank you that these doors are open and and that we could gather together today and you've given us health and strength there our others today Lord that would desire to be here but are not because of health reasons and other reasons and we just ask that the Holy Spirit would be with them in a very special way Lord that um they don't have to be here Lord when they can't be here and I know that you're able Lord to visit them and reveal to them your great love and give them strength and support and and direct them for their lives Lord we just ask you you would be with each one be with uh brother Roger and sister Trisha as they're traveling back home Lord father Lord all those that would be in a back sliding condition Lord we ask that you would be with them too that you would speak to their hearts in this late hour and call them back to the house of the Lord to you Lord to fellowship with you Lord as we look into your word today Lord we are truly hopeless without you we're helpless without you we need you Lord we need you we need you to give us revelation of these words draw Us close to you father bless the reading of your word to each of our hearts Lord we ask that you take control of our lips our mind and Lord that we would speak only those things that you would have to be spoken and father at the end of the service in the days to come we will give you the glory and the honor for all these things for we humbly pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen James chapter 4. I want to read just the first verse and then drop down to verse 5 from whence cometh Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lust that war in your members now I want to entitle this message my closest walk we all want a closer walk with the Lord but there there are things that uh are warring against us from having that close walk and there's things that we have to do to get the close walk we understand that um there's a battle and we have to to to win the battle to get the closer walk amen verse five do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envir to ill will to do our own will but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God Amen amen that's the first thing then resist the devil and he will flee from you so there's a submission that's required draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh unto you and how do we draw an eye to God cleanse your hands you Sinners purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned a morning in your joy to heaviness so he's describing to us that the act of humility that needs to transpire before our Closer Walk humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up amen amen God bless you may be seated by Brother Branham made mention that God would not take a man until he is most ready so he's not going to take a soul until it's most ready that gives us confidence and when we're talking about our closest walk our closest walk could be at that time it could be because we think about Enoch and he walked with with in the testimony that he walked with the Lord every day and as we're told that he just he kept walking closer and closer and closer and he he was walking so close to God that he was actually walking closer to Heaven than Earth and God just took him and I I believe that's you know we're all waiting for the coming Lord we're waiting for the Rapture we're waiting for things to happen but as we're waiting we should be drawing closer to God because that's what we need to get ready turn with me if you would to First John chapter one and this was going to be my my opening scripture but uh uh we're gonna put these together now brother Branham did say that that if we grieve the Holy Spirit which we can we can grieve the Lord um and displease them and if we begin to do things that we shouldn't brother Branham taught us that the holy spirit will will kind of take its flight go sit on a line or a pole and he'll just stay there and watch until we're ready to change our attitude and our nature and um so God allows three more agency to transpire in us but that doesn't mean that he's always going to be there you know there are things that we have to do to keep God happy and and when we go off to do our own will uh the flesh is enmity with God so there's not going to be any any true connection there so we have to be somewhat conscious and caring about what kind of attitude we're packing and how we're how how we feel at all times all right first John chapter 1 verse 1 says um uh that that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon with our hands uh and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested we seen it bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and that truly our fellowship is with the father and and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full there's a purpose that we're writing it this then is the message which we have heard of him and declaring to you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all none if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins and if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from our unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US amen those are these are some very powerful scriptures and I had a thought where I was going to be going for this Sunday and I just felt Lord I need to hear from you yeah I could go with this uh that it was going to go with that says that's not good enough for me it would have been the word it would have been truth and it would have been I believe edifying but I wasn't satisfied with that I wanted to hear from God and when this this set of scriptures came to me I knew he was in it and I can have confidence today that we're not just hearing the word of God being preached but we're here in a Pacific a specific word that God wants for us in this church we can have confidence in that Christ is the word the Bible says in John 1 1 that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning and all things were made by him without him there there was nothing made that was made in Colossians 1 tells us for you don't have to turn here but but we're just going to be uh sharing some scriptures for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are Earth visible and invisible whether it be Thrones Dominion principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him we're talking about the greatness of our God that was in the beginning amen we're going somewhere with this for he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church so who is the head of our church who's the true Shepherd of the church that's right that's right who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence Christ is supposed to have the preeminence in here there's a lot of times we feel that things should be this way or that way or this is we understand that there's a difference is that we all have but Christ is the one that must have preeminence so when we're talking about I want a closer walk with God I want to be drawn closer to God he needs to have preeminence we need to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he could be preeminent amen amen all right first John or John chapter 1 verse 4 going back to that in him was life in him was life and the life was the light of men his life becomes our light when his Spirit comes in US that is our light not the knowledge of the word now the understanding of the word but his Spirit his life becomes our light amen and the light shineth in dark plate in darkness and darkness comprehended it not wow like how many times have we heard light okay so I remember as you all know we all experience things like this when I first came to to Christ and I learned that I that having my long hair was not according to the gospel it was not according to light and I remember thinking that's strange what does my hair have anything to do with my relationship with God so the darkness inside of me was not comprehending the light but light still light so God requires us to walk in the light not to understand the light understanding comes down the road right now we know according to Saint John chapter 1 verse 14 the word that was in the beginning it was made flesh and it dwelt among us and we Behold The Glory we bear out his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of what Grace and Truth the invisible word of God became visible for Humanity to see in Jesus Christ that's why the prophet said if you can't see Jesus Christ in every scripture go back and read it because we miss something he is the word he's in every scripture he's he's he's hidden these scriptures but it is him it is his word you can have confidence when you're reading that that's God [Music] now the life of the word has been manifested you can have the word without the life that's the tree of knowledge you can have the word and yet not do you any good the scripture tells us for the letter killeth but the spirit of the word is what gives life so we want to focus on the life of the word because the knowledge of the word is just going to condemn us going to make us feel defeated we not obeying but we want is the life of it and that has to do with our heart falling in love with God it is the spirit of God because the word is beautiful when you read it but if your heart is not I want to I want this word in me I want to please the Lord I want to I want to have fellowship with him well then you're you're you're losing the spirit part of the word so that the letter will eventually kill us you know condemn us convict convict us and will just feel like um discouraged and down but you get in the presence of God and your your heart just is yearning to have this inside living and manifested and walking into light well then that spirit is what has given us light his spirit is the light of man that's right so the spirit of the word was manifested and it became the light for men to walk in and now the disciples had bore witness of this invisible God becoming visible to them they handled they touched this invisible word of God they looked upon it they looked upon the invisible word because now it was manifested they seen Miracles after Miracles take place the dead were raised the dumb speak the the death here the bodies were restored Jesus taught and astonished the religious people of his day when he was 12 years old Nicodemus said we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him you know the greatest miracle that these disciples witnessed wasn't Lazarus raising from the dead wasn't the 5 000 being fed it wasn't the creation of fishes it wasn't the Discerning of men's hearts they didn't just witness the power of creation they witnessed the power of restoration which really teaches us a lot about the nature of God God is not a God to throw away the clay right if it don't work out he just don't go I'm done with it Philippians 1 6 is being confident of this very thing he which had begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ Hebrews 13 5 he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen he's not throwing us away just because of the flaws he doesn't throw away the clay because of the flaws he'll fix them his blood will cover them but he's not throwing it away Romans 8 39 nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing we need to receive more of the spirit of God not just the knowledge of God but the spirit of God and the love of God is shed abroad in our heart by what the spirit of God the spirit of the word the spirit of the word is what gives us that love to love others yes to to to to um turn the cheat to go the second mile to to to to to overlook certain things because that love covers is still covering today there's still Power in the Blood sure is John 1 12 says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believed on his name all we do is receive him but truly receive the word into our life you can't receive Christ without receiving the word amen which were born not of blood nor the will of Flesh nor of the will man but of God so we must be born again of the spirit of God we need a a different Spirit to be motivating us I understand that you know this seems like a very hard thing but we're talking about something very serious and this is our soul our soul is never going to get perfected by our efforts we need to die out to our efforts we need to surrender our life to God and we need to God to come in and create a new nature inside of us amen just trying to encourage you here John chapter 10 verse 28 says and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand My Father which is which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand about the security that we have in Christ I mean the power of regeneration which is really what transpires in all of our lives we were not created perfect like Adam we were we were created with ugly natures and to be honest with you is our opening scripture it pops out once in a while really does but we're in the process of being transformed amen regenerated into a new creature where all things are passed away behold all things are not just new but they're of God and God is holding us so that no matter how many times we fall or slip or get away or backslide or have wrong thoughts God is not throwing away the clay thank you the bride is secure but she's not relaxed in laodicea amen she's anchored but she's always abounding in the work of the Lord God doesn't throw away the clay just because of the flaws he's not going to throw us away just because of I know we all feel like we got problems that is beyond everybody else's we all feel that way it's a natural way of feeling but God is not looking at those things his focus is on getting us regenerated and that needs to be our Focus he's just going to put us back on the potter's wheel we need it you know if we don't we that flaw will stay there we have to be in his complete image right now Ephesians 5 27 God is going to present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish wow that's a I know we read that scripture and we think how in the world am I going to become that in ourselves it is impossible and as long as we're in this this Cockapoo this pest house it will be a pest to the Deep desires of our heart but what happens is because that of that true statement and not having a revelation of what that really means the devil often convinces us when nobody's perfect so you know you know we're all we're just going to have these flaws so you know that is anti-word it is anti the spirit of of Christ God wants us pressing in and walking in all the light that he puts in front of us and the more that you humble yourself the closer you get to God and the more that it's it's not that big a thing well then you're not going to have that close walk with the Lord that he has for you you see too many Christians giving up on helping other Christians just because of their flaws they'd rather work with someone with less problems someone that required less of their time someone that listened to them a little bit more agreed with them a little bit more someone they actually enjoyed being with when they discipled in other words their idea of Christianity is flawed brother Branham said in the message a man running from the presence of the Lord he said Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of God in the heart that sets you of fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts to Christ I want you to think about this statement if you're going to make a convert to somebody they're not converted yet right which means they're in their old nature full of problems and if you think all you have to do is just say Jesus loves you it's going to take more than that that is not a hard rugged life you're going to need the burning of the fire of God to get you out there washing the feet of those who are dirty [Music] see when we can see that this is how much Christ loves us and he don't throw away the clay why are we to have an attitude of somebody less than us because we think they're flawed too flawed I think if Christ lives in me he's going to love that person the way that he loves them when he's not living in me right don't you think we all have this picture on which God loves us but you have that same picture of of God loving them through you that's the picture that needs to be seen because without a vision the people perish you need to possess that and that's that ain't your knowledge by the way that's the Holy Ghost inside of you loving them because if you love them with your love you're just going to stop when you've had enough lots of Christians don't really accept their responsibility as being a Christian but brother Brandon says You must accept your responsibility it's what he said in that message a man running from the presence of the Lord now let's think about it if that nature of the Holy Ghost was in every one of us that nature of well that person's too flawed I don't want to deal with them they bother me none of us would be here today how do we adapt a different attitude for others than God has towards us that's why we need to Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord too many Christians think that God loves them more than their fall flawed bystanders God is no respecter of persons what he's done for you he'll do for others we sang the song what God has done for others he'll do for you but I'm telling you what God has done for you he'll do for others he cares the question is do we care too many Believers Never learned what it means to live for others they've they've interpreted carnally instead of truly living for others too selfish they're too busy too much in love with themselves to really give up their lives for others now these disciples had witnessed this nature of God in Jesus Christ this word that was in the beginning became flesh and they were witnessing this nature not just in creation now but in regeneration this great love that he had amen it wasn't only the the glory of his creative power but it was the power of regeneration they didn't only witness God's nature being expressed in truth and righteousness but it was being expressed in Grace in Mercy in love in in in in the aspect that you don't need that to create something you only need that to restore something amen for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten the father full of grace was first then truth Grace was first then truth let your conversation always be with Grace so often we just want to true true truth but I tell you the devil he'll speak truth right he'll speak enough truth to condemn you he'll he'll he'll give you enough truth to make you feel you ain't worth a thing that you're not in the father's hand that you're you're not saved this thing isn't real in your life yeah he'll give you enough truth to unite with your feelings and before you know it no Grace if you're speaking without Grace take a step back Jesus Christ was full of grace and truth eternal life came down and was manifested in the realm of this temporary life it was manifested with flesh and blood this eternal God that was invisible now became visible and they were they were beholding and they were handling they were touching they were coming in Fellowship with it are you with me amen and when eternal life comes in to live in a body of Flesh it will change its worldly nature it will not stay it will not allow the old nature to stay there now I'm not saying you know the the he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh that's true and he will come and His blessings will fall into Justice and unjust but when the Holy sorry confesses I've got the Holy Ghost and God is living in me you can automatically expect that your nature is going to be changing because God won't allow it to stay that way and it will keep happening until you're out of here I mean God is on a one-track mind He Wants You In His Image that's the track he's on all right let's just take a look at these scriptures and I know they're not maybe for for for for all of us here but I I just for those that it might be I want to read them Ezekiel 36 verse 26 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit well I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh you know what it's like when you're talking to somebody and they're just hard at you or sometimes you know you've been hard at somebody you just can't control it well God promised to take that out and give us a heart of Flesh he says and I will put my spirit within you and I will cause you and I will let you do your own thing no but I will cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them that's what's going to happen when you say I got the Holy Ghost Hebrews 8 10 for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their minds and write them into their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people you talk about sweet Fellowship and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest now this is where God is heading this is where God is heading all right first John chapter 2 verse 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it have taught you ye shall abide in him now John's coming out and saying the Eternal Word of God is now living in you it is very capable of unveiling what you should be doing the way you should be living the things that you should be doing you do not need to be told by any man but why do we have to be told by a man because we're focusing on the part of eternal life that gets us to heaven and we're not very interested on the part that if we love them we'll keep the Commandments you know why did Jesus say hey if you love me keep my commands he didn't say hey why'd I say that but you know he why do you say Peter you love me Peter you love me Peter you love me Peter thought he loved God so much that he would die for him kill form and when Jesus said that's not how you express it he didn't know what to do with himself hey basically what crazy in his mind started denying them to a great degree so I'm telling you the holy ghost that is here among us we should be in connection with the Holy Ghost because he's the one that's trying to speak to you he's the one that's trying to teach you there may be a man up here behind the pulpit but we've got to believe the Holy Ghost is trying to speak to us that's right and if you can if you can get connected to that Spirit there get your eyes off the flesh let the Holy Ghost s teach you all right John 16 13 says how be it when he the spirit of Truth come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever ye shall hear he shall speak in that he will show you things to come so here it is Jesus himself says when the spirit of truths come he's going to guide you so uh how many times you've been in situations I don't know what to do I don't know how to handle this I don't know what to do with this situation I don't know what to say what is needing is the Holy Ghost nothing else because we have a promise that he will lead and guide us into all truth not just the doctrine of the Bible if we spent more time seeking the Holy Ghost give God a chance to be a teacher in your life amen give God a chance to come in and show himself how great a God he is to you personally we allow the devil to convince us that as long as we learn from the man that I just say it like this I I question that our nature is ever going to get changed God's not going to share his glory with no no man but if we believe what is being spoken is the Holy Ghost personally to us then we can expect that change to take place in our life the key is becoming more serious about fellowshipping with the Holy Ghost fellowshipping with the Holy Ghost now Everyone likes Fellowship right we all want Fellowship I'll tell you God loves Fellowship too that's right and he's jealous when he doesn't get it too often our fellowship with one another is missing the most important ingredient foreign and specifically how we can become more like him that is the most important ingredient to Fellowship how to walk closer to Jesus how to get more ready to meet him because ultimately that day is coming and I know Satan wants to tell us you know hey we're all going we're predestinated I understand that but why would Jesus be saying many will come to me in that day or be ready I'm coming in an hour you think not why was he saying those things because there's another side to that thinking why did Paul have to press towards the Mark if he already was on the bullseye so if I listen to the prophet and I hear him talking about turning over every stone and be sure and make sure and stay there and I I think he they're sending a message you know Jesus said before he left I'm coming soon well that was a long time ago did he miss represent no we need to live our life I don't care what church age we're in we need to live our life like he's coming soon because we only got so many hours and so many days to get ready and we don't even know what they are but and Satan wants to tell us that we we've got forever and if you talk to anybody who's under their Deathbed or or somebody that something happened if I would have known this I would have taken care of my body I would have I would have done this I would have done that right if they knew well I'm telling you we know Jesus is coming soon we need to we need to put that most important ingredient into our fellowship it needs to become more serious with some of us amen foreign John and these disciples were fellowshipping with the most important ingredient here in first John chapter 1 verse 3 that which you have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full Joy doesn't come just because we want it right there's a price you have to pay for joy the Bible talks about weeping may last during the night right we may have to just stay with God in his and call upon him and plead but we have a promise that Joy comes in the morning John 15 verse 10 if you keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love even as I've kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things I have spoken unto you this this these things of keeping Commandments this important thing of of keeping the cycle of of Commandments going these things I've spoken unto you that my joy might remain with you and that your joy might be full we see God's heart that he wants us to have joy and he wants it to be full but he's not going to give it if we're not going to keep his Commandments and walk in the light as he speaks to us it just it's just scripture now this is my commandment that ye love one another as I loved you so now he's going back to the Commandment this is what he wants us to keep I want you to love one another exactly the same way I've loved you in other words don't think that somebody's got too much flaws to spend time helping when you think all you got to do is get on your knees no matter what and say God forgive me my sins I need you but you won't take time to go help somebody then we wonder why we don't have the joy of the Lord Greater Love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends now tell me do you got that love do you amen it's a decision that you make with your time you give your life what is your life well we know it's a vapor might as well give it give for others live for others what does that mean brother John get into the tapes with not just to listen to the tapes you can listen those tapes all day all the time and never ever come to eternal life now the thing is you when you put that tape on you've got to have a desire Lord show me how to live for others show me how to live for others show me how to love others exactly the way you love them show me because that's what those tapes are for those tapes are to get us ready for a rapture and nothing but perfect love is going in there Jesus is stressing to us to receive and to walk in all of the nature of God that he shows us that's what he's he's getting across here Greater Love have no man than this then a man lay down his life this is the nature of God he gave his son for us and he's stressing to us I want you to do that same thing for others I say our attention needs to be put towards that it's important to God it's got to be important to us and this this really happens in so simply it happens by us walking in the light that he shows us yes whatever God speaks to you just do it just do it don't think about it don't put it off to another time don't say I'm going to let God deal with me for who just get serious about doing it God wants our joy to be full do you believe that Psalm 16 verse 11 thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more well he's showing us the path of life here he's showing us how to get joy it's about walking in the light amen first John chapter 1 verse 5 or opening scripture this then is the message which we have heard and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all this is so hard for us to comprehend here's a God who knows everything yes sees all the evil knows all the evil but doesn't look on it doesn't think about it doesn't get enticed by it there's just no darkness in his thinking he thinks no ill of his neighbors he takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked a God that's only light there's just no darkness in him isn't a beautiful scripture amen Jesus is the light of the world pilate said I find no fault in them when John saw the city in Revelations 21 he said the city had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof he is uh his spirit is our light this disciple John who now had received eternal life was declaring this message unto us the reader that God is lighting him there's no Darkness at all and I hope you can say Amen to the scripture the nature of God is not to allow any Darkness to be in his life he won't allow it he won't pacify it he won't make excuses for it God is light and in him is no Darkness at all and if we say that we have fellowship with him and we walk in not all the light that has been shown to us we're actually we're not in the truth they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth well that could be a little bit different say for all of us in the aspect of God may have shown you a lot more truth than he's shown me but what he has shown you you need to walk in it and that makes your worship as great as it can be but if you're if I'm not walking in all the truth that God has shown me I honestly can't be worshiping him in the truth I don't care if I'm in the message or not I don't care what I Proclaim I've got to walk in the light of the word and we want to have a a revelation of this scripture no none of us here without things in our lives that we don't want out we're all here we all have things in our life that we wish were there we don't want them there we've tried to get rid of them yet we claim that we have fellowship with them all the time I want us to pay attention to the things that are in our life that we haven't put much heart into getting rid of those are the things I want to talk about got awful quiet do you remember God's still here still his message the message from eternity is that if we're confessing that we have fellowship with God while allowing some Darkness to remain in our life that Fellowship is not really what we think it is because we will always Proclaim push comes to shove you will fight for what you believe in but the truth of the matter is if we're not walking in the things that God has spoken to us we don't have quite the fellowship that we think we have in him is no Darkness at all God don't allow darkness in his life if you're fellowshipping with God today he's going to be fellowshipping with you about getting the darkness out of your life why because in him there's no darkness and if you're as bright you don't want darkness in you amen amen so he's going to be fellowshipping with you about the things that he wants out of your life now it's easy for you to say well brother John you have this problem and I understand that I do but we all should be saying it's not my brother not my sister oh Lord but it's me that's standing in the need of prayer we need to come to church with only rakes no pitchforks no shovels no dump trucks no bulldozers but a rake it in I don't want to walk in darkness darkness is nothing but the Devil in Disguise we need to stop making excuses for allowing darkness in our life for allowing the things in her life that are there we've just we've we learn to tolerate them there's things that are still hanging around the things that we baby or cuddle or pacify maybe some dirty habit or maybe some lukewarmness maybe just not wanting to give more of our time to get serious with God I don't know what it might be for us individually but it's important that you know and that you learn to get that Darkness out because God's trying to get us to the next place and he wants his fellowship with his bride to be sweet just lovely beautiful but if that darkness is there and you're not dealing with it but the Holy Ghost is just you see that war that's going on that's why we need to Humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord to get serious about those things because God has to work through few more agency there's a part of us honestly that don't mind having darkness in our life it's enjoyable it's pleasurous if it wasn't we wouldn't be doing it right so we have to be the one that say I'm done with this I wanted you I want to be closer to God than I've ever been in my life I want to be closer to God than I've ever been in my life and I want to remain there in order to do that I got to walk in the light as he is in the light and then I can have that True Fellowship with him darkness is nothing but the Devil in Disguise God hates Darkness there's no darkness in heaven that's why Jesus taught us to pray thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven there's no darkness in there he doesn't allow it he kicked it out we got to kick it out when he made creation he separated the dark and the light separated it we got to separate it we're separators God has entrusted you to take care of your vessel I might be honest with you you don't need me and I don't need you we don't need one another to be blurt now what we think we the others should be getting rid of but we got the Holy Ghost I got confidence that God speaks to our heart that there is a realness that happens but there's also a realness of pushing back I don't need to go to the altar I don't need to get serious I don't need to why because men love Darkness rather than light that old nature that we were born with loved Darkness why because it did its own thing you can do your own thing when nobody knows about it right when nobody's watching you can look at whatever you want to look at God bless sister Johnson you can look whatever you want to look at at the internet right you can go to somebody shake their hand say God bless you turn around and have the worst thought about that person because nobody knows see Darkness is just a disguise where the dirty work can be done I hope you love the word problem with our old nature it just tolerates Darkness it tolerates it unless it's bothering me like if brother Mark don't put the tools away when he's done using them oh man that bothers me I'm gonna tell him he better do his job but it's okay for me to leave the twos out you understand how that works it's just an ugly nature John chapter 1 verse 4 in him was life John chapter 1 verse 4 in him was life and the life was the light of men and that light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not now I want to go to Saint John 3 16 what we say the most probably preach scripture in the Bible and I want to look at this in a different way in the way that we've been ministering today God sent his son to save the world John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him they should not perish but have everlasting life but the world has to believe like the scriptures teach us to believe right because the Devils believe and they tremble so they don't got eternal life so the belief that we need to believe is a belief of Walking In The Light being obedient to the word of God Amen the devils are not going to walk in the light they hate the light they know they know the light they know the truth they'll speak the truth but they won't walk it so the way that we receive eternal life is we love the light we walk in the light that's why we repent we get baptized we agree with the scriptures my life was wrong I repent but it don't stop there Satan wants it to stop there but the bride is going under perfection all right verse 17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved through him notice through him and he that believeth on him is not condemned he that believeth on him is not condemned if you truly believe Lord I'm trying to do everything I can but he that believeth not I don't need to do that is condemned already because he have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil they were born with this nature of just doing what they want to do and that's why we must be born again that's why we must get serious about getting more of the Holy Ghost some of us just need to get the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you those of you that got the Holy Ghost every one of you that got the Holy Ghost say I praise God for that would you pray for me that I get more Holy Ghost I know I need it it's just there and I don't want to ever make it sound like you know you need more than what you got that is not my my Ministry to you but I do believe that I need more and I want to be like Paul I want to press towards that Mark I'm not satisfied until awaken his likeness and in His image verse 20. for everyone that doeth evil hateth light see you go to do something bad you don't want nobody to know about what do you do don't tell anybody keep it covered don't say right is this this is just natural right okay neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be reproofed so I'll say this I know that when I Repent of something that I'm like I'm this thing's over I want it on my life even if I fall seven times and seven times I get back up when I've made a decision I'm truly repenting this I feel free of that thing but when I just know that it's not really I'm not to that spot of humbling myself before the Lord and I allow that thing in my life well I'm not coming to the light I'm not walking in that light and so therefore there's a separation between me and God John 15 talks about that abiding in the vine but that that Fellowship is not as sweet as God and wants it to be he if we're having fellowship with God he's working on taking care of the darkness out of our life amen that's where he's at now we got to be there with him amen the true light came to the disciples Amen Let me just uh read verse 21 but he that do a truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be manifest that they are wrought in God thank you so this light came to the disciples and the disciples came to us with the same light that we've got to walk in all all the light we can't be satisfied with having these things in our life and I'll say to you as Isaiah said in chapter 53 who have believed our report and to whom is this truth revealed to this word that we're hearing today honestly for our spiritual walk ought to make us the most excited this is the avenue to getting the closest that we've ever been to God this is it there is no other way this is the straight and narrow path as it were this is the message that we've heard from the beginning in declare unto you that God is light and him is no Darkness off we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth God's light demands us to walk in it that's what the light demands and we've got to say God what you're saying that's my the final amen that's what I'm going with I'm not going to sit here and think about it how many times we've come to church we heard the truth and we just like Okay so I mean we're saying we have fellowship with the Lord but if we walk in the light I love this scripture as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another amen and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin the requirement for the blood to cleanse us from all sin is obedience to all the light that we know that's why when you came to Jesus when I came to Jesus and I had drinking smoking behind me I had long hair I had everything that you can imagine hanging on me there just wasn't no good in me because it was just an ugly nature but when I repented and I said God I want you in my life I want to give up my life I Surrender it to you I want to receive you as my personal savior I got baptized with long hair I came up to the altar with long hair I listened to tapes with long hair I had records I loved worldly music foreign and I'll tell you those of you that are discipling others you know if you give too much light to somebody at one time you'll blame them and I'm so glad that I I was under a mature Ministry that had confidence that God can speak to the hearts of men amen give God a chance give God a chance but I'll tell you as God began to deal with me I began to walk in the light yeah yeah no I'll tell you I'm not real I wish this was a little bit shorter here but I'd be honest with you I never went back to long hair I just kept walking in it but you know I had so many other things to walk in and I'll tell you when I hear that worldly music playing sometimes think yeah I remember that one that was a cool one I really like that one what are you doing you know the flash will always be attracted to the world that that old nature it's a battle the spirits in us are fighting and and we just simply got to Humble ourselves before the Lord you're finding not enough strength to battle that thing we'll spend more time praying just get away and Worship the Lord just say God I love you I want to I want the closest walk I've ever had with you amen I want to go in that direction Lord you show me how to do it because I believe you live in me speak to me help me get get on your knees and call upon God God Is So merciful right if we walk in the light as he is in the light then he cleanses us from all of our sin will we still keep making them yes will you fall will you do some of the same things over yes you will but you'll get up and you'll keep walking towards the light that's always require and he's not looking for perfection in the flesh that'll never happen but he is looking for a perfect attitude he really is I just want to read the last two scriptures and tell this short story and then we're closing verse 8 says if we say unto him we have no sin we deceive ourself and the truth is not in us if we confess your sins he is faithful and he is just to forgive us of our wrongs and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness now that is a precious promise not confessed I just did it but confess that I've allowed this thing to just Ling around and now I'm ready to get serious with God brother Brian told the story one time when he would uh end up go when he went out hunting he would end up getting deer for other other people who some I think sometimes really even needed them he's really doing a good deed it was good intentions but God gave him a word and he told them not to do that anymore and so when he went out hunting he just got what he needed for himself and uh I'm sure brother Johnson could tell the story a lot better than I could I wish I would have read it but you're going to get the gist of the story one time he was In This Storm and the snow was flying and and and and and uh I'm not sure if he got lost but uh there was a big storm and after the end of the the storm um uh God met him God met him his I believe his tears were Fallen under dry leaves and maybe he spoke to the storm I can't remember if that was the time but I do remember this that God met him and God asked him um have you um have you shot any dear for anyone he said no I I haven't I've I've kept your commandment I've done what you asked me to do he said well I've kept my commandment I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you it was like an arrangement of Fellowship but really what caught my attention was afterwards when God spoke to Brother Brian says would you like to walk with me right would you like to walk with me brother bran said that'd be the greatest privilege I've ever had and it had to do with keeping his word keeping his word it's more important than what we think it's not maybe important to us but it's important to God and if it's important to God it must get important to us amen let's Stand Together if you want the closest walk that you've ever had put all your heart into walking in the things that God speaks to you it may be just one thing in a week one thing in the service one thing in a month one thing you listen to that tape but just try to do it with all your heart you'll see that your walk will just be getting closer to God your fellowship will be sweeter you have more joy more peace things will begin to open up and ultimately we're walking to a rapture we're walking into a rapture and and we we have a big part but I know we're waiting for God to just but we have a part to play until that happens and I believe this is this is what we need right here to see that fulfilled amen amen um let's just sing Shine Jesus Shine can we sing that one I know I didn't tell you that one Shine Jesus Shine amen how many thankful for the light of God amen and his mercies he's been so good to us so long suffering Lord the light of your love is shining in the midst of the darkness shining Jesus light of the world shine upon us set us

just be crucified that you may just get more serious before the Lord and your desire to to come God's provided way I just want you to unite with with me in prayer I believe it's I believe it's the desire of every one of our hearts if I were to ask lifting their hands I I believe just almost every hand would be lifted I'm I'm sure God sees our our hearts and let's just pray together and let's believe that as this word has come forth this prayer we're just going to receive it and and seal this desire in our hearts who we we see it come to pass and we're walking in more of the light of God

would give us the grace to spend more time with you in prayer that we could just have the courage the boldness to say uh Satan get behind me I'm I'm done with this I I'm kicking it out of my life and
