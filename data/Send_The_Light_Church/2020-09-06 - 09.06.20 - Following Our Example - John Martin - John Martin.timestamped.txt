[0:00] uh seated
[0:04] uh this morning we we will be going
[0:07] through
[0:07] a quite a few scriptures and we're going
[0:09] to be going kind of fast
[0:13] and that's what happens when you get a
[0:14] lot a lot of time to study up north
[0:20] amen before we begin reading first peter
[0:23] chapter 2
[0:24] verse 21 let's look to the author of
[0:26] this word
[0:28] our heavenly father we thank you
[0:31] lord that you've put it in our hearts to
[0:33] be in your house today
[0:34] amen that desire is so precious
[0:38] we thank you for it lord we thank you
[0:40] that you've given us health and strength
[0:41] to be here
[0:43] and lord we thank you for your word we
[0:45] know that anyone
[0:47] anyone can open the pages of this book
[0:49] and read it
[0:50] and get some sort of understanding
[0:54] but to get the correct understanding to
[0:56] know exactly what it is that you're
[0:58] trying to speak to us with that
[0:59] scripture
[1:00] lord it takes the holy spirit we humbly
[1:04] pray that you'd come today
[1:05] in every one of our hearts and our minds
[1:07] as we go through these scriptures
[1:09] lord that you reveal to us the true
[1:11] meaning for our lives
[1:14] lord we know that your word can
[1:18] speak to those that don't know you
[1:22] and speak to those lord that have just
[1:26] come to know you that have started to
[1:28] walk
[1:30] in this great race towards heaven
[1:34] lord thy word has the ability that
[1:38] same word has the ability to get your
[1:40] bride
[1:41] ready those that are
[1:44] sealed with the holy ghost to know what
[1:47] you'd have them to do
[1:50] so lord we pray that you take the same
[1:53] word
[1:54] today in all of our ears and that you'd
[1:56] quicken life to us
[1:59] lord we need thy word to become
[2:03] life inside of us so real
[2:06] lord for you are this word we ask that
[2:09] it would come from the pages
[2:10] into our hearts now as we commit this
[2:12] service into your hands for your honor
[2:14] and glory we pray
[2:16] in jesus christ's name amen amen
[2:19] amen first peter chapter 2 verse 21
[2:23] for even here and too were you called
[2:27] because christ also suffered for us
[2:32] i'm thankful that christ suffered for
[2:34] you
[2:36] leaving us an example
[2:39] that we should follow his steps amen in
[2:42] matthew chapter 5
[2:44] so his suffering was not in vain it was
[2:47] an example for us
[2:50] matthew chapter 5 starting with verse
[2:54] 43 and i want you to think as you think
[2:57] we go through these scriptures here what
[2:59] it really takes to do them it takes
[3:02] suffering you have heard that it had
[3:04] been said that thou shalt love thy
[3:06] neighbor and hate thine enemy
[3:07] but i say unto you love your enemies
[3:10] bless them that curse you do good to
[3:12] them that hate you
[3:13] and pray for them that despitefully use
[3:15] you and persecute you
[3:17] that you may be the children of your
[3:18] father which is in heaven
[3:20] for he maketh the sun to rise on the
[3:21] evil and the good and sendeth reign on
[3:23] the just and the unjust
[3:25] for if you love them which love you what
[3:28] reward
[3:30] have you you're not even the publicans
[3:33] the same
[3:34] if you salute your brethren only those
[3:37] that of the church
[3:44] what do you more than others
[3:47] do not even the public and so
[3:50] but ye be therefore perfect
[3:54] as your father which is in heaven is
[3:56] perfect
[3:57] amen god bless you may be seated
[4:01] that's uh when we think about the love
[4:03] of god it's a wonderful
[4:05] thing to experience it is
[4:08] amazing there's really no other
[4:12] no other feeling that is greater to
[4:15] experience than the love of god
[4:18] of course it affects us in different
[4:20] ways that love can
[4:22] bring a conviction it can also uh
[4:25] pardon you um but the
[4:28] the presence of god's love is is simply
[4:31] amazing
[4:34] but to be just like jesus's heavenly
[4:36] father
[4:37] in heaven to love like he loves
[4:42] is is an example of suffering it's
[4:45] difficult it's hard
[4:48] we live in a a very confused world as
[4:51] we're all becoming more and more
[4:53] apparent
[4:55] we live in a identity crisis society
[4:59] where people are increasingly losing
[5:03] track of who they are
[5:07] we're living in a social media addiction
[5:11] people can't seem to get off their phone
[5:13] that's right
[5:15] and
[5:20] an epidemic
[5:23] am i saying that word right or that drug
[5:25] that new drug
[5:27] opid edema opioid thank you brother
[5:32] it's becoming more and more fluent
[5:36] in our society it's become a problem
[5:42] we have a student loan crisis that we're
[5:44] dealing with
[5:46] university of chicago called air
[5:48] pollution
[5:49] the world's top killer
[5:54] in the past year the who
[5:57] officially classified a work burnout
[6:01] as a medical diagnosis
[6:06] traffic has gotten so bad that people
[6:08] who drive on a regular basis
[6:10] spend 54 hours a year just sitting
[6:14] in their car in traffic
[6:17] not moving rates
[6:20] diabetes rates are increasing and life
[6:23] expectancy is on a decline
[6:26] not only is that on a decline but
[6:28] happiness
[6:30] is on decline amen
[6:33] hatred is hiding behind political
[6:36] parties
[6:38] and hate crimes are escalating as we
[6:41] know
[6:43] perversion continues to increase and
[6:45] hide
[6:46] even behind religious realms
[6:50] there isn't anyone that we can look to
[6:54] in this world full of confusion there's
[6:57] no one that we can look to
[6:59] for an example but we have an example
[7:03] to follow in god's word amen
[7:06] to get us out of the mess that this
[7:08] world is in and get us ready
[7:10] for a rapture like to entitle this
[7:12] message follow
[7:14] in our example following our example
[7:18] second timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says
[7:20] that all scripture
[7:22] is given to us for a specific reason
[7:25] it's inspired by god and it is
[7:27] profitable
[7:29] for doctrine for reproof for correction
[7:31] for instruction in righteousness
[7:34] that we the men of god the men and women
[7:37] of god may be perfect
[7:39] thoroughly furnished onto all good works
[7:43] now by far we in this church
[7:47] are not perfect
[7:52] i do believe god makes up the difference
[7:58] i believe we're pressing towards that
[8:00] mark
[8:02] and this word is our example to follow
[8:08] but it's scary today because
[8:11] every believer today faces satan's
[8:13] ultimate question
[8:15] do we really have to follow
[8:18] this example in the bible
[8:22] can't we still make it without following
[8:25] the example
[8:27] he speaks it to all of us there are many
[8:31] different types of examples in the bible
[8:33] and all are important but
[8:35] this very crucial one is the example
[8:37] that we use
[8:38] to follow for our lives
[8:41] let's take a look at the example that
[8:44] god has given us
[8:45] in his word we have a lot of scriptures
[8:47] but in this opening scripture
[8:50] to love our enemies to do good that to
[8:53] them that hate us and to pray for them
[8:55] that
[8:55] use us and not just use us once in a
[8:57] while but kind of despitefully they know
[8:59] they can get away with it
[9:03] our natural parents in some fashion
[9:05] formal way
[9:07] taught us that there was a difference
[9:09] between those that deal with them kindly
[9:11] and those that they would consider not
[9:13] to be real friends
[9:15] is that true all of our parents that did
[9:18] they maybe didn't say there's your enemy
[9:20] and there's your friend but in some
[9:22] fashion formal way we could tell by
[9:24] their life
[9:24] that who their friends were and who
[9:27] their enemies were
[9:28] amen but jesus
[9:32] is saying don't follow this example
[9:35] don't follow this leadership anyone can
[9:38] love somebody that does good to them
[9:41] there's no reward handed out for that
[9:45] but be like my heavenly father let him
[9:48] be your example follow that
[9:50] example because when you
[9:53] love those who don't love you
[9:56] there's a reward for that
[10:00] and i want that reward because to me
[10:02] that reward is perfection it's not some
[10:05] you know some some reward like this
[10:10] it's a life that's full of christ
[10:13] what other reward could we want
[10:17] this example that jesus gave us to
[10:19] follow is a hard example to follow
[10:22] considering that our nature is selfish
[10:24] to begin with
[10:26] we don't want to just hand out uh uh
[10:29] uh love to someone that we think don't
[10:31] deserve it
[10:38] we notice that this example of love is
[10:40] also an example
[10:42] of how to suffer
[10:46] to achieve it amen people think they can
[10:49] achieve the love of god
[10:51] without suffering you can't
[10:55] right you can't you're just trying to
[10:57] perfect your own love
[10:59] that won't work jesus made it clear
[11:03] to anyone that desires to follow him
[11:05] that it wasn't going to be easy
[11:08] when jesus called his his first few
[11:11] disciples
[11:12] andrew and and peter and he said to them
[11:15] come and i'll make you fishers of men
[11:18] you know they didn't
[11:19] realize that it was going to be more
[11:21] than just a
[11:22] a career change they were maybe kind of
[11:25] excited
[11:26] at one time to follow jesus but they did
[11:28] not realize
[11:30] that they would have to give up their
[11:32] own desire
[11:34] to live for somebody else
[11:37] that have to give up fishing for
[11:39] themselves
[11:41] to fish for men if they were going to
[11:44] live for others
[11:45] that means they could no longer live for
[11:46] themselves and this
[11:48] this this invitation that jesus made to
[11:51] them
[11:51] really went against the grain of their
[11:54] flesh
[11:57] it wasn't popular
[12:03] satan asks us do we really have to
[12:04] follow that example
[12:08] isn't it different for us and jesus paid
[12:12] for it all
[12:13] we do have to follow the example amen we
[12:16] need to follow the example that jesus
[12:19] jesus laid out in the word turn with me
[12:21] if you would to luke chapter 9 verse 22
[12:23] jesus speaking here he said the son of
[12:25] man
[12:26] must suffer many things and be rejected
[12:28] the elders and the chief priests and
[12:30] scribes and be slain
[12:31] and be raised the third day but it
[12:34] doesn't stop there
[12:37] he said to them all if any man will come
[12:40] after me let him deny himself take up
[12:42] his cross and follow me
[12:44] in other words i'm going to have to
[12:47] suffer
[12:47] that's true but if you're going to
[12:49] follow me you're going to have to suffer
[12:50] as well
[12:52] that's all there is to it not going to
[12:55] be easy
[12:57] so i'll say it in this difficult
[12:59] situation that we're facing
[13:01] to follow christ if we just
[13:04] give up our will lay down our lives
[13:11] and follow the example amen this world
[13:15] has fallen apart
[13:16] satan is still asking us the question do
[13:19] we really have to follow this example in
[13:21] god's word
[13:22] i'll tell you it's the very same thing
[13:24] that jesus spoke to paul in acts chapter
[13:26] 9 verse 16 he said for i will
[13:28] show him how great things he must suffer
[13:31] for my name's sake
[13:33] now why is god going to show him how
[13:35] much great things he's going to have to
[13:37] suffer
[13:38] but he's going to let me off the hook
[13:42] what kind of god is that
[13:48] i think our gods will respect our
[13:50] persons
[13:52] do we really need to follow that example
[13:54] brother john
[13:57] jesus knew the temptation that every man
[14:00] would have
[14:00] concerning this and he said in luke
[14:02] chapter 9 verse 24
[14:05] for whosoever will save his life shall
[14:08] lose it
[14:08] right amen but whosoever will lose his
[14:12] life for my sake
[14:13] the same shall save it amen
[14:17] for what advantage for what is a man's
[14:20] advantage if he gained the whole world
[14:22] gets everything he wants
[14:24] and loses himself
[14:28] or be a castaway amen himself
[14:31] you think if you're getting everything
[14:32] you want how could you be losing
[14:34] yourself
[14:36] because yourself is your soul
[14:39] the flesh is going to perish it's going
[14:42] to get old
[14:43] it's gonna get wrinkly i i think the
[14:45] last time that sister trina saw me
[14:47] she she saw some darker hair on me
[14:53] you you lose whatever you do have
[15:00] look at the great example that jesus set
[15:02] before us in the garden of eden
[15:06] no the garden of gethsemane
[15:09] when he asked his disciples would you
[15:11] just pray with me for an hour
[15:13] of course they struggled doing that a
[15:14] few times they didn't want to
[15:17] ain't no different than today
[15:22] and he went and he prayed and he said
[15:23] father if it be possible
[15:25] would you let this cup pass from me now
[15:28] look at his
[15:28] example that he gave for us amen
[15:34] we know satan offered him everything
[15:36] that he could have wanted
[15:39] made it easy for him but he gave us the
[15:42] example when he said father
[15:44] not my will thy will be done yes
[15:47] that is our example today right amen
[15:52] it wasn't comfortable for his flesh it
[15:55] wasn't meant to be
[15:56] comfortable for his flesh in fact flesh
[15:59] and blood can't inherit the kingdom of
[16:01] god
[16:02] they that are in the flesh are stinky to
[16:06] god
[16:09] when you're in the spirit that means
[16:11] you're out of the flesh now god can deal
[16:13] with you
[16:15] oh must jesus bear the cross alone and
[16:18] all the world go free
[16:20] no there's a cross for everyone and
[16:22] there's a cross for me
[16:26] but you know i have a choice to either
[16:30] look at the example and pick it up
[16:36] or choose to leave it there
[16:42] leave suffering at church and go do my
[16:46] thing at home
[16:50] jesus gave us an example to follow
[16:54] jesus had to forsake his own will for
[16:57] the father's will
[16:58] we have to forsake our will for jesus's
[17:00] will
[17:01] luke chapter 14 verse 25 and there were
[17:04] great multitudes with him
[17:06] and he turned and he said unto them if
[17:08] any man come after me and hate not his
[17:10] father and his mother
[17:11] and wife and children and brothers and
[17:13] sisters yay even
[17:16] his own life he cannot be my disciple
[17:21] so you see here it wasn't just an
[17:24] isolated situation
[17:26] for his disciples right
[17:30] any man that decides to follow christ
[17:34] and whosoever does not bear his own
[17:37] cross
[17:39] and come after me he cannot be my
[17:41] disciple you know many people claim to
[17:43] be a disciple of jesus
[17:44] but they won't pick up a cross the
[17:46] world's full of them
[17:49] all of them but jesus didn't sugarcoat
[17:52] it
[17:53] now i know a lot of people don't want to
[17:54] preach this
[17:57] they'd rather go to a church that don't
[17:59] preach it
[18:00] and i don't when it comes to their flesh
[18:02] i understand that
[18:04] i don't blame them but when it comes to
[18:06] their soul
[18:07] i do not understand that
[18:11] because they're using their own mind as
[18:14] an
[18:14] absolute
[18:17] jesus said in verse 33 so likewise
[18:20] whosoever be of you that forsaketh not
[18:22] all that he have he can't even be his
[18:25] disciple
[18:26] right forsaking awe
[18:30] is the complete requirement for all of
[18:33] our lives
[18:34] we all face that every day a w
[18:38] told her he said the reason why many are
[18:41] still
[18:41] troubled still seeking still making
[18:45] little forward progress is because they
[18:48] haven't yet come to the end of
[18:50] themselves
[18:52] we're still trying to give orders and
[18:54] interfere
[18:55] with god's work that's happening inside
[18:57] of us
[19:00] so we see the world falling apart satan
[19:03] prompts the question
[19:04] in our minds but do we really have to
[19:07] follow that example
[19:10] luke chapter 9 verse 57
[19:13] and it came to pass that as they went
[19:16] in the way a certain man said unto him
[19:19] lord
[19:20] i decided that i'm going to follow thee
[19:24] wheresoever thou goest and jesus said
[19:27] unto him i want you to be aware
[19:29] that the foxes have holes and the birds
[19:31] have of the air have nests
[19:33] but the son of man does not have uh
[19:36] where to lay his head and he said unto
[19:40] another
[19:41] follow me and he said lord
[19:44] suffer me first to go and bury
[19:47] my father look at the answer that he
[19:50] gave let the dead bury the dead
[19:52] go thou and what
[19:56] win souls go and win souls
[20:00] right bring somebody to the kingdom
[20:05] that wasn't in there and another
[20:09] also said lord i will follow thee
[20:12] let me first go and bid them farewell
[20:15] that are at my home and
[20:17] at my house jesus said unto him
[20:20] no man having started
[20:24] to walk this race
[20:27] to work this work to put his hand to the
[20:30] plow
[20:32] taking a second to look back
[20:36] is fit for god's kingdom amen
[20:41] i'll tell you i have fallen
[20:44] so short of this example
[20:53] and if you're honest with yourself you
[20:55] can say the same thing today
[21:00] as we go through these examples
[21:04] to follow we're going to see that these
[21:06] examples are really
[21:08] not very pleasant for our flesh but yet
[21:11] they're our example let's take a look
[21:13] at another one here in saint john 13
[21:15] verse 3.
[21:18] jesus knowing that the father had given
[21:20] him all things in his hands and
[21:22] he was come from god and he went to god
[21:25] he raised from supper and laid his
[21:27] garments and took a towel and girded
[21:28] himself and after he poured water into a
[21:30] basin he began to wash
[21:32] the disciples feet to wipe them with a
[21:34] towel wherewith he was girded and he
[21:36] cometh to simon peter and peter said to
[21:38] out them lord
[21:39] does that wash my feet what are you
[21:42] doing
[21:45] jesus answered and said to him why what
[21:48] i do thou
[21:49] knowest not a lot of things that
[21:53] happened to our life that god does we
[21:54] don't know what he's doing
[21:56] when he's doing it but thou shall know
[21:58] hereafter
[21:59] peter sayeth unto him thou shalt never
[22:02] wash my feet
[22:03] jesus answered him if i wash not if i
[22:06] wash thee not
[22:08] thou has no part with me
[22:12] peter saith on him lord not my feet only
[22:14] but also my hands and my head
[22:16] trying to get him on the right path but
[22:18] you know peter was a ch
[22:20] one side of the dish or the other
[22:26] and jesus said then he that is washed
[22:30] needeth not to save wash his feet but is
[22:32] clean
[22:33] every wit and ye are clean but not all
[22:35] for he knew who should betray him
[22:37] therefore he said ye are not all clean
[22:39] so after they washed their feet and
[22:41] taken the garment and
[22:42] sat down again he said unto them know ye
[22:45] what i've done unto you
[22:46] good question do you know why this
[22:48] message is being preached this morning
[22:54] you call me master and lord and you say
[22:57] well for i am
[22:58] for saw him if then your lord
[23:02] master washed your feet y'all also to
[23:04] wash one another's feet
[23:06] now look at this verse i said all that
[23:08] to say this
[23:09] for i have given you an example
[23:14] what do i do with this example that you
[23:16] should do
[23:17] as i have done to you
[23:20] now do we have to follow the example
[23:22] that's what we
[23:24] need to tell the devil when he tells us
[23:26] or asks us
[23:28] do i really need to do what's being said
[23:32] verily verily i say unto you that the
[23:33] servant is not greater than his lord
[23:35] neither he that is sent greater than he
[23:37] that sent them
[23:38] if ye know these things well that's good
[23:41] that you know them
[23:42] right but you're only going to be happy
[23:44] if you do them amen
[23:46] you can't be happy knowing you should
[23:48] wash your brother's feet
[23:50] but after you get done washing
[23:52] somebody's feet and get your hands dirty
[23:54] and help them out a little bit in life
[23:56] you will be very happy inside because
[23:58] it's christ in you
[24:00] just when you the more you give the more
[24:02] lord gives you
[24:05] you can't out give the lord keep giving
[24:07] and god will keep blessing you
[24:08] amen first peter chapter 2 verse 17
[24:12] honor all men love the brother and fear
[24:14] god and honor the king
[24:16] servants be subject to your masters with
[24:18] all fear not only to the good and gentle
[24:20] but also to the fro where it sounds like
[24:22] you're opening scripture
[24:23] for this is thank worthy if a man for
[24:25] conscious towards god in your grief
[24:27] suffering wrongfully yes
[24:30] amen for what glory is it when ye are
[24:33] buffeted for your fault you shall take
[24:35] it patiently but if
[24:36] when ye do well and suffer for it you
[24:38] take it patiently
[24:39] this is really what's acceptable with
[24:42] god
[24:43] now look at this for even unto were ye
[24:46] called
[24:47] because christ also suffered for us
[24:49] leaving
[24:50] us an example
[24:53] that we should follow his steps so do we
[24:56] have to follow the success
[24:57] yes we have to follow the example
[25:02] who did no sin neither was guile found
[25:04] in his mouth
[25:06] who when he was reviled reviled not
[25:07] again when he suffered he threatened not
[25:09] but he committed himself
[25:11] to him that judgeth righteously who his
[25:14] own self bear sins and his own body on
[25:17] the tree that we being dead to sin
[25:19] should live unto righteousness by whose
[25:21] stripes were healed
[25:23] for ye were a sheep going astray but now
[25:25] you return to the shepherd
[25:27] and bishop of your souls
[25:30] jesus left us an example
[25:34] of how to suffer
[25:38] when we have not done wrong
[25:42] and the carnal mind says i should
[25:45] never have to suffer if i have not done
[25:48] wrong
[25:51] in fact i'm just going to set the story
[25:54] straight
[25:57] that's not the example he laid for us
[26:00] if you don't suffer when you haven't
[26:03] done wrong
[26:04] people are really not going to see jesus
[26:06] you know they're going to see
[26:08] you so don't be a hot head
[26:12] don't be short fused don't try to prove
[26:15] who's right
[26:17] you're right and they're wrong don't
[26:21] don't try to threaten someone by cutting
[26:23] fellowship off with them and just
[26:25] you know staying away from them
[26:28] because of something they said or
[26:30] something they've done
[26:33] don't try to set their story straight
[26:36] with your worldly wisdom
[26:38] that's mixed with envy and strife it's
[26:41] only going to bring more confusion to
[26:43] the situation
[26:44] so are you going to make people feel
[26:45] more kooky about what's going on
[26:49] we have an example in christ jesus
[26:51] committed himself unto him that judges
[26:54] righteously
[26:55] we need to learn in those situations
[26:57] just to commit ourself unto christ who
[26:59] will judge the situation correctly
[27:02] amen james chapter 3 verse 13
[27:05] who is a wise man and to do with
[27:07] knowledge among you let him show out of
[27:09] a good conversation his worth with
[27:10] meekness of wisdom
[27:13] but the wisdom that is from above is
[27:15] first pure peaceable general easy to be
[27:17] entreated full of mercy
[27:18] good fruits without partiality without
[27:20] hypocrisy
[27:22] i'll tell you if you're producing that
[27:24] it's christ
[27:27] it won't be you it's christ
[27:30] and it comes out of someone
[27:34] that's filled with the spirit of god
[27:36] amen
[27:38] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[27:41] in peace
[27:42] that make peace you're a maker right you
[27:45] know there are people that cause trouble
[27:48] and there's people that take trouble and
[27:50] make peace
[27:52] they take trouble and they make peace
[27:57] we're all one we're we we're all the
[28:00] time
[28:00] exercising one of the two
[28:05] and the holy ghost makes peace it's a
[28:08] fruit of the holy ghost
[28:11] but this flesh is no friend of peace
[28:16] it stirs things up it likes to be on top
[28:19] right amen one way to get on top
[28:22] is to get somebody else below
[28:26] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 1 be
[28:29] ye
[28:29] followers now kind of
[28:32] leaving the example of christ and coming
[28:35] towards
[28:36] paul and paul is saying follow me
[28:40] be followers of me even as i also
[28:44] am of christ amen
[28:48] it is very much in order to
[28:51] follow a man
[28:54] as long as he's following christ
[28:59] god chose man's preaching
[29:03] to get men to follow christ amen
[29:07] that's what he chose and you want people
[29:11] to follow you
[29:13] if you're leading them to christ but if
[29:16] you're leading them to your way of
[29:19] thinking about christ
[29:21] get away from that amen be ye followers
[29:26] of me
[29:27] even as i also am of christ paul's heart
[29:30] of love never wanted people to follow
[29:32] him
[29:35] especially if he got off the word
[29:38] but if he knew that he had a chance to
[29:41] help somebody
[29:43] he wanted people to follow him down the
[29:46] straight and narrow path
[29:48] uh a life of self-crucifixion a
[29:52] a life where he said i die daily a life
[29:55] where he said to present your body a
[29:56] living sacrifice
[29:58] that is though that is the example that
[30:00] paul wanted you to follow the paul
[30:02] that not the old paul
[30:05] not the saul who was just into how great
[30:09] he was
[30:10] right and give all that up
[30:13] follow me as i know nothing except jesus
[30:16] christ and him crucified amen
[30:20] but he knew he knew because the word
[30:23] says that grievous wolves would come in
[30:24] when he would depart
[30:27] and that spirit would be upon them a
[30:30] spirit that would divide
[30:34] and he knew that the there would be
[30:35] false apostles deceitful workers
[30:38] transforming themselves the bible says
[30:41] into the apostles of christ
[30:44] and in second corinthians chapter 11
[30:46] verse 14 it says and no marble
[30:48] for satan himself is transformed into an
[30:51] angel of light
[30:52] amen there is no great thing if his
[30:54] ministers also be transformed as
[30:56] ministers of righteousness
[30:59] uh uh also be transformed as ministers
[31:02] are righteous
[31:02] whose end shall be according to their
[31:06] works
[31:06] so if satan can do it his ministers can
[31:09] do it
[31:09] right verse 18 seeing that many
[31:13] glory after the flesh i will glory also
[31:17] so
[31:18] the reason that they do this is because
[31:20] of their flesh
[31:21] if they were in the spirit their whole
[31:23] desire would to put jesus christ
[31:26] first in their life
[31:29] but now here he is he's going to say
[31:31] many seem to glory after the flesh
[31:33] i would like to spend some time and uh
[31:37] glory also paul recognized many
[31:40] people men and women want to glory in
[31:43] their flesh
[31:45] when they minister to others you know
[31:47] kind of like bragging
[31:49] bragging about themselves along the way
[31:52] paul said i'd like to brag to so
[31:55] how many want to hear paul bragg
[31:59] but is bragging look foolish to others
[32:04] so if i'm going to brag i'm going to
[32:06] brag about what great things i've done
[32:10] look at me look what i've achieved
[32:13] that's the normal way of breaking
[32:15] but paul's way of bragging was foolish
[32:18] to others he says in verse 22
[32:25] are they hebrews so am i are they
[32:27] israelites
[32:28] so am i are they the seed of abraham so
[32:31] am i
[32:32] to this point they were identical
[32:36] you couldn't tell the ministers apart
[32:41] the word of the hour at that moment was
[32:44] identical
[32:46] but paul said in first thessalonians
[32:49] chapter 1 verse 5 we're just going to
[32:53] jump off into scripture here for a
[32:54] second for
[32:56] our gospel came not unto you in word
[32:58] only
[32:59] but also in power and in the holy ghost
[33:04] and in much assurance as you know not as
[33:07] you know what manner of men
[33:08] we were among you for your sake
[33:12] so now he's going he's going to show
[33:15] the difference between the ministers
[33:20] because some ministers or
[33:24] they speaking of came only in word
[33:28] they only ministered in word but it
[33:31] wasn't in power
[33:33] and it wasn't in the holy ghost
[33:36] we'll talk a little bit about this
[33:37] differently down the road here
[33:39] paul didn't just have a form of
[33:41] godliness
[33:44] here is where he begins to uh separate
[33:47] the ministries he said verse 23 are they
[33:50] the ministers of christ i speak as a
[33:52] fool
[33:53] i am more labor more abundant
[33:57] in stripes and above measure in prisons
[34:01] more frequent and deaths often well
[34:02] that's
[34:03] foolish why do you need to labor
[34:06] more jesus paid it all
[34:13] of the jews five times received by 40
[34:16] stripes save one
[34:18] that's foolish who wants to do that
[34:23] thrice i was beat with rods once i was
[34:25] stoned thrice i was shipwrecked
[34:27] night day i've been in the deep in
[34:29] journeys often in pearls of water and
[34:31] perils of robbers
[34:33] in perils of my own countrymen in perils
[34:35] of heathens and perils in the city in
[34:37] perils from the wilderness imperials and
[34:38] the sea
[34:39] perils among false brethren
[34:43] peril in weariness and painfulness and
[34:45] watchings often hunger and thirsty
[34:47] father in cold and nakedness
[34:50] man none of them testify like that
[34:54] right now they're bragging like that
[34:57] this to me sounds foolish
[35:00] but those things which are without that
[35:03] which cometh upon me
[35:05] daily the care of all the churches
[35:11] jesus really did show him how great of
[35:16] things he must suffer
[35:18] amen jesus really did
[35:21] give him a revelation
[35:25] of what it means to know him in the
[35:27] fellowship of his sufferings
[35:31] and i believe that jesus gave faith
[35:36] to paul to be able to go through that
[35:40] to me it takes power to go through that
[35:43] and to keep going
[35:45] that's what power is
[35:49] you know you don't have to have any
[35:51] ghosts
[35:53] excuse me any holy ghost to preach
[36:00] my seven kids preached to me all their
[36:03] life when they were growing up telling
[36:04] me
[36:05] how to be a better parent and what they
[36:07] really needed
[36:12] but to see one of them lay down their
[36:14] life
[36:15] [Music]
[36:18] when they were wronged
[36:21] and still do the right thing
[36:24] that takes a denial of flesh
[36:27] only the holy ghost is going to do that
[36:29] in somebody amen
[36:30] nobody is born with that nature
[36:36] that's why we need to get the holy ghost
[36:38] because when you
[36:39] are so filled with the holy ghost it
[36:42] just automatically happens
[36:43] yes you don't got to try to make it
[36:46] happen
[36:47] as long as you're willing to die daily
[36:49] god is willing to manifest himself in
[36:52] her life
[36:56] in our message language today
[36:59] we call this living for others
[37:04] now the carnal mind says well this is
[37:07] pretty stupid
[37:10] when jesus paid it all
[37:13] and i can just do what i want to do
[37:15] jesus still loves me and i got that rock
[37:17] solid revelation
[37:22] every believer this morning faces the
[37:26] question from satan do we really have to
[37:28] follow this example
[37:31] brother john we know these scriptures
[37:33] you've preached so many of them to us
[37:36] all right not done i want to finish
[37:39] verse 29 and 30 who is weak
[37:41] am i not weak who is offended i burn not
[37:43] if i must needs i will glory of the
[37:45] things which concern
[37:47] my infirmities he finishes off this
[37:50] thought in second corinthians chapter 12
[37:52] verse 10
[37:53] therefore i take pleasures in my
[37:55] infirmities and reproaches and
[37:56] necessities and persecutions
[37:58] in distress for christ's sake for when
[38:00] i'm weak then i'm strong
[38:03] learn to just commit myself to god yes
[38:06] amen
[38:07] paul never wanted believers to follow
[38:10] a ministry who preached the gospel in
[38:13] word
[38:14] only whose life
[38:17] denied the power of truly believing the
[38:20] gospel
[38:22] a power that's willing to suffer for
[38:25] others
[38:26] philippians chapter 3 verse 10 paul's
[38:29] saying that i might know him
[38:32] and the power of his resurrection and
[38:34] the fellowship of his sufferings
[38:36] being made conformable unto his death
[38:40] you talk about fellowship with jesus
[38:44] are you willing to suffer for jesus amen
[38:48] that's what true fellowship is everybody
[38:50] wants the good side of jesus
[38:52] the santa claus side where you get
[38:54] everything that you ask for
[38:56] but nobody wants to talk about the side
[38:59] what jesus is asking for in the
[39:00] relationship
[39:02] and everything that he's asking for is
[39:04] taking a denial of the flesh
[39:08] he you don't even get along with the
[39:10] flesh it ain't subject to his will
[39:13] it it indeed it cannot be the bible says
[39:16] there's an enmity there's a there's a
[39:18] division there's a gate there
[39:22] and he doesn't go in and try to get
[39:25] satan's
[39:26] uh nature to conform to his
[39:31] no he gave us what to do deny it crucify
[39:35] it
[39:36] paul said i die daily was the only way
[39:39] that christ could
[39:40] be in his life enough willing to suffer
[39:42] for others
[39:44] because if paul never denied his life if
[39:46] he never crucified his life
[39:48] he would never be able to live that life
[39:53] he said can you pull up first
[39:57] galatians chapter 2 verse 20 amen
[40:01] for i am crucified with christ
[40:05] nevertheless i live yet it's not really
[40:08] me
[40:11] but it's christ that liveth in me and
[40:13] the life which i now live i
[40:15] in the flesh in the same flesh i live by
[40:17] the faith of the son of god who loved he
[40:19] gave himself for me
[40:20] i am crucified with christ now you take
[40:22] this out and just say
[40:24] you know i'm a message believer with
[40:25] christ
[40:30] it's a totally different mindset
[40:35] we want to follow the example in the
[40:38] word
[40:38] amen amen not what satan wants to
[40:41] misinterpret to us
[40:46] all right hebrews chapter 13 verse 7
[40:48] remember
[40:49] them which have the rule over you who
[40:51] have spoken unto you the word of god
[40:54] look at whose faith follow
[40:57] now consider the end of their
[40:59] conversation
[41:02] the end is exactly what the beginning
[41:04] was
[41:05] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[41:09] and forever amen so consider the end
[41:13] of the conversation our example was
[41:16] yesterday
[41:18] jesus and paul
[41:23] and our that's what we're supposed to
[41:25] follow today
[41:26] it will be our example forever amen
[41:32] jesus will have the very scars in the
[41:35] palm of his hands in heaven
[41:37] wanting you to think about his suffering
[41:40] for you
[41:43] in a heaven full of joy
[41:47] and peace and love well i'll tell you
[41:51] i've never regretted laying down my life
[41:54] for somebody
[41:56] it gives me love it gives me joy
[41:59] it gives me peace it's the times that i
[42:03] was
[42:04] unwilling to do that my flesh got out of
[42:06] the way that's the time i regret
[42:09] that's the time i'm missing joy
[42:16] christ was our example paul was our
[42:18] example the prophet in this
[42:20] hour is our example be ye
[42:23] followers of me even as i also
[42:27] am of christ
[42:33] paul did not want us to follow him
[42:37] if he got off just a little bit
[42:40] come on galatians chapter 1 verse 7
[42:45] which is not another but there be some
[42:47] that trouble you
[42:49] how do they trouble you
[42:52] they would pervert the gospel of christ
[42:57] but though we or an angel from heaven
[43:01] preach any other gospel unto you than
[43:04] that which we have preached
[43:06] unto you let him be accursed
[43:09] yes so tell me do we have to follow this
[43:11] example be
[43:12] careful how you answer that
[43:18] you can bring in a curse on yourself
[43:21] brother branham said in the message the
[43:22] absolute
[43:23] if you can read in the scripture
[43:26] something that christ
[43:27] has ordained or commissioned us to do
[43:31] and because of some twisted around if
[43:33] someone would try to tell you that
[43:35] was for the disciples or someone else
[43:40] and then you don't hold on to that
[43:44] as your example to follow he said then
[43:46] christ
[43:47] is not your absolute that person who led
[43:51] you out of the way
[43:53] is your absolute yes
[43:58] and that's why paul wanted us to stay
[44:01] with the word
[44:02] amen but if that word christ still holds
[44:07] see then he's your absolute
[44:10] we mustn't let anything stir us
[44:13] out of the way of the word see
[44:17] some of them today is going on to get
[44:20] more
[44:21] than ever as the days go by
[44:24] that we're going to see people with this
[44:27] as jesus said
[44:28] a form of godliness well he misquoted it
[44:31] was uh
[44:32] paul who said that
[44:36] and just a a form is coming into
[44:41] we had it in the methodists in the
[44:43] baptist and so forth for years
[44:46] he says but now it's creeping into the
[44:48] pentecostals
[44:50] i'm saying it's creeped into the message
[44:55] you know they all just said well i'm a
[44:56] lutheran i'm a methodist
[44:58] i'm a pentecostal i spoke in tongues i'm
[45:01] in the message i believe brother branham
[45:05] a form as long as you hold to that
[45:10] no power not living the message
[45:16] nothing new just the same old symbol
[45:22] verse 9 going back to galatians chapter
[45:24] 1 verse 9
[45:25] as we said before so i say now again if
[45:28] any men
[45:30] preach any other gospel unto you than
[45:32] what we have received
[45:34] than what you have already received
[45:38] let that person be accursed
[45:42] right wow
[45:46] i mean we're supposed to love one
[45:47] another
[45:51] but if a person is trying to twist
[45:56] a little bit just get you off you know
[46:00] when you start
[46:01] you know you if you're going to be
[46:05] 100 miles apart from one another
[46:08] when you start out it's just a little
[46:11] just a little angle
[46:14] yes
[46:20] we should hunger for the revelation
[46:24] of the example in this word
[46:27] hunger for thirst for it
[46:30] not be a stuffed shirt that you already
[46:32] got it
[46:38] for do i now persuade men or god
[46:43] do i seek to please men for if i yet
[46:46] please men i should not be the servant
[46:47] of christ think about that
[46:49] if i am anxious about getting your
[46:51] approval from me
[46:54] amen how can i be servant of christ
[46:59] but if i'm willing willing
[47:02] to literally almost make an enemy out of
[47:04] you to make you think about your
[47:06] relationship with christ
[47:07] well i think that's what made paul go
[47:10] through what he went through
[47:12] that's why he had to suffer
[47:19] remember when peter didn't want to jesus
[47:21] to have to suffer
[47:23] jesus told him that he was going to have
[47:25] to suffer likewise
[47:28] in matthew chapter 16 verse 23 he turned
[47:31] he said unto peter
[47:33] get thee behind me satan for thou art an
[47:36] offense unto me for thou savers not the
[47:38] things that be of god but the things
[47:39] that be of men
[47:40] well what are the things that be of men
[47:42] not suffering
[47:44] that's what's of men nobody wants to
[47:46] suffer nobody wants to come to church
[47:48] and hear about suffering
[47:51] come tonight you won't hear about
[47:52] suffering it's a different subject
[47:57] be more of a storytelling
[48:03] satan tells every one of us not to savor
[48:05] the things that belong to god
[48:07] that's true tempts us to savor the
[48:10] things that
[48:11] be appealing to our flesh but jesus
[48:15] left us an example to follow
[48:18] paul said but i certify you brethren
[48:21] that the gospel which i preached unto
[48:23] you
[48:23] is really not my opinion
[48:27] it's not of me i didn't receive it
[48:32] from man neither was i
[48:35] taught it but by the revelation of jesus
[48:39] christ
[48:41] do we need that example we need that
[48:43] example
[48:45] to follow
[48:48] you know if we want to start pulling out
[48:51] this example out of the bible
[48:53] not deal with it we ain't no different
[48:55] than those that are making a new bible
[48:57] every every year every week every month
[49:00] here's a new bible it'll fit
[49:02] just you we got churches
[49:06] you some of you have past churches
[49:08] coming here today
[49:09] that literally have changed for one
[49:11] purpose because they can't keep people
[49:13] in the church
[49:17] open the door of just whatever you want
[49:19] to do is fine with me
[49:21] amen a lot of believers fear the thought
[49:25] of having to suffer and i want to deal
[49:27] with that
[49:28] they'll run to the hills
[49:33] do anything they can to get away from it
[49:37] our flesh will never want to suffer ever
[49:42] so forget trying to find the the key to
[49:45] getting it to want to do it
[49:46] it's just not going to want to do it you
[49:49] just have to accept
[49:51] that it's god's will god's example and
[49:54] deny your flesh
[49:56] for even here and two were you called
[49:58] even christ also suffered for us
[50:02] leaving us an example that you should
[50:05] follow his steps
[50:08] living for others is truly
[50:12] suffering
[50:18] now if i got up a wallet full of money
[50:24] and i give brother mark ten dollars
[50:27] there ain't very much suffering in that
[50:29] right
[50:30] but if i ain't got any money and i go
[50:33] sell something to get 10 bucks to give
[50:36] it to him
[50:38] that's suffering living if
[50:41] you're living for others isn't hurting
[50:45] you better question your living for
[50:47] others
[50:53] it's not a popular gospel but it's okay
[50:55] i'll stand with it
[50:57] second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for god
[51:00] have not given
[51:01] us the spirit of fear timothy was
[51:04] dealing with this fear
[51:05] but a power and love and of a sound mind
[51:08] amen
[51:08] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[51:10] testimony of the lord nor me of his
[51:12] prisoner
[51:13] but be thou a partaker of the uh
[51:16] of the afflictions that come with the
[51:19] gospel
[51:20] and look it's according to the power of
[51:22] god yes
[51:23] look at that not word only but power
[51:28] who have saved us and called us with the
[51:29] holy calling not according to our works
[51:31] but according to his own purpose and
[51:33] grace which he has
[51:34] given us in christ jesus before the
[51:36] world began but is now made manifest
[51:38] by the appearing of our savior jesus
[51:40] christ who have abolished death and
[51:42] brought life and mortality to
[51:44] the light of the gospel but whereunto
[51:45] i'm appointed a preacher an apostle to
[51:47] teach of the gentiles
[51:49] for which because i also i also
[51:52] timothy suffer these same things
[51:57] as you're going through nevertheless i'm
[51:59] not ashamed of it
[52:02] for i know in whom i believed and i'm
[52:04] persuaded that he's able to keep that
[52:06] which i've committed unto him against
[52:07] that today
[52:08] so hold fast the form of sound words
[52:12] which thou shared of me
[52:13] in faith in love which is in christ
[52:15] jesus
[52:16] hold fast the form
[52:20] of sound words yes amen
[52:23] follow the gospel example
[52:28] don't look for the easier way
[52:36] later in the chapter he said in second
[52:38] timothy chapter two verse nine
[52:39] second timothy chapter two verse nine
[52:42] wherein
[52:43] i suffer trouble as an evil doer
[52:47] even unto bonds but the word of god is
[52:49] not bond therefore he said in verse 10
[52:51] i endure all things for what purpose
[52:57] for the elect's sake if you get your
[52:59] mind on why you're supposed to be
[53:01] suffering
[53:03] have a burden i injure all things for
[53:07] the elect's sake
[53:08] that they may also obtain salvation
[53:12] which is in christ jesus with eternal
[53:13] glory amen
[53:15] the chances of you just going and and
[53:18] having a party
[53:19] and winning somebody to christ with
[53:21] enjoyment
[53:24] but i'll tell you what when you're
[53:26] willing to suffer
[53:29] and get tomatoes thrown at you taught
[53:32] behind your back
[53:33] negativity after negativity somebody is
[53:37] going to see that
[53:38] and come to christ
[53:42] you just stay true to the word yes
[53:45] stay true to the word
[53:49] the whole world is for hypocrisy
[53:54] now every it's okay that we fall make
[53:57] mistakes
[53:58] that's where we'll be so blessed tonight
[54:00] in this this thought here what's
[54:01] important is that you get back up that's
[54:03] the name of the message tonight
[54:05] get up just need to get up
[54:10] the difference between a
[54:13] a a a a a real believer and anybody else
[54:17] a hypocrite a believer gets back up yeah
[54:22] amen
[54:25] do you know why it's so easy for people
[54:26] to miss
[54:29] when satan tells them that you really
[54:30] don't need to follow the example
[54:33] because jesus already suffered people
[54:35] are selfish
[54:38] that's why we need a revelation
[54:42] of what it means to know jesus christ in
[54:44] the fellowship of his sufferings
[54:47] they made the gospel all about
[54:48] themselves
[54:50] the gospel isn't about ourselves the
[54:53] gospel is about others
[54:56] it's living a life that's willing
[54:59] to suffer for others being a christian
[55:03] is actually the hardest job it's the
[55:06] hardest job
[55:08] living for yourself is quite easy
[55:12] living for others is the hardest job you
[55:15] don't got time for yourself
[55:20] do you think jesus told all his
[55:21] disciples who he had already taught for
[55:23] three and a half years
[55:24] to stay in the upper room and pray until
[55:26] they received the holy ghost
[55:28] he said in acts chapter 1 verse 8 but
[55:31] you shall receive power after the holy
[55:33] ghost has come upon
[55:34] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[55:36] both in jerusalem judea and samaria and
[55:38] to the uttermost parts of the earth
[55:42] why because
[55:46] they needed to receive a power
[55:51] but it wasn't the power
[55:54] that we usually think will power us
[56:00] they already had power to cast out
[56:02] devils
[56:04] matthew chapter 10 right to heal all
[56:08] manner of diseases
[56:09] they've already possessed that that's
[56:12] right
[56:14] but they didn't have power to be a true
[56:16] witness they did not have the power
[56:18] to be willing to suffer when persecution
[56:21] came
[56:23] and peter was their best example of that
[56:26] he thought he was a good he was good to
[56:28] go
[56:30] yeah and if jesus would have said peter
[56:33] just go cast out the devil out of that
[56:34] high priest
[56:36] he would have gallantly went over there
[56:37] and done it
[56:40] but he just said stand still and let god
[56:43] have his way
[56:44] he couldn't do it
[56:53] he denied that he even knew a person he
[56:56] claimed to have a relationship
[56:58] with that's why we need the holy ghost
[57:03] the holy ghost will cause you to be a
[57:06] proper witness
[57:12] a seventh day adventist not a jehovah
[57:15] witness now to just
[57:20] i'm gonna talk to you about what i
[57:21] believe
[57:23] one where you can lay down your life
[57:26] for their soul sake willing to suffer a
[57:29] lot to get them
[57:30] saved that's a powerful
[57:33] witness wait in jerusalem
[57:37] until you be endued with power from on
[57:39] high
[57:40] and after the holy ghost to come upon
[57:42] you you shall be
[57:43] witnesses for me a true witness
[57:48] paul was a true witness but there'd be
[57:50] some
[57:51] that would pervert the gospel just twist
[57:54] it
[57:55] try to make it a form brother branham
[57:58] says as time would increase
[58:00] it would become worse and worse
[58:04] come on now i'm really going to need you
[58:08] to have some extra holy ghost right now
[58:10] why because this message isn't real
[58:13] relaxing
[58:13] and i still have some more things i want
[58:15] to share with you
[58:16] so how many how many can put put some of
[58:19] that holy ghost to the front line here
[58:22] second timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but
[58:24] thou has fully known my doctrine
[58:26] my manner of life my purpose my faith my
[58:28] long suffering my charity my patience
[58:30] my persecutions my afflictions which
[58:32] came up to me into antioch iconia lystra
[58:35] what persecutions i endured but out of
[58:37] them all the lord delivered me
[58:39] yeah and all that will live godly in
[58:41] christ jesus are going to suffer these
[58:42] same type of things and evil men
[58:45] introduced your shall works worse and
[58:46] worse deceiving and being deceived
[58:48] but continue thou in the things which
[58:52] thou has
[58:53] learned example
[58:58] and has been assured of knowing
[59:02] of whom thou has learned them wasn't
[59:05] just some fly by night
[59:07] paul received the revelation from god
[59:09] himself
[59:12] and that from a child that was fully
[59:14] known the scriptures which are able to
[59:15] make thee wise unto salvation well wait
[59:17] a minute
[59:18] i'm already saved
[59:21] it's a different gospel i don't know
[59:24] today's the day of salvation
[59:27] do you live tomorrow tomorrow's a day
[59:32] i i just like that i just like believing
[59:34] you know just i'm saying once
[59:35] uh saved i'm always saved and i i if i
[59:39] was uh
[59:39] if i got your life i always have it you
[59:41] know i just don't wanna do anything i
[59:42] just gotta believe that
[59:46] and if you preach to me anything else
[59:47] i'm just it's going to be confusing to
[59:49] me
[59:51] because it's not lining up with the
[59:52] other part of the gospel
[59:54] it's got a dovetail from genesis to
[59:56] revelations
[59:58] i believe in eternal security amen
[1:00:02] to the day of redemption but i believe
[1:00:05] there has to be
[1:00:06] uh i believe we have to consider the end
[1:00:09] of the conversation
[1:00:11] that jesus christ is the same today in
[1:00:14] your life as he was yesterday and
[1:00:15] somebody else's
[1:00:16] right amen
[1:00:21] first that's first timothy chapter 1
[1:00:23] verse 15
[1:00:25] and this is a faithful sin worthy of all
[1:00:26] acceptation that jesus christ came into
[1:00:28] the world to save sinners
[1:00:30] of whom i am chief
[1:00:34] what would that make you do if you got
[1:00:37] saved and you were chief
[1:00:38] how be it for this cause i obtain mercy
[1:00:41] that in
[1:00:42] me first jesus christ might show forth
[1:00:45] all long-suffering
[1:00:48] for a pattern an example
[1:00:53] to them which should hereafter
[1:00:57] believe on him to everlasting there's a
[1:00:59] reason you need to follow this example
[1:01:02] because there's somebody else out there
[1:01:04] needs to see the real jesus
[1:01:07] see the real life the life that's
[1:01:09] willing to suffer for them
[1:01:11] we all can stand and testify jesus
[1:01:13] suffered for me he was long suffering
[1:01:15] with me
[1:01:15] he called me many times and i didn't
[1:01:17] come
[1:01:21] but i finally came and i'm ever in debt
[1:01:24] to him
[1:01:24] amen well somebody needs to see that
[1:01:27] same jesus
[1:01:29] and how are they going to see it if
[1:01:30] you're not willing to be long-suffering
[1:01:31] right you're not willing to suffer for
[1:01:33] him
[1:01:34] for him for him for him for him
[1:01:38] well he may be a part of him so you have
[1:01:40] to suffer for him
[1:01:44] paul was a great example for us
[1:01:48] paul always pointed us back to jesus
[1:01:50] christ
[1:01:51] philippians chapter 2 verse 1 if there
[1:01:52] be therefore any consolation in christ
[1:01:54] if there be any comforter there be any
[1:01:56] fellowship of the spirit
[1:01:57] if there be any vows of mercy
[1:02:00] if you want to have complete fellowship
[1:02:02] with jesus fulfill ye my joy that you be
[1:02:04] like might have the same love being a
[1:02:06] one accordion of one mind well that
[1:02:08] sounds just wonderful
[1:02:09] let's have a game of scrabble
[1:02:13] let nothing be done through strife
[1:02:17] or vainglory yes but in lowliness of
[1:02:20] mind
[1:02:21] let each esteem the other better
[1:02:25] than themselves you know what it takes
[1:02:26] to do that
[1:02:29] takes you being dead
[1:02:34] look not every man on his own things but
[1:02:37] every man also on the things of others
[1:02:41] now we're talking about having
[1:02:42] fellowship with jesus this is how you do
[1:02:43] it
[1:02:45] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:02:47] in christ jesus
[1:02:48] who being in the form of god thought in
[1:02:50] that robbery to be equal with god
[1:02:54] i want to ask you this morning do you
[1:02:56] think it would be
[1:02:57] robbery for you to be equal with god
[1:03:00] today
[1:03:02] the mind of god was equal to the mind of
[1:03:06] christ
[1:03:07] the mind of the bride is equal
[1:03:11] to the mind of christ today
[1:03:14] the mind of christ will direct you away
[1:03:18] from your flesh it will direct you
[1:03:22] to lay down your life for others it will
[1:03:25] lead you
[1:03:26] away from your own reputation from
[1:03:29] strife from vainglory
[1:03:32] it will direct you away from looking at
[1:03:34] your own things
[1:03:36] the mind of christ will look get you
[1:03:38] interested in the things of others
[1:03:40] yes look verse 7 but he made himself of
[1:03:45] no reputation and he took upon him of
[1:03:48] the form of a servant and was made in
[1:03:52] the likeness of men
[1:03:54] but being found in the fashion is a man
[1:03:58] he humbled himself and he became
[1:04:00] obedient unto death
[1:04:01] even the death of the cross the mind of
[1:04:04] christ sounds
[1:04:06] like a mind equal to suffering
[1:04:10] for christ
[1:04:13] don't let satan get you
[1:04:16] to think of something different right
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:21] if christ died to set you free he's
[1:04:24] interested
[1:04:24] in setting other people free
[1:04:29] i know for me i saw somebody living the
[1:04:31] life
[1:04:32] that got my attention
[1:04:35] it wasn't some somebody just
[1:04:38] doing their own thing and i went to a
[1:04:41] lot of
[1:04:42] concerts and i used to just kind of rate
[1:04:44] them
[1:04:46] you know who was the best and how they
[1:04:49] showed off and the things they said
[1:04:53] oh you know when you go to parties it's
[1:04:54] whoever the life of the party is
[1:04:59] but you know none of those none of them
[1:05:02] convicted me of knowing christ
[1:05:06] but when i saw somebody willing to
[1:05:08] suffer give up their will
[1:05:11] that got my attention amen
[1:05:14] that's what christ the example that he
[1:05:16] laid for us
[1:05:17] that we should be following amen
[1:05:21] thank you for bearing with me
[1:05:22] philippians chapter 4 verse 5
[1:05:25] let your moderation be known unto
[1:05:28] some of your best friends
[1:05:32] the lord is at hand be careful for
[1:05:35] nothing
[1:05:36] but in everything by prayer and
[1:05:37] supplication
[1:05:39] with thanksgiving let your requests be
[1:05:41] made known unto god
[1:05:44] and the peace of god which passeth all
[1:05:46] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:05:48] minds through christ jesus
[1:05:50] if you want something to keep you it
[1:05:52] needs to be god amen
[1:05:55] if you open yourself up satan is the
[1:05:58] author of confusion
[1:05:59] finally brother and whatsoever things
[1:06:01] are true
[1:06:02] we just are hearing this morning a true
[1:06:05] report of the gospel
[1:06:08] what sort of things are true what sort
[1:06:09] of things are honest what sort of things
[1:06:11] are just
[1:06:12] pure lovely what several things have a
[1:06:15] good report
[1:06:16] if there be any strength if there be any
[1:06:18] praise
[1:06:20] think on these things well what what's
[1:06:22] going to happen if i follow this
[1:06:24] example i'm going to tell you what's
[1:06:25] going to happen here those
[1:06:28] things which you have both learned
[1:06:30] received
[1:06:31] heard seen in me if you do them
[1:06:35] the god of peace shall be with you
[1:06:38] amen how many wants the peace of god
[1:06:42] follow the example follow the example
[1:06:47] i can do all things through christ you
[1:06:48] strengthen me first thessalonians
[1:06:51] chapter 2 verse 13 for this calls also
[1:06:53] thank we god
[1:06:56] without ceasing because when you receive
[1:06:57] the word of god
[1:06:59] which he heard of us he received it not
[1:07:02] as
[1:07:03] it was the word of paul
[1:07:08] but as it is truth the word of god
[1:07:12] which effectually worketh
[1:07:15] in those that actually believe it
[1:07:19] remember the word did not profit the
[1:07:21] hebrews
[1:07:22] not being mixed with that's for me
[1:07:25] that's for me
[1:07:28] the promised land for me
[1:07:34] for verse 14 for ye brethren became
[1:07:37] followers
[1:07:39] of the churches of god which are in
[1:07:41] judah
[1:07:42] are in christ in judea
[1:07:46] are in christ jesus for ye also have
[1:07:49] suffered
[1:07:50] look at that light things for your own
[1:07:52] countrymen
[1:07:53] even as have the jews we're going to
[1:07:56] become a follower of somebody
[1:08:01] you're following somebody
[1:08:04] we all are
[1:08:08] follow the example in the word amen
[1:08:12] let my word be a lie
[1:08:16] but i'm not up here preaching my word
[1:08:22] stay with the word of god all heavens
[1:08:24] behind it
[1:08:25] heaven is not behind my word my word is
[1:08:29] not being preached today
[1:08:30] god's words being preached today
[1:08:34] first thessalonians 3 verse 1 wherefore
[1:08:37] when ye
[1:08:38] could no longer forebear we thought it
[1:08:40] could
[1:08:41] to be left at athens alone and sent to
[1:08:43] timotheus our brother and minister of
[1:08:45] god and our fellow labor in the gospel
[1:08:46] of christ who
[1:08:47] what establish you and to comfort you
[1:08:50] concerning your faith
[1:08:52] look at this that no man should be moved
[1:08:56] by these afflictions see the temptation
[1:09:01] for yourselves no it's been preached to
[1:09:04] you
[1:09:05] that ye are appointed thereunto
[1:09:08] for verily when ye were when we were
[1:09:11] with you we told you before
[1:09:13] that we should suffer tribulation as it
[1:09:15] came to passion you know
[1:09:17] you want to be a christian things are
[1:09:19] coming right
[1:09:21] you want to be a modern christian yeah
[1:09:24] that's true you probably aren't going to
[1:09:28] suffer
[1:09:31] remember the boy who went to college
[1:09:34] he's a christian mom at home praying
[1:09:38] oh just protect him protect him while
[1:09:41] he's away at college
[1:09:43] he's gonna go through all that
[1:09:44] persecution
[1:09:46] bonnie come home for christmas his mom
[1:09:48] asked him
[1:09:50] son how did it go at college how'd it go
[1:09:54] did you get persecuted did you have a
[1:09:56] hard time
[1:09:58] and the boy said oh mom they didn't
[1:10:00] expect a thing
[1:10:05] another gospel one where you don't show
[1:10:09] what you really believe right amen
[1:10:12] one that's all up here amen and not
[1:10:15] lived
[1:10:16] out here you live it out here you will
[1:10:18] suffer persecution
[1:10:20] you have it all up here you won't suffer
[1:10:23] it's a different gospel
[1:10:25] hebrews chapter 11 verse 24 we're almost
[1:10:28] done saints by
[1:10:29] faith moses when he had come to years
[1:10:32] refused to be called the son of
[1:10:35] pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:10:37] suffer
[1:10:38] affliction with the people of god and to
[1:10:40] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
[1:10:42] it's our choice
[1:10:45] and you stop this tape whenever you need
[1:10:47] to and
[1:10:48] james chapter 5 verse 10 take my brother
[1:10:51] and the prophets who have spoken in the
[1:10:52] name of the lord what for
[1:10:54] an example of what
[1:10:57] of suffering affliction and of patience
[1:11:03] they've spoken in the name of the lord
[1:11:04] as an example of suffering and fiction
[1:11:06] and a patience
[1:11:07] but we count them happy which endure
[1:11:11] for you have heard of the patience of
[1:11:12] job and have seen the end of the lord
[1:11:15] that the lord is very pitiful and tender
[1:11:17] mercy
[1:11:24] jesus speaking in mark chapter 4 verse
[1:11:26] 16 and these
[1:11:28] are likewise which are sown on stony
[1:11:30] ground
[1:11:31] who when they have heard the word
[1:11:32] immediately receive it with gladness
[1:11:34] and have no root in themselves and
[1:11:36] endure for a time and afterwards
[1:11:38] when afflic when affliction and
[1:11:40] persecution arises for the word
[1:11:42] sake immediately they're offended
[1:11:45] i know a lot of times we can come to
[1:11:47] church or we feel all beat up and we
[1:11:48] just you know we want the word to just
[1:11:50] you know really really you know help us
[1:11:54] because we've just been so afflicted and
[1:11:55] persecuted through the week
[1:12:01] through the week what have we done
[1:12:02] through the week to deal with that
[1:12:05] why do we expect the word to do that
[1:12:08] jesus answer to someone in that
[1:12:11] condition
[1:12:12] was not an encouraging message friends
[1:12:15] it was to get deeper rooted
[1:12:19] in your heart to have a heart that's
[1:12:22] more prepared
[1:12:24] to get the hardness out of your heart
[1:12:27] that was his answer
[1:12:29] to the to the scenario
[1:12:32] but we want something different
[1:12:35] i know i'm going to get persecuted a lot
[1:12:37] for this message
[1:12:38] no one's going to say anything to my
[1:12:40] face
[1:12:44] acts chapter 14 verse 22 confirming
[1:12:48] the souls of the disciples and exhorting
[1:12:50] them to continue in the faith
[1:12:52] and that we must through much
[1:12:53] tribulation
[1:12:55] enter the kingdom of god why are we
[1:12:58] looking
[1:12:59] to enter in with just flowery
[1:13:01] revelations from the pulpit
[1:13:04] make our head spin and go wow
[1:13:08] wow and our life
[1:13:12] is no different not willing to lay down
[1:13:16] our lives wash somebody's feet
[1:13:20] get somebody saved
[1:13:23] it's a different gospel friends satan
[1:13:26] just
[1:13:26] a little bit wants to twist it
[1:13:30] you know i'd rather have you all hate me
[1:13:33] but go out of here and try harder to
[1:13:36] live for god
[1:13:41] because i've achieved my goal which is
[1:13:44] to get you closer to god
[1:13:54] let's stand together
