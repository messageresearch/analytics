[31:40] our our biblical life is the
[31:43] the
[31:44] only bible that some people will ever
[31:47] read the bible says that we are written
[31:49] epistles
[31:52] and uh
[31:54] so we want to be the right example do we
[31:56] not
[31:57] amen let's bow our head and just in a
[32:00] word of prayer
[32:02] before we read the scriptures heavenly
[32:04] father
[32:05] we thank you
[32:08] for your grace and our lives today
[32:11] it's only by your grace that we're
[32:12] standing here with the desire to serve
[32:14] you
[32:15] lord we don't got to look back too far
[32:18] in our life to see that there was a time
[32:22] that we didn't even retain you in our
[32:24] thoughts didn't have a desire
[32:27] we just wanted to do our own thing
[32:29] go our own way
[32:35] but lord you got our attention you put
[32:37] us on the right track
[32:39] and here we are by your grace today
[32:41] standing with a desire to serve you
[32:45] we want to thank you from the bottom of
[32:46] our heart we want to be that one leper
[32:48] that came back
[32:49] to give you thanks for
[32:51] making our lives whole lord
[32:55] pray lord that you just take control of
[32:57] all the
[32:58] spirits lord
[33:01] lord
[33:04] any thing that would him try to hinder
[33:06] the service lord any doubts any
[33:08] fears questions just remove it from our
[33:11] midst
[33:12] may your sweet peace love
[33:15] be preeminent lord as you lead and guide
[33:18] us into your word today
[33:21] lord we want to
[33:23] leave here so focused
[33:25] on you lord
[33:26] that nothing
[33:28] could distract us away from it
[33:32] pray lord you forgive us of our sins and
[33:34] trespasses
[33:36] oh mighty god
[33:38] we need you in this hour
[33:40] pray that you come and meet all the
[33:41] needs that would be amongst us as we
[33:43] present him to you lord
[33:45] take this word lord that be ministered
[33:47] and through that word i pray
[33:49] lord not one need would would be un met
[33:53] because lord you're able to do
[33:55] exceedingly above all that we would ask
[33:56] or even thank you we're trusting in you
[33:59] today lord we give you praise and honor
[34:02] in jesus precious name amen
[34:06] just want to read one verse there and
[34:08] that's verse number 11
[34:11] beloved follow not that which is evil
[34:16] but follow that which is good
[34:19] he that doeth good is of god but he that
[34:21] doeth evil
[34:23] have not seen god
[34:25] you may be seated god bless you but we
[34:27] just want to really take the first
[34:29] part of that
[34:30] beloved follow not that which is evil
[34:34] but follow that
[34:35] which is good
[34:38] now when we think about what is evil we
[34:40] could be thinking
[34:42] you know drastic something drastic like
[34:44] the occult or the illuminati
[34:47] or people who just just worship evil
[34:51] but
[34:52] we all know that our own desires can be
[34:54] evil
[34:57] so we must be careful
[35:00] who we are following because we don't
[35:02] know their desires
[35:05] they could be evil
[35:08] so for a subject we want to take we
[35:10] become
[35:11] the example
[35:12] we follow
[35:14] we become the example that we follow
[35:18] so we want to entitle this message
[35:19] following the right example
[35:23] another scripture we just want to read
[35:25] before we get started here is saint john
[35:27] chapter 13
[35:29] starting with verse number 12. we want
[35:30] to take a look
[35:31] at the right example that that's jesus
[35:34] christ
[35:36] god
[35:37] i want to say god bless her friends here
[35:40] that are
[35:41] anne's friend
[35:43] joelle and her husband mike
[35:45] god bless you sorry that i didn't say
[35:47] something sooner so good to have you
[35:49] here with us today may the lord bless
[35:51] you today as our prayer
[35:54] here
[35:55] uh starting in verse number 12 of saint
[35:57] john chapter 13
[36:00] so after he had washed their feet
[36:04] after jesus had washed their feet and
[36:06] taken his garment and was set down again
[36:11] he said unto them know ye what i have
[36:15] done to you
[36:17] you call me master and lord and you say
[36:19] well for so i am
[36:22] if i then your lord and your master have
[36:24] washed your feet
[36:26] ye also ought to wash one another's feet
[36:29] for i have given you
[36:31] an example
[36:33] that you should do
[36:35] as i have done unto you
[36:38] when it comes to following the right
[36:40] example there are
[36:41] a couple very important things to
[36:43] remember right off the bat number one is
[36:46] awareness
[36:47] here jesus says do you know what i've
[36:49] done right amen if we're not
[36:52] even aware of what's happening in front
[36:54] of us we're not going to catch it
[36:57] and two
[36:58] is that we got to have enough of a
[37:00] desire
[37:02] to follow the right example
[37:05] because
[37:06] our flesh is lazy
[37:09] our flesh
[37:11] it doesn't always want to do the right
[37:13] thing
[37:15] and the bible tells us that they
[37:17] overcame the devil
[37:19] in their lives the very accuser of the
[37:21] brother by the blood of the lamb by the
[37:22] word of their testimony and they love
[37:24] not their lives unto the death
[37:27] and if we're going to follow the right
[37:28] example we've got to hate our flesh
[37:31] the wrong desire the laziness
[37:35] feeling that it's adequate in the area
[37:38] that it's living today amen
[37:42] now we are presently living in the most
[37:44] deceptive time in history
[37:47] of all mankind
[37:48] today you would think that
[37:51] with things being so bad it would be
[37:53] quite easy to discern the difference
[37:55] between
[37:57] right wrong
[37:58] but jesus said the two spirits in our
[38:00] age would be so close that only the
[38:02] elected would come to see the actual
[38:04] truth
[38:08] now imagine that the whole world was
[38:10] just a real holy place and there was
[38:13] only
[38:14] a little
[38:15] bit of evil
[38:20] it would be much easier to me
[38:23] to see it
[38:25] but because there's so much evil
[38:27] everywhere all i have to do is say i'm a
[38:30] little bit better than that person i'm a
[38:32] little bit better than that person and
[38:34] feel that i'm okay
[38:36] and this is what's deceptive about this
[38:38] age
[38:40] now this means the examples being set
[38:44] before us would be so close
[38:47] it would deceive the very elect if it
[38:49] were possible
[38:51] if the two spirits
[38:53] are there that means the two examples
[38:57] both examples would have some form of
[39:00] godliness to him
[39:01] but only one would have the power of the
[39:04] holy ghost
[39:06] now scripture tells us to get away from
[39:08] any religious spirit that that professes
[39:12] a form
[39:14] of godliness amen
[39:16] but
[39:17] does not have the power to actually
[39:19] manifest the gospel
[39:22] so words are dangerous if you know what
[39:24] i'm saying now why is why is this
[39:27] jesus said if the blind lead the blind
[39:29] they both fall in the ditch
[39:32] he said let them alone
[39:35] amen a form of godliness stay away from
[39:38] it get away from it
[39:40] you don't want to entangle yourself with
[39:43] the thinking that it's okay
[39:46] because what it's going to do is suck
[39:48] you into it
[39:51] amen did you ever notice when you see
[39:53] somebody hang out with somebody for a
[39:56] certain period of time
[39:58] that they begin to act like them
[40:03] don't last forever it only lasts for a
[40:05] certain amount of time
[40:08] why is that it's because people catch
[40:11] one another's spirit
[40:12] that's right
[40:13] they end up following the spirit they're
[40:16] around and this is why we need to be
[40:18] careful about what spirit we're
[40:20] following
[40:22] we become the example that we follow
[40:27] so follow the right example
[40:29] we don't want to be satisfied with just
[40:31] a form of religion
[40:33] but a power
[40:35] a power
[40:36] to live the gospel
[40:41] everyone wants to be followed
[40:44] look at twitter
[40:46] facebook
[40:47] pinterest look at my website everyone
[40:50] wants to have a following
[40:53] but if you follow the wrong example
[40:56] you're going to end up falling
[40:58] in the same place that they're going to
[40:59] fall
[41:01] it's more important to know
[41:03] what you're following and who you're
[41:04] following than we actually think
[41:09] i know we want to thank the best of
[41:10] everybody
[41:12] but we just need to understand
[41:14] i am a sinful man
[41:19] there's only one example for us all to
[41:21] follow and that's jesus christ
[41:28] everyone is following somebody
[41:32] some example
[41:34] whether they know it or not
[41:36] whether they want to admit it or not
[41:39] so it's crucial to be following the
[41:40] right example
[41:42] jesus said follow me
[41:45] and satan said do your own thing go
[41:48] where you want to go be what you want to
[41:49] be and then don't worry you're still
[41:51] following jesus
[41:54] see one is the right spirit and the
[41:56] other is deceptive
[41:58] one is the right example and the other
[42:00] is a deceptive example
[42:04] now
[42:05] we don't want to
[42:07] be little examples because they are
[42:10] crucial
[42:11] they are needful
[42:13] they are
[42:14] one of the most powerful teachers that
[42:18] we can learn from is an example
[42:22] we don't retain much from what we hear
[42:28] we retain more by what we see
[42:32] and because we all know
[42:34] that everybody has the ability to talk
[42:38] but very few few people have the ability
[42:40] to live what they're saying
[42:44] examples
[42:46] are the most powerful tools that can
[42:48] teach others with
[42:51] so never underestimate the power of an
[42:54] example
[42:55] i'll talk about one in the bible
[42:57] jesus had picked his chosen apostles he
[43:00] personally taught them how to disciple
[43:04] and before jesus left the earth
[43:07] he told them that all power was given
[43:09] unto him
[43:10] in heaven
[43:11] and in earth
[43:13] and he said in matthew 28 verse 19 he
[43:15] said go ye therefore and teach all
[43:17] nations baptizing them in the name of
[43:19] the father and of the son and the holy
[43:21] ghost
[43:22] teaching them to observe all things
[43:23] whatsoever i've commanded you and lo i
[43:25] am with you always even to the end of
[43:27] the world
[43:28] amen
[43:31] now these were the words of jesus
[43:34] that he taught to his
[43:36] his own apostles
[43:38] and he taught them how to disciple
[43:40] others
[43:41] and he gives them this last message
[43:43] before he leaves
[43:45] and it seems pretty cut and dry that
[43:47] they're supposed to go out and they're
[43:49] supposed to
[43:51] tell others about jesus and and and
[43:53] baptize them uh in the name of the
[43:56] father
[43:58] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[44:03] i'll tell you we'd be in bad shape if we
[44:04] didn't have a biblical example on this
[44:08] one would think we don't need an example
[44:11] it's pretty cut and dry what jesus wants
[44:13] us to do
[44:15] and that's why there's so many churches
[44:17] out there that are baptizing the titles
[44:20] father son and holy ghost
[44:23] because they believe
[44:26] in what they
[44:28] see jesus saying here
[44:31] without a biblical example
[44:39] but the apostles never baptized
[44:43] believers that way
[44:46] not once in the bible is recorded that
[44:49] anyone ever baptized in the titles
[44:52] i know the majority of the church world
[44:54] baptizes that way
[44:58] but we can't find one biblical example
[45:01] the only example that we could find is
[45:04] turn with me to acts chapter 2.
[45:11] the example of what jesus spoke spoke
[45:15] louder
[45:17] than the actual words to many believers
[45:20] today
[45:21] i've heard some ministers say well i'll
[45:23] take what jesus said over what the
[45:26] apostle said
[45:28] all sudden we're going to begin to
[45:30] interpret that some of the word is
[45:32] correct and some of the word is not
[45:35] before you know it you have no
[45:37] foundation of what is true
[45:39] amen
[45:41] jesus meant exactly what he said amen
[45:44] but we need the right interpretation and
[45:46] i'll say today we need the right example
[45:49] set before one another
[45:54] therefore let us
[45:56] verse 36 therefore let all the house of
[45:58] israel know or surely that god has made
[46:01] the same jesus whom you have crucified
[46:03] both lord
[46:06] and christ
[46:09] this same jesus is both
[46:12] jehovah lord jehovah
[46:15] and
[46:16] the anointed
[46:18] messiah the the holy ghost
[46:22] he's all three
[46:24] remember jesus said all power is given
[46:27] unto me in heaven and earth
[46:29] that's what exactly what what peter is
[46:31] saying right here
[46:33] and when they heard this they were
[46:34] pricked in their heart
[46:36] and they said unto peter to the rest of
[46:38] the apostles
[46:39] men and brethren
[46:41] what shall we do to be saved what do we
[46:43] need to really do
[46:45] and then peter said unto them repent and
[46:48] be baptized every one of you in the name
[46:51] of jesus christ
[46:54] what i got to do that
[46:56] it's for the remission of your sins
[46:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[47:02] holy ghost it's a promise he said for
[47:04] their promises unto you to your children
[47:07] and to all that are afar off even as
[47:10] many as the lord our god shall call
[47:12] and with many other words did he testify
[47:14] and exert saying save yourself
[47:19] you're the only one that can do that
[47:21] you've got to make a decision which
[47:23] direction you're going to go save
[47:25] yourselves from this entre generation
[47:28] now look at this verse i love this
[47:30] then they that gladly received the word
[47:33] they were baptized
[47:35] and the same day they were
[47:37] there were added unto them about 3
[47:40] 000
[47:41] souls
[47:43] notice what was added the souls
[47:45] not the bodies not church members
[47:50] not faithful students of the word no
[47:53] they were souls
[47:56] examples
[47:58] are very needful
[48:00] they're powerful
[48:03] paul the right one keeps us out of
[48:05] trouble
[48:07] and i'll just i'm going to say from the
[48:08] bottom of my heart i'm so glad
[48:10] that you have not followed all of my
[48:12] example
[48:16] because you'd come short
[48:18] of the glory of god you would be short
[48:21] of what god is calling you to be
[48:26] that's why we should never put man above
[48:28] what he is man is a man
[48:30] that's it man is a man you're a man
[48:32] you're a woman that's all you are
[48:35] now the god in you he's greater than
[48:37] that
[48:40] praise the lord
[48:42] that's right
[48:44] and we don't gotta go ahead and and try
[48:46] to dissect everyone's life
[48:50] all we got to know is the right example
[48:53] and then we'll know who's following it
[48:55] and who's not right
[48:58] it's real simple
[49:02] examples are powerful
[49:04] when god places a good example in our
[49:07] lives he expects us to follow that
[49:09] example
[49:12] as we go through these scriptures today
[49:13] we'll discover that examples are without
[49:16] the use of words
[49:19] examples are the manifestation of words
[49:23] they show the character or the
[49:24] illustration of words
[49:28] we all follow examples
[49:31] we do we follow somebody and we're all
[49:33] an example to somebody
[49:36] parents want to be a good role model for
[49:38] their children
[49:41] god has placed good examples for our
[49:42] lives to follow but he's also placed bad
[49:46] examples
[49:47] i shouldn't say his place
[49:49] he is allowed
[49:51] better word he has allowed bad examples
[49:53] in her life to teach us
[49:58] so we can learn
[50:00] what not to follow
[50:02] i used to say when i was a i learned
[50:03] more from people's mistakes than i ever
[50:06] do from the good that they're doing
[50:11] it's about being aware of what's right
[50:12] and wrong
[50:16] i i mean when i was a boy
[50:20] we were all kids right so at one time we
[50:22] all stole and lied and did lots of stuff
[50:25] right
[50:26] it was just
[50:27] not been our parents might have been our
[50:28] brother and sister might have been
[50:30] everybody i remember going into a store
[50:31] and wanting to steal something
[50:36] wasn't mine
[50:39] but
[50:40] hey this is the thing that you did this
[50:42] is how i watched others
[50:44] right
[50:46] yeah
[50:47] i mean i i used to
[50:49] you know my
[50:51] little history with
[50:52] drugs but you know i was following the
[50:55] wrong group
[50:57] i was following the wrong example
[51:01] and it took me i became what i followed
[51:08] we just we don't want to follow a good
[51:11] church member we don't want to follow
[51:13] somebody to church
[51:15] we want to follow christ
[51:18] we want to become him
[51:20] we don't want to be a good church member
[51:32] one thing i've noticed in our lives
[51:38] about examples
[51:39] that they want to be followed whether
[51:41] they're good or bad
[51:44] it doesn't matter if parents yell at
[51:46] their kids all the time
[51:48] they still want them to listen to them
[51:52] so good example or bad example
[51:56] it wants to be followed
[51:59] generally speaking people care more
[52:00] about their reputation and getting what
[52:02] they want than the example that they're
[52:04] studying
[52:08] many you just don't care very much about
[52:09] their example they're under the delusion
[52:12] that their example doesn't mean very
[52:13] much
[52:17] like their words outweigh their example
[52:23] words are easy to say
[52:26] they take much less effort than living
[52:28] out the example of those words
[52:30] i'll never forget my dad tell me
[52:34] he says don't you ever smoke because he
[52:36] held a cigarette in his hand
[52:39] he said it's bad for you
[52:41] how can i forget
[52:43] that
[52:45] it would have been so much better
[52:47] if he never smoked and said the words to
[52:49] me
[52:51] words are easy to say
[52:53] words like we should love one another
[52:56] but it's much harder to live out the
[52:58] example of it
[53:02] it's harder to turn the cheek go the
[53:04] second mile pray for those who
[53:05] despitefully use you
[53:08] jesus never said by these words that you
[53:11] speak shall all men know you're my
[53:13] disciples
[53:16] he said by their fruit you'll know them
[53:19] by the example when they wash dirty feet
[53:24] when they lay down their lives one for
[53:26] another by this shall all men know
[53:29] you're my disciples when you have love
[53:32] one for another.
[53:34] so it's the example that we are setting
[53:37] and not the words that we're speaking
[53:42] examples
[53:44] are visuals for us
[53:46] they express more clearly what detail
[53:49] the words are saying
[53:51] they give meaning to words
[53:55] we've often heard the expression
[53:58] visuals help me to see
[54:02] they simply give a broader understanding
[54:05] to words
[54:07] brother branham said in a message
[54:08] investments he said your life
[54:11] will shine
[54:13] a lot
[54:14] louder
[54:16] than your testimony
[54:17] could ever give
[54:20] now he didn't say the same amount
[54:24] here there
[54:25] he said a lot
[54:28] because it's harder
[54:30] to live what you're speaking
[54:36] he said your life is so loud
[54:39] till the people don't even understand
[54:41] your testimony
[54:43] in other words it becomes confusing when
[54:45] you say that
[54:47] that you're a born-again christian and
[54:49] you do the things that born and
[54:51] christians don't do
[54:54] come on there should be lots of
[54:56] lots of amen now i'm not talking about
[54:58] mistakes now we all make them
[55:01] and we got enough evidence against us to
[55:03] hang us and put us in hell but thank god
[55:05] for the blood
[55:06] but i'm talking about the life that
[55:08] we're living the example that we're
[55:10] studying every day
[55:13] examples should be of the utmost
[55:15] importance to us
[55:18] those who are ignorant
[55:20] or don't care about their example
[55:23] will end up following the wrong example
[55:27] then they will become a wrong example
[55:31] so the blind lead the blind they both
[55:33] fall in the ditch
[55:36] that's why when you you're trying to
[55:38] help somebody if there's just mine so
[55:40] made up that they're right
[55:41] let them alone
[55:45] jesus said my sheep hear my voice and
[55:47] they follow
[55:49] the right example
[55:51] they follow him amen that's right
[55:55] we've got to be more concerned about the
[55:57] example we're following and the example
[55:59] that we are leading
[56:03] i think i've learned as i said more from
[56:05] other people's mistakes
[56:07] than people's right example
[56:10] because we can learn
[56:12] from one another
[56:16] you ever swat somebody do something you
[56:19] say why did they do that
[56:22] you want to know bad enough for the
[56:23] right motive
[56:25] god will show you
[56:27] that's good
[56:28] yes
[56:30] awareness is crucial for learning amen
[56:36] jesus taught many things
[56:38] from other people's wrong examples
[56:42] jesus said remember lot's wife
[56:45] remember the example of lot
[56:48] his wife
[56:50] she just wanted
[56:53] to look back
[56:55] take one more last look
[57:01] we don't want to do that amen
[57:06] jesus taught us
[57:08] by
[57:09] that
[57:10] example as it was in the days of noah so
[57:13] shall be in the coming of the son of man
[57:16] here jesus is wanting us to look back at
[57:19] the example the time that noah lived
[57:22] there's only a few that made it
[57:24] had 120 years to preach it
[57:30] but only a few made it
[57:32] they didn't believe in fact they they
[57:34] mocked
[57:35] noah
[57:38] the bible says there was only evil
[57:39] continually on the minds of the people
[57:41] that during that age
[57:44] kind of what's happening now
[57:46] they didn't like to retain god in their
[57:48] minds
[57:50] jesus said in luke chapter 17 verse 28
[57:53] likewise also as it was in the days of
[57:56] lot
[57:57] they did eat and they drank and they
[57:59] bought and they sold they planned and
[58:00] they built it we think well that's
[58:01] pretty normal life
[58:03] yes
[58:05] it seems normal
[58:07] but the same day that lot went out of
[58:10] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[58:11] heaven and destroyed them all
[58:16] so we can't look to the news to the bind
[58:18] to the new building that's going on
[58:21] two we got another year to plant things
[58:24] right we can just get together and have
[58:25] fellowship and eat and drink we can't
[58:27] look at that as as he's not coming
[58:30] right
[58:32] even thus shall it be in the day when
[58:34] the son of man
[58:35] is revealed
[58:39] sodom
[58:40] was so filled
[58:42] with the gay movement
[58:52] if any of what we see today
[58:54] it's growing like a rampage
[58:59] and what happened
[59:00] god destroyed it with fire
[59:06] the son of man has been revealed
[59:10] we're living in the hour
[59:13] it's later than we think
[59:17] jude chapter 1 verse 7 says even as
[59:19] sodom and gomor and the cities about
[59:21] them and like men are giving themselves
[59:23] over to fornication
[59:25] and giving and going after
[59:28] strange flesh
[59:30] oh my
[59:33] people don't even know who they are
[59:34] anymore
[59:36] are set forth at for
[59:39] an example
[59:42] suffering the vengeance of eternal fire
[59:46] an example
[59:51] fire's coming again it's going to burn
[59:53] this earth
[59:58] when jude had a burden for the common
[1:00:00] salvation of the saints
[1:00:03] he said it was needful for me to write
[1:00:05] unto you and to exhort you that you
[1:00:07] should earnestly contend
[1:00:09] for the faith which was once delivered
[1:00:11] to the saints
[1:00:13] no we just can't sit around and say
[1:00:15] we're saved
[1:00:18] common salvation oh i'm saved
[1:00:22] no we've got to earnestly be contending
[1:00:27] just watch tv for four hours and tell me
[1:00:29] your faith isn't zapped
[1:00:34] you may still think
[1:00:36] you're religious you may still think
[1:00:38] you're as powerful
[1:00:39] but i'm telling you the spirits that
[1:00:41] come off of that thing
[1:00:44] they just take away the real true
[1:00:46] genuine joy inside of us
[1:00:51] jude chapter 1 verse 5 says i will
[1:00:53] therefore put you in remembrance
[1:00:56] here goes teaching by the wrong example
[1:00:58] now
[1:00:59] though he once knew this
[1:01:01] how that the lord having saved the
[1:01:03] people of the land of egypt afterwards
[1:01:06] destroyed them
[1:01:09] that believe not
[1:01:11] in earnestly
[1:01:12] contending
[1:01:14] for the faith
[1:01:16] i'm saved i'm out of egypt everything's
[1:01:18] okay i don't need to press in
[1:01:21] and go all the way to the promised land
[1:01:23] i'll serve god over here
[1:01:28] if we're not earnestly contending you
[1:01:30] have one that's not happy with you
[1:01:33] the one that you claim that loves you
[1:01:35] yes he loves you but he wants you to be
[1:01:37] pressing for more than what you got
[1:01:39] today
[1:01:46] jude was reminding the believer that
[1:01:47] just because you've received salvation
[1:01:49] doesn't mean it's time to take it easy
[1:01:53] we got to earnestly contend
[1:01:56] or we're going to miss something god has
[1:01:58] has promised us
[1:02:00] the writer of hebrews now he used the
[1:02:02] same example
[1:02:04] in hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 he said let
[1:02:06] us therefore fear
[1:02:08] last a promise being left us of entering
[1:02:10] into his rest
[1:02:12] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:02:14] it
[1:02:14] quran just was the gospel preached as
[1:02:16] well as unto them but the word preached
[1:02:18] did not profit them because it wasn't
[1:02:20] mixed with faith when they heard it
[1:02:23] he concludes here in verse 11 let us
[1:02:26] labor therefore to enter
[1:02:28] into that rest lest any of you fall
[1:02:32] after the same
[1:02:34] example
[1:02:37] of unbelief
[1:02:38] don't say i i would i would never do
[1:02:41] that i would be next to joshua and caleb
[1:02:43] yeah you can't say that
[1:02:47] you've got to live that
[1:02:50] come on you've got to live that
[1:02:54] you've got to be the one that says we're
[1:02:55] more than able to take the promises of
[1:02:57] god for our time god is the same
[1:03:00] yesterday today and forever he hasn't
[1:03:02] lost his power
[1:03:04] i can't sit back and say well i'm still
[1:03:06] part of the group
[1:03:11] we're living in an hour of lukewarmness
[1:03:14] laodicea
[1:03:16] in need of nothing
[1:03:19] as they fell from their own
[1:03:21] steadfastness we can fall from our own
[1:03:23] steadfastness
[1:03:26] you know what that means
[1:03:29] partial rest
[1:03:32] partial rest don't be confused with a
[1:03:35] partial rest to the rest that god has
[1:03:38] for us there remains a complete resting
[1:03:40] god to your life is so sold out to god
[1:03:43] that you don't worry about anything
[1:03:46] that you live all things work together
[1:03:48] for the good in your life no matter what
[1:03:50] happens
[1:03:53] when the children of israel were in
[1:03:55] bondage they cried out for deliverance
[1:03:58] and jehovah god saved them
[1:04:02] and after their deliverance you know
[1:04:03] what happened
[1:04:04] they literally lost
[1:04:07] their thankfulness
[1:04:12] we just had thanksgiving
[1:04:14] to me brother ron should have been up
[1:04:16] here seeing such a wave of thanksgiving
[1:04:18] coming amen
[1:04:22] they murmured they complained how can
[1:04:24] you be thankful remember to complain
[1:04:28] about what they had to go through as if
[1:04:31] god made a mistake in their life
[1:04:35] they stopped wanting to go to church you
[1:04:36] know
[1:04:38] their hearts became hardened
[1:04:40] when they heard god's word
[1:04:43] they didn't want to be under god's
[1:04:45] leadership they wanted somebody else who
[1:04:47] would take them with their desires which
[1:04:49] was the easier path
[1:04:54] paul referred to their example when he
[1:04:57] wrote in corinthians
[1:04:58] chapter 10 verse
[1:05:00] 5 first corinthians chapter 10 verse 5
[1:05:02] he says but
[1:05:03] with many of them god was not well
[1:05:06] pleased
[1:05:08] for they were overthrown in the
[1:05:10] wilderness
[1:05:12] now these things
[1:05:14] were our examples
[1:05:16] to the intent that we should not lust
[1:05:19] after evil things
[1:05:21] as they also lusted
[1:05:25] examples teaching
[1:05:28] by
[1:05:30] someone who did the wrong thing
[1:05:34] now what evil things are they talking
[1:05:36] about
[1:05:38] i'll just say it like this to bring it
[1:05:40] home
[1:05:41] any desire that keeps you away from
[1:05:43] pressing into the full
[1:05:45] nature of jesus christ is an evil desire
[1:05:51] we're calling for one thing to become
[1:05:53] like jesus
[1:05:57] i know satan is he's been there from the
[1:06:00] beginning i remember at the very
[1:06:02] beginning
[1:06:06] tell me i could still keep my worldly
[1:06:08] records and serve god
[1:06:11] so i i'm going to church now i'm in the
[1:06:13] message
[1:06:15] much farther along than i was
[1:06:20] so many things he dealt with me but this
[1:06:22] flesh didn't want to give it up
[1:06:25] perhaps we got things in our lives that
[1:06:26] we don't want to give up
[1:06:29] you need to look at those things
[1:06:33] they can keep you from where god is
[1:06:34] calling you too
[1:06:37] now it doesn't matter if you're
[1:06:38] following the same group as in the
[1:06:40] message of the hour
[1:06:41] if we're eating the same spiritual meat
[1:06:44] which is the word of the hour and
[1:06:46] drinking of the same holy ghost presence
[1:06:49] among us
[1:06:51] we know what happens if we do not
[1:06:53] continue to follow the leadership of the
[1:06:55] lord
[1:06:59] do you see how we can learn
[1:07:02] from a lot of people's
[1:07:04] wrong mistakes yes amen they're written
[1:07:06] for our our admonition amen for our for
[1:07:10] us first corinthians chapter 10 verse 11
[1:07:13] says now all these things happen unto
[1:07:15] them
[1:07:16] for examples
[1:07:18] and they're written for our
[1:07:20] admonition
[1:07:22] that means to call to our attention or
[1:07:24] to warn us to rebuke us
[1:07:27] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[1:07:29] wherefore let him that thinketh he stand
[1:07:31] he needs to take heed amen
[1:07:34] take heed
[1:07:35] lest he fall
[1:07:37] the worst thing that we could do is
[1:07:39] compare ourselves with somebody else
[1:07:41] that it's not doing as good as we
[1:07:46] the wisest thing to do is compare
[1:07:48] yourself with somebody who's doing
[1:07:50] better than you
[1:07:51] that is the wisest thing you could do
[1:07:58] so often i remember growing up in church
[1:08:02] thinking
[1:08:03] you know because in a church you got a
[1:08:05] lot of different beliefs
[1:08:07] same group
[1:08:08] but you get along with them and you're
[1:08:10] talking with them
[1:08:11] and you find out
[1:08:13] that there's different beliefs
[1:08:15] then what the message taught
[1:08:19] and i remember
[1:08:22] thinking to myself
[1:08:24] well it would be easier if i believe
[1:08:26] like this one because they don't
[1:08:28] it's okay to do this and do that and and
[1:08:30] they they're still coming
[1:08:34] you know we're all faced with that right
[1:08:37] we're all faced with an opportunity to
[1:08:39] choose the easier path
[1:08:43] the problem is
[1:08:44] you're getting your eyes off
[1:08:47] the real example
[1:08:49] the real example and getting your eyes
[1:08:52] on a human being who does not have a
[1:08:54] true revelation of the word
[1:08:57] of the message of the hour
[1:09:00] but because he seems religious or she
[1:09:02] seems religious or she's got this or
[1:09:04] that or she can prove this or indeed
[1:09:07] right
[1:09:08] it just doesn't matter
[1:09:10] we should be concerned is it lining up
[1:09:12] with the word or not
[1:09:15] samples are important
[1:09:17] we need to watch
[1:09:19] who we're following because we will
[1:09:20] become who we're following
[1:09:26] and remember
[1:09:27] you're following somebody
[1:09:30] and somebody is following you
[1:09:38] so the quicker you get them off you
[1:09:40] get them on jesus less pressure
[1:09:46] i'm not saying right examples are easy
[1:09:48] to follow
[1:09:51] they're hard to live and they're hard to
[1:09:52] follow
[1:09:54] jesus considered his way
[1:09:57] to be the hardest
[1:09:58] of all right
[1:10:00] the hardest way it's the hardest example
[1:10:03] it's full of trials
[1:10:05] afflictions tribulations
[1:10:08] separations disappointments you go
[1:10:10] through a lot when you follow the lord
[1:10:14] you can't live for yourself anymore you
[1:10:16] have to live for others right isn't it
[1:10:18] sad the way i put that yeah to live for
[1:10:21] others
[1:10:23] like there's no joy in it
[1:10:26] you have to love others more than you
[1:10:28] love yourself
[1:10:31] the right example is to be concerned
[1:10:33] more about others
[1:10:36] tend to be concerned about your own self
[1:10:45] the right examples in the bible teach us
[1:10:47] the correct way regardless of how hard
[1:10:50] the way may seem
[1:10:52] so following the right example and being
[1:10:54] the right example requires a strong
[1:10:57] faith
[1:11:00] not a strong
[1:11:01] will a strong personality
[1:11:04] uh
[1:11:06] a strong
[1:11:07] gifts
[1:11:09] no
[1:11:10] a strong faith to be able to stand
[1:11:13] the test
[1:11:14] the trials
[1:11:16] the things that you
[1:11:18] come up against that you could still
[1:11:20] stand there
[1:11:22] and know
[1:11:23] that you're doing the right thing
[1:11:26] james chapter 5 verse 10 says take my
[1:11:30] brethren the prophets
[1:11:32] who have spoken
[1:11:34] in the name of the lord
[1:11:36] for an example
[1:11:39] of suffering affliction
[1:11:42] and of
[1:11:43] patience
[1:11:44] behold
[1:11:46] we count them happy
[1:11:48] which
[1:11:49] endure
[1:11:50] why do we count them happy
[1:11:52] because they were strong in faith
[1:11:55] they were able to job didn't say hey
[1:11:59] this ain't fair
[1:12:00] i didn't solve this what is this
[1:12:02] happening to me
[1:12:05] i'm just gonna quit
[1:12:07] if god was really in the remember david
[1:12:09] when he looked
[1:12:10] at all the evil who were prospering in
[1:12:13] the world
[1:12:17] the bible says his foot almost
[1:12:20] stumbled then he went to church
[1:12:24] and he was listening to the word of god
[1:12:27] amen and it was there that god showed
[1:12:30] him their end
[1:12:34] prosperity doesn't mean we're
[1:12:36] prospering in the lord
[1:12:40] neither does having nothing
[1:12:42] say that
[1:12:44] god's favor isn't with us
[1:12:52] but we need to be strong
[1:12:54] or we're going to stumble
[1:12:57] and if you fall the bible just says real
[1:13:00] clear get back up quick get back up
[1:13:02] quick quick quick quick quick don't
[1:13:03] think about it don't lay there don't sit
[1:13:05] there just get back up
[1:13:07] and if you fall again get back up again
[1:13:10] be strong in faith that's what is needed
[1:13:14] behold we count them happy that which
[1:13:16] endure you have heard of the patience of
[1:13:18] job
[1:13:21] and have seen the end of the lord that
[1:13:23] he's very pitiful
[1:13:24] and
[1:13:26] and of tender mercy so if you're going
[1:13:28] through something you don't think is
[1:13:29] fair just remember so did your brother
[1:13:31] job
[1:13:32] maybe god's bragging on you too
[1:13:36] maybe he wants to show you off
[1:13:40] think about it
[1:13:42] here is
[1:13:44] lucifer
[1:13:45] who was maiden
[1:13:47] who knows how many eons be before we
[1:13:50] were right
[1:13:51] actually came to manifestation i mean
[1:13:54] we were in god's thoughts
[1:13:57] but god wants to show us off to him
[1:14:02] because it's really the battle between
[1:14:04] god and him
[1:14:05] amen amen
[1:14:07] so we got to follow the right example
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:10] first peter chapter 2 verse 20 for what
[1:14:12] glory is it when you be buffeted for
[1:14:15] your faults
[1:14:16] and you say yes you're right my bad
[1:14:21] take it patiently yeah you caught me on
[1:14:23] that one
[1:14:24] sorry
[1:14:27] but if you do well
[1:14:31] and you're
[1:14:32] suffer for it
[1:14:35] and you take it patiently
[1:14:38] you don't try to defend right how right
[1:14:40] you were
[1:14:42] the bible says this
[1:14:44] is acceptable with god so if you want to
[1:14:47] bring god
[1:14:48] a gift today
[1:14:51] god is has certain gifts that are
[1:14:53] acceptable to him he'll accept certain
[1:14:54] ones
[1:14:57] and other ones he won't accept
[1:14:59] so it's not about proving how right we
[1:15:01] are
[1:15:04] it's about
[1:15:07] taking what his word tells us to do is
[1:15:10] our example
[1:15:12] and living that out
[1:15:14] your life becomes an offering to him
[1:15:17] take it patiently
[1:15:20] you know it's real easy to take things
[1:15:22] more patiently
[1:15:24] when you realize how unworthy you are
[1:15:28] but as soon as you think you're
[1:15:30] something
[1:15:31] and you didn't deserve that
[1:15:33] and that person isn't right for doing
[1:15:35] that well then you want to show you know
[1:15:38] some
[1:15:39] self-righteous indignation
[1:15:42] but it ain't righteous indignation
[1:15:46] it's your own right
[1:15:48] the bible says
[1:15:50] god will take care of
[1:15:54] the battle
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:56] and you know what you might be
[1:15:57] interested in proving what's right and
[1:15:59] wrong but god's more interested in
[1:16:00] building your character
[1:16:02] that other person may never know who was
[1:16:04] right and wrong but if he can get his
[1:16:06] character in you that's what he really
[1:16:08] wants
[1:16:09] he's standing on the door letting you go
[1:16:12] through
[1:16:13] this little trial
[1:16:16] are you gonna slam the door and jesus
[1:16:17] say no i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:16:20] are you gonna open the door and let them
[1:16:21] in and say lord do you want me to be
[1:16:23] patient i'll be patient
[1:16:24] you want me to zip my lip i'll zip my
[1:16:26] lip
[1:16:28] we have a chance to open the door all
[1:16:29] the time to jesus not just once in our
[1:16:31] life
[1:16:32] every day he comes knocking okay it's
[1:16:34] time for school time to get up we got a
[1:16:37] test to take
[1:16:43] verse 21 for even
[1:16:46] here and two were you call it because
[1:16:48] christ also suffered for us
[1:16:50] he suffered for us
[1:16:52] leaving us an example
[1:16:55] that you should follow his steps
[1:17:00] who did no sin neither was guile found
[1:17:02] in his mouth
[1:17:03] who when reviled even vowed not again
[1:17:06] when he suffered he threatened not
[1:17:08] i'll show you
[1:17:10] but he committed himself to hand that
[1:17:13] judgeth righteously
[1:17:16] who his own self bear our sins in his
[1:17:19] own body on the tree
[1:17:22] that we being dead to sin should
[1:17:24] live unto righteousness by whose stripes
[1:17:26] ye are healed ye were healed
[1:17:29] for ye were as sheep gone astray but now
[1:17:31] return unto the ship shepherd and bishop
[1:17:35] of your souls
[1:17:38] we've returned to the shepherd and
[1:17:40] bishop of our soul so what do we do
[1:17:43] what now
[1:17:43] we do now that we return to jesus
[1:17:47] just say oh
[1:17:49] i'm here
[1:17:51] i'm a christian
[1:17:52] i'm safe now
[1:17:55] ain't good enough
[1:17:58] now
[1:17:59] you follow his example
[1:18:02] it just it's gonna get hard now
[1:18:05] it's nice when the sins are forgiven
[1:18:07] it's nice that we're set free
[1:18:10] it's nice when we're bubbling with joy
[1:18:14] but now it's time to lay down our lives
[1:18:16] for one another
[1:18:19] this is the example this is our calling
[1:18:25] everybody wants
[1:18:27] to show their gift
[1:18:30] of whatever it may feel
[1:18:32] to be
[1:18:34] but the true calling is to be like jesus
[1:18:40] that's why you go to some churches you
[1:18:41] some you know you they just it's all
[1:18:44] about popularity contest
[1:18:48] who wants to be
[1:18:50] the best singer who wants to be the
[1:18:53] the best
[1:18:54] the best the best the best the best
[1:18:57] well we've got more members we've got
[1:18:58] glass windows we've got the funniest
[1:19:01] preachers
[1:19:02] right
[1:19:03] what about
[1:19:04] we have lives that are sold out and lay
[1:19:06] down their lives for one another
[1:19:08] what about that because that's what
[1:19:10] jesus pointed us to that's our example
[1:19:13] why has humanity stepped inside the
[1:19:15] church and want to have church
[1:19:18] mix god
[1:19:20] right with their own flesh
[1:19:27] that when somebody comes and says this
[1:19:29] is the way church should be
[1:19:32] they begin to kick them out
[1:19:35] they keep jesus out
[1:19:37] and they're literally having church
[1:19:39] without any suffering
[1:19:41] it's all about making people feel good
[1:19:43] it's about when you leave you feel
[1:19:45] better than when you came and that's all
[1:19:46] that matters and i'll tell you if that's
[1:19:48] really all that matters to us
[1:19:51] we're missing our calling
[1:19:54] we're not called to that
[1:19:56] amen i can't find that in the scriptures
[1:20:00] leaving us an example that we should
[1:20:02] follow
[1:20:03] his
[1:20:04] steps
[1:20:08] following the example he left for us
[1:20:14] so when we're attacked by someone
[1:20:16] we're suffering
[1:20:18] we don't fight back
[1:20:21] we just love them
[1:20:24] we don't let guile be found in our mouth
[1:20:27] now that word gown means decoy a decoy
[1:20:31] crafty tricky deceitful or subtility
[1:20:36] in other words
[1:20:39] you don't let your conversation be with
[1:20:41] i got something on going on back here
[1:20:43] but i'm not going to tell
[1:20:44] you you understand come on now don't sit
[1:20:48] there and say ah
[1:20:50] it's the word
[1:20:52] hidden agendas i want to do this but i'm
[1:20:54] going to start with this
[1:20:56] don't let that be found in your mouth it
[1:20:58] wasn't in jesus's why should it be in
[1:21:00] ours
[1:21:01] well because i feel that i need to do
[1:21:03] this to get what i want no trust in him
[1:21:06] commit yourself to god
[1:21:08] trust in him trust that that god is so
[1:21:11] strong in your life that he will perform
[1:21:13] it amen
[1:21:19] let your yay be a and your navy name
[1:21:23] don't argue don't lash back don't swear
[1:21:26] don't threaten let your conversation be
[1:21:28] always with grace coupled with fear
[1:21:32] this is the example for us
[1:21:36] learn to commit your situation to god he
[1:21:39] bore your
[1:21:40] sins you're given an opportunity
[1:21:44] to help bear somebody else's
[1:21:47] yeah they're hurting you
[1:21:49] they're being mean to you you got a
[1:21:52] chance to put your arm around we're
[1:21:54] gonna make it i know you don't
[1:21:55] understand just like jesus did for you
[1:22:01] i got to do that brother john i didn't
[1:22:03] see i i don't see that in the scriptures
[1:22:07] we need a greater experience at the
[1:22:08] cross
[1:22:10] amen
[1:22:11] we need to remember what the cross was
[1:22:13] about
[1:22:17] we returned back to the shepherd and
[1:22:18] bishop of our souls to follow his
[1:22:22] example amen not just to say i'm safe
[1:22:25] right right
[1:22:27] i'm glad that you're safe
[1:22:29] now get out there and save somebody
[1:22:32] get out there and and bring christ to
[1:22:34] somebody bring a higher walk to somebody
[1:22:37] a higher life challenge somebody don't
[1:22:40] talk about others
[1:22:45] talk
[1:22:46] help somebody to wash get down on your
[1:22:49] knees and wash somebody's feet in front
[1:22:51] of somebody
[1:22:54] let them see that your calling
[1:22:58] is not just to look good
[1:23:02] it's to be good
[1:23:04] and be good is when you're on your knees
[1:23:07] washing cleaning serving bearing helping
[1:23:10] one another
[1:23:12] it's an example for us
[1:23:16] we can recognize
[1:23:22] when other people
[1:23:25] are washing somebody's feet
[1:23:27] but again people
[1:23:29] recognize you
[1:23:31] washing one of their feet
[1:23:34] jesus
[1:23:36] that intimate time in that upper room
[1:23:40] he brought them to an awareness do you
[1:23:42] know what i've done do you know what
[1:23:44] i've done
[1:23:45] is it mean anything to you
[1:23:49] yeah it means that no way you're not
[1:23:50] going to wash my feet jesus now that's a
[1:23:52] stinky dirty you shouldn't you're too
[1:23:54] you shouldn't do that
[1:23:58] hey if i don't do this to you you don't
[1:24:00] even have a place in the kingdom
[1:24:04] well wait a minute don't stop there wash
[1:24:06] my whole body
[1:24:08] why everything
[1:24:13] is it even in our schedule to go wash
[1:24:16] somebody's feet
[1:24:18] is it part of our thinking is it part of
[1:24:20] our thoughts
[1:24:21] is our life so consumed with ourself
[1:24:24] that others
[1:24:26] outside of our little thing that we're
[1:24:28] looking at
[1:24:32] god has called us more to this more than
[1:24:35] yes
[1:24:38] a hundred by two hundred foot house
[1:24:41] or whatever we live in right
[1:24:48] sometimes we're too busy
[1:24:50] trying to get others to follow us
[1:24:51] instead of
[1:24:53] following the example that christ gave
[1:24:55] us
[1:24:57] this church
[1:24:59] ought to be following the example that
[1:25:01] christ gave us to follow amen
[1:25:04] this church
[1:25:08] ought to be leading others by example
[1:25:12] not by words
[1:25:15] to me
[1:25:16] something's wrong when you got to keep
[1:25:18] pulling people off to the side and
[1:25:19] telling them over and over and over
[1:25:26] come on
[1:25:29] we need to be looking at the example
[1:25:34] because then we'll know what we need to
[1:25:35] do
[1:25:42] the right example make sure check it out
[1:25:43] with the word because we don't want to
[1:25:44] follow a man
[1:25:47] we're all going to fail
[1:25:52] paul
[1:25:53] believed
[1:25:55] in following
[1:25:59] people following him
[1:26:02] only
[1:26:04] if he was following christ
[1:26:08] i'm going to take it from where we were
[1:26:10] now i'm going to get you to where
[1:26:13] we ought to be leading people with our
[1:26:15] example now our words
[1:26:18] we need to be leading one another where
[1:26:19] are we supposed to be leading them
[1:26:20] higher than where they're at so whoever
[1:26:23] you're talking to know where they're at
[1:26:24] have the motive to bring them up higher
[1:26:27] well brother john i don't feel i'm
[1:26:28] called to do that well what are you
[1:26:30] called to do
[1:26:32] what is your calling
[1:26:34] where is it in the scriptures find
[1:26:36] yourself in the scriptures
[1:26:39] amen that's why we went through them
[1:26:40] today
[1:26:42] that wasn't just for certain people
[1:26:44] it was for believers
[1:26:47] paul's said in galatians chapter 1 verse
[1:26:50] 8 but though we
[1:26:51] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:26:54] gospel unto you than what we have
[1:26:56] preached
[1:26:58] unto you let him be
[1:27:00] accursed
[1:27:04] though we
[1:27:08] you know you ever talk to somebody
[1:27:10] they say one thing one time
[1:27:13] a month later they're saying something
[1:27:15] different
[1:27:17] a week later sometimes they're saying
[1:27:19] something different
[1:27:23] and you don't know which one
[1:27:25] is which
[1:27:30] paul wanted to make it real clear what
[1:27:32] was what
[1:27:34] that the gospel that he preached he said
[1:27:37] i certify that the gospel that i
[1:27:40] preached i didn't receive it of man
[1:27:43] i wasn't taught it by man but by the
[1:27:46] holy ghost so you and i today in this
[1:27:49] 21st
[1:27:51] 2021 the end of it we can have
[1:27:53] confidence in the word of god that it is
[1:27:56] god's word it wasn't paul's
[1:27:58] word amen that's why paul could say in
[1:28:02] first corinthians chapter 4 verse 16
[1:28:04] wherefore i beseech you be ye followers
[1:28:07] of me
[1:28:12] because he followed christ
[1:28:15] he got a he had a revelation of
[1:28:17] suffering for the lord
[1:28:19] he presented his body a living sacrifice
[1:28:23] when he was comparing himself with the
[1:28:24] others ministers he didn't talk about
[1:28:26] how many baptized or how good the
[1:28:28] sermons were no he talked about his
[1:28:30] sufferings
[1:28:34] he compared what he had to go through
[1:28:36] for the gospel
[1:28:38] that's what he
[1:28:41] that was his uh
[1:28:42] certificate
[1:28:47] unlike most of us who look at other
[1:28:49] things
[1:28:51] for our credentials
[1:28:53] but if you're really following
[1:28:56] jesus
[1:28:59] you're willing to suffer for others
[1:29:04] and i'm not talking behind a pulpit or
[1:29:06] in front of people
[1:29:08] i'm talking about every single day
[1:29:11] there's a yearning to put you out yonder
[1:29:14] with with people
[1:29:16] wanting to bring jesus to them and you
[1:29:19] know what it takes
[1:29:20] suffering
[1:29:22] sometimes they're to make fun of you
[1:29:24] sometimes going to tell you get out of
[1:29:26] my face
[1:29:27] but it's christ in you a burden that
[1:29:29] believes that there's a soul there and
[1:29:31] if you just go through the trial
[1:29:34] come out loving them
[1:29:36] more than they've ever seen before then
[1:29:38] they're going to know there's something
[1:29:39] special about you
[1:29:41] you're a little different
[1:29:43] you're not one that just talks and walks
[1:29:44] different right
[1:29:46] in fact you hardly talk you just walk
[1:29:50] got my attention praise the lord
[1:29:53] paul said in first corinthians chapter
[1:29:55] 11 verse 1 he said be ye followers
[1:29:59] of me
[1:30:00] even
[1:30:02] as i also am of christ
[1:30:06] it's okay to follow somebody
[1:30:08] as long as they're following christ now
[1:30:10] understand this statement
[1:30:13] we're all following christ to some
[1:30:14] degree
[1:30:16] that does not give me liberty to go
[1:30:18] follow every one of you
[1:30:21] because what about the part of your life
[1:30:23] that isn't following christ
[1:30:26] that's the part that's going to get me
[1:30:28] in trouble
[1:30:30] so
[1:30:31] i follow you
[1:30:33] as you're following christ
[1:30:35] and where you're not following him
[1:30:39] step away
[1:30:40] step away
[1:30:43] of course you wanna hey this is what the
[1:30:45] gospel says
[1:30:46] this is what the prophet said
[1:30:48] this is what the message said
[1:30:52] and the bible says
[1:30:55] that
[1:30:56] if you win them
[1:30:58] it's to the
[1:31:00] benefit you're saving
[1:31:03] them from the sin
[1:31:06] but if they won't
[1:31:09] receive you
[1:31:11] you've got to get away from that spirit
[1:31:13] because that same spirit will get on you
[1:31:16] and you'll be compromising with
[1:31:17] something else yes
[1:31:20] you got to remember god is not calling
[1:31:22] us to be a good church here at
[1:31:24] sunderland
[1:31:27] god is calling sun the light to become
[1:31:29] like him
[1:31:30] it's a much higher calling
[1:31:33] and that's why we've got to get our our
[1:31:35] eyes fixed on jesus
[1:31:38] amen
[1:31:41] we're following paul as he follows
[1:31:43] christ
[1:31:45] he said i count not myself to have
[1:31:48] apprehended think of this i'm following
[1:31:50] paul now
[1:31:51] and he's following christ so he must
[1:31:53] have the same attitude
[1:31:55] that christ has he says i can't not
[1:31:57] myself to have apprehended jesus said i
[1:31:59] only do those things that please the
[1:32:00] father i'm not there
[1:32:03] come on
[1:32:04] he came to do the work of the father
[1:32:08] in other words paul didn't set a bad
[1:32:09] example and so i've already attained who
[1:32:12] are you to tell me i'm older than you i
[1:32:14] know more than you i've been in the
[1:32:15] message more than you
[1:32:17] that's a bad example
[1:32:19] he labored to enter into the rest
[1:32:23] of god's divine nature
[1:32:26] catch that he labored to enter in to the
[1:32:30] rest
[1:32:31] of god's divine nature
[1:32:34] there still remaineth a rest for the
[1:32:36] people of god there is more of god's
[1:32:38] divine nature for us it just needs to
[1:32:40] become our desire
[1:32:44] just needs to become our desire
[1:32:49] he continued to reach forth unto those
[1:32:51] things which were in front of him
[1:32:55] he pressed towards the mark of the prize
[1:32:57] of the high calling christ jesus now
[1:32:58] what he was doing he was following
[1:33:00] christ amen
[1:33:02] and as long
[1:33:04] as
[1:33:05] you're doing that
[1:33:07] you are following christ amen
[1:33:10] and the moment you say
[1:33:13] well i don't got time for all that
[1:33:16] you know i can i can come to i'll make
[1:33:18] i'll come to church you know i got other
[1:33:22] things going
[1:33:25] you understand what i'm saying
[1:33:27] yes
[1:33:28] i know it's a high calling
[1:33:30] but we're either following we're
[1:33:32] following
[1:33:33] his example
[1:33:34] or we're following somebody else is
[1:33:35] thinking we're following the right
[1:33:37] example
[1:33:39] turn with me if you would to philippians
[1:33:41] chapter 3 verse 17
[1:33:44] he's letting the church know what the
[1:33:45] right example is to fall he says
[1:33:46] brethren be followers together of me
[1:33:50] and mark them
[1:33:51] which
[1:33:53] walk so
[1:33:55] be followers of me and take and and mark
[1:33:57] those put up put a mark on somebody that
[1:33:59] walks just like me
[1:34:02] mark them
[1:34:03] you know the jews they got a mark right
[1:34:06] they had a star that was put on them
[1:34:08] it was all part of the plan
[1:34:14] to to capture all the jews and
[1:34:16] annihilate them so they started with a
[1:34:18] mark
[1:34:20] do you know the angel went by and he put
[1:34:22] a mark on those that signed and cried
[1:34:23] for the abominations
[1:34:26] and here paul was saying mark then that
[1:34:28] walk just like me
[1:34:30] that's your example amen
[1:34:36] as you have us for an example
[1:34:40] paul is inviting the elected god to
[1:34:43] follow together now to join together in
[1:34:45] what picking up their cross
[1:34:49] and so of suffering
[1:34:51] that's what he's inviting him to
[1:34:53] because that's what you have to do if
[1:34:55] you're going to keep pressing towards
[1:34:56] the lord
[1:34:57] more lord more lord more of the lord
[1:34:59] you're
[1:35:00] you're picking you up your cross
[1:35:03] that's right
[1:35:05] for many walk with the wrong example now
[1:35:08] of whom i've told you often
[1:35:10] and now i tell you even weeping
[1:35:13] look at the burden that he has for the
[1:35:14] believers here he said they
[1:35:17] that they are the enemies of the cross
[1:35:19] of christ
[1:35:21] in other words they're not willing to
[1:35:22] pick up their cross and be a christian
[1:35:24] they want to be a christian without
[1:35:26] picking up the cross they're literally
[1:35:28] enemies of the cross
[1:35:31] see how we can become an enemy of the
[1:35:33] cross
[1:35:34] because we don't want to suffer
[1:35:40] want to live a soft life
[1:35:43] brother man says we've got to accept our
[1:35:44] responsibility
[1:35:47] he said whose end is just whose end is
[1:35:49] destruction
[1:35:51] whose god is their belly you know what
[1:35:53] you put in your belly
[1:35:57] we all put in our belly every day
[1:35:59] something we want
[1:36:03] we don't go home and say it's time to
[1:36:04] eat i want to eat i want we're going to
[1:36:06] eat everything i hate
[1:36:10] whose god is their belly whose god is
[1:36:12] their desire
[1:36:18] whose glory is their shame who mind
[1:36:20] earthly things
[1:36:24] now we're following paul to christ amen
[1:36:27] second timothy chapter three he tells
[1:36:29] him in verse number 10 but that was
[1:36:31] fully known my doctrine my manner of
[1:36:34] life my purpose my faith my long
[1:36:36] suffering my charity my patience
[1:36:38] you also know my persecutions my
[1:36:40] afflictions
[1:36:41] which came unto me at any like iconium
[1:36:43] lystra what persecutions i endured but
[1:36:46] out of them all the lord delivered me
[1:36:48] look at the example he
[1:36:51] sat
[1:36:55] it's important if we would just come up
[1:36:57] to one another
[1:36:59] and say
[1:37:01] what
[1:37:02] is
[1:37:03] your
[1:37:04] purpose
[1:37:08] i'll never forget
[1:37:10] very young before we
[1:37:12] started
[1:37:13] doing uh missions
[1:37:15] in central america
[1:37:18] i had invited um
[1:37:23] um
[1:37:24] brother melchizedek to our house
[1:37:27] and i just had such a burden to help in
[1:37:30] the mission field down there
[1:37:32] you know i was moving my pulpit earlier
[1:37:35] used to be up there and i was looking at
[1:37:36] it and i never moved it back
[1:37:39] tripping over this cord
[1:37:41] and i said
[1:37:42] brother milk cause we went downstairs
[1:37:44] and i just having some alone time with
[1:37:46] him and i said that i just i wanna
[1:37:50] i wanna help i wanna help
[1:37:53] i don't know what to do i just i just
[1:37:55] wanna help he looked at me and the first
[1:37:57] words that came out of his mouth he said
[1:37:59] what is your purpose
[1:38:02] right
[1:38:05] i like that we can get to the end result
[1:38:07] quicker
[1:38:11] we don't have to go through the phony
[1:38:12] baloney
[1:38:15] because that's all it is it's funny
[1:38:16] baloney
[1:38:18] it's a smoke screen
[1:38:23] we can look at paul's life and see his
[1:38:26] purpose his manner
[1:38:28] what he was aiming for
[1:38:30] what he was trying to get us to do to
[1:38:33] follow him
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:39] first thessalonians chapter one verse
[1:38:41] four and then we need to go quickly
[1:38:43] we're
[1:38:44] we're getting real close here please
[1:38:46] bear with me
[1:38:48] knowing brethren beloved your election
[1:38:50] of god for our gospel came not unto you
[1:38:52] in word only but also in the power
[1:38:55] and of the holy ghost and much assurance
[1:38:58] you know what matter of men we were
[1:39:00] among you
[1:39:01] for your sake
[1:39:03] and you became followers of us
[1:39:05] and of the lord
[1:39:08] having received the word in much
[1:39:09] affliction with joy and of the holy
[1:39:11] ghost and so that ye were in samples
[1:39:15] to all that believed
[1:39:17] in macedonia
[1:39:19] and acai
[1:39:21] so here
[1:39:23] he's talking to the thessalonians
[1:39:26] paul preached to them
[1:39:29] they followed paul as he followed christ
[1:39:32] and he led them to christ
[1:39:35] they received the realness of god not
[1:39:37] just their own
[1:39:38] idea and then they became examples to
[1:39:41] others
[1:39:44] and this is what the gospel is supposed
[1:39:46] to be like amen leading people
[1:39:48] not with their own private
[1:39:50] interpretation
[1:39:52] but something that lines up with the
[1:39:54] bible amen
[1:39:57] now you can't be too young
[1:39:59] to be an example
[1:40:02] first timothy chapter 4 verse 11 these
[1:40:05] things command and teach that's what i'm
[1:40:07] doing today
[1:40:08] i'm teaching
[1:40:09] commanding
[1:40:11] let no man despise thy youth
[1:40:15] but be thou an example of the believers
[1:40:20] in word
[1:40:21] in conversation this is your behavior by
[1:40:24] the way
[1:40:26] in charity
[1:40:28] in your love
[1:40:30] in spirit
[1:40:32] that's right there's one spirit right
[1:40:35] in faith
[1:40:36] and in purity
[1:40:40] be an example
[1:40:43] hebrews chapter 6 verse 11
[1:40:45] and we desire that every one of you to
[1:40:47] show the same diligence to the full
[1:40:49] assurance of hope right to the end that
[1:40:52] should be not slothful but followers of
[1:40:55] them
[1:40:56] who through faith and patience inherit
[1:40:59] the promises
[1:41:01] now i don't know what promise you're
[1:41:04] looking for
[1:41:05] i'll be honest with you
[1:41:07] promises can be very very very very very
[1:41:11] open
[1:41:14] there's one promise
[1:41:16] that we should be concerned about more
[1:41:18] than any other promise
[1:41:21] this is just john martin
[1:41:23] the bible says it does not yet appear
[1:41:25] but
[1:41:26] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:41:28] he shall appear we shall be like him
[1:41:32] i know
[1:41:34] that if i'm there
[1:41:36] i'm going
[1:41:37] if i'm not there
[1:41:39] but i still say i'm going
[1:41:43] i could find myself missing it
[1:41:47] so
[1:41:48] our priority should be becoming more
[1:41:51] like him in the life that we live
[1:41:54] not the words we say
[1:41:56] not the church we go to
[1:41:59] not the money we give
[1:42:01] the life that we're living
[1:42:03] the life of of of laying down
[1:42:07] our lives to help somebody who's not
[1:42:10] doing as good as we are
[1:42:12] when's the last time you called somebody
[1:42:14] that you hated
[1:42:16] to help them right right true well
[1:42:19] brother john i don't know if i've ever
[1:42:20] done that
[1:42:23] well do you know what
[1:42:25] you hated christ right
[1:42:29] he
[1:42:30] laid down his life for you
[1:42:33] and then he got your attention and he
[1:42:34] said to you one day i died for you yep
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:40] now if he's living in you right won't
[1:42:43] you lay down your life for the brethren
[1:42:46] for others
[1:42:47] amen
[1:42:48] last quote i want to read to you about
[1:42:50] the
[1:42:52] um message influence brother i'm talking
[1:42:54] about following the right example he
[1:42:56] says you just put one or two good
[1:42:59] members in a church
[1:43:01] just one or two
[1:43:04] now this is kind of bad
[1:43:05] but if there's only one or two who are
[1:43:07] they
[1:43:08] let's for a moment just so we
[1:43:11] don't
[1:43:13] have any problems here let's for a
[1:43:15] moment just think you are the one
[1:43:19] good member you
[1:43:20] are the good member
[1:43:22] will you do that with me
[1:43:27] that's really on fire for god well
[1:43:30] that's the first thing
[1:43:32] you
[1:43:33] good member need to be on fire for god
[1:43:39] now notice it's not
[1:43:41] a fire
[1:43:42] to make yourself
[1:43:44] something or to preach
[1:43:46] come on
[1:43:48] it's a fire for
[1:43:50] god he said it will do more for that
[1:43:55] church
[1:43:59] notice
[1:44:00] what your fire and you being a good
[1:44:02] member is going to do for this church
[1:44:07] you know we may not like john f kennedy
[1:44:09] but he did say one thing he says don't
[1:44:11] ask what this country
[1:44:13] can do for you
[1:44:16] but what you can do for the country
[1:44:18] it's not about what this church can do
[1:44:20] for you
[1:44:23] about what you can do to make the church
[1:44:25] better
[1:44:27] if you're on fire for god you're a good
[1:44:29] member your focus
[1:44:32] will perform what the prophet said
[1:44:36] it'll do
[1:44:37] something for that church more than 40
[1:44:39] revivalists could ever
[1:44:42] do
[1:44:43] he said right now look he he says a good
[1:44:47] cleansed member
[1:44:49] set an example
[1:44:53] with a face shining with the glory of
[1:44:56] god amen with sweetness
[1:44:59] with humility
[1:45:01] to stand there
[1:45:02] in the power of god now notice how he's
[1:45:05] talking what the power of god is it's
[1:45:07] humility and sweetness
[1:45:12] in other words it don't matter
[1:45:14] how you hit him what you say
[1:45:17] knock him over
[1:45:19] he's still gonna love you anyways yes
[1:45:23] sweet and humble standing there in the
[1:45:26] power of god
[1:45:28] oh never ever forget and i was down the
[1:45:31] stairs at our old church
[1:45:34] brother johnson was our pastor and there
[1:45:35] was a man there in that church
[1:45:37] he was um
[1:45:40] he had great needs
[1:45:42] when i looked at him i said that was the
[1:45:43] closest that he could see of someone
[1:45:45] being possessed with a devil
[1:45:47] he would be in and out of the church and
[1:45:48] he would act so crazy
[1:45:53] now remember every time he came around
[1:45:55] there was just a little
[1:45:57] concern
[1:46:01] i remember one time he came downstairs
[1:46:03] and we were just there and all sudden
[1:46:07] brother johnson started talking to him
[1:46:11] and immediately took control of that
[1:46:13] situation
[1:46:15] and i saw the wisdom of god
[1:46:18] so much manifested in front of me
[1:46:21] don't know i don't think i ever told him
[1:46:24] that i remember just walking away
[1:46:26] just marveling
[1:46:28] and thought
[1:46:29] god if i could just have ten percent of
[1:46:31] the wisdom that man has
[1:46:35] we can't be an example one for
[1:46:38] another and it's not
[1:46:41] from the pulpit
[1:46:43] it's when you hear
[1:46:45] something you're dealing with something
[1:46:47] that isn't just right you know what
[1:46:49] happens
[1:46:50] christ just steps in
[1:46:52] takes care of it you know love covers a
[1:46:54] multitude of sin
[1:46:57] that's all we need is him let's stand
[1:46:59] together god bless you for your patience
[1:47:01] today
[1:47:02] he's our example
[1:47:11] as we're standing i want us to think
[1:47:13] about
[1:47:15] what example have you been following
[1:47:23] it's okay
[1:47:24] whoever it is as long as they're really
[1:47:27] following
[1:47:29] christ in that area that you're
[1:47:30] following
[1:47:32] in one sense i could say it's extremely
[1:47:34] dangerous for us to follow one another
[1:47:38] because we're going to find out
[1:47:39] somewhere
[1:47:41] where we shouldn't be
[1:47:42] sorry
[1:47:45] but it doesn't mean we should become all
[1:47:48] scared
[1:47:49] right about one another
[1:47:52] what it means is that we should learn
[1:47:53] our bible better yes
[1:47:56] that we should learn
[1:47:59] christ more
[1:48:00] in the realness
[1:48:02] and not what one another think about it
[1:48:06] that's right because once you find a
[1:48:07] true revelation of the life that you're
[1:48:09] supposed to be living you won't but
[1:48:12] you can't help but to share it with
[1:48:13] somebody
[1:48:15] because that's what happens it's christ
[1:48:17] in you wanting to share
[1:48:19] the proper life yes
[1:48:21] amen let's
[1:48:23] just go before him in a word of prayer
[1:48:25] with every head bowel i wonder if
[1:48:26] there's someone today that would say
[1:48:28] brother john would you remember me in
[1:48:30] prayer that i could be the example
[1:48:34] that christ wants me to be
[1:48:36] i bless these hands every hand just
[1:48:39] raised practically
[1:48:41] god bless you god sees your desire to
[1:48:44] represent him in this evil age
[1:48:47] what an honor
[1:48:48] what an honor
[1:48:51] let's believe with all of our hearts
[1:48:55] father
[1:48:57] i don't believe that you brought us to
[1:48:59] this
[1:49:00] point of the service
[1:49:04] without
[1:49:07] leading us
[1:49:08] closer to you
[1:49:16] your word declares that you sent your
[1:49:18] word to heal the people and certainly
[1:49:20] lord there's a body that needs to be
[1:49:22] healed but there's also
[1:49:24] a character
[1:49:27] a spirit part of us
[1:49:29] that needs
[1:49:30] to be more like you
[1:49:33] you sent your word today
[1:49:36] to bring
[1:49:37] a healing amending
[1:49:40] to any opened areas to any thing that
[1:49:43] would be broken
[1:49:45] oh god you said a humble and contrite
[1:49:48] spirit
[1:49:49] a broken
[1:49:50] i will not despise
[1:49:53] lord you see the hands that have been
[1:49:54] raised that
[1:49:56] that humble desire inside of each one of
[1:49:58] them to be more like you
[1:50:02] to not fashion themselves
[1:50:04] after the things of the world
[1:50:07] but to be
[1:50:08] a real
[1:50:10] representation
[1:50:16] of god
[1:50:17] in this age bless each one with their
[1:50:19] desire lord
[1:50:21] lord as they
[1:50:25] believe now in their hearts lord that
[1:50:27] what
[1:50:28] their hand was raised for their their
[1:50:31] very hearts desire to be
[1:50:33] christ to one another in the church to
[1:50:36] their family members to their neighbors
[1:50:38] to those they work with
[1:50:40] to those they come in contact with
[1:50:44] that they could see the real love of god
[1:50:50] may they astonish many as they
[1:50:52] bend their spirit
[1:50:56] wash one another's feet
[1:51:01] may many see you inside of them lords my
[1:51:03] prayer
[1:51:06] may they have to step back and say that
[1:51:08] was not a man that was god in a man
[1:51:13] lord they have received your word
[1:51:17] and i pray that you manifest in their
[1:51:18] lives
[1:51:21] let this word never depart for them but
[1:51:23] all that they say think and do
[1:51:26] and remember
[1:51:29] lord there being that example for
[1:51:30] someone to come and follow someday
[1:51:34] lord we commit ourselves to you in our
[1:51:35] church
[1:51:38] lord we know that we're not everything
[1:51:39] that
[1:51:41] we should be
[1:51:42] we know we've failed just so many times
[1:51:44] we don't even feel worthy to even stand
[1:51:46] here lord
[1:51:49] to think lord that you would want a
[1:51:51] little lighthouse to be in this
[1:51:52] community

[1:51:56] faults and failures we've come short of
[1:51:58] your glory so many times
[1:52:01] but oh god
[1:52:03] we know that you've given us
[1:52:05] the privilege today
