[32:36] shallowness with that person because
[32:38] they're unwilling to just go deeper in
[32:41] the conversation and just say things the
[32:44] way they feel and it can cause us to be
[32:48] to feel a little disconnected from that
[32:51] person um you know what I'm talking
[32:53] about all right I think we've all
[32:55] experienced it to too often people
[32:58] aren't really interested in going deeper
[33:02] with God I say too often people aren't
[33:05] really interested in going deeper with
[33:07] God some feel it's it's too much work it
[33:10] takes too much commitment and and
[33:12] they're not uh willing to do that in
[33:15] fact some people actually like being
[33:17] shallow with God there's like less
[33:20] responsibility there and there are
[33:22] others who simply feel they already have
[33:25] a deep relationship with Christ Deep In
[33:29] Christ but so for various reasons people
[33:33] have a hard time wanting to get deeper
[33:36] into the things of God and those who are
[33:38] interested in going deeper into Christ
[33:41] are only willing to go deeper if it's
[33:43] just a matter of
[33:45] learning for some going deeper in Christ
[33:48] is getting more knowledge breaking down
[33:51] the Mysteries or dissecting the Bible or
[33:54] figuring out the last part of the
[33:55] seventh seal the trumpets or the
[33:58] timelines and things like that but going
[34:02] deeper in Christ has very little with
[34:04] gaining
[34:06] knowledge Paul told Timothy the
[34:08] Believers in the end time would be ever
[34:10] learning but never able to come to the
[34:13] knowledge of the truth you can find that
[34:16] in second Timothy chapter 3 but that
[34:18] knowledge of the truth that means coming
[34:20] into full discernment of Jesus Christ
[34:24] fully Discerning Jesus Christ in the end
[34:28] time message Believers Never Come to
[34:31] maturity we see that even in this age
[34:34] they're satisfied with just being in the
[34:36] message but they really never come to a
[34:39] maturity that what this message brought
[34:42] amen it's good it's one thing to say
[34:44] that we know that God sent a prophet and
[34:47] we we got the truth but it's another
[34:49] thing to be to be living what God brings
[34:54] us although God may not want us to know
[34:58] all things and he doesn't how many times
[34:59] we have questions why did God do this
[35:02] it's true that he doesn't want us to
[35:03] know all things but he does want us to
[35:06] come into a deeper relationship with him
[35:10] right Jesus said in John 16:12 I have
[35:14] yet many things to say unto you but you
[35:18] can't bear them now amen so there's a
[35:24] deepness that God wants to have with us
[35:27] but we're not prepared for that
[35:31] deepness so there's an absolute desire
[35:33] in God's heart for all of us to go
[35:36] deeper with him the fact that we're
[35:39] having a a hard time with handling the
[35:42] things that he would say to us shows us
[35:44] that there is a a deeper things that God
[35:46] has for us a lot of times people don't
[35:49] like dealing with difficult things
[35:52] because they simply can't handle
[35:56] it and we could be missing out on the
[35:58] deeper things of God just because we
[36:01] can't handle it you know a lot of people
[36:03] they want to they want to be in a
[36:05] service where they just only thing that
[36:07] they want to feel is feeling
[36:12] good but but our flesh has to die or
[36:15] else we're catering to the
[36:18] flesh too often our flesh gets in the
[36:21] way of the deeper things of God and
[36:23] we're going to see this morning by the
[36:25] grace of God that that God wants us to
[36:27] set our affections upon him and we can
[36:30] see the scripture here in Colossians 3:1
[36:34] if he then be risen with Christ can you
[36:36] say Amen to that are you risen with
[36:38] Christ amen the instructions are to seek
[36:41] those things which are above where
[36:44] Christ sth on the right hand of God set
[36:47] your affection on things above not on
[36:51] the things on the
[36:54] earth for you are dead and your life is
[36:57] hid with Christ in God you ever play
[37:00] hide and and
[37:01] seek and you're just alone and and and
[37:05] and maybe you're with somebody and
[37:06] they're and and they and there
[37:08] somebody's trying to find you and you're
[37:10] hid and you hope you don't you don't get
[37:12] you know they don't find you and when
[37:15] you're in
[37:16] Christ the devil can't get to
[37:20] you that's right but when you're out
[37:22] there you're you're you're Satan is
[37:25] looking for those that are out of the
[37:27] spirit that are in the flesh walking in
[37:30] a carnal
[37:31] way amen seeking whom he may devour but
[37:35] when you're in Christ you can't be
[37:37] devoured
[37:38] amen all right the scripture says when
[37:41] Christ who is our life shall appear then
[37:44] ye shall appear with him in glory so we
[37:47] need to set our affections on things
[37:50] above the thoughts of God we know that
[37:52] the thoughts of of God are higher than
[37:54] our thoughts so we can't just think the
[37:56] normal things that would think during
[37:58] the day and expect that to be the
[38:00] thoughts of God it's not we need to
[38:03] exercise our mind on Christ we need to
[38:05] entertain thoughts of of love and making
[38:08] God happy and how we can do
[38:11] that
[38:13] amen if our human nature gets interested
[38:17] in the deeper things of
[38:19] God uh it will look for the easiest way
[38:25] to do
[38:26] it you understand what I'm saying right
[38:30] I'm
[38:30] saying an intellectual way a way that
[38:34] just requires the mind to do all the
[38:37] work some schooling or learning some
[38:40] books or or some podcast or some
[38:43] teaching or philosophy and this is the
[38:45] way that people feel that they get
[38:48] deeper into God is doing these
[38:50] things brother brandham said that
[38:53] seminaries that are really
[38:55] made to teach
[38:58] people about God are the things that
[39:01] take Believers further away from
[39:04] God Paul said what things were gained
[39:07] under gained to me under
[39:10] Gia these things have I counted loss for
[39:14] Christ he said I suffer the loss of all
[39:18] things and do count them as but D that I
[39:22] might win Christ so we those things that
[39:26] we
[39:27] any other way than by the revelation of
[39:30] Jesus Christ cannot help us with God
[39:34] cannot help us find favor with God
[39:37] there's got to be a dividing line
[39:39] between you trying to do it and humbling
[39:44] yourself to love God and let him come in
[39:46] your heart and and reveal himself to you
[39:50] man's way is not God's
[39:53] way Remember The Men Who desired to make
[39:55] a Tower of Babel
[39:57] they said in Genesis
[40:00] 11:4 go to and let us build us a city
[40:05] and a
[40:07] tower look at the motive here whose top
[40:11] May reach unto heaven and let us make us
[40:15] a name lest we be scattered abroad upon
[40:19] the face of the
[40:23] Earth let us make a name
[40:30] let us reach up to heaven let's let us
[40:32] do
[40:33] it the
[40:35] denominations wanted to make a name for
[40:37] themselves you know Paul wanted to make
[40:40] a name for
[40:44] himself the devil offered Jesus all the
[40:48] kingdoms of the
[40:49] world the devil try to get brother
[40:52] brandom to make a name for
[40:55] himself preachers in this Mage try to
[40:58] make a name for themselves most everyone
[41:01] wants to make a name for themselves but
[41:03] Christ made himself of no
[41:07] reputation so God hides himself in
[41:11] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[41:14] same Simplicity here in in in Matthew
[41:17] chapter 11 we've read these scriptures
[41:19] but just trying to to lay a foundation
[41:22] Jesus said in Matthew 11:25 I thank thee
[41:26] oh father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[41:29] because thou has hid these things what
[41:32] things the deeper things The Reel the re
[41:34] the Deep things of God from the wise and
[41:38] The
[41:39] Prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[41:45] wow so there is an incidence where God
[41:48] can look at a
[41:50] parent and say you know what you just
[41:53] don't get
[41:55] it and look at the the child and teach
[41:58] that child what's right or
[42:01] wrong even so father for so it seem good
[42:06] in thy
[42:07] sight all things are delivered unto me
[42:10] of the father and no man knoweth the son
[42:12] but the father neither knoweth any man
[42:15] the father save the son and he to
[42:18] whomsoever the son will reveal him so
[42:23] what are we looking for for the deeper
[42:24] things of God we're looking for God to
[42:29] reveal I can't do that it can't come
[42:31] from the
[42:32] pulpit it can't come even from our own
[42:36] uh uh works of of opening the Bible and
[42:40] and reading and and and putting on a
[42:43] tape that just don't get the job done
[42:46] unless it's mixed with
[42:49] something are you with
[42:51] me I wonder
[42:54] why God has hid it from the wise and The
[43:01] Prudent just to trying to be keep things
[43:03] simple here is because they're unwilling
[43:05] to repent amen good to see brother
[43:08] Orlando Back God brought him back saved
[43:11] they're unwilling to repent think about
[43:15] that H that's why they're called wise
[43:17] and
[43:18] prudent they wanted to to know the
[43:21] deeper things of God without repenting
[43:23] they they built this Tower they wanted
[43:25] to go up and reach into heaven but you
[43:27] know they weren't willing to just follow
[43:31] the word of
[43:33] God they they wanted to do it their way
[43:35] right there's a way that seeth right to
[43:37] man but the but the end is the way of
[43:39] death so the wise and prudent are men
[43:42] that are smart they're educated they're
[43:45] mentally able to put things together
[43:49] they weigh out their options very
[43:50] carefully before they act upon them they
[43:54] base each decision upon the knowledge
[43:57] that they have for the
[43:58] situation and there are there are many
[44:01] wise and prudent men that don't like
[44:05] repenting because of their own
[44:10] confidence right every man being right
[44:12] in his own eyes but Jesus thanked the
[44:16] father that he hid it from these type of
[44:20] people 1 Corinthians 1:26 for ye see
[44:25] your calling now just take a look at
[44:27] your calling Brethren how that not many
[44:30] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[44:35] not many noble are called to the
[44:39] truth I'm
[44:41] saying that uh all all everybody's
[44:45] called right everybody's got a chance
[44:46] but what I'm saying here is God hasn't
[44:50] elected that type of a
[44:53] man to have that that type of uh
[44:58] uh uh
[45:00] fleshly pride in the kingdom of God it
[45:05] it just can't be um and and what happens
[45:08] when a person gets so full of Pride it's
[45:12] you when you know Pride people people
[45:14] that are full of Pride they have the
[45:16] hardest time with
[45:18] things it's just like it's a part of
[45:20] their
[45:21] character and that thing the character
[45:23] has to be denounced and they view they
[45:26] View their proud character often as they
[45:29] did something proud and that they're
[45:31] sorry that they did something proud but
[45:33] they never deal with the
[45:35] character are are you with me amen and
[45:38] and that's why there's not very many of
[45:40] them called but God has chosen the
[45:44] foolish things of the world to confound
[45:46] the wise and God have chosen the weak
[45:49] things of the world to confound the
[45:50] things that are Mighty and the base
[45:53] things of the world and the things that
[45:56] which are
[45:58] despised despised have God chosen yay
[46:02] the things which are not to bring to na
[46:04] the things that are and what's the
[46:07] reason that God has done this that no
[46:10] flesh should glory in his
[46:13] presence no wise nor prudent is going to
[46:17] glory in his presence so the very fact
[46:20] that you see somebody gloring gloating
[46:23] and gloring you can just guarantee God's
[46:26] Not There
[46:27] God just isn't there God isn't in that
[46:29] type of atmosphere in fact he resists
[46:32] the proud the Bible says he resist that
[46:35] type of spirit 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[46:38] are you with me can you say Amen to the
[46:40] word of God now if I say anything that's
[46:42] not the word of God you are allowed to
[46:44] not say
[46:47] anything 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse
[46:50] one and I Brethren when I came unto you
[46:53] I came not with the Excellency of speech
[46:57] or of
[46:59] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[47:03] of God and another words I I didn't
[47:06] bring anything when I brought the word
[47:08] of God to you for I determined not to
[47:12] know anything among you just just just
[47:16] one thing save Jesus Christ and him
[47:21] crucified for I was with you in weakness
[47:25] and in fear and in much
[47:30] trembling and my speech and my preaching
[47:34] was not with enticing words of man's
[47:38] Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[47:42] spirit and of power you want to know to
[47:45] me what the one of the greatest
[47:47] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost in
[47:49] somebody is that it does not allow the
[47:53] flesh to come out
[47:57] it's in control it's it's it it it it
[48:00] has the body in control we look at uh
[48:04] the power of of of that that God using
[48:07] that vessel to do things outwardly
[48:11] here that's God's
[48:15] choices but it's our choice whether we
[48:17] let the flesh come out and try to get
[48:19] some Glory at the same time things are
[48:21] happening are you with
[48:24] me all right
[48:27] that the reason for this is that your
[48:29] faith should not stand in the wisdom of
[48:31] men but in just the power of God how be
[48:36] it we speak wisdom among them that are
[48:39] perfect God is speaking wisdom Among Us
[48:42] amen among them that are perfect yet not
[48:46] the wisdom of this world nor the princes
[48:48] of this world that come to not now we
[48:51] know what the wisdom of this world is
[48:53] right it's not vain Glory the Bible
[48:56] teaches is it's not bitter Envy or
[48:58] Strife it's not using these five senses
[49:02] or these 16 uh
[49:04] elements uh or enticing words or
[49:08] confusion and the reason is that that
[49:11] God that doesn't want your faith to
[49:15] stand in the wisdom of men and to try to
[49:17] have to figure things out in the midst
[49:20] of all that
[49:21] confusion God is he's the same yesterday
[49:25] today and forever ever and if we can
[49:28] just learn his nature and then duplicate
[49:31] that in our life seek that in our life
[49:33] set our affections on becoming a
[49:36] Christian that I is bearing the life of
[49:39] Jesus
[49:40] Christ but we speak the wisdom of God in
[49:46] a
[49:48] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[49:51] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[49:57] Jesus uh
[50:01] uh Jesus his life Express the wisdom of
[50:05] God how he handled things we' seen the
[50:08] wisdom of God displayed in everything he
[50:11] did even at Calvary and and look James
[50:15] describes it as first pure Peaceable
[50:19] gentle easy to be in treated full of
[50:22] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[50:26] and without without
[50:31] hypocrisy Paul said which none of the
[50:34] princes of this world knew for if they
[50:35] had known it they would have crucified
[50:38] the Lord Of Glory so we think about how
[50:41] did Jesus
[50:45] handle uh
[50:47] Calvary so here we got Judas coming in
[50:51] and betraying him with a
[50:53] kiss and he never said you get you get
[50:56] away from me you
[50:58] devil why do you portray me with a
[51:03] kiss what and got the the soldiers they
[51:06] came back and and and and and they they
[51:09] went to take Jesus what's going on I was
[51:11] with you all the time why are you taking
[51:12] me
[51:14] now and the disciples wanted to start
[51:17] fighting for the rights cut off the cut
[51:21] off a servant's ear what' Jesus do
[51:23] without respect to persons reach down
[51:26] pick up the air puts it on them you're
[51:29] seeing the wisdom of God was in
[51:31] demonstration in the
[51:34] battle he just he was led to Calvary
[51:37] like a
[51:39] lamb wasn't forced he went willingly
[51:43] nobody takes his life he laid down his
[51:45] life he trusted in the father this is
[51:48] the true wisdom of
[51:53] God but the Bible says that even
[51:57] the devil did know what was going on or
[52:03] else he would have never crucified
[52:07] him think about the devil who was made
[52:11] way
[52:11] before before we came into
[52:16] manifestation and God hid it from him
[52:19] God knew about it before the foundation
[52:21] of the world right it was in heaven but
[52:23] he hid it from him
[52:26] God kept The Greatest Secret Calvary
[52:31] from the
[52:32] devil but think about it he's revealed
[52:34] it to you he's revealed Calvary to you
[52:39] but he kept it from the
[52:43] devil why because Satan wouldn't repent
[52:47] he's wise and
[52:49] prudent but you
[52:52] repented and that's why he's revealed it
[52:54] to you we're blessed we're blessed God
[52:58] hid it from Satan but he's revealed it
[52:59] to us we are a special people we are the
[53:02] chosen of the lord we are the apple of
[53:04] his eye we are his bride we are the
[53:07] redeemed we are Spirit of his Spirit
[53:11] First Peter chapter 2:9 says but ye are
[53:13] a chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[53:17] holy nation A peculiar people that you
[53:19] should show forth the Praises of him
[53:22] that called you out Darkness Into His
[53:24] Marvelous Light think about of all the
[53:27] people in your
[53:30] family that are walking in the
[53:34] truth he knew you would
[53:37] repent he knew
[53:40] it which in times past you were not a
[53:43] people but are now the people of God
[53:47] which had not obtained Mercy but today
[53:51] now have we obtained the mercies of
[53:55] God there's No Mercy For The
[53:58] Devil it's just a matter of time but
[54:02] there's no mercy for the
[54:07] devil now if the devil would have known
[54:10] that crucifying Christ would have
[54:12] unlocked the door uh to our Salvation he
[54:15] would have never ever crucified him he
[54:19] would have never Anointed The
[54:21] unbelievers with those spirits of doubt
[54:24] and and fears and and saying crucify him
[54:28] crucify him away with him give us
[54:30] Barabas because that was all the
[54:33] anointing of the devil on those people
[54:35] amen none of the princes of this world
[54:37] knew for if they had known it they would
[54:39] have not have crucified the Lord Of
[54:45] Glory now God used that same being who
[54:48] caused all of us to sin caus the whole
[54:51] world to sin to actually just be a tool
[54:54] in God's great plan of Redemption it'll
[54:57] ought to make us so happy that God's got
[55:00] everything under control in our lives
[55:02] that we don't have to worry about
[55:04] anything God is still in control he can
[55:07] make it work out for the good he's able
[55:09] to take all the what we think is evil
[55:12] and use it just for you praise God you
[55:15] can't outsmart
[55:17] God you can't even hide things from
[55:20] God you can trick the people but you
[55:23] can't trick God God knows the very
[55:26] motives of our
[55:28] heart he doesn't only know what we're
[55:31] intending to do but he actually knows
[55:33] what Satan's attending to
[55:36] do I tell you we just we we're secure in
[55:40] Christ amen we're secure in Christ now
[55:44] if you want to go deeper into Christ we
[55:46] need to Humble ourselves and call on the
[55:49] name of the Lord the Bible says you draw
[55:52] nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you but
[55:55] how do we actually draw nigh to
[55:58] God can I just go to church read my
[56:01] Bible listen to the tapes maybe stream
[56:04] some
[56:05] Services I say no no no an unbeliever
[56:11] can do
[56:12] that an unbeliever can do that can do
[56:16] all those
[56:18] things we've got to Humble ourselves
[56:20] under the mighty hand of God and
[56:22] actually obey what we're reading what
[56:25] we're listening to
[56:26] what he speaks to us in prayer that's
[56:29] what brother Brandon meant said if you
[56:30] want to be more spiritual read your
[56:32] Bible and pray it meant your heart has
[56:35] to be into following what's going on
[56:38] Amen you know we we we live sometimes
[56:41] double lives double standards and we try
[56:45] to just you know do our part as a
[56:46] Christian then we go and we live in the
[56:48] world and that's not what God has called
[56:50] The Bride to be the he's called The
[56:52] Bride to be one with the
[56:53] bridegroom amen nothing short of that
[56:56] that's going to happen but this is how
[56:58] we get into the deeper things of God 2
[57:01] Corinthians 7:14 we've quoted this
[57:04] before but this is such a beautiful
[57:07] scripture and helps put me in in my
[57:09] place that no matter where I think I'm
[57:11] at with God that I know what God wants
[57:14] me to do if my people which are called
[57:15] by my name shall
[57:18] humble
[57:21] themselves not try to get somebody else
[57:23] humble but humble themselves and pray
[57:28] and seek my face and turn from their
[57:31] Wicked Ways then then will I hear from
[57:36] heaven and will forgive their sin and
[57:39] will heal their land see you just can't
[57:42] just do some wishy-washy Lord forgive me
[57:44] of my sins get up and go do what you
[57:45] want to
[57:46] do that is a different
[57:49] message now look at verse 15 now my eyes
[57:53] shall be open my ears attend unto the
[57:57] prayer that is made in what this
[58:01] place in other words if we get our heart
[58:04] right in this
[58:07] place then God is going to pay
[58:11] attention for now I have chosen and
[58:15] Sanctified this house that my name may
[58:18] be there forever and my eyes and my
[58:22] heart shall be there
[58:24] perpetually for ever permanently people
[58:29] come and go but God remains the same
[58:32] yesterday today and
[58:35] forever you can just feel sometimes the
[58:38] presence of God when you come in here
[58:40] nobody else is
[58:43] here too many people are trying to to
[58:46] make a Rapture their own way their own
[58:49] personal
[58:51] way some are Blinded By The Pride that's
[58:54] in them the thing that's is resisting
[58:58] God from helping them they're hanging on
[59:01] to some don't care about how carnal they
[59:06] act like well I'm just being myself well
[59:09] you can just be yourself but God is not
[59:11] coming for
[59:13] yourself God is coming for a bride
[59:15] without spot or without wrinkle he's
[59:19] coming the Bible says that we'll be just
[59:21] like him he's coming for himself Amen
[59:25] manifested in the
[59:27] flesh Paul said uh uh I Brethren could
[59:32] not come unto you as unto
[59:35] spiritual but when I came unto
[59:38] you as un to carnal children in Christ
[59:44] now you know the scripture it's in
[59:47] Corinthians I believe you just want to
[59:50] write that
[59:51] down that's going to be chapter 3 you
[59:54] want to write that down 1 Corinthians
[59:55] chapter three I have fed you with milk
[59:59] and not with
[1:00:02] meat hither to you were not able again
[1:00:06] to Bear it just like Jesus said neither
[1:00:09] yet are you are ye able now are you able
[1:00:14] so Jesus wanted to say many things but
[1:00:17] he couldn't say it Paul wanted to say uh
[1:00:20] many things to the to the Believers but
[1:00:22] they couldn't bear it because they were
[1:00:23] carnal
[1:00:26] they didn't want to go deeper into
[1:00:29] Christ in other words they were
[1:00:31] unwilling to
[1:00:33] repent unwilling to fear God more than
[1:00:36] they were doing unwilling to keep more
[1:00:38] of The
[1:00:40] Commandments and the Bible tells us
[1:00:42] that's the whole duty of man to fear God
[1:00:45] and to keep his
[1:00:46] Commandments Paul said for ye are yet
[1:00:49] carnal whereas there is among you
[1:00:53] envy strife
[1:00:59] divisions I'll just say like
[1:01:03] gossip are you not
[1:01:06] carnal and walk as men this is a church
[1:01:09] for
[1:01:13] believers while one saith I'm a Paul and
[1:01:16] another says I'm of
[1:01:18] Apollos are you not
[1:01:20] carnal I follow brother so and so in the
[1:01:24] message I live dream this and are you
[1:01:27] not carnal cannot God speak to you where
[1:01:32] you're
[1:01:35] at see we're trying to make the Rapture
[1:01:38] our way and we're missing the way that
[1:01:41] God has provided for
[1:01:44] us God has greater things for the
[1:01:49] bride he has deeper
[1:01:51] things for those who humble themselves
[1:01:54] let's take a a closer look at what we
[1:01:57] need to do to get into the deeper things
[1:01:59] of God we've got to get to the top of
[1:02:01] the pyramid the statue of a perfect man
[1:02:04] that that that Capstone is love and we
[1:02:06] got to get there are you with me all
[1:02:09] right let's just continue on now but I
[1:02:13] want to just read but we speak the
[1:02:16] wisdom of God in the mystery even the
[1:02:17] hidden wisdom which God have before uh
[1:02:21] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[1:02:23] which none of the princes of the new new
[1:02:27] of this world knew for they had known it
[1:02:29] they would have not crucified the Lord
[1:02:32] Of Glory so God's wisdom doesn't only
[1:02:36] hide things from the devil or the Devils
[1:02:41] he hides things from the devilish
[1:02:44] Natures inside of
[1:02:47] humans he certainly does we can say
[1:02:50] we're a child of God all day long but
[1:02:52] you act like a devil that ain't going to
[1:02:54] bring God's presence
[1:02:57] you're not going to have faith to bring
[1:03:00] God to cross his word to help
[1:03:03] you you come God's way or you're not
[1:03:05] coming at all it's all there is to it he
[1:03:08] gives more grace to the humble verse n
[1:03:11] but as it is written Eye Has Not Seen
[1:03:14] Nor Ear heard neither is it entered into
[1:03:16] the heart of man the things which God
[1:03:20] has prepared for them that love him
[1:03:28] so we cannot know
[1:03:31] about the things that God has Force by
[1:03:35] the five senses of
[1:03:38] man we
[1:03:40] cannot know them by worldly wisdom or
[1:03:45] intellect we cannot know the deeper
[1:03:48] things of God through our
[1:03:51] head God has kept them from man
[1:03:57] but verse 10 says but God has what
[1:04:00] revealed them unto us by the holy
[1:04:06] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:04:11] things yes even the Deep things of
[1:04:19] God and who does God reveal them to to
[1:04:23] them that love him
[1:04:26] we just can't go to God's
[1:04:28] library and search for them we search
[1:04:32] for them through our love for
[1:04:35] God and I don't want us to miss this is
[1:04:38] such an important thing is to those who
[1:04:42] exercise on a regular basis their
[1:04:45] relationship with God that it means more
[1:04:48] to them than anything else that's going
[1:04:51] on in the on the planet in the home at
[1:04:55] work work at
[1:04:57] church just my relationship with God is
[1:05:01] the most important thing
[1:05:05] amen they are the ones who God reveals y
[1:05:09] the Deep things of God to the things
[1:05:11] that are in
[1:05:12] heaven I want to give you a little
[1:05:14] secret here
[1:05:17] Revelation really equals an
[1:05:23] experience Revelation equals
[1:05:26] in
[1:05:28] experience we know
[1:05:30] Revelation is Faith it's when God speaks
[1:05:35] but understand this when God speaks to
[1:05:38] us personal we now know God in a
[1:05:41] spiritual realm the Bible says we don't
[1:05:44] know God after the flesh anymore but
[1:05:46] after the
[1:05:47] spirit so what a revelation does for you
[1:05:50] is it gives you an
[1:05:53] experience so when Heaven comes
[1:05:56] down reveals itself to you that means it
[1:06:00] will manifest in our lives that's why
[1:06:04] brother Brandon could say eternal life
[1:06:08] is living for others because that's what
[1:06:10] happens in
[1:06:12] heaven that is the nature the core
[1:06:16] nature in heaven you don't see some of
[1:06:18] the people who have gone on and made it
[1:06:20] you don't see the angels in heaven all
[1:06:22] wanting to do their own things have
[1:06:24] their own parties
[1:06:26] it isn't like that there's one will it's
[1:06:29] the will of God and they live for one
[1:06:31] another
[1:06:36] am it's the nature of
[1:06:39] God you can you cannot separated
[1:06:44] it it's not an option for the bride of
[1:06:47] Christ to live for one
[1:06:50] another but it is an option for the
[1:06:52] foolish
[1:06:53] virgin they can take it or leave it and
[1:06:57] they will leave it but the
[1:07:02] bride how can they deny the light that's
[1:07:04] inside of them and it's not something
[1:07:07] that you even got to put on it's not no
[1:07:09] peacock feathers it's not no well I got
[1:07:12] to make this little effort I guess to be
[1:07:14] no it's just in you it's bubbling out of
[1:07:17] you you just you care about others it's
[1:07:20] not about
[1:07:21] yourself because God you you the only
[1:07:24] ones that got the true revelation ation
[1:07:26] that God bought
[1:07:28] you that God went to Calvary just for
[1:07:31] you that you are not your own anymore
[1:07:35] you've been bought with a price so I say
[1:07:39] brothers and sisters get so much of the
[1:07:40] Holy Ghost that you want to live for
[1:07:43] others without respect a
[1:07:46] persons get rid of your favorite
[1:07:49] friends get some of your
[1:07:51] enemies hug some of your enemies Amen
[1:07:54] brother B said get to the place where
[1:07:56] you can love every person the same way
[1:08:00] then you know you got a part of Heaven
[1:08:02] living inside
[1:08:04] you God has revealed to
[1:08:06] you what he has prepared for you in
[1:08:09] heaven then you already have a piece of
[1:08:12] it right now here on Earth that's what
[1:08:15] I'm trying to
[1:08:17] say it's not like well I got to wait
[1:08:19] till I get to the other side to find out
[1:08:21] what's in heaven No Heaven is inside of
[1:08:23] you that's why you're living the way
[1:08:26] you're
[1:08:28] living it's so precious verse 10 but God
[1:08:32] has revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:08:35] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[1:08:37] the Deep things of God today if there's
[1:08:40] a deep
[1:08:43] calling inside of us for more of God
[1:08:48] there has to be more of God out there
[1:08:51] for us to
[1:08:54] receive and and to not have that calling
[1:08:56] for more of God is a scary thing I say
[1:08:59] we need to get back to the altar you
[1:09:01] know we did so much better when we spent
[1:09:03] time at the altar you know what I mean
[1:09:05] we did we said we did so much better
[1:09:08] spiritually with God I mean I know it
[1:09:11] hurts the pride it hurts our you know
[1:09:14] how Macho we
[1:09:16] look but who cares how Macho we
[1:09:19] are I mean God chosen the things that
[1:09:23] look foolish to men that's who he chose
[1:09:26] to to confound the
[1:09:29] wise
[1:09:30] so the the spirit of God searches the
[1:09:34] Deep things of God and reveals them to
[1:09:37] us I say it like this it's through the
[1:09:40] process of a love
[1:09:43] relationship God has always been
[1:09:45] interested in the heart of man it's
[1:09:47] where he chose to communicate with man
[1:09:49] that's where he chose to uh uh reside
[1:09:53] inside of man it it's inside the heart
[1:09:56] but most people want to get deeper with
[1:09:59] God they use their
[1:10:01] brain they study they read they they
[1:10:04] they use this as the avenue to say that
[1:10:08] they're closer to God because they know
[1:10:10] more let me ask you something be I want
[1:10:12] to be I want you to be real with me look
[1:10:16] at all the things that you know that you
[1:10:18] don't
[1:10:21] live like the devil knows those things
[1:10:27] we can call him a
[1:10:30] Believer it's not
[1:10:32] knowing it's getting this flesh
[1:10:34] crucified that it could live the
[1:10:40] word God is omniscient he knows all
[1:10:43] things he knows what's in the heart of
[1:10:45] man the Bible tells us in Hebrews
[1:10:47] chapter 4 that the word of God is a
[1:10:50] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:10:52] the hearts we come to church we hear the
[1:10:54] word preached not think if our hearts
[1:10:56] are right we're going to hear from
[1:10:58] God but if our hearts are not right
[1:11:01] we're not going to hear from God and I
[1:11:02] don't care how the word is
[1:11:08] preached I remember sitting in a church
[1:11:10] you could hardly say that there was much
[1:11:13] in it but there was something so
[1:11:16] personal there between me and God just
[1:11:18] one word can change your life and if God
[1:11:22] can use a donkey he can use anybody
[1:11:24] right brother Ron if he can use a donkey
[1:11:27] he can use anyone to speak the God's
[1:11:30] word so if there's a calling deep inside
[1:11:32] of the heart for the deeper things of
[1:11:34] God it's through love that they will be
[1:11:37] made
[1:11:39] known it's through our love it's by
[1:11:42] exercising our love towards God that he
[1:11:45] will reveal more of his
[1:11:47] stuff and if we don't express that
[1:11:51] love if we don't if it's just God I'm
[1:11:54] genuine I'm just just so serious about
[1:11:56] this I am sick of trying to make it to
[1:11:59] heaven on my own Tower of Babel my own
[1:12:02] personal way I want to just I want to
[1:12:05] tear right down to the
[1:12:07] foundation right down to the B I want to
[1:12:09] start at the where you want me to be and
[1:12:12] I just want to have a love relationship
[1:12:14] I want to be
[1:12:15] genuine I don't care about what anybody
[1:12:18] else thinks I care about what you think
[1:12:20] God and this is the way it needs to be
[1:12:23] we need to Humble ourselves we need to
[1:12:25] our affections on the Lord and the Holy
[1:12:28] Spirit Will Reveal to us the Deep things
[1:12:31] of God but it's built on a love
[1:12:34] relationship now when he reveals it I'll
[1:12:36] just say it like this you will become it
[1:12:39] amen you become it you become what he
[1:12:43] reveals to you that's why if if you
[1:12:46] think you got something for from God but
[1:12:49] it is not manifested in your life all
[1:12:51] you got is the knowledge of
[1:12:54] it I don't mean to disappoint you you
[1:12:57] just keep going there until you get the
[1:13:00] Revelation now it's true that without
[1:13:03] faith we can't please
[1:13:06] God but the Bible tells us that we could
[1:13:08] have all Faith so that we could remove
[1:13:10] mountains and still be nothing without
[1:13:14] love so we need faith that worketh by
[1:13:19] love in other words if our motive and
[1:13:21] our desire is to please God then that
[1:13:25] that's the faith that we want to
[1:13:28] get but to go ahead and have faith just
[1:13:30] to work miracles and and do all that
[1:13:33] stuff and not have a love relationship
[1:13:35] with God that's willing to die out to
[1:13:37] help your brother or sister brother or
[1:13:39] sister you got the wrong
[1:13:42] thing we've got to love God so much with
[1:13:46] his love that we're willing to do his
[1:13:49] will First Corinthian 1 Corinthians 13
[1:13:52] explains that we could understand eat
[1:13:55] every mystery have all knowledge and
[1:13:58] still be nothing without the love of
[1:14:03] God Galatians 5:6 tells us for in Jesus
[1:14:07] Christ neither circumcision availeth
[1:14:10] anything it doesn't profit anything or
[1:14:14] uncircumcision so I don't care what side
[1:14:16] of fence you want to be on but Faith
[1:14:19] which worketh by love if the reason that
[1:14:23] you're doing is because you love God God
[1:14:27] God's going to bless you you know I used
[1:14:29] to get persecuted a lot for the things
[1:14:32] that I did for the Lord oh I got called
[1:14:35] just about everything the motives for
[1:14:37] everything but I knew that the motive in
[1:14:39] my heart for doing is because I loved
[1:14:41] him and if it truly is your reason
[1:14:45] nothing will stop it from you doing
[1:14:48] it but if it was really the flesh you'll
[1:14:51] just get all offended and bothered and
[1:14:53] you'll stop doing it
[1:14:56] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:14:58] verse 11 now for what things knoweth the
[1:15:01] things of a man save the spirit of man
[1:15:03] which is in him that's true how many
[1:15:05] times have you you watched uh I I mean
[1:15:08] this week I watched a a couple Turtles I
[1:15:12] I'm always trying to save the turtles
[1:15:13] crossing the road and I don't know I I I
[1:15:17] I seen Turtles they want to lay their
[1:15:20] eggs in the road I just don't get
[1:15:23] it and and so
[1:15:25] no no no uh no spe no Turtle knows the
[1:15:31] things of a turtle save the spirit of a
[1:15:34] turtle and no no man knows the things of
[1:15:37] a man say the spirit that's in man why
[1:15:40] is that so
[1:15:42] important because the Bible says even so
[1:15:46] the the things of God knoweth no man but
[1:15:50] the spirit of God that's we're depending
[1:15:53] on God to reveal himself to us we can't
[1:15:57] just try to figure it out on our own and
[1:15:59] think we're
[1:16:00] something they've got to be revealed
[1:16:03] it's only way we can know
[1:16:04] them now we have not received now we
[1:16:08] have received not the spirit of the
[1:16:09] world but the spirit which is of god
[1:16:12] that we might know the things that are
[1:16:14] freely given to us of God which things
[1:16:18] also we speak not in The Words which
[1:16:21] man's Wisdom teaches but that which the
[1:16:23] Holy Ghost teaches
[1:16:25] comparing spiritual things with
[1:16:29] spiritual so we don't need to come to
[1:16:31] church and use a bunch of carnal things
[1:16:34] to learn about the spirit of
[1:16:36] God it just doesn't
[1:16:39] work no spiritual things with spiritual
[1:16:43] but the natural man receiveth not the
[1:16:46] things of the spirit of God the natural
[1:16:50] man for they are foolishness unto him
[1:16:53] neither can he know them because they
[1:16:55] are spiritually deserved how many times
[1:16:57] you be honest how many times you come to
[1:16:59] church and just think oh
[1:17:01] man I didn't get nothing out of
[1:17:07] that all as were really saying with that
[1:17:10] statement or those thoughts is that the
[1:17:13] natural man went to
[1:17:15] church yes yes we that's why we brother
[1:17:20] brand talks so much about preparation
[1:17:22] get into those prayer rooms
[1:17:25] and and die out die out to the Natural
[1:17:28] carnal carnality of what you want to see
[1:17:31] God do and get into the spiritual realm
[1:17:34] where you say Lord not my will thy will
[1:17:36] be done I'm coming with fear and
[1:17:37] trembling and whatever you ask me to do
[1:17:39] that I will do because I am your
[1:17:41] spiritual son I am not your natural son
[1:17:44] I am your spiritual
[1:17:46] son it's got to be that
[1:17:49] real if we want the deeper things of God
[1:17:51] we must get out of our flesh get out of
[1:17:53] our wisdom get out of the natural
[1:17:57] man our heavenly father has hid the Deep
[1:18:00] things from the wise and The Prudent and
[1:18:04] he's reserved a revelation to the humble
[1:18:07] to the
[1:18:08] hungry to those that come
[1:18:11] seeking more of him for so it seemed
[1:18:14] good in thy sight now we all love God is
[1:18:18] that true amen amen we all do but we
[1:18:21] need to start exercising more of that
[1:18:24] love can you say Amen to that yeah we
[1:18:27] have a spirit that works on us
[1:18:28] constantly we don't ask Leo deia to be
[1:18:31] here we don't ask this lukewarm to come
[1:18:34] and invade our homes our minds our work
[1:18:37] and just kind of bring us down to
[1:18:41] humanity we're supposed to becoming more
[1:18:43] like Jesus every day so if that spirit
[1:18:46] is attacking us that means we need to
[1:18:49] start exercising more of the love of God
[1:18:51] to fight
[1:18:52] it now God doesn't want some formal
[1:18:55] relationship with
[1:18:57] him I'll say this I want you to listen
[1:19:00] carefully don't misunderstand me neither
[1:19:03] does God want us want to be known only
[1:19:07] as a blesser a provider a supporter a
[1:19:12] helper A
[1:19:13] Healer now these are great attributes of
[1:19:18] God but he wants his
[1:19:22] wife to act the same way he
[1:19:29] acts and I believe the bride is
[1:19:31] interested in pleasing her
[1:19:34] husband now in the world there's a
[1:19:36] spirit out there where the wife does not
[1:19:41] want to please her
[1:19:45] husband brother bandham said it's it's
[1:19:47] it's a right's
[1:19:49] age and in fact he went on to say it's a
[1:19:51] woman's rights age
[1:19:54] and uh before you know it the women are
[1:19:56] going to be running everything they're
[1:19:58] already showing how much more willing
[1:20:01] they are work to get they're much more
[1:20:03] willing to work to get on top to get
[1:20:08] ahead
[1:20:12] but a woman is out of her place when
[1:20:15] she's like
[1:20:18] that and God wants his
[1:20:22] church to be having a desire a hunger to
[1:20:27] want to be more like
[1:20:29] Jesus nothing short of that is going to
[1:20:32] make God
[1:20:35] happy you can go around like brother
[1:20:38] Bram told that story in the choosing of
[1:20:39] a bride oh God's going to choose me that
[1:20:42] cowboy is going to choose me oh look at
[1:20:45] me the way I'm dressed I can do so much
[1:20:47] I'm
[1:20:49] talented but there was that little woman
[1:20:51] in the back room when nobody was there
[1:20:55] she was putting in all the labor that
[1:20:57] just being faithful at her poster Duty
[1:21:00] coming to church when she needed to come
[1:21:01] to helping when she needed to help
[1:21:03] washing somebody's feet making a making
[1:21:07] a way to to to be a blessing that was
[1:21:10] the character that that cowboy was
[1:21:12] looking
[1:21:14] for God is looking for
[1:21:17] character not abilities he knows you got
[1:21:21] the abilities because he gave them to
[1:21:23] you he's the one that just threw him out
[1:21:26] there severally as he will the Bible
[1:21:28] says but God is looking no matter what
[1:21:31] ability you have that you bring your
[1:21:34] character in alignment with the word of
[1:21:36] God am and then you know you're just
[1:21:40] like Jesus
[1:21:42] amen now God proved his love at Calvary
[1:21:46] and he proves that commitment to his
[1:21:50] love every day he gives you new Mercies
[1:21:54] proving his love to you every day it
[1:21:57] started at Calvary but then he proves it
[1:22:00] every day now God wants us to prove our
[1:22:04] love to him now we proved it at the
[1:22:06] beginning when we repented we got
[1:22:08] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:10] Christ for the remission of our sins we
[1:22:13] made a commitment that we're going to
[1:22:14] serve God the rest of our
[1:22:17] life but you know what I think a lot of
[1:22:20] us fall
[1:22:22] short improving our commitment to love
[1:22:26] to love God every day
[1:22:28] amen to walking in his will and keeping
[1:22:31] his Commandments every day now God is
[1:22:34] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[1:22:36] sins if we confess but are we faithful
[1:22:38] and are we faithful that same
[1:22:40] faithfulness back to
[1:22:43] God this is a I'll say one of the most
[1:22:46] important things that help me understand
[1:22:49] who God really is is John 14:1 15 and I
[1:22:53] want you to read this with me St John
[1:22:56] 14:1 15 Jesus said if if you love me
[1:23:01] keep my
[1:23:03] Commandments if in other words you may
[1:23:08] not you may not now we do know we all so
[1:23:12] many people love God brother BR even
[1:23:13] makes this statement we could love God
[1:23:15] and still miss it so we can love God
[1:23:17] with the natural part of us that wants
[1:23:19] to just keep getting blessed by God and
[1:23:21] God provide and meet my needs and help
[1:23:24] me with what what this thing that I'm
[1:23:26] bringing before you in prayer and and
[1:23:29] but but we want to love God to the point
[1:23:33] that we're willing to get serious about
[1:23:36] this
[1:23:38] word what are the things that God wants
[1:23:41] me to do so we need to start exercising
[1:23:45] This
[1:23:46] Love This Love right here that keeps his
[1:23:49] Commandments we need to to look for the
[1:23:53] Commandments that we've been been
[1:23:56] ignoring we've been setting
[1:23:59] aside we need to repent from ignoring we
[1:24:03] need to repent for disregarding them we
[1:24:06] need to to say Lord I'm sorry I will I
[1:24:09] will reverence your word more I will
[1:24:11] reverence your Commandments more amen
[1:24:14] and I'll say this will touch the heart
[1:24:15] of
[1:24:17] God in fact Jesus said be zalas and
[1:24:20] repent he'll come into our heart but he
[1:24:24] knocks at the door and he's always
[1:24:26] always faithful to tell us what we need
[1:24:28] to do because if we don't do what he
[1:24:30] tells us to do how can he be pleased
[1:24:33] with us amen all right we got to hurry
[1:24:36] up now time is catching away and uh u i
[1:24:40] just just need you to say you know amen
[1:24:43] let a little bit more so we can get this
[1:24:45] train going down the track you are the
[1:24:46] few you know how fast the train goes
[1:24:49] down right you get real quiet then I
[1:24:51] feel I got to go over that a little bit
[1:24:53] more John 14:21 he that ha my
[1:24:57] Commandments and keepeth him keepeth
[1:25:00] them it is he that that truly loves me
[1:25:05] and he that loveth
[1:25:07] me shall be loved of my father and I
[1:25:09] will love him and will manifest
[1:25:15] myself to
[1:25:17] him that is so Supernatural to me that's
[1:25:22] so Supernatural
[1:25:24] now we think we most people serve a God
[1:25:27] that they they just look at God that God
[1:25:30] loves everybody and no matter what he
[1:25:32] loves you and that's the Revelation they
[1:25:35] got of God and I'm not taking that away
[1:25:38] but there is something
[1:25:41] special that he gives to those that love
[1:25:44] him
[1:25:45] back he gives them a greater a greater
[1:25:50] outpouring of himself and what what
[1:25:52] Greater Love Can we have of God than to
[1:25:54] to come and manifest himself right
[1:25:56] inside of us he's going to show us the
[1:25:59] deeper things of Heaven Judas saith unto
[1:26:01] him not as scary Lord how is it that
[1:26:04] thou will manifest yourself unto us but
[1:26:09] not unto the
[1:26:11] world a lot of people don't understand
[1:26:13] how this love relationship is supposed
[1:26:15] to work and that's what Judas was really
[1:26:18] asking how are you going to do that and
[1:26:20] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[1:26:23] man loves me again he will keep my
[1:26:28] words that's the that's that's the
[1:26:30] foundation right there of a of a of a
[1:26:32] relationship with God if you love God
[1:26:36] you now he's talking about your part we
[1:26:37] already know his part he went to Calvary
[1:26:39] He he'll he'll forgive you if you just
[1:26:41] ask him to forgive you he loves you
[1:26:43] he'll pour out his blessings on the just
[1:26:45] and the unjust but he says if you love
[1:26:48] me if a man loves me he will keep my
[1:26:51] words and my father will love him and we
[1:26:53] will come onto to him and make our
[1:26:58] Abode our
[1:27:00] Abode I like
[1:27:02] that in other words he didn't say I'll
[1:27:05] come and visit
[1:27:06] you I'll come and I'll just come and do
[1:27:09] a spot
[1:27:11] blessing no we're we're going to live
[1:27:13] we're going to stay there in fact when
[1:27:15] people look at you they're not going to
[1:27:16] see you anymore they're going to see me
[1:27:18] in
[1:27:19] you all because of one word
[1:27:24] that
[1:27:27] word there's the there's the tiebreaker
[1:27:30] if a man loves
[1:27:33] me it's a love
[1:27:36] affair it doesn't matter if no one else
[1:27:39] wants to have this love
[1:27:41] relationship though none go with me
[1:27:43] still I'll follow it doesn't matter if
[1:27:46] no one else wants to work hard at
[1:27:48] keeping the Commandments in your
[1:27:50] home you be the one to work hard
[1:27:54] if you're willing to love God enough to
[1:27:57] keep the things he spoken to you then
[1:27:59] God will supernaturally come into our
[1:28:01] hearts and will begin to manifest the
[1:28:04] spirit inside of
[1:28:06] us you know it you know what just being
[1:28:10] honest with
[1:28:12] you none of us ever had to learn how to
[1:28:15] get upset and fight back at somebody
[1:28:18] when we were growing up we didn't get
[1:28:19] what we
[1:28:21] wanted nobody had to teach us this is
[1:28:23] how you fight fight for your
[1:28:26] rights but you know it takes the Holy
[1:28:30] Ghost inside of a man to lay down his
[1:28:34] life that Christ can be manifested at a
[1:28:37] time of just nothing but anger
[1:28:41] frustration just total
[1:28:45] chaos God has promised us that he would
[1:28:48] come inside and he would live it out for
[1:28:50] us so we didn't have to can you bear
[1:28:54] with me just a little bit longer all
[1:28:56] right I believe that we'll experience
[1:28:58] the deeper things of God if we just let
[1:29:01] the Holy Spirit come in it's a love
[1:29:05] relationship verse 24 he that loveth me
[1:29:07] not and keepeth not my
[1:29:11] Saints and the word which ye hear is not
[1:29:14] mine but the fathers that sent me these
[1:29:18] okay he that loveth me keepeth not my
[1:29:20] says I'm so sorry I'm going to read that
[1:29:23] correct corly I don't care if I got to
[1:29:25] stay here till 1:00 today amen he that
[1:29:28] loveth me not keepeth not my Saints I
[1:29:33] wish they just put comments in the right
[1:29:35] place so that's
[1:29:38] it you're really if you don't do what
[1:29:40] the word says you're really just saying
[1:29:42] you don't love
[1:29:43] God and the word which you hear it's not
[1:29:46] mine but the fathers that sent me so the
[1:29:50] Father in Heaven Jesus and this word
[1:29:52] they're the same
[1:29:54] they're all one in other words these
[1:29:56] things have I spoken unto you being yet
[1:29:59] present with you but the comfort of
[1:30:01] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[1:30:03] will send in my name he will he shall
[1:30:05] teach you all things and bring all
[1:30:07] things to your remance whatsoever I have
[1:30:09] said unto you the true anointing of the
[1:30:14] Holy Ghost will always always bring to
[1:30:18] your
[1:30:19] remembrance that you need to put your
[1:30:23] relation relationship with God number
[1:30:26] one and to love him above everything
[1:30:28] else there's a lot of things that we can
[1:30:31] talk about in the word we need them
[1:30:34] all but don't think that the holy spirit
[1:30:37] is never going to be reminding you of
[1:30:39] these things Jesus just said he would
[1:30:41] when the comforter the Holy Ghost comes
[1:30:43] he shall remind you of these things well
[1:30:46] what things is he talking about he's
[1:30:48] talking about keeping his word and to
[1:30:52] loving him but by by by
[1:30:54] by manifesting this love you can
[1:30:56] Manifest this love simply by
[1:31:00] simply doing what the word asks you to
[1:31:02] do in every situation some of you starts
[1:31:05] gossiping just turn away and say
[1:31:06] shouldn't do
[1:31:08] that what you're doing is you're
[1:31:09] manifesting the love of
[1:31:12] God somebody's getting angry at you just
[1:31:16] give a soft answer sincerely from your
[1:31:18] heart you know what you're doing you
[1:31:19] just manifested the love of
[1:31:22] God and this is why what I believe in
[1:31:25] this is what I believe in I believe in a
[1:31:28] God who can manifest himself in human
[1:31:31] flesh that's Jesus Christ the same
[1:31:33] yesterday today and forever and there
[1:31:36] are certain things that only God can do
[1:31:39] it's got to be his will right
[1:31:41] everybody's not called to be a
[1:31:43] prophet right but he did say the works I
[1:31:46] do you'll do also but that doesn't mean
[1:31:49] you can go in the hospital and raise
[1:31:51] everybody out from the hospital it
[1:31:53] doesn't mean God is going to answer
[1:31:54] every one of your prayers in the way
[1:31:56] that you want it to go if I'm saying it
[1:31:59] correctly but there is one thing that
[1:32:01] God will never stand in the
[1:32:03] way is him becoming one in your body if
[1:32:06] you let him he wants that more than
[1:32:10] anything is to manifest and he's got to
[1:32:12] go through through more agency to get
[1:32:14] that
[1:32:15] done now anyone can be kind to anyone
[1:32:20] they want to be kind to anyone can be
[1:32:23] merciful to anybody want to be merciful
[1:32:25] to whoever they think's worthy anybody
[1:32:27] can love anybody that they're being
[1:32:30] loved back by it's easy
[1:32:33] right anybody can give when somebody
[1:32:38] gives to
[1:32:40] them anybody can forgive if they seem
[1:32:44] worthy of your
[1:32:47] forgiveness but the Commandment of God
[1:32:49] is to love others the way that Christ
[1:32:52] loves us
[1:32:55] did God still love you when you weren't
[1:32:58] loving him at times we all can say yes
[1:33:02] but what that really means is that we
[1:33:04] need to start loving others when they're
[1:33:07] not loving
[1:33:09] us has God forgiven your trespasses when
[1:33:11] you trespassed against him we need to
[1:33:14] exercise forgiving others when they
[1:33:16] trespass against
[1:33:18] us has God turned his cheek when you
[1:33:22] turned his back on word has God given
[1:33:25] you another chance in other words then
[1:33:28] we need to learn to turn our cheek and
[1:33:30] walk the Second
[1:33:31] Mile more than what might be
[1:33:35] needed and has the holy spirit
[1:33:38] interceded for you when you were
[1:33:39] ignoring him and just kind of doing what
[1:33:41] you wanted to do just using
[1:33:43] him that we need to pray for those who
[1:33:46] despitefully use us say all manner of
[1:33:49] evil against us in other words that is
[1:33:53] the life that we should be living with
[1:33:55] the power of the Holy
[1:33:57] Ghost some people
[1:34:00] struggle with knowing how to work with
[1:34:04] others that they just don't agree with
[1:34:07] you know some people just have a hard
[1:34:09] time working with
[1:34:11] others how many times have you heard I I
[1:34:14] I could just I do better
[1:34:20] myself if I got to work with that person
[1:34:25] you know I just can't do
[1:34:30] it in Christ we're to be one and I
[1:34:35] believe this I believe if the holy
[1:34:38] spirit is inside of
[1:34:40] you then you can work with difficult
[1:34:43] situations you can work with difficult
[1:34:46] people because it's no longer you trying
[1:34:49] to do it but it's God in you amen and
[1:34:52] that's just what I believe Jesus said
[1:34:56] for if you love them which love you
[1:34:57] what's your reward do not even the
[1:35:00] publicans the same and if you Salute
[1:35:01] Your brotherr and only say God bless you
[1:35:03] I love you good to be with you today
[1:35:05] what do you more than others do not even
[1:35:08] the publicans in other words these are
[1:35:11] shallow things for a
[1:35:13] Believer the deeper things of God is
[1:35:15] when he comes inside and he manifest
[1:35:18] himself inside of our bodies and that
[1:35:20] we're able to love others and and and
[1:35:24] salute those who actually have something
[1:35:27] inside against
[1:35:29] you something more you know uh
[1:35:33] hypocritical inside of them are you with
[1:35:35] me amen I believe that God wants to
[1:35:40] manifest himself inside of us and I
[1:35:44] believe when he comes in and he
[1:35:46] manifests himself to us we will be able
[1:35:48] to love our
[1:35:50] enemies we will be to bless them that
[1:35:52] curse us we've been able to do a lot of
[1:35:55] good things for others no matter what
[1:35:57] they're doing all because that God has
[1:36:00] come inside of us and that's why I'm
[1:36:03] saying Saints we should not be satisfied
[1:36:06] with how much God we
[1:36:09] got we should be looking how we can
[1:36:11] manifest more of the holy spirit all
[1:36:13] right turn with me to John 15 and I just
[1:36:17] want to close with these last set of
[1:36:19] scriptures here and then we're done is
[1:36:22] that okay John 15:9 as the father has
[1:36:26] loved me so have I loved you and his
[1:36:31] word says now continue in my love he
[1:36:35] didn't say continue in your love
[1:36:37] continue to love he said continue in in
[1:36:41] my love if you keep my Commandments you
[1:36:45] shall abide in my love even as I've kept
[1:36:47] my father's Commandments and abide in
[1:36:50] his love these things have I spoken unto
[1:36:53] you that your joy might remain with you
[1:36:56] and that your joy might be full how many
[1:36:58] really
[1:37:00] sincerely would love to have more of the
[1:37:03] joy of the
[1:37:05] Lord well there there's there's there
[1:37:08] the answer is right here the answer is
[1:37:11] right
[1:37:12] here it's doing the things that God
[1:37:15] wants you to
[1:37:17] do you know how happy you get when you
[1:37:21] do something for somebody just makes you
[1:37:24] feel good that you did something for
[1:37:26] somebody just
[1:37:29] imagine how you're going to feel when
[1:37:31] you do something for
[1:37:34] Jesus
[1:37:36] amen this is my commandment that you
[1:37:38] love one another as I have loved
[1:37:43] you Greater Love have no man than this
[1:37:46] let's stand together that a man laid
[1:37:48] down his life for his
[1:37:51] friends Greater Love have no man than
[1:37:54] this than a man lay down his life for
[1:37:58] his
[1:38:00] friends and you are my
[1:38:03] friends what's that next
[1:38:06] word
[1:38:08] if if you are my friends if you do

[1:38:18] just play quietly I am so so needy Lord
[1:38:26] you are my friends if you do whatsoever
[1:38:29] I command
[1:38:31] you maybe we could just take a a moment
[1:38:34] at the end of this this message and
[1:38:40] just focus on our our love relationship
