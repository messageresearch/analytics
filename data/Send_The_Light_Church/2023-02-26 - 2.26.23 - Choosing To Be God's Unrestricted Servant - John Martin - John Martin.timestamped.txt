[34:42] because he's been so good to us think
[34:45] about it he chose us out of a million
[34:46] people
[34:48] to be alive and then he brought us out
[34:51] of the world
[34:53] he showed us His Marvelous Light
[34:56] and he gave us the choice to walk in it

[35:04] here today because of him amen so he's
[35:07] he's worthy to be praised each and every
[35:10] day God bless you if you turn with me to
[35:12] the Book of Joshua chapter 24
[35:16] I believe God's Gonna
[35:18] bless the reading of his word because we
[35:20] asked him to
[35:21] it and before we go to eat food
[35:25] we pray for the food
[35:28] before we eat spiritual food we should
[35:30] pray that
[35:31] we that God would break it to us
[35:34] and let it be what we have need of today
[35:38] we're certainly
[35:40] uh in prayer for the many needs that
[35:44] we're having and there's still a couple
[35:46] people Brother Bruce and citrogenia
[35:48] without power but they're both doing
[35:51] fine
[35:53] and uh for those that have been sick uh
[35:57] the Chanel family
[35:58] seeing those requests let's just
[36:01] we're believing
[36:03] that God
[36:05] is going to see us through we don't
[36:07] understand why we go through what we go
[36:08] through but we do know that God is in
[36:11] control
[36:12] amen Joshua chapter 24 stream with verse
[36:15] number 14 I trust you have your Bibles
[36:17] with you today
[36:19] now therefore fear the lord
[36:21] and serve them with sincerity and truth
[36:24] and put away the gods which your father
[36:26] served on the other side of the flood
[36:29] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and
[36:34] for it if it seemed evil unto you to
[36:38] serve the Lord choose you this day whom
[36:40] you are serve whether
[36:41] the gods which your father served that
[36:44] were on the other side of the flood or
[36:45] the gods of the amberites and whose Lane
[36:48] you dwell but as for me my house we will
[36:51] serve the Lord and the people answered
[36:54] and said God forbid that we should
[36:56] forsake the Lord to serve other gods
[37:00] notice the topic was we're serving the
[37:04] lord but
[37:05] to forsake
[37:07] current situation for the Lord Our God
[37:10] he it is that brought us up out of the
[37:12] uh brought us up and our fathers out of
[37:15] the land of Egypt from the house of
[37:18] bondage and which
[37:21] did those great signs in our sights and
[37:25] preserved Us in all the way wherein we
[37:28] went and among all the people through
[37:31] whom we passed and the Lord drave out
[37:34] from before us all the people even the
[37:36] amberites which throughout the land
[37:37] there for will we also serve the Lord he
[37:42] is our God now look at it sounds like a
[37:46] you know the people have made their
[37:48] decision here what's going to happen and
[37:50] and
[37:51] Joshua said unto the people you cannot
[37:55] serve the Lord
[37:57] for he is a holy God he is a jealous God
[38:02] he will not forgive your transgressions
[38:04] nor your sins
[38:07] if you forsake the Lord and was
[38:11] serve strange Gods then he will turn and
[38:16] do your hurt
[38:17] and consume you after that you have
[38:19] after he have done you good
[38:22] and the people said unto Joshua nay but
[38:25] we will serve the Lord and Joshua said
[38:27] unto the people ye are witnesses against
[38:29] yourselves
[38:31] that you have chosen you
[38:34] to uh that you have chosen you the Lord
[38:37] to serve him
[38:39] and they said we Are Witnesses
[38:42] now therefore put away said he the
[38:45] strange God's which are presently among
[38:48] you and incline your heart unto the Lord
[38:51] God of Israel and the people said unto
[38:54] Joshua the Lord Our God we will We Serve
[38:57] and his voice will we obey amen God
[39:02] bless you may be seated
[39:09] I want to take our our thought from
[39:11] verse 15 and if it seemed evil unto you
[39:14] to serve the Lord choose you this day
[39:16] whom you will serve now this is a very
[39:18] common scripture we've read it before
[39:20] we've spoke on it before but I want to
[39:22] take a little different thought today
[39:25] uh people enjoy exercising their rights
[39:29] on what they're going to do what they're
[39:31] going to do who they're going to serve
[39:34] and I watch people exercise their rights
[39:37] and restaurants we've all have we've
[39:39] seen those people who are just I ordered
[39:40] this I demanded this how come this
[39:43] hasn't come and they like to exercise
[39:45] their rights I've seen it in Banks I've
[39:47] seen it at work I've seen it in
[39:48] department stores uh I you know this is
[39:52] not what I ordered on Amazon I have a
[39:54] right
[39:55] so people like to exercise their rights
[39:58] brother Brandon said in the message
[39:59] laodicean churches he says notice the
[40:01] name laodicea
[40:03] it means the people's rights the age
[40:06] that we're living in or Justice of the
[40:09] people
[40:10] was there ever an age like the 20th
[40:13] century Church age that has seen all the
[40:16] nations rise up in demanding equality
[40:18] and social and financial just
[40:21] demanding equal I mean we've got men
[40:24] that are demanding that they'd not be
[40:26] called men that they want to be called a
[40:28] transgender
[40:30] and we've got women the same way and
[40:32] they got a right to and the the gays are
[40:35] pushing their rights the the different
[40:37] nationalities are pushing their rights
[40:40] and it's the age that we're living and
[40:41] we see it coming to a head
[40:45] everyone wants to exercise their rights
[40:48] Lucifer got a third of the angels to
[40:50] exercise their rights remember God
[40:53] didn't annihilate them right there
[40:55] because they made a decision to go and
[40:57] do their own will
[40:59] they they the three more agency and they
[41:01] went right
[41:03] and and and and and uh
[41:06] our rights is a scary thing
[41:09] I've seen Christians wanting to exercise
[41:11] their rights I don't have to do that I
[41:13] shouldn't have to do that don't tell me
[41:16] are you with me
[41:18] no I'll say just let's you're going to
[41:20] probably hear some things you
[41:23] don't want to hear
[41:24] this morning
[41:26] but just say like this be like the Holy
[41:29] Ghost the Holy Ghost says Amen to every
[41:31] word of God now if it ain't in the word
[41:33] you don't have to say Amen
[41:35] but it fits in there just just agree
[41:38] with the Holy Ghost because it does say
[41:39] Amen to every word of God
[41:41] Believers seem to be so restricted on
[41:44] what they want to do for God like
[41:47] restrictions
[41:49] what they want to do for God's house
[41:52] how they're going to serve
[41:55] when they're going to come to church and
[41:56] what they're going to do for so and so
[41:59] I view them as restricted believers
[42:03] in other words they have rights and
[42:06] they're going to exercise them
[42:07] brother Brian amen
[42:10] okay you're already starting to slip on
[42:12] me
[42:13] brother Brandon said in the message the
[42:15] working of the Holy Spirit he says you
[42:17] know a lamb is an odd animal
[42:20] Atlanta's got its own woe it's got its
[42:24] god-given rights
[42:26] but is willing to lay upon a block and
[42:29] not kick
[42:31] if you've never seen sheer any sheep he
[42:34] says I have but I'll I'll it'll let
[42:38] everything be shaved off of it give its
[42:40] rights and forfeit because it's Meek and
[42:44] it's gentle
[42:47] he says are you ready to lay down and
[42:49] give all your rights
[42:52] you say well now look Mr Brandon I got a
[42:54] right to get back he done something to
[42:57] me and I just got a right to to brawl
[43:00] him out
[43:03] but are you ready to shave off and
[43:05] forfeit them rights
[43:06] oh I'll tell you when I ought to do
[43:09] that may be so but are you ready to
[43:12] shave off
[43:13] God wants Lambs that are willing to be
[43:16] shaved off and become creatures of God
[43:22] see he determines whether or not
[43:27] we're where we need to be
[43:30] and and honestly we come here to the
[43:32] house of God to find out if where we're
[43:34] at is where we should be
[43:37] and that's the beauty of the word
[43:40] because if we want to know God will show
[43:43] us
[43:44] but if we want to exercise our rights
[43:48] then that's a different story I'd like
[43:50] to title this message choosing to be
[43:52] God's unrestricted servant last service
[43:56] we try to encourage the Saints about be
[43:58] not weary and well doing
[44:00] the Bible says for in due season we
[44:02] shall reap if we faint not and this is
[44:04] not a part two but I want to for a
[44:06] subject today talk about making yourself
[44:08] a servant amen making yourself a servant
[44:12] now in this great hour that we're living
[44:15] it's a dark hour we're living in the
[44:18] Bible says there would be a falling away
[44:20] there are many believers who have chosen
[44:22] not to believe like they used to believe
[44:25] they've chosen not to serve like they
[44:28] used to serve
[44:30] and there are many that are struggling
[44:32] today with their commitments that
[44:34] they've that they want to make they're
[44:36] afraid to make they're afraid they can't
[44:38] keep them and they've lost their Joy
[44:41] they've lost their strength they've lost
[44:42] their power to serve like they once did
[44:44] and and they've replaced it and many of
[44:46] them were just a form of godliness or
[44:49] religiousness about their demeanor and
[44:51] how they talk
[44:53] serving the lord is a choice as we all
[44:56] know but how we serve God is totally
[45:01] different
[45:04] than just
[45:05] choosing to serve God because so many
[45:07] people say they're serving God but how
[45:09] they're serving God is totally different
[45:14] so we can choose to serve God as lot did
[45:17] or we can choose to serve God as Abraham
[45:20] did
[45:21] amen and brother Brian says it took a
[45:23] hundred lots to make one Abraham they're
[45:25] both serving
[45:27] right you can choose the well-watered
[45:30] planes of of of uh of Jordan towards
[45:33] Sodom you can pitch your tent towards
[45:35] the things that are comfortable in this
[45:37] life or you can choose to share all
[45:39] those rights away and just stay strictly
[45:43] with the word
[45:45] and it's a choice that we have every day
[45:48] it's not a choice that we just make once
[45:50] and it's over with amen it's chosen
[45:53] every day
[45:55] we can choose to serve God and serve
[45:57] ourselves at the same time or we can
[45:59] choose to serve God Alone
[46:03] there's a difference
[46:05] we can say we've chosen to serve the
[46:07] Lord but how we choose to serve him is a
[46:10] totally different thing
[46:13] we may not think much about God
[46:16] what he really requires of us as his
[46:20] subjects in how we serve him as long as
[46:22] we you know do this and this and this as
[46:25] long as we pay our tithes
[46:28] as long as we fill in the blank and then
[46:32] so we must be serving God if we're doing
[46:34] that
[46:36] I believe God requires a total sellout
[46:42] now it doesn't mean you have to totally
[46:44] sell out you have a choice in the matter
[46:47] I'm only saying that if you choose to
[46:49] serve God acceptably in his sight it
[46:52] requires a total sellout amen now I'm
[46:56] telling you
[46:57] um we're all struggling
[46:59] to be that
[47:01] if you're not you're not being honest
[47:05] because this flesh doesn't want to die
[47:07] out on a daily basis
[47:10] now Joshua 24 verse 14 says now
[47:13] therefore fear the lord and serve him
[47:16] look at this in sincerity
[47:19] boy that I mean how many is that going
[47:22] to knock out right there
[47:24] and in truth
[47:27] and put away the Gods
[47:30] which your father served on the other
[47:32] side of the flood in Egypt and serve ye
[47:34] the Lord now I can tell you I put away
[47:37] some of the Gods
[47:39] that my father served
[47:42] but I know that the devil is trying to
[47:45] constantly get me interested in other
[47:47] gods
[47:48] amen every billboard every time you open
[47:51] your phone you got I didn't ask for
[47:53] these advertisements I was looking for
[47:55] something else
[47:57] and Joshua's verse 19 Joshua said unto
[48:00] the people you cannot serve the Lord for
[48:03] his holy
[48:04] for he is a holy for he is and holy God
[48:07] and he is a jealous God
[48:10] he's not going to allow
[48:14] the devil to be in the same
[48:17] room
[48:19] down here with him
[48:21] are you with me
[48:23] he will not forgive your transgressions
[48:26] nor your sins if he forsake the Lord and
[48:30] serve strange Gods then he will turn
[48:36] and do you hurt and consume you after
[48:39] that you have done you go so here's a
[48:40] god a loving God that we have a
[48:43] scripture here that he's actually going
[48:44] to do us hurt
[48:46] I mean how many times have we wondered
[48:48] why we're going through what we're going
[48:49] through why is this happening and then
[48:52] we question
[48:53] Lord did I miss you somewhere
[48:57] it's time to turn over rocks if I could
[49:00] say it like this it's time to do a
[49:02] checkup instead of being proud and
[49:05] assuming that all that we're doing is
[49:07] okay and always everything we're doing
[49:09] is working out for the good and all
[49:13] the devil has a way of getting in there
[49:15] and then camouflaging himself
[49:18] and we don't know what's happening God
[49:21] is able to do us hurt
[49:23] and he's able the Bible says to make all
[49:25] grace abound unto us
[49:29] Amen Brother John what do we do
[49:32] what do we do to get that Grace to
[49:34] always abound with us I say let this
[49:36] stay humble
[49:37] stay humble keep serving the Lord with
[49:40] all your heart
[49:41] don't let other things creep in the way
[49:44] in order to do that you've got to do
[49:46] constant checkups
[49:48] he giveth more grace to the humble If my
[49:51] people which are called by my name shall
[49:53] humble themselves
[49:56] I will hear from heaven
[49:58] and I will heal their land
[50:01] my people
[50:04] so these people as we read here in
[50:06] Joshua
[50:08] can have
[50:11] Satan is presenting opportunities all
[50:13] the time that we could just kind of slip
[50:15] back and serve ourself
[50:18] when you serve yourself you're serving
[50:20] strange God Amen that's the truth
[50:25] it doesn't necessarily have to be that
[50:27] thing on the TV
[50:30] or that one hobby that you're spending
[50:32] more time with than you are with God
[50:36] it just it's all about
[50:39] you can become a God I was a God I know
[50:41] when I first before I came to Christ I
[50:43] mean I had I was into all the things
[50:45] that I was doing and I I was God I made
[50:48] my decisions
[50:50] I had to Forfeit that if I really wanted
[50:52] to get saved
[50:54] I had to repent I had to Forfeit
[50:59] but since then the devil gets Morse you
[51:02] know he he uses ways to trick us to get
[51:06] back
[51:08] the Bible says but a humble and contrite
[51:10] heart why not despise so I say stay
[51:13] humble
[51:15] we were born to serve the Lord
[51:18] and only the Lord
[51:22] when we serve ourselves sometimes
[51:26] we're out
[51:29] let's take a look at this Rich Young
[51:31] Ruler he had a choice to serve the Lord
[51:34] in fact
[51:35] the Bible tells us that he had observed
[51:38] the Commandments from his youth but when
[51:41] he when he
[51:44] came to wanting more truth to walk in
[51:48] further truth and we know the Lord was a
[51:51] jealous God
[51:52] that's what what
[51:54] God told the children of Israel there
[51:56] and Joshua that he's a jealous God and
[51:59] and Jesus said well you've got to go
[52:00] sell everything you have and go give it
[52:02] to the poor and then you come and follow
[52:04] me
[52:05] because there was something standing in
[52:08] the way right
[52:10] and we take this lightly but we
[52:12] shouldn't because don't you think that
[52:15] God that the devil doesn't come to us
[52:17] and present to us strange gods
[52:23] here was a man that was serving the lord
[52:25] and the devil got in there and this
[52:28] thing was so tight to him that he was
[52:31] unwilling to give it up and put God to
[52:33] sell out Lock Stock and Barrel right
[52:42] in the message the world is falling
[52:44] apart brother Ryan says don't come God
[52:47] don't come to your terms
[52:52] you come to his terms
[52:55] or you don't come at all you notice
[52:58] Jesus never said to the Rich Young Ruler
[53:00] you know what
[53:02] let's just reason this thing together
[53:07] I need you as a disciple in the church
[53:10] I really need you in the ministry
[53:12] because you know there's a lot of things
[53:14] to do and if you could just come and
[53:16] just be a little bit more faded just to
[53:19] give a little bit more in the offering
[53:20] then you know then you can follow me
[53:25] doesn't that sound like Satan
[53:30] but here's the thing this is all about
[53:32] our heart in God that's why we're here
[53:34] today
[53:35] that's why we come every service it's
[53:38] about our relationship with God it's not
[53:41] about gaining knowledge
[53:43] it's not doing it's not about even doing
[53:45] our due diligence
[53:47] you know brother Brandon makes a strong
[53:49] statement that we can never leave
[53:50] service the way we came
[53:53] we're either closer or further away now
[53:55] how many times we ever walk out of our
[53:56] service and say I know I'm further away
[53:58] from God
[54:01] because we don't want to think like that
[54:03] but by rejecting the word
[54:06] you automatically get further away
[54:09] so we don't want to reject the word amen
[54:12] now remember we all have a choice to
[54:14] serve God in any way we want to
[54:16] but if you want to serve God in the way
[54:19] that pleases him then you have to come
[54:21] to his terms right you can't do it on
[54:24] our own terms we must sell out
[54:26] everything to serve him now I'm not
[54:28] saying that we need to put all the money
[54:31] into the box back there that's not what
[54:34] I am saying but what I am saying is I do
[54:37] know the God that I serve
[54:39] has a voice
[54:42] amen and his sheep know his voice and he
[54:45] speaks to his sheep
[54:47] and if we just follow what he says
[54:50] everything's going to work out in our
[54:52] lives
[54:53] Romans chapter 12 verse 1 says I beseech
[54:55] you therefore Brethren by the mercies of
[54:58] God that you present your body a Living
[55:03] Sacrifice holy there's that word again
[55:06] acceptable unto God which is your
[55:09] reasonable service well it's a much
[55:12] different definition than what most
[55:14] people would Define uh Christianity here
[55:18] and be not conformed to this world but
[55:20] be transformed by the renewing of your
[55:23] mind
[55:24] that you may prove what is that good and
[55:27] acceptable and perfect will of God
[55:31] to serve God acceptably to serve God
[55:35] according to his perfect will we must
[55:38] forsake ourself
[55:41] our plans our goals
[55:44] our desires
[55:47] everything that we want that is outside
[55:51] of God we must forsake
[55:54] and present ourselves as an unrestricted
[55:59] servant of God Amen
[56:02] amen and the Bible tells us that's the
[56:05] reasonable service
[56:07] in other words that is what God requires
[56:11] it it may not be what churches require
[56:13] it may not be what a husband and a wife
[56:16] require it may not be what our mom and
[56:18] dad require it may not be what our close
[56:21] friends require other brothers and
[56:23] sisters in their church but it is what
[56:25] God requires
[56:29] our nature is to get by with the least
[56:32] amount of work as possible that's the
[56:35] nature we're born with Brethren said in
[56:37] the message the resurrection of Lazarus
[56:38] he says you've got to approach God in
[56:40] the right way
[56:41] you can't come and say now Laura looky
[56:44] here I've been a pretty good fella
[56:47] I get some hand-me-downs you know
[56:51] but I tell you
[56:52] uh I I want you to take me tonight and
[56:55] say
[56:56] no no brother bran says
[57:00] you don't take it like that you come to
[57:02] God
[57:03] you you come God's provided way or you
[57:06] don't come at all
[57:08] that's right that's true so so in in the
[57:10] midst of every time we go to God in
[57:12] prayer and every time we're seeking them
[57:14] for something and every time we come to
[57:16] church we want a closer walk you know
[57:18] there's a right way to approach him
[57:22] is you can't approach him here with your
[57:25] rights
[57:27] we have no rights in our flesh
[57:32] no Esther was married to the king
[57:38] but she still approached the king
[57:42] if it be pleasing in your sight
[57:46] see the difference even though we're
[57:48] married to Jesus Christ we still need to
[57:51] have an attitude of humility
[57:53] we have to we can't always come and
[57:56] demand numbers this is right I
[58:00] I understand that
[58:04] sometimes we need to take the name of
[58:07] Jesus and take control of situations
[58:10] and God has given us that right
[58:13] but to go ahead and try to exercise that
[58:17] right
[58:18] without humility before Christ
[58:21] is only using God
[58:27] because God be above that above those
[58:30] rights God wants a relationship with you
[58:34] of humility
[58:36] you're constantly in that place of an
[58:40] unrestricted servant Lord whatever you
[58:42] want me to do I'm willing to do
[58:48] we have chosen to serve the Lord all of
[58:51] us hear it
[58:54] but how we choose to serve the Lord
[58:58] is really what's going to make the
[58:59] difference
[59:00] with all of us
[59:03] he wants us all in
[59:06] that's it all in if you can say I'm all
[59:09] into Christ you should be able to just
[59:12] enjoy saying Amen to the service
[59:15] but if you're struggling about being all
[59:18] in
[59:19] then let God speak to you about getting
[59:23] all in
[59:24] in the message time tested Memorials of
[59:27] God
[59:28] he said in you businessmen
[59:31] if you don't if you just do a patch up
[59:34] job see what I mean just a halfway job
[59:37] don't do that
[59:39] he says if you can't do it right then
[59:41] don't do it at all
[59:43] can you say Amen to that anybody want
[59:45] anybody want somebody coming over your
[59:46] house and doing a patch up job
[59:49] oh that's why we got brother Stan here
[59:52] because he's not a patch up job man
[59:55] he's all in
[59:57] he's all in and this he's so much in
[1:00:00] this is how much he's in he'll go ahead
[1:00:03] and he'll lose money on a job to make
[1:00:06] sure it turns out right amen
[1:00:08] amen and there's another brother the
[1:00:10] same way and that's the way to be
[1:00:13] if you don't get what you want out of it
[1:00:15] you're still going to do it amen so
[1:00:17] brother Brandon says when you come to
[1:00:18] Christ if you can't absolutely sell out
[1:00:21] Lock Stock and Barrel and come to Christ
[1:00:25] he said don't come
[1:00:28] at all
[1:00:29] wow
[1:00:31] here's the god that wants you to come to
[1:00:33] him
[1:00:35] but he's also saying don't come if
[1:00:37] you're not going to come
[1:00:38] with all your heart
[1:00:40] if you're just going to come what part
[1:00:42] all you're going to do is just make have
[1:00:44] it for your life
[1:00:47] but when you really want to be a
[1:00:48] Christian Stand Out make it real
[1:00:51] that's what God wants you to be
[1:00:53] and that'll prove your Works will prove
[1:00:56] what your character is
[1:00:58] and your character is known by your
[1:01:00] works that you do
[1:01:03] I love that scripture
[1:01:05] the only way that you and I are going to
[1:01:08] absolutely sell out Lock Stock and
[1:01:10] Barrel is to love him with all of our
[1:01:13] heart that's the only way
[1:01:16] because you're you're just not going to
[1:01:17] sell out if you're not in love with him
[1:01:20] God's true intention
[1:01:22] for saving us was to serve him
[1:01:24] acceptably
[1:01:26] that was what was behind God's motive
[1:01:28] when he saved us to begin with
[1:01:30] is that we would serve him acceptedly
[1:01:33] but
[1:01:35] we can see that there's a choice that we
[1:01:37] make every day how many people has God
[1:01:39] saved and then afterwards destroyed them
[1:01:42] right that's true he said I'll bring you
[1:01:43] to remembrance after I saved the people
[1:01:45] out of the land of Egypt I destroyed
[1:01:47] them that believed not so it is very
[1:01:49] easy for us to start out with Christ and
[1:01:53] through the process drop off
[1:01:58] it's a real thing there's real spirits
[1:02:00] and uh we need to be careful about what
[1:02:04] Spirits we're entertaining
[1:02:07] we don't want to start serving or
[1:02:08] bringing in a strange God
[1:02:11] we we understand that God can do us hurt
[1:02:16] and and all we have to do this is it can
[1:02:19] be as simple as this God asks you to do
[1:02:22] one thing
[1:02:23] just one thing
[1:02:26] and you say
[1:02:28] no not right now
[1:02:31] that's it all sudden a strange God is
[1:02:34] before him and he's a jealous God
[1:02:37] and then things can start to go sideways
[1:02:44] God's intention
[1:02:47] of freeing the children of Israel from
[1:02:50] bondage that they were in in Egypt was
[1:02:52] that they would serve him
[1:02:55] acceptably
[1:02:57] can you say Amen to that I'm just we're
[1:03:00] not going to turn to them all but it
[1:03:02] wasn't just a freedom from bondage
[1:03:05] but it was so that they would serve him
[1:03:07] and you can find that Nexus 8 1 8 20 9 1
[1:03:11] and 9 13. I just want to read 10-3 right
[1:03:13] now and Moses and Aaron came came in
[1:03:17] unto pharaoh and said unto him thus
[1:03:18] saith the Lord God of the Hebrews how
[1:03:21] long will thou refuse to Humble thyself
[1:03:23] before me Let My People Go that they may
[1:03:29] serve me
[1:03:32] now while you're reading this brother
[1:03:33] John I'm reading this because so often
[1:03:36] we think God has set us free that we can
[1:03:38] just do whatever we want to do
[1:03:41] and that's not why he's set us free
[1:03:46] and even in Exodus 7 16 he says that
[1:03:49] they may serve me in the wilderness
[1:03:51] which we know they failed to do
[1:03:54] they complain they murmured
[1:03:57] they kept oh it would be better if I was
[1:03:59] back in Egypt
[1:04:01] I mean come on so God expects us even to
[1:04:05] serve him in the middle of our trials
[1:04:06] that we're going through
[1:04:08] because that's what the Wilderness
[1:04:10] experience was God was proving them
[1:04:13] and they proved not to be faithful to
[1:04:16] the Lord
[1:04:18] God never intended us to set us free
[1:04:20] from everything just so we could have
[1:04:21] the freedom
[1:04:23] to serve ourselves and to do what we
[1:04:26] want to do and I see so many
[1:04:28] so many Believers doing that
[1:04:32] even after God sets us free we still
[1:04:34] have a choice
[1:04:36] who we're going to continue to serve
[1:04:39] are we going to serve ourselves are we
[1:04:40] going to serve God and
[1:04:42] the book
[1:04:43] called the Bible here in uh II Timothy
[1:04:47] you can find out that
[1:04:50] Paul talks about perilous times that
[1:04:52] there would be in the church today and
[1:04:54] that the actual Believers would be be
[1:04:56] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:04:58] God so they have they have mixed in
[1:05:01] strange Gods right
[1:05:03] in the church
[1:05:05] in other words they they're not up here
[1:05:07] preaching hey let's serve ourselves
[1:05:08] they're not doing that
[1:05:10] what they're doing is they're coming
[1:05:11] into the church with that mentality when
[1:05:15] the word is being preached and they say
[1:05:18] I don't have to change
[1:05:22] that's what's happening that's why it's
[1:05:24] Peerless times and then the Believers
[1:05:26] mixed with the
[1:05:27] make-believers
[1:05:30] and they grow friendships together
[1:05:32] and before you know it their friendships
[1:05:35] become more powerful than the word of
[1:05:37] God being preached
[1:05:38] and I'm speaking the truth
[1:05:41] I'm speaking the truth
[1:05:44] we need to just
[1:05:46] love the word more than anything else in
[1:05:49] the world that is the only way that
[1:05:52] we're going to be kept from these
[1:05:54] perilous times that we're living in
[1:05:58] we don't want to choose
[1:06:00] to serve strange odds no wonder Jesus
[1:06:02] said in the last age he said I will spew
[1:06:05] thee out of my mouth or just lukewarm
[1:06:08] part Christian part not part believer
[1:06:11] part not but they're not sold out
[1:06:15] no wonder Jesus said many are called
[1:06:18] but if you're chosen many are called to
[1:06:21] sell out livestock and Barrel but only
[1:06:23] few are chosen to serve Christ with all
[1:06:27] their heart
[1:06:28] the majority that's been called to sell
[1:06:32] out everything they they just choose not
[1:06:34] to they choose not to serve him
[1:06:37] acceptably they choose not to to prove
[1:06:41] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:06:42] perfect will of God
[1:06:45] now we've been set free by Christ Jesus
[1:06:48] himself said he that the son is set free
[1:06:51] is free indeed it's it's the word and we
[1:06:54] we claim that scripture
[1:06:56] don't we
[1:06:58] come on get into this word
[1:07:01] it'll help you know I I take a lot of
[1:07:04] pills every day I don't even want to
[1:07:05] tell you how many pills I take I take
[1:07:07] more pills and probably everybody
[1:07:08] combined in here
[1:07:10] I think brother Mark knows I've told him
[1:07:12] don't you tell anybody but some of the
[1:07:16] pills I take are small and some are real
[1:07:18] big
[1:07:19] and you know what it's like when you
[1:07:20] take a horse pill
[1:07:23] it is like you need something to help
[1:07:25] take it down
[1:07:27] and I just say some of these pills that
[1:07:29] we're swallowing today they're big pills
[1:07:31] I don't just say you you need a little
[1:07:34] help getting it down with a little amen
[1:07:37] so be it Lauren
[1:07:39] he that the son is set free is free
[1:07:41] indeed that's what the scripture says
[1:07:43] that's what Jesus said but the scripture
[1:07:44] also says that you are not your own your
[1:07:47] ball with a price
[1:07:51] so are we owned by Christ or have we
[1:07:54] been set free
[1:07:59] all the confusion in being a Christian
[1:08:03] am I really free
[1:08:04] or am I own by the will of God
[1:08:08] this is the Dilemma that we find
[1:08:11] ourselves in
[1:08:13] because if we if we lean towards the one
[1:08:17] you know I'm free I can do what I want
[1:08:19] don't tell me God tells I do everything
[1:08:22] that God tells
[1:08:26] I can do what I want well
[1:08:29] then you're really not bought with a
[1:08:31] price
[1:08:33] you really don't belong to the one that
[1:08:36] bought you
[1:08:37] and that's why we can't be saved and
[1:08:39] then lose it
[1:08:42] so we're this is I understand we made a
[1:08:45] major decision when we got baptized it
[1:08:47] was the best one you can make on the
[1:08:48] planet
[1:08:50] it was the best one that you could make
[1:08:53] but the next best one uh
[1:08:56] the next best one is that you make it
[1:08:59] the next day
[1:09:00] you make that same decision the next day
[1:09:03] and the next day and the next day and
[1:09:05] the rest of the days of your life
[1:09:12] God's servants are man-made
[1:09:15] I Gotta Throw these things out here
[1:09:17] because I want you to ponder these
[1:09:18] thoughts
[1:09:19] God's servants are man made
[1:09:23] there's a controversy over if God's
[1:09:26] servants are God called or if they're
[1:09:29] man-made I say a controversy and I just
[1:09:31] if I could say it like this is both
[1:09:34] just want to bring a balance to this
[1:09:37] we are all called to be sold out
[1:09:39] servants to Christ
[1:09:42] but it doesn't happen on its own in fact
[1:09:45] it can't happen unless you choose to
[1:09:48] sell out
[1:09:50] it's not going to happen if you don't
[1:09:52] choose to be an unrestricted servant of
[1:09:55] God
[1:09:57] uh
[1:09:59] it won't happen
[1:10:01] God doesn't have these
[1:10:04] special people
[1:10:06] that are just unrestricted servants
[1:10:09] they're like robots I chose them they
[1:10:12] don't have nothing to do with it
[1:10:14] no every one of us has to go to the
[1:10:18] Freemore agency
[1:10:20] every one of us has to make a decision
[1:10:22] if we're going to serve because God
[1:10:25] don't have robots
[1:10:29] so we can see that yes there's a calling
[1:10:32] but then man has to choose
[1:10:36] choose to make himself a servant and you
[1:10:39] can make yourself a restricted servant
[1:10:42] I'm only going to do this I'm only going
[1:10:44] to do that and after that it's between
[1:10:46] me and God
[1:10:48] and don't tell me
[1:10:50] don't act like you're a vessel that God
[1:10:52] uses to speak to me either
[1:10:59] or you can choose to be an unrestricted
[1:11:02] servant I'm
[1:11:05] I'm ready for Duty Lord
[1:11:07] I'm here whatever you would have me to
[1:11:09] do wherever you have me to go whatever
[1:11:11] you'd have me to say or however you'd
[1:11:13] like me to spend my time I'm here
[1:11:16] because that's what God's looking for
[1:11:18] don't you believe
[1:11:20] I believe God's servants are man-made
[1:11:23] because God don't have any robots
[1:11:28] Paul's life
[1:11:33] he before God came to Paul
[1:11:37] he basically did what he wanted to do
[1:11:41] and he served
[1:11:43] he didn't even know the God he was
[1:11:44] serving
[1:11:46] honestly because when
[1:11:48] the Lord appeared to him he said who art
[1:11:50] thou
[1:11:51] he didn't even know and yet he went to
[1:11:53] church and he was the highest and the
[1:11:56] greatest and above
[1:11:59] said under the best teaching in the
[1:12:01] message
[1:12:04] but he still didn't know
[1:12:07] he still didn't know in First
[1:12:09] Corinthians 1 1
[1:12:10] St Corinthians 1 1 Paul called to be
[1:12:17] an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:12:20] through the will of God
[1:12:24] and Sophie is our brother okay
[1:12:28] now we're called through the will of God
[1:12:32] for his purpose
[1:12:35] we're called to the will of God for his
[1:12:38] purpose
[1:12:39] and we're all called to do different
[1:12:41] things
[1:12:42] okay Romans 1 once I'm glad you're with
[1:12:45] me because you're going to get more out
[1:12:47] of this if you stay with me Romans 1 1
[1:12:48] Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to
[1:12:53] be an apostle separated unto the gospel
[1:12:56] of God now notice here Paul is not
[1:12:59] called to be a servant
[1:13:02] he's called to be an apostle you cannot
[1:13:04] find scripture where it says Paul was
[1:13:07] called to be a servant
[1:13:12] it's a choice
[1:13:14] it's a choice that you make
[1:13:18] it's not a calling it's a choice
[1:13:21] amen so when you look at people serving
[1:13:25] God it's a choice that they've made it's
[1:13:28] not a calling that God puts special upon
[1:13:30] them because it's upon all men
[1:13:36] it's just we all have to make that same
[1:13:38] choice just like we all have to stand
[1:13:39] before the Lord
[1:13:41] right
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:47] you will find that Paul
[1:13:50] was called to be a minister he was
[1:13:52] called to be an apostle
[1:13:53] but you will not find any Scripture
[1:13:55] where Paul was called to be a servant
[1:13:59] Paul did choose every day to serve he
[1:14:02] chose to be an unrestricted servant of
[1:14:04] God he he he he presented his body of
[1:14:07] living sacrifices we read the scriptures
[1:14:09] of what he actually went through he
[1:14:12] suffered so many things
[1:14:14] but it was all through choice
[1:14:17] he chose to serve God it wasn't going to
[1:14:20] be easy
[1:14:21] in fact if you're serious about serving
[1:14:23] God
[1:14:25] if you're serious about serving God more
[1:14:27] than you are
[1:14:30] I heard a minister say one time you
[1:14:32] better get thick skin
[1:14:34] because the devil's after you and he'll
[1:14:37] use whoever he can to get you off the
[1:14:40] track of putting God first in your life
[1:14:42] and working for the kingdom
[1:14:45] look I'll say it like this we're all
[1:14:47] going to have problems in life look
[1:14:49] what's happening in the world
[1:14:51] everybody's suffering
[1:14:54] I mean who do you know who's living a
[1:14:56] bed of ease who do you know
[1:14:59] okay why are we searching for it right
[1:15:03] why are we hungering for it we're all
[1:15:05] going to suffer you might as well suffer
[1:15:07] for something you get rewarded for
[1:15:09] you might also choose you this day whom
[1:15:12] you'll serve
[1:15:13] praise the Lord
[1:15:17] now we call ministers Servants of God
[1:15:21] is that true
[1:15:24] and they are in one way
[1:15:26] but in another way they're just serving
[1:15:30] their call to minister
[1:15:32] I want you to catch what I'm saying here
[1:15:36] if they are called to minister in their
[1:15:37] ministering then they're serving their
[1:15:40] calling
[1:15:42] but that doesn't mean they've chosen to
[1:15:45] serve Christ with their whole life
[1:15:48] there's a difference
[1:15:50] there's a difference between someone who
[1:15:52] ministers and someone who serves and
[1:15:54] that's why I've often said you don't
[1:15:56] have to be a minister to be the greatest
[1:15:58] servant of all
[1:16:02] you just got to choose to give your life
[1:16:05] the Bible says first of all
[1:16:08] gifts and callings are without
[1:16:09] repentance
[1:16:11] God chooses to give us all gifts and we
[1:16:15] all got gifts whether we repent or not
[1:16:17] we got gifts
[1:16:19] we're going to be getting into that in
[1:16:21] the next few months
[1:16:24] I think we should use our gifts for the
[1:16:26] kingdom of God
[1:16:27] not for ourselves Amen brother Ram told
[1:16:30] us what happens when we sell out and use
[1:16:32] our gifts for ourselves right
[1:16:34] right and give us examples of those in
[1:16:36] the world who used to play for the Lord
[1:16:41] and then went out into the world
[1:16:44] God doesn't choose who will serve him
[1:16:51] he wouldn't all men would come unto
[1:16:54] repentance and serve him
[1:16:56] that's his desire
[1:16:58] but people have to make their own choice
[1:17:03] they must choose who they're going to
[1:17:05] serve every day God don't make robots
[1:17:08] God Don't Make men to serve him outside
[1:17:10] of Primo agency
[1:17:13] so don't look at people and say oh God
[1:17:15] called him to
[1:17:17] no look at them and say they they're
[1:17:19] making a choice to serve God in their
[1:17:22] bodies they're choosing to give their
[1:17:24] life over what they could have
[1:17:27] you know brother Brandon could have been
[1:17:29] a multi-millionaire
[1:17:31] brother Brandon could have had his own
[1:17:33] denomination
[1:17:35] president could have had a lot right
[1:17:38] but he chose to serve the father
[1:17:41] we all have that same Choice amen we're
[1:17:45] presented with a lot of stuff from the
[1:17:46] Devil
[1:17:48] and and we've got to take this word more
[1:17:52] serious we've got to start growing in
[1:17:53] the Lord we've got to start growing
[1:17:56] spiritually we got to start getting more
[1:17:57] involved in the things of God
[1:18:00] instead of just using God
[1:18:03] for something
[1:18:05] to help our lives and start serving God
[1:18:08] for his kingdom are you with me
[1:18:13] man chooses to serve man chooses to make
[1:18:17] himself a servant of God and we must
[1:18:19] make the choice to be in unrestricted
[1:18:22] servant for his kingdom
[1:18:26] Paul was called to be an apostle
[1:18:28] Jesus said set him free from all his
[1:18:30] murderous acts and his hatred his malice
[1:18:33] as ill-speaking his self-serving from
[1:18:35] building his own reputation
[1:18:38] from acting like he was better than
[1:18:40] others
[1:18:42] Jesus said set him free from all those
[1:18:44] things
[1:18:46] Paul said for what things were gained to
[1:18:50] me I counted loss
[1:18:53] Paul being a free man having been set
[1:18:56] free from the bondage of himself
[1:18:58] he had to make a choice
[1:19:03] would he choose to live for himself now
[1:19:05] that he's been set free
[1:19:08] or would he choose to serve him who set
[1:19:10] him free
[1:19:13] amen think about those ten lepers that
[1:19:14] came
[1:19:17] they were all thank you Lord for healing
[1:19:20] me
[1:19:21] nine of them went on their way
[1:19:24] and when only one came back
[1:19:28] he asked the one that came back where
[1:19:31] are the other nine
[1:19:32] they should all be here they should all
[1:19:35] be up at the altar they should all be
[1:19:37] worshiping
[1:19:39] where are the other worshipers where are
[1:19:41] the where are the others that are
[1:19:43] thankful as this one
[1:19:46] unrestricted are you going to restrict
[1:19:49] yourself and what you're going to do for
[1:19:50] God
[1:19:51] are are you going to choose to be an
[1:19:54] unrestricted servant amen
[1:19:58] all right turn with me to First
[1:20:00] Corinthians chapter 9 verse 19.
[1:20:04] you know the devil
[1:20:06] see we all think
[1:20:08] we're serving God
[1:20:13] the way that's acceptable to him
[1:20:17] the Devil is a very good artist
[1:20:20] he's a very good Craftsman
[1:20:22] he's a very good deceiver he's very good
[1:20:25] at making it look like we're doing all
[1:20:29] that we need to be doing right
[1:20:33] but I guarantee if we humble ourselves
[1:20:36] and we just say Lord what would you have
[1:20:38] me to do
[1:20:40] he will speak
[1:20:42] he will speak but what happened to the
[1:20:44] children of Israel they hardened their
[1:20:45] heart they were just so sick of hearing
[1:20:47] it
[1:20:48] we need a different Moses they don't
[1:20:51] want to hear it no more
[1:20:53] and so Paul was set free
[1:20:56] what does Paul do with his freedom
[1:20:59] First Corinthians 9 19 for though I be
[1:21:01] free from all men yet have I made myself
[1:21:06] servant unto all
[1:21:09] he made himself a servant unto all to
[1:21:13] the point though I'm free
[1:21:16] no man owes me yet I put myself under
[1:21:21] every man
[1:21:24] every man that I come in contact with
[1:21:28] why
[1:21:30] that I might gain them
[1:21:33] to the kingdom that pretty much sums up
[1:21:36] the nature of God
[1:21:39] that God would want all men to be saved
[1:21:43] the fields are white unto Harvest
[1:21:46] but the laborers are few
[1:21:50] Paul was one of those who chose to be an
[1:21:52] unrestricted servant
[1:21:55] we don't got a lot of time
[1:21:59] I met I meant for preaching this sermon
[1:22:01] brother Marty
[1:22:03] but you're right there we ain't got much
[1:22:05] time before the Lord comes
[1:22:10] together
[1:22:13] what are we going to do with our time
[1:22:17] you're free
[1:22:19] Jesus set you free
[1:22:22] what are you going to do with your
[1:22:23] freedom
[1:22:28] are you just gonna try to become
[1:22:32] a better goody goody
[1:22:35] exercise your self-righteousness
[1:22:39] just have more of God in your your life
[1:22:41] so you could build your life
[1:22:44] your desires your dreams
[1:22:47] is it
[1:22:48] on your heart today
[1:22:53] to put away everything
[1:22:56] to be a servant unto all
[1:23:00] brother Brandon gave us a glimpse that
[1:23:02] that was the definition of eternal life
[1:23:05] and to me eternal life isn't up there
[1:23:09] eternal life is living in the hearts of
[1:23:10] his people amen thank you Jesus they've
[1:23:14] done well given up their life
[1:23:17] they've they've done well surrendered
[1:23:19] their life
[1:23:21] they done well got a revelation of being
[1:23:23] bought with the price that Calvary was
[1:23:26] not just setting them free so they could
[1:23:28] go on and serve themselves without the
[1:23:30] bondage
[1:23:32] but now that they can become
[1:23:33] unrestricted Servants of Christ now I
[1:23:36] know this is a hard message I know this
[1:23:38] isn't something that makes us feel good
[1:23:40] but I'm telling you this is what God's
[1:23:43] calling today what he's calling today
[1:23:49] now here Jesus sets Paul free he's been
[1:23:52] set free because Jesus indeed set him
[1:23:55] free
[1:23:56] but he takes his freedom and He makes
[1:23:59] himself a serpent
[1:24:01] he's not called to be a servant He makes
[1:24:04] himself a servant
[1:24:07] the call was to be an apostle
[1:24:10] you know we've all been given a Ministry
[1:24:12] of reconciliation
[1:24:13] reconciling the world unto Jesus Christ
[1:24:16] letting God use our bodies to bring
[1:24:18] others to Christ
[1:24:20] and though we be free from all men we
[1:24:23] have to accept the responsibility of
[1:24:25] that
[1:24:26] too many people are calling themselves
[1:24:28] Christians
[1:24:33] and living the life that they want to
[1:24:37] live
[1:24:39] but Christians live the life that Christ
[1:24:42] wants them to live
[1:24:44] it's different
[1:24:47] I'm taking six different messages
[1:24:53] and I want to read what brother Brandon
[1:24:55] said about Christianity
[1:24:58] because it's really not
[1:25:01] about living
[1:25:03] for yourself
[1:25:05] it's just the opposite
[1:25:07] it's just the opposite
[1:25:10] God sent us a message to bring us out of
[1:25:13] ourself
[1:25:15] to set us free from the bondage of
[1:25:17] ourselves you know a lot of people have
[1:25:18] been repented they've gotten baptized
[1:25:20] but they're still in bondage
[1:25:24] they they they got right back into
[1:25:27] bondage they're not even in the same
[1:25:28] place they were when they were set free
[1:25:31] how happy they were and wanted to serve
[1:25:34] the Lord and given time for God and then
[1:25:37] they just
[1:25:39] started
[1:25:40] serving strange gods
[1:25:43] serving themselves
[1:25:46] Lord help us to shake ourselves pinch
[1:25:50] our conscience as the prophet said
[1:25:52] brother Branham said I'm not going to
[1:25:54] read all the message but I can give you
[1:25:56] a copy of this if you want it we belong
[1:25:57] to a certain certain great order
[1:26:00] we call ourselves Christians because we
[1:26:02] belong to a certain order
[1:26:05] like I'm in the message
[1:26:07] he said that's not Christianity you know
[1:26:10] Christianity is an experience
[1:26:14] and
[1:26:15] it's a life
[1:26:18] in other words it's something that it
[1:26:20] starts in your life at one time and then
[1:26:23] it continues on it becomes the life that
[1:26:25] you live
[1:26:28] thank you brother we need some more
[1:26:30] amens
[1:26:31] we really do and here's here's the thing
[1:26:35] when you say Amen it doesn't mean you
[1:26:38] know brother Brian should say like this
[1:26:39] if you can't say Amen say oh me you need
[1:26:41] to say something
[1:26:45] but if you can just enter into you know
[1:26:48] okay
[1:26:53] when
[1:26:54] you're real hungry
[1:26:57] it's easy to eat
[1:27:00] but if you had pizza three times that
[1:27:03] day and you go home for dinner and the
[1:27:06] wife says let's have pizza
[1:27:10] you're not excited about doing that
[1:27:13] right you're not you're not now here's
[1:27:16] the thing
[1:27:17] some of this word is hard to swallow I
[1:27:21] understand that I understand it
[1:27:27] but if you agree with it
[1:27:30] God will give you an appetite
[1:27:33] and then it won't feel like you have to
[1:27:35] eat pizza again
[1:27:38] so Christianity's experience and a life
[1:27:41] and these Christians was just living any
[1:27:44] kind of life
[1:27:46] making a poor example of their
[1:27:48] profession
[1:27:50] he said Christianity
[1:27:52] is a Sanctified life
[1:28:00] he said Christianity
[1:28:02] is a sacrificed life
[1:28:07] think about that
[1:28:09] it's not oh I'm a Methodist oh I'm a
[1:28:13] Baptist oh I'm a message believer
[1:28:17] it's not that
[1:28:20] it's a life of sacrificial living
[1:28:25] where you just live for others
[1:28:28] he said it's a hidden life with God
[1:28:31] through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:28:36] that's the real Christian Life consist
[1:28:39] of now of how well it's not of how well
[1:28:43] you can do this or do that or how well
[1:28:45] you can sing and say that's all right or
[1:28:47] how well you can preach he said that's
[1:28:49] fine but that isn't it amen
[1:28:52] it's a hidden life
[1:28:54] it's consecrated the Veil
[1:28:57] curtains drop around you and you're dead
[1:29:02] and you're buried and you're hidden with
[1:29:05] God through Christ and sealed there by
[1:29:07] the Holy Ghost
[1:29:10] he said Christianity
[1:29:12] is a living being in mankind
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:18] that's a proof of the resurrection of
[1:29:20] God's son who was raised with us
[1:29:25] we have so many different forms of it
[1:29:27] and we call it Christianity but there's
[1:29:28] one Christianity
[1:29:31] Christianity is not a denomination it's
[1:29:33] not a group of people Christianity is a
[1:29:35] person
[1:29:36] and that's Christ
[1:29:38] and he said you are his subjects
[1:29:44] wow you are his subjects he's connecting
[1:29:48] his resurrection power with his subjects
[1:29:56] Paul had finally surrendered his life to
[1:29:59] God
[1:30:00] and become God's subjects instead of the
[1:30:02] devil's subject
[1:30:04] and what did God do through his subject
[1:30:06] Paul he used him
[1:30:09] for his kingdom
[1:30:10] so what is he doing through his subjects
[1:30:12] today is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:30:15] today and forever amen amen amen
[1:30:18] he said how wishy-washy I've read this
[1:30:20] before but just now that I feel close
[1:30:22] and you you're just open and I don't
[1:30:24] feel resistance
[1:30:28] just tried to take this word
[1:30:31] and let it deal with you
[1:30:34] it's not a deal with he says how
[1:30:35] wishy-washy that's what too many
[1:30:37] Christians today they're so soft spot
[1:30:41] soft soaked and everything until they
[1:30:44] think all they have to do is join a
[1:30:46] church
[1:30:47] go in somewhere put their name on the
[1:30:50] book a little something jump up and down
[1:30:52] shout something like that and call it
[1:30:55] Christianity
[1:30:57] he said Christianity is an everyday
[1:31:00] rugged life living for God in this
[1:31:04] present world not back then it's a
[1:31:07] constant burning of the fire and the
[1:31:09] love of God in the heart
[1:31:12] don't tell me that you're a Christian
[1:31:15] let me see that love let me see you just
[1:31:18] living for others
[1:31:21] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[1:31:24] the love of God in the heart that sets
[1:31:25] you a fire and put you out yonder with
[1:31:27] people making converts to Christ
[1:31:30] and then he says responsibilities
[1:31:33] responsibility he says this is a
[1:31:36] responsibility
[1:31:37] it's a choice we have to make
[1:31:40] he says but it's easy to go the way the
[1:31:43] world goes
[1:31:44] well the world just wants to take a back
[1:31:45] seat
[1:31:47] he says it's easy to flow down the
[1:31:49] stream you go out there and you sit down
[1:31:50] the river with your boat you get your
[1:31:52] oars and start pulling up against the
[1:31:54] current you don't make much time but it
[1:31:56] goes and it goes hard but you just once
[1:31:59] let your oars out of the water and watch
[1:32:02] how fast the trees going by but look
[1:32:07] where you're going
[1:32:09] you ever just wanted to just take it
[1:32:11] easy not read not pray
[1:32:14] not listen to a tate not go to church I
[1:32:18] need a break
[1:32:21] and then you just decide to choose to do
[1:32:24] that
[1:32:26] and then after a while you just feel so
[1:32:28] puny
[1:32:32] because you've allowed
[1:32:35] the nature of
[1:32:37] the old nature
[1:32:39] to have preeminence just feeding
[1:32:41] basically you're not feeding the white
[1:32:44] dog anymore
[1:32:49] he says when things are floating easy
[1:32:50] remember you're going towards a great
[1:32:52] cataract down there
[1:32:54] of some sort
[1:32:56] you're going towards the falls and it
[1:32:58] won't be long
[1:33:00] uh you'll be going over the falls just
[1:33:03] floating with the world easy as as
[1:33:06] the way that it goes you don't want to
[1:33:07] do that he says no sir he says but you
[1:33:10] must accept your responsibility
[1:33:15] you must accept your responsibility
[1:33:19] now you believe it
[1:33:22] says you believe it it's the truth
[1:33:24] I want to say I'm just going to get this
[1:33:27] thought I'm going to say it and I know
[1:33:28] I'm I'm overboard and I got pages to go
[1:33:31] but
[1:33:32] it's so good to God bless you brother
[1:33:34] it's Welcome to our church I hope that
[1:33:37] this doesn't scare you please come back
[1:33:38] when somebody else is preaching
[1:33:42] it's so so good to see brother Orlando
[1:33:45] up up towards the front here I just feel
[1:33:48] I got a closer amen it's good to see
[1:33:51] sister Bertha with us it's been a while
[1:33:54] God God bless you
[1:33:56] talking about responsibility you must
[1:33:58] accept he says now the responsibility
[1:34:00] that God has given us in this day
[1:34:04] is to bring this message
[1:34:06] and as I get older
[1:34:08] and I know my days are shortening up I
[1:34:11] feel I feel a great a responsibility
[1:34:15] greater than I ever had now think about
[1:34:17] that
[1:34:19] we
[1:34:22] how many times have we felt
[1:34:25] less of a responsibility
[1:34:27] I don't need to do that
[1:34:30] I don't feel like doing that it's not my
[1:34:33] calling
[1:34:35] but this is the Holy Ghost talking amen
[1:34:39] as I get older and I know my days are
[1:34:41] short and I feel the responsibility
[1:34:43] grade that I've ever felt pressing on we
[1:34:46] must do it we must get down to it and
[1:34:50] everywhere we go and tell the message
[1:34:52] tell the people that Jesus is coming
[1:34:55] Hallelujah
[1:34:57] and he is God and he's coming soon
[1:35:01] there's not a hope left in the world but
[1:35:03] the coming of the Lord
[1:35:08] now that's the responsibility
[1:35:11] that we need
[1:35:13] to be up and about with
[1:35:18] a man born and filled with the Holy
[1:35:21] Ghost
[1:35:23] serves
[1:35:26] that's just all there is to it if the
[1:35:28] spirit of Beethoven Lives in you you'll
[1:35:30] play like Beethoven
[1:35:32] if the spirit of rimbat lives in you
[1:35:34] you'll paint like Rembrandt and if the
[1:35:37] spirit of Christ lives in you you will
[1:35:38] serve
[1:35:41] he brings his body under subjection to
[1:35:45] serve he doesn't serve himself he
[1:35:48] doesn't serve when it's convenient he
[1:35:49] doesn't serve his favorite friends his
[1:35:51] closest brothers and sisters or he
[1:35:53] doesn't just focus on his family
[1:35:57] he's unrestricted
[1:36:00] he's an unrestricted servant to serve
[1:36:02] all men
[1:36:03] we don't want to make Christianity what
[1:36:05] we want to make it we want to present
[1:36:07] ourselves a Living Sacrifice unto the
[1:36:09] Lord
[1:36:12] the holy ghost in a real Christian will
[1:36:14] subject himself to serve everyone with
[1:36:18] the purpose of getting them closer to
[1:36:20] God
[1:36:21] because God's given him a Ministry of
[1:36:23] reconciliation
[1:36:26] I hope you see what I'm trying to tell
[1:36:28] you today
[1:36:29] we don't have time
[1:36:31] well I'm going to try to do it you mind
[1:36:33] if I take a little bit extra time it's
[1:36:35] an hour it's been an hour okay
[1:36:39] I want to read this real quick First
[1:36:40] Corinthians 9 19 for though I be free
[1:36:42] from all men yet have I made myself
[1:36:44] servant unto all that I might gain them
[1:36:46] more and unto the Jew I became a Jew
[1:36:48] that I might gain the Jews to them that
[1:36:51] are under the law verse 21 to them that
[1:36:53] are without the law as without the law
[1:36:56] 20 verse 22 or that was 21 22 to the
[1:37:00] week became I is weak that I might gain
[1:37:02] the week I am made all things to all men
[1:37:05] that I might by all means
[1:37:07] save some of them
[1:37:10] he knew he wasn't going to get them all
[1:37:12] he knew others think about even even he
[1:37:15] said he had to deal with false brethren
[1:37:17] in the churches
[1:37:20] I mean God knows who's who but I'm just
[1:37:23] saying we need to serve everybody
[1:37:26] and this I do for the gospel's sake that
[1:37:28] I might be partakers thereof with you
[1:37:30] know ye therefore that they which run in
[1:37:32] a race run all but one receive at the
[1:37:34] price so run that ye may obtain
[1:37:37] so he's talking about a race here and
[1:37:39] this race is between his natural carnal
[1:37:43] nature and the the new man
[1:37:48] and it's a race that you're with and if
[1:37:52] you yield yourself servant unto just you
[1:37:54] kind of want to do your own thing
[1:37:56] you're not going to save very many
[1:37:58] people
[1:38:01] but if you bring that thing under
[1:38:02] subjection you let God have his way
[1:38:05] God will use you because God we heard
[1:38:08] the prophet say God could just turn the
[1:38:10] world upside down with one man
[1:38:12] we just got to give more to God Amen
[1:38:16] now Jesus was our example
[1:38:22] he was our example how many times have
[1:38:24] you heard that you never want to be in a
[1:38:25] church where the church says Jesus was
[1:38:27] not your example he was our example he
[1:38:30] was the example of being the father's
[1:38:32] unrestricted servant
[1:38:36] we know that he did only those things
[1:38:38] that pleased the father
[1:38:40] he was the father's servant to all and
[1:38:42] he gave his life for all men
[1:38:45] one time he the father told him to go
[1:38:47] down to Samaria and he told his
[1:38:49] disciples I must means go by Samaria and
[1:38:52] he just went
[1:38:53] he was unrestricted and there was a
[1:38:56] woman there at the well who just he
[1:38:59] didn't she didn't have a very good life
[1:39:05] but he was an unrestricted servant amen
[1:39:07] and he went there and he gave her life
[1:39:09] there was a a time where
[1:39:11] um
[1:39:12] there was a woman caught an adultery
[1:39:16] and uh
[1:39:18] he helped her
[1:39:20] and I'll tell you there's a room full of
[1:39:22] people that God has helped
[1:39:24] right here
[1:39:26] because he was an unrestricted servant
[1:39:30] and it's not a big thing that he has
[1:39:33] called us
[1:39:35] to be on restricted servants
[1:39:37] turn with me this is going to be our
[1:39:39] last set of scriptures here in Saint
[1:39:41] John chapter 13.
[1:39:47] so here is
[1:39:49] uh uh the time that he was in the the
[1:39:52] upper room and we all know the story to
[1:39:57] where uh
[1:39:58] he got his disciples and he he had bread
[1:40:02] communion with him but he also washed
[1:40:05] their feet right
[1:40:07] Andy verse 5 we'll pick it up and after
[1:40:09] that he he poureth water into a base and
[1:40:11] began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:40:13] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:40:15] was girded and cometh to Simon Peter and
[1:40:17] him not really knowing what's going on
[1:40:19] he says did thou wash my feet
[1:40:22] and Jesus answered them what I do thou
[1:40:25] knowest not but you're going to know and
[1:40:28] Peter saith unto him thou shall never
[1:40:29] wash my feet you know what I am taking
[1:40:32] control of this situation Jesus answered
[1:40:35] if I don't wash your feet you don't know
[1:40:36] you don't even part with me
[1:40:40] if we don't let Jesus cleanse us from
[1:40:42] our daily sins
[1:40:47] we don't have no part with them
[1:40:50] we need him
[1:40:52] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[1:40:54] feet only but also my hands in my head
[1:40:56] and Jesus saith on him he that is washed
[1:40:59] deedeth not saved to wash his uh his
[1:41:02] feet but is clean everywhere and you're
[1:41:04] clean but not all
[1:41:06] if Ray knew who should betray him
[1:41:08] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:41:11] so after that he had washed their feet
[1:41:13] and taken His Garment and sat down again
[1:41:15] he said unto them know ye what I have
[1:41:17] done unto you
[1:41:19] hmm I came to church
[1:41:22] something was preached
[1:41:24] I'm just trying to figure this thing out
[1:41:27] he says you call me master and Lord
[1:41:30] and you say well for so I am
[1:41:33] you got that right
[1:41:35] if I then your lord and your master
[1:41:38] has washed your feet you also ought to
[1:41:40] wash one another's feet
[1:41:43] for I have given you an example that you
[1:41:46] should do as I've done unto you he was
[1:41:49] an unrestricted servant
[1:41:52] because you know whose feet he washed
[1:41:56] he was judas's feet amen
[1:42:00] he didn't say you know what they did me
[1:42:02] harm I don't want to talk to them
[1:42:07] what a spirit
[1:42:09] how is that going to get in heaven
[1:42:12] how is that going to get in heaven
[1:42:17] Jesus did not just allow Judas in the
[1:42:20] church
[1:42:21] he chose him
[1:42:23] to be a disciple
[1:42:25] to work the ministry with him
[1:42:30] to show that God is not a respecter of
[1:42:33] persons
[1:42:35] that he loves everybody he's an
[1:42:38] unrestricted servant and he says to his
[1:42:40] disciples I am the example I've given
[1:42:43] you example
[1:42:46] you
[1:42:46] ought to wash one another's feet
[1:42:50] sometimes we get so caught up in our
[1:42:52] life we don't even care about one
[1:42:54] another's problems
[1:42:57] we're not even looking at the need
[1:43:00] in fact when we see a needs sometimes we
[1:43:03] get we want a 10-foot Pole
[1:43:06] make sure we stay away from them
[1:43:10] I just wonder is that the Holy Ghost is
[1:43:13] the Holy Ghost having preeminence in
[1:43:15] their life
[1:43:17] no let's stand together I don't want to
[1:43:20] steal your time because I want to give
[1:43:22] you some time if you want to seek the
[1:43:23] Lord I want this altar to be open
[1:43:36] praise the Lord Saints He's Worthy
[1:43:40] He's Worthy
[1:43:44] now we have not presented
[1:43:46] to you another gospel
[1:43:50] this is not even the John Martin version
[1:43:53] this is just the gospel
[1:43:57] is one Satan doesn't want us to hear
[1:44:01] and think about this the weakest
[1:44:04] Christian on his needs the devil
[1:44:06] trembles
[1:44:09] because there's a surrendered life going
[1:44:12] on
[1:44:15] I just want us to take the time don't
[1:44:18] leave this service
[1:44:20] without making a commitment to God
[1:44:24] don't come hear the word
[1:44:26] but want to be a doer of the word
[1:44:29] whatever he speaks to you
[1:44:32] just walk in that light
[1:44:34] I have no Greater Joy than to hear my
[1:44:37] children walk in truth
[1:44:39] God is calling us but we must accept our
[1:44:42] responsibility
[1:44:43] to make yourself not a restricted
[1:44:46] servant anymore but an unrestricted for
[1:44:50] the glory and the honor of god let's
