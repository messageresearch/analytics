and know that uh many of us would not be here if it had not been for the lord using our brother and and calling us to jesus christ and we just we can never ever forget that amen who we're attached to brother branham said it like this that that soul will forever be attached to us in heavens there will always be a connection there and i believe it will be by the is the spoken word of god when god calls us to him become born again by god we're just new creatures and we're eternal creatures and uh we're forever be attached to those amen and i can't hardly wait the bible says that they that win souls though shine as the stars in heaven and i just i can't wait to see brother johnson's crown sister johnson's crown who stood next to him and while he went overseas so many times and and labored and um as much as i know brother johnson i probably i only know maybe like three percent of all the people that he's attached to and i can't wait to just see the other 97 as it were uh but he has done a great work uh for the lord and just to know that sister johnson has been so faithful to brother johnson all these years we just are so thankful to have them as examples amen great examples for every single believer amen well praise the lord um we had a a a wonderful turnout with our young people yesterday we had almost 30 almost 30 and in brother um aaron mcgeary did such a a tremendous job with with the message um and the the the real theme was just getting getting down to business about obeying our parents as a serious business and he preached it so well that i wish my mom and dad were alive so i could just be obedient to him and i just appreciated the message so much and i walked out there just wishing i had someone to be obedient to he did such a wonderful job and i believe i believe you guys will never forget that message amen and brother jeremiah he just did an outstanding job he didn't do a good job he did an outstanding job leading the worship i mean praise the lord we know there's something special there inside him amen i believe the lord's going to use him amen well let's stand together we uh have such a great love and respect for brother aaron mcgeary he has been a a true friend a faithful friend and greater than that he has stayed true to the word of god he loves the word and uh he he trusts the lord and uh how many want to send greetings back to his church it's arizona believers church abc abc god is hidden in simplicity and uh i just want us to take our greetings back to him because it was a lot for the sacrifice being a new pastor and the work has just started there but it has blossomed so quickly and uh and it's a real lighthouse because people that have gone through a lot have found a place of refuge there amen and and the family has just embraced them and uh we just appreciate the work that uh god is doing through them there and they left family like abraham and they sojourn and wasn't sure where they're going to end up but god has truly been with them and is blessing them and we're grateful they they i feel in arizona they need a lighthouse there they really do amen well how many has come expecting the word amen amen this is such a precious time the lord is here i'm we've all felt his presence and i'll say we want the word to come into our hearts to not just stay in our mind but to come inside of us so that we can leave here just to change person so let's believe with our heart as we sing only believe as our brother comes to minister the word of life only believe all things are possible only believe only believe [Music] only believe all things are possible only believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe amen praise the lord if you can grab your bibles we're going to be reading from genesis 22. i appreciate the worship and just all the praise that was given to the lord very very happy to be here and as we'll be bringing greetings back from you all i bring greetings to you from arizona believer's church there in phoenix and from the believers all over arizona and flagstaff and prescott uh in tucson and phoenix area we just bring our greetings to you and uh we are very grateful uh and thankful for your prayers and support as a church you've been tremendously supportive of elizabeth and i and i believe it's not just because we're related uh to your pastor but it's just a real kinship with you and i know even my wife served in the beginning at this church uh and um and was just real instrumental in supporting her her pastor and her father and then you guys in turn have just been super supportive of her and our family and for us and so as a church um as a person and us as a church you've been very supportive to us in phoenix and uh we're grateful for that and brother john you've been a real a real friend and a real support to us and we're grateful for all that you've done and we're rejoicing in the goodness of god in what lord's done here um it's uh yesterday at the youth meeting we had young people sitting here young people sitting there and young people sitting here and for the f really for the first time ever i can kind of do this while i'm preaching it's in the light it used to just be like the shotgun you know and there's more i mentioned it wednesday i said there's so many cars in the parking lot that weren't for sale and it just is so awesome to see what god has done and god grow the body and not just in numbers but in um in service identifying gifts people supporting and stepping up and there could be a lot of newness to a building you get a new building a lot of people get motivated to help and do things and what you do is you forget that drive and enthusiasm and things kind of start slipping and then it gets right back to where 20 of the people are doing 100 of the work or 80 of the work however that works out whatever the math is uh but uh i'll just share this i don't know why i'm going down this path nobody's offered to pay me if you do um certainly open to that bro john but um when i i've learned this that there's times that god puts a burden on someone's heart and when that happens you've got to do it you absolutely have to do it that's a burden that everyone must bear their own burden that's laid upon you and you've got to do it and some of you felt that and you step in and do it but then it says that bear you one another's burdens and those are burdens you have to take on and so you may not have a burden to do something here at the church but if you see something that needs to be done take it on take that burden on and stay faithful with it labor in it because it's you can't even begin to describe just how much god will bless you when you serve other people it's the only source of true happiness and it's the only it's the only true eternal life is when you live for others and so we're rejoicing with what god has done here the beautiful building the beautiful congregation just the new converts the new families it's just wonderful very very wonderful to see everything and we're grateful personally for the martin family for sister cheryl and brother john we consider a mom and dad and i love their testimony and example and i'm very very happy to be here and then also i guess to say that um we had a celebrated anniversary this past week 21 years ago we ministered for the first time at this church and to see it continue it's just been a real honor and privilege to be able to minister here for so long and we said god bless you to you sister johnson happy 96th birthday that's wonderful what an honor to be able to honor one of god's servants nice to be here for that and then brother joshua i think you drove the furthest today to be in service or drove up from new albany indiana last night just to be in service today with joshua and his wife and children god bless you hopefully after service we'll have a chance to shake your hand but may the lord bless them genesis chapter 22. i'm going to read verses 1 to 14. i have a whole bunch that i want to minister on and i figure i got to make it worth it for brother joshua when you drive five and a half hours you don't want to preach a sermonette for somebody who's that hungry for the word and so genesis chapter 22 verses 1 to 14 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am. and he said take now thy son thy only son isaac whom thou lovest and get the end of the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of now doesn't that sound like when he first called him going to a place that i'm not going to tell you now but i'll tell you later he's doing the same thing now in genesis chapter 22 and later on in his life so many years later he's saying i want you to go and i'll tell you later which mountain you're going to and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went under the place which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here i am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where's the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told them of and abraham built an altar there laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel lord called unto him out of the heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for now i know that thou fierst god seen thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up a burnt offering instead of his son and abraham called the name of that that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen that's what jehovah jairu means the god who sees amen let's pray heavenly father as we've read this story it's just moving knowing that this is real it's not an allegory it's not a mythology it's not a fairy tale it's real and lord what an extraordinary event on mount moriah that abraham would take his son isaac and offer him up as a sacrifice and there you lord said i see jehovah jireh the god who sees and you saw his faith and you held that hand and you provided a sacrifice lord i pray today as we speak on the supreme faith of abraham and our own supreme faith i pray that you'd be present with us to guide us through these scriptures and these quotations that your people would be supremely blessed we commit this to you in the name lord jesus christ amen and then you can be seated i have a whole bunch i want to get through we trust by god's grace we'll be able to do it i told brother john if i don't finish i'll cut my vacation short and come back wednesday night uh so lord willing i'll finish but wednesday and i don't really have much time to kind of recapture where we were wednesday and i'm so grateful for that opportunity to kind of lay a lot of the foundational points on abraham and how he initially started out falling following god just by that command not knowing where he was going to go and we're wanting to take the example of abraham to show that even our own supreme faith will come by daily acts of faith bill abraham said that the rapture will be the same way just those acts of faith of starting your car and going to meet somebody for lunch that just that regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god is what's going to build our faith to rapturing faith and i've and i've that's quote has been so uh personal to me and so real to me for so the last couple years that uh it's becoming more and more of a reality that we're not i'm not looking for a great convention i'm not looking for a great convention speaker i believe the message has been delivered to us in its completeness and its fullness and it's a matter of just feeding on that word of god and living that word of god in its simplicity and that's what's going to bring forth this rapturing faith for the bride and then as we believe then the signs and wonders follow the believers and there's all sorts of manifestations and gifts that god has placed within the body of christ to encourage our faith and grow our faith but we know that in the end it's going to be that only believe in the word of god that's going to produce that rapturing faith and we've chosen abraham and we're not going to be able to do anything exhaustive on his life but abraham is a legend when it comes to faith he's the father of faith father of over 4 billion believers in the world today whether it be muslims or jews or christians they look to abraham as the father of their faith their conviction and their belief and i believe that as you examine abraham's life he's much more relatable than we might think he is and so hopefully today just at different points if god could quicken it uh just identify just how relatable his faith is to our own faith and as we were touching on wednesday we might not have done as good a job as we hoped to that abraham believed in a god that was personally revealed to him it wasn't taken his dad's word or his brothers or his nephews he wasn't taking the word of anybody else in babylon because nobody else knew this god it was the one god that he revealed himself to abraham and because god revealed himself to abraham and then isaac and jacob he became known as the god of abraham isaac and jacob because he singularly had revealed himself to abraham and to isaac and to jacob and so that was that was the simple pure faith of abraham is to believe the god that made himself known to them and the statement that brother bannon makes in the masterpiece as he started in abraham after the fall of the first masterpiece he started in abraham on a foundation to build another masterpiece so after mankind fell in genesis 3 15 god prophesies of the seed that will come and crush the serpent's head and that's a prophecy of christ and god does not begin to build that back until genesis chapter 12 and the lord said unto abraham said unto abram and when god called abram that's when god began to build another masterpiece so abraham is the foundation of jesus christ he's the foundation of this another masterpiece christ is the capstone to that foundation the capstone to that masterpiece the capstone to the jewish church ages and so brother brown recognizes abraham as that foundation so that's going to determine the extent of it this is this is the foundation of this masterpiece christ comes as the culmination of it and then brother adam said there's another masterpiece in the making so there's going to be another culmination there's another masterpiece to come forth and that is who the bride is she is the capstone to the church ages uh in her union with jesus christ and so we are then following in that same pattern as god built up from abraham to christ we're following in the same pattern now we've read genesis chapter 22 in james chapter 2 verses 21 and 22 james writes this about these very works of abraham he says was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar brother braham takes this and looks at it in such a simple view and paul says you're justified by faith he said that's what god sees that's all god needs to see is your faith to know that you believe but then he says that the works of abraham when james said that his works justified him that was what was manifest in what was visible for others to see and so was not abraham our father justified by works when you'd offered isaac his son upon the altar and he asked a question but he's basically saying it was it's called the rhetorical question where the answer is assumed see is thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect by his works his faith was made perfect it reached fully consummated development it couldn't go any further it attained the very word there faith made perfect it's the supreme expression of his faith he had attained to it he had manifested he'd reached that pinnacle and that climax of his faith and so faith was made perfect through that act it was demonstrated and manifested on that mount moriah that this was perfect faith this was supreme faith on that mountain and so i'm asking the question what is it about this act that justified abraham's faith what is it on mount moriah when he took his son and was offering up as a sacrifice that demonstrated perfect faith how is this act supreme faith and when brother branham makes this statement and god is identified by his characteristics he says one day god saw or one day when god had seen his servant was determined to be an example for people of today so he had set him forth god had determined and set him forth to be an example for the people today and when he saw that abraham's determination had matched god's determination when he had seen that he puts them in this calls them to this place to demonstrate on mount moriah supreme faith and so what expresses as he says he was to be an example for people today what expresses the example of faith for the bride in the last days how is this and i'm wanting you just to think about this how does this embody brought the bride's faith and i'll say this at the outset that what abraham went through in his life was a process of faith coming to perfect faith and he didn't fully recognize that faith or realize that faith on day one could you imagine if there in her in um in ur of the chaldees he woke up one morning and a voice said to him i want you to go take your nephew lot and kill him or if you had a son god speaks to him says it says i want you go ahead and take your son over there and crucify him and and slaughter him on the rocks he'd be considered a murderer a madman listening to voices a psychopath he'd have no basis to believe he had no reason this would be no other than just some other premonition or idea coming to his head but that's not how god dealt with abraham he didn't knock on his tent door and say hey i want you to kill your son your only son he's like hey i don't have a son well then let me give you one so you can kill him that's not how god dealt with abraham but god was faithful to reveal himself to abraham constantly until supreme faith was realized he started with him on a particular basis and was the genesis the author of abraham's faith he's what cultivated and brought it up and abraham began to believe in something beyond himself something that nobody else believed and he believed it and he filed it despite whatever the stigma might have been and abraham's life is such an incredible testimony to the true god and so it's a it was something that god was faithful to do now i want to begin in genesis chapter 17 to look at one of these examples of when god revealed himself to abraham verses three to eight and how that god is appearing to abraham to build give him what he needs to come to the supreme faith and it says in verse 3 of genesis 17 and abram fell on his faith and i referred to him as abraham we know his name was changed from abram to abraham and so now having that name change we just refer to him as abraham hope that doesn't stumble anybody but and abram fell on his faith and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations and this would echo the sentiments that god had already expressed to him i'd make your name great and you shall be the father of nations and and all families of the earth will be blessed and so he said i'll make of you a great nation so this is echoing in these things he says i'll make thou shall be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be called abraham so it's going from father to father of many for father many nations have i made thee and i will make the exceeding fruitful remember our introduction to sarah in genesis 11. she was barren and they had no children so he's telling him something that seems to be impossible or at least had not yet manifested itself through these many years i'll make you exceeding fruitful and i'll make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and notice this in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and thy seed after thee and i'll give unto thee and thy seed after thee the land we're in thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god notice the language that god is using to abraham everlasting covenant everlasting possession this is ever enduring this is eternal and i will be a god to you forever genesis chapter 13 verse 15. for the land which thou seest to give to to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever it'll eternally stand as your possession now think about what god is telling abraham abraham i will be your god forever your seed after you will possess this land forever this is an eternal covenant this is an everlasting possession he's talking to him in a language ever enduring eternal persisting perpetual in perpetuity this is going to be yours and genesis chapter 21 verse 33 and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god he said i will be a god unto thee forever i'm going to be an eternal god in this genesis chapter 21 i just recently did a series of sermons at our home church on our family tree and this scripture was uh the the inspiration for that because abraham planted an oasis he planted a grove and it wasn't that he just planted a tree but he planted something that was pre implanting it he's being proactive because you plant a tree that grows so that in the future can provide fruit or shade and so it wasn't a selfish act and when it says that he planted this grove it was a place of worship and there he invoked the name of the everlasting god and in to the hebrew it was a place of hospitality so that strangers would pass by and people would travel they would see this grove they'd see this oasis and abraham would invite them in and he would minister to them and give them rest and give them lodging and give them water and give them food and he would minister to them and when they would want to give thanks to abraham he would say no jehovah is the one who provided this give thanks to jehovah give thanks to the one true god and so he evoked the name of god by hospitality evoked the name of god by service and he declared the character of god how he ministered to the stranger the unbeliever who came by that grove what a beautiful picture of the church and so this is the seed of abraham's faith genesis 13 i'll give it to you forever you'll i will bless thee forever this is an everlasting covenant this is an everlasting possession and abraham begins to recognize this we see in genesis 21 he's coming to this place where he says this is after isaac is born he said this is the everlasting god and this here as i sow this seed in the beginning this really is the seed of faith holds the key of supreme faith because this is what god is wanting to give to energize abraham's faith and abraham's faith though he was earthbound he was born of a woman and he lived in physically there in the middle east and he had a family had a wife he had a lineage everything was natural but he was not bound we i didn't recognize that abraham begins to live beyond his flesh he's not constrained by natural dimensions he's not bound by natural time he's not uh he's not uh held back even by his physical physical flesh his faith transcends now his physical experience and in romans chapter 4 verse 17 and i believe we'll probably come back to this it says and as it is written i have made the father of many nations before him who he believed even god now notice this designation this is what abraham believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were now what's amazing about this statement is that's an attribute of god who can call things that are not and make them so it's an attribute of god to call those things which be not as though they were but this also becomes the attribute of abraham who despite not being able to see it could speak it and believe it as though it was and so any he when he says he believed even god before him whom he believed god a god who's designated as the quickener of the dead and so abraham's actions in genesis chapter 22 were testimony as this is the revelation he has of god it was a testimony of his revelation of the nature of god when abraham is acting in genesis 22 it's the culmination of how god through a period of time made himself known to abraham and gave him a basis to believe in god in his attributes and his characteristics and his love and his concern and what his promises were and so it was a testimony of the character of god who had revealed himself to him through time it says here the god who quickens the dead or gives life to the dead and in this testimony that paul's writing he's testifying of isaac and of christ god that quickeneth the dead this is a this is uh the emphasis abrahams understanding this is a god that quickens the dead and as paul is writing he refers to isaac but he's also referred to christ and so abraham was willing to offer isaac his only son because of an understanding of the god he believed in and that's important because we have faith and that faith is in a god we believe that he is but there's this the real evidence of the holy ghost is as is when the holy ghost brings a clear understanding not of someone's doctrines or someone's opinions or a clear understanding of history but an understanding of god and his nature and his character that's what the word is to reveal is the nature of god to us and so it was an understanding of the god he believed in and he had this faith and i'm i'm kind of given it i'm not giving it away but i'm not maybe i'm not building to a great climax i'm already hitting it here at the outset but he had faith this is where abraham's faith was he had faith that god could bypass death or raise up isaac from it this is this is what this is abraham's faith is he's god god is he came to this place to based upon what god has told me if god's word is true and he's proven himself to be true he told me i'd have a son and i had a son and if he fulfilled that what about all the other promises that he gave me then can i not believe the simple word that he said to me when he said he'd be a god forever and this would be an everlasting possession and so the promise was from god himself this is what the bible said the promise was from god himself who makes the dead live again that's abraham's faith this god the one who can make the dead to live again is the one who gave me the promise so abraham was asked to believe something that was beyond nature something beyond himself and he knew i can't repair isaac i can't raise isaac up this is nothing i can do so he had to come to a place where he was totally dependent upon god if god had asked abraham to travel to to canaan abraham could do that if abraham asked god to build an altar abraham could do it abraham was also very obviously very industrious very skilled leader and whether it be the result of certain things that god had gifted him with or just naturally had these inclinations but he was able to rally his servants and to go chase after kings and rescue his his nephew lot and so there were certain things about abraham that were certainly tremendous but abraham finally came to a place where he realized this is something i can't do i got to trust god alone and we'll back up and kind of go through these instances in his life where this is what abraham is coming to so the vision that abraham had related to something that was beyond this life and in that way that's how he's that true hebrew one who has crossed over his faith he left the natural realm was living in a faith realm abraham was still there and even that land was given him as an everlasting covenant and everlasting possession abraham was called a foreigner or a stranger in the land that he possessed and the reason why is because he was no longer living in that land he was living in a faith realm he was there but he really wasn't there because something had crossed over and transcended natural life and so abraham was a foreigner right there in his own land because he was no longer living solely by natural things his faith had moved beyond the flesh his faith had moved beyond what was visible his faith had moved beyond what was capable of man and he was believing in a god even to a point where abraham was looking for a city whose builder and maker was god a city that had foundations that was eternal and permanent amen so abraham's faith catch this in the beginning his faith was directed towards god's power of life to give life his power either to preserve life or to raise it up and it was part of abraham recognizing the eternal nature of god's promise so we already read it in genesis chapter 17 genesis 13 and even as he declared it in genesis 21 abraham saying recognizing god said he would be a god unto me forever how can he be a god to me forever if i don't live forever how can this land be an everlasting covenant and an everlasting possession if me and my seed cease to exist so there was something about the word that already been given that he believed that begin to kind of marinate if we could say that and be evolved and the an evolution of this revelation and it begins to step forward and be like i've always believed this i've always believed this i've always believed this always believe this and you begin to realize just how big it was and listen that's exactly what this message is to each one of us we believed it in its simplicity we accepted it we could didn't really have a choice in it we were ordained to it and we loved it and we fed on it and then we began to realize the very things we believed in the beginning were so much larger and bigger than we could have ever imagined but yet we can say that's what i believed because it's the power in the seed and that's what abraham is faith was in an eternal promise as it says in romans chapter 4 verses 19 to 21 and being not weak in faith catch this revelation of what uh abraham is walking into so beautiful and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief so if he staggered it wasn't through unbelief in god he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and what paul does now and i think maybe some of you have already you've already jumped maybe to the end of where i'm going so if you if you have just get all the giddy and excited and pull on me i often tell people that the louder you a man and the harder you pull the faster i preach and all of a sudden like all the teenagers are like hey remember there come on come on you can do this but no if you're with me you'll help me just pull me deeper into the word and we'll enjoy this but he says and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform in paul takes his faith and his conviction in god and he takes death and he puts it right next to it and he wants to take abraham's faith and position it against death because he says abraham believed god and was not weak in faith and considered a dead body and a dead womb so he's taken his faith and he positions his faith against death and this is what abraham's faith began to come up against is this idea that my body is dead that my wife's uh womb is dead and he brought his faith right up against death to face death and this is what abraham triumphs over when he believes that god is able to raise up isaac in genesis chapter 22 verse 4. abraham is told in genesis 22 he says go and i want you to go to the land of moriah to a mountain i'll show you later so it's in the very pattern how god called them in the beginning in the very end abraham's walking by faith to a mountain that god will show them and it says he rose up early in the morning and he begins to travel in verse 4 it says then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes it's on the third day that he lifts up his eyes and sees the place that he's got to go it's on the third day that he takes isaac on top of mount moriah and it's on the third day the resurrection day that jehovah jireh provides a sacrifice and it's a resurrection of isaac by this ram that is caught in the thicket and he's demonstrating this on the third day just as christ would resurrect on the third day even abraham's life he's demonstrating foreshadowing how the sacrifice god will provide himself in his son christ as a sacrifice and this is how brother branham treats this in jehovah jireh he says then he and let them know that you provided a resurrection this is what he's uh is he saying it i could just say it this way you speaking of god you provided a resurrection in form there for isaac who had come to the end of his road but you provided a way for him what did god provide on that third day a resurrection for isaac in hebrews chapter 11 verses 17 18 and 19. notice exactly where the scriptures are placed in abraham's faith by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten son so he wasn't just offering him up on a whim but he was one who was built upon these great promises through the revelation of the word of god he was built up to this place where when he was asked to sacrifice his son he's the one who had received the promises so it wasn't an offering without a basis it wasn't an offering without a foundation and we can't just pretend to be religious and do all sorts of religious acts and say that we're operating the faith of abraham if it doesn't report back to god's word if it's not based upon the word of god that's been given to us because abraham was acting on the word of god one who had received the promises and listen to what it says it's so beautiful that he offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called so he takes his son and is offering up as a sacrifice let's just be real blunt he's going to kill his son he's going to die he's going to cease to be ceased to exist and he says this is the one through which your seed is going to be called so it means abraham has no children he finally he has isaac his son of sarah and then through him god has told him more seeds are going to come to the place where there's going to be kings there's going to be nations and abraham is being asked to kill the sun through which the rest of the seed is going to come so verse 19. this is abraham's faith accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure paul is telling us that abraham believed he'd come to a place where he was absolutely convinced and fully persuaded that he that promised that isaac would birth kings and birth nations he believed that god was able to resurrect isaac from the dead and how can he believe that he had already witnessed life over death his body been dead sarah's womb been dead god had already demonstrated something to him to give him a reason to believe that if i could resurrect a woman if i could resurrect your body then can't you believe me that i can resurrect your son isaac this is the progressive revelation of abraham from faith to supreme faith he came to a place where he said wait a minute god wants me to kill him but he also told me he was going to give birth to kings that means god this is the revelation that means god's got to resurrect him that means god is greater than death that means god i am going to witness the resurrection i'm going to kill my son and god's going to raise him right back up again amen amen in my redeemer liveth brother braham said abraham said i've had the same kind of vision we're up yonder on the mountain when christ god met me listen to that god met me and christ gave me his redemptive names as jehovah jireh jehovah rapha and all those things seeing the death burial and resurrection so what was it that abraham saw what did god show him he showed him death burial and resurrection this is abraham's faith this is his revelation again in the sermon my redeemer liveth he says i laid him on the altar he was going to take his own life knowing abraham's testimony knowing that i had received him as one from the dead i believe that he would raise him up again and through this great hope that beats in my heart i know he said he could raise him up brother bram says it was a foresight of the resurrection abraham's revelation now if you could catch this abraham's revelation just it had grown from believing that god who called him would bring him to a place that he would show them thereafter he says the same god that called me showed me this is where i'm going to be they're saying god that told me i'd have a son gave me a son it matures to where he has a revelation of the rapture he has a resurrect a revelation of the resurrection he came to a place where he had a vision of the rapture he says the same thing that job had where job said for i know that my redeemer liveth job 19 and he shall the redeemer shall stand at the latter day upon the earth brother iran said that god met him christ revealed himself as jehovah jabber jehovah rapha he saw death burial and resurrection job sees my redeemer liveth and he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroyed this body what does he say yet in my flesh shall i see god so abram job wasn't just testifying well i know there's an eternal god and he's going to live forever and and he'll forever reign and this will be an everlasting covenant for him and this is god's promise and god's word is true and job just didn't testify in the end the redeemer's going to live but he said my redeemer liveth and therefore since he's my redeemer he's going to stand in the last days and i will be there with him because he's going to redeem me from the pit he's going to redeem me from the grave even if this body be destroyed the power of god is going to bring it back together and i'll stand eternally with my redeemer that's the same revelation that abraham had before sight of the resurrection brotherhood said about job he saw the coming of the lord he saw the manifestation and the power of god over death is that not what the transfiguration represents and he said they took him up on a mountain set apart in mount transfiguration and he was transfigured this is that power of god the glory being declared the power of god over death abraham saw what job saw the resurrection this is a very specific manifestation of god this is just not an appearing of god and god working miracles this is a climax of culmination because god's plan from the beginning is redemption in john chapter 11 verses 25 and 26 jesus said i am the resurrection so the resurrection is not an event it's not a date it's a it's a person i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live right now there's where abraham's faith that's right there he's abraham's saying i'm believing in the redeemer i'm believing in the eternal god if you believe in him though you're dead you shall live what does that testify of a resurrection he says and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this that testifies of a rapture that there's believers who had no less faith in god than you do as far as salvation and believing that god is and having faith in christ in a revelation of the new birth personally to them a revelation of christ and people die in the faith and because they've died believing in the resurrection the first they're going to come right back up but there's also promise that he that believeth and is alive we that are alive and remain shall not taste death but we shall be changed that's the promise of christ and so jesus christ is the resurrection and so abraham's revelation brings christ into view brother ram said he saw christ on that mountain and so abraham's revelation brought christ into view now you see in my redeemer he's seen christ the very heart of god the revelation of god and this is how abraham is an example for us in the end time his life is even demonstrating that mystery of rapturing faith his life there's something embodied in his testimony something exemplified in his life his revelation his walk of faith is testifying of our walk of faith of our life and our supreme faith mark chapter 12 verses 23 to 27 mark chapter 12 verses 23 to 27 he says in the resurrection therefore they're asking them this question when they shall rise and what's the story where he says that a man got married and he before any and he dies and he has a brother and is married through seven brothers right quite the question so they're wanting to know that this woman that had seven brothers as husbands according to the law of redemption that when he the husband died her brother had to marry his brother had to marry her they asked this question who's gonna be the husband for the seven hatter to wife and recognize his answer jesus answering some of them do you not therefore air because you know not the scriptures neither the power of god for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven and as touching the dead that they rise have you not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob that's the revelation that christ has he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living therefore ye therefore do greatly air this is abraham's revelation he realized that god is not a god of the dead so how can i believe in the god who is life how can i believe in a god who is eternal life himself how can i believe in him and have true faith in him and never die how could i ever cease to be because god is the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead he is the god of the living and that's where they air not knowing the power of god because when they shall rise from the dead he says you have not considered who god is i am the god of abraham i am therefore the god of the living amen he's rebuking their their full understanding of who god is and the nature of god and so in john 8 56 when jesus says your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad now that's a deep scripture abraham rejoiced to see my day we could say well that means abraham was you know he was excited to see it he wanted to see it he was hopeful to see it and he saw it and was glad his soul the word there he rejoiced to see his soul left forward in expectation to the revelation of jesus christ to his seed this is what faith does it's faith is i preached it and i guess maybe you have to be careful with the word and use it but faith in the word of god is ecstatic it's an ecstasy it transcends the flesh it goes it's going beyond our natural experience and abraham was transported from the time that he was living by revelation and he longed to see the day when this seed would be revealed to the people he longed to see the manifestation of the full promise and not only the bible say he hoped to see it and imagined it and believed it he rejoiced to see it and revelation carries him forward to see it and he saw the revelation of jesus christ to his seat after him hallelujah he saw the revelation of christ to his seed it says he saw it and was glad he beheld it to his joy what did abraham see he saw the manifestation of god it's all the manifestation of god in flesh he saw christ in melchizedek in genesis 14 after returning from the slaughter of the kings who's the first one to try to meet him king of sodom tries to come in there and confuse things but then it's melchizedek who reveals himself serves him bread and wine after the slaughter institutes the communion abraham instituting the tithing abraham being taught by that angel repeating even what the king melchizedek says abraham begins to repeat it so he sees christ in melchizedek in genesis 14. he saw christ in the days of lot didn't he as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man well abraham lived it perfectly that's the original days of lot right that's not a hard one for us to say amen to it is the literal days of lot and what does he say he sees christ revealed in flesh in the plains of memory in genesis 18. he is seeing the revelation of christ you know the bible says abraham's seed will see the same thing does not the bible promise that the same revelation that came to abraham will come to the royal seat of abraham brother says in the sermon be not afraid he says and remember the last sign that was given to abraham which was a type of those who will go in the rapture abraham is a type of those who will go on the rapture and the sermon who is this melchizedek he says when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want to watch how we have to come think of that that's a mouthful brother john i'm just giving you a whole bunch of material you're gonna have you're gonna have to go to you just have to have service every night of the week to get through melchizedek just think about this he unfolds here with all the attributes will do in the final and that's you every son of abraham every son of faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want to watch how we have to come we have to come a certain way have to come the same way abraham did yes and in genesis chapter 18 verse 14 when he reveals himself in flesh to abraham he says is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son he unfolds here what he will do to every attribute in the final end every son of abraham is going to receive christ they have to receive him in this revelation that he's going to come according to the time of life when the word is birthed when the word is coming forth into full manifestation and there's glory the bride is going to bring forth jesus christ in its fullness again according to the time of life what is it a season for resurrection where sarah had the dead think of that sarah who was dead in her womb abraham dead in his body i will return according to the time of life and i will quick in a dead womb to season for a resurrection a season when deadness is conquered a season when the promise is fulfilled and paul takes in romans 9 9 for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son realize abraham's life is actually set it in order the rapture a set time determined by god i will come and return and give life over death think of the four death messengers the fourth four life messengers who's that fourth messenger it's christ coming at the open word to what to give life the children have come to the birth and there's power now to bring forth i will come and sarah the bride will bring forth jesus christ if i can say it this way before the meeting in the air there must be a visitation to bring rapturing faith before that we we know that we're in that rapture cycle now and i say this with respect that god's going to work through his bride to bring the rest from the grave he's not going to work through those who are in the grave to bring us to rapture in faith we are actually going to draw the rest of them from the grave and go in the rapture so as much as i love those saints that have gone before us just thinking about brother daniel this week brother dan missing him and the different believers we know that have passed on and gone before us and you think of just as we continue and as time goes on there's gonna be more men of god there's gonna be more servants gonna be more moms and dads and faithful people that go on and they're waiting on us as much as i long to see them and be in fellowship with them again and there's friends i know i'm looking forward to see out that day and that meeting in the air but it's not going to be their resurrected bodies that give me rapturing faith it's going to be the resurrected jesus christ revealed personally to me through his word that's going to bring me to a place of rapturing faith brother braham says in the sermon abraham and his seat after him our bodies will have to be changed we just can't turn back to young men and women we've got to have a different kind of body so you can be caught in the air to receive the promised son so notice the very order of that meeting in the air where you'll see him in that corporal flesh that's what the church is waiting for now this is in 1961 the true church every manifestation that he did to abraham he has done to his seat after him leaving one thing out that's the rapture of the church so the rapture of the church is embodied in abraham's life he says everything that he's done to the seed of abraham he's done to a seed after him what he did to abraham he's done to a seat after him except for the rapture of the church think about the things he did to abraham i'm making great time today this is wonderful that in genesis chapter 14 it just means i may not be preaching wednesday night pastor i'm sorry i may be getting through this in genesis chapter 14 who is it that madam melchizedek the king of salem the priest of the most high god brother man says god himself came down and revealed himself to abraham that happens this is what needs to unfold to us in genesis chapter 18 says the lord appeared unto abraham in the plains of memory who is it that's making himself known to abraham it's god revealing himself and he says what he did to abraham he has to do to his seat after him and there's only one thing he hadn't done yet reveal himself at the time of the rapture of the church so who's this melchizedek he says praise god for the opening of the seals to know these things now the true revelation of melchizedek comes into view now the true revelation of melchizedek comes in that had to be revealed abraham could have never made the top of mount moriah without king melchizedek prince the prince of salem could have never made it unless the lord had appeared to him and reaffirmed the promise what was the messenger of the covenant confirming the promise that god had given him in genesis 12 confirming the promise in genesis 13 confirming the promise in genesis 17 he appears to confirm the covenant he's a covenant angel and so the open of the seals we know the of the revelation of jesus christ is to bring supreme faith to the bride just as it did with abraham is to do it with the bride that's how we could say abraham's life testifies of the bride's supreme faith for a rapture where did his faith begin in election what was built on that's it abraham didn't have a better rock collection in his garden hit no offense he didn't have he didn't have you know a nice car he didn't have a better altar he didn't have a more perfect family it was election but his election grew as god revealed himself his faith grew from election and it began to manifest the character of god reverend says after you've trusted him and watched him do so many things till it just becomes like a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the rapture before the coming of the lord he says so the rapture will go on right on the that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures in the plans of god from a revelation of election to a revelation of perfection our rapture and faith brother i'm saying will come we'll it's going to rise by simply believing simply obeying amen not adding to not trying to be mysterious that's right brother brown says in the first seal he's talking about referring to revelations chapter 10 and the mystery of the seven thunders he says this in the first seal as he begins to preach we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it does it'll give faith for that rapture and grace for the church to move out and he starts saying we've looked through the dispensations we've watched everything we've seen the mysteries of god we've seen the gathering the bride in last days but there's something that we just can't lighten ourselves with there's something another but i imagine when the mysteries begin to come forth god said hold it back wait a minute i'll reveal it in that day don't write it at all john because they'll stagger over it just let it go listen i know we're getting close to an hour here he says but it'll reveal it in that day when it has need to be done when's the revelation going to come when you need it the revelation is going to come in that time at that moment when you need it to be done this is exactly what happened in abraham's life when he needed that when he needed it god revealed himself god didn't reveal himself that way in the very beginning listen and i just there there's a way that i want your your the holy spirit maybe to search these things out in your heart god didn't wake abraham up one day in the tent there in chaldea and say hey wake up don't get scared i'm god and i'm this is what's gonna happen you're gonna travel down into canaan and you're going to do this and you're going to just you're just mapping it all out for me one day you're going to have a son he's going to be named isaac and he's going to go up to a certain age and when he grows up to that age i'm going to ask you to kill him but i'm you're going to pretend you're going to go through the motions to kill him then i'm going to stop your hand he's going to continue on and he doesn't lay it all out and everybody's like okay okay can you write this down because this can be really hard can you just remember can you give me some cues here he didn't lay it all out for him but he revealed he revealed himself in a way to where this is genuine faith being cultivated in abraham and he finally came to a place where it dawns on him and he begins to realize wait a minute wait a minute the god that met me there in ur the chaldeans the god that met me there and has revealed himself and met me and met me and met me and provided and provided and provided this god at the time that he needed burst forth into rapturing faith revealed himself as the resurrection and the life and abraham can say i know i know he's able to raise isaac from the dead and brother brown says in the seventh seal when he's talking about don't get weird don't get mysterious that's what people have tried to do to the third pull they've taken it right out of the realm of faith god manifested in flesh and they've made it some hocus pocus weird stuff and it's caused people to turn away the reality of the seventh seal is a life lived by the word amen brother says in the seventh seal it will be revealed in that day in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before god and serve him and do all that we know to do and live good christian lives why because that's the how the rapture is going to come the regular routine of following the scriptures in the plans of god this doesn't take away the reality of the seventh seal this is the reality of the seventh seal some people read that and said well forget the seventh seal we'll just put that up someone i've even heard somebody had said that they read it when it was when it was read it when it was first printed and haven't read it again because they read oh just be simple don't make anything out of it but they're missing the revelation of it abraham's life held the revelation his life lays the pattern of it here's the example of aaron he holds the type but the man says everything he did to abraham he's got to do to us so let's let's start all over in genesis chapter 11. and i was taking i was pulling a lot of this stuff out last night because i knew i just had way too much and i want to just do it quickly if i could just give a quick overview of abraham's life in genesis chapter 11 verses 29 to 32 i'm not going to read all of it i'm not going to read the whole testimony of his life so if you're starting to get anxious wondering if the restaurants are going to close before i'm finished that's not going to happen i think some of them are open 24 7. so i know that's not going to happen genesis chapter 11 verse 29 to 32 it begins to tell the story of abraham as it leads up to this is all building from the moment that noah gets off the ark god's just trying to get to a place we can understand the setting for abraham and he's 70 years old when he's called and moved to haran with his dad and his nephew he's there in iran for five years before god moves him out of her own and it's his father that stays behind his father who dies and this move out of her to iran and then down into palestine these are the first steps of abraham's progressive faith progressive obedience i think we mentioned that wednesday he's progressively obeying god leave okay where am i going i'll show you later we know those many years later he comes to a place on a mountain go to a mountain i'll show you later abraham's i've been i've walked this road this is the regular routine this is how god reveals himself and so this is his journey of faith god having spoke to him in genesis chapter 12 i think we'll just start walking through these verses maybe one by one here and let's just start with verse two he says and i will make of thee a great nation this is god speaking i'll make it be a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed if abraham if this really just the seed of that if it could dawn on him he'd have to realize my life is going to be so so transformed to what it is now and at any given moment he had to look at his life and say how is how are people being blessed by this life at this point so there's something such a beautiful seed here let's skip to verse 7. and then this is god spoke to him now he's going to speak to appear to him again and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land so now he's journeyed to the promised land and the progressive revelation of god come out to a land that i'll show you and he comes and he's journey it's been a few years now and he comes to a place where now he says this is the land i'll give thee and then abraham builds an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him so his revelation has progressed he's now if this is the recognize the lord who appears the lord speaks and the lord appears to him and now he's called upon the name of the lord he's worshiping the lord who has appeared unto him and so he says i will unto thy seed will i give this land by offspring so what is he confirming god appears to him and confirms that you're going to bring forth many descendants that was the original message he says i'm going to give you this land the promise is coming into view the promised land this is the land that i told you i was going to show you this is it so god told me he'd have many nations come out of them he confirms it and he says and i told you that i'd show you the land and i've showed you so what ought that to do give him confidence that there's a seed coming amen see how god's working with abraham i'm going to show you a land and i'm going to give you nations he says here's the land did i tell you i'd give you nations so abraham could believe the next promise he says i give this is the land the lord is going to give to them this land has this eternal possession verse eight and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel in the west and haiy on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord his revelations progressing you know this is different in his worship he he builds an altar to the lord now he's calling he's evoking the name of the lord this is part of abraham's testimony to others he's building a even a church a place of worship and abraham abram journeyed going on still towards the south this is where the story the plot thickens and there was a famine in the land and abraham went down into egypt to soul germ there that means to live and to tarry for the famine was grievous in the land now in tracking this story this is where faith i want abraham just begin to get really relatable to us because the way that the lord has structured this and i say it was the lord because um not that i would blame him if you don't get it but that first part of rapturing faith that's so surreal to me it's so amazing to see that in the scripture well abraham believed that god was going to resurrect the dead that's why he could offer up isaac it wasn't just this ignorant obedience we make out abraham to be some sort of you know murderer you know somebody who's disconnected from reality that's not god brother man talks about us becoming insane sensible believers and abraham wasn't just this psychotic believer oh my goodness if that's what i got to do poke my eyes out and do this and do that no it was firmly rested upon the revelation that god is either going to have to bypass death or raise them up it was a place of revelation and full understanding amen and so this part of abraham is so extraordinary to see that overview of rapturing faith and christ being revealed to abraham but now when you begin to get the nitty-gritty of his life god has given him all these precious promises even fulfilled him and showed him the land and then now abraham's saying oh there's a famine and a famine is what causes him to leave the promised land the place that god said this land i gave you i gave it to you forever and to your seat after you forever and all of a sudden abraham's like oh no there's not enough grain and leaves the place that god said he can live forever leaves a place that god said would be a seed to him forever and this is where i think just one instance and i can't i'm not gonna be able to get to all the different instances that are relatable but for us god has already promised us his blessings he's already promised us many different things we see in the word of god we see him fulfilling different things in the word and god had already promised him the land he'd already promised him blessings he promised to the seed after him and therefore abraham didn't need to fret he didn't need to worry this terrible famine that came upon the land the threat of death why was he afraid of a famine because if you don't eat you die so god had already promised to preserve him in the land but abraham got afraid of dying for the lack of grain and then the the drought and lack of rain and this caused him to move to egypt what did it speak about some uncertainty about the promise some lack of understanding about what the promise meant because as soon as death started looming abraham leaves to go find a place he can be fed and that's exactly what we do sometimes god has made promises to us he's fulfilled promises but we get in a difficult situation and we begin to doubt and misunderstand the fullness of the promise and in this particular example it created a terrible danger zone for abraham because when he when he leaves this we'll see this here in a moment when he leaves egypt he gets to a spot where now he's left the land of promise and now he's vulnerable and this is uh the the this is the lesson that we learned trust god trust his process trust him yield to that process brother brahma says in recognizing your day and its message isn't amazing he preaches recognizing your day and it's message and he keeps talking about the jews why because they're in that hosea there's a revelation to you your revelation for your day your message god never blesses israel outside the land right this brother madam abraham went outside the land and was condemned everyone that leaves the land is condemned god can only bless israel when she stays in her homeland and she's there now as a nation and the church is called she's just only waiting for the rapture the bride taken out the seals are open it's revealed to us and why did it open up to us a whole new land a whole new field stay in that land no matter how long this carries no how long it gets stay in that opening of the word we don't need to fret oh we got to go back to something else we need to conjure up the guests we need to figure this out when you get back to the way things used to be stay in the land that's where rapturing faith is there's a little bit of famine for emotional little famine for this little bit of famine for that people get all nervous and upset they want to run back to egypt oh my he says we're in this land the seals are open it's revealed to us this is the possession this is the promise and abraham left the land that had been revealed to him and went to another land where maybe there was a little bit more for the flesh instead of staying right there brother man says abraham was condemned outside the land so what comes up immediately in verse 11 it came to pass when he's come near to enter into egypt he you can already see doubt starting to creep in notice what he says he said unto sarah his wife so this is his wife this is the one that conceivably no pun intended seeds are supposed to come from nations gonna come from sarah this his wife and this is what abraham says as they come down you can tell as he leaves the promised land his faith gets weaker behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon therefore it shall come to pass and it is the power of the spoken word when the egyptians shall see thee they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee what is it that stands out to you abraham's afraid of death he wasn't really even afraid of sarah being taken away from him he's just like they're going to kill me he said this is this man's wife and they're going to kill me he's afraid of death and because he's afraid of death it instigates a lie as soon as he left the promised land that had been opened up to him his faith gets a little weak and he starts fearing death then once he starts fearing death it's what instigates the lie and abraham's motivated he's acting out of the fear of death to leave the promised land famine is putting this onus of death over it's like oh no death it's this very ominous cloud is coming up he's looking around there's no rain there's no grain there's a drought people are dying they're starving i gotta leave and it was the threat of death that caused him to start to walk away as he begins to walk away his faith begins to get a little weak and now he's afraid that the egyptians are gonna kill him so it instigates a lie and he encourages his wife to lie to what spare his life what does he resort to his own wisdom death is death is certain honey so let's figure out a way out of this his own wisdom his own approach and he's put in this position because he leaves the land so abraham in genesis 12 after god has shown him the land and reaffirmed his promise and has appeared to him and he's worshiping he's a believer he begins to leave he leaves the land because he's afraid of death and having laid the left the land it's death that motivates him to lie to save his life and we know that he does he's spared and there's a lot that happens in abraham's life over the nearly next 25 years after 25 years after this we know in genesis chapter 13 god appears confirming the covenant he begins to unfold it in more detail it's just progressive read it and notice how it it more and more it says he went up out of egypt and he came to bethel again and and they're separating from lot you're so it just unfolds once he separates from lot god can unfold the vision in more detail then in genesis 14 he rescues lot meets melchizedek genesis 15 the lord appears to him in his vision i am thy my shield and i exceeding great reward genesis 15 1 after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not why did he say fear not abraham because he'd been a weakness famine caused him to be afraid he's leaving the beauty of his wife caused him to be afraid of death so he says fear not abram i am thy shield i am thy protector i'm the one that will keep you i am by exceeding great reward i am your defender i am your cover i am your reward i am your life i am your preserver don't worry about economies don't worry about pandemics don't worry about stocks and bonds and don't worry about savings don't worry about health trust in me he speaks this to him he says i trust in me and then abraham's response is what can you give me when i have no children what no wonder he says is anything too hard for the lord later he suggested he said well what can you give me when i have no children and what does he do in that moment because he's not fully catching the revelation he he suggests his servant seed he suggests an heir born to his servant not even from himself he suggests that well i have this servant who's had a son lord could he be the one then could you just make him the seed could you give all the promises you've promised me and my seed and could you somehow allow it to become his and the lord replies in verse 14 behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thiner but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowel shall be thine air and notice what he does god doesn't rebuke himself oh my goodness forget about it there's more chaldeans i can appear to he's going to stick with him you know what he's wanting to give it to his slave i want to give it to a son of his servant no blood relation at all he says no abraham let me help you understand this even better if this wasn't clear to begin with let me reveal this to you in greater detail no it's not somebody else that's going to be the heir but from your own person you're going to bring this forth and so he says come let me show you something bring it to verse 5. and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be amen one moment he's saying lord you're my reward you're my shield god's revealed himself in this vision and abraham and his vulnerability and his fears saying but what does it all mean if i don't have an heir maybe it could be my servant's heir and he says hold on hold on no you from your own seed are going to bring forth the sun and let me show you what this is going to become look at these stars it says he believed in the lord he believed him he's married to a woman that can't have kids has no children of his own has just suggested his servant servant son and he believed he looked at the stars and he believed the stars that cannot be numbered there's no light pollution they need to worry about right and he looks up in the star they must have just been so thick like a blanket he says that's how your seed's going to be and abraham abraham says i believe you amen and somebody nearby is like what kind of joke is this verse chapter 17 genesis 17 god appears to him again what does he do he reaffirms the covenant further unfolds the promise to abraham changes his name and he specifies then in this instance that it's sarah who's going to bear a son and his name will be isaac you know what he's doing he's further unfolding it abraham is going to be yours and then this is i'm not not getting into this part but you want to relate to abraham abraham has marital issues right there's a little bit of strife between him and sarah and sarah's like well why don't you you're just a little bit of strife in the home and abraham i don't know he's putting pressure on her you got to have a baby so you gotta have a baby she's like you know why don't you just use my servant why don't you just have a child since he said it's through you and he's like okay and then he has a son and i don't know if we're going to get into this as we look into this but abraham comes to a place he says all that ishmael would live before you just as he said his servant son would he lived before you now the servant of the bondwoman let him live before you let him be the one through which the nations come and the revelation gets even clearer no it's not just your seed through someone it's your seed through your wife sarah and his he's got i have his name his name's going to be isaac so in genesis 18 god visits him veils himself in flesh and visits abraham confirms the promise again and vows to return so now are you kind of with me it's 11 45. that's not that's nothing is it but the member said the bride could sit hour after hour so this is the point where i i'm announcing we're in the after hour and and there's let's just read genesis chapter 20 i want to read to verse i don't know maybe maybe verse 18 get to at least verse 12. let's just read through this think about everything god has revealed to abraham now kind of kind of an idea of what his weaknesses were he says and abraham journeyed from fence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and sure and so journey gerard and abraham said unto his wife she is my sister said of his wife she is my sister wait a minute are we back in chapter 12 again i think it is over 25 years later he says she is my sister and abimelech king of guerrero sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said behold thou art a dead man for a woman who has taken is another man's wife and in verse seven he says you go to that man who just lied to you give him his wife back he's a prophet so have him pray for you so you can live that's powerful and if you don't restore then you're going to die so once again death is even coming into view and then abimelech's like man why'd you do this to me i said hey do you know that girl over there yeah that's my sister you want me to give you a number four he's like yeah yeah i do totally and he's and he lies he's like why'd you do this to me all you had to do is say that's your wife but notice abraham's response after believe it's like what have you done to me what kind of deed have you done abraham says in verse 11 get there so he could see this because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife's sake abraham is still afraid to die he's still afraid to death after everything god has said abraham it's not going to be your servant son it's not going to be hagar son it's not going to be it's going to be your seed through sarah abraham knew when he came into under the presence of abimelech that if god killed him he'd have to raise him up and sarah also because he was going to have to have a son by sarah but his actions betray his doubt so he said yet indeed she i said she is my sister or then i'll notice how he kind of covers it up but yet indeed she is my sister and she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife maybe a little technicality there i mean i didn't really lie did i said that i mean she is indeed my sister she's the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and i married her but it was because of fear abraham is still afraid of death and because he's still afraid of death his actions don't line up with the promise abraham i'm going to give you son i'm going to give you a son named isaac he comes into a situation and all of a sudden he's afraid he's going to die all he had to do is say sarah do we have a son named isaac yet no honey we don't okay all right i'm not afraid what man can do unto me i'm not afraid of what abimelech can say or what he can do but his actions testify that he hadn't fully absorbed the reality of the promise brother brown in the sermon christ revealed in his own word he says abraham for instance he called the father of the faithful do you think abraham would have wrote the book of himself on himself of his own cowardliness how do you think he would have wrote that he lied to the king that morning and that said that was his sister when it was his wife would it right of his cowardly deeds that he did surely he had never done that god is preserving abraham brother man's his cowardly deeds his lies and the bible preserves them he says abraham wouldn't have wrote about that i mean abraham said god spoke to me and i believed him and that was perfect faith i was a perfect christian and i conquered kings and i brought forth kings and i mean abraham would have told the story a little bit different and what is it signified though abraham believed it says he believed the lord and believe believe in god he counted it to him for righteousness so genesis 15 says he believed he was a believer god kept revealing himself to his seed kept revealing himself to abraham by election he wasn't going to give up on him it's the unconditional covenant adam with noah conditional covenant but now with abraham he starts on an unconditional covenant and then god says leave it to me now i will take it from here and no matter if you get weak no matter if you doubt no matter if you're a coward no matter if you lie even if against the in the face of the promise you're afraid of death i'm going to keep coming to you and coming to you and coming to you and revealing myself to you when you run after your servants turning plowshares into into swords and you run after them with man-made spears and you do battle with armies and kings i'll allow them to conquer because i've got to preserve your life i'm going to keep you alive and no matter where you go and what you do i made the promise i will keep you i will see you through even when you're a coward even when you're weak he believed abraham believed but it testifies there was a deeper understanding the full revelation of the promise would have pointed to a power to preserve life because he was going to have a son isaac it's just like paul when the ship was going to wreck he's like well i don't know how but i got to be there i got to go to rome he told me i was going to go i got to get there somehow did not paul say that in in leicester they were pressed beyond measure even were they despaired of life and they trusted in a god who what who would raise the dead paul came to a place in his own ministry where he knew god had made a promise this needs to be done but he was so certain in that moment he was going to die he's like this is it i'm going to die but he didn't despair he's just like wow god's just going to have to raise me from the dead that's what he did that's what the bible tells us he did he said so we just trusted in a god not in ourselves but a god who could raise the dead we're going to be killed we're going to be dumped in a ditch life is going to leave and god's going to come by and raise us right back up because i've got to fulfill what he said i was going to fulfill that's a revelation to the promise it says in genesis 15 6 i think we read it a moment ago and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness but there's still a greater potential potential penetration of that revelation a greater unfolding a manifestation this is i believe where we can relate our faith justifies us our faith makes us righteous that's right where the bible says we're justified by faith and we're of the faith of abraham our faith in the word justifies us it makes us righteous but yet we can still be weak in our minds amen we can still believe but be oppressed by certain things and cause us to despair cause us to doubt there's times i'll just be i'll be the one that testifies there's times when my life has not lined up with my revelation and i've looked back and realized man how could i live such a defeated life and how can i be so negative and how can i get anxious and how can i despair and how can i worry when god made me these promises and the devil just tries to work in our minds that you can lose god's love and you can offend him for the last time and what's he doing he's trying to take everything god has told you and say just forget everything he's ever promised and believe my interpretation to you and believe my lies to you and god says wait a minute i called you by election and told you i would show you this and i showed you and i told you i would do this and i did it and you look back on your life as an abraham and you're like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute he's proven his love for me time and time and time again look at where look at some of you who are here today look where you are today did you ever think you'd still be here do you think you'd still be persevering did you ever think that this work would continue why has it happened god is faithful in your own lives and your own testimonies brother joshua i just we haven't even met yet he googled for my phone number and found some random phone number online and texted and he actually text our home phone number that elliot had in his possession he's like dad someone's asking for your phone number or asking if this is who you are and you look at just a little bit of your testimony you shared with me look at the grace of god that's the life of abraham we might want to look back say oh what about this and you did this and you did that and you failed this and you felt that no that may be my testimony but his testimony is faithful his testimony is true he never gave up he never gave up on me [Applause] and we might not conduct ourselves even according to the word that's been revealed to us but god says i'm not done with you yet aaron not done with you yet sin the light i'm not done with you yet brother i'm not done with you sister so in genesis chapter 22 i'm closing in this it comes in verse chapter 22 2 verse 8 when isaac says dad dad what's going to happen you got the wood you're going to build an altar but isaac had seen enough in his dad's life to know there had to be a sacrifice he says daddy what are we gonna what are you gonna offer he says my son god will provide himself a lamb for burnt offering this isn't just a hope so this is not just well i'm sure i sure hope this happens he says and they both went up on together they both of them together and they came to the place which god had told them of this is notice this regular routine came to the place he says he knew he had to come right where god told him to go and when he came there abraham built an altar laid the wood in order bound isaac kissed son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son amen he's no longer afraid of death just in prior chapter just in chapter 20 he lied to avoid death chapter 12 he lies to avoid death abraham has demonstrated this fear but in this moment when he raised back that knife he was no longer afraid of death but he believed in the promise he believed what god had said and in that moment the the promise and the revelation imposes itself it's the word i like to use in this moment it's it just imposes itself so much upon abraham that it transforms his actions transforms his reality how could a man who looked forward to this son for so long suffered so much because of the son for so long believed in these promises for so long was an outcast was uh was castigated and made fun of because he's believing oh the father of many nations hi abraham is this really going to happen and he comes this moment where all his vindication all his testimony everything he believed he's being asked to sacrifice and in that moment it would all be gone and he'd come back down that hill and have to face his wife and says where's isaac he said i killed him on that mountain and and the revelation imposes itself so greatly upon abraham he raises back that knife not not believing that isaac would forever be dead but believing in a god that raises the dead in hebrews 11 19 according that god was able this is what he says according that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence he also received him in a figure finally abraham's actions are in harmony with the revelation of god's promise finally it's in it's in line with the truth of what god had told him that the eternal nature of the promise this is the this is the manifestation of how abraham's faith had matured these instances in his life where he demonstrated this weakness and this fear fear of famine fear of death fear of death all these different fears maybe let it be my servant son let it be ishmael all these different things but now he has a more perfect understanding and how did how did it happen by god just revealing himself god appearing god confirming god fulfilling his promise to him it was the results of a regular routine of following revelation in the plans of god for his life i love that and what pretty what it produced is a fully awake trust in the face of being asked to do something that we'd say is irrational there's different things that we could share other scriptures that maybe would be very appropriate here to where to to use but let me just say the manifestation of the promise is what made the difference for abraham and that's why it's so important to see the promised word for this day and as abraham was walking in the present the presence of god in his day in his time according to his promise it was that walking with god that matured his faith he didn't have it in chapter 12. he didn't have it in 15. he said well how can you bless me when i don't have kids he didn't have it even in ch after chapter 17 and 18 he didn't have it in chapter 20 but he did in chapter 22. even even abraham's actions after death testified of a resurrection because he wanted to be sure that he was buried in the place where the resurrection would be even in death and he purchased a plot for sarah and he buried her there and he wanted him to be buried there and then isaac is buried there and the bones of jake why because that's where the resurrection would be even in his death abraham couldn't stop testifying of life amen it was just by walking with god that matured him to a place where he was no longer afraid of death he could believe in life through all his crises his ups and downs his doubting just the detours somehow through it all his faith grew stronger and the bible says in romans 4 19 to 21 and being not weak in faith i think it's wonderful to know that god doesn't see our faith as weak yes he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief he never staggered at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith think about what we've already read strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform the bible says not being weak in faith the weak in the flesh his faith ultimately prevailed and even in that moment where god in genesis 22 where god asked him to sacrifice his son under the strain of the final crisis he didn't wake up that day and god speak to him and say it's enough lord i can't do this anymore you tell you promised me this and i'm a stranger you promised you that the famine comes you promise me this and this happens and i finally separate from lot only for him to get taken away and i finally do this and i find it and it doesn't he doesn't finally he doesn't break he doesn't give in but in that moment his faith rises above it and even in the birth of isaac even in isaac being born he didn't he refused to consider the physical impossibility of having a son and even in the sacrificing isaac he refused to consider the physical impossibilities that would make god's promise unrealistic but the bible says not being weak in faith he didn't consider his dead body didn't consider his wife's dead womb i even want you to think about how he stared death down in isaac he didn't consider all his disabilities he didn't consider the circumstances but he actually stared him down staggered not he wasn't afraid he didn't flinch staggered not but he stared him down he considered as he looked at him he considered how strong they were abraham you're dead your wife's never been able to have a child he stared him down and he looked at him he absorbed him he saw the reality of he didn't just stick his head in the sand well they're not real they're not real he saw what they were and he saw what they what they represented he saw what it meant and he looked at that and then he looked at the promise and he weighed the promise against his flesh he weighed the promise against sarah's flesh he weighed the promise against the death of isaac and he confidently decided the word of god was right amen and he declared god's word will stand yes and i say this is just what you can relate to i trust you can relate to this whatever our present weaknesses whatever we're current currently going through whatever temptations our faith is greater amen don't look at your own weaknesses don't don't even look at your past that's right abraham didn't abraham could have been walking up that mountain and who knows the devil could have been right there saying you've always been afraid of death always been afraid of death you you you offered up your servant son you offered up your ishmael you lied to the kings twice you did the same thing twice 25 years later hadn't you learned your lesson you've never you've you've always been afraid of death and he could have just looked at his past but he didn't thank you and neither should we and james 1 12 says blessed is the man that endureth temptation remains steadfast into trial perseveres when tempted for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him that was abraham's blessing his testimony was crowned and this is this is what he wants to do give you continual life-giving prevailing revelation because that's exactly what he did for abraham no matter what he was going through what he experienced it was that continual life-giving prevailing revelation that gave the that was the wind to his faith that's what kept lifting him up despite his weaknesses despite his doubts despite his trials his faith is so relatable to us because god has preserved for us his journey from election to supreme faith and i believe that he's with us saints and he wants to raise us to that place on our own mount moriah to believe the promise let's stand thank you for your patience today bless is the man that endureth temptation makes it through the trials that's our prayer that god would continue to give us by spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation i'd like to sing that song the winds of faith we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer if you need prayer today and you just want the lord to increase your courage you just want to raise your hand say lord help my faith i relate to abraham today i feel the pressures i feel the trials coming on i see how much i've doubted you and how my own actions don't always line up with my revelation but lord just keep appearing to me like you did abraham lord i know you won't give up on me and i'm sorry lord forgive me for my unbelief help me today like you did abraham would you appear to me again and encourage me lord could you tell me again what the promise was lord could you like you did abraham just take it a step further and tell me more let me see it our gracious heavenly fathers we're standing in your presence today lord we've had ups and downs we've had trials but lord we're enduring and we believe there's going to be a crown of life that you're going to give us and lord i want to be those that endured to the end lord i believe that i'm standing the day in the hour when rapturing faith has been given to the elect and lord it's a time when the faith of abraham is being demonstrated again and i ask lord that you can help us today through our weaknesses through our struggles our physical ailments may we not consider the weakness of our body may we not consider the sicknesses in our bodies may we not consider the debility debilitating depression or anxiety in our spirits lord but maybe look at the promise lord may stare down whatever our trials are stare down our temptations stare down our weaknesses stand down lord in this very moment look at him and say i see him i'm aware of them i know my mistakes i know my past i know what i've been through but then look to the promise and say your word is enough your word is enough lord i know i'm not able and just as abraham came to the top of mount moriah to a place where lord you've asked me you've asked the impossible i'm done on my own i won't try any longer lord i yield to the supreme i yield to the divine take over from here lord may there even be births that take place today from those who finally give up on their own and are willing to receive your holy spirit lord those of us who've been in this pattern of abraham lord we're in the late hours we're in the chapter 22 of this revelation we've got to come to a mount zion showdown lord for a rapture

magnifying the word that had been given becoming richer becoming deeper even as brother brown talks about the spirit it's the same spirit that's been in the church ages just more of it more power it is coming clear and clear and clear to culminate in a rapture of the whole body a resurrection of those who've gone before it was already in the promise so the revelation abraham came to on mount moriah it wasn't a new message it was just the full understanding of the message that he'd given in the beginning and he could say yes that's it this is in this moment i can trust him i can fully believe him because the power was already in the word that he'd received he says watch the eagle in the sky he does not struggle he does not strive for the power that makes him rise is already in the
