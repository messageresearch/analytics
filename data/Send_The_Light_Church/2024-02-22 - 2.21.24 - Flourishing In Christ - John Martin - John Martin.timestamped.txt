[36:19] with me if you would to the Book of

[36:25] scriptures how many remember the book of
[36:28] Psalms chapter
[36:30] 1 that's usually a a
[36:33] familiar set of scriptures for most of
[36:42] us amen let's let's read the first six
[36:46] verses we'll have a a word of
[36:49] prayer and
[36:51] then then be seated the scripture says
[36:55] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[36:59] the counsel of the
[37:01] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[37:05] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[37:09] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[37:12] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[37:15] meditate day and night he shall be like
[37:19] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[37:22] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[37:25] season and his leaf also shall not
[37:28] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[37:32] prosper the go
[37:34] ungodly they're not so but are like the
[37:38] chaff which the wind driveth away
[37:41] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[37:45] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[37:47] congregation of the righteous for the
[37:50] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[37:52] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[37:56] amen and let's look to the author
[37:58] Heavenly
[38:00] Father we thank you Lord that you have
[38:02] preserved your word for us in this age
[38:05] we could have confidence when we're
[38:07] reading it it is your word it hasn't
[38:10] been mixed with man's but it is exactly
[38:14] your word to us Lord and we're looking
[38:16] to you this evening Lord to give us the
[38:19] revelation of this word and how this
[38:22] word might be a benefit for each and
[38:24] every one of our Lives by father we pray
[38:27] that you'd help us now just to set aside
[38:30] Lord all the things of the day all the
[38:32] thoughts that we could just focus this
[38:34] next little bit on you I pray Lord that
[38:38] you come and reveal uh yourself to us
[38:42] through these scriptures Lord we'll be
[38:44] careful to honor you and to praise you
[38:47] and to give you thanks for all these
[38:49] things for we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[38:51] name amen and God bless you you may be
[38:55] seated if we were to go to the the
[39:00] Beatitudes there's about nine or ten
[39:03] things in the Beatitudes it starts out
[39:06] that we're blessed if we're poor in
[39:09] spirit if we mourn if we Meek if we if
[39:12] we thirst hunger for righteousness if
[39:15] we're merciful we are blessed if we're
[39:17] these things
[39:19] amen but in Psalms
[39:24] 1 we're blessed if we don't do these
[39:29] things and
[39:32] it's it's
[39:34] uh there's a little nugget I think
[39:37] hidden in here and I want
[39:39] to really focus on verse one today
[39:43] because um we're blessed if we don't do
[39:48] these three things that it's talking
[39:50] about we're we're just blessed and uh I
[39:53] I think you know we look at blessings
[39:55] coming in different ways
[39:57] different forms different shapes and I
[40:00] want to take a look at this one because
[40:02] this is a real wonderful Psalms and want
[40:06] want to entitle this flourishing with
[40:08] Christ because we are told that we'll be
[40:11] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[40:13] water and and that our fruit will come
[40:16] forth and It season and we won't wither
[40:18] we'll stay we'll stay in the presence of
[40:21] God and and and stay uh in love with God
[40:24] and and and bearing that fruit and and
[40:26] then this promise of whatsoever we're do
[40:28] we're going to prosper all because we
[40:32] don't do these three things amen I I
[40:37] just I I it just really grabbed me and I
[40:40] wanted to go through it the first one
[40:42] here that's mentioned is the man that
[40:44] walketh not in the counsel of the
[40:46] ungodly or we might say ungodly
[40:50] counil now counsel is simply given
[40:54] advice especially as a result of of a
[40:58] consultation and you know we all like to
[41:00] give advice amen we probably would
[41:03] rather give advice then take advice
[41:06] right that's just kind of our nature
[41:08] council could be a lawyer engaged in a
[41:10] trial appointed to advise or represent
[41:13] legal matters and there's been times
[41:15] that we we've heard from a number of
[41:18] people that a lawyer uh gave wrong
[41:22] counsel he gave the wrong advice it
[41:25] didn't work out for our favor can you
[41:27] say Amen to that are you with me but
[41:29] there's also spiritual
[41:32] counsel Good Counsel and brother brandom
[41:34] said that we come to church to find out
[41:37] where we're standing with God so we
[41:39] might say it like this that we could get
[41:41] good counsel in the house of the Lord
[41:43] amen Godly counsel 2 Timothy 3:16 Says
[41:47] all scripture is given by the
[41:49] inspiration of God and it is profitable
[41:52] for Doctrine for Repro for correction
[41:55] for instruction and right
[41:57] that the man of God may be perfect
[41:59] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[42:03] amen we have everything that we could
[42:06] possibly need right in the Bible for our
[42:09] counsel amen one time David took his
[42:12] eyes off the Lord and he was F focusing
[42:15] on the prosperity of the wicked which
[42:17] didn't make sense to him at all and he
[42:20] said his foot almost slipped until he
[42:24] said I went into the sanctuary of God
[42:27] then I understood their end amen he
[42:31] maybe didn't get comfort from the aspect
[42:34] that the wicked were still getting
[42:38] Prosperity but he understood their end
[42:41] all because he came to church amen and
[42:44] so to me I don't care what it is in life
[42:48] there's an answer in the Bible there is
[42:51] absolutely an answer in the Bible for us
[42:54] and we should gain confidence and spend
[42:56] more time reading the
[42:59] Bible Psalms 3311 says the counsel of
[43:02] the Lord standeth forever and the
[43:05] thoughts of his heart are to all
[43:07] generations so God isn't going to change
[43:09] his mind in this generation just because
[43:12] we got
[43:13] cars his word Remains the Same amen
[43:17] Psalm 73:24 says Thou shalt guide me
[43:21] with thy counsel and afterwards receive
[43:24] me to Glory amen counsel is important
[43:29] amen did you know God uses the office of
[43:32] a pastor to get us to the other
[43:36] side in other words he plays a vital
[43:40] role in
[43:41] guiding his counsel to us is really more
[43:45] important than what the devil wants us
[43:47] to know his role is different than the
[43:50] other
[43:52] fourfold uh Ministries that God has put
[43:56] for our
[43:57] Perfection
[44:00] and we must understand that um when
[44:04] we're we're get we're trying to get
[44:07] counsel we must have confidence in the
[44:10] office that God provided and not the man
[44:14] amen God honors the
[44:16] office because man
[44:19] fails but if your confidence is in the
[44:22] word if your confidence is in what God
[44:26] spoke then God will honor your faith and
[44:31] lead you to the other side that's just
[44:33] the
[44:33] truth now believers who are not
[44:36] established we've seen this young
[44:38] believers not established can end up
[44:40] running we heard from Pillar To Post
[44:43] just going looking for advice and
[44:47] unfortunately the nature of the flesh is
[44:50] to take counsel from someone who they
[44:53] already that already agrees with them
[44:55] are you you understand what I'm saying
[44:57] if you're not getting the answer you
[44:59] want you go to somebody else until they
[45:01] agree with you if they don't agree you
[45:03] go to somebody else and finally they
[45:05] agree with you and you say okay yeah
[45:07] this is I took counsel from this
[45:10] person every man is right in his own
[45:13] eyes and it's hard to get away from that
[45:15] that that
[45:17] attitude so we can end up taking advice
[45:20] from a wrong Source or a wrong
[45:24] spirit wrong Spirits have the largest
[45:30] wardrobe the largest wardrobe they have
[45:33] clothes for every
[45:35] occasion every situation that you could
[45:37] possibly be in the devil is right there
[45:40] trying to give you wrong advice trying
[45:42] to stir you in the wrong direction
[45:46] yes I say if the advice isn't coming
[45:49] from the word of God you're not going to
[45:51] be blessed amen amen so watch out
[45:56] who your friends are right who you're
[45:59] listening to amen ungodly Spirits
[46:04] unawares get on us through people and
[46:07] before you know it we'll start acting
[46:09] like the person who were hanging around
[46:12] with who we taking advice from now I
[46:14] don't you understand now here's what's
[46:16] really really
[46:19] dangerous we all have friends that are
[46:21] in the
[46:23] world Associates people that we know
[46:27] people that we
[46:28] like people that we get along
[46:31] with people who we wish we're in the
[46:35] truth right amen the thing is if we're
[46:38] not careful we'll start listening to
[46:42] them because we got it in and that's
[46:44] what the devil uses it's still ungodly
[46:49] counil and I'm going to show you how if
[46:52] you just give me a little bit of
[46:54] time in General whatever you spend time
[46:58] doing that's what you're going to be
[47:00] influenced by the prophet simply said if
[47:03] you if you read your Bible and you pray
[47:06] well then you'll just become more
[47:08] spiritual right if you want to become
[47:09] more spiritual read your Bible play
[47:11] You're influenced by by God Through the
[47:14] Bible and through prayer well what
[47:16] happens when you're hanging around
[47:17] somebody
[47:18] else who's not the Bible who's not this
[47:23] the the spirit of Christ
[47:26] you're going to get influenced by them
[47:30] unawares unawares and before you'll know
[47:33] it you're going to start acting like and
[47:35] I have seen it so many
[47:39] times so the more time you spend with
[47:42] God the more you'll become like God
[47:44] Amen and if you spend your time with
[47:46] carnal things or carnal people you'll
[47:49] become more carnal and not even realize
[47:52] it so taking advice from a person who
[47:56] isn't presently surrendering their life
[48:00] to God is
[48:05] unwise you don't want to take advice
[48:07] from somebody who won't surrender their
[48:09] life to
[48:11] God even though it sounds good even
[48:13] though you agree with it you don't have
[48:17] to agree with it for it to be right it
[48:19] just has to be in the word are you with
[48:22] me amen Paul said to the galatian
[48:26] church he said as we said before so I
[48:30] now say again in other words I'm not
[48:32] changing it if any man preach any other
[48:36] gospel unto you than what ye have
[48:38] received let him be a cursed right
[48:42] amen a person who isn't humbly walking
[48:45] under the influence of the word of God
[48:48] is being led by another Spirit he's
[48:52] being influenced by another Spirit I'll
[48:55] say say it like this it's a false light
[48:57] we've heard many times the greatest
[48:59] robbery that ever took place happened
[49:02] with a false light and Satan wants to
[49:05] mix counsel little good little
[49:08] bad that's how he catches amen but you
[49:12] don't want to walk in that Council
[49:17] amen everything you could possibly need
[49:20] is already in the Bible we just need to
[49:22] learn to Humble ourselves go to the word
[49:24] and say God show
[49:26] too often we just we go to somebody else
[49:28] and try to get their opinion you know
[49:30] you're always going to be tossed around
[49:33] and and changing if you do that you
[49:35] don't want to do that just get real
[49:38] serious with God get real get real
[49:40] sincere with God and God will show you
[49:43] what to do amen amen so if you want God
[49:46] to bless your life separate yourself
[49:48] from ungodly
[49:50] counsel you can't just expect to be
[49:53] blessed in the world and be taking
[49:54] advice from people or from wrong Spirits
[49:58] I don't care if it's Google I don't care
[50:00] if it's people in the world I don't care
[50:02] if it's someone coming to church or a
[50:03] family member choose the counsel of
[50:06] someone who's walking a surrendered life
[50:10] to the word someone who's under
[50:12] subjection to the word someone who's
[50:13] surrendered because they're not going to
[50:15] lead you
[50:20] astray too often we we think it's not
[50:22] that oh it's not so bad if I'm listening
[50:24] to so and so
[50:27] really are they they they taking you
[50:30] right back to a Crucified Life are they
[50:33] taking you right back to the word or
[50:35] they saying to you well yeah that just
[50:37] doesn't matter how many times have we
[50:38] heard Satan say to us through somebody
[50:41] it doesn't matter you don't have to do
[50:43] that see that's you don't want to walk
[50:46] in that kind of counsel you will never
[50:49] be blessed you'll only be blessed if you
[50:52] separate from that why would we want to
[50:55] take counsel or advice from a person who
[50:58] isn't willing to pay the price
[51:01] thems so let's give it the word test
[51:04] turn with me if you would to First John
[51:06] chapter
[51:08] 4 I was thinking about this in our men's
[51:12] meeting today but I didn't want to bring
[51:14] it up because I was going to bring it up
[51:17] today how do we know God's speaking to
[51:19] us that's kind of what we were one of
[51:21] the topics we were talking about
[51:23] anyways and here in 1 John chapter
[51:30] 4 the Bible says beloved believe not
[51:34] every
[51:36] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[51:39] are of God because many false prophets
[51:42] are gone out into the world there's many
[51:46] of
[51:47] them the very fact that you have fallen
[51:51] that you have you that we've all come
[51:53] short of the glory of God that means
[51:55] false Spirits have gotten on us and
[51:58] we've said things and done things that
[51:59] were
[52:00] wrong so we don't want to take counsil
[52:03] from just one
[52:05] another I'm sorry I don't care if we're
[52:08] better than the church down the street
[52:10] or uh somebody else in the
[52:13] world we got to go back to the source we
[52:16] got to go right to the word we got to
[52:18] make sure it's the word amen hereby know
[52:23] ye the spirit of God every spirit that
[52:27] confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in
[52:30] the flesh is of
[52:33] God now that's not just confessing Jesus
[52:37] has come in the flesh the Devils believe
[52:40] that in fact when Jesus was here G they
[52:43] said to Jesus why have you come to
[52:45] torment us before a
[52:47] time so obviously that type of believing
[52:51] that Jesus has come in the flesh is not
[52:54] what he's referring to
[52:57] every spirit this is the John Martin
[52:59] interpretation here every spirit that
[53:01] manifest Jesus Christ in the flesh is of
[53:05] God now that's the interpretation of
[53:08] that scripture so if the person in front
[53:11] of you is manifesting Jesus Christ in
[53:14] their
[53:14] flesh well then I think you could listen
[53:17] to that
[53:19] Spirit but how many people we
[53:22] know talk the talk but don't walk the
[53:26] walk so they're not manifesting Christ
[53:29] why would you take counsel of that
[53:31] you're you're just it's like play rule
[53:33] out it's it's
[53:35] gambling Paul said it's just a form if
[53:39] it's just a form he said turn away we
[53:42] can't have a form of godliness we need
[53:44] the manifestation of
[53:45] it brother Brandon was constantly
[53:48] showing the people that Jesus was in the
[53:52] flesh he would constantly say that he'd
[53:55] take the take us back to the woman that
[53:57] was at the well and he you know he would
[53:59] be speaking that that this is Christ
[54:03] manifested today the same yesterday
[54:05] today and forever he took us back to
[54:07] Jesus Christ being manifested showing
[54:09] that the word the spirit that was behind
[54:12] what he was preaching was of
[54:15] Christ so we wouldn't have to question
[54:18] we wouldn't have to
[54:20] doubt verse three and every spirit that
[54:24] is not manifesting the word in flesh is
[54:27] not of
[54:34] God I like that every spirit that
[54:37] confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
[54:39] in the flesh is not of God and this is
[54:41] the spirit of what
[54:44] Antichrist where of ye have heard that
[54:46] it should come and even now already is
[54:47] in the world ye are of God little
[54:49] children have overcome them because
[54:52] greater is he that's in you than he that
[54:53] is in the world oh what does that
[54:56] mean if the manifestation of Christ is
[54:59] in you you will overcome whatever Spirit
[55:02] you're dealing with amen that's what it
[55:05] means to be greater in you if it's
[55:08] manifested it can't be any greater than
[55:11] manifested on your out of your
[55:14] flesh that's what makes you an
[55:17] overcomer not because you think you got
[55:20] more than somebody
[55:23] else because it's the the that word that
[55:26] Spirit of Christ that word is so
[55:28] powerful it's
[55:30] manifested that Jesus Christ is the same
[55:33] yesterday today and
[55:38] forever so walking with the wrong
[55:40] counsel will always lead us to a
[55:42] spiritual downturn with our walk with
[55:44] the with the Lord you know brother
[55:47] Brandon makes this statement he says I'd
[55:49] rather have the wrong Doctrine and have
[55:53] the right spirit and to be absolutely
[55:56] right with my Doctrine and my spirit be
[56:01] off he chose the manifestation of the
[56:04] word over the doctrine of the word
[56:07] that's what he did he chose the
[56:10] manifestation of the spirit of the word
[56:12] in flesh over any word or any Doctrine
[56:16] on its own showing is how important it
[56:20] is to be living the life
[56:23] amen I you know it's like we should not
[56:26] be
[56:27] scared that we're wrong about certain
[56:33] doctrines we should be wrong that we're
[56:35] not living the word that we know to be
[56:42] living so if you want God to bless you
[56:44] more we just need to choose to separate
[56:47] from counsel that's outside of God's
[56:49] word amen just just make that decision
[56:52] I'm going to do it right now I'm going
[56:54] to like like be careful about who I'm
[56:56] listening to too often we become the
[56:59] judge of the council we shouldn't be
[57:01] doing that as if our our discernment is
[57:06] is the the right thing the word it just
[57:08] needs to be the
[57:11] word God don't want the pressure on
[57:14] us to be the
[57:17] word he's the
[57:22] word blessed is the man that walth not
[57:25] in the counsel of the
[57:27] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[57:30] Sinners so this next one is blessed is
[57:33] the man that standeth not in the way of
[57:38] sinners now the way of a sinner is
[57:42] self-willed it's the
[57:45] self willed way self-willed way that is
[57:50] the way of a sinner there is a way which
[57:52] seeth right unto man but the end thereof
[57:55] are the ways of death this this
[57:58] self-will is so deceptive because of
[58:01] every man feeling right in his own eyes
[58:04] turn with me if you would to Second
[58:06] Peter chapter 2 verse 10 we're just
[58:08] going to be talking about the way of
[58:11] Sinners which you know you're kind to
[58:13] look too far in the world and you see a
[58:15] whole world full of Sinners don't
[58:17] you but sometimes we could walk in that
[58:20] same way we're not as bad as them as it
[58:24] were
[58:25] but God's not grading on this scale we
[58:28] could still walk in their way and not be
[58:30] part of the World by Simply Having a
[58:33] self-will among us all right verse 10
[58:36] says but chiefly them that walk after
[58:40] the Flesh in the lust of uncleanness
[58:44] look at they despise
[58:46] government presumptuous are they
[58:51] self-willed they are not even afraid to
[58:54] speak evil Vil of
[58:57] dignities see the way of Sinners is
[59:00] self-willed they're full of presumptions
[59:03] they have no problem speaking evil they
[59:06] just presume all that they say all that
[59:09] they do it's okay this is a way of a
[59:12] sinner and it's so easy for a Christian
[59:14] to walk in that way not even realize
[59:20] it how they walk how they talk
[59:23] self-willed I'll say like this without
[59:26] the fear of God without I could be wrong
[59:29] without I need to be careful without
[59:32] what we heard last
[59:34] service walking after the flesh despised
[59:38] governments presumptuous self-willed not
[59:40] afraid to speak evil look at verse 11
[59:43] whereas
[59:44] Angels which are greater in power and
[59:49] might bring not a railing acquisation
[59:53] against them before the
[59:57] Lord and Angels haven't done anything
[1:00:00] wrong in
[1:00:02] heaven right but they are so full of the
[1:00:06] fear of God that they just don't use
[1:00:08] their mouth to speak whatever they want
[1:00:10] to speak amen I am telling you the way
[1:00:13] of Sinners is much closer to us than
[1:00:15] what we
[1:00:19] realize how are we going to be
[1:00:21] blessed when we're walking in the way of
[1:00:25] Sinners we
[1:00:26] can't so I'm just focusing on this first
[1:00:31] verse by simply separating from these
[1:00:35] things we automatically get blessed we
[1:00:37] don't have to go looking for blessings
[1:00:38] we don't have to go looking for
[1:00:40] Prosperity it just happens when you step
[1:00:43] away from the things of this
[1:00:48] world let's drop down to verse
[1:00:51] 15 which have forsaken
[1:00:55] the right way and gone astray following
[1:00:59] a different
[1:01:00] way the way of bam that's son a um
[1:01:05] buzar who loved the wages of
[1:01:12] unrighteousness
[1:01:15] wow there's a little example of of a
[1:01:18] wage of
[1:01:23] unrighteousness you shut the door on my
[1:01:25] toll you know you did
[1:01:29] it you wanted to make sure that you gave
[1:01:32] me the rough
[1:01:38] shoulder you walk
[1:01:41] out and the way of unrighteousness is
[1:01:43] for me not to forgive
[1:01:46] you that's the way of
[1:01:49] unrighteousness me for the person that
[1:01:52] did that that's up between them and
[1:01:57] God but you
[1:02:00] see we can go after other I'm going to
[1:02:02] show them who whoa whoa whoa what are
[1:02:05] you going to show them right we've got
[1:02:07] to show them the way of
[1:02:11] righteousness it's easy to forsake the
[1:02:14] right
[1:02:15] way and to go in the way of Sinners and
[1:02:18] not really realize it because we're
[1:02:20] still Christian we still go to church we
[1:02:22] still say we believe God but we're not
[1:02:24] re recognizing what's happening inside
[1:02:26] of
[1:02:29] us but was rebuked for his
[1:02:34] iniquity the dumbass speaking with man's
[1:02:37] voice forbade The Madness of the
[1:02:41] Prophet wow it can get pretty bad things
[1:02:43] ever get so bad that something bad
[1:02:46] something really weird had to happen to
[1:02:49] get your
[1:02:50] attention oh yeah oh yeah for sure God
[1:02:54] knows how to get our attention amen so
[1:02:58] there's two ways there's God's way which
[1:03:00] is the right way under subjection to the
[1:03:03] word and then there is the the the
[1:03:07] self-willed way it's the
[1:03:10] UN
[1:03:12] Godly way that people walk in it they're
[1:03:16] just not subject to the word you give
[1:03:18] them the word and they say don't you
[1:03:20] don't you tell me they may not say it
[1:03:22] with their words they may just like be
[1:03:25] resistant to it that's the wrong way
[1:03:29] it's the wrong
[1:03:30] way one way is hard one way is easy one
[1:03:34] way is narrow one way is Broad One Way
[1:03:37] leads to Life One Way leads to
[1:03:39] destruction
[1:03:41] right blessed is the man that standeth
[1:03:44] not in the way of
[1:03:47] Sinners and what that really means is
[1:03:49] blessed is the man that does not abide
[1:03:52] or dwell in the way that Sinners are in
[1:03:58] I mean Sinners are just Sinners they
[1:03:59] just go live any way they want to they
[1:04:01] don't answer to
[1:04:03] anybody and we can literally if we're
[1:04:06] not careful slip into that attitude
[1:04:09] right amen I'm not saying we go back out
[1:04:11] in the world I'm not saying we forsake
[1:04:14] God I'm not saying we forsake
[1:04:16] church but the devil knows how to get in
[1:04:19] there and get us to just like stop
[1:04:23] caring
[1:04:25] I'm just going to chill out here I'm
[1:04:27] going to abide here I'm going to dwell
[1:04:28] here I'm just going to take a a backseat
[1:04:31] here that's the way of a sinner it's
[1:04:34] easy the way of a sinner is very easy
[1:04:38] you can do what you want to do you can
[1:04:40] say what you want to say and there's no
[1:04:43] accountability
[1:04:45] amen so the way of a sinner is without
[1:04:48] the fear of
[1:04:51] God brother BR said God's way the the
[1:04:54] Christian way is a hard rugged
[1:04:58] life it's choosing to suffer for the
[1:05:01] will of
[1:05:03] God it's rejoicing in our trials that we
[1:05:06] might be partakers of the sufferings of
[1:05:09] Christ the Bible
[1:05:11] says Moses chose God's way Hebrews 11:25
[1:05:16] says Moses choosing rather to suffer the
[1:05:20] Affliction with the people of God than
[1:05:21] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:05:23] season esteeming the reproach of
[1:05:25] Christ's greater riches than the
[1:05:28] treasures in Egypt for he had re he had
[1:05:30] respect unto the recompense of
[1:05:33] reward so God's way is the harder harder
[1:05:40] way God's way sometimes you just want to
[1:05:42] speak up but God's way says don't say
[1:05:47] nothing what you know our we just want
[1:05:50] to just give our two cents put the
[1:05:52] person in their place God says just a
[1:05:55] soft answer right now just get things
[1:05:57] under control turn away wrath amen see
[1:06:01] there's a difference between the way of
[1:06:03] a sinner the way he handles
[1:06:07] things and the way that God handles
[1:06:10] things do you know brother brandom chose
[1:06:12] to suffer Affliction with the people of
[1:06:15] God and he he had respect for the right
[1:06:19] reward he didn't go after temporary
[1:06:22] satisfaction he didn't go after money or
[1:06:24] vain Glory or Desiring
[1:06:28] popularity in the message the Easter
[1:06:31] seal brother brandom reads the prophecy
[1:06:35] that was given to him in in tongues now
[1:06:39] listen to this he said because thou has
[1:06:41] chosen the Narrow Path the harder
[1:06:45] way thou has walked of your own
[1:06:48] choosing thou has picked the correct and
[1:06:51] precise decision and it is my way and
[1:06:53] because of this momentous decision a
[1:06:55] huge part of Heaven awaits thee what a
[1:06:58] glorious decision you made this in
[1:07:01] itself is that which will give and make
[1:07:04] come to pass a tremendous victory in
[1:07:06] love
[1:07:07] divine now he chose to walk in God's way
[1:07:11] which was harder he chose to separate
[1:07:15] from popularity and look at me and I'm
[1:07:17] right and money and all the other things
[1:07:20] he could have gained in the position
[1:07:21] that he was in that's right but he chose
[1:07:25] to not walk in the way of
[1:07:28] Sinners I'm not mistaken I could be
[1:07:31] wrong
[1:07:32] and if if I need to be corrected I I'll
[1:07:35] I'll I'll
[1:07:37] correct but I believe that there was a
[1:07:39] time that there was a someone that got
[1:07:43] healed some person and they were
[1:07:46] attached to a lot of money and that
[1:07:48] person it seems they sent two FBI agents
[1:07:52] over with like a a a million point8 or
[1:07:55] something like that to give to brother
[1:07:59] brandom as as an offering and and and he
[1:08:02] could use it for the ministry or and he
[1:08:05] chose not to receive
[1:08:09] it he could have been a been
[1:08:11] denomination probably much if you would
[1:08:14] have just
[1:08:15] chose the other
[1:08:18] way brother brandham like Moses had
[1:08:22] respect for the right reward
[1:08:25] and the reward that we're looking for is
[1:08:28] the reward that God gives us for walking
[1:08:30] in the way of a Christian the way of the
[1:08:33] word
[1:08:34] amen choosing the right way is more
[1:08:37] difficult than we realize it's not a you
[1:08:40] you choose it one time and then the rest
[1:08:43] of your life it you you just follow
[1:08:46] it we are constantly choosing every day
[1:08:49] many times a day the harder
[1:08:52] way and it's very easy that we could
[1:08:55] slip and get off of
[1:08:58] it we see examples in the
[1:09:02] Bible so we need to be on guard amen all
[1:09:06] hell is against anyone who's consciously
[1:09:09] choosing to walk the harder way every
[1:09:12] day
[1:09:13] amen that's why Satan is always
[1:09:15] presenting to us an easier way to walk
[1:09:18] in oh you don't got to do that you don't
[1:09:20] got to turn and you don't got to and you
[1:09:21] don't got to God knows
[1:09:25] this is all you have to do it'll be just
[1:09:28] fine you can you can have what you you
[1:09:31] can have what you want you can do what
[1:09:33] you want to do he's always presenting
[1:09:36] that to
[1:09:37] us in different kind of outfits no
[1:09:40] matter what our situation is all hell is
[1:09:44] against us from choosing the harder
[1:09:47] way Satan Works day and night trying to
[1:09:50] convince us of anything except stay with
[1:09:54] the word amen he's trying to get us to
[1:10:00] compromise Satan's
[1:10:03] way Satan's way is the way that's
[1:10:06] outside of God's will Satan's way is
[1:10:11] self-willed every more every man is born
[1:10:14] in Satan's way he's born with I'm going
[1:10:18] to do what I want to do even if my mom
[1:10:21] or my dad tell me not to do it I will
[1:10:24] find a way to trick to deceive to lie
[1:10:27] because I want to do what I want to do
[1:10:30] and that is the
[1:10:32] reason every man must be born again with
[1:10:36] another
[1:10:37] spirit that he can do the will of God
[1:10:41] he's born by the will of God to obey the
[1:10:43] will of God and I'll tell you that's
[1:10:46] hard to do that every day if you're
[1:10:48] honest if you're really truly sincerely
[1:10:51] honest that is not easy
[1:10:54] because you're fighting against a flesh
[1:10:57] that Satan knows how to
[1:11:00] use in Satan's way every person
[1:11:04] experiences being right in their own
[1:11:07] eyes why else would Jesus say If any man
[1:11:10] come after me let him deny himself pick
[1:11:13] up his cross and follow
[1:11:16] me so the only way a man will ever
[1:11:19] question anything about his own views
[1:11:22] his own opinions is to literally humble
[1:11:24] himself and say I could be
[1:11:26] wrong I could be walking in the way of
[1:11:29] Sinners I need to be sure about
[1:11:33] this Proverbs 3:7 says be not wise in
[1:11:36] thine own eyes fear the lord and
[1:11:40] depart from
[1:11:43] Evil Satan's way is without proper
[1:11:51] headship Satan offered a third of the
[1:11:54] Angels Freedom Liberty to do what you
[1:11:57] want to do and you don't have to listen
[1:11:59] to God's strict
[1:12:02] rules he offers a freefor all go where
[1:12:05] you want do what you want to
[1:12:09] do it's is a manipulative
[1:12:12] tactic to
[1:12:16] mislead and he can get us sucked into
[1:12:19] that to where we
[1:12:22] can
[1:12:24] vaunt our own self get angry think ill
[1:12:29] gossip hate one another and still think
[1:12:33] we're okay but we're under the wrong
[1:12:40] headship and any have you know how it is
[1:12:44] when somebody's trying to make things
[1:12:46] right with you but you're too mad and
[1:12:47] angry to to to to help bridge the gap
[1:12:51] come on it's just it's it's it's the way
[1:12:54] of a sinner the way of a sinner is
[1:12:56] unforgiveness the way of a sinner is is
[1:12:59] is not to stand in the
[1:13:02] Gap it's so easy to get caught in those
[1:13:04] things and we don't even realize
[1:13:06] it so when we surrender Our Lives to the
[1:13:09] headship of God's word we come under
[1:13:11] subjection to God's
[1:13:15] headship and we're not under God's
[1:13:17] headship unless we're under the word
[1:13:21] amen it's when we realize that our
[1:13:24] fleshly mind is enmity against
[1:13:27] Christ so we learn to Humble ourselves
[1:13:30] we learn to be subject to one another in
[1:13:33] the fear of the Lord we learn to walk in
[1:13:36] the spirit we learn to live for others
[1:13:39] whatever the words says the bride begins
[1:13:43] to bring herself under subjection to
[1:13:46] that one step at a time whatever the
[1:13:48] prophet taught she comes under
[1:13:50] subjection to it this is what it means
[1:13:52] not to walk in the way of
[1:13:55] Sinners right I know it's it's a lot for
[1:13:59] that one verse but I just want to break
[1:14:01] it down it's not until we surrender to
[1:14:04] the world word that we're under the
[1:14:06] proper headship
[1:14:09] righten I want to make this statement
[1:14:12] and I want us to be careful to listen to
[1:14:14] it if our
[1:14:17] spirit is not under
[1:14:19] subjection to the spirit of God in
[1:14:22] another person
[1:14:24] person we're not
[1:14:26] being
[1:14:28] subject to
[1:14:33] God we're not being subject to God's
[1:14:37] headship
[1:14:39] right and this is a hard one because
[1:14:42] what it does it forces
[1:14:47] us to know that God could be speaking to
[1:14:50] us through another human
[1:14:52] being
[1:14:54] I'm going to give you some scriptures
[1:14:56] for that 1 Corinthians 14:32 the spirit
[1:14:58] of the prophets are subject to the
[1:15:01] prophets amen verse 33 for God is not
[1:15:04] the author of
[1:15:06] confusion 1 Peter 55 they all of you be
[1:15:09] subject one to another and be clothed
[1:15:11] with humility amen Ephesians 5:21
[1:15:14] submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:15:16] the fear of God I could be
[1:15:19] wrong so just because you don't agree
[1:15:22] God's could be speaking to you through
[1:15:25] another
[1:15:26] person and if we're not under subjection
[1:15:29] to that you're not being under
[1:15:30] subjection to God it isn't that person
[1:15:32] that you're rejecting it's God and you
[1:15:34] don't even realize
[1:15:37] it sometimes God uses other people to
[1:15:40] speak to us the truth he's Sovereign he
[1:15:42] can do what he wants to do amen so we
[1:15:45] need to be sensitive to the spirit of
[1:15:47] God in others at all times so often when
[1:15:51] I'm talking to somebody I'm staring at a
[1:15:55] spirit that's speaking to me much more
[1:15:56] than I'm listening to the whatever the
[1:15:59] conversation is I just you just can't
[1:16:01] help it and it's an automatic thing
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:05] amen so when we separate ourselves from
[1:16:08] the self-willed way God he's going to
[1:16:11] automatically bless you just by stepping
[1:16:14] out of that stepping out of that I'm
[1:16:17] going to do it my way the Frank Sinatra
[1:16:21] way blessed is the
[1:16:24] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[1:16:27] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:16:29] the Sinners and this last
[1:16:31] one nor sth in the seat of the
[1:16:37] scornful
[1:16:42] now why is this one a
[1:16:46] seat why is the scornful one a
[1:16:52] seat
[1:16:53] and this is me my
[1:16:56] brother I don't believe
[1:16:59] they're they're willing to get off their
[1:17:02] seat to actually do something to help
[1:17:05] the
[1:17:08] situation people who
[1:17:10] scorn are not only critical but they're
[1:17:13] typically
[1:17:15] lazy they only use their mouth they have
[1:17:19] no problem being negative about things
[1:17:21] but they won't get up and help somebody
[1:17:23] with the
[1:17:24] situation they have no problem being
[1:17:26] brass and arrogant or cruel but they
[1:17:28] don't want to get up from the position
[1:17:30] that they're in how how they're
[1:17:33] viewing and
[1:17:35] actually go help the situation that's
[1:17:38] why I call is it's why I think it's a
[1:17:42] seat they just want to stay right there
[1:17:45] in the position that they're in stay
[1:17:47] with what they
[1:17:50] concluded it's an awful sight
[1:17:54] to see someone murmuring complaining
[1:17:57] scorning someone
[1:18:00] else look we're we've all got we've all
[1:18:02] become guilty of sitting in this seat at
[1:18:04] one time or
[1:18:06] another so there's there's no point in
[1:18:08] the fingers here but I I just want us to
[1:18:10] get more blessed and I I think if we get
[1:18:13] off this seat don't ever get on that
[1:18:15] seat we'll be
[1:18:19] blessed ways that we've never perhaps
[1:18:22] seen before
[1:18:24] so when you try to correct someone who's
[1:18:26] sitting on this seat what happens they
[1:18:29] often get
[1:18:31] offended they'll start scorning you for
[1:18:35] correcting something you did to somebody
[1:18:38] else Proverbs 98 says reprove not a
[1:18:43] scorner lest he hate
[1:18:47] thee rebuke a wise man and he will love
[1:18:51] thee amen it all depends Amen on who
[1:18:55] you're talking
[1:18:57] to does the person in love with God or
[1:19:01] are they
[1:19:03] not because you know people you don't
[1:19:07] even have to be spiritual to be
[1:19:10] critical so if you're hating someone
[1:19:12] giving them the cold shoulder shoulder
[1:19:14] scorning them a little
[1:19:17] bit just because they're trying to hold
[1:19:20] your actions
[1:19:21] accountable I say humble yourself and be
[1:19:25] wise and get off that
[1:19:28] seat there were 1.8 million so-called
[1:19:32] Believers that were murmuring against
[1:19:34] the headship of
[1:19:37] God first uh Corinthians 105 says but
[1:19:41] with many of them God was not well
[1:19:45] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[1:19:51] wilderness it wasn't because they were
[1:19:53] saying oh I just want to do the right
[1:19:55] thing I I I didn't mean to murder I
[1:19:57] didn't mean to complain oh they were
[1:19:58] just they were so
[1:20:01] right this was just unfair what they had
[1:20:03] to go
[1:20:06] through they didn't have no problem
[1:20:08] saying you know Moses isn't the the the
[1:20:12] true Prophet we need to raise somebody
[1:20:14] else up and take us back to
[1:20:20] Egypt and I'll tell you there were only
[1:20:22] just a few
[1:20:24] people who didn't walk in that
[1:20:28] way what did Moses do what did Joshua do
[1:20:31] what did Caleb do what did Aaron
[1:20:33] do they separated themselves from that
[1:20:38] Spirit they the Bible says they were of
[1:20:40] another
[1:20:42] Spirit blessed is the man that doesn't
[1:20:45] sit in the seat of the
[1:20:47] scornful you are a
[1:20:50] minority if you're not sitting down
[1:20:52] scorning
[1:20:53] somebody you are part of the little
[1:20:56] flock that God promised to give you the
[1:20:58] kingdom because the majority of the
[1:21:01] people have no problem saying well I
[1:21:03] don't think she should do this and she
[1:21:05] should do that and he should do that and
[1:21:07] he shouldn't do
[1:21:08] that get off that seat and go wash their
[1:21:11] feet that's the example that Jesus gave
[1:21:13] us get off that seat go wash his feet
[1:21:16] and help them help
[1:21:19] her well I should have to says
[1:21:24] who well God didn't tell
[1:21:27] me you know what if you got to hear an
[1:21:30] audible voice to do what the word has
[1:21:32] already told you to do something's wrong
[1:21:33] with your
[1:21:35] experience amen something is
[1:21:38] wrong you don't need a personal
[1:21:40] invitation to do what the word already
[1:21:42] says to do right
[1:21:47] amen if we have a
[1:21:50] problem go help them we need need to
[1:21:52] stop the gossiping about things stop the
[1:21:55] backbiting the devouring
[1:21:58] tattling go take care of things with
[1:22:02] meekness and the love of God in your
[1:22:05] heart God never made you an
[1:22:08] administrator of negative
[1:22:14] conversations sometimes you know we're
[1:22:16] you know we just become some
[1:22:19] administrator Satan is the only one
[1:22:21] that's the accuser of the brother and
[1:22:23] when we start doing it you know what
[1:22:25] side we're
[1:22:29] on we're in the wrong
[1:22:32] way around the wrong seat I mean Satan
[1:22:35] when he accuses us you know how it is
[1:22:37] when Satan accuses
[1:22:39] you he put you in a spot where there's
[1:22:42] no way
[1:22:43] out there's no hope for you you're
[1:22:46] you're not even a Christian God don't
[1:22:49] love
[1:22:51] you Christian wouldn't do what you
[1:22:58] did sometimes we say the same thing oh
[1:23:02] if they were a
[1:23:03] Christian they wouldn't have did
[1:23:06] that if they really love God they
[1:23:08] wouldn't have treated me like
[1:23:10] that we end up doing the same
[1:23:14] thing I'm telling you all we have to do
[1:23:18] is separate from that seat just separate
[1:23:21] from it you'll automatically be blessed
[1:23:23] amen you'll be an oddball there'll be
[1:23:26] something different about you amen God
[1:23:28] will start blessing you when you stop
[1:23:31] being
[1:23:33] negative all right separating from these
[1:23:35] things when we get up and
[1:23:38] separate from the scornful seat God is
[1:23:42] Promised Blessings Now I believe he'll
[1:23:45] take the fear that we're dealing with
[1:23:46] and he'll turn it into
[1:23:49] faith I believe he'll fill our heart
[1:23:51] with love
[1:23:53] I believe he'll load us with blessings
[1:23:55] that we haven't been
[1:23:57] experiencing there's a reason that God
[1:24:00] doesn't bless
[1:24:02] us we probably could do a series on
[1:24:05] that because we all want the blessings
[1:24:07] of God
[1:24:09] right and
[1:24:12] look God is able to make all grace
[1:24:15] abound to
[1:24:17] us he's also able to withhold
[1:24:21] it he's the one that makes the say so
[1:24:25] and I I just love that he let me know
[1:24:28] that I'm going to be blessed if I don't
[1:24:30] do those
[1:24:32] things just separate from those things
[1:24:34] there's a lot in there in that one
[1:24:39] verse so if we want to flourish more we
[1:24:41] must learn to separate ourselves from
[1:24:45] these things from certain
[1:24:47] things we don't want to be just a a
[1:24:49] hearer of the word today and say we we
[1:24:52] we like that word but we got to separate
[1:24:55] from the carnal nature and just purpose
[1:24:57] in our heart when we leave
[1:24:59] here I'm going to separate from these
[1:25:01] things I'm going to make a conscious
[1:25:03] decision to separate from these things
[1:25:06] you want to do that amen the Bible says
[1:25:11] whatsoever they whatever they do they're
[1:25:14] going to
[1:25:15] prosper just by
[1:25:19] separating can you imagine everything
[1:25:21] you do like
[1:25:22] Joseph just
[1:25:25] prospering the
[1:25:27] ungodly are like the chaff which the
[1:25:30] wind driveth away I don't want to be
[1:25:34] driven away from God's
[1:25:36] blessings I want to be real close to
[1:25:39] them so I just want to give some
[1:25:41] scriptures here to help encourage us
[1:25:45] that God is calling us to separate from
[1:25:47] these things the Bible says come out of
[1:25:49] her my people that you be not part
[1:25:52] partakers of her sins that you receive
[1:25:54] not her plagues amen 2 Corinthians
[1:25:59] chapter 6
[1:26:01] verse4 I'll just try to get through this
[1:26:03] as quick as I can here 2 Corinthians
[1:26:06] 6:14 be not unequally yolked together
[1:26:09] with
[1:26:11] unbelievers for what Fellowship have
[1:26:14] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[1:26:16] what communion have light with
[1:26:19] darkness and what Concord have Christ
[1:26:22] with
[1:26:23] belile or what part have he that
[1:26:26] believeth with someone that doesn't
[1:26:29] believe Like You
[1:26:30] Believe come
[1:26:33] on and what agreement have the temple of
[1:26:36] God with
[1:26:37] Idols for ye are the Temple of the
[1:26:40] Living God as God have said I will dwell
[1:26:42] in them I will walk in them I will be
[1:26:43] their God they shall be my people
[1:26:46] wherefore
[1:26:47] conclusion wherefore come out from among
[1:26:52] the mix and be ye separate sayeth the
[1:26:56] Lord and touch not the unclean thing and
[1:27:00] I will bless
[1:27:03] you I will bless you I will receive you
[1:27:07] amen and will be a father unto you and
[1:27:10] you shall be my sons and daughters saith
[1:27:13] the Lord Almighty now we're all Sons and
[1:27:15] Daughters here this is not a a message
[1:27:18] to
[1:27:19] Sinners trying to get you to come to
[1:27:22] Christ this is not the
[1:27:25] group but I do believe God is calling us
[1:27:31] to the top of the
[1:27:33] pyramid we've got to separate if we want
[1:27:36] to be blessed with the bride of Jesus
[1:27:40] Christ I want to
[1:27:43] prosper I want to flourish with
[1:27:46] Christ and he shall be like a tree
[1:27:49] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:27:52] bringeth forth his fruit and his season
[1:27:55] and his Leaf also shall not wither and
[1:27:57] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper you
[1:27:59] know I'm heading there I'm not there yet
[1:28:02] but I'm heading there I'm going in that
[1:28:04] direction Brother Bruce I'm heading
[1:28:06] there because I believe God has a
[1:28:09] blessing for us amen amen you got time
[1:28:13] for one more because I I I I still got
[1:28:16] five
[1:28:19] minutes this
[1:28:22] this I believe if we put this into
[1:28:25] practice this is a little bit easier to
[1:28:27] do this one it'll get us to where we
[1:28:29] want to get to look at verse two of
[1:28:32] Psalms 1:2 says but his Delight is in
[1:28:34] the law of the Lord and in his law doth
[1:28:38] he meditate day and night that's right
[1:28:41] so you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh
[1:28:43] to you amen the more we meditate on God
[1:28:48] the more we'll flourish right all right
[1:28:50] turn with me to Psalms 19
[1:28:55] verse2 Psalms 19:12 who can understand
[1:28:59] his
[1:29:02] errors you know what's
[1:29:05] confusing we do things we don't want to
[1:29:08] do we don't do things we should
[1:29:12] do we're perplexed at times
[1:29:16] because we're Christians we want to do
[1:29:18] the right thing but we find ourselves in
[1:29:22] states of just uncontrollable
[1:29:25] Behavior so who can understand his
[1:29:28] errors it takes God to help us
[1:29:31] right cleanse thou me from Secret faults
[1:29:38] amen this is something that nobody knows
[1:29:40] about this is just kind of between you
[1:29:43] and God secret
[1:29:47] faults keep back thy servant also from
[1:29:53] presumptuous
[1:29:54] sins got that word again let them not
[1:29:58] have dominion over me then shall I be
[1:30:01] upright and I shall be innocent from the
[1:30:04] great
[1:30:05] transgression how often do we do things
[1:30:09] assuming it's okay with
[1:30:14] God how often do we take wrong counsel
[1:30:17] even from a believer that isn't
[1:30:20] according to the
[1:30:23] scriptures how often do we assume our
[1:30:26] self-willed behavior isn't really going
[1:30:28] to harm anybody or harm
[1:30:30] anything or how often do we say little
[1:30:33] negative things about others assuming
[1:30:35] that it's not that big a deal everybody
[1:30:37] does
[1:30:39] it this type of attitude can quickly the
[1:30:43] Bible says take dominion over a Believer
[1:30:47] and not even know it in other words
[1:30:51] they're walking around all the time just
[1:30:54] presumptuous about
[1:30:58] everything so we must make a conscious
[1:31:01] decision to separate from an attitude
[1:31:03] that just just presumes being right all
[1:31:07] the time and the fear of of the Lord as
[1:31:10] we heard last service is the beginning
[1:31:12] of wisdom we got to start instituting
[1:31:15] that that I could be wrong all right
[1:31:18] let's look at this last verse here
[1:31:20] number 14 let the words of my
[1:31:23] mouth the meditation of my
[1:31:26] heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord
[1:31:31] my strength and my redeemer
[1:31:35] amen if we don't pursue this Heart Of
[1:31:40] God I want to I want to get off the seat
[1:31:43] I don't want to stand in the in the
[1:31:45] wrong the the way that of self-will and
[1:31:49] and and and I just I don't want to take
[1:31:51] counsel from just oh anybody because
[1:31:54] they're my
[1:31:59] friend Lord I really want my meditation
[1:32:03] to be on the word
[1:32:05] amen I want to think the word I want to
[1:32:08] speak the
[1:32:10] word and when I'm doing that I know it's
[1:32:14] acceptable in your sight amen let's
[1:32:17] Stand Together God bless
[1:32:20] you
[1:32:27] you know I honestly
[1:32:30] had the other half of that was the rest
[1:32:32] of the
[1:32:33] Psalms but I just knew I couldn't even
[1:32:35] get to it I was I wasn't even G to
[1:32:37] started just that one verse if we could
[1:32:39] do that one verse walk away separate
[1:32:44] from those things we got blessings
[1:32:47] coming and we weren't even like God
[1:32:50] bless me just God just does it for
[1:32:53] following his word amen let's sing
[1:32:58] um can we sing two songs can we sing We
