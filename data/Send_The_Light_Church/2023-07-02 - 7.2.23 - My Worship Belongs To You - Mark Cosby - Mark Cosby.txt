as they're live streaming this morning and we'll just bow our heads and open up in a word of prayer and just invite the author just to reveal his word to us dear Lord Jesus we uh just thank you for

to you to have preeminence Lord just take your control Lord just send your Holy Spirit Lord and this bless the remainder of the service we ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen I'd like this to open up in the Book of Psalms and we'll go from we'll go to verse uh Psalms chapter 29 verses 1 through 2. so Psalms 29 verses 1 through 2. please say Amen when you get there so we'll start at verse one give unto the Lord O ye Mighty give unto the Lord glory and strength verse 2 give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name says Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness may the Lord has had the blessings upon his word you may be seated so I looked that word up Holiness I was just curious so it's sacredness the state of anything hollowed or consecrated to God or to his worship applied to churches or temples that which is separated to the service of God now you don't have to worship God just to be in church but you can worship God in your homes in your cars at your job so a lot of times we kind of just think worship is here at the church but worship is a life it's an everyday thing it's not just something you just put on Wednesdays and Sundays and leave it here but it's something that has to be taken with you is something that comes deep within the heart and so I always loved that song uh How Great Thou Art I just read the lyrics oh Lord my God when I an awesome Wonder consider all the worlds thy hands have made so we're just thinking about that you're just recognizing how Mighty of a God that we serve and how holy he is says I see the stars I hear The Rolling Thunders thy power throughout the Universe displays now I love this part then sings my soul not just the mouth but deep within your heart sings my soul my savior God to thee how great thou are how great thou are so I just love that when we sing these songs to God has to come from deep within we can't just be singing the screens off the word but the words have to mean something so deep as you just sing the songs back to God and that's what true worship is because you're not just singing to sing but you're singing Because you know that you're meeting with God at this very moment let's go to First Peter chapter one and reverses 15 through 16. so we saw reverse 15. but as he which has called you is Holy so how many believe that they've been called by God this morning amen amen so be holy in all manner of conversation so it's so important see worse like I said before that's a that's a form of worship how we conduct how we live our lives how people see us is uh is going to be a direct reflection of our Lord Jesus Christ so if we're bringing a bad example to that that we're not worshiping God at that moment if we're just letting any little things slide in our life we have to set a standard see when you worship you're setting a standard that this is how God is calling me to live this is how much I love God so we'll go to verse 16 but it is written be holy for I am Holy another way to learn Holiness is to get more intimate and deep with God because he is the definition of Holiness if you remember reading in the book of uh in the Old Testament when he's on that mountain that not even an animal can touch him can touch that mountain I should say and he still as holy as that today and he still deserves our respect our reverence our praise our honor our adoration so he deserves all these things and we can get in that channel of that we can get into the Holiness of God and he'll teach us how to be holy amen uh there's a a 1955 October 2nd may we worship thee in spirit and in truth so notice he is separated spirit and in truth so something that we both have to do both of these things because we can just Worship in the spirit but not have the truth and we can just have the truth and I have the spirit but when both of those come together that's the type of worship God is looking for in each one of our lives says in the beauty of Holiness may we live every day so this is something that we can attain something we can uh go for go towards for because each day is a brand new day it says not noticing what the world's got to say about it so we don't care what X Y and Z of the news says about it but we care what the Lord says what his standards are because as his ways are his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts and says but what you say about it Lord grant it so I looked up the word worship says to adore to pay to pay Divine honors to to reverence with Supreme I love that respect and variation so I love that to reverence what Supreme respect so it's not just a regular kind of respect but it's a a a fear of the Lord type of respect and so I looked the word of veneration so it's the highest degree of respect and reverence respect mingled with some degree of awe a feeling or a sentiment excited by the dignity of a person or by the sacredness of his character and with regard to place by its so just think about that when you look at respect in a different way when you're trying to we're in worshiping God there's something so different than a it's a regular kind of respect because you're just paying your respect to God because just thinking about what he's done for you what he's going to do and just all the things that he's taking you through this should bring us to our knees and to say well I love you Lord I worship you Lord and look at one more definition of worship says to honor with extravagant love and extreme submission so when you're worshiping God you are surrendering yourself to him you're bowing down before him under his mighty hand and it says as a lover and it says see we we got to realize that worship is something is intimate something that's between you and God not you God in the pastor or you God and brother Mark or you got him brother Ron but it's you and God it's just you too it's a straight and narrow for a reason there's only room for you and for God so we got to recognize that that's what that that interests me God intimacy God is looking for and the thing is true worship has to come from the heart it can't just come from lip motions but it has to come deep within the heart that's where it comes from it says when we come to worship him we're forgetting about ourselves and we're just concentrating on him and he needs to become the main focal point of our life at all times not just when we want to make him a focal point when we need him but we need God in all aspects of our life no matter what we're going through whether it's good times or bad times we need to make that a standard in our life so intimate is in most inward internal so intimate something that's in here see intimacy the word entity is close familiarity or Fellowship nearness and friendship remember in John 15 Hal says uh let's go to John 15 a little set in the notes but it's okay so John 15 and we'll just uh read verse 14. it says ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you so just think about that and if we go above it says if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love so I being obedient to God I believe is a form of worship as well because that's how you enter into that love that he is uh that he wants to give us and we when we get that love we can love him back with that same love that he loves us with and that's worship right there amen so I I know that I believe the Lord is constantly calling us to a higher more intimate worship the closer more the closer we get to God the more is expected out of us because we're we're reaching a higher maturity just like when you're raising your kids you expected a lot more out of them uh when they were 15 when they compared when they're five years old so the same thing in our walk with the Lord the older that we get the more that it's expected out of us the more we have to labor into his presence because he's given us so much more Revelation than he did five years ago or six months ago and so he's expecting a lot out of us amen so let's go to Romans 12. and we'll start with reverses uh one through three so the the title of the sermon is My Worship belongs to you before I forget to say that and so our worship should always belong to him no matter what I just that simple statement this this thing about that just put yourself in there that your worship belongs to him he's worthy of that so let's go to Romans 12 and start with verse 1. so I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye presents your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and we will present that to God that's worship because you're not it's not your body it's not your life anymore but you're giving it on to him and say Lord let your perfect will be done in my life no matter what Storms Come this is yours I'm Yours verse 2 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say to the grace which is given unto me every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than you ought to think but to think soberly according as God had dealt to every man The Measure of Faith so we got to realize where everything that we have comes from it comes from him our health our jobs our house our family everything comes from God he's the source of it all and if he lifted his hand off of it we see what happened to job when God did that and look at all the things that began to happen so sometimes we don't recognize the blessings that God has given us all that we have and I think a lot of times that's how we get in the Rut of not being grateful gratitude kind of slips away because we forget where everything comes from where sometimes we look at we're looking for things that we don't have instead of just thinking the Lord for the things we already have and so gratitude is so key in a believer's walk it helps it helps you not to murmur and complain because we murmur and complain because we we kind of put the Gratitude off to the side and so the more grateful we can be the less complaining that we will do in our lives amen so let's go to Psalms 103. how many loves the word this morning amen don't be scared to pull on the word it's his word not my word so we'll go to verse one says bless the Lord O My Soul notice that that inward deepness in all that is within me so not just partialities not just part but all that was Within Me bless His holy name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits will keep going actually so we'll see the benefits that we get from serving the Mighty God that we serve so who forgiveth all thy iniquities not not just some but all who healeth all thy diseases see we serve a god see when God does something he puts everything into it see a lot of times we like to just put something we'll pray we'll I'll put a little bit in here and a little bit there but when God does something he puts everything he created the world he put everything into it all his heart everything his word and I believe we need to be just like that when we pray put everything you have into when you read put everything you have into we listen to message to the hour put everything you have into it when you come to worship God and sing songs as I am put everything that you have into it no matter how you're feeling no matter the circumstances in life because the circumstances in life shouldn't affect how you praise and worship God how you pull on the word when you read you shouldn't let that affect you because we've come too far to let that affect us we reached uh such a high maturity to let that affect our walk with God verse 4 who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness that means like grace and favor and Tender Mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that youth is renewed like the eagles he said lay that wait upon the Lord that scripture the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto Moses and he's still making his ways known unto us today his acts unto the children of Israel the Lord is merciful gracious and slow to anger and plentiness and mercy he will not always shine neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities one more verse for as the heavens is high above the Earth so Grace is his Mercy toward them that fear him so just the importance of the fear of the Lord that reverence and respect to him that's what God is looking for as a Believer who could just give him reverence respect and adoration that's all God is looking for amen let's keep going we'll go to habaka 3 17-9 pastor always have trouble finding that scripture I don't know why so three of them go 17 through 19. so it says although the Fig Tree shall not blossom neither shall the fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall fail and the field shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stall so we can say we lose our job we lose our home everything's going wrong your family doesn't like you and look what he says right here yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will joy in the god of my salvation so the thing is you can't let the circumstances of Life control the way you're serving God because it's we get in such a habit of doing that and I'm guilty of it too so I put myself right there but we got to get in such a a place where we're not going to let that happen like we said before we're going to set that standard that that's not going to happen anymore because these things don't happen by accident God knew these things are going to happen it's a test and trial when you're taking a math test or a midterm whatever you want to say and you didn't study enough and you fail you gotta retake it again so God is trying to test us he's trying to build uh to build something that he sees inside of us he's trying to mold us and shape us to refine us like a diamond as we heard so let's keep going the Lord God is my strength notice that so you got to realize that he's my strength he's my rock he's my strong tower he's my deliverer he's my healer so God has to be personal to you and all these things in all these ways and if we recognize that he's all those things to us then we have no reason to fear we have no reason to doubt or to worry amen and he will make my feet like Heinz feet and he will make me to walk upon my high places to the chief singer of my string instruments amen so look the word up Joy is a Perpetual gladness of the heart that comes from knowing experiencing and trusting Jesus and then with that note we'll go to John 15 and read verses 10 through 12. you want to just kind of just because happiness see happiness is based upon the circumstances of life but joy isn't based upon circumstance of what's going on see Joy doesn't see the circumstances Joy knows that its strength comes from God so the joy of the Lord is my strength as it says in Nehemiah 8 10. so and we'll go to John 15 reverses 10 through 12. so it says if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments in abide in his love Luke verse 11 says these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you that your joy might be fulfilled this is my commandment that you have loved one another as I have loved you so we just see that a lot of time we can lose our joy sometimes and remember what David said he never lost his salvation but he said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation so sometimes life can just get to us it brings us down but we see that uh the righteous footsteps is order of the lord we even see if a righteous man fall seven times he gets back up so sometimes we just need that renewing that's why I love that scripture they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shallow with wings as eagles they shall walk and not Faith they shall run and not be weary and so sometimes we got to just go into the holies of the holiest and just get that refreshing get that renewing that we need sometimes so but we see that what Jesus said in verse 11 just that that your joy might remain but we see in verse 10 we got to be keeping his Commandments we got to be obedient to him sometimes we we want things from the Lord but we're not being obedient to them we're not following what he's called us to do and so you can't have the cart before the horse you gotta follow it God has made it God said in Simplicity sometimes we make it so hard we got if he says if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love and that's something not just doing it carnally but it's an intimate keeping his Commandments amen so like we said before happiness is based upon circumstances but joy it will stay if it's from the Lord it has to stay so we uh Nehemiah 8 10 then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto the Lord neither be sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength that's what your strength right there is you can't substitute it you can't compromise with it if you want that strength in that Joy you have to get it from the one who is a supplier of it and God is the only supplier simple as that cut and dry amen let's go to um Colossians 3 16. sorry Colossians 3 16. well we're going there well um I read a little quote this is from Jehovah of Miracles 1959 11 26 brother Brandon saying the statement right here one to what praise the Lord praise the Lord the joy of the Lord is our strength that's our strength that's how we live it's by the joy of the Lord that's in our midst so let's just never forget that so verse 16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom so remember last uh Sunday brother John said we got to submit to the word so and that's a form of worship when you're submitting to the word you're you're worshiping God because God and His word are one and the same so it says let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns in spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord see when we're singing to the Lord you're constantly putting him where he needs to be which is first place you're thinking about him you're meditating upon him in his word and that's how you you stay in worship is always surrounding yourself with Jesus Christ like that song we sung all that I think say and do all to be pleasing to the Lord so I looked up the word uh worship and praise because a lot of times we kind of just group it together you know we just mix it together but they're different so I looked up I got a couple definitions so worship is an expression of adoration and reverence it's reserved for God only notice that so we'll read in Exodus 23 you want to turn there Thou shalt have no other gods before me so anytime we put anything that we put before God is an idol as brother Branham said and so we can't put anything in front of God and we'll go to uh then we'll go to Exodus 30 14 for thou shall not worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous he's a jealous God so when worshiping a person submits himself completely before God see there's no partial submission it has to be a full submission it is a stance of humility and surrender in his position a person can align himself with God's will the Bible tells us to Worship in the spirit and in the truth so worship is different than praise in the Hebrew word uh it means to bow down to lower yourself worship is humbling ourselves before a holy God it's surrendering our entire life to him and then we go with praise is an acknowledgment and appreciation of what God has done for us and we give an example of we when I'm when uh God uh opened the Red Sea and the Israelites got before that and then Egyptians went in and God just drowned them and marry him and they were praising God they were just lifting up Praises but right after that when the water was bitter they started to complain see that that praise left they didn't have any worship and so it's easy to praise God when everything's going good when all the bills are paid when when uh everything's going good but worship has to come in then so it says so praise is acknowledgment and appreciation of what he's done for us it's our way of giving thanks to him God is worthy of our praise and we praise God we're saying he's worthy of our attention and Applause when we sing joy-filled songs of praises to God we recount all that he's done for us we thank him and show our appreciation for his work in our lives and we're acknowledging all the wonderful things God has done for us so we got to do both we can't we got to do we got to worship and praise because they they do go together but it's worship and praise so we got to do both of them just like spirit and in truth we can't just do one or the other we got to do both because they go hand in hand so he said before submission to the word is a form of worship because you are putting the Lord in his proper place which is number one and when we put him number one we are showing him how much we love him how much we adore him and how much we cannot live without him see a lot of times we like we said before we let our life situation get in the way of our worship to God we let the fiery Trials come in and just just tear us up and when we do that we we take our eyes off of Jesus Christ see we've got to keep our eyes on Jesus Christ during the trial because it'll make your trial that you'll recognize why the trial is there sometimes we have to encourage ourselves in the word take a look and see what the Lord says about you how much he loves you and cares about you how much he wants to strengthen you and give you Joy it's this song I like it it's called like encourage yourself I just read some of the lyrics from it says sometimes you have to encourage yourself sometimes you have to speak victory during the test no matter how you feel speak the word and you will be healed speak over yourself encourage yourself in the Lord sometimes you have to speak the word over yourself the pressures all around but God is a present help amen the enemy created walls check this one out but remember Giants they do fall speak over yourself encourage yourself in the Lord so it's not it's not a bad thing to encourage yourself remind you what has been given to you this word God has blessed us with he's given it to us and we have to claim it we have to believe it we have to have faith that it's gonna manifest in your life in this perfect time but you can't let the enemy uh just drench your faith you have to that faith has to just keep believing keep just believe like it's already happened and that's something we have to do so go to James 4 5. so James chapter 4 verse 5. so James chapter 4 and we'll go with verse 5. do you think that the scriptures saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us to Envy but he giveth more grace whatever you saith God resisted the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble so humility is so key it's worship when you're humbling yourself before almighty God you're worshiping the Mighty God says submit yourselves therefore to God so we're worshiping God it says when you submit then you can resist you can't resist and submit so you got to submit first then you can resist the devil because we got to remember it's not your strength that resisting the devil but it's God's Mighty strength that gives you the strength to resist the devil and it says and he will flee from you that's why Jesus when he came uh when he met devil in the wilderness and he tempted him three times what did he use the word and that's what we have to use is the word and God is his word and says draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts e double-minded humble yourself notice that word humble is being used again because it's so important to God can't work in your life unless first you humble yourself submit surrender humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up just like in a war the fighting doesn't stop until one party surrenders so we're in a war with the devil and we got to submit to be able to to fight this battle hey man amen humble yourselves inside the Lord and He Shall lift you up verse 11 speak not evil one of another brother and he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judges the law but if thou judge the law thou are not doer of the law but a judge let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9. so Paul was asking um something from God he he even said he has three times Thrice and Look What the Lord said to him in uh and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness we can recognize that we have human frailties and recognize that it's God's strength that gives us the overcoming power then that's when his strength is made perfect because we're recognizing it's his mighty hand his mighty word that gives us the victory in our personal lives that gives us the victory in our church that gives us the victory in all aspects of our life and he says most gladly therefore like grab will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me worship because you're glowing in the things that you're going through knowing that there's a specific purpose that is going to be done from those things so you're thanking the Lord thank you Lord for this growth that's going to take place at me just keep my eyes on you in this trial help me to see what things you're trying to shape and mold in me that you need to be shaping molding amen therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distress for Christ's sake for I am weak I am strong amen amen I'm gonna go to Acts 16. very familiar scripture Paul and Silas here so we'll start with verse 22 and acts 16. so it says and the multitude rolls up together against him and the magistrates run off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laying many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks just think about the predicament they were in they were witnessing to these people and they began to persecute them they begin to beat them and we're going to see their attitude because attitude is so key attitude is going to Def determine worship and praise and so we see their attitude uh as they're in prison and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises they weren't complaining man why are we in here man I'm in pain why we have to do all this but they were singing pray they prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard of them look at that testimony that the other prisoners could see that these people were bloody and beaten but yet they were still praising and worshiping God in their pain and so this if they if they can do that then how much more shall we able to do that we're not we're not in prison getting beaten and stuff yeah we may be like in a spiritual prison we could say but we're not in prison we've got freedom and liberty to worship God we live in a country where the freedom to worship the freedom to praise God so what excuse that we have we don't have to hide it we can express it the way we want to and so verse 26 and suddenly there was a great earthquake so at the foundation of the prisons were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loose and The Keeper of the prison and waking out of his sleep seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing the prisoners had been fled but Paul crowd's loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we all are all here then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thou shalt be saved and thy house so we have to believe that when we have unsaved loved ones and they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in in the house verse 34 and when he had brought them into the house he set meat before them and rejoice believing in God with all his house so just look at the attitude that they have the good Edge they have open opportunity to witness and to win a soul for Christ so to say we gotta look in the same thing Place ourselves in the same situation think about you having a bad attitude you're not gonna be able to be a proper witness to Witnesses somebody to win a soul so attitude is everything to God because we got to recognize that a situation is going to happen it's not the action but it's the re how you react to the situation what's going to determine the outcome so things are always going to happen in your life that are going to surprise you but it's determined how you react to him and that's between you and between you amen amen so one way to keep in worship is to keep the fear of the Lord in your life and so brother Braham said the statement how you treat others is how you treat God so if we're treating our spouse better or friend's bed or somebody we don't know bad then we're in a sense we're treating God bad he even said as you give unto my little one so you give unto me even a cup of cold water so it's so important how we're treating others in our life because if we keep that fear we will always want to reverence and respect the Lord and this is such an important thing and then go to John chapter 4 24. very familiar scripture we mentioned it a couple times already so it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen so it's such a such an important thing and we'll read a quote from Brother bran confirmation and evidence now let's see this let's now let's listen real close because I'm giving a moment of your time to get to the scripture remember that we must never come to church to play religious we mustn't come to put on your religious act to go to church we must notice that he says we must Come To Worship in the spirit and in the truth look who says we must deeply and sincerely notice that he's we don't just come to sit in the seat doesn't matter how we're feeling or what it is but we're coming to meet with the very maker and Crater of Heaven that saved us that took our feet out of the Maori clay and set our feet on the Rock to stay that's what we're coming to worship we must really mean what we're coming here for me one more time we must really mean what we're coming here for so we must come with a expectation to meet with God because he's here he's just waiting for us just to recognize that he is here for our hearts to be prepared to line up with him these days are getting evil the devil is trying to take all our time away he's trying to any way he can to get us to be distracted from God and the time is evil we want it says we want to make every minute count remember that one more time we want to make every minute count look what he says right here and especially when we're in the house of the Lord remember time especially when we're in the house of the Lord so just it goes such important to the preparation because we're not here just to be here but we're here to receive a direct word from God he has something for each one of us personally that can only be for you and so if we're not connected if we're not in the spirit then we're going to miss the very word that he has for us and and we're expected to receive the word if we don't receive the word then we're going to be held accountable for that because that word is going to transform you it's going to change you it's going to take you to a higher praise a higher worship we could say amen whatever he says to you do it 1953 let's say praise be to God praise be to God God is the word god means object of worship and God wants to be worshiped Jesus said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in what spirit and in truth through truth is what he said I am truth and here is tonight in our midst being truth the spirit vindicating his presence he's both spirit and in truth the woman says that's the truth the man says that's the truth then that's the truth you have no right to doubt it oh isn't he wonderful amen Amen to that amen this is a cellular song I really like it's called Hallelujah from the valley this is such a a deep song it says he loves to hear our Praises he loves to hear the Praises of his people he loves to hear Praises from the mountaintops but I believe it draws a tear to his face when he hears Hallelujah from the valley says hallelujah from the saint who with every who with pain and every heartbeat still lifts his hands and say I Will Bless The Lord at all times and it says no matter come what may Hallelujah from the valley Hallelujah in the pain in verse 2 says he loves to see his children Prosper he loves to shower them with blessings from above but when the rain is pouring down he is touched by the sound Hallelujah from the valley Hallelujah from the saint with every heartbeat so we just see that that Hallelujah from the valley is when everything when the pain is coming just like a rushing waterfall when everything's just closing in but you can still Worship the Lord God is so pleased and so honored with that he's going to give you just the strength that you need to overcome in that situation so we got to stop looking at our trial like it's something like it's like the hardest thing that's ever been we got to realize that we got to be resting in God we've got to labor for that rest see God has given us a place of rest but we don't want to do what it takes to get into that rest we've got to labor into that rest that he's given us and that rest is see the rest isn't something where it's being lazy in this laying back but the rest is giving you the strength just to keep going to keep seeing that Vision you got to keep that Vision before you see God has a vision for each one of our lives and we got to be be willing to just keep that Vision before us constantly because God has so much for us to do he God chose you for a specific purpose a specific reason he just didn't call you out the world just to call you just to set you off to the side but he called you to use you in a mighty way he called you to be a witness to all the uttermost parts of the world the only places that you can be a witness to and we're supposed to be an example to others uh the scripture tells us a living epistle and somebody might never read a Bible and you might be the only Bible they may ever read That's why Paul said became all things to all men that I might win some so we see the importance of us always just being connected and I know we're human beings we have human nature and we're going to make mistakes that's okay when we make a mistake you get back up and keep pressing forward you get back up and say Lord I'm sorry I'm not going to do that again so we got to get this I know human nature is going to be in there we're going to make mistakes we're not perfect see a lot of times like we Perfection Perfection let's go to Matthew actually it's not in the notes either but it's okay go to Matthew uh I think it's Matthew 5 actually so Matthew 5 48. so it says but ye therefore be therefore perfect even our as Our Father which in his Heaven is perfect now if you look at that in a carnal sense that's impossible it's impossible but the thing is uh this is I guess Mark's definition Perfection is knowing you're not perfect is the first step but striving to get closer and more intimate with God that's that's what Perfection is because you're striving to say Lord what things am I not doing that you want me to do what things should I take out of my life that's Perfection that's the type of perfection he's talking about because you're that much stiffer getting more in the image of God that much separate getting the more of the image of God and that's the key what Perfection is we're obviously we're not going to be perfect in these bodies because he didn't come to our demons but in here is what he's coming to redeem and so we got to just constantly just strive for that Perfection that he's telling us he said be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so God is calling us to be like him he's calling us to be servants and when you when you're obeying God you're entering into another step of perfection if we can say it that way amen amen let's go to go to John I'll go to John let's go to John's sorry Matthew 7 verse 7. we'll close here in a couple of minutes amen I'll go to Matthew 7 7. so it says ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh to receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open so I love how it says encouragements to pray and we got to just constantly this when we're on our knees just trying just wanting to enter into the presence of God that's worship because you want to just get alone with you and him that's just the key it's not just about saying your your daily prayers and you know getting up and doing your thing but it's about really getting intimate with God really meaning business that Lord I'm I'm here for you I'm not here just to say what I need but I'm here just to just to lift your name up on how I'm here just to say thank you for all that you're doing all that you have done and just we enter in that way you really can just enter into the presence of God because you're no longer thinking about everything that you need but you're but Matthew 6 33 is being Incorporated right here but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you so when you're doing that see when you seek God first if you read that chapter he knows everything that we have need of before we even ask him and so we shouldn't be worrying about these things we should be the only thing you should be worried about is just seeking him with all our whole heart not just when we want to seek him but when we but seeking him with everything that's within us and we see that you know in Deuteronomy 6 5 you can we go Deuteronomy 6 5 please I know I know it's a notes forgive me it says and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might just notice that with all we said before that when God does something he does it with all and when we do something we need to put our all into it all our effort all our time all our heart and that's all God is looking for is the heart condition like is this believer really putting all his heart or is he not got it's not something in the middle it's not like Switzerland where you can do you know 50 here then 50 later in the day but give a hundred percent see it's about the quality it's all about quality over it see a lot of times we put quantity first but I'd rather have you spend five minutes of quality time with God than you 45 minutes of this quantity and no quality because God is looking for the quality we see when Moses he said brother bran said this statement five minutes in the presence of God he knew more than he he knew exactly we had to do than compared to the 40 years and I'm not saying just just do five minutes and that's it but what I'm saying is if you have an idea of well I'll just spend 30 minutes and I'll be done with it today but no don't don't do that don't think that time can just take the place of that that quality what I'm saying is put quality into reading the word quality and listen to the message of the hour quality and witnessing somebody quality and discipling somebody because your time is so precious to God it's the greatest currency that God has given us is time because time is how you you build your relationship with God time is how you you build your your marriage build your friendship it all requires time work requires time saving money requires time so if you look at all these things that what time is required buying a car to pay it off takes time so we just see how important as Paul said to redeem the time because the days are evil and so we just see this importance and just in closing we didn't see the such importance of what worship is worship is something that's intimate something that comes from the heart something that doesn't just have to be done here should be done here it should be done in your homes in your cars it could be a Walmart it could be admirers Costco it could be done anywhere so don't just limit worship it's just one place but worship should be everywhere our whole life we need to be worshiping God and and like I said God knows we have jobs and stuff but you can still worship at your job and so we can just rise to our feet and we'll just um sing a little song like this song Here I Am to Worship here I am to bow down here I am to say that you're my God you're all together lovely all together worthy all together wonderful to me Here I Am to Worship here I am to bow down here I am to say that you're my God you're all together lovely all together worthy all together wonderful to me to sing it to him again here I am to worship here I am to bow down here I am to say that you're my God you're all together lovely all together worthy all together wonderful to me to sing it one more time here I am to worship here I am to bow down here I am to say that you're my God you're all together lovely all together worthy all together wonderful to me can you sing I bless his name amen
