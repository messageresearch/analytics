He wants to meet you inside your heart. He says I'll meet you there. I'll meet you in that place.

If you really love him, let's give a clap offering to Jesus. King Jesus. Hallelujah. He is our king. He is our savior. We love him. It's by his grace. His grace and his grace alone that we are alive. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Let us read a portion of the scripture before we sit down from uh the gospel in Luke chapter 13 and also read from Revelation chapter 1. Luke chapter 13. And let's read from verse 10. And I want to thank our pastor, brother John, for the opportunity given to me to be here this morning to fellowship with the saints. God bless you, brother John. And uh thank you, brother Ron, and the wife and taking care of me. I really appreciate that. Yeah, super care. Thank you so much. God bless you. God bless you, church. Thank you for coming to church. Re Luke chapter 13, let's read from verse 10. And he was teaching in one of the synagogue on the Sabbath day on the Sabbath. And behold, there was a woman which had the spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said unto her,"Woman, that had loosed from thy infirmity." And he lay his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight and glorify God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation Revelation 1 5 and 6. and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the praise of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; And have made us kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading of his holy word. God bless you. Let's be seated. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Oh yes, it is good to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is always a privilege to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we are here to let the devil know where we belong to. &gt;&gt; Yes. We belong to Christ. &gt;&gt; And we love to come to church. &gt;&gt; Our story is just like the blind man that they say was always holding the Bible. And so they wanted to make found of that blind man. They laugh at him and scoff at him. And this blind man, what are you holding? He said the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible. He said, "But blind man, you cannot read it." He said, "But I believe it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "I believe it from silver to silver." That's from cover to cover. He said, "Because on the cover it is written, Holy Bible." &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "I believe it from cover to cover." He said, "Well, I want the devil to know which side I belong to." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So it's good. Don't be ashamed to hold a Bible. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody will No. No. Don't be ashamed of it. Praise the Lord. Hold the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Carry it. Don't be ashamed because to carry it alone is a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know I like uh sometime to wear the you know I have my heart with the Jesus scriptures on it and sometime I try to wear tie like this and then just when I was coming and I was coming to Ohio and then I got out of the plane and a man met me he said are you a minister you I said yes I am of course this way saw the tie so he said let's pray we just stood aside said I'm on a mission Commissioner, let's pray. And he just prayed for me. We pray together. And I said, "God bless you. Go ahead." I just left her and I was wearing another tie. The lady said, "Oh, I like your tie." And I wear the cap with Jesus on it. Oh, I like your cap. And I said to myself, if you don't want to hear Jesus, then you read about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You read on the T. &gt;&gt; I want everything to testify of Jesus Christ. I'm never ashamed of him &gt;&gt; because people put on their cap with all kinds of golf and this and that on it. Why should I be why should I be ashamed? Put put on something with Jesus on it. I would never be ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would never be ashamed of it. If people can wear caps and wear this and all kinds of displays on it and they were freely, &gt;&gt; why should I be afraid? Amen. &gt;&gt; Why should I be ashamed &gt;&gt; to put something with Jesus on it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what are we doing? We advertise Christ. &gt;&gt; We are be boss. &gt;&gt; So in every aspect, in every way, every opportunity that we get, we want Jesus to be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Though they might not want to hear it, they might not want to listen, but we become the living Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. and want every expression of ours to glorify him. &gt;&gt; So saints of God, never be ashamed of the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of it. Paul said, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the power of God unto salvation &gt;&gt; to those who believe it. To the Jew, to the Gent, everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we have to exalt him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to glorify him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to let the word know who what we believe &gt;&gt; and that we love him. We are his representatives on this earth. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said he has no hands but your hands and my hands. &gt;&gt; No eyes but my eyes and your eyes. No hands, no feet but we are his representatives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So may God help us always when when the opportunity is around. Let us express him. Let somebody know &gt;&gt; when you get to the restaurant to eat, don't be ashamed to pray. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the food he has given you. &gt;&gt; And let them know you are praying. No, because but it's part of our lives. &gt;&gt; That's why Daniel was praying day and night. &gt;&gt; And they knew Daniel prays. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they give order that nobody should pray. When you want to eat, don't pray. Whatever you want, don't do it. Just your petition, you must ask from the king. Then they say not me. I will pray everywhere. I will pray every time because the Bible says pray with that season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In season and he said pray. Hallelujah. We want to exalt him. We want the word know that we have for Jesus. He has redeem us and we belong to him from time and to eternity. So in everything we do, whatever we find ourselves to be, in the school, in the market, in whatever, in the mosque, everywhere we want them to know, we belong to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Never ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Woman that are to lose from thy infirmities. &gt;&gt; May the Lord Jesus lose us. &gt;&gt; Amen. from all our infirmities, &gt;&gt; from our thinkings and our ideas, &gt;&gt; from anything that is contrary to the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we read the scripture that Jesus went to the synagogue. He was teaching in one of the synagogue on the Sabbath. So one thing is he start he goes to church after he walk around doing the father's business everywhere he go everywhere he went he was doing good &gt;&gt; oh the mighty healer &gt;&gt; he cleans the lepers he set the captives free oh Jesus said I must be about the father's business &gt;&gt; and he walk here and he go there but he still find time to go to church because God goes to church Amen. Yes. Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; So he went to church. Amen. And it is always a blessing to go to church anyhow. Whether it's winter, whether it's summer, whether it's hot, whether it's cold, it is always a privilege &gt;&gt; to go to church. &gt;&gt; So the scripture tells us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together. For it is always a privilege. Think about it. A privilege to go to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what, it is always a privilege. It is an honor. Oh, to go to church to gather together with men and women of like precious faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our faith is precious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. May the Lord be with us and help us. &gt;&gt; Yes. And so this woman, the Bible said, "And behold, there was a woman which had the spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself." So that woman might be in this kind of condition for 18 years. But my joy is that in that condition she was going to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She could have had excuse &gt;&gt; she could have given an excuse. &gt;&gt; You remember the scripture told and God told them how they should come in God's provided place of worship. How they should come into unto church. how they should bring their sacrifices, where they should enter. But that's the God of Israel. &gt;&gt; He said when you are bringing your sacrifice to me, he specify exactly what sacrifices should be brought to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How they should bring it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And where they should enter &gt;&gt; that shall not enter into any but pass through this gate. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he shows us the gate and there is just one way. &gt;&gt; I am the way. &gt;&gt; I am the truth. I am the door to the sheepfold. Jesus is the door. &gt;&gt; It is the only gate of entrance. &gt;&gt; It is the provided way of entrance. It is the acceptable way of entrance. And Jesus nobody can come to the father except by me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the only way. He is the only truth and he's the only life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God said, "Enter in through this gate." Hallelujah. There there's one gate that is approved by God. Hallelujah. One gate. No two, not three, no four. There is no salvation given unto anybody except the name of Jesus Christ. No matter your religion, no matter what you think and what you think, there is just one way. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. What shall we do to be saved on the day of Pentecost? And Peter said, "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall have the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off and as many as the Lord our God shall call." Hallelujah. That's the only way and that is the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is only the only way today and forever. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus went to church. So what would be our excuse? Because he goes all over the place. He's just working. He's just preaching. And then on the Sabbath day, he goes to church. And so that's not the first time he went to church. He has been going to church. Or you even remember, we remember the story when they took him to the temple at the age of 12. He was young and they took they went to to church that day and then the parents left him behind. &gt;&gt; They left him behind &gt;&gt; at the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was not in hurry to leave the church. He was left behind. And they went three days journey and they were and before they came to themselves where is the word? Where is Christ? Oh today many people have made a journey without Christ. &gt;&gt; Sometime we come to church we hear the word of God and we leaving right and go ahead. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; We hear the word oh that's wonderful but then we leave it right and go back. And they went away and three days after 3 days all they remember where where is he? Where did we leave him? And the Bible said they begin to sort him among the acquaintances among the Methodist and the Anglicans and the denominations and they found and they didn't found him. He was not in the Methodist church. He was not in the Anglican church. He was not in the Baptist church. He was not in the only of these denominations. I said, "Where did we find where where can we find him?" And they went back to where they left him. &gt;&gt; And they found him where they left him. &gt;&gt; And remember, you always find him where you live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the word. He never changes. Hallelujah. Oh, and they found him and they said, "Oh son, I and your father, we've sought you with tears." You and who? What did he say? &gt;&gt; He said, "Mary deny the supernatural birth of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Only a prophet can teach that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Mary denied the supernatural birth because now she said Joseph was the father. &gt;&gt; But in the beginning said, she was conceived by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? And now she said, "I and your father sought you with tears." And right there Jesus said, "Must must I not be about my father's business?" &gt;&gt; If Joseph was his father, he would have been at the carpenter shop. &gt;&gt; So the word of God correct error. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus corrected Mary. That's why she cannot be the mother of God. &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mary was just an incubator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A vessel that God choose to use just like any of us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus, the word corrected her right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word is to straighten our thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so why we come to church is so that the word will straighten our thought &gt;&gt; because brother said people have been taught scripture in a certain way. &gt;&gt; People have been taught scripture in a certain way. So when the messenger comes on the scene, the messenger is to bring their thought back to what God's word is. &gt;&gt; And because the messenger teaches according to the spirit of God, they think that the messenger is rather wrong. But the correct the right and the correct interpretation of the word of the Lord comes to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Women that are loosed, we are loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But my joy is that this woman in this condition maybe with a stick in her hands she was able to go to church and she had been in that condition for 18 years and maybe the devil was telling her are you still going to the synagogue in this condition why don't you just stay you cannot even walk and you've been going there all this years. Oh, where is your Jehovah? The Jehovah who did those things is not the same again. &gt;&gt; Why don't you stay home? &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; That will tell you that days of miracles are over. That would tell try to discourage you. Of it will never encourage you. and he tried to discourage. You've been going to church for long. What has happened to you? You've been giving your sacrifice. You have been offering. You are tithing. You and this happened to you and you are sick and you have been praying and it is nothing is happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, something is happening. &gt;&gt; Your prayers is being saved over there. Yes sir, &gt;&gt; you are banking it. &gt;&gt; And our prayer come before God as a sweet smiling &gt;&gt; ser. &gt;&gt; He breathe it. &gt;&gt; He's happy when the saints are praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He enjoy to hear you praying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He That's why the angel came to Zachariah and the angel said your prayer has become a memorial. &gt;&gt; God has heard your prayers. &gt;&gt; It has become a memorial. Oh hallelujah. Oh, praise the name of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the devil that tells you it's all in vain. Like I always said, you know, when you have prayed, you have met the requirement of God, then rest assure that God is just testing you. The widow of Zeraphat, that widow pray, that widow pray in the time of famine, in the time of need, when the whole nation was under the wrath of God because they've left the word of God. Remember, there is one thing that causes the Lord's displeasure. That is when we leave his word. And the only thing that will make us to gain his favor is back to the word. &gt;&gt; May God help us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so God Elijah has spoken the word of the Lord. Elijah has made a decree, a declaration. He said, "There will be no rain, no due till I call for it." &gt;&gt; Till I call for it. No rain, no due. Think about it. a man of light passion. He made a decree &gt;&gt; and God stood right behind it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then God told Elijah, "All right, what I'm going to do here is uh you go to the brook brook sheriff. &gt;&gt; I will be there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will take care of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, the ravens, the bears, they will come and feed you. &gt;&gt; Oh, the bears. Huh? The best. Ah, &gt;&gt; he was free from superersistence. If it was me, well, God said the rabbins, rabbins, ravens will be feeding me. Oh no, but they were God's servants. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God can use anybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any time because he's God. &gt;&gt; So listen, the gospel comes to free us from superstitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you where did they where would they get the food from? That's not my business. &gt;&gt; That was not Elijah's business. God said, "I have commanded them." &gt;&gt; And they will feed you. Oh, hallelujah. He's our God today. He's the same yesterday. And he has a way. He knows how to take care of his children. &gt;&gt; He knows how to provide. He can give you a very good doctor, a very good physician, a very good surgery, a very good surgeon, a very good friend, a very good sister. Hallelujah. Because he owns the whole word. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good, man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. He knows how to do it. &gt;&gt; Trust the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter the condition, no matter the state, no matter the situation, no matter what might be happening around us, may God help us to trust Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He comes to free us from superstitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From fear, from worry, from doubts. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, help the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Woman that are freed &gt;&gt; I've commanded the reverend and they feed you there. And Elijah went there and they see that in morning and evening they were bringing food to the prophet. &gt;&gt; He just bring food. He take it and eat it. Was not worried about somebody has poison me. Where did they get this from? That's not his business. God said &gt;&gt; God said &gt;&gt; I have commanded them you'll be taken care of and that's saying God is our God today &gt;&gt; oh is God &gt;&gt; God help us to believe &gt;&gt; you know God called Cyrus King Sarah said my servant he called Nebuchadnezzar my servant is God and Saros had a burden and he said look among you Israelites who church of God you People of God, who among you will go to Jerusalem and build a temple for your God? He has commanded me, he has laid on my heart to build a temple for him. &gt;&gt; And who among you is people, we go and do the work. &gt;&gt; I will make sure you are protected and you are taken care of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who among us will surrender. Who among us? God's people, we believe. Who among us? God's people will take the burden. Who among us will give the sacrifice? Who among us will give himself? Lord, here am I. &gt;&gt; Send me Lord I will. I will go. Praise the Lord. What a mighty God we are serving. Yes, &gt;&gt; I've commanded the raven to feed you. And he stayed by the brook sheriff and he and for you number of months or whatever year he was there until the water was the water dried up because &gt;&gt; somebody was praying somewhere. &gt;&gt; God could have kept the water running. &gt;&gt; He could have kept the water running &gt;&gt; and the birds and the revenants will continue to feed them. But there was a soul some were crying. &gt;&gt; There was an elect crying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God said to Elijah, "Okay, now move from here." &gt;&gt; Sometime we came to a place we become complicent. We become we get used to the place. &gt;&gt; It it becomes our comfort zone and we don't want to leave our comfort zones. We are so used to the place and we want to stay there. But God leads us one step above the the other. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. He called Abraham to come out of his comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Come out from your nation. Come out from your kindred. I will show you where to go. Leave your comfort zone. And sometime he want us to leave our comfort zone so that it will show more to us. &gt;&gt; That it will reveal more to us. That it will take us to higher heights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my way of life. This No, no, no. I want God's ways to be my way. &gt;&gt; Let God choose for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let God lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us say yes to God. &gt;&gt; Because he led Abraham. The Bible said he didn't know where he was going. Cuz he come out from your family, from your nation, from your kindred. I will show you where to go. He didn't know where he was going, &gt;&gt; but he obeyed &gt;&gt; because he knew it was God. &gt;&gt; And when God start a work, he will complete it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; And Abraham obeyed and he was following one step at a time. One step at a time. One step at a time. Let's follow one step at a time. &gt;&gt; We sing the song. Where he leads me, I will follow. &gt;&gt; Where he leads me, I will follow. I'll go with him. I'll go with him. Where he leads, I will follow. May God help us &gt;&gt; to follow his leadings. &gt;&gt; Amen. He might lead you the way you might not want to go. &gt;&gt; He might lead you in the way that it might make you look stupid or foolish or crazy in the in the sight of your friends, in the eyes of your neighbors or your colleagues or your among your your peers or your whatever. What are you What are you doing? What are you doing? The mother asked Abraham, "Where are you going?" I don't know. So why are you going? Because he said, "I should go." &gt;&gt; He said, "I should leave." &gt;&gt; To go to where? I don't know. But he is leading. So he will lead me where he wants me to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Abraham obeyed. And that's why it was imputed unto him for righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was accounted unto him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when God spoke to him, he believe it and he obey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not knowing where he was going, but he went &gt;&gt; and that's why today is our father, the father of the faith. &gt;&gt; If the father of the faith was led that way, what about the children of Abraham? the same way. May God give us grace to be like our father, like father, like son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elijah was going. God said, "I've commanded a widow woman to feed you." And it was just going and it was just going and it was just going and it was just going and then went to a place and he saw a lady Poor woman. What woman? The whole nation was in crisis, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then a letter saw this woman there, old woman of whatever state she was. Say, "Excuse me, madam, can you give me some water to drink?" &gt;&gt; Cuz he has to contact the spirit. You have to start conversation from somewhere. The prophecy, I'm trying to contact a spirit. He said Jesus spoke to the woman. Woman, give me water. He was contacting a spirit. Was trying to pull into some conversation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woman, can you please give me water to drink? Oh, okay. Meanwhile, it has not been rain for three years or many years or months. No rain. So, can you give me Okay. Okay, sir. I'm ready to share whatever little I have to share. And he just go and he said, "Uh, and excuse me, madam. And give me a little bread, too." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "Sir, look at me here. I'm just left with a little oil and a little bread. The meal is so little. The oil is so little. And I'm here. They've been speaking out of a weak voice because everybody was hungry. Everybody has been thirsty. And uh there was there was crisis. I I'm I'm just gathering two sticks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I I my son and I we will prepare the little that I have uh that we will eat. That's our last meal and die. and die. They were at the point of death. We just take the little we have and we die. Oh, God came in at the right time &gt;&gt; at your wit end. When all around my soul gives way, &gt;&gt; he is there my hope and stay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rock of ages &gt;&gt; cliff for me. &gt;&gt; Let me hide my certainty. &gt;&gt; We just eat and die. And the prophet look at it. God sent the prophet to a woman that was ready to die. They have their last meal to eat and die. &gt;&gt; And the prophet look at it. Don't worry. You just go prepare the meal and give me mine first. Thus say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the oil and the meal will not finish until God send rain upon the earth. &gt;&gt; You don't know when it's coming from but it will come. &gt;&gt; Don't reason. Don't try to imagine it. &gt;&gt; Only believe. &gt;&gt; And trust the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When all around my soul gives way is my hope and stay. Right. &gt;&gt; He knows what to do. He knows when to step in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Step on the sea. He knows. &gt;&gt; If only you will trust him. If only we believe him. If only we rely upon him, he will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Woman that loosed. Amen. And he met this woman like Hallelujah. And I'm happy she was going to church. What about that day? If she had not gone to church, &gt;&gt; what about if she had not gone to church that day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about she said, "I'm tired of going to church. Maybe pass through, drive through the snow, or maybe h you know, rough road this and whatever situation, whatever reasons. And I have to um my last money I have to use to take a car or my last money I have to use to do this and I don't even have the strength. Our strength cometh. &gt;&gt; He is our God. They that wait upon the Lord &gt;&gt; shall renew &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; their strength. &gt;&gt; They shall mount up with wings as eagles. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These things are written for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; For our admonition, for our strengthening. Oh, hallelujah. Because the word of God comes to anoint us, to inspire us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, come. Help is on the way coming. Deliverance is on the way coming. &gt;&gt; Our God is on the way coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's coming. &gt;&gt; Help is coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might not know how it will be coming, where it will be coming from, but our help coming from above. &gt;&gt; Your help is from above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one that is up there is our help. &gt;&gt; Jehovah is our help. &gt;&gt; Jehovah is our strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. In that last hour when the last meal was about it's almost gone. God came on the scene. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the oil never finish and the meal never finish. And they keep on eating and every morning there's something there. Every morning give us this day our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Every morning was providing &gt;&gt; and he will continue to provide for us. &gt;&gt; He will never leave us to go hungry. That's why we have spiritual food in due season. That's why he has stored the food for us. And every day he provides for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She was in this condition. I'm glad she went to church. One of that day she had missed the service. Oh, sometime the devil tell you are too tired to go to church today. You work so much the last week. You work so much in the week. You did so much. Yeah, you did it. But what about God's own? &gt;&gt; Whatever we did in the week. Yeah, I was busy throughout the week in the shop, in the office, in this and that. God also want his own portion. &gt;&gt; Why do we give excuse when it come to God's time? You would not want to lose a day's job or you want to miss church service. The prophet God said the prophet of God said it is good to miss a day's job &gt;&gt; and to miss your servicemen. &gt;&gt; You can't say amen to that. You're not ready for that. &gt;&gt; But this check mean so much to you than coming to church. And I'm telling you the God of Elijah, he's still our provider. &gt;&gt; Which good thing we try to reason how can this be? We are in a different world, a modern word here and there. But God remains the same God. &gt;&gt; The God of Abraham remained the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as we continue to use our might and our ideas and our feelings, we will never see God's glory. Like I always said to be when he sees you have prayed, you've prayed and he sees nothing is coming. The devil will tell you, "No, you know you are not a good believer. God does not care for you." But it's a lie. I know he cares. &gt;&gt; He cares for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if he doesn't come, he's caring for us. Why? Because when he's silent, like I said, you go to school, the teacher instruct us, they teach us and they give us lectures and they do this and at a point the teacher don't speak again. It's quiet. Though he might be in the class, but he's quiet. When he's quiet, that means you are being tested. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When God is quiet, he's testing us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and you pray say well I don't see anything he's testing us &gt;&gt; and when there is test no question when you are being tested you don't say pir I I got a question put your hand down when there is test there is no explanation &gt;&gt; can you please quiet no explanation &gt;&gt; because the explanation has already been done &gt;&gt; the word has already been declared the mind of God has already been declared and you'll be tested on every ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God allows us to be tested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, sometimes in life we face storms. But do you also know that it is not every storm that comes to destroy? Sometime a storm comes to clear your path. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A storm comes to clear some things out of your way. Things happen in your life to clear some things out of your way. Yes, &gt;&gt; that is God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might not see it that way. It might not mean that, but at the end you will see that all things work together for good &gt;&gt; to those who love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is God. He allowed things to come to humble us, &gt;&gt; to teach us patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To teach us his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I've said, I've said it here before. When I was 26 years, so I lost my wife. I just married for one year. the sister passed away. I was already a believer. Oh my goodness. It was such shattering, heartbreaking. This one year and it was so hard. It was so difficult was crying. And this one thing came to me. God don't make mistakes. Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; And I said, Lord, if this is your will for me, I will serve you. I will still serve you. I will save you. And this is over 40 years now. I thank God for grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; He blessed me. I married again. I have five children. &gt;&gt; It was difficult. And the people say, "Oh, this boy will not be able to serve God." This and that. And there was a lot of superstition because in Africa somebody died with she was even expecting and I lost both mother and child. And they said this will not be able to serve the Lord again. This will be drinking and smoking. This would be this and that and that. But thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My uncle head. &gt;&gt; My ankle head. I said Lord if this is your will I will still save you and the enemy said if you married again if you don't practice or do some superstitious things if you don't do this if then if you married again your wife will die again I said I will not do that I will not go no superstition &gt;&gt; you have to do this you I said I'm not going to do that because the Bible said till death we do part &gt;&gt; that's what the Bible says that's what I believe &gt;&gt; and I stood there and the price my front left and right you have to do I'm not going to do it and I said if my God is not able to take care of me I'm ready to die &gt;&gt; but thank God he has kept me alive &gt;&gt; he has kept me alive and he's still keeping me he gave me a wife a beautiful wife he gave me beautiful children four boys and one girl his grace is sufficient &gt;&gt; he has a purpose to mode our lives &gt;&gt; to mold our character &gt;&gt; to teach us his way to teach us patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Patience is a virtue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham waited with patience. Noah waited with patience. And you and I, we have to wait with patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the promise of God is manifested, is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "Why should it be me? Why shouldn't it be you? That's my own question. Why should it be you? Why shouldn't it be you? Do you always want to read about Job and Job went through this? What about your own story? &gt;&gt; And I preach one time I said, "Listen, your trial is your testimony." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The trial you go through is your testimony. &gt;&gt; Job had a trial. Abraham had a trial. Moses had a trial. All these trials is the testimony that we are feeding on today. &gt;&gt; And as long as God is still calling, his people will have trial. Because brother Brown said the more loyal you are, the more the test. He said if you have a test, you have find favor with God. &gt;&gt; And God has confidence in you. &gt;&gt; And God knows you will stand the test. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, God knows you will stand it. &gt;&gt; It might be hard. It might be unbearable. But God knows you will stand it. &gt;&gt; For the Bible says he will not give us one trial too much to bear. &gt;&gt; Believe the word. &gt;&gt; Believe the word. &gt;&gt; When we believe, the anointing of the word comes upon us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Give a clap of offering to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Hallelujah. Woo. Great is Jehovah and greatly to be praised. &gt;&gt; Woman that are loose from your infirmities. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came to set the captives free. And he saw this woman there been like this for 18 years in that condition. &gt;&gt; And God knew all about it. And God knew that day she'll be set free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he got there, he look that loosed. To be loose is to be released, &gt;&gt; to be unt &gt;&gt; to be free, &gt;&gt; remember this. Sin, unbelief put us into bondage. &gt;&gt; What cause sickness? Sin cause it. What is that? Unbelief. Sin cause it. Doubting of one word of God cause it. And if he cause it in the beginning, it will always cause it. &gt;&gt; God don't want us to doubt his word. &gt;&gt; God want us to believe his word. &gt;&gt; God wanted to stay with his word. No matter how it sounds ridiculous, &gt;&gt; he wanted to take him. And I read the Bible after the fall. Look, the Bible say whatever God created in the beginning, God said it was good and this is good and that is good and that everything was good. &gt;&gt; When the four came, God said the earth is cursed. It will no more bring forth the way it's supposed to do again. &gt;&gt; And God said it will bring forth tones and test us. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's what God said. &gt;&gt; After the fall, the earth will no more bring forth the way it's supposed to bring forth. &gt;&gt; And today, you can see what we are eating today is death. &gt;&gt; From that day, death set in &gt;&gt; when the word was questioned. When the word was questioned, they questioned the infalliability of God's word. Did God really meant it? Is this true? What can we do anything upon it? What can we do? Can we change it? Can we add to it? Can we take something from it? It cause death. And whenever we inject our thoughts, our feelings, our reasons into what God has says, it brings us into bondage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You become a slave. You are in bondage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why we are in the condition we are in today. And I read the scriptures and I said when Mo Joshua and Calb when they went to Kadeshbania and they when they said the grapes that they caught, two of them has to carry it. &gt;&gt; Two men carried it. &gt;&gt; Two strong men. And I was thinking how was it in the garden of Ed? What was the size of a mango there? What was the size of a papa there? Papa, what was the size of this there? Original before sin came in. How was things over there? And ever since, look at it. Everything is death. Today the ground, the land cannot even bring forth unless we fertilize it. So all that we are eating today is death chemicals because they cannot come on. And you take it from the saw, you put it down, then it goes bad. It goes bad. But thank God the earth shall be loose also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when man fell the earth, everything went down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why the earth is being redeemed to the same process by which we are redeemed. Water, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The earth is going through the same process. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because our final dwelling place will be on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride is here. &gt;&gt; And I see I saw a new Jerusalem coming down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The former things will no more be remembered again. &gt;&gt; There will be no more sea. &gt;&gt; We will not need a sunlight for the lamp of God shall be the light of that city. It's a city prepared by God for a prepared people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. The earth shall be redeemed and the redeem of the Lord &gt;&gt; shall come and dwell on here. &gt;&gt; That's why in the days of Noah, God baptized the earth with water. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Justification. &gt;&gt; In the days of Jesus, he shed his blood to sanctify the earth. Right. &gt;&gt; The next thing is fire baptism. &gt;&gt; Fire baptism. That's why today you hear of nuclear weapons. &gt;&gt; Nuclear weapons. The whole world is raising for nuclear weapons. This one is everybody and there are people that have it and he's just waiting for one crazy man to press a button and it will spark a chain of reactions. We are there. We are there. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You see nation gathering against Israel. You see nations gathering against Israel. This one said this one said this one said that. But God said I will plant them in their land and nobody can remove them. &gt;&gt; No no no no nation no power. Let them be millions of Hamas or Iranians or whatever weapons any nation we have. Israel will survive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jehovah who fought for Israel yesterday years is still fighting for Israel today. &gt;&gt; Do you know 12 day war Iran war you know what the Iranians said after the war? They said Israel use otic power. They said there was a supernatural power that Israel used. Yeah. Not ultis the power of God. How can a small nation like Israel survive fighting seven nations or seven different fronts more than them? The nations were more the people are more than Israel. &gt;&gt; More more 10 times or 100 time more than Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have their weapons. They have their weapon. They have their mas. They have everything. How can Israel survive if it had not been Jehovah God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They said Israel they said their enemies said it that Israel use otic power. Today this is current. &gt;&gt; Yes. It was the power of Jehovah God. &gt;&gt; And if the power of Jehovah God stood behind Israel, what about the bride of Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The power of the most high God is behind us. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will build my church &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against him. You will have trials. You will have challenges. You have forces fighting against you. But they will never prevail. &gt;&gt; They cannot prevail &gt;&gt; because we are chosen by God. We are elected by God. And God is defending us. &gt;&gt; What did the Bible said? &gt;&gt; A th000 will fall at your side. 10,000 at your right hand, but shall never come near you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will see your enemies fall. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your enemies you will see God will raise up people to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they came with all their score missiles and we Hey, there were other nation fighting for Israel. Send their air defense systems. Even Jordan was doing it. Even Britain, even France, they all saying it to defend Israel. Yes. I will give you mothers and I will give you fathers. Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, Bible days are still with us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This boy is crazy. That's okay. I always people always thought I'm crazy, but that's okay. I don't worry much about what people think. I'm happy when I'm in the service of the king. &gt;&gt; They say Israel use power. It's not otic power. It's Jehovah God. Because how can Israel survive if it had not been God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can Israel Hey, Israel is the only nation that does what no other nation does. Even in their battles today, only Israel when they are coming to fight, they say, "Hey, civilians move from here. We are coming to work there." &gt;&gt; Russia don't do. Russia has been throwing missiles to Ukraine. They don't care about who is there, whatever is there. But Israel will tell you no move from here. Only Israel does that. They said listen they thought we cannot go to Rafa. We they thought we cannot go here. They said don't go to the tanners. Don't do this and that. He said we'll do it. And we did it. Oh, don't attack Iran. Don't do this. They said we did it. We will do it. Oh, if you do it, I'll be. They've done it. Israel have done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel have done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What every nation was afraid to do, Israel has done it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, fear no little flock. It is your father's good way to give you the kingdom. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why are looking at me like what is this boy talking about here? Yeah. I'm not looking at you. I'm looking at God. I'm feeling very good. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, these things are true. These things we are is real. For you to know that our God is real. Our God is alive and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; But the reason is that many of us are tied down. &gt;&gt; You must be loose. &gt;&gt; There was a donkey when Jesus was going to Jerusalem. It was tied. &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the go and lose that donkey &gt;&gt; and bring that donkey to me &gt;&gt; and I will ride on it. You must be untie. And when we untied, he rides on us. &gt;&gt; We become the donkey. I want to be a donkey for Jesus to ride on me. Ride to Jerusalem. Ride. Ride. Keep riding. Oh, hallelujah. That you'll be a voice, a voice to Jesus. A life to Jesus. All eyes to Jesus. A a weapon. A an instrument. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have to be untied first. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to be loose first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a go to that. Lose that donkey. If any man ask you why didn't the master need it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We must be loose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Woo. Glor. When Lazarus was raised from the dead, he came out with his grave clothes on him. Jesus said, "Lose him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let him go. &gt;&gt; Brother, it might be loose. and come out of your own ideas. &gt;&gt; Loose from superstitions. &gt;&gt; The prophet said here, "The greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Ghost." that Jesus died at Calvary to free his church from superstitions and fear &gt;&gt; and doubts and tremblings. He lives today. He rose from the dead. He is alive tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Yeah. Ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To lose the church. To free the church from superstitions. &gt;&gt; Amen. from fear, from worry, from doubt. &gt;&gt; Fear is a curse &gt;&gt; because of fear. Ah, he tormented. But Christ came. The Bible say he never giveth a spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they give it a spirit of adoption. Spirit of sons and daughters that we can cry aba father &gt;&gt; sons of god free &gt;&gt; loose &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the bible says unto him that love us and washes from our sins. Brother said that word wash means to lose. Amen. Unto him that love us and wash us from our sins in his own blood. The word wash there actually in the Greek means to lose. &gt;&gt; He lose us. We were tied to the earth by our sin. We couldn't see. We couldn't hear. We had no conception of heaven. But when the blood came down, it cut the line and we got loose. &gt;&gt; It cut the line. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we were tied down &gt;&gt; in denominations &gt;&gt; with man-made ideas. &gt;&gt; We're in fear &gt;&gt; just like in the Bible, the blind boy born blind for years and Jesus came and lose him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees came to his parent, is that your son? Yes, he's our son. How come that is he? We don't know. He's of age. Ask him. He said because the Pharisees had warned the people. Anybody that would testify that Jesus Christ is the same. That Jesus is the healer. That Jesus is the savior. That Christ is alive. That Jesus is the same yesterday. Anybody that will testify that that Jesus is the Messiah, we kick him out. So he asked his parents, "Is that your son?" Yes. Yes. So how come there? We don't know. Yet they knew. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But for fear, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Losing their right in church, &gt;&gt; their position in church. &gt;&gt; The church don't give eternal life. But this is what they have thought that the church gives internal. When you leave the church, you don't have eternal life. Khalich believe they have the eternal life. Oh, they preach on purgatory and all kinds of nonsense. Thank God for Martin Luther. He was loose to lose the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church was tied down. Martin Luther said the just shall live by faith and the people of God were loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They lose the people. They had freedom. &gt;&gt; We are not going to pay no money for purgatory. We're not going to The purgatory is now. That's where we are now. We are purging ourselves. Death does not change a man. No amount of prayer will change a man after death. &gt;&gt; The only thing that will change us today is hear the word of the Lord. Hear his voice. And when you hear the voice, you are loose. &gt;&gt; You're free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luther came to loose them. You don't have to pay any money. And everybody was afraid. Oh, Luther. He say, "Hey, here I stand." Unless you can convince me by the scriptures. Yes, stand. I'm not recounting nothing. Here I stand on the word. The word says so. That's what the Bible say. The just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Salvation is not by Roman pope or by any pope. No, salvation is by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are justified by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not by words. &gt;&gt; He was loose &gt;&gt; to declare the counsel of God. No. When Apostle Paul said, "I I I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; It is the power of God unto salvation. &gt;&gt; It's the word that loses us. It's the word that sets us free. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hey, today there are many people in bondage. They cannot help themselves today. The men and women in our country and everywhere else has sold their self onto sin, drinking, gambling, carousing and doing things that they ought not to do &gt;&gt; and become slaves to the devil. Brother, I met a lady, a young lady here not long ago. She said, "Oh, Brother Abraham, I did give everything if I could only break this band of whiskey from me." Bound. People are bound. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Look at all over the people are bound. Slash. See there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See the way they dress. See the way they do. See the things they are doing. It's unbelievable to think if you have lived maybe 20 years back or even 30 years or to think that women will come to this spot that human beings will be living the way they are living. &gt;&gt; That young men will be dressing the way they are dressing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the days of brother Brown preaching against things were not like this &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; Brown said the people will go insane &gt;&gt; for the coming they will go and the people are crazy. They are bound. &gt;&gt; They are helpless. Amen. &gt;&gt; They can't help themselves. They are doing things they don't even know what they are doing. &gt;&gt; They become slaves to the system. But thanks be to God, the blood was shed to losers. &gt;&gt; Once we were like them. Once we were slaves. Once we were in bondage. Once we we were sold to denominations. We were sold to Christian dogma. My church say this. My church say this and we were not free. But Jesus shed the blood on the cross of Calvary to lose us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yo, your man, I come that you see." He said, "A man called Jesus. A man called Jesus. A man called Jesus made clay and put it over my eyes." And he said, "Go and wash your face and see &gt;&gt; a man called Jesus." &gt;&gt; Have you met that man? Amen. &gt;&gt; What did that man did for you? That man set me free. &gt;&gt; That man lose me. That man delivered me from organizations, from Christian dogma, from the things of the world, from drinking and smoking, from womanizing, from all the foolish life. That man called Jesus, he set me free. He lose me. That same Jesus lose you. That same Jesus set us free. That Jesus is worthy to be praised. That Jesus is worthy to be adored. Oh, hallelujah. And they told that man, "Give glory to God. This man is s is a sinner. We don't know where that Jesus came from." He said, "Once I was blind, but now I can see how you are hypocrites. &gt;&gt; It's a sin the world began. Have you seen a man that was born in sin? Open the eyes of somebody that was born blind. Now I can see the way you are. Yes, I can see you. You are hypocrites. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know whether this man is a sinner. &gt;&gt; Thank God for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Thank God for a message. &gt;&gt; How can you say William Brown taught? How can you tell Brown was a false prophet? A man that taught us the will of God. &gt;&gt; A man that taught us to love Jesus. &gt;&gt; A man that taught to esteem the word of God above everything. &gt;&gt; A man that glorify Jesus. A man that the people said this man live Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He preach and he live it. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Loose. Hallelujah. We are loose by the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. I don't know what the time is, but I'm going to try and run up. Praise the Lord. But even even if we don't finish, we can stay stay here the whole day because I came from far. &gt;&gt; We've had a whole week for ourselves. If we have come here, we must have time for Jesus. &gt;&gt; People go to the stadium football games. How many hours do they spend there? &gt;&gt; Sometime they have to get extra extra minutes still playing and the people are still there. We don't want extra time here. We want more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are not they are not say amen again. They're ready to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe we need some extra time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that they shoot penalty, they play the 90 minutes, they play extra time and then when there's no winner, they go for penalty shoot. Yes sir. Amen. So sometime we can go that way. Amen. They are quiet again. Don't worry. I'm not going to keep you. But what I'm saying that you are loose. &gt;&gt; God loses us. &gt;&gt; That God will have the preeminence in our lives. &gt;&gt; That we give God honor. That we be flexible in the hands of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we can Lord not my way. Let our way be done. Lord guide me. &gt;&gt; Sometime we we limit the most high God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we giving a program and Lord, we want you to stay this way. And so after let him lead us, &gt;&gt; let him guide us. Let him go and let us follow him. &gt;&gt; People are bound today. They cannot help themselves. &gt;&gt; See the women cut their hair. She didn't wear pants. She didn't paint their faces. Sometime in the play before they play, every woman said, "What is that?" The people cannot help themselves. They cannot. They are bound. The men drinking and smoking and and walking naked. Everybody is naked. So I got to be naked. What's that? &gt;&gt; They are bound. See grace upon us. We are just like them. They are just like us. But what is the difference? Christ lose us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ freed us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are free. Free to think for ourselves. &gt;&gt; He loses. &gt;&gt; I'm loose. That's why I'm standing like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. The prophet said, "Unto him that love us and wash from our sins in his own blood." Oh, you remember he told a story about the crow, Johnny Crow, he said, "And the crow was caught by a man because they were running around the field and eating and wasting the crops in the farm." And then what? He caught one. The farmer caught one and tied. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Stay here. And he stayed there and he just hopping around here and there. And so somebody came in. He said, "Sir, this crow is a crow. You know, the only way he eat is by this. So please let the crow go." And so the good man spoke on behalf of the crow. And the crow was loose. It cut the line. &gt;&gt; But it stay so long. In that condition days of miracles are over. God cannot do it again. &gt;&gt; Denomination is everything. And other crows came winter is coming. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I cannot go. I'm tired. He said, "No, you're loose." The good man Jesus came to lose us. &gt;&gt; Yes. When we're tied down by denominations and traditions and superstitions and churchianity, church spirit and Christian dogma, we could not help ourselves. &gt;&gt; We were slave. We were driven to the drunken bars and drink and and the woman dressing and we were all doing those things. But one day the good man caught the rope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus caught the rope on Calvary. The rope was caught. &gt;&gt; Say you can be free. Just like Israel when golad had them in bondage, David came and cut the rope. Come on. &gt;&gt; What they thought would never be done. When the rope was cut when David slain golat, all those men became free. &gt;&gt; They were free from fear. &gt;&gt; They were free from worry. &gt;&gt; They were free from doubt. &gt;&gt; Now they know all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Now they know it can be done. And the Bible said all the men of Israel that were afraid before they went after the Philistines, they went after their enemies. Oh, they took their sticks. They took their whatever. They ran after the Philistines and they slaughtered them. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were loose from fear. &gt;&gt; Jesus losers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. You are loose &gt;&gt; by the blood. mist when Jesus died on Calvary he said it is finished he paid that price every human being was loosed there but remember every human being was given a pardon but a pardon is not a pardon until you accept it &gt;&gt; we were not saved yesterday or 10 years or because brother Brank no we were saved before the foundation of the word &gt;&gt; Christ came in to lose us in our day &gt;&gt; with the message of the hour the gospel came to lose us. &gt;&gt; Is for us to accept the pattern that was given. &gt;&gt; Covering made a declaration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We were loosed by the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. Let me try to read this. Get out of your way. Oh my goodness. Loose from our sins in his own blood. Isn't that wonderful? But are you spiritual minded? Did you catch it? It was his own blood that lose us completely from our sins. Take note of that. Completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood lose us completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From our sins. &gt;&gt; He that is born of God sinnth not. &gt;&gt; It cannot sin. &gt;&gt; Because the seed of God remainth in him. &gt;&gt; You cannot disbelieve the word of God. &gt;&gt; The devil is a liar. &gt;&gt; We have been loose. from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listening, you have to accept the word of God. We have to accept what God says. You have to leave your ideas and your thinking. When God lose us, he lose us from our reasons so that we can take the word. Listen, listen, church. The word comes to correct error. the world come to teach us. It is not what American government or any government Africa says is right that is right. &gt;&gt; It is what the Bible say is right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not whatever Americans we have this right. African we have this. No, it's not like that. It is what the Bible say that is right. &gt;&gt; And that's why God sends his profit. &gt;&gt; So that our mind will be corrected. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God is. So when we hear the word it means if our thoughts and our ideas are contrary to what God says we have to drop our ideas &gt;&gt; because the word come to set us free. &gt;&gt; Oh this is right. The Bible say what you think is right is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the Bible says is wrong is wrong. &gt;&gt; No matter how it has been done in years for many years it's wrong. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Oh I don't see anything wrong with it. You don't see anything wrong with it. But the Bible say it is wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh woman preacher and woman too can preach. A woman can do this. Bible say it is wrong. &gt;&gt; I suffer not a woman to teach &gt;&gt; not to assure authority. That's the Bible. Oh but when the woman preach this and that sign Bible say is wrong. &gt;&gt; So it is not what you say is right. It is what the Bible say is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why God rejected the sacrifice of Cain. And God told Cain, don't you see what Abel has done? &gt;&gt; Forsake your way and take the will of God. &gt;&gt; That's why God came to lose us. &gt;&gt; That we can think for ourselves. &gt;&gt; That we can see heavy. That we can see the word &gt;&gt; that we can live by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen. Did you catch it? It was his own blood that lose us completely from our sins. It was not human blood. It was the blood of God. Peter called it the blood of Christ. Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus. Not three person but one person. There is that revelation again. One God that omnipotent Jehovah came down and made himself a body by the revel by the means of the virgin birth and end it that it might be the blood of God that will free us, lose us entirely from our sins and present us spotless before himself &gt;&gt; with exceedingly great joy. Will you like an Old Testament type? Let us go back to the Garden of Eden. When the first news came to glory that the son Adam had fall had had been lost. Did God send an angel? Did he send a son? Did he send another one like unto us? No. He came in safe &gt;&gt; to redeem that that lost son. Hallelujah. Did God not ent he said God did not entrust his plan of salvation to another? He trusted only himself. &gt;&gt; God was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us unto himself. &gt;&gt; We are saved by the blood of God. &gt;&gt; The eternal God in dwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin. He became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the into the veil with it. Consider this. Take note. Consider this. The prophet said, "Consider this. Since it is the blood of God, it is perfect blood. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if the perfect blood is loosening us from the power and bondage and definement of sin, then the loosening is perfect &gt;&gt; and complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The loosening is perfect and complete. &gt;&gt; There is now therefore no condemnation. Who shall lay anything to the child of God's elect? It is God that justifith, declares us righteous. &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died. Romans 3, Romans 8:33, 334. &gt;&gt; There it is. The death, his death gave us the blood. The blood has lose us. There is now therefore no condemnation. How can there be? There is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin. We are free. Guiltless. Don't listen to man. Listen to the word. &gt;&gt; Listen to the word. The word says you are free. &gt;&gt; The word say you are guiltless. He that believe on the Lord is free from sin.

Now, don't get tied down again by traditions and Christian organizations. Don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word of God and deny that Jesus Christ saves his and fills with the Holy Ghost and power. You are God's free man. God's free men. God's free men. Lose by his own blood. If we still hold your faith to Christian dogmas, it is certain by the evidence that you have lost your faith in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Don't lose your faith in the word of God. &gt;&gt; God be with us. Church woman that lose. &gt;&gt; He lose the church. He lose us from worry, from fear, from superstition, from doubt. We are free. Listen, don't let the devil torment you with death. You are going to die. No. If I die, you know, you know, a Christian don't die. &gt;&gt; Christian never dies. Christians only say goodbye. &gt;&gt; Christians only fall asleep. We will leave here for the new place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have if this earthly tac tabernacle is destroyed, we have one already. Christians don't our loved ones that have gone they are not dead they are waiting for us &gt;&gt; so don't let the devil torment us we lose us from fear you lose from from superstitions we are free &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; I'm telling you maybe you don't here you don't know what about superstition but you talk about Africa there's a lot of superstitions &gt;&gt; I'm telling there's a lot of superstitions &gt;&gt; if you hold on to that you will never make it &gt;&gt; I'm telling you like I said when I lost my super position. Don't do this. You don't have to sleep on your bed because when you sleep on your bed, your wife will come and lie by you or your husband will come and lie by you and they have to do this and that. I said, "I'm not going to doing nothing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they speak and my father was speaking my ah they said no no no my father you have to listen to me. I said no I have to listen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; I was 26 years old and all this was being bombarded left and right. Do this. Now I said the Bible said the Bible says till death will do part. I don't I'm not going to do anything. No. If you don't do it and the spirit will come and lie. I said let her come. My wife I love her. If she want to come she should come. You have to dismantle your bed. As I'm not going to dismantle my bed. I will sleep on that same bed. &gt;&gt; Amen. No. My father said I am your father. You have to listen to me. I am the head of the family. I said hey you are the head of the family. I'm also head in my church. Why do you want me to listen to you? Well, if you don't listen, you will die. Say, then let me die. If my God that I'm serving is not able to protect me, let me die. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go. And until God has finished with us, nothing can take us. &gt;&gt; We lose. You are loose from fear. You are loose from worrying. Why do we worry? He said which of us by worrying can add one inch to our earth. He said if we cannot do that which is list why do we worry ourselves? He said there is no victory in worrying. All the power is in faith. &gt;&gt; So have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are loose to believe God &gt;&gt; to stay with the word of God.

Lord, I don't know what to do about this, but I leave it in your care. I know you know how to do it. I will get over here. You are the one that will do it. When they made the Red Sea, they didn't know what to do, but he know what to do. Don't worry. Divide it. Go. He knows. So why do we worry? Why are we taking things from his hands?
