[34:54] god bless you
[34:59] luke chapter 9 starting with verse
[35:01] number 23 this is a familiar scripture
[35:06] and jesus said to them all so he wasn't
[35:09] leaving anybody out
[35:12] he said if any man will come after me
[35:14] let him deny himself take up his cross
[35:19] daily
[35:20] and follow me
[35:22] for whosoever will save
[35:25] his life
[35:27] will end up losing it
[35:29] but whosoever will
[35:32] lose his life now for my sake
[35:35] the same shall save it eternally
[35:39] for what is a man's advantage if he
[35:41] gained the whole world and lose himself
[35:43] or be a castaway
[35:45] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me
[35:49] and of my words
[35:51] of himself shall the son of man be
[35:53] ashamed
[35:54] when he shall come
[35:56] in his own glory and in his fathers and
[36:00] the holy angels
[36:02] amen god bless you may be seated
[36:06] say god bless you to those that are live
[36:08] streaming today
[36:10] missing some of the saints
[36:13] i'd like to
[36:16] title this message standing up for jesus
[36:20] for a subject
[36:22] i want to take not embarrassed to follow
[36:24] more of the word than i'm presently
[36:27] following
[36:29] i believe in in that statement i could
[36:31] say that
[36:32] there's certain things in our life that
[36:34] were
[36:35] we really need to be
[36:40] bore four
[36:42] and if it wasn't true we'd be out of
[36:44] here
[36:47] and it would be uh a disgrace for any of
[36:51] us to think i'm there i'm just waiting
[36:53] on somebody else
[36:56] i believe
[36:57] that's why we come to the house of the
[36:59] lord is to
[37:00] to see let the holy spirit speak to our
[37:02] heart if there's anything else he wants
[37:04] to to move up in to take a stand in
[37:08] the bible tells us that every man
[37:11] that's born into this world
[37:14] is born without jesus
[37:17] and he's heading straight to hell
[37:20] in man's greatest currency we learned
[37:23] is time
[37:25] in other words our days are numbered
[37:28] and if he spends all of that time to try
[37:31] to gain the whole world
[37:33] he would literally be a cast away from
[37:36] jesus
[37:38] jesus said for whosoever shall be
[37:40] ashamed of me and my words of him shall
[37:42] the son of man be ashamed of when he
[37:44] shall come in his own glory and his
[37:45] father and the holy angels
[37:49] i don't want to be ashamed of him
[37:52] we're living in the worst age known to
[37:54] mankind
[37:56] we've never seen a spirit of such
[37:58] deception confusion as strong as it is
[38:01] today
[38:03] jesus said that many false spirits would
[38:06] arise in the last days and shall deceive
[38:09] many
[38:10] and because rebellion would abound the
[38:13] love of many what wax code now i'll put
[38:16] in a couple words there but they are
[38:18] exactly what they mean to help us see
[38:20] that rebellion can happen to any of us
[38:22] at any time for any reason
[38:28] we got a believer here how many believes
[38:30] that
[38:33] believers are more in love with
[38:35] themselves today than they've ever been
[38:38] bolsters in the church proud unthankful
[38:43] it was prophesied we see it happening
[38:45] men who are once believers have fallen
[38:48] away from the faith
[38:50] giving heed to seducing spirits
[38:53] second timothy 3 13 says evil men and
[38:55] seducers shall wax worse and worse
[38:57] deceiving and being deceived
[39:01] there doesn't
[39:02] paul didn't give timothy a whole lot of
[39:05] hope for the world
[39:08] the world can't give us hope right right
[39:11] amen our only hope can be in jesus
[39:15] many who stay in church
[39:18] are are battling spirits of laodicea
[39:22] right
[39:22] lukewarmness
[39:24] some some believers are at ease in zion
[39:28] and they're they're loving the pleasures
[39:30] of of of uh loving the pleasures of this
[39:33] world more than being a a loving the
[39:36] pleasure of serving god
[39:39] exercising their rights with their
[39:41] attitudes that they don't need nothing
[39:42] they don't need anybody to tell them
[39:44] what to do
[39:48] but jesus said he would spew the
[39:50] lukewarm church right out of his mouth
[39:51] why because they're not taking a stand
[39:54] with the fire of god amen that's right
[39:59] the bible says that he will laugh
[40:01] one day at their calamity
[40:04] brother branham said people are afraid
[40:06] to stand today he said don't be afraid
[40:09] to make your stand for god
[40:11] if you don't stand for him you'll stand
[40:14] alone
[40:17] this age is the worst age to be living
[40:20] in if a man is not standing up for jesus
[40:24] first peter chapter 5 verse 8 says that
[40:26] her adversary the devil is a royal line
[40:28] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[40:33] who will the devil devour
[40:36] the person who's not taking a stand for
[40:39] god the man who's not on fire for god
[40:42] amen
[40:45] he'll devour your joy
[40:48] your peace
[40:50] your love your patience your tempers
[40:52] he'll he'll devour your faith that's why
[40:54] we got to exercise your faith that's why
[40:56] we got to
[40:57] believe every word of god and and say
[40:59] amen to the word of god and this is a
[41:02] chance for you to exercise your faith
[41:04] muscles
[41:06] the world is completely deceived
[41:10] satan has them at arm's length
[41:12] and as soon as the bride is taken off
[41:15] the earth hell is going to erupt right
[41:17] on the earth
[41:18] just like a volcano
[41:20] tribulation
[41:22] will never
[41:25] tribulation is coming it's the world has
[41:27] never seen before
[41:28] it's going to be so bad so chaotic that
[41:31] men will actually
[41:33] want to die they would rather die than
[41:35] go through what they're going through
[41:37] think about how hard that would be
[41:40] and a man who's not standing with god in
[41:43] this age
[41:44] will surely be
[41:46] devoured there is
[41:48] no
[41:49] purgatory
[41:51] there is no holding place there's no
[41:53] waiting ground this is this is our
[41:56] chance
[41:57] to stand for the lord
[42:01] it's the worst age to be living in if
[42:03] we're not standing for jesus
[42:05] but yet it's the greatest age for the
[42:07] believer who loves standing up for jesus
[42:11] because the greater the evil the greater
[42:14] that you're able to express how much you
[42:16] love god by standing up against it
[42:20] in this lukewarm
[42:21] age
[42:23] where iniquity is bounding
[42:25] will you take a stand
[42:30] psalms 94 verse 16 says who will rise up
[42:34] for me
[42:35] against the evil doers
[42:38] or who will stand up for me against the
[42:41] workers of iniquity
[42:43] so my question is will you stand more
[42:47] it's easier to stand against certain
[42:49] things that you are strong in but we
[42:51] need to take the whole word of god amen
[42:55] noah lived in the age we're nothing but
[42:57] evil was continually on the hearts
[43:00] and minds of the people
[43:03] but he wasn't ashamed
[43:06] god asked him to do something that the
[43:08] world had never done never seen
[43:10] and he was an oddball
[43:13] for about 120 years he preached the same
[43:16] message
[43:17] that god is going to come and destroy
[43:19] the earth
[43:20] and no one believed him
[43:23] but he kept preaching he kept preaching
[43:25] and you know what he didn't preach it
[43:28] he lived it
[43:29] he built an art for 120 years
[43:32] he was showing that what he preached he
[43:35] believed in
[43:37] it wasn't but just his family right
[43:40] that came in
[43:44] jesus said in mark 8 37 what shall a man
[43:47] give in exchange
[43:50] for his soul
[43:52] whosoever therefore will be ashamed of
[43:54] me and of my words now look at this in
[43:58] this adulterous and sinful generation
[44:02] of him also shall the son of man be
[44:04] ashamed when he cometh in his glory of
[44:07] his father and
[44:09] with
[44:09] the holy angels
[44:11] so here jesus is talking about the
[44:14] adulterous and sinful generation
[44:18] standing up for jesus may seem like an
[44:20] easy thing to do
[44:22] expressing to someone in private that he
[44:25] is your savior
[44:26] you've accepted him as your personal
[44:29] savior
[44:30] or letting someone know that you go to
[44:32] church on sundays or that that you're a
[44:34] christian but there's so much more to
[44:35] standing up
[44:37] to jesus
[44:38] than those things
[44:42] there are other words that the gospel
[44:44] tells us about
[44:46] that we could be ashamed of there's
[44:48] things in this bible that we could be
[44:50] embarrassed about
[44:52] like being too embarrassed
[44:54] to wear the right clothing
[44:58] to keep the makeup off our faces
[45:02] to say that we're in the message of the
[45:03] hour to be associated with certain
[45:06] individuals
[45:08] maybe too embarrassed to be baptized in
[45:10] the name of jesus christ
[45:13] maybe too embarrassed to really love a
[45:15] certain person it may be just easier
[45:17] just to laugh and kind of walk away
[45:22] maybe too embarrassed to to just lay
[45:24] down our lives for a certain individual
[45:26] because we just got something against
[45:29] them
[45:30] maybe too embarrassed to come to the
[45:32] altar too embarrassed to seek more of
[45:34] the holy ghost if i go to law somebody's
[45:36] going to think i don't got any i don't
[45:37] got the holy ghost if i go to the altar
[45:38] and pray
[45:44] jesus says if we don't deny ourselves
[45:48] we're really ashamed of christ
[45:54] brother braham said the word ashamed
[45:56] here means embarrassed
[45:59] whosoever therefore shall be embarrassed
[46:01] of me
[46:02] and
[46:04] embarrassed of my words
[46:07] this is what i wanted us to focus on
[46:10] this morning is the words of christ
[46:14] some reason people seem to separate the
[46:16] two and you can't
[46:18] brother branham said and that's the way
[46:20] that so-called christianity today but
[46:23] when it comes to accepting the
[46:24] fatherhood of the word christ no they're
[46:27] embarrassed
[46:28] he said another thing being ashamed does
[46:31] it shows that you're not sure what
[46:32] you're talking about
[46:36] if you know what you're talking about
[46:38] you have assurance that you know what
[46:39] you're talking about you can tell
[46:42] anybody that you're not ashamed but if
[46:44] you feel put out or out of place it
[46:47] shows that you're not sure
[46:51] many times i've encountered people who
[46:53] who are simply too embarrassed to follow
[46:55] the word
[46:57] because no matter who you're talking to
[47:00] not just your children
[47:03] not just your parents not not just
[47:06] somebody that's younger and you in the
[47:08] lord but no matter who you're talking to
[47:10] there should be something in your heart
[47:11] to see that person come up higher in
[47:13] christ amen and if it's not you it
[47:16] should be the god that lives inside of
[47:17] you
[47:19] and god wants to use each and every one
[47:21] of us to bring each and every one of us
[47:23] up higher
[47:25] brother braham says when a man ever
[47:27] meets god
[47:29] not in some emotional workup some
[47:31] enthusiasm or some religious doctrine
[47:34] some catechism or creed or dogma that is
[47:37] accepted for a comfort for himself
[47:41] but when he comes to the place like
[47:42] moses did on the back side of the desert
[47:45] walk up face to face with almighty god
[47:48] and you see the voice
[47:50] speaking to you
[47:53] exactly what the word
[47:55] and the promise of the hour is there is
[47:58] something it does to you see
[48:01] you're not ashamed of it it does
[48:03] something to you
[48:06] and that's what we need
[48:08] we need more of an encounter with the
[48:10] holy ghost the living word of god
[48:13] to come to church and try to receive
[48:17] man's words across a pulpit to be a
[48:19] better person
[48:20] that just means somebody much smarter
[48:24] much more intelligent can come by and
[48:26] talk you out of it but when god speaks
[48:28] to your heart and you know it's from him
[48:31] there ain't a man on the earth that can
[48:33] talk you out of it
[48:36] amen
[48:37] and we need that if we're going to stand
[48:38] for him because we're all going to be
[48:40] tested
[48:41] we're all going to be tried
[48:44] truly standing up for jesus means
[48:47] standing up for his word
[48:50] his word is the highest order of
[48:53] absolute amen heaven and earth shall
[48:55] pass away but god's word shall never
[48:58] pass away
[49:00] it's absolutely in vain to stand up for
[49:02] jesus without standing up for his word
[49:07] a man standing for jesus but ignores the
[49:09] bible is really not standing for jesus
[49:11] he's just deceived
[49:13] it's literally impossible to separate
[49:17] jesus from the bible amen
[49:20] what
[49:21] what are we going to be judged by
[49:24] everybody thinks i'm going to be judged
[49:26] by jesus
[49:29] and he's going to judge me
[49:31] i i know he's going to judge me fairly
[49:33] because he just loves everybody
[49:36] and they got this image in his mind
[49:39] their mind that that there's something
[49:42] special
[49:43] that that's going to happen in their
[49:45] favor on the day of judgment
[49:47] come on i'm just i'm just speaking as it
[49:50] is the thoughts that we think
[49:53] the bible is going to judge mankind
[49:56] at the white throne judgment john
[49:58] chapter 12 verse 48 write this down now
[50:01] jesus speaking here he said he that
[50:03] rejecteth me
[50:04] and receiveth not my words
[50:07] have one he didn't say two he didn't say
[50:10] three he said have one that judgeth him
[50:14] the word that i have spoken
[50:16] the same shall judge him in the last day
[50:19] in other words god is not going to come
[50:20] on the white throne judgment and judge
[50:22] you with a different word
[50:25] a different set of circumstances a
[50:27] different age it was already the word
[50:29] that was spoken in the bible that's what
[50:32] we're going to be judged by amen
[50:36] did you know the bible wasn't written
[50:38] with any of man's private interpretation
[50:42] second peter chapter 1 verse 20
[50:45] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[50:47] the scripture is of any private
[50:49] interpretation
[50:51] uh so i don't i i don't really care what
[50:54] you think about the scriptures
[50:57] for the prophecy came not in old time by
[50:59] the will of man
[51:01] but holy men of god spake as they were
[51:04] moved by the holy ghost
[51:07] we i'm sure i remember when i was in the
[51:09] world
[51:11] but i'd listen to music and i'd get in
[51:13] the spirit of that music
[51:15] whether i was listening to the moody
[51:16] blues
[51:18] or neo diamond
[51:19] or alice cooper
[51:24] and today we can even listen to some
[51:26] gospel music some good old gospel music
[51:29] and it really just kind of picks you up
[51:32] well these men when they wrote this
[51:35] it was the holy ghost
[51:37] that was inside of them that was moving
[51:39] them to pen exactly the mind of god
[51:43] it wasn't mixed with their thoughts
[51:47] god got him out of the way and moved in
[51:49] and took control
[51:51] to give us confidence today in the word
[51:53] of god
[51:56] ii timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says all
[51:58] scripture is given by the inspiration of
[52:02] god
[52:03] and is profitable for doctrine for
[52:05] reproof for correction for instruction
[52:07] in righteousness that we the men of god
[52:10] may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto
[52:13] all good works
[52:15] we don't need anything but the word of
[52:18] god to complete us amen nothing
[52:22] god has protected his word through the
[52:25] ages and times and he stands by every
[52:28] word in the bible amen
[52:30] and he'll vindicate it to be the
[52:31] absolute truth
[52:34] but you have to believe it
[52:36] amen
[52:37] if you don't believe it
[52:40] you'll never know it to be the truth
[52:42] unto the day of judgment
[52:44] and then you will know you will know on
[52:47] that day
[52:48] look the devils believe and they're not
[52:50] even believers right it's true
[52:53] think about that
[52:55] they believe but they're not even
[52:57] believers they're not christian
[52:58] believers
[53:01] but they know
[53:04] and they tremble amen they why do they
[53:06] tremble because they know it to be the
[53:08] truth
[53:10] but they're not rejoicing when the bible
[53:12] is being preached
[53:15] i mean the devil comes to church he
[53:16] doesn't say amen to the word
[53:19] you know what he says oh he's pointing
[53:21] at you
[53:22] he's directing this at you
[53:25] oh he's calling you this he's calling
[53:27] you that
[53:28] the devil comes to church to try to
[53:30] confuse our minds
[53:34] but the holy ghost inside the believer
[53:36] says amen to the word of god
[53:40] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[53:42] me and of my words in this
[53:45] adulterous and sinful generation of him
[53:49] also
[53:50] shall the son of man be ashamed
[53:58] the more you stand for god's word the
[54:00] more you'll be standing for jesus
[54:04] i know you think well i can't stand
[54:06] anymore for jesus than what i am but you
[54:08] can
[54:09] find somewhere in the word that you need
[54:11] to be doing and take a stand for it
[54:13] you'll be showing jesus i'm standing for
[54:16] you because outside of this word trying
[54:18] to convince
[54:20] anybody that you're standing for jesus
[54:22] it's
[54:22] vain it's true that's right
[54:27] what good would it be
[54:29] gotta get over here
[54:31] what good would it be for me to slap
[54:34] brother mark on the face and say i love
[54:37] jesus
[54:41] just because i feel in my heart that i
[54:43] love jesus
[54:46] when really i i need to let him hit me
[54:50] and still wash his feet
[54:54] by this shall men know
[54:58] that you're not ashamed of standing for
[55:01] the love of god amen
[55:05] the name of jesus is powerful amen jesus
[55:08] said in my name they shall cast out
[55:10] devils
[55:12] do you know the bible says in acts
[55:13] chapter 4 verse 12 that there is no
[55:16] other name under heaven given among men
[55:19] whereby we must be saved
[55:21] it's only through the name of jesus
[55:25] peter said in acts chapter 2 verse 38
[55:29] repent and be baptized every one of you
[55:32] in the name of jesus christ for the
[55:33] remission
[55:35] of sins
[55:37] and you shall receive
[55:39] god in spirit form
[55:42] that's what the holy ghost is
[55:45] not titles
[55:47] jesus never wanted salvation to come
[55:50] through his titles
[55:52] he intended salvation to come through
[55:54] his name amen he meant what he said in
[55:57] matthew chapter 28
[55:59] verse 18 and jesus came and spake unto
[56:02] them all power is given unto me he was
[56:06] he was he was trying to first he was
[56:08] setting the the foundation look i call
[56:11] the shots
[56:14] all power is given unto me
[56:17] and he said go
[56:19] teach
[56:20] and baptize them
[56:23] in the name
[56:25] singular
[56:27] of the father and of the son and of the
[56:30] holy ghost well what is the name of the
[56:32] father and the son and the holy ghost
[56:36] jesus meant what he said and the
[56:39] apostles carried it out amen
[56:42] ephesians chapter 3 verse 15 says that
[56:44] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[56:48] named after jesus
[56:50] in fact whether we're family or not the
[56:53] word of god says in philippians chapter
[56:55] 2 verse 10 that at the name of jesus
[56:58] every knee should bow of things that are
[57:00] in heaven things on earth and things
[57:02] under the earth and that
[57:04] every tongue should confess that jesus
[57:06] christ is lord to the glory of god the
[57:09] father
[57:14] the name of jesus is above every other
[57:17] name amen
[57:20] there's not only power to cast out
[57:22] demons but there's power to change a
[57:24] nature amen
[57:26] and that happens when you're listening
[57:28] to the word of god
[57:29] and your heart says amen i want that for
[57:31] my life
[57:34] that's
[57:34] this word is jesus amen
[57:37] and when you're believing the word it
[57:39] can change your nature
[57:42] but did you know that god places
[57:43] something
[57:45] even
[57:46] above
[57:47] his name
[57:51] i know
[57:53] it's hard for me to believe it too but
[57:54] it's the truth
[57:56] turn with me to psalms 138 verse 2.
[57:58] that's why we need to study to show
[58:00] ourselves and proof
[58:03] psalms 138 verse 2 i will worship toward
[58:06] thy holy temple and praise thy name for
[58:09] their lovingkindness and for thy truth
[58:11] for thou has magnified thy word
[58:15] above all thy name
[58:17] think about that
[58:19] amen
[58:20] his word is honored above his name
[58:27] have one that judgeth him the word that
[58:29] i have spoken the same shall judge him
[58:32] in the last day that's how important the
[58:34] word of god is to take a stand for the
[58:37] word amen not just say i'm standing for
[58:40] jesus i'm standing for the word
[58:42] i'm standing for every page
[58:44] not just the promises but the
[58:46] commandments
[58:48] come on not just for what i want to
[58:50] stand for but i want to stand for all
[58:52] that jesus believes in and all that
[58:54] jesus is
[58:56] amen
[58:58] too often people will stand for the name
[59:00] of jesus but will ignore the very words
[59:02] that he said
[59:05] if we don't stand for the word we're
[59:07] really not standing for jesus if we're
[59:09] ashamed of the word we're ashamed of
[59:11] jesus
[59:13] we cannot separate the two amen saint
[59:16] john 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the
[59:18] word and the word was with god the word
[59:20] was god
[59:22] amen that was the logos word it was a
[59:25] pillar fire it was the same pillar fire
[59:27] that led the children of israel it was
[59:29] the same pillar fire that paul met on
[59:31] the road to damascus that's what was in
[59:33] the beginning
[59:34] verse two the same
[59:36] was in
[59:38] the beginning with god the word
[59:41] amen in verse 14 that word was made
[59:44] flesh and dwelt among us
[59:49] and we beheld the glory the glory of the
[59:51] only begotten of the father full of
[59:52] grace
[59:53] and truth amen
[59:55] now we've got to accept this bible to be
[59:58] jesus christ himself in word form amen
[1:00:02] we've got to
[1:00:04] it's his letter to us
[1:00:06] how to be saved and how to stay
[1:00:09] continually blessed
[1:00:11] you believe it and you watch it become
[1:00:13] manifested in your life now there are
[1:00:15] benefits when we stand up for god's word
[1:00:19] the bible tells us that god's word will
[1:00:22] save us it will protect us it will heal
[1:00:24] us
[1:00:25] it will guide us it will lead us it will
[1:00:27] comfort us
[1:00:29] it will cleanse us put us on the right
[1:00:31] track psalms 119 i'm going to take all
[1:00:33] these scriptures from psalms 119. this
[1:00:36] is a good chapter to read when you get
[1:00:37] time verse 9 says wherewith shall a
[1:00:40] young man cleanse
[1:00:43] his ways
[1:00:44] it's a good question
[1:00:46] by taking he thereunto according to thy
[1:00:49] word
[1:00:52] verse 41
[1:00:54] let thy mercies come also unto me o lord
[1:00:56] even thy salvation according to thy word
[1:01:02] it has to be according to the word the
[1:01:04] bible says in ephesians 5 verse 26 that
[1:01:07] that god will sanctify and cleanse us
[1:01:09] with the washing of the water by the
[1:01:11] word so it's okay when we come to church
[1:01:13] and we're hearing the words say boy this
[1:01:15] is just not making me feel good
[1:01:18] you know a lot of times i get up and i
[1:01:20] take a shower now you i really do that
[1:01:23] every day i don't want it
[1:01:26] but you know when i get up and i take a
[1:01:27] shower i don't like look forward to it
[1:01:31] i'd rather stay in bed
[1:01:35] i look forward to brushing my teeth
[1:01:39] but you have to do it right
[1:01:42] and a man when he walks through the
[1:01:43] course of the day he gets thoughts that
[1:01:45] are wrong that are evil that he he
[1:01:47] begins to to take ties with the enemy
[1:01:49] and he doesn't realize he gets tripped
[1:01:51] in and he needs to get cleansed of that
[1:01:54] and the word is here to cleanse us and
[1:01:57] wash us and it's okay it's a good
[1:01:59] feeling when you get when you finally
[1:02:01] get out of that shower and you put some
[1:02:03] clean clothes on you feel like you're
[1:02:04] ready for the day
[1:02:06] now tell you when the word cleanses us
[1:02:08] you feel like you're ready to go start
[1:02:10] the right way again
[1:02:15] the word of god will show you how to
[1:02:17] think
[1:02:18] and talk and walk correctly
[1:02:22] psalms 1 19 verses 105 thy word is a
[1:02:26] lamp unto my feet and a light
[1:02:29] unto my pet well i can just figure it
[1:02:31] out myself
[1:02:32] no you can't
[1:02:34] and the devil's standing there to make
[1:02:36] sure you can't
[1:02:38] we need the word of god to tell us when
[1:02:41] we're wrong where we're wrong
[1:02:43] when we get off
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:45] and when the word becomes quickened
[1:02:47] inside of our hearts it will bring such
[1:02:49] a comfort to us such a strength to our
[1:02:52] to our our lives right in the middle of
[1:02:54] the chaos and the problems that we have
[1:02:57] and i i have a feeling that they're not
[1:02:58] going away
[1:03:00] so we're going to need to to get more
[1:03:03] comfort
[1:03:04] strength from god's word but i'll tell
[1:03:06] you what has to happen is the word
[1:03:08] actually has to do something inside of
[1:03:09] us it can't just be a mental
[1:03:11] belief
[1:03:13] a mental conception or a quoting no you
[1:03:16] have to come in contact with the
[1:03:19] the life of the word
[1:03:22] psalms 118 verse 15 this is my comfort
[1:03:26] in my affliction for thy word has
[1:03:28] quickened me
[1:03:31] verse 28 my soul melted for heaviness
[1:03:35] strengthened thou me according to thy
[1:03:38] word the very thing that could help us
[1:03:41] we try to shy away from
[1:03:45] and it's the very thing that we need
[1:03:51] i had a and you've all can relate this
[1:03:53] you've had a toothache at one time or
[1:03:55] another
[1:03:56] you gotta
[1:03:57] go to the dentist and get it taken care
[1:04:00] of
[1:04:01] but i don't like the dentist
[1:04:03] i don't want to sit there i don't want
[1:04:05] to hear
[1:04:11] but you need it
[1:04:14] because it will bring comfort
[1:04:16] it will eventually help you
[1:04:18] in your situation
[1:04:21] the word will give us understanding
[1:04:22] psalms 119 169 says let
[1:04:26] my cry
[1:04:28] come near before thee oh lord give me
[1:04:30] understanding according to thy word
[1:04:33] give me understanding
[1:04:35] according to thy word i don't want
[1:04:38] understanding according to the newspaper
[1:04:40] according to the news
[1:04:43] according to the radio
[1:04:45] according to even what my neighbors
[1:04:46] think
[1:04:48] i want the word to give me understanding
[1:04:49] amen
[1:04:51] god will deliver us according to his
[1:04:53] word verse 170 let my supplication come
[1:04:56] before thee deliver me according to thy
[1:04:59] word
[1:05:01] verse 160 that word is true from the
[1:05:03] beginning every
[1:05:04] one of thy righteous judgments endure
[1:05:07] forever verse 89 forever o lord thy word
[1:05:10] is settled in heaven amen
[1:05:13] you know all of us at one time or
[1:05:15] another has watched tv shows
[1:05:20] and sometimes tv shows become mundane
[1:05:25] and you're looking for another plot you
[1:05:27] wonder what the next season's going to
[1:05:29] bring and you hope they change as you
[1:05:31] hope sometimes you hope they keep this
[1:05:34] you don't like it when they kill off a
[1:05:35] bad guy
[1:05:37] are you with me but when we get to
[1:05:38] heaven there's not going to be a new
[1:05:40] word
[1:05:42] it's not going to be new ideas
[1:05:47] this is it
[1:05:49] what a privilege we have today to know
[1:05:51] that god is in his word amen
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:55] we need to stand up for jesus don't be
[1:05:57] ashamed to share jesus
[1:06:00] sharing with more people
[1:06:02] than you are presently sharing them
[1:06:05] sharing more often with your family
[1:06:08] your co-workers and neighbors
[1:06:10] even strangers or people that you don't
[1:06:12] know
[1:06:15] share jesus as often as you can
[1:06:18] thank you i'll tell you the more amens
[1:06:20] we could get the further we get this
[1:06:21] train down the track this morning
[1:06:25] don't be ashamed to share jesus
[1:06:28] give him more of your time amen it is
[1:06:30] the most precious currency
[1:06:35] give him more of your money
[1:06:38] it is the least
[1:06:39] precious currency
[1:06:43] the love of that currency is the root of
[1:06:46] all evil
[1:06:49] so use it for the lord
[1:06:53] give him more of your life
[1:06:55] it's all you have
[1:06:57] it's all i have
[1:06:59] don't be ashamed to stand more for the
[1:07:02] word of god i'm not taking away your
[1:07:04] stand for the lord at all wherever we're
[1:07:07] at praise god
[1:07:09] we're here to talk about standing more
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:12] where else can i stand more for the lord
[1:07:15] each one of us need to look at the areas
[1:07:18] in our lives to see where we can stand
[1:07:20] more for jesus
[1:07:22] i'm sure there's areas that we're just
[1:07:24] sitting down
[1:07:25] too much
[1:07:27] we need to get up
[1:07:28] take our position for jesus
[1:07:30] sometimes standing up for jesus means
[1:07:33] taking a backseat
[1:07:36] [Laughter]
[1:07:39] by letting your reputation go just like
[1:07:41] saul did
[1:07:43] sometimes we're so proud of ourselves
[1:07:45] we want to preserve our reputation
[1:07:49] too proud to humble ourselves to a lower
[1:07:51] degree of labor
[1:07:53] you want me to do that
[1:07:56] i'm too important to do that
[1:08:00] too ashamed to look to be looked at as
[1:08:03] not a very important person maybe not
[1:08:06] very profitable
[1:08:09] jesus said in luke 17 10 so likewise
[1:08:12] when you have done all those things
[1:08:13] richard commanded you say in other words
[1:08:16] have this attitude in your heart
[1:08:18] we are unprofitable servants
[1:08:21] we have done that
[1:08:22] which that which was our duty to do
[1:08:26] after you do everything that god has
[1:08:28] asked you to do still
[1:08:31] view yourself as unprofitable in other
[1:08:33] words if it wasn't for the grace of god
[1:08:35] we would know to do what he asked us to
[1:08:38] do
[1:08:39] taking a stand for jesus means
[1:08:41] eliminating your murmuring and you're
[1:08:44] complaining in your life
[1:08:46] don't be ashamed
[1:08:48] to be more content
[1:08:50] in your life
[1:08:51] it's an honor the word tells us in
[1:08:53] philippians 2 verse 14 do all things
[1:08:55] without murmuring and complaining that
[1:08:57] you may be blameless harmless the sons
[1:09:00] of god without rebuke in the midst of a
[1:09:02] crooked and perverse nation among whom
[1:09:05] ye shine his lights in the world
[1:09:08] what an honor when everybody's murmuring
[1:09:10] and complaining
[1:09:13] you're expressing how content you are
[1:09:18] you're expressing the joy
[1:09:21] of just
[1:09:23] being able to serve
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:27] don't be ashamed take a stand for being
[1:09:29] harmless
[1:09:32] be content the lord is my shepherd i
[1:09:35] shall not walk want you know when you
[1:09:37] you you actually quote that
[1:09:41] you know that'll get rid of the devil
[1:09:44] amen you know sometimes we're struggling
[1:09:46] in our flash it's jus there's that war
[1:09:48] going on and you want to do your own
[1:09:50] thing you want to prove your point you
[1:09:51] gotta you know what
[1:09:53] got to remind the devil who your
[1:09:55] shepherd is
[1:09:58] he'll flee
[1:09:59] have we been too ashamed to forgive
[1:10:01] somebody lately
[1:10:06] say i'm sorry
[1:10:09] when the word says if we don't forgive
[1:10:11] he won't forgive us
[1:10:14] have we been too ashamed to lower
[1:10:16] ourselves to wash somebody's feet
[1:10:18] they're too dirty when his word commands
[1:10:21] us to wash one another's feet regardless
[1:10:25] of how dirty they are
[1:10:28] have we been too ashamed to lower
[1:10:29] ourselves to love a certain person
[1:10:32] otherwise we can we love but there's
[1:10:34] certain people that we want
[1:10:36] when his word declares that
[1:10:38] that there is no other identification of
[1:10:40] a real christian
[1:10:42] than to bow to love
[1:10:46] brother branham says but how can a man
[1:10:48] who is filled with the holy ghost how
[1:10:50] could a man full of the power of god and
[1:10:53] the love of god in his heart
[1:10:55] talk to a man a few minutes and not
[1:10:58] mention something
[1:11:00] about the love that's in his heart amen
[1:11:02] that's right
[1:11:04] something
[1:11:05] happens
[1:11:08] you can't do it
[1:11:10] you just have to express what's going on
[1:11:12] inside of you amen
[1:11:16] he said this is must be
[1:11:19] that evil day that jesus was speaking of
[1:11:22] where people are ashamed of the word and
[1:11:25] the spirit of god that acts within them
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:31] have we been too ashamed really
[1:11:35] to reach out lay down our lives for
[1:11:37] somebody
[1:11:38] for a certain person
[1:11:40] his word mandates us
[1:11:43] to lay down our lives for one another
[1:11:47] have we been too ashamed to stop doing
[1:11:48] something
[1:11:51] that we know we should
[1:11:54] when the word prohibits us from doing it
[1:11:57] amen
[1:11:58] we have a duty and a responsibility to
[1:12:00] stand up for the whole word of god amen
[1:12:03] it needs to become as important to us as
[1:12:06] anything that you think is important
[1:12:09] from genesis to revelation brother
[1:12:11] branham says we've got to accept our
[1:12:13] responsibility
[1:12:16] don't be ashamed
[1:12:18] to take a stand for jesus
[1:12:20] did you know moses actually took a stand
[1:12:22] for jesus back in his day
[1:12:26] he wasn't ashamed to stand for jesus
[1:12:28] hebrews chapter 11 verse 24 says by
[1:12:30] faith when he was come to years refused
[1:12:33] to be called the son of pharaoh's
[1:12:36] daughter
[1:12:37] choosing rather to suffer the
[1:12:38] afflictions with the people of god
[1:12:41] than to enjoy the pleasure
[1:12:44] of sin
[1:12:46] for a season
[1:12:48] esteeming the reproach
[1:12:50] of christ in other words esteeming the
[1:12:53] humility and insults for being a
[1:12:55] christian
[1:12:58] or the the humiliating treatment of the
[1:13:02] words that are spoken or the actions
[1:13:05] that that came towards him
[1:13:07] he esteemed that reproach of christ
[1:13:11] greater riches
[1:13:13] than the treasures in egypt amen
[1:13:16] for he had respect
[1:13:18] unto the compensation
[1:13:21] of the reward
[1:13:23] i'll tell you we have a great reward
[1:13:25] when you take a stand for jesus
[1:13:29] you may not be getting it from the
[1:13:30] person you're taking a stand for because
[1:13:32] they may be talking behind your back
[1:13:34] right don't expect to get your reward
[1:13:36] from them
[1:13:38] but god's got one for you amen
[1:13:40] peter and the rest of the apostles were
[1:13:42] beaten for taking a stand for jesus they
[1:13:46] were commanded that they should not
[1:13:47] speak in the name of jesus anymore and
[1:13:50] he they let him go and in acts chapter 5
[1:13:53] verse 41 and they departed from the
[1:13:55] presence of the council rejoicing that
[1:13:57] they were counted worthy to suffer shame
[1:14:02] first name
[1:14:04] to suffer shame
[1:14:07] you know two people
[1:14:08] too many people
[1:14:10] are too proud
[1:14:12] to be ashamed
[1:14:17] that's right
[1:14:20] too proud to just to be
[1:14:22] ashamed of anything
[1:14:25] come on
[1:14:27] there's got to be a humility in a
[1:14:29] christian amen that could just be honest
[1:14:38] and daily in the temple now notice they
[1:14:41] were kind of worthy to suffer shame for
[1:14:43] his name and daily in the temple and in
[1:14:46] every house they ceased not to teach and
[1:14:50] to preach jesus christ
[1:14:52] well brother john you're talking out of
[1:14:54] a book that happened 2 000 years ago i
[1:14:57] want some current news
[1:15:02] the current news is the people that are
[1:15:04] living today we're not living 2 000
[1:15:06] years ago and we ought to be doing the
[1:15:08] same thing today
[1:15:12] that's what the current news is
[1:15:16] are you ready to stand for jesus
[1:15:20] are you ready to share his words with
[1:15:22] somebody
[1:15:24] we stand by standing for his word paul
[1:15:27] was so indebted to jesus that he was
[1:15:29] willing to suffer the loss of everything
[1:15:32] and help save souls
[1:15:34] in romans chapter 1 verse 14 paul said i
[1:15:37] am a i am deader
[1:15:41] this is a good way to be humble if you
[1:15:44] really
[1:15:45] feel in debt amen i'm a debtor both to
[1:15:48] the greeks to the barbarians
[1:15:50] to the wise and to the unwise
[1:15:54] pretty much he was a debtor to everybody
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:57] even if he didn't know them
[1:16:00] so as much as is in me is
[1:16:03] i am ready to preach the gospel
[1:16:06] to you that are in rome also amen
[1:16:09] for i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:16:11] christ
[1:16:13] for it is the power of god unto
[1:16:15] salvation everyone that believeth to the
[1:16:17] jew first they rejected him and also to
[1:16:21] the greek amen for therein is the
[1:16:23] righteousness of god revealed from faith
[1:16:25] to faith as is written the just shall
[1:16:28] live by faith not feelings not emotions
[1:16:32] not understanding not knowledge not your
[1:16:34] own interpretation but by the word of
[1:16:36] god
[1:16:41] we should never be shy
[1:16:44] right hesitant or uncommitted
[1:16:46] to make a complete stand for jesus
[1:16:50] timothy
[1:16:52] struggled in his early christian walk
[1:16:56] and paul encouraged him in second
[1:16:59] timothy chapter 1 verse 7 to take a
[1:17:01] complete stand for the lord
[1:17:03] he says for god has not given us the
[1:17:05] spirit of fear but a power and of love
[1:17:08] and of a sound mind
[1:17:10] be not therefore ashamed of the
[1:17:12] testimony of our lord
[1:17:14] nor of me who am i i'm in prison
[1:17:19] but being thou partaker of the same
[1:17:22] afflictions of the gospel according to
[1:17:25] the power of god amen
[1:17:27] sometimes we're just too ashamed
[1:17:30] too ashamed to lower ourselves and be
[1:17:33] part of something that
[1:17:35] you know we think we're much higher than
[1:17:37] that
[1:17:39] god
[1:17:40] wasn't ashamed to call us brethren amen
[1:17:43] we should not be ashamed of him amen
[1:17:47] first john chapter 2 verse 20 and i know
[1:17:49] there's a lot of scriptures today just
[1:17:50] bear with me try to enter into every one
[1:17:54] and now little children abide in him
[1:17:56] that when he shall appear
[1:17:58] we may have confidence and not be
[1:18:01] ashamed
[1:18:02] before him that is coming
[1:18:06] take a stand
[1:18:07] for god in this last age
[1:18:10] there have been millions who have gone
[1:18:12] on before us that have taken a stand and
[1:18:14] in hebrews chapter 12 verse 1
[1:18:17] the writer says we're foreseen we are
[1:18:19] also compassed about what's so great a
[1:18:21] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:18:23] every weight how many's got any weights
[1:18:26] i mean these are good instructions right
[1:18:28] here just lay it aside
[1:18:31] don't act like you don't just lay it
[1:18:32] aside and
[1:18:34] the sin and the unbelief which does so
[1:18:37] easily beset us and let us run
[1:18:40] with patience the race that is set
[1:18:42] before us
[1:18:45] the writer's encouraging us that there's
[1:18:48] been a whole bunch of people before them
[1:18:51] hebrews chapter 11 shares a good portion
[1:18:53] of them amen
[1:18:56] that they ran their race
[1:18:59] they kept the faith
[1:19:01] they weren't ashamed
[1:19:03] to take a stand some of them were
[1:19:04] beheaded
[1:19:06] some of them were burned some were fed
[1:19:08] the lions
[1:19:09] but they took a stand for jesus christ
[1:19:13] now today this is in our hour
[1:19:16] we may not be facing those types of
[1:19:18] things
[1:19:20] but every time sin
[1:19:22] stops right there at the door and
[1:19:24] invites us to take an easier path maybe
[1:19:28] not to go to church
[1:19:32] maybe not to love somebody
[1:19:35] maybe not to lay down your life or
[1:19:37] somebody
[1:19:38] i'll tell you you have a chance to take
[1:19:40] a stand for jesus right there
[1:19:43] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:19:45] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:19:46] that was set before him endured the
[1:19:48] cross despising despising
[1:19:51] the shame
[1:19:53] he didn't even let it bother him
[1:19:56] because it was the joy that was set
[1:19:58] before him he was he was if i could say
[1:20:01] it like this this is what he was born
[1:20:03] for to be a sacrifice that you and i
[1:20:05] could be saved
[1:20:08] let's sit down at the right hand of the
[1:20:10] throne of god
[1:20:12] take a stand in this last hour reach out
[1:20:14] to as many people
[1:20:16] as you can with the gospel amen
[1:20:19] take us a stand and spread
[1:20:22] the only news that there is in the whole
[1:20:25] world right now that can actually save a
[1:20:27] soul
[1:20:29] i mean there's other news out there that
[1:20:30] might not have saved somebody about
[1:20:32] something but there's only one news that
[1:20:33] can save a soul
[1:20:35] amen you sisters with your long hair and
[1:20:37] your dress
[1:20:40] you're going to receive a reward
[1:20:42] standing for jesus
[1:20:46] remember when you're subject to your
[1:20:47] husband you're taking a stand for jesus
[1:20:50] when you're teaching your children to
[1:20:51] love jesus you're taking a stand for
[1:20:53] jesus
[1:20:55] there's so many ways that we can take a
[1:20:57] stand for the lord amen brothers when
[1:21:00] you're subject to your employer you're
[1:21:02] taking a stand for jesus
[1:21:04] when you walk away from a compromiser
[1:21:08] you're standing for jesus
[1:21:11] paul told any believer
[1:21:14] if any believer had a form of godliness
[1:21:17] but he denied the power thereof from
[1:21:19] such turn away you're taking a stand for
[1:21:22] jesus
[1:21:23] come on i'm just preaching the word i
[1:21:25] know it may not be something that we
[1:21:27] think about but that's why we're
[1:21:28] preaching it amen
[1:21:31] when you husbands are taking care of
[1:21:32] your wives you're taking a stand for
[1:21:35] jesus
[1:21:36] when you're helping them
[1:21:38] with a need
[1:21:40] you're taking a stand for jesus
[1:21:42] it isn't just saying
[1:21:46] i believe in jesus he's my savior
[1:21:49] it's every single word of god
[1:21:53] amen
[1:21:54] stand for the word think about the word
[1:21:57] read the word meditate upon the word
[1:21:59] talk about the word listen to it amen
[1:22:02] let it become such a part of you that
[1:22:04] you take a stand all day long for
[1:22:08] jesus when hatred and backbiting is
[1:22:11] circling all around you
[1:22:13] when people just want to use you for
[1:22:15] their gain
[1:22:18] remember when you love them sincerely
[1:22:20] from your heart you're taking a stand
[1:22:23] for jesus
[1:22:25] that's what he said be perfect
[1:22:29] amen
[1:22:30] be just like my father
[1:22:32] when you do this you're taking a stand
[1:22:34] see so many people think
[1:22:36] they're taking the stand for jesus and
[1:22:38] they ignore what the word says
[1:22:40] but they're so religious
[1:22:43] they'll tell you right to their face how
[1:22:45] much
[1:22:46] they're taking a stand for jesus hey
[1:22:48] more wars have been fought over religion
[1:22:50] than anything else
[1:22:53] so physically people can really
[1:22:56] push
[1:22:57] themselves
[1:22:59] but they have the hardest time laying
[1:23:00] down their life
[1:23:03] because it's too humbling they're too
[1:23:05] proud
[1:23:12] in the message the church and its
[1:23:14] condition brother branham says oh when
[1:23:15] the world sees the display of the love
[1:23:17] of god that gallant
[1:23:19] in the human heart
[1:23:22] what a difference it'll be
[1:23:24] when when we let the dove of god come in
[1:23:27] our heart and gentle us
[1:23:30] and make us meek
[1:23:32] there is nothing else
[1:23:34] that's going to
[1:23:35] melt our heart like the love of god
[1:23:39] and friends we need to display it more
[1:23:43] which means i have to get hot water to
[1:23:45] display it
[1:23:47] i have to be in a trial to display it
[1:23:50] it's not just from the pulpit right
[1:23:53] it's just not telling somebody on the
[1:23:55] phone
[1:23:56] it needs to i need to get in such hot
[1:23:58] water
[1:24:01] that people are expecting everything but
[1:24:03] the love of god
[1:24:05] and when the love of god is manifested
[1:24:08] by this you know what all
[1:24:10] men
[1:24:11] will know
[1:24:13] that you are my disciples
[1:24:16] learn to love more
[1:24:19] the people that you're talking to
[1:24:21] amen display an agape love
[1:24:25] no matter how much it hurts you your
[1:24:27] pride love them unconditionally
[1:24:30] paul told timothy if we suffer we shall
[1:24:33] also reign with him but if we deny him
[1:24:35] he also will deny us
[1:24:38] now i think when we deny
[1:24:40] loving the way he's told us to love
[1:24:42] we're actually denying him we're ashamed
[1:24:43] of them
[1:24:45] brother and says don't be ashamed of him
[1:24:48] in this generation
[1:24:49] sinful perplexed
[1:24:51] the last generation that
[1:24:54] that ever that will ever be on the earth
[1:24:57] is sinful adulterous and full of
[1:25:01] putrified sores
[1:25:03] all
[1:25:04] everything that's been decent
[1:25:07] has become indecent
[1:25:09] national politics filthy the nations are
[1:25:12] broken up
[1:25:14] but yet the message is don't be ashamed
[1:25:17] of jesus christ
[1:25:19] keep him first
[1:25:21] who cares who wins
[1:25:23] the argument over politics
[1:25:26] over what's right or wrong about
[1:25:28] anything that's happening in the world
[1:25:31] when that becomes a more of a priority
[1:25:33] we lose our focus
[1:25:36] on what our party should be
[1:25:39] what an honor it is for you and i to
[1:25:41] represent jesus in this sinful age
[1:25:45] and there are many ways that we can
[1:25:46] stand up more for jesus and he's looking
[1:25:48] for frontliners
[1:25:51] he's looking for someone who
[1:25:54] automatically wants to sit in the front
[1:25:56] row
[1:25:58] to stand in the front row
[1:26:00] and say lord use me
[1:26:04] use me lord
[1:26:07] now when he uses you it ain't going to
[1:26:09] be easy
[1:26:12] he
[1:26:13] i don't think when brother mark goes
[1:26:15] home
[1:26:16] he's got 50 people standing in front of
[1:26:18] his lawn saying would you please tell me
[1:26:20] about jesus
[1:26:23] no
[1:26:24] but the 25 people that he sees at work
[1:26:27] he has an opportunity to stand firm for
[1:26:31] jesus
[1:26:33] we all do
[1:26:35] brother branham
[1:26:39] told a little story many times
[1:26:41] he used different names in it
[1:26:45] but he talked he told a story about
[1:26:47] danny danny curry
[1:26:49] he was an evangelist
[1:26:52] about a hundred years ago or more maybe
[1:26:54] 150 named a couple different
[1:26:57] times but
[1:26:58] he had a dream one night and he he died
[1:27:01] he went to heaven and and he wrote
[1:27:04] a book
[1:27:05] about this experience he wrote in his
[1:27:07] book this experience
[1:27:10] and so as he
[1:27:11] enters up to the gate
[1:27:14] and
[1:27:15] a voice spoke to him the gatekeeper and
[1:27:17] said who is this that is
[1:27:19] approaching
[1:27:20] this
[1:27:22] uh holy place
[1:27:25] and he said well my my name is danny
[1:27:27] curry i'm an evangelist and i i i've
[1:27:30] left my earthly home and i've come here
[1:27:32] to take my my position
[1:27:35] here
[1:27:36] uh in in heaven
[1:27:38] and the gatekeeper went and looked in
[1:27:41] the book he looked all through the book
[1:27:43] and he couldn't find the name danny
[1:27:45] curry
[1:27:48] so he comes back and he tells him i'm
[1:27:50] sorry
[1:27:51] but your name isn't in this book
[1:27:55] and i can't let you in
[1:27:56] he says well there must be some mistake
[1:27:59] i was an evangelist in america and i won
[1:28:02] many souls to jesus
[1:28:05] he says i'm sorry sir i've searched and
[1:28:07] it's not there
[1:28:09] he says oh and distraught what could he
[1:28:11] do
[1:28:12] because there was nothing
[1:28:14] left for him to do
[1:28:16] just a wanderer
[1:28:19] and the the angel the
[1:28:21] the the gatekeeper said well you can
[1:28:23] appeal before
[1:28:26] the white throne judgment
[1:28:29] he said well if that's my only hope if
[1:28:31] that's my only chance there's nothing
[1:28:32] else i could do
[1:28:34] and at that time it seemed like he just
[1:28:37] was
[1:28:38] going through time and and and space and
[1:28:42] and there was a light that became
[1:28:44] brighter and brighter and before you
[1:28:46] know it that light was all wrong he
[1:28:47] couldn't tell where it was coming from
[1:28:49] and he came right to the center of this
[1:28:51] light and a voice spoke out to him and
[1:28:53] said
[1:28:55] who are thou that has come
[1:28:57] into the the presence of my justice
[1:29:03] and he said my name is daniel curry and
[1:29:05] i
[1:29:06] i got rejected and condemned at the gate
[1:29:09] said my name wasn't written in the book
[1:29:11] and said the only way that i have a
[1:29:13] chance is to appeal
[1:29:15] before the white throne judgment
[1:29:17] he says you want to
[1:29:19] you want to be judged
[1:29:21] at my
[1:29:23] seat of
[1:29:24] justice and holiness
[1:29:26] and daniel curry said yes i do
[1:29:30] he says well
[1:29:32] were you
[1:29:33] daniel curry were you
[1:29:35] did you ever tell a lie
[1:29:39] and he thought well this is easy i would
[1:29:41] live for the lord i never never 20 lies
[1:29:43] and
[1:29:44] and about the time that he was so sure
[1:29:47] of the situation that light
[1:29:50] began to expose his past
[1:29:54] and he remembered the things
[1:29:57] that he said that wasn't completely true
[1:30:03] and he
[1:30:04] bowed his head and he just said
[1:30:08] lord i i have lied
[1:30:13] and the voice spoke out of the light and
[1:30:15] said
[1:30:16] daniel curry were you were you always
[1:30:18] honest
[1:30:21] with your dealings
[1:30:23] he thought well surely he was an honest
[1:30:25] man he
[1:30:26] lived that life and and and being a
[1:30:29] christian and everything and to be that
[1:30:30] example
[1:30:33] and when he's about ready to say
[1:30:35] i was an honest man
[1:30:38] in the presence of god
[1:30:41] his memory began to flash back all the
[1:30:44] times he did those shady deals
[1:30:49] all the times that he wasn't just
[1:30:50] completely on board
[1:30:54] and he had to say
[1:30:56] no
[1:30:57] i wasn't always honest
[1:31:00] and he went through the
[1:31:01] the commandments and i'll tell you we
[1:31:04] may be sitting here thinking that we're
[1:31:06] okay but when we get in the presence of
[1:31:09] god it'll show things that we're not
[1:31:11] thinking about today
[1:31:17] and after he went through those
[1:31:18] commandments
[1:31:21] he finally asked him at the end
[1:31:24] he said
[1:31:25] were you perfect
[1:31:27] were you perfect on earth
[1:31:29] because my word says
[1:31:31] that you must be perfect
[1:31:34] be
[1:31:35] perfect even as my father in heaven is
[1:31:37] perfect
[1:31:40] about a love
[1:31:43] unconditionally everybody
[1:31:46] about that time the power and the
[1:31:48] presence of god was so strong
[1:31:51] all he could see
[1:31:53] was the mistakes
[1:31:54] that he made the times that he failed
[1:31:57] to really be perfect and to love
[1:31:59] everybody
[1:32:02] and about that time
[1:32:06] the the thunders began to roar and a
[1:32:08] blast came and he was getting ready to
[1:32:10] hear those words depart from me
[1:32:13] get out of my presence you're not worthy
[1:32:17] and about that time as he was listening
[1:32:20] he heard the sweetest voice he ever
[1:32:22] heard
[1:32:24] and he turned around
[1:32:26] to look
[1:32:27] and he saw the sweetest face that he
[1:32:30] ever seen
[1:32:32] he said there he said in his book that
[1:32:34] there was no mother's voice
[1:32:37] that could have been
[1:32:39] as sweet
[1:32:40] as his voice that he heard
[1:32:42] and looked
[1:32:43] so comforting
[1:32:45] and so beautiful
[1:32:47] as his face
[1:32:50] and he came up close to daniel cure and
[1:32:52] he put his arm around him he drew him
[1:32:54] close
[1:32:55] and he said father
[1:32:57] it's true
[1:32:59] daniel wasn't perfect
[1:33:01] but one thing he did do when he was on
[1:33:04] earth he stood for me
[1:33:06] today i'm going to stand for you amen
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:10] i'll tell you that's what matters
[1:33:13] is if you're trying to stand for jesus
[1:33:15] with all your heart it's not about
[1:33:17] trying to to be the most perfect person
[1:33:19] you can be
[1:33:20] it's about when you hear god speak to
[1:33:22] you something inside of you says it
[1:33:24] means a lot to me god i really want to
[1:33:26] please you because it doesn't matter
[1:33:28] what people think of you
[1:33:31] come on beware when all men speak good
[1:33:33] of you
[1:33:36] they call jesus beelzebub what are they
[1:33:38] going to call you some good cookie
[1:33:43] god just wants us to stand from to take
[1:33:45] a stand from in our personal lives
[1:33:48] whatever god speaks to your heart
[1:33:51] that's where he wants you to stand
[1:33:54] and eventually the more you stand the
[1:33:56] closer you get to his image
[1:33:58] the more you can be used of them in this
[1:34:00] age
[1:34:02] don't be ashamed of what the bible says
[1:34:05] amen don't be ashamed of getting on your
[1:34:07] knees and helping somebody amen pray for
[1:34:09] them pray for the love of god in your
[1:34:11] heart get to a place where you can just
