[25:57] brother Johnson said he had a little
[25:59] testimony wanted to
[26:06] give I first want to thank all of you
[26:10] for praying for me when I was in the
[26:15] hospital and uh
[26:18] recupera and and I I I thought uh I
[26:26] really appreciate the young people that
[26:29] are going up to pray at the altar and I
[26:34] thought that I would give this testimony
[26:37] to you
[26:40] because I went to The Altar for seven
[26:45] years and the
[26:47] reason he could not uh feel me with the
[26:52] Holy Spirit I tell the Lord I'll do
[26:56] anything
[26:58] but
[27:00] preach and it the Holy Spirit wouldn't
[27:05] come so there was a a minister that was
[27:10] a good friend of myself and my
[27:14] father he invited me to go to his
[27:19] church and it was a church that my dad
[27:23] had had had started with a with the
[27:27] brush aror anybody know what a brush
[27:30] aror
[27:32] is H well anyway it's it's it don't keep
[27:38] the rain from coming through
[27:41] but but uh uh
[27:46] anyway uh I went to his
[27:48] church and I'm sure that he and his wife
[27:53] had been praying for me to receive the
[27:57] Hool Holy
[27:58] Ghost and so during this during the song
[28:03] service he he he was waiting for the
[28:08] Saints to choose another song and he
[28:12] just stepped out to the pool
[28:16] pit and he
[28:19] said he said without the baptism of the
[28:24] Holy Ghost you're not going to be ready
[28:29] for the
[28:32] Rapture well I believe I believe that
[28:37] that was the truth you know so in my
[28:42] spirit I just said I'm getting it
[28:46] tonight and there was some Spirit not
[28:50] too far from
[28:53] me and I know it was the devil but he
[28:57] said you're not going to get it I'm
[29:00] getting it
[29:02] tonight he said even if you stay till
[29:07] the sun comes up in the morning you're
[29:10] not going to get it and that made me mad
[29:13] at the Devil and I want to say to you
[29:17] it's good to be mad at the Devil amen
[29:21] amen so so that
[29:26] night he his presence came down upon
[29:30] me
[29:32] and I had I had always told God I'll do
[29:38] anything but preach I didn't want to
[29:43] preach
[29:45] but that night when I felt his presence
[29:49] real
[29:51] strong and then he showed me a
[29:56] light that went through the ceiling
[29:59] through the
[30:00] roof I saw there was a big oak tree at
[30:05] this little country church and I could
[30:10] see the limbs of that oak tree I
[30:14] followed that light till it P the
[30:18] moon and then I I said that's
[30:23] him I said Lord I'll do anything
[30:28] even
[30:30] preach and
[30:32] immediately they're Shine the bright I
[30:34] believe it was the pillow of
[30:37] fire
[30:39] because I
[30:40] couldn't I couldn't find the end of it
[30:44] but I knew it when it passed the moon uh
[30:50] it it had to be close to where the
[30:53] Lord and so and so when I said that this
[30:59] light shined upon me so I want to say to
[31:03] you that are seeking the Holy
[31:07] Spirit don't hold nothing back am be
[31:13] willing to do anything he calls you to
[31:18] do and he'll he will give it to you and

[35:40] you move to look for a church um because
[35:43] there's so many people that are just
[35:45] moving and and staying out of church and
[35:48] maybe some get online but to be a part
[35:50] of a local body and they're searching so
[35:53] let's I believe they would appreciate
[35:55] our prayers if we would pray for them
[35:57] that God would lead him to the place
[35:59] it'd have have them to be of course we
[36:02] we believe it would be here but we want
[36:04] God to show them
[36:06] that amen amen Psalms

[36:47] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[36:51] were written which in continuance were
[36:55] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[36:59] them how precious also are thy thoughts
[37:03] unto me oh God how great is the sum of
[37:08] them if I should count them they are

[37:57] scriptures here this morning for your
[37:59] entire
[38:01] word and to know that your thoughts are
[38:04] precious towards
[38:06] us Lord we're imperfect we've come short
[38:10] of your glory yet your thoughts are
[38:12] precious towards
[38:15] us the some of
[38:19] them are just
[38:21] amazing and Lord we pray that you would
[38:24] break this bread of life to us this
[38:27] morning as we look into the scriptures
[38:31] and just take a journey to the thoughts
[38:34] that you would have and that you have
[38:36] had and that you uh you continue to have
[38:41] towards us your children God we'll be
[38:44] careful to thank you and to praise you
[38:46] this morning may you encourage us
[38:49] strengthen us guide
[38:51] us Lord direct our path correct us where
[38:55] we need correction
[38:57] father we just desire you to be
[39:00] preeminent amongst us bless your people
[39:03] with a greater revelation of who they
[39:06] are
[39:07] today we ask it all in Jesus Christ's
[39:10] name amen amen God bless you may be
[39:15] seated we want to entitle this journey
[39:18] into God's thoughts and just take a look
[39:22] a little bit at at God's thoughts at
[39:25] us
[39:27] that word
[39:28] sum says how great is the sum of
[39:32] them how great is the sum of God's
[39:35] precious thoughts towards us that word
[39:38] sum it's a total amount everybody knows
[39:41] what the word sum is we probably learned
[39:43] that in in math class it's you put a
[39:46] bunch of numbers together whether you're
[39:47] add them subtract them and and the sum
[39:50] is is at the
[39:51] end and it's uh and God has a some
[39:57] thought for all of us today it can be
[40:00] very difficult to know the thoughts of
[40:02] God the Bible says for my thoughts are
[40:05] not your thoughts neither are your ways
[40:07] my ways sayeth the Lord for as the
[40:10] heaven is higher than the earth so are
[40:11] my ways higher than your ways and my
[40:13] thoughts than your
[40:16] thoughts Micah 46 says that they know
[40:21] not the thoughts of God Amen Psalms 92:5
[40:25] says and thy thoughts are very deep we
[40:28] could say that God is a deep
[40:31] thinker God's thoughts are often quite
[40:34] different than our thoughts often we
[40:38] think we might know what God's thoughts
[40:41] are but we come to find out so many
[40:43] times that that really wasn't God that
[40:45] we were
[40:46] thinking and that's why we've been
[40:48] taught in the Bible to say and to think
[40:51] if it would be the will of the
[40:53] Lord the Lord willing because we just
[40:57] don't always know the thoughts of God
[41:01] Jesus thanked the father one time he
[41:04] said I thank thee father because thou
[41:06] has has hid these
[41:08] things certain thoughts certain things
[41:11] from the wise and The
[41:14] Prudent and yet those same thoughts were
[41:17] revealed to babes Amen to babe so God's
[41:23] got the ability to to keep his thought
[41:25] from someone one who's very very very
[41:28] smart in the
[41:31] Bible and he's also uh capable of of
[41:35] showing a child that same thought that
[41:40] he's hiding from somebody else amen and
[41:43] and you know it takes a lot those of us
[41:45] that have children have talked to
[41:47] Children it can it actually takes a lot
[41:49] to break something down to their level
[41:53] that same thought hid from the wise
[41:55] broke down
[41:57] to where we can understand it and it all
[42:00] has to do with a relationship amen
[42:03] because God sees the heart amen thank
[42:06] God that he sees our hearts
[42:08] today have you ever noticed when God
[42:12] reveal something to
[42:14] you you you and you you you conclude how
[42:18] simple it really was right that you
[42:21] never think well this is really complex
[42:23] it was boy it was that simple I didn't
[42:25] realize how simple it was I believe that
[42:29] God is here this morning and I believe
[42:32] that he's hid in
[42:33] Simplicity but he also wants to reveal
[42:36] himself in Simplicity not to be looking
[42:39] somewhere but just right here in his
[42:43] word he's looking for those that are
[42:46] hungry and
[42:49] thirsty the sum of God's
[42:52] thoughts can be sometimes frightening
[42:55] amen
[42:56] on the day of judgment we're going to a
[42:59] lot of people are going to hear the sum
[43:00] of God's
[43:02] thoughts Hebrews 10:30 says the Lord
[43:04] shall judge his people it is a fearful
[43:07] thing to fall in the hands of a living
[43:09] God Amen we can see the conclusion of
[43:12] the whole matter to fear God to keep his
[43:14] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[43:16] of man it just kind of sums it up for
[43:19] God shall bring every work into judgment
[43:22] and every secret thing whether it be
[43:23] good or whether it be evil I'll just say
[43:27] if we've ever done any wrong just say
[43:29] God cleanse me and forgive me of that
[43:31] cover me with your blood because we
[43:34] don't want it between us and God
[43:38] Amen God has summed up a lot of things
[43:40] for us and we know that because of his
[43:43] his his word basically this word is
[43:47] God's thoughts that have been expressed
[43:50] amen can you say Amen to that amen God
[43:53] some uh he some the of God's thoughts on
[43:57] iniquity and we know iniquity is simply
[43:59] not doing the right thing that we know
[44:02] to do not going doing bad things amen
[44:05] it's not doing the things that we know
[44:07] that we've been taught to do that we
[44:08] should be doing Jesus said many will
[44:11] come to me in that day and say Lord Lord
[44:14] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[44:16] cast out devils and did many wonderful
[44:18] works then will I profess unto them I
[44:20] never knew you depart from me ye that
[44:23] work iniquity amen so iniquity in our
[44:28] personal
[44:30] life is
[44:32] more
[44:34] important to God that we get rid of it
[44:37] than him using us for his
[44:41] kingdom God would rather have iniquity
[44:44] away from our life than to actually use
[44:47] us for his kingdom and he's making this
[44:49] the statement here so the sum of God's
[44:54] thoughts on iniquity is that we need to
[44:56] separate from iniquity because God
[44:59] is let them that nameth the name of the
[45:01] Lord let him depart from iniquity God is
[45:04] separated from iniquity if we if we hang
[45:06] on to iniquity God will not hear our
[45:08] prayers and and he'll have to separate
[45:10] from us so we see the importance should
[45:13] be on getting rid of just it doesn't
[45:16] matter if I'm not doing what God wants
[45:18] me to do it is important it's very
[45:21] important God's thoughts on uh the
[45:24] Church of leoa
[45:26] the sum of God's thoughts were I counsel
[45:29] thee to buy of me gold amen buy the life
[45:32] of God that that to get your eyes
[45:35] anointed to to repent and open the door
[45:38] and let me come into your heart amen
[45:40] that's the the sum of God's thoughts to
[45:42] the Church of
[45:44] leoda the sum of God's thoughts on
[45:47] unforgiveness Jesus said if if we do not
[45:50] forgive one another of their trespasses
[45:52] then neither God will forgive us of our
[45:54] trespasses the the sum of God's thoughts
[45:57] on being
[45:59] judgmental judge not that you be not
[46:01] judged amen for with what judgment you
[46:04] judge you shall be judged and with what
[46:07] measure ye might it shall be measured to
[46:09] you again so we see here that God has a
[46:14] sum to a sum of his thoughts on certain
[46:18] subjects the some of God's thoughts on
[46:21] loving him and laying down her life the
[46:22] Bible says Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[46:25] God with all all thy heart with all thy
[46:26] soul with all thy might and these words
[46:29] which I command thee this day shall be
[46:31] in thine heart amen keep them there
[46:35] Jesus said if you love me keep my
[46:37] Commandments he said to love one another
[46:40] the very same way that I loved you so
[46:42] however you you feel that God has loved
[46:44] you he's basically loved you
[46:46] unconditionally amen and that's the same
[46:48] way that God wants us to love one
[46:50] another and if we're struggling with
[46:52] that that's because there's another
[46:53] Spirit on you simply because there's a
[46:56] wrong Spirit on you because with God's
[46:58] spirit he doesn't struggle in loving
[47:00] others no matter what they do the fact
[47:02] he could be hanging on the cross he say
[47:04] father forgive them they know not what
[47:06] they're doing and if that same spirit is
[47:08] in you today Jesus Christ is the same
[47:10] yesterday today and forever I believe he
[47:12] can forgive others when they're hurting
[47:14] you believe
[47:16] that Jesus said or the the a first John
[47:20] chap 3:16 said says John said because he
[47:23] laid down his life for us we ought to
[47:26] lay down our livs for the
[47:28] Brethren 1 John Chapter 2 Verse 6 he
[47:32] that saith he abideth in Christ how many
[47:35] is abided in Christ am amen how many
[47:38] don't want to how many don't want to
[47:40] participate in this uh part of
[47:43] the journey he that saith he abideth in
[47:47] Christ ought himself also to walk even
[47:51] as he
[47:53] walked so not just talk the talk but
[47:56] walk the walk amen verse n he that saith
[48:00] he is in the light and hates his
[48:05] brother here's the PM the PM is in dark
[48:09] he's in darkness even until now yes he
[48:15] could say he's a Christian he could say
[48:16] he could go to church but if he's hating
[48:18] his brother the man is in
[48:21] darkness verse 11 he that hateth his
[48:24] brother is in darkness and walketh in
[48:26] darkness and knoweth not whether he's
[48:28] going because that Darkness has blinded
[48:31] his eyes how terrible it is you know you
[48:33] got that hate right about someone it
[48:37] just it's a it's a terrible feeling even
[48:39] if you didn't start it amen see the
[48:42] devil's looking for a door to kind of
[48:44] creep in
[48:45] there but we see here the sum of God's
[48:49] thoughts on hating someone or loving
[48:52] certain individuals less than others
[48:55] right is that hate is just a love
[48:58] less you don't have to look too far to
[49:00] see the sum of God's thoughts on any
[49:03] subject this word is exactly the
[49:06] thoughts of God Amen as a man thinketh
[49:10] so is
[49:12] he often we don't look at the sum of
[49:15] things we only look at part that's why
[49:17] when we see somebody do something we
[49:19] could be quick to judge
[49:21] them but we don't see the sum of their
[49:24] heart we don't see their intent we don't
[49:25] see what's going on only God knows that
[49:29] part that's right and that's why God has
[49:31] just called us to be Christ to them amen
[49:35] not to judge them judgment belongs to
[49:38] God Amen right we obviously have been
[49:41] taught to judge fruits because Jesus
[49:43] taught us that but that doesn't mean we
[49:46] judge them there's a difference if we
[49:49] see the fruit isn't right we pray for
[49:52] them the sum of God's thoughts towards
[49:55] us now I want to get into that this
[49:57] morning how precious also are thy
[50:00] thoughts unto me oh God and how great is
[50:04] the total of all those thoughts amen if
[50:07] I should count them they are more in
[50:10] number than the sand think about all the
[50:14] sand that's that's that's a lot of
[50:16] thoughts that God has and when I awake I
[50:22] am still with
[50:23] thee wow how precious is that what makes
[50:28] those thoughts so precious towards us
[50:31] sometimes it's hard to imagine or to
[50:33] believe
[50:33] that that God could have
[50:37] really any good thoughts let alone Be
[50:40] precious towards us and I say that
[50:42] because God has to deal with a lot of
[50:43] negative things in our
[50:46] life we've come short so often of his
[50:49] glory we've we've Fallen
[50:52] amen but his thoughts are still precious
[50:55] towards us he knows we're imperfect we
[50:58] read it this
[51:00] morning when he wants to correct
[51:05] us his thought in correcting us is
[51:09] precious that thought of correcting
[51:12] us God does not want us to remain in a
[51:15] wrong
[51:17] State the very fact that he would go to
[51:19] correct this is a precious thought he
[51:22] said as many as I love and rebuke many
[51:24] as I love love and rebuke I a chasen
[51:28] right so God God's love is
[51:33] corrective so there's something behind
[51:36] the correction amen it's a love it's
[51:39] it's a it's a precious thought that he
[51:42] has towards us of course if we're in a
[51:44] carnal State you ever been in a carnal
[51:46] State and somebody tries to correct you
[51:48] and you just get all offended bent out
[51:49] of shape like who are you to tell me you
[51:52] got Twice The Faults that I
[51:54] do
[51:55] yeah you know it can become real
[51:59] carnal and so when the word of God is
[52:01] being preached if it seems to be a
[52:03] little cutting you shouldn't be thinking
[52:08] negatively God's word his thoughts
[52:11] towards us are precious am
[52:14] precious I thank God that we have a
[52:16] father that is would he's done
[52:19] everything he
[52:22] could sent back the Holy Ghost to lead
[52:25] and guide us into all
[52:27] truth and that he has a vision he has
[52:31] predestinated us to be conformed in the
[52:33] image of his
[52:34] son and he won't stop amen he won't stop
[52:38] until we're
[52:40] there what makes God's thoughts so
[52:42] precious towards us Deuteronomy 7:6 says
[52:47] for thou art a holy people unto the Lord
[52:49] thy God the Lord thy God have chosen
[52:53] thee to be a special people un to
[52:58] himself and I want you to think about
[53:00] this is you in the scriptures right
[53:02] here the Lord thy God has chosen you to
[53:05] be a special people unto himself
[53:09] am
[53:11] above all the that are upon the face of
[53:16] the
[53:18] earth oh my I cannot comprehend
[53:22] that but if you can put your name in the
[53:25] book if you can see your name in that
[53:28] scripture
[53:30] amen you're special amen very very very
[53:37] special not just because you go to this
[53:39] church not because I'm telling you
[53:42] because God told you it's in God's
[53:46] word the Lord did not set his love upon
[53:49] you nor choose you because you were more
[53:52] in number than any people right that's
[53:55] right for ye were the fewest of all
[53:58] people even Jesus said fear not little
[54:01] flock right it's the father's good
[54:04] pleasure to give you the
[54:06] kingdom but because the Lord loved you
[54:11] and because he would keep his word his
[54:14] oath the Lord set his love upon us
[54:18] because he loves us I mean how are we
[54:21] going to comprehend that I cannot
[54:22] comprehend how much God loves me I can't
[54:25] comprehend why God loves me
[54:28] amen but he loves
[54:31] me for God who is rich in Mercy for his
[54:34] great love wherewith he loved
[54:37] us God did not choose us to lose
[54:41] us now if we had chosen him we just you
[54:45] know what I'm gonna go I think I'm GNA
[54:46] go serve god well if you would have
[54:48] chose God good chance you would have
[54:53] unchosen but because because God chose
[54:56] us he can't lose
[54:58] us he said you have not chosen me but I
[55:02] have chosen you amen he didn't choose us
[55:05] to lose us he chose us for eternity he's
[55:09] committed how precious are his thoughts
[55:12] unto
[55:13] us and how great is the sum of them amen
[55:18] he's not changing his
[55:21] mind he's going to keep his word with us
[55:24] to the very
[55:26] in he said lo I Am With You Always even
[55:30] to the end of the
[55:31] world that's a precious
[55:35] thought for he have said I will never
[55:37] leave thee nor forsake thee that's a
[55:40] precious
[55:42] thought so that we may boldly say the
[55:44] Lord is my helper I will not
[55:49] fear okay so the sum of the thought is
[55:52] I'm not going to have to fear because
[55:55] God is with me he's my helper and he's
[55:57] going to see me through every situation
[55:59] now either we believe that word we stand
[56:01] on that word or we doubt God you can't
[56:04] do
[56:06] both whatever the devil's been telling
[56:09] you you got to say get out Satan like
[56:11] brother Johnson was saying in his
[56:14] testimony he says the devil was there
[56:16] trying to keep me from
[56:22] it we've got to believe that God is with
[56:24] us
[56:26] us and that he's always with
[56:29] us not just based on the fact that you
[56:33] know we're more good than we are
[56:36] bad it's nothing to do with
[56:41] it so sum up God's thoughts about what
[56:45] we're going through he's committed to
[56:46] see us through amen now that's a
[56:49] precious thought to
[56:50] me he's committed to see us
[56:53] through so how great is the sum of God's
[56:58] thoughts towards us many thoughts he has
[57:01] towards us sure he wants us to walk in
[57:04] the light sure he wants us to grow but
[57:08] those are not like bad thoughts they
[57:11] just feel kind of like not good thoughts
[57:13] for our
[57:15] flesh but to our soul to our soul to the
[57:19] hungry so every bitter thing
[57:23] sweet so no matter what the situation is
[57:26] or or what we're feeling like he's going
[57:28] to see us
[57:29] through the Bible says we have a high
[57:33] priest which is touched with the
[57:35] feelings of our
[57:37] infirmities you may think you're going
[57:39] through a situation that nobody
[57:44] understands and it's okay if nobody
[57:48] understands but God understands amen and
[57:51] he's the only one that can make a way
[57:54] where there seem seeth to be no
[57:56] way the Bible tells us that God is
[57:58] faithful with every Temptation we face
[58:01] he's right there to make a way of Escape
[58:03] for
[58:05] us have you ever felt like God has let
[58:08] you
[58:11] down come on let's be honest listen I'm
[58:15] G to have you sign a piece of paper when
[58:16] you come in you got to participate in
[58:18] this
[58:20] stuff yeah we've all felt like God has
[58:23] let us down
[58:25] but I'm going to say that those thoughts
[58:27] are from the
[58:28] devil God has never ever ever ever let
[58:32] anybody
[58:34] down God is faithful the Bible says God
[58:37] is
[58:40] faithful we just need to keep our
[58:42] thoughts on the word what the word
[58:45] says God knows better what's what's best
[58:48] for us even when we think this is best
[58:51] for
[58:51] us it's like your child can you imagine
[58:54] your child saying look I want some more
[58:56] double stuff orils I know I've had 10
[58:59] but I want 10
[59:01] more and and that child knows what's
[59:04] best for his
[59:06] desires but he doesn't know what's best
[59:09] for his body am God does a lot of times
[59:12] we want things that is not right in
[59:16] accordance to God's
[59:18] will sometimes we feel like we we let
[59:21] God down too much how many's ever felt
[59:23] that amen all right we got more
[59:25] participation
[59:27] now like we've sinned too much we've
[59:30] Fallen too much we've been away from the
[59:32] Lord too much we haven't been praying
[59:36] enough and we beg to
[59:39] question I wonder what God really thinks
[59:41] of
[59:42] us sometimes we we feel like we let God
[59:46] down too much and we're not quite sure
[59:49] just exactly where God is standing with
[59:52] us so I got a scripture for for you it's
[59:55] Jeremiah
[59:57] 29:1 for I know the thoughts that I
[1:00:00] think towards you sayth the Lord
[1:00:04] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:00:07] give you an expected end so so it does
[1:00:12] not matter how much you fallen
[1:00:15] today or yesterday or last week or last
[1:00:20] month or last
[1:00:23] year
[1:00:25] the thoughts that God has for us today
[1:00:28] is to give us an expected
[1:00:31] end an end that has peace with him amen
[1:00:37] thoughts that there's a a togetherness
[1:00:39] that he and his bride are going to sit
[1:00:42] together on the
[1:00:44] throne that his bride will be raptured
[1:00:47] be out of before tribulation
[1:00:50] hits that's a precious thought amen we
[1:00:53] don't have to go through
[1:00:56] that how precious are his thoughts unto
[1:01:02] us oh God how great is the sum of them
[1:01:06] the sum is to give us an expected
[1:01:09] end between here and there is a lot of
[1:01:12] ups and
[1:01:13] downs a lot of
[1:01:16] turmoil you've been on a plane you ask
[1:01:19] how was the
[1:01:21] flight sometimes they say it was pretty
[1:01:23] good it smooth and then sometimes you
[1:01:25] hear well there was some
[1:01:28] turbulence but it got you to the end am
[1:01:32] amen it can be scary sometimes but it's
[1:01:35] a peace when you land there's peace
[1:01:38] amen God doesn't hold
[1:01:41] grudges he
[1:01:43] doesn't he will gently lead us to where
[1:01:46] we need to be if for out of the will of
[1:01:48] God when the when he the spirit of Truth
[1:01:50] has come he will guide you into all
[1:01:53] truth he's a guide you ever been on a
[1:01:58] trip well some of you been on a trip
[1:02:01] with brother uh Joseph Smith to Israel
[1:02:06] but we've all been on little
[1:02:09] trips and uh whether you're going
[1:02:11] through a tour in a a
[1:02:15] museum and the guide will say something
[1:02:18] like this my name is John Martin and I'm
[1:02:20] going to be your guide
[1:02:22] today and I just got a few ruls before
[1:02:25] we start turn the phones off make sure
[1:02:27] that you stay together as a group and um
[1:02:30] you know watch your children okay so
[1:02:32] then we all go and as we go well there's
[1:02:36] just things
[1:02:39] happen but the guy just doesn't take you
[1:02:42] by the arm and say didn't I tell you get
[1:02:45] back in
[1:02:49] line
[1:02:51] no but he'll find a way to get things
[1:02:55] back in order that's
[1:02:57] right we serve a gentle
[1:03:01] God yes yes I I would never want to go
[1:03:05] into battle with him against
[1:03:10] him because every man will have to give
[1:03:13] an account to that gentle man one
[1:03:16] day but I'll say today the holy don't
[1:03:20] wait for the Holy Spirit to grab your
[1:03:22] arm don't wait for him to blow up your
[1:03:24] home and blow up your car and make
[1:03:26] something bad happen to
[1:03:28] you he's got a still Small Voice and
[1:03:31] he's calling you home amen he's calling
[1:03:35] you to him amen he guides us into all
[1:03:38] Truth by Revelation he reveals to you
[1:03:42] what you need to
[1:03:45] do amen and you shall know the truth
[1:03:49] amen and the truth shall make you
[1:03:51] free the only true freedom is in Christ
[1:03:55] amen now it's vital to every believer to
[1:03:57] know who Christ is and to know the
[1:04:00] thoughts that God thinks towards
[1:04:03] us he said he would build his church
[1:04:05] upon the revelation of who he is amen so
[1:04:09] we can't do
[1:04:11] nothing we cannot do nothing to force
[1:04:14] oursel to be part of God's church
[1:04:16] amen it's all up to God and God
[1:04:19] revealing himself to us amen and that
[1:04:23] becomes his church so the greatest thing
[1:04:26] we could do is humble ourselves before
[1:04:28] the Lord come under subjection to the
[1:04:30] word of God don't try blazing our own
[1:04:32] trails and doing our own thing and and
[1:04:34] saying God's with me stay a million
[1:04:37] miles away from that
[1:04:39] Devil stay with the
[1:04:42] word we are a part of
[1:04:45] Christ it's amazing how blessed we
[1:04:47] really
[1:04:48] areen the Lord chose us to be a special
[1:04:51] people I don't feel special
[1:04:56] I I don't but I know he views me as
[1:05:00] being
[1:05:01] special and that's all the
[1:05:05] difference but it's not just a special
[1:05:08] person in the world a special person
[1:05:11] unto
[1:05:12] himself above all the people that are on
[1:05:15] face of the Earth the Lord set his love
[1:05:18] upon us and chose us because he loved us
[1:05:22] he proved that love at calv
[1:05:26] which at the same time he did that he
[1:05:28] made a way for the entire world to get
[1:05:31] saved if they wanted
[1:05:32] to but he knew we would
[1:05:36] come God's precious thoughts of us go
[1:05:39] way way
[1:05:42] back first Peter tells us that Christ
[1:05:45] was
[1:05:47] crucified before God ever spoke the
[1:05:50] world into
[1:05:52] existence revelation chap 13 and 17
[1:05:56] tells us that our names were put on the
[1:05:57] book of life before the foundation of
[1:05:59] the world that's right you and I were in
[1:06:02] the thoughts of God before the
[1:06:04] foundation of the world think about
[1:06:06] those thoughts back then it
[1:06:10] started
[1:06:12] amen when someone ask you if you're a
[1:06:15] Christian or if you don't if you know
[1:06:16] Christ you can say oh yeah we go way
[1:06:19] back yes sir way back am how precious
[1:06:22] are his thoughts unto us how great is
[1:06:25] the sum of
[1:06:26] them Ephesians 5 verse 25 says Christ
[1:06:31] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:06:34] verse 26 that he might sanctify and
[1:06:37] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[1:06:41] by the word amen you know you got
[1:06:43] churches today they don't want to be
[1:06:45] washed by the
[1:06:47] word they start washing the the the
[1:06:50] congregation with the word they're going
[1:06:51] to lose most of their congregation so
[1:06:53] they bring in entertainment they bring
[1:06:55] in something to make them feel
[1:06:58] comfortable well that's good if all
[1:07:00] you're looking for is a place to have uh
[1:07:04] uh a social fellowship with other human
[1:07:08] beings but if you're looking to get
[1:07:10] closer to God you need to be washed by
[1:07:12] the
[1:07:14] word and verse 27 tells us why he does
[1:07:17] that that he might present it to himself
[1:07:21] a glorious Church not having spot or
[1:07:26] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:07:29] should be holy and without any kind of
[1:07:34] blemish verse 30 for we are members of
[1:07:37] his body of his flesh and his bones we
[1:07:43] are members of Christ
[1:07:48] amen we were in God's thoughts before
[1:07:51] the foundation of the world we are a
[1:07:54] part of Christ's
[1:07:57] thoughts we're not some just little
[1:08:00] thought that goes out there and it
[1:08:02] doesn't mean
[1:08:04] anything God doesn't think
[1:08:07] meanly he has a purpose in his thinking
[1:08:10] he had a desire to have a church that
[1:08:13] would love him with the same love that
[1:08:15] he loved them with and there's only one
[1:08:18] group of people that will love God back
[1:08:20] with the same love that he loved them
[1:08:23] and it's the special group I'm telling
[1:08:25] you about right now the group that he
[1:08:31] chose you know too often in our
[1:08:36] carnality we could just love God if
[1:08:39] we're only getting what we want you ever
[1:08:40] have somebody just like you when they
[1:08:42] when they get what they
[1:08:44] want but as soon as you say no they all
[1:08:47] a sudden
[1:08:49] because and that's a lot of how a lot of
[1:08:51] Christians are
[1:08:56] but we're a part of
[1:08:58] God and his thoughts from the very
[1:09:01] beginning brother Bri said in the
[1:09:02] message the identification of Christ in
[1:09:04] all ages he says and now
[1:09:06] remember if you ever did or ever will
[1:09:10] have eternal life you had it with him
[1:09:14] then see you had it with him because
[1:09:17] Jesus came and Jesus was the Redeemer
[1:09:20] and to re redeem anything means to bring
[1:09:22] back amen amen from whence from where it
[1:09:26] fallen from or where or went from redeem
[1:09:31] it bring it back and you the way you
[1:09:36] look who you are what your name is that
[1:09:40] was in God's thinking before the
[1:09:42] foundation of the world Amen and God and
[1:09:46] Jesus came not to save the whole thing
[1:09:49] he wanted to but he come to redeem back
[1:09:53] that them that was his in his thoughts
[1:09:57] from the beginning what a beautiful
[1:10:00] quote amen it just puts it exactly like
[1:10:04] it
[1:10:06] is in possessing all things brother the
[1:10:09] ram say is a beautiful type of us today
[1:10:11] unworthy worthy of death when we sin but
[1:10:15] God cannot kill us because we're a part
[1:10:18] of
[1:10:19] Christ see that's our Grace because we
[1:10:23] are in Union with Christ isn't that a
[1:10:26] beautiful thought Union with Christ so
[1:10:29] therefore our sins when we do them we
[1:10:34] ought to quickly confess
[1:10:36] them that they're wrong amen because God
[1:10:40] would take our
[1:10:42] life just because we're connected to God
[1:10:45] doesn't mean we can get away with
[1:10:47] whatever we want to
[1:10:48] do no if we belong to Christ we quickly
[1:10:51] want to make things right we do not want
[1:10:53] to go one hour outside of the will of
[1:10:56] God am we don't want to just oh deal
[1:10:58] with it later
[1:11:02] no you're expressing to God that you do
[1:11:05] not love him because of this certain
[1:11:08] love you have for the world or the
[1:11:09] certain hate you have for somebody
[1:11:12] else that's right God is calling us to
[1:11:14] be in His image don't expect God to come
[1:11:16] down to our image
[1:11:20] Amen in the message identification
[1:11:23] brother said if he is a redeemer he come
[1:11:26] to redeem uh to redeem us to pick up
[1:11:30] that which was Fallen to redeem back to
[1:11:32] a place where we were at the beginning
[1:11:34] so none will be picked up from them that
[1:11:39] was in his thoughts at the beginning so
[1:11:42] none will be picked up but them that was
[1:11:45] in his thoughts at the
[1:11:48] beginning that's why it's important to
[1:11:52] know to know that you are in God's
[1:11:55] thoughts it's so
[1:11:58] important that way the devil can't come
[1:12:01] and begin to play with you that oh
[1:12:03] you're not a Christian this is all fake
[1:12:05] no I've made a decision and here is the
[1:12:09] proof that I made my decision I put my
[1:12:13] state down and I'm serving God to the
[1:12:15] best of my ability every single day in
[1:12:17] my
[1:12:18] life because that's the Revelation that
[1:12:21] I got not why I I I repented I got
[1:12:24] baptized now I'm just going to go to
[1:12:26] halfheartedly serve God and think that I
[1:12:29] belong to God you're on dangerous
[1:12:31] territory there is no scripture there is
[1:12:33] no quote there is nothing that's going
[1:12:35] to back that up stay under the word stay
[1:12:39] under the word that is the blood for the
[1:12:41] day is the word of God Amen the bleeding
[1:12:45] word he come to
[1:12:47] redeem not this Canon
[1:12:51] fder that we see around professing to be
[1:12:55] Christians but that he came to
[1:12:58] redeem that was in God's thinking at the
[1:13:02] beginning see all we're we are is we are
[1:13:05] an expression of what God was thinking
[1:13:08] think about that we're we're an
[1:13:10] expression of what God was
[1:13:13] thinking and when you see that your life
[1:13:15] is not lining up with the word you
[1:13:17] quickly say this is more important to me
[1:13:19] than my
[1:13:22] will
[1:13:24] Jesus said blessed are your eyes for
[1:13:26] they see and your ears for they hear
[1:13:28] we're a blessed people brother B said in
[1:13:30] the message of revelation of Jesus
[1:13:32] Christ he says that means this book
[1:13:34] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:13:37] special class of people
[1:13:44] right do you believe you're that class
[1:13:47] am amen you can expect God to reveal
[1:13:52] himself to you you it's imperative that
[1:13:55] we seek the full revelation of who we
[1:13:58] are who we are in
[1:14:00] Christ the brandom said in the message
[1:14:02] of revelation of Jesus Christ he says
[1:14:05] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[1:14:07] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:14:09] church and defile it right it's
[1:14:13] true you can't go anywhere without you
[1:14:16] know the devil hanging
[1:14:19] around making it lukewarm making it form
[1:14:23] making it powerless it exposes Satan he
[1:14:28] fights that he cannot stand it he knows
[1:14:30] that if the people can get the true
[1:14:32] revelation of the true
[1:14:34] church and what she is what she stands
[1:14:39] for and that she can do the Greater
[1:14:42] Works she will be an invincible Army
[1:14:47] amen by coming in Union with the thought
[1:14:50] of
[1:14:51] God God has has the
[1:14:54] thought he already has the thought we
[1:14:57] got to come in Union with that thought
[1:14:59] we're the ones that need to to to get
[1:15:01] that thought to become an invincible
[1:15:05] Army I'll tell you I see too often the
[1:15:08] devil trying to beat up
[1:15:13] Christians you know you don't defeat the
[1:15:15] Devil with uh momentum and and and your
[1:15:20] favorite song and and your I'm going to
[1:15:23] fight
[1:15:25] him with your at no you just you you you
[1:15:29] you fight them with the same same thing
[1:15:31] that Jesus fought him with the word of
[1:15:33] God it is
[1:15:39] written and you stay there because the
[1:15:42] devil's going to keep going like this
[1:15:44] and you got to
[1:15:45] keep keep giving the
[1:15:48] word if they get a true revelation of
[1:15:51] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:15:52] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:15:55] discern to withstand the Antichrist
[1:15:57] Satan will be powerless before
[1:16:03] her if we are a part of God we are a
[1:16:06] part of the
[1:16:07] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:16:09] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:16:12] Amen in the message identification
[1:16:14] brother Brandon said then if you were
[1:16:16] with God in his thoughts at the
[1:16:18] beginning how can you deny his word
[1:16:21] being true when you're a part of the
[1:16:25] word I've you know brother br's often
[1:16:28] said you say you got the Holy Ghost but
[1:16:30] how can you deny the word which the Holy
[1:16:32] Ghost wrote
[1:16:35] amen I mean we have an
[1:16:39] absolute my feelings are not absolute my
[1:16:41] ideas are not absolute my imagination
[1:16:43] this is what I think God wants me to do
[1:16:46] that that does not mean
[1:16:50] anything it's sinking sand
[1:16:55] but if you humble yourself to the word
[1:16:57] regardless and I'll say this you will
[1:17:00] have to not lean on your understanding
[1:17:02] to stay with the word you will do things
[1:17:05] you don't feel like doing you will bring
[1:17:07] yourself under subjection to that word
[1:17:10] and when you do you will now be kept by
[1:17:13] the power of God Amen but you got to put
[1:17:17] your foot forward
[1:17:19] amen when we're reading the Bible you
[1:17:21] know what we're doing we're exploring
[1:17:23] the very thoughts of God Amen how
[1:17:26] precious are thy thoughts unto me oh God
[1:17:29] how great is the sum of them if I should
[1:17:33] count them they are more in number than
[1:17:36] the sand and when I awake I'm still with
[1:17:39] did you ever have a bad
[1:17:42] dream we should all like raise our hands
[1:17:44] with that one because we probably had
[1:17:45] one this week you know what I'm
[1:17:47] saying Satan just doesn't doesn't like
[1:17:50] to leave us
[1:17:52] alone and you wake up and you
[1:17:56] say GL that was just a
[1:17:58] dream when I
[1:18:01] awake I am still with thee God Is With
[1:18:04] Us amen he is still with
[1:18:07] us the Su of God's thoughts are he that
[1:18:11] we are the apple of his eye the Bible
[1:18:13] says
[1:18:14] amen Ze Zechariah 28 says and he that
[1:18:18] toucheth you toucheth the apple of his
[1:18:21] eye his eyes are over the righteous and
[1:18:25] his ears are open to the
[1:18:28] cries Jesus himself said the two spirits
[1:18:31] in the last days would be so close that
[1:18:33] it would deceive the very
[1:18:34] elect if it was
[1:18:36] possible but because the elect are part
[1:18:39] of the word no matter how much they
[1:18:41] stumble how much they fall how much they
[1:18:44] get out of the will of God God will
[1:18:47] bring them back has to because they are
[1:18:50] part of the word right
[1:18:54] this is what I say don't ever get in the
[1:18:57] habit of feeling comfortable out of the
[1:18:58] will of God that is one of the worst one
[1:19:02] of the
[1:19:03] worst uh
[1:19:05] signs that you do not belong to him not
[1:19:08] all that
[1:19:10] strong but look God is not raising
[1:19:14] disobedient
[1:19:17] children and God does God does not
[1:19:20] encourage us to play roulette
[1:19:23] he doesn't want us to gamble we only got
[1:19:26] enough time to get ready and if we have
[1:19:29] the love of God in the heart we care
[1:19:30] about getting other people ready and
[1:19:32] that's the main thing because no matter
[1:19:34] if we get people ready we don't get
[1:19:35] people ready we serve God or don't serve
[1:19:37] God this is a for sure thing Jesus is
[1:19:39] coming and he's coming
[1:19:42] soon so it's up to us where where we
[1:19:45] want to fit
[1:19:46] in brother bam talks about these two
[1:19:49] Spirits he calls one the true church and
[1:19:51] the other the false Church
[1:19:54] the true church is receiving and
[1:19:56] manifesting the word the false church is
[1:19:59] just hearing the word but as we read is
[1:20:04] lukewarm formal and
[1:20:08] Powerless see how close they can be they
[1:20:10] still go to church they still live good
[1:20:14] lives but there's no power to overcome
[1:20:18] amen no power to overcome their
[1:20:21] situations Jesus said the false church
[1:20:25] has identified
[1:20:28] themselves as having need of nothing
[1:20:31] think about that a person who acts like
[1:20:33] I don't need
[1:20:35] you I don't need to go to church I don't
[1:20:38] need to I don't need to pay tie I
[1:20:42] don't you are identifying yourself who
[1:20:45] you are I don't need to do it you're
[1:20:48] doing
[1:20:50] it and the sum of his thoughts towards
[1:20:52] that church is I will spew them out of
[1:20:55] my
[1:20:57] mouth but God's true church is still
[1:21:00] pressing in
[1:21:03] am towards the character of Jesus
[1:21:07] Christ becoming the manifested word of
[1:21:10] the hour the Bible tells us the whole
[1:21:12] earth is groaning and waiting for us
[1:21:15] right to be
[1:21:18] manifested and and I'll tell you if the
[1:21:20] whole earth is groaning waiting for that
[1:21:22] why are
[1:21:24] we why are why why are we waiting for
[1:21:27] somebody else to get excited in the Lord
[1:21:29] and to start saying Amen to the word and
[1:21:31] believe in it before we
[1:21:33] do amen why why are we waiting for five
[1:21:37] other Davids to rise up before we say oh
[1:21:39] yeah I'm going to be on David's
[1:21:44] side the true church is still mortifying
[1:21:47] the Deeds of her
[1:21:49] body she's still dying daily
[1:21:53] and the sum of God's thoughts towards
[1:21:55] the true church is he is protecting them
[1:22:01] he is protecting
[1:22:04] them one group he spews out of the mouth
[1:22:06] the other group he's protecting them
[1:22:08] he's in they're in the palm of his hand
[1:22:10] the Bible says that no man can pluck
[1:22:12] them out not even the devil can get to
[1:22:15] them all
[1:22:18] because it started with his love towards
[1:22:21] them
[1:22:23] and now because he first loved us we can
[1:22:26] love him we've set our love upon him we
[1:22:30] made him our habitation
[1:22:33] right and that's why nothing can harm us
[1:22:37] I don't care what you're going through I
[1:22:39] don't care what the devil is trying to
[1:22:41] destroy God's thoughts are precious
[1:22:43] towards
[1:22:46] us we have set our affection upon him
[1:22:51] we're not turning back
[1:22:53] we're sold out we're going
[1:22:56] through well what if they lock the doors
[1:22:59] I'm going through that shows I'm just a
[1:23:01] little bit
[1:23:03] closer one group claiming that they
[1:23:05] don't need
[1:23:07] anything more than what they have is
[1:23:11] being spewed out of the mouth as Jesus
[1:23:13] said in the last days he would separate
[1:23:16] the gos from the
[1:23:18] Sheep he would do it he knows how to do
[1:23:21] it
[1:23:23] brother John this is a little
[1:23:24] discouraging what do you get why you
[1:23:25] saying that because I want to get to
[1:23:26] this part the other group cannot be
[1:23:29] separated from Christ amen they have
[1:23:33] received his Spirit they've received his
[1:23:35] word they've received his love and they
[1:23:36] cannot be separated from him nothing can
[1:23:39] separate them let's look at the sum of
[1:23:42] God's thoughts towards his
[1:23:44] elect there's no tribulation nor
[1:23:47] distress or persecution or famine
[1:23:51] nakedness peril or sword do you know
[1:23:53] these
[1:23:54] scriptures do you know these scriptures
[1:23:57] say Amen neither death nor life nor
[1:23:59] angels nor principalities nor powers nor
[1:24:03] things present nor things to come nor
[1:24:06] height nor death nor any other
[1:24:09] creature shall be able to separate them
[1:24:13] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:24:15] Jesus our
[1:24:16] lord nothing can separate well brother
[1:24:20] John you don't know what I'm going
[1:24:21] through
[1:24:24] I will say Amen to
[1:24:26] that but I want to say this you don't
[1:24:30] know the God who we serve
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:36] because I would rather believe what the
[1:24:39] word says about me than what I feel
[1:24:41] about myself or what anybody else says
[1:24:43] about
[1:24:44] me how precious
[1:24:46] are his thoughts towards me amen amen
[1:24:52] these thoughts towards me are precious
[1:24:55] thoughts the very sum of
[1:24:58] them is I'm going to be with him when
[1:25:02] you read the last
[1:25:05] chapter the spirit and the bride say
[1:25:07] come we're going to be
[1:25:09] together the said in the message
[1:25:11] identification he said but there is
[1:25:13] nothing going to separate said the Bible
[1:25:15] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:25:17] Jesus persecution Peril death itself
[1:25:21] cannot separate us
[1:25:24] because we all was always was in his
[1:25:29] thoughts all
[1:25:32] right we were always in his thoughts
[1:25:35] that's what makes the difference amen
[1:25:38] why it's important to remember
[1:25:40] that you know we get so stuck on well
[1:25:43] I'm in this mess and how do I deal with
[1:25:45] it look trust
[1:25:49] God keep connected to God
[1:25:54] the the Bible says that the sufferings
[1:25:55] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:25:57] be compared with the glory which shall
[1:25:59] be revealed in US think about the sum of
[1:26:03] our
[1:26:05] sufferings cannot be compared with the
[1:26:07] glory that shall be revealed in us what
[1:26:09] a precious
[1:26:11] thought all of us have done so many
[1:26:13] things in our lives that was out of the
[1:26:15] perfect will of
[1:26:17] God absolutely wrong against the word of
[1:26:20] God we've been selfish we've been evil
[1:26:23] we've been offensive to God sometimes
[1:26:26] living in the carnality of the flesh
[1:26:29] living with enity with
[1:26:31] God not even able to come to church and
[1:26:35] receive from God living in iniquity the
[1:26:39] Bible says the way of a transgressor is
[1:26:42] hard First Corinthians tells us that the
[1:26:45] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:26:48] the spirit of God for their foolishness
[1:26:50] unto him neither can can he know them
[1:26:53] because they are spiritually
[1:26:56] discerned that's an awful condition to
[1:26:59] be in and we've all been in we can we
[1:27:00] know we know what that's
[1:27:03] saying it is a such a a scary lonely
[1:27:08] feeling to be away from God
[1:27:12] Amen and H you get to a place that you
[1:27:16] do not care what happens you got to have
[1:27:19] that relationship close back to him
[1:27:22] that's and God knows how to turn things
[1:27:25] around he's been doing it since man fell
[1:27:28] he's been reconciling man back to
[1:27:30] himself from the very beginning he knows
[1:27:34] how to do it Jesus said in John 6:39 all
[1:27:39] for of all which he have the father has
[1:27:42] given me I shall lose nothing but shall
[1:27:47] raise them up again at the last day God
[1:27:50] is not going to lose one of us
[1:27:52] amen no matter what the devil says amen
[1:27:57] God has been in the restoration business
[1:27:59] brother Stan used to work on restoring
[1:28:02] after uh floods and fires and things
[1:28:04] like that he we worked on restoring this
[1:28:07] after there was a flood God is in the
[1:28:10] restoration is that's his business and
[1:28:12] Jesus said I must be about my father's
[1:28:15] business and we must be about not only
[1:28:19] making sure that we're
[1:28:20] restored but we need to care about our
[1:28:22] fellow brother and sister they've got
[1:28:24] their names on the book too they just
[1:28:26] don't know it
[1:28:28] yet he knows how to take our current
[1:28:31] situations and turn them
[1:28:35] around turn with me if you would to
[1:28:37] Romans chapter 8 as
[1:28:40] we conclude this getting ready to wrap
[1:28:43] this
[1:28:45] up and I'm glad there was no amens after
[1:28:48] that statement
[1:28:51] there
[1:28:52] Romans
[1:28:55] 8:27 and
[1:28:57] he that searcheth the
[1:29:00] hearts
[1:29:03] knoweth what is the mind of the
[1:29:06] spirit he that searcheth our hearts
[1:29:10] knows what is the mind of the spirit the
[1:29:13] thoughts of the
[1:29:15] spirit because he maketh
[1:29:18] intercession for the Saints
[1:29:22] not according to what we would like to
[1:29:25] get out of this
[1:29:27] situation but he's making intercession
[1:29:30] according to the will of
[1:29:35] God his thoughts are higher than our
[1:29:37] thoughts
[1:29:39] amen amen and we
[1:29:42] know that all things work together for
[1:29:45] the good to them that love
[1:29:48] God to them who are called called
[1:29:53] according
[1:29:54] to nobody's purpose in
[1:29:57] here there's only one
[1:29:59] purpose God's
[1:30:02] purpose God's
[1:30:06] purpose you can love
[1:30:08] God you can be in the middle of his
[1:30:11] purpose and go off the deep
[1:30:14] end because you don't stay prayed up you
[1:30:16] don't you you something
[1:30:20] happens
[1:30:22] but God knows how to turn things
[1:30:26] around because he's making inter
[1:30:30] intercession for us according to the
[1:30:32] will of God and that's all that matters
[1:30:35] when it's all said and done everything
[1:30:37] that I did for myself will not be
[1:30:42] there it's what I did for Christ by
[1:30:46] Christ in love that was according to his
[1:30:49] purpose the green lights have to line up
[1:30:53] up you understand when we go to heaven
[1:30:55] we're not going to our kingdom we're
[1:30:57] going to his
[1:31:00] kingdom we get to sit with him on his
[1:31:02] throne he ain't sitting with us on our
[1:31:05] Throne all right for whom he did Forno
[1:31:09] his thoughts now he also did
[1:31:12] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:31:14] image of his son that he might be the
[1:31:17] firstborn among many of us moreover whom
[1:31:22] he did predestinate them he also called
[1:31:26] and to whom he called them he also
[1:31:28] Justified and to whom he justified them
[1:31:31] he also
[1:31:33] glorified what shall we say to these
[1:31:36] things if God before
[1:31:41] us it doesn't matter who's against us
[1:31:45] because it won't Prosper any weapon
[1:31:47] formed against the you won't
[1:31:50] Prosper because God is for us he's the
[1:31:54] one that holds Us in the palm of his
[1:31:57] hand he that spared not his own son but
[1:32:01] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:32:05] not with him also freely give us all
[1:32:09] things see God knows our
[1:32:12] situations he promised to the Bible says
[1:32:16] that he wants to bless us above all that
[1:32:18] we could ask or even think amen his
[1:32:22] ability is to bless us
[1:32:24] more he just wants us to trust him obey
[1:32:27] the word trust and Obey get into that
[1:32:30] vein get into that vein don't try to
[1:32:32] receive from God without being in that
[1:32:36] vein who shall lay anything to the
[1:32:39] charge I'm sorry what verse are we in
[1:32:42] that's right all right who shall lay
[1:32:44] anything to the charge of God's
[1:32:45] elect it is God that justify you know it
[1:32:49] doesn't matter what anybody says about
[1:32:50] you that's right am and I'll say this
[1:32:55] people are going to say things about you
[1:32:58] they that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[1:33:00] they're going to suffer
[1:33:04] persecution the thing that God has let
[1:33:06] us
[1:33:07] know is it's those that are not seed are
[1:33:10] the ones that persecute the
[1:33:12] seed come on that's just scripture am
[1:33:15] and I'm saying that because if we're
[1:33:17] getting in the habit of saying negative
[1:33:19] things I want you to identify yourself
[1:33:21] in the scripture don't take a look at
[1:33:23] that
[1:33:24] scripture because we need to stop doing
[1:33:26] it
[1:33:27] right elect does not persecute
[1:33:30] elect it just
[1:33:35] doesn't who shall lay anything to the
[1:33:37] charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:33:39] justifi who is he that
[1:33:41] condemneth it is Christ that
[1:33:45] died think about somebody who who
[1:33:47] condemned you who just really you know
[1:33:50] just gave you a hard time and said
[1:33:53] you're no good for
[1:33:56] nothing you're
[1:33:59] bad don't go to that extremes you
[1:34:02] know Christian wouldn't do that what you
[1:34:04] just did okay we' we've all dealt with
[1:34:07] stuff like that
[1:34:08] right here's the thing to anybody that
[1:34:11] says
[1:34:13] that did that person die for
[1:34:16] you did that person lay down his life
[1:34:19] for you usually people that are pointing
[1:34:22] fingers aren't willing to do anything to
[1:34:24] help to be honest with
[1:34:27] you but when Jesus when he's correcting
[1:34:31] us he's still protecting us he's still
[1:34:35] holding us he's still shielding us we're
[1:34:38] still in that that City of Refuge amen
[1:34:41] and I love the scripture who is he that
[1:34:43] condemneth it is Christ that died yay
[1:34:46] rather that is risen again who is even
[1:34:48] at the right hand of God and he's making
[1:34:51] in intercession for us
[1:34:54] today

[1:35:02] is let's Stand Together Philippians
