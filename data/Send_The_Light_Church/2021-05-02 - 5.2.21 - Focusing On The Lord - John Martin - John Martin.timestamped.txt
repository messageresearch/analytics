[34:11] i honestly thought we'd never ever go
[34:14] through what we're going through right
[34:15] now

[34:20] prophet said there's a squeeze coming
[34:21] somehow it's got to come

[34:25] read the scriptures and pray and then
[34:27] have you be seated and
[34:28] just share a couple things but if you
[34:30] would turn with me to the book of
[34:33] chapter 12 for opening scripture
[34:37] amen it's good to be with you all today
[34:42] i want to say it's been a while since
[34:45] we've been here
[34:47] thank you for inviting me back
[34:51] amen let's look to the lord in prayer
[34:53] and then we'll read a couple verses
[34:54] heavenly father
[34:56] we want to thank you for the privilege
[34:57] that we have today to be a christian
[35:01] lord that you've placed a desire in our
[35:03] heart to want to serve you
[35:05] you also placed a seed there that
[35:07] connected with your word that
[35:10] lord when we hear the truth something
[35:13] inside of us
[35:14] responds with amen so be it
[35:18] and today lord we're inviting you to
[35:21] come in the revealing of your word we
[35:23] thank you for this time of worship but
[35:26] lord unless you would reveal yourself
[35:28] down deep inside
[35:30] lord there's not a chance of a change
[35:33] that would be everlasting
[35:35] and lord we've come here to be changed
[35:37] i've come here to become more like you
[35:40] and i pray that you would grant it lord
[35:42] today as we look into these scriptures
[35:43] looking for
[35:44] encouragement looking for comfort
[35:47] looking for strength
[35:49] lord we know that inside of you are
[35:52] all these things and we just pray that
[35:54] you come now and have your way with our
[35:55] hearts
[35:57] lift us up into heavenly places we love
[35:59] you we thank you for these things
[36:01] trust you now in jesus christ's name
[36:03] amen
[36:04] amen hebrews chapter 12 very very
[36:07] familiar scriptures we've taken them a
[36:09] number of times but we just want to take
[36:10] a little thought
[36:12] different today chapter 12 verse
[36:15] number one we're foreseen we also are
[36:18] compassed about what's so great
[36:20] a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[36:23] every weight
[36:24] and the sin which just so easily beset
[36:26] us let us run with patience
[36:29] the race that is set before us looking
[36:32] unto jesus the author and finish of our
[36:34] faith
[36:34] who for the joy that was set before him
[36:36] endured the cross despising the shame
[36:39] and is set down at the right hand of the
[36:42] throne of god
[36:42] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[36:47] amen it is good to be with you
[36:52] i want to say i want to thank you for
[36:55] all your prayers
[36:56] for us um
[36:59] we appreciate them very very much we had
[37:03] a wonderful
[37:04] time of unwinding
[37:08] i would say of all the times that we
[37:10] went on vacation
[37:11] this time was probably the truest that i
[37:14] could see
[37:16] was a vacation for us
[37:20] we've done a lot of things when we went
[37:22] to savannah in the past and doing tours
[37:25] and
[37:26] and there's a lot of things to do still
[37:28] a lot of things we've never seen
[37:30] but we didn't do that um
[37:34] much of that this time and we i don't
[37:36] think we did much the last few years
[37:38] that we had gone there
[37:40] but uh i totally vacationed
[37:45] i you know brother mars been saying that
[37:47] to me for years
[37:48] for years but i how many times
[37:52] have you heard me brother mike you just
[37:54] can't you just
[37:55] you don't leave the burden come back to
[37:57] it you you carry it with you it's just
[37:59] wherever you go
[38:00] it's just and it's it's just been hard
[38:03] but i'll say it
[38:04] it was it was the grace of god to be
[38:08] able to just
[38:10] not think about
[38:13] things
[38:16] and uh we've heard this first time we
[38:19] ever able to like listen in on the
[38:20] services while we were gone
[38:22] and that was such a huge blessing
[38:24] because never really got to do that
[38:27] um and just just to know the word has
[38:30] been
[38:31] so good the word was good when we were
[38:32] gone just a wonderful word
[38:35] amen really really appreciate the word
[38:39] um and then work you know we've been
[38:41] working on a big project for about a
[38:42] year and a half and it was the last
[38:44] month and they the majority of that was
[38:48] done and uh under control we didn't have
[38:50] to worry about work and to worry about
[38:51] church
[38:53] and it was totally just i i didn't study
[38:57] for a while i'll be honest with you
[38:59] hang me if you want but it's a i've been
[39:02] doing it daily for i don't know how many
[39:03] years
[39:06] and just to know that i didn't have to
[39:08] preach that next sermon that i didn't
[39:09] have to study for that next sermon
[39:12] so that when i and then as soon as i did
[39:13] read my bible as soon as i did
[39:15] begin to pray as soon as i did begin to
[39:18] listen to a tape boom it's that
[39:20] brother bruce knows this that that gift
[39:22] just begins to go
[39:23] start again and uh
[39:26] and you you i i didn't realize
[39:31] um how bad i needed to vacation
[39:35] i just i've never been i never really
[39:37] experienced it honestly like i did
[39:40] it just with so many things
[39:43] and i'm i'm geared up to to start over
[39:46] again
[39:49] and uh but i'm so thankful to the lord
[39:52] for the time my wife is
[39:55] and is she drew closer to the lord she
[39:59] took this time
[40:00] her testimony was that she just dropped
[40:02] so closer to the lord and
[40:04] it's just wonderful all the way around
[40:08] it's very thankful for the word that we
[40:09] had that that message
[40:12] uh we had a lot of wonderful messages
[40:15] uh and i like this this last message we
[40:18] had sunday
[40:19] by brother bruce uh about being certain
[40:23] of god we're
[40:25] we're in a world of so much uncertainty
[40:30] and we know that we can be certain that
[40:33] god is true
[40:34] god's word is true
[40:37] he cannot lie we're so certain of that
[40:41] but you know what is the issue the the
[40:43] issue really is
[40:45] are we certain of our relationship with
[40:48] god
[40:49] amen that's really where it is because
[40:51] god is not a liar he's not going to
[40:53] change but the problem is is
[40:58] satan tries to get the world thinking
[41:01] they're certain
[41:02] man you'll come to me in that day and
[41:04] say lord lord did not die they were so
[41:06] certain they were gonna make it to the
[41:09] rapture
[41:11] so there's a false sense of certainty so
[41:14] it's
[41:15] when jesus said be ready what was he
[41:16] really saying
[41:18] we we know that god is certain
[41:22] amen and we know the word is the world
[41:25] is not
[41:25] certain but we need to be certain of our
[41:30] relationship with god that's what we
[41:31] need to be certain about
[41:34] that's why we come to church is
[41:38] is to that's how we get ready
[41:43] that's how we become certain with god
[41:46] our relationship with god
[41:53] i got to exercise when i was there
[41:57] i also found out when i got back on the
[41:59] scale that i gained weight
[42:01] and that's why i'm never going to
[42:02] exercise again
[42:06] i knew that was a culprit
[42:10] well i tell you when i first started i i
[42:14] walked the beach and then came back
[42:17] and i'll tell you it was it was hard
[42:21] walking in that sand not being used to
[42:23] it
[42:25] and i thought well this is the time i'm
[42:27] not gonna i'm not doing anything else i
[42:29] might as well take care of myself
[42:32] and so i began to walk more and i began
[42:36] to jog
[42:37] and i could oh man i was so out of
[42:39] breath i didn't think i'd be able to i
[42:40] was like embarrassed to
[42:41] you know you go out there and you see
[42:42] people jog in there it's like
[42:45] you're like no problem i can't hardly
[42:47] make it you know
[42:48] 300 feet
[42:54] so i went bought some running
[42:57] bought this half exercise ball i was
[42:59] there had it shipped to be there
[43:01] so i'm laying on trying to do these
[43:03] sit-ups and
[43:05] the point i'm saying all this to bring
[43:07] you with me
[43:08] is when i first started out i could
[43:10] hardly do anything
[43:12] but by the time i was done i was able to
[43:14] run four miles without stopping
[43:18] that's how our faith is our faith maybe
[43:20] can't do a whole lot what we'd like it's
[43:22] about to do now
[43:22] but if you just keep exercising a little
[43:25] bit
[43:26] and it's hard it is hard to exercise
[43:28] your faith because you gotta let go and
[43:29] trust god
[43:30] gotta let go of situations and trust god
[43:33] it's not easy but if you continue to
[43:35] exercise
[43:36] you will grow in christ so we spent some
[43:40] time
[43:42] uh exercising our body and i will just
[43:45] tell you
[43:45] what the scripture says that prophet
[43:47] little
[43:51] anything that you do to exercise this
[43:53] life and make it more comfortable
[43:55] it profits very little but we come this
[43:58] morning to exercise
[43:59] godliness amen to grow in christ
[44:05] this morning we want to entitle this
[44:06] message focusing on the lord
[44:09] and for a subject remembering to focus
[44:13] more on the lord remembering it's
[44:15] something that
[44:17] it's so easy not to remember and the
[44:21] more we can
[44:22] remember to focus on the lord the more
[44:24] we're going to see the lord
[44:27] in this late hour we're living in it's
[44:29] really hard to focus
[44:31] on the lord just about every text i'm
[44:34] getting from overseas
[44:36] from a lot of them i'll just say it like
[44:37] this a lot of the news that we hear a
[44:40] lot of the pop-ups on the phone
[44:42] it's about colvin there are so many
[44:46] things to grab
[44:47] our attention to steal our attention
[44:50] covet is one of them how fast
[44:53] the world has changed in the last year
[44:57] sickness leaving behind mandatory mass
[45:01] to function in society mysterious
[45:04] vaccines
[45:05] that only time is going to tell what's
[45:07] happening
[45:10] a questionable economy fraud
[45:13] government corruption hijacking our
[45:16] constitution human trafficking
[45:20] unprecedented expansion of gays
[45:24] not just the rights i'm talking about
[45:26] the gays
[45:28] and i've never seen such an explosion
[45:31] before in life of something new than the
[45:33] transgenders
[45:34] that thing is an explosion it putting
[45:37] gay
[45:38] right and so far in the dust that thing
[45:41] took uh
[45:42] i don't know have 50 years to come about
[45:45] but this transgender
[45:47] in just years boom it's it's going to
[45:49] surpass the gays
[45:51] it is horrible yeah
[45:54] before we were talking about coming out
[45:56] of the closet and now they're telling
[45:58] a children or making it clear that
[46:00] children that are in grade school it's
[46:02] okay for them to make
[46:03] a decision of who they really are
[46:12] corrupted news that we can't trust
[46:15] no matter what you read you want to
[46:18] believe it
[46:18] but you can't tv corrupting everybody
[46:27] there's very few people that want to
[46:28] work anymore unless people want to work
[46:31] everywhere we went down there signs
[46:32] everywhere help wanted help wanted help
[46:35] wanting
[46:37] they they they kept telling us that they
[46:39] don't want to work because they're
[46:40] getting free money
[46:42] that's what i heard it's no longer the
[46:45] land of opportunity
[46:47] work for what you want
[46:51] no sir here comes another seamless check
[46:54] unemployment extensions socialism
[46:58] doesn't give people a reason to want to
[47:01] get ahead
[47:04] satan the author of confusion the master
[47:07] of deception has made it very difficult
[47:09] for all of us
[47:10] to focus on what's really important
[47:11] which is the lord
[47:14] if we're not careful the enemy can even
[47:16] use us
[47:18] to grab attention from the lord
[47:22] so we'll want to get people to look at
[47:24] us because we feel like we have
[47:25] something that they don't
[47:28] when really we ought to be pointing
[47:30] people to the lord
[47:32] we don't want to deflect any attention
[47:34] away from the lord
[47:35] in fact we want to get people to look to
[47:37] the lord that's what
[47:38] reaching out is all about
[47:42] there's a lot of attention grabbers out
[47:45] there
[47:47] work can be a huge grabber
[47:50] of our attention finances
[47:54] bills house projects vacations
[47:58] car problems all the miscellaneous
[48:01] things that pop up
[48:04] but regardless of what's transpiring in
[48:06] the world or in our lives
[48:08] it's our personal responsibility to keep
[48:11] our focus on the lord
[48:13] we can't expect church to do it and we
[48:15] can't expect there to be
[48:17] no financial problems and we can't
[48:19] expect there to be no health problems
[48:21] and we can't
[48:21] expect everything to be just picture
[48:23] perfect for us to say okay
[48:25] i love you jesus i'm gonna spend some
[48:27] time with you
[48:31] we can make work our excuse we can make
[48:33] those things our excuses but
[48:35] in god's sight they will never be an
[48:37] excuse for us
[48:39] we and we alone have the responsibility
[48:43] of focusing not only on the author but
[48:45] the finisher of our faith we started him
[48:46] with christ
[48:47] and we need to continue on
[48:52] with so many things to divert our
[48:54] attention we need to help keep our eyes
[48:57] on jesus we need things to assist us to
[49:00] help us and
[49:01] i wrote down three things here
[49:04] i like that service that our brother
[49:07] josiah brought about three things
[49:11] but every single one of these three
[49:13] things i'm going to share with you
[49:16] takes discipline
[49:19] disciples of christ
[49:24] discipline themselves
[49:27] you don't ever find a christian who's
[49:30] not disciplined
[49:35] coming to church is number one
[49:42] it will help you keep your eyes on jesus
[49:45] coming to church preparing your heart
[49:47] and truly subjecting yourself
[49:48] to the living word will always improve
[49:51] your focus
[49:54] i'm talking about just coming to church
[49:56] and being a pew warmer
[49:59] talking about really subjecting yourself
[50:01] to the word
[50:02] brother branham said it's where we come
[50:05] to know
[50:06] where we're standing with the lord
[50:13] god could use the latest news he could
[50:15] use your best friend
[50:16] he could use your favorite song but he
[50:19] chose to use the office of the sanctuary
[50:22] to deal with our lives and to show us
[50:25] playing there
[50:25] where we stand in our relationship with
[50:28] god and i know we don't want anybody
[50:29] telling us where we stand
[50:30] in our relationship with god and i am
[50:32] not here to tell you where you stand
[50:34] with your relationship with god because
[50:36] i don't know
[50:39] but i know the word does amen
[50:47] and if you separate the man who's
[50:50] speaking
[50:51] from that word then god's got a chance
[50:54] to deal
[50:55] with your relationship
[50:58] but if it's all about brother john and
[51:00] me
[51:03] well it's going to be easy to turn the
[51:04] button off
[51:06] turn a deaf ear be have a hard heart
[51:12] god loves you god loves us
[51:16] but guaranteed we can't go in the
[51:18] rapture the way we are
[51:21] he's taking us somewhere and so
[51:27] coming here to hear the word
[51:31] is will help us to stay focused on him
[51:36] i think it was god who told moses and
[51:38] there
[51:39] i will meet with thee and i will commune
[51:42] with thee
[51:43] from above the mercy seat of all things
[51:46] which i give thee
[51:48] in commandment now that's referring to
[51:50] your heart
[51:53] what's really happening in there it's
[51:55] not referring to the things that happen
[51:57] during the day
[52:01] it isn't about you know we want answers
[52:02] for this this this and this this
[52:04] god is communion with the things that
[52:07] he's commanding you
[52:08] to do brother branham said in the
[52:11] message
[52:12] uh uh the mercy seat of christ
[52:17] no the mercy seat of christ
[52:32] god rich in mercy god rich in mercy
[52:36] he said there's two parts to redemption
[52:40] one is coming out and one is going in
[52:43] right amen and we know when we all came
[52:46] to christ
[52:47] it was total god's mercy we weren't
[52:50] looking for him
[52:50] we didn't do nothing to deserve them it
[52:53] was god's mercy
[52:54] but he makes this statement a few times
[52:56] in this message he says that
[52:58] you cannot receive mercy without doing
[53:00] what he tells you to do
[53:03] so after you come to him that was mercy
[53:05] god rich in mercy
[53:07] no doubt about it but as you continue
[53:10] your walk
[53:10] you got to do what he tells you to do
[53:13] now why didn't the children of israel go
[53:15] into the promised land
[53:16] why didn't they receive that holy ghost
[53:19] that
[53:19] that promise of god they did not
[53:21] continue
[53:23] to walk in what god said they did not
[53:25] get the mercies of god they didn't
[53:27] continue to receive the mercies of god
[53:31] so it's really really important of what
[53:34] god speaks to us when we go to church
[53:38] because that's what he's wanting us to
[53:39] carry out
[53:43] he says we've got to carry out what god
[53:45] told us to do if we expect to have mercy
[53:47] from god
[53:48] it's very strong nothing can take the
[53:52] place of church
[53:52] nothing and i'll say it like this all
[53:55] the morse we see the day approaching
[53:58] and we see the enemy just trying to lay
[54:00] so many things that it's not a big deal
[54:02] i can live stream or i can just catch up
[54:04] right
[54:04] i got this going and god understands
[54:07] friends that's you just what you're
[54:10] doing is you're speaking things
[54:12] that are not in the message you're
[54:14] speaking things that are not in the
[54:16] bible
[54:17] you're speaking thoughts that are not
[54:19] coming from the holy ghost
[54:26] number two brother brandon says if you
[54:28] pray sincerely and read your bible
[54:30] you'll become more spiritual the problem
[54:33] is we it gets out of balance
[54:36] too much reading and none of praying
[54:39] amen do you know what that will result
[54:41] in i've seen it many times a religious
[54:43] spirit
[54:45] a religious spirit because you've got so
[54:48] much word
[54:50] which brother branham didn't say you
[54:53] can't read too much
[54:56] he said you can't pray too much if you
[54:58] want to get out of balance pray too much
[55:01] if you think if you think you're leaning
[55:05] towards
[55:07] i don't want to be out of bounds just
[55:09] pray a whole bunch
[55:13] but to go ahead and and say lord bless
[55:15] the word i'm going to read today
[55:17] read for a half hour no
[55:20] pray as much as you read
[55:24] keep the balance because you'll keep the
[55:26] right spirit
[55:32] the devil don't mind if you get
[55:34] religious
[55:36] he just doesn't want you living the life
[55:40] he doesn't want you selling out to spend
[55:42] more time to win a soul for jesus
[55:45] become puffed up religious and and no
[55:48] more and feel you got something
[55:50] right prayer will put you
[55:55] it'll put you in the driver's seat with
[55:56] god
[56:00] number three brother brahms said that
[56:02] faith
[56:03] that we need to make this rapture lies
[56:06] within the tapes
[56:08] did not he say that but just listening
[56:12] to the message
[56:13] won't bring that faith it needs to
[56:16] become real to you it needs to become
[56:18] personal to you
[56:21] if god speaks to you it may not be
[56:24] enough
[56:25] you've got to respond with a course of
[56:28] action
[56:32] you've got to god is never ever
[56:35] you look when he called all his
[56:36] disciples he he called paul he called
[56:39] all his disciples
[56:40] he said come and i'll make you fishers
[56:42] of men there was something to do from
[56:44] the gate
[56:46] right yeah you may go through a a period
[56:49] of
[56:50] training and learning and walking close
[56:52] with the lord but
[56:53] pretty soon you're going to get kicked
[56:54] out of the nest and he's going to tell
[56:55] you to go
[56:58] and do what i've called you to do
[57:03] now all three of these things require
[57:05] discipline to do them properly
[57:07] or else you'll read your bible without
[57:10] praying which we're all guilty of
[57:13] we'll listen to tapes while we're doing
[57:16] something else simultaneously
[57:20] it's the truth and though well at least
[57:23] where i'm getting some word
[57:25] well that's fine but you need
[57:28] that's not how you get rapturing faith
[57:30] friends well i got something out of it
[57:32] it made me
[57:33] it you know it just confirm
[57:36] that's wonderful but that's you need to
[57:39] get into that and be searching for what
[57:40] you need
[57:41] to do what god's called you to do
[57:46] if you're not careful you can come to
[57:48] church haphazardly
[57:51] but if we do things properly it'll help
[57:55] us to keep our eyes
[57:57] focused on the lord
[58:00] once we focus on the lord clearly we got
[58:04] the 20 20 vision
[58:06] the result will be we'll be working
[58:08] according to the purpose of god
[58:10] because we've been predestinated to his
[58:12] ministry
[58:14] to carry it out he he's gone and he left
[58:16] his disciples to carry it out he didn't
[58:18] give him something new to do
[58:21] and now it's our turn if we lived with
[58:23] the times of jesus we would have been in
[58:25] the upper room and
[58:26] we would have been uh persecuted and
[58:27] been scattered to
[58:29] another if we would have been the 13th
[58:30] or the 14th disciple
[58:32] we would have been out going to another
[58:33] country doing something
[58:37] but now we're living in this time and
[58:39] his purpose is the same
[58:43] we like to think things have changed but
[58:45] they're not
[58:47] because god's goal is to get his family
[58:49] together amen
[58:53] there's another thing that we can do to
[58:55] help keep focused but it requires
[58:57] discipline i want you turn with me to
[58:58] psalms 103 verse 1.
[59:08] are you with me today
[59:15] i want you to benefit
[59:19] from the lord today
[59:23] psalms 103 verse 1 is psalm of david
[59:25] bless
[59:26] the lord o my soul
[59:29] and all that's within me bless
[59:33] his holy name bless the lord all my soul
[59:37] and forget not all his benefits
[59:44] amen forget not all his benefits who
[59:46] forgiveth all thine iniquities
[59:48] who he with all thy diseases
[59:52] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[59:54] who crown of thee with lovingkindness
[59:56] and tender mercies who satisfyeth thy
[59:59] mouth with good
[1:00:00] things so that the youth is renewed
[1:00:03] like the eagles
[1:00:06] i think when i first met the lord
[1:00:10] or he came to me showed himself to me i
[1:00:13] didn't realize
[1:00:15] i realized i was bad i'm going to be
[1:00:16] honest with you that was a bad
[1:00:18] boy but i didn't realize how bad i was
[1:00:25] my life was headed for disaster but he
[1:00:28] redeemed my life from destruction
[1:00:31] can you imagine where we had been if we
[1:00:33] hadn't taken heed to the lord when we
[1:00:34] did
[1:00:35] amen i was a bad guy and i don't want to
[1:00:39] get into how bad it is just a bunch of
[1:00:40] time we heard it so many times
[1:00:44] i'll take a flip side here with another
[1:00:46] man his name was paul
[1:00:48] saul at the time now when he met the
[1:00:52] lord
[1:00:53] he was in a much better condition
[1:00:57] than i was he was a religious fanatic
[1:01:02] he was an extremist he believed in god
[1:01:04] so much he was willing to kill for it
[1:01:07] he had extreme confidence in his flesh
[1:01:12] we are told that he was circumcised the
[1:01:13] eighth day the stock of israel the tribe
[1:01:15] of benjamin
[1:01:16] a hebrew of the hebrews is touching law
[1:01:18] a pharisee concerning zeal
[1:01:20] he persecuted the church touching
[1:01:21] righteousness which is in the law
[1:01:24] he was blameless
[1:01:27] so if i stood next to saul
[1:01:31] i would be looking up to him and saying
[1:01:32] well i'm a bad guy
[1:01:35] amen because religiously
[1:01:40] he had it together
[1:01:44] and i wasn't religious
[1:01:47] so whether you're today halfway bad
[1:01:53] all the way bad or perfectly
[1:01:56] self-righteous
[1:01:57] know it all in your own eyes
[1:02:01] paul said it straight when he said in
[1:02:03] ephesians chapter 2 verse 3
[1:02:05] among whom also we all
[1:02:08] had our conversations in times past
[1:02:12] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:02:14] desires of our flesh
[1:02:16] and our mind and we're by nature the
[1:02:18] very nature
[1:02:20] we were born with the children of wrath
[1:02:22] even as others
[1:02:25] but god who was rich in mercy for his
[1:02:28] great love wherewith he
[1:02:29] loved us even when we were dead in our
[1:02:32] sins
[1:02:34] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:02:37] his only begotten son for you and i
[1:02:41] where would we be without god sharing
[1:02:44] his life with us
[1:02:48] god blessed and saved us
[1:02:51] amen he redeemed our life from
[1:02:54] destruction
[1:02:55] he forgave all of my sins all of my
[1:02:57] iniquities all of my transgressions
[1:03:00] he crowned me with loving kindness and
[1:03:02] tender mercies
[1:03:05] he has blessed my soul with freedom
[1:03:08] amen but at the same time it's made me
[1:03:11] feel in debt to him
[1:03:14] ever since i guess it doesn't make
[1:03:17] everyone feel that same way
[1:03:21] but people can forget that christ
[1:03:25] what christ has already done for them
[1:03:28] becomes something of the past
[1:03:32] peter talking about the importance of
[1:03:34] continuing to build your life in god's
[1:03:36] character
[1:03:38] he said that if the seven fruits of
[1:03:40] grace be inside of you
[1:03:42] they'll make you continue to be fruitful
[1:03:43] in christ did not he say that
[1:03:46] but ii peter chapter 1 verse 9 says but
[1:03:49] he that lacks these things is barren
[1:03:53] and is blind and cannot see
[1:03:56] afar off and have forgotten
[1:03:59] that he was purged from his old
[1:04:03] sins think about that state
[1:04:10] cannot see afar off
[1:04:15] in other words it's not really worth
[1:04:17] suffering for to try to help somebody
[1:04:19] right now because i ain't going to get
[1:04:20] nothing out of it
[1:04:22] can't see a far off can't see the
[1:04:24] benefit
[1:04:26] of how that's going to help that person
[1:04:28] can only
[1:04:29] see what's happening right here what i
[1:04:31] can get out of this right now
[1:04:36] i want to feel good right now i want to
[1:04:38] feel praised right now
[1:04:44] can't see you far off can't see
[1:04:47] eternal things all i can see is living
[1:04:49] for myself
[1:04:52] and have forgotten that he was purged
[1:04:56] from his old sins oh yes that's that's
[1:04:58] just old news i know that already
[1:05:01] he did that for me a long time it's done
[1:05:03] what do we need to keep
[1:05:04] you know going over that for
[1:05:08] it's in the past done
[1:05:11] forgotten why are those nail prints
[1:05:14] still there when we get to heaven
[1:05:20] he doesn't want us to forget
[1:05:24] it takes discipline on our end
[1:05:27] to keep him ever before us i think it
[1:05:30] was david it says i
[1:05:31] hide thy word in my heart that it not
[1:05:33] sin against thee
[1:05:37] today i feel more in debt to god than
[1:05:39] ever today
[1:05:40] you know how in debt you felt when you
[1:05:42] first got saved
[1:05:44] you're so happy you want to tell
[1:05:46] everybody
[1:05:47] you're excited you're a different person
[1:05:50] even though you were no different at
[1:05:51] that second you told everybody you're a
[1:05:54] changed person
[1:05:57] that's how excited you were about it
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:01] but you began to change that was the day
[1:06:04] that you began to change
[1:06:06] and god molded us into something that we
[1:06:09] never thought we'd become
[1:06:14] even though he paid my debt and set me
[1:06:17] free
[1:06:18] i now am in debt to god and become a
[1:06:21] prisoner to christ
[1:06:23] think about those thoughts so am i free
[1:06:28] am i free in my flesh to do what i want
[1:06:32] to do
[1:06:33] or am i free from my flesh
[1:06:37] people get so mixed up about why i can
[1:06:39] do what i want to do now because jesus
[1:06:41] set me free
[1:06:43] i can live my own life i can do my
[1:06:44] nobody's going to tell me
[1:06:46] that's why you can get those spirits on
[1:06:48] you
[1:06:50] when god's trying to tell you something
[1:06:52] i don't have to listen and i'm free
[1:06:53] jesus set me free
[1:06:54] we're not free right
[1:06:58] he bought us with a price we belong to
[1:07:01] him
[1:07:01] amen we're indebted to him
[1:07:05] he wants to remind us what he did for us
[1:07:10] i hung for you he doesn't want us to
[1:07:14] feel
[1:07:15] bondage but he
[1:07:18] he wants to remind us that we're not
[1:07:20] free in our flesh
[1:07:22] how can we be free in our flesh when
[1:07:24] we're supposed to mortify the deeds of
[1:07:26] our body every day and
[1:07:27] die daily and and and give up
[1:07:31] the the lust of the flesh
[1:07:37] so we're free to serve god
[1:07:42] freed from the flesh to serve god in the
[1:07:47] spirit
[1:07:47] to serve one another to reach out for
[1:07:54] souls
[1:07:56] it's not about just i've forgotten that
[1:07:58] he went to calvary for me
[1:08:01] romans 8 verse 12 says therefore
[1:08:03] brethren we are debtors
[1:08:05] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:08:10] come on can you say amen to the word i
[1:08:12] just just i just just spoke the word
[1:08:14] there
[1:08:14] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 15
[1:08:17] and that he died for all
[1:08:19] that they which live should not
[1:08:20] henceforth live unto themselves
[1:08:23] but unto him which died for them and
[1:08:26] rose again
[1:08:32] we remember calvary
[1:08:35] it isn't that we've forgotten calvary
[1:08:38] it isn't that we've that it hasn't had
[1:08:41] an
[1:08:41] effect on our life but sometimes we can
[1:08:44] forget
[1:08:47] the freshness of calvary in our lives
[1:08:50] the the realness today the impact
[1:08:54] today
[1:08:58] it needs to be more meaningful to us
[1:09:02] with all these distractions we need to
[1:09:03] keep focused on the lord
[1:09:09] sometimes we can forget the power of
[1:09:11] calvary that it has
[1:09:13] that it can continue to impact our life
[1:09:16] every day
[1:09:17] our faith can begin to dwindle because
[1:09:20] of the world
[1:09:21] you think about it the world invades our
[1:09:24] mind constantly
[1:09:26] we come to church and we hear the word a
[1:09:27] little bit
[1:09:29] we read a little bit listen to tapes a
[1:09:31] little bit but the devil's got us a lot
[1:09:33] more
[1:09:37] and so what is really needed is we need
[1:09:38] to discipline our thoughts
[1:09:41] when we're away from the lord when we're
[1:09:43] away from church
[1:09:45] when we're away from the bible in other
[1:09:47] words we need to be
[1:09:50] living what we're hearing during those
[1:09:53] times putting them
[1:09:54] into action we need to be remembering
[1:09:58] the lord
[1:10:03] sometimes i feel that we've forgotten
[1:10:06] that we owe
[1:10:07] god our lives on a daily basis
[1:10:10] we get to where we just feel like we owe
[1:10:12] my attendance at church
[1:10:17] we can feel free sometimes
[1:10:21] and forget that we've been bought with a
[1:10:23] price
[1:10:25] that we're no longer our own i think
[1:10:27] that's the reason a lot of people don't
[1:10:28] want to give their heart to the lord
[1:10:33] because they won't be able to do what
[1:10:34] they want to do
[1:10:37] and then there's a lot of people who who
[1:10:39] baptize and say i'm going to start with
[1:10:40] the lord but
[1:10:42] afterwards decide to swim back out into
[1:10:45] the world
[1:10:48] it's it's not for everybody
[1:10:52] and there's no way who is going to have
[1:10:54] a garden this year let me see your hands
[1:10:58] okay you're going to plant some tomato
[1:11:00] plants
[1:11:02] there's no way you can plant a tomato
[1:11:03] plant and expect cucumbers to come out i
[1:11:06] mean
[1:11:06] cucumbers will not come up
[1:11:10] because it's a tomato seed to begin with
[1:11:12] it will come forth as a tomato seed
[1:11:15] we don't know who's who we shouldn't be
[1:11:18] disappointed
[1:11:20] we we just need to be getting the word
[1:11:22] out to all
[1:11:23] as many as we can that's our job
[1:11:28] is as much i mean i
[1:11:32] cheryl says man you're looking dark
[1:11:36] i'm think she's um
[1:11:42] some i look like brother mark when i'm
[1:11:44] done
[1:11:47] and no matter what i do i can't be
[1:11:50] brother mark
[1:11:54] amen amen
[1:12:00] we just need to identify ourselves with
[1:12:03] the lord
[1:12:05] become the lord become his wife
[1:12:08] on a daily basis
[1:12:12] sometimes we can forget to bless the
[1:12:14] lord
[1:12:16] with our soul just use our lips
[1:12:20] just over this that i hope they do my
[1:12:23] favorite song
[1:12:24] what about just bless the lord with your
[1:12:26] soul amen
[1:12:29] bless him for what he's done for you
[1:12:31] sometimes we can forget
[1:12:32] all the benefits that he has for us
[1:12:36] we have a sign hanging in the office in
[1:12:38] the back this is working for the lord
[1:12:40] doesn't pay much
[1:12:41] but the benefits are out of this world
[1:12:44] it's true there's a a lot of benefits
[1:12:47] that are coming
[1:12:48] in the life but there are so many
[1:12:52] benefits here that we could have with
[1:12:54] the lord
[1:12:55] just want to take a look at those for a
[1:12:57] moment bless the lord oh my soul and
[1:12:59] forget not all
[1:13:00] his benefits think about the benefits of
[1:13:02] the lord think about how he treats you
[1:13:04] on a daily basis
[1:13:07] how he serves you how he supplies your
[1:13:10] needs
[1:13:11] how he provides for us god is so good
[1:13:15] think about the all the benefits god
[1:13:17] doesn't want us to forget
[1:13:19] sometimes we get so caught up and i need
[1:13:22] i need i want lord help with this and we
[1:13:24] forget
[1:13:24] the benefits that we have
[1:13:29] god doesn't want us to visualize him as
[1:13:31] an errand boy
[1:13:34] but he wants us to take time to count
[1:13:36] our blessings
[1:13:37] to name them one by to trust him when we
[1:13:40] have a need
[1:13:41] because the benefit of serving the lord
[1:13:44] is that he is a present
[1:13:46] help in a time of trouble
[1:13:50] a present help what a benefit
[1:13:54] to have a present help with you wouldn't
[1:13:57] you like to have enough money that you
[1:13:58] don't matter if your car blew up
[1:14:02] if the furnace just went on the air
[1:14:05] conditioning
[1:14:05] today you'll be happy to have air
[1:14:07] conditioning in your car in your home
[1:14:11] but it'll be nice to have enough money
[1:14:12] that no matter what happened
[1:14:18] absolutely we had a prophet came and
[1:14:21] told us that god has handed his bride
[1:14:23] the checkbook the benefits
[1:14:27] of being associated and attached
[1:14:30] to your husband who owns a cattle on a
[1:14:32] thousand hills
[1:14:34] the benefits amen forget not all
[1:14:38] his benefits that's a lot of benefits
[1:14:42] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:14:46] god promised to forgive all our
[1:14:49] iniquities
[1:14:51] do you believe that the bible says the
[1:14:54] father
[1:14:55] smote his sinless son at calvary
[1:14:59] surely had borne our griefs and carried
[1:15:01] our sorrows
[1:15:03] surely he was wounded for our
[1:15:04] transgression surely he was bruised for
[1:15:06] our iniquities
[1:15:09] it was paul told the romans in chapter 4
[1:15:11] verse 7 blessed are they
[1:15:13] whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins
[1:15:17] are covered god's love
[1:15:20] cover a multitude of sin that's right
[1:15:23] don't you
[1:15:24] think for a moment that yours are too
[1:15:27] great
[1:15:29] amen are too dirty are too bad
[1:15:33] shouldn't have happened
[1:15:37] do not be little demoralize
[1:15:41] or water down god's blood
[1:15:47] there's still power in the blood today

[1:19:32] the world is really going insane it's
[1:19:35] really going
[1:19:36] insane i remember years ago
[1:19:42] brother bill making a statement he said
[1:19:45] we're blessed just to have a sound mind
[1:19:50] in other words about a look at a
[1:19:52] situation and discern right and wrong
[1:19:55] because the world don't know who they
[1:19:58] are what they are
[1:20:00] they're just all right yeah whatever
[1:20:10] but he's continuing he's a present god
[1:20:13] he is still
[1:20:14] the i am amen not that i was
[1:20:18] the i am the remember what i'm doing for
[1:20:21] you what i did at calvary was for what
[1:20:23] happened yesterday
[1:20:25] hey man what i did at calvary what's
[1:20:27] gonna be for you
[1:20:30] tomorrow he's
[1:20:32] presently crowning the bride of christ
[1:20:35] with his loving kindness he's blessing
[1:20:38] her
[1:20:39] with his tender mercies think about the
[1:20:42] times
[1:20:43] he speaks to you no matter how strong it
[1:20:47] is
[1:20:48] no matter what how much correction how
[1:20:51] bad it was you can still feel his loving
[1:20:55] kindness and his correction
[1:20:59] he's still shown that way of escape
[1:21:02] he's still showing you he's crowning our
[1:21:05] lives with love
[1:21:08] he's covering a multitude of sin in our
[1:21:10] lives
[1:21:12] we're still his bride regardless
[1:21:20] he satisfies us with good things
[1:21:24] good things
[1:21:29] you know what it means to be real real
[1:21:31] hot
[1:21:32] to get that water just satisfies you
[1:21:36] while you get done running four miles
[1:21:38] and you find
[1:21:41] got to run anymore
[1:21:44] he satisfies us with good things
[1:21:47] regardless of what's happening in the
[1:21:49] world
[1:21:51] get in with jesus get in that little
[1:21:53] cove with jesus that little
[1:21:55] harbor with jesus he satisfies us
[1:21:59] he provides us with faith
[1:22:03] confidence with promises
[1:22:07] all the promises of god should should
[1:22:10] satisfy us today
[1:22:12] he renews our strength to keep us
[1:22:14] pressing
[1:22:15] the battle let's not forget
[1:22:18] this benefit he presents
[1:22:21] help to us anytime that we need it
[1:22:24] anytime we're in trouble
[1:22:25] that's a benefit now of course if you
[1:22:28] can't believe
[1:22:29] he's presently going to help you he
[1:22:30] won't
[1:22:32] so your faith activates the benefits
[1:22:38] now if you were all in the world never
[1:22:40] knew christ my message to you
[1:22:42] would be salvation
[1:22:49] but you're saved today you
[1:22:52] came out of egypt today
[1:22:56] that's not the message
[1:23:00] our message today is conforming into the
[1:23:03] image of christ
[1:23:06] is is following through
[1:23:11] there are benefits that god has for
[1:23:14] us so whatever else that's going through
[1:23:17] in our life
[1:23:18] we've got to believe that he is a
[1:23:20] present help
[1:23:21] in our time of trouble
[1:23:24] and it takes faith to activate that
[1:23:28] if we're back in egypt well then we just
[1:23:30] follow you know
[1:23:32] get pushed out it was basically god
[1:23:34] pushed him out
[1:23:39] but today we've got to believe
[1:23:42] believe that god's going to help us
[1:23:43] god's going to meet our needs amen
[1:23:47] god is leading us into a catching away
[1:23:51] amen he's leading us into a perfect love
[1:23:54] he's leading us into a perfect faith
[1:23:56] think of the benefits of the lord he
[1:23:59] is leading us we need to keep focused on
[1:24:03] that
[1:24:06] do you realize the benefit of being able
[1:24:08] just to use
[1:24:09] the name of jesus
[1:24:14] just using his name devils
[1:24:17] devils have to leave you
[1:24:21] you can command them out of your home
[1:24:23] out of your body
[1:24:24] out of your relationships just by the
[1:24:28] name of jesus
[1:24:31] our hearts are mended
[1:24:35] things are restored unity is fortified
[1:24:39] our church is blessed our church can
[1:24:43] overcome in the name of jesus
[1:24:45] it can grow it can even thrive in the
[1:24:47] name of jesus
[1:24:52] i've quoted this before but jfk
[1:24:56] he once said don't ask
[1:25:00] what this country can do for you
[1:25:06] ask what you can do for this country
[1:25:10] and a lot of times we can become so
[1:25:13] selfish
[1:25:13] in our thoughts
[1:25:17] asking what this church can do for me to
[1:25:19] make me feel better
[1:25:23] what you should be doing is asking lord
[1:25:26] what can i do for the church to help it
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:32] we're far enough along it ain't
[1:25:36] we're not new comers anymore
[1:25:39] we have a responsibility
[1:25:43] most everything that i've done i haven't
[1:25:46] been able
[1:25:47] i haven't been asked by another person
[1:25:52] but i've taken time to say with my heart
[1:25:54] lord what would you have me to do
[1:25:58] and when you hear a prophet say put the
[1:26:00] shell on the gun
[1:26:02] pull the trigger if it don't hit the
[1:26:05] target
[1:26:07] stick another one in don't you wait for
[1:26:10] somebody to ask you what to do
[1:26:15] your relationship with god should be
[1:26:16] greater than that
[1:26:19] don't wait for somebody to say stand up
[1:26:21] here and preach
[1:26:23] there's much more to church than
[1:26:25] preaching
[1:26:28] and if you want to preach get a mirror
[1:26:41] i'm so thankful for brother bruce in the
[1:26:42] ministry that we have here
[1:26:46] i i honestly can say this with
[1:26:49] all my heart i have seen such
[1:26:54] beauty develop in brother bruce and his
[1:26:57] ministry
[1:27:01] it's just been beautiful
[1:27:05] but i'm saying there's more to
[1:27:08] church than being behind here for an
[1:27:10] hour
[1:27:13] it's what you're doing the other 23
[1:27:15] hours of that day
[1:27:18] where is your heart for the church
[1:27:22] just take the time to say lord what
[1:27:24] would you have me do
[1:27:26] and i know this if you mean it from your
[1:27:28] heart god will show you what to do
[1:27:32] bringing one soul to christ
[1:27:35] is worth more than a million sermons
[1:27:39] worth more than all the sermons that we
[1:27:40] can preach
[1:27:43] it's not the ability to preach is
[1:27:46] letting god use your body
[1:27:48] to bring someone to jesus the value of
[1:27:51] that
[1:27:51] is so mighty did not he say that
[1:27:56] one leaving the lord
[1:28:00] is worth he'll he'll leave the 99 to go
[1:28:03] after that one
[1:28:05] amen god's heart
[1:28:08] is reaching out for those who are out of
[1:28:11] the way i want to ask you this question
[1:28:12] you've seen other people sitting in this
[1:28:14] church that you haven't seen in a while
[1:28:16] my question to you my brother my sister
[1:28:18] is why haven't you done anything about
[1:28:21] it
[1:28:26] well nobody told me i'm not their friend
[1:28:30] i thought you were their brother and
[1:28:31] sister
[1:28:38] see our lives can become just about us
[1:28:40] and our family
[1:28:44] but this church is not about us and our
[1:28:46] family
[1:28:47] amen it's about us and our family
[1:28:50] [Laughter]
[1:28:51] we're all the same family
[1:29:02] those are not my notes john 14 13
[1:29:05] thinking about the name of jesus now
[1:29:06] whatsoever you ask in my name
[1:29:08] that will i do think of that benefit
[1:29:12] whatever you ask in my name that will i
[1:29:15] do
[1:29:16] that the father may be glorified in the
[1:29:18] son
[1:29:19] if you ask anything in my name i will do
[1:29:22] it
[1:29:24] the benefit of the name of jesus what a
[1:29:28] benefit that name
[1:29:29] amen sometimes we just bow our heads
[1:29:32] okay i gotta pray sometimes we get at
[1:29:34] the table and it's time to pray and
[1:29:36] everybody's going
[1:29:37] you pray i prayed last time you pray
[1:29:42] what a benefit amen to use the name of
[1:29:45] jesus to lift up the name of jesus
[1:29:50] bless the lord church for getting out
[1:29:53] his benefits
[1:29:57] did you know that god sends the holy
[1:29:58] ghost to you
[1:30:00] to your heart in his name
[1:30:04] it's through the name of jesus that's
[1:30:05] what the scripture says john 14
[1:30:07] verse 26 but the comforter which is the
[1:30:10] holy ghost
[1:30:11] whom the father will send in my
[1:30:14] name yes he shall teach you all things
[1:30:17] and bring all things to your remains
[1:30:18] whatsoever

[1:30:23] jesus
[1:30:24] will bring all things to your
[1:30:26] remembrance
[1:30:28] whatsoever i've told i don't think god
[1:30:31] wants us to forget
[1:30:34] god wants us to remember the benefits
[1:30:36] that we have amen
[1:30:39] in my name they shall lay hands on the
[1:30:42] sick
[1:30:43] and they shall recover what a benefit
[1:30:47] we don't want to forget it sometimes we
[1:30:48] just go home sick
[1:30:52] you know i've already tried it it didn't
[1:30:54] work
[1:30:57] well if i go up again i'm not supposed
[1:30:59] to go for prayer every time that's right
[1:31:00] you're not supposed to
[1:31:04] you're supposed to get serious with god
[1:31:07] spend more time with him in prayer and
[1:31:10] when you're serious about believing it
[1:31:11] with all your heart no matter what
[1:31:13] then you come up for prayer amen
[1:31:16] the scripture says let the elders uh
[1:31:20] anoint you with oil and lay hands on you
[1:31:23] that is scripture that's a benefit in
[1:31:26] serving the lord
[1:31:27] amen god doesn't want us to forget that
[1:31:32] but we can't be haphazard about it amen
[1:31:36] bless the lord oh my soul and forget not
[1:31:39] all his benefits who forgiveth all thy
[1:31:41] knickers who heal with all thy diseases
[1:31:44] let's believe it no matter how we feel
[1:31:48] the bible says the chastisement of our
[1:31:50] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:31:52] we were healed
[1:31:56] it is true that jesus bore those stripes
[1:31:59] upon his back for our healing
[1:32:01] but today we have to use the name of
[1:32:03] jesus
[1:32:05] amen when peter and james was that saw a
[1:32:08] lame man asking
[1:32:09] for alms at the gate called beautiful in

[1:37:33] job at work
[1:37:36] you can candy and harley get a thank you
[1:37:37] from your boss
[1:37:40] they still pick and find something you
[1:37:42] did wrong
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:44] think about it but god said
[1:37:48] he'd not withhold anything from them who
[1:37:51] do a good job with him
[1:37:54] not beautiful we have the benefit of
[1:37:58] god's reward if we diligently seek him
[1:38:02] what greater reward could we have than
[1:38:04] more of the lord
[1:38:07] amen well i've spent some time praying
[1:38:10] i've spent some time
[1:38:11] i listened to this tape but i haven't
[1:38:12] got my answer what what's your question
[1:38:17] when are we going to just go through the
[1:38:18] course of the week and say lord i just
[1:38:19] want more of you
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:23] when is it going to be about
[1:38:24] relationship that's what it should be
[1:38:27] about
[1:38:29] god will continue to show you his
[1:38:31] benefits
[1:38:34] the bible says an entrance to receiving
[1:38:37] more of god
[1:38:38] is ministered to us every time we come
[1:38:40] to church did you know that
[1:38:42] ii peter chapter 1 verse 10 wherefore
[1:38:45] the rather brethren give diligence
[1:38:50] to make your calling and your election
[1:38:53] sure you talk about being certain of god
[1:38:56] here's good direction for us
[1:38:58] for if you do these things ye shall
[1:39:01] never
[1:39:02] fall for so an entrance
[1:39:06] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[1:39:10] into the everlasting kingdom of our lord
[1:39:13] and savior jesus christ think about what
[1:39:14] happens every time you come to church
[1:39:16] an entrance is being ministered to you
[1:39:19] how to get closer to god
[1:39:22] but you gotta walk through that entrance
[1:39:26] you've got to say amen so be it for me
[1:39:29] right amen that's you entering into the
[1:39:33] word
[1:39:34] amen and that day you'll know that i'm
[1:39:37] in you and you and me
[1:39:40] if my word if you if if my word
[1:39:43] if you abide in me and i in you ask what
[1:39:46] you will and it shall be done
[1:39:49] we've got to abide in the word and the
[1:39:50] words got to abide in us
[1:39:54] wherefore i will not be
[1:39:58] negligent to put you look at this word
[1:40:02] always in remembrance of these things
[1:40:06] though you know them and be established
[1:40:09] in the present truth so just because the
[1:40:13] preacher saying something you already
[1:40:14] heard 20 years ago
[1:40:16] doesn't mean he's off beat today
[1:40:21] god wants to put this in remembrance
[1:40:23] because
[1:40:24] he's trying to speak to us about
[1:40:25] something amen
[1:40:29] bless the lord all my soul and all
[1:40:32] that's within me
[1:40:33] bless his holy name and forget not all
[1:40:37] his benefits
[1:40:39] amen let's stand together we need to
[1:40:42] focus
[1:40:42] more on the lord he's not just the
[1:40:45] author
[1:40:46] but he's finishing it he's taken us
[1:40:48] through
[1:40:59] it's okay to come to church and hear a
[1:41:02] simple message
[1:41:03] that god wants us just to bless him
[1:41:06] and let those worship
[1:41:10] not just come from our thoughts
[1:41:14] but let it be so deep from our heart
[1:41:18] a worship of appreciation
[1:41:23] i when we were in
[1:41:26] savannah i don't know what it is but my
[1:41:29] wife and
[1:41:31] my daughter always expected me to cook
[1:41:39] and uh
[1:41:48] and um i don't i can't even remember why
[1:41:51] i was going to say that now
[1:42:00] oh i i remember now but i can't imagine
[1:42:03] i i know when i did the cooking
[1:42:07] i i sit there and i dress it all up we'd
[1:42:09] be taking pictures
[1:42:11] of the dinner and you're sitting there
[1:42:14] anybody there's a cook knows this you're
[1:42:15] sitting there
[1:42:16] you're eating you're waiting for
[1:42:17] somebody to take their first bite
[1:42:20] and you you want to hear them say
[1:42:22] something that's good
[1:42:26] you don't want to hear them say okay
[1:42:30] it's okay it's good they make fun of me
[1:42:34] because
[1:42:35] when something is different i say that's
[1:42:37] unique
[1:42:39] they interpret that as it's bad
[1:42:42] can't say that no more
[1:42:50] the lord is constantly preparing for us
[1:42:56] so many benefits he does for us on a
[1:42:59] daily basis we forget
[1:43:01] to take time to say thank you lord to
[1:43:04] where we just
[1:43:06] expect him to just to keep doing that's
[1:43:07] his job it's not his
[1:43:10] job that's his love it's his love
[1:43:13] towards us
[1:43:15] he just we can't build him a house
[1:43:20] heaven is home the earth is his
[1:43:22] footstool
[1:43:26] he's only wanting us to bless him to
[1:43:28] praise him
[1:43:29] to thank him for his blessings that he
[1:43:32] has blessed us with a very small token
[1:43:34] but
[1:43:35] in that is alone enough to where he said
[1:43:37] i will inhabit you
[1:43:39] i will inhabit you i would inhabit your
[1:43:42] praises
[1:43:44] it's not wanting to have it some thing
[1:43:46] that we build
[1:43:48] some perfect little church with a
[1:43:50] perfect altar
[1:43:52] a perfect bookcase
[1:43:57] you want perfect praise and praise can
[1:44:01] be perfected in a babe
[1:44:03] you got to be serving the lord hardly at
[1:44:06] all all
[1:44:07] you have to do is be so grateful and
[1:44:10] thankful
[1:44:10] for what god has done for you and don't
[1:44:12] lose it please
[1:44:14] that's what this message was about don't
[1:44:16] forget
[1:44:17] to praise the lord don't forget his
[1:44:20] benefits
[1:44:22] we ought to come to church with such an
[1:44:24] excitement i can't wait to get to the
[1:44:26] house of the lord
[1:44:28] i can't wait to praise him i can't wait
[1:44:30] to express my love back to him with my
[1:44:32] brothers and sisters

[1:45:32] because let's say he's not here for a
[1:45:34] moment for a moment let's say he's not
[1:45:36] here
[1:45:38] your praise will draw him
[1:45:41] either way we need to praise him
