[36:45] over us all
[36:47] the brain is here safely today that we
[36:50] could look to you the author and the
[36:53] finisher of our faith
[36:55] that we could express our Thanksgiving
[36:59] to you that one day you reach down your
[37:01] hand
[37:02] and you brought us up out of the world
[37:04] you changed our very
[37:07] desires our very nature to
[37:10] to love you to set our affections on
[37:13] things above
[37:15] to be full of interest to the things
[37:18] that you're interested in Lord
[37:20] father we thank you today for saving us
[37:24] and Lord we thank you for putting us on
[37:26] a right path the path that leads
[37:30] straight home
[37:31] and Lord we believe father that there is
[37:34] a group of people
[37:36] Lord that are going to make the rapture
[37:39] that are not going to to see death and
[37:42] father you've placed that hope within
[37:45] all of us and we thank you this morning
[37:47] that you have given us a message and a
[37:49] word that would help us to make
[37:52] ourselves ready father
[37:55] as we look into the word today we humbly
[37:59] pray this morning that Lord you would
[38:02] Place upon each of us the Revelation
[38:05] that we have need of for our individual
[38:07] lives wherever we are at in our walk
[38:09] with you knowing Lord that
[38:12] we're all in different levels as it were
[38:16] and you're dealing with us in different
[38:17] ways and
[38:19] but God you're able to take the message
[38:21] this morning and break it down
[38:22] individually what you'd have for each of
[38:25] us
[38:25] we pray today Lord there not be one that
[38:28] would be missing would would not a one
[38:31] that would would miss your voice
[38:34] speaking to them the direction for their
[38:36] lives we asked it Lord you'd meet all
[38:38] the needs that would be among us father
[38:41] May there be a faith in our heart just
[38:43] to claim whatever it is Lord that you've
[38:46] been uh you've burdened our heart with
[38:49] perhaps with just more of you more Holy
[38:52] Ghost an answer for a situation a
[38:55] healing in the body a Deliverance
[38:57] whatever it might be Lord
[39:00] you're able to make all grace abound to
[39:02] us father bless your word now and bless
[39:05] this remainder of this time as we commit
[39:08] ourselves into your hands in the
[39:10] precious name of Jesus Christ we ask it
[39:12] amen amen
[39:15] second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 or
[39:19] actually I like to start with verse 14 I
[39:21] want to talk about our ministry and in
[39:24] particular
[39:25] finishing our ministry
[39:28] amen and Paul says it's the the love of
[39:31] Christ that constrains us showing us the
[39:34] mode of
[39:36] for this ministry because we thus judge
[39:38] that if one died for all then we're all
[39:40] dead
[39:41] and that if he died for all that they
[39:44] which live should not henceforth live
[39:46] unto themselves
[39:50] but unto him that died for them and rose
[39:52] again verse 17 wherefore If any man be
[39:57] in Christ he is a new creature
[40:01] and the old things
[40:03] are passed away the old will the old
[40:06] living for themselves has passed away
[40:08] behold all things are become new in
[40:12] other words he's never experienced just
[40:15] doing the will of God Amen
[40:17] and all things are of God who have
[40:20] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[40:24] and have given to us the ministry of
[40:27] restoration of reconciliation to wit
[40:30] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[40:33] world unto himself not imputing the
[40:35] trespasses unto them and have committed
[40:37] unto us the word of reconciliation
[40:40] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[40:43] as though God did beseech you
[40:46] by us we pray you in Christ said be
[40:49] reconciled to God amen amen God bless
[40:52] you you may be said aren't you glad that
[40:54] God
[40:57] did not impute your trespasses upon you
[41:01] amen
[41:03] sometimes when we're dealing with people
[41:04] who have problems we can't seem to get
[41:08] their problems out of our head
[41:11] and we want to bring it before them
[41:14] and really God didn't do that to us
[41:18] and I'm so glad today that his mercies
[41:21] are new each morning
[41:24] that no matter what that that God has a
[41:26] remedy to fix our relationship with him
[41:29] and to draw a relationship closer no
[41:31] matter how close we are with God I do
[41:34] believe there's something in God's heart
[41:35] that's wanting us to be closer to him
[41:37] amen yes sir amen and and we know we
[41:42] can't look at God as he's the fault of
[41:44] our relationship
[41:46] it has to be somewhere on our end
[41:49] and if we can just
[41:53] get quiet long enough and let him speak
[41:56] to us amen God bless brother stands good
[42:00] to see him I love when brothers and
[42:02] sisters press in amen amen I do now the
[42:07] most important part of our Sunday
[42:11] are every Sunday is when God speaks to
[42:14] us amen the most important part and and
[42:18] we ReSound back with a so be it Lord
[42:22] so be it whatever he says to us so be it
[42:26] because we rest in the word brother
[42:29] Branham says Faith's final resting place
[42:31] is in the word and so we long for the
[42:35] word personally to be spoken to us we
[42:38] all want God to speak to us on a
[42:40] personal lover because that's where
[42:41] faith comes from is when he speaks to us
[42:43] but oftentimes
[42:47] too many times we miss the Simplicity of
[42:50] God speaking to us sometimes he speaks
[42:52] to us so loud that it knocks us off our
[42:55] high horse and we know it was him and
[42:57] then sometimes it's so still and so
[42:59] quiet that we just miss it completely
[43:02] we don't recognize it but he's still
[43:05] speaking amen
[43:07] amen so if you want to connect more with
[43:09] God we just need to Simply put into
[43:12] practice what we hear come across the
[43:14] pulpit
[43:15] yes sir get rid of the diasecting get
[43:18] rid of you know if you have to figure
[43:20] out whether this thing is true or not
[43:22] you need to find a church that you agree
[43:24] with the word is the word I mean I
[43:27] certainly I wouldn't be welcome to to
[43:29] preach in the church that believes in
[43:31] the trinity
[43:33] it just doesn't connect
[43:36] right and so if you found your home
[43:37] church and you need to have confidence
[43:39] in the word being ministered to you
[43:43] amen I'd rather have a right mental
[43:45] attitude and obey the word of God that's
[43:47] being preached than to sit around and
[43:49] wait for the Revelation to come before I
[43:51] go decide to do it
[43:54] what's God going to honor
[43:56] the word
[43:58] ought to be
[43:59] the final resting place to every
[44:01] believer
[44:03] brother Brandon said in the message hear
[44:05] his voice he said this morning
[44:07] might be the time that you make up your
[44:10] mind whether you're going to listen to
[44:12] what the television says
[44:14] or what the paper says
[44:16] or what the theologians say
[44:19] or What God Says
[44:21] let me tell you as a people
[44:24] don't you listen to what anything says
[44:27] but What God Says
[44:30] wait on that still small voice
[44:34] and he will change you
[44:41] so what are we listening for the voice
[44:43] for
[44:44] what's the ultimate goal when we hear
[44:46] the not to get more knowledge not to
[44:49] feel better
[44:50] it's to be changed
[44:52] amen we come here to get changed and we
[44:54] can't get changed you know Anne's got
[44:57] that little quote back there's if it
[44:59] don't challenge you it won't change you
[45:01] and that's the truth
[45:03] because uh we live in such a complacency
[45:06] age
[45:07] okay brother Brandon goes on to say you
[45:10] say I like to believe
[45:12] brother Brian I wish I could believe
[45:15] I wish I could do certain things
[45:18] you can't
[45:20] why can't you
[45:22] you don't get quiet long enough you
[45:25] don't get into a place where the doubts
[45:28] are all gone
[45:29] in other words he's saying you won't
[45:31] take the time to prepare yourself
[45:36] right you know sometimes we we had this
[45:38] repetition I'm going to go to church I'm
[45:40] going to spend my 10 minutes on prayer
[45:41] and I'm going to go do this I'm going to
[45:42] do that and really it becomes a ritual
[45:44] right
[45:46] right and sometimes you got to pray for
[45:48] an hour right
[45:50] to get out of your flesh because you've
[45:53] been in there so long
[45:55] and sometimes you get on your knees and
[45:56] his presence just comes immediately
[45:58] right
[45:59] but we need to get out of the routine
[46:01] and get prepared if we really really
[46:04] want to believe
[46:07] amen he says when you enter into that
[46:09] place where the doubts have passed away
[46:11] he says then you're you'll be free
[46:15] and you can hear the voice of God
[46:17] speaking
[46:18] otherwise we're going to sit here a
[46:20] doubt is that was that brother John was
[46:21] that was that what
[46:26] we want to be in that place where his
[46:28] his voice is what we're hearing and then
[46:30] we can have faith to not just say Amen
[46:33] which we should say say Amen but our
[46:37] whole being should say Amen
[46:40] how many of us feel like we have a
[46:42] Ministry
[46:44] one two let me see them
[46:47] praise the Lord so we're we're speaking
[46:50] to those that got a Ministry this
[46:52] morning
[46:53] sometimes we can get distracted
[46:56] and even just consumed with our lives
[46:59] that we forget about our ministry
[47:03] I say don't ever
[47:06] get too saved that's true don't ever get
[47:10] over being saved don't lose your
[47:12] enthusiasm don't lose your excitement
[47:15] don't lose this I I'm so happy to be a
[47:19] Christian
[47:21] because when you you lose your joy the
[47:24] joy of the Lord is your strength when
[47:26] you lose it
[47:28] then you you don't even feel like
[47:30] working for the Lord
[47:32] we can sometimes
[47:34] revert back to just being in the flesh
[47:36] so this morning I just want you to know
[47:37] my motive what I'm trying to accomplish
[47:39] I want us to to reflect and possibly
[47:42] reconnect and recalibrate with our
[47:44] ministry
[47:46] as we reflect on our ministry I want us
[47:49] to think outside of these four walls
[47:51] because a lot of times we think our
[47:52] ministry is in the church
[47:54] right
[47:56] well this is what I do in the church I
[47:58] preach behind the pulpit I'm I'm
[48:00] preaching to me on that one
[48:02] because I preached men in public
[48:04] [Music]
[48:06] it's not what we do here right
[48:08] right that's that what that scripture is
[48:10] so I want us to think outside
[48:13] those of you that raise your hand want
[48:15] you to think outside
[48:17] of this building
[48:26] God isn't isolated to just this building
[48:29] he's really building his church outside
[48:32] amen his message was go ye out
[48:36] that was the message of the church so as
[48:38] we reflect I want to ask this question
[48:41] what is your ministry outside the church
[48:45] Define it what is it what do you do
[48:49] outside the church
[48:52] how's your ministry been going
[48:55] let's be honest
[48:57] has it been important enough to you you
[48:59] feel that it's you can stand here today
[49:01] and say yeah I've been putting in the
[49:03] time that is needed because I believe
[49:05] it's really really important or you can
[49:08] say on I I
[49:10] I really haven't maybe allocated enough
[49:12] time in a prayer or enough resources now
[49:16] look
[49:16] you may have ideas to do something but
[49:19] you don't got maybe the money to do it
[49:20] but I'm going to tell you this
[49:22] whatever God's given you give it to his
[49:24] kingdom
[49:27] that's all that he requires you to give
[49:30] but the thing is if you're you're not
[49:33] if you're not putting attention to your
[49:35] to to the ministry that God's given you
[49:39] we can maybe get so caught up in life so
[49:42] many problems and because also we got
[49:44] excuses of why we're not ministering
[49:47] right
[49:48] I've got this going on and that going on
[49:51] I got pressures from over here and this
[49:53] is happening before you know it that
[49:55] becomes priority
[49:57] true
[49:58] so maybe it's time to reconnect and and
[50:01] recalibrate
[50:03] with God's Ministry
[50:07] how many has received the new birth
[50:10] come on get these hand keep them up
[50:12] there I love it I love the waving I'll
[50:14] tell you why because I'm not ashamed of
[50:16] the Gospel of God it's the power of God
[50:18] under salvation
[50:20] when we become Born Again God gave each
[50:24] of us a Ministry
[50:28] when we became new creatures in Christ
[50:30] with
[50:32] the nature of God a different nature
[50:34] than we were born with
[50:35] all things in our life became of God and
[50:39] he gave each one of us the ministry of
[50:42] reconciliation
[50:45] now God doesn't give us all different
[50:48] Ministries
[50:52] we all have different gifts
[50:55] we might even have
[50:57] different callings
[51:00] but we all have we're all part of the
[51:02] ministry of reconciliation
[51:04] every one of us
[51:10] and we have been also given the
[51:12] responsibility
[51:14] of reconciling people to Christ
[51:18] remember Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews
[51:21] the Bible says
[51:22] he had to self-made Ministry
[51:27] he wasn't born again
[51:30] and when Jesus asked him
[51:34] uh or over nicotines as Jesus you know
[51:36] you know how can we be born again how
[51:38] can these things be
[51:40] Jesus said our thou a master of Israel
[51:43] and you don't even know these things
[51:48] so this this this ministry has to do
[51:51] with being born again
[51:53] saying to you except a man be born again
[51:56] he cannot see the kingdom of God except
[51:59] there be a nature change
[52:03] we can't understand what what God is all
[52:06] about
[52:07] what heaven is all about brother Branham
[52:10] said in the message the reaction to the
[52:12] action he says no one will be in the
[52:14] Rapture without the Holy Ghost
[52:18] you can't even go in a Rapture without
[52:21] the Holy Ghost and brother Branham even
[52:23] said the Holy Ghost is the token that
[52:26] you've been pardoned
[52:29] that is so powerful to me Brother Bruce
[52:32] you know because we think part and all I
[52:34] got to do is believe get under the
[52:36] Bloods ask for forgiveness and it's done
[52:40] brother Brandon said when God gives you
[52:43] the Holy Ghost that's him accepting your
[52:46] faith
[52:49] amen right so in this age we got to have
[52:52] the Holy Ghost
[52:54] and I'm all for taking more time in
[52:57] seeking the Holy Ghost
[52:59] because I know it as clear as anything
[53:01] the devil tells every one of us we got
[53:03] enough Holy Ghost
[53:06] because he's bothered when you get done
[53:08] on your knees and you say God I need
[53:11] more of you
[53:13] that scares him
[53:14] right you could even be the weakest
[53:16] Christian and he'll tremble amen
[53:21] sometimes we're just so proud and think
[53:23] we're there
[53:26] Marvel not thy saying to you you must be
[53:29] born again
[53:31] everyone planning on going to heaven
[53:33] must be born again must have a nature
[53:36] Changers there's no get out of jail no
[53:39] free pass
[53:41] every man woman boy and girl must have a
[53:45] nature change
[53:47] and that nature change isn't from
[53:50] one weirdo to another weirdo
[53:55] right it ain't from acting
[53:58] you know what I'm saying our nature must
[54:01] become the nature of Christ
[54:04] each born-again believer receives a
[54:09] Ministry of reconciliation with this
[54:11] nature change there's no one that exempt
[54:15] every I don't care how old we are how
[54:18] young we are boy or girl we must work
[54:21] to reconcile others back to Christ
[54:25] if that's not happening we need to
[54:27] reconnect
[54:29] because we need to finish our ministry
[54:32] that God has given us
[54:35] a complete nature change unites us with
[54:39] God and his purpose his will and his
[54:42] purpose
[54:43] see the nature change just doesn't okay
[54:45] okay your Nature's change you're going
[54:47] to heaven now go do what you want to do
[54:50] no when you get the Holy Ghost you get
[54:53] the nature change it unites you with
[54:56] God's purpose
[55:00] if if I was going to call any one of you
[55:03] at your house and say look I want to
[55:06] come over tomorrow what are you doing
[55:09] I wouldn't know that answer until you
[55:12] told me this is what I'm doing tomorrow
[55:13] if you want to come along this is then I
[55:16] wouldn't know what your purpose is
[55:18] and when God gives you the Holy Ghost
[55:20] it's not to do your will it's not to do
[55:22] your thoughts it has nothing to do with
[55:24] this world it has to do with his eternal
[55:27] purpose
[55:29] and so God is not going to give you the
[55:31] Holy Ghost and then it's not going to
[55:32] unite you with his will
[55:35] just not going to happen
[55:37] right God predestinated us to work with
[55:41] him
[55:42] from the very beginning
[55:45] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 9.
[55:50] explains having made known unto us the
[55:53] mystery
[55:54] of his will it's a mystery
[55:57] according to the good pleasure which he
[55:59] have purposed in himself in other words
[56:02] he didn't get together with the angels
[56:03] and say what do you think about about
[56:05] doing this this was all God
[56:09] this is what he wanted
[56:12] it's about his ministry it's about his
[56:14] will it's about his purpose that in the
[56:16] dispensation of the fullness of times
[56:20] when it's all
[56:22] over
[56:23] he might gather together in one all
[56:28] things
[56:29] that are in Christ
[56:33] that are that are in that new nature
[56:36] that we just read about
[56:39] both which are in heaven which are on
[56:41] earth even in him
[56:44] God is working to get his family born
[56:47] again that's how we get there
[56:50] that's how we get into the Kingdom so we
[56:52] get Born Again by one Spirit we are
[56:55] baptized into the body
[56:58] and so we need to be you know we we see
[57:00] others who are struggle and got problems
[57:02] and this is going on and that's going on
[57:04] you know we need to encourage people to
[57:06] get more Holy Ghost
[57:09] because that is the only thing that's
[57:11] going to set them where they need to be
[57:13] it's God in them
[57:15] not them on the outside looking for
[57:18] advices on what to do
[57:21] to help them with their their walk with
[57:23] God no we don't need that we need God on
[57:26] the inside
[57:28] he's able
[57:30] to direct your path
[57:32] verse 11.
[57:36] in whom also we have obtained an
[57:38] inheritance praise God
[57:40] being predestinated
[57:43] praise God we're predestinated
[57:46] not just to go to heaven
[57:48] but according to the purpose of him
[57:53] who worketh all things
[57:55] after the Council of his own will now
[57:58] you tell me in those scriptures where
[58:00] are you in those scriptures where where
[58:02] is your will in those scriptures
[58:05] where's your plans in those scriptures
[58:08] where is your your goals and what's your
[58:12] it's all about him
[58:14] the only part that you
[58:17] is falling in line with his purpose
[58:20] it is only Satan that's trying to get
[58:23] you in all these other things
[58:25] all these other distractions
[58:28] see God's nature unites with unites us
[58:31] with his will and his eternal purpose
[58:34] that's what the Holy Ghost will do for
[58:36] you
[58:37] it'll it'll unite you with him so
[58:40] imagine today
[58:42] that um
[58:45] uh you know brother Ron say you know
[58:48] let's just say brother Ron last service
[58:50] he gets up here and he's he's speaking
[58:52] about
[58:53] uh something that is a little off the
[58:56] wall shall we say
[58:59] a little different
[59:00] brother brother Mark gets up here and he
[59:03] ministers that's a little bit off the
[59:05] wall the other way I get up here
[59:08] nice be something a little bit off the
[59:10] wall the other way
[59:12] well that's nothing going to be but a
[59:13] bunch of confusion for our church and
[59:15] you're going to try to figure out what's
[59:16] what
[59:18] the Holy Ghost in you will do the same
[59:21] thing it did in Jesus
[59:23] it'll be the same purpose
[59:26] see the thing is we we let the devil
[59:29] interpret to us what God's Ministry is
[59:32] for our life
[59:37] completely wrong
[59:38] we got black and white what our ministry
[59:40] is
[59:42] there's no if ands buts about it what we
[59:44] should be doing
[59:48] how could we have the spirit of God and
[59:51] his nature and not carry out his purpose
[59:53] right
[59:55] I'll say it like this impossible
[1:00:01] over a long period of time it's
[1:00:03] impossible short period yes we all drift
[1:00:05] and do things like that but I'll tell
[1:00:07] you we need to reconnect recalibrate and
[1:00:09] and focus and finish the ministry that
[1:00:12] God has given us
[1:00:14] it's the proof in the pudding right when
[1:00:16] we're doing his will
[1:00:19] now if we fall more in love with him
[1:00:22] and his will
[1:00:24] then there is a promise in the scripture
[1:00:28] that things are going to work out for
[1:00:31] our favor
[1:00:33] but we've we've got to love
[1:00:36] him
[1:00:38] and be called according to his purpose
[1:00:41] if you leave one of those out of there
[1:00:42] you're in trouble
[1:00:50] Romans 8 28 says and we know
[1:00:53] that all things work together for the
[1:00:55] good to them that love God to them who
[1:00:57] are are the called
[1:01:00] according to his purpose now
[1:01:03] I'm just gonna again take a couple
[1:01:05] examples and and I I I want to say
[1:01:09] I'm just going to think Mark and me but
[1:01:12] we can take Bob and Jim
[1:01:16] and
[1:01:17] and Bob is one sold out believer
[1:01:24] he has given himself over to the Holy
[1:01:28] Ghost
[1:01:31] Jim on the other hand
[1:01:33] he comes to church Faithfully
[1:01:36] but he still works his own will in his
[1:01:39] life
[1:01:42] now which one has been called according
[1:01:45] to God's purpose
[1:01:48] that's a question you're supposed to
[1:01:49] answer that one
[1:01:51] who
[1:01:52] Bob all right you're paying attention in
[1:01:55] class okay
[1:01:57] see we we got to make sure we gotta make
[1:02:00] our calling and election sure we got to
[1:02:02] make sure that we're called according to
[1:02:04] his purpose and not just doing a little
[1:02:06] bit here and a little bit there and feel
[1:02:08] that we're part of that no
[1:02:12] no if you really want all things to work
[1:02:13] together for the good
[1:02:15] you got to give them all
[1:02:17] that's what that love affair is
[1:02:20] his purpose remember his purpose is to
[1:02:23] gather together in one all things in
[1:02:26] Christ
[1:02:28] gather together in all in one all things
[1:02:31] in our Christ so you just take a look at
[1:02:33] your last week
[1:02:34] and and how much of your time has been
[1:02:38] looking for those
[1:02:40] to gather them into one
[1:02:44] because I'm just I'm just cutting
[1:02:46] through the taste this is his purpose
[1:02:49] now we could we can make his ministry
[1:02:53] something different
[1:02:55] well I'm just going to do this and I
[1:02:56] feel to do that
[1:02:58] if it don't come under the umbrella
[1:03:01] of gathering together all things in one
[1:03:04] in Christ then we're out of we're out of
[1:03:07] his purpose we've manufactured a
[1:03:10] different purpose
[1:03:12] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:03:14] on earth even in him
[1:03:18] so when did our ministry start
[1:03:21] we've been predestinated to this
[1:03:24] ministry
[1:03:25] must have been in the mind of God
[1:03:29] I don't think God saved some of us to
[1:03:31] just take it easy right work on our own
[1:03:33] careers
[1:03:35] kind of soothe In Sail in
[1:03:38] and as that song goes
[1:03:41] a bed of ease and others sail through
[1:03:43] bloody Seas
[1:03:45] when Jesus called us
[1:03:47] this ministry was on his mind
[1:03:52] when Jesus called Peter
[1:03:55] he said follow me and I'll make you
[1:03:57] Fishers of Men
[1:03:59] got you know right to the chase right
[1:04:02] there at the beginning of the call the
[1:04:04] ministry was right there
[1:04:07] and I love the attitude of Peter there
[1:04:10] was no debating
[1:04:12] there was no discussing
[1:04:14] how hard it was going to be there was no
[1:04:15] discussing of the benefits
[1:04:18] there was no way you please tell me
[1:04:19] first what's going to go on and then
[1:04:21] I'll you know make a decision no right
[1:04:24] amen because something connected on the
[1:04:27] inside
[1:04:29] there was didn't have to persuade on the
[1:04:31] outside something on the inside they
[1:04:33] straight away left their Nets and
[1:04:36] followed
[1:04:37] that was it
[1:04:39] it was the same with James and John
[1:04:44] no Jesus didn't want to say them and and
[1:04:46] just set up some prosperous career for
[1:04:49] them
[1:04:50] the mind of Christ was to use them in
[1:04:53] the ministry
[1:04:55] to help other Souls come to him
[1:04:59] yes sir that's where God you know God is
[1:05:01] the same yesterday to him forever people
[1:05:03] change times change fads change churches
[1:05:07] change pastors change but God don't
[1:05:09] change
[1:05:11] God is the same yesterday today and
[1:05:13] forever we have an absolute here and
[1:05:16] I'll tell you this word is exciting to
[1:05:18] me because when the Devil comes with all
[1:05:20] this other stuff going on it's real easy
[1:05:22] to know what the truth is
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:25] but if the devil can separate you from
[1:05:27] the word from the love of the word then
[1:05:30] you're easy to get tripped up
[1:05:34] now Jesus
[1:05:36] taught them and he discipled them
[1:05:38] all 12 of his disciples and I'll say
[1:05:41] what a teacher they had
[1:05:43] what a teacher we have in Jesus today
[1:05:46] amen he's he's he's here teaching
[1:05:50] and then he equipped them he equipped
[1:05:53] them he's he he sent them out two by two
[1:05:55] and the Bible says that they were able
[1:05:57] to heal all manner of diseases and he
[1:05:59] gave them a power but you know they were
[1:06:02] just getting started
[1:06:06] their Ministry was actually mixed with
[1:06:10] their flesh
[1:06:15] you can say Amen to it
[1:06:17] they were rejoicing because the Devils
[1:06:19] were subject to it can you imagine
[1:06:24] they just thought it was really cool
[1:06:28] they fought and they bragged about who
[1:06:31] was the best among them
[1:06:34] there were times they didn't even
[1:06:36] realize they didn't have the right
[1:06:37] spirit
[1:06:40] and when Peter promised to finish his
[1:06:42] ministry that he would even die
[1:06:46] with this ministry
[1:06:48] he turned away he cursed
[1:06:53] denied
[1:06:58] and followed Jesus
[1:07:01] from afar
[1:07:03] didn't want to get too close to the word
[1:07:06] like some of us
[1:07:08] hey we need to stop playing church and
[1:07:11] we need to start uniting
[1:07:13] amen we need to start uniting
[1:07:17] and the only way to do that
[1:07:20] is crucify the flesh
[1:07:26] see
[1:07:28] Peter's nature wasn't completely changed
[1:07:30] all things were not of God
[1:07:33] his ministry was mixed the disciples
[1:07:36] Ministry was mixed that's why they all
[1:07:38] forsook them
[1:07:40] it wasn't until after they got the Holy
[1:07:41] Ghost
[1:07:42] that they stayed with him
[1:07:45] said it in the message all the days of
[1:07:48] our life he said I trust that the church
[1:07:50] will understand this
[1:07:53] that we have no right to use our own
[1:07:56] thinking about things
[1:08:00] when we become Christians we totally
[1:08:02] surrender every bit of our mental powers
[1:08:06] to God and to follow after his leading
[1:08:11] amen and as long as we try to go after
[1:08:14] our own feeling
[1:08:16] then we are using the Fallen state of
[1:08:19] the being
[1:08:20] right do you see how you can mix
[1:08:23] yourself with the ministry
[1:08:29] and the message perfect strength by
[1:08:31] Perfect weakness brother Brown said it's
[1:08:34] the Simplicity of the Gospel that
[1:08:36] staggers the people
[1:08:39] it's because they're always looking for
[1:08:40] something great
[1:08:42] like I want you to take for a moment
[1:08:46] maybe two or three ministers that you
[1:08:50] thought were just the greatest ministers
[1:08:53] you
[1:08:54] uh that you've ever seen
[1:08:56] and how they made you feel
[1:09:00] and
[1:09:02] and to think that yes that's God I
[1:09:06] say is God and you would tell anybody
[1:09:08] that was God
[1:09:13] and anything underneath that is
[1:09:15] questionable
[1:09:19] as if God only has that
[1:09:23] and I think that's where
[1:09:27] it staggers a lot of people
[1:09:31] he says they try to make it a great
[1:09:34] intellectual something another
[1:09:37] when it's the simpleness
[1:09:41] but God takes the very tool of humility
[1:09:47] weakness
[1:09:49] and simplicity
[1:09:51] to work
[1:09:52] his works with
[1:09:55] that's what he uses he said that's only
[1:09:58] a tool in God's hand
[1:10:01] God is looking for humility
[1:10:05] and weakness and simplicity
[1:10:09] I guess there's just no room for me
[1:10:13] and that that's a good Revelation to
[1:10:15] have there's no room for us there's no
[1:10:17] room for us we got to get out of it
[1:10:22] now after Jesus had resurrected and
[1:10:25] Peter was wanting to know the future of
[1:10:29] John
[1:10:31] and Jesus responded with a question he
[1:10:33] says what is it to you what's going to
[1:10:36] happen to John it is none of your
[1:10:39] beeswax
[1:10:42] none of your business
[1:10:44] Peter
[1:10:45] Focus
[1:10:47] focus on your ministry follow me
[1:10:51] right God is not even interested
[1:10:54] in what we think about one another
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:11:00] if we could spend our effort in getting
[1:11:03] serious with God and following the the
[1:11:06] very same word two words that he uses at
[1:11:09] the end right before he leaves
[1:11:12] is to say words that you still when he
[1:11:14] called them
[1:11:18] and you know Peter's life kind of went
[1:11:20] like this
[1:11:24] and it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:11:27] to keep us on track
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:29] a man at his very best is all vanity
[1:11:33] you know we could say oh yeah I'm
[1:11:34] serving God I'm doing this and you know
[1:11:36] next day we're off doing our own thing
[1:11:40] we can't make it without the Holy Ghost
[1:11:42] now let me just say this
[1:11:46] we know
[1:11:48] repentance is a part of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:50] right Godly sorrow worketh Patton's it's
[1:11:53] God dealing with somebody's heart we
[1:11:55] know that if a man repents and God
[1:11:57] forgives him he justifies him that is a
[1:12:00] work of the Holy Ghost it's the same
[1:12:01] thing as sanctification
[1:12:03] amen we can't look at those things and
[1:12:06] say we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:12:10] you got to look at your life with this
[1:12:12] word and say is my life living this word
[1:12:17] it just got to be that way because if
[1:12:20] you don't do that you're going to let
[1:12:21] the devil lie to you
[1:12:25] because when you come here you do not
[1:12:27] hear a Ministry that says take it easy
[1:12:30] you got it you already got it take it
[1:12:33] easy you won't hear that
[1:12:36] I don't hear that I can listen to the
[1:12:39] tapes all day and I don't hear I got it
[1:12:42] take it easy you're in the message
[1:12:46] I hear I got a dig
[1:12:48] I hear something every time I when I
[1:12:50] pick up that word and I read I think oh
[1:12:52] my Lord help me
[1:12:54] I need more of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:57] I hope you feel the same way
[1:13:02] the original Ministry that God called
[1:13:04] the disciples to was to be Fishers of
[1:13:06] Men
[1:13:08] but
[1:13:10] they weren't new creatures yet
[1:13:14] so when he called them to be Fishers of
[1:13:16] Men
[1:13:18] he had in his mind that they had to
[1:13:20] become new creatures
[1:13:23] that they had to get filled with his
[1:13:25] spirit
[1:13:27] that the way they looked at things how
[1:13:29] they responded to problems right I'm
[1:13:33] going to tell you that was really that
[1:13:34] was it how they responded surprised you
[1:13:36] know brother Brian says it's not the
[1:13:37] action but the reaction
[1:13:39] anybody can sit here and say what's
[1:13:41] right what's wrong
[1:13:44] but who can handle a problem the right
[1:13:47] way
[1:13:48] amen that's the Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:54] and that's what they didn't have
[1:13:56] it takes a nature change
[1:14:00] and Jesus reminds them of the original
[1:14:02] calling just before he leaves with the
[1:14:05] Great Commission
[1:14:07] in Matthew 28 19 go ye therefore and
[1:14:10] teach All Nations
[1:14:13] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:14:16] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:19] well brother John I can't I can't go to
[1:14:23] another Nation
[1:14:25] but you can go on vacation
[1:14:27] [Laughter]
[1:14:29] it's all about purpose
[1:14:32] it's all about heart
[1:14:35] teaching all nations baptizing them in
[1:14:37] the name of the father and the son the
[1:14:39] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[1:14:43] things
[1:14:45] whatsoever I commanded you well isn't
[1:14:48] that personal what God tells me it's for
[1:14:50] me it's not for everybody else
[1:14:53] Jesus said what I have spoken to you
[1:14:56] what to observe what to live by
[1:15:00] you got to tell others
[1:15:03] yeah God can come and he can speak to
[1:15:05] anybody but he has you're in him so when
[1:15:08] you speak it it's really him
[1:15:10] right it's really him but people don't
[1:15:12] see it
[1:15:14] because of that Veil flesh
[1:15:18] teaching them to observe all things
[1:15:19] whatsoever command did you and lo I am
[1:15:22] with you always
[1:15:24] amen even to the end of the world now
[1:15:29] think about this
[1:15:32] the disciples did not live to the end of
[1:15:35] the world
[1:15:38] so was Jesus speaking
[1:15:40] to them or was he speaking to us
[1:15:45] because we're closer to the end
[1:15:47] than they were right
[1:15:50] I if I read this scripture correctly I
[1:15:53] feel I have this responsibility
[1:15:56] I had this responsibility to share
[1:15:58] Christ with others now look my flesh
[1:16:00] don't want to do your flesh don't want
[1:16:02] to do you know what our flesh want to do
[1:16:03] one to lay in bed today
[1:16:05] that's what our flesh wanted to do
[1:16:08] but we're not here to talk about our
[1:16:10] flesh
[1:16:11] we're really here to hear from God and
[1:16:13] it's not so much just we're coming to
[1:16:15] hear the truth
[1:16:17] but the truth has got to it's got to do
[1:16:19] something in our hearts
[1:16:21] there's got to be a connection there
[1:16:25] God gives every man and woman a part of
[1:16:29] the ministry of reconciliation
[1:16:32] to restore The Souls of other men and
[1:16:35] other women and other children back to
[1:16:37] God teaching them to observe all things
[1:16:39] whatsoever I've commanded you
[1:16:43] amen but wait
[1:16:47] to the Holy Ghost comes wait till you're
[1:16:50] in do with power from on high spend more
[1:16:53] time in prayer and get more of the Holy
[1:16:55] Ghost don't try to do it in the flesh
[1:16:57] amen
[1:16:59] acts 1 8 says but you shall receive
[1:17:02] power
[1:17:03] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:17:08] right so what what do I do after I get
[1:17:10] that power
[1:17:12] do I rejoice
[1:17:14] that the demons are subject
[1:17:18] do I say that I'm better than so and so
[1:17:22] no
[1:17:25] ye shall be Witnesses
[1:17:29] unto me
[1:17:32] wherever you're at
[1:17:35] wherever you're at amen you're a witness
[1:17:38] you're no longer you
[1:17:42] you're Christ
[1:17:44] in a different body
[1:17:50] what an honor what a privilege
[1:17:53] God used me wherever I am I'll praise
[1:17:57] Him wherever I am I'll be a witness
[1:18:00] a witness
[1:18:03] the Holy Ghost is the only thing that
[1:18:05] can equip us what sharing Christ during
[1:18:09] adversity
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] because if we're only going to share
[1:18:14] Christ when there's no adversity we
[1:18:16] don't need the Holy Ghost
[1:18:21] we don't
[1:18:23] hey when things are going your way you
[1:18:26] can do about anything
[1:18:28] when the money's coming in the
[1:18:29] popularity is there the friends are
[1:18:31] there you know everybody's patent you on
[1:18:33] the back hey share Christ but go through
[1:18:36] some adversity
[1:18:38] we'll find out what's really in the tea
[1:18:39] bag and the Holy Ghost is the only thing
[1:18:42] that can equip us with being able to
[1:18:44] witness Christ properly while going
[1:18:46] through adversity
[1:18:48] I believe that with all my heart
[1:18:52] when God gives us the Holy Ghost this
[1:18:56] ministry of reconciliation is attached
[1:18:59] to the Holy Ghost it's just like the
[1:19:02] word and the spirit of the word
[1:19:07] or the word and the Holy Ghost is the
[1:19:10] same
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:13] not the dead letter part but the spirit
[1:19:15] of the word which is the same thing
[1:19:20] there's no confusion
[1:19:22] one is alive and one is dead
[1:19:27] all right the Holy Ghost equips us to do
[1:19:30] the ministering in other words he makes
[1:19:32] you and I able ministers
[1:19:35] not ourselves we can't do it but he does
[1:19:38] it and you just write these two
[1:19:39] scriptures down I don't know if I'll
[1:19:40] have time I will not have time to go
[1:19:42] through them so you write these down
[1:19:43] second Corinthians chapter 6 verses 1
[1:19:45] through 10
[1:19:47] second Corinthians chapter 6 verses 1
[1:19:49] through 10 second Corinthians chapter
[1:19:51] four
[1:19:53] 7-15 second Corinthians chapter 4 7-15
[1:19:56] now this
[1:19:59] is a this is really describing about us
[1:20:03] being able ministers it's really not
[1:20:06] talking about finishing the ministry
[1:20:09] because that's what this message is but
[1:20:13] that really
[1:20:14] helps you to understand how you should
[1:20:17] be ministering
[1:20:18] second Corinthians 3 5 tells us not that
[1:20:22] we are sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:20:25] anything of ourselves
[1:20:27] but our sufficiency is of God who have
[1:20:31] made us able Ministers of the New
[1:20:33] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:20:36] spirit for the letter killeth but the
[1:20:38] spirit give her life you ever go up to
[1:20:40] somebody and just tell them like it is
[1:20:45] what did you do when you did that
[1:20:51] killed it
[1:20:53] you killed the opportunity to help right
[1:20:59] amen
[1:21:02] that would be okay if it was really God
[1:21:05] and he was condemning the person
[1:21:08] but it's usually not
[1:21:11] God is full of Mercy he has so much
[1:21:13] Mercy
[1:21:15] you
[1:21:16] I had one guy come into our shop one
[1:21:18] time and he was trying to sell himself
[1:21:22] wanted a job with us
[1:21:24] he says I can run that computer so fast
[1:21:27] it'll make your head spin
[1:21:34] God has so much Mercy to make your head
[1:21:37] spin
[1:21:38] that's what I got to say
[1:21:42] you know but for some reason we only
[1:21:44] exercise
[1:21:46] and when we do exercise it it's only to
[1:21:49] those we feel are granted Worthy
[1:21:54] and that's a representation of Christ
[1:21:57] me
[1:21:59] brother Brian said in the message
[1:22:01] Witnesses
[1:22:03] 53 he says you know I say this now with
[1:22:07] all respect
[1:22:09] it isn't our city
[1:22:11] full of boot
[1:22:12] leg joints that's hurting us
[1:22:16] we could fill in the blank with a lot of
[1:22:18] evil stuff going on
[1:22:20] here's what's hurting us
[1:22:22] more than ever
[1:22:25] is people who are professing to be
[1:22:27] Christians
[1:22:28] and not living it
[1:22:32] that's the thing see they're not a
[1:22:35] correct Witness
[1:22:37] well the Holy Ghost is what makes us
[1:22:39] correct Witnesses
[1:22:43] they can't witness until they've had the
[1:22:45] experience
[1:22:47] and when they have an experience
[1:22:50] then they can become a witness
[1:22:51] automatically because they are born
[1:22:54] again and all the things of the world
[1:22:56] the old things have passed away and all
[1:22:58] the and all things have become new
[1:23:01] then you become a witness unto Jesus
[1:23:07] Jesus knew before these Apostles could
[1:23:10] ever go out and be a correct witness
[1:23:13] that they had to experience what they
[1:23:16] were witnessing about
[1:23:18] you can't say it any planer than that
[1:23:21] that's right that is it in a nutshell we
[1:23:24] need more of the Holy Ghost so much that
[1:23:28] it don't matter what's happening to us
[1:23:29] what we come in contact we're still
[1:23:32] living the life we we've gotten to the
[1:23:34] place where we can love everyone we've
[1:23:36] gotten to the place where we can lay it
[1:23:38] on our life and live for others
[1:23:43] the Holy Ghost unites us with the mind
[1:23:45] of God the mind of God and it puts us in
[1:23:48] harmony with his purpose which is to
[1:23:50] reach out to others we're being consumed
[1:23:53] in our own lives
[1:23:56] we're forgetting about the ministry that
[1:23:58] Christ gave us
[1:24:01] we need to work in harmony with the Holy
[1:24:03] Ghost and only the holy the holy spirit
[1:24:06] inside of us is going to know the
[1:24:08] correct Harmony the Bible says we're
[1:24:10] workers together with him
[1:24:13] with him
[1:24:16] in the message oncoming storm brother
[1:24:18] Brandon says therefore when you are born
[1:24:20] from above
[1:24:22] you have the Holy Spirit coming down
[1:24:25] from God that changes your nature
[1:24:30] you know this whole message
[1:24:32] is interwoven with a changed nature
[1:24:36] and I don't understand how the how so
[1:24:39] many people in the message can read the
[1:24:41] message and there's no concern about the
[1:24:43] change
[1:24:46] come on
[1:24:49] he says no matter your sister your
[1:24:52] mother your best friend could be dressed
[1:24:54] that way
[1:24:56] but the Christian that's born of the
[1:24:58] spirit of God he's born from above and
[1:25:01] their spirit is of another kingdom so
[1:25:04] here we are he we that are born again we
[1:25:07] intertwine and we in we we're involved
[1:25:10] with other people who have not been born
[1:25:12] again and they're family members are you
[1:25:15] with me
[1:25:17] so no matter what our spirit has to
[1:25:21] represent Christ
[1:25:22] how else are they gonna how else are we
[1:25:24] going to help them
[1:25:26] no chance of helping them if you're
[1:25:28] going to be double-sided
[1:25:31] you got to be a beacon
[1:25:33] gotta be a lighthouse
[1:25:35] gotta Shine the Light
[1:25:37] let's go back to our opening scripture
[1:25:39] here
[1:25:40] mine
[1:25:42] time flies when you're having fun
[1:25:47] all right second Corinthians chapter 5
[1:25:49] verse 17 If any man be in Christ he
[1:25:53] is a new Witness
[1:25:57] old witnessing has passed away
[1:26:00] behold all witnessing becomes new
[1:26:02] and all witnessing is of God
[1:26:06] who have reconciled
[1:26:09] us unto Jesus unto us by Jesus Christ
[1:26:12] now
[1:26:13] unto himself by Jesus Christ I want to I
[1:26:17] looked up that word reconciled right
[1:26:19] there
[1:26:20] in the Greek what that meant you know
[1:26:23] what it means it means to change
[1:26:25] mutually
[1:26:29] to change mutually now you know Amanda's
[1:26:32] very best is Vanity he can't do nothing
[1:26:35] but we have
[1:26:38] to unite with God we have to say God I
[1:26:42] am so sick of myself
[1:26:46] I want you to come in and change my
[1:26:49] nature and you know it takes sometimes
[1:26:51] no it takes most times more than just
[1:26:55] asking it once or twice
[1:27:00] if you want something bad enough you'll
[1:27:02] go to extremes right
[1:27:04] right like you know if you ever had to
[1:27:06] do a greenhouse
[1:27:08] it could take years to do
[1:27:10] if you're doing it by yourself
[1:27:13] it can take a long time
[1:27:16] and sometimes we want a nature change
[1:27:17] but you know we give God an hour
[1:27:20] Sunday
[1:27:22] maybe an hour and a half on Wednesday
[1:27:23] sometimes we're gonna come on Wednesdays
[1:27:27] and we want God to do something in our
[1:27:29] life
[1:27:30] what do you want to do
[1:27:33] because he's serious about a
[1:27:35] relationship he's serious about the
[1:27:37] nature change and he can't do it all by
[1:27:40] his will because his will that the whole
[1:27:42] world will be saved
[1:27:44] his will that everybody's nature would
[1:27:46] be changed
[1:27:47] but he can't do it
[1:27:50] you have
[1:27:52] to combine with God's will you have to
[1:27:55] say Lord I willingly not my will but thy
[1:27:59] will be done I give up my own will for
[1:28:03] your will
[1:28:06] and then God begins to reconcile you to
[1:28:09] him and that is the same process he uses
[1:28:12] in your ministry with others how many
[1:28:15] times are you trying to help people
[1:28:17] they don't want to listen
[1:28:19] I'm not saying
[1:28:23] that Christ in you is going to make
[1:28:26] everybody turn out right
[1:28:29] but I will tell you Christ in you will
[1:28:31] become a correct Witness
[1:28:34] and those that are ordained will come
[1:28:37] right that's just scriptural
[1:28:41] all right
[1:28:43] and notice the big word and in verse 18
[1:28:46] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:28:51] reconciliation the ministry you know
[1:28:54] what that is that you looked that word
[1:28:56] up it is attendance as a servant
[1:29:03] amen you now are a servant you're no
[1:29:05] longer who you think you are
[1:29:10] you're just you're just a little old
[1:29:13] servant that's all you are
[1:29:20] we don't want to think of ourselves as
[1:29:22] anything right
[1:29:25] and God can't use a tough shirt
[1:29:28] so the little or more littler you can
[1:29:30] get the more God wants to use you
[1:29:34] reconciliation that word
[1:29:36] reconciliation restoration is the action
[1:29:40] of returning something to a former owner
[1:29:43] place or condition so here you are
[1:29:47] you're going out to some devil possessed
[1:29:49] person
[1:29:51] nowadays
[1:29:52] you just look about everybody
[1:29:54] and you say you you you just are they
[1:29:57] are they possessed
[1:29:58] it's how bad it's getting
[1:30:00] the world's going insane brother Brandon
[1:30:02] said
[1:30:04] but our job is to re to restore them to
[1:30:07] the former owner
[1:30:09] which we don't know if that's Christ
[1:30:12] we don't
[1:30:14] because but we're instructed to become
[1:30:17] all things to all men that we might win
[1:30:20] some of them to the original owner
[1:30:23] which is Christ
[1:30:25] praise the Lord to wit to wit to wit in
[1:30:30] the manner
[1:30:31] that God was in Christ
[1:30:34] he reconciled the world in himself not
[1:30:36] reputing their trespasses imputing their
[1:30:40] trespasses on them and is committed and
[1:30:42] unjust the word of reconciliation so now
[1:30:44] what what what Christ did for the world
[1:30:46] Christ does in US individually
[1:30:50] to others no different
[1:30:54] he's given us the word
[1:30:56] the same word that he preached the same
[1:30:59] word right here
[1:31:01] this word is the only thing that can
[1:31:04] save somebody
[1:31:06] my word ain't going to save anybody
[1:31:14] God's word is the only thing that can
[1:31:16] reconcile man back to God
[1:31:19] now then we are ambassadors in other
[1:31:21] words we act as a representative a true
[1:31:23] witness for Christ as though God did
[1:31:26] beseech you
[1:31:28] uh by us
[1:31:31] notice that
[1:31:33] when you're speaking to other people
[1:31:34] about their souls that's God in you
[1:31:40] beseeching them to to come to Christ
[1:31:44] and we pray you in Christ said that ye
[1:31:46] be reconciled and just join the ministry
[1:31:49] join the ministry we who are born again
[1:31:52] have been born again
[1:31:56] to a responsibility
[1:31:58] to carry out this this ministry
[1:32:02] we read that it's it's the love of God
[1:32:05] he sheds it abroad uh it's in her heart
[1:32:09] and it constrains us it puts us out
[1:32:11] yonder to to win souls for Christ
[1:32:15] it's his love inside of us that pushes
[1:32:18] us out to do this ministry look you know
[1:32:22] I can see what brother Brandon was
[1:32:23] saying he says we need to pinch our
[1:32:24] conscience
[1:32:26] we need to do something that this word
[1:32:28] does something in her life
[1:32:31] because to sit here and hear this word
[1:32:33] and not be moved
[1:32:36] you're in a worse condition than I would
[1:32:38] imagine
[1:32:40] the word needs to move us
[1:32:43] not some action
[1:32:45] not some being just you know I could get
[1:32:48] up here this is true I could get up here
[1:32:49] and I could Minister without notes
[1:32:53] I couldn't Minister like this
[1:32:56] but I could
[1:32:58] but that would not make it any more God
[1:33:00] than what it is right now
[1:33:03] that word was still anointed
[1:33:09] I had a week for this word
[1:33:12] praise the Lord
[1:33:15] all right
[1:33:17] so I'm not going to be able to finish
[1:33:18] this
[1:33:21] but that's okay
[1:33:24] it's okay
[1:33:26] maybe we'll just we'll continue
[1:33:29] instead of pushing it I don't want to
[1:33:30] push it
[1:33:35] wait I mean you got to the part of
[1:33:36] finishing our ministry
[1:33:38] we have a Ministry but we got to finish
[1:33:40] it
[1:33:43] and and God
[1:33:45] clear as anything you know when God
[1:33:48] speaks to you God wants us to finish the
[1:33:51] Ministries given to us
[1:33:57] keep on
[1:34:01] keep on sharing Christ
[1:34:04] all the things that are are standing in
[1:34:06] your way the busyness the distractions
[1:34:11] the excuses
[1:34:15] don't let them become the thing that
[1:34:18] makes us unfaithful
[1:34:20] to the ministry that God's given us
[1:34:25] you know what happened to Paul I'll just
[1:34:28] I don't know if I'll have a chance to to
[1:34:30] share to do this I don't know the will
[1:34:33] of the Lord honestly for for Wednesday
[1:34:35] but you know Paul
[1:34:39] Paul was viewed at by other ministers
[1:34:42] as a weak
[1:34:45] speaker
[1:34:49] he was looked at one
[1:34:51] this is all in the scripture
[1:34:53] it's hid but it's there
[1:34:56] that they looked at Paul as someone who
[1:34:58] didn't want to
[1:35:01] have confrontation with others
[1:35:05] he didn't go into debating with others
[1:35:13] and
[1:35:14] so the other ministers kind of looked
[1:35:16] down on Paul thinking about this he's
[1:35:18] the he wrote 14 books he's the one that
[1:35:20] God chose he was the prophet of that age
[1:35:22] and he got other ministers during his
[1:35:24] time preaching Jesus
[1:35:27] that were looking down on him in a
[1:35:29] negative way
[1:35:33] so Paul he goes to compare himself with
[1:35:36] other ministers
[1:35:41] and he compares
[1:35:43] of of all his sufferings
[1:35:49] to bring Christ to others
[1:35:52] that's what he uses for comparison with
[1:35:53] with all the other ministers
[1:35:56] this is I labor more and I'm go to
[1:35:59] prison more I die more I'm Shipwrecked
[1:36:03] more
[1:36:04] and he uses this
[1:36:07] as
[1:36:09] his proof of his ministry not how great
[1:36:12] he can speak
[1:36:13] Paul wasn't a great speaker or
[1:36:17] uh Moses wasn't a great speaker
[1:36:22] God chooses the weakness where he can
[1:36:26] show forth his glory see you know Saints
[1:36:29] this is what's important it's important
[1:36:31] that you remain a witness in the middle
[1:36:33] of your trial
[1:36:35] because people are watching your life
[1:36:38] are you going to get offended when they
[1:36:40] slap you
[1:36:42] or are you going to turn the other cheek
[1:36:45] if someone asks you to go one mile are
[1:36:48] you gonna say again or will you go two
[1:36:52] because this is the ministry it may not
[1:36:55] be what we want it to be but it's the
[1:36:58] ministry
[1:36:59] and he's called us to finish it let's
[1:37:01] Stand Together God bless you this
[1:37:04] morning
[1:37:16] one place Paul said none of these things
[1:37:20] moved me
[1:37:22] so I may finish
[1:37:24] the ministry in which he called me amen
[1:37:29] he was so focused on that Ministry and
[1:37:31] Saints we need to
[1:37:37] if I could just ask a request that we
[1:37:41] could just spend a little bit of time
[1:37:42] maybe today talking to one another about
[1:37:45] the ministry that God has given us and
[1:37:48] to make sure that we're finishing it let
[1:37:50] it be part of the conversation give God
[1:37:52] a chance to let this word
[1:37:56] deal with us amen because I really
[1:37:59] believe it's him amen it's him
[1:38:04] um
[1:38:05] Because He Lives amen Because He Lives
[1:38:09] because
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:13] does he lived
[1:38:17] I can face tomorrow
[1:38:23] because he lives
[1:38:27] all fear is gone
[1:38:33] cause I know
[1:38:38] he holds my future
[1:38:42] and life is worth the Living Just
[1:38:48] Because He Lives
[1:38:53] Because He Lives
[1:38:57] I Can Face Tomorrow

[1:39:17] he holds my future
[1:39:21] and life is worth the Living Just
[1:39:26] Because He Lives
[1:39:31] Because He Lives
[1:39:36] I can face tomorrow

[1:39:45] all fear is gone
[1:39:50] because I know
[1:39:55] he holds my future
[1:39:59] and life is worth the Living Just
[1:40:04] Because He Lives
[1:40:08] is
[1:40:11] more of you
[1:40:17] more of you
[1:40:21] I've had it all but what I need is just
[1:40:27] more of you
[1:40:31] of things I've had my fear and yet I
[1:40:38] hunger
[1:40:40] still
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:44] hear our prayer for more of you foreign
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:23] Lord hear my prayer for more of you
[1:41:31] more of you amen he's promised to fill
[1:41:35] the hungry more of you
[1:41:40] I've had it all but what I need just
[1:41:46] more of you
[1:41:49] of things I've had my fear and yet I
[1:41:56] hunger still
[1:42:00] empty and bare Lord hear my prayer for
[1:42:05] more of you
[1:42:09] amen is
[1:42:12] my wife continues to play that
[1:42:15] real quietly maybe we could just all
[1:42:19] ow our heads and close our eyes for just
[1:42:23] a few moments before we go to him in
[1:42:25] prayer
[1:42:26] [Music]
[1:42:28] now I just wonder if there's anyone here
[1:42:31] today that really feels
[1:42:37] you've let the bars down on your
[1:42:40] ministry you know what you he's called
[1:42:42] you to do but you've just let the bars
[1:42:44] down
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:47] no my my mind goes and we've all seen it
[1:42:53] we've all seen people who've lost their
[1:42:55] their legs or their arms or
[1:42:58] some some
[1:42:59] horrible thing accident happened in
[1:43:02] their life and they're left without the
[1:43:04] ability to to run and and do things that
[1:43:09] they used to do but somehow they'll
[1:43:11] they'll sit up there and and give a
[1:43:14] speech that will just
[1:43:17] bring such conviction
[1:43:20] to you
[1:43:22] and they have such an attitude
[1:43:25] of really doing something with their
[1:43:27] life even though they're missing part of
[1:43:29] their body
