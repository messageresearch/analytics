[35:12] study a Bible study kind of feeling so
[35:15] we're going to spend a lot of time in
[35:16] the book of uh first Samuel second
[35:17] Samuel
[35:18] uh and the title of this message is the
[35:21] power of a bad decision so this is part
[35:24] three of our series our last part
[35:27] so I'll just pray the Lord just speaks
[35:29] to each one of us
[35:30] so first Samuel 13 and reverses uh sorry
[35:34] verse one
[35:36] so this is uh talking about King Saul so
[35:39] we all know about King Saul in the Old
[35:40] Testament he was the king before David
[35:42] So Israel they wanted to be just like
[35:45] the world they wanted a king to govern
[35:47] them and uh Samuel uh said you know said
[35:51] to them was trying to persuade them not
[35:54] but uh he they went ahead and still
[35:56] wanted that desire and he said did I not
[35:59] say did I say anything that was wrong
[36:01] did I take any money did I say what not
[36:04] the Lord has said they said no no but
[36:06] their desire was to have a king over
[36:09] them to be just like the outside world
[36:11] and so Saul was the king and we're gonna
[36:15] just talk a little bit about Saul today
[36:17] and just some decisions that he made uh
[36:20] so let's go verse one
[36:21] Saul reign one year and when he had
[36:24] reigned two years over Israel Saul chose
[36:27] him three thousand men of Israel
[36:29] wherefore 2000 or with Saul in mcmash
[36:32] and in Mount Bethel and the Thousand
[36:35] with Jonathan and gibbeth of Benjamin
[36:37] and the rest of the people he's uh the
[36:40] people he sent every way every man to
[36:42] his tent and Jonathan smote The Garrison
[36:45] of the Philistines that was in gibth and
[36:48] the Philistines heard of it and Saul
[36:50] blew the trumpet through all the lands
[36:52] saying let the Hebrews hear and all
[36:55] Israel heard that Saul has smitten a
[36:57] Garrison of the Philistines and that
[37:00] Israel also was had an Abomination with
[37:02] the Philistines and the people were
[37:04] called together after Saul to gilgal and
[37:07] the Philistines get themselves together
[37:09] to fight with Israel thirty thousand
[37:12] chariots and six thousand Horsemen and
[37:15] people as the sand which is on the
[37:17] seashore in the multitude and they came
[37:19] up and pitched in mcmash Eastward from
[37:22] Beth Haven when the men of Israel saw
[37:25] that they were in the strait for the
[37:27] people were distressed then the people
[37:29] that hide themselves in caves and
[37:31] thickets and in rocks and in high places
[37:32] and pits and some of the Hebrews went
[37:35] over to Jordan to the land of God and
[37:37] gilgad as for Saul he was yet in gilgal
[37:40] and all the people followed him
[37:41] trembling verse eight and he carried
[37:44] seven days according to the set time
[37:46] that Samuel had appointed so there was a
[37:49] uh a talk between Samuel and Saul that
[37:53] uh Saul was the Pacific thing in weight
[37:56] but Samuel came not to gilgad and the
[37:59] people were scattered from him and Saul
[38:00] did bring hither a burnt offering uh to
[38:02] me so and Saul said bring hither a burnt
[38:05] offering to me in peace offerings and he
[38:07] offered the burnt offering if you notice
[38:09] uh if you have a Scofield the top of
[38:11] that header says
[38:12] Saul intrudes into the priest's office
[38:15] so he's doing something that he's not
[38:17] called to do
[38:18] and let's keep going we'll go verse 10
[38:20] and it came to pass that as soon as he
[38:22] had made an end of the offering the
[38:23] burnt offering behold Samuel came and
[38:25] Saul went out to meet him that he might
[38:27] salute him
[38:29] and Saul and Samuel said what hast thou
[38:32] done and Saul said because I saw that
[38:34] people were scattered from me and thou
[38:37] came as not within the days appointed
[38:39] and at the Philistines gathered
[38:40] themselves together and mcmashed
[38:42] therefore said all right the Philistines
[38:44] will come down now upon me to Gilda and
[38:47] I have not made supplication unto the
[38:49] Lord I forced myself therefore and
[38:51] offered a burnt offering
[38:53] and Samuel said to to Saul that was done
[38:56] foolishly Saul not knowing that this
[38:58] very decision would impact his whole
[39:00] entire life
[39:02] done foolishly thou has not kept the
[39:04] Commandment of the Lord thy God
[39:07] when he commanded thee for now would thy
[39:10] Lord would the Lord have established thy
[39:11] kingdom upon Israel forever that one
[39:13] decision stopped his kingdom from being
[39:16] established forever
[39:18] verse 14 I'll have you guys sit down but
[39:20] now thy kingdom should not continue the
[39:22] Lord has sought him a man after his own
[39:24] heart and the Lord commanded him to be
[39:27] Captain over his people because thou has
[39:29] not kept that which the Lord commanded
[39:32] it you may sit down
[39:34] so that one decision that Saul made
[39:37] impacted not only him but his whole
[39:39] those around him and saw not realizing
[39:42] that obedience is better than sacrifices
[39:45] will read further down the road so it's
[39:48] so important when God has commanded us
[39:50] to do something whether it's to go
[39:52] witness whether it's to help a brother
[39:54] or sister in a church whether it's to
[39:56] stop doing this one thing that God wants
[39:59] you to stop doing that's a direct
[40:00] commandment from the Lord and our our
[40:03] job is to heed that commandment to
[40:06] follow through and Saul chose not to
[40:08] follow through with that commandment
[40:10] instead he hearkened unto the people he
[40:12] instead of instead of looking to the
[40:15] Lord who could help that situation he
[40:16] what he should have done was he should
[40:18] have went into prayer and say Lord I
[40:20] don't know what to do uh Samuel said
[40:22] he'll be here but instead he said oh I'm
[40:24] going to do this he decided to take it
[40:27] upon himself and let me intrude in this
[40:30] office and do this very thing
[40:32] and that was not pleasing to the Lord
[40:34] the Lord is very displeased upon that
[40:36] because he went outside of his office
[40:39] amen so if you want to turn with me uh
[40:42] let's go to Samuel 15. so it's a couple
[40:45] pages over and we're going to see Saul
[40:48] you think Saul would have learned his
[40:49] lesson see the thing was if Saul want to
[40:52] analyzed the bad decision he made in the
[40:55] first place he wouldn't have made a
[40:57] similar decision in in chapter 15. so
[41:00] when we do when we make a bad decision
[41:02] or do something we shouldn't have done
[41:04] we need to analyze what led up to that
[41:07] bad decision and we need to not make
[41:09] that same mistake as Saul is going to
[41:12] show us in the scriptures that he made a
[41:14] similar Mistake by uh not uh listening
[41:18] to the Commandment of God and it's so
[41:20] important to listen to the Commandment
[41:22] of God because when you listen to the
[41:24] Commandment of God it crosses fruit in
[41:26] your life it causes growth when you
[41:28] don't it crosses you uh unnecessary pain
[41:32] and turmoil because you decided not to
[41:34] listen to the voice of the Lord so
[41:35] reverse one in chapter 15. Samuel also
[41:39] said unto Saul the Lord sent me to
[41:42] anoint thee to be king over his people
[41:44] over Israel now therefore hearken thou
[41:46] unto the voice of the words of Lord now
[41:48] he's giving them an option to hearken he
[41:51] says hearken so Saul at that very moment
[41:54] he had a choice either to hearken fully
[41:57] or to hearken partially to hearken
[41:59] partially what you're doing is you're
[42:01] not following the will of the Lord
[42:02] because uh even
[42:04] Jesus said in uh Revelations 3 about the
[42:09] lukewarm believer I would have you be
[42:10] hot or cold and not lukewarm
[42:13] so let's go to verse two thus saith the
[42:15] Lord of hosts I remember that which
[42:17] amalek did to Israel how he laid weight
[42:20] for him in the way when he came up from
[42:21] Egypt now go and smite M like an early
[42:24] Destroyer all that they have and spare
[42:26] them not but slay both man and woman
[42:29] infant suckling ox and sheep cam on ass
[42:32] now notice God gave him a direct thing
[42:35] to do Specific Instructions to do not to
[42:39] do this or that but to do this very
[42:40] thing I have commanded you to do
[42:43] and Saul gathered the people together
[42:45] and numbered them and tell them
[42:47] 200 000 footmen and ten thousand men of
[42:50] Judah and Saul came to a city of emlic
[42:52] and laid wait in the valley and Saul
[42:55] said unto the kinites go depart get you
[42:58] down from among the amalekites lest I
[43:00] destroy you with them for you kindness
[43:03] to all the children of Israel when they
[43:05] came up out of Egypt
[43:07] so the kidneys departed from among the
[43:09] malachites and Saul smote the malachites
[43:12] from Havelock forgive me I can't
[43:14] pronounce either until thou came Mr sure
[43:16] that is over Egypt and he took agai the
[43:19] king of the amakites alive and other
[43:21] destroyed all the people with the edge
[43:23] of the sword but notice this statement
[43:25] right here but Saul and the people
[43:27] spared agai in the best of the sheep and
[43:30] the oxens and all the fatlings and the
[43:32] Lambs and all that was good and would
[43:35] not uh destroy them but everything that
[43:37] was vile refused that they destroyed
[43:40] utterly right there that displeased God
[43:44] because God didn't say to do that he
[43:46] said to destroy everything leave nothing
[43:49] so right then and there man likes to
[43:53] think they can think like oh I think God
[43:55] would like this God he says my ways are
[43:58] not your ways my thoughts are not your
[43:59] thoughts so we can't mix our own
[44:01] Thoughts with God's thoughts because God
[44:04] is not carnal he's he's spiritual his
[44:08] his thoughts are way higher than we can
[44:10] ever think of and that's why we need to
[44:12] Humble ourselves and let the mind of
[44:14] Christ dwell in US richly if Saul would
[44:17] humble himself and said if Saul would
[44:19] have made his mind up I am following the
[44:21] will of God the Commandment of God no
[44:23] matter what then it would have saved him
[44:25] and said to him the top of the header
[44:29] says Saul's incomplete obedience once
[44:31] again his self-will got him in trouble
[44:34] was going to get him in trouble once
[44:36] again
[44:36] let's go to verse 10.
[44:39] then came the word of the Lord unto
[44:41] Samuel saying it repenteth me that I
[44:43] have set up Saul to be king for he is
[44:46] turned back from following me and has
[44:49] not performed my Commandments and it
[44:51] Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the
[44:53] Lord all night
[44:55] and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul
[44:57] in the morning it was told Samuel saying
[45:00] Saul came to Carmel or came to Carmel
[45:03] and behold he set him a place and has
[45:05] gone about
[45:06] and passed on and gone down to gilgal
[45:10] and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said to
[45:13] him blessed be thou the Lord I have
[45:15] performed the Commandment of the Lord
[45:17] this is like a statement he said
[45:19] he just thought he did God a service
[45:22] that he just did God good oh I I did
[45:24] this I destroyed some people
[45:26] and and we're gonna see how what
[45:28] Samuel's erection is uh oh this is this
[45:31] uh this line kind of makes me laugh a
[45:33] little bit I just kind of picture and
[45:35] Samuel said what meaneth this the
[45:38] bleeding of the sheep just imagine you
[45:39] know Samuel is coming and here's she she
[45:42] bleeding he's like that's not what the
[45:44] Lord commanded you to do
[45:47] why is there why is there's casualty is
[45:50] still alive why is that Survivor still
[45:51] alive so let's keep it going I performed
[45:55] verse 14. and Samuel said what meaneth
[45:58] this the bleeding of the sheep in my
[46:00] ears and the lowing of The Oxen which I
[46:03] hear
[46:04] and Saul said they have brought them
[46:06] from the malachites for the people
[46:08] spared the best sheep and of oxen to
[46:11] sacrifice notice this I just found this
[46:14] out yesterday I was just studying and
[46:16] what brought to my attention was you've
[46:18] noticed that the two things when Saul
[46:20] did the Disobedience had to do with
[46:22] sacrifice and offerings and that
[46:24] obedience I just found out yesterday's
[46:27] kind of just studying so the very same
[46:30] mistake Saul made he was trying to give
[46:32] God an offering instead of being
[46:34] obedient obedience must come first
[46:37] before you can give a true offering
[46:39] because you can sacrifice and offer all
[46:41] you want to but if you're not being
[46:43] obedient to the voice of God it cannot
[46:45] make up for that so obedience is so
[46:48] important in our walks with God
[46:50] obedience will help you progress more
[46:54] intimate and more closer with God that's
[46:57] what God is asking for is obedience and
[46:59] the scripture says go you out go ye out
[47:01] the scripture says fast and pray praying
[47:04] fast it's Commandments from God
[47:08] um let me see what wrestle right now
[47:10] we're verse 16 I believe
[47:12] then Samuel said unto Saul stay I will
[47:15] tell thee what the Lord had said to me
[47:17] this night and he said unto him say on
[47:21] and Samuel said when I was little in my
[47:24] own sight was thou is not made the head
[47:26] of the tribes of Israel and the Lord
[47:28] anointed thee King over Israel God is
[47:31] trying to remind him where he took him
[47:33] from he came from humble beginnings but
[47:36] he forgot where he came from and let him
[47:39] being a king overshadow what he once was
[47:42] and pride began to enter to his life and
[47:45] he thought that he could do anything and
[47:47] God would be pleased but God doesn't
[47:49] care of your prestige if you're a
[47:53] um a song leader a minister a deacon a
[47:56] trustee he does not care about your
[47:58] prestige he cares about you honoring him
[48:01] in that position that you're in and you
[48:04] humbling yourself and being thankful
[48:05] that God even called you to be in that
[48:07] position
[48:10] verse 18. and the Lord sent thee on a
[48:13] journey and said go ugly destroy the
[48:16] Sinners the amalekites and fight against
[48:17] them until they be consumed wherefore
[48:21] then did is thou not obey the voice of
[48:23] the Lord
[48:24] but it is fly upon the spoil and it is
[48:27] evil on the side of the Lord and Saul
[48:29] said unto Samuel this notice a statement
[48:31] I have obeyed the voice of the Lord I he
[48:34] just he he just he's tricked himself so
[48:37] much into thinking that he he did
[48:39] exactly what the Lord has done and we
[48:41] can get that same type of predicament
[48:43] thinking that we're doing what God is
[48:45] telling us to do but we're leaving
[48:47] things out because it doesn't fit in our
[48:49] schedule it doesn't fit how we like it
[48:51] but it's not about what we like it's
[48:53] about what God likes
[48:55] so it doesn't matter how much uh Saul
[48:57] wanted to sacrifice these offerings God
[49:01] wanted obedience that's what God is
[49:03] Desiring his obedience for every one of
[49:05] us
[49:07] and Saul said to Samuel you have obeyed
[49:09] the voice of the Lord and have gone the
[49:11] way which the Lord sent me and have
[49:12] brought that guy the kingdom of the
[49:14] amalek and have early destroyed the
[49:16] amalekites but the people took of the
[49:18] spoiled Chief and oxen the chief of the
[49:21] things which should have been utterly
[49:22] destroyed to sacrifice unto Lord thy God
[49:25] and gilgal it's wonderful see brother
[49:27] Marty so good to see him
[49:29] verse 22 and Samuel said hath the Lord
[49:32] as great Delight in burnt offerings and
[49:35] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[49:38] the Lord notice this behold to obey is
[49:42] better than sacrifice than to hearken
[49:45] the fat of rams now notice verse 23
[49:48] says for Rebellion is as a sin of
[49:52] Witchcraft and Witchcraft you may think
[49:55] it's just magic and you know in sorcery
[49:57] but if you look at the definition in the
[49:59] Scofield one of the definitions it says
[50:00] to have intercourse with Satan to be
[50:03] intimate with Satan to have a connection
[50:04] with Satan because Satan is the author
[50:07] of uh Rebellion
[50:10] because what is what is obeying or
[50:13] rebelling is a perversion of not obeying
[50:15] God that's all it is a perversion
[50:17] because you're rebelling against God so
[50:19] it says the Sin of Witchcraft and
[50:21] stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry
[50:25] because that was rejected the word of
[50:27] the Lord
[50:29] he has also rejected thee from being
[50:32] King and Saul said unto Samuel I have
[50:35] sinned
[50:37] for I have transgressed the Commandment
[50:39] of the Lord and thy words because I
[50:40] feared the people and obeyed their voice
[50:43] now therefore I pray pardon my sin and
[50:46] turn again with me that I may Worship
[50:48] the Lord
[50:50] and Samuel said in the Saul I will not
[50:52] return with thee for thou has rejected
[50:54] the word or the word of the Lord and the
[50:57] Lord has rejected thee from being King
[50:59] over Israel
[51:00] and Samuel turned to go away and he laid
[51:02] a hold upon the skirt of his mantle and
[51:04] it went
[51:05] and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath
[51:07] read the Kingdom of Israel for me this
[51:09] day and have given it to a neighbor of
[51:12] thine that is better than now
[51:15] and also the strength of Israel will not
[51:17] lie nor repent free is not a man that he
[51:19] should repent
[51:20] then he said I have sinned yet honor me
[51:23] now I pray before the Elders of my
[51:25] people this notice that he wants to be
[51:27] still be honored in front of the people
[51:29] instead of him going to his prayer
[51:31] closet and just asking for forgiveness
[51:33] and repentance
[51:35] he wants to look good in front of the
[51:36] people
[51:38] then I said I I have sinned yet honor me
[51:41] now I prayed before the Elders of my
[51:42] people and before Israel and turn again
[51:44] with me that I may Worship the Lord thy
[51:46] God so Samuel turned it again after Saul
[51:49] and saw Worship the Lord then Samuel
[51:51] said
[51:52] bring ye hitherto me a God the king of
[51:55] amakites the word of God still has to be
[51:57] fulfilled
[51:58] he still had to fulfill that commandment
[51:59] because it says his word cannot return
[52:01] void so since Saul didn't want to do it
[52:04] then Samuel stepped in
[52:06] and that guy came unto him delicately
[52:08] and that guy said surely the bitterness
[52:10] of death has passed
[52:12] and Samuel said as the as thy sword hath
[52:15] made women childless shall thy mother be
[52:18] childless among women in Samuel hewed
[52:20] agai in pieces before the Lord in gilgal
[52:23] then Sammy went to rameth and Saul with
[52:25] him to his house to giveth of Saul
[52:28] and Samuel came no more to see Saul unto
[52:31] the day of his death nevertheless Samuel
[52:33] mourned for Saul and Lord repented they
[52:36] made Saul King over Israel Samuel had
[52:38] such a heart for Saul
[52:40] you know at the end of the day Samuel
[52:42] couldn't make the choices for Saul but
[52:44] it still hurt him to see him in that
[52:46] condition that the Lord rejected him as
[52:48] king and if you read further we're not
[52:51] going to be further but just how you
[52:53] know evil spirit got upon Saul and Saul
[52:56] was trying to kill David and uh he this
[53:00] Saul could never get in the grasp of
[53:02] just getting in line with God and just
[53:04] be humble in himself
[53:06] so he just kind of was always blinded
[53:08] just by his choices and we did see the
[53:10] power of bad decision not only to get
[53:12] himself killed by somebody but he got
[53:14] his son killed as well for his bad
[53:16] decisions so like I said the power of a
[53:19] bad decision your decisions that you
[53:20] make are so important as you said
[53:23] earlier in the series that it affects
[53:24] not only you but those around you your
[53:28] church brothers and sisters your your
[53:29] blood family so it's so important for us
[53:32] to heed to the voice of God and not
[53:35] become like how Saul became because
[53:37] these examples are put in the Bible for
[53:39] a reason for us to learn after not to do
[53:42] the same exact thing
[53:44] and let's go to we're going to talk
[53:46] another character King David let's go to
[53:48] second Samuel
[53:52] chapter 11.
[53:55] I want to take our time I'm not going to
[53:56] rush
[53:59] say Amen when you get there
[54:03] and we'll start with verse one
[54:05] and and it came to pass after the year
[54:07] was expired at the time
[54:09] when the Kings go forth to battle that
[54:11] David sent Joe ebb and his servants with
[54:13] him and all of Israel and they destroyed
[54:15] the children of Ammon and besieged
[54:18] rabbit but David Terry's still at
[54:20] Jerusalem now notice the first header of
[54:23] the scripture
[54:24] was it says at the time when the Kings
[54:27] go forth to battle
[54:29] and notice David stayed there and
[54:31] tarried so right then and there
[54:34] something was wrong because if he went
[54:37] out with the to battle with the Kings
[54:40] this thing that's going to happen to him
[54:42] I believe wouldn't have happened
[54:44] but still at the end of the day there
[54:46] was something in David's life that he
[54:48] never dealt with
[54:50] and we're gonna see what that very thing
[54:52] is that he didn't deal with so let's go
[54:54] to verse two
[54:55] see Satan knows
[54:58] the thing the vices you have in your
[55:00] life the things you have been dealt with
[55:02] so it's best to get delivered from those
[55:06] things instead of letting them just lay
[55:09] dormant in your life because eventually
[55:10] they're going to come out like a kid
[55:12] when he cleans his room sometimes he
[55:14] throws everything in the closet that's
[55:16] eventually going to be made to light you
[55:19] can only hide things for so long
[55:21] let's go to verse uh two and it came to
[55:24] pass in the evening tide that David
[55:26] arose from in the bed and walked upon
[55:28] the roof of the King's house and from
[55:30] the roof he saw a woman washing herself
[55:32] and the woman was very beautiful to look
[55:35] upon now notice if he was at the Battle
[55:37] he never would have seen this
[55:41] but but the devil saw an opportunity to
[55:44] lay something before David and to see
[55:46] what would happen the devil likes to lay
[55:49] traps before us but we have to be sober
[55:52] and to be vigilant to be able to
[55:55] be aware of them
[55:56] verse verse 3 and David sent in inquired
[56:00] after the woman and one said it's not
[56:02] this Bathsheba the daughter of Elam the
[56:04] wife of Uriah the high type
[56:07] and David sent Messengers and took her
[56:09] and she came into him and he lay with
[56:11] her for she was purified from
[56:13] uncleanliness and she returned into her
[56:15] house now notice this very thing
[56:17] so David
[56:19] was on his roof and he saw this girl
[56:22] and obviously you know he he didn't
[56:25] expect her to be there obviously but he
[56:28] did not think about it he made a
[56:30] decision based upon his flesh he lusted
[56:33] after he said oh this girl is right here
[56:35] uh she's beautiful I want her
[56:38] and he even asked and they told him that
[56:40] this is another man's wife
[56:43] and he went in and committed this sin
[56:45] with her he never thought he never
[56:47] thought it through he never thought the
[56:48] consequences of it he just did what felt
[56:50] good to his flesh a lot of times things
[56:54] will feel good to your flesh but they
[56:56] will not they will hurt your spiritual
[56:58] man inside and David not realized this
[57:01] would change his whole very life and he
[57:04] kept going further and further he tried
[57:06] to hide the sin knowing that you cannot
[57:08] hide nothing from God God knows what
[57:11] you're thinking right very this moment
[57:15] amen
[57:16] let's go to verse four over reverse four
[57:18] and David sent messages and took her and
[57:20] she came in unto him and he lay with her
[57:22] where she was purified from her
[57:24] uncleanliness and she returned to her
[57:26] house and the woman conceived see David
[57:29] didn't expect that the the the stories
[57:31] is getting more more uh crazier and
[57:34] crazier
[57:35] and sent and told David said I am a
[57:37] child they was just probably like oh my
[57:39] goodness what have I done what have I
[57:41] done he's just probably just pacing
[57:44] around just walking what have I done now
[57:46] he's trying to figure this situate out
[57:47] he's trying to figure this situation out
[57:50] himself now he's trying to incorporate
[57:52] his own thoughts and ideas to for him
[57:55] not to get in trouble knowing that if he
[57:58] would have just if he would just
[58:00] recognize and realize he made this this
[58:02] bad grave decision and he would just uh
[58:05] just pray to the Lord earnestly I
[58:07] believe the Lord would have showed him
[58:08] some Grace he still had consequences but
[58:11] the consequences he's about to have by
[58:13] him continuing this act is going to be
[58:16] so detrimental he's not even going to
[58:18] realize it but I believe if he would
[58:20] have just took the time and said I need
[58:22] to make this right I I messed up I'm
[58:26] gonna ask this man for forgiveness
[58:28] and if he would have went that way this
[58:30] this would have been a totally different
[58:32] story
[58:32] and David sent to joab saying Send Me
[58:36] Uriah the high tide and joab sent Uriah
[58:39] to David and when Uriah was come unto
[58:42] him David demanded of him how job did
[58:45] and how the people did and how the war
[58:47] prospered and David said to Uriah go
[58:49] down to thy house and wash thy feet
[58:52] and notice what David's uh motive was
[58:56] let's talk about motives notice what
[58:58] David's motive was I'm gonna ask you a
[59:00] question was it a pure motive or was it
[59:02] a mixed motive
[59:05] amen mixed motive because David wanted
[59:08] Uriah to go with his wife and sleep with
[59:12] her thinking that the kid was going to
[59:14] be his
[59:15] but we're gonna see how faithful Uriah
[59:18] was I I love talking about your eye he's
[59:20] a faithful man
[59:23] so he's saying right what's coming to
[59:24] him abandoned him we'll go to verse 8.
[59:26] and David said Shira go down to thy
[59:28] house and wash thy feet and we ride
[59:31] departed out of the King's house and
[59:33] there followed him a mess of meat from
[59:35] the King but Uriah slept at the door of
[59:38] the King's house let's look at that
[59:39] loyalty
[59:41] with all the Servants of his Lord he
[59:43] didn't he didn't try to make himself up
[59:45] something he knew what he was he was a
[59:48] servant to God he was of the army of the
[59:51] Living God he wanted us to fight for his
[59:52] King
[59:54] amen with all the Servants of his Lord
[59:56] and went not down to his house and when
[59:58] they had told David saying your eye went
[1:00:00] down into his house David said unto you
[1:00:03] right cometh thou not from that Journey
[1:00:05] why then did this thou not go down into
[1:00:07] the house and Uriah said unto the David
[1:00:10] The Ark in Israel in Judah abide intense
[1:00:13] and my Lord job and the Servants of my
[1:00:16] Lord are encamped in the Open Fields
[1:00:18] shall I then go into my house to eat and
[1:00:21] to drink and to lie with my wife as thou
[1:00:24] livest as I soul liveth I will not do
[1:00:27] this thing I bless a true servant of the
[1:00:29] Lord right there
[1:00:30] he he saw a situation he he wanted to
[1:00:33] help any way he could even it was to
[1:00:36] give his life for for Israel
[1:00:39] and David still even after David hearing
[1:00:42] that he was still trying that one very
[1:00:44] mixed motive to get him to go to his
[1:00:46] wife
[1:00:47] not trying to make the situation right
[1:00:49] but trying to cover the situation up
[1:00:53] and David said to Uriah Terry here today
[1:00:55] also and tomorrow I will let thee depart
[1:00:57] so Uriah Abode in Jerusalem that day and
[1:01:00] tomorrow and when David had called him
[1:01:02] he did eat and drink before him he even
[1:01:05] tried to make him he made him drunk for
[1:01:08] the very intent for him to go to his
[1:01:09] house all this to make him go to his
[1:01:11] house instead of if David would have
[1:01:13] confronted like a man and talk man to
[1:01:15] man maybe you're right might have
[1:01:17] punched him in the face but I already
[1:01:18] had somebody punch me in the face and
[1:01:20] you know for somebody to die over this
[1:01:23] this this thing that happened
[1:01:26] and when David had called him he did eat
[1:01:28] and drink before him and he made him
[1:01:29] drunk and that even and we were about to
[1:01:31] lie on his bed with the Servants of his
[1:01:33] Lord but went not down to his house
[1:01:36] wow this man was just so loyal and it
[1:01:40] came to pass in the morning that David
[1:01:41] wrote a letter to Joe had been sent it
[1:01:44] by the hand of your eye notice what this
[1:01:46] letter said
[1:01:47] and he wrote the letter saying yet Uriah
[1:01:50] in the Forefront of the hottest battle
[1:01:52] retire you from him that he may die into
[1:01:54] him notice this David gave this man a
[1:01:59] letter that was declared for him to die
[1:02:02] and had the this the very man that was
[1:02:04] going to die carry the letter and send
[1:02:07] it to joab notice that and this man uh
[1:02:10] Uriah never looked at the letter that's
[1:02:11] how much he trust he had in David so
[1:02:14] David sent this man to his death and the
[1:02:16] man not even knowing his death sentence
[1:02:18] was directly in his hand
[1:02:21] is just see did just because David was a
[1:02:25] child of God
[1:02:27] doesn't mean
[1:02:30] that every day that doesn't mean that
[1:02:32] this whole thing can be covered up like
[1:02:34] I said there's consequences so David
[1:02:37] thought probably all my child of God
[1:02:38] everything is going to work out fine I'm
[1:02:40] gonna try to hide this and covers up
[1:02:42] from God and I'm gonna kill this man
[1:02:44] everything's gonna be okay this man's
[1:02:46] out the picture I can lawfully now have
[1:02:48] this man's wife even though I slept with
[1:02:50] her before why this man's still alive
[1:02:52] but David thought I'm gonna kill this
[1:02:54] man and the wife's all mine oh my but
[1:02:57] we're going to see what happens happens
[1:02:58] in this story
[1:03:00] and it came to pass oh and he wrote in
[1:03:02] the letter saying yet you're right in
[1:03:04] the Forefront of the hottest battle and
[1:03:06] retire you from him that he may be
[1:03:08] smitten and die and it came to pass when
[1:03:11] job observed the city that he assigned
[1:03:14] Uriah into a place where he knew that
[1:03:16] Valiant men were wow and the men of the
[1:03:20] city went out and fought with joab and
[1:03:22] therefore some of the people of the
[1:03:23] Servants of David and Uriah the high
[1:03:25] tide died also
[1:03:28] then job sinned and told David all the
[1:03:30] things concerning the war and he charged
[1:03:32] the messenger saying well now has made
[1:03:34] an end of telling the matters of the war
[1:03:36] unto the king and to be so that the
[1:03:38] king's wrath arise and he say unto thee
[1:03:40] wherefore approach he so nigh into the
[1:03:42] sea when he did fight know ye not that
[1:03:45] they would shoot from the wall verse 21
[1:03:47] who smote abimelech the son of
[1:03:51] jerusa forgive me did not a woman cast a
[1:03:54] piece of Milestone upon him though from
[1:03:57] the wall that he died in the the best
[1:03:59] why when ye nigh to the wall then say
[1:04:03] thou that servant your eye the head the
[1:04:05] hittite is dead
[1:04:07] we're going to kind of skip down to 25.
[1:04:10] thus David said unto the messenger Thou
[1:04:12] shalt say unto job let not this thing
[1:04:14] displeased thee for the sword devoureth
[1:04:16] one as well another wow make the battle
[1:04:20] more strong against the city and
[1:04:21] overthrow it and encourage thou him
[1:04:24] and then the wife of Uriah heard that
[1:04:26] Uriah her husband was dead and she
[1:04:27] mourned for her husband now notice this
[1:04:29] and when the morning was passed David
[1:04:31] sent and fetched her to a solid and she
[1:04:33] became his wife literally like nothing
[1:04:35] happened he didn't even care that your
[1:04:37] eye died he didn't care how how faithful
[1:04:39] he was to God how how Valiant of a
[1:04:42] soldier he was he didn't care about his
[1:04:44] loyalty all he cared all he had was in
[1:04:46] mind was marrying this woman no matter
[1:04:49] what
[1:04:50] that's all he had in mind that's his
[1:04:51] motive to marry this woman no matter
[1:04:53] what
[1:04:54] and and she became his wife and bear him
[1:04:57] a son but the thing that David had done
[1:05:00] displeased the Lord wow
[1:05:04] let's go to we're going to chapter 12
[1:05:06] now
[1:05:08] and the Lord sent Nathan unto David
[1:05:10] and he came unto him and said unto him
[1:05:13] there were two men in one city the one
[1:05:16] rich and the other poor
[1:05:18] the rich man had exceedingly many flocks
[1:05:21] and hurts but the poor man had nothing
[1:05:23] save one little ew lamb
[1:05:26] which he had brought or bought and
[1:05:28] nourished up and it grew up together
[1:05:30] with him and with his children and it
[1:05:32] did eat of his own meat and drank of his
[1:05:34] own cup and lay in his bosom and was
[1:05:36] unto him a daughter and there came a
[1:05:39] traveler unto the rich man
[1:05:41] and he spared to take of his own flock
[1:05:43] of his own herd to dress for the
[1:05:46] wayfaring man that was come unto him but
[1:05:48] took the poor man's lamb and dressed it
[1:05:50] for the man that was come to him verse 5
[1:05:53] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[1:05:56] against that man I remember brother
[1:05:58] Diggs said that the Giant Killer was
[1:05:59] coming out of David this man should die
[1:06:02] and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth
[1:06:05] the man that hath done this thing shall
[1:06:07] surely die David's pronouncing judgment
[1:06:09] this man shall die and little did David
[1:06:11] know that this story was talking about
[1:06:13] him didn't even know it that's how blind
[1:06:15] David was he thought that he had
[1:06:17] everything under the rug your eyes out
[1:06:19] the picture and the wife's mind and the
[1:06:21] baby's mind it's all mine
[1:06:24] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[1:06:26] because he did this thing and because he
[1:06:28] had no pity now notice this
[1:06:31] uh next next verse and David's anger uh
[1:06:33] verse 6.
[1:06:35] and he shall our verse 7 now
[1:06:39] and Nathan said to David
[1:06:41] Thou Art the man I'm going to see
[1:06:44] David's heart
[1:06:45] just sunk he was probably speechless he
[1:06:49] didn't know what to say because he he
[1:06:51] was like wow God knows the whole thing
[1:06:54] that I've done
[1:06:55] he said and then look what God Said I
[1:06:57] anointed thee King over Israel I
[1:07:01] delivered thee all the hand of Saul
[1:07:03] literally David was running from Saul he
[1:07:06] was trying to kill him every chance he
[1:07:08] could
[1:07:09] and God had a reminder did I not anoint
[1:07:11] thee King over Israel did I not deliver
[1:07:14] thee out of the hand of Saul let's go to
[1:07:17] verse 8. and it says I gave thee thy
[1:07:21] Master's house and thy Masters wives
[1:07:23] into thy bosom
[1:07:25] and gave Thee the house of Israel and of
[1:07:27] Judah
[1:07:28] and if that had been too little I would
[1:07:30] have more ever have given unto thee such
[1:07:33] things God said I would have given you
[1:07:35] more things but instead you went upon
[1:07:38] your self-passions and took this man's
[1:07:41] wife and killed him
[1:07:44] he I gave you all these things David you
[1:07:46] have 500 wives what was another to you
[1:07:49] was that not enough
[1:07:52] let's go to verse 9. wherefore that's
[1:07:55] despise the Commandments of the Lord to
[1:07:57] do evil in his sight thou has killed
[1:08:00] Uriah the high tide with the sword and
[1:08:03] has taken his wife to be thy wife and
[1:08:06] that slain him with the sword of the
[1:08:07] children of Ammon
[1:08:09] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:08:11] depart from thy house notice this this
[1:08:15] very decision that David made now he's
[1:08:18] going to be thrown out of his King King
[1:08:20] hoodness that made that word up now he's
[1:08:23] gonna
[1:08:24] suffer his
[1:08:26] um his Absalom wanting to kill him the
[1:08:31] very thing that he has run away from
[1:08:32] Saul's trying to kill him he went back
[1:08:34] into the very same thing because he made
[1:08:36] this bad decision so we need to you may
[1:08:39] say well I'm not David I didn't make
[1:08:41] this decision
[1:08:42] but what type of things are you holding
[1:08:44] on to your life that can come out
[1:08:47] similar to this and destroy everything
[1:08:49] around you not only you but everything
[1:08:51] around you
[1:08:52] we need to make sure every stone is
[1:08:55] unturned we need to make sure that the
[1:08:57] vices that we have in our life we need
[1:08:59] to overcome them because we are called
[1:09:01] to be Overcomers not to just live with
[1:09:04] this thing our whole entire life you can
[1:09:06] overcome it because God has called us to
[1:09:07] overcome it but you have to have that
[1:09:10] strong desire and faith that you can
[1:09:12] overcome this thing in your life
[1:09:14] because if David would have dealt with
[1:09:16] his vice in his life this women problem
[1:09:18] we saw that in uh the I believe the
[1:09:21] Samson the Samson we talked about he had
[1:09:24] a woman problem he never dealt with it
[1:09:26] and look what it did to him it destroyed
[1:09:28] him so if David would have dealt with
[1:09:30] this he would have never been in this
[1:09:32] predicament but he decided to keep it
[1:09:35] under the rug and it came out
[1:09:37] and it came out in Solomon even had the
[1:09:39] same problem because he never dealt with
[1:09:41] it it carried over to Solomon
[1:09:45] forgot what right now verse verse 10.
[1:09:49] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:09:51] depart from my house because thou has
[1:09:54] despised me I notice this he's still a
[1:09:56] Son of God but I'll tell you it's one
[1:09:58] thing his relationship with God was
[1:10:01] never the same again because he made
[1:10:03] this very mistake God forgave him of the
[1:10:05] sin but that closeness that he once had
[1:10:08] it wasn't the same it is it couldn't be
[1:10:11] the same
[1:10:14] says
[1:10:15] thus thus saith the Lord behold I will
[1:10:18] raise up evil against thee of thy own
[1:10:20] house and I will take thy wives before
[1:10:23] thy eyes and give them unto thy neighbor
[1:10:25] and he shall lie with thy wives in the
[1:10:27] sight of the son for thou did it
[1:10:30] secretly but I will do this thing before
[1:10:32] all Israel and before this son I
[1:10:34] remember brother Ferguson we did a
[1:10:35] little bible you did a little bible
[1:10:36] study on that
[1:10:37] that God will bring things if you don't
[1:10:39] want to deal with this thing
[1:10:41] like how the Lord give you a chance to
[1:10:43] do it then God he might bring it out
[1:10:44] openly like this
[1:10:46] and we don't want to go to that those
[1:10:48] type of situations we want to just deal
[1:10:51] with it right then and there if you did
[1:10:52] something wrong made a mistake make it
[1:10:54] right brother Brahm said this statement
[1:10:56] he says
[1:10:58] um always tell the truth no matter the
[1:11:02] outcome always tell the truth no matter
[1:11:04] the outcome it's best to make things
[1:11:07] right now then wait till later because
[1:11:09] later we'll escalate in a situation
[1:11:12] similar to this
[1:11:14] always does
[1:11:16] for thou Jesus secretly but I would do
[1:11:18] this thing before all Israel for the son
[1:11:20] and David sent unto and David said unto
[1:11:22] Nathan I have sinned against the Lord
[1:11:25] and Nathan said unto David the Lord has
[1:11:27] also put away that sin thou shall not
[1:11:29] die I will give David some credit right
[1:11:31] here he was a man to repent when he did
[1:11:34] something wrong he would make it right
[1:11:36] and David after this whole situation and
[1:11:39] God knowing he realized that he did
[1:11:41] wrong and if you I think if you want to
[1:11:43] ever read Psalms 51 it kind of talks
[1:11:46] about that and he just asked for
[1:11:48] forgiveness and David he knew he did
[1:11:51] wrong and he wanted to make it right
[1:11:53] with God and he did all he could to make
[1:11:55] it right which I I I just I I'm thankful
[1:11:58] for that because if you make a mistake
[1:12:01] in your life you can't let it destroy
[1:12:04] you
[1:12:05] because you can't go back and change the
[1:12:07] past how many of you guys in here would
[1:12:09] love to change something you did in the
[1:12:10] past to somebody I'm pretty sure
[1:12:11] everybody can raise their hand and say
[1:12:13] that but you can't you gotta learn and
[1:12:15] grow from it and not make the same
[1:12:18] mistake over again and and David
[1:12:20] analyzed that and he didn't do the same
[1:12:22] thing again obviously but he had still
[1:12:25] had to pay for that consequence
[1:12:27] well verse
[1:12:29] um 13 again and David said unto Nathan I
[1:12:32] have sinned against the Lord
[1:12:34] and Nathan said unto David the Lord also
[1:12:37] had put away thy sin thou shall not die
[1:12:40] how be it because by this deed that was
[1:12:43] given great occasion to the enemies of
[1:12:45] the Lord to blessing the child
[1:12:49] or blasting I'm sorry to blasphemy the
[1:12:51] child also that is born unto thee shall
[1:12:53] surely die
[1:12:55] notice the child had to suffer
[1:12:58] death because of the decision that the
[1:13:01] parents made and you can't leave
[1:13:03] Bathsheba out of this either because it
[1:13:05] takes two to tango she she she had a
[1:13:08] choice whether to sleep with David or
[1:13:09] not
[1:13:10] and she she also made a bad decision as
[1:13:12] well so we can't just point this on one
[1:13:15] person but it was two takes two to tango
[1:13:18] because she's supposed to be faithful to
[1:13:19] her husband while he's away and she
[1:13:21] wasn't
[1:13:23] and Nathan um
[1:13:25] and Nathan departed onto his house and
[1:13:27] the Lord struck the child that uriah's
[1:13:29] wife bear unto David and it was very
[1:13:31] sick
[1:13:32] David therefore besought God for the
[1:13:34] child and David fasted no say he was
[1:13:37] praying earnestly fasting and went in
[1:13:40] and laid all night upon the Earth this
[1:13:43] laying all night just crying out to God
[1:13:45] say God please spare my child
[1:13:49] and the Elders of his house arose and
[1:13:51] went to him and to raise him up from the
[1:13:53] Earth but he would not neither did he
[1:13:55] eat bread with them and it came to pass
[1:13:56] on a seventh day so I'm guessing that he
[1:13:59] was fasting for seven days not eating
[1:14:02] anything just laying upon the Earth
[1:14:03] that's how bad he wanted his child to
[1:14:06] live
[1:14:07] that the child and the child died and
[1:14:10] the Servants of David feared to tell him
[1:14:12] that the child was dead
[1:14:14] for he said behold while the child was
[1:14:17] in alive we spake unto him and he would
[1:14:19] not hearken unto our voice how will he
[1:14:21] then Vex himself if we tell him that the
[1:14:23] child is dead but when David saw that
[1:14:26] his servants whispered David perceived
[1:14:29] that the child was dead therefore David
[1:14:31] said unto his servants is this child
[1:14:33] dead and they said he's dead then David
[1:14:36] arose from the earth and washed and
[1:14:38] anointed himself and changed his apparel
[1:14:40] and came into the house of the Lord and
[1:14:42] worshiped then he came to his own house
[1:14:44] and we require they set bread before him
[1:14:47] he did eat
[1:14:48] then said his service unto him what
[1:14:50] thing is this that thou has done
[1:14:52] thou doubt it as fast then weep for the
[1:14:55] child while I was alive but when the
[1:14:57] child was dead thou did his rise and eat
[1:14:59] bread and he said while the child was
[1:15:01] hit alive I fasted and wept for I said
[1:15:04] who can tell whether God will be
[1:15:05] gracious to me that the child may live
[1:15:07] but now he's dead wherefore should I
[1:15:10] fast can I bring him back I shall go to
[1:15:12] him but he shall not return to me David
[1:15:15] knew he would see that child one day
[1:15:18] verse 24 think about this out this great
[1:15:22] debacle that David made
[1:15:25] God made good of the situation because
[1:15:27] Solomon was born the wisest man on the
[1:15:30] whole entire Earth
[1:15:33] and David comforted Bathsheba his wife
[1:15:35] who went unto her and laid with her and
[1:15:37] she buried son and he called his name
[1:15:40] Solomon and the Lord loved him
[1:15:43] and he sent by the hand of Nathan the
[1:15:45] prophet and he called his name Judith
[1:15:47] because of the Lord and job fought
[1:15:50] against rebeth of the children of Ammon
[1:15:52] and took the Royal City
[1:15:55] so like I said like we wouldn't say this
[1:15:57] when you get to when you get so deep
[1:15:59] into something like this
[1:16:01] and you don't make it right you'll lose
[1:16:03] all cider right and wrong David didn't
[1:16:05] know right from wrong he just knew that
[1:16:07] I had to get this situation fixed and
[1:16:10] I'm gonna fix it myself
[1:16:11] and him fixing it himself made more
[1:16:14] problems because now absalom's gonna
[1:16:17] um kick him out his kingdom and one of
[1:16:19] his sons is gonna do something with his
[1:16:21] his daughter and all these events happen
[1:16:24] just because think about that that one
[1:16:26] decision these chain of events are going
[1:16:28] to happen in David's life not right away
[1:16:30] but they're gonna begin to unfold like
[1:16:32] dominoes and David's life fell to Pieces
[1:16:34] he was running away
[1:16:36] all because he didn't deal with that
[1:16:39] Vice that was in his life
[1:16:41] years ago
[1:16:43] David never dealt with his vice he said
[1:16:45] we carried it for many years but if he
[1:16:47] dealt with it he could he he wouldn't
[1:16:49] have to go through the things he went
[1:16:50] through I mean a couple quotes
[1:16:53] God had revealed it to the prophet he
[1:16:55] said David there was a rich man lived on
[1:16:57] the side of the road he had a whole lot
[1:16:58] of sheep oh he was very rich a man lived
[1:17:01] on the side of the road was poor he had
[1:17:03] one lamb he treated like a daughter he
[1:17:06] fed out the same spoon he ate with it he
[1:17:08] slept with the limb everything was just
[1:17:10] it was just like a daughter to him and
[1:17:12] one day a visitor came so instead of the
[1:17:14] rich man taking of his own sheep and
[1:17:16] making a feast for the visitor well
[1:17:18] instead of that he went over took the
[1:17:21] poor man's lamb and by force took the
[1:17:23] lamb and slayed it and made a feast now
[1:17:25] David that was David's Passions
[1:17:28] he had 500 wives but when he see uriah's
[1:17:32] wife instead of taking one of his 500
[1:17:33] wives to appease or satisfy his Passions
[1:17:37] he took this other man's wife then
[1:17:40] killed Uriah and she became a mother
[1:17:42] David didn't know what he was doing why
[1:17:44] David was ready to pronounce judgment
[1:17:47] that's the way we are we can always
[1:17:49] judge the other fellow but when it comes
[1:17:52] to us that's different
[1:17:55] David said the man will pay with his
[1:17:57] life
[1:17:58] that old Prophet them eyes narrowed down
[1:18:01] and said David
[1:18:02] surely you'll not die watch Grace there
[1:18:06] go to work right quick the spirit struck
[1:18:09] the prophet saved David's life Grace
[1:18:13] surely you'll not die but the sword will
[1:18:17] not leave your house to it thoroughly
[1:18:20] Purge your heart
[1:18:22] for you are that rich man oh it was
[1:18:24] different then wasn't it
[1:18:25] what saved David
[1:18:28] when his own judgment said the man will
[1:18:30] die he paid other most and he'll pay for
[1:18:32] what his life and the prophet said
[1:18:34] surely Grace you won't die you'll not
[1:18:37] die David Grace has saved you it was
[1:18:39] Grace to David that saved him oh my if
[1:18:42] it had been for Grace where will we all
[1:18:44] be
[1:18:46] all the bad decisions we made in our
[1:18:48] life it was the grace of God it did not
[1:18:50] consume us
[1:18:51] and I'm thankful that that things they
[1:18:54] all work together for our good even the
[1:18:55] bad decisions we make somehow God will
[1:18:57] make it work for your good but you're
[1:18:59] going to have to still learn that lesson
[1:19:01] but eventually you'll go over that hump
[1:19:04] and learn but don't go around the
[1:19:06] mountain don't keep going around the
[1:19:07] mountain over and over again learn and
[1:19:09] move on like brother John was preaching
[1:19:12] move forward yeah God God is always
[1:19:14] moving forward and we got to keep moving
[1:19:15] forward and David had to do the same
[1:19:17] thing David had to move forward
[1:19:20] let's go to um
[1:19:23] like another else for a message of Grace
[1:19:25] 1961.
[1:19:27] David and his high robes and his big
[1:19:29] crown and he had job out there his great
[1:19:31] General and all the fighting going on he
[1:19:33] was keeping all the enemies of the
[1:19:35] Border Lines and things
[1:19:37] everything was going right he had a baby
[1:19:38] by this Bathsheba and that poor little
[1:19:40] ride go out there and had job standing
[1:19:43] by his side until we drew from him the
[1:19:45] boy died when the sun went down with the
[1:19:47] battle knife in his hand the blood on
[1:19:48] his shield
[1:19:49] where he stood for Israel yet he
[1:19:51] apostolate he was to the religion then
[1:19:54] when job came back and told him that
[1:19:56] David had died that he had died David
[1:19:58] thought everything was all right I've
[1:20:01] gotten his wife and everything will be
[1:20:03] all right got a baby but the baby took
[1:20:05] sick the baby started dying he did
[1:20:07] everything he could to save the baby's
[1:20:09] life perhaps every doctor no good father
[1:20:11] baby died they was afraid to tell David
[1:20:15] the baby was dead
[1:20:16] and he died then he thought everything
[1:20:18] was hid so he come for best sheep but he
[1:20:20] already taken her for his wife after all
[1:20:21] those other wives now brother braham's
[1:20:23] going to the heart of the story again
[1:20:24] this old Prophet old bald-headed fellow
[1:20:27] stomped in Old Nathan out of the
[1:20:29] Wilderness sat down David how's
[1:20:31] everything going said fine fine old
[1:20:33] Prophet I I love how David is kind of
[1:20:35] played it off and we do the same thing
[1:20:36] we kind of just play something off and
[1:20:39] not just deal with the root of the
[1:20:40] problem
[1:20:41] he said oh prophet of God live forever
[1:20:44] hallelujah oh he was just he thought
[1:20:46] everything was fine he thought he could
[1:20:47] hide it but you can't hide from god
[1:20:50] notice that he knows what you're
[1:20:52] thinking right now he knows your
[1:20:55] thoughts for he's God
[1:20:58] that Holy Spirit that's in the building
[1:21:00] this morning he's here now knows your
[1:21:02] thoughts who you are where you come from
[1:21:04] what you've done for Jesus Christ is the
[1:21:07] same yesterday today and forever one
[1:21:11] more quote then we'll go to Second
[1:21:12] Timothy
[1:21:13] David if he did wrong and taking your
[1:21:15] eye the high Tide's wife the lovely
[1:21:18] Bathsheba was going to be the father of
[1:21:20] her child and he caused her husband to
[1:21:22] be killed in battle but when the prophet
[1:21:24] Nathan come in and revealed his sins to
[1:21:26] him
[1:21:27] then David thought on his ways notice
[1:21:29] that and he turned himself to repentance
[1:21:32] and setc cloth and Ashes that's the way
[1:21:35] to turn
[1:21:36] God heard him
[1:21:37] notice a statement here God will always
[1:21:39] hear a man or a woman that will turn
[1:21:42] their feet to his testimony
[1:21:44] so we have to be open and honest with
[1:21:47] God don't try to hide anything just pour
[1:21:49] your heart out to them be honest if you
[1:21:51] messed up that's okay be honest about it
[1:21:54] God knows you're going to mess up but
[1:21:57] you learn from that girl from don't let
[1:21:59] something you've done wrong embarrass
[1:22:02] you or hinder your growth your best it's
[1:22:04] best to get out to God because I might
[1:22:06] get out to the open
[1:22:08] second Timothy chapter 20 verse chapter
[1:22:11] 20. second Timothy verse 20.
[1:22:15] the Bible huh
[1:22:19] second Timothy oh sorry verse 19
[1:22:22] actually
[1:22:25] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:22:27] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[1:22:31] knoweth them that are his that everyone
[1:22:33] that nameth
[1:22:36] the name of Christ apart from iniquity
[1:22:38] we all know what iniquity is uh knowing
[1:22:40] to do something and not doing it so the
[1:22:42] scripture is calling us to depart from
[1:22:44] that
[1:22:44] When God says do something just do it so
[1:22:47] iniquity doesn't become come in your
[1:22:49] life
[1:22:50] and with verse 20 put in a great house
[1:22:53] they're not only vessels of gold and of
[1:22:55] silver but also of wood and of Earth and
[1:22:57] some to honor and some to dishonor in
[1:23:00] verse 21
[1:23:01] if a man therefore
[1:23:04] Purge himself from these so it's calling
[1:23:07] this has to be a purification a purging
[1:23:11] inside of us
[1:23:13] he shall be a vessel into honor see God
[1:23:16] see God's purpose and motive is to make
[1:23:19] us a vessel unto honor Sanctified and
[1:23:22] met for the Master's use notice that for
[1:23:26] the Master's use not for our own selfish
[1:23:29] use but so the master can use you like
[1:23:32] we we talked the other day go ye out
[1:23:34] that's one of the what the Master's uses
[1:23:36] for
[1:23:37] we're going to see in the scripture app
[1:23:39] to teach patient that's the Master's use
[1:23:42] and it says and prepared unto every good
[1:23:46] work
[1:23:48] verse 22.
[1:23:50] so this is a pure it's a purging that
[1:23:52] that needs to be in our vessels as I
[1:23:54] said before vices
[1:23:57] um anger issues those things need to be
[1:24:00] purged because eventually they're going
[1:24:02] to come out
[1:24:03] unexpectedly like what happened to David
[1:24:05] that that was not the real David a
[1:24:08] spirit got a whole David hearken to that
[1:24:10] spirit and it took it it took him
[1:24:12] further than he wanted to go corruption
[1:24:14] happened in his life because it took him
[1:24:16] further than he wanted to go not even
[1:24:17] realizing it
[1:24:20] says flee also youthful lust but follow
[1:24:23] righteousness
[1:24:25] faith charity peace with them that call
[1:24:29] on the Lord out of a what Pure Heart
[1:24:33] pureness of your heart is so guess I
[1:24:34] said be open with God Pure Heart
[1:24:38] yeah I think it was the scripture says
[1:24:39] confess your faults one to another
[1:24:41] scripture even tells us that as well
[1:24:43] it's good to talk about certain things
[1:24:45] with brothers or sisters they can pray
[1:24:48] for you help you they can guide you
[1:24:50] encourage you lead you the direction
[1:24:53] that God wants you to go God can use a
[1:24:55] brother and sister to speak to you
[1:24:57] can't put God In The Box
[1:25:00] but foolish and I learned questions
[1:25:02] avoid knowing that they do gender
[1:25:05] strifes notice right here this one is
[1:25:07] the the word is calling us to be and the
[1:25:10] servant of the Lord must not strive but
[1:25:12] be gentle unto all men notice this at to
[1:25:16] teach so we all have a uh job we can
[1:25:20] teach one another by the way we live our
[1:25:22] lives we can help disciple one another
[1:25:25] because that's what the scripture is
[1:25:27] telling us right here it says apt to
[1:25:28] teach patience verse 25 and meekness
[1:25:32] instructing those that oppose themselves
[1:25:36] so when you when you're doing that
[1:25:38] you're helping restore somebody that's I
[1:25:40] believe that's the mini Ministry of
[1:25:41] reconciliation
[1:25:43] because people don't even recognize that
[1:25:45] they're opposing themselves and say if
[1:25:46] God pre-adventure will give them
[1:25:48] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[1:25:51] truth
[1:25:52] God could use you to speak something
[1:25:54] that will cause somebody to pray and
[1:25:58] soften their heart see God we're vessels
[1:26:01] that God has chosen he chose the
[1:26:03] foolishness of preaching for a reason
[1:26:05] and sometimes the holy spirit will
[1:26:07] strike you and and say this to this
[1:26:10] brother or sister and you want to make
[1:26:12] sure you hearken to that and not be
[1:26:14] disobedient like Saul was
[1:26:16] and look at the 26 what it says
[1:26:19] and that they may recover themselves out
[1:26:22] of the snare of the devil
[1:26:24] who are take the captain
[1:26:27] by him at his will
[1:26:30] read
[1:26:32] a couple more quotes on our clothes
[1:26:34] the question is an internal question
[1:26:36] what vices are you holding on to
[1:26:39] what things have we let lay dormant in
[1:26:42] our lives that we should have dealt with
[1:26:43] years ago
[1:26:45] there are things in our life we need to
[1:26:47] deal with right now
[1:26:49] instead of pushing off for later it's
[1:26:51] not gonna get worse David the great man
[1:26:53] made a mistake a man that for God's
[1:26:55] Gonna think about that a man that forgot
[1:26:57] his own heart yet took bathsheet but
[1:26:59] think he could hide the very thing from
[1:27:01] God he had served all his life but God
[1:27:03] exposed him by Nathan the prophet but
[1:27:06] yet look at Dave when he was going out
[1:27:07] exiled from his own people rejected King
[1:27:10] his own daughter had been ravaged by her
[1:27:12] brother and other brothers had killed
[1:27:13] him and there was Absalom that that
[1:27:16] raised up and separated the Army causing
[1:27:18] revolutions and David his own father was
[1:27:21] excommunicated taken away rejected by
[1:27:24] his people going out of the city a
[1:27:25] little crippled old fellow dragging
[1:27:27] along there making fun of him spinning
[1:27:29] on him the guard pulled his sword
[1:27:32] I'll I'll let that dog said stay on him
[1:27:35] spit on my king and David said let him
[1:27:37] alone God told him to do that
[1:27:40] this is from the church age I believe
[1:27:42] Church age book those fiery flaming eyes
[1:27:45] of Judge are even now recording the
[1:27:47] lives of All Flesh I want to just really
[1:27:49] just take this to Heart running to and
[1:27:51] fro throughout the Earth there is
[1:27:53] nothing he does not know
[1:27:54] he knows the desires of the heart that's
[1:27:57] why motive is so important
[1:27:59] when God just didn't bring the motives
[1:28:02] for this for any old reason but he
[1:28:03] brought up for the motive of we need to
[1:28:06] check our motives because if David would
[1:28:08] have checked his motive he wouldn't have
[1:28:10] been in his predicament so it behooves
[1:28:12] us to make sure to seek after to ask God
[1:28:16] God is this motive pure there's anything
[1:28:19] that's hidden agendas please make it
[1:28:22] known to me open my eyes to it because I
[1:28:24] don't want to do anything to displease
[1:28:26] you
[1:28:28] there's nothing hidden that should not
[1:28:29] be revealed for all things are naked
[1:28:31] before him with whom we have to do think
[1:28:33] of it he knows even now what you are
[1:28:35] thinking
[1:28:37] praise God he does
[1:28:42] life is too short just to be living with
[1:28:44] our vices our dis our bad decisions led
[1:28:47] to our advices in the first place notice
[1:28:49] that our bad decisions led to our vices
[1:28:51] in the first place so let's turn around
[1:28:53] by making a good decision
[1:28:56] we always get what we expect when people
[1:28:58] expect anything well they usually get
[1:29:00] what you look for it's the mental
[1:29:02] attitude that you have so you guys have
[1:29:04] the right mental attitude brother
[1:29:06] Brandon saying we had the right mental
[1:29:07] attitude to overcome these things in our
[1:29:09] lives to even to overcome it remember
[1:29:11] this and never forget it the right
[1:29:13] mental attitude towards any promise of
[1:29:15] God will bring it to pass the right
[1:29:18] mental attitude towards any promise of
[1:29:21] God it doesn't take Gifts of healing to
[1:29:24] heal the sick people
[1:29:26] uh any person here right now has a right
[1:29:28] to meet Satan anywhere if you're a
[1:29:30] Christian defeat him on any grounds he
[1:29:32] could stand up
[1:29:33] the fruit of our bad decisions can have
[1:29:35] long lasting impacts of Our Lives as we
[1:29:38] see David's that's why it's so important
[1:29:40] to self-examine the problem is we don't
[1:29:43] hold ourselves accountable for the bad
[1:29:46] decisions we need to analyze and to
[1:29:48] break down why we made the bad decision
[1:29:51] sister Shirley can come up if you would
[1:29:54] like and we'll close with Joshua 1 7.
[1:29:58] see we don't want to lose the joy of our
[1:30:00] salvation
[1:30:02] because you can
[1:30:05] I believe David lost that throughout the
[1:30:07] whole ordeal he and he asked God restore
[1:30:09] unto me
[1:30:11] and I can testify that this times in my
[1:30:13] life for I've lost a joy and I prayed
[1:30:14] for it and the lord gave it back to me
[1:30:17] he's faithful
[1:30:19] Joshua 1 7 and we will close
[1:30:21] let me get to it first myself
[1:30:30] so it says
[1:30:35] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:30:38] that thou mayest observed to do
[1:30:41] according to all the law which Moses my
[1:30:44] servant commanded thee turn not from it
[1:30:46] to the right hand to the left that thou
[1:30:48] mayest Prosper wherever thou goest we're
[1:30:51] going to read to verse 9. this book of
[1:30:54] the law shall not depart out thy mouth
[1:30:56] but Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:30:58] night so the word of God needs to be
