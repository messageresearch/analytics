in and look at it right we have a sign and we may take need of the heat of that sign and the reason the building collapsed or i'm assuming that we reason the building collapses because it wasn't built that good foundation but if you're not built a good foundation the foundation of christ will collapse so let's just pray for all them people and pray for all the people that aren't anchored in christ because they will collapse and we know where their destination lies if they don't accept christ for all our neighbors throughout the world throughout our our runs that we can just uh be christ to them

opportunity to be with you again want to greet you in the name of the lord say god bless each one of you i'm i'm especially happy to be here this morning because on the way here i had a little bit of vehicle trouble so pray for us on the way home tonight my other vehicle's in the shop so of course this is the one that's going to act up now how it always seems to go but by the grace of god we made it here kids are praying in the vehicle and things just started running just fine so it's kind of odd we're going to trust that that won't happen again today or hopefully ever so i apologize for being here a little later than i had wanted to but i'm glad that i'm here glad you're all here praise the lord and uh i tell you what uh let's just uh let's just go ahead and bow our heads forward of prayer this morning heavenly father lord that's the that's that's the attitude of my heart today i'm grateful to be here lord i think of all the places i could be not just today but in my life all the places i could have went all the way were decisions i could have made lord that you you guided me in my time of need father you directed me you kept me lord when i wasn't able to keep myself when i wasn't able to see two feet in front of me lord your little word was a lamp unto my feet and a light to my path and father we are standing here today in the name of the lord jesus christ beneficiaries not only of your grace but of your mercy as her brother was just saying father i how how i so thankful that that old hymn i just love it's one of my favorite songs great is thy faithfulness morning by morning new mercies i see lord i remember when i read the words of the weeping prophet jeremiah in the book of lamentations how it pricked my heart to think that lord even in our most humble our most distressed estate lord your mercies for us they're new every morning lord i can testify like david i would have fainted if i had not believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living father today we're here because you've ordained us to be here lord i believe it's for a purpose lord you do nothing in vain you never send your worth for your word forth in vain but it accomplishes that which pleases you and father i just pray you'd come bless now the ministering of the word and the inspiration thereof may be a help and a challenge and a directive to our lives in the hearts of these your children father get yourself great glory and honor in this place and we thank you for all things and i pray today when i go out when we go out from this place when we depart from this place we would never depart from your presence may the angel lord go before us and for not only me but for each one but you give them traveling mercies home today and wherever they'd be going within the next week father we commit all these things now into your hands as a loving and a faithful creator in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray and the church says amen if you turn to me this morning to the book of joshua the 24th chapter uh i had had plans to go a different direction and i you know i just this is kind of where i wound up um so just trusting the lord will work things out and he always does work things out for good and now i have a confession i must make all so i'm pretty sure i just wear this jacket for pretense at this point uh it serves no functional purpose in the middle of the summer i don't even i i just took it right it's like what's the point of wearing that so forgive me i'm not trying to be traditional or superstitious but we just want to put our best foot forward because this is the house of god we want god to see our earnestness and our sincerity josh for the 24th chapter and we're just going to start in verse 13. read all the way down to verse 28 joshua chapter 24 did i say 24 are we flipping their pages i don't know what i said there joshua 24 13 the bible says this and joshua's giving i for the second time won't read the whole chapter but he's given this exhortation about what god had done and how he brought abraham and isaac and jacob and how he had destroyed the egyptians and he destroyed the different inhabitants that had risen up against him in this land and verse 13 he says here and i says here and i have given you a land for which he did not labor amen in cities which he built not and ye dwell in them and of vineyards and olive yards which he planted not do ye eat he says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods that your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve now there's three classes here watch this whether the gods your father served which were on the other side of the flood talking about jordan or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the lord and the people answer now this is where i really want to go with this actually and the people answered and said like a good ecclesiastical group they all join in and well god forbid that we should forsake the lord and serve other gods for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and wish did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way where we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore we will also serve the lord for he is our god that's a pretty good evangelistical service amen but you'll notice the words of joshua in the next verse amen this isn't joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for he is a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn into you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you good and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord and joshua said unto people you are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you the lord to serve them and they said we are witnesses now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve in his voice will we obey so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in sacham and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the lord and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto you for it hath heard all the words of think about it the stone even heard it for it hath heard all the words of the lord which the lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance and may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated today and i'd like to take as a thought this text we will serve the lord amen and as i was mentioning a few moments ago joshua in this great exhortation at the end of the book of joshua he reminds the people and i want to remind you today that the goodness of god we know the goodness of god what it is because it's contrasted by his severity amen god was good to the people of israel in so much that he was terrible or dreadful to the enemies of the people of israel amen he had taken abraham out of a land and the seed after them he and you think about egypt the splendor of the nation of egypt and the greatness of pharaoh was all and all these great things and and god laid waste to everything that the greatest nation in the earth at that time and it'd actually be made wealthy by the people that were the very ones they put in bondage amen so a great nation a great army that pursued these people even until the after they left uh egypt and gaudy he lays the waste an entire army by the red sea amen they walk through the land of canaan and everybody that tried to impede or to harm them on the way there god dealt harsh with him so god was good to the people of israel in so much that he was harsh to the enemies of the people of god amen and joshua reminds him that even when the prophet balaam was minded to curse the people of israel god forbade the the madness of that prophet and caused him to bless israel amen so and i say this for a reason perhaps you're one of the few people in life that has enjoyed a lack of opposition in your life maybe you have no enemies maybe you've never encountered opposition if so you're probably not breathing you're like two years old but for the rest of us that are living breathing human beings that have ever done anything in your life at all somewhere in your life you've encountered opposition amen you know i i you talk to some people sometimes and they say well there's a guy he just doesn't have any enemies and i'm thinking well he's probably never stood for nothing amen well there's a guy just said have any image well listen how can you love your enemies if you ain't got any enemies in the first place you were not promised the lack of opposition you were not promised that everybody would like you or you would be well received by everybody invite you a promise that the world would hate you because they hated jesus listen joshua had enemies israel had enemies brother branham had enemies jesus had enemies listen if you stand for the right thing there's going to be an opposition every time you do that if you've come to church today expecting to believe this gospel to believe this message and not think that anybody's going to oppose you for it you're living in a daydream because somewhere in your life the enemy's gonna rise up and listen and sometimes they'll rise up maybe in your neighbors or family member or whatever and i want you to always remember that person is not the enemy but that spirit that's driving it is out he looks he's not out to make you feel bad some of us feel that and just thought well i'm not going to serve god anymore listen he's out to destroy you he's not to obliterate you and wipe your name and your testimony off the face of the earth but praise god the same god that led moses that led joshua through the wilderness out of egypt into a promised land he's the same god today through the message of the hour under the voice of the final messenger we are the final voice to the final age this voice has not spoken defeat over our lives quit speaking the devil's language we are not a defeated people we are not going down we're going up the call was to rise above the hour that we're living in well hallelujah praise the lord listen i want to encourage you whatever you're dealing with today whatever that enemy has told you and maybe he's told you're never going to make it maybe he's told you'll never be able to overcome maybe he's told you you'll never be able to live a normal life but i want to remind you what god did to his enemies back there and this mountain whatever's before you today this mountain is no different this uncircumcised philistine that's risen up against you he's no different than goliath [Applause] well praise the lord amen listen god has enemies sure does well he's the enemy of the pride he resists the proud well praise the lord i want to sit in church that way with a hearty heart a proud actor well i i know more about than the other guy and i'm the i'm the smarter this and i'm more spiritual than that and these people all a bunch of backslidden heathen devil pagans i tell you what watch out you'll make an enemy out of god i don't care if you're the most religious pious whatever you you get a haughty heart that god resists the proud but he gives grace unto the humble amen well that's in there for free i didn't put up my notes hey man listen joshua lays all this out like i'm laying it out to you says in light of what god has done for us i want you to realize what god has done for us to sit here in 2021 today we're looking at last year like oh man that was pretty bad listen god has brought his church through bubonic plagues and persecutions and and people getting fed to lions listen men want to put this bible in the language that you can read it so some pope somewhere couldn't dictate to you what it said men were burned at the stake and then present and tortured for you and i to be able to stand here today and believe this word of god god has made a way for us i can say like joshua said listen we've inherited things we didn't work for even heard the blessings we didn't labor for these things our eyes see things that kings and prophets desire to see jesus told his own disciples you've entered into other men's labors we are not here today our on our own we got prayer mohammed's and praying pastors and godly men godly women that have laid the foundation put footprints in the sands of time not just 20 years ago not just 50 years ago hundreds 200 thousands of years and above all that we've had a god the angel of the lord has made a way for us to be here today don't ever take that for granted amen amen because these people took it for granted justice i want you to choose you want to serve all them egyptian gods that our fathers dealt with for 400 years they left you in bondage they never did nothing for you anyway you've seen how their gods fell before our god why would you want to go back and serve them but choose you this day you can serve them or we've got some new guys we've got some new thing i'll get to this a little bit but we've got some things that are here they weren't over in egypt there's some certain gods in this land you could serve them too but i'll tell you what i'm going to do joshua says for me and my house we will serve the lord now listen you've probably heard this preached a lot of times and you've probably heard a lot of evangelists they'll come in and they'll say worry we'll serve the lord and the people get up on their feet we're going to serve god too praise god they're running the building we will serve the lord we're going to have a jericho march and we're going to shout well i'll tell you what joshua didn't know how to build his ministry i guess very well hey man he probably got advised how you should be preaching this stuff because he gets up there now i'm not here to discourage you today amen but he didn't get up there and do this like most people would oh i'm going to serve the lord us too he's like no you're not nope i don't think so no we will we see what god did we see these things we're testifying to god we will serve the lord that if you say so i mean i want you to consider what i'm saying for a moment because listen i i'm the the traveling evangelist and we expect me to come in here and preach like a house on fire and the people are getting excited and we're gonna feel good we're going to march on church today we will serve the lord we'll get a big old spirit on our back we'll blow the trumpet we'll go into walmart i'm going to serve the lord today i went to church this week praise god i'm a message believer well listen you're not the first one to walk at a church saying that they ain't serving the lord no more don't be that one amen you'd be the one that stays with it like joshua because we found out there was many people that day that testified we're just saying what the tapes say we're just saying what joshua said that's what joshua said we're saying that they were saying the same thing but it wasn't in their heart joshua's getting all he's preaching to the people he's preaching this text and they're getting excited we're going to serve god too and it just shuts them down no you won't amen well tell me something get me excited listen i'm not worried how excited you get today i'm worried about what kind of a life you live when you walk out of the building amen amen listen a lot of people can go around and that's like i had a brother one time trying to oh you should build your ministry and do this and that you got to get this following this that this isn't a good way to build a ministry i'm thinking well if the word of god can't build my ministry then i guess i don't need it it's like that man coming to brother bram said well your preacher is going to ruin your ministry he said if the word of god would ruin my ministry then i guess any any ministry that the word of god will ruin and he's run and that's just how i feel about amen i have to be able to preach this bible the way it was written by the same spirit that will break there goes my eyes well get rid of the frozen chosen here today amen that's how be able to preach this the way i prophet preach it and not have to feel bad or feel like i gotta compromise if you feel that way about it in your own life with whatever you're dealing with throw that thing out because that thing won't keep you in the promised land wait i see god started this he can finish it how he runs hey man oh my listen paul said if i am the servant how can i be a servant of christ and please men we've got too many men pleasers in the church today that's why the church is in the condition that it is listen everybody's looking around while everybody said we're going to serve god joshua's sitting there oh i'm going to serve god that don't mean anything you saying it doesn't mean anything you can go out of here and you can run and you can jump and you can shout but can you live it yeah man listen i man everybody's off listen i like encouraging people i like it when people get happy i do i like when people just worship and praise the lord but that's not what i live for you say what do you mean listen uh that doesn't save anybody by itself amen what i live for what my passion is is to see the sons and daughters of god walking in the glorious liberty that god has purchased for them amen there's a lot of people it's all right there's a lot of people that go to church and they can worship and they can shout but you look at their lives they're just as powerless and defeated and incapable as the next person amen their lives are so devoid of christ they look just like the world amen it doesn't matter how great we think church oh man we had a great service today what did it do in your life and listen don't put that on the preacher that might be listen joshua wasn't the one that was wrong he had a different spirit than everybody else joshua was some backslid preacher somewhere well if joshua just equipped me and give me what i need man he doesn't give you everything god give you everything don't put on joshua now listen joshua might have been the only one there that said we will serve the lord that did it amen listen you've got to make up your mind somewhere you've got to establish in your heart somewhere if nobody else in this building mommy and daddy and wife and husband kid if nobody else wants to serve god i'm gonna serve god joshua wasn't saying to get everybody on board he was letting him know where he stands whether he give him the option listen you serve who you want i'm still going to serve god it's not a bunch of group psychology this is not a bunch of fanaticism and a bunch of work up i'm going to serve god my house is going to serve the lord whether anyone else does or not amen i'm saying this for a reason amen like i said us just saying it doesn't mean anything i can sit here and tell you you're the chosen bride of jesus christ we're all going to go to heaven this church we're all going to see jesus and we can all agree with it and that doesn't mean anything by itself i'm not doing anything different than any other sort of evangelical or pentecostal church doing that it doesn't praise the lord amen listen you look at some of the most influential some of the biggest ministries in this message and where are some of them today where did they go amen where did they go listen at some point they were all well we will serve the lord every one of them said that they all started out with the best of intentions listen i have no doubt these people here testifying had the best intentions to serve god they probably really thought they meant it but yet we find out one gen marvel when i first read this bible it just astonished me as a young man one generation later hey man not hundreds of years or two literally mommy and daddy that watched the sun stand still but watch the moon hang over a valley that watched hell flow from heaven watch jericho fall one generation later they were serving other gods and i just said nothing i didn't disbelieve the bible i'm just like man it's astounding to me it could change that much in 40 years but listen i got saved back in in 2006. hey man and this is 2021 and you look at our just american society now look at how much our culture and our society and their attitude towards all this perversion and all this nonsense and all its politics i thought it was bad back then you looked at how much has changed in 15 years don't tell me it's not the same thing listen the devil is so sure to pull the rug right out from you when you're standing on it if you let him amen we've got to know more than just an intellectual conception we've got to know in our hearts that god has done something for us he has put us in this promise whether it's popular or unpopular whether it's profitable or unprofitable hallelujah somebody listen well this isn't even my sermon anymore praise the lord listen where did we the church as the people get their place we can't make a sacrifice unto god anymore people don't want to come and serve god people don't want to come and go to church or do anything unless it benefits them somehow where's the man of god where's the woman of god says i'll lay down my life for the people of god i don't care what it costs me i'm not here to get something i'm here to give something lord i'm willing to lay down my life for the gospel of jesus christ you're in the purchase amen you're not just the blood you're the purchase of the blood god thought you were so important that he give the blood of his only begotten son at calvary for you and a man i've got to send the pulpit and he'll try to hypnotize he'll try to work people over with a bunch of psychology that's the blood of jesus christ god forbid that i should manhandle the purchase of this possession i tell you what it's like i said their brother the other day i said you know it'd be one thing i wouldn't rob the bank one thing one one thing if i called you up and i said hey you want a free cruise just give me your credit card number i've never understood that why do you need my credit card for three we got man you get them like six times a week anymore tell you what everybody's out for your money everybody's out for your information including churches lots of times and then everybody's having to get something from me amen i said it's bad enough everybody's trying to scam you nowadays but to do it in the name of the lord jesus christ where is the fear of god that's what paul says in remember they lost the fear of god hallelujah the fact that a man can stand up while i'm way off the beaten path now to think that a man of god could stand the pulpit having read this bible and do these things like don't you fear the god of this bible i didn't already love him so much i should be afraid of him they have to answer for that on the day of judgment well glory to god i don't know what that's all about but you keep that one amen listen i'm not here today to tell you like joshua you can't make it i'm not here to discourage you you can't serve god that's not what i'm saying but what i'm saying is if you tell me i'm going to serve the lord that doesn't mean anything by itself lots of people tell you they're serving god but they're serving their own belly amen so i don't want to just say it today i want to live it i want every moment of my life and every fiber of my being to testify of this resurrection in my life under dark denominationalism out of sin and trespasses out of my own hang-ups and my own inability god has quickened me from death and to life see it doesn't do anything if i just convince you listen if i can talk you into it somebody else can talk you out of there i mean now if somebody can talk to you if somebody talked you into this you're in a bad place because somebody can talk you out of it you have to have the revelation joshua's revelation was no good just in joshua you've got to have it in yourself and that's like brother i tell you it's like that pro the hotbed plan we talked about i mean we don't need some hot bed plants in the church today we got to sit here and water them and baby them and pet them and put them just a certain kind of light every day and we gotta just follow them i tell you what there's a few feet away brother bram said there's a plant right there it wasn't no hybrid it might not have looked as pretty as the one the flower box it didn't matter how hot it was or how dry it was or if nobody else wanted to go to church he was there and he was alive that hot dead plant might look good but he couldn't take five minutes of what that natural seed could take don't ever let the world sell you short you say well i'm not this and i'm not that i don't look like the world praise god amen listen our lord jesus didn't come that way with a bunch of glitz and glamour it was despised and rejected a man there was no beauty in him so if you don't look like the rest of the world we're hot pretty good no thank god you're built to handle the pressure i think about this how many times brother read him on tape he talks about the rapture he says it's not going to be a lot of people it'd be just a few people missing amen now listen people hear that they get discouraged well i might there might just if there's going to be just a few people that get discouraged and what's brother ram saying now that's not the right attitude it's just the parable he says it might be one saved in jeffersonville they see it's a parable he says there might be thousands of saved i don't know he says but here's the way i want to believe it i'm that one josh we didn't say hey or joshua hey man let me say it that way didn't say hey we're all gonna make it but he said if anybody's gonna make it i'm gonna make it no that's not for you to look at everybody else in the church say sorry you're not gonna make it right that's not what he's saying but if one if only one is gone i'm that one and brother said if your faith doesn't say that there's something wrong with your faith he says you're not sure what you're doing see them people they weren't sure what they were doing well yeah i mean we're gonna we're gonna serve god are you amen see joshua had a different spirit to them see joshua understood the power of a true token he sought that night in the passover amen when he put the blood over the door and the lint told his house amen he watched the death angel pass over his house amen listen when he come into the jet when he come into the they said when he sent spies rather into the promised land 40 years afterwards and then two spies come back and they said there's a woman in jericho she should give a safe haven and they marched around jericho for seven days and on the seventh day they marched around seven times and they shouted and when those walls come down joshua noticed there was a little bit sticking up and then someone look listen that's you you're excited about that joshua said i thought the whole thing was going to come down no that's right there was a promise made there was a promise made by spies that her house would stand and everybody knew there was a token amen a little piece of the wall with a little scarlet ribbon flooding in the wind it probably looked ridiculous when they were being besieged here's some ill-famed woman listen she wasn't some general she wasn't some priestess she wasn't you know what she was but she had a token on display that token on display spared her when every other what listen structurally that don't even make sense they were just praying earlier about that building that fell down in florida listen this giant stone wall thing of the ramparts fell down why is there a little piece stained up there's a little scarlet ribbon hanging outside [Music] listen there's no virtue in the ribbon they'd probably be used for all kinds of things but the promise behind it the word by them two boys was a true token unto her listen joshua understood the power of token listen let me tell you about the power of a token your faith says if there's one household that's gonna make it it's my i've got a token you say brother listen all kinds of people preach about a token but here's the difference between you and the rest of jericho you've got to have your token on display hey man unless a lot of people say we'll serve god she put her token out let's not just say we're going to serve god let's put it on display that's not what we say it's what we live so all the people who quote moses they could all quote joshua they'd all been listen they'd all been given promises by god for their own possession now i talked about adoption a little bit last time this ties in adoption too what is adoption it's the placing of a son over authority in his own household is that right hebrews chapter 3 tells us that moses was faithful in his house as a servant but christ as a son over his house amen see why the swat brother said you see why the totem couldn't be preached until the evening time there had to be some sons and daughters of god with the authority to put a token over the house i mean because they put on a token over your house you can't just be a servant you've got to be a son you've got to be a dog you've got to have authority today amen it's not the magoulas household or the martin household it's the house of god today listen i put my own family ideas and my own traditions over the word of god i'm gonna be just like the rest of that rubble but you take this gospel and you take this message and you devote your life to this and you seek god i don't care what kind of a house you come from i don't care what your tax bracket looks like you put god first and everything and god will take care of you amen listen joshua tells these guys they're not going to serve god and even tells them why think about that he's already letting the cat out of the back he's not like leaving it out there or something's gonna happen you know when and within 40 days something might happen possibly to you no he lets him know listen all these other gods are going to be a snare to you if you don't drive them all out listen they were they were commissioned each one of those tribes was commissioned like we are today to take full possession of their inheritance amen every promise in the book is mine amen not just the ones that you think are are conceivable or possible with god all things are possible listen i can't explain a body change to you i can explain how divine healing works but i know it works i've seen him in action god said it i believe it that settles it amen we're not here today to try to understand the science behind it we're here to take possession if god promised to be a token in the evening time there's got to be somebody who says that token's on display in my life if god said i'm going to have a perfect church without spot or blemish there's got to be somebody somewhere who says it don't matter what the rest of these people do it doesn't matter what they say i'm a member of the body of christ i'm going to fulfill my purpose listen god did just give him that land for no reason there was a purpose in it you're not here today just to feel good and go to church and be seen and hurt again you will have been called every day of your life from here on out to fulfill a purpose to take possession of everything god has put into your hand amen now here's what happens to them here's where they get distracted they all begin to compromise somewhere you read through the first and second chapter of the book of judges before this great uh i guess falling away is a good way to put it actually right before all they all start to go away where what happens they go into the land you know ephraim goes over here and dan goes over here and god goes over here and and and they all go to these different lands and they get there and they meet these inhabitants and they happen to say you know what tell you what we'll give you some money if you let us keep part of the possession right well we'll compromise we'll be your buddy if you let us be selling up for money and popularity and things every one of them compromises and they don't take full position of their inheritance and when they fail to take full possession what happens the gods of those inhabitants not the gods of egypt the gods of those inhabitants become a snare unto them the bible says see he told them he joshua had told them to moses told him go in and fully possess the land why when you go in there i want you to take their altars and take their idols and take their dots and utterly cast them down and destroy them i'm going somewhere now listen when you fail to take the full possession of what god has given us in this age you're letting devils come in you're letting idols come and you'll let something come in that will steal your testimony it'll steal your joy it'll steal your peace it'll steal everything from you the very inhabitants that they fail to destroy become a snare to their children right how many times i've seen it in the message and even outside not even just christian homes even just natural homes the sins of the father that get passed on to the children listen i don't know what your daddies and mommies are dealing with here today but listen to things you don't get under control you're just going to pass it on if you're not careful amen it's time to put the devil under hill today let's not compromise let's not wait for somebody else to get it done you've got a job to do you get your house in order you build a family altar you get before the lord and you mean business with god drive out every enemy we got too many idols in this message trying to look around and steal from the people what god has ordained for them now there's a story in the book of judges and uh this story's always been interesting it's in chapter 17 18. maybe you're familiar with it but there's a man there in the uh he was in mount ephraim there's a man there mount ephraim and he had a bunch of idols his mom he'd saved up some money for him bro bruce you know this story he's laughing already it's like i know where this is going he had a bunch of gold and silver mama had laid up said you know we've reserved this for jehovah so he goes and he makes a bunch of idols in his house he has a whole room in his house full of idols like some message believers he's got a whole room in his house full of different idols and all these other gods and he said i've got all these for jehovah apparently he wasn't familiar with what moses said that moses put a commandment somewhere in there by not having false idols and graven images and worshipping other gods but but whatever i'm not this he did it all for the lord isn't it amazing what people will do for the lord and i wouldn't rub this bank for the lord then i wouldn't marry another woman for the lord we've got some sort of special revelation but it don't mess joshua and don't match moses but you know what he did he said you know what there's a levite come down that way one day a levi a man that was called to do the work of a priest come by his house one day and he said hey i tell you what if i pay you i'll give you some money and some clothes i give you some food you come down be my priest in my house and that leave i said i'll do that for that much and the man at the end of judges 17 his response is made he says now he says now i know the lord will bless me seeing i have a levite to a priest think about this think about this i've got all kinds of idols i've got all kinds of ungodly nonsense in my house but it's for the lord and i found me a preacher to preach it the way i like if i pay him that way and i set him up i'll he'll preach whatever i want well listen there's only one problem with this preacher if you can pay to preach one way somebody else can pay him to preach another way here comes dan the next chapter they're not satisfied with what god gave them they're not satisfied with their inheritance so they march on down to my nephron and down there they come across this house and this buttered up leave like this this backslidden preacher they'd find him down there in the house and out in the mountains from and they said hey tell you what we really like these idols we want to take them he says well no no listen i'm getting paid really good to take care of this guy's idols and be his priest so tell you what we'll we'll up the offer we'll let you be a priest to our whole big mega church we've got a whole city we're going to set up we want these idols you come down you're going to be he's like man i'm going to be a big time big time preacher i'm going to preach the whole tribe a day amen that's what happens with a salad he'll find somebody offers a better price this guy had all them idols in his house and everything else had a priest lost it all yeah now i'm telling this story for a reason besides just the very clever analogies of course dan takes these idols and he goes down and then he sets up he actually named the city dan they set this up eve from and dan they've got these idols and if you're familiar with what brother ben preaches in the the seventh seals and the church he book these two names are eventually they're blotted out from under heaven because god made a promise that if you would serve these eyes he would blot your name out from under heaven amen when you go to the book of first kings the 12th chapter when the kingdom of israel splits off from the kingdom of judah in the time of the kings king jeroboam he sets up his own religion and he puts two idols up and i want you to see where he puts them up at he puts them in dan and he puts them in ephraim because those same spirits that had been there for hundreds of years were still in the family still operating the same day and once you notice what his purpose in doing this was jeroboam said i'm going to set these idols up here in israel with dan and ephraim because i don't want the people to go back to jerusalem because if they go back to jerusalem and worship they'll turn their hearts back towards jerusalem listen satan is trying to stop you today trying to stop people and message churches from turn their hearts back according to malachi 4. what's he done he set up idols idols in their lives to distract them the carriage of this world and the things of this world trying to keep us from serving god see he's afraid like jeroboam's afraid he's afraid if you ever turn back to the faith of your fathers he's afraid if you ever get a real revelation this message listen he knows he knows amen well praise the lord let me say this real quick let me just drop this in here i was telling this testimony the other day listen i we had these uh these these healing services over in defiance ohio a couple weeks back and i got done preaching on friday night and there was one sister already got touched in the service and we have a bunch more testimonies from that that i won't get into but i got in the car when i was done and i started driving home and i went five minutes down the road and the enemy come to me in the car and i thought well this ought to be good i just love these these wonderful conversations we always have and what's always funny is they don't end well for him so i don't know why he does this but he comes in the car like he's probably done to some of you and he comes in the car and says you know what you're just getting the people worked up you don't really believe in this and god doesn't do that anymore and you're just getting people excited he says you know what you're a hypocrite you don't believe any of that stuff and it just struck me i answered them back and said even if that weren't true i know one person that was there tonight that believes it you hallelujah amen is that right listen the devils believe and they tremble that's why where the rams had when the weakest christian the weakest christian goes on these the devils tremble why because even when you're not sure you and you're not sure if you believe it the devil believes it listen jeroboam was afraid he knew if the people ever believed it he wouldn't be able to stop him listen that's where you and i are today the devil believes this maybe more than some of you that's why he's so afraid that's why he fights church that's why he fights the message he believes it he knows if you ever get a true revelation of who the church is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works you will be an invincible army i don't care if you're 80 convinced or 50 convinced he is 100 convinced that's why he fights you i want you to know when you don't believe in yourself and you don't think you can make it another day god believes in you and the devil believes in you everybody else believes in you but you it's the truth jeremiah believed in what they're that's why he fought it so much i don't want him to go back there and say we get a real touch from god they'll never come back to me so it is today amen i said well that's all idols and this that what's that gotta do with anything listen according to the book of revelation in the 13th chapter that first beast fell there'd be a second beast rise on the earth now i'm not preaching vaccines and stuff we're not all we know what the message says hopefully about how the mark of the beast amen they better throw that disclaimer in there but listen when that second beast rises what is it civil and ecclesiastical power out of this country i think that's a buffalo one place amen this country america the land of the free the home of the brave has raised up a system raised up an image under the first beast raised up out of our ship that catholic it's just the same spirit some i can't remember i was talking to you about this while back one of my kids was talking about a certain church and i think it was a charismatic church or something and they asked me what kind of church it was and i said catholic i meant to say charismatic i said well same thing anyway it's just different forms of the same it's all antichrist it's all antichrist she's got daughters she's got lots of children they're full of blasphemous names but it's all satan and this church this country rather with all that god has blessed it with and all that god is allowed to do yet it's raised it's raised up idols like we've never had before there's been idols in every age there's always been an idol worship there's always been deceivers but this is an age of spiritual idolatry that's why brother bran could preach god this evil age it was in this age that he was called the god of this age anointed once in the end time brother bran he tells you what it is janice and jamborees listen we've always had impersonators there's always been impersonators but there's again and jamboree's at this end time what's the difference he said they are reprobate concerning the face [Music] amen not just faith not just the bible not just prayer in school they are reprobate concerning the faith what is the faith the message is the voice so we're not talking about what's floating around out here somewhere in there it's just down the street somewhere we're talking about in the message well praise the lord listen there's all kinds of stuff that calls yourself god all kinds of nonsense in the message we always see we do this group thing like like we want to do with joshua what pray god word the message is it was the message in you here's the question is the message in you look there's a lot of things that want to hang out listen wherever god is wherever satan's at or wherever god is that's where satan wants to be he's not content to be second fiddle he wants a kingdom just like gods he wants worship just like god he wants to be that's like the sons of god he wants everything you got listen that's why he fights you that's why he's jealous of you you've got everything he wants you've got an inheritance you've got no spirit are the provided place of worship god has put his name not in this building not in the temple in you you've got everything he wants that's why he fights you so much so janice and jamborees they're manifested in this hour because this is the hour the faith is present amen not false jesus says false christs doing miracles working signs and wonders and absolutely a hundred percent the devil now brother bam ties us in uh another end time he ties it into janus and jamboree's the three angels that went down two of them right two went down to sodom is that right and they blind to the people now he tells you that it's billy graham or roberts these great servants of god these great men for all they did yet blind is actually idolatries dead in these from all over again it's actually blind to the people what is it it's three seeds we're planted yes denomination was planted pentecost is planted but praise god we are standing here today we are believing this day because god took a man a kentucky hillbilly god took a little ignorant man with a 7th grade education and by the voice of that prophet the word was sowed as well listen we don't gotta saw it today it's already been sold it's the harvest time the work sorry then let's partake in what god's laid out for us when you see the denominational spirits these pentecostal spirits try to come into the message it's like dollar tree yes right it's the same thing and listen your name will be blotted out from listen listen we've not just got a natural promise what's the book of revelation says that if you add to this i will add to you the plagues of this book if you if you take away from this word if you take away from this message i will take your name out of the book of life and your place in the holy city so i i that's why i'm saying all this i'm very serious about this we we don't take these things seriously enough we're worried about the guy like i said earlier calling us on the phone trying to take our money worried about the guy that's trying to you know reevaluate our tax bracket we're worried about all that stuff what we should be worried about is when it tries to come right into our homes and our lives and our devotional and our prayer life we've got idols trying to creep in it's time to stroll out god did not ordain you to put them in the closet got another name for you to buy a storage unit and store them there until the market goes up and you got a good prices i hope you go on i know hope you know where i'm going don't take this too i'm trying to be carnal but and then we sit there and we pet and baby these things in our life get rid of it throw it out it's never done you any good that idol has never spoken back to you he has never helped you once throw up destroy him take full possession god promised a sinless virtuous bride in the end that's you and i what my feelings and my opinions and this and that you know we we got this thing nowadays safe spaces you know i'm gonna go this college i know what my feelings be heard i gotta go to my safe space there's no safe spaces in the tribulation there's nowhere safe on the face of the earth from judgment listen they will cry for death they will cry for the mountains upon them and they won't be able to find it and now are safe from the wrath of god your feelings don't matter on the day of judgment your opinions your ideas your upbringing your every excuse none of those excuses hold any water on the day of judgment you know why they want to make safe spaces because the world's dangerous well we need that we do that for thousands of years perilous times shall come men are lovers of the middle self disobedient unthankful unholy incontinent fierce truth makers disobedience to parents despisers of those that are good lovers of pleasure and more than lovers of god notice they love god oh they love god they go to church oh thank god he allowed me to live a simple life in 2021 what kind of god do you serve anyway they love god they just love their pleasures more god didn't call you to live some sort of a sinful life but god loves you so much you're not going to leave you're in that condition oh my god loves me you're god's your belly and the devil my god changed me from the ground up listen when god got a hold of my life hallelujah god got to hold my life he didn't put a band-aid oh we're all just bleeding out there wasn't enough band-aids in the world to fix what i had going on there wasn't enough science and psychology and medicine to help me but i found one when i made my bed in hell he was there he brought me out of the maori clay he set my feet on this rock [Applause] he put me here today i didn't bring myself here joshua didn't bring himself there the angel the lord the captain of the host of god has brought us here god's done too much for me god's done too much for you to just walk away from it i know god said this but i mean i died die we need less eye and more die in the church let's guard ourselves let's guide our own ideas brother braham says in all ages of the sea from the garden of eden all the way down there's never been an age so deceptive as this age we just leave that in the pentecostal church and the good old methodist church and the good old catholic church you're out of your mind wake up we get to the place we preach it that way well they down there and awesome first of all brother brown was never against people he was against the systems that put him there because the system bound them listen if whatever you're in i don't care what it calls itself and call it's a message it can cause some of the biggest ministry in the world if it's binding you it's not god god did not come to bind you god come to set you free if you're not free today it's because you let the devil bind you somewhere the man of god the word of god has not come to bind you what is it the bible says while they promise liberty they are the servants of corruption we want to go on about america and oh it's deceitfulness and politics and it's filthy and it is don't don't mistake me it is you could put an abraham lincoln and a george washington in every county in this country it's still not coming back well praise the lord i don't usually get into politics here but it's like the last president that we had not this one the last one we had he was a businessman he gets elected and all these politicians that left they're all worried well you know he's a businessman he he's just gonna use his office to make money i thought oh like you all did yeah right that's right that's right oh you're just sad that he has a business listen not one of them persons that's in office came in there with the money they walk out with they all got filthy stinking rich off of politics we're going to send money to this foreign country you all need money we'll send it over here because they know they'll get it back at election time when it's time to start oh man all the i love all these foreign countries they hate our guts send money to our campaign finances in this super pac listen they're not out to help you they're not here to help you they're here to rob you and listen to the man the god stands in the pulpit and he puts you in bondage and he's fleecing you he's taking the message and using it for himself he's not here to help you he's here to rob you that's why the thing comes he don't come to leave your calling card and a couple cookies come to steal and kill and destroy but jesus said i have come that you might have a life in it abundantly brother ram says this false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elect see now really watch this next statement he's a sea now just a good a cold formal starchy churches and so forth of man-made theology that won it the elect would never pay no attention to that he said it's almost like the real thing what are you saying brother we we put that off on well they're just cold and they're starch in the dogmatic we're not like them we're not deceived huh is this it's like i had a brother one time he was complaining to me about a certain church said well they're just a formal cold church down there they're just so formal they're not real messes they're formal churches so well maybe they're better off what do you mean brother i said well i'd rather be cold than lukewarm [Music] they might be cold but what are you listen if you're just lukewarm you'd be better off being cold or hot if you're lukewarm he'll spew you out of his mouth obviously we should be hot but listen we can see her well they're just cold and formal that don't mean anything here they're better off we get in the very mouth of god and we're just we're just religious enough to be miserable we've got just enough religion to hate our lives we've got just enough god about us to say man something's wrong but i'm going to keep doing what i'm doing anyway well if you always do what you always did you'll always get what you always got it astounds me man i'm all over the place it astounded me how people sit in church for 20 30 40 years can't ever get to victory can't overcome can't ever seem to get their head above water and they just keep going on the way we're just going to keep who will the lord this and look man i tell you what why don't you do what the bible says well praise the lord this one one of my fair to call to pet peeve if there's like 50 different things that bother you i guess not it's one of the many things that bothers me you got people come to you oh lord forgive me you have people come to you and they're like well i've got this problem and i can't get over this i don't know what to do brother john you could probably relate to this well brother the bible says this and the message says this well yeah i know but i just need to pray about it what does that pray about go do what he says listen i didn't have to get up this morning pray well lord should i go should i go rob the kwik-e-mart down here you know lord should i go shoplifting should i go cheat on my wife lord what do you think about i don't need to pray about that all right that's wrong oh i'm gonna pray about it listen muslims pray hindus pray but when we pray ought to be in faith how can you have faith for some contrary to his will [Applause] they're just cold and formal down there listen we know what this message says we know what the prophet has testified we know this bible said if our life doesn't look like this there's something wrong that's not god's fault that's not your brother's fault there's one person that's got a responsibility to fix that i'd rather be cold than lukewarm well anyhow brother graham says this this doesn't be certain of god we may not think that we are idol worshipers but we are and the government endorses it boy if that ain't the truth yeah that's a whole nother sermon we'll get into today the government endorses it people today are idol worshipers because they worship idols some of them worship movie stars for idols some worship money for idols and some worship television stars as idols but all that you put before god as an idol let it be whatever it may be and a lot of people like that quote they stop right there but you read the very next paragraph he says even to satan our great adversary is such a smart one until he puts even sometimes the church of god the church before god yes right you might have a great church it may be a great building it may be a great denomination again it may be a great congregation but let nothing come before god in your heart anything in before god is an idol amen listen your church not this church hopefully but i mean listen no one's immune to this i'll just say it this way you're not immune because you're sitting in a certain congregation that's a judas walk with jesus the best preacher the most holy man listen that don't make anything well i got a great preacher i got a great church you can worship that before god listen if you believe your church over the word of god it's an idol but the man tells you what is in the i think it's the indictment he talks about this that's what they did with barabbas they they chose a murderer over the word of life hey man they bleached with the i i had a bible study here with some young people here a couple weeks back i made this point i said we go to a message church you hear people preach you say oh we leave the message listen there's all kinds of nonsense all around the world that calls itself a message they this guy's christ this and this and that eighth and ninth and tenth day and whatever else and all this polygamy and everything else it all calls itself message they all believe what's preached that's what's wrong they ought to believe what god says if it's contrary listen if i get up here if i get up here and i preach something new contrary throw it out your soul is not worth my opinion [Applause] my feelings yours whoever it is let every man's word be a lie and let god's be true i say amen so sick of this wishy-washy church going blah blah blah listen we're christians we're supposed to be tough we're running we're not the hotbed plant we aren't able to stand here when nobody else wants to and states the truth anyhow listen if your favorite preacher can move you off the word of god you've got an idol in your life if your church and your idea and your doctrine move you off you've got an idol in your life if your christian experience is limited to a four-walled building you've made an idol out of your church you know why so many people like going to church because they can't be the church that's what it is we we like the experience of going here oh we had a great oh it was just so wonderful listen i wasn't called to go to church i'm called to be the church now you still go to church because that's what the church does listen we're not imitating them they're imitating us we're ordained to this where are they called out we're more than the court we've entered in we're the bride of jesus christ it's like i think wigglesworth said he said the reason most people don't see jesus it's because christian people aren't filled with jesus they're satisfied he said this is that's the real cases now they are satisfied to attend weekly meetings read the bible occasionally pray infrequently now you've got a lifeless powerless church he said their lives they're so parallel and to the world till they look no different where'd your token go you looked like everybody else somebody stole your secret samson somebody stole your secrets but it is you give it away some delightless somewhere i had well he's not here so i can tell the story i had to i had to meet with a brother here a few several days back and he's you know he's got he's got family and different ones and stuff and he's been struggling his life he's one of these he's one of these roller coaster christians and i got up and i looked him in the face and said here's the problem with you brother i said you fear men more than you fear god and then you fear men when you fear god that's why all this insecurity and all this not that's why that bothers you well this person said this and this person said that and i don't know which way to believe i said you fear men too much if you fear god you put god first listen if you can stand before god there's not a man can stand before you i said put god first i asked him this this has been my hobby horsely i said i asked him i said what's your family altar look like i said well i said i don't really have one so to speak i said well that'd be a good place to start it astounds me well you say this is real simple what i mean b because nobody does it hardly not many people do it but it astounds me how many families in this message in the message is this all right i'm a preacher i mean if he says no i'm still gonna preach it again why did i even ask it astounds me no i'm being serious now though it astounds me how many families in this message don't have any sort of a family altar i'll see their kids i'll talk them and say hey we're gonna maybe they come over we're gonna pray tonight what are you doing i'm like we do this every night this is not something we do this is who we are right now listen we it astounds me how moms and dads they don't take time to read with their children they don't take time to pray even in their own lives let alone with their children and then they and they're like i just don't know why my kids are interested in god why don't they want to serve god i'm like well they learned it somewhere that's not everybody i understand different i'm not but i'm saying so many times we are guilty of doing them a disservice listen if we want to serve god let's show them what it means brother graham said you want closer to god what do you do read your bible and pray yes every day that's right brother that's easy well then if it's so easy why do so many people struggle with it it astounds me what goes on in message churches message churches stuff that goes on i'm thinking do people even read their bibles anymore we ought to instantly be able to say wait that's not the scripture that's not the but that's not what a prophet said brother branham said this no he didn't right listen you gotta study the message a little bit too listen to types say man it's telling me how many times i've heard the preacher well brother rem said this it's like the opposite of what he actually said but okay and everybody amen i've sat in services well praise the lord i've sat in services and every like i talked about with joshua brother i'm like that's all that's completely contrary to the word of god what is it we're not seeking god like we used to we're letting some man do it for us listen that's no different than what they did with moses we'll just speak to moses we don't want to hear from god we're going to talk about nicolaitanism and all this others who put the people who put moses in that position the people i think was john calvin said that god gives wicked people wicked rulers now you know why americans are present today they heat for themselves teachers listen they want to hear something they got exactly what they wanted it's exactly the devil the world goes to church the world loves god i just love pleasure more uh i'm building this all to a reason what's different between joshua and everybody else there's got to be a difference between us and the rest of the world that's what i want you to key on today i've been coming to this point and i was talking about this with adoption there's there's different things in an adopted or mature son that god is looking for but i want you to look at jesus life and joshua's life jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me amen it was god's purpose what makes us different than the rest of the world hopefully there's a separate line and it's this that's this word devotion amen i'm talking about doing devotions the word devotion is an interesting word to me amen because until you let christ take full possession of you you can be a good church member right you you can you can do all these things and you can receive accolades of men you can get rewards just the pharisees did that remember to be a prisoner to the word and will of god that's a devotion amen listen what was god's purpose in this hour to get preeminence in a people what is preeminence it means to have first place listen you can give god second place and third place and fourth place and he'll take whatever you give him because he's a gentleman but is there someone here says i'll give him first place no matter what now i've got four young adults i'm raising up and all the time i'm trying to instill in this idea of responsibility because like you know nobody has it today our generation is not being raised to be responsible and so i'm always talking you need to be responsible you've got responsibility be a man be a woman you've got responsibility but here's what i want you to catch devotion is greater than just responsibility amen we have many responsibilities as adults amen but devotion goes beyond the idea of responsibility even amen devotion carries with the idea of responsibility but not always the other way around amen and this is why i'm saying this is very easy in our lives as christians to replace one with the other we take our devotion to god our devotion our passion for worship and god and his purpose and just becomes a job to us listen many preachers listen i've been to this place before where you're not careful you stand in this pulpit it just becomes a job well i guess i got to go do it again that's just what i'm supposed to do god never let this become just a responsibility to me i am responsible for it but i want to be more than responsible i want a devotion to it listen there's nothing wrong with responsibility now amen there's nothing wrong with a sense of duty but devotion goes further than that amen listen i am responsible as an adult to pay taxes i'm not devoted to it i'm not passionate about the idea of handing money over to a government that has no idea what they're doing with it i don't sit there and go to the store and pay seven and a half percent sales i say praise god i'm so grateful that the government knows how to spend my money better than me thank god i've got an electric bill coming i love paying bills i love taking camera i love eating properly because of my health i've got all kinds of responsibilities you've got all kinds of responsibilities but don't ever let god don't let your purpose be just a responsibility listen my bills come every month i don't jump up and say the bills are here today it's the 15th time to make no i'm thankful i have a house i'm thinking i'll have electricity but listen i'm not excited i don't wake up with this burning passion when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head down like i love paying bills i love taxes i don't don't want nothing to do with that listen we're going somewhere not to do all this stuff anymore praise god for that listen this kingdom of god is more than my responsibility it's my passion it's my devotion all these men i write about the beginning they were responsible but they didn't get something different about joshua there's something different about these men that i talked about there's something different about the real believer they're devoted when you're devoted you'll make sacrifices hey man you say i ain't got time to read my bible and pray you'll make time so when i was a sinner i found time to do all the things i wanted to do if i didn't have the money i found the money if i didn't have the time i found the time this is my passion this is my devotion i don't care if i'm going to miss a meal let me serve god i got a wife back here and i'd like to be able to say i hope i hope this is this is my testimony hey man i love my wife and i'm responsible here but i want to be more than just responsible for my wife and devoted to my wife devoted to my children listen that's why so many men they get to be 40 50 whatever they get in the middle of age they have a midlife crisis they used to love their lives they used to be devoted to her but after a while the cares of life and day-to-day living set in they're just responsible now it's just a burden they just see the burden they don't see the joy they don't see the unfailing realities anymore it's just a responsibility it's just a burden all we want to do is get rid of it we go trade her in for a new model they do this they do that all kinds of crazy stuff why somewhere in their life the thing that used to be devoted to they lost the joy of it hey man listen i've got a responsibility in my wife and kids but i want more than that i want to be devoted i want them to look at my life and say that daddy really cares about me he's a real husband he's a real daddy he wants what's best for me even if it costs him when paul goes to mars hill he sees these greeks the bible says he beheld their devotions amen see where your real passion is that's where your devotion is it's the same thing i was talking to a brother a while back and his son was trying to learn chats and he's really good at chess and i was playing with him and i used to play a lot of chess and he's like oh you should go to tournament you should play chess i said well i said i appreciate that i said though i said uh i'm i'm good at chess but i'm not real great at it and i told him this and the reason is is i don't love to play chess i like to play chess i get bored with it after about three games like well we're not doing this for three more months you know what i'm saying i don't have a you look at a man that even in the natural that excels at a job or a sport or whatever he's got a drive or a passion for it that's what sets them out above the rest that's what that's what moves him out further yeah even then after you take a man and he's got a business and maybe he's maybe he's labeled in that business for years it looked like he was going to fall through but something happens he invents something whatever he labored he gave his life to it and he might neglect his wife and kids to do it because that's where his passion is what i'm saying what i want is my passion my devotion let it always be god and his purpose my wife and my children listen many men i'm gonna bring this full circle many men like these men here many preachers they start out with the best of intentions many preachers they all got the right intentions starting out but some are money and women and popularity some of that set in it stole their passion it redirected their energy they're no longer devoted to the thing they used to be devoted to you say well that's them and i'm not preaching false doctrine i'm not this on that how devoted are you amen what's your devotion today to christ look like compared to what it used to be because if it's not what it used to be then it's not what it ought to be it ought to be greater but so my devotion my passion for god today it's greater than it's ever been that doesn't maybe look quite like it did when i was a little more surprised i learned to cut the corner a few ways i got a little experience amen but listen i i've been through battles i've been through situations it's like my natural marriage we've been through things but our love is greater and stronger today because we we went through it together because we stayed together this god's been faithful me in the worst times of my life not just when i was on the mountaintop that's why i'm more devoted i'm more passionate about god today than i've ever been hey see the father's looking brother man says an adoption and hearing him over and over again he's looking for a son that's interested in the father's business not just trained not just capable interested he's interested in my work he he wants to see what i'm doing he's looking on my shoulder that's really neat i want to see how you do that he's interested in the father's business we're interested in the kingdom of god we're interested in souls interested in jesus christ amen souls are my passion god's children are my passion amen when i first became a chris when i first come the message i remember brother i'm saying brother brad i'm saying this in elijah 1955 he said if you love god you'll love his children right john talks about that if you love god you'll love us children he said i'm a daddy he said if you did something if you want to do something nice for me he said do it for my children brother brown says that this astounds me it's but it's the truth brother baptist said i would rather you love my children than love me that's not the astounding part the stunning part he says is and god feels the same way god would rather you love his children than love him yeah that's really good listen god does not need me to minister food to him today in the natural he doesn't need me to take him water but if you do it for one of these as children it's no different than doing it for him he would rat listen he doesn't lack and as a great infinite spirit amen but you do something for one of his little ones that means so much to him that's my passion i love god so much this brother bram said i've got a gift i love god that's why i want to do something for his children amen he deserves first place now i'm going to bring this up to a close here real quick but brother bram talks about this in the ephesian church age he's preaching seven church ages and talks about this the ephesian church age they were not a church that was under the threat of false doctrine amen they were the most ordered church they were taught they've been instructed by paul they had everything in a row amen right the looming threat of the ephesian church that first age that first church in that first age was not some you know sort of backslid preacher this that their primary threat was they were losing their first love amen it wasn't the persecution it wasn't false doctrine all these other things they lost their first love now it didn't say they didn't love god they just lost their first love they lost the preeminence of it and you look at their subsequent backsliding and the condition of each age each cooling off brother bam says it's the same thing it never each oh it starts with yes they lost their first love then they fall into this they fall it's always so listen your first love is your first line of defense if you're losing your first love it's time to get right with god don't wait till you stop praying don't wait till you stop reading your bible don't wait till you're in a gutter somewhere in the alley or a bar as soon as you see you're losing your first love that's the time to get right with god say go what happened to my person what happened to my devotion this is not what i used to be i'm lost and joy my salvation cry out like david restore to me the joy of my salvation in order to be joy unspeakable and full of glory i preached this before what causes a good man to leave church what caused him to leave a faithful wife or whatever these things he gets dissatisfied he tries to reinvent himself or change things amen he's dissatisfied like dan just satisfied with where he's at but god give you is good enough it's your dissatisfaction what's the problem he realizes at some point he can no longer maintain his responsibility because he no longer has a devotion these people seem very devoted for a couple chapters hey man listen i don't know where you're each and everyone you're at but i know this friends listen jesus has never let me down that's more than a cliche to me that's more than just a good saying that's more than me just trying to convince you i'm a good preacher he has never let me down i have let him down i'm ashamed to say it i've let him down i've let my wife down i'll let my kids down but jesus christ has never let me down once we get let down with things in church will this happen this person didn't shake my hand this person at home and this we get dissatisfied and we lose our devotion to god listen jesus never did that to you well brother so-and-so said this and sister so jesus didn't do that to you it astounds me how people will do stuff to us and we take it out on god yeah right well i'm just not gonna go to church anymore i'm just not gonna pray god didn't do that to you that'd be like your brother's home did something so i'm gonna go i'm gonna go yell brother john for it he didn't do it we take it out on god everybody's mean to me god's not mean to you he suffered and died we've had things i've had things happen to me i've been light on i've been sick i've had bills overdue i've been abused i've heard but listen i'm not gonna complain god never did that to me god brought me out i'm not gonna complain i've lost some sleep i've had some real trials but god's never let me down once that's why i'm passionate about him amen he's been better to be than i deserved i know what i deserved i know where i come from but praise god i know what he gave me and i know where i'm going i've got not one reason to back away today read this quote here and i'll be done brother man says this isn't the seven church changes he reads that quote out of revelation two says i have a few things against thee because thou has left thy first love and brother bram says what's the matter with the tabernacle a man ought to be able to say when you meet a man is your christian experiences when was it the dearest to you you ought to be able to say right now he said well my best experience is back when i first got the baptism of the holy spirit when i come then say oh brother you've fallen from grace hey man i'm gonna let that hang there for a second oh all right i hear it all the time we do this we get these rose tinted glasses on oh i remember the good old days all my days have been full of trouble and evil what are you talking about it's the goodness of god that brought me here it's a mercy followed me oh well back in the day i used to do this and when i first come to church and i for you fallen from grace he ought to be more dear to you now than he's ever been before he ought to be more real to you now than he's ever been before he'll be closer and more past you ought to be more passionate about him now two days what is this june 29th whatever june 27th today 2021 you all be more devoted today than you've ever been and if you don't feel that way from your heart it's time to pray let's stand to your feet stand your feet it's time to pray not two years ago not when i first got saved not last week today he's more dear to he means more to me today he's ever met that be your devotion let that be your passion i preach all this for a reason because everybody struggles with this somewhere it's satan's plan in this age to wear out the saints well i'll get tired more i don't know listen if you're gonna if you're gonna be devoted to one thing let it be jesus christ if you put him for listen if you're a devoted christian you'll be a devoted husband you'll be a devoted wife you'll be a devoted parent you'll be devoted at your work you'll be devoted to whatever you have to everything you do and give you the word you'd do it unto the lord yes in the name of the lord that's right always put him first amen close your eyes as we bow our heads just close your eyes i want you to really ask yourself you don't need to show me your hand you don't need to convince me you could do that with joshua it wouldn't mean anything but i just want you to ask yourself i should take a moment and say am i more devoted to him does he mean more to me is he more dear to me today than he's ever been before or is it just a fond memory have i become dissatisfied with my with what the lord's done in my life i'm gonna go ahead and pray and as we pray you just be honest with yourself and the lord maybe today if you have a need just pray to yourself as i'm praying say lord i i'm guilty of losing my first love i see the things of the world creeping in and stealing my joy i don't want that kind of a life for myself for my home wherever you're at today i i want my devotion i want to be more earnest today i want to be more fervent and sincere today than i've ever been before in my life i don't want anything to come between me and my lord as you pray heavenly father lord i stand here today as a witness of your faithfulness i stand here today as a witness of the resurrection in my life lord i am a man that has seen you do mighty supernatural things i could stand on the platform and testify on miracles and the grace of god being manifested to different ones but father and all that i i find in myself as a man i've i've had weak times there's been times i've been driven to my knees in the contrition that lord i i lost my drive my passion would i i'd let things become a chore i was guilty just showing up just doing what i was supposed to do like those under the law i brought my sacrifice i did what i was supposed to do but i lost that heartfelt feeling behind it lord i never want to wake up another day of my life and not have a feeling for my wife my children lord i don't want to live a life doing all the right things but my heart's not in it i don't want to be a samson guilty you've given me everything but my heart

today lord as you deal with our hearts may we be sure may we be settled and established that we've put you first lord you're more than just a savior to us you're our lord you're our owner you're our headship i want to be a prisoner to every word and will of god i want to be a joy to me to serve god when i lift my hands and i praise you when i'm persecuted and afflicted for your mistake no matter what it is i want to be able to rejoice like those disciples of old even when they were afflicted and in prison they rejoiced to know they were accounted worthy to suffer for your namesake god no matter what it is today we rejoice to know we were kind of worthy to stand for you in this glorious message the glorious gospel of jesus christ and the most deceiving deceiving darkest wicked age there's ever been father we've seen many many have come and many have gone heavens and earth lord they might even pass away but you said your word will not pass away your kingdom abides forever lord

light father there be one here today wanting to make that the holy ghost which is calm you deal with their hearts right now father only you can do this lord i i can't do this for them you've got to
