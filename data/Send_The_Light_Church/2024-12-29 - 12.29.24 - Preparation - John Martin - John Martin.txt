the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you amen so glad that we have someone that we can go to when life just isn't the way we want it to be amen and it can certainly uh usher in frustrations and uh but we're not left alone you know we we have the Lord he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he said I will I'll take you through and uh I wish it was easier for us I wish it was plain but then we wouldn't need Faith that's right and so this is all part of it God's children are Faith amen just like just like our heavenly father is well want to say season's greetings hope you had a a nice Christmas a Merry Christmas um with your family and uh it can be kind of sometimes precious it's not meant to be that way it's meant to be cherry and merry but can it can bring some pressures because um well it it just can't we're just going to let it go you know you know what I'm saying there amen let's look to the Lord in prayer we'll get into the word this morning our heavenly father we thank you Lord for watching over us all this this holiday and uh bringing us back here Lord we thank you for safety we thank you for the prayers of the Saints we thank you for meeting us here Lord last service we thank you for your word and Lord we thank you for just being with us with our families and Lord the time that we spent Lord we just thank you for being the center of our life amen that you inside of us Lord are still uh projecting Christ outside to each and everyone we thank you for that this morning Lord as we have gathered together Lord we have an expectation Lord to see you uh Minister and and speak to our hearts in a personal way and Lord we thank you that we've been able just to enter in and express our our love to you through song and through worship and to to honor you Lord because you're worthy to be honored this morning in your house and God we just ask that you would now uh take these receive our praises and and may our our hearts be prepared uh to receive the engrafted word this morning Father we pray that you would remember those that are not with us uh for some reason we just ask Lord that your Holy Spirit would Minister uh onto each and every one of them and Lord that you would burn within their heart and draw them so strong to you Lord that they can't wait until the next time the doors are open to be in your house father now we just commit ourselves into your hands and just come and Minister Lord your love your mercies your grace to to us now we pray these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you let's turn to the Book of Revelations we just have one familiar verse we want to read and it's in Revelations chapter 19 as we look into this subject this morning we know there is going to be a rapture there's going to be a Rapture and uh God's word is true it cannot fail is sure as anything um but there's nothing guaranteed that I'm going into the Rapture there there's nothing guaranteed uh but it is guaranteed there's going to be a Rapture but the uarantee is if I'm going and so there's a part that we have to play we want to talk this morning about preparation and let's read verse seven together let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready amen God bless you may be seated and this is the part the only part that really we can play is preparing ourself if I stare at the word I am predestinated I am going to make it uh then I can begin to lose focus of this important part of preparation and I think I would almost rather have a revelation on Preparation than I'm predestinated if I had to choose I would rather choose to have a re ation of pressing towards the mark rather than saying I'm going to be there because um the the devil would like to take as as the prophet taught us to take certain uh scriptures and certain parts of the word in the Bible and help us to bring such such a comfort that we begin to begin relaxed and uh when we're relaxed we don't feel like we need to prepare and so this is an important subject the word preparation in the actually means the action or process of making ready or being made ready for the use or consideration and that's what I'm saying we know there's going to be a Rapture and we want to be in a place of consideration we we we um because we know there's many going to come to him in that day and say Lord what what about us what about us I did this and this and this and this happened in my life and you know I'm known by other people and I can show you testimonies and but to to God that didn't make them prepared a and so if we're going to be considered by God then we we have to be prepared and if we're going to be prepared that means today uh before the rapture we have to put our our our s our heart our life our desires our attitude into action we have to uh get into the process of making ourselves ready in order to do that we've got to dismiss the thought process that I am ready and we also have to dismiss the process that all I have to do is come to church and that should make us ready so we we have to actually look beyond that and that's why we have the scriptures to help us and to provoke us uh to these good works amen and did you ever have to push someone to do something yeah that there should be lots of amens on that and if anybody's got children there there there there's a given and if anybody has ever uh had somebody work for you or somebody's underneath you in in management um and you're trying to or or sometimes you're trying to get you know uh um uh Cheryl would have to remind me you know you have these things on your list that need to get done you know what list I'm talking about right and it don't matter if you did you know eight of them there's still those last two that need to be done and um so it it's like uh when when you're trying to uh press or or try to get somebody to do something something um they already know what to do but they just don't want to take action you know what I mean it it's it's it's time to to take out the garbage it's time to do the dishes it's time to clean the room it's time to get the this job done whatever it might be uh and and they they already know but they're not taking action see this is what preparation is it means taking action uh and when you have to push someone to do things it's clearly proves that they don't have a great enough desire to do it that's just that simple one morning Jim heard his name called John Jim it's time to get up and go to school from Mom and Jim responded but I don't want to get up they don't like me at school I just don't want to go mom said you got to get up Jim you're the superintendent you're the high ranking officer you got to get there you're in charge of the district so when you have to keep pushing someone to do something it's clear indication that they really don't want to do it now the Bride of Jesus Christ will never be able to make herself ready if she has to be pushed that's the first thing I want to say the bride don't have to be pushed she don't have to be forced she don't have to be babied she don't have to have a carrot dangling in front of her all the time she's not a hot peppered hot peppered hot baby plant however that goes the nature of the Bride will have a love inside of her heart to want to be ready because she has counted the cost to make herself ready she will pay the price daily to do God's will will she will pick up her cross and I'll say it like this the sufferings of God's will for her life because that's really what the cross is it's it it if if you're not suffering you're probably not doing the will of God because our flesh is still flesh and it still don't want to do God's will it it just doesn't and so there there's that battle there but I believe that she will dress her character in the word of God and that takes that's what it takes to get ready it's to become the word of God other brandom said it's like this he says it's easy to know where you're going he says just look at what you're being drawn to look at where your desire is pulling you towards amen how often have you thought about going out to eat I mean this is how happened a number of times in the car after church we're sitting in the car and we say to one another where would you like to go out to eat I don't know where would you like to go but what do you feel like eating what what hunger do you have I mean if you had Mexican food the last three nights you're probably not going to say yeah I feel like you know Mexican food so whatever you're hungering for is probably the direction you're going to go amen and if you're hungering to to be ready to be God's bride then you're going to be drawn into the word into the message into addressing your life but if that draw isn't there and you're you're constantly being drawn into the things of this world or the things that you just want to do for your life then that's the direction you're heading and that's not a good direction and that's why we have the the the Bible to help us to warn Us in things if there's a deep calling inside your heart be assured there's a deep to respond amen David said in Psalms 42:1 as the heart panth after the water Brook so panth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have have been my meat day and night they continually say unto me where is thy God so he's talking about a deep calling inside of him for God Amen there must be a God to respond if there's a desire inside you remember the story about the brother R talking about the boy who had the the a need for sulfur inside of him and he just he couldn't get it with a chocolate bar an apple he needed he needed something with sulfur in it he could he found it in an eraser am and when he got it it satisfied him because there was a deep calling there inside and God has put something inside of each of us to drive us to the place where God is already at amen amen I want you to catch that just like a need for sulfur just like a need a craving to to go eat if you haven't eat eaten in a while and you're hungry God put that hunger there inside of you in your in your stomach so you eat because if you don't eat then you're going to your immune system is going to get weak you're going to get sick so this is just the way he made us and in the bride there is that desire already Amen to make yourself ready it's there and of course you have to cultivate it you do you you have to get in his presence you have to worship him you have to to to to to to uh reciprocate the love back to God that He Loves Us with and that makes it grow here in in 1 Corinthians 2:9 the Bible says but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God have what prepared for them that love himen so we're talking about one group of people here only the group that loves God they're not talking about anybody else we're not talking about the group that half loves them we're not talking about the group that do you know does many wonderful works or prophesies or any of that we're talking about a group that loves them so this is an internal thing it's real easy to look who that is it's really easy to look who that is just see where you're being drawn to where where's where's your love at today so to those who are preparing themselves if I could say it like this if you love God you're preparing yourself does that simple so it's this group who is preparing him their self that God has already got something prepared for them amen but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yeay the Deep things of God we've gotten into this before about the Deep things of God and and there's something inside of us we come to church you know brother BR says we just can't wait to get there right we can't wait to hear from God there's just something personal that's for me amen bam said in the message Christ is the mystery of God he says but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to the bride to his bride hell hell is against this truth hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it amen that's her stand he says why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you he says but you let many things get get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting and you're hungering it's God trying to reveal to you see the Revelation that's here in the last day so God placed something inside of us it's a hunger it's a hunger to get ready it's not a hunger to just acts 238 repent get baptized it's not a hunger to just you know I know God sent a prophet okay I fulfill that hunger no job said I will not be satisfied until I awake in his likeness there is a preparation that's that's that's that God is calling us to how many's heard that you have a theophany amen right we have a body already waiting for us we can't sit here and not manifest what we are it's manifesting time uh the devils are becoming more demonic and the Christ the true true believers are becoming more like Christ it's manifesting time and we can't allow the things of the world to get in the way you know Jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteous for they shall be filled it's if we don't hunger after becoming prepared we won't get there we won't get there look at the children of Israel they were when they came out of Egypt for some reason they were still mindful of the land that they came out of yes and we've heard this uh you can you can uh uh you can take somebody out of the world but you can't take the world out of somebody and just like in in brother bring that example of a pig you can take a pig out of the barn you can bring him into the house you can wash him up you can powder him you can baby him you can put a bowl on him you say you're going to be with us now you're going to eat dinner with us and you you can share sitting by a fire and reading stories and whatever you do as a family but when it's time to go back outside he's he's he's not going to say I can't wait to come back in the house and be like you he's going to go right back to where his Nature's at amen and if that if that nature doesn't get killed we cannot get prepared so Hebrews 11:14 says for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from once they came out of they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire desire a better country that is a Heavenly country whereof God is not ashamed to call them their God for he has prepared for them a city amen so God has prepared for us already a theophany for us to become to and we're just automatically being drawn to that our our our our mind is is set on being the Bride of Jesus Christ where the world is caught in this place of just complacency and I'm talking about the the lukewarm church member of just just going to church and just just doing as little as possible and still feeling that they're you know predestinated look at that that I'm telling you that is no different than these I don't want to make mention of just you know certain types of churches but there's churches out there denominational churches they they just believe once saved you're always saved as long as you do this it doesn't matter you're you're in no matter what and there's no focus on becoming Into His Image they're just happy that they they repented they got baptized and they they call themselves whatever denomination you want to call yourself but you see that Spirit wants to come into the to the message now you you there that's why the two spirits will be so close and we we got to understand we have got to get prepared because he's already prepared he's prepared a place for us and now we got to get prepared for that and if all we had to do was is do the the uh uh the natural part of repenting and getting baptized in Acts 238 then we would be fine but we we were promised to receive the holy spirit amen now the holy spirit will prove a preparation it will it will prove pressing towards the mark it will prove getting us to the place that we're in His image but too many people fall short they do the natural part the first part and that the walk with Christ does not become spiritual so God has prepared a city okay he also said in John 14 Jesus did I go and I prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and he says the next verse and where I go you you know and you know the way right so he's going to prepare the place and he's telling you know the way so there's got to be a way to get there remember Jesus said um broad is the way why is the gate broad is the way and many go in there at straight is the gate narrow is the way and few be that find it says but you know the way blessed are your ears they hear your your your your heart they understand your eyes they see the way to get in the way to get to that place that's prepared for you Peter said in 2 Peter 1:11 for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting uh Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so this way is being ministered God sent a prophit in this hour to to to open the word to us to open the Bible to us not to give us a new Bible but to open the word to us and when we come to church that secret relationship that you have with Christ God speaks to your heart the person sitting next to you they don't know what God spoke to you right amen it it's personal we're here as a group we're here as a body we're a local body we're a family together but you know God deals with us as individuals alone and it has to do with a love affair because the person sitting next to you that they could just be out of it you know they they could still be in so being so carnal so natural so the only reason they're here is because it's church and and and and then the other person on the other side well they could just be so in love they they they prepared themselves for the service how many times have we heard that we got to come and prepare oursel for the service because you get more out of the service when you're prepared well you're going to you're going to don't don't think we're going to make a Rapture without getting prepared it's not going to happen Matthew 24 here Jesus is speaking to the Endtime Believers about preparation but he's also warning the mate believer Matthew 24:42 watch therefore for ye know not what hour the Lord do your lord your lord doth come not even the angels know but know this that if the good men of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up amen therefore be ye also ready for such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh amen now has anybody ever broken into your house to your car or to some property that you ever had is is that have you ever had that experience I certainly have I've had it happen a couple of times when I had had lived uh back uh as a boy as a young young as a boy in my home and I had uh a a a stereo taken out of my car I had uh coins um taken out of the house broken in when I I wasn't there uh I also had them take the Cadillac converter off our truck at work at one time just one time in the existence of trusted two I I also had him take uh the the the the the guts out of the um AC unit you know when that was going around that had that had those I think those four things uh happened uh to me that I can recall and I can tell you like this that if I would have known ahead of time that something like this is is is about to happen I would have prepared I I simply would have said I'm not going to allow this to happen amen I'm going to I'm going to get my my friend my father I'm going to get some I'm going to get some help and we're just going to get ready for this situation and we're going to stop it before it happens because we know about it well Jesus said I'm coming I'm coming soon be ready now at that point we have to make a decision is he truly coming or brother Dennis has he per has he delayed is coming you understand it's it's the thought that we have after what he said because we've heard for how many years brother Marty that he's coming and we've come to church and he still hasn't arrived like we thought right but you know he's coming in the opening of the word that should that should let us know that the corporate coming is also coming if you can see them in in the opening of the word personally to you that should give you such an excitement that the Rapture is just around the corner but if you're not receiving from them personally that that Rapture looks so far away are you with me he said in verse 44 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not that is when the son of man cometh this word becomes the message to the Believers this word this word that he's coming soon this becomes the True Heart message to the Believers because when he comes what does it really matter does it matter how many re Revelations you you you you you have have or how many Mysteries you know or how well you can uh know exactly um even who's in and who's out of the message or um no no false what these false doctrines that people believe or or even what's happening in our governments in the world and how things are going to unfold at the end what is it really going to matter when the day happens what is it going to matter the only thing that's going to matter is am I ready for that day that's the only thing that matters so this becomes the message to the bride is to be ready nothing else matters you can know everything have everything be able to do everything but if you're not ready what willon it matter so it becomes the message to the Believers but to the mate Believers it's just a fairy tale it's just a fairy tale in other words it's there but there's nothing that's forcing them or pulling them to get ready the believer takes action to make herself ready the believer continues on the process of making herself ready because it is her message personally not everybody's going to believe be ready and of course you know the devil wants to get people to believe they got the Holy Ghost when they don't why so they don't seek it no need to seek it if I got it right amen yeah he wants to beat people up who have the Holy Ghost and say you don't have it but you know you you just can't deceive God God has a way of just making it known it's it's true that our our John the Baptist his Eagle Eye got dimmed over his beak grew out he he needed help that's true we go through that but you know God will see you through did did not uh Jesus Jesus send forth word to John the Baptist just tell them what's happening the Fulfillment of the scriptures is happening in this ministry and you are the one that said Behold the Lamb of God so God has a way of letting us know who we are if we we get off he does Amen we don't have to worry let us be glad and rejoice and what give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready I want you to ponder today how are you making yourself ready just how are we doing that are we are we doing that by you just fill in the blank what's important is not whether or not I agree what's important is that you know it is making you ready amen because the end result is I want you ready amen the end result God Wants You Ready it it I don't it doesn't even matter if you like me I don't mean that wrong because it's not about some sort of um you've got to agree with me and you got to like me and we it that's not it what's it is you got to be ready for the Rapture I don't have anything to do with it's the word of God it's between you and God Amen now the foolish virgin never took action I want you to remember that the foolish version she never took action she never continued in the process of making herself ready for the use or the consideration of God but she was a Believer she felt she was already ready this is a real important thing because the the devil wants us to always feel like we're ready always but you notice the holy spirit in the Apostle Paul to the first church Age The Prophet to the first church age he said his message was I I'm pressing I haven't attained I haven't apprehended I'm pressing towards so here was a man that was anointed by God and the spirit that was on him was telling to press in we see the the devil is trying to tell us to relax how do you get into Leo Leo deia you relax so she feels she's already ready she's just kind of hanging in there waiting for it to happen in other words there's no need to take action if you're already ready there's no need to continue in the process of getting ready if you're already ready so it's a horrible Spirit it is a horrible Spirit I'm already prepared I'm already ready I'm in need of nothing it's proud it's arrogant it's foolish and that's what the foolish virgins had and I don't want to typ this Parable we're going to talk about here in a second with a lukewarm leoan Church whose works are neither hot or cold they're like in the middle you know they're enough to saywell because of this it shows that I'm you know I love God but they're not looking at this Jesus said because you say that you're rich or increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable poor blind and naked so you see the attitude is I have what I need I don't need anything else the way that I'm serving God the way that I am doing what I'm doing I don't need anything else and the Holy Spirit is he he's he's trying to pull us into His Image right he's trying to draw us into His Image but in order to get there we need something more than just being a hearer of the word we needed to be a doer of the word so we have to put into action we have to put in the process that I need this for my life Luke 12:16 as we read this Parable Luke 12:16 and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentiful plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to to bestow my fruits I've just got so many here and he said this will I do I know how to take care of this I'm going to pull down my barns and I'm going to build greater ones and there will and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods and I will say to my what my soul not my body not my wife not my husband not my kids not my parents I say to my soul soul thou H has much Goods laid up for many years take thine ease take thine ease so if you ever have this feeling about taking thine ease just know that anointing is from the devil that anointing is from so eat drink and be married now that's a key factor we're going to dig into that a little bit here later eat drink and be married because everybody has to eat drink and be married but he's setting he's setting a a a picture for us when you take it easy we're just going to sit and relax take it easy and just kind of be merried like have a Merry Christmas have a Merry Christmas without Jesus amen you understand what I'm saying have a Merry Christmas without Jesus and so the the anointing of the devil wants you to speak to yourself because all through freeo agency take your ease everything's okay you've already been baptized you're already in the message just take it easy and God but God said unto this person thou fool this night thy Soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou Hast has provided and then he says so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich towards God you understand it's two Spirits one is selfish and look Goods could be your popularity it don't have to be buying a bunch of things it could be your reputation it could be whatever you want it to be but what is needed is to be rich towards God his kingdom seek first the kingdom and his righteousness put God first make God's kingdom richer because of you and when you do that you know what God does He blesses you with more of himself it's through The Obedience of just doing what he wants you to isn't about going home and trying to be a monk and being a perfect person it's actually putting the Life of Christ into action in your life looking for opportunity to bring Christ to somebody take thine ease eat drink and be merry this is the same this is the same phrase that Jesus uses as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be when he returns he said there'll be eating drinking in other words just take your ease until they knew it not until the flood came yes and they were all taken away so shall it be at the coming of the son of man in other words there's only one group of people that is going to be prepared and that is the bride amen the foolish virgin is not going to be and this this what I want to say you know we're trying to get certain people to you know really try to dig in and they just don't want to you can't force them to they're making a stand who they are because the bride wants to be ready you've heard the old story if you can talk somebody into something somebody is going to come along talk them out of it right so you can talk somebody for a season to get on fire with God you know but something greater than you is going to come by you know what that is that's the devil in somebody else and anointing them to take their ease to relax so I just say like this the bride is not is not the person that you got to keep pushing you don't got to keep you you don't got to keep trying to like get her to do something because there's things already prepared for her because she loves God right she already loves God she has that relationship going now we come to church and yes we're we're provoked to Good Works we're provoked to make sure that we're you know we we cast off the works of darkness we're putting on the the the the the armor of light and we're and we got to oh yes I got to stop doing that I need a precedent that but you know that's between you and God that's the way it's supposed to be it's not somebody having to try to tell you you know you need to be doing this if if that is happening to get you where you need to go you really need to get to the Altar and get some things decided with God Amen come on it's a truth it's a truth this this is a condition of being relaxed take thy knees take it easy have a good one no need to preach so serious John you know what we we don't need that it just doesn't make it doesn't make me feel comfortable but I'm telling you if you are prepared and you've done everything that you need to be you're as happy as a lar I don't care what the preaching is it's a truth it is the truth if you're where your need to be you're not going to feel condemned because something inside of you says I I know where I'm at with God and and and if you you're you're you're you're rasling then just say Lord what is it more that maybe you want me to do that's it and then you just say Amen to that and and you you you you you begin to walk in if and if you're if you're not quite sure then get serious with God and spend more time with them and I'm telling you just in that time of process of of spending time with God things happen they that wait upon the Lord renew their strength amen I tell you God does when you you're in a problem and you got things going on in your life that they're real bad and you get down on your knees and you pray and you get strength that doesn't mean your problem is resolved that doesn't mean God takes it away that just mean God is there with you to be with you as you go through that problem why and and that's all that matters Paul told Timothy for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap to themselves teachers having itchy ears for they shall turn their ears from the truth and shall be turned onto fables we're living in that hour yes Titus hold fast the faithful word is it have been taught that ye may be able to by sound Doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers for there are many unruly and vain talkers yes all they do is talk they you watch their life and they will not come under subjection to the word amen for there are many unruly vain talkers and deceivers especially they of the circumcision you know if your heart isn't really wanting to be circumcised you're you're you're you're you're just you're going to still do your own will right so you have to give up your will whose mouth Must Be Stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things that they ought not for filthy lucer sake peral times we're living in we live with all these Spirits are disguising themselves transforming themselves having doctrines of devils now what are those doctrines of devils the seducing Spirits you know what they're doing they're causing people just to relax just relax don't get serious we do not want you going to the Altar and asking God for help we don't want that we do not want you leaving the the church feeling that you need to to try harder we do not want that we want to entertain you we want you to feel good we want you to enjoy the service in the flesh I might add in the flesh but see it don't feed the inner man amen it don't feed the inner man so these Spirits are are causing us there's no need to press in that much there's no need to get ready there's no need to prepare some shall even depart from the faith scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming amen I know when I first came into the message I tell you the first the thing that was Pro most dominant in my heart is God is coming soon I remember that as clear as day walking in fear that it could be any time so when I step into church I better I better get what I need so so that I am prepared that when he comes he's going to receive me and because it hasn't happened the way we thought now how many times did we think he would come by here by here by here I'll tell you I had so many dates now I never told I never like preached it or or or said that but in myself I thought remember brother Bob Crawford telling me how many times he thought this car was going to be the last car I buy and so we got these preconceived ideas that he's going to come but he hasn't come and and it causes the spirit to be more real to you amen and we just got to stay in love with the Lord just stay in love with him now right after Jesus foretells the signs of his second coming he urges the followers to be ready and he gives this Parable in the next chapter and he talks about being prepared it's about the 10 virgins if you want to to turn their Revelations chapter 25 five of The Virgins were ready to meet Jesus in The Rapture they were ready and the five who did not prepare to meet Jesus they were not ready and I'll say it like this the foolish only had enough oil to burn for a short time they obviously were burning for a short time time because you'll see in the parable he says their lamp went out that's right but they took no oil with them and and we're we understand this because Brother Band told us that justification is a part of the Holy Ghost it's a part of the oil by you just repenting saying God I give you my heart that's the working of the Holy Ghost in you we cannot deny the children of Israel came out of Egypt we cannot deny that but we have to admit they did not have enough oil to go into the promised land and they died in the wilderness Jesus said with many of them God was not pleased with them right amen so it's important that we take enough oil with us to make it into the Rapture amen all right Matthew 25:1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish so it had nothing to do about them being a virgin or a churchgoer not even living you know they living decent lives but one was trying to do it in their flesh they they didn't want to give their will totally over to the Lord because that's what it really takes you know if you know what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is the will of God in your life it is a foolish virgin he still goes to church still believes God still believes the word but he's doing his will and the Holy Ghost is inside you the Holy Ghost is never look at this the Holy Ghost is never going to live in you and say yeah you just go ahead and do what you want to do it's just not going to happen if if you remember that's how we were when he saved us we were doing our own will amen and so the Holy Ghost comes inside remember Jesus said I've come to do thy will oh God and we're born not of our will but we're born of God's will okay he say they that were foolish they took their lambs and took no oil with them so I just want to stop here for a second you hear the preaching of the word and the word of God says you need to get more Holy Ghost you need to seek more of God you need to press in and the devil says what are they saying I don't got the Holy Ghost what's what's wrong with me you know this is not making sense to me and the the the ministry of the word is be sure be sure get more press in don't entertain thoughts of attained but if you're going to air a on the side of I need more there is nothing wrong about doing that am but there is something wrong with gambling there's something wrong with that so they took no oil with them but the wise took oil let me just say this by the way how many believes that you have the Holy Ghost let me just see your hands okay you have the Holy Ghost now do you remember the day you got the Holy Ghost okay let me ask you a question and just be honest with me do you have more Holy Ghost today than you did that day okay that that that that's enough to prove what I'm saying is that you need more and we need to press into that thought process not the thought process that we don't have we already got it but more give me oil in my lamp keep me burning right just more more more of you Lord more that hunger that thirst is what gets you to that that place of preparation for the Rapture but the wise they took oil in their lamp in their in their vessels with their lamps they made sure that there was something inside of them for the future not for now they didn't need it as it were because they were in the same place that the foolish were they were lit they hadn't they had that confession they had their faith I believe they had that but they didn't take what they needed for the future and this is where the where the foolish version mess up because they say well I'm going to church like Bob I'm doing what Bob does I I'm doing this I'm reading the Bible I'm in the message that's what they're looking at but they're not looking at the future that's the whole reason of pressing in for more is for the future you'll see this and while the bridegroom T they all slum and slept see so they're needing the oil for after and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him well we know that was the message of the hour and the message actually told us how to meet him amen how to meet him what it what it required to meet him you you literally have to come buy of me without money without price you have to give your heart your life that's all God has ever wanted he wants a relationship but he wants the relationship based on his will amen we have not been born again of our will we or we haven't been born again of a high bread part our will part God's will we have born been Born Again of God's will period and you understand the the the thing of the Holy Ghost more Holy Ghost gets rid of more of your will it doesn't make you smarter and more knowledge knowledge puffs up but the Holy Ghost it edifies and the and the Holy Ghost is the love of God it's what it takes to meet him is that what the message brought to us this is why people who belittle the message of the hour who do not take it seriously they're going to miss it and and I'm going to say it like this there are a lot of people in the message that the message is not in them it it's just like being in church but it doesn't make them a Christian they got to get Christ in them they got to get the church in them oh my my I cannot believe that time is uh it it's like it always was in the past it just goes by like quicker than you want to go I wish we could just like stop time you know from 10:30 you know to 11:30 and then when I'm done I'm done and then we all feel like oh it's just a regular service all right let's continue reading then all those virgins arose and they TR their lamp okay I'm ready I'm ready I'm believing I'm believing and the foolish said unto the wise give us your oil for our lamps have gone out and the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to get it the bridegroom came and they that were ready that were already ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards came also the other virgin saying Lord what about us come on what about us I know you love us and he answered and said verely I say to you I know you not watch therefore for you know for ye know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh now this is just not a story this is here to make sure that we're serious about making sure that we got enough of of of the all the Holy Ghost it ought to provoke us to just get a little bit more really what do we got to lose what we don't got nothing to lose you know no 's going to look at you and say oh look he's up at the altar she's up at the altar there must be something wrong with them no there's something great happening with them they're literally wanting more what they than what they got the altar isn't just to say Lord I'm I'm sorry the Lord is I want more the the altar is I want more I hope you're catching what I'm saying Matthew 22 let's try to do this one real quick we won't be able to get them all and you know unfortunately there wasn't a lot of scriptures but we just took our time as we went through this I'm sure you're getting you're getting the message today Matthew 22 ver1 and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son we should all be able to relate to this every one of us here and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not not come sometimes it's really hard to try to even get somebody to come to church they got every excuse in the world basically they didn't want to come to the wedding and he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have pardoned uh I prepared I have prepared my dinner my Ox my f fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marage so God has prepared his part and now he's trying to tell his those that are coming to the wedding you prepare to come to the wedding and the and the thing is come but you know you can't come to God with your will so as you're coming to the wedding and God says give up this start doing this become more like me that is where you make that decision I Love You Lord amen and then he is prepared and he reveals to you what he has prepared for you so you say yes Lord it's worth it to be just like you it's a love affair amen but they made light of it and they went their ways they made light of it take your ease went their ways one to his farm his his house one to his business to his merchandise and the remnant took his servants and treated them despitefully and slew them but when the king heard their thereof he was rought he sent forth his armies to destroy those murders and burn up their cities and he saith to his servants the wedding is it's still ready but they that were bidden were not even worthy and he he went remember he went to prepare a place for them but we show whether we're part of that place we show whether we're worthy of that place by responding to the word by responding to the word go ye therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid them to the marage now we understand that the Jews rejected Christ and now it's who whosoever will verse 10 so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good in other words don't worry about your past and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came to see the guest he saw that there was there there's a man which had not a wedding garment this man tried getting into the Rapture without getting prepared he wanted to get in his own way and he said unto them friend how camest thou hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king to to the servant bind him hand and foot take him away cast him into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth now this represents tribulation you can't make a Rapture unless you got the Garment on and the Garment is him right you're you're dressed with him you're not coming in with your own you take what the what the Chamberlain gives you for many are called to the wedding but only few are chosen amen so look where you're being drawn to all right Luke 12:41 if you could with me just uh kind of ignore the clock now ignore the clock pay attention to the word amen Luke 12:41 then Peter said unto him Lord speakest thou this Parable unto us or or even to all and the Lord said who then is a faith and wise Steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his own house to give them their portion of meat in due season blessed is the man whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing just being a faithful Steward of what God has given you of a truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he have but if that servant say in his heart notice he doesn't say that to his wife or to his husband or to their children or to their mom and dad to the pastor but in his heart he said my Lord delayeth is coming and she'll begin to beat the maids the uh men's servants and maidens and to eat and drink and be drunken there it is again to be at ease to eat to drink to be married to be drunken just be at ease and what what does it mean to beat okay I just I just want to say this here look you know what it really means to to to beat you don't care about anybody but yourself that's beat that is beat you know we we we think beat is no brother bam says he that hates somebody is guilty of murder and they didn't need to murder him so I just I just want us to to get us to see that when we begin to get selfish with our life we're taking it easy we we feel it our heart that the Lord delayeth is coming because if you knew he was coming today you wouldn't take it easy right so you see that the spirit that we're fighting against here the verse 46 and the Lord of that servant will come in a day when you look for him not when you look not for him and an hour when he is not aware and will cut him aunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers notice this person was not an unbeliever he was a mate believer but the mate believer and the unbeliever go to the same place their portion is the same place and that servant which knew his Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes that's why the prophet said you never leave here the same you're either closer or further away and he and but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of Stripes he's going to be beaten with fewer stripes for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men shall committed much of him they shall be asked the more says I come not to send fire on the earth I said I am come to send fire on the earth and what what will I if it be already kindled in other words there's something inside of God what is he doing why is he sending this fire but I have a baptism to be baptized with and how am I straightened till it be accomplished and other words God has a purpose he wants to take a bride out of here and he knows not everybody's going suppose ye that I come to give peace on the earth I tell you no oh but rather division in other words when that baby was born peace unto all men Good Will to everybody the the option was out there to everybody it was presented but he knows he can't stay like that there's a there's a time and an opportunity for man to make a decision and he wants man to make a decision he said I'd rather have you hot or cold but this's lukewarm no way so here he is with this fire inside of him and he says I I I I don't come to get peace but neighbor rather a division for from henceforth from this point forward there shall be five in one house divided three against the two and two against the three he knows about it not everybody is going to say yes I'm going to serve you lord it's not going to happen I mean we want to do what the prophet said we want to apply the token we all got loved ones who are out of the Ark of Safety that's just all there is to it now we want to believe for them we don't want to have any negative attitude towards it but in reality God is calling to make a stand God is looking for us to say me in my house we will serve the Lord and that's the attitude that needs to be in our homes that's the attitude that needs to be in our life amen we live literally need to look at one another our brothers and sisters and say come on we need to get going this is the way walking in it we need to get closer to God 2025 amen we don't want to sit there to just you know eat drink be merry take it ease we're in the message no what don't we have what don't we have did you ever go on an egg hunt you ever going to egg hunt oh shame on you no I'm [Music] kid so I I remember I remember you know going and getting one and and and and you're always wondering where's the where's the other one there's got to be some more I just say it like this Saints there's got to be more for us in Christ it's got to be we're just not sitting here waiting there's more joy there's more peace there's more love amen let's stand together there's more there's more of God for us just going to read this last one as you're standing Hebrews 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet he was moved with fear that means he respected the Lord he was moved with respect to God and he prepared an AR to the saving of his house by which he condemned the whole world and became heir of righteousness which is by faith I'll say it like this we all need to prepare our homes our loved ones we need I would rather be hated by them and tell them today this is the only way Christ is the only way because by us being nice to them they're not going to look at us and say oh you nice to me I guess Christ is the way we we we we we've got to we've got to do with Noah dead we've got to prepare our our our home number one right here and those that are around us get them in and and maybe it's only going to be your family right I I I don't I don't know but but you need to preach that word 25 years whatever it is keep preaching it and get as many as you can inside take action press in press towards the mark respond to the calling inside we hear the word respond remember when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time what was it that that voice said to him keep pressing on he said do I have to go back I don't want to go back he says yes you do keep pressing on he didn't say go back and can just take it easy wait keep pressing on there's more for you now think about how many souls he saved between the time he came back and the time he passed away they wouldn't be in heaven if God didn't send them back we just we got a powerful part to play Not only just in ourselves getting ready but to help others get ready amen amen let's sing that that that song Hold to God's unchanging hand and let us be glad and rejoice give honor to the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready amen time is filled with swift transition not of Earth unmoved can stand build your hopes on things a turn no hold to God's unchanging hand hold to God's unchanging [Applause] hand hold
