I think it's a good place to be uh here today if we're weak &gt;&gt; to become strong in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I don't know any greater thing that can make us strong than the word of God because it is the strongest thing. And we're going to be reading some quotes today where brother said he gave us his word uh to protect us. And uh he sent his word to heal us. His word is everything to us. And we want to talk about planting that word in our heart today. And I I believe it'll be a a service that we all could benefit from. Let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer. I want to say as brother Ron did, God bless Tabby today for coming. May the Lord bless you. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, we deem it a privilege to be in your house, Lord. Lord, thank you for calling us to be yours. One day we had no desire for you. We didn't want to know about you. We were uh doing our own thing and happy doing it. One day you you came by and you let us know Lord that we belong to you and that the condition that we were in, we wouldn't make it. And so Lord, we thank you for for changing our hearts and revealing yourself to us and calling us with a holy calling to to be your bride to be that special lady, that elect lady without spot, without wrinkle. Lord, we know that you're calling us, drawing us. For you said, "When the Holy Ghost comes, he will lead and guide you into all truth." &gt;&gt; Lord, we're thankful for the truth that we do have, the truth that we're living, the truth that we believe. We know, Lord, that there is more for us. For Paul said, I'm pressing towards that mark &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling. Our hearts, Lord, we're we want to press into it today. We ask that you would take away any spirit of of doubt, of unbelief, any tiredness, any lefery, any lukewarm leodysia, anything that would keep us from pressing in as we ought to, Lord. And may the word become alive to us. Just bless this little thought, Lord, today, Lord. We ask that you'd be with each one uh that isn't here uh that's in the live stream today. Lord, they have needs in their homes. Their heads are bowed. They're praying. &gt;&gt; God, may you touch them. May you meet every need. And may you bless us all, Lord, as we press in to thee. We love you. We thank you for that. As we wait further upon thee here now, in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Turn with me if you would to the book of Genesis where it all started. Genesis chapter 1. Jesus did say, "Men shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; And the word is the most important thing to the Christian. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 1, we're going to read two verses there, verses 11 and 12. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth. And it was so." It was so because God spoke it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind. And God saw that it was good. Amen. God bless you. May be seated. So everything that God created, he placed a seed in it with the ability to reproduce itself. Right. &gt;&gt; There was nothing that God created that one time you planted it and it was a tomato and the next time you planted it, it was an olive. God is not the author of confusion. He's not the author of well, I wonder what's going to happen if I plant this. We know that every seed comes forth of its own kind. If you ever bought a a carrots in seed form and you planted them and they came forth lettuce, that means they put the wrong seeds in the package, &gt;&gt; right? Because we know whatever God created, that seed is going to come forth. Uh so when God created the the herbs, the grasses, the bushes, the trees, the creeping things, the fishes, the whales, the birds, the horses, the bears, and humans, inside every one of them was a sea to reproduce itself. And in Genesis 1 26, and God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God, created he him, male and female created he them. And we know when God first created Adam, he created Eve inside of Adam at that time because the Bible says um he called Adam and Eve. He called them both Adam, right? And then he took a part of Eve out and formed a body. And um that was the feminist part of of Adam. And they just a perfect type of uh us coming out of Christ that he could uh have love and fellowship with us. Amen. In a more uh beautiful way. So in all the creatures that God created, none of them were created in the image of God except man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And before Adam fell, he was in the same image of God. If we can think about this, he had the same attributes of God. He was immortal. He was divine. He was eternal. He possessed the spoken word. Everything that Adam did was good. Just like everything that God did was good. Everything that Adam did was good because he was in the same image. Adam was faithful. He was full of joy and peace. He loved like God loved. He loved Eve so much that he was willing to give up his life for her just like Christ did for us at Calvary. So Adam was a wordborn son &gt;&gt; because God is the word. And so uh it was Adam. Adam was the spoken word of God for he was created in the same image of his invisible father. &gt;&gt; So it's hard to to really imagine or depict what Adam was really like. Of course, the message uh talks about some of those things, but um when we look at Jesus Christ, we see that he was in the image of the invisible God as well. &gt;&gt; And he was a perfect son. And if I could just say this, Adam was absolutely he was in an exact image because he was the seed of God and every seed brings forth of its own kind. So, I have a number of quotes today that I'm going to read and I hope this will be okay. Um, the the sometimes it's not as entertaining, but here's the thing. It's a really good teaching on planting the word in our heart. Abraham said questions and answers on the seal. He says, "And we always follow the nature of our parent." You know that look at the baby, the nature. Well, then Adam was the son of God. Eve was a daughter of God, right? the first thing of the creation of God which could not have one speck of evil anywhere about it. Evil wasn't even known at the time. Evil wasn't even known at the time. So, Adam was just perfect. You know, when we look at one another, we see faults and and things in one another's life. And Adam didn't have any. In the message fundamental foundation for faith says now God when he made man in the beginning he made him superior to everything on the earth. He gave him jurisdiction of everything on the earth. He could control everything. He could control the animal life. He could control the foul life, the fishes of the sea. He controlled the winds. He controlled the plant life. He controlled everything. Man was made as a secondary God on earth. He gave the power to control all things, all elements of the earth. That was Adam. And Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop. He could speak to the trees and they would obey him. He could speak to the wildlife. It would obey him. He could speak to the water. Uh ever what it was, everything obeyed Adam. So it's showing us that Adam was truly in the image of God. In Satan's Eden, brother Brandon speaking of the Garden of Eden. He said it was a beautiful place. There was nothing like it. Great paradise of God and the great dinosaurs and whatever more crawling through it and the great animals. No harm in them. They were just as gentle as a little kitten. They had nothing at all. No sickness, no sorrow, no disease, no germ on the earth. Now we fight germs all the time. Oh, what a place. He said the great birds uh swinging from tree to tree and Adam could call them by name and they would fly up on his shoulder and cool on him. Oh, what a wonderful place God had. The message the breach between the seven church ages and the seals. Brother Ram says, "And when he lost his life, he lost his inheritance in life because he had complete supreme control of the earth. He was God of the earth. God is God of the universe everywhere. But his son had earth under his control. He could speak, he could name, he could say, he could stop nature. He could do anything he wanted. But he did that. But when he did that, when he fell, he lost his inheritance. Adam could say, uh, let this mountain here be moved over there and it would obey him. Adam could say, "Let this tree be plucked up and planted over there." And it would do it. For he had complete supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a son of God. Why are you reading all this? Because God is calling us into the same image. &gt;&gt; So if we know what God created at the beginning, we know what we are to become. After Adam fell in Genesis chapter 3, man was born without the will of God, without the spoken word of God. Where Adam was born by the by the spoken word, God said, "Let's make man in our image and it happened." Well, after the fall, everyone that has been born has been born completely out of the will of God. We were all born through a sinful nature without God. Man had become separated from God. God could no longer say that man was in his image anymore. Man was being born in the image of Satan. Uh we should all say amen to that because it would help us. In other words, uh, everybody that was born was born selfish, proud, rebellious against the word of God, no desire to do the will of God. Every time you try to correct the child, it just it don't want to do it. But that was not the man that God made in his image. &gt;&gt; God had to turn his head from man. Literally in Genesis 6:5, "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth. And that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continuously. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God." And he actually repented and it repented the Lord that he that he made man on the earth and it grieved him in his heart. So think about how sad God was that here was man with in the image of Satan. And you could go to Revelations chapter 13 and read about the mark of the beast. Um it is said that it is the same mark as as as is the number of man. They're the same. They're one and the same. 666. So when Jesus came to earth, he had the same testimony. He said, "There is none good but one that is God." And Jesus told a ruler of the Jews, he was actually a master of Israel, his name was Nicodemus. He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." So now we're going right back to the birth. And of course, Nicodemus, you know the story, how can uh a man enter to his mother's womb again and be born? And but the the flesh part is part of the creation of God. But the nature of humans was not God's because everything that God makes is good. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus is telling Nicodemus that your nature, you need a new nature in order to enter into the kingdom of God. This nature that you have, no matter how good of a person you are, no matter what great things you do, it will never allow you to come into the kingdom, that nature has to die and a new nature has to be born in you. &gt;&gt; Most people don't understand what it means to be born again. They believe it's an act of God whereby eternal life is imparted to the person who believes. That's why you got people saying, "I believe. I'm born again. I believe." And they're they're missing what the new birth really is. John 3:6, Jesus speaking here. John 3:6, that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. So flesh is man's nature alone involved. So just two people come together, they have an act, and then they have a child. That's flesh. But that which is born of the spirit is when God comes into a person's heart and changes their nature and births his actual word inside of them. &gt;&gt; He births. In other words, it's the seed of God that goes into the heart, which is the womb of of of a human, and a new nature will spring forth from that birth, from that word being planted. Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; All right. Jesus said in verse 7, "Marvel not that I said unto you, you must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound there, but you cannot tell where it came and where it's going." So is everyone that's born of the spirit. In other words, it's never controlled by you. You don't know. It's God. It's it's Adam wasn't birthed by God, created by God, the spoken word. And he says, "You know what? I'm going to do my own thing." &gt;&gt; God would never He would never have a different seed inside of him. The seed that was in God produced Adam. &gt;&gt; It produced the right nature. And when the seed of God comes into us through the word of God, it will produce the same nature &gt;&gt; that God is because his word and him is the same. The new birth has everything to do with the will of God. and it produces the same image of God. Every seed brings forth of its own kind. When a person with God's seed inside of him recognizes who they are, they will feed on the word of God until they begin to manifest who God is. &gt;&gt; Can't get away from it. You got, you know what? You have the majority of of of professing believers trying to sell that they're a Christian. but their life doesn't match it. &gt;&gt; And in reality, if they would just focus on living the word, they don't have to sell anything. [laughter] &gt;&gt; They just manifest the word. Jesus said, "You must be born again. There's no other options." And what that really means is a man must be born according to the way God originally planned. Man must be born to the way that God originally planned. So the way that we're born is not good enough. And when God wills us to be born, he will will us to be born according to his image. There was nothing in his mind that said, you know, I want to make man in a different image than me. All the other animals, even the most subtle beast was not in his image. But man, he wanted fellowship with man. &gt;&gt; He had a he had a purpose with man. And that was to have fellowship with him. And he couldn't have the kind of fellowship he wanted if he was talking to some lower creature. Right? Even the most subtle obese could talk, could reason, but it couldn't connect, not on the same level. So when the new birth takes place in a Christian's life, their life begins to mold more into the image of God. &gt;&gt; It begins to evolve and and each day, each week, each month, it it just provides another opportunity for that word to grow. Now, what we have for the majority is we have churches out there who who are claiming Christianity, but they're really not coming into the image of God. And you can't just because people put peacock feathers inside of them, it doesn't make them a peacock. &gt;&gt; I I I mean, every peacock's going to bring forth of its kind. [laughter] And a Christian is just a born again Christian. He's just going to come forth in the image of Jesus Christ. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. &gt;&gt; You couldn't stop it. So when Jesus said is is born again, if you look it up, it means to procreate. Procreate. Something that wasn't there now comes into existence. It means to regenerate. It means to bear or to begat or to bring forth into existence. It means to conceive in word form and to be delivered of in manifestation. So in reality, this born again experience is not something that happens in your head. Not something you prove in your head or the way you talk or even human changes that you can, you know, do in yourself. It's the literal working of God's Holy Spirit in a human heart that literally changes his very nature. &gt;&gt; And it is the most glorious thing that could happen to a human in on on planet Earth. That's what we're talking about today. The greatest thing that could happen. And you know what I love about uh Paul? Paul taught me that your attitude means everything of what you're going to become. If Paul had half the attitude, I think he would have manifested only half of the life of Christ. But because he had this attitude, I want more of God. Oh, I oh that I might know him. He wanted to press into him. Not just the the knowing him like this because we don't know Christ up here. We know Christ by experience. 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 16 says, "Wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh. Yay, though we have known have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more." In other words, it's a spiritual birth. If we could just forget it doesn't have anything to do with our reasoning, our understanding. We're not to lean into our own understanding. We're not to, you know, try to do it oursel. We're just follow the word. Whatever the word says, that's God. That's the new birth. Just do what the word says and we become the word. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, here's the criteria. Any man that's born again, he really is a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new. In other words, our first birth, there was nothing about God's image in us. Not one single thing about our first birth had anything of God's image in us. Nothing. I I mean we might have been cute to look at, cute to hold and uh have be able to have fellowship with someone older. But our nature, there was nothing in our nature that was in the image of God. It was a mixed tree. Its motives were wrong. They were selfish. Has anybody ever met anybody that that that weren't a Christian and uh their motive wasn't selfish somewhere down the road? You understand what I'm saying? There's there's something in it for them. But if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature. Old things are way passed away. Behold, all things have become new and all things are of God. So to me, these scriptures define what the new birth is. So it doesn't matter if we say we're born again. We should say, "Are all things new in our life? &gt;&gt; Has all the old been passed away?" Because if it isn't, then we need to be pressing into that because the the new birth will produce that. It will produce that. Now, in order for all things to become new, we must keep planting the word of God into our heart. That's what this service is about. We must keep planting the word of God. You plant it. We don't want to just have part of the word, but we want to have every word of God. There's a reason that Jesus said we must have every word of God. And the spiritual birth is happening to us every day as we receive the word. As you receive the word, truly receive it, not know it, not quote it, not say, "Yeah, I believe it." But you actually begin to put heart into obeying it. And it and and your heart and you you keep doing it. You can't do it for a week, right? The word didn't fall on good ground there. You got to have a sincere heart. You got to just keep doing it. then your your your born again experience is happening. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, we we should be testifying. That's where tell our testimony should be happening is the the of the new birth in our life. &gt;&gt; You know, because this to me is should be just as exciting today as the first day that Jesus saved us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. As the word is being preached, we open our heart. We let it in. We give him liberty and he begins to build his image inside of us. And that's how it does it. It's so simple uh that I think it it just bypasses so many people because you know it it's not in doing great things. It's not getting in great revelations. It's not in demonstration of of the flesh. It's really uh simply a human being with humility and love that says, "I'm just going to obey what God tells me to do." And they begin to do it. And you step back and you say, "That's that is not a human. That's God. That is God in a person." 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 17 says, "Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." That's why we always want to give God liberty in our heart. &gt;&gt; We don't want to say, "No, I'm not going to do that. No, I don't want to hear that. No, I don't want to listen to that. No, I don't have to do that." You know, God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble. Right now, the Lord is that spirit. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord. We're looking at the glory of God when we look into this Bible. We are changed, the Bible says, into the same image of our Lord from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. So we come to church, we're hearing the word of God preached and written this. What that is is not some minister up here. Certainly not just brother John up here speaking words. We believe that God just uses this office. He puts a minister behind the the sacred desk. He speaks his word and to the believer who believes that word is God's word to their heart personally. &gt;&gt; Receives it. They become changed. &gt;&gt; There's nothing worse than sitting in church and never being changed. That is the most miserable horrible thing. Something is wrong with the heart. Not the word. Not the word. The word is perfect. &gt;&gt; We are changed into the same image of God. God is still saying today. I mean, or I believe he's still holding forth his word that he spoke in Genesis chapter one, let us make man in our own image. That is still his heart's desire. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The purpose that he had back then, he wants to have it today. Yes, he wanted it in the spoken word. But but what is happening? Okay. Oh my. God had all these attributes that he wanted to express that he could have never expressed his love as we know if there was a perfect sending. So he had to create evil as the Bible says and allow this thing to come about so man could fall and he could come down and be a savior and be a healer, be a redeemer, be a deliverer that would never be able to be manifested if he didn't allow that. &gt;&gt; But what did he do? HE GAVE HIS BRIDE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY IN SATAN'S Eden &gt;&gt; to say no to Satan, TO SAY NO TO THE FLESH, to say yes, I'll take God's word and begin to prove to God, I love you, Lord. I love you. I love you more than myself. I don't like this ugly nature. I really want to be in your image, Lord. I want to reflect you next time there's a trial. I want to be just like you next time I go that thing. I don't want to come short. I want to be like you, Jesus. Praise the Lord. That was fresh. Bible says or brother Ram said the message the rapture he says then if God ever does anything in the church it'll be original back with the word again. Exactly. It has to be because the life is in the tree and it bears its own kind. Jesus wants fruit of or for himself. His wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is. Then if it don't bring forth children, bride children, word children, then it's a denominational child. Then her first love, the world, the denomination, she's gone back to that and it can't bring forth a real genuine born again Christian because there's nothing there to bring it forth. In the message, the seed is not air with the shut. Brother Ram said, "But a genuine born-again church of God believes the word of God in the face of everything regardless of what it is." &gt;&gt; The word is the absolute. Praise God. The word is our absolute. The spiritual birth takes place as the word of God is planted into our hearts. said that, but I want to I want it to stick because you know sometimes we make this thing real hard like how can I get the Holy Ghost? How can I be born again? How can I get delivered? How can I change? How can I become more like God? And it's real simple. Start obeying the word of God. &gt;&gt; Things happen supernaturally when you trust God enough. You don't lean to your own understanding. You just trust God. You start obeying him. 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 22. This is, you know, definitely bears um studying when you get home the scripture here. 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 22. Seeing you have purified your soul. You've done it. You've done it. You purified your soul in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeign love of the brethren. See that you love one another with a pure heart fatly being born again. Now notice, go back there just a second verse. It's a colon. It's not the end of a sentence. And what is in that included in this sentence? Verse 23, being born again or begat or brought into existence not of a corruptible seed, but of an incorruptible seed by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. See, you take that word and you purify yourself by obeying it, seeing that you have purified yourself by obeying the word of God. It's so simple. We don't we don't have to have any feeling, any emotion, any demonstration, any great dream or or or or or a vision. Alls we need is a heart that says, "I believe that I am a seed of God. I believe I'm a child of God. I believe I've been called into his image." Um the Bible says that um we've been predestinated uh that that Jesus Christ is the firstborn among many brethren. &gt;&gt; So just how Jesus is, I I'm going to be because I'm part of that group &gt;&gt; and I I have faith that I'm going to be in his image. So I take the word of God more seriously. &gt;&gt; Right? Become in love with the word. Not your reputation, &gt;&gt; not your image, not what you want people to think about you, but become in love with the word. Oh, I love the word. The word of God is a seed. We must have it planted. We must plant it in our heart, not our head. I tell you about your head. I don't whatever you're thinking about right now. In an hour from now, you won't be thinking about it. You may go to the restaurant and say, you know, I really want to have some pancakes. You get those pancakes. Oh man, I didn't want pancakes. Your mind changes &gt;&gt; all the time. Now, thank God for mine. We need a sound mind, &gt;&gt; right? But the word can't be just planted in your mind. &gt;&gt; Your mind, your mind understands the word as you read it or you hear it preached, but it needs to drop down into the heart and it needs to stay there and abide there forever. &gt;&gt; That that settles it. I believe it. Nothing is going to change it. my emotions, my feelings. So many times I get rejected, yelled at. No matter what happens in my life, how much sickness I get, I'm going to believe the word of God. I'm going to believe that I'm going to come in his image. Nothing is going to change it. &gt;&gt; That's why it has to drop. And it needs to be planted in the heart. When you plant it, it grows. If you only think about it, it'll stop growing when you stop thinking about it. But plan it in your heart and your nature will literally change day by day. Verse 24. For all the flesh is as grass in the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass witherth and the flowers thereof fallth away. But the word of the Lord endureth forever. And this is the word which by the gospel was preached unto you. We've all had flowers in our home, have we not? &gt;&gt; And they're so beautiful. when they first come, they're just you look at them, it cheers you up and you just they're just beautiful. You testify of the beauty. Well, we know God created them. But eventually those flowers start to brown and wilt and look like we got to get rid of these things. &gt;&gt; We got to get them out of here. They're starting to stink up the place. Well, that's what happens to me if you just have the word in your mind. &gt;&gt; We can't even go the next day and remember what was preached &gt;&gt; last service. &gt;&gt; But you get that word in your heart, you'll be thinking about it a lot more. &gt;&gt; The word of God must be planted in our hearts in order for us to obey it. We won't keep obeying if it's just in our head. And as we obey it, we become the word manifested for the hour that we're living in. We'll be changed from glory onto glory. Amen. Brother Brham said, told you I had a lot of reading, a lot of quotes, but I hope hope this is a a blessing to you. The signs of his coming. Brother Bham says, "And if the word of the Lord and if it's the word of the Lord, then it's his premeditated thought." Amen. and how we were how we have eternal life because we was spoken into existence by God. Not joining into a church but born by the word. Born by the word the original seed that God said let there be and there was. Amen. That's the way God bs his children today in the womb of their heart with his word and his word takes root and it grows. &gt;&gt; We've got to plant that word. We have a part of that. I mean, we could, you know, how many times we heard people sitting in church all their life and they never change. They never receive the word into their heart. But you could just take one word and you plant it in your heart. Something will change inside of you. That's the power the word has when it is believed in the heart. Said, "How can a spirit in a human heart say it's of God and deny this word?" When the very God word itself is when the very God word itself is what's in the human heart. Amen. If it isn't, it's something else and then it isn't the Holy Spirit. In other words, anybody that says, "Yeah, I'm born again. I've got the Holy Ghost." But they deny the word of God. Something is wrong with that spirit because the Holy Spirit and the word is the same. It's our absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; We must keep feeding on the word more and more to grow. Brother Bram said, "The true vine, the false vine said, we know that the Holy Ghost feeds on the word." Feeds on the word. I know when I was in the world, I didn't even think of the word. I was feeding on everything else. And then when God began to deal with me, I remember laying on my bed and reading the Bible a little bit. And then I was feeding on the world still. I was. And then I'd get the Bible and I'd read a little bit. Eventually, I had to make a decision &gt;&gt; what I was going to feed my life with. &gt;&gt; As the eagle stereth up her nest, the ram says, "Oh, I like to have sheep food, good food, the power of God, the word of God, the Holy Ghost feeds on it." That's what the church needs tonight is a good solid gospel preaching, gospel teaching, gospel salvation, and the gospel Holy Ghost. In the message thirst, brother Ram says if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit, the word of God, Jesus said, "Every word shall be by the Holy Spirit." He says, "And listen now, if you try to feed it with the wrong thing, if it's the genuine Holy Spirit in you, it'll know the difference." Now remember, the word of God is what the Holy Spirit feeds on. It don't feed on enthusiasm. It don't feed on education. It don't feed on churchgoing. It doesn't feed on theologies. There is a lot of difference between an inspired something and a theological standpoint of it. &gt;&gt; It's hard to feed on the word of God if our hearts are not prepared. I want to spend just a few minutes talking about the importance of our hearts being prepared. If we're not careful, we may become satisfied with just making it to church. I made it to church. Preparation has nothing to do with making it to church. It has everything to do with the condition of your heart while you're at church. Brother Ram says this is where God deals with us. And we come here to learn where we're at spiritually. Amen. So, let's turn to Matthew chapter 13 or or you can look up here or those that are taking notes. And what we're going to do is we're going to skip around in chapter 13 here to I've never done this before with this quite like this uh that I can remember. So, just maybe to help uh we might grab something more than than we would have before. I'm not sure. We're just going to try it. We're going to start with verse number two of Matthew 13. And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore. Now, can you imagine if we would have came in here and I'd be sitting up here and you'd all be standing. That's kind of what was happening when Jesus was preaching here. And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, "A swer went forth to sow. And when he sold, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them up. So what kind of seed was Jesus referring to here? Luke 8:11 tells us, now the parable is this. The seed is the word of God. &gt;&gt; So here it is. The swer went forth and he swed the word of God. Seeds, right? Like, "Brother Ben, you need to pray. Genie, you got to love. Sister Joy, you got to do something." [laughter] And the seeds just went out. He swed seeds. You know, when you come to church, you hear so many different things being preached. &gt;&gt; That helped me. That was a blessing. Or I wish somebody so and so was here. That would have helped them. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; But there's a lot of seeds here, right? And it it's it's really um in one sense singular because it's God, but in attributes with he it's seeds and that's the way it's referred to. The seed is the word of God. And some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up. So look at verse 19. The interpretation comes in verse 19 of what this is. And when one when anyone hears the word being preached and he doesn't understand it, then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that receiveth seed by the wayside. So the word, it does make it to the heart, but because the person just kind of came to church and plopped in and he's really not paying attention, he's not involved. He doesn't quite understand what the word is being preached. The enemy is going to come and take that word out of them to where it's not even going to become part of their life. That's very true. Verse five. And some of the seeds they fell on stony places where they had not much earth and forth with they sprung up. And because they had no depthness of earth, and when the sun was up, they were scorched. And because they had no root, they withered away. So this is another condition that man has when he comes to church and he hears the word of God. It's his heart is has hardness, hard spots in them. Maybe the whole thing isn't hard, but there's hard spots in them. And Jesus gives interpretation here in verse 20 and 21. But he that receiveth seed into stony places, the same as he that heareth the word and says, "Amen." and and with joy he receives it and says yes I want this yet have he not root in himself but dareth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended in other words as long as everything's going okay I can say amen yes I like the word I think it's a great thing But if you only if if you don't have root, in other words, the word is only in your head, like you're a head Christian, and you don't get it down into the deepness of your heart where that word means everything to you. Soon as a little trial comes by, you get offended, little persecution comes by, you get hurt, and then all of a sudden, well, I'm not going to live the life right now. The word is not going to those first of all, those two grounds will not bring forth the image of Christ. It'll make you act like a Christian for a while, but it'll never bring forth the image of Christ. Verse seven. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them. Think about that. Why didn't the word choke it out? Verse 22. He also that re receiveth seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word. And the care of this world, &gt;&gt; and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, &gt;&gt; and he becometh unfruitful. &gt;&gt; Why doesn't the word choke out the cares of life? Why doesn't it? Because the word's powerful. Why doesn't it? Because there's one thing that God will not cross and that's free more agency. He will not take second place to the devil. He's not going to stay there. What'll happen is he will when you allow the things of the world in your life, they will choke out the the word of God that you received in the past. And the cares of life are just problems that we have, right? Things that we got to do. You know what? Whether things we got to fix at the house, things we had more things to fix at our house this year than any other time. And these things can get in the way of your time with God &gt;&gt; and your attitude that you have when you come to church. Some problem that you're having at home or something, all of a sudden that gets in there and that chokes the word cannot bring forth the image of Christ. Here's the fourth type of ground. Verse eight, but other fell into good ground, and it brought forth, and some 100fold, 60fold, and 30fold, who has ears to hear, let him hear. Verse 23 kind of describes what this good ground is. But he that receiveth seed into good ground is he that re that hears the word being preached, he has an understanding of it, which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth some 100, some 60, and some 30. So notice he obeys the word and the word produces fruit and this is what brings the image of Christ. This is the only ground that will bring the image of Christ. I like how Luke 8, you know, speaking of that same parable here, defines what this uh good ground is, but that on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, they keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. They're not in and out of the church. They're faithful. They they I if this is what the word says, they just do it. If this is what the prophet said, they just do it. They learn to be faithful. That is the first step of anything is faithfulness. God is faithful. His wife is faithful. His children are faithful. There's only one ground that will bring forth the image of God in us and remain. And that's good. A good sincere heart. What good would it do to come into church, plop down in your seat, and the devil takes away what was swn in your heart? What good does it do? Wh what what good would it do to receive the word of God if you come into church and you got hardness about somebody or something? You're you're you're you're it won't last. What good would it be to come into church if you got if you got things of the world? If you love the world or the things of the world, the the love of the father's not in you. It won't hold you. It these this this type of heart condition cannot bring forth the image of Christ. And and we need to become that. We need to become the image of Christ if we're going to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; We just got to it. It it we've got to come in. We've got to get more prepared. We've got to spend time in the prayer room. &gt;&gt; We don't want to get to church at 10:00. We want to get to church at 9:30. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and God bless my precious brother. Get I know he got here just as soon as he could. I had nothing meaning there. Um but I'll tell you sometimes we we come here to church early. You know what we'd end up doing? Talking. Talking. And you know what we do after church? Talking. Like if we prepared before service in the prayer rooms when we heard the word when we get out of church we'd be talking about the word. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's what it does for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only one heart that's going to bring forth the image of Christ and it's those that are serious that go deep in Christ. They're ordained. They're elected. They're chosen to be the bride and they will let the word of the Lord conform them. That's it. They through free more agency. They say, "If that's what the word says, I'm going to do it." What's happening inside the bride right now? We could just read real quick. Romans 12:1. We're almost We're almost through. I hope um you can just stay with me a little bit longer. I hope you can stay with me a lot longer. I mean, I got um uh more notes, more quotes. Romans 12:1, I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your body a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. Think about the word different than you ever used to think about it. That you may prove with your life what is the good and acceptable and the perfect will of God. The word of God must become our headship. We must allow the word to dominate us. That's scary. Dominate us. Brother Brand said Queen of Sheba. He says God intends the Holy Spirit to lead the church. That's our leader. That's the one that was sent to us. And we're to be dominated by him and him alone. That's that's pretty powerful. We're to be dominated by God. Then we stay in the word level in the word. I always like brother Smith would say good balance. The Holy Spirit feeds you sheep food. And sheep food is the Bible. And it feeds on the Holy Spirit. The soul that's hungering for God feeds on the word of God. Too many people say God is in their their head, in their heart, and they they they ignore the Bible. Too many people say God is in them and they ignore the Bible. Can't do that. In the message and uh tomb, uh brother Ram says, "Then how can you say you can stay at home and be just as good a Christian as you would be at church?" He says, "You can't do that." He He said, "Read the word." That's what [laughter] brother Phom said. "Read the word." The Holy Spirit feeds on the word. The Bible is God's spiritual diet. For for those of you that are going on a diet, you know how hard it is, right? It's sometimes hard to keep reading the word of God, to stay in it, to only feed on that, to only feed on the word. There's that tendency to feed on the word and feed on other things. But you can't do that with a diet. That's why I never go on a diet. I I can eat oil cookies the rest of my life. The Bible is God's spiritual diet for his church. And the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in your heart. And with thanksgiving, you water it. &gt;&gt; That's where you praise God. And every divine promise will produce just exactly what God said it would do. It's got to. It's his word and it's his life. Amen. Any promise that God makes you, any promise that God makes, you just plant it in your heart and say, "It is mine. God gave it to me." &gt;&gt; Now, you may not see any results right now. You don't see your corn crops soon as you plant your corn, but potentially it's there. And as long as you leave it alone, keep watering it, it'll grow. Don't worry about that. It'll take it'll it'll germinize uh if it's a Germanized seed and every word of God is germinized by God himself. God is the word so it'll grow. You know it will. There you are. We have to take his word, accept it, believe it, commit it, and it grows. That's right. But don't keep digging it up. You'll ruin it. &gt;&gt; You'll ruin the crop every time you do that. Just commit it to God. Brandon, this I tell you this whole message came with this one quote that I'm going to read right now. It's short. Brand said in the message, God's power to transformation. He says, "Come back to the word. Take that word and it'll grow. It'll grow. It's got to grow. That word has to come to pass. It's God's word." He said, "Plan it in your heart if you want to go in a rapture." That one sentence there just break my heart. &gt;&gt; You know, we can rally behind uh this message and you know it, you know, we're going to go into rapture. That's great. But if we don't plant the word of God in our heart, how can we go in the rapture? &gt;&gt; We we just don't plant the part of we're going to be changed in the twinkling of an eye. We don't just plant that. God is looking for some. His wife is going to be in his image. &gt;&gt; And so that's happening now. We should be able to come to church at least. I'll just be try to be as graceful as I can here monthly and testify there's a change that's happening to me. &gt;&gt; Really, that should be happening. There should be testimonies of that. If there's not, I say to you, plant the word in your heart. because you'll begin reflecting Christ more. Don't get under the Leodysian spirit. I've got enough. Don't do that. Don't Don't do that. It's a trick of Satan. God wants you to press in. He says, "If you want to be genuine, if you want to be Christians genuine, place this word in your heart." Romans 6:5 says, "If if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection." Amen. Plant the word in your heart if you want to go in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Oh my my. Um, okay. Am I allowed? Time is up, but am I allowed to have like Okay, thank you. Thank you. Conflict between God and St. Bill says, "Now, what is the word of God?" So, what is the word of God? The word of God is God himself. &gt;&gt; God gave the believer himself. That's why the word is so important to us. &gt;&gt; It's not just a book. It's not just ideas. It's not just, you know, it is God. God gave the believer himself. Amen. And brother Brandham says, "Woo, it's God himself. He gave the believer himself to attack the enemy by." In other words, he's the father and the word is God and the word is our father. We're born by the word. And he's standing, now listen to this, he's standing in the forefront of his children and his children. He's standing in the forefront of his children. In them. Amen. There you are. He's standing out there for his children. Kind of like the pillar of fire that was before him and behind him. What are we scared about? The rapture is sure. The coming is sure. Every blessing has been promised to us is sure. It all belongs to us. I'll tell you, I don't mean it wrong, but think about all the people who do not receive the blessings of God, who do not receive the promises of God. And they could have had them by just believing &gt;&gt; in the message, the invisible union of the bride of Christ. He says, if you're married to Christ, Christ is the word of God. In St. John 1, in the beginning was the word, the word was with God, the word was God, and the same was made flesh and dwelt among us. Christ was the living word. He always was the word. He is still the word. He will always be the word. He was only manifested. He was only the manifestation of the attributes of God. For he was the son of God. &gt;&gt; All that was in God, he poured into Christ. All that was in Christ, he poured into the church &gt;&gt; now. We are becoming in his image. It's happening. We should rejoice in that. &gt;&gt; We should be excited about that. Not only for what has happened, but what is to happen, right? It's like going on a vacation. Part of the excitement about going on vacation is, you know, if you ask Ron, if I if I was, if I was to ask Sister Lori, Sister Lori, uh, about this vacation that you're taking, are you excited about it? Yes, I'm excited about I can't wait till we go. And so part of the excitement is what we're going to become. &gt;&gt; And any son is the attributes of his father. And just as you were in the gen genes of your father, in the body of your father when he was a young boy, you were in him. Yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you. But then through the bending grounds of a mother, you were brought forth into earth and became in the image of your father. Then he could fellowship with you. And so were you sons and daughters of God before there was ever a moon, star, or any molecule. You were sons and daughters of God. But you were you are only the physical manifestation attribute that was in God at the beginning. But there is only one form of eternal life and that was you. uh that was you before. You don't know nothing about it. Neither did you know uh when you were in your earthly father, but you are manifested to his image. In the image of God, you are made and you were manifested for the glory of God. In the fellowship of God, I love that you were you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship. &gt;&gt; Think about how much time you're going to fellowship with God today. And therefore, as soon as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth, your spiritual gene had to be in God before your expression of the attribute of his thought before the foundation of the world. Right? No way around it. That's right. Now, we notice then that life being in you, God's life being in you from the foundation of the world. Now, I just got just a one one scripture I want to read. It's Colossians chapter 2 verse number 6 uh through 10. As ye have therefore received Jesus Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him. In other words, you hear the word, obey it. As we're married to Christ the word, so walk in his word. Rooted. Noticed you've been planted. You're rooted and built up in him. established in the faith as you've been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving as &gt;&gt; thankful for what God is doing in your life. Beware lest any any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men and not and after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ. In other words, even though you're established with Christ, even though you were on fire with God and walking with God, you could allow a wrong spirit to come by you and influence you the wrong way and get you off track. &gt;&gt; You're not immune to that. So, beware. For in Christ dwells the fullness of the Godhead body, and you are complete in him. which is the head of the principalities and powers. God is working on us. He's still in his mind. If you ever, what is God thinking about? What is God doing? What's on God's mind today is that God wants to make us in his image. &gt;&gt; That's what's on his mind. We need to get that in our mind. [laughter] God is still believing. He's still waiting. The Bible says, "Waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know when he shall appear. We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. God will have a word bride who will make herself ready for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Plant it in your heart if you want to go in a rapture." I want to leave you with that. Plant the word in your heart. more more of the word. More of the word may have nothing to do with the rapture itself, but God wants you to become the manifested word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be like Jesus. Amen. On earth. On earth. I long to be like him. To be like Jesus. [music] to be like Jesus on earth. I love to be [music and singing] like him. All through life's journey [singing] [music] from earth to gloryy. [singing] I only [music] have to [singing] be like him. To [singing] be like Jesus. To be [singing] like Jesus. [music] on earth. I long to be [singing and music] like him. All through life's [music] journey [singing] from earth to [music] gloryy. I only have to be [singing] like him. [music] To be like Jesus. [singing] [music] to be like Jesus. On earth I long to be [singing] like him. All through life's journey [singing] from earth to glory. [music] I only have to [singing and music] be like him. Amen. That's a precious desire, is it not? Amen. [music] Oh, let's sing that chorus. Make me more like thee. Make me more like [singing] thee, [music] Jesus. Make me more [singing] like thee. [music] Give me a heart that's [music and singing] filled with love and make me more [singing] like thee. [music] Oh, make [singing] me more like thee, Jesus. [music and singing] Make me more like thee. [music] Only a [singing] heart that's filled [music] with love and make me more [singing] like thee. Amen. Oh, make [singing] me more like thee, Jesus. [music and singing] Make me more like thee. [music] Oh, give me a heart that's [singing] filled with love and make me more like thee. Amen. And as you continue to play that, let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer. Maybe there'd be someone here today that say, "Brother John, I want my heart to be just like his. I want to be more in his image. You want to be remembered in prayer. I want to unite my faith with you today that God would grant the desire of your heart because we're all all wanting to be in his image. Amen. Amen. Just believe now. Oh, make us more like you, heavenly father. Lord, to have that desire is priceless because we know what happens if that desire isn't there. There's no pressing in. There's no seeking after. There's no becoming new. There's no all things becoming God. And Lord, you've placed that desire in our heart to be more like you, to be more in your image. Lord, we want to fulfill your word. Lord, I believe it's Revelations 19:7. And it says, "Let's rejoice and be glad because his wife have made herself ready." Lord, your word is what makes us ready. And Lord, we want to receive every word that you have for us. Lord, help us when we come to church, Lord, to have a heart more prepared. Lord, that we might leave with more of you, Lord. those whose hearts are prepared. I pray that you would fill them abundantly. Lord, may you give above whatever they're asking for. You said in your word that you are a God that that does more than what we ask, more than what we can think of because you are God that just loves us and wants to give to us more than we can even comprehend. Lord God, we're believing in you. We believe this word that you spoke to us today. We're thankful, Lord, that you sent a prophet, Lord, to give us insight to let us know that the word must become number one in our life. And Father, we we pledge ourselves to put you first. We commit ourselves to you, Lord. We plant your word in our heart, Lord. When we hear the word of God, we're going to follow. We're going to obey it. We're going to follow you all the way. And Lord, we believe that we're going to we're going to arise. We believe that we're we're going to be changed in the twinkling of an eye because we see ourselves changing here little by little from glory unto glory. Here a little, there a little. We're becoming more like you. We're becoming more in your image. Lord, what a a perfect testimony. What a perfect proof that we're going to be in going in a rapture because we're changing now. Lord, thank you for this. Grant to your children the very desires of their heart today. We love you and give you praise for these things now. [music] Be with those that are not here, Lord. Those that are on the live stream, Lord, with their hearts lifted up and their perhaps their hands, their desire to be in your image. Lord, I pray that you would grant to them the very thing, Lord, as if they were here in [music] the sanctuary building today. Grant it, Father. We love you and give you the glory for it all in Jesus Christ's precious name. Hey.
