amen what a wonderful opportunity we have in this hour that we're living in when the the world's the world's just going crazy and people don't even know what to believe anymore there's people walking around that don't even know whether they're a man or whether they're a woman I mean that's the hour we're living in for you but I'm so glad in all this confusion that's in the land that you know I've got Fox News we got CNN news and we've got news Max and I'm so glad that we've got the good news aren't you amen the good news he he told us where we come from and he told us where we're going and he told us how to get there what a privilege it is to serve him amen if you have your Bibles this evening turn with us to the book of Saint John we want to read from Saint John chapter 1 starting at verse 32 we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and we counted an honor to come and be with you once again and it seems like a year just goes by so fast anymore and I guess the older you get it seems like it just keeps getting faster but amen but it's good to be here once again and we trust something to be said to help you and to encourage you because truly that's that's why we came and I heard something said about an offering and I certainly appreciate that you didn't have to do that but thank you for that may God bless you we just use it to go somewhere else amen but I want to read now from Saint John chapter 1 verse 32 and certainly appreciated the little choir of the young people now that's wonderful to to see you know that they're really not the Church of tomorrow they will be if there is a tomorrow but I'm so glad that they're the Church of today aren't you amen and we had a little bible study and I was telling them you know that that uh you're never too young for God to use amen he doesn't need something big he doesn't need something old he just needs something yielded just someone that'll yield to him amen that's all he's ever looked for Saint John chapter 1 now starting at verse 32. and the Bible says this and John Bard record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it would Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record that this is the son of God Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to speak to you for just a few minutes this evening on he told us what to look for he told us what to look for Heavenly Father we love you Lord thank you thank you so much for all that you've done for us for all that you've given us and now Lord we surrender this congregation and ourselves into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated he told us what to look for you know God rich in Mercy has always gave instructions to his people so that they would not error in the way that they should go Paul told us in first Thessalonians 4 13 He said but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not and even as others who have no hope so you see God don't want us to be ignorant he doesn't want us to be ignorant and he's always rich in his Mercy to show us and to instruct Us in the way that we should go that we would not error in that way and we find in Luke Chapter 2 that he sent an angel to the Shepherds who was watching over their flocks by night and the and lo the Bible says that Lo the angel of the Lord came unto them in the glory of the Lord sown around about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring unto you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you born this day in the city of David is the savior cry which is Christ the lord and it shall be a sign unto you that ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and the Bible says it came to pass as the Angels were going away from them into heaven that the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is to come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us now notice they didn't go to the king's Palace they didn't go to the high dollar ends they they didn't go to the Ritz Carlton or to some Resort or that's that's reserved for the elite why didn't they go there because they knew he wasn't there but the Bible said they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it it made known abroad saying which was told unto them concerning this child and I can just see Mary saying you know as they were there and all of a sudden these Shepherds showed up to give praise unto the newborn Savior and and I could just see Mary saying how how did you know we were here how did how did you find us and they might have said to Mary he the angel told us what to look for it oh Hallelujah you want to find Jesus in your day look to where the angel messenger says he is we've had an angel Messenger to tell us where he's at in the hour that we're living in amen the prophet said that's where the church will find him you'll never find him in the denomination he's not there you'll never find him it's some kind of educational program he's not there but you'll find him in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the only place you'll find him so let's not look for where he's not but let's look to where he is amen Hallelujah he sent prophets with Eagle Vision who could raise up and they would see uh be able to see afar off and begin to cry out to the things that was going to come to pass and give people insight to the things which are to be and what to look for and I think as I think about that of the prophets of God of the mighty prophet Isaiah who was caught up in the spirit and he began to cry out the voice of him the crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make strength in the desert a highway for our God and 712 years later oh my you're talking about being able to see a far off 712 years later the Pharisees came from Jerusalem into the desert asking John who are you and the Bible said this is the record of John when the Jews sent the priests and the Levites from Jerusalem asking who art thou and he confessed and denied not for confess I am not the Christ and they ask him what the north Dal Elias he saith I am not art thou that prophet and he answered no and they said unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what saith thou and thyself Hallelujah and he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness made straight the way of the Lord I saith the prophet Isaiah what was he saying I am Isaiah's prophecy fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears Hallelujah God told them what to look for he was the very Vindication of Isaiah's prophecy his teaching his nature his character they even came from Jerusalem to the Wilderness to see him just like the prophet said they would the very words of the Prophet was made flesh and was standing right before them how could they have missed it when he told him what to look for Jesus told them ye Hypocrites you blind leaders of the blood I sent you prophets I told you what to look for through them and what did you do you stoned them for Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killeth the prophets had stoned them which are sent unto thee how off I would have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her ticks under her wings and ye would not woe unto your scribes and you Pharisees Stephen told them that day in Acts 7 52 which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted have they slain them which sowed before of the coming of the just one of whom you have now been betrayers and murderers Stephen said he sent you prophets to tell you what to look for but for the just one comes but what did you do you persecuted and stoned them and now have betrayed and killed the very one they said would come amen and they're doing the same thing today they were Blinded By The Creeks have their self-righteousness and there's religion and the pride of life I can just see them that day in Jerusalem when the prophecy of of Zechariah was being fulfilled I could just see him in my mind sitting around the table maybe finishing lunch and the the man might have said honey let's read from the scroll of Zechariah and they pull out the scroll of Zechariah and says Zechariah says Rejoice greatly hold thy Daughter of Zion Rejoice so taller in Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just and have his salvation lowly and riding upon the ass and upon the coat and the fall of the nest and as they was reading from The Scroll of Zechariah oh my I can just see him in my mind after finished reading they hear a noise and looking up over the scroll they see him come riding into the city on the door and no doubt he said to his wife who is this who is this the Bible said when he come into Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this Zechariah told him exactly what to look for but when he came into the city they missed it oh the city may not have known there who caught the Revelation for he told them what to look for the prophecy of Zechariah had become flesh and the Bible says in Matthew 21 11 and the multitude said this is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee oh the city of Faith may not know the city of Detroit may not know the city of Ann Arbor may not know but there are people standing here tonight that know the prophecy of the Hallelujah the prophecy of the prophets become flesh and by revelation we can say this is Jesus in broad form well Gloria he told us what to look for don't miss it as they have done he come exactly the way the word said he would come but through the Creeds and their ideals they missed him for they were looking for something else the woman at the world knew what to look for right she was troubled in her mind her life was a mess she longed for something she had five husbands and the one she was living with now the man she's living with now was not her husband and at the well that day she didn't notice him at first setting with us back to the wall and she heard someone say give me a drink and she says not customary you're a Jew I'm a Samaritan that you said ask me to give you a drink and Jesus said if you knew who I was you'd ask me for a drink and the conversation went on and he said to her he called her spirit he found where her trouble was he said go get your husband she said I have none Jesus said now that's well said for you've had five and the one you're with now is not your husband and what did she say what was the next thing out of her mouth she said I perceive that you are a prophet I know when the Messiah which is called Christ when he comes he will tell us these things she knew what to look for or when she walked up to the well it was just a man she identified as a Jew but when the Messiah sign was manifested she knew what to look for in the Middle East she said this is the messiah or Hallelujah we know when he comes we know when he comes he will tell us all things and Jesus said unto her eye that's speaking to them he and she dropped her water pots and ran into the City and said come see a man who told me everything that I ever done he didn't tell her everything he just told her one thing but she knew if he knew that he knew all things amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah she saw it she knew what to look for and when she saw it she knew it was him he had a scriptural identification are you with me tonight John standing on the river that day they said unto him John you say to messiah's alive today yes where is he at he's here on the earth somewhere I don't know where I don't know where he is but I'll know him when he comes how do you know you'll know him John God told me what to look for John said I'll see him when he comes they said oh look at this fella coming right here he's got a crown on his hand that must be the Messiah driving those horses and John said that's not him and he walked right up to him and said it's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife amen the prophet of God said it made herod's wife so mad she hated him as long as she lived and John kept looking he said oh I'll know him I'll know him when he comes how do you know John how do you know you'll know him told me I'd see a sign it would be a messiah son and I'll know the Messiah because the Messiah sign will be there amen that one day look and he said behold behold the Lamb of God how do you know John how do you know he looks just like he just looks like Amanda not more than 50 years of age just plain clothes no crown he's just walking on the earth just like how do you know he told me what to look for told me what to look for elies are searching out a bride for Isaac he knew what to look for he prayed to God to make his journey prosperous he said let the dancewell that Waters the camels and gives me a drink Also let her be the bride for thy son Isaac and while he was yet prayed here come Rebecca Hallelujah the very answer to his prayer came walking right up to him amen did you notice the prophet said Rebecca when Eliza found her it was in the evening time when she was watering the camel because he said Lord that the Devil comes and Waters this camels let her be the one that gives me a drink let that be the one that you've chosen Lord to be the bride for your servant Isaac and while he was yet praying Rebecca came and draw the water and gave him a drink and watered the camels notice the camel was a beast and the Very animal that she was watering was the very animal that packed her to see her bridegroom is that right and what is watering by the watering by watering the word by punctuating the word with an amen Hallelujah you want a Revival start watering the word the promise you want to come out of that wheelchair start watering the word of the promise if you want to come free if you want to come from that cancer start watering the word God heals cancer heals all our sicknesses that's the Bible a thousand times a thousand times it's been proven with infallible proof Our God Is A Healer of all our diseases amen or we don't need to try to figure it out we just need to start watering the word with our praises and with our amens Hallelujah amen the very power that we're watering now with praises and Thanksgiving and glory and Power in might it's the very Holy Spirit that'll back us to see Jesus someday oh my that's why we need to move to the spirit in the church friends they would okay if we come to church and sit like we're dead he just don't want you to get involved let the preacher sweat I said let everybody sweat let everybody get excited come on friends we've got something to amen the world don't have the answer they got all kinds of questions but they ain't got the answer but we're a people of God who has the question and the answer amen Hallelujah Hallelujah think about that we come through those doors back there we need to come through those doors with a purpose we need to come to serve the notice on the devil we're not coming to see what's happening we are what's happening Hallelujah we need to persuade every word of God with an amen we need to let the devil know whose side we're on Amen we need to shout the victory before the walls ever come down you take football you know it's football season I'm not a football fan but it is football season and when they score a touchdown I know some of you have seen it they know he's acting like we hate and when they score a touchdown they spot the ball they do all kinds of signs is that not true you ever seen them do it before they scored why because they don't know if they're going to score or not but after they score they get all emotional and all excited but why don't they do it before when it's fourth and one why don't they already start shouting and high-fiving each other because they got the first down because they don't know when I was in the army they gave me combat boots they gave me a helmet we call it a steel pot they gave me an M16 rifle and a m203 grenade launcher because I wasn't good at shooting the rifle so you don't have to be accurate just close I made myself laugh I was on an m198 houcher a 155 halter that fired a 105 pound projectile with a max range of 21 miles they gave me all this to fight with but there's one thing the Army never gave me that was a promise of a victory they gave me stuff to fight with but they never gave me a promise of victory but when I came into God's Army he gave me a helmet of salvation a breastplate of righteousness he shot my feet with the preparation of the gospel and placed the sword of the word in my hand and you know what else God gave me he gave me a promise a victory amen what does that mean we can stop the victory before we ever have the battle amen because we are promised by our God who keeps every promise of his word Hallelujah no weapon formed against you shall prosper saith the Lord Hallelujah told us what to look for we can come through these doors shouting the victory because we are victorious [Music] huh amen years ago my father-in-law the one that got killed in the accident that my daughter was in he worked at Eastman and Eastman had a intramural softball league and so they would uh have games and done her at the Eastman which is a pretty pretty big plant down that way and they had a ball field in there had two ball fields and it was separated in the middle by a big water tower and so I went down there one time to watch a game that my my the the the section that my father-in-law worked for was playing so we went to see the game foreign cracks home run crack home run and this guy up on the Water Tower he gets he got so bad that the guys in the Outfield was

the guys in the Outfield he said hey buddy what's the score he yelled back it's nine to nothing he said you're all losing ain't you he said I don't know we ain't batted yet come on friends we need to let the devil know we ain't lost we're just warming up amen Hallelujah healing how do you know you're going to get your healing when you're prayed for God told me what to look for amen he said in Saint John 14 12 very very I said to you he that believeth in me the words to do shall I do this so and Greater Works for these shall you do because I go to my father and whatsoever Saint John 14 13 whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son Saint John 14 14. if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it hallelujah how do you know about your healing he told us what to look for Mark 16 17 these signs shall follow them they believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with two tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them and they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall not could be not hope so not maybe they shall recover he told us what to look for amen

and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what must we do to be saved and Peter said unto them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall not could be not hope so not maybe but you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise it's unto you and to your children even as far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call

of 100 I bet Vegas would like to have those kind of odds but God's not even 99 times out of a hundred but the prophet of God said he keeps his word 100 times out of the hundred Hallelujah God keeps his word Nations alive to us politicians oh God they'll lie to us but God will never lie to us he told us what to look for he told us what to look for the end time signs he told us what to look for

not my words they're his words we see the great end times signs on the Earth today we know that's right now look I've waited for this a long long time for the message to you see and you've seen the end time signs and I've preached it to you and showed it to you by everything that Christ said is that right congregation says amen you'll admit that the congregation says amen we are at the end time I don't see nothing left you say what about the mark of the beast those who reject the holy spirit is already marked by the Beast the punishment will come later when we're waiting for the mark of the beast he told us what to look for friends King of the North the King of the North the third Vision was in the realm of the world politics for it showed me that there would be three great isms fascism Nazism and communism but the first two would be swallowed up into the Third The Voice admonished The Voice admonished watch Russia watch Russia keep your eyes on the King of the North but you see when he spoke this there was no Russia it was the USSR up until Christmas December the 25th I think it was 1991. the USSR became Russia but the voice that spoke to the prophet said this would be swallowed up into a third ISM communism and the voice admonished me watch Russia watch Russia who's in the news right now Russia watch Russia keep your eyes on the King of the North brother Ben said amen it was December the 25th 1991 on Christmas day we're nearing the end time so remember Church you are living in the best day you'll ever live in it's right now till Jesus comes it's so gradually not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse when Russia goes down there to get oil not electric batteries oh look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and we're ready for it then he told us what to look for don't worry about it don't worry about these other isms keep your eyes o Russia when she goes to get that oh friends what's in the news everywhere what's in the news right now it's all about the all real glory so get ready Church get ready to meet Christ he's sending great revivals and meetings and stirring the Full Gospel people signs and wonders appearing everywhere great wonders to draw his people together and one day he shall come the deliverer great signs and wonders to draw his people together he told us what to look for tidal waves now to those without hope those without Christ without God lost in the world you're in a miserable condition but those that are in Christ Jesus should be happy are you happy you gotta let your face know amen you should be happy lift up your head for your Redemption draws nah we've had a great sign to happen here in Chicago a few days ago Jesus said in the last days the waves would be roaring perplexed of time distress between nations what was it speaking of these tidal waves never been known in all the history of the world ever tidal waste ever broke through like that until the last days a tidal wave which was prophesied right from this platform struck Chicago right here and watched the people killed up and down the banks of Chicago Science can't even figure it out said it was some wind must have come the place that how in the world could a wind coming down like that but friends Chicago is 800 miles from the nearest ocean How could a tidal wave strike Chicago because it wasn't from the ocean it was never from the ocean the great tidal wave that struck Chicago and washed the people off the beaches of Chicago didn't come from the ocean it came from Lake Michigan I think it is huh June the 26 1954 a wall of water eight foot tall 25 miles wide struck the inside entire Chicago Lakefront sweeping fishermen away killing eight some said as high as 20. 1950 what was it I said 1954 a wall of water prophesied from the pulpit that it would happen a sign of the end time he told us what to look for but it didn't stop in 1954. September the 23rd 2017 an 18-foot wave off of Lake Michigan struck Chicago October the 24th 2017 a 29 foot wave they say it's from the winds they say it's from the winds they explain it away how could these things happen it's the finger of almighty God moving to Chicago telling you that the end time is at hand and to flee the Wrath that is to come they say it's wind God sent a prophet to tell us it's my finger you told us what to look for get ready flee from the Wrath that is to come he told us what to look for in UFOs you see signs appearing the Wonders appearing mysterious things happening sure a flying saucers through the air everything else Jesus said there'd be signs in the heavens above and the earth below fillers of fire and Vapors of smoke and it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come he spoke all these things sees the Roaring tidal waves breaking everything man's Hearts failing for fear the greatest time of heart trouble we've ever had fear perplexed of time distress between nations and how the prophet Naaman said that the Horseless carriages here that race in the Broadways seem like torches and run like lightning but if it said what was he describing the uh the highways outside of Chicago everything that's spoke of everything that spoke of we're looking at in the face today what is it it's God's warning to the people prepare to meet God get ready when the atomic bombs are scared what did Tommy bombs and people are scared in the Pentagon and they don't know what to do the Mystic signs and the Skies of flying saucers and everything that God predicted it's time for that Elijah he's here somewhere to rise on the scene let the people let that little flock let that little Remnant that God will give him let that little Remnant go to calling out to God and Watch What Happens John he told us what to look for saints of God I have been on the field 34 years preaching the gospel full-time over 22 years I've been full-time ever by the grace of God 47 weekends out of out of a year I'm somewhere preaching and I have never seen in all my 34 years The Cry of the people as they're crying right now for the coming of the Lord it's everywhere I go people are crying out for the coming of the Lord and the prophet said when that little Remnant goes to calling out to God what's what happens he told us what to look for it's all laying in the message that we just leave laying around there'll be a national Showdown there'll be a power that's never been seen before the trouble of it is it's going to be too late for them then the doors will be closed so remember we're at the end time see pray the world don't know what it is the world don't know what it is but you know we know what it is why he told us what to look for what is it what is it investigating judgment annual Angels one of these UFOs what is it we know it's investigating judgment Angels you see how at the Pentagon and all about how it comes right down the intelligence and how they came brother Ben snaps his fingers and go like a Flash and be gold pulled away from everything that they've got to see they don't realize what it is let them think whatever they want to they call it flying saucers or whatever they don't know see they don't know but you do we know he told us what to look for huh I pulled this out of the news in a rare public U.S Congress hearing help for the first time in 50 years a top defense official talked low-toed lawmakers that an increasing number of UFOs have been reported in the sky over the past 20 years since the early 2000s we have seen an increasing number of unauthorized or unidentified aircraft or objects in military controlled training areas and training ranges and other designated airspaces since 2000 we have seen an increase of unidentified objects but we know he told us what to look for blackouts blackouts isn't it strange that not long ago the prophet said that the East Coast the big blackout they couldn't understand it Texas blacked out last week they can't understand it don't you realize that's a sign don't you know the nations are breaking this was in their Homeland these signs are indicating that we're at the end the same time it's blacking out don't you know that's a sign that the prophet said that there shall be light at the evening time there should be light come forth in the evening time when the blackouts and the things are going the way they are now look at it just how I blacked out the pope just came over remember the Tabernacle when you got the tapes I guess all of you take them how that the Lord showed there that day in the Tabernacle exactly where those churches would be and how they would be and I had them drawn out on the Blackboard up there and them Church Ages which you see here drawn out in a book and if the Holy Spirit didn't come down in a big Pillar of Fire it went to the back wall back there and drawed them out himself with three or four hundred people sitting there looking at it and just as the pope started over here the moon somehow blacked out and they took pictures the same way that it was and drawn up here on the platform they took the same pictures of the moon and the moon types of church now he's made the trip over here on the 13th walk 13 steps served communion to the 13th to a nation that's number 13 and blackouts coming everywhere don't you see where we're at we're at the end times scoffers rise in the last day saying there's no difference in the time than it was then when our fathers fell asleep but when you see these things begin to happen raise up your head get ready something could happen at any time Christ come for his church in the time in the time of blackouts ABC News June 2022 a summer of

before the covid-19 pandemic politicians and the public are hardly aware of that far reaching risk a blackout would catch us almost completely unprepared it made them but not us he told us what to look for that same time it's blacking out don't you know that's a sign that the prophet said but there shall be light about the evening time thou be a light come forth in the evening time when the blackouts and things are going the way they are now to them it's an energy crisis but to us oh God thank you Lord to us he told us what to look for it's a sign when these things begin to happen there shall be a light come forth shall come to pass in that day that shall not that the light shall not be clear nor dark but shall be one day we shall be known to the Lord not a day nor night but it shall come to pass it at the evening time it shall be light he said it shall be light in the evening time there will be a sign rise in the evening time there will be a sign rise in the evening time don't miss it friends don't miss it there shall be a light rush in the evening time foreign he told us what to look for now me and brother John was eating lunch earlier today and I showed him a picture on my phone of a son is that right brother and I said brother John is that a sunset or a sunrise well he guessed it but he said I don't really know but I'm going to say it's a sunrise I said well you're right but I said you see you can ask 10 people and you'll get an answer from different people some will say it's a sunrise some will say it's a sunset it's most people that's honest will say I don't know or at least they'll guess now you guys are quiet I'm used to the South you know that's true friends is that not true you see a picture of a son if you don't know what direction the guy was standing in when he took the picture you really don't know if it's a sunrise or a sunset why it's the same Sun amen you take a picture of a son you show it to 10 different people someone say it's a sunrise some will say it's a sunset why you can't tell it apart but the same s-u-n gives the same issue in light and the same s-o-n gives the same son light so the same the same su-n that rises in the morning and gives its life is the same s-u-n that sets in the evening time and gives the same light not another light the same light and you can't tell the difference between the two why can't you tell the difference between the two because it's the same the same suing gives the same Su in life and the same son gives the same son light now the same son it would give the same light God promised I will restore saith the Lord all the years I'll send back another church in the last days and I will restore the original Power again in the evening time it shall be light what is the light it's not the s-u-n it's the so in down in the heart I promise it down in the heart of that tree no matter how many branches just pruned thy will come forth the Royal Seed of Abraham God promised it God will do it he said he would do it it shall be light again about the evening time the s-o-n will peep out again it shall be light the same s-o-n the same s-o-n that was revealed in flesh at the morning time back there will be revealed again in the evening time the same way the son appearing in the morning in flesh is the same son appearing in the evening time in flesh the morning son appeared in the flesh of the groom the evening son appears in the flesh of the Bride he's just he's just he's just changed his mask y'all know about wearing masks don't you we wore them for two years about drove us crazy didn't we I was telling brother John I was over the store and I stopped in to get some gas I was going somewhere to preach and I went in and I was standing there by the Tater chip wreck and this guy comes walking in he must have been a local everybody there was mass going to come walking in with a mask on the cashier you know she she goes she goes why John you've changed your mask when she said that it was like a boat of electricity went through me how about shaded shouted past the Tater chips because I realized MTC that's all he done sister sister that's all he done took God was veiled in a mass called Jesus and in the evening time the same anointing that was upon the same anointing that was about Jesus it's now upon his brand it's just changed his mask but we know it's him how do we know it's him he told us what to look for in the days as it was in the days of I know I'm reading a lot but I want you to know this is what he said in the days it wasn't the days I saw them the set into the world in the time that the son of man is being revealed the sorry the very same gospel that was preached on the day of Pentecost the very signs that followed for 30 some odd years after that down in the church has returned back to the church again falling right down to the end when did Rebecca find Isaac in the evening time called her to be the bride he called her to be the bride in the evening time it shall be light in the evening time the way of Glory he shall surely find in the Waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins and the Holy Ghost shall surely enter in the evening lights have come it is a fact that God and Christ our war the harmony think about this I've been studying on the message the harmony between the God God and the son the father and the son the harmony between the father and the son and the bride and the groom the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything that was first showed him by the Father John 5 19. this harmony this harmony that was between the father and the son now exist between the groom that's right and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord well brother Daryl I thought only a prophet had thus saith the Lord well I'm sorry I'm sorry you didn't know that the bride has it too the son of man Ministry in the bride oh God help us Lord the bride has the mind to Christ she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose that was the beginning of it and now she stayed right on into the bride light the bride light the evening light has come the broad light the son that peeped out in the morning is now peeping out in the evening time oh my God hallelujah these signs shall follow them thou not belong to the Methodist of the Baptist or to the Pentecostals but these signs shall follow them that believe and he knows Believers there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics to make the church live and move in the power of his resurrection or do you love him Hallelujah Hallelujah oh my oh my let me just skip some of this I guess got so much when God came to Adam his bride for his side he said she's fleshing my flesh and bone in my bone is that right when God give Christ his bride the spirit gave the Flesh and the bride was was piercing he was pure he was pierced in the side under his heart and water blood and Spirit came forth that become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone we are the Flesh and Bones the bride will be the Flesh and Bones of Christ exactly they are that is his bride he told us what to look for we are not a denomination we are not an organization we are not just man followers but we are born in flesh of Jesus Christ would the bride have a Ministry with the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it's the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure she she consists she consists of Apostles plural prophets plural teachers plural evangelist plural pastors plural not one man that's all five offices that's contrary to the message of the hour Amen brother you might as well say Amen or else one it's the truth friends don't you see we have people today who's trying to shut down the five-fold ministry but the very Prophet that God sent to tell us these things told us there will be don't aren't you thankful for a pastor aren't you thankful for somebody like brother John who will stand here and tell you the truth thank God for God God pastors who watch over the flock amen God bless you brother John gate breaks and brother breaks with everything that's in you he told us what to look for he told us he would have a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of his Saints amen she's got a Ministry it's a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble people won't know what to look for they're looking for everything they're looking for everything they're running here they're running there they're doing this they're doing that they're getting on the Internet they're looking at their website looking at that website that he told us what to look for amen is that true God called Messiahs amen buckle up these are some good quotes right here put on your spiritual seat belts hang on now this is true this is true God called Messiahs God called us somebody say us God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God Like Jesus was God's high priest we become a lesser priest Jesus was God in the fullness God in the fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciled the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some science oh my says do you see it the God that was in Christ that made him the Messiah comes into the church and makes them the science the same thing he did is in his church the same thing he did is in his church the same thing he did is in his church the same power he had is in his church the same power he had is in his church and his church becomes his dominion and he's King over the Dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name what are we doing watering the anointing with our praise the anointing that's going to take us to him there you are messiah's Messiahs little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed off of what the main one anointed off the great one we're not an organization we are not a denomination we ain't even church members we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his life power of his power anointing of his anointing she is him expressed what did the woman that the whale say we know when the messiah's coming he'll do these things I said I am he that speaks to you he's not coming sis he's here and I say to you friends the things we Vlog for and look for it's not something that's coming it's right Among Us now see he'll know it'll never do us no good till we receive it we'll check it in last night over at the hotel was talking to the to the man that was checking Us in me and brother John let's tell them about my father who died of Alzheimer's it was so sad 84 year old when he died in the last months of his life couldn't even speak he just laid put diapers on him and they had a little Christmas party we had him in a alzheimer's unit and they had a little Christmas party for the patients and they brought out all these packages and I was there with my daddy they called his name James Ward that's holding up this package package for James Ward he never moved you know why he didn't know who he was Johnny didn't know if they was calling his name but it meant nothing to him because he didn't know and I said over here sir over here I said look here Daddy you better raise up got a present for you but you just laid there because he didn't know who he was no matter how rich and how good these things are that's laying in this message gifts for my father Revelations from her father do we receive them until we receive them they're just quotes they're just quotes oh God help us Jesus the things he told us he said there'll be earthquakes in many different places it's a sound but I was looking the puppet said the Earth will be shaken with divers which is different places many different earthquakes big earthquakes and great volcanoes will take place and I was looking I actually said that quote I was just looking I pulled up some things do you know that in the last two years just since 2020 there has been 32 earthquakes that was greater 7.0 on the Rector scale 7.0 is a major earthquake in the last two years 32 earthquakes over 7.0 on the Rector scale in the last 90 days earthquakes in many different places in the last 90 days 1014 a 5-0 earthquake in Hawaii 1013 6.4 earthquake New Guinea 10.107 a 4.4 earthquake in Oregon 10-6 a 4.9 earthquake in Alaska 10-5 A 5.6 earthquake in Iran Hawaii New Guinea Oregon

the Antarctic Ridge that's just in the last 90 days since 2020 there has been 60 I think it is let me see if I've got it no I don't have a wrote down but I'm just going from memory 60 62 000 I think it is earthquakes but my Lord if it's 10 that's a lot he said what are you saying I'm trying to say this friends he told us what to look for and it's not something that's coming it's here and I was looking at this you know what they're saying I said it's a myth that California will fall into the ocean really they said it's a myth that the Earth would open up and swallow people really did not the bible say that that happened they don't even know what they're talking about that's right but you know he told us what to look for amen it's not something that's coming friends it's something that's here his bride with the authority of the word when Jesus came give me just a few more minutes when Jesus came to the coast of caesarea he Philippa he asked the disciples said whom do this whom do they say I the son of man am some said they are John the Baptist or some said you're alive so Jeremiah or one of the prophets some say you're this and some say you're that and he said unto him let whom say ye that I am you see friends it's got to be a personal revelation you've got to know him for yourself and Simon Peter actually said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and he said blessed art thou Simon about Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell should not Prevail against it that word Prevail means to be superior in strength and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on the Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose on the Earth shall be loosed in heaven he gave Peter the keys to the kingdom with the power to bond and loose by the keys is that right now we know friends that the key it wasn't a brass key that he had cut at Walmart it wasn't a literal key that he took off his side and handed to Peter but that key see the key it represents the sense The Keeper of the keys has the power to open and shut the word class it's figured to be used in the New Testament to denote power and authority of various kinds the key I'll give you the keys what he's actually saying to Peter is I give you the power and the authority to bind and to loose you see when you're holding the key in your hand you have the power and the authority to lock or unlock to open or close because you possess the power when we left Chattanooga the last thing I came back from my daughter was her eyesight and she was starting to see when we'd leave and I started telling the people that that Jessica was starting to see again she'd been blinded from the accident she struck by the train had a severe brain injury left her blind and all kinds of problems and all of it came back except her eyesight she's still blind but I kept telling him she'd see again and somebody's doing the video you know what I'm talking about and so when we went back to when we was leaving Chattanooga you know I said I told him I said Jessica's starting to see and they said well that's nice Mr Ward you know we it's just like that's just wishful thinking of a father so we left and we went home and she started seeing real good so we went back down for a checkup and when we got off the elevator because the last thing we talked about was her seeing when we got off the elevator it was just like family we'd been down there for five weeks with her there at Chattanooga and when we got off the elevator and they said oh it's Jessica it's Jessica and they all come running around us you know and they said can she see can't she see and I took my keys and I pitched them out there and I said Kai it's a little nickname I gave her from she's little I said Kai pick up Daddy's keys and when she went over and picked up them key spreads they were screaming and crying they grabbed our necks and shook our hands it was the most mobile it was so wonderful but see here's the thing I want to say to you she went to pick up the keys because her daddy said she could pick him up and she had the means to do it with and Jesus gave Peter the keys he told Peter pick up the keys Peter and Peter had the understanding of what the father was saying Jessica picked up the keys because she had the revelation of what her father was telling her that he wanted him to do and Peter picked up the keys with the power and the authority and in the last days there's again the prophet said there's another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age foreign voice not The Written Letter not the written word a voice speak the word when a Son of God by faith takes the word of God into his heart and speaks it back up on his lips it's just the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Jesus said if ye shall say if ye shall say what is it when you're out from under Babylon when you're out from under unbelief when you're out from under Superstition when you're out from under all these things and you're filled with God's own life your voice is his voice you are the prophet said I spoke it listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last day what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word and they are saying it now then I say to you friends with the power and the authority given to us as believers speak to that thing that torments you speak to that demon speak to that cancer come on somebody speak to that sickness speak to that weakness by the power and the authority of God's word we speak the name of Jesus Amen he told us what to look for he told us these signs shall follow us it's not something that's coming it's here death and life is in the power of the tongue it's time we speak amen when a voice speaks what does it denote it denotes life Hallelujah amen death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof amen Hallelujah love you it's the end time seedside he told us what to look for and we see it for truly We Believe o God that will not belong to we see him whom we've loved and longed to see and the great Ransom Church of God will stand redeemed in His image oh for the last day when the Trump shall sound and the dead begins to rise and we're called up with him to meet the Lord in the air we long for that great events Prophet said the next thing that happens the next thing to happen is the catching away of the church he told us what to look for I'm not looking for another messenger I'm not looking for another message I'm not looking for another whether a great event or but it's a changing of our bodies he told us what to look for these things are happening friends right here the UFOs the blackouts even our nation now is acknowledging the UFOs they're acknowledging the blackouts Russia doing what they're doing down in

his own are you ready do you love him are we a blessed people today we might not have ten dollars in our name but we're rich in the mercy of almighty God I know I read you a lot of quotes but I just wanted you to know this is what he said this is all laid in the message for his and he told us this is what we are to look for and we see it blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for the year the hour that we're now living in what a privilege it is Friends when the world's teaching their kids all kinds of Filth and all kinds of nonsense and all kinds of insanity we can sit and teach our children truth of God's word with an anointing that will change their bodies oh do you love him tonight the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover do you believe him let's bow our heads I trust I've not kept you long if I have forgive me oh Heavenly Father how we thank you Lord Jesus hell we thank you Lord God Lord that there's been a man among us Lord who has turned on the light oh God how our hearts Lord rejoice in knowing Lord that these things are not just some man's ideal but it's thus saith the Lord the message of the hour and father I pray Lord Jesus for our loved ones Lord and our children God oh God May there not be a one left behind that our lives be so surrendered to you Lord let our lives be so salty that our loved ones will long for that for Lord as it was in the days of Noah he went for the saving of his household Lord and oh God even so let it be now God that our burden would be upon our loved ones and our children and those God who are outside the protection of the umbrella of the Holy Spirit for truly Lord the Judgment Reign is fixing to fall oh God May there not be a one left
