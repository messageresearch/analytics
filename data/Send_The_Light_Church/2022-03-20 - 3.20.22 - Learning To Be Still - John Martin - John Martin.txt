and lord that through the word being preached today that you would minister to the very needs and desires of our heart lord amen as we commit it all to you and give you the glory for it in advance for we ask these things in jesus precious name amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of psalms 46. psalms 46 we appreciate very much um our our musicians our uh those that clean the church those that do sunday school that lead the worship those that laboring in prayer because without that we wouldn't have what we have today and so we appreciate each one and appreciate god in you amen god in the church um we want to uh take our text from verse 10 and 11 of psalms 46 but if it's okay i want to start with verse number one and and just read the whole chapter because it's just so good the bible says god is our refuge and our strength he's a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be moved and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with swelling thereof there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacle the most high god is in the midst of her amen god is here she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the heathen rage the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge sheila come behold the works of the lord what desolations he have made in the earth he maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the earth he breaketh the bull and cutteth the spear and sunder he burneth the chariots with fire and i'm taking our text from these verses here be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge sheila you may be seated amen we want to entitle this message learning to be still learning to be still and for a subject knowing god in our present situations brother branham said man has always had that habit of looking in the past and seeing god oh yeah god was there god was there god was there or looking into the future that god would do this god will do that but when we're going through our tests and our trials and our situations in life where we really really want god on the scene it's hard for us to recognize where god is at that's why we need to learn to be still recognize them sometimes we just often i should say not sometimes often we get anxious we get bothered we get going in a direction that's other than this is what god wants us to do so it's all about having god more in our personal lives that's what this this message is about but these words be still were two words that were often used with seven children in our home from the time they were start we started dressing them to the time they were walking out the door we were saying those words be still so i can dress you be still before you walk out the door and tell me where you're going their words were often used to bring about an order to the situation when there was perhaps confusion or some kind of commotion we would use those words and today we can use those words in this same fashion sometimes the children would lose focus and hearing those words stand still be still would give them a focus wherever their minds were at i remember when i was really wanting to understand get some help for raising our children because you know with seven children i wanted all the help i could get i remember when um we were listening to brother joseph branham quite a few years ago we had heard that you know through the message that he he he had his own mind at times and so i i asked him he says what did brother branham do when things got out of hand when things got chaotic and he said well brother brandon would get us and he would just settle us down and then he would he would just settle us down and he would just settle us down i thought wow you don't really need any volumes of book there to figure out how to raise kids you just need to quiet the spirit because the devil can't do a thing unless he's got a vessel to work through sometimes we just need to be still i believe that there are times in our lives that we get so filled with problems and distractions that god wants us to be still he wants us to focus on him and to know that he is the god of our present situation to recognize that he's among us and that he wants to actually be exalted right in the middle of our problems too often we think it's strange when we're going through tests and trials and why has this happened to me and this doesn't seem to be normal but really that's the time that we have an opportunity to be still and let god come in on the scene but it can't be a situation where we just ignore it god can't be exalted when you're ignoring it he wants to hear you testify he's a present help in a time of trouble god is among us he will move because i believe now of course if we don't believe it you don't can't expect it because god doesn't work by the operation of doubts and fears and questions we have to be courageous to say i believe and really believe it from the deaths of your heart i think we get out of position with god too often and we wonder where god is really at right and these there should be times that where should always be abounding in the work of the lord and we're standing still doing nothing and there's times that we should be standing still and knowing that god is in control of our situation and we're anxious trying to get control of this thing we just get on a position i say first and foremost about taking our position back in christ and remain in it the scriptures teach us to submit ourselves unto god first and foremost submit yourself unto god and be clothed with humility amen doesn't matter what you say what you do people are always looking at the clothes they're looking at the spirit the attitude you know is it god is it all about me or is it all about him let jesus christ have preeminence in our lives which is the church right god wants to have preeminence in the church who's the church we are the church whether we're in our personal homes around our jobs or in the car or in this building god wants preeminence amen brandon said in the message law of grace he says no we ought to come to church with the highest reverence did you ever come to church and felt like you really didn't get nothing out of it like i didn't get i didn't feel like i didn't get anything out of that and we we could leave kind of critical kind of being judgmental about the situation and maybe god wanted us there to serve that time but it never comes across our mind of it's always the responsibility of the minister to get me to receive instead of me going and helping the church body it's not all about us all the time sometimes we just we don't come to church with enough reverence and brother brandon says we ought to come to your church with the highest reverence we ought to enter into the church with the with the real saints of god he said like real saints of god excuse me walk over and take our position and keep our minds on christ that's that's that's the highest reverence right there keeping your mind on christ we ought to forsake everything of the world like that and if you are really born again this may cut now just a little bit but you know this is the house of correction amen if you're really born of the spirit of god that's where your heart lays anyways the position of our heart ought to be finding out how we can better please the lord where our mind is at and the message faith with friend says god in prayer god may we tonight take our stand and our position in christ they're like men and women of god sons and daughters of the creator who just spoke the world and it came into existence god we call ourselves christians and can't even believe for our little healings he said what you what or what you promised to give us and he said god forgive us of our stupidity amen we're smart we should be smart enough to believe amen amen may we rise tonight like men and women son and daughters of god i believe god wants us to take our position amen and i'll say yes we've heard in our recent services that it is a position of authority where we use the name of jesus christ christ to claim the promises of god for our lives but it's also a position not just of authority but of trust and submission to where during times we god wants us to stand still and know that he's in charge of the situation that he's going to take care of it that we don't have to get all worked up if you don't really know if god is in control then be still and know that he is god the spirit of truth is always leading us the bible tells us that always but too often we're not in our position to recognize it and we end up doing our own thing taking control of situations how many has been guilty of just having to take control manipulate something say something do something put pressure over here try to do something to get the situation the way you want it god never works like that he's not a he doesn't force by fear he's a gentleman i'm not saying that he won't bring some uh prepare some fish for your journey when you leave them because he will and look i told the men at my work i said look i am guilty of being treated the absolute worst that you could treat me how do i know that because i know how terrible i am and i i am whatever you reap you sow i mean it's just it but i can't demand respect from a person i don't care how much i pay them not that they were being disrespectful i think it was just a comment i made when i was sharing with them about creating an atmosphere keeping the atmosphere a place do it for god and otherwise don't do it for me do it for god do it for god amen we don't want to do our own thing in the message brother bran in the message how can i overcome brother branham says this and and brother uh gideon i don't know if he's watching this morning if he has god bless you he often pipes in sunday mornings but he sent this uh quote over and i wanted to read it it seemed to fit with this morning's message sometimes satan can take you and when you think you're doing the will of god and can make you pro position and you fall for it yes sir you sure can't so i had a text him back says what's proposition mean and then he didn't answer for a while so i went to looked it up and it basically he throws satan throws something at you to get you off into another direction same thing you did with eve so i wanted to finish reading a little bit of this quote he didn't send it but brother ben says now let's just take for instance our sisters they're pretty and he and he can get you to a place that can get you to a place that or god can get you to a place that you let your hair grow out that would be god that we're doing that that you didn't realize this is where satan comes in you didn't realize that you look so nice on you and the first thing you know you get kind of a feeling like you're stuck up like a little above something else and some of you men you know what i mean see and he can take the same thing and proposition it with you that's right he says you've got to overcome that thing just remember you're living for god you have one objective and that's jesus christ outside of that there's nothing else that counts [Music] in the message conference brother branham said and that god has sent his spirit to to lead uh men and women he will never lead you away from the word of god amen never not for a moment he'll lead you right to the word of god because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god so when you're thinking about are you doing the will of god you're being led by god and and somebody's saying hey wait a minute consider this if it's the word of god stay with the word don't go with how you feel i have failed at this so many times when we're all getting to heaven we're all in the rapture we're all there there's not going to be anybody who says yeah i made it here going my own way i made it to the rapture i got off the word now where did i stop going no it was right with the word every word of god everyone that makes that word makes that rapture is living by every word of god that proceeds of the mouth of god we've heard the saying that the world is ever evolving just like the bride is being continuously transformed into the image of jesus christ the world is evolving to the greatest deception and confusion that's ever been known to man they're coming into the image of the beast the church world is falling deeper and deeper into apostasy as we sung that song deeper deeper in the love of christ the world is going deeper and deeper the church world is going deeper and deeper into i'm in need of nothing just finally stepping away from the truth even though some of them are still going to church their heart is not after seeking god that's why they can come to church they never hit the prayer closet why they never enter into the worship of the lord because the heart isn't where it needs to be amen now the scriptures warn us of this evolving and in the last days that the two spirits good and evil life and death knowledge and revelation would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible but that's the only group that can't be there would be many that would be ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge or the full discernment or recognition of the truth which can only come by revelation god's the only one that can give that out you a man to come to church and and hear revelation from god from a man does not exist on the planet man can't give revelation i don't care how anointed man is all revelation comes from god we have to recognize god is here if god's using a man he's he's always used man he chose the foolishness of preaching to save man but it has to be god in the man remember god alone reserves the right to open these eyes your eyes matthew 11 verse 25 jesus at that time jesus answered and said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed or to make known or to take the cover off to them that are babes so i don't care how low you may feel how much you don't feel you know god how much you feel you're uh away if you can just have this humble i need you jesus those are the ones that god has chose to reveal not somebody who who knows everything knows the bible i mean he passed up the pharisees and sadducees of his day the scholar the learned so be a babe this morning i said be obeyed this morning in learning be a babe in in this morning in in humility and what you're clothed with and and being needy and be strong in believing the word even so father for it seemed good nice sight all things are delivered unto me and my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the son and to whom so ever the son will reveal if i said there was 500 in the envelope stash somewhere in this church and i'm telling you all about it and i say it could be it's in the church but there's one person that i told left to ear where it is in the church there would only be one person who was revealed to and that person who is revealed to he could say yes it is in the church but he knows more personally and that's what revelation is it isn't just the outside appearance of it's in the church this is god he's in his word but when it becomes so personal he spoke it to you that's how god wants us to god wants us to see him in our personal life amen and only god can open our eyes in our personal situations but we've got to be looking for them it's one thing to know god and it's another thing to know god in all of our problems right one thing to talk about god and this is what god this is the quotes and this and that and the other but it's another thing to say you know right in the middle of my problems there's god amen amen knowing god differently paul said in philippians 3 10 says that i might know him that i might know him now paul knew christ he knew him for 30 years when he makes this statement amen so what's the big deal he wanted to know god more and that is the key if you want to find god in your in your problems in your in your that the trials that you're going through in your current situation you can't just keep the same old attitude of murmuring and complaining about things that are are negative and wrong and expect to see god more and more in your problems like he's going to honor the negativity look at he said that i might know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings what do they do being made conformable unto his death everything that we're going through is not to make us feel bad or unhappy or to suffer for for wrong reasons it's that when we're hurting we look to jesus and we say jesus you must increase and be exalted i must decrease but too often we get bothered because of the situation and we begin to question where is god and how come he hasn't helped us and why is he leaving why is this happening in my life and we often we try to seek out answers other ways and we all we can do is testify of a god of a past and hope for a future but god wants to be the god of our present situation we've got to learn to be still and know that he's god right now well the world is just going crazy i mean it's going crazy the bride needs to be getting closer to god you want to see god in the church yes you do i want to see god in your life goes both ways easy to come to church and put the pressure on the church your home is a church your life is a church there ought to be testimonies coming out of that amen god alone has the answers to our life's problems there isn't anything that god can't handle he told abraham is there anything too hard for god for the lord he promised that he wouldn't put anything on us that we couldn't handle yet our doubts and our negativity call god a liar he promised to make a way but how does he make that way are we even recognizing the way are we just judging him where you at god where are you at when he said i'll be with you even in you to the end where are you at god we're pulling god on trial because he's not taking care of a problem and god says i have no problem with this problem being here i allowed it to be here i want you to exalt me right now i want you to be still and know that i am god that's why i brought this thing to you hallelujah sometimes we just want the negative things the wrong things out of our life and that's god's job just to be the the do boy of our situation but god wants to be exalted he wants to be appraised not just when we feel good and the song leader did a good job they're playing the favorite songs and you've got the favorite scripture and you just gotta raise and everything's going great in your life but when the bottom falls out he wants to be exalted he wants to be exalted we cannot make it by the knowledge of god alone we cannot make it by what we're presently where we're presently at with god i can't make it i can't say that i have made myself ready and always tore up and bothered about something that's going on that's not what he's that's not what he's marrying that's not what he's what he's calling he's calling for someone that though he slay me yeah i trust him though i'm going through this situation i trust god he's with me i i i may not feel it i may not see it but faith my sixth sense i know it i know it and if you don't know it be still until you do know it amen you can't look at god as some mcdonald's fast food fix my problem real fast it's true like if you fix my problem i'll be happy i'll praise you if you fix my problem well he didn't fix jobs probably right away in fact it got harder it got worse and we don't got a timeline of how long it took but when we read it it's like a story we think oh just well it just happened real quick like if you know three days it was over think about what he went through and yet he maintained he didn't let anything affect him to turn himself away from god that's our brother he's the bride he enoch's the bride elijah's the bride we're the bride we can't be any different we can't be any different see god is calling us to where they're at amen they us without them can't be made perfect so it's not just waiting for time waiting for the world to end waiting for this that no it's there's the waiting the waiting is god waiting on us why i thought he was waiting on the last seat well yes he is but he's waiting on you to go get him god's still waiting on us we got to know god in a greater measure a greater measure than where we're at get to the place where as soon as the trial hits and that satan comes and says you're doomed you're being you're being judged for what god what what you did you're reaping what you you sold or he beats over the head with sickness or some past sin it's time to rise up and testify exalt the lord i know my god he is with me he's not leaving me i've left him but he doesn't leave me right that's why i get on my knees and i say sorry lord sorry for my wrong thoughts sorry sorry for not praying more amen it's me that does the wrong it's never god so if my situation i'm not happy with if it's not where it needs to be is up to me to be still get before the lord they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength get ahold of the presence of god and let him be the god of your situation this thing well i don't know what to do about this and i don't know what to do about that and this thing is happening i just what where's the god that you serve where is the god that you claim to serve it's important to put enough pressure on yourself to get on your knees i don't want you to have pressure to where you feel bad and feel like i failed and feel indifferent and feel like what you know what no have enough pressure to get on your knees and say i know this is my position in christ i need to get here till i get up i know that i know that i know that my god is a present help in a time of need how is god going to be the same yesterday today and forever if you don't have him be present in your life he's not just i know him uh yesterday and i know him of the future but he's a present help in the time of need amen anybody can testify oh yeah i knew god was with me back then and oh yeah i just i knew it all along but but for some reason people still remember your doubts still remember you're complaining still remember your word and still remember your fears god well brother john what are you bringing up the past for look the same thing's going to happen god's going to give you a chance another chance isn't that wonderful that we can say i know that i know that i know and i just love that about god he gives us lots of chances and it's it's more precious than gold but look if we don't get to know god in the present form how are we going to know that we're ready hey look we're not going to make the rapture because we're in the message how many people are in the message that aren't going to make the rapture why ain't that being preached we need to know him need to know more i'm not against not saying nobody don't know him no i'm not saying that i want to know god more i'm standing with paul i want to know him in the in the power of resurrection the fellowship of his sufferings i want to know him in my present need [Music] i want to be like job if he's choosing to slay me i'm still going to testify that i'm still going to exalt him he wants to be exalted among the heathen brother branham said in the message jehovah jireh as we follow this great patriarch abraham in the lesson tonight may we find our position knowing that we are children of abraham by faith in christ we all believe we're we're children of abraham children of god but his prayer is lord even though we are them help me to find my position our position it told your position is to totally trust god for your life that's your position amen no matter what's going on he's still god he's still reigns he's the the god of jacob is our refuge in the message recognizing your day and its message brother and it says and we're looking to him this morning to reveal this context that's written in the book because it is the book of redemption and all that is redeemed in written therein i'm sorry all that is redeemed is written therein may we find our position this morning in the time that we're living if you knew god was sitting next to you what would you do different than you're doing now the greatest thing is we could is recognize that god the realness of god isn't some god that's always out there somewhere if i can't know him here what difference does it know of knowing god out there that can't do me any good i could have all knowledge know all mysteries but if i don't have him here i can't exalt god out there the garbage that's going out in the world i can't change their mind i can't i can't uh get them to stop doing what they're doing if i could i would are you kidding the desire's there but i can exalt him in my life this is the only vessel that i have control over it's the only one where i can stand still long enough and know him to be the god of my life that he's never did me harm that he's never led me the wrong way that it's been me that's always forsaken him to think though that you have control of exalting god and brother brandon says we all could get to that place one mind one accord if we could get to that one position in christ there wouldn't be one feeble one among us brother branham said in the message god keeps his word he says we are unworthy of any of thy blessings but it's because of thy goodness has been extended to us that's why we come humbly asking you today that you will continue to be with us let us find our place in our position in thee lose ourselves and find it lord in thee amen isn't that beautiful and make us that we that i'm sorry make us that which we should be get glory out of the service today before we ask it in jesus christ's name amen i love that position position isn't your where your body is sitting it's where your heart is sitting today is where your heart is at in the message we would see jesus brother brandon says you're in position you put yourself into position by catch this by recognizing him that you're a subject now to see greater things when you get yourself in position with christ now you put yourself in position to see greater things and that's scriptural because he gives more grace to the humble he resists the proud but you put your clothes of humility on and you get humble before him you're in that position now you're going to see christ in your life greater things look i would love to sit here and have a minister come and get such a great revelation said man i never seen that i never knew that that's the greatest thing i'm going to preach that next time i'm up at the pulpit but i would rather have never that and be able to see god in my life presently through all my problems not past god it's past is 20 20 is always 20 20. you can always see god in your past god i want to exalt you for the past god wants to be the god of the i am i am that i am amen tell him that i am that i am amen not that i was but a present help in a time of need do you want a relationship with somebody of the past let me reword that would you like to have a a present relationship with somebody who's dead and gone no no i mean to have a relation brother martin let me just say this because everything can be twisted i say nowadays so brother mark you're going to end up getting married here would you like to have a relationship with somebody of the past that's dead and gone okay with the situations that god has blessed us with in the past they're gone when when paul said forgetting those things which are behind it wasn't just all the bad problems and things the bad things he did they were his victories as well it's important that you hunger for a present relationship and not just one of the past we don't come to church to learn about god in history and we don't come to church to learn about god in prophecy i'm just saying that oh it's coming we come to get god today amen i want god today you ever come to church you want god to speak to you about a certain thing but the preacher didn't say one thing about it wonder if it's because we weren't in position because he said seek ye first the kingdom and all other things will be added and i'm not against desiring god in certain things but you know we ought to come to church with reverence so we don't come to church this is no ouija board here we we come here there's a there's a relationship that we have with god okay and the message the greatest battle ever fought brother brandon says and we are today sitting here and one or another uh or and one or the other power is going to control us we're sitting here today and wonder the other power is going to control us so let's cast out the evil one amen so let it's collectively amen let's cast out the evil one let's collectively take our position like the stars of heaven amen position like the stars you ever look up there is it oh yeah stars gonna be you know you know when you look in the sky you're not gonna see the ocean going up there you might see clouds and you may not see the stars but when those clouds move late at night you won't see the stars and brother branham here is telling us that we should take our position like the stars of heaven in other words you should always be in the same spot amen bouncing all over the place not your testimony bouncing like god is with me god i don't i don't see god well i just wish he would be here you may not say those words but when you start getting frustrated and and bothered and and and and starting to get anxious just remember choose what mary chose she chose the better part she just stood still got before the lord be be like a star look at yourself like a star like a pillar hey man you're in your position when people think of you there is no question what they're thinking this over the weekend as you know i have a pretty big honeydew list and i can't get them all done i i i won't better live that long but i'm still working on them so this weekend i went to go get some wood for some planter boxes and as i was driving away from home depot with this load in my truck i thought brother stan i thought about brother stan telling me one time he got some wood and it came out of his truck and ended up in the middle of the road and another car had stopped and they were shoving it back in there so as i decided to take o23 up when i got to white lake road i stopped everything was fine and then i just i'm talking on the phone with johnny and uh about work of course and and so i hit the pedal but i don't think i gunned it very much but i gunned it enough to where it came out just like it did for brother stan all this wood i mean it you couldn't have put it better in the middle of the intersection if if you tried and it wasn't just like three or four ports no i had a whole the whole thing so another car had stopped and and and they're helping me get it back in there and i'm telling you we put it in there quick real quick said thank you didn't offer any money or nothing because he was they were nice they were nice people and so we did it real quick and i got back in the truck and i'm getting ready to pull off and i get i mean i didn't go 20 feet and the sirens were behind me and the light the the stake trooper had pulled me over so i didn't go very far this incident happened so fast you literally have been at a stoplight much longer than this whole incident happened that's how fast it was and so i i pull up further so he could get behind me but he still didn't want to get over there he stayed to the side and he come over and he talked to me he says well i'm sure you know why i'm pulling you over and i said yes i do yes i do the obvious happened and um he says you should have you know tied it up and where are you going and can i see your driver's license can i see your proof of registration can i see your or your proof of insurance can i see your registration so i got those out and gave it to him and i'm i'm sitting there in the car and don't feel anxious or bad but satan came but satan came and he said you tell him that you could have left me off with a warning you know i thought that was wrong thought i'm here because of a mistake i made so it came it came quick dealt with it quick and i just stood there so he came for a long time how many tickets you write me anyways man i could have been home and bad by then you know so he came back and he said well i'm letting you off the hook for for one reason no there's two reasons one reason is when i look at your record there ain't one thing on it it's important when people look at you to know that you're rock-solid and he says the other reason is i actually never seen it come out but by the time i got there i saw how fast you were cleaning up that mess i couldn't hardly believe it so we're grateful god for god's grace and mercy but remember you may think this is mundane and it doesn't mean anything just going to church and being faithful and praying and really and being there when you're called upon but i'm telling you that's what god is looking for in his bride amen let me finish reading this let's take our position like the stars of heaven as the bible speaks wandering stars over in the book of jude foaming out their own shame and we don't want to be wandering stars wonder if this is right wonder if that is right wonder if it will happen wonder if it could be or how it could be he says don't wander stay like those stars of heaven as real soldiers at the post of duty stand there believing in his life or death in the message does god ever change his word about excuse me does god ever change his mind about his word he said let us bow our heads dear lord jesus we are assembled again in your name which great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of god what is that going to do to bring us into recognition of our position and our place why do some people want the holy ghost to pour out on them how many times have they said because i want to recognize my position in christ it's all about other reasons and i'm not against other reasons but god wants us in our position he wants us in our place he says to bring us into recognition of our position and our place and our responsibilities as being a called people separated from the world dedicated to god granted lord tonight that the blessings of god would guide and direct us into the things that we do and say that it might bring honor and glory to your name amen now god wants to be exalted in our problems he really does number one it takes faith i believe that god is here two we need to learn to be still and identify where he's at okay so you get slapped on the cheek first thing you're going to say is i'm not going to talk to you again it's going to be a while before i talk to you well that's not god that's just how i an eye for an eye and two for just oh nature coming out so where's god in this where god is is be still turn the other cheek that's where god is at god is in love he's in forgiveness he's in mercy that's where god is at but it requires responsibility you got to take your position your place it's not about seeing god with these eyes it's about seeing god with these eyes eyes of faith in exodus chapter 14 verse 13 you know we're not going to have um time to go through this whole thing just pray for me that we can get through the parts that we need to get through because there's a lot of stuff here exodus 14 13 and moses said unto the people fear ye not we know when this happened they they left egypt and egypt was coming after them and they they had no place to go they were boxed in and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today for the egyptians who you have seen today ye shall see them again no more now i want us to believe everything in the old testament is a type of the new testament everything that happened naturally in the old testament is a spiritual type of what happens to us in the new in our lives so there's going to come times that you're boxed in but god wants you to be still and believe don't fear that the problem that you're seeing right now that you have seen that you have dealt with for a while is going to be here no more but you've got to believe it that's the difference i mean god may do some things for your life for a while but afterwards if you don't believe he's going to stop the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace hold your peace hold your horses take a chill pill that's sometimes what we need to hear when we're going through stuff in our lives instead of just letting their mind go to all these imaginable terrible things of negativity that don't bring any honor and glory to jesus christ we need to take our own chill pill just calm down be still he still remains god he wants us to stand still he wants us to know that he's going to take care of this problem but we've got to trust him for it we don't want to just be testifying after it's over i mean i'm i appreciate all testimonies but if we're only going to testify after it's all over i say like this god wants us closer to him he wants a present relationship with us not a constant past but a present relationship and that's why this ministry here is always pulling about you seeking god pulling to get more of god hunger for more of god to receive more of god it isn't to come against uh your your thought process that you don't have god not trying to belittle that it's just we ought to be coming here with testimonies of everything that that god is doing in the middle of your trials and that it's happened so many times that we know what the end's going to be amen we know what the end's going to be turn with me if you would to ephesians chapter 1. god wants to save every one of us from our complex difficult situations he wants to be a present help amen he wants us to know him in present tense if i could just say it like this we know god in the past he saved us we know he promised us a future i know the thoughts i think towards you to give you an expected end but god wants us to know him in present tense and the best way to do that is get him on the inside it's bubbling it's bobbling it's bubbling so it don't matter what happens he's still bubbling amen ephesians 1 verse 16 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and the revelation in the knowledge of him god wants us to know him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling so what has he really called you to do just be saved make the rapture i'm sorry friends if you keep looking in the future you're going to miss where god wants you to be today god wants to be exalted in your life today don't wait till tomorrow don't wait till next week today is the day of exaltation this is today's the day that god wants to be exalted today is the day of salvation he wants to save us from our present situation we have a chance all the time to give god glory and it's by representing a a son or a daughter that's in position who's trusting god knowing that god's with them don't know how it's going to work out but you believe it with all your heart god sees your faith he honors your faith and he delivers you from your present situation verse 19 and um okay the isa verse 18 the eyes of your understanding be in the light that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who do believe that he's a he's presently with us oh i want to know that that power who believe according to what the working of his mighty power god is working we don't serve a god of the dead which he wrought in christ and he raised from the dead and said it is at his own right hand in heavenly places far above all principalities and powers and might dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but that but also in that which is to come and he had put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head of all things to the church which is the body the fullness of him that filth all in all so god if god is presently with you and if he put all things under his feet when you're staring at how bad things are going you don't know what to do and you don't know which direction to go you need to recognize those things are under his feet let's see if that power isn't working in you if you're not believing that how do we know the power is working you're believing it that's that's simple if you believe it it will happen ephesians 3 verse 14 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven is and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with his might by the spirit by his spirit in the inner man that's why we don't want to be talking about what we see these eyes the outer man looking at the problem looking at the bills looking at the sickness looking at whatever we're looking at he strengthened us on the inside to believe that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith not going to believe he's not going to be there that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breath the length of death and height now i just want to say this christ dwells in our hearts by faith now if you're not going to believe i said he's not going to be there and i'll say it like this so you understand more clearly he won't be there in your present situation you've got to believe for him in your present situation now unto him that is able he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we would ask or even think according to the power that worketh in us not the pastor not brother branham you you what power is working in you not the power of abracadabra not that power the power to believe when the devil tells you something you don't go with it that power now unto him be glory in the church of jesus christ throughout all ages without an amen stand still and know that he is god of our situation amen if i were to ask you a question do you know jesus christ each one of you would undoubtedly say yes of course i know jesus christ as god as i'm a son of god and i i know him and i would never doubt that myself if you would say that but is that enough maybe we could ask the question this way how much do you know jesus christ remember peter was going to be given the keys to the kingdom and he knew by revelation that jesus was the christ the son of the living god he had that revelation there was another time in peter's walk that most of the believers had actually left the church and jesus asked his disciples a personal question he said will you go away also the majority left the church but what about you and simon peter answered lord to whom shall we go thou is the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ that christ the son of the living god so here's another testimony and he stayed with him but when it comes to a much stronger test stronger than just a decision about what you're going to do when your brothers and sisters leave the church it's a test that comes to every one of us it's something that every one of us will go through if we never have a split in this church and by the grace of god we never want to have a split or or or have uh people leave but every one of us this test is coming and that's the test of being left alone and what are you going to do when you're alone and it may come many times it's the test of standing alone and knowing that god is presently with you to where you could say where would i go thou alone has the words of eternal life you can't doubt it amen when they came to take jesus away peter he knew who jesus was but you know he wouldn't stand still he took out his sword of like a lot of us do sometimes when we feel something's wrong we're going to take our sword out and we're going to start chopping up people who say things who do things to us he drew his sword he knew jesus as the son of god but he didn't stand still long enough to know that he was the god of that situation and this is what's really important god wants us to know him in our present situations and when it seems calamity is happening everywhere he doesn't want us to run he doesn't want us to draw the sword and start cutting things and being negative about his situation jesus said put up the sword you get that sword out you start cutting that's what's going to happen to you he didn't say he says you you you killed the sword you die with the sword we reap what we saw peter stand still he still couldn't accept that what was happening that god was still in control every one of us have been to this place now we're talking about a story that's in the bible but every one of us has been to this place and god wants us to really recognize him in present tense i'm telling that's the testimony that we need to have that's what we need to have day in and day out god is presently with me and the heart of the test the harder to stand don't be satisfied with how much you know god today there's more of god to know oh my wish i had so much to say there's going to be times that people are going to fly off the handle and you're going to want to draw that sword try to correct the situation put that person in their place and say this is the how it really went in daylight and they shouldn't have said this and they were wrong about that and you're you're going to pull that sword but you're out of position you're out of position you're not letting god be magnified in you because you're trying to be god of the situation god wants to be magnified not you he's not going to share his glory with you put your trust in him he's a present help in the time it's all about learning learning to be still learning to see god there it ain't you know a critic could stand up and say well i've had all these problems in my life this has happened to me and i never seen god well that's a true statement but did you believe that he was going to be there in your situation or did you just believe it before it happened but then after it happened because peter did say hey i'm i've forsaken everything for you i'll do whatever you tell me to do i'm yours but you've got to believe during the trial and and i'm telling you you don't just get that faith you got to spend time seeking the lord develop that relationship learn through the small things that you're going through to trust them the small what you're doing is you're developing the i trust you lord i trust you lord and before not you're going to have a harder thing though you cannot see how it's going to happen you know that you know that god is faithful to his word can i have just a little more time all right daniel chapter 3. oh daniel chapter 3. well verse 15. we know that i'm just going to read it try to fast this is the story of the three hebrew children now when they heard this sound they were supposed to bow their knees and they didn't right and in verse 16 shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said unto the king oh nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this manner if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand oh lord but if not it made known unto the o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image with allah set up so here it is they came into this situation their face in a fiery furnace and they could not testify we do not know at this time whether god's going to deliver us from the furnace we don't know but i still know he's in control one thing is for sure i know he is going to deliver us from your hands if it's through death it's through death if it's if it's not through the uh if i gotta go through the first i'm not gonna die he's still gonna deliver us from you and that's exactly what happened you don't know your future you don't know what's going to happen when you're going through your trials and that's okay you don't need to be god of that right you just need to believe in the god that you serve that you are not going to flinch and go this way or go that way and let some little thing keep you from obeying the word of god you know nobody's going to you know as it were god's probably not going to arrange it to where there's some real furnace and you're going to be be faced to go in there in there no it's not going to happen like that it's going to be another trial amen amen and satan's going to say hey you know this is the easy way you don't have to do that and you got to stay with the word stay with the word regardless of what happens stand up like stars i want to look at meshech bendigo and shadrach when i look at them i look at them as stars not wandering stars floating here and there they knew their position with god they would not be moved and god honored that faith he god doesn't honor a a a double-mindedness unstableness one day i'll serve god in the next we just kind of forget about it you can't go there you got to take a stand for god and keep growing in christ keep seeing the present god growing in your life amen it's not about coming to church and feeling better when you leave because you know you honestly you could watch something bad and feel better in your flesh look at the wrong thing hear the wrong thing talk about the wrong thing rejoice in the wrong thing and feel better it's not feelings it's about a relationship with jesus christ lord help us all right i'm i just so you know i know it's late i just want to do one more if i could it's matthew chapter 8 turn with me there don't be satisfied with a god of history a god of the future know him presently remember when brother brandon said eliezer couldn't get rebecca to sit still long enough to dress her remember he said that everybody gets an idea they're going to do this they're going to do that they're going to hear it set still i love this story it's romans chapter eight a roman commander of a hundred men he was beseeching jesus for just one of his men he had a burden he had a hundred he didn't say i'll forget we'll just get the next one in you now fire him get another one in here he had a burden he loved his people verse 5 of matthew chapter 8. is that what i told you all right i told you everything and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying unto saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously that grievously tormented and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him that should have been just i wonderful you know what who wouldn't want jesus to come to their house i mean like yeah are you kidding if he comes to my house he ain't going to anybody else's after church but he wasn't selfish he didn't think like that in fact he thought i'm unworthy and the centerian answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed now notice he came to church for one thing the word the word for i am a man now he goes to me this is the greatest revelation of a man that is in position and knows the importance of position from a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it i mean this is the way we operate here in rome and jesus heard it and he marveled no any yeah he marveled excuse me and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel wow this must have been a very powerful thing that happened i mean we talk about we hear brothers come up here and they give testimonies of things that happen by faith and here jesus the author of faith is saying i have not found so great of faith it wasn't even a believer here was a man just that understood the power position he knew that god was over everything and that if he would just speak the word he he would believe it there wouldn't be no battle there wouldn't be no he just believe it because he understands that when he speaks to others they're under subjection they come they go they do it isn't like having a bunch of kids you tell them what to do and they don't listen i'm sorry that is not right god don't want a bunch of kids that don't listen to him if god says your place is in church you'd be in church whatever god says you do that's your position you dig into that message rapturing faith in there it tells us how to act what we should do don't make everything lighter make it heavier get closer to god i love this and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth if you're not going to see god in your present tense you could be heading right towards tribulation and not even recognize it this man was in his position we have a choice be still know that he's god that's your position no matter where you're at what's happening take this message and apply it this is my prayer and hope for you that you could come back to church and begin to testify that you see god in the middle of what you're going through don't wait till it's over right in the middle i say this don't make the mistake of predicting the future don't do that meshach didn't do that bendigo they didn't do that but you still can't testify that god's going to deliver you amen to stand together remember naaman naaman got really bothered and upset because he was asked to go wash in a dirty river and thought he was he was he was more worthy and he failed to recognize god presently with him and there was that humble servant that pointed him back to the word hey the word said this just do it and he said the same he says if god would add if he would ask you the man of god would ask you did some great thing you probably would have did it right yeah because of recognition who doesn't want to do great things for recognition but it's when you can just what nobody knows obey the word of god no matter how humiliating it is god will bless you learning to lean i'm learning to lean i'm learning to lean on jesus [Music] gaining more power than i've ever seen i'm
