Praise You Jesus Praise You Lord amen hallelujah what an honor to have them reign in our hearts to take control I I've never met a man in my life who had good control of his life a man at his very best is all vanity the Bible says and we need the Lord to take full reign of our life amen amen well praise the lord it's so good to be together again midweek in the service and just um as brother Ron had made mention a little filling station that we can come and just receive a little something from God that will help us and our journey amen we were talking a couple Services ago about the coming of the Lord and we needed to make ourselves ready bride has a promise in the Bible that she will make herself ready and she takes the word and applies it to her life and gets dressed in the the garments of the word if I could say it like that but it doesn't come easy she's going to have to cry out to God she's going to have to seek God because she's got two Powers well a power working against her she got the power of the enemy and the power of this old nature that's not wanting to cry out that's not wanting to reach forth and uh she's got to press through that until God comes um we want to talk about the bride's humility today and I believe we need that in order to be accepted by the groom amen amen so let's um we can turn to two scripture readings one's going to be in the Book of Revelations chapter 3 and then one is going to be in first Peter chapter 5. amen God bless our visitor in the back and and um we pray that God will bless you amen amen let's look to the Lord in in a word of prayer before we begin to read his word Heavenly Father we come to you as humbly as we know how today knowing that Lord our dependency is upon you to come into this part of the service as the word is being ministered as your Bible is being read Lord we need the quickening of your Holy Spirit to unveil yourself to us Lord we pray that we could all be in the position to receive the very message that you have for us Lord we ask that you would if our hearts are not prepared that you would prepare our hearts Lord we want to receive what you have for us and I pray Lord that you would forgive us of our sins our trespasses our doubts our carnality our murmuring our complaining our our anything that has been displeasing to you we just pray that you would cover us now with your blood and Lord allow us to be in that position to receive from you the things that we have need of Father we commit the service with all of our needs into your hand and we wait further in San B we ask it all now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Revelations chapter 3 starting with verse 15. I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so when so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot look at how many times he makes mention of that he really hates lukewarmness I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and miserable poor blind and naked says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Remnant that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes half that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten so what do we need to do be zalius therefore and repent amen and then in the book of First Peter chapter 5. we're going to read verses 5 through 7. likewise ye younger I'm sorry you just find your scriptures you find the scriptures First Peter chapter five sometimes I go too fast likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and he giveth grace to the humble humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt You In Due Time cast all your cares upon Him for he careth for you amen God bless you may be seated the bride's humility now we're all wearing clothes today clothes are the outside garments that we wear for the purpose to hide the shame of our bodies just as we see one another's natural clothes we all have spiritual clothing that we wear and according to the scriptures there is a proper clothing that covers the shame of our carnal nature right and this is what we're reading about in the Bible Jesus wanted us not to have the shame of our nakedness to appear before him he wanted us to come to him for the clothing amen amen and and and and and to be properly dressed for his coming because unless we're dressed for his coming we're not going to go away with the bride amen now we are required to be dressed in these clothes for his return and now depending on what Spirit we have upon us at the moment is what clothing we're wearing and remember this that our spiritual clothes are seen by everybody some are more uh some are more uh in tune and some are a little more oblivious but Jesus said Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they're raving wolves and Jesus is really speaking to us about the inner man amen amen he's wanting the inner man to to to to repent not just put some clothes on the outside and say I'm a Christian or just act a certain way a certain time and feel it but he's looking for the inside right now the Bible tells us that we're going to be like Jesus when he returns we're predestinated to that so we're going to be in the image of God the thing is that there is a difference today A distinct difference between us and God there's a difference between the groom and the bride The Head and the body God in the church the Bible tells us about these differences even though they're to be the same the bride is to be subject to the groom the body follows the head the word of God is preached and the church obeys it so you see that there is a a positional difference between the bride and the groom even though they are the same Ephesians verse 5 verse 23 tells us for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wise be subject unto their own husbands and everything yet they are one right a husband and wife are one Christ and the church is one yet there is a distinct difference we're in the same image but we play different roles Jesus said you have not chosen me bride I have chosen you amen we love him today because he first loved us he is the Potter we are the clay he is the creator we are his the creation and because of this he requires us to dress with proper clothes these clothes are required to be worn at all times we never want to come to church without having these clothes on we never want to approach god without these clothes we really don't ever want to be without these clothes now we're invited to approach God there's many scriptures in the Bible Jesus said come on to me all ye that labor and a heavy laid and I will give you rest he's inviting us to come to him he said ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find not and it shall be open unto you and turn with me if you would or watch on the screen here Hebrews chapter four I want to read just the three verses there Hebrews 4 verses 14 through 16. we are invited to come to God seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession so we have someone there that is in our behalf amen for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was at all points tempted just like we are yet he was without sin amen Amen Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in a time of need the bid is to come boldly before the throne of grace but what does it mean to come boldly what does that really mean does it mean I have a right to come before the throne I know you're awful quiet it shouldn't be a quiet night I want to take a look at a couple Believers in Luke Chapter 18. that actually came before the throne last service we read a parable and it was the first part of 18 that meant ought to always pray and not faint but to be diligent to be desperate and when you pray make sure that you're not trusting in yourself you're not trusting that you're just a little bit better than somebody else or that somebody else is a little bit worse than you you don't want that type of thinking when you approach God now let's pick that up right after that Parable see this really connects Luke 18 verse 9 and he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and that they despised other Soul let me just say it like this nobody's going to say Hey you know I'm righteous you know we know we've kind of been trained and we're not like that but we can have that tendency of thinking we've not just requirement and therefore I'm I'm something special right now and especially when we look at somebody else who's not doing good and then kind of look and all of a sudden we feel comfortable because they're not doing good and it's it's again trusting in yourself we don't want to approach god with those thoughts the two men two men went up to into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a Publican so they're both approaching you know the Throne of of of Grace right now and a Pharisee was someone who thought they were more special than certain other people let's just say it like that they they talked about uh how how good they were they they acted like that they tried to profess it out there but but their their spiritual clothes were really really if I could say it like this easy to identify a Pharisee and verse 11 the Pharisees stood and he prayed thus with himself so he's quiet prayed with himself God I thank you that I am not like other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican were you ever thankful that you weren't like somebody else come on that's what this Pharisee did have you ever been in the prayer room looking down your spiritual nose at somebody in the kind of thinking well they got a real need let's just be honest you think about the bad they've done or or you can say I've never done what they've done and that's how this Pharisee was he was truly thankful that he wasn't like that person but that is what he was approaching god with and it was the wrong clothing he said I fast twice a week look what I'm bringing I fast twice to eat I give tithes of all my possessions of all that I possess now the Republican he's standing afar off now look how he's dressed he would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but he smote his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner fulfilling be zealous therefore and repent I tell you Jesus said this man went down to his house Justified just as if he'd never done it rather than the other for everyone that exalts himself shall be obasan and he that humbles shall shall be exalted so I ask you what does it mean to come boldly before the throne of grace because it looked like this Pharisee was really coming boldly before the throne of grace but he wasn't coming boldly he was coming arrogantly this Publican is who came to the throne of grace boldly amen and the proof was it is that he received justification where the other man did not now that Pharisee he went home and he probably thought he was justified he thought he probably thought God just answered his prayer and everything was right but I'll tell you it was an arrogant Spirit God resists the proud right and he gives Grace unto the humble our approach should always be humbly we need to forget about comparing ourselves with others you know a lot of times when we're praying the devil likes to just bring people into our minds when we're praying and when the devil does it he's he's trying to lure you into thinking something negative about somebody because you will automatically not be justified in the sight of God if you take that hook that bait but now if you're in prayer and godly somebody on your heart God wants you to pray for them to intercede imagine this Pharisee just going in there and saying God what a great blessing it is to be able to approach your throne of grace and I just pray that you would lift us up in your presence and help this man who's here right beside me God if there's just something I could do to help him how that would have been coming to the throne and approaching God the right way and this is so important because we spend time in prayer thinking that if we're praying it's good enough it's not good enough it is the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man that availth much and we need to watch what we're wearing when we're approaching God and not only when we're approaching God but when we come into his house and we're sitting in the Holy place and we're expecting God to come and meet with us we've got to be dressed properly we've got to have the clothes of humility on the only way we could ever come before the Lord boli and receive mercy and Grace is by meeting all the requirements that he's asked us to meet in our approach there in other words there's a right way to approach God in a wrong way we think as long as we're approaching them it's okay it's not there's a wrong outfit there's a right outfit there's an outfit that covers you and then there's an outfit that Jesus looks at can see right through that that pride and see the nakedness of of our attitude they're invisible spiritual garments Jesus Peter said be clothed with humility for God resists the proud and give it grace to the humble of course when we come into God In Prayer we're looking for help the woman the widow woman that was praying when we pray what there's things that we want of God there's things we're praying for if it's for ourself it's for others we're still wanting God to give us help and the thing is if we if we don't come with enough humility Every Man's right in his own eyes so I'm humble enough right so there's the battle that we're that we face and we we must make sure that we are just nothing in our own eyes I tell you Jesus said this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other he obtained Mercy he found justification for his life while the self-righteous believer never even knew he was still in his sin when he got out of there he thought he met the requirements but this is what Pride does it blinds a man from seeing what's really happening that's what Pride does no wonder the prophet said we should always we should always have an attitude that I could be wrong because it's in that that you open the door for God to show you brother Branham says whatever you do lay everything else aside until you get perfect love it's it is what the bride will have when he comes back to get her because that's the only thing that's going to enter in and I I don't care yes we got to lay our pride away we're going to lay everything aside until we get it Pride is such an awful spirit amen the scripture teaches us that God resists the proud he even hates a proud look I'll just say it like this he doesn't feel comfortable around you ever been with somebody and you just don't feel comfortable you know you just sense a spirit there well God doesn't feel comfortable around a spirit of pride if your spiritual outfit has any pride in it we can't expect God to do very much for us he'll resist that and so look we might as well get down to the real real requirement that God needs before we go to him in prayer sometimes we get all of our prayers just right but our spirit ain't right and we're not clothed right God may visit anyone occasionally because the the goodness of God the spirit of God falls on the just in the unjust and he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh but his dwelling is only with the humble he only dwells with the humble that's where he chooses to dwell with and we've got to choose to keep that garment on all the time we can't just you know have it on sometimes and then when we leave church it doesn't matter right or does it matter how we're acting in in our homes and then we just you know try to go in prayer and no God wants us dressed in humility it's a real thing and that's where he draws I'm going to say that's why it's so important turn with me to Isaiah 57 verse 15. Isaiah 57 verse 15 says 4. four for I want to wait till you get there before I read it I'm in training you know that right I'm in concentrating praise the Lord how many loves the scriptures where would we be without the scriptures the Bible says for thus saith thee high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place and I'm sorry with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit and my purpose is to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones so we see here he dwells in the high and holy place the lofty place but he also dwells with the humble spirit and this is a brother Branham taught us if our spirit gets wrong the Holy Ghost just takes its flight and it waits for us to get things right I can't expect God just to be with me all the time I got to make sure that my spirit matches his word that my attitude is blazing to him so the purpose is to dwell which means to continue or remain think about it that's why we got to stay humble because we wanted to continue remain rest lodge reside a permanent stay or inhabit that's what God wants to do for the believer and that's what the promise is of the holy ghost in a man's life it will keep him humble this is the greatest thing about this message many great things about this message but brother Branham he showed us the reality of God in a human being's life there's hundreds and thousands of churches out there claiming God claiming they have the truth they all profess it right they all profess it but how many are dressed in humility that's hard to come by that's a Dying Breed because Satan is getting as many people he can on his bandwagon true God feels comfortable around a humble spirit so what is a humble spirit is someone who denies himself someone who knows they're a sinner right God be merciful to me a sinner who needs forgiveness someone who breaks themselves down until there is nothing left of themselves someone who really really feels unworthy to even approach God someone who doesn't feel worthy to even live so much as their eyes to heaven someone who makes themselves completely available for God to take over that's where God dwells God feels very comfortable around that Spirit why don't we feel comfortable around certain Spirits because we feel they're going to take advantage of us all right I mean you go buy a car and a Salesman comes out and he's trying to sell you every car he's not even interested in what you want he's trying to tell you what you want you don't feel comfortable around that manipulative spirit and to me pride is a manipulative Spirit it will try to put fear upon you if you don't do exactly what it says no wonder Lucifer got kicked out of heaven he would continue to pollute heaven and God won't have it if you're going to delight yourself in the Lord make sure you're clothed with humility don't try to do something for God and pride God isn't looking for our performance or our entertainment or whatever we could bring before miss something good the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise those are the things that God wants to see in her life and I'll tell you it is a sacrifice to break yourself down to humble yourself in the sight of the lord it's a sacrifice but unless that happens he really can't restore he's got to break us down before he can restore us he loves to Quicken us he loves to get us back on the right track and if we're just zealous about repenting if we just really get excited about it and said all this oh I don't want to do it or I shouldn't have to do it or I already did it and you know it becomes some distant thing or it's some repetitious thing that we do just because we know we've sinned but God really wants to see us look at ourselves as we are nothing without the grace of God in our life what brought this justification to this man was the Garment of humility maybe he didn't pay all his ties maybe he didn't even fast but he sure looked at himself the right way and he wasn't comparing with himself with somebody that was worse than him someone that had a real problem in the church no he compared himself what God required and when you look into his Holiness you see how rotten you really are [Music] this sinner wore the proper garment in his approach to God's Throne think about it that's why it doesn't matter what you've done it doesn't matter how you're sitting here today if your attitude is humble God will receive you now whether you're Republican or Prophet God requires the garments of humility amen it doesn't matter which one you are when Isaiah experienced heaven and he saw the Lord high and lifted up in his train filled the temple and the the cherubins with all the angels and the serpents covering their eyes because they were unworthy to look upon the Lord and cover in their feet because they were unworthy to be in the presence of the Lord and they were crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of holds the whole earth is full of his glory now when he experienced that the power of God was so strong the post of the doors of Heaven shook there was smoke and here was a prophet of God that said the same thing as a Publican whoa is me I am a man of unclean lips who am I to speak the word of God to anybody that approach is what got him Justified not you know well I I guess I'm I've been caught up into this trance and this experience in heaven because you know I'm kind of special now and God gave me this I'm going to come down and just you know help all the people now because I'm better no that wasn't his attitude he didn't deserve to be up there he wasn't worthy to be up there amen and he wanted God to have mercy on him woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of uncleanness I dwell in the midst of a people of uncleanness for my eyes have seen the king the lord of the hosts God requires the garments of humility if you really are going to be in God's presence and we all want to get in God's presence but we put little attention to this necessary apparel verse 6 then Flew Over the seraphines unto me praise God having a live coal in his hand which he had taken off the tall uh off the tongs of the altar from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this have touched thy lips thy iniquity praise God is taken away and thy sin is the and thy sin purged imagine Isaiah in heaven thinking about him being a prophet you know above others saying Lord I Thank you I am not like others I read I pray I prophesy you know his iniquity would have remained his sin wouldn't have been purged and so our attitude is what really counts when we're approaching God we cannot forget how needy we really are and I'll tell you like this the more that you can practice being truly genuinely humble with one another the easier it is to get the results from God because you can't where the garments be clothed with the ability one unto another the Bible says and that takes a lot it takes a lot to really esteem the other better than yourself to really say something good about somebody who you know there's something wrong with but you want God on your side that's what God is because I'm going to tell you every one of us are not worthy of the least of God's blessings we're not worthy to be saved we're not worthy to be blessed we're not worthy for depression to leave us we're not worthy of our bodies to be healed we're not worthy of anything of God but it's it's so easy in our lives that we can just get drawn away by some spirit that makes us feel like we're something when we compare ourselves to somebody else and God is a million miles from that verse 8 and look at this what happened after he was justif after he was cleaned and I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me what did God really do to the prophet when he came before him He restored him He restored him back to order amen amen something happened that disconnected him he got out of the vine something happened to where sin came in and I'll be honest with you we Brothers we backslide 100 times a day I don't know it seems like evil is getting worse and worse I wonder if we're doing it more and more but after he cleanses us and washes us he puts us in service he sanctifies you for the service of the Lord to where you could really be a help helping somebody you know one of the most wicked Spirits is not caring about somebody I got my own problems right now well we all got our own problems but the spirit of God in you will have faith that he'll take care of your problems when you now start helping others right right do you believe that I believe that with all my heart I don't care who we are when we're in the presence of the Lord we're not going to condemn somebody now think about the times you've got down on your knees to pray and you're thinking evil about somebody you're thinking ill of your neighbor you're thinking something wrong about the church come on of course to think about negative things in the church why is that because we have more people in the church right the more people the more problems the more chance that we're going to get hurt stepped on offended bothered right if you just come to church and it's only you right you're probably not going to feel that much about it you're probably going to get down in your knees you're going to say Lord why isn't there anybody else in the church but just remember when that little thought starts coming I don't care how true it is God has called us to be intercessors not accusers of the brethren you'll never never get anything from God with that type of spirit and that's because God's light is stronger than us and when Isaiah got into the presence of that light it was no longer about Lord these people they don't listen to me but I've been prophesying I've been I've been telling them like it is and they just won't listen to me he didn't say that he was so focused on his wrong I'm telling you this is the right garment to be wearing don't let anything keep you from wearing this garment the Bible says who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect he that is with without sin Let Him cast the first stone Jesus said the bride is always dressed in humility because God is humble and this is what God requires of his bride Jesus said learn to me for I meek and lowly he dwells with the humble and Vengeance belongs to God the Bible never said hey vengeance is the brides take care of it he said vengeance is mine God is the one that justify if God is the one that takes care of the business that needs to be taken care of it's our job to serve amen all right now during the time of Esther this is a a Esther is a beautiful type here now of the Bride Esther only wore the Garment that was provided by her by the king's Chamberlain all the other women that were going to be trying to be a queen trying to be chosen they all added their own ideas to and it says here in Esther 215 now when Esther's turn came to come before the king she required nothing but what he Gaia the Kings Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her now don't you know the same devil that tells you nobody listens to you nobody cares about you is the same spirit that tells somebody else the same thing we're all dealing with that we're all wanting to get the attention of God we're all wanting to get the attention of our King but what we need to realize is that we just need to do what God says just take what he says we don't need to add our stuff just approach god with humility now both vashti and Esther approached the throne as well and it looked like vashti approached the throne with boldness while Esther approached the throne which seemed to be a little timid didn't seem very bold I just and see how things look from the outside that humbleness can really be if you're not screwed in if you really don't know can look timid but I'll tell you what Esther was not bashful she was not timid in the aspect of um I I don't know if I should be doing this no she knew she should be doing this but she knew she had to do it the right way where vashti had that arrogant I don't say it's confidence I say that arrogant stupidity thinking because she was the elective of God that she could just do what she wanted to do she didn't have to reverence the sanctuary she didn't have to reverence the Throne of God she didn't have to reverence the king when the king called for her to come unless I would like you to come no right stubborn I don't need to go to church I don't need to pay the time I don't need to listen I don't need to work with them and you expect God to bless you we've got to put the garments on the Garment of humility do you believe that the Bible says that the king love Esther above all other women and she was made King she was made and she made I'm sorry she was made the Queen instead of vashti right Esther could approach the throne with boldness because she knew what was required and she met the requirements and when you meet God's requirements that's when you could come boldly Before the Throne of God you've done all you know to do it's only when you mix your outfit with a little bit of self I believe Esther she listened to what the king's Chamberlain said for her to do and I believe when we come into church we read the Bible we listen to the tapes we need to be listening to what's being spoken to the bride because in that brother Branham taught us and the word teaches us that the faithful Ministry is for the perfecting of the saints that we have a prophet in the rapturing faith lies in those types and we have a fightful mystery they take their place Esther had character we learn in type how the bride of Christ will have character and just think about these few things she respected God and honored his house because when she walked in to the Palace she did just go up there and interrupt and say hey I gotta talk to you she went into the inner court and she stood there and she waited on the king she waited in prayer until he held out the scepter right and sometimes we just got to spend more time in prayer than just coming into church popular and say God I need your help God I need something from you tonight I need well come and just wait on him they that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they that are are are faithful and diligent to to do what God has required I believe that the bride will always keep the garments of humility on and she will approach god with confidence because she's been taught that her husband is going to take care of her she knows that's why we can come boldly Before the Throne of God but we must keep in mind that God does not humble himself to us well God you don't understand you know I you gotta no you no you don't we've got to learn to trust him we got to learn to come before him and remain in that place of God I submit my life to you I'm nothing without you I can't I'll tell you sometimes we may think we can't get out of a wet paper bag because of the mental gain that's going on in her head but it don't matter because our strength is from above our strength comes from God and if we could put keep those garments of humility on then God Can Lift us up in due season but we've got to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God keep ourselves humble now that isn't just you know well I'm going to spend some time in prayer I'm going to be real humble and try to be humble at church and then I'm just going to leave and kind of go do no we've got to exercise humility all the time amen we got to exercise humility in our thoughts they speak louder in heaven than our words do here on Earth humility is a garment it's an invisible garment and it's worn all the time and I'll tell you every one of you that are wearing clothes today you consciously knew what clothes you were putting on you were not blindfolded you were not asleep and somebody put the clothes on you knew what you were doing when you put them on and when you put on humility you know what you got to do to get there [Music] you have to humble yourself before the Lord and your humility is going to be tested when somebody comes up to you and tries to get you humility if you got the right clothes on you won't be moved but if somebody bumps you the wrong way all of a sudden you've got a reason to think evil then you need to get your clothes of humility on all the time amen Esther 5 1 says Esther 5 1 she put her royal apparel she she put her royal apparel and stood in the inner Court of the King's house now Royal apparel my definition for us is humility the bride puts on humility that is fit for the king yes and she stood in the inner Court of the King's house against the Kings over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house now you go in the prayer rooms or you come in the church and you pray what are you doing you're in the Kings house and you're waiting on him and I think if there's one thing that we're missing in our church is we're missing spending more time waiting on God because if we don't wait on God enough we're not even positioning ourselves to for him to tell us that we got a wrong Spirit right that our pride that that sin is in the way something's wrong you know sometimes we don't want to even make things right before we come to church come on and we think yeah God will still speak to us well he may speak to you but it's no way to have a relationship now The Queen Esther and the King they were married they were one but they held different positions yeah she didn't come in there and just sit right next to him and just this is well I'll tell you we're not going to go over and push Jesus to the side and say hey I'm sitting with you on the throne no he said if you overcome I will grant to you to sit with me on my Throne like I have overcome his hat with my father on his throne he's the one that allows things to happen the way they need to happen Esther didn't give up half of her kingdom to the king it was the king that offered half of the Kingdom up to her just like Jesus offers up to us half of the Kingdom right we're join heirs with Christ praise the Lord amen now we've all pictured Esther coming into the King's house at one time or another just some quiet person dressed in her spiritual garments I'll say of humility and her approach to her husband was with great respect and I'll say like this how you treat one another is how you're really treating God what you've done to the least of these my little ones you've done it unto me so we need to put so much heart into making sure that we actually are having a garment that is acceptable to God in our life amen because I want to get out of here I do not want to be left behind amen I do not want to go through tribulation I do not want to fail because I didn't want to humble myself and I don't care think about this the rest of the group that's left behind after the Rapture they could spend all day fighting with one another how they are better than one another I'm not as bad as you you did so bad in the church you wouldn't do this you played favorites and they could go through the whole group of that and still feel justification in what they're doing because it'll probably be true but wouldn't it be better to not be doing that and get dressed with humility that you look at everybody the same you love everybody the same you help everybody the same there's no respecter person I'll tell you this Pharisee he was a great respecter of persons how many is getting something out of this now notice when Esther went in she wasn't just blabbering she didn't go into the King's house and just you know start blabbering to somebody waiting for the king to come oh I'm just waiting for the king no she was waiting in inner court for her husband to acknowledge her presence in verse 2 it says that it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight I wonder when God looks upon us when we come to church are we finding favor with him or does God want us to be doing something different and the King held out to Esther the gold scepter and that was in his hand so Esther Drew near and touched the top of the scepter and then said the king onto her what will thou Queen Esther what is thy request and it shall be given thee to half of the Kingdom now imagine God saying that to any one of us at that point it's all over our need is met right we all have needs we're coming to church we want God to move and it's I'm telling you it's an individual basis you I I don't know how many times um we've sat in church and we have felt so blessed and then there's sometimes we sat in church we think well I just didn't get nothing out of that it's an individual affair and God is looking to us to do our part first to Humble ourselves more not to feel that I'm humble enough If my people with my people not somebody else but they're already my people will humble themselves call upon my name seek my face leave themselves make themselves empty available nothing I'm a sinner I need you God then I will hear from heaven then I will heal their land then I will forgive then I will meet their need well brother John have done that well I'm telling you God is not not a liar I've already humbled myself well maybe he wants to see it continue in your life maybe maybe this is not a a place where we just come and get a McDonald's and run you know God is looking for us to be dressed and to stay dressed we it would be odd if you've seen somebody come to work and they're dressed one day the next day they're running around naked well God when he looks at us he wants to see a spiritual humility amen doesn't want to see pride because he sees right through that in his nakedness in front of him amen Lord help us now we're all on this pilgrimage trying to make a rapture and life takes a toil on us it's easy to get out of position it's so easy to get caught up in the cares of life things of the world to creep in to allow pressures all sorts of pressures come and just zap the time that we would have to where we should be doing the will of the Lord and we find ourselves spending less and less time in prayer get distracted by what's important start to entertain lukewarm Spirits like things don't matter these are just avenues that Saint will use to get us out of our position now Financial pressures will tempt us to hold back some of our ties and our offerings is that a true statement it certainly will and I'm not saying to everybody work pressures will tempt us to miss church now I'm not saying that about everybody busyness will tempt us to shorten our prayer time amen I'm not saying everybody does that but it will it will tempt us to shorten our Bible reading to listen to tapes too much entertainment will pull us away from getting serious with God family pressures will tempt us to miss out on helping the church excessive burdens for ourselves will attempt us to not have burdens for others and these things can lead us away from our humble position in Christ to where we just put on our own garments and we're going to do what we're going to do we're going to do it our way amen and then we miss out on getting what we're really after which we want God to consume Our Lives and to bless us with blessings Untold come in this church and answer our prayer give attention to our prayer to heal the sick to raise us up to deliver us to fill us what joy unspeakable and full of Glory right but we've got to meet the requirements and we've got to take this message that we've heard tonight and really try to apply it to your life because unless we understand the importance of coming before God and humility and really crying out before him we're going to live outside of God's presence and we're going to be miserable we won't have that joy that we need when you've got time I want you to read James chapter 4. the whole chapter but I want to read just a few verses in it before we dismiss talking about this battle that we have inside of us there's a battle going on and verse 5 says of James chapter 4 do you think that the scriptures saith in vain the script the spirit that dwelleth in is it lusteth to Envy or ill will but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble so the Garment that we want to wear is humility we gotta get rid of our pride I don't care what anybody says to you I don't care what anybody does to you I don't care what anybody thinks there's never an element for Pride to be in your life none and the more humble you are the more God's going to move in your behalf and here's how we get submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil resist the pride and he will flee from you you ever like kind of the tensions there you know the Bible says a soft answer turns away wrath well you can easily just kind of fight back with what's coming at you and you've got to resist that spirit amen you submit to God you res you you take the back seat you humble yourself you say not my will Lord thy will be done God resist the problem giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil will feed from you draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you cleanse your hand ye Sinners and purify your heart she double-minded be afflicted and more and weep and let your laughter be turned the morning your joy to having is humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up now I'm not saying we should come in the church and look like we all look right now foreign s that's not what I'm talking about just no Pride just knowing that you're nothing without the blood of Jesus Christ and when you're talking to somebody they need to see that that's when you know you're dressed they need to see that humility it isn't something that's just before God you're written Epistles red of all men and we're to submit ourselves one to another let's Stand Together God bless you I guess I would rather always be feeling I'm lacking like the publican than to feel I'm better than somebody else needy I need you Lord I need you every hour how's that go ah knee you Lord [Music] no tender voice like that can peace [Music] [Music] I need thee thee oh bless me now my save your I come to let's sing that again I need thee I need you I need thee every hour I need thee oh bless me now my save your I come to you amen one more time let's sing it I need your I need this [Music] every hour I need thee thee Oh blessed me now my say if you're I come to thee this amen you feel that way amen I am so near needy Lord so needy of you I am so needy Lord to be more like you you share all my rights away in this world of sin I am so needy Lord to be pure with
