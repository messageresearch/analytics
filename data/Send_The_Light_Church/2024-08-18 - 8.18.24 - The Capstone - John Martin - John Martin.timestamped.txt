[44:26] Marty so good to see you glad that
[44:28] you're able to have that
[44:31] time uh time is important to staying
[44:34] healthy you got to just have some time
[44:37] to unwind from
[44:41] life well this Capstone is a
[44:44] headstone the best way to to visualize a
[44:48] Capstone is to visualize the very top
[44:51] Stone of a pyramid amen and Jesus Christ
[44:55] is the Capstone he's the headstone of
[44:58] the church and of course this prophecy
[45:00] speaking of of Christ's
[45:02] coming the message is this the sign of
[45:06] the end times sir brother B says and now
[45:08] the headstone comes to cap off the
[45:12] church we know that God is building his
[45:16] church upon the revelation of himself
[45:19] who he is for he said Flesh and Blood
[45:23] have not revealed to you who I am but My
[45:27] Father which is in heaven and Upon This
[45:29] Rock I will build my church and the
[45:31] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[45:34] it Jesus spoke in in Matthew chapter 7
[45:38] there verses 24-7 about the the two
[45:43] foundations and and one Foundation is
[45:46] the word of God and if we build our
[45:48] house Our Lives the way we think the way
[45:52] we live our our Ambitions our goals upon
[45:54] the word of God then we will be built in
[45:57] such a way that when the storms of life
[45:59] come we will never be
[46:01] shaken right but if we choose to put all
[46:06] to to use only part of the word then
[46:10] you're actually building your life upon
[46:12] sand because sand is just a the same
[46:14] thing as a rock right it's just little
[46:16] parts of a rock but it's not it's not
[46:19] it's not the total thing and and God
[46:23] will only honor if you take the whole
[46:25] word right live by the whole word word
[46:27] so we the foundation has to be the word
[46:29] of God and if we build our life on that
[46:32] Foundation the Bible darely uh tells us
[46:35] that no matter what happens we will be
[46:38] able to stand the test of times and the
[46:41] message dedication brother bam says but
[46:43] the real church is built upon the
[46:46] revelation of the word and the will of
[46:49] God
[46:50] Amen now Jesus is not only the the
[46:54] Capstone but he's also the the
[46:56] Cornerstone and I think Brother Bruce
[46:58] shared a little bit of this some time
[47:00] ago but in Colossians
[47:01] 1:18 the Bible says Jesus is the head of
[47:04] the body the church which we know is the
[47:08] Capstone who is also the beginning the
[47:11] firstborn of the Dead that in all things
[47:14] he might have the preeminence am so he's
[47:17] the beginning he's the end he said in uh
[47:21] Revelations 1 ver8 I believe I am the
[47:23] Alpha and the Omega I'm the beginning
[47:25] and he is the whole church building amen
[47:28] amen Ephesians 2:20 says we are built
[47:31] upon the
[47:32] foundation of the Apostles and the
[47:35] prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[47:39] Chief Cornerstone amen amen I'm so glad
[47:44] that we have a Bible amen that declares
[47:48] to us the foundation amen am praise the
[47:51] Lord first Peter chap 2 ver4 and we just
[47:54] want to talk about where where're Jesus
[47:57] is not only the the first stone but he's
[47:59] the last
[48:00] Stone all right 1 Peter chap 2:4 says to
[48:04] whom coming as unto Lively Stones we've
[48:07] read this this allowed indeed of men but
[48:10] chosen of God and precious amen that's
[48:15] Jesus Christ
[48:16] amen disallowed by men I mean he he came
[48:20] to Jerusalem he came he he rode down the
[48:23] Mount of Olives on that that uh cult and
[48:26] and um uh Jerusalem rejected him but
[48:31] there were others who received
[48:35] him amen so disallowed of of some but
[48:38] chosen of God you also as Lively stones
[48:42] are built up a spiritual house so we are
[48:45] part of the building that God's making
[48:47] think about that amen he chose us to be
[48:50] one of the blocks that's right amen I I
[48:53] just love that thought that that I I I
[48:55] and you know what he doesn't take us as
[48:58] we
[48:59] are he starts with what we have and he
[49:03] says you know your soul it needs to be
[49:05] changed to fit the building amen and he
[49:08] changes our character and so so we this
[49:11] is why we come to churches is so we can
[49:14] become more like Jesus amen so we're
[49:17] buildt up a spiritual house a holy
[49:18] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[49:22] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[49:25] Christ so you you understand that not
[49:27] all sacrifices are accepted by
[49:29] God not all
[49:33] praise a amen amen they that worship me
[49:36] they they must it's a must deal you must
[49:38] worship me in spirit and in truth you
[49:41] you just it just the only
[49:43] way so when it's coming from your heart
[49:46] and you mean it I'll say like this your
[49:48] praise can be
[49:49] perfected amen I think we just need to
[49:51] get back to the Simplicity that God I
[49:54] owe you my life amen wherefore also is
[49:57] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[50:00] in Zion a Chief Cornerstone he's elect
[50:05] precious and he that believeth on him
[50:07] shall not be
[50:10] confounded unto you therefore which uh
[50:13] believe he is precious but unto them
[50:16] which be
[50:18] disobedient the stone which the builders
[50:21] disallowed the same is made made the
[50:25] head of the
[50:28] Cornerstone so you
[50:34] know we are we are all Builders we all
[50:37] got a
[50:39] house and sometimes we don't want to
[50:42] allow the word of God into our
[50:45] life and it's a choice God gave us all
[50:48] that
[50:49] choice I I I think about the great
[50:52] choice that Lucifer had and for I don't
[50:55] know how many years that he
[51:00] literally kept order inside of
[51:04] heaven and was sincere and worshiped God
[51:08] until he decided that his
[51:12] will should gain
[51:14] some some freedom of its
[51:18] own and then he started given the idea
[51:21] to the other angels and then they gave
[51:23] the idea to to to uh and then before you
[51:27] know it everybody that was born had the
[51:29] same idea amen and we got to come to the
[51:32] conclusion that that God deserves his
[51:35] will because he's the Creator you know
[51:38] he he's he's the he's the Potter we're
[51:40] just the clay not my will thy will be
[51:43] done but we have a choice in how we're
[51:45] going to be built but he is he is made
[51:48] the same that was the Cornerstone
[51:50] disallowed is now made the head of the
[51:53] Cornerstone so the Capstone
[51:56] so when we build a
[51:58] house we have to lay a foundation and
[52:01] that we build on top of that am and the
[52:04] spiritual building for the Christian is
[52:06] the character or the divine nature of
[52:09] God so we must take steps and I I got
[52:14] this uh uh this beautiful uh picture
[52:18] here that's donated by Brother johnon
[52:20] here um of the Statue of a perfect man
[52:25] and
[52:27] uh you you build everything based on
[52:31] believing the word of God Amen God
[52:35] honors your faith without faith it's
[52:37] impossible to please him you cannot
[52:39] develop or um um I say develop because
[52:44] uh these these things come into our life
[52:47] by God by
[52:50] Revelation by you believing that
[52:52] Therefore your life even though maybe
[52:54] you've been not patient or you you don't
[52:57] feel you've got strength or you don't
[52:59] feel you have that that brotherly
[53:01] kindness but but because you believe
[53:04] you're a part of
[53:06] God that you can have these but you
[53:09] don't you don't want to be focusing on
[53:13] this if you're struggling down
[53:16] here and I wish I had time I I thought
[53:19] about building all these blocks out of
[53:21] wood and and and and switch them and
[53:24] show you you know it wouldn't it
[53:25] wouldn't be the right building it just
[53:26] one work so there's a there's a reason
[53:30] that it's like this and we we've gone
[53:31] through this but we're just going to
[53:33] keep on on this this this theme
[53:35] hopefully cap it today second Peter
[53:37] chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 verse
[53:40] number three according as his divine
[53:43] power now it has given unto all of us
[53:47] all things that we need that pertaineth
[53:51] unto life and godliness through the
[53:54] knowledge of him that called us to Glory
[53:56] and virtue whereby are given unto us
[54:00] exceeding great and precious promise
[54:02] that's why we need to read the Bible
[54:04] right there we need to read the Bible we
[54:06] need to claim see that word that word is
[54:08] for you you need to claim it right that
[54:11] by these precious promises we can be
[54:15] partakers of God's divine
[54:17] nature having escaped the corruption
[54:20] that is in the world through lust and
[54:23] besides this giving all diligence add to
[54:27] your faith virtue virtue knowledge and
[54:31] to knowledge Temperance and to
[54:33] Temperance patience and to patience
[54:35] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[54:39] kindness and to brotherly kindness we
[54:42] see the
[54:44] Capstone the Capstone which is Charity
[54:47] right and we know that is God that is
[54:50] not human love that's the love of God
[54:53] the last Stone which is the cap stone
[54:58] is
[54:59] Charity it is the love of God God is
[55:02] love so we could say it like this the
[55:04] last Stone which represents Revelation
[55:07] the last Revelation is perfect love are
[55:12] you coming with me you it's not it's not
[55:15] I I don't want this to be be deep but
[55:18] our life gets capped off our character
[55:20] I'll say it like this the character is
[55:23] capped off with perfect love that's who
[55:25] God is he's perfect love yes he has the
[55:27] ability to do all these things and he
[55:30] can bring the the different
[55:31] characteristics of who he is into our
[55:34] life that we can begin to manifest it
[55:37] but the greatest revelation of who
[55:40] Christ is is
[55:43] love he's the
[55:45] Capstone the Capstone is when the Holy
[55:48] Ghost caps off our character with Divine
[55:51] love agape love all these virtues are
[55:55] God's divine nature amen now what is the
[55:58] last one brotherly
[56:01] kindness no it's not the last
[56:05] one so we when we think about being kind
[56:08] to one
[56:09] another treat one another
[56:12] right that's not the end there's
[56:15] something greater than
[56:17] that oh God come and cap our
[56:22] lives that Capstone is when the Holy
[56:25] Ghost caps off our character with Divine
[56:28] love we don't cap we don't cap at
[56:31] oursel we
[56:34] cannot we cannot go like
[56:37] this the prophet taught us to go like
[56:40] this you understand we go up he comes
[56:44] down but if we don't go up we don't
[56:47] build it's not coming
[56:49] down right because the Capstone doesn't
[56:52] get placed on
[56:54] everybody that's God's choice
[56:58] am but if we walk up seven steps to
[57:02] Perfection if we keep building if we
[57:04] keep adding if we keep being conscious I
[57:07] want the character of God in my life I
[57:09] want to be like Jesus and you you pray
[57:12] and you seek Him you read your Bible and
[57:14] you you mean business with God I know we
[57:16] live in a world that's full of problems
[57:18] I understand that but look we it don't
[57:21] matter if all the problems were resolved
[57:26] you still got to make a decision am I
[57:28] going to put God first in my life right
[57:31] and I I believe that decision can be
[57:33] made right now all you got to do is set
[57:35] everything else aside in your life and
[57:37] just purpose in your heart God I want to
[57:39] put you first that's it that's that's is
[57:42] so simple Amen in the message the seven
[57:45] the seven uh seventh week of
[57:48] Daniel uh NOP 70th week of Daniel
[57:51] brother BR says he is the holy spirit
[57:55] right and the cap of the pyramid will be
[57:59] the coming of Christ amen think about
[58:03] that see he comes down catch us
[58:09] away but just like you know the the
[58:12] Bible says um the the shout will go
[58:16] forth um the dead in Christ shall rise
[58:19] and there there will be a meeting in the
[58:21] air we know the shout has already took
[58:23] place so the the Rapture is is already
[58:26] in
[58:28] progress It's already in progress and
[58:31] and and I know we're looking for the
[58:34] culmination but this is this is our our
[58:36] training period this is our time to to
[58:39] show God that I really believe in your
[58:42] coming and and that I'm a part of the
[58:44] catching away and that's because we're
[58:47] we're taking time to be serious with the
[58:49] word of God Amen right now the love of
[58:51] God the Bible tells us is shed abroad in
[58:53] our heart by what the Holy Ghost so if
[58:58] you want more of the love of God more of
[58:59] the Capstone just seek more of the Holy
[59:01] Ghost you can't have the Holy Ghost and
[59:04] not
[59:05] love it's a different
[59:08] ghost it
[59:10] is and and to pray for the pray for more
[59:14] love of God and not have the Holy Ghost
[59:16] you're just praying for more human love
[59:19] and that has stops and starts and stops
[59:22] amen so the Holy Ghost caps off our
[59:25] character with Divine love as I've said
[59:28] so when we're when we when we're
[59:30] baptized When We believe We repent we
[59:34] get baptized that's showing God that we
[59:36] believe amen that is the foundation it's
[59:40] the it's the first step of building is
[59:45] believing the word of God just moving
[59:47] forward wherever you're at so if you're
[59:48] a sinner repent get
[59:50] baptized okay yeah you've done that you
[59:53] you come to church you're hearing the
[59:54] word of God you hear a lot of things
[59:56] right being preached but one of them
[59:58] like goes like
[59:59] this you whoa that stuck out more than
[1:00:02] any of the other ones that is God
[1:00:05] speaking to you amen and when you hear
[1:00:08] that you just you move on to that step
[1:00:11] even if it don't make sense that it has
[1:00:12] nothing to do with what's going on in
[1:00:14] your life it is what God is wanting you
[1:00:16] to do and if you do that that's you
[1:00:19] building on the right foundation because
[1:00:22] he reveals to you what to do and it it
[1:00:25] it may not be some strong shaking where
[1:00:27] you're thrown across the church it may
[1:00:30] be a still small voice but it's still
[1:00:31] his voice and and that that's what's
[1:00:34] what's important so we're adding step by
[1:00:38] step we're adding to our faith virtue
[1:00:41] strength I'm just being faithful you
[1:00:43] know the more you come to church the
[1:00:45] more you read the more you pray
[1:00:46] especially the more you pray the more
[1:00:48] you pray the stronger you get
[1:00:50] spiritually that's just all there is to
[1:00:52] it you men ought to pray always and not
[1:00:55] faint right because when you're not
[1:00:57] praying you become weak you become
[1:01:00] spiritually shriveled up so you you you
[1:01:02] you really focus on on on on praying and
[1:01:06] you'll get uh more strength more more
[1:01:09] virtue you be to handle more you'll be
[1:01:11] to do more because God is in you to do
[1:01:14] it amen amen then you you just keep
[1:01:17] building these right here now brother
[1:01:19] brandom had said when you repent and get
[1:01:21] baptized it shows you've accepted Christ
[1:01:23] but it's not until you get filled with
[1:01:25] the Holy Ghost that Christ has accepted
[1:01:28] you that's a powerful statement because
[1:01:31] you know with any you know
[1:01:32] denominational believer they're going to
[1:01:33] say well no Christ accepted me when I
[1:01:36] repented yes he did then but not for a
[1:01:40] Rapture you've got you've got to go on
[1:01:43] and get sealed with the Holy Ghost can
[1:01:44] you say Amen to that first 1 Corinthians
[1:01:47] 12:13 says for by one Spirit are we all
[1:01:50] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:01:54] Jews or Greeks whether we be Bond or
[1:01:55] three we''ve all been made to drink into
[1:01:58] one spirit so we must keep building
[1:02:01] until the Holy Spirit caps off our life
[1:02:04] with Divine love right amen Divine love
[1:02:08] well when we're building a a building we
[1:02:11] never start with the roof right the roof
[1:02:15] is the last thing and you know just any
[1:02:18] building when you look the the the roof
[1:02:21] kind of overhangs the building right a
[1:02:23] house if I could say it like that very
[1:02:24] seldom do you see
[1:02:26] a roof that doesn't overhang it go it's
[1:02:29] got to overhang a little bit The Roof is
[1:02:32] the last thing it it covers
[1:02:34] everything and it's really no different
[1:02:37] with a Christian
[1:02:39] wolf not a wolf but a roof yeah and you
[1:02:44] you know what I'm saying I know you know
[1:02:46] what I'm meaning anyways charity is the
[1:02:49] last thing that's put
[1:02:51] on because it covers a multitude of sin
[1:02:55] in your life in other people's life you
[1:02:59] know if you don't have love you can't
[1:03:01] forgive
[1:03:03] somebody it takes love to forgive amen
[1:03:07] because our love is still holding things
[1:03:09] against people right and that's why we
[1:03:12] need God to come and cap our our our
[1:03:15] life with his love amen when God comes
[1:03:18] down and he seals the bride with a goppy
[1:03:21] love says she's my bride now the
[1:03:24] Christian Man does not seal himself he
[1:03:27] doesn't cap himself no what he does is
[1:03:30] he is diligent to keep adding Faith
[1:03:34] virtue knowledge to his life and and if
[1:03:37] he can walk up these
[1:03:39] steps and get
[1:03:42] here God sees he will come down and cap
[1:03:45] our life with Divine love because he's
[1:03:48] faithful he wants to he wants to marry a
[1:03:51] bride without spot without wrinkle with
[1:03:54] any such thing he just he wants to love
[1:03:58] her and he wants to be loved reciprocate
[1:04:01] that love back right right yeah God
[1:04:04] loves everybody unconditionally right
[1:04:07] absolutely he just loves unconditionally
[1:04:10] he even loves his enemies he's good to
[1:04:12] them that that don't work good to to him
[1:04:14] I mean he that that one guy came to to
[1:04:17] kill Jesus and his ear got caught up in
[1:04:20] Jesus didn't say hey it goes to show you
[1:04:22] you shouldn't come after the big guy he
[1:04:24] didn't say that amen he picked up the
[1:04:26] ear he touched him and he healed him and
[1:04:28] who knows that that man still could have
[1:04:30] went to his grive hating Jesus
[1:04:37] right but when that Divine love comes
[1:04:40] into our
[1:04:42] life we will love just like he
[1:04:46] loved and he comes down and caps the
[1:04:50] believer with that same
[1:04:52] love so we don't have to have confidence
[1:04:54] in ourselves
[1:04:56] our confidence is in
[1:04:58] God that he'll do it because we're still
[1:05:01] on the same Foundation of faith that God
[1:05:04] will do it for us
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:08] amen God has to make sure as brother
[1:05:11] bandam said that the Box Car it has to
[1:05:14] be all packed perfectly because if you
[1:05:17] know if if if these are out you know I
[1:05:21] got all these except this well then God
[1:05:25] is not going to
[1:05:26] you he's not going to say well you tried
[1:05:29] you got the you you know you got the the
[1:05:31] majority of them you know you're
[1:05:33] in I can't find scripture for that am so
[1:05:37] I say you just get serious with the word
[1:05:39] and you pray and say God I want your
[1:05:41] character now these are these are not
[1:05:43] dos and don'ts by the way this is just
[1:05:46] simply God's character we're not born
[1:05:48] with it but we are born again with
[1:05:52] it amen now we cannot enter into heaven
[1:05:57] without being bornn again or the new
[1:05:58] life we cannot enter into heaven I'll
[1:06:00] say without perfect love we cannot enter
[1:06:02] into heaven without the Capstone are you
[1:06:06] with me all right brother B said in the
[1:06:08] message beyond the curtain of
[1:06:11] time he says I noticed these young women
[1:06:15] all wore their hair down to their
[1:06:19] waistline and their skirts went down to
[1:06:22] their
[1:06:22] feet and after this hope my first wife
[1:06:26] she hugged me and said my precious
[1:06:29] brother then another young woman hugged
[1:06:31] me and hope turned and hugged the young
[1:06:34] woman and I said I don't understand this
[1:06:40] that means brother
[1:06:43] brandham was looking at the situation
[1:06:47] through human love
[1:06:50] am because they were in perfect
[1:06:53] love and he's looking at it in human
[1:06:56] love says I don't understand this this
[1:07:00] is something entirely different from our
[1:07:02] human love he says I don't want to go
[1:07:05] back to that old body in the
[1:07:07] bed and anybody that's ever went over
[1:07:10] there and came back said I don't want to
[1:07:11] come
[1:07:13] back then a voice spoke to
[1:07:16] me and said this is what you preached
[1:07:20] amen that the Holy Ghost
[1:07:24] is so when you're you're listening to
[1:07:26] 1100 sermons that he preached he is
[1:07:28] really preaching perfect love now he
[1:07:32] only named a few Services perfect love
[1:07:34] divine love or love compared to
[1:07:37] everything else he preached but
[1:07:39] understand in the message that he
[1:07:40] preached which is the word of God
[1:07:43] unveiled it is the it is it is to uh
[1:07:47] introduce the Capstone to us to our
[1:07:51] lives the word of God is perfect love
[1:07:56] God's word is perfect love and that's
[1:07:58] why it's so important to follow it
[1:08:01] because it shows God you love him he
[1:08:03] said if you love me keep my word amen
[1:08:08] amen he said this is what you preached
[1:08:10] that was the Holy
[1:08:12] Ghost this is perfect love now the voice
[1:08:15] is still speaking he said this is
[1:08:18] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[1:08:22] without
[1:08:23] it I think about those Cher they're just
[1:08:27] guarding I'm telling you Saints don't
[1:08:29] try to enter in because you think you're
[1:08:32] special you you got to get perfect love
[1:08:36] this is is as as sure as anything I know
[1:08:39] this this type of message is not
[1:08:40] preached in the denominations but you
[1:08:42] know what God hasn't called you to the D
[1:08:44] he's called you out of the denomination
[1:08:46] he has called You Into His Marvelous
[1:08:48] Light amen and the rejected King brother
[1:08:51] says and I Heard a Voice then that spoke
[1:08:53] to me that was in the room and said this
[1:08:56] is what you preached was the Holy Ghost
[1:08:58] this is perfect love and nothing can
[1:09:00] enter here without it so he he says it
[1:09:03] in two different messages say but he
[1:09:05] says this in this one he says I am more
[1:09:07] determined than ever in my
[1:09:10] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:09:13] in
[1:09:14] there so up till this
[1:09:17] point in
[1:09:19] 1960 he says I'm more determined now
[1:09:22] than I've ever been in all my all that
[1:09:24] I've ever went through
[1:09:26] that it really takes perfect love to
[1:09:28] Ender there now if we if we can just
[1:09:30] believe that then now you can pursue
[1:09:34] it right amen but if you think somehow
[1:09:37] it just happens it don't just happen you
[1:09:40] got to prepare yourself for it right it
[1:09:43] it's just like it's just like getting
[1:09:45] filled with the Holy Ghost God is not
[1:09:48] going to come just because we repent to
[1:09:50] got baptized and fill us with the Holy
[1:09:51] Ghost it's not that's not how it works
[1:09:53] there's a process of sanc ification that
[1:09:56] takes place to where God begins to deal
[1:09:59] with your desires your dos and your
[1:10:00] don'ts and what you want to do and where
[1:10:02] you want to go and and you start kicking
[1:10:04] out certain things out the way you talk
[1:10:06] the way you act and you know what you
[1:10:08] want to do with your time and where your
[1:10:10] heart's going brother BR says it's
[1:10:11] really easy to know where you're going
[1:10:13] he says just see what you're being drawn
[1:10:14] to where you spending your time what
[1:10:16] you're being pulled to so you go through
[1:10:18] this process of of of sanctification and
[1:10:20] then he comes and fills you so it is no
[1:10:23] different when we view the cap Stone
[1:10:25] coming down on our lives we have to have
[1:10:27] things in
[1:10:29] order in the message beyond the curtain
[1:10:31] of time brother R said there was no
[1:10:33] jealousy there was no tiredness can you
[1:10:35] say Amen to that this morning we should
[1:10:37] better say Amen to that
[1:10:40] one he said there was no
[1:10:43] sickness you that are sick today those
[1:10:45] of you that are not here you can say
[1:10:47] Amen to that no old
[1:10:49] age amen we a lot can say that Amen to
[1:10:52] that one no death
[1:10:55] only Supreme Beauty and
[1:11:00] joy what a word what a word that brother
[1:11:02] B used whatever you do he says now lay
[1:11:05] aside everything else until you get
[1:11:09] perfect love now I know I've read these
[1:11:12] quotes here but look I don't know if
[1:11:15] we're really laying things aside to go
[1:11:17] after it so I just ass soon stir up your
[1:11:20] your your remembrance your stir you up
[1:11:23] by way of remembrance this is what the
[1:11:25] prophet said uh we we we've we've got to
[1:11:28] lay things aside what things is he
[1:11:31] talking about what do we lay aside to
[1:11:33] get it well are there things in your
[1:11:37] life that are not
[1:11:39] these are there things in your life that
[1:11:41] are not these hey let's lay it
[1:11:44] aside let's lay it aside maybe maybe
[1:11:48] we're not putting enough time just
[1:11:50] saying
[1:11:51] Lord I I know that I need perfect love
[1:11:55] amen I'm just going to I'm going to lay
[1:11:57] aside my time that I've been doing other
[1:12:00] things and I'm just going to seek more
[1:12:03] of the Holy Ghost see the Simplicity in
[1:12:05] this it's simple but it is really
[1:12:09] profound and it brings forth a fruit in
[1:12:12] our life because God is he can't help us
[1:12:15] other than going through free more
[1:12:18] agency right he he he just can't he
[1:12:21] can't bypass you know because we
[1:12:23] understand we all have mixed
[1:12:29] motives we all want and don't want
[1:12:32] there's a white dog in the black dog
[1:12:34] there is I want to do my will I want to
[1:12:36] do God's will all of
[1:12:38] us and and and we've got to get to the
[1:12:42] place where we lie lay aside the other
[1:12:45] things that are not God's
[1:12:47] Will and seek perfect love if if we just
[1:12:52] if we if we just promis in our hearts to
[1:12:54] do that we can stop church right now we
[1:12:57] literally could stop right now have
[1:12:59] fellowship and go home because this is
[1:13:02] what brings God to you it's like it's
[1:13:05] like a a magnet right he he's drawn by
[1:13:08] love the love that you have for God the
[1:13:10] love that you you have to want to please
[1:13:12] God he's drawn to that and and and and
[1:13:16] he's coming for those that look for him
[1:13:18] and is appearing he's not coming just
[1:13:20] because well I'm just coming for
[1:13:21] everybody that says they're in the
[1:13:22] message he is not coming for themen
[1:13:26] just like he didn't come he didn't
[1:13:28] everybody that came out of Egypt didn't
[1:13:29] go in the promised
[1:13:31] land I mean they all profess to be
[1:13:33] believers they all profess to love God
[1:13:36] they all profess you know they all
[1:13:37] Rejoice yeah he brought us out of Egypt
[1:13:39] look at my shoes never wore out for 40
[1:13:40] years they all could testify of
[1:13:44] that but that just testifying of how
[1:13:47] great God is how loving God is how
[1:13:50] perfect God is he's good to the the just
[1:13:52] and the unjust but it it it doesn't
[1:13:55] prove where they're at because
[1:14:00] they they they didn't say we're more
[1:14:03] than able to take the land it was only
[1:14:04] Joshua and Caleb they stayed on that
[1:14:08] Foundation
[1:14:10] amen all right lay aside everything else
[1:14:14] until you get perfect lib get
[1:14:17] get get you you've heard somebody say
[1:14:20] get
[1:14:21] out right we we've all heard that
[1:14:26] get brother Brandon says get to where
[1:14:28] you can love
[1:14:31] everybody get
[1:14:33] there I I love the holy ghost pulling me
[1:14:36] there I do I
[1:14:38] do where would we be without the Holy
[1:14:41] Ghost he's there to lead and guide us
[1:14:43] into all truth get to where you can love
[1:14:45] everybody even your enemy no matter if
[1:14:48] the plane is rocking the lightning is
[1:14:50] flashing or The Guns of the enemy are
[1:14:53] upon you these things things do not
[1:14:56] matter get perfect love in other words
[1:14:59] it really doesn't matter what's going on
[1:15:01] in your life it doesn't matter if the
[1:15:05] wars are going on it it doesn't matter
[1:15:08] if you're in a plane and it's it's looks
[1:15:10] like it's it just nothing
[1:15:14] matters you you got to stop making
[1:15:17] excuses come on who's got enough Holy
[1:15:20] Ghost to say Amen because that's what
[1:15:23] the the Holy Ghost says Amen to every
[1:15:25] word of God and look God knows you know
[1:15:28] what we're bad on but he he he's more
[1:15:32] interested in where you're standing
[1:15:33] right are we going to stand with God are
[1:15:35] we going to love him or we going to say
[1:15:37] I I can't right
[1:15:40] now you know I can see where that
[1:15:44] woman when she gave one pence in the
[1:15:47] offering she gave
[1:15:48] more than anybody
[1:15:51] else
[1:15:53] so if you got whatever you
[1:15:57] got to to get perfect love to seek
[1:16:00] perfect love use that to get it because
[1:16:02] God is looking at that to see how much
[1:16:04] you're you're
[1:16:05] given you you understand what I'm saying
[1:16:08] don't wait till Everything Is
[1:16:10] Beautiful believe that everything's
[1:16:12] beautiful right here right and and and
[1:16:15] and that you are just going to put God
[1:16:18] first in your life I you know perfect
[1:16:21] love is is a it's a it's a paradox amen
[1:16:25] it it is the easiest thing to receive
[1:16:29] it's the easiest thing to receive and
[1:16:31] yet it's the hardest thing to
[1:16:33] give that's why it's a paradox because
[1:16:37] to receive it you don't got to do
[1:16:38] nothing you don't got to die out you
[1:16:40] don't got to become
[1:16:42] better you don't got to turn the
[1:16:44] cheek you just say Lord give it to me I
[1:16:48] love
[1:16:49] it love your
[1:16:51] presence but yet it is the hardest thing
[1:16:54] to lay down your life and love somebody
[1:16:57] more than
[1:16:59] yourself why it's a paradox that's where
[1:17:03] we have to lay everything aside get to
[1:17:04] the place where we love everyone even
[1:17:06] our enemies you know it's the same thing
[1:17:09] that Jesus said when he said now you
[1:17:11] love you love a new commandment I give
[1:17:14] you you love one another as I have loved
[1:17:17] you right he said the same thing he said
[1:17:20] get you know you had to have perfect
[1:17:21] love now towards one another Jesus
[1:17:24] taught this Capstone in the Beatitudes
[1:17:26] when he said in Matthew 5:48 be perfect
[1:17:29] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:17:33] which is in heaven he's
[1:17:35] perfect and then I'm just I'm going to
[1:17:37] switch it up here and go to verse 46 for
[1:17:40] if you love them which love you what's
[1:17:42] your reward do not even the publicans
[1:17:45] the same if you salute those that you
[1:17:47] want to
[1:17:48] salute what more what do you more than
[1:17:52] others in other words
[1:17:55] God is not going to cap that that's not
[1:17:58] what he's looking for in a
[1:18:00] wife he's not looking for someone that
[1:18:02] loves them when they're being loved
[1:18:05] being kind when they're being kind too
[1:18:08] he ain't going to cap that he's viewing
[1:18:10] that is you're the same as everybody
[1:18:14] else takes no effort to receive the
[1:18:16] Capstone of perfect
[1:18:19] love when God comes and caps
[1:18:22] you but you know God's going to say I'm
[1:18:24] going to give you a a little bit I'm
[1:18:25] giving you a little bit of Holy Ghost
[1:18:27] I'm going to give you a little bit of
[1:18:28] love I'm going to give you a little bit
[1:18:29] of my word and I'm going to put you in a
[1:18:31] situation and I'm going to see can you
[1:18:34] handle this
[1:18:37] right and if you're able to forgive and
[1:18:40] love this little thing right here you're
[1:18:43] showing me you've got
[1:18:45] character you know what I'm going to
[1:18:47] give you more
[1:18:49] love but you if you can't be faithful
[1:18:52] with a
[1:18:53] little you're not going to be faithful
[1:18:55] with much so he's not going to give much
[1:18:58] and here's the beautiful thing about God
[1:18:59] he will not lay anything upon you that
[1:19:01] you cannot handle that you cannot bear
[1:19:05] so if something just seems I've heard
[1:19:06] this statement so many times from so
[1:19:08] many people I can't take it anymore I
[1:19:10] can't stand I can't I what what what
[1:19:15] give me the scripture on that
[1:19:16] one that's calling Our God
[1:19:19] Unfaithful and I know you would never do
[1:19:22] that God is faithful amen things seem
[1:19:26] overbearing things seem hard things seem
[1:19:28] difficult but they do because we get
[1:19:30] away from the word which is our strength
[1:19:34] which is our faith which is our
[1:19:35] confidence I mean Joshua and Caleb they
[1:19:38] weren't looking at their muscles they
[1:19:39] weren't building out the their muscles
[1:19:41] in the gym for four weeks for four
[1:19:43] months or 40 years before they went into
[1:19:45] the promised land they just trusted in a
[1:19:47] God who made the promise amen they'll
[1:19:50] take care of
[1:19:52] them so he says Jesus said verse 44 but
[1:19:55] I say unto you love your enemies yes
[1:19:58] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:20:01] them that hate
[1:20:02] you I I have to make him something and
[1:20:04] give it to him I have to I have to put
[1:20:08] my arm around and tell them I love him I
[1:20:10] I I have to
[1:20:12] just do good to them that hate you pray
[1:20:16] for them that despitefully use you and
[1:20:18] other words they know they're doing
[1:20:21] it they do it often
[1:20:28] pray that you can love
[1:20:30] them because they still deserve to be
[1:20:35] loved and now I'm gonna say it like
[1:20:38] this God doesn't sit there and say this
[1:20:42] one's worthy that one's not that's not
[1:20:43] the God we serve we serve a God that
[1:20:46] just loves am it's like a beam it's like
[1:20:49] the sun coming up in the morning it
[1:20:51] don't just rise on the houses that are
[1:20:53] good and the houses that don't pay their
[1:20:55] taxes you know it it it's dark God is
[1:20:59] God God is love that's who he is amen
[1:21:02] but see something is happening here in
[1:21:04] our lives we are we are walking over the
[1:21:07] threshold of of making a decision that I
[1:21:10] want to be in the image of
[1:21:12] God and so he gives us a little to be
[1:21:15] faithful with a little and if we're
[1:21:17] faithful with that little God will give
[1:21:18] us more and that's just the way it is
[1:21:22] yes that you may be the children of your
[1:21:25] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:21:27] the son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:21:29] good and he sendeth reain on the just
[1:21:31] and the unjust well you know what
[1:21:33] happens when it rains in the garden
[1:21:35] right the weeds also you know get
[1:21:39] blessed by the by the rain
[1:21:41] amen it's true brother Braham said in
[1:21:44] the message Abraham he says quoting Jes
[1:21:46] Jesus as many as I love I rebuke and I
[1:21:49] chasen he said therefore
[1:21:51] repent now here we are that's God that's
[1:21:56] God our father in the form of the Holy
[1:21:58] Spirit trying to get back into our lives
[1:22:01] to control us
[1:22:04] right when he's telling us to repent
[1:22:06] that's him that's God that's the Holy
[1:22:09] Spirit trying to get back inside of us
[1:22:12] yes to take control of our
[1:22:14] life
[1:22:16] it's you know repenting is not a bad
[1:22:19] thing let's make this straight repenting
[1:22:22] is probably the best thing that we could
[1:22:23] ever do amen right repent from our will
[1:22:27] to do God's will amen so don't don't be
[1:22:29] afraid of it don't feel and we all got
[1:22:31] to
[1:22:31] repent did anybody have a day this year
[1:22:36] that they didn't need to repent can I
[1:22:37] see your
[1:22:39] hand okay so repenting is something that
[1:22:42] we all have to do so don't be ashamed of
[1:22:44] it don't be ashamed of it it's the way
[1:22:48] it's the way back to Heaven amen all
[1:22:51] right brother BR says he got to have a
[1:22:54] Church to make and as I said last night
[1:22:57] the Caps don't come on it it's got to
[1:22:59] come on their perfect and the church has
[1:23:02] got to draw into Perfection amen you say
[1:23:07] perfection that's what Jesus said be ye
[1:23:10] perfect as my Father in Heaven is
[1:23:13] perfect so we're drawing into it in the
[1:23:16] message be not afraid it is I brother
[1:23:18] Ben says now real sweetly do you love
[1:23:20] him this is at the end of the message he
[1:23:23] says now real sweetly do you love him I
[1:23:25] mean really really love
[1:23:29] him question
[1:23:31] mark and he
[1:23:33] says it makes you love everybody
[1:23:38] right do you love them yes I do well it
[1:23:42] should make you want to love everybody
[1:23:43] if you love them right I just I just
[1:23:46] love I love amen it really being defined
[1:23:50] what it means to love God to really love
[1:23:53] him
[1:23:55] because when you love
[1:23:57] him you're filled with him when you love
[1:24:00] God you're filled with the love of God
[1:24:02] I'm not now I'm not talking human
[1:24:06] love because human love loves God don't
[1:24:09] love God go to church don't go to church
[1:24:11] keep his word don't keep his word you
[1:24:12] know on and pay ties don't pay
[1:24:14] ties but the love of God is
[1:24:17] solid it's
[1:24:19] steadfast it's it's
[1:24:22] unmovable amen the love of God is always
[1:24:25] there and you just love everybody no
[1:24:28] matter what they do to you amen so we
[1:24:31] must keep adding we must keep building
[1:24:33] upward until the Capstone comes Upon Our
[1:24:37] character with perfect love brother
[1:24:40] Braham said in the message the rejected
[1:24:42] King and I thought oh god oh help me oh
[1:24:45] God never let me compromise with one
[1:24:49] word now this is the
[1:24:52] prophet you would you would think you
[1:24:54] know
[1:24:55] with with the wrong Spirit he'd get all
[1:24:56] hoty and say you know I'm the prophet of
[1:24:58] this age and you know God's used me for
[1:25:00] so many miracles and nobody you know
[1:25:02] nobody else in this age has been caught
[1:25:04] up in beyond the curtain of time he
[1:25:06] wasn't like
[1:25:07] that he was he felt unworthy amen oh God
[1:25:12] help me never to compromise with one
[1:25:15] word let me stay right straight on that
[1:25:19] word yes and preach it I don't care what
[1:25:23] comes or goes
[1:25:24] what anybody does how many Sauls or sons
[1:25:28] of Kesh rise up how many this or that or
[1:25:31] the other let me Lord press to that
[1:25:36] place amen that
[1:25:40] place that place of perfect love that's
[1:25:44] the place it's a real place by the
[1:25:48] way it's a place of
[1:25:51] Peace A PE a place of joy
[1:25:55] a a
[1:25:56] place where you're you're so full of
[1:26:01] God's love that you're you don't feel
[1:26:03] you're missing out on things
[1:26:08] right but when you don't have that love
[1:26:10] you're grabbing Here Wanting this and
[1:26:12] trying to get
[1:26:13] S it's a it's a wrong place to be in God
[1:26:17] is calling us to a different place so we
[1:26:19] have a choice to pursue the Capstone or
[1:26:23] to pursue our own life pursue love
[1:26:27] unconditional or pursue conditional
[1:26:30] love pursue God's will for our life or
[1:26:34] to pursue our own
[1:26:36] will to pursue the full word whatever he
[1:26:40] says or to pursue just part of the
[1:26:46] word yeah think about this of course we
[1:26:49] we you're not in a
[1:26:51] denomination but the thing is how many
[1:26:53] people are stuck in those
[1:26:55] churches who they they do not teach that
[1:26:59] it's important to go by every word of
[1:27:03] God and they feel satisfied in those
[1:27:08] churches and and the thing
[1:27:10] is they're
[1:27:12] more they're more light right because
[1:27:15] you don't have to give as much but
[1:27:16] here's the thing this is not a
[1:27:18] relationship between you and the church
[1:27:20] it's not a relationship between you and
[1:27:22] your pastor this this thing is a
[1:27:24] relationship between you and God
[1:27:26] Amen and it's God's rules he said give
[1:27:30] your all deny yourself pick up your
[1:27:32] cross and follow him it's all about his
[1:27:35] rules amen and it's us up to us to
[1:27:38] say I Choose You Lord amen I I I choose
[1:27:42] I I love you because you first love me
[1:27:46] I'm choosing you because you first chose
[1:27:48] me amen 1 John 2:5 says but who so but
[1:27:54] who so
[1:27:55] keepeth the word his word who so keepeth
[1:27:58] his word in him in him verily is the
[1:28:03] love of God
[1:28:07] perfected hereby know we that we are in
[1:28:14] him God will not separate himself from
[1:28:17] the
[1:28:19] word oh my time is filled with swift
[1:28:23] transition
[1:28:26] position our whole relationship comes
[1:28:29] back to to the word of God right amen it
[1:28:33] it's not just a church it's not just
[1:28:36] following rules it's not following the
[1:28:38] rules of the church it's not following
[1:28:40] the rules of the message is not
[1:28:41] following the rules uh of of of dos and
[1:28:45] don'ts in the
[1:28:46] Bible it it's all about one thing
[1:28:49] relationship love he God is going to
[1:28:51] have a bride that he loves he's going to
[1:28:53] have a let me were that God is going to
[1:28:55] have a bride that loves
[1:28:58] him loves
[1:29:00] him and and and and she may falter a lot
[1:29:04] she may make a lot of
[1:29:06] mistakes she I believe that but there is
[1:29:09] one characteristic about her she hears
[1:29:12] that voice be zous and repent she just
[1:29:17] she falls seven times seven times she
[1:29:19] gets back up she gets back and she keeps
[1:29:21] walking this is the key it's not about
[1:29:24] being perfect and since I had a bad day
[1:29:27] I'm just going to throw on the towel the
[1:29:28] rest of the
[1:29:30] day get back up get back up I say to you
[1:29:34] get back up get to where you know God
[1:29:36] wants you to be in the message of leot
[1:29:39] see in church age brother BR said Christ
[1:29:40] did not come down to make himself
[1:29:44] known he did not come to reveal the son
[1:29:49] he came to to reveal and make known the
[1:29:52] father he he never talked about two Gods
[1:29:56] he talked about one God and now in this
[1:30:00] last age we have come back to the
[1:30:03] Capstone Revelation the most important
[1:30:06] revelation of the godhead in the whole
[1:30:08] Bible that Jesus is God he and the
[1:30:12] father are
[1:30:14] one there is one God and his name is the
[1:30:17] Lord Jesus
[1:30:20] Christ in the pergamus church age
[1:30:22] brother bam said in the these last days
[1:30:24] the true bride
[1:30:27] Church the true bride Church
[1:30:30] pareses Christ seed will come to The
[1:30:34] Headstone and she will be the Super
[1:30:37] Church a super race as she nears
[1:30:44] him as she nears
[1:30:47] him they and the bride will be so much
[1:30:51] like him that they will be e even in his
[1:30:55] very image
[1:30:57] amen this is the order this is this is
[1:31:01] in order to be United with him they will
[1:31:04] be one they will be the very
[1:31:06] manifestation of the word of God Amen
[1:31:10] the very manifestation of the word of
[1:31:13] the Living God Amen and he said the
[1:31:15] denominations can't produce
[1:31:18] this my now I am
[1:31:21] faced with
[1:31:26] um I'm am faced with less time than what
[1:31:28] I
[1:31:29] wanted and so
[1:31:31] now as I stand here before you I have to
[1:31:35] make very tough
[1:31:37] decisions where to go from
[1:31:48] here we have a choice to make to stay
[1:31:52] with the word and build on it
[1:31:55] or to make light of the word and just
[1:31:57] keep living Our Lives I say to
[1:32:00] you God is called you to be his
[1:32:04] bride don't stumble at the
[1:32:08] word don't don't allow the word to
[1:32:11] stumble you don't be in other words
[1:32:13] don't be disobedient to it when you're
[1:32:15] disobedient to the word you're stumbling
[1:32:17] at the word because God is never going
[1:32:19] to change his mind about the word it is
[1:32:21] what he's going to judge the whole world
[1:32:23] at when it's all over is the word of God
[1:32:25] so we got to stay with the word and and
[1:32:27] we have been called a chosen generation
[1:32:30] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:32:32] peculiar people that we would show forth
[1:32:35] the Praises of him who have called us
[1:32:36] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[1:32:41] we were born in darkness
[1:32:43] right but we've been born again to The
[1:32:45] Marvelous Light all right in the Statue
[1:32:48] of a perfect man I'm just going to do my
[1:32:50] best Lord help me direct me I pray it
[1:32:53] never was put on the top of the pyramid
[1:32:55] they couldn't understand why the capping
[1:32:57] Stone was rejected the head the head
[1:33:00] Christ but it will come someday now in
[1:33:04] the building virtue uh building the
[1:33:06] monument building the statue see it
[1:33:08] starts off with a foundation stone it's
[1:33:10] called Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:33:12] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:33:14] now what does it do then they're waiting
[1:33:17] for the headstone which is love for God
[1:33:22] is love and he controls and he is the
[1:33:26] strength of every one of these yes I
[1:33:29] love that quote I love that
[1:33:33] quote in the message it is I Be not
[1:33:35] Afraid brother BR says since the days of
[1:33:37] Luther they lived under justification
[1:33:39] the days of Westley they come a little
[1:33:41] higher amen the church become in the in
[1:33:44] the in the minority under
[1:33:48] sanctification then come the Pentecostal
[1:33:50] move which was the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:52] Ghost the restoration of the and now
[1:33:55] we're going just above
[1:33:58] that to what to the Capstone amen the
[1:34:02] church has got to be like the spirit in
[1:34:06] the
[1:34:07] church and the and the his Spirit the
[1:34:12] spirit that's in him has to be the same
[1:34:17] yes oh my you know we could just take
[1:34:20] any one of these and just go a whole
[1:34:23] message on that that but I'll tell you
[1:34:24] what's so profound to me in this quote
[1:34:27] he
[1:34:28] says that the spirit of Christ and the
[1:34:32] spirit of the church has to be the
[1:34:35] same brother Brandon says I'd rather
[1:34:37] have the right spirit and be wrong in my
[1:34:39] Doctrine you know we need to focus on
[1:34:42] how we're acting how we're responding
[1:34:45] how we're displaying ourselves how we're
[1:34:48] how we're letting the whole world know
[1:34:49] which side we're on are you with me you
[1:34:52] know sometimes just we have this little
[1:34:55] private thing between us and God God
[1:34:57] don't want it private between him and
[1:35:00] you he wants you to shine he wants you
[1:35:03] to be a light to your brothers and
[1:35:04] sisters he wants you to be a light to
[1:35:06] your husband a light to your to your
[1:35:08] wife a light to your children a light to
[1:35:10] your grandchildren a light to everyone
[1:35:12] that's around you be a
[1:35:16] light we must have the same Spirit the
[1:35:20] spirit in the church and the spirit
[1:35:22] that's in him
[1:35:24] has to be the same brother bam
[1:35:28] said I I know how to do
[1:35:31] that get rid of my spirit seek more of
[1:35:34] the holy ghost real simple get serious
[1:35:37] about my prayer
[1:35:40] time
[1:35:42] my brother Bram said the message Jesus
[1:35:44] keeps all his
[1:35:46] appointments he said and that's exactly
[1:35:48] when the church and the word has to be
[1:35:50] one like Jesus and God was one just
[1:35:52] exactly
[1:35:54] they God has was sorry that just I
[1:35:57] should have went through this brother
[1:36:00] brah said God was in Christ reconciling
[1:36:04] the world to himself and so will Christ
[1:36:06] have to be in the church the anointed
[1:36:08] word to make everything fulfilled and
[1:36:11] that's the Capstone that comes upon the
[1:36:15] last Church age he said not Leo
[1:36:19] deia he said not Leo DEA now it's a
[1:36:23] calling out of that it's a bride out of
[1:36:26] the church it's a church out of a church
[1:36:31] otherwise it's just like he called a
[1:36:34] nation out of a Nation amen oh I I love
[1:36:39] that all right so I'm just going to give
[1:36:41] you you you got you got a pencil and

[1:37:04] could we have this great message on the
[1:37:06] Capstone and not bound to read this in
[1:37:07] the message but you just go home and you
[1:37:10] spend some time reading it this is what
[1:37:12] perfect love is it's chapter 13 amen and
[1:37:15] then uh Ephesians 4:

[1:37:25] perfecting of the saints that we we
[1:37:28] don't be children just tossed about with

[1:37:34] up in all things which is the head even

[1:38:04] read these two
[1:38:06] scriptures to you 1 Corinthians 2:9

[1:38:17] of man the things which God has prepared
[1:38:21] for them that love
[1:38:24] him the criteria first is love God and
[1:38:28] you prove that by
[1:38:31] obedience but God have revealed them
