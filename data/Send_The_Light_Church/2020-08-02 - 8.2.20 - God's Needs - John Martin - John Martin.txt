TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen and i i would say if i ever or when i do get to that place that god would say all right you got perfect i know at that place i will be wanting more love it's eternal that's what we'll be operating by in heaven because brother brown said nothing but perfect love can enter in so we can't take perfect love with us like in our luggage there's nothing else in the luggage except us except perfect love amen amen well praise the lord everyone it's good to see you pressing in without an orchestra loving god the same way worshiping with all your heart inhabits not the music praise comes from the heart amen and we should never be ashamed that we have an opportunity to worship from our heart when you're in your car or you're walking down the road and you're not listening to music and you got something humming you're not upset that there's no music playing you worship him anyways you praise him anyways at work wherever you're at and i just think it's a wonderful opportunity that we could come and gather together as brothers and sisters of light precious faith to worship the lord to receive of him amen let's look to him in a word of prayer before we open god's word our gracious heavenly father we thank you lord as it's once been spoken lord we thank you for the opportunity to be in your house today lord that there's still freedom in this nation lord seeing that the enemy is crouching on and and pushing the boundaries of constantly trying to take control but lord and we know that your prophet many years ago said one day the doors will be closed something we don't like to think about but lord today we want to say from the bottom of the heart we're so thankful that the doors are open that we could come be with one another and worship you from the dictates of our heart and to look into your word and lord we now invite your presence for the r for this most important part of the service lord that you would reveal yourself we cannot figure you out we cannot attain to it we need the revelation from heaven we pray that you would reveal yourself to every one of us today reveal your heart to us and help us to see you as you are today lord father we ask that you forgive us of our sins and anything lord that would hinder the service or hinder you from wanting to speak to us or convict us where we need conviction or or just encourages us because lord we're creatures that that need encouragement strength and help and lift it up lord i ask lord that you bring a healing and then a feeling of your holy spirit and a deliverance and the lord just says remove anything any doubts or fears that would hinder that from coming to pass today lord god we commit this service to your hands i pray that you'd be with those that are not here today for lord they are needy now is that you would meet their needs according to thy riches in glory we love you we thank you for this now lord we ask it all and give you the praise for it all in jesus precious name amen amen god bless you let's turn to the book of saint john chapter 4 for opening scripture saint john chapter 4 i want to say it's really good to see brother bruce and sister donna back with us we brother bruce he really really can help us with with singing when we don't have any music because he's just he's just god has just blessed him to be that good and we surely appreciate him amen amen saint john chapter 4 verse 1 when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left judea and departed again into galilee and he must needs go through samaria god bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message god's needs and for a subject we want to speak on thinking more about god's needs it's kind of a a different type of a subject because when we come to church we're often talking about our needs our needs need to be met and but we want to talk about god's needs how many was here for a prayer meeting wasn't it a wonderful prayer meeting that um i i got done and i i didn't know how how long it was prayer meeting the actual prayer time so i asked ann i said to anne did we pray just one hour something along those lines because jesus said can't you pray with me just one hour all right the flesh is not willing to do that but it was so easy to pray prayer meet it was so wonderful and the worship before and the worship after i just think we got to build on that for the next service and keep it going because we want to keep the spirit of prayer going because that's really the backbone of the furtherance of the gospel amen amen so god bless you all for coming in and pressing it was just wonderful often we can come to church and be so full of ourselves our wants our desires our petitions our prayer requests our needs and have little to no thought about god's needs if you think about it who would ever think that almighty god who created the heavens and earth would ever have needs anyways i mean who can count the stars the sands of the sea who can create things the ocean the flowers who can count the hairs on her head i mean they're still finding fish and things that man never knew about and how long ago did god create them god is amazing who can see a hummingbird who can see every hummingbird and know how many times he's going to bet his wing in his lifetime but god can rattle those off brother brandon speaking on god's greatness and adoption he said the question was asked yesterday by a theologian to me that's been attending the meetings or hearing the tapes he said one question he said then is god i'm a present then he said he can be everywhere i said he is not omnipresent in the in the way that the word speaks on the present he cannot be a being and then be i'm a present it takes a prophet to say this if he's omnipresent why would you pray for the holy spirit he's if he's on the present he feels every crack corners crevice every cell every fiber and everything that there is i said why did he have to hunt for moses if he's i'm a present at the end why did he run up and down the gardens crying adam adam where art thou if he's omnipresent takes a prophet to say this he's i'm a present because he's omniscient he knows everything because he's infinite being infinite makes him i'm a present being i'm a present then being infinite then he sits in the heavens he abides in the place where he is a being but being infinite he knows all things known every time a a gnat bats his eye knows every bumblebee where he goes into the comb to get his honey he knows every spiral that sits in a tree he knows every thought that's in your mind because he's infinite and on omniscient that is he is not only infinite but he's omniscient he knows everything god is great as great as god is he has needs today hopefully everybody will be saying amen to that before the service is over but they're not needs in the way that we review needs in fact every relationship both parties has needs usually it's your partner that's often responsible meeting those needs you got emotional needs spiritual needs support honeydew list financial comfort safety get the groceries make the meals transportation there's an endless amount of needs in every normal relationship but how often do we think of god's needs and our relationship with him the truth is carnality in our relationship with god will hinder us from seeing god's needs god's spiritual needs because god is a spirit they're not carnal needs the bible teaches us that no man knows the things of god save the spirit of god the bible says that the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for their foolishness on him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned so if we're going to recognize the needs that god has there we've got to get in the spirit and recognize them spiritually the carnal man has a hard time discerning spiritual things like other carnal relationships we we can become so carnal that we're only thinking about our own needs and not the needs of the other but the question remains how could god who created me you and everything that we see have needs the true fact is that god has needs brother branham taught us that inside of god he had a longing to express himself in ways that he could not do in heaven to be able to express certain attributes that were hidden inside of god deep inside of god he had no way he could try to talk to the angels he could try to talk to the beings that he created but they they just couldn't comprehend that that's right this longing to be expressed is a need that god has i want you to understand that amen when you're hungry there's a need because there's a desire and that desire that hunger could become painful god didn't have this little wish list i want this model car he had a pain a deep desire inside of him that had to be fulfilled it wasn't something that he just wish he could have he created this whole thing that's been happening from the beginning just to fulfill that need that's how great god's need is today and we think so little of it don't you want to be the one to help meet god's need amen don't you want to be that mate for him to meet that need there's no way for these attributes to be expressed unless god created a situation that would allow it to happen so god created man in his own image we know that was adam and he was a part of god after god created adam we notice that god created adam with a need yes i want you to think about that yes because god had a that's need and what did he do he created a helpmate for adam because it wasn't good for adam to be alone god still had as much as he had power to create anything he still had a longing inside of him to express himself to someone that was just like him so he took out the feminist part of him and he threw it like this in seed through all the ages and we are his wife in this age think about that amen god created us with needs that only he can fulfill brother brandon says why do you go out there hungering for the things of the world he said because there's god put something in you to hunger for him only god can satisfy and you're trying to fulfill it with the things of the world says it can't be done when god created man in his image there were certain things that god wanted god wanted a man to have the same character that he had the same love that he had god wanted man to have a close divine fellowship with god wanted man to express the same attributes that god had so it was very specific he didn't make man just to be a mini god who who who has power just to uh move nature no he wanted man to be a god that had power to display god's character amen that's what he was looking for because power without character is satanic amen in the message the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride brother brandon said no this here here's god god is god which is the eternal there was no one but him but in god he had attributes yes it was an attribute first in god and he thought of himself as being human and that transmitted him down to jesus and now if you're if you will ever be there he said you was there with him then you talk about predestination you talk about being in his thoughts it's comforting but we still have a lot by faith there ain't enough knowledge in this world to put you at peace with that you have to have revelation it has to be him speaking it to you now god has needs but we often don't think about them because we're too caught up with our lives our relationship with god often crosses passes with viewing god as our personal errand boy to meet our needs and god you know you you know that you promised to meet every need i had and and and uh uh this is how great you are and and and i i need you today i wonder how often we come to god and say i'm here for your need no because we're too caught up with our problems or our goals our desires our wishes our plans it's everything about us god has needs and we need to slow down and just think about this a little bit think about god's needs amen brother brahm said in jehovah jairo the same one that's here amongst us tonight that knows everything about you he's still god and god had a need to talk to abraham like a man so he made himself a body and stepped into it god had a need it's all how you want to think about god your relationship with him that you're part of god but he really don't need you or you're a part of god and he needs you in the relationship i'm speaking of god needs someone to follow his commandments he needs someone to love him to obey him to praise him if he don't get that need the rocks are going to cry out amen he won't inhabit us our homes our church so we need to praise him god needs someone to get to church early and prepare for the body god needs someone to teach sunday school well i'm just going to tell you in my heart god loves the little children i'll leave it go at that god needs someone to pray and intercede for the saints god needs someone to move in the behalf of the needs of others because the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man god rewards it avails much yes god needs someone to say come lord jesus that's right someone's got to fulfill that the spirit and the bride say come it's important to know that you're predestinated amen but what are you predestinated too it's more than just going to heaven friends god needs someone to fulfill his purpose today his plans today his will today amen and according to ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 god works all things after the council of his own will shouldn't we it's one thing to be predestined to be his chosen bride and it's all together different to be predestined to walk according to his purpose for us today i want you to think about that we so want to hear about how we're so chosen so elected so elite we just want to be told that over and over because it's a good feeling that comes by it but we don't ever want to be told what we're predestinated to do today or tomorrow kind of relationship is that that's a relationship that you're not on the equal terms with god amen amen it's definitely one-sided it's god supply the ham will supply the eggs ephesians chapter 1 verse 11. let's look at this here in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his will so god has needs he's working out his will and we have been predestinated to that purpose yes amen not just to go to heaven to help god with his purpose his will in one place the bible says it's an eternal purpose someone is going to fulfill the eternal purpose of god someone is going to meet god's needs because why because they've been predestinated to i mean the pharisees thought they were predestinated they thought they were going they could prove it moses is our father abraham is our father but they didn't want anything to do with the will of jesus for their lives one time isaiah got in the presence of god he said woe is me i am undone i am unclean amen he wasn't talking about pre-dos he said everybody around me is the same way i'm in the same boat therein amen but what made him different he allowed the presence of god to cleanse him and immediately after the cleansing took place showing he was predestinated god didn't say well now you're predestinated that's all that matters as soon as he was cleansed god said who will go for us and fulfill the purpose yes i have niece who's going to go for us excuse me i don't have colvin god has needs after we get so full of the holy ghost so cleansed god gives us a ministry now who's going to go for us he was so full and so thankful to be cleansed that's right that's right he said lords alcohol send me send me he wasn't saying i hope he chooses him hope you don't choose me i hope he chooses that guy why because he felt so strong that he was the bride to the groom he wasn't just a church member that wanted to hear how royal he was and how predestinated he was how elect he was how much he was in the message of the hour it was a real relationship the bride knows the groom not by head knowledge but she can feel the burden that he feels just like a real wife can feel the burden of her husband [Music] we should always look at god in at all he's always amazingly awesome but don't look at god through carnal eyes and a carnal mindset god needs you in the relationship and not for carnal purposes it's not by works it's not just by doing a bunch of things that's right but for love and dedication with a longing to meet every need that god would have come to church with wanting to meet god's needs yes amen and part of it is to get closer to god to take care of the things that he's i have many things to tell my wife but you can't bear it now but after the you seek more of the holy ghost and it comes on you you'll be able to handle it because you can't stay here flesh and blood's not going to inherit the kingdom i'm taking you up there and you've got to get so full of me we can't present to god a badge a certificate to make it into heaven we've got to seek the realness of god's spirit in our lives amen isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 says thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool where is the house that you'll build me and where is the place of my rest you read that they what what what need does god have but god don't need us to be carnal amen in that in that way he doesn't need that but what does god need verse 2 for all those things have my hands made and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man well i look even to him that is of a poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word [Music] that word i fear that word amen you know many people go to church and hear the word they're chewing bubble gum they're in shorts and they don't care they don't reverence the word they don't tremble at it they just want to brag about how much god loves them well that's great but he has another part of the word we need to tremble at that word [Applause] [Music] god has a longing for someone that has the same spirit that he has he's meek he's lowly he's contrite yes blessed are the poor in spirit for they shall see god amen that's who god wants to be around [Music] you could have a seventh grade education you don't have to know any greek you don't have to know memorize five verses in the bible but you gotta have the same spirit he's got if there's you got time seek the holy ghost seek the holy ghost take the time that you're spending with god reading the bible take half of that time and spend it praying seeking the holy ghost with the purpose of receiving more holy ghost not that god would meet your needs because there ain't no greater need that you have than to be filled with him that's the greatest need amen amen well i have it john i have it i have it with john i have it pastor show me in the scripture where that spirit is there and i'll show you a spirit that says more of you i'm going to press to get more i'm going to seek after more amen because that's what i feel every time when god speaks to me i don't ever feel god saying you've done enough for me you're so full of me there's no more room for me in you amen but why do we think we have enough why because satan speaks to our minds and tells us we received the holy ghost okay okay so does that mean i stopped because i received the holy ghost as long as i rece you know what that is to me that spirit that's the same spirit of speaking in tongues as the evidence of the holy ghost it is the same spirit because once you speak in tongues you don't need to try any harder but when you realize that there needs to be more of god inside of you you don't stop you keep pressing on that's a good evidence of the holy ghost brother says it's real easy to know where you're going he says see where you're being drawn to amen when a man humbles himself and begins to tremble at god's word then god begins to express a special attribute of himself and he's only reserved that for the porn spirit for the contrite spirit remember he hides himself from the wise and prudent amen grace is released from god when a man humbles himself to do what god asked him to do and he reserves grace from those that are proud in fact he resists them now all of us at one time have received the grace of god we were in sin we didn't want nothing to do with god that was amazing grace but how many people walked away from this grace doesn't mean grace is going to track us down forever he's knocking on the door we've got to open the door we've got to say lord i accept you right yeah it's got to happen there's a part of the relationship that we have to do and that's what we need to learn we don't need to learn about god we need to learn how to love god how to serve god how to do our part with god amen and if you truly learn god you truly learn god well then that's god inside of you that's you experiencing god that's how you know god it's true experience right it's never through knowledge knowledge will just puff you up and make you think you're bigger than the person sitting next to you that's what knowledge does but the spirit of god coming to you it'll make you get down on your knees to the person next to you and wash his feet with the right type of spirit you build your relationship with god he said blessed are the poor in spirit for they shall see god with the right spirit the right heart the right attitude the right mold of well then a cup of cold water given in his name will not lose its reward what you've done to the least of these little ones you've done unto me that's what happens when the right motive is behind what you do but remember if you don't got the right motive and you do the same act jesus said you have your reward right in other words you're not getting it from god you're getting it from everybody you wanted to do it in front of conspiracies live for themselves they live for others jesus said you have your reward you want to look good in front of them you got it but when you live for others god will reward you on the other side a hundredfold amen amen and that reward is eternal you know the pharisees got a reward from being good boys but it was temporal but the reward that god gives you is eternal it doesn't stop those jews will be following you throughout eternity hallelujah god has a need to express grace but there has to be certain circumstances for that to happen and you play that part there are many attributes that god expresses to man because of his fallen state thus fulfilling many needs that god has many needs that god has amen right you want to express himself as a as a redeemer as a savior as a healer as a provider it wasn't he didn't have nothing to do one day these were needs and he could not fulfill them in heaven with the whole host that he made right isn't that beautiful yes amen it's so beautiful now some appreciate god meeting those needs in our life to the point that they give their heart in the relationship where others don't appreciate it to that point and they just accept god's grace for them in other words there were 10 lepers that got healed yes thank you jesus i'm leaving i'm healed praise the lord one came back and god made him whole think about your relationship praise the lord well that was my foundation i want to touch on a particular need that god has in hopes to provoke you that when you leave here you'll not only be thinking more about god's needs but you'll have a desire to actually help meet those needs because you are his wife god has needs are you willing to help are you willing to start thinking about it just a little bit more one time he had a great need he said i must needs go by samaria but what was the real need what was god really needing why did he need to go by there there was a woman there who needed to become born again and god put her on the right track that was a need that god had god takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked amen but people who are god's seed still in their endemic or satanic nature that they were born with will not be saved unless they're born again now they're not going to become born again unless somebody tells them that they need to become born again and gives them the light he said he that believeth on me the works i do shall he do also amen and greater works because i go to my father but god is still here inside of you he split himself up sister linda all that was in god he poured into christ and at calvary he took a little bit of himself and he put it in every one of us and as a good wife does meets the needs of her husband right i mean there are some wives out there they don't even think about their husband's needs you would think i'd be having a little council meeting with marriage but i'm just speaking the facts it's all about them that doesn't make for a perfect relationship all right did you want me to go on at this point it's going with the message at this point luke chapter 13 verse 11 there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and when jesus saw he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loose from thine infirmity and all not this woman in verse 16 verse 16 oh not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan had bound lo these 18 years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day so here there was another woman who was abraham's daughter god knows who's who who the real children are and who the fake ones are amen and satan is the most religious and the two spirits in the last days would be so close you could hardly tell the difference come on only the elect would know how would they know because they're the only ones following the word and everyone that's not following the word one time he said you are your father the devil he knows who's faking it many will come to me in that day and say lord lord didn't we do this this is i never knew you in the relationship part yes you use my name yes i blessed you yes you let me use your body i mean god use lot but it takes 100 lots to make an abraham you get brother branham says if you give god whatever you give god he'll use of you but he's looking for a relationship timothy chapter 2 verse 19 nevertheless the foundation of god stands sure having this sealed the lord knoweth them that are his amen we got two amens the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that is his that that says i'm a christian that says i want to go to heaven amen that nameth the name of christ he has a job to do and brothers and sisters we all got iniquities yes we don't have to go through that you just get up in the day and you'll see there was something that you should have did that you didn't do god knows who we belong to god knows who everybody belongs to now we don't just throw out the net amen amen throughout the net let everybody know jesus is coming soon god has a great need to get the truth to people why the truth is the only thing that'll set him free they must be born again everybody nicodemus i love you you're a fine man you're a teacher you've done some some great things for the church but verily verily i say unto thee except you're born again you cannot see the kingdom of god now what about everybody else that isn't a fine man that isn't helping the church they need to get born again too this is a need that god has why would we sit in church and just enjoy the word for ourself because we've been so programmed by the devil that nobody's going to listen to us when we leave here no one wants it anyways well instead of reading how many more gay people are this year why don't we read about how many more souls that need to be saved before the coming of the lord why don't we read the message a little bit that hasn't changed yes the world is changing it's growing worse and worse the devil knows how to program the world the bible even i'll tell you this is the truth before i ever came to the lord before i ever stepped inside a message church i read in the bible that the devil deceiveth the whole world it's more deceived today than it was back then god promised to do a short work he needs us to be like flint he needs us to be at our post duty he needs us to meet god's need because nothing can be done unless he uses a human being yes amen what about when philip came up to that eunuch and said you understand what you're reading what did he testify how can i know except some man show me the way well that was back then i thought it was an eternal purpose they're souls that need to be saved well nicodemus i just want you to know i kicked lucifer out of the kingdom because he had the same nature that you have right now and i would be unjust to let you to come back into my kingdom with a selfish nature you need to get born again i don't care how good you are well what advocates you being born again you're born of by one spirit we're born into the kingdom of god ain't by what church you go to it ain't by how long you go any by how much you read is by you getting serious about your relationship with god to get the holy ghost amen well brother john i'm kind of on the i'm on the border here with this thing dive in dive into the holy ghost dive in don't tiptoe well i went i went to church you know the truth you know what you should be doing i'm talking every one of you i'm not talking to two people here i want to say that a boy that's what i want to say to you amen that's the truth brother we need it god is looking for men and women who will help meet his great need if one soul is worth ten thousand worlds describe to me the magnitude of god's burden today he's the one that puts burdens on our hearts for souls and we feel that burden for somebody and we begin to pray for them we begin to reach out to them we begin to do something and we feel it's a heavy burden imagine what god feels when he's putting it on so many people if just one soul that you're dealing with is worth ten thousand worlds imagine the great need that god has right now in his heart the burn that he feels for those that are still out of the ark of safety well it's not my responsibility see who programmed you you getting the you be standing next to isaiah you look at isaiah he's god he can handle it we don't have to do that the main thing is we're in isaiah either your spirit is that or it's isaias don't claim isaiah and then do do what you want to do it's a relationship it's not what you claim it's what you live when jesus was going about all the cities in the villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel matthew chapter 9 the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people there were times that his burden became so great and so heavy that he could not handle it on his own right and what do you say in matthew chapter 9 verse 36 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd now when you see somebody out there and they got all this stuff on their body and their hairs like this and they're wearing these clothes and they're acting like this and they're you know they're just trying to find their identity and yeah that's right [Music] do you look at them as sheep a shape of god that has no shepherd or do you look like at them as someone who's part of satan's kingdom because if you just end with well i you know whatever them is that really the wife of the bridegroom when he's over here having this heavy burden and you're over there whatever is crazy it's like watching tv then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into the his harvest his harvest his he has a need he's looking for laborers do you want to be part of that group that just claims him without laboring that's the majority that's the majority friends oh they can prove it they can quote every quote that's right got the badge quote the scriptures debate debate but you watch what they're doing outside of church you watch what they're doing with their time there's no burden there's no burden for the lost i'd rather have a burden for the lost trying in getting nothing done than to be without a burden and enjoying my life while others had to give their life being burnt on the stake our brothers and sisters went through a lot there's got to be somebody out there that needs you there's got to be somebody in your life around you uh that you don't know that's at the grocery store that's down the road that's in your parties that god will come somewhere in your path that belongs to god and god needs you to get off of your wants and to start helping god with his needs amen i hope you never look at god the same ever again amen amen god has needs we just need to get concerned about him care about him because he's a gentleman he's not someone that's going to force himself on his wife i said you better do what i say no if you're my wife you're going to do it and if you're not predestined to be my wife you won't do it he's not going to tell his servants don't take out the tears and leave the wheat and then himself he would do it he's leaving it for the end come on you don't have to be told the god that lives in you know so much more than i'm telling you [Music] amen he's speaking all the time but we can get so carnal and only be thinking about our needs god has needs he's looking for strong men and women willing to endure affliction because that's what it's going to take to get the gospel to somebody it's not just for some soul to get saved it's for god's elect there's people out there that are just like you that will believe this message we just don't know who they are they're not walking around saying i need the message they're walking around think they got life by the tail oh i was drinking i was smoking i was gambling i was doing everything i didn't know i needed god are other people that need god but they don't think they need god so god's looking for strong men and women who are willing to endure suffering and pain rejection of affliction to get the gospel god looked for a man in saul he did in acts chapter 9 verse 15. when god was looking for a man to spread the gospel he wasn't looking for some lazy know-it-all in fact paul was a know-it-all but he had to lose his know-it-all [Laughter] so whatever you got that you think god can use you might have to lose it that guy can use you paul was a scholar and he was taught by the best brother branham was not a scholar in fact he only had a seventh grade education first church age last church age so it's okay if you don't know much that's all i'm trying to say god can use you in great ways the more you realize that you're needy of him that you're depending on him moses had to throw his 40 years of knowledge away from the greatest university of that time god had a put him through the the desert same place uh saul went into the desert when you get down on your knees in the prayer closet you're in the desert you've got some neology with god you're really learning about god in that place one time god was speaking to one of his children ananias and ananias he was looking at saws just like you and i look at people in the world oh he's a bad man in fact i know god that you would not choose somebody like him but he was predestinated right he was a child of god he was a servant of god he was afraid to go witness to him i'm afraid think about how many times you're afraid to go talk to somebody about the lord that's true it's the truth god needs strong men and women that will bring this gospel to somebody amen amen yes you're going to get rejected that's why you need to be strong but you need the boldness of the holy ghost amen amen ananias had a brother called saul he just wasn't converted yet amen think about that have a vision for the person you're talking to amen god told him in acts chapter 9 verse 15 go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles it must have been a need that god had the kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer from my name saying amen you talk about a need god has needs amen are you concerned i love that message brother brand preach convinced concerned yeah convinced and then concerned if you're not convinced that god has needs you're not going to be concerned about them and that's why the devil is throwing out every kind of distraction in your life gets you involved so involved i talked to a guy yesterday i just i was buying something on craigslist got on the phone and it was a non-stop 20-minute conversation about colvin i said i gotta go i gotta make i gotta make dinner for my wife i did but it was too long on the phone then i had to go to a w but the world is just consumed [Music] i'm not even thinking about god's need every time i brought up god in the conversation he'd just talk about he was a man of science he had a degree in science and and botany and yeah but ain't gonna stop me from testifying god has a need for believers to get out of the comfort of laodicea and go out help meet the needs that god has [Music] just before ascending into heaven which the bible tells us the heavens must retain until the restitution of all things that means it's up to us to get the job done matthew chapter 28 verse 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all powers given unto me in heaven and in earth amen once you look at all these commandments here this is called the great commandment uh no the great commission go ye therefore but it's a commandment it's it's it's really the fulfilling of the great commandment right to to love your neighbors you love god right go ye therefore and teach all nations and baptizing them go ye teach all baptizing them in the name of the father son the holy ghost teaching them again to observe everything that i've told you so whatever i'm doing in my relationship with you you're obligated to go tell somebody else everything teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the world people need the lord and the lord needs people to help those people right amen i am sure that god must have needs go by another scenario samaria right now but he needs another vessel i he's done with samaria then but maybe this is samaria by you will you be the one will you offer your time to god will you let him use your body will you present your body living sacrifice for him will you be the one that's willing to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god it's not about claiming how much you know about the message not being satisfied i'm in the message it's about offering yourself to god let him use you because brother brahm did say when the last one comes in we're going so the rapture hasn't taken place well who's ever supposed to be looking for him there hopefully find him because i'm getting sicker you know what if god looks at that attitude and says do i really want that in heaven with me i want somebody like me that has a burden for what i care about you know there are certain people that are certain believers honestly they're selfish it's all about them they only care about them their life doesn't define living for others our life should be defining what eternal life is to people who are lost that's not part time god has needs it's time to heed the call do you feel the burden today you feel his needs because when you feel a burden that's god's need a lot of times when we feel a burden burden comes on us we think oh they must be in need i'm going to pray for them right is that how it normally goes and god sees that need he puts on your heart god is concerned about every one of us being healed every one of us being prosperous i would that that would prosper in all things yes even as in even the hell even as a soul prosperous something along those lines god wants us to prosper he wants to to bless us in everything and we can all be billionaires perfect health everything that we desire and still not have his character still not feel a burden for souls so what good is it seeking those things when god's heart is over here rather let the chips fall whether i'm sick not sick money no money i have a burden to meet his need because that's all that's going to matter on the end only what's done for christ will last not only what christ does for me will last many people god healed through brother branham's ministry not only brother brian's but many people's ministry and they went on to die without the lord yes and they turned against the truth didn't mean anything except god loves them that's how much god loves us but god loves our soul more how many are willing to stand in the gap for jesus we're closing soon another 25 minutes that's soon compared to eternity who's going to stand in the gap stand for jesus be the one because you will be the one this is not a group thing most people are going to leave this service saying yeah i heard the heart of god that was a good one but i want to say it like this who is willing to not only hear this word but to be a doer of the word god has taken on the great responsibility to get his sheep out of this world think about it when you got a car in a ditch you got to get it out right when the air conditioning goes out you got to get an air conditioner when the furnace goes out when something is in trouble you gotta get it out when your child's in jail you gotta you gotta get them bailed out well jesus still has a lot of children in jail he's looking for someone that's willing to go with the badge of this gospel present the truth a pardon's not a pardon us it's received as a pardon tell them that this is a pardon for you yeah you'll have to convince them that they're first sinners because they're gonna look at you that ain't gonna set me free will you be the one will you give your time just start with taking a chunk i'm not asking you to leave here and all be monks but i am asking you to start carving time to meet god's needs well brother john my my time so filled i can barely well let's start with prayer i want you to pray that god shows you his need amen pray he the lord of harvest that he'll send laborers into the field you can't go pray brother branham said like this if you can't go you should send somebody all right but i hope you're not praying for brother gideon to come over you know two doors down from your house and share the gospel with somebody there is a job that you must do that don't cost you any money and does it cost you to get a plane ticket to go somewhere think about it you remember the story about the the old farmer he just sold his farm and everything he had and he went over to africa to look for diamonds while going over there he's he spent his money his time he dug and dug and he came up empty-handed so he resorted to come back to his hometown which he had already sold his farm come to find out the man that bought it found diamonds in his property there could be a soul to the near the place that you were the place that you live it's one of your acquaintances don't always be thinking out there the footsteps of the righteous order lord i wonder why because he is leading you i must needs go by samaria there's a need isn't just about your needs friends it's about god's needs there should be a burden in your heart for a brother and sister who's out there in sin you need to convince them the love of god constrains us not to live for ourselves but to live unto him who once died for us are you in love with god enough to meet his need or are you just worried about your own needs in the relationship have you been have you been blinded by your own desires and wants wishes dreams aspirations have you forgotten the terror of the lord have you forgotten to persuade men are you in love with god enough to help meet his needs i know you love god but do we love them enough to keep this commandment jesus said if you love me keep my commandments yes peter do you really really really really really love me why did god ask the same question at church was peter saying when will this service be over i already said amen to the word i say yes lord i love you but do you love me enough to feed my sheep what they need to make it because look at the sheep are not just here they're not the ones that attend here that are not here today the sheep are not only them but they're out there disguised in wall clothing no uh not wolf's clothing they look like the world they act like the world they're still his sheep they just don't know yet and they're not sitting here yet but god wants us to keep that commandment and go out and get them is that true and i read it to you i'm closing i promise i am you know what happens when the preacher says i promise i'm closing i try never to say that because they never close john 15 verse 12 this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you amen so did god love you just enough to make buddies with you just to show you how great he is and he makes the beautiful birds and the trees and the flowers and he just the water running did he just show you love you that way to give you all the beautiful things in the world to enjoy and or did he love you enough to show you that you're gonna miss it if you don't receive his grace did he get down and wash your feet when you didn't have want anything to do with him when you were so caught up in your world did he stop you and say there's death there the cross is the only way over this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends and you are my friends if if you meet my needs everybody wants to claim jesus as their friend but how many want to prove it how many want to lay down their life how many want to carve out some time to help meet his need god has a burden for those who are lost just because we don't feel we don't have it doesn't mean he doesn't have it the first thing he expresses to isaiah after cleansing is a need to get the truth to others and he can't do that unless he has a mouthpiece will you be the mouth these will you be his hands praise god you know brother and you should say if you can't say amen say oh me oh my. first john chapter 3 verse 16 the last scripture hereby perceive ye the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought ought is the big word here ought to lay down our lives for the brethren amen amen let's stand together as the musicians will come forward you know we don't need musicians but i will say this will the laborers come forward that's who god's looking for amen he's looking for laborers someone who's willing to roll up their sleeve and get serious with god i'm not asking you to go read the seven seals i'm asking you to get a revelation of the seven seals because it is the coming of the lord and we need to get in everybody that can get in as fast as possible bring the seal bring the seventh seal the coming of the lord to somebody now i know it's been much more enjoyable to hear about the seventh ceo today and why i think it's just around the corner and tell you about the signs of the time and what god showed me about this type and that type and make you go wow but you know what it'd be to me to me i just can't do that why because i feel that i would be doing injustice while i'm here i want to provoke you to meet god's need not to make you feel you know more i want you to live like you no more god is hidden so think about all the revelation that brother branham had what was he doing with his time spreading the good news can't get any much simpler than that spread the good news get rejected it's a good feeling to do that for the lord you ever do a hard day's work and you just felt good about what you did even if it didn't turn out real nice and pretty you know you gave it your best that's how it is when you gave you give your best to share the gospel you will get rejected at times and you will feel like you got rejected but it's really the lord amen let's bow in a word of prayer maybe there's someone here today that desires prayer maybe there's someone here that really hasn't felt i'm just going to ask how many has been not even thinking about god's needs now i'm not asking to raise your hand today and i'm not looking anyways but i just want you to be honest with god have you felt a burden for god's needs have we been even thinking about them the laodicea was so caught up in themselves that they had need of nothing when get god out of their lives out of their church i want to invite you today to make your heart known to god not just well god knows my heart already but to make that stand god from this point forward i want to work on meeting your needs i want to turn my life my ship my boat my desires my direction i want to start turning towards fulfilling my husband's needs now god sees the hand of your heart the desire to defy a lazy nature and to lift up a strong dedication to him and that's where you stand today let's unite together and for a heavenly father we thank you for your word thy word is a lamp to our path allah light for our feet it's it shows us where to walk and lord we lord we don't want to walk today in our own direction blinded by our own selfish needs remember one of your servants perhaps maybe maybe 30 years ago brother hankins said i've learned not to pray for my needs because god promised to meet my needs i'll pray for the needs of others lord we do trust you for our lives and you brought a son a prophet in this age and gave us a little glimpse when he said the missionary work was always in the will of god if you want to find favor with god do missionary work lord we know it's your heart today for the souls that are not saved yet too often we think about others today we're asking lord that you would increase a burden as that song we sometimes seen that course lord lays some soul upon my heart may we ever do our part to win that soul for thee lord i pray for every hand that was lifted in her heart that desire to dedicate themselves to being the wife that wants to meet her husband's needs i pray that you would give them uh the portion of yourself that they could feel that burden that longing that desire even the pain for someone who's not walking in truth that they could know exactly how their their husband feels what a what a joy it is to see a man come home from a hard day's work and struggling and that wife just try to meet comfort just being a real help me lord the prophet said just you walked this earth 33 years old some people thought you looked 50 because you look so old the burden that you carried to that cross lord we just we just want to share that with you we know we can't do everything but lord we don't want to shun the responsibility of doing our part let us be like paul who said i have not shunned to declare unto you the whole council god he suffered many things and he wasn't afraid of suffering more he wanted to fight a good fight to the very end god we want to have that same testimony bless every brother and every sister here lord lord if there'd be some here today that don't have the longing and that desire in this way i pray that you would continue to speak to them help them to see the importance of pleasing you we love you we commit ourself in your hands and i pray that through your visitation to us today lord that there would be some soul that would come forth from each one's neighbors god will be careful to praise you throughout eternity for it for we humbly ask
