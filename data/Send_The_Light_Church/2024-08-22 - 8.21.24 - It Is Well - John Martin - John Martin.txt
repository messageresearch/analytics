so much appreciate them amen and I appreciate you the Bride of Jesus Christ amen an opportunity we have here to get in the presence of the Lord and receive just one Revelation that could help us in our journey to the other side so good to see the Chanel family back am amen we missed you at the potluck and we just missed you amen we should have had a potluck tonight we would had more people but it's I I am thankful for us that better be here it's just it's intimate with the Lord when there's just a few you know he he so many wonderful things happened with Jesus and the 12 disciples amen and that you know just would not happen out with with the the rest so we're grateful that the Lord Is With Us amen turn turn with me if if you would in the your Bibles to psalms 27 psalms 27 amen psalms 27 we're going to read the first five verses here and have a word of prayer and then be seated amen psalms 27 start with verse number one and the Lord is my light and my salvation that's right Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be Afra afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord and that why I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemy round about me therefore I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy yay I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord am amen just bound a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your precious word we find consolation we find comfort and we find a light for our path to guide us Lord and we pray that you would come this at this time of the service Lord as only you can anoint only you can reveal yourself and only you can we are looking to you from whence cometh our help Lord Our Help Cometh From you please come Lord as we have come here to subject ourselves to your word and may this word become real and alive and each that we may leave the building today uh with more faith than when we came God will be careful to give you the praise for these things for we ask them humbly now in Jesus Christ's name name amen amen you may be seated want to entitle this message it is well and for a subject the fruit of trusting God Amen we know God is Almighty created everything right he can handle every situation there's nothing too hard for God as he spoke to uh Abraham there is anything too hard for God but the the the the true problem is our part of the relationship amen that we lose uh confidence in God we lose trust in God uh he still uh uh has the ability to to do his word's going to come to pass we don't like really question that but we question God for us and our lives and David here is talking in in Psalms 27 about his relationship with God that the Lord was he says my light my salvation not that he's just the God of Light but but his personal light and his personal salvation and and that the Lord wasn't just strong and mighty but he was my strength amen and and because of this internal relationship that he had with God that he could conclude that there was nothing to fear there was nothing to be afraid of and even though uh his enemies and his foes would come upon him to do to to to to make him fall or to falter uh that he he he still had confidence that God was going to take him through and he makes this statement though a host in other words an army right though an army would encamp around about me it I'm just not moved he had confidence of where he stood his relationship was in a was in the Tabernacle of God now I'm not talking about a building I am not talking about church I am not even talking about this message I am talking about where God dwells amen and where he dwells there's nothing to be afraid of Amen it's only when we're outside of that and we can see why David's yearning and his desire was one thing have I desired of the Lord and that why seek after I will actually I will actually seek for it because I know it's not just going to flood me be handed to me or just when I go to church it's going to be there no because I still have to enter his gates with Thanksgiving his courts with praise I still got to get Beyond this veil of Flesh because there is something there for me to where if once I get into that presence all is well amen there's calm there's peace there's no more I wonder what's going to happen because because you're in the presence of God this place where really all was well amen all was well he says for in the even in the time of trouble he's going to hide me in his pilion this the revealed word the the the place where nothing can touch you because you're in the palm of God's hand and and he said that no man can pluck you out nothing can pluck you out the devil can't pluck you out because you're in the hand of God you're you you have chosen as a a a son and daughter of God to to enter into a relationship that that relationship is the presence of God see so many people Jesus said all that come before me just thieves and robbers all that ever came before me they want me for what I can give to them but they're not interested in a relationship and this is the thing that really can really cut us and I don't I don't mean to to do that but God is continuously calling us into that relationship with him and that relationship is the is is where when you submit yourself to God you are in his Tabernacle right amen the word the word becomes your Hiding Place amen the word becomes your shelter becomes your light it becomes your strength amen no matter what comes against you no matter what the devil throws at your mind your heart has been submitted to the word of godmen for in a time of trouble shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock a rock we know that's Revelation amen and when you know that you know that you know that you're saved there is nothing that can shake you from it amen it's a revelation is what God gives us so we don't We're Not Afraid so we don't fear because we are all going to you know walk through the doors we're going to go home and we're going to encounter situations and and problems as the week progresses as the month progress as the as the the New Year comes along we're we're we're going to encounter problems all sorts of problems health problems uh financial problems um uh political problems government problems job problems neighbor problems kid problems adult problems spouse problems we're going to have problems amen there's a place for us there's a place for us and and it is our job that we we our part of the relationship now is we got to seek after we just can't just expect God to come and fix all of our problems because we got these problems and we're we're we're whining and complaining and and just God why are they here God that is not abiding in the Tabernacle of the Lord that's just saying look I got a problem and I don't got faith and confidence in you Lord now look this can be hard because a lot of times in a home or at a job sometimes even in a church not everybody's on the same page and you're you're left to enter in to this type of relationship on your own am but it's important that you do it if you're waiting for anybody else to do it it may never happen amen and and to be honest with you there is only so much strength and so much comfort you can give from a human being and I I like the way that David is saying here though everything come against me a host I mean when I think a a whole Army can you imagine the whole United States Army encamped around against your house and you're not afraid or all of Russia or all of China and you're not afraid am I mean you have to be in a special place place not to be afraid and look I believe that God has a place for us with everything that we're really going through in life I don't think that that this this Bible is is made just for ideal situations and people who got lots of money and and and a perfect relationship in their home and and children got all A's and everybody from school is coming and saying your your your Stu your your children are the the the the the the the pacle of of example in our schools no I I think this word is is applicable to our lives amen I believe what we got to do is do what David did we've got to enter into that part of the relationship God is Not lacking and we're lacking if we're waiting on God to make us our situations better before we're going to serve him with all of our heart something is lacking here amen it's it's it's free more agency turn with me if you would to Second uh Second Kings amen second Kings chapter 6 and we're going to start with verse number 18 this is kind of a a natural story but really it it it has a little uh Supernatural into it but I want it to I want it to relate to our lives here all right 2 Kings chapter 6 verse did I say 18 okay I just want you to know that was my first mistake because or maybe it was like my 10th mistake since I've been up here I don't know but I'm starting with verse number eight all right then the king of syrial wared against Israel and took counsel with his servant saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for there the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to that place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of theing king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not show me which one of us is for the king of Israel there's a there's a spy and one of the servants said none my Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel he tell the king of Israel the words that thou speak in thy Cham in thy bed chamber amen and he said said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it is and it was told him saying behold he is in Dolan now it is kind of weird that he still believed that somehow he could spy on him and he' not know about it right therefore sent he there the horses and chariots and a great host and they CA and they came by night and Compass the city about and when the servants notice that they come past the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and had gone forth Behold a host Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do what's going to go on what how we going to how we going to get out of here and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them amen no and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see that what I'm saying is the truth and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha amen Elisha was in that same Tabernacle amen he was in a place where though a host encamped round about him he did not fear now his servant his servant which believed in Elisha still his eyes didn't hold you understand you can come to church and not see you can be in the presence of God's prophet and still not see you can be in the presence of God and still not see amen and Jesus said if we would come into His presence and say Lord I am blind I cannot see he said I would open your eyes but because you come in and you think you have life figured out now just say it like this God is here to open our eyes to see how great our God is amen that he is true greater than our situation amen he wants our faith to rise because God put the situation there for a purpose right he doesn't want us to fear he wants us just to enter the Tabernacle because inside his presence you have strength amen now thing about this servant his eyes were not open therefore he could not believe right but you see we don't believe with these eyes we don't need to see somebody jumping up and down we don't need to we don't need to think you know 90% of the church is on fire so I guess it's okay for me to get on fire no God is the one that opens our eyes it's an individual walk and God is calling us to it that that's what's beautiful about this thing God is calling not John Martin God he's calling for that closeness with him amen and I believe that I don't care how bad our situation is if we're willing to choose to enter into a relationship with Jesus Christ I believe he'll be there to take care of our problems the Bible said he is a present help in a time of need amen but you got to seek you got to have that one desire if I desire toore one thing if I desire to you can't have why I have 15 things you got to put God first amen seek ye first the kingdom and every single thing will be added to you that's right and only God knows our heart amen you know you you may you may you may think you know my heart well you know brother John he's like a a really good guy he certainly put God first you may not that may not be true God knows our heart and I'll just say it like this God has never failed right now I may think I I put God first in my heart but my heart is deceitfully wicked there there may be times that I don't I don't catch it and that's why I need to say Lord open my eyes amen help me to see what you see because if we mean business with God I'm telling you all is well we're going in a Rapture that's just all there is to it we're going to fly away right Psalms 91 Psalms 91 David's desire was to dwell in the house of the Lord and the promise of God was that David would be hid in his Pavilion when the trouble came and he called this pilion a secret it's the secret of his Tabernacle and I like this is Psalms 91 ver1 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen we've all heard and seen the pictures of what uh the the Tabernacle that Moses made which represented in type what was happening in heaven right amen it was he said that he showed him and it was a pattern of what was in heaven and then there was the uh in the holiest of holies you had the Ark of the Covenant and in the ark um was uh the God's word it was it was preserved and it was life right there and then you had the two cherubin that stood on both sides and it protected it and everybody that was in the Tabernacle they knew that was the Holy place and the angels on both sides were crying holy holy holy just constantly hour after hour just continuously saying holy holy holy because God views himself as being holy those angels they don't know they were created by God but God but God gave them the revelation of how holy is and he wanted the whole uh heaven to be to to to to be sounding forth of the Holiness of God Amen and sometimes we can't come in the church and say Lord you're worthy come on and you expect God to meet your need give me scripture on that we've got to dwell in the secret place we just can't tiptoe in dwell that that takes commitment on the relationship he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress he's my God in him will I trust you've seen children sometimes playing with a toy and they say no that's mine the other says no that's mine and they just they they want it for themselves I believe that's how we need to be with God Amen though none go with me I'll follow amen th though they fall to the side I'm still going amen because he's my God he saved me I don't know how other people feel about salvation but I know how I feel about it amen I know he's he's brought me as that song Amazing Grace he's brought me through many trials he's going to take me through am it's amazing grace amen surely he will deliver thee From The Snare of the follower and from the noise and pestilence you know you can just fill in whatever you're whatever you want to be delivered from right there he shall cover thee with his feathers just a imagine imagine a an ego covering his her little babies right just protected from the wind and the storm so so taken care of he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings you're going to trust under the wings you get out from the presence of God you get out of his will you start you start just only going to church because it's the thing to do you get outside of God it's hard to trust under his wings shall thou trust and his truth shall be thy shield and buckler yes and I just I'm just dropping down to verse 14 because he have set his love upon me therefore conclusion I will deliver him you know God really delivered all of us right when we were in sin we gave our heart to God he delivered us and there were still things in our life that he continued to deliver us and we begin to change right as time went on it was like a growing process until until he we could stand back and say we've been delivered a lot by God and I I I can say we set our love upon Him amen we said God we want to serve you you your your word is the truth your way is the right way we're going to serve you we're setting our love upon you and we're going to move in your direction you see these needs we hear you hear the word being preached and you it brings conviction and you say God I got to get rid of this out of my life God help me with the situation and God delivers and that's the way God moves amen you know we can get to a place in our walk with God that we think we got it okay and I want to tell you what happens things creep in things creep in you know what happens after things creep in you need Deliverance again you need to be and now here the key is the same thing set your love upon them set your love upon them you're part of the relationship I want to be where you're at Lord therefore I deliver I will set him on high because he have known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and look at I will even honor him he shall call upon me and I will answer him there are certain there are certain rewards that we [Music] get from trusting God and I say the biggest one I just want to say like this the fruit of trusting God is that it is well what else could we want what else could we want the bottoms falling out on Earth we don't know who's going to come in who's going to stay who's going to be serious with it we don't know any of that but you've got to make sure that you trust God to the point that you follow the word every day amen anybody can say well you know I'm I'm I'm trusting God the the the the the Rapture is going to come and and I I trust God that he's real and I I trust God that he's the he's the Savior but can we trust God for our life every day because this is a challenging thought for me I I trust it is for you well as well amen let's go back to Second Kings but this time I want to go to chapter 4 so I hope this is okay it's going to be more of a laidback reading the scriptures today this is about the great shite woman the thing is she had a reward and we we have a reward too for trusting God Amen so I just want to take our time and try to read this 2 Corinthians chapter 4 starting with verse verse number [Music] eight and it fell on a day that Elisha passed to shunin where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as often as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread and she said unto her husband behold now I perceive that this is a holy man of God which passees by us continually let us make a little chamber and I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stew and a Candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and he laid there and he said to G uh gazi his servant call This shunamite And when he had called her she stood before him and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all this care what is it to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered I dwell among my own people and he said well what then is to be done for her you cannot you cannot help the Bride of Jesus Christ without being rewarded God does not forget your labor of love amen in any in any scenario and I see this this this spirit you know coming out of Elisha and he's telling his servant it's I believe that's God in Elisha working through gazer to to be a blessing to this shite woman do you believe that amen and he said what then is it to be done for her and Gesa answered verily she have no child and her husband is old and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door and he said about this season according to the time of life Thou shalt Embrace a son and she said nay my Lord thou man of God do not lie unto thy handmade and the woman conceived and bear a son at the season that Elisha said unto her according to the time of life isn't that beautiful yeah God understands we we doubt amen the thing is we don't want to continue just moving in a in a vicious way doubting in other words we want to do our best to exercise the fear of the Lord right like I I maybe don't got perfect faith for this but I'm going to have hope I'm going to walk in this direction and I'm going to trust the Lord amen and God God will see us through and when the child was grown it fell on a day when he went to his father uh to the Reapers where they were working and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to the lad carry him uh to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died she went up and laid on the bed of the man of God excuse me and shut the door upon him and went out wow she laid him on the same bed that the man of God laid in amen and the door shut upon him and and they and she went out and she called unto her husband and said send me I pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again and he said wherefore will thou go to him today what what what what what what are you doing this for it is neither new uh New Moon nor Sabbath as she said and she said it shall be well amen I want you to understand what's happening in the side of this woman who just lost her son she's projecting that all will be well look we can make a decision in our trials that things are going to be well or we're going to be battling this unsureness because we're staring at the circumstances well this this woman was not staring at her circumstance this woman was staring at a promise amen God made a promise to her through that prophet and she was going to hold him to it I I I I love that all right what verse we on 24 see I need you for this Bible study then she saddled and asked and said to her servant drive and go forward slack not thy writing for me except I bid thee so she went and came into the man of God to M Mount Carmel and it came to pass when the man of God saw her a far off that he said to Gaza his servant behold Yonder is that shite now run I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well amen now I'm telling you I look at this woman and I believe she's a great woman great is thy faith Jesus said to that woman for I've not found so great a faith know not in Israel you want to be great trust God Amen you want to be great trust God more than you trust anything trust God more than you trust in yourself trust God for your situation that's what makes you great amen it puts you in a place that all will be well and she could have confidence now that all not is going to be well but she now was bringing that future into present because she was now with the man of God she finally arrived in it is well and when she came to the man of God to the hill she called him by the feet but gazer came near to thrust her away what are you doing and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the Lord has hid it from me and have not told me isn't that something God doesn't tell uh His prophets nor his preachers or all the pastors everything he just doesn't but it is the office it is the office and you'll see here that eventually it's made known then she said did I desire a son of my Lord did I not say to you do not deceive do you remember a long long time ago I'm bringing it to your memory then he said to cesa gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and he arose and followed her it was the relationship she was stuck on the relationship I we we we don't want to be outside of the presence of God's anointing amen for our age for our time we don't want to just you know try to live our life you know seven days a week try to enter into church and try to become a better Christian it won't work like that it'll never work like that you can't even find a message that that that vindicates that that that is a a false conception of of of that's all we need to do we got to make sure that that our whole relationship with God is moving forward with him and not assuming because I've done this in the past I must be okay where I'm at with God and I know in this in this aspect it can be a little bit strong and I'm not meaning to put that upon you as a burden but look I know the devil I've met him before and he wants to get us to a place where we're we're sleeping in Zion we're relaxing in Zion and before you know it things are just falling apart and we don't know how to gain control of the situation we don't know how to get it back to normality we don't ought to get back to that place where we trust God and not fear against our problems you know if we're not careful pretty soon our problems can be those of our own household so I'm saying the answer is submit to the word whatever God told you submit to it start trusting him and hold to that no matter what happens amen trust him and hold to him because that's what this woman did and G Gaza passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and he told him saying the child is not awakened but now notice she still said it is well and when Elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed and he went in therefore and shut the door upon the twain B upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord and he went up and laid upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child waxed warm and he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes and he called geser and said call this this shite so he called her and when she was coming unto him he said take up thy son then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out that is the fruit of trusting God all will be well now it now notice it started in her heart and what was she leaning Upon A promise that was given to her by God's Prophet amen and so she held on to that you don't just hold on to the word of God for a little while until things are you know Saucy better you keep holding on to the word of God and you don't ever let go of that because you may need it down the road and her faith was not in the staff her faith was not in Gesa but Elisha was the represented God on Earth to the people right and her faith was in that word that came from God himself because it was thus sayeth the Lord and we've got to treat the message and treat the word of God as if it is God not just some nice story this is put in here to give us Faith to hold on to God and that's the only time we could ever say all is as well right amen cuz Faith's final resting place is in the word of God right and the result of of of everything being well in our life it comes from trusting God no matter what a't that beautiful amen there are benefits only given to those who trust God in his word you know everybody gets blessed of God but everybody does not receive the benefits that only come from trusting God now here's the thing we all trust God right but how much do we trust him you remember the story about the the the one guy who was real talented and he could take a wheelbarrow you know over this rope and without falling over Niger Falls and everybody just applauded him and they were just you know cheering for him and he would even put some weight in the in the wheelbarrow and and go across and everybody just thought he was just a great person and they really believed in him and he said well how much do you believe I believe there's nobody that could do what you do I believe you could you could do it again and again it says do you believe enough that you would get in the wheelbarrow and let me take you so I say to you how much do you trust I say I'm in a place I I am in a place I feel I need to trust God more that there's more that I need to trust him it's it's one thing to sit in the car and say you know son you're going to be a good driver you know I just know you're I know you're just starting to take your test and get your your license and I'm encouraging you and you're going to I I believe that you're going to be a good driver but eventually you have to turn that wheel over to your son and you got to sit in the passenger seat and you got to go you got to you're going to see how much you trust am are you with me so I'm telling you we're going to go through trials we're going to get sicknesses things are going to happen in our life things are going to fall apart and we got to stand up and Trust am though he slay me I still trust though this person's yelling at me though I just lost my job though this though that though nobody care I'm G to trust God Amen it's it's really something it's ironic to me that our character is so important to God that he would allow everything our bottom to fall out in our life lose every friend lose every job lose our money lose everything because he's interested in one thing character because that's the only thing he can dwell with on the other side he ain't going to dwell with any of our our abilities of what we've done with anything he wants to drawell our character and he'll cause things to happen so we learn to trust him I just I I I think we can have confidence in our life where we're at whatever we're going through God knows everything about it and that we we do not have to fret we do not have to we don't have to fear we don't have to say how am I going to handle this situation all we have to do is trust trust and the more that you trust the more that God moves in your behalf and the less you trust the more you're going to find yourself complaining yes that's that's the truth the less that you trust God the more you're going to complain about your situation all right Psalms 37:3 trust in the Lord and do good oh responsibility trust in the Lord do good so sht thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed that's right I tell you I've been in Catholic churches being being fed by God Amen because of one reason because I trusted God was going to meet me amen that's it not that I had this was the all for all the best Catholic Church no not because of that because of my relationship with God Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thy heart there's another thing we've all trusted we've all done good we've all delighted but have we done it enough right it doesn't say Delight thyself once in a while Delight thyself also in the Lord he shall give the the desires of th heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass these are the benefits of trusting God all right now I want us to take a look at something here in Galatians 6 if you want to turn there Galatians 6 we have a part to play to get back from God what he wants to give us there is there is in our life there are times that uh I'm G I'm gonna just uh we've got some young we got Luke we've got James we got the two sleeping boys uh over here and and we got one in the back I can't see you you is that Gabe Gabe we missed you Sunday all right so there are times that our parents when we asked our parents for something can I have this and they said sure they didn't Sint they didn't question they they yes you're my son you're my you're my daughter I want to give it to you and then we like that so we keep asking and they keep giving and then there comes a time that we ask and they say but if you do this and this and this I will now that's just them teaching you how to mature because you know if if you wanted this and the parents knew that you would do your what they want you to do they would just give this to you and say do this this and this but because we're learning we're not always going to do want to do everything that we're asked to do so our parents do have to withhold certain things before all is well well but when you learn to sow seeds of doing well then you will get well are you with me all right Galatians 66 let's look at it let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things be not deceived God is Not mock whatsoever a man Seth that shall he reap so if a man is sewing I doubt I question I I I'm I'm complaining this shouldn't be a a murmuring and that you that's exactly what you're going to read you cannot plant corn and really want watermelon that's right amen if you want watermelon you got to plant watermelon seeds and you can't just say well I want the blessings of God but I'm going to seow all these seeds of of of negativity right amen just it's it's just a law it's a law amen for he that so to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soow to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be weary in what in welld doing don't get tired of it it's the way of life for in due season we shall reap if we faint not so you got to keep doing well and you can't back up you can't faint you can't say well I can't go on anymore I mean you can say that but don't believe that because you're fainting right men all ought to always pray and not faint so you feel you're you're losing grip on the Promises on the on the relationship with God the first thing we need to do is pray get back to him get back to the importance of of of putting God first in your relationship with God forget the church for a second forget the home forget your work it's between you and God you put God first everything else gets in line then right all right let's not be weary and well-doing God is faithful for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith right you can guarantee God is going to be behind that so if we continue to be faithful God will give us a good crop amen that's what that means be not not be not weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not if if we stay faithful in other words our heart is where it needs to be when we come to church when we put on the tape when we read our Bible when we get on our knees because we're entering in the Tabernacle that's that one thing that we're Desiring and that we're seeking after that we will be in his presence right amen all right we got just a little bit time for one more Parable this I'm I'm telling you Brother Bruce this is the less notes that I've had in so long and I still didn't make it through but that's that's just the way it is all right turn with me if you would to Matthew 25 Matthew 25 oh my my there is so much here there is so much here um H H I'm just going to I'm just going to trust the Lord right now because I'm looking at my notes and the things I I got here at the end are kind of like you know a good good thing but I I'm just I'm just going to read this this is a starting with verse 14 it's it's the parable of the talents and the reason I'm I'm wanting to get into this is because each one of these servants becomes addressed at the end of their life when they stand before the Lord um how they did with their life with with the things that God gave him and I think the biggest thing that God's given all of us exactly the same you know I I can't I can't play instruments and I can't do a lot of stuff but the one thing that we all have in common is we have time and it's a gift when you wake up in the morning how many says Lord thank you for this new day you've given me that shows it's a gift it's a gift and and you God wants us to occupy until he returns right that's what what he said all right for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who when called his own servants he delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents on to another two and unto another one and to every man according to his several ability and straightway he took his journey did you know the Bible tells us that God has given every single person spiritual gifts that's right we've got natural gifts we know that but he has given each one spiritual gifts that's right you can find that in First Corinthians 12:11 severally as he will and even though at the end of that chapter he tells us to covet earnestly the best of gifts he says yet I show unto you a more excellent way and we know that more excellent way is perfect love and that when we have perfect love even chapter 13 says those other things shall be done away with but as we said before that perfect love is not going to come if we're not being faith to do the things that we should be doing it just it just won't come all right verse 16 then he that had received five talents went and he traded with the same and made them other five talents it kind of sounds like he stole the other guy's five talents because he traded with him the same but through his trading through his ability through his time through his effort he literally won five more souls and likewise he had he that had received two he also gained another two and he that had received one went and died in the earth and hid his Lord's money his talent and after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckon with them and he and so he had and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents say Lord Lord thou deliver unto me five talents behold I have gained beside them five talents more H and his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a a few things a few things that was God's testimony I didn't put too much on you that you couldn't bear I I will make you ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord and He also that had received two talents came and said Lord thou deliver unto me two talents and behold I I've gained two other talents besides them and his lord said the same thing well done good and faithful servant in other words he sold the right seeds amen he sold good and he received good amen he received I'm trusting God that He gave me this time this Talent this ability to share Christ to to help the kingdom to to move forward and give God something more than what he had and I'm going to do it and if I do it he's going to reward me it's exactly what happened thou has been faithful for a few things I'll make the ruer over many things enter thou un into the joy of the Lord that he which received the one Talent came and said Lord you know my situation was a little unique I'm I Bas I I know you understand everything I'm going through because I told everybody on Earth God knows my heart well because God knows your heart doesn't mean you're exempt from following the word it's still required of you Lord I knew now now listen to this I knew that thou art a hard man now this is the description of the the side of accountability of God that's what you're reading right here this is how how God is going to be in judgment when he holds us accountable this is the side that we don't see because see Jesus never said I come to condemn I come to judge I come to destroy he didn't say that he said I come to save he said but the same word which I've spoken unto you now that is the same word that's going to judge you at the end so we see here this is the the the side of God that maybe we don't we don't spend enough time maybe thinking about because I think it's a provoker right for those who are are are are scared or who just want to live their life for themselves Lord I knew that th are a hard man reaping where you did not sow and Gathering where you did not straw in other words God is expecting you to labor and give it to him is that really any different than us going to work getting a check or getting Social Security and we still give God 10% and he didn't do any of the labor it's no different God owns our life amen we belong to him and he's he's a hard man he's a hard man and because he has an expectation that we need to multiply whatever God has given us and give it back to him at the end and I what I love about this message and this word is we don't have to wait till the end to find out how important this is we can we can know about it today all right now and I was afraid he said I was afraid so he why was he afraid why was he afraid because he knew that he wasn't doing what God wanted him to do that's why he was afraid and look if you make God your Tabernacle if you abide in his presence you won't be afraid amen it's only if you're just wanting to do your own thing then you're going to be afraid and I was afraid and went and hid thy town in the earth and lo there there's yours there's my life I what I gave you here here it is I'm I'm here what an attitude notice this believer also called Jesus Lord it was a churchgoer but he did not allow God to be Lord over him and that's why he was afraid and his Lord answered and said unto him thou Wicked and slothful look at that slothful he could have been a millionaire but thou Wicked and sful servant thou knew that I reap right did not so and I gather where I did not straw thou owest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received my own with Usery take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him that had 10 talents for unto everyone that have shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that have not shall be taken away even that which he have and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth now it wasn't that I wanted to end on this Parable because it kind of has a sad ending but I I'll say it like this do not look at this one servant as as who you are only look at this last servant as who you do not want to be and and look at being faithful to do something for the kingdom of God because if you sow well then you will reap well done if you s trust you will reap all as well amen let's Stand Together I'd like to go ahead and uh sing it is well everybody has probably heard at one time or another but brother Stafford sta spafford I think it's how you pronounce it he was a presbyterian brother and he also was a businessman and he had lost uh a lot of money uh just through the down of the economy and then after that he had some real estate and that got burned up in the Chicago Fire and he he basically was drling down to anything so he wanted to send his wife and his four uh children uh to to hear D Moody uh over overseas and while they were going overseas their ship uh came in contact with another ship and it literally uh broke and it it it it fell apart and uh the four daughter or the four children they all perished they all drowned and the the mother was saved and when she was able to get a note back to her husband that was just two words and the words was saved alone saved alone and so now after losing everything and trying to do good and help his family he's now faced with losing all his children and so he gets on the ship to go over to the other side so he can be with his grieving wife and as he was traveling on this sea he couldn't but help to think this was this was the waters that took my children and it was when they passed over the the the place where they felt this is where the ship went down he went back into his cabin and he he penned this song it is well now I'm thinking about this and see he must have been thinking about that shut woman he must have been looking Beyond certain current circumstances and I'm saying Saints look we can't be coming to church hoping just something is just going to change we've got to start applying Faith to the word of God because if you believe it'll work amen so let's think about these words as we sing it it is well when peace like a River attended my way when Sorrows like sea Billows roll whatever my lck thou has taught me to say it is what It Is Well with My Soul It Is Well with My [Music] Soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul though Satan should buit though trial should come let this bless Assurance control what assurance that Christ ha regarded my helpless estate and have shed his own blood for my soul It Is Well with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul sing it like David said my sin oh the bless of this glor thought my sin not in part but that only make us so happy nail to the cross and I bear it no more praise the Lord praise the Lord oh my soul It Is Well with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul and Lord haste the day when my faith shall be sight the clouds be rolled back like a [Music] scroll the trumpet sound and the Lord shall descend e even so it is well with our soul It Is Well with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul [Music] amen can you say Amen to that Amen to to think that this man when he penned it he really believed what he was saying he really believed it and as you sing it you can sing it like you're really mean it amen amen just a second brother bman we're just going to go to the Lord in a word of prayer I wonder if there' be anyone here today say the Lord spoke to me and I want to be remembered in prayer amen amen God bless you God sees you that are live streaming God sees you if I can't see you amen let's look to him in prayer our heavenly father Lord we thank you that you have provided a way for us Lord that we don't have to be afraid no matter

for this we're thankful to you that you provided it for us and father I pray that the words Lord that we heard today Lord they would be accompanied with faith and they would be accompanied because of that faith it would be accompanied with Revelation to every heart Lord May there be an assurance no matter what Lord the re what the the the hand or that that uh thought was behind the hand that was raised I pray that there would be an assurance and a confidence in each one Lord that you're going to take us through whatever would come in front of us whatever test whatever trial would be in front
