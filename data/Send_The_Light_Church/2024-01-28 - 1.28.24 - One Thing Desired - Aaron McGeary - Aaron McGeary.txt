believe all things are possible only believe amen praise the Lord so wonderful being in the house of the Lord today God bless you if you could just take your Bibles we'll be reading from psalms 27 we'll read the first six verses there happy to be here with you always considered a great privilege to be able to come and just spend time with family um sometimes I have a little bit of a um difficulty explaining just who it is I'm going to visit Michigan uh because not only do I consider um I note you know brother John is my father-in-law but I consider him to be a dear friend and a mentor it's one that someone I look up to so if I say I'm just going to visit the in-laws it doesn't quite convey uh just what's in store for me necessarily and then I feel the same way about the whole family and sister Cheryl uh just a wonderful friend and always had such wonderful Fellowship around the things of the Lord so for me it's wonderful to be here and obviously my wife is like a daughter to Brother John so she always looks forward to coming my kids are like grandkids so we we really look forward to coming for a lot of personal reasons but also the friendship and fellowship for myself personally is always wonderful even with Johnny uh you know people I say he's my brother-in-law but he's one of my best friends so just uh it's wonderful to come here and be with all of you and I want to say happy anniversary to Michael and Amanda seven years today happy anniversary God bless you that is wonderful isn't it congratul ulations brother Michael all those who said you couldn't do it seven years and he God's wonderful so we just wanted to say happy anniversary Brother Bruce was mentioning he had an anniversary that just passed one years from heart surgery and you're looking great God is so good amen so good we're so grateful for that amen if you could now just look in your Bibles psalms 27 we'll start with verse one we'll read to verse 6 you'll recognize this text uh in the message brother Bram takes it when he preaches the Rapture so this is not just a song it's not just poetry but it's Prophecy of the very moments that you're living in right now the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock there's your there's the time we're in this wonderful Rapture season and now my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord amen amen you can be seated we do desire that God would bless the word which we've read and that it would just be Amplified To Us by Revelation and I have just a real uh real simple thought today it's just wonderful to see the house of the Lord full and all of you making it out uh to church I I get the feeling that if everybody showed up you'd have to start bringing out chairs and so it's so good to see everyone here we know many some are traveling some are sick uh but it's just so good to see everyone here and I trust that you're expecting and and listening to what the Lord might have for you personally and individually but it should it's going to be real simple today real direct uh simply direct and so we just trust that it will be a blessing to you if we could just focus on verse four as we read this already Psalms 27:4 my title is going to be one thing desired one thing desired pulling it straight from this very verse here where David says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after so he's kind of combining his desire to what he seeks and his actions that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple the subject of the house of the Lord is something I've just been studying I studying it personally for some time I just begin to Minister on it at our home Church in Phoenix and so there's just a really large context to what David is saying here and there's a lot that relates to the end times and the Rapture there's a lot that relates to uh the Tabernacle and the temple the house of the Lord and the one that David desired to build and the one that was built and what it represents so there's a large context to this but just want to focus on one aspect in this scripture even just zeroing in on one aspect or one phrase from this entire reading and he says that he desired one thing one thing have I desired of the Lord so there was I say one one main object that I have every day if you're to distill my life down to one thing if you're to kind of summarize what my singular wish would be this is the one thing as we could put it this way kind of the ruling desire of his heart everything else was judged by this for him to say one thing means I I judge everything by this if it won't further this ambition if it won't get me closer to this then I weigh everything by this desire and when he says one I'd like to put it this way kind of suggests that there's an exclusion of things one thing have I desired so he's excluding everything else you say well David what about the palace nope that's not what I desire what about to be back home and to be in Bethlehem what about uh uh what about wealth and what about power what about Fame what about victories and War he says he would say no there's one thing I've desired above everything else and in other words I I I I read somewhere where it kind of described it this way that if David was to lose family if he was to lose his own health if he was to lose riches it wouldn't hurt as bad as not having this so he said one thing have I desired he's saying that I I may not get this and I may not get that but those would not hurt if I if those things are lost whether it be health or uh um wealth or fame or even the throne if I lose all that it wouldn't hurt as much as if I lost this one thing or didn't have this one thing this is the the peak of my prayer this is the climax of my desires above all other things that I've asked for one thing have I desired the Lord that will I seek after so he desired one thing and because he desired one thing he's saying I sought one thing this has become the primary objective of my life this is my governing Pursuit this is my main aim if I if I take a step and it's getting going to get me further from this I don't want to take that step I if I'm going to do something that's going to make it harder for me to do this to seek this then I don't want to take that step and I I believe that when David says one thing have I desired the Lord that will I seek after H to say desire and seek I think he's acknowledging the pretense and the vanity of lip service oh I really love that I really I really love to go to church well when's the last time you went right I really love the word of God when's the last time you read the Bible and oh I just love to talk to God when's the last time you prayed and so David is even kind of acknowledging that a lot of people can say they want one thing oh was I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and that's as far as it goes right I was just glad that I heard it I didn't necessarily meant I went and so there's a uh it's kind of good to preach it live to people at church because you be like you know what this that's right I'm here I'm in church but the to to say I desire and seek it it's kind of acknowledging that sometimes we can say things but not actually follow up in action if the heart truly desires one thing then the one thing Des IR ired will be sought after it'll become a priority you sometimes corporations or entities or organizations have a governing priority and you can have bylaws you can have rules and regulations you can have all sorts of parameters that you operate within but there sometimes is a governing priority that if you're in a situation you can't remember all the rules and you're not sure what to do ask yourself what is the one thing we're trying to accomplish and in that given instance make a decision that furthers the objective the main objective so it's a governing priority this is what we this is what dictates our actions this is what we go by to tell us what to do in a situation we're not sure of so if you have a priority it's the one thing that's more important than anything else and David to say one thing have I desired of the Lord I think it's expressing a hunger a desire as brother John was leading songs I was like well he's he's pretty inspired today he should just preach and I talked to Brother Bruce out there said maybe he should just preach since we he maybe was expecting to lead songs and I just got turn kept getting turned down but brother John just having some of that inspiration about hunger and desire David is expressing desire he's expressing hunger clearly in what he's saying but it's also indicates value when he says one thing have I desired it's not that he just had a hanen for something and he couldn't explain it like he was addicted to something that he hated but it was something that he valued showed some high esteem or great importance to the thing that he desired in Psalms 26:8 says Lord I've loved the habitation of thy house in the place where thine honor dwelleth the place where the shikina glory rest the place where God was pleased to dwell the place that he put his name and David is expressing desire I love the habitation of the house one thing have I desired that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life he valued the house of the Lord now again I'm not going to get into what that would mean and what that would represent but it was a place where God's honor dwelt it was a place that God's habitation was a place that he put his name a place where the shikina glory would rest and would be at home amen and so David is expressing value and if you if you value something you recognize its usefulness so so you say oh I really love that well why do you love that I just really love it and they don't really give a reason you question whether or not they could really value it but when someone understands what it is and what it does and its usefulness then they really value it value often times is is kind of assessed in one's its capacity for good or what it can bring its importance or its worth and David is expressing value and I I want to maybe I haven't get a lot given a lot of context what's in my mind and what's in my heart as I say this so you might just be kind of on edge like where is he going with this that's a good place to be because then you just kind of follow tension and suspense is really good and so if you're if you're wondering maybe need a little bit more cont text I I'm challenging our hearts today on what we value what we desire so that's that's certainly at kind of what's at the heart of the things that we're talking about and David is expressing desire and value in Matthew chapter 6: 3132 and 33 Jesus says therefore take no thought let there not be any anxiety or concern saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed these these things of eating drinking and clothing these would be the essentials kind of the base needs uh that we might have if I'm going to make it many days I need to eat if I'm going to make it many days I need to drink and if I'm going to be able to make my way through my days I need to be clothed says for after all these things do the Gentiles seek now as we read that eating drinking and clothing it says nothing of the character or nature of the eating and drinking and clothing so it's not that they were seeking things that in themselves were these uh were needs in the sense that they were evil but Gentiles seek them because we need them but he says for your Heaven he says for after all these things do the Gentiles seek but then he says for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things when it says after these things the Gentiles seek and other this was their Chief intention uh that they engaged in seeking only seeking what they would eat and what they would drink and what they would wear that this was the only good that if there was any good it was what we're eating what we're drinking and how we're clothed and where we would live it's how well can we um dress and how well can we eat and can we preserve our life as long as we can and so this is telling us Jesus is telling us that one's diligence to something is a direct reflection of one's desires that if you you're diligent to seek after good food and a lot of food or this drink or this clothing all those things then it it's a reflection of one's desire towards it if you seek after it and you put a lot of attention to it after these things the Gentiles seek in other words these are the things that they valued above everything else what they ate what they would drink and what they would wear but then Jesus turns it completely around says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness in all these things shall be added unto you I know it's it's it's simplistic that the Gentiles seek after food drink and clothing but it it points out to all the different things that we need in our daily lives for for comfort and to live and to uh to make our way through life and there's maybe a lot of lot of things that relate to us not just as easy as saying what we shall drink and we know this just even if we want water right you say well I want water is it ph balanced is it smart water I mean what does that mean is it collect my connect to my Bluetooth what's smart water and there's different things you can't even just get water anymore and you say well I just want water well I want spring water well where was that spring you say well I want a good clean spring all right so spring water and then you go to Bas says but is that a plastic or glass bottle we can't drink water anymore without worrying about whether or not it's going to kill us and so when we talk about what you're going to eat what you're going to drink and what you're going to wear we realize there's a lot of decisions there's a lot of different details and aspects when it comes to these things that that we say well I like water and I want it to be uh spring water and I want it to be from the south and I want it to be in a glass bottle and I don't want it to be more than 8.6 ounces and we have a lot of precise things that we have it's very complicated just try to go by anything anymore and there's just so many choices and so many different things being presented but Jesus has a way of simplifying everything down to one phrase seek ye first the kingdom of God all the different kind of water we can eat all the cereals we can have and everything that we might want to eat drink or be clothed with it says just seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you what are we talk what we believe God hides himself in Simplicity we believe that God hides himself in Simplicity therefore that's where we find God is in Simplicity and when our lives are full of all these different details and desires and things that he want then God is not in those things God is in the Simplicity and the single the simple things and the ultimate Simplicity that we could have is when all of our desires are reduced to one right look at that the the Tim ultimate Simplicity is to have one desire and someone says well what do you desire above everything else well I want to have this I want to have that I want to have this I want to have that well that that that makes life complicated at worst life is complex in itself and then we just complicate it but the ultimate Simplicity would have desires reduced to one David says one thing have I desired Lord that will I seek after Jesus says well your heavenly father knows you need to eat you need to drink you need to be cloth knows that you need a car knows that you need jobs know that you need all these things but just simplify all your desires to to one simplified to one seek ye first the kingdom of God our ultimate aspiration to be focused on a singular objective one thing have I desired and I'll say this and I want to be very deliberate how I say it because this would be to me this would be one of those things if you could get this you could get this part out of this service it would serve you well but as we live life should be the process of determining value True Value which leads us to Simplicity that as we live life should be the process as each day goes by and week goes by and month goes by and years go by and decades go by that life should be the process of determining those things that are truly valuable things that are of actual worth and that leads us to make decisions to simplify our lives that make sense yes that we should we should have that maturing process in our lives where we're able to say you know that doesn't matter that doesn't really matter doesn't matter as much as it used to matter and we have this as we grow life becomes this process of learning what counts and what matters and what really is important to us and because we recognize the things that are important we begin to simplify our lives around that because we could be honest I think in the day and age that we're living in we just get spread so thin I found myself thinking a lot about a subject on uh you know certain particular subject I was like man I I want to preach that I want to preach that and I thought I think I preached that last time I was here and and they would probably be thinking that I was losing my mind if I just preached the same thing over again and that'd be good because then you just probably pray for me more or pray for your pastor for asking me to preach I don't know how that would work necessarily but as we were talking before about how technology and uh video games and our cell phones and just everything's trying to grab our attention and get in our minds and things just aren't simple things are just very uh trying to grab our attention and get a click uh hook into our desires I think we're just really spread thin in a lot of ways so many things we got to click or we have to update things we have to check in on things that we need we need the information it needs to be fed and we have so many irons in the fire and we're probably thinking that H if I could just attain this then I'm going to be satisfied and we can stop right isn't that what we kind of all thought you know we go Blue we won the National Championship right you we did that right and we're going to be happy but now we're all like crazy about why not the lion are going to do it today and we're not satisfied and I promise you if the Lions win the Super Bowl you all are going to be talking about the Red Wings right because nothing ever satisfied nothing ever plates there's there's always going to be another season there's always going to be another sport there's always going to be another thing to well which president do we want to win who's going to get the nomination and I bring it up and surface it not just to be relevant about what's currently happening in your area but just to recognize that there's we have a lot of desires a lot of things that we look for things that make us happy irons in the fire and maybe think man that I don't even have time to think about the Lions then maybe in your life you're spread thin because you're managing a household you're working you're paying the bills you're looking after this you're looking after that and we find ourselves so spread thin that we have all these things that we're anxious about and that we care about and Jesus says reduce it all to one if I could put it this way in our youth and it was wonderful just to see these young people continuing to grow and get old older and sitting on the front row singing the songs those are the voices you hear when you stand up here in song service that in our youth there's many things that receive our investment there's things that we value things that we we give a lot of thought to things that we give a lot of time to and even as we begin to make money and our gift will invest a lot of money in certain things things that maybe adults would be like ah I don't know if I'd spend my money on that or I don't know if I'd spend my time on that but it's just it's peculiar and unique to our youth but a lot of things that we want to do things we want to experience and places we want to go Paul puts it this way when writing to Timothy flee also youthful lust in 2 Timothy 2:22 flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart amen and when he calls it youthful lust he's show speaking of desires of a particular age I think by calling it youthful lust you can say there's things that are peculiar to young people there's things that they would desire things that they would want to do things that they might be challenged with and things that they might feel are important well I wish I could fit in or I want to do this or I I really like that and it's just indicative of their age whether it be a desire to fit in or their their passion meter is very very high and they don't really have maybe a lot of things putting that in check so there's a lot of things that they desire it's a lust a passion or craving uh the Bible the word that used is like an inflaming wine it's intoxicating it's a desire that influences judgment so it's a desire that's going to determine value but then it's also one that determines Behavior what you seek after am and Paul says flee youthful lust things that kind of intoxicate you and energize you and sensitize you to certain things to where you value it you want it so you're going to pursue after it say these are things that are peculiar to an age we might say the same thing as you get older that there's certain things that relate to uh to an age where maybe when you're at a particular age if you're told to take a nap you refuse and then as you get older there's a time in life where you wish you could take a nap nap and so it just shows that there's things that we value at different ages he said these youthful lust there's a lot of things that might intoxicate you a lot of things that inflame you a lot of things that you desire after he says but flee them and this question of flee and follow is a challenge to mature and maturity is not marked by physical development but by by spiritual maturity when he says oh uh uh flee and follow he's not saying that you're just going to reach a magic AG and all of a sudden youthful us don't matter anymore but there's a way that as we grow there should be a narrowing of desire and a zeroing in on value to one thing am you look at a 17year old and you say well I get it why they why they're in they have four or five different fantasy football teams and I get it while they they they they want to pursue this and they want to pursue that because it's just indicative of the age but if someone was you know 50 years old and they were playing video games all day long you might be like well you you begin to question have they learned anything in 50 years have they found and I guess if you're saying that they're a multi-millionaire because they play video games all day that's a separate discussion but there's things that we recognize have you determined value have you lived your life conscious enough and aware enough have you learned in life that there's certain things that have weight and things that have True Value and because you've determined value you've simplified your life to where those things that are truly valued are pursued or do you still just have all these love in these desires that drive you around Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13:11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things if I could if I want to say manhood because he says man but I could say adulthood or maturity adulthood is marked by becoming not aging if it was just aging we would all just age into manhood we would Age into adulthood but we don't have to think any further than The Neighbor Next Door to see somebody who no matter how old they are they're just not really mature right I just say that kind of as a way of easing the tension that well we're not talking about ourselves maybe we're talking about somebody we know but adulthood is marked by becoming and notice he says when I became a man so he's become a man says I put away so it was then he woke up one morning and all of a sudden his voice started cracking and he oh my goodness I'm becoming a man no whether he says he had to put something away when I became a man I put away childish things I put away childish desires I I put in check youthful lust I recognize yeah maybe there's this inclination but I'm going to bring that under subjection it's a conscious effort to say that I want to I recognize what true value is I recognize things that are important I recognize that there's certain things I pursue that bring me a real benefit in life and that benefit my family and benefit my well-being physically and emotionally and those are the things I want to have preeminence I want to pursue the things of God and nothing else because there's real value in this and begin to moderate desire in light of the one thing desired Hallelujah brother Brandon makes this statement in the sermon what hearest thou Elijah I think it's just real good as a challenging uh note I believe that we've been children long enough God's going to turn his church into manhood now so it's an hour of maturity and maybe there's been a a a childish child likeness to us he says and we played and frolicked as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity notice again there there it almost implies as Paul says it even as he challenges Timothy and even as he says it himself when I was a child I I I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things and then brother abam saying that we've got to put away childish things and and take on manhood it implies that there's some conscious effort on our part to recognize maturity to recognize things that are of higher importance and meaning recog not just desire but value something and say that's what I want to pursue am and I'm not going to pursue this so well do you like it do well you know I'm admit I I get a lot out of that it does a lot for my flesh or it's enjoyable whatever that might be there's this conscious decision where we put away some things and we take on one thing there's a poem that was written by William Wordsworth it's called Ode to duty it's quite a remarkable poem but as he's writing he makes the statement a a a and one of the stanzas he says I feel the weight of chance desires what a phrase the the weight I feel the weight of chance desires he's talking about Duty and he's bringing it within even a spiritual context but it was this phrase chance desires that really got my attention because the world is full of enticement ments kind of mention that to the young people there's ways that it just kind of gets in our minds and catches our attention a lot of things that other people are doing that we kind of have the pho where we we want to be what do what everyone else is doing and we want to we want to fit in we want to have the language we want to have the experience there's a the world is full of enticements and there's a lot of things that I would call indulgences of opportunity and if you don't know what I'm talking about it's those things that are available to us right at the point that we're checking out at a grocery store right you go to some electronic store you need to go in you need a new keyboard and and you get a keyboard and then they they funnel you down rows of candies and little gadgets and all sorts of $2 items and what are they want they're wanting you to indulge because of opportunity I went in to get a keyboard and I left with more calories and more sugar than I have in my pantry back home at an electronic store why because there's certain things that they want you to indulge because of opportunity this is what this writer is talking about I feel the weight of chance desires the impulse buys to where there's always something that we can click on there's always something that we can buy and on sale and do it now and there's a timer right you better you better click now I remember one time and sister Elizabeth you shouldn't have laughed because I know what you're thinking about and I'm thinking about the same thing we were I was out preaching it was one of the first places we went and ministered I think after we were married a and I went into the bathroom and I came out and Elizabeth had in the time that I went to the bathroom she had bought something that she saw at infomercial on the television for because they said Act now right that's what that's what that's what happens when you raise a girl who's never watched Television right she doesn't know that this this is on all the time this price is going to be there not just in five minutes but five years from now but they do it because they create some sort of sense of urgency I better click I better buy this now because if I don't buy this in the next 20 minutes I can't get it in two hours with Amazon Prime and so you go ahead and buy it and then you realize no I got to add a few more items to it to get to $25 in order to get it on time and what are these are impulse buys because that's the way the mind works it's the way the body can be dragged around impulse buys chance desires as this poet put it I feel the weight of chance desires notice it's the chance and it's plural desires things that are opportunistic just by chance just by circumstance but David isn't being he's not putting it to chance about what he desired he said one thing have I desired that will I seek after has nothing that nothing to do with chance that's right in 1 Peter chapter 2:2 it says as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby this kind of gives us uh the proper aim amen as Paul says it to Timothy as Paul says it about himself as brother brandham even remarked about the church as it relates to maybe a church age and a growing that we ought to become to take on maturity put away immaturity Peter says he acknowledges the youth and says as newborn babes so he's acknowledging compulsion in our youth and desires that we might have of a particular age but he says as newborn babes who might put anything in their mouth might reach for anything and do anything he says desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby despite our youthful compulsion within despite maybe all the things that catch our attention it's asking us to simplify our desires to one thing desire the milk of the word brother bramman the sermon God hided himself in Simplicity then revealed himself in the same remember the ultimate Simplicity would be to have our desires reduced to one says many times teenage children and sometimes adults will get to you know young people pass a note or cut up or something in church says now you're old enough to know better than that you should know better than that and if you saw a little fivey year old doing it you'd say well you know that's what 5-year-olds do if you see somebody doodling and drawing and doing pictures and you look over there and say well that's an eight-year-old they said that would that would make sense but if that was the pastor like brother John I didn't know you were such an artist right what what is what's in his mind or even your parents if you look over your parents are writing their grocery list out or they're they're they're uh they're doing Wordle right there in church or something and you'd be like well where's their mind at what do they value and we and you would you but for if it was a kid doing oh you know that's kind of what kidss do and kids struggle with that and that but brother B saying there's a point where we ought to know better I want you to think of that the Simplicity of life that there's things that get our attention things that we might do pass notes cut up do something he's using church as an example he says you're old enough to know better you should know better than that he says if you expect to be a real man someday and raise a family to the kingdom of God then start it off in the beginning and act right and do right and there's the challenge to even and young people the challenge to young men even those four sitting here on the front row and the young ladies that are here that even in my youth and I might have a lot of things that I want to do a lot of things I want to pursue that there has to be this acknowledgement that as life continues life needs to be my desires need to be reduced to one and right now begin to pursue and seek the right things desire the sincere milk of the word we ought to know better if we want to be mature one day we want to be successful spiritually I'd even argue if you want to have integrity and do right even as a decent human being you got to start off right in the beginning act right and do right Paul said in Philippians chapter 3: 7 and 8 but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ ye doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ Noti that in time Paul at one point might have thought it it was great gain to understand the scriptures as he did it's great gain to be taught by the teachers that he was taught under great gain to be able to distinguish a a true Zeal and these different things that he thought might have thought were ex uh uh excellent to him and set him apart and Paul in some place just gives his resume hey Pharisee of the Pharisees and this and that and there were things that were gained to him that he had accumulated through life but now he comes to a place in life and says all the accolades all the things that could have accompass all the things I've accumulated I count them lost for Christ he had reduced it down to one thing that was gain and looked at everything else and said yeah you know what the trophies and and the ribbons and the badges and the and the high scores and all the accolades and all the popularity and all the wealth and all the fame I counted but lost that I might know Christ and that I may win Christ yes life had been simplified to one Pursuit life had been simplified to one desire do you want to memorize this do you want to compass that do you want to do this do you want said no I want to win Christ one thing Matthew chapter 6 we'll start with verse 19 I'd like to end up on verse 24 we might jump around a few things as we go through this he says in Matthew 6: 19 lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and r doth corrupt and where thieves break through and still he talks about Earthly Treasures lay up not for yourselves Treasures upon Earth these Earthly Treasures it's a just the storage of good and precious things and and and applies kind of a hoarding of valuables and he brings a lot into this as Jesus has already said or will say speaks of what we shall eat what we shall drink and what we shall be clothed with he touches on all of it right here here where moth and rust do corrupt and where thieves break through and still The Moth relates to the things that we would wear the garments that we would clothe ourselves with the rust the word that's used there isn't that of metals but that of food that would perish and corrupt and he says that thieves break through and still it' be the the gold the jewelry the finery of Life he's bringing us he's kind of laying the ground for what he says in verses 31 and 32 the things that perish the things that are unstable the things that are always changing well they're not constant they're not sure lay up not for yourselves Treasures upon Earth if it's clothing The Moth can eat it if it's food it it's gonna uh it's G to corrupt it's gonna it's going to expire and if you even think about it when it comes to food I I've noticed this and I just kind of comment on it that there's some foods that we could really really like and you know what given enough time sometimes it just disappears they just stop making it what do you mean the MC rib is gone I can't have a MC rib yeah they just stopped serving it Taco Bell just says you know what we're not serving tacos anymore there's too many tacos everywhere we want to do something different and just overnight your favorite thing can be gone so there's a lot greater application to this than sometimes we think there's things we wear things that we eat things that we buy thevs can come through and take it and steal it these are things that are not stable there's these are things that are not consonant they're not sure brother Brahman the sermon handwriting on the wall says as the Gentile age was issued into rotness and drinking and women and carousing Gentile dispensation going out in the same manner we're going out to chaos from drinking and drunken our little teenage children out here in school they start them off with smoking cigarettes and they go from there to marijuana I know that's maybe that might be a little oldfashioned just to talk about it but look where we are that that brother bradam is identifying maybe what we would call a gateway drug where there's certain habits and certain things we establish in life that just make it easier to do the next thing certain patterns and certain things we reach for and certain things that we ingest or we we vocalize or that we enjoy and he saying hey you know what they start smoking cigarettes but then cigarettes that you know that becomes Blas and that that's not good enough you got to move on to the next one why because the eye is never satisfied with seeing or the ear with hearing there's always going to be a little bit more that the body desires and craves and there's things that are related to this age desires that we pursue and say well is it going to stop there is it enough that Miss won a national championship no it's not enough let's just be honest right we want more and I'm talking about in a family where our favorite baseball team won the World Series right first time ever in franchise history and you think you know what shut it down let's go home we're finished right we've climbed to the top of the mountain we planted our flag we're World Series champions as a family we can just coast and go forward in life not worrying about sports but the next thing you know it's like yeah but you know what Michigan plays Ohio State right all of a sudden the stakes have never been higher but it's the things that work within our conscience and our hearts and our fleshly desires and we find that there's more than just one thing desired and nothing in this life ever satisfies because I promise you the Lombardi trophy will only be a gateway to the Stanley Cup right you think Detroit's going to go crazy if Detroit wins if if the red wings are still in it right there's going to be more octopus thrown under the ice right it might actually become hockey town again because you it never stops when our desires are on so many different things so Jesus says lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth but he says in verse 20 but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven and he says where moth nor rust doth corrupt where thieves do not break through nor to steal he takes it as the opposite of those things that are merely Earthly and I believe he's doing this deliberately he wants us to think of uh things that moth can eat and rust can corrupt and thieves can steal to where it's related to an Earthly realm that's subject to Earthly elements and Earthly desires and Earthly temperaments and changes he says but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven for now I'm I'm looking beyond the flesh I'm looking Beyond natural desires and and I'm not just merely Earthly but now I'm thinking of things that are more eternal in Luke 12:33 says sell all sell that you have and give alms this phrasing is just so awesome provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no Thief approaches neither moth corrupted this is the the wording in Luke chapter 12 sell that you have give arms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no Thief approacheth nor moth corrup it's a this is a challenge to them in that moment to have a shift in values amen that well we're worried about what we're going to eat we're worried about what we're going to wear we're worried about what we're going to drink we're worried about whether or not we're going to win the game we're worried about whether or not economics are going to go this way we're worried about who's going to have the nomination we're worried about this worried about that and I said shouldn't you be worried about something else should is isn't there something greater than all this that ought to put everything else in perspective says in Luke 12:3 and one of the company said unto him this is kind of how he's arriving at this very compliment Master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me and he said unto him man who made me a judge or divider over you and he said unto them because here's this fixation on am I going to get my inheritance am I going to is it going to be left to me is my sister going to get it is it my brother going to get it who's going to get this who's going to that help resolve these natural things he says take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of things which he possesses and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits now he he had certain uh silos or or barns or Grainer to where he would store his Harvest and it was adequate for all prior Harvest and it would meet his needs and it was sufficient as a a businessman he knew that if I could store this it's going to bring me the the means that I need I'm going to be a the barter I'm be to live off of it this is good but then he he has the land does exceptionally well beyond what he had done before and he realizes once I harvest all this I'm not going to be able to fit it all in the barns that I have built and he said this will I do I'll pull down my Barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods and I will say to my soul soul that should have told us something's off this guy Soul speaks to himself Soul thou Hast much Goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be married and we might think this is a guy who's being prudent he he's putting things together for his retirement he's watching out for his future but there was something wrong about his desires because God then rebukes him saying thou fool this night thy Soul shall be required of thee then who shall these those things be which thou has provided so is he that layeth up Treasures for himself and is not rich toward God recognize what Jesus is talking about lay up not for yourselves Treasures upon Earth it's the hoarding of values the accumulation of wealth and assets a a and the the idea I recognized it for myself that even for years there was the you know I wanted to have if I wanted to have a charger in my room and I wanted that one to stay there because I want to be able to charge my phone in my room and so I wanted to have one for when I traveled and so if I traveled and I wanted to have one that I could keep stationary where I was traveling if I stayed in a in a barn or staying in a a hotel I wanted to have a charger there and then I needed one for the car just in case and so it's not just good enough to have one charging cable and a charging Breck you needed to have at least three and then you know you need some backups right right redundancy isn't that you know the great thing we need today is redundancy and so there's this thing where you just you have so many different cables and then you just you have one device that uses this one you have another one that uses that one and you have you have three different kind of cables so you have three three three kind of sounds scriptural all of a sudden and you've got all these different cables everywhere and you realize man I this is never going to end because we need I need to have this one I have that one and you're never satisfied with just the one and being wise with that one and and teaching yourself to remember and if you're going to have the one you use that you travel with it you don't forget it and you know what really at the end of the day if you forget it how much does it cost anymore I think you can get it for 50 cents down that aisle of compulsion right but there's just this accumulation this hoarding of things and this man who had enough as he always had when he got more instead of saying you know what I have more to give now and be rich towards God instead of just towards myself instead of recognizing man I've been blessed I want to hoard this and I want to I want to be stingy with this and I'm going to keep this oh what a windfall and I'm going to use it to myself and tear down perfectly good barns build bigger ones just so he can say soul we've done really good we can just relax and feed off of what we have here I I've made enough to where I can just coast and instead of saying you know what why don't I take my excess and give to the house of the Lord why don't I give it says nothing of even his tithing here why don't I give be rich towards the Lord be rich towards God Jesus said give and it shall be given unto you and he uses this phrase in Luke chapter 6 good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom with the same measure that you met with all it shall be measured to you again know words God is inviting us to give with the promise that if we give and are rich towards God and we give for his sake there's a reward in that giving and then the reward even for this man if if we even took that principle he says man my land is given plentifully beyond what I've ever received before and he was to give whatever measure he gave he's going to get that and more right CU God says your reward is pressed down shaken together running over in other words you're not going to be cheated it's not going to kind of be put in there in such a way to where why we just kind of shift this around and make it look like it's full do you know what the whole purpose behind an ice cream scoop is for you ever thought about it and one person knows someone likes ice cream you take a true ice cream scoop it rolls the ice cream up in such a way where it makes it look a little bit Fuller and it's going to fill up a cup a lot faster than if you just used a regular sco spoon and chunked it out there's a tip Jack don't use the ice cream scoop you'll get more ice cream in your bowl but the scoop is there for the purpose of creating this illusion that I've got a whole cup but really it's just rolled together there's enough space and distance it's not very dense and so this is what Jesus is referring to that you're going to get back but it's not going to be scooped out in such a way to where you realize like some cups or glasses get narrower and narrower and you think oh man this is there's a lot in this but it's really really thick glass it has a false bottom in it you ever bought like a bucket of popcorn you're like man I'm be eating on this for days and there's a false bottom like that leaves this much out of it you jam your figure digging into it because it's an illusion but he says God is going to give back pressed down shaken together running over to where he's not going to cheat you amen if they're rich towards God we give in other words I can say give to the measure that you desire to receive from God that's and sometimes we complain about what we're getting back from God when we're not even bothering to give to him we ought to use this principle you saying here give alms give that which is beyond exactly what Jesus saying give alms as he's relating there to ma Matthew chapter 6 give arms provide yourselves bags which wax not old it's quite a statement but he says give beyond that which is what what you need and what's for your own support this man knew he had good land he knew that he could do he could work hard and get another Harvest and maybe if he worked hard he could get another harvest the equal to that one maybe build another barn in the offseason give what he has but instead he tore good ones down hoarded it all to himself and Jesus says give alms if you have well and we know that we're taught that we ought to give I like how One Pastor put it he's passed away but he says when God asked for our 10% that's what he requires you haven't even started giving until you get beyond the 10% I thought well that's interesting hey because that's his that's what he asked back you haven't even started to give until you've given back his but well that's kind of good maybe you'll use it I don't know but I like to look at it as it's all gods he just ask for 10% back and it's our duty to give we have a duty to to be rich towards God to not just lay up Treasures for ourselves to not be worried about our retirement to not be worried about these other extra things but can I reduce my desires to one and be obedient to the things that God has asked us to do knowing that he's promised that he'll provide for us Proverbs says he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord and that which he hath given will he pay him again do you recognize what the Bible is telling us so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich towards God if we do what we ought to do in giving back to God whether it be through our tithes our offerings and our missions which are all three separate things which we should know that that our tithing goes to the ministry it's to the pastor our offerings are separate and distinct from that and then missions giving is different from our tithes and our offerings that if we're given in these things we're we're lending unto the Lord and he says that he'll give to us he'll pay us again it's a it's a paradigm sh shift in values provide yourselves bags which whack not old it's the idea that you're just putting money in the bag over and over again and ha Hagi chapter 1 verses 3 and four I just want to I guess I don't know where I'm at in my time I could go by Arizona time and we have in fact not even started but in in Hagi it says quite a remarkable scripture reading if you want to read chapter one maybe more detail I'll just make reference to he says then came the word of the Lord by Hai the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste if you go back and read it the word of the Lord is rebuking Israel for living in fixed permanent dwellings that are sealed say Wayne's coating beadboard right the crown molding is up the new hardw for wood floors are in and it's it's being the amenities are getting better and the Furnishings are getting better and they're they're improving their dwellings and it's not just a place to lay their head now it's getting more fancy to say you dwell in your sealed houses but then the house of the Lord was being wasted and you your your house your living conditions your car your clothes what you eat what you drink and your house is getting better and better but the house of the Lord is in disrepair the things of God are being neglected and and this admonition to the people of Israel and the instructions that's given if you want to go back and read more in Hagi kind of laying out a real practical principle even for us personally things to consider for ourselves because he asked multiple places in chapter one consider your ways you're living in nice houses driving nice cars eating good things wearing nice clothes but what about the things of God Ponder your path your direction the things that take up your time your manner your habit the way that you're going what path are you pursuing what things are you seeking after what has your conduct LED you to what's your priority what are your goals and here God was correcting their passion correcting their one thing desired David said one thing have I desired Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of Lord all the days of my life and haggi says wait you dwell in sealed houses and the house of God lies in waste he was correcting their Vision they were not deliberate in their actions they were not considering God in them living with the wrong priorities and goals and he says you dwell in sealed houses Jesus says provide yourselves bags which wax not old this is a kind of a if I could say this this is what they're doing is a sealed house I guess in my mind maybe sometimes you you you maybe visit a house maybe you're looking for a house whether you're renting or buying and a house is listed maybe just looking at the pictures or or you visit and you go into the shag carpet in the master B bathroom and and you're horrified right initi you're just kind of horrified like what what were they thinking but you know at one time somebody thought that was an upgrade there was a there's some houses you walk into and you see all the the panel board and you see certain things and lolium and you know there and you're like you're horrified but at one time that was the right like honey I got lolium look at the new wallpaper we got look at this nice wood paneling that we got on the walls I got shag carpet in the master bathroom and this they going oh wow isn't this great give us some time it's outdated it's not fashionable and this G exactly what Jesus is saying bags with W not old this in other words he's referring to money that's hoarded in bags that eventually the bags the you're just hoarding it the bags rot through and the money in there's a value and but the bag you're putting it just rots through it gets out there's holes in it so Hagi comes to the same thing in verse six ye sow much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink now remember he rebuked them they have sealed houses but the house of God lays in waste he's making a direct connection to where where they spent their time and their money what their desires and how it reflecting the fact that they're never actually satisfied they sew a lot but they bring in little they have they they eat but they don't have enough they drink but they're not F drink you clothe but there's none warm notice how much it answers to Matthew 6 yes but there's none warm and he that earnthenecklace we could spend more time in this but the lesson is don't prefer convenience and temporal enjoyment over God's will they would get their money and they would save it they'd be they'd Pat the bag glad to know that they had the money they lived in sealed houses but they were preferring just the convenience and Temple enjoyments over doing God's work if they were to have real Comfort real enjoyment they were going to sew and reap if they were going to have enough if they were going to drink and be filled if they were going to be clothed and be warm then they had to put God first otherwise anything we try to gain is just like putting money in a bag with holes not going to use it or in the end we're just going to come up empty you SE much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough he that earnthenecklace but Jesus says verse 21 as we come back to Matthew chapter 6 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also your heart will follow after those things that you value that just that should just cause pause right now the reason why I pursue these things is because in my heart I value it I I I I think that there's some importance to it I know that it if impacts me it affects me whatever you make your treasure gains possession possession of your heart it takes control verse 24 no man can serve two masters for either will hate the one and love the other realse he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon am what a remarkable uh eye openening scripture it's not that you can't have if and not to make the argument but it's not saying you can't have two masters you just can't serve them both at the same time one has to have the pr priority you can't serve God and Mammon now you could have that duplicity in your heart where yes you desire the things of God but you're a slave to all these other desires but you realize you can't fulfill these desires and be serving God that you have to choose the one that's going to be the greatest you have to choose the one that's going to rule and we sometimes we think oh well if I choose to serve God I can't eat anymore and I can't drink anymore and I can't be clothed no God knows you have need of those things God knows there's a bit benefit in certain Recreation God knows that there's things in life that we can enjoy as an individual this message teaches us that God knew that somewh like mountains that some would like the ocean some would like this and some would like that and so he made this life full of things that we can enjoy that aren't necessarily really high Supernatural spiritual things and so your heavenly father knows that you have base instincts that you have desires even if it be to be entertained or to recreate or get away and relax God knows but what he wants you to have is one desire and if you have one desire he'll look after all these other things and it's through that that other hobbies and Recreations even if we do indulge in and the pursuit of of golfing or we like to enjoy this hobby or whether it be fishing or even enjoying sports that it has its place but it's not the one thing amen and we realize it's not a master in Colossians chapter 3: 1 and two if you be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of of God set your affections on things above not on things on earth direct your heart to Christ means to seek to strive for to be purposed in your heart seek those things which are above because where your treasure is there will your heart be also what what was that the culmination to lay up not for yourselves Treasures on Earth because if you if you hoard Treasures on Earth that makes your heart Earthbound if it's all what you're going to eat what you're going to drink what you're going to be clothed with what your house if your house be house becomes your true desire I I if your house becomes the dominant thing the thing that's the most important that's where your heart's going to be it's downward right a tornado an earthquake the housing market right crazy things can happen but he says if you're storing Treasures in Heaven your heart begins to look upward like that's that's where it's at I even if you think about it if if there was if there was something going to happen and you heard the some economies were going to fail or there you know there was going to be something come in and uh you think you see your front door open when you get home from church today and you're thinking someone's been in our house you run to that one place where you know you got the valuables right and you check is my Nintendo switch still there right that's what you want to know you want to know is the gaming system still there is my laptop still there why you run to the thing that's valuable because that that's that's what you you recognize there's some value in but wouldn't it be great if you just knew that you had something secure in heaven that no matter what happened here like you get home and you're like thank God what I have can't be taken away from me and and the lord giveth and the lord taketh away when it comes to all these other things but man I've got something greater Hallelujah I've got something greater than all that because you've set your affections on things above amen I call High Ambitions brother the sermon thinking on our way he came across a floater is what he called them and he ran into this floater he had started to have a conversation with him took them to lunch I believe and he said where did you start this this is floating we might call him a bum or some kind of uh just a traveling man he said where did you start this the man said about 20 years ago he's asked where are you going nowhere where did you come from nowhere how long you expect to keep this up oh I don't know and he said no Ambitions he says why the Christian ought to be the most ambitious person in the world we ought to be the most ambitious people in the world and he says bring this glorious Gospel of eternal life to a dying and perishing world we should be up and at it not given to chance desires I feel the weight of chance desires I feel this impulse this compulsion of things let's be honest with ourselves we give in we make mistakes we pursue desires we do things that we know know a son or daughter of God should not do we get caught up in the fanaticism of certain things we maybe get our emotions stirred up and we get excitable about certain things and whether it be certain ideals or or theories or certain things we pursue it we get behind it we support it whatever it might be but that's just one way of spreading us thin it's one way of getting robbing us of our energy and our our our passion he says we should be ambitious we shouldn't desire to be play uh uh uh complacent and no energy no ambition like well I guess I just can't wait till church Sunday I ain't got anything else to do he says we should be ambitious we should be up and at it sermon as the eagle stir her nest that's the way God builds his church for his eaglets high above the Ambitions of this world she's got a high ambition not to please men but to please God she's built high and safe this is where Safety and Security is is in laying up Treasures in Heaven what does it mean being riched towards God one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after still here in Matthew chap 6: 22 to 23 I'm just about to the end here those running the slideshow are probably already just counting how many slides left to know doing the math they can do the analytics wow we've gone through 50 slides so far he's been about an hour so far got this much to go they already know just how long I'm going to be all you have to do is ask AI right just just ask chat GPT how much longer does he have to preach he'll give you an answer may not be right Matthew chapter 6: 22 and 23 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if the eye be evil the evil eye is one that's chaotic it's disordered it's it's an eye that can't focus it's an eye that's not set on a single correct objective it can't focus on the object it's a one in eye it's caught it it it can't bring into Focus that's what he's saying here if an eye be single the whole body is full of light notice the benefit to the whole body but if the eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in the be Darkness you perceive it to be light but in fact it's not how great is that Darkness a single eye Proverbs chapter 25 23: 5 and 6 wil thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves Wings they fly away as an eagle toward Heaven eat not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meats that evil eye it's always changing always shifting yes this evil eye if I could put it this way it's that person it's that inclination that desire to where you found it right I found it this is going to solve all your financial problems right if you can just give me give me 500 bucks and start selling everybody else get them to give you 500 bucks and what it's an ideal it's an idea this is the pro it's going to problem it's going to take away all your pain it's going to remedy this and usually they just cycle right into another one yeah true right because there's always something new there's always a new fat there's always something something new that comes along he said there's there this evil eye it isn't focused on the correct objective it always gets its attention on something else true amen so set thine eyes on that which is not why because riches will just fly away but a an evil eye is chaotic it's disorderly it can't Focus but a single eye is simple it's clear I can't do it with my eyes but it's not eyes is looking two different ways the ey is not looking at this and looking at that you know trying to serve two masters but it's that Simplicity of mind the singleness of purpose it's an eye that's able to simplify and reduce desires to one Proverbs 4:25 to 27 let thine eyes look right on let thine eyelids look straight before thee Ponder the feet of thy path and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from Evil let her eyes look straight on this is what David was saying all other things I even have enemies that would want to destroy me a host is surrounding me I've got all these problems these cha this chaos coming but he wasn't focused on all those things he wasn't trying to do the math well if I put an army here if I do this if I do that there was one thing he desired above all that there was one hope and consolation he had of all that let thine eyes look right on let thine eyelids look straight before thee think about your feet let your ways be established let thine eye be single so your body can be full of light that's the strength of character because you have a singular purpose this is something that a lot of people recognize even in the natural world they're not necessarily putting God first but they sold out to one thing and because they made that their goal they're successful in it amen it's a principle that works because it's a strength of character when we're able to simplify ourselves to a singular simple purpose if your heart's divided between Heaven and Earth your body is entirely dark the light of the body is the eye of the ey be single the whole body is full of light but if the heart is divided between Heaven and Earth it's entirely dark because our desire determines our character just wrapping up here just closing our desire determines our character as I as I close I'm asking is it simple is it one thing desired I know that it's good it's good to be ambitious brother B said we've got high ambition we should be up and at it in our family on Christmas every year and sometimes if it's not Christmas it's New Year's Eve we take out a little prayer book each one of us have our own and in it we write down our prayers for the next year and it's an opportunity to reflect on what we asked a year before and see whether or not it's come to pass and as we write these desires out it's we're not just writing one thing sometimes it's page after page several things that are being written down it's multiple things and so it's not that you say well what do you want it's like well you know nothing really just just the Lord I guess since that's what we're supposed to do you know one you know one thing desired you heard the preacher and it's kind of like I don't that's not that's not it but it's when you recognize that really at the end of the day the things all these different things that I want can be summarized by one thing I want to please the Lord I want I want I want the Lord I want to do right I want to do good I want to have it's singular there may be a lot of ways it looks there may be a lot of ways that it plays out in my life a lot of things I end up doing things I per and I find myself wanting to do this and this and this there's ways that I can help in the church there's ways that I can help the Believers there's all sorts of different things that I can do in missions work and there's things I could do overseas there's a lot I can do but when it all comes down to it what is it it's one thing I desired yes it all has to do with Christ Luke 11:36 If thy whole body therefore is full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light when we can reduce our desires to one that's going to illuminate the right path it's not a a dull life it's not a bored life it's not a life or it's just a kind of like a monastery the monks who just try to deprive themselves of everything else sensory they refuse to speak and they dress in uncomfortable clothes and they just try to make their lives uncomfortable so they can have the pretense that they're seeking God but to be able to say one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after musicians if you'd like to come to your instruments I want to close with this scripture but as we come to this scripture Jesus is saying that if you can have that singular eye there's a light that begins to shine that's where the true Joy is when there's one thing desired life should be the process of assessing things learning things by experience by wisdom by discernment by teaching by instruction learning to determine True Value and simplifying on the basis of it businesses do this often they find processes that are uh uh that are not uh producing good within their within their work environment there's things that are done that are duplicative or there's things that actually don't bring add any real value and they streamline they get those things out and they they get rid of all the excess and they and in doing so they make themselves healthier and more productive I say that that's just a that's just a cheap type of what God wants us to do in our own personal lives is recognize the excess recognize the baggage the weight the things that we do that aren't productive it's exactly what Paul says he says all things are lawful but they're not all expedient yes you can do this yes that's okay but there's a lot of processes a lot of desires a lot of things that we pursue a lot of extra things are being really spread thin but can we simplify based upon value David says in 1 Chronicles 29:3 my last scripture here says moreover because I have set my affection to the house House of my God I have of my own proper good of gold and silver which I've given to the house of my God over and above all that I've prepared for the holy house I know it's maybe worded in a unique way it's just the translation The King's English as we might say because I've set my affection to the house of my God because I have said and professed one thing have I desire of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life Amen to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple he says because that was my desire I have of my own my gold and my silver I've given over and above all that I've prepared prepared for the Holy House other words David's desire wasn't shallow it was real he put his money where his mouth was he put his actions where his mouth was one thing have I desired that will I seek after you could actually look in the Curious language as David is saying it there wasn't even a temple there was a tabernacle and what did David say he just wasn't saying you know I guess if there was a temple I'd want to be there but he put it his actions he wanted to build that place Amen in other words if it wasn't there and it was what he wanted he was going to do everything he could to make sure he had it what a challenge to us maybe we're just sitting around just waiting you know brother John's Got The midest Touch everything he touches turns to gold old and if we want it a certain way we'll just wait for Brother John to do it he'll get it where it needs to be and we want things to be a certain way or we want certain opportunities and if you really desired it maybe you would do as David did because I set my affection to the house of my God I have of my own proper good of gold and silver which I've given to the house Lord over and above all that I prepared for the Holy House in other words more than what was AC acquired elsewhere I've given even of myself I've done it because this is what I desired if I could do this and close on in where we were in that text if the Lord is indeed your light the Lord is indeed your salvation then this one thing will be desired then the Lord will be the one thing that is needful it'll be the highest aim the highest desire of your heart the Lord is my light and my salvation because that I don't have any fear I don't have anything to be afraid of and therefore he is what I desire because truly he is my light when things are dark that's who I reach for when I'm afraid and things come up against me that's who I Look to because I really mean it it's in my heart if I could put it this way no one who truly sees the beauty of the Lord will have his heart captured by anything else and so David David wasn't just satisfied in talking about it looking at a tabernacle of the Wilderness a tent and saying yeah one thing I desired I'd want to I'd want there to be a house that I could go to to it'd be like praying all these years that send the light would get their own church building right well if they just had their own church building maybe I'd visit I don't want I don't like fighting with all the used cars in the parking lot right and then and then you get it and don't show up anymore maybe I should be looking at the camera which one which one's live right just I'm just just being real but the idea that one thing I've desired and it wasn't even in one sense it didn't even exist but David said I'm going to do everything I can because I want to see that I want to see that house built am you know maybe I'm looking at it just a little bit different angle there but once you see the beauty of the Lord that's why we should seek it rarely rarely if I could say no one who sees the be of the Lord will have his heart captivated by any other so that's what we should seek for one thing desired could we stand together today and just like to say a prayer for you as we turn it over to your pastor one thing maybe this is something maybe this is something these young young men could think about one thing desired these young ladies these young people I have my own family here I see this these young people here today so many things to desire so many things to pursue so many things to consider what am I going to where am I going to go to college what am I going to pursue what kind of car am I going to own what what all these different things so much to think about but can we really honestly say in our hearts that when it all comes down to it I want to win Christ I want to gain him with our heads bowed let's pray maybe you could just pray today Lord help me to understand let help me to Value the right things where this thought uh came to me in my my life is I began to think last year about what God values and in thinking about what he values and how that we can identify the things that God values in scripture and God speaks a language to us makes decisions and teaches certain things to the scripture to where it's telling us things about his heart and things he values and for me I was thinking I if I could find what God values that's instructive to me about what I ought to value and I know that life's hard difficult it's not just a matter of what we eat and what we drink and what we're going to [Applause] wear and being really strict with that language those three things just refer to life and all that it demands and all that it entails and I do believe that we can seek first the kingdom of God one thing desired Above All Else we need the Lord's help in determining value so that we can simplify our desires and our aims and that's what I would pray for you today if you desire that just maybe lift your hand before the Lord Lord help me to determine True Value and have the grace in my life to simplify on the basis of it our gracious Heavenly Father Lord today as we've shared this this message with the people the close of the first month of the year Lord it is kind of a A good sermon at the start of the year when we're making changes and implement many new processes and having evaluated the past year and looking forward to a new one it's kind of affords us a nice opportunity to reset and Lord I pray that as this newness of the year is still with us we're still may be trying to change habits within our home or become more diligent with respect to personal things may we examine ourselves as the prophet said in Hagi consider your ways says it once says it again in that first chapter times consider your ways the proverb saying Ponder the feet of the your path consider what way your feet are going today Lord we've had ample opportunity while the word was preached to consider our ways to determine whether or not we've established a comfort on Earth through natural things and essentially just storing up Treasures on Earth that our heart is attached to and we've forsaken the house of the Lord which embodies another kingdom with speaks of your habitation what you value and orients us to the Heavenly and not the Earthly I pray that you help us throughout our lives to be able to determine value to be able to rightly as we grow Lord I don't expect some of these young boys here and 12 years old to be able to look at every situation and know what counts and what matters so I pray that you be with the parents who are teaching them training them raising them up in a way that's going to instill in them in integrity and hopefully give them the kind of experiences that build their character so that as they grow and they mature they begin to look at situations and they can determine things of True Value and simplify life on the basis of it what a great lesson we can all learn Lord if we were able to find you in Simplicity and get away from all the minutia and the all the the just the Surplus in the world today and just find you Lord help us I pray may you be with us strengthen our hearts and encourage us bless us I pray as we commit the people to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's sing this song together more of you that line I've had it all but what I need oh more of you more of you I've had it all but what I need is just more of you of things I've had my f and yet I hunger still empty and bare Lord hear my prayer for more of you oh it sounds like what David was saying oh more of
