okay she was either here our immune system could beat it or she was going to basically die like too bad imagine and uh the mom called my buddy while we were driving and she's just gone and this is his ex and he's looking at me like nice basically and I just said do you believe in God yeah and I said stop speaking of it and I just kind of review what the doctor said and the Lord just filled my mouth and I started speaking scripture and truth and I said you know that the sickness is just the name and I know that I know someone who is prettier than any sickness and I spoke these things the next morning and I were going hunting and the model called them and they called him back because he was trying to find out how his daughter was and she said she still has a very low grade fever she only coughed a little bit this morning but she's doing great um one of the testimonies when I was on the phone with her I told her I said you know they're giving her these vitamins and rotate motor when I got off the phone Eddie was looking like a deer in the headlights because the mountain said okay to me and he goes well how did you do that and I said what do you mean it was she will not allow anyone who work Court battle right now right now me and my wife gave her a Tylenol a military She is totally against it and she just agreed with you with you and is doing it but she got him and you know as of today she's even doing better but she literally she's on her deathbed two nights ago two days ago and she's my whatever he and I was like as of this morning just a lemon low grade like 98. very low grade barely coffin anymore and for a doctor to say you know this is really touching though like there's nothing else we can do for her immune system's either going to fight it or not the other thing I wanted to mention um is I really want to encourage everyone to listen to the teams there's power in the case but it's hunting season and you know I reflected on a message that president spoke about um it was sitting on a log he was in an area where there wasn't a certain type of squirrel and so on and so forth and basically the ward said well just you know believe that it's going to come up on that log basically and it'll be there and not even told them that the the number the will this the number that he wanted for the you know the meal that night or whatever it would be well yesterday the night before game or one of the kids said dad we'll help you get a deer tomorrow and I said I'm gonna get two and I just said it I knew it and I felt like God said it well yeah we both got it here we

with our message his battle your faith God just wants us to believe amen turn with me if you would to first Samuel we're going to kind of have a little a Bible study tonight amen amen first Samuel chapter 17. and we've all been in this chapter before about David and Goliath and we're just going to read just two verses here verses 21 and 47. have a word of prayer and then have you be seated chapter 17 starting with verse number 21. for Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in a ray Army against Army now notice who put the battle in Array Israel and the Philistines Army against Army verse 47 and all hit and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with the sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands amen let's bow in the word of our heavenly father Lord we want to thank you for the opportunity to be in your house today Father we thank you that you've given us strength sound mind and Lord that all that you've provided a vehicle just all the means to be here and we just thank you for this Grace Lord we pray Lord that you would be with those less fortunate than us today wherever they're at Lord whatever would be ailing them afflicting them holding them back whatever the the need would be we just pray that the Holy Spirit would be with them today Lord be with him in this hour and those that are watching into the live stream I just pray that you come into their cars or their living rooms or bedrooms wherever they would be visit them Lord and just encourage them to tonight's message Father we commit the service into your hands we just pray that you strengthen us now we love you we thank you for these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated amen well one thing I want to do I got some things written down because I usually forget so many things if I don't write them down but I want to thank each and every one of you who had given me birthday wishes today uh I turned 31 years old as brother Brennan would say for the second time so thank you for making my day as blessed as it was and also I wanted to think publicly and express a gratitude to all those who showed their appreciation uh to me last month I know I told each one individually but just publicly it I wanted to say thank you may God bless you pray for me that I could do a better job for you that's my sincere prayer as a pastor uh brother Timothy Sean surgery went well and um he appreciates everyone's prayers for him and so as he's recovering we still want to hold him up in prayer uh brother Jason Demars had got home last night from Turkey um he wanted to say thank you for all of your prayers as well and uh just to kind of give you an idea that the circumstances in Turkey are very difficult they're very very hard and trying to work behind the scenes to make things uh flow he needs our prayers for wisdom and Leadership of the Lord because it is not an easy work so if we could just remember remember him in prayer another announcement is there will be no service next Wednesday no service next Wednesday because of Thanksgiving on Thursday um and if anybody on the live stream would like to hear Brother Jonathan's testimony I think we're going to have to you're going to have to hear directly from him because I don't think it made it through to the uh the live streams I think maybe we just give who's ever given testimonies we've got to get them a microphone just give them a microphone and uh you know who if if they don't get it grab them one and uh because I I there's a good good I'm sure a good testimony and I want everybody to hear that so they're gonna have to hear it from him personally amen well we uh we want to just talk about where we need to be in the midst of of our battles anybody ever been in a battle before I think it's ironic in our opening scripture here that uh the Bible says that Israel in the Philistines had put the battle in a ray but God says no the battle is his and um I think it's a way that we we we look at it if we could just do some a Bible reading here I would like to start with verse number 32 of first Samuel chapter 17. and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight this Philistine so here we are I want us to think about all the battles that we go through the the hardships the things that we wish were in our life or something we're trying to overcome something we're trying to get delivered of something that is a battle to us and um oh we are are looking for something to have this not in our life to have this battle not here the battle is there because God had allowed it to be there just like this battle with David and Goliath well really it was against ills Israel uh in in the Philistines but God wanted to get Glory through the situation and I believe every battle that we have God wants to give get Glory through the battle we just got to see God uh is in it and not run away from it but to to be the one that says we will go fight this Philistine fight this battle now now I want you to understand the battle is the Lord's he wants us to fight the good fight of faith and and if you can catch that you've got the message tonight and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight how many times has as the devil told us that right with him for thou art but a youth and he's a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smold him and delivered and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I called him by the beard and smold him and slew him so here we are he is giving testimonies of how God has used his faith in the past because that's what we got to think about when we're in a battle it's a not how big the battle is not how big the problem is but how much God has used Us in the past because that will actually activate our faith so he's he's given testimony amen thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and the uncircum and this uncircumcised philosin shall be as one of them see God's gonna come forth in this situation as well seeing here defied the armies of the Living God this is what you got to think about that when you're going through massive trials that you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you belong to God and the devil has no right amen you gotta you gotta take a stand you gotta testify David said moreover the Paul of the lion uh the Lord that delivered me out of the Paul of the lion and out of the Paul of the bear he would deliver me out of the hand of the philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee and Saul arm David with his armor and he put a helmet a brass upon his head and armed him with a coat of mail and David girded his sword upon his armor and he aside to go and he had not proven it for he had not proven it and David said unto Saul I cannot go with these for I have not proven them and David put them off of him now of course we've heard this story so many times and these types so many times but so often when we go to deal with a problem we come with our own reasoning our own understanding our own thoughts our our own abilities our own trust in in our self or another man another man's idea and and they're not proven what's proven is what God speaks that's proven and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five stones out of the brook and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine I want you to understand that nothing was said from Kings from Saul to go get stones there was nothing there given to David to go get these Stones outside of God faith comes from God confidence in in defeating the giant inner life comes from God it doesn't come from man it doesn't come from man's ideas or this is what I think we should do it has nothing to do with that we've got to hear from God Alone and the Philistine came and Drew near unto David and the man that bear The Shield went before him and when the Philistine looked about and saw David he disdained him oh my for he was but a youth in Ruddy and fair and about Fair countenance and the Philistines said unto David and I a dog that thou cometh to me with staves and the Philistine cursed David by his God do you ever have anybody curse you come on you can see that is of the devil and the Philistine said to David come to me uh said to said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the Beast of the field now this is Satan trying to tell you that you are going to be devoured through this trial it's exactly what's happening then said David to the Philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou has defiled I want you to think about this when Satan is tormenting you he's tormenting God's possession you're not just a nobody you're not just you're not just something that you feel when you're going through a trial which is hardly nothing but your God's chosen you're his bride and so when the Devil comes to you lying to you you've got to you've got to you got to stand like David stood knowing that the devil is defying what God has has given you has promised you and and who you are said this day well I will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee and I will give thee uh give the carcass of holes to the Philistine this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth and all the Earth that all the Earth may know that there's a God in Israel not what I love about this is is that God is showing us what David's motive was he wasn't trying to get Glory he wasn't trying to show off he was he was really wanting everyone to see the glory of God and that that was his mold of and and that must remain our motive that God receives Glory because this is the whole reason that God allowed this situation to take place this is why God allowed the the the the the the uh uh the armies of Egypt to come after the children of Israel is because God wanted to get glory in the situation and yes there was a battle then and there's a battle here and there is a battle in our life but God wants to get Glory out of it and if he don't get Glory out of it I don't I I don't feel that he's going to be favorable about the outcome or how we're going about doing it he wants all the glory he don't want any Glory going to ourselves none of it he doesn't want to share Glory with any flesh amen he wants us to go wow wow God you're amazing God you're amazing um verse 47 and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with things that you see naturally sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands wow I just think this is this is so humble and so amazing that that David was David could put himself in the place of being used by God but at the same time it wasn't him it was God's battle it was God's battle and it was David's faith too often we're succumbed by the battle we feel that we're in a battle we're in a battle we need to start testifying this is the Lord's battle this is the Lord's battle you want to claim something claim faith in God claim faith in God that he's going to take you through God has always want to to show his abilities and His glory come on all right there's another story it's in second Chronicles chapter 20. Second Chronicles chapter 20. we're just laying a foundation a Bible study Foundation I want to start with verse number one and it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other beside the amorites came against Jehoshaphat to battle so I want you to picture all these problems coming into your life all these Spirits all these people coming against you Then There came some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea on this side of Syria and behold they be in hazards on Tamar which is and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and proclaim a fast throughout you to now I want you to look at the attitude that Jehoshaphat brother Brandon says that's not the action that happens to you but how you react this is so mightily important of course he feared the situation he came upon him this great problem Came Upon him but he set himself to seek the Lord that's the a number one thing to do and and just proclaim a fast it's okay your family if you've got a close brother and sister you know willing to uh you have confidence in them they'll fast with you and Judah gathered themselves together to as help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and said oh now look at to the way he's talking to him oh Lord God of our fathers art now art not thou God in heaven and ruleth not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathens and thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand you are not art not thou Our God who did his drive out the inhabitants of the land before thy People Israel and gave us it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever oh he is he is really entering in with great sincerity great um seriousness his whole heart is here God I'm being open and honest with you and thou dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary then for thy name same if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment pestilence and famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our Affliction then thou will hear and help too often we're not willing to do that God knows God knows he must want me I think God wants us to cry out we want God to help but we don't want to cry out and it's part of the relationship that we have with God he we got to do our part it's part of being humble and I need you can you imagine if you're you're you as a father and you as a mother if your children never said to you I need you if they never cried out and said I need help you wouldn't feel that important part of being a parent with them right God don't want us murmuring complaining about our problems he one is crying out to him and saying God I need you it's the attitude that we have in in the relationship and now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and and mount sear whom thou what is not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold I say how they reward us to come and cast us out of thy possession which thou has given us to inherit o Our God will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do we don't even know what to do in this situation for our eyes for but our eyes are upon thee we can either look at the problem or we can keep our eyes on the solution to know where our help comes from all Judas stood before the Lord with their little ones oh isn't this beautiful families their wives and their children then upon J Hazel the son of Zechariah the son of benil B in Naya the levite I'm sorry the son of Jewell jehu the son of matina a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation see what happens God will finally come if you do your part to get on your face get before the Lord and just bring forth your strong reasons show forth your just cause ex Express to God your whole being God will come in your midst and speak to you and he said how can he all Judah any happiness of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by the reason of this great problem in your life for the battle is not yours but God's it sure seems like it's my problem they're coming after me they want to destroy me sure sounds like it's my battle doesn't sound like anybody else is going through it you can either testify it's your battle or it's God's tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff now this is still God talking of as is and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jewelry Jew real now it it really sounds like it the battle is still theirs because God is saying to go down against them but he's not saying that ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you don't you think God wants to say the same thing to us does it don't you think he wants us to stand still and and watch him save us in our situation that that there's no need to fight the battle that really The Battle Belongs to the Lord oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head and his face to the ground and all Judah and then happens of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of core called carothites and of the children of the core rights stood up to praise the Lord of Israel with a loud voice on high can't be in the dumps and praise the Lord one spirit is going to take over and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness that Tico and I'm sorry that I can't pronounce words real well but you you understand uh the the message that the Lord has given us even though the words aren't perfect and as they went forth Jehovah stood and said Hear Me O Judah and he inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established Believers prophets so shall you prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord and that should be and that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever and when they began to sing into praise the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon and Moab and the mount Syria which were come down against Judah and they were smitten what a message for us we just heard last service that we we need to give the God give God the respect that he deserves by coming into his presence with worship and praise and thanksgiving and now God would not destroy or Smite the this problem that they had until they began to worship until they began to sing praises before the Lord that was the requirement before the battle would be won I just I love the Simplicity that all we got to do is trust God believe in God that he will take care of our problems we want we want other people to take care of our problems we just do we do we want people to take care of them we look for natural answers but but God wants us to fall on her face to cry out to him to let him be the the one that gets the glory and and just to follow his instructions if he tells you to go do this do that then you do it if he tells you to praise him praise Him worship Him worship Him just do what he says you would think this is like crazy I mean you're gonna get killed destroyed you're facing a real battle and you're gonna sit here and go saying do you know what I'm saying you have to look at this in a way that you truly believe that God is going to deliver you and worship him and and mean it from the depths of your heart because that is the requirement for God to move in our behalf they didn't have to fight the battle God said the battle was not theirs so is the problem that you have in yours or is it God's I just want to hear your testimony he said You shall not need to fight in this battle set yourself stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you so we can either testify of that or we can get bothered and do all the fighting what does God do he tells him to go down against them the next day tells them where they're going to be where they're going to come as almost that they're going down to flight but he wasn't he was going down so they could see the salvation of the Lord that's why he sent him down there so they could see with their eyes that God was going to destroy them their job was to just believe that God was going to do what he said that the word of God is true and King Jehoshaphat said believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established Believe In His prophets so shall you prosper now we don't want to pick and choose I know one thing from my life I want to believe the things that I'm not believing for everybody because that's what God's looking for in my life he's not looking to Pat me on the bat for what I am believing for he's looking for me to have faith to believe what I'm not believing for him there wasn't room for adults and fears negative thoughts imaginations there's only room to believe just think about without faith it's impossible I'll make God happy when you go out against your problem tomorrow you have a choice to make either believe that this is your private battle or this is the Lord's battle well brother John you don't understand I caused it it doesn't matter either Lord's on your side or he's not right you have a choice either you're going to fight the battle or you're going to fight to believe that God is going to see you through what you're going to be fighting with either believe that you're on your own or you're going to believe that the Lord is with you you may this may sound strange but I'm telling you your attitude makes all the difference in this either believe and trust the Lord or doubt and be dismayed because of the situation is beyond your capability it's okay that our situations are beyond our capability they're not Beyond gods either believe and rejoice and worship and give God respect that he deserves or just mope be that's be dismayed we have choices that we have to make and their spiritual choices to believe is a spiritual choice to doubt is a spiritual choice it's just the wrong spirit they're both Spirits one is right one is wrong God has not given us the spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind you got to separate those two God will only act upon the confession of our faith what we're what we testify what comes out of our mouth and we know this to be true but so often we get caught up in fears and problems that we begin to think things and then say things they slip out before you know it we got a whole attitude about it turn with me to Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1. foreign wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and the high priest of our profession Jesus Christ now that word profession means confession he is the high priest of what comes out of our mouth what comes out of our heart what comes out of our thoughts what we're what we're he can only act according to what we say if we say we're doomed then that's all he can do he can't move Beyond your faith for you and he goes on to explain this here in verse 5 and 6 and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant so his his wife his children he took care of of the circumcision eventually uh but he was faithful in all his house as a servant now this whole reason was for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after and those things are Christ over us but Christ as a son over his own house Who We Are whose house are we if all that little word in there it just kind of throws out their old predestination there doesn't it If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm onto the end Christ will be faithful to us if we're faithful to believe faithful to trust them faithful to remain confident faithful to re to rejoice in the promises of God if we're not faithful with that Christ will not see God there's no promise for Christ to see us through because our confession is that he can if our confession is he will he will he will you just keep rejoicing that he will the problem is you know we're sometimes over here we're sometimes over here we're double-minded we're thinking this we're saying that we're doing this and doubting before you know it becomes such a confusion right and and God is looking for Yea and amen believers yea and amen Believers now here's the problem that we all face when we go through long trials the temptation of our heart of our hearts becoming hard we know how what happens when we hear the truth with hard hearts right every time we come to church the word falls on four types of ground Jesus said he that receiveth the word seed into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word and amen with joy receive it so be it amen yet have he not wrote in himself but doareth for a while for when tribulation and persecution arise because of the word by and by He Is offended he's offended he's offended because the roots aren't deep now this believer is really unwilling to pay the price to get more rooted to get more established to get more in love with God they want to stay shallow you can't do that because you're going to go through long long trials and they're going to get you hard if you're not careful this believer only acts like he's being a Believer for a while and eventually he gets offended it's kind of like uh we've heard that hot water shows what kind what's in the tea bag Jesus said buy and buy he is offended just all sudden kinds of withdrawals a little bit that word offended means stumbles trips up enticed to doubt withdraws his confidence he just comes into church and sits but he withdraws his confidence just kind of sits back and doesn't keep pressing in that's exactly what happens to the believer who's offended and it may happen four or five months ago but it never gets fixed it can happen service is a goal we need to watch our hearts don't let it get hard keep it soft keep it tender be humble be meek we must remain confident that God is going to see us through we need to keep the right attitude always all right Hebrews 3 verse 7 now just dropping down wherefore as the Holy Ghost say it today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation and in the day of Temptation in the wilderness because that was a long trial for them right when your father's tempted me and proved me and saw my Works 40 years so here's a group of people they saw the works of God and they still allowed their hearts to get hardened it wasn't like they were in a church they didn't see the work of God they saw the works of God and yet their hearts got hardened he says wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart for they have not known my ways wow they've seen all the works of God and yet they didn't know his ways because his way is to really trust God no matter what God tells them to do that's the way of the Lord so I swear in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest take heed now he goes right back to this verse six take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God basically walking around without religion walking around with religion without the reality of the closeness of God speaking to your heart just becomes religion that's what it means an evil heart of unbelief it's what it means to depart from the Living God it isn't like I'm leaving church I'm done you know but now look at this now this is our responsibility but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end oh my it ain't he that begins the race it's he that endures to the end and you gotta hold that beginning confidence steadfast and firm to the end so we have a choice to make we must decide that we're not going to draw back we're not going to be dismayed we're not going to just kind of Fill A Seat in church but we're actually going to give God praise as if he's really here amen we've got to keep our confidence going Hebrews 10 verse 35. Hebrews 10 verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for avnita patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise now I wonder what the will of God what God wants you to do we need to be looking for what God wants us to do don't wait for somebody to tell you what you should be doing you need to find out from God what he wants you to do because the Bible says after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not Tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back from living by faith in other words you're living by sight by the natural he says my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of then that draw back unto Perdition to them that walk by sight but of them that believe right to the end to the saving of the Soul I love it love the scriptures choose ye this day whom you will serve and serve them with the rejoicing choose ye this day Who The Battle Belongs to choose this day who it belongs to battle is the Lords but he can only operate his plan of action according to your faith whatever you're going to testify and here's what's important God told Brother Branham to tell the people that their actions that their thoughts speak louder in heaven than their words do on Earth so if we're going to testify that this Belongs to the Lord this battle belongs to the Lord he's going to see us through and I'm trusting in God I'm believing it our thoughts have to be that way as well so we need to put our energy into actually building our faith not fighting the battle fighting the good fight of faith we need to put our energy in getting more faith so we can trust him more so we can actually go through the trial with a trust that will take us through your faith will produce the results through the hand of God in your life it's your faith we already know the power of God can do anything so we don't want to put our energy in our abilities or somebody else's abilities our flesh always wants to take control of a situation it's it's easier just to take control of the situation and handle it than it is to trust the Lord because it takes patience and you know God's working a character in you and uh you know that's you know not what we want to do oftentimes are fighting for control doesn't Veil any good we just fight I'm going to prove and it doesn't Avail anything First Corinthians 9 26 I therefore so run not as uncertainty certainly Soul fight I not is one that beat at the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection to the word lest by any means when I preached to others I myself am not able I'm not able to keep the testimony are you with me we walk by faith not by sight so how's your faith I'm going to ask you a question how how is your faith doing if our faith is weak then why aren't we building it why aren't we exercising it why aren't we getting a hold of the horns of the altar getting more serious getting more humble getting more still before the to set ourselves more desperate Abraham considered not the weakness he considered not his the weakness of the situation the the weakness of him being older the weakness of Sarah but the Bible says he was strong in faith so faith is the thing we need to be building faith is a real substance that comes from God and I believe if we humble ourself to God that God gives more grace to the humble now we learned last Sunday that to respect God enough to enter in his presence with much praise there's something about rejoicing through God's battle that God honors we can take if we had time which we don't but if we took a look at how the walls of Jericho came down they walked around in obedience but it wasn't until they began to praise to blow the trumpets that the walls came down look how Gideon defeated multitudes with just 300 people because he was willing to to to to to to to to give to to follow the word basically God told him what to do he did it and they worshiped they praised and that's what we got to do in our situation either We Believe enough to rejoice in it or we don't rejoicing through God's battle is an expression of our faith to God it's more of a deeper expression that you believe when you're able to worship Him and praise him we're told to give thanks in all things that includes our trials that he inhabits the Praises of his people so if you're going to go through the fiery furnace you might also Praise Him you want god with you right all right Psalms 18 verse 2 we're going to have to hurry Psalms 18 2. let this be your testimony in the midst of your battle the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my buckler my horn my salvation and my high tower so who's the battle belonged to look I will call upon the Lord verse 3. who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies we have a job to do call upon the Lord that's what uh josephat did call upon the Lord who's worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies when we give God praise for his worthiness he will move in our behalf when we honor the Lord with respect to praise so shall we be saved from our enemies when our praise magnifies the Lord to the place where you look to God as your Shield as your buckler your personal your personal savior your personal Fortress your personal Hightower you're personally to you he is God not just what the Bible says he is it's got to be personal if he's your rock then say he's my rock if he's your strength and say he's my strength he's my Fortress he's my deliverer he's my buckler he will move upon the confession of your faith whatever you profess or if he's just the god of the Bible that's all he's going to be but he needs to be your God he is the Horn of our salvation doesn't matter what situations going on in our life he promised to be there the battle is the Lord's God fights our battles we learn to trust him I will say of the Lord he is my refuge my Fortress my God in him will I trust amen amen I love this word it just takes all the pressure off of us and I'll tell you this word is not for for this is not for people who are what we would consider good people there's no good people there's no good people there's none this this word is for everybody this word is for us Isaiah chapter 9 verse 5 says for every battle of a warrior is with confused noise you know what battles are like and garments wrote in blood but this shall be with a burning and a fuel fire now this is speaking of the Messiah for every battle of a warrior is with confused noise just keep that in mind a lot of times we go to battles and situations and it becomes so confusing to us amen like what is going on this is this shouldn't be happening this is this is bad this is wrong but that's not the way it's supposed to be for us because God is our Shield he's our buckler he's got everything under control Isaiah 71 verse 1 uh not Isaiah but Psalms 71 verse 1. in thee O Lord do I put my trust let me never be put to confusion if you trust the Lord he'll keep you from confusion deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me be thou my strong habitation where unto I may continually Resort thou has given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my Fortress so let this be your testimony God has the captain of our Salvation has given commandment to save you you are saved by God's commandment he he spoke the word it's his commandment I'm so grateful that we have a promise in God's word today to save us from confusion to save us from disaster and all we have to do is trust her we don't have to figure out how he's going to do it we don't got to figure out when he's going to do it if anything we got to figure out is Lord what would you have me to do to obey you right now and until you tell me I'm going to seek your face and I'm going to worship you I'm going to praise you I'm just going to wait upon you the battle is the Lord's it's not our battle God fights our battles he doesn't even want us to think we did something in the battle he doesn't he wants all the glory to God be all the glory too many people are trusting in themselves to achieve to get Deliverance or to get victory Psalms 118 Verse 8 says it's better to trust the Lord than to put confidence in man now that just doesn't mean the man that stands in front of you that means the man whose eyes you're looking out of it sometimes we put trust in ourself our own reasoning our own understanding our own thinking and it's better to trust the Lord than to put confidence in any man even though the Battle Belongs to the Lord we have a part to play in the war and if we get out of position get out of our post to duty get out of our praise get out of our faith then we have no promise of victory I don't want to be in a place that I have not the promise of Victory so that means I got to stay in my position I got to stay up my post to duty I got to be where God wants me to be and I've got to be praising him and thanking him and worshiping him because that's what brings the promise God is trying to teach us to do our part it's Psalms 144 verse 1. Psalms 44 verse 1 said blessed be the Lord God I'm sorry blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth My Hands to War and my fingers to fight wow you would think that we're going to go to some special martial arts or something like that and we're going to learn you know how to fight um my goodness my Fortress my high tower my deliver my shield and he in whom I trust who subdueth my people under me I believe the way that God is teaching us to war is to trust in him because we don't put our trust in swords and Spears we read that already our trust is in the invisible us the invisible armor of God is invisible that that that that I Trust You Lord above everything that's invisible it can it it becomes manifest eventually we must learn to trust God more to obey what he speaks to us to shout the victory before the battle's over to praise him before we see the victory to hold our confidence steadfast to the end to believe to trust to count those things which are not yet as though they already are amen this is God teaching us teaching Our Hands to War teaching her fingers that's that's how we we're supposed to war God is training us to fight the good fight of faith put our energy in our thoughts and increase in our faith by praying more reading more I'm telling you when you get done reading listening to a tape going to church if your faith is not increased there's something wrong with your hearing there's something wrong with your hearing that's why it's better to pray earnestly and humbly God give me ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the church because we automatically don't have it just because we think we're predestinated it's even if we are predestinated God still expects a humble attitude a humble Spirit amongst us people either try to handle everything on their own and when they don't get it they just give up we don't sit around just waiting for Faith to show up we got to exercise it we got to do the little things do the little things whatever God says do it we got to lay hold of the promises of God Amen Second Chronicles chapter 32 verse 7 says be strong and courageous Be not Afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria nor of all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him with him is the arm of Flesh but with us is the Lord Our God to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah and that's all we got to do we got to rest upon the word of God Amen now we're fighting the good fight of faith fighting to believe more than what we now believe he promised he give power to the faint to them that have no might he increases strength as we spend more time in prayer Isaiah 40 verse 31 tells us but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as egos they shall run and not be where they shall walk and not faint now just by simply waiting in God In Prayer something happens to you you you walk into the prayer closet like a little baby lion and you walk out of there bold as a lion because God comes and he fills you with faith he speaks his word to you Jesus said if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth if you're going to fight fight for faith build yourself up in the Most Holy Faith first John chapter 5 verse 4 you just write it down it says this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so what we need to do is build our faith and keep building it that's the answer not how we can discover how to get out of our problem we need to learn to war to take possession learn to believe that all things are possible endure hardness as a good soldier Jesus Christ Joshua tells us every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that I have given you as I said unto Moses and in verse 5 of Joshua 1 says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee now you've got to put yourself in those shoes are you a believer be strong and of good courage For unto this people shall thou divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give him only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to their right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever thou goest you want to prosper I want to prosper this is all we got to do this book of the law which shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest shall deserve to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success you know a lot of people honestly through the years have mocked me have just belittled and made light of God's grace and I'm telling you the word is for everybody and if if you just follow the word God will hold up his end of the bargain you you can't just do what you want and expect things to work out have not I commanded thee be strong and be of good courage Be not Afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord thy God is with you whether so ever thou goest he's with us by faith take possession of what God has promised you if God has promised you peace take possession just follow the guidelines keep your mind stayed on the Lord well brother John this problem is so big in my life I don't know if I could do that you can do that you can do that start praising them before you know it you think this is crazy but you'll see God's presence will come I just got two scriptures and I'm just gonna I'm not going to read the whole thing when you've got when you've got time uh read all first Timothy chapter six but I want to start here at verse six First Timothy chapter six verse 6 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and certainly we can carry nothing out and having food Remnant let us there with uh be let us be there with content but they that won't be content they that will be rich fall into temptation and snare into many foolish and hurtful lust which drown men in destruction and Perdition now that means spiritually for the love of many is the root of all evil which while some Covenant of after they have aired from the faith and Pierce themselves through many sorrows but thou o man of God flee these things flee and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience and meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses the elders obtained a good report by it fight the good fight of Faith second Timothy chapter four I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ you shall judge the quick and the dead of his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season odyssey's and reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time is going to come when they will not endure what you've got to say but they but after their own desires shall they heat to themselves a certain type of ministry with itching having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto half-truths but thou but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course and I have kept the faith I want us to be able to say that I have fought a good fight I have finished my course and I have kept the faith henceforth you can stand with me henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord uh the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all of us here that love is appearing amen do you love his appearing are you looking forward to it amen if you have kept the faith you're you just can't wait to to just your soul uh inwardly grateful that you just want to see him you love him you want him to return because without faith you know you can't please them and then you don't love that appearing amen so may the Lord just bless you with uh fighting to keep the faith fighting for more faith spending time building faith and and we don't have to wonder where does faith come from and how do I get it we don't need to do that we just need to do the things that produce faith and and and and and praise God uh for it and praise God for what he's going to bring uh through you just trusting God learning to trust God more we all trust God but I want to trust God more we heard about the man that had the wheelbarrow right and he could just walk across Niagara Falls or whatever and this wheelbarrow says big he could do it and everybody was just rooting them on yeah you could do it you can do it we believe in you and they he finally said well if you believe will you come and sit in the wheelbarrow while you go across and then well you know so what we want to do is just be honest we got to increase our faith we've got to increase our faith so we can really see God in our midst amen let's sing I'm going through Lord I have started Lord I have started to walk in the light shining upon me from heaven so bright I paid the world and its Follies a tooth I've started in Jesus and I'm going through and going through yes I'm going through I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll take
