[35:21] a call to help someone along the way
[35:25] help pick someone up and get them back
[35:29] on the right track and lord we just pray
[35:32] for your blessings on the service that
[35:34] you just
[35:34] take the the scriptures
[35:38] lord that will be read in thy precious
[35:42] holy bible and reveal them
[35:46] to our hearts that we might be a better
[35:48] witness
[35:49] for you lord jesus we commit the service
[35:52] now to you
[35:53] ask this grace in jesus christ's name
[35:56] amen amen
[35:59] verse number 8 of acts chapter 1 but ye
[36:03] shall receive
[36:03] power after the holy ghost has come upon
[36:06] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[36:08] both in jerusalem
[36:09] and judea and samaria and under the
[36:12] uttermost parts of the earth god bless
[36:14] you
[36:15] you may be seated we want to entitle
[36:18] this
[36:20] an undeniable witness for christ
[36:25] and the question that came in some time
[36:28] ago
[36:30] when we did the questions read like this
[36:33] how to be an undeniable witness for
[36:37] christ
[36:38] that the world sees me no more
[36:41] and they would see christ only
[36:45] always that is it's a big question
[36:50] and god bless the brother or sister who
[36:52] wrote
[36:53] this question out i see the
[36:57] love and the sincerity in this question
[37:02] i believe it was brother around perhaps
[37:05] when he was praying tonight
[37:07] up here he said lord help us to be
[37:10] better witnesses
[37:14] and i think it to properly receive what
[37:17] god has for each of us
[37:18] we need to approach tonight as if we
[37:20] wrote the question
[37:22] like we're interested in being this
[37:24] undeniable witness for christ
[37:28] um i want to say that we in some areas
[37:31] of our life we probably are a greater
[37:33] witness than what we realize
[37:37] and there's probably areas in our life
[37:39] that we're less of a witness than what
[37:40] we realize
[37:42] and that's what the service is about is
[37:44] is to help us see
[37:46] clearly i'd like to start out by saying
[37:48] this any witnessing
[37:50] that isn't of the holy ghost will lack
[37:52] power
[37:53] to witness correctly and completely
[37:57] it's only through the power of the holy
[37:58] ghost that we can be effective in our
[38:00] witnessing
[38:02] now jesus told his disciples all the
[38:04] do's and don'ts about witnessing
[38:07] how to go out two by two and this is
[38:09] what you're doing dust the
[38:11] feet uh that take the dust off the
[38:14] your shoes if they reject you they had
[38:17] been trained
[38:18] by the author of witnessing himself
[38:22] and before he was taken up to heaven he
[38:24] leaves them with a great commission
[38:27] knowing that the heavens must retain
[38:29] jesus until the times
[38:31] of restitution the bible says and in
[38:33] matthew 28 verse 18
[38:35] jesus came and he spake unto them all
[38:37] power
[38:38] is given unto me in heaven and in earth
[38:41] and with his power he commands his
[38:44] disciples to go ye
[38:46] out and teach all nations baptizing them
[38:50] in the name of the father
[38:51] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[38:54] teaching them to observe
[38:55] all things whatsoever i have commanded
[38:57] you and lo and with you always
[38:59] even to the end of the world amen what a
[39:02] commission
[39:03] teach all people to observe all things
[39:08] it doesn't leave too much time for your
[39:09] own life
[39:12] yet before they could carry out this
[39:14] great commission
[39:15] jesus told them to wait for the power
[39:20] so he spent time teaching them for three
[39:22] and a half years
[39:23] he tells them what to do but he says
[39:26] don't do it
[39:26] until you get the power yes sir
[39:30] now they've received a power in matthew
[39:32] chapter 10
[39:35] a power against unclean spirits to cast
[39:38] them out to heal all men are sickness
[39:40] and all matter diseases so they had a
[39:43] power
[39:45] but they didn't have all the power they
[39:49] need
[39:49] to be an undeniable witness for christ
[39:54] amen it was a greater power
[39:57] it takes a greater power to forgive
[40:00] than to judge to love than to hate
[40:04] to lay down your life than to actually
[40:06] cast out
[40:07] unclean spirits
[40:10] it was the power to properly witness
[40:13] amen
[40:14] to witness more than with your mouth but
[40:16] with your lives
[40:18] in luke chapter 24 verse 49 and there's
[40:21] going to be a lot of scripture so
[40:23] you know we're just going to have a
[40:24] bible old-fashioned bible study with a
[40:26] lot of scriptures
[40:28] and behold i send the promise of my
[40:31] father upon you
[40:32] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[40:35] until you be endued with a power
[40:37] from on high power to witness
[40:42] with their lives
[40:45] a power to witness with their lives in
[40:47] other words a power to suffer long to be
[40:50] kind
[40:50] to be patient to bear all things to
[40:52] endure all things
[40:54] a power to love like god loves a power
[40:57] to lay down
[40:58] our life for one another amen
[41:02] and i believe the power this power today
[41:06] we should be tearing for it as well
[41:09] amen we need it just as much today and
[41:12] the way you get it is terry for it
[41:15] spend time calling on god wanting and
[41:18] desiring the power because
[41:19] those disciples they could have said hey
[41:21] look we already got power we already did
[41:22] all this
[41:23] we only know to cast out devils but it
[41:26] was something different
[41:30] but you shall receive power after the
[41:33] holy ghost
[41:34] has come upon you and you shall be
[41:36] witnesses
[41:38] the holy ghost is what does the
[41:40] witnessing in our bodies
[41:41] we don't do it the holy ghost does it in
[41:44] us
[41:46] the holy ghost has power to continue
[41:48] witnessing
[41:49] when we want to give up when we want to
[41:52] throw in the towel when we want to stop
[41:54] when it becomes just too hard for us it
[41:56] is the holy ghost that keeps going
[41:59] the holy ghost has power to lay
[42:02] our lives down
[42:07] we
[42:10] we can only do so much we can only go so
[42:12] long
[42:15] that the holy ghost in zionists has the
[42:17] ability
[42:19] to restore a soul to win a soul to
[42:22] disciple a soul
[42:25] we don't but the holy ghost has that
[42:27] power
[42:29] and if we want to be an undeniable
[42:31] witness for christ we need the
[42:33] undeniable power of christ
[42:36] proverbs 14 25 says a true
[42:39] witness delivereth souls
[42:43] but a deceitful witness speaketh lies
[42:46] we want to be an undeniable witness for
[42:48] christ that wins souls
[42:51] the bible says they that win souls is
[42:53] wise they'll shine
[42:54] as the stars amen jesus told us in
[42:57] matthew
[42:58] 24 14 and this gospel of the kingdom
[43:01] shall be preached in all the world for
[43:04] a witness yes a witness unto all nations
[43:08] and then shall the end come so the great
[43:12] commission
[43:13] is still happening amen because the end
[43:15] hasn't happened yet
[43:18] this gospel of jesus christ must be
[43:20] preached
[43:22] in all the world as a witness now as we
[43:25] witness to the world it's only going to
[43:28] help a few
[43:29] very few the majority
[43:32] it's going to be a witness against them
[43:36] but you still have to witness to the
[43:38] world
[43:41] so i say that because i just don't want
[43:43] you to be discouraged when you
[43:45] lay down your life for somebody who just
[43:47] just steps on you
[43:50] it's it's just meant to be there's
[43:53] there's few
[43:54] that are going to actually stop
[43:57] and pick you up so as we ask the
[44:00] question
[44:02] how to be an undeniable witness for
[44:04] christ that the world sees me no more
[44:06] and they would see christ only always
[44:10] we must ask this question first
[44:13] to what extreme would you go to become
[44:16] an
[44:17] undeniable witness for christ what price
[44:20] are you willing to pay
[44:24] you must ask those questions first
[44:26] because we all
[44:27] want without giving and you can't get
[44:30] this
[44:31] without giving amen so we get a hunger
[44:34] for it
[44:35] more our hearts want to be an undeniable
[44:38] witness for christ
[44:39] but our flesh it doesn't want to pay the
[44:43] price
[44:44] it wants to suffer the least
[44:48] have no pain
[44:53] and still have that testimony an
[44:55] undeniable witness for christ
[44:57] but god requires more from us than just
[45:00] talking
[45:01] about jesus when ananias was doubting
[45:05] the leadership
[45:06] of god in his life concerning being a
[45:08] good samaritan for saul
[45:11] right remember he said
[45:15] jesus said in acts chapter 9 verse 15 go
[45:17] thy way
[45:19] for he is a chosen vessel unto me
[45:23] to bear my name before the gentiles
[45:25] kings and the children of israel
[45:27] for i will show him how great things he
[45:29] must suffer for my name's sake
[45:33] pawna only suffered many things
[45:37] but he really presented his body a
[45:39] living sacrifice daily
[45:44] and even though he did that he still
[45:45] wanted to present
[45:47] his body at the end of his ministry
[45:50] an offering i mean he wanted to give
[45:54] everything his life his time his money
[45:57] his efforts and then he want to give his
[45:59] body
[46:03] you talk about an undeniable witness for
[46:05] christ so what are you willing to give
[46:07] to be
[46:07] an undeniable witness
[46:14] writing about this in a letter to
[46:16] timothy concerning the day that actually
[46:18] we're living in
[46:19] when believers wanted to hear preaching
[46:28] way they wanted to hear it right second
[46:30] timothy chapter four verse three read it
[46:32] with me second timothy chapter four
[46:34] verse three
[46:36] for the time will come when they will
[46:38] not endure
[46:40] sound doctrine but after their own
[46:44] desires
[46:46] they shall heap to themselves teachers
[46:50] having itching ears
[46:54] in other words they come to church and
[46:56] they want to hear what they want to hear
[46:58] instead of coming to church and saying
[47:00] lord what do you have
[47:05] that's what it means not to endure
[47:09] and they shall turn away their ears from
[47:11] the truth
[47:13] and shall be turned onto fables so
[47:16] anytime you want to hear what you want
[47:18] to hear
[47:19] you're getting away from the truth
[47:20] because god has many things
[47:22] to say to you but you can't bear it now
[47:27] but watch thou in all things
[47:30] endure afflictions do the work of
[47:32] evangelists make full proof
[47:34] of thy ministry so paul is showing us
[47:37] here
[47:38] the difference between these two groups
[47:39] these two ministries one is a fool proof
[47:43] it's foolproof it endures inflictions it
[47:46] it works evangelism
[47:47] it's a spiritual watching but the other
[47:51] one it's a
[47:52] partial proof doesn't want to endure
[47:54] afflictions
[47:56] doesn't want to work it doesn't want to
[47:58] endure to the end
[48:00] it's not sound doctrine
[48:04] paul told timothy early in the book in
[48:05] chapter 2 verse 10 second timothy
[48:08] chapter 2 verse 10 therefore i endure
[48:11] all things for the elect's sake to me
[48:14] that's sound doctrine
[48:16] that sound doctrine right there that
[48:18] they
[48:19] may also obtain salvation which is in
[48:21] christ jesus with eternal glory
[48:23] for his faithful saying for if we be
[48:25] dead with him
[48:26] we shall also live with him if we suffer
[48:30] with him we shall also reign if we
[48:34] suffer but our flesh don't want to
[48:36] suffer
[48:39] sound doctrine right here if we deny him
[48:42] he will
[48:43] he will deny us amen
[48:46] so if we deny suffering he's going to
[48:49] deny us
[48:50] think about it suffering is an integral
[48:54] part
[48:55] of being an effective witness for christ
[48:57] it is an important part
[48:58] it's imperative it's it's extremely
[49:01] important
[49:02] part because i can witness to you
[49:07] sorta with my mouth but it ain't really
[49:11] witnessing
[49:13] then brother brad says i'd rather see
[49:15] you live be a sermon than preach it
[49:18] because one requires suffering
[49:21] laying down your life because that's
[49:22] really what a witness for christ
[49:24] is you live the life that christ lived
[49:28] amen
[49:32] paul said in second timothy chapter four
[49:34] verse six for i
[49:35] am now ready to be offered and the time
[49:39] of my departure
[49:41] is at hand paul got to a place that he
[49:44] said himself that
[49:45] his own life wasn't even dear to him how
[49:48] can we
[49:48] how can a human being get to that place
[49:51] where their own life isn't even dear to
[49:53] them
[49:54] i'll tell you how because when you give
[49:56] your life to god it's no longer yours to
[49:59] be deal with
[50:01] but when you're holding on to it and
[50:02] this is what you want and it's got to be
[50:04] this way
[50:05] you're getting away from being the
[50:07] witness that christ has called you to be
[50:13] now some of you are probably thinking
[50:16] well that was paul
[50:18] he was a chosen vessel he was a special
[50:21] one
[50:24] i thought you thought you were the
[50:27] chosen
[50:29] i thought you thought you were elected
[50:33] what's the difference what's the
[50:38] difference
[50:40] look at this scripture revelations
[50:42] chapter 20 verse 4.
[50:44] now hope you don't mind all the
[50:46] scriptures that just it's just the way
[50:47] it is
[50:50] revelations 20 verse 4 and i saw thrones
[50:54] and they that sat upon them
[50:57] and judgment was given unto them and i
[50:59] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[51:02] for what the witness of jesus
[51:06] wow you want to be a witness for jesus
[51:09] look at
[51:09] they went through
[51:13] and for the word of god and
[51:16] which had not worshipped the beast
[51:18] neither his image
[51:19] neither had received the mark upon their
[51:21] foreheads or their hands
[51:23] and they lived and reigned
[51:26] with christ a thousand years this
[51:30] is the elect if you're gonna ruin
[51:33] reign with christ you are the bride
[51:38] and look what they had to suffer
[51:47] undeniable witness for christ they're
[51:49] willing to suffer they're reigning
[51:52] we just we just read the scripture
[51:57] if you want to be an undeniable witness
[52:00] for jesus christ always remember you got
[52:02] a target on your back
[52:04] there is a target on your back
[52:07] no matter how true of a witness you can
[52:10] be you will always
[52:11] have that target in fact the godlier you
[52:14] live
[52:14] the more you're going to suffer for it
[52:18] simply because the more that you love
[52:20] god
[52:22] the more the devil hates you
[52:26] don't look at him as the same because if
[52:30] you live in the world the devil's going
[52:31] to leave your
[52:32] leave you alone and you won't have much
[52:34] persecution but you start standing for
[52:36] the truth
[52:39] you got a target on your back second
[52:42] timothy chapter 3 verse 10
[52:45] but thou has fully known my doctrine
[52:49] my manner of life my purpose
[52:53] my faith my long-suffering my charity
[52:56] my patience my persecutions
[53:01] my afflictions he never said
[53:04] anything about my speech
[53:10] it's talking about the life that he
[53:12] witnesses amen
[53:15] which came unto me at antioch iconium
[53:17] lystra
[53:18] what persecutions i endured
[53:22] but out of them all the lord delivered
[53:24] me so he gives the praise he knows it's
[53:26] god inside of him amen
[53:28] but he says look it's not just me being
[53:30] the chosen vessel now
[53:31] yeah all that will live godly in christ
[53:33] jesus they're going to suffer the same
[53:35] persecutions
[53:38] it's just it's really a part of being
[53:42] an undeniable witness for christ
[53:45] peter could not stand the test
[53:54] he was missing what he needed to stand
[53:56] the test
[53:59] we need the holy ghost
[54:02] so bear in mind that as we desire to be
[54:06] this type of witness
[54:07] that we're going to end up suffering
[54:09] more in the flesh
[54:11] for it so that's why i ask the question
[54:14] what are you willing to give up how
[54:17] how deep do you want to go with being a
[54:20] witness for christ
[54:22] in this way we just can't get away from
[54:24] suffering
[54:26] amen the spirit in
[54:29] this last day paul called this day
[54:33] perilous times and
[54:37] the spirit would cause people to be
[54:39] satisfied
[54:40] with just a form of godliness
[54:44] i'm in the message i got friends in the
[54:46] message i
[54:47] come to church i'm i believe this
[54:55] but people are not going to be suffering
[54:57] very much persecutions
[54:59] if you have only a form of godliness
[55:03] because the devil's not scared of a form
[55:08] but when you've got power you've got the
[55:11] power of the holy ghost
[55:13] then you're going to get persecuted
[55:18] remember you're an enemy of satan
[55:21] and he wants to destroy your witness
[55:24] he wants to destroy your influence that
[55:27] you have
[55:28] he wants you to become ineffective
[55:32] in your witnessing
[55:37] so the more you're on target
[55:41] the more the devil has got his guns
[55:44] pointed at you
[55:50] now jesus to me was the most perfect
[55:52] example of being an undeniable witness
[55:55] for the father
[55:57] yet there were many people who denied it
[55:59] and this is kind of what's important
[56:01] that we understand
[56:03] just because you're witnessing really
[56:06] well
[56:07] it doesn't mean you got a parade
[56:11] behind you and and the and the trumpets
[56:14] and the and the
[56:16] the bands are going
[56:19] jesus was loved by his father he was
[56:22] hated by
[56:24] his brethren just like joseph here he
[56:27] was sold out for
[56:29] personal gain amen
[56:32] jesus was called a liar a beelzebub
[56:35] accused of not caring for the people
[56:39] the common people ordered him gladly but
[56:40] it was those religious people
[56:43] he had a problem with the most he was a
[56:46] true witness for the father
[56:48] but with those religious people
[56:55] he wasn't a true witness
[57:01] god hid himself from the knowledge
[57:07] jesus had an amazing ministry most of
[57:10] the people on the planet
[57:11] most had benefited from jesus ministry
[57:14] when he was there
[57:15] he chose 12 disciples to help him
[57:18] spread the good news
[57:21] the bible tells us that when he saw the
[57:25] multitudes he was moved with compassion
[57:28] because he saw them fainting having uh
[57:33] being sheep having no shepherd no one to
[57:35] lead them no one to guide them so
[57:37] he asked his twelve disciples would you
[57:40] pray
[57:41] with me on this situation just pray with
[57:43] me about it
[57:48] eventually 70 more disciples wanted to
[57:51] help
[57:51] witness with jesus amazing ministry
[57:56] but we know what happened they got to a
[57:58] place
[57:59] where they couldn't stomach the word
[58:04] they complained about the word being too
[58:07] hard for
[58:08] them they wanted it like this
[58:12] and not like the way jesus was giving it
[58:14] out
[58:16] and what happened to him they eventually
[58:18] left
[58:20] i'll say it like this to you without a
[58:22] love for all the word
[58:23] how will you manifest all the word
[58:27] in in order for me to manifest perfect
[58:29] love i've got to deny myself
[58:32] and i know i don't want to you know hear
[58:34] about denying myself and dying out but
[58:36] how am i going to manifest what i really
[58:38] want if i don't do what i need to do
[58:40] first
[58:42] so it's part of the gospel you can't
[58:45] leave out
[58:46] you're only going to make partial proof
[58:48] of your ministry
[58:51] man shall live by every word of god
[58:56] witnessing isn't just sharing with our
[58:58] lips the enjoyable part of the word
[59:02] it's sharing with our lives in thousands
[59:04] of way how jesus handles so many
[59:06] situations
[59:09] brother branham taught us if you want to
[59:11] know how god is just look at jesus
[59:13] and you'll know exactly exactly
[59:16] who god is we want
[59:19] people to look at our lives
[59:23] through all the trials and all the tests
[59:25] and all the things that were
[59:26] that's going wrong and and then they got
[59:29] a chance of seeing the real christ
[59:38] how do we handle life how do we
[59:41] handle persecutions how do we handle
[59:44] false accusations
[59:48] so after the 70 changed their minds and
[59:51] left jesus turns to his disciples
[59:53] and he asked a question are you on your
[59:56] way out too
[59:58] is this too hard for you will you go
[1:00:01] away will you also go away he said
[1:00:06] and in john chapter 6 verse 6 8 then
[1:00:08] simon peter answered lord
[1:00:11] to whom shall we go thou has the words
[1:00:14] of eternal life
[1:00:16] in other words whatever you say that's
[1:00:18] the way it's going to go
[1:00:20] just like roof i'll go where you go
[1:00:23] i'll live where you live she wasn't
[1:00:26] worrying about
[1:00:26] suffering
[1:00:31] we need to hunger for all the word to be
[1:00:33] an undeniable witness for christ
[1:00:35] amen of course satan didn't like
[1:00:38] the stand that the 12 disciples took at
[1:00:41] that time
[1:00:43] so what does he do satan smites the
[1:00:46] shepherd
[1:00:47] and watches the sheep scatter
[1:00:51] those disciples were trained by the very
[1:00:53] best trainer
[1:00:54] ever in the history of the world
[1:00:58] but without the holy ghost inside of
[1:01:00] them it was impossible
[1:01:01] to witness for christ undeniably through
[1:01:04] their persecutions
[1:01:08] and this is where most of the time we
[1:01:11] fail
[1:01:12] because we're trying to prove something
[1:01:19] so i want to ask the question when push
[1:01:21] comes to shove
[1:01:23] can we lay down our life
[1:01:26] when push comes to shove can we continue
[1:01:29] to love the unlovable
[1:01:31] or are you just going to quit walk away
[1:01:33] and say well you know god's with me over
[1:01:36] here
[1:01:38] can we endure all things for the elect's
[1:01:40] sake
[1:01:42] in other words can we be an undeniable
[1:01:45] witness for christ
[1:01:48] it's more than what you say it's how you
[1:01:52] handle everything that comes against you
[1:01:54] even if it's wrong amen amen
[1:01:59] satan wanted to destroy jesus because
[1:02:02] he was being an undeniable witness for
[1:02:05] his heavenly father
[1:02:07] so what does the devil do he sets up
[1:02:09] false accusers
[1:02:11] false witnesses to achieve his ultimate
[1:02:13] goal matthew chapter 26
[1:02:15] verse 59 so this is going to happen as
[1:02:18] you're wanting to be a good witness for
[1:02:20] christ people are going to come and
[1:02:21] they're going to falsely accuse you
[1:02:24] they did it to jesus and he told us if
[1:02:26] they did it to the
[1:02:28] to the green tree what are they going to
[1:02:31] do to the dry tree
[1:02:34] now the chief priests and the elders and
[1:02:36] all the councils fought witness against
[1:02:38] jesus
[1:02:38] to put him to death but found none
[1:02:43] yea though look at this many false
[1:02:46] witnesses came yet found a nun
[1:02:51] now the last came two false witnesses
[1:02:54] and they said this fellow
[1:02:55] said i am able to destroy the temple of
[1:02:58] god and build it in three days
[1:03:01] which was exactly the truth
[1:03:05] but because of their carnal
[1:03:06] understanding they didn't understand
[1:03:08] what it meant
[1:03:12] and the high priest rose and said unto
[1:03:14] him answer thou
[1:03:16] nothing what is it what is it which
[1:03:20] these witnesses against thee
[1:03:24] look at here but jesus held his peace
[1:03:29] you talk about a good way to witness
[1:03:33] sometimes we just need to hold our peace
[1:03:35] when people are going like this at you
[1:03:37] amen i know you you feel like oh i want
[1:03:40] to be a better witness why is this
[1:03:42] happening to me
[1:03:43] it's happening because the bible says
[1:03:45] all they that live
[1:03:46] godly in christ jesus are going to
[1:03:48] suffer it
[1:03:50] i know we want to get away from it no we
[1:03:52] don't want to go through that
[1:03:55] christians hurt
[1:04:01] they're the only group that gets hurt
[1:04:04] and still stands
[1:04:06] yes amen the only group that turns the
[1:04:09] cheek
[1:04:09] that goes the second mile that keeps
[1:04:12] going
[1:04:12] because it's not them it's god in them
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] it's the holy ghost in them amen
[1:04:22] jesus held his peace when he was falsely
[1:04:26] accused if you're never getting falsely
[1:04:30] accused i'm going to say there's
[1:04:31] something's wrong
[1:04:32] somewhere
[1:04:35] beware when all men speak good of you
[1:04:41] now the same thing happens when jesus
[1:04:43] goes before pilate the very same thing
[1:04:45] matthew a little further in the chapter
[1:04:47] matthew chapter or next chapter over
[1:04:49] chapter 27 verse 12
[1:04:50] matthew 27 verse 12 and when he was
[1:04:53] accused of the chief priests and the
[1:04:55] elders
[1:04:55] he answered nothing
[1:04:59] then said pilate unto him hearst
[1:05:03] thou not how many things
[1:05:06] their witness against thee and he
[1:05:09] answered
[1:05:10] him to never a word
[1:05:14] in so much that the governor
[1:05:17] marveled greatly
[1:05:21] do you want to be an undeniable witness
[1:05:22] for christ do you want
[1:05:25] people to marvel greatly
[1:05:28] then learn let learn to let god fight
[1:05:30] your battles
[1:05:32] not you but god fight them in other
[1:05:35] words
[1:05:35] you have to learn to suffer well
[1:05:42] you just don't say a word and suffer
[1:05:44] make it
[1:05:45] let it look like it's just all true
[1:05:50] that's what jesus did he's our example
[1:05:57] he'll sort it out amen
[1:06:01] there's always going to be people bear
[1:06:02] false witness against you
[1:06:04] even though it's commanded by god thou
[1:06:06] shalt not bear false witness
[1:06:08] right it's one of the commandments
[1:06:10] people are still doing it amen
[1:06:12] it's the spirit of self
[1:06:15] it is the spirit of self especially in
[1:06:18] this age despisers are those that are
[1:06:20] good
[1:06:21] i i mean if nobody's you know doing me
[1:06:24] any harm
[1:06:26] why in the world do i feel even tempted
[1:06:28] to go
[1:06:31] falsely accuse this person it's not
[1:06:34] bothering me
[1:06:34] i don't even know the person they're
[1:06:35] just driving down the expressway they
[1:06:37] didn't bother me
[1:06:44] see it's something behind it
[1:06:48] something's behind that you just keep
[1:06:50] doing good
[1:06:52] just keep doing good amen when jesus
[1:06:56] described
[1:06:57] jesus he said when reviled he reviled
[1:06:59] not again but he committed himself to
[1:07:02] him that judges
[1:07:03] righteously that's hard to do it takes
[1:07:05] trust
[1:07:07] you have to trust god beyond you having
[1:07:09] to get something worked out
[1:07:12] amen jesus was an undeniable witness we
[1:07:16] must follow his example if we want to be
[1:07:19] an undeniable witness
[1:07:22] keep in mind as we witness this way
[1:07:26] we never never bear witness of our light
[1:07:33] jesus didn't bear witness of his life
[1:07:39] i mean jesus did say i am the light of
[1:07:42] the world
[1:07:43] but this is how he how he spoke it in
[1:07:46] john chapter 5 verse 31
[1:07:48] john chapter 5 verse 31 if i bear
[1:07:51] witness of myself
[1:07:53] my witness is not true
[1:07:56] so when you stand and you want to give
[1:07:58] witness to yourself
[1:08:00] it's not a true witness of christ
[1:08:04] so an undeniable witness for christ does
[1:08:06] not even mix his own light with the
[1:08:08] light of christ
[1:08:10] john chapter 1 verse 6 john chapter 1
[1:08:13] verse 6 there was a man sent
[1:08:15] from god whose name was john the same
[1:08:18] came for a witness
[1:08:20] to bear witness of the light that all
[1:08:23] men through
[1:08:24] him might believe notice he was not that
[1:08:28] light
[1:08:29] but he was set to bear witness of that
[1:08:31] light
[1:08:33] that was the true light which light of
[1:08:35] every man that cometh into the world
[1:08:37] he was in the world the world was made
[1:08:39] by him in the world knew him not
[1:08:42] he came to his own and his own received
[1:08:43] him not
[1:08:50] see even though we want to be an
[1:08:52] undeniable witness for christ
[1:08:54] it doesn't mean everybody's going to
[1:08:55] flock to us and say yo yeah
[1:08:57] you're a believer
[1:09:01] what did jesus tell nicodemus in john
[1:09:03] chapter 1 verse
[1:09:04] 11 john i'm sorry john 3 verse 11. very
[1:09:08] very
[1:09:08] saying to you we speak that we do know
[1:09:11] and testify that what we have seen
[1:09:13] and ye receive not our
[1:09:16] witness but that doesn't mean you you
[1:09:19] still can't be
[1:09:20] an undeniable witness for christ
[1:09:23] that's right you just got to know ahead
[1:09:26] of time
[1:09:27] the majority of the people are not going
[1:09:29] to receive that
[1:09:31] the majority won't they didn't receive
[1:09:32] christ
[1:09:35] i mean everybody does not mind them
[1:09:38] being fed
[1:09:39] them being taken care of jesus taking
[1:09:42] them to heaven paying for the price at
[1:09:44] calvary
[1:09:45] but the moment that jesus says i want
[1:09:47] you to lay down your life for your
[1:09:49] brother
[1:09:49] wait a minute i want a different gospel
[1:09:53] it's a partial gospel amen
[1:09:59] but as many as received him as many as
[1:10:02] received him
[1:10:03] to them gave he power to become
[1:10:06] the sons of god even to them that
[1:10:08] believe on his name
[1:10:10] i want power to witness all that a
[1:10:13] christian
[1:10:13] should witness amen what i notice about
[1:10:17] most people
[1:10:18] that we have witnessed too is that they
[1:10:21] rejoice with you for a
[1:10:23] short time they appreciate you in the
[1:10:27] ministry
[1:10:28] for a while but eventually they go off
[1:10:31] and do their own thing
[1:10:32] now we have seen this many people
[1:10:35] come and go over the years remember
[1:10:38] witnessing to somebody
[1:10:39] in a restaurant
[1:10:42] and began to talk to them about the lord
[1:10:45] and they finally came to church and i'll
[1:10:47] tell you the first day they were in
[1:10:48] church
[1:10:49] they were weeping in the presence of god
[1:10:52] and i came in the next next morning or
[1:10:56] to the restaurant and there there she
[1:10:58] was she was a waitress
[1:11:00] and she told me about everything that
[1:11:01] was happening
[1:11:03] uh that god was dealing with her right
[1:11:06] in the in the service
[1:11:08] and it wasn't long after that she
[1:11:09] stopped coming
[1:11:14] and there's stories after stories after
[1:11:16] stories
[1:11:17] about it they rejoice with you for a
[1:11:20] while
[1:11:20] they appreciate you they appreciate the
[1:11:22] ministry and after a while
[1:11:24] they just leave
[1:11:28] just when you think they've received the
[1:11:30] light you realize
[1:11:32] they were only rejoicing in it for a
[1:11:34] time
[1:11:36] jesus said in john referring to
[1:11:40] uh john referring to john the baptist in
[1:11:42] john chapter 5
[1:11:44] saint john chapter 5 verse 35 he was a
[1:11:47] burning and a shining light and ye
[1:11:51] were willing for a season to rejoice in
[1:11:54] his light
[1:11:55] yes the hardest thing i think for a
[1:11:57] believer is is
[1:11:59] to deny himself to keep denying himself
[1:12:03] to continue to walk in new light amen
[1:12:07] because everybody wants to be set free
[1:12:09] from the devil
[1:12:10] but they don't want to be a true lay
[1:12:12] down your life servant for christ
[1:12:15] and you've got to continue to deny
[1:12:17] yourself to keep walking in the new
[1:12:19] light because
[1:12:20] jesus don't come to a believer who needs
[1:12:22] to be saved and says you need to lay
[1:12:23] down your life
[1:12:25] and start serving others no there's a
[1:12:27] greater need
[1:12:28] the need is this man needs salvation
[1:12:31] this need this man needs to come to know
[1:12:33] me as
[1:12:33] a savior but after a while
[1:12:37] there's more light
[1:12:41] we got to continue to walk in the light
[1:12:43] as he's in the light amen amen
[1:12:46] all right verse 36 but i have
[1:12:50] greater witness than that of john
[1:12:53] for the works which the father has given
[1:12:57] me to finish
[1:12:58] the same works that i do bear witness
[1:13:02] of me that the father have sent me
[1:13:07] the works bear witness of who you're
[1:13:10] really
[1:13:11] representing not what you say
[1:13:14] not what you believe not which what camp
[1:13:17] you're
[1:13:17] in it's the works
[1:13:24] do not let yourself become discouraged
[1:13:28] there's always going to be people around
[1:13:30] you that doubt
[1:13:31] your witness john chapter 10 verse 24
[1:13:35] says then came the jews round about
[1:13:39] him and said unto him how long does thou
[1:13:41] make us to doubt
[1:13:42] if thou be the christ just tell us
[1:13:44] plainly
[1:13:47] are you an undeniable witness or not
[1:13:51] jesus answered them i told you and you
[1:13:55] you believe not the works that i do in
[1:14:00] my father's name
[1:14:01] they bear witness of me
[1:14:04] our focus needs to be in our works
[1:14:08] the thing that we don't think much about
[1:14:10] the thing we put
[1:14:11] little attention to
[1:14:16] john chapter 15 verse 25 but this came
[1:14:19] to pass that the word might be fulfilled
[1:14:21] that it is written in the law they hated
[1:14:23] me without a cause
[1:14:26] they hated jesus without a cause
[1:14:30] hatred can become vicious
[1:14:35] even without a cause
[1:14:40] hatred without a cause is simply this is
[1:14:43] a john martin definition
[1:14:45] is simply a spirit of self that is out
[1:14:48] of control
[1:14:51] it's yourself out of control
[1:14:56] when you don't get what you want you
[1:14:58] begin to hate
[1:14:59] in some form or another and when you do
[1:15:02] it's going to come out
[1:15:05] look at cain
[1:15:09] we want to be filled with the spirit we
[1:15:10] want to speak the truth and love
[1:15:13] not hate speak the truth in love
[1:15:16] praise the lord jesus's whole life
[1:15:21] was to bear witness of the truth
[1:15:24] john chapter 18 verse 37 pilate
[1:15:27] therefore said unto him
[1:15:28] art thou a king then i'm sorry i have to
[1:15:32] go through this so fast because there's
[1:15:34] just a lot to get through
[1:15:36] jesus answered thou sayest that i am a
[1:15:38] king
[1:15:39] to this end was i born for this cause
[1:15:42] came
[1:15:42] into the world that i should bear
[1:15:44] witness unto the truth
[1:15:48] and everyone that is of truth hears my
[1:15:50] voice
[1:15:58] what's your purpose that you're in the
[1:15:59] world
[1:16:04] should it not be the same
[1:16:08] now look he bore witness and he's
[1:16:11] standing in front of a man that was
[1:16:13] doubting
[1:16:15] that he didn't know but he couldn't hear
[1:16:18] the voice of god
[1:16:20] right pilate couldn't hear the voice of
[1:16:23] god
[1:16:24] if he did he would have never allowed
[1:16:26] this to happen
[1:16:29] only those that really
[1:16:32] hear the voice of god are going to be
[1:16:34] able to witness you an
[1:16:36] undeniable witness for christ
[1:16:39] you're not going to get everybody to
[1:16:40] jump on board amen
[1:16:52] jesus addresses this church laodicea
[1:16:56] the church in this age he addresses him
[1:16:59] these things saith the amen
[1:17:01] the faithful and true witness yes
[1:17:04] jesus was a faithful and true witness
[1:17:08] but look how many people are blind can't
[1:17:11] see it
[1:17:13] and to this day our crucifying him
[1:17:16] afresh
[1:17:19] so we want to be an undeniable witness
[1:17:22] for christ
[1:17:23] but it isn't it isn't going to be like
[1:17:26] we would like it to be true i would want
[1:17:29] to live such a
[1:17:30] a perfect life that everybody just
[1:17:33] passed me on the back and says yeah
[1:17:34] you're you're a real christian brother
[1:17:37] john
[1:17:40] no it's never gonna happen
[1:17:46] but we're not called
[1:17:50] to bring everybody in we're called to
[1:17:54] witness to everybody
[1:17:56] but only few come in the majority your
[1:18:00] witness of being the christian
[1:18:02] that acts right is the one that's going
[1:18:05] to
[1:18:05] witness against them on the day of
[1:18:07] judgment
[1:18:10] we're still called to witness to them we
[1:18:12] just don't get the results we want i
[1:18:14] hope you understand what i'm trying to
[1:18:15] say
[1:18:16] acts chapter 26 verse 15
[1:18:20] god calls men to witness
[1:18:23] and here paul
[1:18:27] is giving his testimony sharing his
[1:18:28] testimony and he asked
[1:18:31] the lord this question who art thou lord
[1:18:33] and he said i am jesus
[1:18:35] whom thou persecuted so i'm going to say
[1:18:37] like this
[1:18:38] when you
[1:18:41] you
[1:18:45] when you're persecuting the the truth
[1:18:50] you're persecuting jesus amen
[1:18:55] when you're persecuting someone who's
[1:18:57] standing for the truth
[1:18:58] you're persecuting jesus because that's
[1:19:00] exactly what's happening with saul here
[1:19:04] and jesus said i i am jesus whom thou
[1:19:07] persecuted
[1:19:08] but arise and stand upon thy feet for i
[1:19:10] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:19:12] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:19:14] knows they're two different things
[1:19:17] there are two different things here now
[1:19:19] they can be the same
[1:19:21] but they're smoking two different things
[1:19:23] both of these things without
[1:19:24] seeing those things which i will appear
[1:19:26] unto thee
[1:19:28] oh by the way you're gonna have to
[1:19:34] suffer
[1:19:37] that's part of being a witness when you
[1:19:40] minister
[1:19:41] you don't win you don't suffer not
[1:19:44] suffering when you're telling somebody
[1:19:47] you know
[1:19:48] you need to cut your hair
[1:19:53] no
[1:19:59] but look verse 17 delivering thee from
[1:20:02] the people and from the gentiles whom i
[1:20:04] now send you why don't you just not send
[1:20:05] me and then you want to worry about
[1:20:06] delivering me
[1:20:10] but if you're going to be a true witness
[1:20:13] you're going to get persecuted and
[1:20:14] you're going to need deliverance
[1:20:16] yes amen from the persecutors
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:20] but you still have the job to open their
[1:20:22] eyes
[1:20:23] to turn them from darkness into light
[1:20:24] from the power of satan unto god now how
[1:20:26] did he do that by preaching
[1:20:28] no but when he got
[1:20:31] whipped and he got shipwrecked and he
[1:20:33] went through all those things
[1:20:35] and he stood there and he said father
[1:20:37] forgive they don't know what they're
[1:20:38] doing
[1:20:38] that was a witness that was a witness of
[1:20:42] jesus christ
[1:20:44] being alive he's risen from the from the
[1:20:46] tomb
[1:20:50] still preach still got to preach but you
[1:20:52] got a witness
[1:20:54] you got to be in undeniable he was an
[1:20:56] undeniable witness
[1:21:00] being an about witness is a huge
[1:21:02] responsibility it isn't easy
[1:21:06] i've read this quote before brother
[1:21:08] branham said
[1:21:09] and a man running from the presence of
[1:21:11] the lord he says christianity and i just
[1:21:12] want to
[1:21:13] put in here an undeniable witness of
[1:21:16] christianity
[1:21:18] is an everyday rugged life living for
[1:21:19] god in this present world
[1:21:22] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[1:21:25] the love of god
[1:21:26] in the heart that sets you off fire and
[1:21:28] puts you out yonder with people making
[1:21:30] converts for christ
[1:21:33] wow that's an undeniable witness for
[1:21:36] christ
[1:21:37] it's all about responsibility a rugged
[1:21:41] life
[1:21:41] is a life filled with suffering
[1:21:45] for others
[1:21:48] a major part of being an undeniable
[1:21:50] witness for christ
[1:21:51] is being willing to suffer for the lord
[1:21:56] if you're willing to suffer you're going
[1:21:58] to be witness
[1:21:59] more if you're not willing to suffer
[1:22:02] don't want to
[1:22:03] go through any kind of pain
[1:22:06] then how are you going to witness form
[1:22:08] isn't that what peter did
[1:22:12] before he got the holy ghost isn't that
[1:22:14] how he acted
[1:22:17] but after he got the holy ghost
[1:22:21] he found himself unworthy to be
[1:22:22] crucified like jesus was crucified and
[1:22:25] he wanted to crucify himself upside down
[1:22:29] so the more that you want to suffer from
[1:22:31] the greater witness you can be for him
[1:22:34] remember it's not what happens to you
[1:22:37] the most
[1:22:38] but how you react to what happens to you
[1:22:41] how you react that's the witness
[1:22:44] we don't want to spend time talking
[1:22:46] about what was said what was done
[1:22:48] that there's there's no there's no
[1:22:51] witness in that
[1:22:52] the witness is how you are going to
[1:22:54] react to what was said to you
[1:22:56] what was done to you amen
[1:23:00] that becomes your witness is your
[1:23:04] reaction first peter chapter five verse
[1:23:07] one
[1:23:08] first peter chapter five verse one the
[1:23:09] elders which
[1:23:11] are among you i exhort
[1:23:14] i'm also an elder and a witness of what
[1:23:18] of the sufferings of christ
[1:23:24] peter was a witness of the sufferings of
[1:23:26] christ and also a partaker of the glory
[1:23:28] that shall be revealed
[1:23:31] paul was a witness
[1:23:35] look at all the sufferings he went
[1:23:38] through everything that
[1:23:39] the persecutions that accompanied him he
[1:23:41] was filled with sufferings and yet
[1:23:44] he wanted to know christ more in the
[1:23:46] fellowship of his sufferings
[1:23:50] it's the power to say like this it's the
[1:23:52] part of god that most people
[1:23:54] run away from so if you want to get to
[1:23:57] the heart of god
[1:23:59] go where most people don't go
[1:24:03] lord i'm going through whatever others
[1:24:06] do
[1:24:07] whatever they say however they act i'm
[1:24:09] going through it's me and you lord
[1:24:11] amen first john chapter 1 verse 1
[1:24:15] first john chapter 1 verse 1 1-1-1
[1:24:21] that which was from the beginning that
[1:24:23] which we have heard
[1:24:25] which we have seen with our eyes which
[1:24:26] we have looked upon and our hands have
[1:24:28] handled of the word of
[1:24:30] life for the life was manifested
[1:24:33] and we seen it john said and we bear
[1:24:35] witness
[1:24:37] but what does he say here and show unto
[1:24:40] you
[1:24:41] that eternal life which was with the
[1:24:44] father
[1:24:45] and was manifested onto us
[1:24:48] that which we have seen and heard we
[1:24:50] declare it unto you
[1:24:52] that ye also may have fellowship with us
[1:24:54] and truly our fellowship
[1:24:56] is with the father and with his son
[1:24:58] jesus christ
[1:25:00] so we take whatever christ has given us
[1:25:03] and we bear witness you can't give out
[1:25:07] what you don't have
[1:25:10] try loving your enemy when you don't
[1:25:12] have that love inside of you to love
[1:25:14] that enemy
[1:25:16] amen try
[1:25:19] go on the second mile when you said i'm
[1:25:21] done with this situation
[1:25:23] try turning the cheek when you said i've
[1:25:24] turned it enough
[1:25:26] you understand what i'm saying
[1:25:30] we witness with our life and we need to
[1:25:32] look for opportunities to lay down our
[1:25:34] life for somebody
[1:25:35] to esteem someone better than ourselves
[1:25:39] to witness with your life and not just
[1:25:41] our words
[1:25:43] to wash somebody's feet they're dirty
[1:25:47] they're stinky they shouldn't have been
[1:25:48] walking where they were walking
[1:25:50] they need to be taken care of but will
[1:25:52] you lay down your life to help somebody
[1:25:54] or are you just going to
[1:25:58] talk about it
[1:26:03] we preach with our mouth but we witness
[1:26:06] with our life
[1:26:09] we've all been given a ministry to
[1:26:11] witness to the world with
[1:26:12] amen second corinthians chapter five
[1:26:14] tells us that we've all
[1:26:15] been given a ministry of reconciliation
[1:26:19] i think brother ron made mention of that
[1:26:20] in our men's meeting or maybe it was
[1:26:22] brother mark one of you we've been given
[1:26:25] a ministry of reconciliation
[1:26:28] and he committed it to us and this day
[1:26:31] we are ambassadors for christ
[1:26:35] not for our lives but for the life of
[1:26:38] christ
[1:26:40] now we witness our ministry
[1:26:47] as an ambassador of christ we want to be
[1:26:50] the very best
[1:26:52] representative that we can be for god
[1:26:56] but if we only
[1:27:00] speak to people in part
[1:27:04] and not the whole then we're not going
[1:27:07] back
[1:27:07] to what god told us in the great
[1:27:09] commission teach
[1:27:10] all things to all people
[1:27:13] to observe everything that i've i've
[1:27:15] commanded you
[1:27:18] so god is interested that everyone
[1:27:21] walks in all the light yes not just me
[1:27:27] not just you but the people you talk to
[1:27:32] your family your neighbors we
[1:27:35] talked about our neighbors god has this
[1:27:39] undeniable longing and desire to see
[1:27:42] people walk in truth i have no greater
[1:27:44] joy
[1:27:44] than to see that my children than to
[1:27:46] hear my children walk in truth
[1:27:50] now the scripture teaches us how to be a
[1:27:53] model witness
[1:27:54] amen in fact second timothy chapter 3
[1:27:57] verse 16 says all scripture
[1:27:59] is given by the inspiration of god and
[1:28:01] it's profitable for doctrine for reproof
[1:28:03] for correction for instruction or
[1:28:04] righteousness
[1:28:05] we might say that the man of god may be
[1:28:07] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:28:09] good works
[1:28:10] i believe notice all good works that's
[1:28:13] where you witness
[1:28:17] we can become an undeniable witness
[1:28:19] through these scriptures that we have
[1:28:22] second corinthians chapter six verse one
[1:28:25] second corinthians chapter six verse one
[1:28:27] we then as workers together how many
[1:28:30] wants to work together amen
[1:28:32] you know it's harder to work with
[1:28:34] somebody
[1:28:39] it's easier to work by yourself
[1:28:51] god wanted every one of his disciples
[1:28:57] in one mind and one accord he
[1:29:00] he did not come with the power until
[1:29:02] they got there
[1:29:04] we're all wanting a greater power to be
[1:29:07] a greater witness
[1:29:10] well we need to take the steps the
[1:29:12] humble steps to get there because all
[1:29:14] them
[1:29:14] were on as it were in the knees in their
[1:29:17] heart
[1:29:18] humbling themselves with one mind one
[1:29:20] accord
[1:29:21] desiring god
[1:29:24] when you desire god that's when god can
[1:29:28] come
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:33] we then as workers together with him
[1:29:36] beseech you
[1:29:37] also that ye receive not the grace of
[1:29:39] god in vain
[1:29:40] for he saith i have heard thee in the
[1:29:42] time accepted in the day of salvation
[1:29:44] have i suckered thee be hold now is the
[1:29:46] accepted time
[1:29:47] behold now is the day of salvation verse
[1:29:50] 3 giving no
[1:29:51] offense in anything that the ministry
[1:29:54] be not blamed so when you're wanting to
[1:29:57] be an undeniable witness for christ you
[1:29:59] have this
[1:30:00] ministry right you're witnessing
[1:30:03] you don't want your ministry blamed
[1:30:08] so the way to do that is give no offense
[1:30:13] sometimes when we witness for jesus we
[1:30:16] can become
[1:30:17] directly or indirectly offensive
[1:30:21] we've all experienced it
[1:30:25] what i mean is that there could be
[1:30:26] something in our mind that's offensive
[1:30:29] towards another person
[1:30:33] sometimes you don't know how to say it
[1:30:35] you don't know what to say but she feels
[1:30:37] it needs to be said
[1:30:38] i'll just tell you if you conceive a
[1:30:40] thought a negative thought
[1:30:42] inside it's going to come out somehow
[1:30:44] because you've conceived it
[1:30:47] the key is don't conceive the thought
[1:30:52] you don't want to conceive a thought
[1:30:53] that
[1:30:55] ends up wanting to condemn somebody we
[1:30:58] don't want to throw the baby out with
[1:30:59] the bathwater
[1:31:01] we don't want to call down fire from
[1:31:02] heaven upon somebody
[1:31:05] and we don't want to blast someone
[1:31:06] else's ministry just because we don't
[1:31:08] agree
[1:31:12] that would be an offense and eventually
[1:31:13] would hurt your own ministry
[1:31:15] your own witness now we're talking about
[1:31:18] being an
[1:31:18] undeniable witness for christ luke
[1:31:20] chapter 17 verse 1
[1:31:22] luke chapter 17 verse 1 then said he
[1:31:25] unto
[1:31:25] the disciples it is impossible but
[1:31:29] the that offenses will come
[1:31:33] they're going to come you can't get away
[1:31:35] from it i know you want to be in the
[1:31:37] best church
[1:31:38] with the most loving people
[1:31:41] and have the best neighbors and you want
[1:31:43] to be married to the best man
[1:31:45] and the best woman and have the best
[1:31:48] children
[1:31:48] and the best parents but i'm telling you
[1:31:51] all fences are going to come
[1:31:58] but woe unto him through
[1:32:01] whom they come
[1:32:05] this means you have control
[1:32:09] of not being an offense
[1:32:12] with your ministry
[1:32:19] we share the gospel truth
[1:32:22] we share it with defense
[1:32:27] you stand for the word
[1:32:30] you don't stand against another person
[1:32:32] you're trying to save them you have to
[1:32:33] have the spirit father forgive they
[1:32:34] don't know what they're doing
[1:32:36] it needs to be just the opposite of
[1:32:38] offense that's your brother that's your
[1:32:40] sister you got to grab him you got to
[1:32:41] get him
[1:32:42] you got to help him
[1:32:45] verse 2 it were better for him that a
[1:32:49] millstone were hanged around his neck
[1:32:51] and he was cast into the sea that he
[1:32:53] should offend
[1:32:54] one of these little ones
[1:32:58] never let your witnessing be an offense
[1:33:00] never
[1:33:02] luke chapter 9 verse 49
[1:33:05] and you will allow me just to go a
[1:33:07] little bit later
[1:33:08] thank you you know that permission i'm
[1:33:11] being honest
[1:33:12] it helps me it takes pressure off of me
[1:33:15] because i don't
[1:33:16] never ever
[1:33:20] want to talk to talk
[1:33:23] hold people up for nothing but it's so
[1:33:26] bad
[1:33:27] i mean this question to me was well
[1:33:30] spoken in sincerity they if it was
[1:33:32] they could have just said how can i be a
[1:33:34] better witness
[1:33:36] but the way this question was written
[1:33:38] there was so much harden to it
[1:33:41] and deserves the very best answer
[1:33:44] amen
[1:33:48] give giving no off oh where am i at i'm
[1:33:51] so sorry
[1:33:51] luke chapter 4 verse 49 thank you and
[1:33:54] john answered and said master
[1:33:57] we saw one casting out devils in thy
[1:34:00] name
[1:34:01] and we forbade him because he wouldn't
[1:34:04] follow
[1:34:05] us and jesus said unto him
[1:34:08] forbid him not for he that is not
[1:34:11] against us
[1:34:12] is for us jesus could see
[1:34:16] something just because they weren't
[1:34:18] willing to walk with him jesus could see
[1:34:20] that it wasn't against him
[1:34:22] and it came to pass when the time was
[1:34:25] come that he should be received up
[1:34:27] he steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:34:29] jerusalem
[1:34:31] and he sent messengers before his face
[1:34:33] and they went and headed into a village
[1:34:35] of the samaritans
[1:34:37] to make ready for him and they didn't
[1:34:40] receive him
[1:34:41] because he set his face to go to
[1:34:43] jerusalem and
[1:34:44] the samaritans didn't have no part with
[1:34:47] jerusalem at least that's what the woman
[1:34:49] at the well said
[1:34:52] and when his disciples james and john
[1:34:55] saw this they said lord
[1:34:57] we've got to straighten this thing out
[1:35:00] well thou
[1:35:01] that we command fire to come down from
[1:35:03] heaven and just
[1:35:04] consume them and we got an example in
[1:35:07] the bible elias did it
[1:35:11] and he turned and he rebuked them and he
[1:35:14] said
[1:35:15] you know not what manner of spirit
[1:35:18] you are of for the son of man
[1:35:21] is not come to destroy men's lives
[1:35:25] but to save them
[1:35:28] and yeah they went to another village
[1:35:30] notice this here's jesus
[1:35:32] sends into this village doesn't work got
[1:35:34] to go to another village
[1:35:35] but what happened sounded like it was in
[1:35:37] vain got on the wrong track
[1:35:39] something went wrong but you know what
[1:35:42] jesus was teaching them
[1:35:45] so when things don't seem to be going
[1:35:46] right jesus is teaching
[1:35:49] jesus is teaching not in vain
[1:35:52] not in vain what we go through all for
[1:35:56] a purpose
[1:36:01] the disciples needed to be an undeniable
[1:36:04] witness for christ
[1:36:06] a lot of times we we think we're doing
[1:36:09] god a service by trying to set
[1:36:13] things straight we're trying to prove
[1:36:16] what's right what's wrong
[1:36:20] but don't be offensive giving no offense
[1:36:24] in
[1:36:24] anything that the ministry be not blamed
[1:36:28] we are set
[1:36:28] to the defense of the gospel until we're
[1:36:30] out of here amen
[1:36:32] somehow when people see you they
[1:36:35] and god does reveal to them that they
[1:36:37] were wrong
[1:36:38] they got to know who to grab onto
[1:36:41] but if they see that you were being
[1:36:44] offensive towards them
[1:36:46] they're going to be too scared to grab
[1:36:48] on
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:51] the scriptures teach us and furnishes
[1:36:54] how
[1:36:54] to handle wrong situations some dad like
[1:36:57] to do a service on that
[1:37:01] second corinthians chapter 6 verse 4.
[1:37:04] let's look at these scriptures second
[1:37:06] corinthians chapter six verse four
[1:37:08] so giving no offense that the ministry
[1:37:10] be not blamed verse three verse four
[1:37:11] says but
[1:37:12] in all things approving ourselves as the
[1:37:15] ministers of god now how do we do that
[1:37:18] did i just tell them i belong to send
[1:37:20] the light church and i believe in the
[1:37:21] ministry they're they're they're into
[1:37:23] missions they
[1:37:24] they they they do this they no
[1:37:28] you don't approve yourself with that but
[1:37:30] you do it in much
[1:37:32] patience this is how you prove
[1:37:35] your ministry in patience
[1:37:39] in afflictions in necessities
[1:37:43] in distresses in stripes
[1:37:46] imprisonments and turmoils in labors in
[1:37:49] watchings
[1:37:49] in in fast you know none of this has
[1:37:52] offense to it
[1:37:55] you're standing for the defense of the
[1:37:57] gospel you're you're handling things the
[1:37:59] way christ handles them
[1:38:01] we prove ourselves through our
[1:38:04] sufferings all these are sufferings
[1:38:08] who wants to suffer nobody
[1:38:12] that's why it's hard for us to be more
[1:38:15] effective than what
[1:38:16] we are when we realize that we got to do
[1:38:18] more give more
[1:38:19] then we'll be there we'll be more of a
[1:38:22] witness
[1:38:27] i have someone i've shared with uh
[1:38:31] a number of times and probably wouldn't
[1:38:34] mind me saying
[1:38:35] it's my my son who i'm trying to
[1:38:39] raise to run the company right and he
[1:38:42] deals with people
[1:38:44] and it's hard to deal with people
[1:38:48] why because people want to do their own
[1:38:51] thing
[1:38:53] they want to tell you you're right
[1:38:55] they're right
[1:38:58] and it becomes difficult to navigate
[1:39:02] around any kind of negativity with a
[1:39:05] person
[1:39:09] but we i in all the times that we've
[1:39:12] spent time
[1:39:13] helping him with this we're following
[1:39:16] this
[1:39:17] what we're reading right here yes
[1:39:20] and he's always concluded if things are
[1:39:23] going to get better
[1:39:24] it's because i am going to have to be
[1:39:26] better
[1:39:28] i'm going to have to suffer long i'm
[1:39:29] going to have to be patient i'm going to
[1:39:31] have to lay down my life i'm going to
[1:39:33] have to
[1:39:34] and it'll be good for a few days and
[1:39:37] then we'll spend time changing it again
[1:39:39] but he has said more times
[1:39:43] come right back to it we need a
[1:39:44] revelation of this
[1:39:49] we approve ourselves through our
[1:39:52] sufferings
[1:39:57] through manifesting the true love of god
[1:40:00] that should have brought in our heart by
[1:40:01] the holy ghost
[1:40:02] not by calling down any kind of fire on
[1:40:06] somebody verse
[1:40:08] six how do we do it we do it by pureness
[1:40:13] we do it by knowledge we do it by
[1:40:16] longsuffering
[1:40:18] we do it by kindness we do it by the
[1:40:21] holy ghost he knows how to do it
[1:40:24] by love unfeigned
[1:40:27] by the word of truth notice by the power
[1:40:31] of god not by the power of john martin
[1:40:34] john martin can't do anything right
[1:40:39] there should we it should have been
[1:40:40] anonymous amen on that one
[1:40:45] seriously we need the power of god amen
[1:40:48] by the armor of righteousness on the
[1:40:50] right hand on the left by honor and
[1:40:51] dishonored by evil report by good report
[1:40:53] by his deceiver is it true so i'll say
[1:40:55] no matter what situation you're in
[1:40:57] whether you're being honored or
[1:40:59] dishonored whether you're being an evil
[1:41:00] port at you
[1:41:01] or a good report you can have an
[1:41:04] undeniable witness
[1:41:06] for christ
[1:41:09] as unknown yet
[1:41:14] well known as dying
[1:41:18] your flesh your your old nature and
[1:41:21] behold we live as
[1:41:22] chastened but we're not killed it's just
[1:41:26] god teaching us
[1:41:27] amen as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[1:41:31] as poor yet making ready many rich
[1:41:35] don't you love giving to people
[1:41:38] who don't have what you have and you
[1:41:40] have the treasures
[1:41:43] of christ inside of you amen you have
[1:41:45] the riches of christ inside of you
[1:41:47] and when you give them out you make
[1:41:49] people rich
[1:41:51] as having nothing yet you possess all
[1:41:54] things because you got christ amen
[1:41:57] so just closing now i'm closing
[1:42:03] how to be an undeniable witness for
[1:42:05] christ that the world sees me
[1:42:07] no more and that they would see
[1:42:11] christ only always
[1:42:15] well one thing we haven't talked much on
[1:42:17] but it sums it up in one word
[1:42:21] stay humble
[1:42:25] let your focus be on denying yourself
[1:42:28] because if you can get rid of yourself
[1:42:31] people are only going to see christ
[1:42:32] because that's all that's left over
[1:42:36] remain crucified
[1:42:40] daily that christ may live
[1:42:43] fall more in love with jesus we're set
[1:42:47] to the defense of the gospel
[1:42:48] not the offense by this shall all men
[1:42:51] know that you're my disciples
[1:42:53] yes by this type of love where you can
[1:42:56] love the unlovable
[1:42:57] right right that you lay down your life
[1:42:59] and you're not getting anything out of
[1:43:00] it
[1:43:02] you ever give up your time and don't get
[1:43:04] anything out of it
[1:43:06] that's the the marks of a christian
[1:43:10] it's truly the marks of a christian you
[1:43:12] don't have to get anything out of the
[1:43:14] deal
[1:43:16] you give of yourself that's christ in
