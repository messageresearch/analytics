[37:27] shall spring forth shall ye not know it
[37:30] I will even make a way in the wilderness
[37:34] and rivers in the desert amen God bless
[37:37] you you may be
[37:40] seated well before we get going in this
[37:42] message I just want to say Happy New
[37:43] Year to

[37:48] each of you a a happy and prosperous
[37:51] year as you as you trust the Lord the
[37:54] world has very
[37:55] little uh to be happy
[37:58] about and there's very little things
[38:01] that actually make them happy uh we have
[38:05] uh had an unpredictable deadly virus
[38:08] that has caused the economy to uh be
[38:13] crippled as you know numerous shutdowns
[38:16] separations from our family and our
[38:19] friends unwanted mask and really unknown
[38:22] vaccines what's going to
[38:24] happen evil people are taking advantage
[38:27] to the
[38:30] situation uh trying to destroy our
[38:32] democracy and our
[38:34] freedom just not caring about
[38:37] people the world is wanting a better
[38:40] year a happier year they're constantly
[38:43] feeding on bad
[38:47] news which makes it impossible to be
[38:51] happy but to the bride I want to say God
[38:54] bless
[38:55] you and keep pressing into God's
[38:59] presence keep pressing in keep feeding
[39:02] on the
[39:04] word keep
[39:06] praying it'll make you happy despite
[39:10] everything that's happening around you
[39:11] in the
[39:13] world happiness isn't depending on the
[39:16] world's situation the world's condition
[39:19] our our happiness is in the Lord amen
[39:23] Proverbs 16 verse2 says who so trusteth
[39:25] in the Lord happy is
[39:29] he just from trusting in the Lord when
[39:33] the Queen of Sheba finally got to the
[39:35] presence of King Solomon she said in
[39:37] First Kings chapter 10:8 happy are thy
[39:40] men happy are thy servants which stand
[39:43] continually before thee and hear thy
[39:47] wisdom so I say stay in the presence of
[39:50] your king and listen to the word it will
[39:53] keep you
[39:54] happy amen it will Pros ER you
[39:58] amen third John verse one uh chapter
[40:02] 1 uh and and verse two says beloved I
[40:07] wish above all things that thou mayest
[40:09] prosper and be in health even as thy
[40:13] Soul
[40:14] prosperous so God bless us with a
[40:17] prosperous and new
[40:19] year but we're not looking at it as the
[40:22] world says happy New Year amen we're
[40:24] looking in it in in in God's world in
[40:27] God's economy in God's word
[40:30] amen because
[40:32] that's that's all that
[40:37] matters last Sunday we learned about the
[40:40] necessity of forgetting our
[40:42] past remember ye not the former things
[40:45] neither consider the things of
[40:49] old and though there are things that God
[40:52] always wants us to remember there are
[40:54] four things that we talked about that we
[40:55] need to practice forgiv
[40:58] we need to remember not our former
[41:01] sins nor the sins of our brothers and
[41:04] sisters God doesn't want us talking
[41:06] about The Malt that's in our brother's
[41:08] eye amen neither does God want us to
[41:10] consider our old achievements as as
[41:13] something special we need to
[41:15] share Luke 17:10 Jesus said so likewise
[41:20] ye when you have done all those things
[41:22] which are commanded you say we are unpr
[41:27] profitable servants we have done that
[41:29] which is our duty to do so that's God's
[41:32] attitude that that uh uh how he views
[41:35] our achievements right right and finally
[41:38] if we don't learn to have a short memory
[41:41] with our sufferings we're not going to
[41:43] be able to do very much for the Lord
[41:45] we're not going to be able to uh lay
[41:47] down our lives for the
[41:48] Brethren when Timothy feared being a
[41:51] partaker of the afflictions of the
[41:53] gospel of Christ Paul made it real clear
[41:55] that all of us that live Godly in Christ
[41:57] Jesus are going to suffer persecutions
[42:00] and it'll be the same for you and I so
[42:03] we need to have a a short memory like
[42:06] Paul did of our sufferings Paul told
[42:09] Timothy I suffer trouble as an
[42:12] evildoer and in 2 Timothy chapter 2:10
[42:15] he says therefore I Endure All Things
[42:18] Not For my sake but for the elect sake
[42:22] that they may also obtain salvation
[42:25] which is in Christ Jesus with eternal
[42:27] Glory so practice maintaining a short
[42:31] memory about sufferings that you have to
[42:34] go through for the cause of
[42:36] Christ Our adversary has many snares
[42:39] waiting
[42:40] us when our minds are dwelling in the
[42:47] past the first step to move forward in
[42:50] Christ is forgetting the past amen
[42:53] Brethren I count not myself to have
[42:55] apprehended but this one thing I do so
[42:59] we want to practice this forgetting
[43:01] those things which are behind reaching
[43:04] forth unto those things which are before
[43:07] us Brethren I count not my S to have
[43:16] apprehended so I don't know where you
[43:18] feel you're at with your in your walk
[43:20] with Christ but I'm not
[43:23] there I don't have the the mindset I'm
[43:26] there well brother John didn't you get
[43:27] baptized didn't you didn't you receive
[43:30] the Holy Spirit didn't I have not
[43:34] attained I don't know your view of me
[43:37] but it better not be more than what it
[43:44] is I just know I'm not
[43:47] there I got a revelation I'm not there I
[43:51] got a revelation I got a ways to go I
[43:54] got a revelation I got a long ways to go
[43:58] and these thoughts help me to press
[44:00] in I press towards the mark for the
[44:03] prize of the High Calling of God in
[44:05] Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as
[44:09] be
[44:09] perfect be thus minded so this is the
[44:13] perfect
[44:14] mindset to have when you realize you're
[44:18] not there and you got to press in and if
[44:22] and if in anything you be otherwise
[44:25] minded God's going to show you what you
[44:28] need to
[44:29] do I just love that remember ye not the
[44:32] former things neither consider the
[44:35] things of old God wants us focusing on
[44:39] our
[44:40] future behold I will do a new thing God
[44:44] said I not the government that's right
[44:49] not the doctors right God is going to do
[44:52] a new thing now it shall spring forth
[44:56] shall you not know it I will make a way
[44:59] in the wilderness and rivers in the
[45:01] desert I'd like to entitle the message
[45:04] this morning the creator of our
[45:07] future and for a subject
[45:10] aligning ourself up with God's
[45:13] expectation because it's a must if we're
[45:15] going to go anywhere with
[45:18] God a lot of the times our minds end up
[45:21] on a dead Ed
[45:22] Street thinking that things are never
[45:25] going to change in our situation right
[45:28] but God said I would do a new thing so
[45:32] we've got to line ourselves up with
[45:35] God's
[45:36] expectation we may not all know what God
[45:39] has in store for us but we do know that
[45:42] all things are going to work together
[45:44] for the good amen to them that love God
[45:47] and to them that are called to the same
[45:49] purpose that God has amen the purpose of
[45:54] God that's what's important if those two
[45:55] things are transpiring in your life you
[45:57] can anchor that all things are going to
[46:00] work together for the good so we need to
[46:02] align ourselves up with that expectation
[46:05] and all the wonderful things that God
[46:07] has ahead for his bride and we are his
[46:10] bride amen Jeremiah CH 29:1 well-known
[46:13] scripture for I know the thoughts that I
[46:16] think towards you sayeth the Lord
[46:18] thoughts of
[46:20] peace and not of evil Jes when I think
[46:25] about this virus and what is done to the
[46:27] world I think it's evil to the
[46:31] core but God's thoughts are thoughts of
[46:34] Peace not of evil to give you an
[46:38] expected
[46:40] end when we think about what's going on
[46:42] in the world it just drags us
[46:45] down the world has nothing to offer us
[46:50] but when we think of another kingdom
[46:51] when we when we realize that we need to
[46:54] set our affections on things above amen
[46:57] that we need to be seated our thoughts
[46:59] need to be seated in Heavenly places
[47:01] with Christ Jesus we need to align our
[47:04] thoughts with the thoughts of Peace not
[47:06] of evil we need to align our thoughts
[47:09] with an expected end not a a a dead end
[47:12] rolled that's right amen he promised to
[47:15] do a new thing to make a way where there
[47:17] seems to be no way he is the creator of
[47:21] our future amen Isaiah 58:8 for my
[47:26] thoughts are not your
[47:27] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[47:30] sayeth the
[47:31] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[47:34] the earth so are my ways higher than
[47:36] your ways and my thoughts than your
[47:39] thoughts in other words our thoughts are
[47:41] limited to human reasoning they're
[47:44] affected by what we see going around in
[47:46] the world that's around us and as soon
[47:49] as we depend on our thoughts we limit
[47:52] our future with
[47:54] God that's right where is God's thoughts
[47:57] are not limited by human reasoning by
[48:00] intellect by by Common Sense or by
[48:03] what's going on in the world God's
[48:05] thoughts are merely the are are not
[48:08] thoughts of just
[48:12] hope I hope something
[48:15] happens God's thoughts are not filled
[48:17] with
[48:21] question God's thoughts are yay and amen
[48:25] God's thoughts have an expected in God's
[48:28] word does not return void it will
[48:31] accomplish that which it set out to
[48:34] do Prophet taught us that a word is
[48:37] simply a thought
[48:39] expressed God's thoughts became
[48:41] expressed through his word so that the
[48:43] things which are seen were really made
[48:46] by things which do not appear the Bible
[48:48] tells
[48:49] us so I want when I think when you think
[48:52] about your future changing you must
[48:54] realize that it's going to happen from
[48:56] something that's
[49:00] unseen not from what you see not from
[49:03] what you
[49:04] hear that's right naturally we don't
[49:08] care what's going to happen to the world
[49:10] we don't care when the thing is going to
[49:11] blow
[49:14] up well brother John I want to do this
[49:16] and I I did
[49:19] too but how can you compare that with
[49:22] what God has for you
[49:25] anyways Isa Isaiah 5511 so shall my word
[49:29] be that go forth out of my mouth it
[49:31] shall not return unto me void it but it
[49:33] shall accomplish that which I please and
[49:36] it shall prosper in a thing where to i s
[49:39] I say today that God's word is being
[49:45] ministered yes there are words being
[49:47] spoken out of a human
[49:49] mouth and so it is for the five-fold
[49:52] ministry but if you can believe that God
[49:55] is speaking from his mouth to your
[49:58] heart that word will prosper the place
[50:03] that he sends it and he's sending his
[50:05] word into our hearts
[50:08] today God's thoughts are expressed from
[50:11] his
[50:12] mouth and it creates our
[50:16] future they have never failed one
[50:20] time our Fate's final resting place is
[50:25] not in World Peace
[50:28] it's not in the economy it's not in a a
[50:31] a world vaccine that is right our
[50:35] Faith's final resting place is in the
[50:37] word of God that it will come to pass
[50:40] and that's why we need to come to church
[50:42] with a higher
[50:44] expectation you know we get so excited
[50:46] about what the what the new news is
[50:48] going to be saying people are searching
[50:50] for hope that's why they look to the
[50:53] news the truth brother we need to get in
[50:55] the good news
[50:58] it's all that
[51:00] matters you ever wonder why the prophet
[51:02] never talked about this and this and
[51:04] this and this and
[51:05] this you know what I'm talking
[51:10] about that's
[51:12] right we want to know about
[51:15] it but we don't need to know about it we
[51:18] need to focus on what God wants us to
[51:21] focus
[51:22] on Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[51:26] God's word will never pass
[51:28] away the thoughts that the devil has
[51:30] towards us are evil tormenting thoughts
[51:34] filled with fear true leaving us with
[51:37] anxiety and hopelessness that's right
[51:41] there's no use of pressing
[51:44] in you know too many people are
[51:48] waiting for something to
[51:51] change before they start trying harder
[51:54] to press into Christ amen that is the
[51:57] saddest
[51:58] thing you need a
[52:02] vision if we listen to those thoughts
[52:04] we'll begin to believe them and then act
[52:08] like we believe
[52:10] them but God's thoughts towards us are
[52:13] beautiful they're lovely they're pure
[52:16] they're just they're holy the thoughts
[52:19] that God has towards us are a good
[52:21] report amen there are powerful creative
[52:25] thoughts there merciful thoughts they're
[52:27] gracious thoughts they're patient
[52:30] thoughts amen these thoughts create new
[52:33] life in US New Hope in us a a new nature
[52:36] in us a better life a a better nature
[52:40] am for I know the thoughts I think
[52:42] toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of
[52:44] Peace not of evil to give you an
[52:47] expected end the question today is do
[52:49] you know the thoughts that God has
[52:51] toward you
[52:54] today God has plans to car out his
[52:57] thoughts toward you for your
[53:01] future but you need to know the thoughts
[53:04] that God has toward you so you can have
[53:06] the expectation that God wants you to
[53:10] have because without faith it's
[53:13] impossible to please the Lord amen so
[53:15] just ask God to show you your future
[53:18] right that's good amen take some time to
[53:22] get involved with the thoughts that he
[53:24] has towards you the Ed and that he has
[53:27] for you God is in the creation
[53:32] business he loves to
[53:35] create remember the
[53:38] first oh like first six days he
[53:42] created everything
[53:45] right
[53:48] and the last two days he created uh the
[53:54] life in animals
[54:01] and I did not realize how many things
[54:05] God
[54:08] created when you read Genesis you're
[54:10] just kind of like okay so he created
[54:12] animals creeping things things in the
[54:15] water fishes that's a that's
[54:22] done so I got some information about how
[54:25] many things things that we have to
[54:28] identify today which we know all
[54:30] creation came from
[54:32] God there are
[54:36] 5,500 different
[54:41] mammals yeah and of course the many many
[54:44] that have probably gone extinct you know

[56:15] never heard of archin muus crans
[56:21] enums I really need Cheryl or brother
[56:24] Marty or somebody to read this
[56:27] but you add all those up and there's
[56:30] over 6
[56:32] million
[56:34] 7,000 different
[56:39] species now the
[56:42] plants oh
[56:45] my there's nearly
[56:49] 400 thousand different
[56:52] plants kind of what caught my attention
[56:55] for this is when I was looking on the
[56:57] Weather Channel one of the you know they
[56:58] got different little videos that come up
[57:02] on the Weather Channel there and one of
[57:03] them happened to be a plant that there
[57:06] was only one in existence anywhere in
[57:09] the world only one it was on a island of
[57:12] Hawaii so you've seen that thought wow
[57:16] and how many more were
[57:18] there
[57:20] before but to think that our
[57:24] creator his character
[57:27] his makeup to go ahead and create all
[57:30] these different flowers and all this
[57:32] different type of
[57:34] life he is awesome amen How Great Is Our
[57:38] God his ability to create
[57:44] things amen he's worthy amen he's
[57:48] [Applause]
[57:51] worthy over 7 million species of plants
[57:55] and animals live live on planet Earth
[57:58] according to the best estimates made by
[58:00] biologists 7 million species now that's
[58:04] not a total of seven million of one
[58:06] that's seven million different
[58:09] things if I asked you to come up with uh
[58:13] a a a plan to to do something and I want
[58:18] you to come up with seven you know
[58:20] million different ways you may be able
[58:22] to come up with three or
[58:24] four our God has got creative
[58:29] abilities he said if you add in the
[58:32] world's species that aren't plants or
[58:35] animals such as uh leeons mushrooms and
[58:40] bacteria the total number of species
[58:42] leap much higher telling the estimate of
[58:45] all living things bringing the number to
[58:49] 11.3 million different species
[58:59] I think God has some good things in
[59:00] store for
[59:02] us God is in the creation business and
[59:06] he loves to create we know that when God
[59:10] created everything he created them
[59:15] perfectly he he said that at the end of
[59:19] everything that he created all the
[59:20] different forms and the animals and the
[59:22] lights and everything that he did the
[59:24] Bible says that God saw that it was good
[59:28] so what he does is good
[59:31] am now it's no different about Lucifer
[59:35] when he created Lucifer it was
[59:38] good the Bible says that he was perfect
[59:41] in all his ways he was
[59:44] beautiful
[59:46] until right until Freemore
[59:50] agency went the wrong direction now I
[59:53] want to say this about you because we've
[59:55] all been given the same same thing free
[59:57] more agency the same thing Lucifer
[1:00:01] had the free more agency is a beautiful
[1:00:04] power that God has given to all of
[1:00:07] us but that power without the character
[1:00:09] to use it only for
[1:00:12] God is
[1:00:14] satanic it will lead us to destruction
[1:00:17] Lucifer took that awesome power of free
[1:00:20] moral agency and he began to pervert the
[1:00:24] other things that God had
[1:00:28] created just because God has given you
[1:00:31] free more agency that doesn't mean that
[1:00:33] God's going to okay you no matter what
[1:00:35] decision you
[1:00:42] do every time we use our free more
[1:00:44] Agency for our will we will pervert
[1:00:48] something but every time we use it to
[1:00:50] carry out God's will it will create a
[1:00:53] better life because that's what it's for
[1:00:56] a good example of that is when uh God
[1:00:58] has given us the the chance to live for
[1:01:00] oursel or to live for
[1:01:04] somebody and he told us if you you seek
[1:01:07] to save yourself and your life's going
[1:01:09] to be always consumed about you you're
[1:01:11] going to
[1:01:13] lose but if you lay down your life for
[1:01:16] the
[1:01:20] Brethren you're going to be blessed
[1:01:26] Peter asked Jesus why are you washing my
[1:01:29] feet you're my Lord You're my master and
[1:01:32] Jesus answered and said in John 13:7
[1:01:36] what I do thou knowest not but Thou
[1:01:38] shalt know
[1:01:41] Hereafter Jesus was showing them not
[1:01:44] only how he was going to create a better
[1:01:46] future a better life a better nature but
[1:01:49] he was also teaching them that one day
[1:01:51] they're going to get filled with the
[1:01:52] Holy Ghost and they're going to be part
[1:01:54] of this creation process of helping
[1:01:56] bring life to others because that's what
[1:01:59] Jesus was really doing when you get
[1:02:02] cleaned up when you ask God to forgive
[1:02:04] you of your sins to wash you to cleanse
[1:02:06] you to S what are you doing God is
[1:02:09] creating a healthier
[1:02:13] you he's sanctifying your
[1:02:16] life and if we backslide then we need to
[1:02:20] be cleansed and washed every day to
[1:02:22] bring forth New Life John 13:3
[1:02:27] John 13:13 Jesus said you call me master
[1:02:30] and Lord and you say well for so I am if
[1:02:33] I then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:02:36] your feet you you also ought to wash one
[1:02:38] another's
[1:02:39] feet for I've given you an example that
[1:02:42] you should do as I have done to you now
[1:02:45] look at this statement verily verely I
[1:02:47] say to you the servant is not greater
[1:02:49] than his Lord neither is he that greater
[1:02:52] uh neither is he sent greater than he
[1:02:55] that sent sent
[1:02:56] him in other words just because God has
[1:03:00] blessed you washed you Sanctified you
[1:03:04] filled you with the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:03:06] mean you're too good true that you don't
[1:03:10] have to go help
[1:03:12] somebody that's what that
[1:03:16] means we need to do our
[1:03:19] job for I've given you an example that
[1:03:22] you should do as I've done to you verse
[1:03:25] 17 if you know these things happy are ye
[1:03:29] if you do them so I say Happy New Year
[1:03:31] you want a happy New Year right
[1:03:34] here do this wash somebody's feet well
[1:03:37] brother John I'm just you know I'm not
[1:03:38] doing anything like that until this Co
[1:03:40] is done we're not talking about
[1:03:43] literally washing somebody's feet now
[1:03:45] we're talking about having a burden for
[1:03:46] somebody to see their soul
[1:03:48] saved that's right that's it somehow
[1:03:51] getting sin washed out of their life
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:56] Jesus what was he doing here he's
[1:03:58] wanting to realign his disciples
[1:04:01] Thoughts with eternal Thoughts with an
[1:04:03] expected
[1:04:05] end Jesus wanted his disciples to learn
[1:04:08] how to serve one another because their
[1:04:10] own thoughts was they wanted to be
[1:04:14] served and if we're not careful we know
[1:04:17] this no matter how much Holy Ghost you
[1:04:19] got that's right right that old nature
[1:04:21] wants to keep creeping
[1:04:24] in and wants to make sure that it's
[1:04:27] doing everything it can to get served a
[1:04:29] little bit
[1:04:31] more John Chapter 13 dropping down to
[1:04:34] verse 34 a new commandment I give unto
[1:04:37] you that you love one another as I have
[1:04:39] loved you that you also love one another
[1:04:43] he was wanting to
[1:04:45] Reign his disciples
[1:04:48] Thoughts with thinking the way that God
[1:04:51] thinks and by this shall all men know
[1:04:55] that your my disciples if you have love
[1:04:58] one for another now we know this before
[1:05:02] we became Christians all we had to do
[1:05:04] was look at our family and we saw that
[1:05:08] somebody was not loving
[1:05:14] everybody that's normal that's called
[1:05:17] normality where everybody just picks and
[1:05:19] chooses who they're going to
[1:05:22] love and when you come to Christ when
[1:05:25] you really really really really come to
[1:05:31] Christ all men will know you're a
[1:05:34] different
[1:05:35] breed when you don't love like you used
[1:05:38] to
[1:05:40] love you love unconditionally everyone
[1:05:44] all the
[1:05:46] time Nelson Millard said no I don't know
[1:05:50] who he is so don't
[1:05:51] ask but he said you'll never influence
[1:05:54] the World by being like it
[1:06:01] well I I love with respect to persons
[1:06:04] but I'm gonna try to influence this
[1:06:08] person Greg Grell said if you're willing
[1:06:13] to do what others won't do you'll have
[1:06:17] influence that others don't
[1:06:20] have so you want to be to influence
[1:06:22] somebody a little bit more learn to lay
[1:06:24] down your life
[1:06:27] right because most people aren't willing
[1:06:29] to do
[1:06:35] that Jesus was wanting
[1:06:41] them to take their old way of thinking
[1:06:44] that they would never be able to
[1:06:47] influence the world with that's why he
[1:06:50] said you just wait till you be ued with
[1:06:53] power from on high then you'll be a
[1:06:55] proper witness he was wanting to realign
[1:06:59] their thoughts their way of thinking so
[1:07:01] they would be able to help create new
[1:07:04] life in
[1:07:06] people amen don't miss what I'm saying
[1:07:09] it was the creator inside those
[1:07:11] disciples bringing the words of
[1:07:14] Life Peter said where can we go thou
[1:07:16] alone has the words of eternal life but
[1:07:19] Jesus said whatever you bind on Earth
[1:07:21] I'll bind in heaven in other words they
[1:07:23] were holding the words of life
[1:07:26] Amen to create a better
[1:07:29] future God is in the creating
[1:07:33] business and he likes taking things that
[1:07:36] are
[1:07:38] perverted without form and and void of
[1:07:42] understanding he likes to take these
[1:07:44] things and bring a beautiful life to
[1:07:47] create a beautiful life if you just look
[1:07:49] every one of us you know we we know
[1:07:52] we're not perfect right now but I'll
[1:07:54] tell you what we were a lot wor shap
[1:07:55] before we came to the
[1:07:57] Lord every one of us could stand and
[1:07:59] testify by the grace of God I'm not what
[1:08:02] I used to
[1:08:05] be amen I'd rather be here with all my
[1:08:09] problems brother Larry with all my
[1:08:11] mistakes with all my shortcomings to be
[1:08:14] than to be back
[1:08:21] there God loves creating a perfect
[1:08:24] creation from imperfect people or
[1:08:27] perverted
[1:08:29] situations he's okay with that don't be
[1:08:33] bothered by that it should give us
[1:08:37] hope we see God recreating things in the
[1:08:40] way that he wanted to from the beginning
[1:08:42] and what I mean by that
[1:08:44] is he he's he wants to recreate things
[1:08:48] that have been perverted good example of
[1:08:50] this is in Genesis 1 verse number one in
[1:08:52] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[1:08:55] the the Earth in Isaiah chapter 65
[1:08:59] Isaiah 65:1 17 for behold I create a new
[1:09:05] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[1:09:09] shall be re not be remembered nor come
[1:09:13] into
[1:09:15] mind I love that let's get rid of this
[1:09:19] foral negative thinking that's in our
[1:09:23] mind God wants to create our minds the
[1:09:26] way that it should be
[1:09:29] amen God not only has the ability to
[1:09:32] take an earth that is without form and
[1:09:35] void and create things that are good
[1:09:37] like we learned in Genesis but he also
[1:09:39] has the power to take a human life
[1:09:41] that's with a perverted nature and
[1:09:43] without a form of godliness and void of
[1:09:46] spiritual life and create Sons and
[1:09:49] Daughters out of it that's the ability
[1:09:52] that God has with his creating power
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:56] to be in His
[1:09:59] image we just need to align our thoughts
[1:10:02] up with God's higher expectations of us
[1:10:06] he doesn't want us to wallow around down
[1:10:08] here in some doomsday mentality with our
[1:10:13] economy he wants us pressing towards the
[1:10:16] mark of Christ realigning our thoughts
[1:10:19] with what God really has in store for
[1:10:22] us Romans 8: 29 for whom he did
[1:10:27] Forno he also did
[1:10:29] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:10:32] image of this his son that he might be
[1:10:36] the firstborn among many Brethren now we
[1:10:40] know this is a promise of God but how
[1:10:44] many uh have this expectation in their
[1:10:47] heart through the course of the
[1:10:50] week or do we just think that this is
[1:10:53] something that happens after we die
[1:10:59] now we need to be pressing
[1:11:03] in to this
[1:11:07] Mark and I'll say you'll do a lot better
[1:11:10] job if you stay out of the world
[1:11:17] news you'll just do a better
[1:11:21] job how does it all start how do we
[1:11:24] start this process brother John it
[1:11:27] doesn't matter if you just came to the
[1:11:31] Lord or if you've been serving the lord
[1:11:34] for a long time it all starts with
[1:11:37] aligning your thoughts back up with the
[1:11:39] word of God the word is our lamp amen it
[1:11:44] shows
[1:11:45] us who we are who God is what he
[1:11:49] thinks it's all in the
[1:11:51] word if I listen to somebody who tries
[1:11:54] to interpr this word you know what most
[1:11:58] of the time it confuses
[1:12:01] me well this is what God show me this is
[1:12:03] what god well that's good for you right
[1:12:06] and every one of us need confidence that
[1:12:08] God can speak to us that God can reveal
[1:12:11] it is God that builds this church amen
[1:12:14] there's no other man between God and man
[1:12:16] no other mediator no one sitting there
[1:12:19] in
[1:12:21] between now we God give us a five-fold
[1:12:24] Ministry and God uses those
[1:12:27] vessels but it still takes God to reveal
[1:12:30] what's being
[1:12:32] spoken too often we get caral we look to
[1:12:36] certain people in the five-fold ministry
[1:12:38] and we begin to think of who we like
[1:12:40] more than others and how they deliver
[1:12:42] the word and how we can accept this from
[1:12:45] them but not this from them because of
[1:12:48] and we miss what it really
[1:12:50] means that's not how God perfects
[1:12:57] we have to come out of the way that we
[1:12:59] think the way the world thinks and enter
[1:13:03] into the mind of
[1:13:05] Christ Romans 12:2 says and be not
[1:13:08] conformed to this world but be ye
[1:13:13] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:13:16] mind that's the only way you can prove
[1:13:18] what is the good and acceptable and
[1:13:19] perfect will of God so you have to come
[1:13:21] out of the way o of the worldly way of
[1:13:24] thinking into the mind of Christ just
[1:13:27] give you an
[1:13:31] example hum's been in a fight the last
[1:13:34] week an
[1:13:37] argument
[1:13:39] okay now if I get naturally if we get in
[1:13:43] in an argument with somebody the the
[1:13:46] person that is always right is
[1:13:50] you regardless of the of the situation
[1:13:54] you're right worse comes to worse you're
[1:13:58] right with your
[1:14:00] intentions but you're
[1:14:02] right and so what you're going to do is
[1:14:04] you're going to defend your
[1:14:05] right and you're going to prove your
[1:14:07] right and you're going to come from so
[1:14:08] many different
[1:14:10] angles and as a last
[1:14:13] resort uh anger a red face you're going
[1:14:17] to prove
[1:14:19] it but God's way of thinking is a soft
[1:14:23] answer turns away right
[1:14:26] a soft answer it's a different way of
[1:14:28] thinking to create
[1:14:31] life to create peace to create
[1:14:40] Harmony we got to come out of one way of
[1:14:43] thinking into another brother bandam
[1:14:45] said in the message Divine love he says
[1:14:47] because you have to come out of the
[1:14:50] atmosphere you're
[1:14:51] in into this other atmosphere
[1:14:56] when you do that God lifts you right up
[1:15:00] from the world and you live in a
[1:15:04] Heavenly atmosphere
[1:15:05] see and then to the world you're just
[1:15:09] contrary to what that is see and this is
[1:15:13] contrary to that world see now what you
[1:15:16] want to do is be lifted up by Christ
[1:15:20] into an atmosphere to where you're happy
[1:15:27] doesn't sound you know I I think like
[1:15:30] this when you say Happy New
[1:15:31] Year you want to be thinking Lord pick
[1:15:35] them up in your atmosphere pick them up
[1:15:37] in your atmosphere because that's truly
[1:15:40] the only happiness that's going to
[1:15:45] last he
[1:15:47] says to be lifted to lift up by Christ
[1:15:51] into an atmosphere to where you're happy
[1:15:53] and peaceful and then in there you
[1:15:56] create a
[1:15:59] situation we're talking about Christ he
[1:16:03] is the creator of our
[1:16:06] future but now we're many creators amen
[1:16:10] and that we can create situations that
[1:16:13] don't
[1:16:14] exist right brother Bram T us that the
[1:16:17] atmosphere we create will change the
[1:16:19] things that are around us in the message
[1:16:22] jerus and Divine Healing brother Bram
[1:16:24] said now we ought to get ourselves in
[1:16:27] that kind of atmosphere create every one
[1:16:29] of you is a Creator did you know that
[1:16:32] each one of you people that's born again
[1:16:37] is a
[1:16:40] Creator we must create an atmosphere as
[1:16:42] I said the other night now this is
[1:16:44] really really important to understand he
[1:16:47] emphasizes the word here and he says
[1:16:49] born
[1:16:51] again we're creators
[1:16:55] so we don't want to we can't like do
[1:16:57] this in our flesh basically in the
[1:16:59] message I will restore sayith the Lord
[1:17:01] Brother Bram says do you realize that
[1:17:03] your sons that your sons of God the
[1:17:07] atmosphere and the air that you live in
[1:17:09] you create a situation around you it'll
[1:17:11] either draw or push
[1:17:17] away always remember the new things that
[1:17:20] God wants you to do are created from the
[1:17:23] atmosphere
[1:17:25] of your
[1:17:26] expectation that's
[1:17:28] why if you constantly are reading the
[1:17:31] bad news you know what you're going to
[1:17:33] do you're G to publish the bad
[1:17:39] news and if you keep feeding on the good
[1:17:43] news you're going to publish the good
[1:17:49] news brother brandham taught us that we
[1:17:53] need a vision if we're going to create a
[1:17:55] different better
[1:17:58] atmosphere in other words a vision is
[1:18:02] something that is really only seen by
[1:18:05] you nobody else sees it it's invisible
[1:18:10] but it's something that you believe in
[1:18:13] you you see in your heart it don't exist
[1:18:17] right now you're in a
[1:18:20] total uh atmosphere of Anger of fighting
[1:18:24] of Strife of hatred but you have this
[1:18:28] visualization inside of you of Love of
[1:18:31] peace and with that Vision you begin to
[1:18:34] create amen an atmosphere that brings
[1:18:37] about peace and love now that's is just
[1:18:39] as real as real can
[1:18:42] be brother brandom talking about an
[1:18:45] experience that he had in the message
[1:18:47] expectations where his wife was all tore
[1:18:49] out because brother brandom wasn't home
[1:18:52] enough take care of the needs you all
[1:18:54] know the story and brother Braham said
[1:18:55] in this message he said he says now
[1:18:57] don't fuss with her see no he said he
[1:19:02] said say that's right honey see it's
[1:19:05] very bad but you see we're serving the
[1:19:11] lord brother brandom couldn't couldn't
[1:19:14] go against what God's will was for his
[1:19:16] life but he was trying to change the
[1:19:23] atmosphere see what I'm doing all the
[1:19:26] time in my
[1:19:28] heart I'm trying to create a different
[1:19:34] atmosphere they're all nervous and tore
[1:19:37] up see so brother Brandon wasn't trying
[1:19:39] to shove the
[1:19:43] truth he was creating the atmosphere
[1:19:46] here in his heart because if it's here
[1:19:49] it will come out here it will change out
[1:19:53] here if it's here
[1:19:55] well he was a prophet didn't he have
[1:19:56] that wasn't he having
[1:19:59] a that's like you saying I can quote the
[1:20:01] word that's good that you can quote the
[1:20:02] word but can you live the word can the
[1:20:04] word be lived can it be manifested in
[1:20:06] the
[1:20:08] flesh he says now I was thinking in my
[1:20:11] heart oh Lord now send your presence and
[1:20:15] your love to my poor little tore up wife
[1:20:18] and I say Yes dear that's right
[1:20:25] in his heart he was praying he was
[1:20:29] believing in God manifesting right there
[1:20:32] in his
[1:20:34] presence God is real he's the same
[1:20:37] yesterday today and forever he has power
[1:20:40] to work through your life and create a
[1:20:42] better
[1:20:46] future you know being positive in a
[1:20:49] negative situation isn't
[1:20:52] naive it's called leadership right
[1:20:55] somebody has to be the bigger person
[1:20:58] brother Ram says it takes a big man to
[1:21:00] get underneath another
[1:21:02] man brother bam said in the message do
[1:21:04] you now believe he says see that's the
[1:21:07] way it is you just kept believing you
[1:21:10] just keep believing create the
[1:21:11] atmosphere never let doubt come around
[1:21:16] you believe all the time don't accompany
[1:21:19] any of that doubt at all no sir no
[1:21:23] matter what the circumstance s it says
[1:21:25] push away do walk right on through it
[1:21:28] just refuse it yes sir don't give no
[1:21:30] grounds at all to
[1:21:33] it in the message a hidden life in
[1:21:36] Christ brother bam refers to Satan was
[1:21:39] stirring up a bad atmosphere in one of
[1:21:41] his meetings he says remember the the
[1:21:44] night the Maniac Run to the platform to
[1:21:46] kill me up there up here at Portland
[1:21:49] Oregon he says you read the story no
[1:21:51] doubt my it's everywhere what happened
[1:21:54] well that poor fellow he said I didn't
[1:21:58] get angry with
[1:22:01] him I loved
[1:22:03] him now I'm telling you he didn't
[1:22:08] say I had to try to show
[1:22:15] love
[1:22:16] inside brother Rah said inside I'm
[1:22:19] working on the atmosphere
[1:22:22] inside he said I loved him if you love
[1:22:25] in here it'll come out
[1:22:29] here but if it's just a a picture a
[1:22:34] painting you can't get warmed by a
[1:22:37] pictured fire they
[1:22:40] say it's okay to say it's
[1:22:43] missing you got a chance to say Lord
[1:22:46] fill me with you fill me with your love
[1:22:50] fill me with your life fill me with your
[1:22:52] Holy Spirit now you have a chance
[1:22:55] but without
[1:22:58] it and man is very best is all vanity
[1:23:04] right he says in the same message here
[1:23:07] just continuing to read he says and I
[1:23:09] think that's what's the matter with the
[1:23:11] church tonight when people say yes I'm
[1:23:14] born again you know what it is he said
[1:23:18] it's a stillborn dead
[1:23:20] baby it needs a little gospel spanking
[1:23:23] once in a while to wake it up and get it
[1:23:26] to whining and crying and get some life
[1:23:28] into it that's what we need tonight
[1:23:31] that's what the church
[1:23:33] needs and then getting set on the right
[1:23:36] path that's right so I love that the
[1:23:41] prophet said that because if I said that
[1:23:44] there wouldn't be as many
[1:23:46] amens I'm just going to be honest with
[1:23:48] you there wouldn't be but the prophet
[1:23:51] said
[1:23:52] it and God is is always wanting to stir
[1:23:55] us up to get us closer to
[1:23:58] him he says notice now the refreshing
[1:24:01] from the presence of the Lord something
[1:24:03] about them something about a real
[1:24:04] Christian that you love to be around
[1:24:06] don't you and there's a power there you
[1:24:09] create your own atmosphere around you do
[1:24:11] you believe that you sure
[1:24:13] do amen now you know you could go out in
[1:24:17] the world and you could sit in a place
[1:24:20] uh an auditorium where there would be
[1:24:22] somebody on the platform and they would
[1:24:24] would be uh telling the funniest jokes
[1:24:28] and making you laugh and making you feel
[1:24:31] good they could be telling you that
[1:24:33] you're something
[1:24:34] special and that you need to believe in
[1:24:38] yourself and then you need to realize
[1:24:40] that you can you can really make a
[1:24:42] difference if you just believe
[1:24:44] it and you could walk out of there
[1:24:47] feeling
[1:24:49] better feeling like you have a a a some
[1:24:53] sort of power that you didn't have
[1:24:54] before you went in
[1:24:55] there it's the same power that you had a
[1:24:59] month ago that you thought you had that
[1:25:00] you lost that
[1:25:02] you and then you keep going you you keep
[1:25:06] listening to that you keep referring
[1:25:10] back look we need the god inside of
[1:25:14] us the real power is the Holy Ghost you
[1:25:18] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:25:21] has come upon you that's God's word then
[1:25:23] that's God's word today nothing else
[1:25:25] will give us lasting
[1:25:30] power brother brand said in the message
[1:25:34] love he shares that love is the greatest
[1:25:37] Force to change any
[1:25:39] atmosphere Divine love is one of the
[1:25:41] most powerful forces it's one of the
[1:25:44] greatest forces in the world brother
[1:25:46] brand says and when Divine love has been
[1:25:48] projected and come to its end then
[1:25:51] Sovereign Grace will take its place now
[1:25:53] a lot of times
[1:25:55] we use our
[1:25:57] love and when it gets to the end we say
[1:26:01] I'm done I'm done with this I I'm
[1:26:09] it's God's going to have to come now
[1:26:11] because
[1:26:12] I well that's what we needed at the
[1:26:15] beginning was God's
[1:26:16] love and when we project God's love all
[1:26:21] of the love that he has us to project
[1:26:24] not just what we think we all we have to
[1:26:26] do is this but when we project all the
[1:26:30] love that God wants us to
[1:26:33] project when that comes to an end then
[1:26:37] God's grace takes
[1:26:40] over now when Divine love has pro has
[1:26:44] been projected and come to it to its end
[1:26:47] till it can't go no
[1:26:50] further then Sovereign Grace will come
[1:26:53] in and take its
[1:26:57] place can't go any further now do you
[1:27:00] realize being a son or daughter of
[1:27:03] God he says that you are minor you are a
[1:27:07] minor
[1:27:08] Creator do you know you create an
[1:27:11] atmosphere that you live in so if you're
[1:27:13] unhappy think about the atmosphere
[1:27:17] you're creating yes yes you create the
[1:27:21] atmosphere you don't you blame it on me
[1:27:23] right don't you blame it on your spouse
[1:27:25] don't you blame it on your boss don't
[1:27:27] you blame it on your bank account don't
[1:27:29] you blame it on
[1:27:31] anything amen amen did you know you
[1:27:34] create the atmosphere that you live in
[1:27:37] do you realize that the atmosphere that
[1:27:39] you dwell in you
[1:27:41] influence somebody
[1:27:47] else so if you're sad all the time
[1:27:50] you're probably going to make others
[1:27:52] sad if you're Gloom and doom you're
[1:27:55] going to make others gloom and
[1:27:57] doom if you're happy you're going to
[1:28:00] make others happy
[1:28:02] amen now God loves
[1:28:06] us he loves us and he has a vision for
[1:28:10] us he has a a an expectation for
[1:28:15] us when we were in
[1:28:18] sin before the foundation of the world
[1:28:21] he had a vision for us and that Vision
[1:28:25] was Calvary he he manifested that love
[1:28:28] through Calvary and that brought about a
[1:28:31] life for
[1:28:33] us God loves us today right every one of
[1:28:37] us in this
[1:28:39] building he loves us the way we
[1:28:45] are but he does not love our carnal
[1:28:49] fleshly nature he's against it Romans 8
[1:28:53] vers seven because the carnal mind is
[1:28:56] enity against God for it is not subject
[1:28:57] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[1:29:00] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:29:02] cannot please God so we must understand
[1:29:05] that there's a part of us that God
[1:29:07] doesn't
[1:29:10] like hard to come to grips with
[1:29:14] it I'm thankful for the part that he
[1:29:17] does
[1:29:19] like but that part that he does
[1:29:22] like is needs to get surrounded by the
[1:29:26] Holy
[1:29:27] Ghost it needs to be protected and
[1:29:30] sealed by the Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost because if not our carnal fleshly
[1:29:35] nature will try to take
[1:29:38] over that's why Jesus said hey the
[1:29:41] remedy to this is Die
[1:29:43] daily so God loves us the way we are he
[1:29:46] just simply refuses to spend heaven with
[1:29:48] a selfish
[1:29:52] nature if God wasn't willing to spend
[1:29:55] eternity with Lucifer's selfish nature
[1:29:57] why would he be willing to spend
[1:29:59] eternity with our selfish
[1:30:01] nature I'm just trying to get us a good
[1:30:04] understanding that God loves us but he
[1:30:06] doesn't love our selfish
[1:30:08] nature no matter how good a man thinks
[1:30:11] he is he isn't good enough for God right
[1:30:14] Jesus said there is none good but one
[1:30:16] that is
[1:30:19] God Jesus told the religious teacher
[1:30:22] Nicodemus one time at John
[1:30:24] 3:3 verily verily I say unto you except
[1:30:27] a man be born again he cannot see the
[1:30:30] kingdom of
[1:30:31] God he can't enter the kingdom of God
[1:30:34] without a nature change amen all things
[1:30:40] in our nature are
[1:30:43] being if I could say it like this
[1:30:46] recreated into God's
[1:30:49] nature another way of saying it is
[1:30:51] regenerated
[1:30:54] back to what God had at the beginning 2
[1:30:58] Corinthians chapter 5:1 17 well-known
[1:31:00] scripture therefore If any man being in
[1:31:02] Christ he's a new creature old things
[1:31:04] are passed away behold all things are
[1:31:06] become new and all things are of God who
[1:31:09] have reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:31:12] Christ so God took upon the
[1:31:16] responsibility to make new creatures out
[1:31:19] of
[1:31:20] us and he notice here he's not just
[1:31:23] talking talking about salvation at
[1:31:26] Calvary he's talking about taking our
[1:31:29] nature that
[1:31:32] selfish that didn't want anything to do
[1:31:34] with
[1:31:35] God that finally when we said yes Lord I
[1:31:39] want to be
[1:31:41] saved he has something more in in in uh
[1:31:47] in mind for
[1:31:49] us that he wants our whole life to
[1:31:53] become like all of God's life
[1:31:57] am so that's where his expectation is
[1:32:00] and that's where we need to realign our
[1:32:02] expectation we need to be this needs to
[1:32:05] be our goal that all things need to
[1:32:07] become God in our life now we are all
[1:32:10] stuck somewhere in this
[1:32:17] scripture if I was to ask every one of
[1:32:19] you I want you to write a list of the
[1:32:22] things that is not God in your
[1:32:27] life you might say to me brother John
[1:32:31] that's
[1:32:34] offensive you might say that's not why I
[1:32:36] come to
[1:32:39] church you might say that's none of your
[1:32:43] business it it's truly none of my
[1:32:47] business but you need to be
[1:32:51] interested in your business with God
[1:32:56] because this scripture is for
[1:32:58] you somewhere all things need to become
[1:33:02] God don't be satisfied where you're at
[1:33:04] with God that's the worst thing be
[1:33:07] thankful be
[1:33:09] grateful so much that you're in
[1:33:12] debt to press on to changing the other
[1:33:16] things in your
[1:33:20] life God took his creative power went to
[1:33:23] Calvary for
[1:33:25] you came
[1:33:27] back left the Holy Ghost for you and
[1:33:30] it's just here for
[1:33:32] us I I love that because you can't have
[1:33:35] too much Holy
[1:33:37] Ghost what's needed is a greater hunger
[1:33:39] a greater desire not well I'll get it
[1:33:43] when I get
[1:33:44] home I'll spend some time later this
[1:33:48] week and missing what God is really
[1:33:52] speaking to you right now
[1:33:55] when God could be trying to alter get
[1:33:58] you to alter your thinking right now to
[1:34:01] more of his
[1:34:02] thinking maybe this is the minute of
[1:34:05] visitation why would we
[1:34:07] gamble amen that's right amen I want us
[1:34:10] to be encouraged
[1:34:13] today my uh daughter made mention of
[1:34:18] something I said years ago
[1:34:20] that um of course I hardly can't
[1:34:23] remember remember what I said last
[1:34:30] week but every time you come to church
[1:34:32] you have an opportunity to receive more
[1:34:35] of
[1:34:37] God as long as you get out of your mind
[1:34:40] it's got to come this way it's got to be
[1:34:41] this it's got to be that this is what
[1:34:43] I've been praying about this is get all
[1:34:45] that out of your mind yes and be neutral
[1:34:49] that's what brother B say get neutral
[1:34:52] and let God speak to you amen line upon
[1:34:55] line word upon word here a little there
[1:34:58] a little amen when you simply turn your
[1:35:02] heart towards the Lord and give him
[1:35:04] Liberty the Bible says we are changed
[1:35:08] from uh changed into the same image of
[1:35:12] God from Glory onto Glory even as by the
[1:35:17] spirit of the Lord so that's what we're
[1:35:20] looking for when we when we come to
[1:35:22] church amen so hold your confidence
[1:35:25] steadfast in the Lord be confident this
[1:35:29] this very thing that what God is started
[1:35:31] in you he's going to finish it he's
[1:35:33] going to perform it onto the day of
[1:35:35] Jesus Christ can you bear with me a
[1:35:37] little bit since we don't got two
[1:35:41] Services God wants to change our
[1:35:44] nature and he starts with our hearts so
[1:35:47] we see that he created an earth then
[1:35:50] he's going to create a new Earth he
[1:35:52] created heaven but he's going to create
[1:35:53] a new new heaven he created our heart
[1:35:56] and our spirit and he's going to create
[1:35:58] a new heart and a new spirit amen
[1:36:00] Ezekiel 36 Ezekiel 36: 26 a new heart
[1:36:05] also will I give you a new spirit will I
[1:36:08] put within you and I will take away the
[1:36:11] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:36:13] give you a heart of
[1:36:16] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:36:20] you and cause you I love that
[1:36:24] don't look don't look for yourself to
[1:36:28] have to do
[1:36:30] it just seek the Holy Ghost because the
[1:36:33] Holy Ghost will cause you to walk in
[1:36:36] God's statutes and you shall keep my
[1:36:38] judgments and do
[1:36:41] them the emphasis needs to be seeking
[1:36:45] the Holy Ghost amen that way we don't
[1:36:48] have to figure anything out we don't
[1:36:51] have to try to do this that or the other
[1:36:52] or how am I going to get rid of this I'm
[1:36:54] I going to stop doing
[1:36:56] that it just doesn't matter let God's
[1:36:59] God's job he's the great physician he's
[1:37:02] the deliverer there's nothing in the
[1:37:04] Bible says John John you're a great
[1:37:06] deliverer you delivered yourself right
[1:37:09] right you know we don't need to do
[1:37:12] anything except seek God because he's
[1:37:14] all we
[1:37:16] need if we just do our part amen you
[1:37:20] know here's the thing you could put
[1:37:22] forth tons of effort eort to to to
[1:37:25] overcome something and good for you good
[1:37:28] for you
[1:37:30] but God is not
[1:37:33] interested in sharing his glory with you
[1:37:36] right right
[1:37:38] amen you could give your body to be
[1:37:43] burned what what it
[1:37:46] profit God is interested in you saying
[1:37:48] lord I can't do anything without you
[1:37:50] fill me with the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:37:52] God's looking for that
[1:37:54] mindset that heart of hunger and thirst
[1:37:58] after the Holy
[1:38:00] Ghost Ezekiel 11:
[1:38:03] 19 and I will give them I love this one
[1:38:08] heart in other words the heart that God
[1:38:10] puts in you is his
[1:38:12] heart to where you begin to love the
[1:38:15] things of God and I will put a new
[1:38:17] spirit within you and I will take away
[1:38:19] the Stony heart out of their flesh and
[1:38:21] will give them a heart of Flesh
[1:38:23] sometimes we can hinder the progress of
[1:38:25] God after the work that he's begun in us
[1:38:28] we we can become a little cold
[1:38:30] indifferent hard hold grudges or be
[1:38:33] judgmental but we've got to align
[1:38:36] ourselves up with the thoughts that God
[1:38:38] has for us and the expectations that God
[1:38:41] has for us like David when he prayed in
[1:38:43] Psalms 51:10 create in me a clean heart
[1:38:48] and renew a right Spirit within me see
[1:38:51] he had been serving the lord he was a
[1:38:53] child of God he's chosen of God but he
[1:38:55] he needed to realign his thoughts in his
[1:38:59] heart with God's expectations
[1:39:01] amen every time we sing the the song
[1:39:04] from my heart change my heart oh God you
[1:39:09] know what you're doing you're realigning
[1:39:12] your thoughts with the thoughts of God
[1:39:13] that's what you're doing right there
[1:39:16] you're getting ready for God to create a
[1:39:18] future for
[1:39:20] you now each and every time we come to a
[1:39:23] church we have a chance to be changed
[1:39:26] for God to change us it's a time where
[1:39:30] God places a vision before us and a lot
[1:39:34] of times it's something that we're not
[1:39:35] even looking
[1:39:37] for he says something who where that I
[1:39:39] wasn't praying about
[1:39:41] that I wasn't thinking about that but
[1:39:43] what God's doing with you he's placing a
[1:39:46] vision before
[1:39:48] you you have a chance to pick that up
[1:39:50] and say amen that's for me or you have a
[1:39:53] chance to say nope nope nope NOP no I'm
[1:39:56] a picky eater nope nope NOP NOP NOP I I
[1:39:59] come to church for this this is what
[1:40:02] I I'm okay if you want to do that once
[1:40:04] in a while hey you got
[1:40:06] something don't don't let that be your
[1:40:09] habit that's not what church is
[1:40:11] for church is go it's what you come to
[1:40:15] church to find out where you're at with
[1:40:16] God in other words you don't know where
[1:40:17] you're at with God and you you you
[1:40:19] you're trusting that God would reveal
[1:40:22] that to you through the preaching of the
[1:40:24] word that's what church is
[1:40:28] for we don't want to disect remember
[1:40:30] when we were in school we had a disect
[1:40:32] of the frogs and
[1:40:33] stuff
[1:40:36] like Psalms 23:3 he restoreth my soul so
[1:40:42] there is a a process of
[1:40:46] recreation we don't believe in Two
[1:40:49] Souls but we do believe in God restor
[1:40:53] ing our soul he restoreth my soul he
[1:40:57] leadeth me in Paths of righteousness for
[1:40:59] his name's sake so that's what happens
[1:41:01] when we come to church he is leading Us
[1:41:04] in Paths of
[1:41:06] righteousness he's showing us clearly
[1:41:08] the path the attitude the thoughts the
[1:41:11] things that we need to be
[1:41:13] doing Isaiah chapter 42:9 behold the
[1:41:17] former things are come to
[1:41:19] pass and new things I do declare
[1:41:23] before they spring forth I tell you of
[1:41:29] them to me it shows the thought process
[1:41:33] we should have when we come to
[1:41:36] church that God wants to show us
[1:41:39] something God wants to tell us something
[1:41:42] why because he wants your
[1:41:45] expectation to be right where his is
[1:41:49] at this isn't a God is not meant to be a
[1:41:53] mystery for his
[1:41:55] bride brother Brandon preached that
[1:41:58] Christ is the mystery of God revealed to
[1:42:00] his
[1:42:02] bride
[1:42:04] amen we're just not church goers we
[1:42:07] don't come to church just to go to
[1:42:08] church to learn about
[1:42:10] God we come to develop our relationship
[1:42:14] closer to
[1:42:16] God the creator of our future is
[1:42:19] continually working on our future are we
[1:42:23] recognizing the new things that he's
[1:42:25] trying to speak to
[1:42:28] us even though all the hardships that
[1:42:32] we've gone through in 2020 God is still
[1:42:35] creating strength and power in our lives
[1:42:38] I want you to think about that we've
[1:42:40] just had a terrible
[1:42:42] year and it seems to be you
[1:42:45] know not stopping at December
[1:42:50] 31st but God is still creating
[1:42:54] he's creating strength and power in
[1:42:56] every one of us if we do what we need to
[1:42:58] do Isaiah 40: 28 has thou not known has
[1:43:02] thou not heard the Everlasting God the
[1:43:04] Lord the
[1:43:06] creator of the ends of the Earth Feth
[1:43:09] not neither is he weary in other words
[1:43:13] it just he's got so
[1:43:16] much
[1:43:18] power he doesn't get tired there's no
[1:43:22] searching of his understanding and he
[1:43:24] you know what he gives that power to the
[1:43:27] faint and to them that have no might he
[1:43:31] increases strength even the youth shall
[1:43:34] faint be wearing the young man shall
[1:43:35] only fall but they that wait upon the
[1:43:37] Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:43:40] shall Mount up with wings as eagles they
[1:43:41] shall run and not be weary they shall
[1:43:43] walk and not
[1:43:45] faint so God is Not lacking creating
[1:43:49] power and strength in your life that you
[1:43:51] don't have today
[1:43:53] am we just have to do our job that when
[1:43:57] we get on our knees and wait on them
[1:43:59] what we're doing is we're realigning our
[1:44:01] thoughts with God and have the
[1:44:02] expectation of an expected
[1:44:06] end 1 Peter chapter 4: 19 wherefore let
[1:44:10] them that suffer according to the will
[1:44:12] of God commit the keeping of their souls
[1:44:15] to him in well-doing as what as unto a
[1:44:19] faithful Creator in other words God is
[1:44:24] still
[1:44:25] creating did you ever wonder if God is
[1:44:29] still creating animals or plants or
[1:44:31] stuff out
[1:44:34] there he's God he can do what he wants
[1:44:36] to
[1:44:38] do I know that he's he's constantly
[1:44:41] creating new mercies for
[1:44:43] me New
[1:44:45] Opportunities new new Faith New Hope
[1:44:49] Paul said I live by the faith of the son
[1:44:51] of God
[1:44:53] God is a living
[1:44:56] God and we we we need to have a
[1:44:59] relationship with them in such a way
[1:45:01] that it's continuously living con live
[1:45:05] uh it's like you get in the car and if
[1:45:09] everybody's quiet there's no sound and
[1:45:11] you turn the radio on and music comes on
[1:45:14] there's a
[1:45:15] difference our walk needs to be
[1:45:18] not off with the voice of God but on
[1:45:23] amen amen and and and we we we have to
[1:45:26] we have to do our part with that have to
[1:45:28] wait on the Lord have to seek him keep
[1:45:31] feeding on the message of the hour amen
[1:45:34] keep feeding on the message of the hour
[1:45:36] that's why God sent it he he did not
[1:45:38] send a message for those ministers who
[1:45:42] walked before us 20 40 years ago that
[1:45:45] message is for us today and for those
[1:45:49] that you need to share it with when's
[1:45:51] the last time you shared the message
[1:45:52] with
[1:45:53] somebody that's never
[1:45:59] heard remember ye not the former things
[1:46:02] neither consider the things of old
[1:46:04] behold I will do a new
[1:46:08] thing a new
[1:46:10] thing how many wants God to do a new
[1:46:17] thing Hosea chapter 6 verse one we're
[1:46:21] winding down
[1:46:25] Come and Let Us return unto the
[1:46:28] Lord for he have torn and he will heal
[1:46:32] us he have smitten and he will bind us
[1:46:36] up after two days will he revive us in
[1:46:41] the third day he will raise us up and we
[1:46:44] shall live in his sight now that's an
[1:46:47] expectation right there that we need to
[1:46:49] have then shall we know if here's our
[1:46:53] part listen if we follow on to know the
[1:46:58] Lord there's the job we have to do come
[1:47:01] to church with an expectation to know
[1:47:05] the Lord his going forth is prepared as
[1:47:07] the morning and he shall come as the
[1:47:10] rain and the latter and the former Reign
[1:47:12] onto the Earth you know Satan has got
[1:47:14] some people so Twisted in their head
[1:47:18] that they don't think they need to come
[1:47:20] to church Faithfully
[1:47:24] and they're still going to be
[1:47:27] okay now if that's
[1:47:30] true if that's
[1:47:34] true why would I if I don't come to
[1:47:37] church Faithfully why would I get the
[1:47:39] same reward as you who comes to church
[1:47:43] Faithfully why would I get the same
[1:47:45] Revelation why would I get the same
[1:47:48] preparation for a
[1:47:49] Rapture why should I hear the same words
[1:47:52] well done though good faithful it's not
[1:47:56] right but see Satan is always trying to
[1:47:59] tell us you're good enough you're good
[1:48:02] enough you're doing good enough you
[1:48:03] don't
[1:48:06] need and all that is is a lukewarm
[1:48:10] Spirit trying to get on
[1:48:12] you you just shake it
[1:48:16] off say get behind me Satan I'm pressing
[1:48:19] towards that Mark pressing towards
[1:48:21] there's a prize
[1:48:23] that Waits
[1:48:26] amen without a vision we're going to
[1:48:30] perish align yourself up with God's
[1:48:35] expectation visualize yourself as a
[1:48:38] servant of Christ and help others to the
[1:48:41] Cross visualize yourself with the armor
[1:48:44] of God on overcoming everything
[1:48:48] visualize yourself as a manifested Son

[1:48:55] Bible says that that uh we're going to
[1:48:59] manif be a manifested Son of God it's
[1:49:02] promised for us today the whole world
[1:49:05] the whole earth is groaning
[1:49:08] waiting there might be
[1:49:10] 11.3 species out there that God has
[1:49:13] created but I'm telling you there's one
[1:49:15] species that the whole world is groaning
[1:49:17] waiting for the manifestation of and

[1:49:34] promised to become in the image of Jesus

[2:21:33] enough may God bless you be with you I
[2:21:36] was just thinking
[2:21:37] about when I look back all the times
[2:21:41] that we're praising the
[2:21:43] Lord uh we're some of us are bound to
[2:21:46] get thoughts because they come from the
[2:21:48] devil but the thoughts are okay you've
[2:21:49] praised enough
[2:21:51] okay it's over you praise
[2:21:53] enough
[2:21:55] okay it'd be nice if we all had the
[2:21:58] thought for 2021 when we're getting
[2:22:00] ready to slow down our praise and okay
[2:22:04] it's coming to an end now that we have
[2:22:06] the
[2:22:07] thought he deserves more
[2:22:10] praise just a little bit that's right
[2:22:13] just a little bit
[2:22:15] more and I just believe that's a
[2:22:18] sacrifice that he's pleased with amen
[2:22:21] amen may the Lord be with you bless your
[2:22:23] day today keep you safe and um we're
[2:22:27] looking forward to service this

[2:22:48] order and uh
[2:22:51] if it be the will of the Lord uh in that
[2:22:53] manner I know it's the will of the Lord
[2:22:54] for us to talk about church
[2:22:56] order um and then maybe on Sundays uh
[2:23:00] have our regular services but um and
[2:23:05] I'll probably get into a little bit more
[2:23:07] but I've been guilty of
[2:23:10] not
[2:23:12] um teaching and uh not only establishing
[2:23:17] but reaffirming and bringing to
[2:23:19] remembrance
[2:23:21] um Church order for our church and I am
[2:23:25] the one responsible for that

[2:23:35] that like tithes and offerings justum
[2:23:38] not talk about
