morning amen God bless you I say it's it's just good to be finding God in a City of Refuge our brother Mark was talking about he's our refuge he's our he's our our help he's our high tower and and the righteous run into it and you know when we think about all the problems and things in our life and how we don't want to go through it and wonder why they're there wish they were not there and how do we get out and to me what they are they're opportunities to find God in another way to to get into that City of Refuge too in the you know they got these uh cities in America where you know the people from other countries can come in and and be what are those Sanctuary cities and you're and to me in the midst of the world with problems there are are there are is there's a place in Christ to where you're not bothered amen you're not bothered by things and I I've just been excited that I can get on my knees and find that place with him I don't have to wait for the trials to leave that he's a real God we serve a real God this morning I've been really excited about that um well our brother precious brother Mark had announced the Tidwell families coming now we've got um a couple of churches that are are willing to come and uh but you know I'm going to be honest with you my heart is to see us reach out to some people that perhaps have never been to church maybe they didn't want to come to a service but they're willing to come and be ministered and so on because it's a little more enjoyable um I say it's an opportunist for us to work for the Lord and I want to encourage you to bring someone no matter what's going on in your life take some time to work for God's kingdom amen well this morning if you'd like to turn with me into the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 1 and our we we miss those that are not here but they're Ferguson this family and brother Roger perhaps or others um that couldn't be here this morning on the live stream brother Gideon sends his greetings let's Let's uh believe for them as we go to the Lord in prayer before we begin reading his word our heavenly father Lord we're thankful that uh that there's no distance too great no City too far no sickness to to bad that you can't come in the middle of every situation and make yourself known oh God we pray that you would make yourself known as a Healer to those children that are sick to brother Roger to each one to Our Sister Anne oh God bother we need you in this time and we are so grateful that you've made yourself available unto the believer others we come to this part of the service and Lord we want to subject ourselves to you we come reverently and humbly as you forgive us of our our doubts fears or trespasses and anything that would Grieve Your Spirit today Lord we just ask you to cover us with your blood and may your your presence just come in or miss me we feel you in our hearts and in our minds and may we take your your word home with us may we be encouraged this morning and father if you'd have some some direction for our life Lord in any way we might be in a wrong way we're asking you Lord to take this service today and redirect Our Lives get us on the right path father we need you we love you we thank you for this please Lord with your word with the ministry of the word May the Revelation from above come to every believer we pray give you the glory for these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen the Book of Joshua starting with verse number one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's Minister saying so now this is the Lord speaking unto Joshua Moses my servant is dead now therefore rise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel and every place that the soul of your foot tread upon that I have given you as I said unto Moses this Lebanon given unto the even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the hit unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast and there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail me for safety amen God bless you you may be seated we want to entitle this little service this morning the god of Moses the god of Moses and and as a subject as I was with Moses so I will be with thee amen now this is a precious precious promise how many has ever put yourself in this scripture when you read it that God was going to be with you as he was with Moses amen amen because I believe this is a promise for all of us and we need there's just certain times we just know that we we we need God with us because what we're facing and what we're dealing with it's not easy it's very fearful um and fear is a real thing and courage is not an absence of fear fear can be in the same room where there's faith and in fact the Bible says that he uh prepares a table for us in the presence of our enemies and we know our greatest enemy is ourselves so we're we're stuck with it we're we're dealing with someone who who caves in to lukewarmness and caves into fear and caves into worry and caves into what's going to happen but we serve almighty God today and greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world now when Moses died he needed a leader to take his people over to the promised land and God needed someone who was going to be steadfast with his word someone who wouldn't be shaken by trials the trials that they were going to face because they were going to face some heavy duty trials someone who had a life full of faith in other words when you go for a leader you go for someone who's been faithful when God's thinking about who's going to lead in the millennium he's looking for those who've been faithful in the little things that I'll make you ruler with many over many things so God wasn't uh gonna look for someone who was just up and down all the time God doesn't use flaky people it doesn't use unstable people he doesn't use lukewarm people God uses people who've made up their minds whose lives prove stability and faithfulness to the word of God not to a church not to a Creed but to the word of God you could tell that God was was with Joshua the same guy that was with Moses was now with Joshua and he said here in Joshua 24 I'm just going to read it we're not going to really be script going through a lot of scriptures today but we want to stay in this verse chapter if we could but he said now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and Truth Joshua is saying this to the people and put away the gods of your fathers which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord so God brought us out of the world not just to go to church but to serve him amen and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord in other words if it's too much to ask to be faithful to uh all of his word then choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served uh that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose Lane you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord no you got Catholics serving the lord you got methodists you got Baptist you got a bunch of Independents you got all different people serving the lord the way they want to serve the Lord but I'm not talking about that neither was Joshua this is the only book that tells you how to serve the Lord you may about a line up with one two three or four but when when if it seemed evil to serve the whole book then you choose who you're going to serve but I'm telling you this Pulpit this gospel this message this church believes in serving the book from cover to cover we got church order that tells us how to act in church you look at it if you don't agree with it that's fine for you but have respect to the house of God have respect to this message have respect to this word [Applause] but as for me in my church we will serve the Lord as for me in my house we will serve the Lord as for me and my vessel as for me and my wife as for me and my children we will serve the Lord the way he wants it not the way I want to the way he wants it and I'll tell you the way he wants it hurts yes it's painful try to pick up a cross and follow it it ain't easy churches are full people who want to serve God their own way they're going to give what they want and not give what they don't want they don't want to serve them with suffering they want to serve them easily that's their choice we're choosing to follow the word now if God was going to be with Joshua just like he was with Moses let's just take a look at the life of Moses for just a second we know at his birth he was a proper child the Bible tells us in other words he was a predestinated seed of God that God was going to use and God was always with him had his hand on him all his life and and God allowed Moses to try to deliver uh his people or God's people uh in his own way and it just caused a big problem didn't it and I just wonder how many times we've tried we knew what the right thing was God had told us just like God had told Moses that he was going to be a deliverer of the people and he tried to go in there and handle the situation his way and it just caused such a fear when it failed and I just wondered today how many times we've tried to we knew it was right we try to handle a situation without the wisdom of God without the leadership of God and it turned into be a big mess I don't want to handle things like Peter did I go fishing no I I want the leadership of God in my life and I'll tell you this is the wonderful thing as I was with Moses so shall I be with you you can have confidence that the leadership of God is right there for you if you're willing to pay the price and get into the spirit because my God he is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship him in the spirit and the truth you know we get so carnal sometimes we want to pick up the newspaper we want to turn on our phone we want to look and just have something naturally come out to tell us what we need to do to help us with our situation but that ain't the god that that that Joshua and Moses was serving these men got on their knees and they spent time on their knees and they got a hold of the god that led their life we're trying to modernize God trying to make him something different than what he is he is the same yesterday today and forever we're changing but he ain't changing we can count on God sometimes you know we make the stupidest decisions like I'm too busy to pray I'm too busy to read too busy to go to church too busy to help build the kingdom of God to be too busy to live for others you know I have great intense I'm trying to achieve that I'm going to help my family's future too busy for God trying to build your family's future just think about that I'm gonna build my future outside of what God wants me to do you know it may not turn out good you gotta plan it right put God in the middle make sure it's his leadership and not you wanting to do something we need the leadership of God in every aspect of our life and so that just don't happen by coming to church you've got to develop it you got to take the word that you're hearing at church and get honest about applying it in your personal lives I'm going to do this I heard you speak and that was for me and I'm going to start doing it and this is how you develop a relationship with God you know we've gotten to the point where we think we're close to God because we feel good so if we come to church and we don't feel good our relationship didn't get developed it's not about how we feel it's about how we believe and we're Believers of the whole word no God allowed Moses to go through some strange things has he ever had you go through some strange things and these strange things sometimes it seems like a waste of time like he spent 40 years in the wilderness just like what wasn't helping the people they weren't getting any closer to the promised land and he was stuck out there all by himself seemed like a waste of time real strange but you know it was what he needed to be a better leader because he still had this um gonna do it and it took so much time to get rid of it it wasn't just coming to church one time in here and you know you need to get rid of your intellect no he had to go through a lot of Trials I don't think he was born the meekest man because meekness is character and it's not a gift I think he had to go through trials out there to become so humble that God could use him you know I believe God speaks to us all a lot but we don't we don't hear because we're so in our our our Humanity and I not that God can't speak to our carnality but there's he expects more imagine imagine you having a child or imagine anybody having a child and they never had an expectation for them to grow up will you just stay on that three-wheeler I don't care if you're 24 years old or not just stay on that three-wheeler tricycle no one would do and if you saw anybody do that you'd look at them and you'd say that's strange God expects us to grow up so these strange things are are really not that strange no it's no different for Joshua he was in the wilderness for 40 years too you ever think about that for what reason I mean he wasn't being bad he was the one that said we're more than able to take the land he was a with 40 Years of a bunch of complainers going through things but you know I don't think any of that time was in vain for Joshua it was not in vain you know what was in vain for the complainers the murmurs that's what was in vain for but not for Joshua because all things work together for the good to them to love the Lord and who are called according to his purpose Joshua's being called if Joshua could be faithful for 40 years sitting in your church or a congregation for all murmurs and complainers God could trust them God could use them I love this word as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Peter said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad with exceeding Joy I believe the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob Moses Joshua was building his character in them to hard trials I believe that so when we think as I was with Moses so shall I be with you don't think you're going to get a flowery bed of ease if you want God to be with you just like he was with Joshua you may have to go through a Wilderness experience it's okay God don't do anything in vain there's a purpose in it it's going to work out for your character to a Believer nothing happens by chance in the message things are that are to be brother Brian says you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned it's planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight I could say so you could be here this morning in a message this day this scripture is fulfilled brother Brian says and I thought God why did you do that why would there be such a thing now that's me feeling you know to see what it was all about because I think nothing happens by chance we all sit there and we we question why is this happening why is this going on but we got to conclude God's got it all worked out it's been pre-planned he knew it they think about this remember that when you first gave your heart to God and the the blood had just covered you and all your sins were gone and you was free as a bird you were happy you were actually happy remember how happy you were you're full of joy it wasn't like God couldn't see the trial that you were gonna it was gonna happen five years down the road he saw it he still set you free he still blessed you he's still got an expected end for you what happened between the beginning and end it really doesn't matter is what the end counts we've got to start trusting God more for our lives in our lives and if you don't want to do that I'll just say it like this you're serving the wrong God because there's only two now God proved the children of Israel just like he proved job right put them through those trials now job didn't murmur and complained but the children of Israel did see they just same trial same test one was faithful one was caught up in his own carnality one group God proved Joshua and Caleb just like he proved Moses and God is proving you just like he's just like he's proved everybody else every every man of God every Son of God must be when he first comes to God he must be proved and tried I mean if you're going to choose a deacon for a church Paul in the wisdom of God are telling Timothy or Titus one of them that that he must be proved first right you don't take a novice you don't take someone that you don't know if they're up and down you take someone who's been proved as I was with Moses so I will be with thee proving you proving your faith proving your trust proving Your Love proving that you'll be there no matter what [Music] did you ever consider just how many things Joshua and Caleb had to overcome during the 40 years in the wilderness The Message Church was filled with a mixed multitude the Bible says there were a lot of make-believers in the church let's just face it I don't know how you you look at one another in the church but you shouldn't be surprised at anything come on you know there were some just all acting spiritual but they couldn't overcome things in their personal life borderline believers having a form of godliness but no power to overcome there were make-believers unbelievers intellectual Believers there were complainers there were murmurs they were hearing Joshua and Caleb were hearing things like we should just stop going to church nothing's changing it's a waste of time we've been wandering out here for 40 years well it might have been 20 and then 25 and you know what I'm saying they had to hear this stuff all the time and when they went to church who do you think they were sitting next to you you think Joshua and Caleb were sitting next to somebody that was trying to tell them yeah we can make it be encouraged no they were sitting next to somebody see the way he's talking right now Moses can't even negativity all around them day in and day out as I was with Moses so shall I be with you well God gave Moses an opportunity hey let's just destroy these people get it over with and I'll make you we'll just get a new group to people together so grateful that Christ was in Moses as I was I was waning Joshua's a leader and he was faithful not just one week one month amen one year the man was faithful that's what I want to be I want to be a faithful servant of God I don't care if the only thing I got to take care of is one person I want to be a faithful servant of God not an up and down yo-yo and you Rubik's Cube you don't know how it's going to end up when it's all over some tangled up mess God is looking for believers that can stand the test there we had a lot of you know there was a lot of weird people in the message probably no different than today people with their own private interpretations of the word their own ideas well this is where Moses got off this is where Joshua was off come on we've all been tempted by the devil that really ain't what brother Brana meant come on oh that's not really what God meant when he said that I mean that's what the devil told Eve he took the same word and tried to get Jesus out of the content of the word of God using the word you think he's not going to come to you and try to get you off the word just a little bit and before you know you just missed church one time and it's a lot easier to miss it twice don't pay your ties one time you know it's a little easier to Let It Go and Let It Go that's the workings of the devil but you know what God I say I don't care what's happening in your life you today you and God are a majority and you can remain faithful in this mess I don't care about the politicians I don't care about the world I don't care what's happening anywhere it's you and God you and God that's all that matters when it's time for a Rapture it's just you and God it ain't you and your family you and your church you and your pastor you and your priest it ain't even you and your knowledge and even though what you know it's your relationship with God a matter on that morning and to me if you're wasting your time now developing the important catching away I don't think God is after that kind of wife come on now I don't think he's after a bride who wants to waste their life why they're living and then hope at the end well you know I'm the thief on the cross well you're the thief on the cross but you had 30 years to be living it all right man well God is looking for faithfulness today and I don't care if the Rapture ain't happening till tomorrow today is the day of salvation today is the day we serve them for me and my house I will serve the Lord and there were people in the in the church trying to manipulate how come there's no amens with that they were trying to persuade others to go back to Egypt hey let's go back it was easier why stay here when we can have it easier to me that's manipulation trying to manipulate others you know if you just stay with the word I love I really love the prophet of course we all love the prophet but he had such a love for the word because the word in God is the same amen amen and he said one time he said if if I didn't have faith to make some promise come to pass he said I would never stand in the way of somebody else who had Faith to make it come to pass the word is our absolute amen we stay with the word and we believe that word now Joshua and Caleb didn't allow the negativity of the church to stand in their way did you notice that for 40 years they had to hear all this stuff but they had a different Spirit that's what made them different they didn't put headphones on they never said I'm not going to listen to that person I'm not going to do this I'm not no they didn't do that you know what they had they spent some time on their knees and got another spirit they got another spirit so when they're talking to the wrong Spirits they're not affected they're not bothered because the scripture tells me that greater is he that's in me then all the complainers then all the negativity now you might think by this sermon that I'm calling you murders and complainers but I'm really not but you know their Spirits out there and they kind of sneak in conversations but we're of another spirit another spirit well brother John I've been dealing with this thing for 13 years did you can you read in the Bible brother Mark where Joshua and Caleb said that they never said that at the end of it all they just said give me my mountain [Laughter] I I've stood at my poster Duty for 40 years listening to that stuff but I believe in the promise of God they never wanted to leave the church they never said they never said brother Ron why don't you and me go over there and start another church because these people are murmurs and complainers they didn't have that spirit you want to know why because God is Not Afraid of anybody murmuring or complaining or problems he's still going to bring up a bride in the midst of this world that we're living in there is still going to be a Joshua and Caleb in this age that's going to live the life no matter what's happening at work no matter what's happening in the neighborhood no matter what's going on amen and that's really who he wants to be with somebody that can stand the test so I don't look at things as problems I look at things as opportunities to serve God in a greater way to give him praise when it's very hard to do when all around you you think about it Joshua and Caleb had another Spirit everybody was at home oh I got to get them going to church and then Joshua and Caleb were like I can't wait to get there I can't get I can't wait to praise the lord I can't wait to eat on the word of God I know it's something fresh for me there's the difference it's another spirit inside this scripture to me goes so well for Joshua and Caleb who had to suffer for 40 years and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and look at this next verse verse 10 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith I'll tell you there's enough in this word to keep me busy to live the word is the hardest thing to quote it is probably the easiest honestly but to love it enough to live it is the hardest thing God help us now they knew they couldn't convert all these unbelievers right you can't convert a wrong seed you can't the law as every seed brings forth of its own kind so they didn't spend their time trying to convert the unbelieving seed but here's what's important for 40 years they remain faithful and I cannot stress this enough we give so many reasons why we're not going to try you know why we're just not going to put forth any effort why it just isn't why it's just a waste of time waste you know all you're doing is proving what seed you are you're proving what spirit is in you and I don't mean to make this strong but I want this message to wake up to Joshua and Caleb's here I do you know this layout to see in spirit is is really for the world it ain't for the church they were a witness to the generation they lived in they were a witness that God honors faith in his word you notice God didn't say you know what Joshua I don't like the way you talk I don't like the way you sing I don't like the way you dress I don't like the way that you smirk you know I'm going to go over here and get one of these murmurs and complainers they're more talented God loves faithfulness to the word of God that needs to become a priority in our life I'm saying this I don't know where you're at and I know we've got some faithful people in this church and I'll tell you I I bow with respect I honor with respect I I look to you as an example for me faithfulness is important it's in Well Done thou good and faithful servant that's what God is looking for because anybody can Sprint anybody can Sprint from here to the road we might have to push sister Johnson but anybody can Sprint from here to there but try running from here to Fenton you need longevity sir amen you need to learn to build up muscles and build up the lungs and and and work on it on a daily basis that's what God's looking for a faithful wife without spot without wrinkle that wouldn't surprise me if there's just going to only be a few people saved Jesus said it would just be a few do you know Paul said it Peter said it Jude said it brother by Adam said it'd be like one in a million he even brought up that it would just be like Joshua and Caleb out of the 1.8 million that came out hmm the Bible says when Once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark Was preparing were in few that is eight Souls were saved by water eight Souls I like how he says Souls brother John it may be just me and my family going well it may be but it may not be it could but it has a lot less to do with our family and a lot more to do with his family I don't mean to be stepping in any shoes here but it's about his family that's who's going to heaven not my family his family when the family of Jesus went looking for Jesus they found him talking to the people and one said unto him Behold thy mother and thy brother and they stand without Desiring to speak with thee and he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who is my brethren and he stretched forth his hand toward the his disciples and said behold my mother and behold my brother I love this verse for whosoever shall do the will of My Father which is in heaven the same as my brother and my sister and my mother so who's the real family that he's coming for sure we want our loved ones to make it sure we want our family to make it but I'm telling you we need to be focused on doing the word of God and if you want your family to make it you need to get them serious about the word of God well brother John I'm afraid to talk to them because they're just going to turn me down this is what I say to you take that time that you'd be talking to them get on on your knees in the prayer closet and call their name out to God and get serious about applying the token what's most important is that we need to get serious about doing the will of God personally no matter what is happening in our church in our family or in the world it's about us and God we need to make a decision for me I'm going to serve the Lord now of course we got family members that are up and down in and out they haven't made a decision the more that they can see a steadfastness in your life the more they can see faithfulness in you the more they can see the love of God in you the more they can see the word manifested in you the better chance they have how many love the word this morning as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Moses had a burning bush experience with God you know what it did it changed his life forever that one experience changed his life forever God is still looking to have that same experience with some of us we don't want to know God just from a a textbook just from being able to intellectually read the Bible and know what the words mean because we can know the word just like Lucifer knows the word and not follow it or pick and choose when he's going to make it look like he's following it come on it's true now the very first thing that that God demanded when Moses was having this experience how many remembers what God what God manifested what God was what God demanded from Moses when when the burning bush happened how many how many no thank you praise God praise God praise God he demanded reverence he demanded respect right off the bat don't come near this place take your shoes off you can't just approach me any way you want to that's what this experience does for the believer it it puts the boundaries of the relationship with God reverence and respect who does God dwell with yeah he dwells in the high and lofty place the holy place but he dwells with them that are humble and a contrite spirit not someone says I could just come into church any way I want to with any old attitude it doesn't really matter what's going on you can do that I could have meet God I don't respect that he'll never respect that can you imagine having that Pillar of Fire experience and right in the middle of that experience Moses says can you wait just a minute I have to go and check some I just have to you get in the presence of God you're just like sometimes you're just froze you can't move you don't want to move well brother John what if I have to you know what you need to think of these things before church you need to prepare because this the sanctuary is the place we meet God that's what it's for it's not a place of Fellowship not a place that we come and talk about God our feelings our emotions what we think our opinions it's a place that we reverence that we hear from God through whoever stands behind this pulpit we need to have more of the experience of the pillar fire we got too many just serving God in their own way you know God the Bible tells us that God resists the proud he just resists them the arrogant the I'm going to do it my way the Frank Sinatra way that's okay you don't have to do it God's way you don't you need to choose who you're going to serve but for me and my house we will serve the Lord we need to take what we hear in church go home and talk to our children about what was heard we need to talk to our wives our husbands and we need to start bringing more respect to the house of God look brother Branham says when they when people come into this your church come into the message they do not know this stuff they have to be taught and it's not fun it's not enjoyable it's it's not like you know going in and laughing and enjoying some thing like that but it's not about us and it's not about them it's about what God expects and and we need to teach this to one another and the quicker we learn I believe the more the quicker God will honor the atmosphere that we create well look we are only a combination of what happens in our home that's all we are how whatever life we're living out there that's what we are when we come here so if you're living a wholly consecrated life at home and you bring that here you're creating that atmosphere but you go home and you're you're swearing and you're yelling and you're you're fighting and you have this I don't care attitude and you you come here at the church you're bringing that with you well brother John I said I'm sorry but you're going right back home and doing it again and again and again we gotta turn make a turn brother John why are you preaching like this I don't know why I'm preaching like this I couldn't tell you it's not in my nose [Laughter] uh we do need to have reverence and respect we certainly do I think sometimes we come into church with a vasty spirit lacking reverence right in the middle of worship when God is being honored through praise right in the middle when God is speaking I just can't imagine Moses right in the middle of everything just saying wait a minute I gotta check on the flock I mean understand this is not a place that's a man-made Church where we're coming to hear Brother John do not come to hear Brother John do not come to a man-made church this building may be made by man and a man has to get up here but God is authoring what's going on and we've got to separate the two how else are we going to get anything from God if we're sitting here always in the natural if God is going to be like you like he was with Moses you have to have a face to face experience with God not just not just an experience that'll pour my spirit out on All Flesh not that experience I'm talking about experience that changes you right Moses when he went to try to do a right thing with his own efforts he fled for fear at his post to duty but when he had this experience with God he was now able to face pharaoh wasn't scared of death wasn't scared of the unknown the unknown he threw a state down his stick down I I don't know if he had any idea that The Magicians were going to do that either right but he wasn't scared because he had that constant communication with God after that after that that initial experience that that experience with the the burning bush he came back and he talked to God all the time that's what that experience does for you it develops a relationship that you have with God on a regular basis well brother John I just don't seem to have that okay we'll get serious about having it because if God is going to be with you like he was with with uh Joshua you have to have that experience because I don't care what's going on I don't care what problems there are in your personal life I don't care work I Don't Care Health I don't care church I don't care what's going on you got to stay in the test God Ain't Gonna Leave You I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I though the whole world first leaves you I'll be with you even to the end that's good enough for me I'll tell you when they were uh when brother Branham uh when God revealed to brother Brandon they had a trap set for him and and uh you know he just was scared about going because the whole place was filled to people that were gonna come against his Doctrine to come against his belief and it was just him and he's not a fighter he didn't want to go he said I'll just you know what I just won't go and God said no you're going he said I'll be with you brother Brian said that's good enough for me I'll tell you when you meet the pillar of fire you're not afraid of anything you know the problem is we're not spending enough time in the prayer rooms preparing getting in the pillar of fire we go there do that do sometimes we do our routines then we come into Sanctuary we're wondering why it's so hard to believe the word why it's so hard to trust well it's so hard to believe in miracles why it's so hard to get the leadership of God in our life to face what we're going through because we're not facing it with faith we got to face it with we're more than able to land promised it my it's filled with swift transition today you meet that Pillar of Fire your attitude will change because your life changes you know what it does it removes all the bad habits and All Things become new you all sudden become faithful out of nowhere you're faithful in other words you know a lot of times we have to have a reason well I'm gonna all you need to know is God's will God's will be faithful to the word whatever the word tells you to do whatever you Whispers to your heart do it that was the best advice that Mary gave the disciples right whatever he say do it just do it and do it faithful because it's upon that decision that you make whether God's going to give you any more he ain't obligated to give you any more until you learn to do what he's told you to do stay with the word if you can't be faithful in a little don't tell me you can be faithful with so much more don't tell me that we need an experience that changes our life we've all had experiences but we need an experience that makes us new new now I had an experience and I was new for a while that don't count that's not the one I'm talking about a the experience that they had on the day of Pentecost half of them did not go back and say you know we don't want the Holy Ghost we're going to go back into the world when you're changed you're changed there's no turning back I understand slips and Falls I do and if anybody believes in them I believe in him because I have slept and I have fallen I don't believe in just taking a back seat for for who knows how long that is not the experience that I'm talking about The Experience I'm talking about is getting sealed with the Holy Ghost sealing out that devil sealing in God praise the Lord a new creature steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord All Things become new presenting our bodies a Living Sacrifice unto God holy acceptable you know the Bible tells me that's reasonable it's a reasonable thing to do you think it's asking a lot well that's different because your gospel and this gospel is two different things God wants to bride that's all for him we don't want to be conformed to the world I want the mind of Christ we don't have to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you know we just we just need to get desperate care enough you know I was talking to her brother yesterday if we can get so sick of our situation we're willing to do something about it but as long as we're pampering it that Spirit can stay around because he is offering more agency God moves through three more agency that's it if you will to will it's going but if you will for it to stay it's staying too many people are trying to overcome their problems with their personal ability and they'll just get all frustrated upset didn't work start blaming one another who's whose fault is it in the church who's the leader of this place um but you know what under the leadership of the Holy Ghost that Pillar of Fire I don't care if you're facing a lion's den I don't care if you're facing a fiery furnace you will stand faithful look at all those Martyrs who wouldn't recant and gave their life 68 million sometimes we can't even stand and love the person that's hating us what is going on we're just struggling on being sweet to somebody who's not being sweet to us that just gives you an opportunity to get perfect love and without it how can we be elected without it how can we be elected brother John you're really pouring it on heavy we don't got much time to around waiting for the coming of the Lord when I compare myself with this image whoa I'm way down here and I can't expect God just you know let me live to him 150. you know today's the day to get serious to become more like him to have a real relationship that when things are happening in our lives we know God is in it somehow he's in it I don't care if they slap you on the cheek turn the other I don't care if somebody asked you to do something go two miles I don't care if somebody uses you give without expecting in return we're talking about Christianity here now every this ain't for everybody but as I was with Moses so shall I be with you for me in my house I will serve the Lord I will do what Jesus told me to do it's a choice I want to stir your choices up I want to stir you up a little bit oh my my we didn't even get into the message today look we didn't have a lot of scriptures right and I didn't even get to the message it's happening all the time no matter how I prepare God said to Moses every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that have I given you as I said unto Moses this is the law of appropriation God gives but you got to take it God gives the lamb but you've got to take it God gives the Holy Ghost which you've got to tell God gives the promises but you got to take it God gets healing but you got to tell you God gives Joy but you got to God give us freeze but you got to take it because Satan is standing in the way so you got to take it amen now God paid the price for us the only thing we have to do is be strong enough to believe it strong enough to get the doubts out what doubts the doubts of God's integrity because that's what's happening when you doubt the word you're doubting God's integrity get him out God's true to his word I'm a liar you're a liar God's true it's okay if you call me liar I'm not going to get offended I'll just because it's the word but don't call this word a lie don't say God fails God ain't gonna come through you got to be strong enough to put your foot where you want it to be however you want the situation to be put your foot there and say it is mine it is mine this is mine talking about God giving God is not going to give you what you need to fight for but he died for you and me there's enough Grace in this world to save the whole world the sacrifice that at Calvary was was great enough to heal every brokenhearted to heal every sickness to deliver every captive to give peace to everybody there was nothing lacking at Calvary he can take away all depression but don't sit around in your unbelief and murmur like the children of Israel did you've got to fight for it you got to take the sword of God's word and stand on the Promises of God every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given you in other words if you didn't put your foot there you know what I didn't give it to you peace is for the believer Joy is for the believer it is not for the unbeliever he has not given it if you don't put your foot there this is the law God gives but we got to take well we know the story about Grace remember the the one slave who was in prison and and Abraham Lincoln set a note saying that he's released and the man got the no in the prison and it said sign President Lincoln and he just oh that wasn't really present Lincoln and he didn't he didn't accept and then there was a big lawsuit and and the judge they declared that a man is not pardoned unless he receives the pardon and these promises are not for anybody but who's ever going to stand there and claim them for themselves you've got to put your your foot on that promise and say it is mine God wants there to be peace in my home peace in my marriage peace with my children's mind peace you got to stand there and claim it in the midst of them saying everything otherwise it's okay as I was with Moses as I was Joshua I'm going to be with you for 40 years of this stuff whatever it takes I'm going to stand faithful that's what God is looking for God gives we must take so just be honest with yourself have you had the right mental attitude have you been praying with desperation about your situation complaining with desperation is not the same thing as praying with desperation there are two different things so what sacrifices have you been doing to take that step what sacrifices are you waiting for somebody to say oh here it is here here are you waiting for someone to come up and say I'm sorry in order for you to love them in order for you to forgive them are you waiting for them to say I'm sorry is that no that ain't it you love them no matter what you put your foot there because it you know if everybody else in this church except you you make it why would you let somebody else influence you it's between you and God I want God to be with me like he was with Joshua like he was with Moses come on now it's a law that law was with Moses he had to go down into Egypt and and put his foot down say these people belong to God he had to take it because pharaoh wouldn't give it and that's how it is the devil ain't going to give you Joy he ain't going to give you peace he ain't going to give you love you got to take it because God gave it to you amen but you got to take it how do I do that brother John well spend some more time in prayer it's not an intellectual thing it's a reality where you get into the presence of God and you have such faith and boldness you can stand there and face that devil who's taunting you who's lying to you oh my okay I I at least let me read this real quick I want to finish this verse number six of Joshua chapter 1 verses 6 through 9. are you with me I'm going to start with verse 5. there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of their life what a promise I love that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and I will not fail thee nor forsake thee that's right brother Johnson if the whole world was in ashes and there were two standing you and God would you be afraid no so why do we have to be afraid today when we're standing alone I'll not leave you I'll not forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end we've got to believe that today he said be strong and of a good courage you know there's bad courage too For unto these people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be strong be very courageous I can why do I have to be strong Courageous about I got you a smile took a little bit but I got it I love this verse only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all according to all the word of God what we have to be strong and courageous with is being faithful to the word that's where we need to be strong with when the devil says Ah it doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter you call that out and say that's just a devil speaking to me I'm gonna be strong I'm going to be courageous and I'm going to be faithful to the word of God that's the courage we need that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from the from it to the right hand or to the left hand some excuses or some reasoning that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever thou goest and this book of the law shall not depart are they mouth but thou shall meditate it meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do it to do according to all that is written therein for then you're going to make your way prosperous and then thou shall have good success have not only commanded thee be strong and be of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goth we got one thing to do one thing to focus on focus on learning to be more faithful to the word of God not pick out five things and say I'm faithful that is not faithful that's faithful to five things the word is all is written in there all so there's got to be something God's working on in your life if he's working on all these things on my life he's got to be working on something on your life I mean we all want to prosper we all want to have good success I want to have a good life whether so ever thou goest we want it the key is not striving to get rich striving to have good success striving to to make a better future it's about striving to be faithful to the little things that God has placed in your hands to be faithful with and when you're faithful with those things then God blesses your life why can't we get that revelation God would have us to prosper in all things and be in health God wants us successful but he don't want it above his word just like you don't put your foot there God ain't given it to you you're not going to be faithful to the word how can you expect God to give you the promise when you're not faithful to the word when somebody else gave their life to be faithful to the word come on they spent years look at brother Johnson spent years and years and years and then we're going to come in we're not going to be faithful but we're going to expect God to bless us this is no Prosperity message this is about learning how to obey all the word well brother John you know the word is the word that's it just preaching the word I'm not preaching my ideas God is calling us to be faithful Joshua was faithful he was faithful for 40 years Moses was faithful amongst all the murmuring complaining you be faithful and God will bless you be faithful and well brother John brother John brother John look I have no other gospel I have no other gospel I know no other scripture for you I I do know that hey there was a time that David was looking at the wicked how they prospered and he said man this is a waste of time I don't even know why I'm trying when I can just you know they're getting it without even trying and then he went to church one time and when he learned their end he said it wasn't worth it it's not worth getting Prosperity today and have a bad end you know if you're not the seed of God I can see God blessing you because prosperity has nothing to do whether you're in the will of God it is poor and struggling God didn't teach Lazarus how to be rich and he and he didn't and he didn't teach Abraham to give everything he had to lot you are what God makes you the thing is we have the key to the success in life to to peace to love to Joy to the things that God has for his children we have the key and it's hid it's hid in Simplicity it's hid in such a a way that President says the intellectual and the smart Overlook it it's faithfulness faithfulness to do all the word what a message I want I want that message in my heart I want to hide that message in my heart you know it's exciting for me to see what God has in store for me you know it may you know I may I may lose that that business you know like could could lose it tomorrow I could right the house could blow up we everybody could leave the church but you know I'm excited about what God has in store for me because the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name so it's not about those things it's about our relationship with God let's Stand Together amen let's sing the course I know the Lord will make a way for me let's listen to these words here I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy life shun the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me we welcome you Lord I know the lord has laid his hands on

if I live a holy life and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me amen maybe as my wife continues to play that quietly if we could just power our hearts and our our heads and I just say with every eye closed my eyes are closed I'm not looking but I am believing that God sees your heart today I wonder if there's anyone here today you just feel God has spoken to you about being more faithful to the word of God to put more emphasis on the things that you know and you're responding back to that call that Lord for me in my house we're going to be faithful you want to be remembered in prayer for strength to be faithful to that word just lift your hand lift your hand I I I my eyes are closed but I just I believe with all my heart that there's many hands that have been lifted today my hands are lifted let's just believe now with all of our heart God sees our hands he sees our heart he sees our desire to be more faithful let's go to him and pray our heavenly father we thank you Lord that you've left your word to us that we might know who you are that we could search the scriptures and know what kind of people we ought to be Lord and we can see in those scriptures that inside of Moses was you inside of Joshua and Caleb was you Lord there was another spirit in them than everybody else and Lord you see our hands that have been raised you see the desires that we have to be just like them Lord faithful faithful to everything and I pray that these people here would not be discouraged because I didn't see their hands Lord let them be encouraged because you saw their hands you saw their hands or you saw their hearts and that's what's really important Lord and I pray that you would give each one more Holy Ghost Lord that we might combat these things that are trying to draw us away from faithfulness Lord and that you would reveal to us more and more how we can be more faithful to you Lord Lord we're not scared we're not afraid we're we're encouraged this morning to to obey all the word of God Lord I pray that you would make every one of us courageous very strong and courageous in the days to come father help us to take the things that you will share with us and to apply them so strongly to our life that it really wouldn't matter who decides not to come or who thinks it's not important or or or what murmuring complaining we might hear God just give us an opportunity to be faithful to you Lord faithful to the house of God faithful to the building of this Kingdom Lord to share this message of Calvary and this message of Salvation and this message that she sent to the prophet with others Lord to make time to share this gospel with others Lord we commit ourselves into your hands Lord we trust you for these things we laid on our our will for your will Lord we pick up your cross and we follow you today we ask it all in the precious name of Jesus Christ thank you Lord Jesus let's sing that whatever you were playing there [Music] he be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleased to you pray let everything I pursue be pleased O Lord I'm to you please let me be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleasing to you praying let everything I pursue be pleasing O Lord unto you I love him I love him I love you cause ye first heavenly father thank you Lord [Music]
