[36:24] now for your blessings in Jesus Christ's
[36:26] name we pray amen
[36:28] amen amen and turn with me if you would
[36:31] to First Peter uh chapter 5 and I'm like
[36:34] to start reading in verse number five if
[36:37] I could verse number five First
[36:42] Peter chapter 5 verse
[36:50] 5 the Bible says
[36:53] likewise ye
[36:55] younger submit yourself unto the
[37:00] Elder but it doesn't stop there it says
[37:03] all yay all of you be subject one to
[37:08] another in fact just put clothes of
[37:11] humility
[37:12] on for God resists any kind of
[37:16] Pride and he gives grace to the
[37:21] humble humble yourselves therefore under
[37:24] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[37:27] you in in due
[37:29] time casting all your care upon
[37:33] him for he carth for
[37:37] you be sober be
[37:40] vigilant because your adversary the
[37:42] devil as a Roy and lion walketh about
[37:46] seeking whom he may
[37:48] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[37:52] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[37:55] are accomplished in your brethren that
[37:57] are in
[37:59] India amen all over the
[38:02] world Amen God bless you may be seated
[38:05] may God just add the blessings to this
[38:09] precious
[38:10] word just hearing um Brother Bruce talk
[38:14] about the 7in
[38:16] diameter hail I I read that they found
[38:21] an 8 in in central
[38:23] Dakota and it weighed almost two lounds
[38:27] wow so when we read there in Revelations
[38:31] chapter
[38:32] 16 we see that part of the plague that's
[38:35] coming upon the Earth because the people
[38:37] rejected God that's right that these
[38:41] will weigh between some say 70 and some
[38:45] say 125 lbs now 8 in is 2
[38:50] PBS God's
[38:53] judgment is going to be great amen and
[38:56] and um um they they say this by the time
[38:59] it hit the earth it was going 350 M an
[39:02] hour imagine what a 50 pounder or 100
[39:06] pounder is going to be
[39:13] flying I think this is the hour to be as
[39:17] serious with God as you possibly
[39:20] can because I I look it like this that
[39:23] God has given us
[39:25] opportunity to to serve him with all of
[39:27] our heart and we know the the devil is
[39:30] constantly working with us to just try
[39:33] to get us to be
[39:34] lukewarm to
[39:36] relax that everything's taken care
[39:39] of but in
[39:42] reality we it's important for us to ask
[39:45] God lord is there anything else I should
[39:48] be doing it just it just has to go
[39:51] through three more agency like that
[39:54] amen uh brother uh bill had called uh a
[39:59] little bit ago uh a week or two ago
[40:02] honestly and uh had thanked us all for

[42:18] morning amen God in habits the Praises
[42:21] of his people
[42:23] [Music]
[42:26] [Applause]
[42:27] amen then we got uh some pictures from
[42:30] from India from uh brother Samson Shady
[42:35] who uh has these three pastors that uh
[42:39] needed Bibles to distribute uh to the
[42:43] people and the church had helped also uh
[42:46] with this so I just wanted to show those
[42:48] pictures kind of kind of uh quick he's
[42:51] just uh sharing the Bibles with these
[42:53] pastors and then they go out and share
[42:55] them with others
[42:58] amen amen just appreciate the work of
[43:02] the Lord uh continuing amen amen and
[43:07] it's just good to be a a part of what
[43:10] God is doing especially knowing the hail
[43:12] is coming right knowing judgment's
[43:14] coming we want to get as many souls in
[43:18] as possible amen well this morning we
[43:22] want to take a look at uh verse number
[43:27] number uh seven there casting all your
[43:30] care upon him for he carth for you amen
[43:33] now we have an outlet we have a pressure
[43:37] relief valve as it were uh the Bible
[43:39] says a way of escape the Bible also says
[43:42] a friend that Sith closer than a brother
[43:46] God wants us to take our troubles to
[43:48] him and just to cast all of our problems
[43:52] on him now this is a hard thing to do
[43:55] but we need to learn to do it
[43:58] uh and and a lot of times you know we
[44:01] want to tell God something but then we
[44:03] don't leave it
[44:05] there it's almost like we come to him
[44:07] and kind of complain about the situation
[44:10] and then we just we take it back and we
[44:12] just live with it and that's not
[44:16] casting Casting means throwing
[44:19] it and just don't go back and pick it up
[44:21] but just just leave it right
[44:23] there now Galatians 6 tells us that
[44:26] every man has the responsibility to bear
[44:29] his own
[44:31] burden and not only that Galatians 62
[44:35] says that every man uh shall bear one
[44:37] another's
[44:38] burden so now we we got a responsibility
[44:41] of bearing our own burden we got the
[44:42] responsibility of bearing one another's
[44:45] burden and how do we do
[44:48] that that means we take the things that
[44:51] are in our life and throw them at
[44:54] Jesus's
[44:55] feet this is is how you truly bear a
[44:58] burden is when you can trust God for
[45:01] what's going on
[45:04] Amen and perhaps there's there's a
[45:07] revelation in it but I'll say Jesus has
[45:10] got big
[45:11] shoulders as the song we used to sing in
[45:13] Sunday school He's Got The Whole World
[45:17] in His Hands he's got the whole world
[45:21] and I we just need to trust him for that
[45:23] amen he doesn't need our help to make
[45:25] sure the hell comes down just right hits
[45:27] the right person the right
[45:31] time we serve a mighty God a big God
[45:36] Amen Bible says that we need to Humble
[45:39] ourselves under the mighty hand of God
[45:41] that he may exalt Us in Du time I would
[45:44] like to read some promises but I'm going
[45:46] to tell you the reason the promises are
[45:48] here we find in uh 2 Peter 1:3 it says
[45:53] according as his divine power has given
[45:56] unto you and I all things that pertain
[45:58] to life and godliness through the
[46:00] knowledge of him that called us to glory
[46:02] and virtue whereby are given unto us
[46:05] great and precious
[46:10] promises the promises are not plaques
[46:13] that we put on a
[46:15] wall these promises have a purpose that
[46:19] by these promises you might be partakers
[46:22] of the divine nature having escaped the
[46:25] corruption having escape the hail that
[46:28] is in this world through
[46:31] lust we're going to escape the now
[46:34] corruption the Judgment that's
[46:37] coming it's through the promises of God
[46:40] I just want to take a look at some of
[46:42] these Proverbs first one is Proverbs 3:5
[46:45] it says trust in the
[46:47] Lord with all thine heart
[46:51] amen and at the same time lean not to
[46:54] your own understanding
[46:57] don't say you're trusting in the Lord
[46:59] but you're leaning a little bit to your
[47:00] own understanding don't it just doesn't
[47:03] work in all your ways acknowledge
[47:08] Him and He will direct your
[47:11] paths be not wise in your own eyes fear
[47:15] the lord and depart from evil in other
[47:19] words it is evil to trust in
[47:22] yourself it is evil to lean to your own
[47:25] understanding we don't realize it's an
[47:26] evil
[47:29] thing I I know it's hard to to grasp at
[47:33] but but look it'll take us
[47:37] down a man has to do nothing he's
[47:40] heading straight to hell with his own
[47:42] understanding there's a way that seeth
[47:45] right right unto man but the end is the
[47:46] way of
[47:47] death so the best thing to do is trust
[47:50] the Lord well I don't see how he's going
[47:52] to do it that doesn't matter that's not
[47:53] what trust
[47:54] is our children when they were two two
[47:57] and three years old and when they were
[48:00] at a point where they could understand
[48:02] mom or dad want you to do this they
[48:04] didn't always
[48:07] understand but they they had to trust
[48:11] you I I mean it was hard for them to
[48:13] trust you at times when they said they
[48:18] you told them you were going to get them
[48:19] some ice cream you ever tell your
[48:20] children something you promised them and
[48:22] then you
[48:23] forgot you know what I'm talking about
[48:25] that's Humanity but God doesn't forget
[48:27] his promises God doesn't
[48:30] forget Psalms 37:3 trust in the
[48:36] Lord 373 trust in the Lord and do good
[48:40] so shall thou dwell in the land and
[48:42] verely thou shalt be fed now look at
[48:44] this promise Delight thyself also in the
[48:48] Lord and He Shall give you the desires
[48:51] of your
[48:52] heart delight yourself in the lord well
[48:55] I don't got time
[48:58] how do you delight yourself in the lord
[49:01] well the best way I can tell you is when
[49:03] you were trying to attract
[49:06] somebody your your your your husband or
[49:10] your wife and you're trying to attract
[49:14] them you put a lot of effort and trying
[49:17] to get their
[49:19] attention you delighted
[49:24] yourself well you just can't come to
[49:26] church and just whatever I'm here
[49:29] delight yourself in the Lord if you want
[49:33] the desires of your heart you've got to
[49:35] put God first amen commit thy way unto
[49:39] the Lord commit it trust him trust also
[49:43] in him and he shall bring it to
[49:46] pass what precious promises Psalm 17:7
[49:50] show thy marvelous loving kindness oh
[49:54] thou that savest by the right hand them
[49:57] who is he saving them that put their
[50:01] trust in
[50:03] thee you want God to save you put your
[50:07] trust in him
[50:10] amen from those that rise up against
[50:13] them keep me as the apple of the of the
[50:17] eye hide me under the shadow of thy
[50:21] Wings Psalms 18: 29 for by Thee I have
[50:25] run through a troop
[50:27] and by my God I have leaped over a wall
[50:29] now youut tell that's pretty strong
[50:32] right to run through a troop of
[50:37] soldiers and to leap over a wall when
[50:41] they're struggling to get over
[50:43] it as as for God his way is perfect the
[50:47] word of the Lord is
[50:49] tried he is a buckler that means a
[50:52] protector to all those that
[50:57] go to
[50:58] church read the Bible pay the
[51:03] ties know that he's a mighty God look
[51:06] the children of Israel saw a mighty
[51:12] deliverer but they still didn't trust
[51:15] him trust is a powerful
[51:19] thing we must trust the word of the Lord
[51:23] that tells us what God wants us to do
[51:25] all right
[51:27] Psalms 37 verse 37 Mark the perfect man
[51:31] is anybody in here Nam
[51:33] Mark he's a perfect man and behold the
[51:37] upright for the end of that man is
[51:42] peace something about peace that God
[51:45] looks at as being perfect a perfect
[51:49] quality in a
[51:50] man but the transgressors shall be
[51:53] destroyed the end of the wicked shall be
[51:56] cut off but the salvation of the
[51:58] righteous is of the Lord he is their
[52:01] strength in the time of
[52:05] trouble we all want God the most when
[52:08] we're in trouble don't we well here's a
[52:11] promise and the Lord shall help them and
[52:14] deliver them he shall deliver them from
[52:17] the wicked and save them
[52:20] why you read that because they trust in
[52:25] him
[52:27] amen without this very important
[52:30] ingredient called
[52:33] trust we don't get the benefits that God
[52:36] wants to give us and it isn't because
[52:39] God doesn't love us it isn't because he
[52:42] doesn't
[52:43] care but it
[52:45] demoralizes God when you don't trust
[52:51] him he that cometh to God must believe
[52:54] that he is he is what he is he is what
[52:57] he says he
[52:59] is and that he's a rewarder to them that
[53:03] diligently seek
[53:06] him now without trust it's impossible to
[53:08] please God trust are what actually
[53:12] activates God's promises in our behalf
[53:15] you trust God he moves you doubt God
[53:18] you're on your
[53:19] own so the best thing we can do is take
[53:22] our burdens to the Lord and trust him
[53:25] all right turn with me to Daniel chapter
[53:28] 3 Daniel chapter 3 and we're going to
[53:31] kind of go through this we started a
[53:32] little bit late today just so you
[53:34] understand don't forget that mainly at
[53:37] the end I want you to remember that when
[53:39] you're getting the thoughts of you know
[53:41] shouldn't it be over by
[53:44] now all right we most of us know the
[53:47] story about the three Hebrew
[53:50] children I want to start with verse one
[53:53] and kind of go through this quickly
[53:58] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[54:02] gold and then verse two he gathered
[54:05] together all the princes and the
[54:07] governors and the captains and the
[54:08] judges treasurers counselors sheriffs
[54:10] and all the rulers of the provinces to
[54:12] come uh to the dedication of this great
[54:15] image he made of gold and and he said it
[54:18] that he had set up and in verse three
[54:20] the princes and the governors they all
[54:22] came and gathered them onto the
[54:25] dedication
[54:26] of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[54:28] king had set up and they stood before
[54:33] the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up
[54:37] then a Herald cried aloud to you it is
[54:41] commanded oh people Nations and
[54:44] languages that all that what that at
[54:48] what time you hear the sound of the
[54:50] Cornet the flute the harp the satbt the
[54:54] the Sury the damer and all kinds of
[54:59] music You Fall Down and Worship the
[55:02] golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[55:04] king had set up and who so F not down in
[55:08] worship shall the in shall the same hour
[55:12] be cast into the midst of the burning
[55:15] fiery furnace therefore at the time when
[55:18] all the people heard the psalm of the
[55:20] Cornet flute all the musical instruments
[55:23] all the people Nations and the languages
[55:25] fell down and worshiped the golden image
[55:27] of Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[55:30] wherefore at that time certain Chans
[55:32] came near and accused the
[55:34] Jews they spake and said unto the
[55:37] Nebuchadnezzar oh King Live Forever The
[55:39] King uh oh thou oh King has made a
[55:43] decree that every man shall when they
[55:45] hear the sound of the instruments uh
[55:47] that they should fall down and and and
[55:49] worship the golden image and who so fth
[55:51] not down in worship that he should be
[55:53] cast into the midst of the burning fiery
[55:55] furnace and there are certain Jews whom
[55:57] thou has set over the Affairs of the
[55:59] provinces of Babylon Shadrach meach and
[56:02] abedo these men O King have not
[56:07] regarded
[56:08] thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship
[56:13] the golden image with which thou has set
[56:16] up and then Nebuchadnezzar in his ragion
[56:20] in his Fury he
[56:22] commanded uh to bring Shadrach mhach and
[56:25] abedo that they and they brought the men
[56:28] before the king and Nebuchadnezzar spake
[56:30] unto them is it true oh shedra meach and
[56:33] ab abedo do not ye serve my gods nor
[56:37] worship the golden image which I I have
[56:40] set up no if you be ready that at what
[56:43] time you hear the sound of the Cornet
[56:45] flute Harps hatb saltry and damer and
[56:47] all kinds of music ye Fall Down and
[56:50] Worship the image which I made well but
[56:52] if ye worship
[56:55] not he shall be cast the same hour into
[56:58] the midst of the burning fiery furnace
[57:01] who is that God that shall deliver you
[57:05] out of my
[57:08] hands I think it's important to know our
[57:11] God Amen because there is a God out
[57:14] there that the only thing that can beat
[57:18] him is
[57:21] God and everybody don't know
[57:24] God that's why we're throw up the
[57:27] Lifeboat why we're to go
[57:30] out because they will get destroyed if
[57:33] they don't know
[57:35] God verse 16 Shadrach mhach and Abednego
[57:38] answered and said to the king oh
[57:40] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[57:44] answer thee we are not anxious we're not
[57:46] fearful we're not confused about this
[57:52] situation we're not careful to answer
[57:55] thee in this man we don't need to have a
[57:57] huddle what are we going to say how are
[57:59] we going to how are we going to approach
[58:03] this if it be
[58:05] so our God whom we serve from our heart
[58:10] he's able to Deliver Us from the fiery
[58:14] uh from the burning fiery furnace and he
[58:17] will deliver us out of thine hand if it
[58:23] be so our God whom we serve is able to
[58:27] Deliver Us From The Burning fiery
[58:30] furnace and he will deliver us out of
[58:33] thine hand O
[58:36] King but if not be it known unto thee O
[58:41] King that we have made up our
[58:44] mind we will not serve thy Gods nor
[58:48] worship the golden image with th which
[58:50] thou has set
[58:54] up then was neb Nebuchadnezzar's
[58:58] Pride set on
[59:00] fire full of
[59:02] Fury and the form of his vision was
[59:05] changed against Shadrach Meshach and
[59:07] abedo therefore he spake and commanded
[59:10] that they should heat the furnace one
[59:13] seven times more than it was already
[59:17] heated and he
[59:19] commanded the most mighty men that were
[59:23] in his army to bind shed R me sh and
[59:26] abedo and to cast them into the burning
[59:28] fiery furnace and these men were bound
[59:31] uh these then these men were Bound in
[59:34] their coats their Hol in their hats and
[59:38] their other garments and were cast into
[59:41] the midst of the burning fiery
[59:44] furnace therefore because the king
[59:48] commanded uh commandment was urgent and
[59:51] the furnace exceedingly hot the Flames
[59:55] of The Fly here they came out of the
[59:57] door and slew the men that actually took
[1:00:02] shadra mesach and
[1:00:08] abedo I mean
[1:00:11] there and the men that were doing that
[1:00:15] died they died that's how hot it was so
[1:00:19] this was a real furnace real Heat
[1:00:27] um and these three men shadat mhach and
[1:00:30] abedo fell down into the midst of the
[1:00:33] burning fiery furnace then
[1:00:35] Nebuchadnezzar the King was as stoned
[1:00:38] and Rose up in haste and spake and said
[1:00:41] unto the counselors did not we cast
[1:00:44] three men bound into the midst of the
[1:00:47] fire they answered and said unto the
[1:00:49] king true oh King and he answered and
[1:00:53] said lo I see four
[1:00:57] men they're
[1:00:59] loose they're walking in the midst of
[1:01:01] the fire and they have no
[1:01:05] hurt and the form of the fourth one is
[1:01:09] like the Son of
[1:01:14] God now the men that
[1:01:18] threw shedrach mhach and abedo in there
[1:01:21] they did not trust
[1:01:23] God in fact if you look at history
[1:01:26] they bowed before the golden
[1:01:29] image because you know I'll just say it
[1:01:32] like this the devil wants to manipulate
[1:01:37] us but God's children will not be
[1:01:41] manipulated not by man not by this world
[1:01:45] not by the
[1:01:48] devil we have chosen through fre more
[1:01:51] agency to serve God and God
[1:01:54] alone then nebuchad nessar came near to
[1:01:57] the mouth of the burning fiery furnace
[1:01:59] and spake and said Shadrach mesach and
[1:02:01] abedo ye Servants of the most high God
[1:02:04] come forth come hither then Shadrach
[1:02:06] mhach and
[1:02:07] abedo uh came forth of the midst of the
[1:02:11] fire now now can you imagine I wonder
[1:02:14] what would have
[1:02:15] happened if Jesus would have came at
[1:02:18] that time the fourth like the son I
[1:02:20] wonder what would have happened he would
[1:02:22] have came forth out of
[1:02:24] there and the prince and the governors
[1:02:26] and the captains and the King's
[1:02:28] counselors being gathered together saw
[1:02:31] these
[1:02:32] men who uh upon look at this whose
[1:02:36] bodies the fire had no power nor was the
[1:02:40] hair of their head head singed neither
[1:02:43] were their Cults changed now look at
[1:02:45] this nor the smell of the fire had
[1:02:49] passed on them they were completely not
[1:02:54] touched then NE Nebuchadnezzar spake and
[1:02:56] said blessed be the god of shad mesch
[1:02:59] and abedo who have set his angels and
[1:03:01] delivered his servants
[1:03:05] that trusted in
[1:03:09] him that amazing word that makes all the
[1:03:12] difference in a Christian's
[1:03:14] life that one
[1:03:16] word can make you
[1:03:19] prosperous that that one word can just
[1:03:22] turn your life 180 degrees
[1:03:31] and changed the king's word and yielded
[1:03:34] their bodies that they might not serve
[1:03:36] and worship any God except their own God
[1:03:39] therefore I make a decree that every
[1:03:41] people Nations and language which spake
[1:03:43] anything a Miss against the god of
[1:03:45] shadat mhach and Abednego shall be cut
[1:03:47] in pieces and their houses shall be made
[1:03:50] to dungill because there is no other God
[1:03:52] that can deliver after this sord amen
[1:04:13] H this is more than a
[1:04:20] story it's more than a Sunday School
[1:04:23] Story it is a reality
[1:04:26] for the
[1:04:28] believer now this King he represents the
[1:04:35] devil and I I
[1:04:37] I I don't want to get into this is typed
[1:04:41] in a couple different ways but I want to
[1:04:44] type it to you and me today to the to
[1:04:47] the
[1:04:48] believer the three Hebrews
[1:04:51] represent you Body Soul and Spirit and
[1:04:55] sometimes times we will get plagued and
[1:04:57] we will go through a
[1:04:59] furnace and be afflicted in our bodies
[1:05:02] sometimes in our Spirits sometimes our
[1:05:07] souls the furnace is the trials that we
[1:05:09] go through the
[1:05:12] unbearable trials is when it's seven
[1:05:15] times hotter than what You' seen you've
[1:05:16] ever gone through
[1:05:20] before the men that throw uh that threw
[1:05:23] the Hebrews in there typed as
[1:05:26] uncontrollable circumstances you just
[1:05:28] kind of get thrown into it are you with
[1:05:30] me amen and the fourth in the furnace is
[1:05:35] Christ with you in your
[1:05:39] trials now for the most part we'll
[1:05:43] probably never be literally thrown into
[1:05:45] a furnace of
[1:05:49] fire there have
[1:05:52] been but we probably will probably die
[1:05:55] without that
[1:05:58] happening but there will be many
[1:06:00] spiritual furnaces with spiritual fires
[1:06:04] that we we will be thrown
[1:06:06] into and when it
[1:06:09] happens will Christ be
[1:06:12] there or will he be on the outside of
[1:06:15] the
[1:06:16] Furnace it'll be up to
[1:06:18] you it'll be up to whether you're
[1:06:21] trusting him or not trusting him I've
[1:06:24] been in trials
[1:06:27] that I didn't see
[1:06:29] God I didn't trust
[1:06:31] God and I was
[1:06:33] alone and I've been in
[1:06:36] Trials where I trusted God and I did not
[1:06:38] see
[1:06:40] him and there is a huge
[1:06:42] difference a huge difference on the
[1:06:45] outcome because God cannot honor my
[1:06:48] doubt just because I'm his
[1:06:51] child just because I'm his light just
[1:06:53] because I'm his bride just because I
[1:06:55] believe it doesn't mean he's going to
[1:06:58] honor me he honors those that trust
[1:07:04] him so when we go through there will you
[1:07:09] remain untouched like these
[1:07:11] Hebrews or will you be consumed because
[1:07:14] of the
[1:07:15] situation will you trust him or will you
[1:07:17] be leaning to your own understanding
[1:07:19] that's the difference it's a choice that
[1:07:22] has to be made First Peter chapter 4:12
[1:07:26] says beloved thinketh not strange the
[1:07:29] fiery trials which is
[1:07:32] designed predetermined to try you as
[1:07:35] though some strange thing happened to
[1:07:37] you how many times you go through a
[1:07:38] trial and say this is strange I
[1:07:40] shouldn't be going through this
[1:07:42] thing God allows trials in our life to
[1:07:45] test us whether we're going to trust him
[1:07:49] or not trust him amen now am I saying
[1:07:52] that God is the one that causes all the
[1:07:56] trials that's not what I'm
[1:07:58] saying what I am saying is God does
[1:08:01] allow
[1:08:03] it and he wants to see if you're going
[1:08:07] to trust him in that trial and if you do
[1:08:09] you will see God there by
[1:08:12] faith and if you if you can't because
[1:08:15] you're leaning to your own understanding
[1:08:17] because that seems to
[1:08:20] be big
[1:08:23] problem you won't see God by
[1:08:27] Faith 1 Peter chap
[1:08:30] 1:7 that the trial of your faith being
[1:08:34] much more precious than
[1:08:37] gold that
[1:08:39] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[1:08:42] might be found unto the praise and honor
[1:08:43] and Glory at the appearing of Jesus
[1:08:47] Christ
[1:08:48] amen now look at this whom having not
[1:08:52] seen you love
[1:08:56] though now you see him not though you
[1:08:58] see him not yet
[1:09:00] believing you can actually Rejoice with
[1:09:04] joy unspeakable and full of Glory Glory
[1:09:07] right in the middle of your trial
[1:09:09] without seeing
[1:09:11] them because you love him and because
[1:09:15] you believe you can rejoice in your
[1:09:17] trial knowing that the son of man is
[1:09:20] right there with
[1:09:23] you receiving the end of your faith even
[1:09:26] the salvation of your
[1:09:29] souls now these three
[1:09:31] Hebrews they didn't have they didn't
[1:09:33] necessarily do anything
[1:09:36] wrong but they still had a choice to
[1:09:38] make to either humble themselves trust
[1:09:41] in the Lord or to lean to their own
[1:09:44] understanding and tell them you know I
[1:09:47] don't have to bow before you who do you
[1:09:49] think you are you are not the god of
[1:09:52] creation you know a lot of times we want
[1:09:55] to lean to our own understanding and
[1:09:57] prove that what we're how we're standing
[1:10:00] is the right
[1:10:03] way and what we really need to do is
[1:10:05] just humble ourselves under the mighty
[1:10:08] hand of God trust him in the middle of
[1:10:10] your trial right because he's deliverer
[1:10:14] not you not your
[1:10:16] wisdom not what you
[1:10:19] know God is the deliver he's not going
[1:10:21] to share his glory with
[1:10:23] us humble
[1:10:26] yourselves under the mighty hand of God
[1:10:29] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:10:31] casting all your care upon him for he
[1:10:35] carth for
[1:10:37] you just throw it upon
[1:10:40] him be sober be vigilant because your
[1:10:45] adversary the devil as a royan lion
[1:10:48] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[1:10:51] whom resist steadfast in the faith
[1:10:53] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:10:55] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:10:58] in the
[1:10:59] world what are some ways that Believers
[1:11:02] can become
[1:11:04] devoured obviously when we're walking in
[1:11:06] our
[1:11:08] flesh when we're being arrogant or or
[1:11:10] proud We got a proud Spirit maybe being
[1:11:13] hateful towards
[1:11:15] somebody not not prayed
[1:11:18] up maybe just Desiring our own
[1:11:22] will you put yourself in a very weak
[1:11:26] position and you can become devoured by
[1:11:28] the enemy when you're in that state of
[1:11:31] mind are you with me Galatians 5:15 says
[1:11:35] but if you bite and devour one
[1:11:40] another take he that ye be not
[1:11:44] consumed one of another you know that
[1:11:46] word
[1:11:47] consumed this is the only time it's used
[1:11:50] in the New Testament is right here
[1:11:55] how what really happens
[1:11:59] when we're taking bites out of one
[1:12:02] another little sarcastic marks little
[1:12:06] hateful things little
[1:12:08] resent what you're doing is you're
[1:12:10] killing one
[1:12:12] another you're devouring one another and
[1:12:16] what is the answer to take care of this
[1:12:18] problem Paul says this I say then walk
[1:12:21] in the spirit and you shall not fulfill
[1:12:23] the lust of the flesh walk in the Holy
[1:12:26] Ghost and you will not devour one
[1:12:27] another walk in the spirit and you will
[1:12:30] not lean to your own understanding you
[1:12:32] will not put confidence in your
[1:12:36] flesh John I thought it was the devil
[1:12:39] that's walking around seeking whom he
[1:12:42] may devour and not a person it really is
[1:12:46] the devil but he's also walking with
[1:12:51] those looking for a vessel to use
[1:12:56] you know the devil can't do anything to
[1:12:58] US unless he's got a vessel to
[1:13:00] use and sometimes we become a uned
[1:13:04] vessel to him because the devil
[1:13:06] outsmarts
[1:13:07] us and he thinks he can get us to know
[1:13:12] more than the other person in the
[1:13:18] situation look either we're going to
[1:13:19] trust God or we're going to lean to our
[1:13:21] own understanding and handle it
[1:13:23] oursel that the devil is always looking
[1:13:26] for opportunity in our mind in our
[1:13:30] mouth to
[1:13:34] devour sometimes devour ourselves
[1:13:37] sometimes devour others now another way
[1:13:39] to be devoured by our adversary is being
[1:13:42] so spiritually weak that we're
[1:13:45] struggling to trust in
[1:13:48] God to be at a place where I can't trust
[1:13:52] God for my situation
[1:13:56] that's a a an open door to be devoured
[1:14:00] by the enemy it's a sure way to
[1:14:04] be bothered upset angry
[1:14:11] confused and God wants us to be
[1:14:14] confident just like the three Hebrews
[1:14:17] were
[1:14:20] confident I don't need to talk about
[1:14:22] this I I don't I don't need any any help
[1:14:27] my decision is made I know where I'm
[1:14:33] standing I believe God wants us to
[1:14:36] always humble ourselves under the mighty
[1:14:39] word of God Amen and the word says that
[1:14:42] he cares about us he cares about our
[1:14:45] situation he wants us to just cast it on
[1:14:47] him and leave it I I know it seems very
[1:14:51] like this doesn't seem right how is this
[1:14:53] going to fix anything
[1:14:55] but you know it
[1:14:56] does it fixes it and it's the same thing
[1:15:00] for every situation physically
[1:15:02] spiritually emotionally financially I
[1:15:04] don't care what it is cast your cares
[1:15:07] upon Him He cares for you he's going to
[1:15:09] take care of you it's his
[1:15:13] promise it's better to Humble ourselves
[1:15:15] and just trust God than to lean to our
[1:15:18] own
[1:15:19] understanding so when we're thrown into
[1:15:22] the fiery furnace of our trials here's
[1:15:25] some questions for us will Christ be
[1:15:28] there or will he be a distant
[1:15:32] thought because you're trying to figure
[1:15:33] out what to
[1:15:37] do will he want you will you want to
[1:15:41] contact
[1:15:43] somebody or will you want to have a talk
[1:15:45] with
[1:15:48] Jesus will you have trust or will you
[1:15:51] lean to your own understanding will he
[1:15:53] be your shield and buckle
[1:15:56] or will you be burnt up with Stress and
[1:16:00] Anxiety will you be filled with the
[1:16:02] spirit or will you be
[1:16:05] found wanting in the balance will you be
[1:16:09] lacking
[1:16:11] him needing more
[1:16:14] trust Psalms 20 says some trust in
[1:16:17] chariots some in horses but we will
[1:16:19] remember the name of the Lord Our God
[1:16:23] Amen you take sides
[1:16:25] we can talk about the situation or we
[1:16:27] can give praise to God for taking care
[1:16:29] of the
[1:16:30] situation the Bible says it's better to
[1:16:32] trust in the Lord than to put your
[1:16:34] confidence in
[1:16:37] man it's better to trust in the Lord
[1:16:39] than to put confidence in
[1:16:42] princes that's that's the that's the the
[1:16:45] pentacle of men right the
[1:16:49] princes Jesus gave us Good Counsel how
[1:16:51] many wants some counseling from Jesus
[1:16:53] today am amen Revelations 3: 18 I
[1:16:58] counsel thee to buy of me gold that's
[1:17:02] been tried in the fire
[1:17:06] amen that thou mayest be rich in the
[1:17:09] white rment that thou mayest be clothed
[1:17:12] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:17:14] anoint thine eyes with eyesa that thou
[1:17:16] mayest
[1:17:18] see we can say that God has been there
[1:17:22] and done thaten
[1:17:25] that he can handle whatever the devil
[1:17:28] throws at
[1:17:31] him he could handle anything that his
[1:17:34] Heavenly Father asked him to
[1:17:37] do no matter how much it went against
[1:17:39] the flesh
[1:17:41] right he was tried in the hottest fire
[1:17:44] that could be tried and he came out the
[1:17:47] same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:52] amen his hand
[1:17:55] he was he was
[1:17:57] offered
[1:17:59] popularity offered
[1:18:01] Fame he was offered everything this
[1:18:04] world could give
[1:18:06] him he had free will he could have took
[1:18:08] it he could have escaped
[1:18:11] Calvary he could have called for 12
[1:18:13] Legions of
[1:18:15] angels as for God his way is perfect the
[1:18:18] word of the Lord is
[1:18:22] tried this word is not
[1:18:26] lacking I am
[1:18:30] lacking our spouse is
[1:18:33] lacking our boss is
[1:18:35] lacking we're
[1:18:37] lacking the word of God is Not lacking
[1:18:41] right trust in the
[1:18:43] word great
[1:18:45] benefits by just trusting in the
[1:18:49] word now God doesn't want us to lean to
[1:18:52] our own understand that the typical
[1:18:54] thing we do when we go through a
[1:18:56] trial but he wants us to get desperate
[1:18:59] for more Holy
[1:19:02] Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the only
[1:19:05] thing that can really handle it he's
[1:19:08] going to shake heaven and
[1:19:11] earth and the only thing that's going to
[1:19:13] remain is that that's attached to
[1:19:18] God now we need to get desperate for
[1:19:21] more of the Holy Ghost and Jesus said I
[1:19:23] counsel thee my advice to you is to buy
[1:19:26] of me gold tried in the fire to buy of
[1:19:34] me to buy of God that's kind of
[1:19:41] a kind of a a strange way of saying it
[1:19:44] but if you want to buy a a share of
[1:19:47] something that means you're part owner
[1:19:49] with
[1:19:50] it right we we have uh we own part of a
[1:19:55] so we're able to to get raw milk the
[1:19:59] only way we could get it is to actually
[1:20:00] own it so we we have a share of a
[1:20:04] cow I've never seen it before but I've
[1:20:08] been drinking the fruit
[1:20:11] thereof some of us have have bought a
[1:20:14] share of a vacation
[1:20:17] home well you can have a share of
[1:20:20] Christ Jesus said buy of me a share not
[1:20:24] a CH church not a man-made religion not
[1:20:27] a form of godliness not some thought but
[1:20:29] by of me the real genuine
[1:20:37] God Romans 8:16 says the spirit itself
[1:20:41] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:20:45] are the children of
[1:20:47] God and if children than heirs Heirs of
[1:20:50] God look at joint HS with Christ
[1:20:54] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:20:58] may also be glorified with him yes we're
[1:21:00] going to
[1:21:03] suffer the whole world suffering I'd
[1:21:06] rather suffer with with with Jesus than
[1:21:08] suffer on my
[1:21:11] own now Jesus when he told his disciples
[1:21:14] that he was going
[1:21:17] away that he was going to return in the
[1:21:21] form of the Holy Ghost and he was going
[1:21:23] to abide with each one of them this is
[1:21:27] the same Jesus that was walking with him
[1:21:30] but now in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:33] because the Holy Ghost could not come at
[1:21:35] the same time that Jesus was on Earth we
[1:21:37] know that because the fullness of the
[1:21:39] God had dwelt in Jesus all of God was in
[1:21:44] Jesus John
[1:21:46] 14:16 he said and I will pray that the
[1:21:49] father and he shall give you another
[1:21:52] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:21:55] forever
[1:21:58] forever not
[1:22:00] from uh Mountaintop to
[1:22:04] Mountaintop he'll be with you when you
[1:22:06] go through the
[1:22:08] valleys even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:22:11] the world cannot receive because it
[1:22:13] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[1:22:16] know him for he dwelleth with you and it
[1:22:18] shall be in you amen I will not leave
[1:22:21] you comfortless I will come to you I
[1:22:24] will would rather be in the trial with
[1:22:26] the Holy
[1:22:27] Ghost than not to have any trials not
[1:22:31] have the Holy Ghost because there is
[1:22:34] just some there is just something about
[1:22:36] the presence of God in your
[1:22:38] life it it's a real thing the holy ghost
[1:22:42] is
[1:22:44] real I think the problem is is too many
[1:22:46] people try to be a Christian without the
[1:22:49] Holy
[1:22:50] Ghost I think that is absolutely the
[1:22:52] biggest problem we have and that that to
[1:22:55] me is nothing but a
[1:22:58] religion God is
[1:23:02] real it's worth us taking the time and
[1:23:05] seeking for more of the Holy Ghost how
[1:23:07] many want more of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:11] amen now we can just cast the cares upon
[1:23:15] him because he's going to be with us
[1:23:18] he's going to comfort us he's going to
[1:23:19] help us in our trials doesn't matter
[1:23:22] what trial that we're going through if
[1:23:23] the Holy Ghost inside of us he can
[1:23:26] handle
[1:23:26] it because he asks us to buy of him gold
[1:23:30] tried in the fire he can handle
[1:23:34] it John 15:7 says if you abide in
[1:23:38] me and my words abide in you then you
[1:23:42] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:23:44] unto you right see there's an abiding
[1:23:47] that has to take place you have to get
[1:23:49] the word inside of
[1:23:51] you there has to be some sort of
[1:23:54] interest desire hunger and thirst to
[1:23:57] read the
[1:23:59] Bible to get the word inside because if
[1:24:02] the word don't get inside how are you
[1:24:03] going to be able to speak
[1:24:08] amen did you ever try doing something
[1:24:11] without
[1:24:15] God it it just doesn't work out very
[1:24:18] good does it we've all had we've all had
[1:24:21] it we and still from time to time we try
[1:24:22] to do it
[1:24:27] Jesus said in John 155 for without me
[1:24:31] you can do nothing right without me you
[1:24:34] can do nothing right amen Philippians
[1:24:37] 4:13 says but with me you can do all
[1:24:41] things so the key is get God in the
[1:24:44] inside
[1:24:46] right with or without him with
[1:24:50] him will overcome without him we will
[1:24:53] get burned up in our
[1:24:55] trials we will get
[1:24:58] consumed we will get so filled with
[1:25:01] anxiety uh depression will leave us
[1:25:04] depressed uh we'll get filled with
[1:25:06] confusion we'll be get filled wonder
[1:25:09] where is God why am I going through this
[1:25:11] all because we
[1:25:14] decided to not trust
[1:25:17] him God wants us to trust him if you
[1:25:21] abide in me see that word if if you
[1:25:25] abide in me and my word abide in you
[1:25:28] then ask what you will and it shall be
[1:25:30] done unto you it's a conditional
[1:25:34] promise conditional promise how many
[1:25:37] want more Holy
[1:25:39] Ghost all right turn with me to Matthew
[1:25:42] chapter 25 we need to get desperate for
[1:25:44] this there was a group of church
[1:25:46] people a big group of
[1:25:50] people
[1:25:52] who thought if went to
[1:25:55] church they try to live right in their
[1:25:58] home they they didn't try to do harm to
[1:26:01] anybody they paid their tithe gave
[1:26:04] offerings did nice things for people
[1:26:07] that God would see them because God
[1:26:10] loves them and that they would still
[1:26:12] they would still be okay but you're not
[1:26:15] going to make it through the furnace
[1:26:16] without the Holy
[1:26:20] Ghost Matthew 25 says then shall the
[1:26:22] Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto the 10
[1:26:24] virgins which took their lamps and went
[1:26:27] forth to meet the bridegroom and five of
[1:26:29] them were wise and five were foolish and
[1:26:31] they that were foolish took their lamps
[1:26:34] and took no oil with them that oil
[1:26:38] represents the Holy Ghost now but the
[1:26:41] wise they took the Holy Ghost in their
[1:26:43] vessels with their
[1:26:45] lamps and while the bridegroom carried
[1:26:48] they all slumbered and slept and at
[1:26:50] midnight there came a cry uh was a cry
[1:26:54] made behold the
[1:26:55] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[1:26:59] then all the virgins arose and trimmed
[1:27:01] their lamps and the foolers said unto
[1:27:02] the wise give us of your oil for our
[1:27:06] lamps have gone out so they had a little
[1:27:09] bit of
[1:27:10] oil they might have had justification
[1:27:13] some might have even been
[1:27:15] Sanctified but their but their lamps
[1:27:18] went
[1:27:20] out because they did not think it was
[1:27:23] that that important to come to the Altar
[1:27:27] and seek more of the Holy
[1:27:30] Ghost I could just do it in my home
[1:27:33] brother John well why aren't
[1:27:38] we we ought to be so filled with I can't
[1:27:41] wait to get the
[1:27:45] church come
[1:27:49] on but the wise answered saying not so
[1:27:54] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:28:00] but look at the advice that the wise
[1:28:01] gave but go ye rather to them that sell
[1:28:05] and buy for
[1:28:09] yourself we got to come to God and
[1:28:13] buy him by the Holy
[1:28:17] Ghost brother John you are like starting
[1:28:19] some weird Doctrine I never heard
[1:28:22] of why while they got serious about
[1:28:25] getting more of God their bridegroom
[1:28:28] came and they that were ready went
[1:28:31] in and the marriage of the door was
[1:28:36] shut afterwards came the other virgin
[1:28:39] saying Lord Lord open to us we're not
[1:28:41] ready yet but he answered and said
[1:28:43] verily verily I say unto you I know you
[1:28:50] not watch therefore for you know not the
[1:28:52] day or the hour when the son of man
[1:28:55] cometh now we need the Holy Ghost to be
[1:28:59] ready and even the wise virgins were
[1:29:01] telling the foolish virgins who did not
[1:29:03] have the Holy Ghost that you need to get
[1:29:06] oil you need to go to God and you need
[1:29:08] to buy it
[1:29:10] yourself now how do I buy the Holy
[1:29:14] Ghost Isaiah 55 let's turn there Isaiah
[1:29:17] 55 verse one it'll be right up on the
[1:29:19] board
[1:29:24] whole everyone that is
[1:29:27] thirsty come to the waters and he that
[1:29:30] have no money Come Ye and buy and eat
[1:29:34] yay come and buy wine and milk without
[1:29:38] money and without
[1:29:43] price why do you spend money for that
[1:29:45] which is not and labor for that which
[1:29:47] satisfieth not Haren diligently unto me
[1:29:49] and eat that which is good and let your
[1:29:51] soul Delight itself in fatness incline
[1:29:53] your ear and come unto me and hear and
[1:29:56] your soul shall live and I will make you
[1:29:58] an Everlasting Covenant even the sure
[1:30:00] mercies of
[1:30:03] David now when we're seeking the Holy
[1:30:06] Ghost for our lives we're not we're
[1:30:09] actually seeking the life and nature of
[1:30:12] God that's what we're doing when we're
[1:30:14] seeking the Holy Ghost we're not seeking
[1:30:17] some feelings some
[1:30:18] emotion some
[1:30:21] tingling we're seeking God 's
[1:30:25] nature we're seeking God's
[1:30:30] life and the thing that we must remember
[1:30:35] is that God's nature and God's life
[1:30:39] cannot coexist inside of us with Satan's
[1:30:44] nature and Satan's
[1:30:49] life so the only way to buy the Holy
[1:30:53] Ghost to buy by
[1:30:55] God is to give up your
[1:30:58] will you give up your will for God's
[1:31:02] will amen you give up your life you
[1:31:06] surrender you for you forfeit you deny
[1:31:09] yourself and you take God's amen because
[1:31:13] there's no Co
[1:31:14] coexistence with
[1:31:17] God Jesus said no servant can serve two
[1:31:21] masters for either he will hate the one
[1:31:23] in and love the other or else he will
[1:31:25] hold to the one and despise the other
[1:31:27] you cannot serve God and
[1:31:32] manmen you have to give up you want more
[1:31:35] of God give up
[1:31:37] yourself yeah you know a lot of people
[1:31:39] they don't get the Holy Ghost is because
[1:31:41] they still try to hold on to their own
[1:31:43] life and still seek God right just
[1:31:47] become lovers of uh Pleasures more than
[1:31:50] lovers of
[1:31:51] God but God has called us
[1:31:55] to get oil in our lamp to take us
[1:31:58] through because that oil is where we're
[1:32:02] able to cast our cares upon
[1:32:05] Him to trust him in the middle of our
[1:32:07] trials you know we can come here and
[1:32:09] sing
[1:32:10] songs we can talk to our our favorite
[1:32:13] person that the one that encourages us
[1:32:15] the one that helps us but
[1:32:18] honestly you got about to stand alone in
[1:32:20] the trial and know that God is with you
[1:32:24] amen and I would not give I would I
[1:32:27] would give up everything before I'd ever
[1:32:30] give up
[1:32:32] that I love my family but I would never
[1:32:35] give up this relationship that I have
[1:32:37] with God has showed me over and over how
[1:32:40] much real he is and I'll tell you we we
[1:32:44] talk about it I really believe nothing
[1:32:46] can separate us from the love of God I
[1:32:48] really really believe that I have failed
[1:32:52] him so miserably I shouldn't be standing
[1:32:54] here today but yet he loves me how could
[1:32:57] I not trust him how could I not just lay
[1:33:01] everything at his feet and say God for
[1:33:04] whatever reason you're putting me
[1:33:05] through this for whatever reason you've
[1:33:08] allowed
[1:33:09] this I want to stay true to you I'm not
[1:33:12] going to bow down I'm not going to bow
[1:33:14] down to my own
[1:33:16] understanding not going to bow down to
[1:33:18] trusting
[1:33:20] myself I'm not I'm not going to throw
[1:33:25] my problems at somebody else's
[1:33:28] feet not going to throw my problems onto
[1:33:31] somebody
[1:33:34] else I have a relationship with God I'm
[1:33:37] GNA throw him at his feet I'm going to
[1:33:40] trust him I'm GNA you know what I am
[1:33:42] going to see him in the fiery furnace of
[1:33:44] my
[1:33:46] trials how am I going to see him by
[1:33:48] faith brother Dennis I won't see him
[1:33:50] with these eyes but I'll see him by
[1:33:52] faith amen
[1:33:54] I love them I haven't seen them but I
[1:33:56] love them how can you love some you
[1:33:59] haven't seen so an invisible
[1:34:01] relationship is what it
[1:34:06] is so we're buying god without money
[1:34:10] without
[1:34:15] price we're giving him our life for his
[1:34:19] John
[1:34:21] 7:37 in the last days that great great
[1:34:24] day of the
[1:34:25] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if a
[1:34:30] man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:34:36] drink and he that believeth on me as the
[1:34:39] scripture said out of his belly shall
[1:34:41] flow
[1:34:44] Rivers not
[1:34:46] droplets
[1:34:48] right not just done then we got to wait
[1:34:52] three months
[1:34:54] no no he said I'll never leave you I'll
[1:34:58] never forsake
[1:35:00] you rivers of Living
[1:35:04] Water and they don't
[1:35:06] stop they don't
[1:35:09] stop now we can plug them
[1:35:11] up we can plug them up with
[1:35:15] selfishness we can plug them up with how
[1:35:17] like to try some things of the world but
[1:35:19] I'll tell you what God doesn't stop it
[1:35:22] it's an artisian well
[1:35:25] now this living water but this spake he
[1:35:28] of the spirit which they that believe on
[1:35:32] him they that trust him should receive
[1:35:36] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:35:38] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:35:45] right
[1:35:48] God I I love this because this is
[1:35:50] actually a 45 minute sermon I didn't
[1:35:52] stop start the quarter two and it's like
[1:35:54] 11:30 and I'm done I'm just like so
[1:35:57] happy I
[1:36:04] did it's hard to trust God when God's
[1:36:07] not there in your heart and
[1:36:12] mind but if we spend time seeking the
[1:36:15] Holy Ghost why we're not in our
[1:36:22] trials with our free time you know what
[1:36:24] you're doing when you got free time I
[1:36:27] know you think I don't have any free
[1:36:29] time that's a bunch of
[1:36:33] baloney when you take the time that you
[1:36:36] have and you're seeking God you know
[1:36:39] what you're doing you're telling God
[1:36:42] with your life I love
[1:36:47] you and he remembers every time that you
[1:36:50] seek him
[1:36:54] the Bible says he's a rewarder to them
[1:36:57] that diligently seek
[1:36:59] him that when you go through a trial and
[1:37:03] you know oh wow I'm facing something I I
[1:37:05] don't know why I'm facing this I have a
[1:37:07] choice here I am going to trust God in
[1:37:10] this trial and you you start trusting
[1:37:12] God in that trial and as you're walking
[1:37:15] into the the furnace of that trial it
[1:37:17] gets hotter and hotter and you're
[1:37:20] tempted well maybe maybe maybe maybe
[1:37:23] he's not with
[1:37:27] me but if you keep
[1:37:30] walking not my will thy will be done
[1:37:34] right he remembers when you were seeking
[1:37:37] him he will be right there to show you
[1:37:40] he is with you amen now that's more
[1:37:43] important than the outcome of that
[1:37:47] trial it's it's more important than
[1:37:50] getting out of this mess
[1:37:57] Jesus never got out of the
[1:38:00] mess the disciples didn't get out of the
[1:38:05] mess Paul saw didn't give his heart to
[1:38:08] Christ and get out of the
[1:38:12] mess yes we're going to suffer but I
[1:38:14] want to suffer with him
[1:38:16] am and and and God promised to deliver
[1:38:21] us and be a buckler to be a Shield to be
[1:38:24] a protector if we trust him now the
[1:38:27] thing is we all want to trust him
[1:38:28] there's no question about that the
[1:38:31] question is is your love for him great
[1:38:33] enough to trust him as much as you need
[1:38:36] to that comes when you have more Holy
[1:38:40] Ghost it's hard to trust God when God is
[1:38:44] not first in your life right when you're
[1:38:47] filled with the Holy Ghost and you're
[1:38:50] living by the Holy Ghost you're trying
[1:38:53] to to do the things that please him at
[1:38:55] all times that Holy Ghost is there
[1:39:00] now the god who's been tried by fire is
[1:39:03] now living in you and you go
[1:39:06] untouched
[1:39:08] untouched I don't know what it is but by
[1:39:12] the grace of God you can stand there
[1:39:15] when everything is against
[1:39:17] you but you know he's there don't trade
[1:39:21] that for anything brother Marty
[1:39:23] and you know people see it in your life
[1:39:26] amen people see whether you trust God or
[1:39:29] whether you don't
[1:39:31] right you can say it a thousand times
[1:39:34] that you trust God but if you're not
[1:39:36] living it
[1:39:39] right put him first amen amen and he'll
[1:39:43] see you
[1:39:43] through amen let's stand
[1:39:46] together I want to read four verses here
[1:39:51] in Psalms 91
[1:39:55] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:39:57] the most high shall abide under the
[1:40:01] shadow of the
[1:40:02] Almighty I will say of the Lord I will
[1:40:06] say of the Lord he is my refuge and my
[1:40:10] Fortress amen my God in him will I trust
[1:40:15] that's right surely he shall deliver
[1:40:17] thee From The Snare of the Fowler and
[1:40:19] from the noise and pestilence he shall
[1:40:22] cover thee thee with his
[1:40:25] feathers I think that's what was
[1:40:27] happening to the three Hebrew
[1:40:30] children he shall cover thee with his
[1:40:33] feathers and under his
[1:40:35] wings shall thou
[1:40:37] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:40:42] thy buckler amen let's seek more Holy
[1:40:47] Ghost let's practice taking our burdens
[1:40:50] to the Lord and leaving him there amen
[1:40:54] amen let's bow our hearts in a word of
[1:40:56] prayer and if there's anyone here
[1:40:59] today feels in Your Heart Wants To Be
[1:41:02] Remembered in prayer with every eye
[1:41:04] closed every head bowed just lift your
[1:41:06] hand before the Lord God bless these
[1:41:08] hands and God sees your heart so
[1:41:12] beautiful so beautiful amen Heavenly
[1:41:15] Father we come to you with our hands
[1:41:18] United with our precious brothers and
[1:41:21] sisters Lord I just want more of

[1:41:28] situation is more of you and less of
[1:41:32] myself I pray for every Hungry Heart
[1:41:35] here every thirsty heart that's Desiring
[1:41:38] more of the Holy Ghost I pray Lord that
[1:41:41] as they spend time with you in prayer
[1:41:45] showing their love to you calling out
[1:41:48] for more of you in their life God that
[1:41:51] you would fill them with more spirit
[1:41:53] more
[1:41:54] oil that they may be able to walk to the
[1:41:59] very end to when you call us in a
[1:42:02] Rapture
[1:42:04] Lord father I pray for hearts that Lord
[1:42:07] behind their hand that was lifted that
[1:42:09] they're just wanting to about to trust
[1:42:12] you more in their
[1:42:15] trials to about to walk into a trial
[1:42:17] like the three Hebrew children they were
[1:42:20] confident they were so confident when
[1:42:21] they walked when they went in there when
[1:42:23] they were thrown into their
[1:42:26] circumstance they trusted you
[1:42:31] Lord they didn't back out they didn't
[1:42:34] threaten they didn't try to
[1:42:37] manipulate they were true blue

[1:42:42] like that
