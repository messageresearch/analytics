[16:03] rainy weather here. Uh but uh God's
[16:08] God's God's good. I mean,
[16:12] we got a lot to be thankful of, even
[16:15] though it was rainy and maybe there's a
[16:18] puddle here or there. Um, just remember
[16:20] all those that are in uh Texas,
[16:24] you know. I mean, there's a lot a lot of
[16:26] people lost their life. I think the
[16:28] toll's up to like 120 now and they say
[16:31] you can go up to like 170 or something
[16:33] that are missing. So, let's just keep it
[16:36] in our prayers. And, you know, whole
[16:39] families uh just wiped out. And the
[16:42] thing about it is it was in the middle
[16:44] of the night, you know, just imagine
[16:47] that, you know, 4:00 at night and all of
[16:50] a sudden, you know, you just hear you
[16:53] hear something. You look outside and
[16:54] there's rain 8t tall coming down the it
[16:57] rose in 45 minutes, 20 feet.
[17:01] And no matter what whose house you're
[17:03] in, it's if you better have a two-story
[17:05] house. And even at that, it'll rock your
[17:08] foundation.
[17:09] So we're thankful that we have a a rock
[17:12] of our salvation, Jesus Christ.
[17:17] But still tragedy happens. Amen. So
[17:20] let's just remember the families that
[17:21] were affected by this loss. Amen. also
[17:25] for brother Bruce and sister Donna as
[17:27] they're on vacation so that they would
[17:29] just get a rest. Amen.
[17:33] Also for uh
[17:36] uh well Lori and mine's anniversaries
[17:40] today. So I think we're 41 now. So
[17:46] I think we got a longer anniversary than
[17:49] a lot of people our age. So, but God
[17:53] keeps keeps us. Amen.
[17:55] Amen.
[17:56] Uh, also Benny had a request for those
[17:58] people that were affected by the floods
[18:00] in Texas, too. So, let's just remember
[18:03] that. Also, for our brother Marty, uh,
[18:06] he's going to be gone for a while. So,
[18:08] for the keeping uh hand of God through
[18:12] his uh travels, Amen. that uh God would
[18:16] just be with him and guiding him and
[18:18] leading him. Amen.
[18:20] Also, our sister Linda has a request uh
[18:23] for my sister Fela hurt her ankle and
[18:27] knee. Please pray for her. She lives in
[18:30] alone and needs some help. Pray God will
[18:34] send someone to help her through this
[18:37] prayer. Amen. So, uh and she needs
[18:41] encouragement. Amen. So, let's just uh
[18:44] remember that. Amen.
[18:46] So, uh,
[18:51] oh, Amen. Uh, also for, uh, the families
[18:55] of, uh, I believe it's, uh, three
[18:59] people, brother Dennis, that committed
[19:02] suicide.
[19:03] So, there's three young people that
[19:06] committed suicide uh, recently. And uh
[19:10] for the families of them,
[19:13] suicide's a hard thing cuz
[19:17] it's uh a lack of love. They feel a lack
[19:20] of love
[19:22] or there's a circumstance that they just
[19:24] can't handle.
[19:27] But uh
[19:30] you know, we know we we just pray that
[19:33] uh they get to know God, that their
[19:35] families get to know God, that everybody
[19:38] here gets to know God because you know,
[19:40] we were singing that song at the
[19:42] beginning because he lives like face
[19:43] tomorrow.
[19:47] And that's a true statement.
[19:50] But if you don't know that Christ lives
[19:53] in your heart, then you don't have no
[19:56] hope.
[20:01] So let's just uh
[20:06] have a burden for those people.
[20:09] Uh let's just stand and rise. Amen.
[20:11] Let's remember all the missionaries
[20:13] throughout the world. There's a lot of
[20:15] things going on, some good, some bad,
[20:18] but I I believe it's all trying to take
[20:21] our attention off of God. So, let's just
[20:24] not lose focus in that. Amen. Let's just
[20:27] go in one accord tonight. Dear heavenly
[20:29] father, Lord, as we stand before you,
[20:32] needy, Lord,
[20:35] needy of you, Lord. Lord, we've heard
[20:38] these requests, Lord. They were spoken,
[20:40] Lord. They were spoken because you are
[20:43] the mighty king. You are the prince of
[20:46] peace. Lord,
[20:49] we pray
[20:52] uh for them individuals in the flood,
[20:54] Lord, the families affected that you
[20:57] would give them peace.
[20:59] Not the peace that the world can give,
[21:02] but only you.
[21:04] So, we just pray that you would just
[21:07] touch them.
[21:10] There seems to be no reason why no
[21:15] not fair whatever it would be Lord but
[21:17] we know that uh you can you can soo that
[21:21] soul Lord. So we pray for that Lord in
[21:24] Jesus name. Lord, we also pray for all
[21:27] the uh traveling mercies for our brother
[21:31] BR uh Marty, Lord, as the weeks would
[21:35] come. Lord, just give him uh grace in in
[21:38] in your sight, Lord, for these families,
[21:41] Lord, that committed suicide, Lord.
[21:43] These people, Lord, for their families,
[21:46] not knowing why, maybe not understanding
[21:48] why, Lord God. Such a travesty, Lord. Um
[21:53] there's so much to live for, Lord. So,
[21:56] it's not living for yourself. It's
[21:59] living for others that brings joy.
[22:03] Lord, we just pray for our pastor, Lord,
[22:05] that you would just anoint him with the
[22:07] word that you would have for us tonight,
[22:09] Lord, that we might draw closer to you
[22:12] by walking in that word, Lord. We love
[22:15] you, we praise you, and we give you all
[22:16] the glory in the name of Jesus Christ.
[22:18] Amen.

[23:03] Once a sinner far from Jesus, I was
[23:07] perishing with a cold. But the blessed
[23:11] Savior heard me when I cried.
[23:15] Then he threw his robe around me and he
[23:19] led me to his home. And I'm living on
[23:23] the hallelujah side.
[23:27] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[23:30] hallelujah roll. Help me sing the Savior
[23:34] praises far and wide.

[23:42] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[23:46] the hallelujah side.
[23:49] Though the world may sweep around me
[23:52] with her dazzle and her drink, yet I
[23:56] envy not her vanities and pride.
[24:01] For my soul looks up to heaven where the
[24:04] sun might golden.
[24:07] And I'm living on the hallelujah side.

[24:34] Not for all our earth's go millions
[24:37] would I leave this precious place though
[24:40] the tempter to persuade me often tried
[24:45] for I'm safe in God's pavilion happy in
[24:49] his love and grace and I'm living on the
[24:53] hallelujah side.
[24:57] Oh glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah
[25:01] roll. Help me sing the praises, Savior,
[25:05] far and wide.
[25:08] For I open up towards heaven all the
[25:11] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[25:15] the hallelujah side.
[25:19] Here the sun is always shining. Here the
[25:22] sky is always bright. Is no place for
[25:26] gloomy Christians to abide.
[25:30] For my soul is filled with music and my
[25:33] heart is great delight. And I'm living
[25:37] on the hallelujah side.
[25:41] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[25:45] hallelujah roll. Help me sing the savior
[25:49] praises far and wide.
[25:52] For I open up towards heaven all the
[25:56] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[25:59] the hallelujah side.
[26:03] And upon the streets of glory when we
[26:07] reach the other shore, we have slavery
[26:10] across the Jordan's rolly tide.
[26:14] You will find me shouting glory just
[26:18] across the oven door when I'm living on
[26:22] the hallelujah side.
[26:26] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[26:29] hallelujah roll. Help me sing the
[26:32] Savior's praises far and wide.

[34:18] I receive.
[34:21] All things are possible.
[34:25] Lord I receive.
[34:30] Amen. Amen. Sometimes it's easier to
[34:34] believe that others can receive it, but
[34:39] we're here believing that we can
[34:41] receive, too.
[34:42] Amen.
[34:43] Amen. All things are possible to him
[34:46] that believeth. Amen. Let's uh approach
[34:50] the Lord in a word of prayer before we
[34:53] enter into the word today.
[34:56] Father, we thank you that you've made it
[34:58] possible for every one of us in this
[35:00] room
[35:02] to be able to receive from you.
[35:07] At one time, Lord, we were all sinners.
[35:13] We you
[35:16] we were aliens
[35:19] from the common wealth
[35:22] and
[35:24] there was no citizenship and there was
[35:27] no thought of you. We just had our own
[35:30] desires and our wills. And when we were
[35:33] yet in our sin, you tugged on our heart
[35:36] and let us know that you were alive
[35:41] and that
[35:42] we were
[35:45] we were a part of you some way, some
[35:49] great way. You conveyed that to us and
[35:52] let us know that we were out of the ark
[35:54] of safety.
[35:57] You told us if we would just believe our
[35:59] sins could be washed away.
[36:03] And if you could speak to us in that
[36:06] condition, how much greater could you
[36:08] speak to us in your house today?
[36:11] And God, we ask that you would cleanse
[36:14] us of all of our sins. Every one of us
[36:16] that's sitting here in in church today,
[36:21] perhaps those that' be live streaming.
[36:24] Lord, as we bow in reverence and respect
[36:26] to you, would you wash us of our
[36:29] iniquities and our sins that we might
[36:33] have close communion with you this
[36:37] evening in your house. Come and speak to
[36:40] us from your precious word. Give us
[36:44] strength to enter into the word. We
[36:47] thank you for these things. Now Lord, I
[36:51] ask that you would also remember each
[36:54] one that has a request on their heart
[36:56] today.
[36:58] Lord, it's been brought to the house of
[37:02] the Lord. And I pray that thy word can
[37:05] meet every need that would be amongst
[37:06] us. Please bless your people as we wait
[37:11] further on thee now. In Jesus name we
[37:14] pray. Amen.
[37:16] Amen. and we give God glory for all
[37:19] things. Turn with me if you would to the
[37:21] book of Luke 12
[37:26] verse 32. So we're reading out of the
[37:29] book of Luke
[37:31] 12 verse 32.
[37:38] Amen. Good to see brother and sister
[37:41] Bman here. I wasn't sure whether they
[37:45] were going to be here. We didn't see
[37:47] brother Bman in the men's meeting. So,
[37:49] we're just happy to see them. I wasn't
[37:52] sure because of the weather, you know,
[37:54] whether you're going to stay. So, I just
[37:56] praise God for to see them.
[38:00] Amen. Brother Bruce and Sister Donna are
[38:03] are celebrating their 49th anniversary
[38:06] this week. And so, let's be in prayer
[38:09] for them. They'll be back uh for
[38:11] Sunday's service.
[38:14] Amen. Luke chap 12 verse number 32. Fear
[38:17] not little flock for it is your father's
[38:21] good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
[38:25] Amen. God bless you. May be seated. We
[38:28] want to talk about God's pleasure to
[38:30] give us his kingdom.
[38:34] His kingdom. Now the kingdom of God is
[38:37] the Holy Ghost or the living word of God
[38:44] and that's what he wants to give us. Now
[38:48] of course a lot of people not
[38:50] understanding the kingdom we're thinking
[38:53] it's just something on the other side
[38:57] but if we don't enter the kingdom on
[38:59] this side we can't go to the other side.
[39:03] So
[39:05] in John chapter 18,
[39:08] Jesus answered, he said, "My kingdom is
[39:10] not of this world.
[39:13] If my kingdom were of this world, then
[39:15] my servants would fight." So Jesus is
[39:18] making it clear that number one, the
[39:20] kingdom that he wants to give us is not
[39:22] of the world.
[39:23] So we we can't dish it out, find it out
[39:26] in encyclopedias. We can't read a bunch
[39:28] of books. It's not from down here. 1
[39:32] Corinthians 15:50 says, "Now this I say,
[39:34] brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
[39:37] inherit the kingdom of God." So we
[39:40] cannot in oursel and our carnality and
[39:44] our thinking and our best efforts and
[39:46] our works and our we cannot enter the
[39:48] kingdom because flesh and blood cannot
[39:50] enter it. So it's something that's on
[39:53] the inside of us.
[39:56] It's not our our our carnality that
[40:00] enters in. and it cannot enter. There's
[40:02] somebody that's standing at the door.
[40:04] God is having a a white throne judgment
[40:06] and he will make a decision who's going
[40:08] to enter in, who's not, and he's making
[40:11] it real clear that flesh and blood
[40:14] cannot enter in. So, we have to enter
[40:16] the kingdom another way.
[40:19] And Jesus said in John 3:3 that verily,
[40:22] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[40:25] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[40:27] God. Amen.
[40:29] So we we have to become born again. Now,
[40:36] how do we do that? How do we become born
[40:38] again? What a good question. How do I
[40:40] know that I'm born again?
[40:44] So, can you say amen to the word of God?
[40:47] I'll say it takes a working of the
[40:50] spirit of God in the spirit of man to
[40:54] change his nature. Amen.
[40:56] So it takes the Holy Ghost working on
[40:59] our spirits,
[41:01] not our flesh, not our emotions,
[41:05] but on our spirit and our soul to change
[41:09] the nature
[41:11] that we may be able to enter in. In
[41:12] other words, we can't enter into heaven
[41:14] with our nature.
[41:16] So the longer we prolong I don't feel
[41:20] like doing what God wants me to do, the
[41:22] longer it takes to get to heaven. Amen.
[41:26] So, we want to be serious about focusing
[41:29] on changing our nature.
[41:33] Now, how is the kingdom of God given to
[41:35] us? Jesus said, uh, it is the father's
[41:38] good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
[41:41] How is it given to us? Anybody know?
[41:46] Okay, we're going to read a scripture.
[41:47] This is how it's given to us. It's in
[41:49] second Peter 1:11.
[41:51] The Bible says, "For for soul in
[41:54] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[41:58] abundantly
[41:59] into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
[42:02] and our Savior Jesus Christ." So the
[42:04] kingdom of God is actually ministered to
[42:07] you through the word of God.
[42:10] This is how we enter the kingdom. It's
[42:13] through the ministry of the word. In
[42:15] other words, the word of God, this Bible
[42:19] here, this is letter form of the
[42:22] kingdom.
[42:25] But you could know this Bible inside and
[42:28] out, quote everything, have it all in
[42:31] your head
[42:32] and your nature never be changed
[42:35] and you would never enter the kingdom.
[42:38] So what happens is that this word when
[42:41] it's preached to us, it has to literally
[42:44] excite us.
[42:47] It has to be real to us. And I want
[42:50] that. I I want that in me.
[42:53] And when your desire for God is for what
[42:57] God's will is for your life, then it
[43:00] comes inside of you. It is that simple.
[43:02] God is trying to get us
[43:06] where our freemore agency wants what he
[43:08] wants.
[43:11] It's you don't got to, you know, learn a
[43:14] lot of quotes or
[43:17] you you have to have a desire for God's
[43:19] will. And so in simplicity, when we come
[43:22] to church, what God is really doing at
[43:24] church, he's showing you how to enter
[43:26] in. No matter where you're at,
[43:30] where you're at in entering in, he's
[43:32] trying to show you how to enter in. The
[43:34] ministry of the word opens the door to
[43:37] the kingdom.
[43:40] Luke 17:20. Um, and when he was demanded
[43:44] of the Pharisees, this is going to be a
[43:46] simple subject, so it should be easy to
[43:48] follow along. And when if you have a
[43:51] hard time following along, the best
[43:52] thing to do is stare at the preacher
[43:56] and say amen.
[43:58] You got to say amen. You just can't
[44:00] stare. You could fall asleep, right? You
[44:02] Anybody ever fall asleep watching a
[44:03] movie,
[44:05] but try saying amen. Amen every
[44:09] couple minutes when you're watching a
[44:10] movie. That'll keep you awake.
[44:15] You don't have to say, "Wow, this is a
[44:16] good movie." Because usually when you're
[44:17] falling asleep, it's pretty boring. Or
[44:19] you're tired. one of the two.
[44:22] And when he was demanded of the
[44:23] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[44:25] come, he answered them said, "The
[44:27] kingdom of God cometh not with
[44:30] observations.
[44:32] Neither shall they say, lo, here or
[44:34] there, behold, the kingdom of God is
[44:36] within you." So the the word is
[44:39] ministered to you and you don't see it,
[44:45] but in your heart
[44:48] you say that's for me.
[44:50] And when you say it's for me, literally
[44:54] the kingdom of God is coming inside of
[44:56] every one of us.
[44:58] Even if we don't feel it
[45:02] because it's by faith. If we're sitting
[45:05] here today say that word is for me, then
[45:09] it will be a part of you. But if you
[45:11] hear the word and it just doesn't
[45:13] matter. You just say amen to it. But it
[45:15] really doesn't matter. If it comes
[45:17] inside of you, it won't come.
[45:20] You've got to blessed are they that
[45:23] hunger and thirst. They're the ones
[45:25] going to get filled with the kingdom.
[45:26] Amen.
[45:30] The kingdom of God is Jesus Christ. the
[45:34] word, the living word of God, the Holy
[45:36] Ghost, however you want to say that,
[45:38] they're all one.
[45:41] And what when it comes to the inside of
[45:42] the human heart, it it literally changes
[45:46] the nature of a man. And I hate to say,
[45:50] we don't have to worry about being shook
[45:52] up and uh dancing all over the place and
[45:55] having these feelings that we haven't
[45:57] had for a while. It has nothing to do
[45:59] with that.
[46:01] it. You know, when when Mary received
[46:04] the word which was Jesus Christ inside
[46:07] of her body, Brother Brandon said it
[46:09] came without sensation.
[46:12] The only thing she said, brother James,
[46:15] she said, "Be it unto me according to
[46:18] thy word."
[46:19] That's right.
[46:22] Because she didn't have to know a man.
[46:24] And we don't have to know a feeling to
[46:26] receive this kingdom. Right?
[46:28] We don't need to have a feeling, an
[46:30] emotion. What we have to have is faith.
[46:33] This word is for me, though none go with
[46:35] me still. I'll follow. I know that I'm
[46:38] here for a purpose, and I got to get
[46:39] more of God.
[46:43] 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "Therefore, if
[46:46] any man be in Christ, he is new.
[46:51] He's a new creature.
[46:53] He's just new.
[46:55] And old things are passed away. Behold,
[46:57] all things have become new. Now, we are
[46:59] somewhere in this category.
[47:02] We are in the category of that some
[47:05] things have been passed away and some
[47:09] things have become new.
[47:10] We're all there somewhere in that
[47:12] category.
[47:15] And we're striving to our life becomes
[47:18] all Christ
[47:20] to where our whole past is really all
[47:23] past.
[47:25] And individually, the more that we're
[47:27] hungering to become like Christ, the
[47:30] more we will become like Christ.
[47:33] The more that we just, well, I wish it
[47:35] would happen. I just God's got to do it
[47:36] because I'm not going to do it. You
[47:38] know, I mean, then it's not going to
[47:40] happen.
[47:42] God wants to give us, brother Ben said,
[47:45] the Holy Ghost more than we could
[47:48] possibly want it.
[47:51] So, a lot of times we're waiting on God
[47:53] to make us feel like it and, you know,
[47:55] make us feel like shouting, make us feel
[47:57] like stop doing bad things or, you know,
[47:59] start, you know, praising him or
[48:01] worshiping in church. We're waiting for
[48:03] God to make us feel like it.
[48:07] And God says, I I'm I'm here wanting it.
[48:10] I I deserve your praise.
[48:13] It it's it's it's up to us to give God
[48:16] what he's worthy of or to sit and feel
[48:18] like I don't feel like doing it.
[48:21] And and it's hard to, you know, Bible
[48:23] says it's hard to please God without
[48:24] faith.
[48:25] Impossible.
[48:28] Now, the problem with a lot of believers
[48:30] is that they only enter the kingdom and
[48:33] never
[48:35] continue on.
[48:38] In other words, they may got baptized.
[48:41] They they may have repented and they may
[48:44] started taking some steps and then they
[48:47] feel this um comfort uh of of I'm I'm
[48:52] in.
[48:54] So there's no need to get, you know, I'm
[48:56] not really called for anything,
[48:59] you know, I can't really be a part of
[49:01] the church. I I don't I don't got no
[49:03] talent. I I I you know I I just I I'm in
[49:08] I'm just kind of
[49:11] and then the interest becomes back in
[49:13] the world of of building a life and and
[49:16] and um you know you know getting a
[49:19] greenhouse
[49:21] and uh
[49:24] and before you know it, you know, we
[49:26] could have two or three houses.
[49:29] We could be pursuing a lot of different
[49:31] things. And there's nothing wrong with
[49:32] the green houses. There's nothing wrong
[49:34] with having two houses or three boats.
[49:38] It is not for me to say it's too much to
[49:40] have too much. It's not for me to say
[49:42] that.
[49:43] What I am here to say is it's very easy
[49:46] to not be pressing into the kingdom of
[49:48] God.
[49:50] And that's exactly what Satan wants us
[49:53] to uh to to do is not get that serious
[49:57] about it. But the kingdom comes in our
[50:00] hearts in three separate measures. I'm
[50:02] going to read about that here in a
[50:04] second. But remember, it's not just,
[50:06] well, you know, I I repented and got
[50:08] baptized, I'm in the kingdom. Get away
[50:10] from that thought because it comes in
[50:12] three measures. And you you you've got
[50:14] to get all of it.
[50:16] You've got to get all of it. First
[50:18] Thessalonians 2:12 says, "That ye walk
[50:20] worthy of God, who have called you into
[50:23] his kingdom and glory." And I'm sorry
[50:25] some of these scriptures aren't up on
[50:27] the board, but
[50:30] God has called us into his kingdom, but
[50:31] he says you got to walk worthy of it.
[50:34] Even though it's father's good pleasure
[50:36] to give you the kingdom, you got to walk
[50:37] worthy of it. This is the first thing
[50:39] that we're taking a thought of and and
[50:41] and Jesus speaking here in Luke 9:62, if
[50:44] you want to write it in, says, "No man
[50:46] having his hand uh put his hand to the
[50:50] plow and look it back is fit for the
[50:52] kingdom of God." In other words, if you
[50:54] start, you get baptized, you start in
[50:56] with Christ, but you don't keep going.
[50:58] Jesus said you are not fit for the
[51:00] kingdom.
[51:02] Even though Jesus said it's the father's
[51:05] good pleasure to give you the kingdom,
[51:07] it is it is the good pleasure of our
[51:11] father to give us the kingdom. But we
[51:14] still have to take the kingdom.
[51:16] It's just like the children of Israel,
[51:18] they were given the promised land, but
[51:20] they had to take it.
[51:22] It's no different.
[51:25] I'd like to read if we could pull this
[51:26] one up on on the we're going to we're
[51:29] going to forget Matthew and pull up Luke
[51:31] 13:20.
[51:33] You want to write this down.
[51:36] Luke 13:20.
[51:38] And again, Jesus said, "Where unto shall
[51:43] I liken the kingdom of God?" It's the
[51:48] father's good pleasure to give you the
[51:49] kingdom. So, what's the kingdom?
[51:51] What do I liken it to?
[51:54] In verse 21, it is like leavenan,
[51:59] which a woman took and hid in three
[52:04] measures of meal to the whole
[52:09] was leaven.
[52:11] So it's it's it's in three parts and
[52:16] it's hid.
[52:18] Jesus hid the kingdom in three measures,
[52:22] three parts. So it's not as simple as
[52:25] just, well, I repented, I got baptized,
[52:27] I should be good.
[52:29] Now, how many knows what the three
[52:31] measures are? Let me just see your
[52:32] hands.
[52:35] Well, I am so glad that we're all here
[52:37] today because we're going to learn what
[52:39] the three measures are.
[52:42] The first measure is justification.
[52:48] Yeah, if you get the first one, you get
[52:49] the second, the third,
[52:51] sanctification and the baptism of the
[52:54] Holy Ghost. And you understand you can't
[52:57] be whole with justification.
[53:00] Jesus said right here, um, he hid the
[53:03] three measures of meal till the whole
[53:06] was leaven. We need all three all three
[53:10] to to enter in
[53:12] flesh and blood. You get you can repent,
[53:15] get baptized, and if it's still flesh
[53:17] and blood, you never go on to get the
[53:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You can enter
[53:21] in because Jesus himself said, um, you
[53:25] must be born again.
[53:27] So, what is born again? That's that
[53:29] nature has to be changed. It has to.
[53:33] And it doesn't change after death.
[53:37] It doesn't change after death. It
[53:40] changes beforehand. So the kingdom comes
[53:43] into our hearts. Three separate
[53:45] measures. Brother Brandham said the
[53:46] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[53:48] and the earthly bride. He says now he
[53:50] called the church through
[53:52] sanctification. No, I'm sorry. He called
[53:55] the church through justification. He
[53:58] called it through sanctification.
[54:00] Then filled it with the Holy Ghost and
[54:03] fire.
[54:04] And he took it through a process
[54:09] that he himself, the Holy Spirit, the
[54:11] son of God, could dwell in the human
[54:14] heart.
[54:15] Now, it has to go through that before he
[54:19] can come into it.
[54:22] A lot of times, you know, you know,
[54:24] people get caught up in the spirit and
[54:27] certain things happen and they think
[54:28] they got God. Like where do you get
[54:32] where do you where what about the person
[54:35] where he's evil, right? The the rain
[54:38] falls on the just and the unjust. He
[54:40] makes the sun to rise on the good and
[54:42] the evil. So God has the ability to
[54:45] bless even his enemy. He's so full of
[54:47] love
[54:49] and he could rejoice. And brother
[54:51] Brandham says the you know the the the
[54:53] cockabers they they rejoice and you know
[54:55] the the rain the showers of blessing and
[54:58] the sun is out we're growing
[55:01] just like the wheat.
[55:04] So it's not about having some past
[55:06] experience that doesn't even say
[55:08] anything.
[55:10] What matters is that we're growing in
[55:12] the word.
[55:13] Amen.
[55:13] We're growing. So God has given us a
[55:17] five-fold ministry that ministers an
[55:20] entrance into the kingdom.
[55:23] And Jesus said we we you know he that
[55:26] has ears to hear, let him hear. We still
[55:28] have to have ears to hear what the
[55:31] ministry is actually speaking. That's
[55:33] why we got to come and we got to be
[55:35] prepared for the word. So the five-fold
[55:38] ministry is preaching. Now, I want us to
[55:40] catch this. It is preaching the message
[55:43] of the hour.
[55:45] Amen.
[55:47] We can't preach Noah's message. It's in
[55:49] the Bible, but we can't preach it.
[55:51] We I I can't tell you. You know what you
[55:53] need to do? You need to go home and you
[55:55] need to start building an ark.
[55:58] And every time you come to church for
[56:01] 125 years, go home and get that ark.
[56:04] Build it. This is how you build it. It
[56:07] wouldn't work, would it?
[56:09] This is not it's it's not going to rain.
[56:12] It's not going to flood anymore. I mean,
[56:13] we had some rain today, but it's not
[56:15] going to flood. It's going to burn
[56:19] because you've got to know where you're
[56:20] at for the hour.
[56:22] We can't be preaching uh Moses's
[56:25] message. We can't be preaching uh uh
[56:29] Martin Luther's message
[56:33] or or or Luther or or or or Wesley's
[56:36] message. We have to preach the message
[56:38] for this hour. And this hour is the only
[56:42] hour that has all the truth.
[56:45] That's right.
[56:47] So that's why a lot of people don't stay
[56:49] in the message when they come.
[56:51] They want to be in a church where they
[56:52] can feel comfortable just believing part
[56:54] of the word.
[56:58] But in the days of the voice of the
[57:01] seventh angel, when he shall begin the
[57:04] sound, the mystery of God should be
[57:06] finished. In other words, this ministry
[57:09] in this hour preaches a ministry of
[57:12] perfection.
[57:13] Amen.
[57:14] Because it's bringing a bride to
[57:16] perfection. And it's hard. It's not
[57:19] easy.
[57:20] How many has got a high standard? Let me
[57:23] see your hand. in something in something
[57:25] you got a high standard. So, so our
[57:28] sister Gabrielle here, so if if she goes
[57:31] to clean a house, she wants to make sure
[57:34] that she has workers there that's going
[57:37] to be to her standard.
[57:40] And if they're not to her standard,
[57:42] they're not going to last. Is that true
[57:44] statement?
[57:47] I mean, you should be saying at least
[57:48] amen. I mean, or or Brother Dennis. I
[57:53] mean, if we're going to all go work for
[57:54] Brother Dennis and push the lawnmower,
[57:56] we can't have six inches of tall grass
[57:59] in between each row.
[58:01] It ain't We ain't going to We ain't
[58:03] going to stick because he's got a high
[58:05] standard. It's got to look good for the
[58:07] customer.
[58:09] God's got a high standard. It's called
[58:10] perfection.
[58:12] He let us go on to perfection.
[58:15] Laying is laying aside this other stuff.
[58:18] get your mind on what the next thing you
[58:20] need to be doing.
[58:21] And and when you come to church, God's
[58:23] speaking to you personally, you just got
[58:25] to be, listen, God, I'm here. I want to
[58:27] hear what you got to say. You can't be
[58:29] wondering over here and wondering over
[58:30] there and your thoughts are over here
[58:31] and expect to hear from God. It don't
[58:33] work like that.
[58:35] Did you ever watch a movie, but you
[58:37] weren't paying attention?
[58:39] And then you wonder why something
[58:40] happened.
[58:42] Can you go back? Can we redo? No.
[58:46] Look, we we got one chance to get out of
[58:49] here.
[58:52] I remember brother Johnson saying
[58:55] years ago, even if somebody doesn't come
[58:58] to church and the word is being
[59:00] preached, God will hold that person
[59:01] accountable because they should have
[59:03] been there at their post of duty.
[59:05] It's a serious thing because the
[59:07] ministry is getting us into the kingdom.
[59:10] We we can't be just looking at I I I
[59:12] I've repented. had been baptized and saw
[59:15] him in.
[59:20] We can't do that. Don't do that.
[59:23] We've got to we've got to press in
[59:27] now. Even though God has given us the
[59:29] kingdom, we got to fight.
[59:31] We got to fight our way into it.
[59:33] Yes, sir.
[59:34] Luke 16:16 says, "The law and the
[59:37] prophets were until John.
[59:40] But since that time, the kingdom of God
[59:43] is preached, right? It's ministered
[59:47] and every man press into it.
[59:51] So that would be like you saying when
[59:54] you hear the word preached, that would
[59:56] be like you saying, "Amen, Lord. That's
[59:58] what I want for my life."
[1:00:02] That is how you press into it.
[1:00:04] You You leave church thinking about what
[1:00:07] was preached on. Yes.
[1:00:09] How many times have we heard our our
[1:00:11] brother Bruce uh when he closed in
[1:00:14] prayer, Lord, deal with our hearts with
[1:00:17] what was been preached.
[1:00:19] When we leave, deal with our hearts. And
[1:00:22] and and we we've heard brother Bman say
[1:00:25] how good it is when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:00:28] and brings a conviction.
[1:00:30] And I mean, this is what we need to
[1:00:33] grow,
[1:00:35] to become the word, to become the
[1:00:37] kingdom. You're literally becoming the
[1:00:38] kingdom. You understand that God is
[1:00:40] going to actually use you to live in.
[1:00:43] That's the truth.
[1:00:44] You are going to become the house of
[1:00:47] God.
[1:00:50] You're the new Jerusalem.
[1:00:54] So, we have to press our way all the way
[1:00:57] into perfection. Not just starting,
[1:01:01] but press. Paul said, "I count not
[1:01:04] myself to have apprehended. I count not
[1:01:06] myself as though I've already attained
[1:01:09] or either were already perfect, but I
[1:01:11] pressed toward the mark for the prize of
[1:01:14] the high calling of Christ Jesus. So
[1:01:16] Paul had a revelation that he just
[1:01:18] wasn't in the kingdom because he
[1:01:20] repented and got baptized.
[1:01:22] And he didn't look at his job, well,
[1:01:24] yeah, I'm in the kingdom and I just got
[1:01:26] to preach it to others. No, he's saying,
[1:01:28] I'm one of the lay men. I have to press
[1:01:30] my way in.
[1:01:32] I I can't take a vacation.
[1:01:36] I got to keep God with me.
[1:01:39] Amen. Brother John.
[1:01:42] Acts 14:22
[1:01:45] says that confirming the souls of the
[1:01:47] disciples and exhorting them to continue
[1:01:49] in the faith. It's not up on the board,
[1:01:51] but you can write it down. Part I want
[1:01:53] to get to is right here. That we must
[1:01:56] through
[1:01:58] much tribulation
[1:02:00] enter the kingdom of God. So even though
[1:02:02] it's given to us, the kingdom is given
[1:02:05] to us,
[1:02:06] the only way that we're going to enter
[1:02:08] in is through much tribulation.
[1:02:12] It's not easy. Why? Because the devil is
[1:02:17] standing trying to get us. And I
[1:02:18] remember when I was in the world and I
[1:02:20] was listening to Stairway to Heaven. I
[1:02:22] wasn't even spiritual, but I could
[1:02:23] figure that one out.
[1:02:26] The devil don't want me to go to heaven.
[1:02:30] He's standing in the way, keeping me.
[1:02:34] And at that time, he was just enticing
[1:02:36] me with everything that I could possibly
[1:02:39] want,
[1:02:41] just giving me whatever I wanted.
[1:02:45] Luke 18:24. And when Jesus saw,
[1:02:50] talking about the rich young ruler, he
[1:02:53] was very sorrowful. He said, "How hardly
[1:02:55] shall they that have riches
[1:02:58] enter into the kingdom of God?"
[1:03:02] In other words, they may start, they may
[1:03:03] repent, they may get baptized, they may
[1:03:05] start, but soon as they get riches, they
[1:03:08] get their mind off of what they need to
[1:03:10] be doing.
[1:03:11] Jesus himself said, "How hardly, there
[1:03:14] ain't too many rich people, they're
[1:03:15] going to make it."
[1:03:16] Not saying there's not. I mean, Abraham
[1:03:18] was rich, but he hid the character. But
[1:03:21] he's he's making a statement that
[1:03:22] there's things that get in the way if
[1:03:25] it's not tested. The Satan will use the
[1:03:28] blessings that God gives you to keep you
[1:03:30] from church.
[1:03:32] All of a sudden, you're getting so
[1:03:33] blessed and so busy, you don't even got
[1:03:35] time.
[1:03:37] Satan knows how
[1:03:40] to make it hard for us.
[1:03:42] Matthew 11:12, Jesus speaking. He says,
[1:03:45] "And from the days of John the Baptist
[1:03:47] until now, the kingdom of heaven
[1:03:49] suffereth violence,
[1:03:53] and the violent taketh it by force."
[1:03:56] Amen.
[1:03:57] So God gives us the kingdom, and there's
[1:03:59] turbulence. There's shaking. You've been
[1:04:01] in a plane before, or some of you have
[1:04:03] been in a plane before and you went
[1:04:05] through some turbulent area,
[1:04:07] right? And the pilot says,
[1:04:12] he turns on the fasten the seat belt
[1:04:14] sign
[1:04:16] and he says, "Uh, please go to your
[1:04:19] seat." And you're in your seat. And I
[1:04:21] mean, there's been times that we
[1:04:23] wondered,
[1:04:25] we wondered
[1:04:27] if this is it.
[1:04:30] You get the thought.
[1:04:32] Look, there's times we wonder, are we in
[1:04:34] the kingdom?
[1:04:36] Are we where we need to be?
[1:04:38] Amen.
[1:04:38] Am I going to make it?
[1:04:41] Because there's a there's a there's a
[1:04:43] turbulence, a spiritual turbulence. The
[1:04:45] devil I told the that the in the men's
[1:04:47] being the devil comes to church, too.
[1:04:50] He's trying to keep us from he wants us
[1:04:52] our minds to be somewhere else.
[1:04:54] He wants us ditto down around our
[1:04:56] thoughts going here and there and not
[1:04:58] even paying attention to the word.
[1:05:02] But God's trying to minister an entrance
[1:05:05] into that kingdom for us.
[1:05:10] Did you ever have a hard time? You came
[1:05:13] to church, but you had literally a hard
[1:05:15] time of entering into the word.
[1:05:20] I'm sure we all have. When that happens,
[1:05:25] we can say the devil did his job good.
[1:05:31] Now, I believe that if we do our part,
[1:05:35] which is prepare,
[1:05:37] we're coming for the battle.
[1:05:39] We're, you know, we're right there. The
[1:05:40] devil's going to give us thoughts about,
[1:05:42] you know, where are we eating after
[1:05:44] church?
[1:05:46] You know, what are we doing this week?
[1:05:48] Or, you know, what's going to happen? Or
[1:05:52] is it nine o'clock yet? Right.
[1:05:57] And and we're not prepared. If we're not
[1:05:59] prepared, we get sucked in. But if we're
[1:06:01] prepared, we knock those off.
[1:06:03] And we're we know that we're here for a
[1:06:05] reason. We're going to receive what we
[1:06:07] can receive from God.
[1:06:10] God has given us the kingdom, but the
[1:06:12] devil fights against us from entering
[1:06:14] into more. So, we have to fight for what
[1:06:17] God has given to us. He's rightfully
[1:06:20] given us the kingdom, but we have to
[1:06:22] fight for it because the devil is not
[1:06:24] wanting us to take it. So, we have to be
[1:06:27] forceful. We, in other, how do I be
[1:06:30] forceful in church?
[1:06:33] Because we're just going to like kind of
[1:06:34] get down to earth on this.
[1:06:36] This is a simple subject.
[1:06:39] How do how do we how do we get forceful?
[1:06:42] How how we get forceful is don't be
[1:06:44] laxidasical.
[1:06:46] Don't lay back. Don't act like there
[1:06:49] isn't much you need to do that you're
[1:06:51] okay.
[1:06:53] We got to fight the good fight of faith.
[1:06:55] We got to lay hold, the Bible says, of
[1:06:57] of eternal lay hold of the word that's
[1:07:00] being ministered by God to you today. He
[1:07:04] may use any old vessel that he wants to
[1:07:07] use. That's up to God. But he'll use
[1:07:09] that vessel and he'll speak to you so
[1:07:12] you have a chance to enter in.
[1:07:16] Now, how do we get it?
[1:07:20] How do we how do we make sure that we're
[1:07:24] entering into the kingdom?
[1:07:27] Make God a priority.
[1:07:31] Don't try to fit God into your life. Fit
[1:07:33] God into your schedule. Fit God into
[1:07:36] your busyiness. Fit God into No. Make
[1:07:39] him a priority.
[1:07:41] And the scripture for that is Matthew
[1:07:43] 6:33. But seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:07:47] God,
[1:07:48] and his
[1:07:50] his righteousness, and all these things
[1:07:52] shall be added to you. So we literally,
[1:07:54] if you're really going to receive the
[1:07:56] kingdom of God, you got to you got to
[1:07:57] want it first.
[1:08:00] You got to seek it. Seek for the very
[1:08:04] kingdom of God that he has given you to
[1:08:07] come inside of you.
[1:08:09] It takes time to seek God.
[1:08:14] Okay. Is it easier, just be honest, is
[1:08:16] it easier to go through the m McDonald's
[1:08:20] drive-thru
[1:08:22] or is it easier to make a healthy five
[1:08:27] course meal at home?
[1:08:31] Okay. So, and so you understand that the
[1:08:35] devil is wanting you to come to church
[1:08:40] with the attitude of of a drive-thru.
[1:08:45] All I got to do is just go there, show
[1:08:47] up,
[1:08:48] hear the and and I got I I did my what I
[1:08:52] needed to do.
[1:08:54] And and we don't really receive the
[1:08:56] nutrients.
[1:08:58] I mean, because if you eat McDonald's
[1:09:00] all the time, what's going to happen?
[1:09:02] you're going to look like me.
[1:09:05] I shouldn't say that because that would
[1:09:07] be saying the show's not making good
[1:09:08] dinners and know that and I never meant
[1:09:11] it like that. I just didn't want to
[1:09:12] point I wanted to put the blame on me
[1:09:14] and not nobody else. I just should have
[1:09:16] said Bob here or something. You know, I
[1:09:19] always get myself in trouble. But the
[1:09:21] Bible says they that wait upon the Lord
[1:09:23] shall renew their strength. It takes
[1:09:25] time to seek the Lord.
[1:09:28] Now, this word seek, but seek ye first
[1:09:31] the kingdom of God, what it means is to
[1:09:33] worship. If you look it up, it means
[1:09:35] specifically to worship God, to desire
[1:09:38] God, to endeavor, to inquire, to require
[1:09:42] it for your life. That's what it means.
[1:09:47] And when the word is being ministered,
[1:09:49] the entrance to the kingdom is being
[1:09:51] brought before you. And at that point,
[1:09:53] the devil is going to distract you from
[1:09:56] entering into the word, and you just got
[1:09:58] to lay hold of it. Like, you ever get
[1:10:01] sick and tired of not trying hard enough
[1:10:03] at church?
[1:10:06] Yeah.
[1:10:08] Yeah. And and that's what you got to do
[1:10:10] because it's it's not your heart to not
[1:10:13] care.
[1:10:15] It it's a trick of the enemy.
[1:10:19] But the thing is, we have to do our part
[1:10:22] in order to get into the kingdom
[1:10:25] because flesh and blood will not enter
[1:10:28] the kingdom. We've got we've got to
[1:10:30] receive the aggra word. We've got to
[1:10:32] hunger for it. You know, to me, it would
[1:10:35] be better to say amen too much to help
[1:10:38] you enter in.
[1:10:39] Amen. Yeah,
[1:10:40] it's true.
[1:10:42] You You need something to help you to
[1:10:46] get where you got to get to
[1:10:48] because we we got to get past just
[1:10:51] making it to church. I mean, even though
[1:10:54] you know you're here with good
[1:10:55] intentions, sometimes we don't prepare.
[1:10:59] You know, we don't get enough rest. We
[1:11:01] don't we don't spend enough time in
[1:11:02] prayer. We're not in the spirit and
[1:11:04] we're just kind of here. And that's not
[1:11:07] gonna that that you're going to miss
[1:11:08] what God wants you to do.
[1:11:11] Lukeap 11 verse 5. Lukeap 11 verse 5. If
[1:11:15] you could turn there if you got a Bible
[1:11:16] because we're going to read some verses
[1:11:18] here.
[1:11:21] Which of you shall have a friend
[1:11:25] and shall go unto him at midnight
[1:11:29] and say unto him, Friend,
[1:11:34] lend me, notice three loaves.
[1:11:39] For a friend of mine is in his journey,
[1:11:42] is come to me, and I have nothing to set
[1:11:46] before him.
[1:11:49] and he from within the other person he's
[1:11:52] talking to shall answer and say,
[1:11:54] "Trouble me not. The door is now shut.
[1:11:57] My children are in bed with me. I cannot
[1:12:00] rise and give to thee."
[1:12:02] So, he's got this feeling inside. What
[1:12:05] are you bothering me so late at night
[1:12:07] for?
[1:12:12] Nobody wants to get woken up and and
[1:12:14] deal with something like this.
[1:12:16] Look what Jesus said. Now I say unto
[1:12:18] you, though he will not rise and give
[1:12:22] him,
[1:12:24] but because he is his friend,
[1:12:28] and yet because of his inortunity,
[1:12:32] which means persistence,
[1:12:34] he will rise and give him as many as he
[1:12:38] needeth.
[1:12:41] That's why you go to a friend when you
[1:12:44] need something.
[1:12:47] And you you you have to be persistent.
[1:12:50] You have to be I God, I am here. I need
[1:12:53] to enter into the kingdom. You're my
[1:12:56] friend.
[1:12:57] That's right.
[1:13:01] And Jesus said, "Ask and it shall be
[1:13:05] given you.
[1:13:07] Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[1:13:10] shall be open unto you."
[1:13:13] The whole premises
[1:13:16] is to be persistent in your asking, in
[1:13:18] your seeking, in your knocking.
[1:13:21] You can't just, oh, I plopped into
[1:13:23] church.
[1:13:25] No, I am pressing in. I am asking. I am
[1:13:29] seeking. I want more of the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:36] Jesus said, for everyone, that includes
[1:13:38] you. Now it includes everybody here. For
[1:13:42] everyone that askketh receiveth,
[1:13:46] he that seeketh findeth and him that
[1:13:49] knockketh it shall be open.
[1:13:51] And he leaves with this. He wants to
[1:13:53] increase our faith. And he says here, if
[1:13:56] a son shall ask bread of any of you that
[1:13:59] is a father,
[1:14:02] will he give him a stone?
[1:14:05] Or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish
[1:14:08] give him a serpent?
[1:14:10] Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give
[1:14:13] him a scorpion?
[1:14:15] Well, the answer is no. No, no, no, no,
[1:14:18] no way. And then he says, if then if you
[1:14:23] then being an evil, in other words, your
[1:14:26] nature
[1:14:26] Yes, sir.
[1:14:27] is evil.
[1:14:29] And with a evil nature,
[1:14:32] you would not do that harm to your
[1:14:34] children. How much more shall your
[1:14:36] heavenly father give you the Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] by just asking, by seeking? God wants to
[1:14:43] give us the Holy Ghost. But the problem
[1:14:45] is we're not seeking enough. We're not
[1:14:47] wanting enough. We don't we're not
[1:14:49] crying enough. We're not we're not
[1:14:50] worshiping God enough.
[1:14:53] We just like I just make it to church
[1:14:55] barely.
[1:14:57] This only got time to do this. We got to
[1:15:00] enter in with much much tribulation,
[1:15:03] much persistence. We got to be
[1:15:05] persistent.
[1:15:09] Can't be double-minded.
[1:15:11] We got to keep the vision with with our
[1:15:14] prayers. We got to ask in faith, ask in
[1:15:16] confidence. We know God cannot lie.
[1:15:20] I think we just want to we want to
[1:15:22] become more humble, more sincere.
[1:15:27] God will give us the grace. Philippians
[1:15:30] 1:6, "Be confident of this one thing,
[1:15:32] that he which had begun a good work, he
[1:15:33] shall perform it unto the day of Jesus
[1:15:36] Christ."
[1:15:37] Amen.
[1:15:37] We just need to keep on keeping on.
[1:15:41] And and we can't keep on just coming to
[1:15:44] church.
[1:15:46] We We got to worship God the way the
[1:15:49] Bible teaches us. We got to seek the
[1:15:51] kingdom the way the Bible teaches us. We
[1:15:54] don't want to plow any new trails and
[1:15:56] and and and and have our own religion.
[1:15:59] We want the Bible religion, old time
[1:16:01] religion.
[1:16:04] Luke 13:8.
[1:16:07] Then said Jesus,
[1:16:09] unto what is the kingdom of God like,
[1:16:14] and where to shall I resemble it? Jesus
[1:16:18] is asking this question. And then he
[1:16:20] said, "It is like a grain of mustard
[1:16:24] seed." Now, I'm sorry. I I if you
[1:16:27] wouldn't mind set that that up there.
[1:16:31] Um No. Well, you don't. Yeah. I'm sorry.
[1:16:34] Some of these are just not up there, and
[1:16:35] we just got to go with it. It is like a
[1:16:38] grain of mustard seed which a man took
[1:16:40] and cast it into the garden his garden
[1:16:42] and it grew and it waxed a great tree
[1:16:45] and the fowls of the air lodged in it
[1:16:47] and uh in the branches of it and lodged
[1:16:51] in the branches of it. So God, Jesus
[1:16:54] himself is saying, what he is expressing
[1:16:58] to us what this kingdom of God is going
[1:17:00] to be like when it comes into you,
[1:17:02] right? It's coming without observation.
[1:17:04] It's being ministered unto you. And it
[1:17:06] it comes I like a a small mustard seed.
[1:17:13] We all know
[1:17:15] it's small, right? Matthew 13:31.
[1:17:18] Matthew 13:31. Another parable putting
[1:17:20] forth, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is
[1:17:22] likened to a grain of mustard seed,
[1:17:24] which a man took and sowed in his field,
[1:17:26] which indeed is the least of all seeds,
[1:17:28] but when it is growing, it is the
[1:17:31] greatest among herbs and becometh a
[1:17:35] tree, so that the birds of the air come
[1:17:38] and lodge in the branches thereof." Now,
[1:17:40] this is what happens when you come to
[1:17:42] church and you say, "Amen to the word. I
[1:17:45] receive that word into my heart." It's a
[1:17:48] real little thing, but if you keep it,
[1:17:50] you believe it, it's going to grow big
[1:17:53] that other people are going to benefit
[1:17:54] from your life.
[1:18:01] It starts out real small. The kingdom of
[1:18:03] God starts out small.
[1:18:08] You believe one thing and it grows
[1:18:12] and you believe another and it grows and
[1:18:14] it it just keeps producing over and
[1:18:17] over. We got a little uh tree that can't
[1:18:21] even remember the tree right now that we
[1:18:24] got from up north, but we brought it
[1:18:26] down from Cheryl's parents.
[1:18:30] Huh?
[1:18:32] What kind?
[1:18:34] No. Yeah, the rubber. No, it's not that
[1:18:36] one. So, the one at the at the driveway,
[1:18:38] the Mount Nash
[1:18:40] and uh it's got a beautiful like orange
[1:18:43] berries and it was just a little thing
[1:18:44] like this and it's grown now. And it
[1:18:47] just it just keeps producing.
[1:18:50] And that's what the word does. You keep
[1:18:52] giving it water, you give it sun, and it
[1:18:54] grows. It it ju it just grows.
[1:18:58] Jesus said, "I have many things to say
[1:19:01] unto you, but you can't bear it now.
[1:19:02] It's going to take time. The Holy Ghost
[1:19:04] is going to come. Peter said it like
[1:19:06] this. Giving all diligence, add to your
[1:19:08] faith, virtue, virtue, knowledge,
[1:19:10] knowledge, temperance, add. See, you're
[1:19:13] adding. You're growing.
[1:19:15] This kingdom of God grows. It isn't
[1:19:18] something like you repent, you baptize,
[1:19:21] you say you believe, and you're in the
[1:19:22] kingdom. That is nonsense.
[1:19:27] How many people are going to miss that?
[1:19:30] The meaning behind that is much greater.
[1:19:32] You can't take those se those scriptures
[1:19:35] and leave out the rest of the Bible.
[1:19:40] You take the rest of the Bible, then
[1:19:42] that's a true true statement.
[1:19:46] You've got to keep adding this. Jesus
[1:19:48] himself said, "I will liken it onto a
[1:19:51] mustard seed that it just grows, grows,
[1:19:53] grows." That it just doesn't repent,
[1:19:56] baptize, and it stays right there.
[1:20:00] That's not the parable he gave.
[1:20:03] If we're not growing, we're stunt.
[1:20:06] I'm going to tell you what happens when
[1:20:08] a baby is inside of a woman. If it stops
[1:20:10] growing, what happens?
[1:20:15] We as Christians, we can't stop growing.
[1:20:18] Find something to do for Jesus. Find
[1:20:20] something to do for the church. Find
[1:20:23] somebody to pray for.
[1:20:25] Grow, grow, grow. Because we don't have
[1:20:27] much time left.
[1:20:30] 1 Peter 2:1
[1:20:33] Peter speaking wherefore laying aside
[1:20:36] this is what you how you grow lay aside
[1:20:39] all malice all guile I hypocrisies envo
[1:20:43] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[1:20:46] sinc milk of the word that ye may grow
[1:20:51] thereby
[1:20:54] what I love about this this growing
[1:20:56] process of this mustard seed that just
[1:20:58] grows and so big and a tree and the the
[1:21:01] birds come. It don't happen without you
[1:21:05] laying aside what God tells you to lay
[1:21:07] aside when you come to church.
[1:21:12] Your heart has to be in the word.
[1:21:15] And when you're willing to give up the
[1:21:17] things that God tells you to give up,
[1:21:19] you know, then you you you you can let
[1:21:22] that word begin to grow in your life
[1:21:25] because
[1:21:27] God wants to know how sincere we are.
[1:21:31] You say you want God, you want the
[1:21:33] kingdom, you want to go to heaven, then
[1:21:35] what are you going to what are you going
[1:21:36] to give up?
[1:21:37] What are you going to do? Are you just
[1:21:39] going to serve God your way? Nobody's
[1:21:41] going to tell you what to do. Is that
[1:21:43] the attitude you're going to have?
[1:21:44] You're not going to make it because God
[1:21:47] puts everybody to the place where you
[1:21:49] you have to lay aside everything that he
[1:21:52] tells you to lay aside.
[1:21:56] God has given us the kingdom, but we
[1:21:58] need to grow in it. And there is a major
[1:22:02] major part that we play and that's
[1:22:05] called obedience.
[1:22:07] We just can't be a hearer of the word
[1:22:08] but a doer of the word. The Bible says,
[1:22:10] "This man shall be blessed in his deed."
[1:22:14] Malachi 4:2 says, "But unto you that
[1:22:18] fear my name,"
[1:22:20] that's the key right there, fear, the
[1:22:23] reverence, "You that reverence my name,
[1:22:27] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:22:29] with healing in his wings,
[1:22:32] and you shall go forth and grow as
[1:22:35] calves of the stall.
[1:22:39] If you want to grow in Christ, you want
[1:22:41] to be a real solid Christian, fear the
[1:22:43] Lord.
[1:22:44] Amen.
[1:22:46] Fear the word. Reverence. If the prophet
[1:22:49] told you that this sanctuary needs to be
[1:22:52] kept holy unto the Lord, reverence that.
[1:22:57] Don't just pick and choose. I don't
[1:22:59] think I need to do that. No, you need to
[1:23:01] do that because if you want to grow, you
[1:23:04] got to follow the word.
[1:23:07] Now you're building your house upon the
[1:23:09] word of God, the solid rock.
[1:23:13] All other ground is sinking sand. Christ
[1:23:16] is building his kingdom upon the
[1:23:18] revealing of himself to you.
[1:23:22] Yes.
[1:23:23] In other words, if you don't get a
[1:23:24] revelation
[1:23:26] of him speaking to you,
[1:23:29] you're he's not building the church in
[1:23:31] you.
[1:23:34] That's why you have to be I got to hear
[1:23:36] from God.
[1:23:38] Because when you hear from God, that's
[1:23:40] him building his church in you.
[1:23:44] And the beautiful thing about is the
[1:23:45] gates of hell should not prevail against
[1:23:47] it.
[1:23:50] Hebrews 12 26. Hebrews chapter 12 26.
[1:23:54] You know, I didn't have many notes
[1:23:56] today.
[1:23:58] I thought, "Oh, for sure. We're just
[1:23:59] going to like get through this. We're
[1:24:01] going to let everybody out early.
[1:24:02] They're going to think something
[1:24:03] happened to me. Supernatural back there.
[1:24:08] And I'm just This is what happens when
[1:24:10] you take your time. Then you don't even
[1:24:11] get through what little you do have.
[1:24:14] Hebrews 12:26, whose voice then shook
[1:24:17] the earth, but now he had promised,
[1:24:19] saying, "Yet once more I shake not the
[1:24:22] earth only, but also heaven." And this
[1:24:25] word yet once signifying the removing of
[1:24:28] those things which things that are
[1:24:30] shaken. The removing of those things
[1:24:33] that are shaken as of the things that
[1:24:35] are made. But those things which cannot
[1:24:37] be shaken may remain. And those are the
[1:24:39] things of God. That's him revealing his
[1:24:41] word to you.
[1:24:44] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:24:48] cannot be moved.
[1:24:53] When he speaks his word, you can be as
[1:24:56] bold as a lion.
[1:25:00] But when you you haven't heard from God
[1:25:02] and you're just playing church,
[1:25:06] a test and trial is going to come
[1:25:08] and you're going to be shaken.
[1:25:11] So you got to know that you you and God
[1:25:13] are serious in the house of God, right?
[1:25:15] You're hearing from them. Wherefore we
[1:25:18] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:25:20] moved, let us have grace whereby we may
[1:25:23] serve God acceptably. And how is that?
[1:25:27] With reverence
[1:25:29] and godly fear. No messing around in
[1:25:31] church,
[1:25:32] right? For our God is a consuming fire.
[1:25:38] A consuming fire.
[1:25:40] All right. Ephesians chapter 3:4. So
[1:25:43] good to hear you say amen.
[1:25:46] I like to keep that up. That's
[1:25:47] encouraging. You know that. That
[1:25:48] encourages the preacher.
[1:25:51] Ephesians 3:14. For this cause I bow my
[1:25:54] knees unto the father of our lord Jesus
[1:25:57] Christ of whom the whole family is in
[1:25:59] heaven and earth is named that he may
[1:26:03] would grant you according to his riches
[1:26:06] of his glory to be strengthened with
[1:26:07] might by his spirit in the inner man
[1:26:10] that Christ may dwell here's the kingdom
[1:26:12] of God that Christ may dwell in your
[1:26:15] heart by faith
[1:26:17] being rooted and grounded
[1:26:23] So, we're talking about this tree, this
[1:26:26] kingdom. It's got to be rooted.
[1:26:29] It can't fall on stony ground.
[1:26:33] It can't amongst the thorns and thistles
[1:26:36] and uh by the wayside.
[1:26:39] It has to be on good ground and it has
[1:26:42] to get rooted. In other words, when you
[1:26:43] hear the word and you say, "Amen,"
[1:26:46] you're sincere and you mean it. Yes,
[1:26:49] you really really mean it. You want this
[1:26:51] for your life. You you you don't want
[1:26:53] to, you know, take the wrong road and
[1:26:55] and and and get mixed up with the wrong
[1:26:58] people. You want to stay with the word
[1:27:00] of God that Christ may dwell in your
[1:27:03] hearts by faith being rooted and
[1:27:05] grounded in love may be able to
[1:27:07] comprehend with all saints what is the
[1:27:10] breath. Thinking about this kingdom now,
[1:27:12] the breath, the length, the depth, the
[1:27:14] height, and to know the love of Christ
[1:27:19] which passes all knowledge that you
[1:27:21] might be filled with the fullness of
[1:27:23] God. This is the kingdom. It starts out
[1:27:26] with being rooted and grounded in
[1:27:28] Christ. And then it goes to the place
[1:27:32] that our lives are the fullness of
[1:27:34] Christ.
[1:27:36] So, we're not we don't stay down here
[1:27:38] with just being baptized. We're we're
[1:27:41] now growing into the fullness of Christ.
[1:27:44] So now we come to church for another
[1:27:45] reason.
[1:27:48] By by faith I'm saved. I'm sitting here
[1:27:51] as a as a believer saved by the grace of
[1:27:54] God. Now I'm here to get more than what
[1:27:57] I had when I came.
[1:28:00] I want to have the fullness. I want to
[1:28:02] have the next measure. I want to have
[1:28:04] what Christ has promised to give me when
[1:28:07] I come to church today. Amen.
[1:28:14] Now, unto him that is able to do
[1:28:17] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:28:21] would ask or think according to the
[1:28:24] power that workketh in us.
[1:28:27] I want you to feel the power. I want you
[1:28:30] to know the power that works in in you.
[1:28:32] You want to know what that you you can
[1:28:34] feel that power when you can say I
[1:28:36] believe.
[1:28:38] Amen.
[1:28:39] Amen. All right. Ephesians 4:15. We have
[1:28:42] to hurry now because we saw the piano
[1:28:45] player.
[1:28:47] That means time is near the end.
[1:28:50] Ephesians 4:15. Speaking the truth in
[1:28:54] love.
[1:28:57] May grow up into him in all things which
[1:29:02] is the head, even Christ. So the the
[1:29:04] kingdom of God, he's wanting us to all
[1:29:06] grow up. We can't just say, "Well, I'm
[1:29:08] not a preacher.
[1:29:12] I I don't play any of the instruments. I
[1:29:15] I I don't teach Sunday school. I I I I
[1:29:20] I'm not handling uh the things that an
[1:29:24] handles.
[1:29:26] We We can't say that.
[1:29:28] We have to become
[1:29:31] just like Jesus."
[1:29:34] So, we must take on the same
[1:29:37] the same responsibility of giving our
[1:29:39] best to God.
[1:29:42] I I love brother and sister Bman being
[1:29:44] at the door when when people come in and
[1:29:47] greet
[1:29:49] and and and be the face of the church,
[1:29:52] the hospitality, the love that's inside
[1:29:56] representing what's they can expect when
[1:29:59] they come inside the church.
[1:30:01] Amen. And there's something that we all
[1:30:03] could do if we just put our heart into
[1:30:07] it.
[1:30:09] Verse 16. From whom the whole body fitly
[1:30:13] joined together and compacted by that
[1:30:17] which every joint supplieth. Every one
[1:30:20] of you play a part according to the
[1:30:22] effectual working in the measure of
[1:30:24] every part. making look an increase of
[1:30:27] the body, a growing of the body unto the
[1:30:30] edifying of itself. How? In love. Not
[1:30:34] what you know.
[1:30:36] Not what you know, but it's how you
[1:30:39] love.
[1:30:41] It's how you manifest Christ to one
[1:30:43] another.
[1:30:45] That's how you edify one another.
[1:30:49] Oh, I love the word. Don't you?
[1:30:52] All right.
[1:30:54] Matthew 6:27.
[1:30:58] Is this hard to do? Is this Is this
[1:31:01] going to be hard?
[1:31:04] I don't think this is going to be hard.
[1:31:08] Matthew 6:27. Which of you by taking
[1:31:11] thought can add one cubic unto his
[1:31:13] statue?
[1:31:15] Not a one.
[1:31:18] And why take ye thought of for remnant?
[1:31:23] So I want you to think about the kingdom
[1:31:25] now coming inside of you and you
[1:31:28] entering the kingdom. Consider the liies
[1:31:31] of the field, how they grow. They toil
[1:31:35] not, neither do they spin. And yet I say
[1:31:38] unto you that even Solomon in all his
[1:31:40] glory was not a raid like one of these.
[1:31:44] I think it's real simple. Eat the word
[1:31:46] and it'll materialize in your life.
[1:31:51] God will do the work. You just say, "I
[1:31:53] believe the word. I really believe I'm
[1:31:55] going to go home and I'm going to apply
[1:31:57] this word in my home. I'm going to serve
[1:31:59] my mom. I'm going to serve my dad. I'm
[1:32:02] going to serve my husband. I'm going to
[1:32:03] serve my wife. I'm going to serve my
[1:32:05] children. I'm going to serve."
[1:32:09] I'm going to become the word.
[1:32:13] Now, the hard job for a parent is they
[1:32:15] have to make sure that the word
[1:32:19] is being lived in the home.
[1:32:25] Got to bring down the guillotine.
[1:32:28] The standard is right here. We're not
[1:32:30] doing this. We can do this, but we're
[1:32:32] not doing this.
[1:32:35] And that's a mother's love. That's a
[1:32:38] father's love right there.
[1:32:41] God loves us. We eat the invisible word
[1:32:44] and we grow into the very kingdom of
[1:32:46] God. Amen.
[1:32:49] Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:32:51] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:32:53] of God as a little child shall in no
[1:32:56] wise enter in.
[1:32:58] A little child doesn't know anything to
[1:33:00] do except believe.
[1:33:03] It doesn't understand.
[1:33:05] It just believes.
[1:33:07] And when we come to church, don't try to
[1:33:09] understand. Just believe.
[1:33:12] Trust God.
[1:33:14] Take him at his word.
[1:33:17] God is hidden simplicity.
[1:33:20] I just got a few things. We're closing.
[1:33:22] Sincerely pray.
[1:33:25] Be sincere when you pray.
[1:33:28] Be prepared for God to speak.
[1:33:32] Be reverent. Be humble. Come to church
[1:33:35] with an expectation.
[1:33:38] The Bible says, "For an entrance shall
[1:33:40] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[1:33:42] the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[1:33:44] Savior Jesus Christ." Fear not, little
[1:33:48] flock, for it is the Father's good
[1:33:51] pleasure to give you the kingdom.
[1:33:54] God has already given you has already
[1:33:56] given you the promise of his kingdom.
[1:34:00] Now, it's up to you to start growing in
[1:34:02] it.
[1:34:04] Just grow in it. Take the word, say,
[1:34:06] "I'm going to live it." Come next week
[1:34:08] with a testimony.
[1:34:10] I decided to start living for Jesus a
[1:34:13] little bit more this week. And I'll tell
[1:34:15] you that testimony in church is enough
[1:34:18] to help light the fire in the church
[1:34:23] because we need a living word. This
[1:34:25] means we a a living church. Paul stating
[1:34:29] living the life, encouraging one
[1:34:30] another, and edifying one another. Let's
[1:34:33] stand together, saints. God God bless
[1:34:35] you. Just walk in his kingdom on earth.
[1:34:42] Don't wait till you get there. Walk on
[1:34:43] walk in his kingdom here. Remember when
[1:34:46] Jesus was teaching his disciples to
[1:34:48] pray?
[1:34:51] He said, "Thy kingdom come.
[1:34:53] Thy will be done on earth as it is in
[1:34:57] heaven."
[1:34:58] So, you simply take the word that's
[1:35:00] ministered unto you and you start living
[1:35:03] it in your personal life. And it doesn't
[1:35:05] matter if your sisters and brothers
[1:35:06] aren't doing it.
[1:35:08] It doesn't matter if your husband and
[1:35:09] wife's not doing it. Doesn't matter if
[1:35:11] your best friends aren't doing it. You
[1:35:13] do it.
[1:35:15] You do it.
[1:35:16] You do his word on earth. That is his
[1:35:20] kingdom coming inside of you.
[1:35:24] Granted, let's bow our hearts in a word
[1:35:26] of prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, we
[1:35:29] come to you as a body. We want to be
[1:35:32] that body that
[1:35:35] edifies one another, that effectually
[1:35:39] works and gives to each member the
[1:35:44] things that have need of. And Lord, we
[1:35:47] want to be that church that's
[1:35:49] continuously growing in the love of God
[1:35:52] and and seeking all the measures that
[1:35:54] you have for us till we're whole, till
[1:35:56] we're completely in your image. And
[1:35:59] Father, I pray that you would bless and
[1:36:01] strengthen the church. May this um this
[1:36:05] word, Lord Jesus, that that you have
[1:36:09] given us in this hour become more
[1:36:12] precious to us
[1:36:14] that we could spend more time listening
[1:36:16] to the tapes and reading the message and
[1:36:19] and and reading this precious Bible and
[1:36:23] and seeking you in prayer and and coming
[1:36:26] to church uh as it were with a a level
[1:36:28] head, a sound mind, and and desiring
[1:36:32] preparing to have more of the kingdom
[1:36:35] ministered onto us. Bless us as a body,
[1:36:38] Lord. We want to be ready when it comes
[1:36:41] time for the rapture. We want to be
[1:36:43] there.
[1:36:44] Oh God, help us, Lord. Help us to shake
[1:36:48] off all unbelief, to shake off the
[1:36:50] things of the world, to shake off the
[1:36:52] things that are standing in the way.
[1:36:54] Lord, help us to be a help to one
[1:36:56] another. Oh, granite Jesus. We need you
[1:37:00] as a body, Lord. And we're crying out to
[1:37:03] you today. May your word just enter
[1:37:05] inside of us and make us all that you'd
[1:37:08] have us to be completely new creatures
[1:37:10] in you. Thank you for these things,
[1:37:12] Father. We love you. We give you the
[1:37:14] praise as we expect these things, Lord,
[1:37:16] in the days to come in Jesus Christ's
[1:37:18] name. Amen.
[1:37:20] Amen. Let's sing. When the battle's
[1:37:22] over, we shall wear a crown.
