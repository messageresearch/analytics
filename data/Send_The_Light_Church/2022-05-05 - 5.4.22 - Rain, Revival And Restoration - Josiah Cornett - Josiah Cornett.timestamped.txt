[3:41] well let me ask you this do you believe
[3:43] that you're right where god wants you to
[3:44] be tonight amen the bible says that
[3:46] wherever two or three are gathered he
[3:48] would be with us in
[3:50] our midst
[3:51] and it also says that do not forsake the
[3:54] assembling of yourself so much the more
[3:56] as the end approaches how he believes
[3:58] we're at the end unbelievers we're
[4:01] approaching it
[4:02] well i i want to be right where god

[4:05] amen and in fellowship with the saints i
[4:08] believe that's a good place for us to be
[4:09] tonight amen let's go ahead and go and
[4:12] pray to our lord dear lord jesus we just
[4:14] come before you father
[4:16] lord just so appreciative to be able to
[4:18] come in the congregation of the saints
[4:20] yet again it's your grace that we can
[4:22] fellowship together lord lord your mercy
[4:24] that you purge us of your sin lord that
[4:27] you spared us from judgment but your
[4:28] grace your divine favor that not only
[4:31] would you spare us from sin not only
[4:33] would you put us in fellowship with
[4:34] yourself but that you would put us in
[4:37] fellowship with such
[4:39] wonderful company a family of god
[4:42] lord maybe maybe some here tonight
[4:45] wouldn't know what family was like
[4:46] before they came to the family of god
[4:49] but lord you instruct us in right
[4:51] relationships and thank you so much that
[4:54] we could come here and relate one to
[4:56] another through your word lord and
[4:58] through your blood as we now turn
[5:01] ourselves to your word lord we desire to
[5:04] relate to your word father i pray that
[5:06] you'd open it up to each one lord and
[5:08] show us positionally
[5:10] where we are in these last days
[5:12] ran it dear lord jesus in jesus christ's
[5:15] name amen
[5:17] but i won't keep you standing saints
[5:19] we'll go straight to the word tonight
[5:21] i'm so glad to hear that your pastor's
[5:23] coming home we'll be turning over to
[5:25] joel chapter 2
[5:26] and also song of solomon chapter 2.
[5:30] but uh just so happy to hear that
[5:32] brother john's on his way home to you i
[5:34] know being without him for a while that
[5:36] can be a little bit of a a
[5:38] troubling time for sheep i i know i
[5:40] don't like being without my pastor for
[5:42] long back home i believe the prophet
[5:44] said that after a while you know the
[5:45] sheep they get a little bit they get a
[5:47] little bit nervous without the shepherd
[5:49] and i think that's just the case but i
[5:52] don't think there's any reason for us to
[5:54] be nervous one to another tonight we're
[5:56] all home folk here we know one another i
[5:58] see a couple
[5:59] a couple faces that maybe we don't know
[6:02] each other as well but we're all in the
[6:04] family of god so we're looking forward
[6:07] to our fellowship tonight
[6:09] joel chapter 2 verse 223
[6:14] the prophet joel here cries forth a
[6:16] familiar scripture he says be glad then
[6:18] ye children of zion and rejoice in the
[6:21] lord your god for he hath given you the
[6:24] former rain moderately and he will cause
[6:27] to come down for you the rain the former
[6:30] rain and the latter rain in the first
[6:32] month
[6:33] and the floor the floor shall be full of
[6:35] wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[6:37] wine and oil and i will restore to you
[6:40] that was the canker worm and the locusts
[6:42] hath eaten and the caterpillar and the
[6:44] palmer worm my great army which i sent
[6:47] among you
[6:48] in songs chapter 2
[6:51] just to return to our
[6:53] verses that we read on sunday together
[6:56] chapter 2 and verse 10.
[7:00] solomon and the bride
[7:03] exchanged the readings one to another
[7:05] and the bride says of her beloved
[7:07] he says who we know is the type of
[7:09] christ who says my beloved spake and
[7:11] said unto me rise up my love my fair one
[7:14] and come away for lo the winter is past
[7:18] and the rain is over and gone
[7:21] now what happens after the rain is over
[7:23] and gone says the flowers appear on the
[7:25] earth
[7:27] the time of the singing of birds has
[7:28] come and the voice the turtle is heard
[7:30] in early end the fig tree putteth forth
[7:32] her green figs and the vines with the
[7:34] tender grapes give a good smell arise my
[7:38] love my fair one come away
[7:40] may the lord add the blessings to his
[7:43] word as you're seated
[7:47] preaching sunday with you folks here and
[7:50] speaking of these tender grapes and how
[7:52] the bride and the bridegroom are looking
[7:54] forward to enjoy these tender grapes one
[7:56] with another and i i have to step back
[7:59] and and recognize that when we're
[8:01] preaching along these lines there may be
[8:03] some believers that might feel that
[8:05] they're not being partakers of these
[8:06] tender grapes
[8:08] and when we start to look at the word
[8:10] and realize that maybe we're coming up
[8:12] shorter there's still some more of the
[8:13] word that that we're that we're needing
[8:15] to inherit some more of the word that
[8:17] we're looking to possess we we start to
[8:20] think about
[8:21] these rewords like
[8:23] restoration and redemption and revival
[8:27] because we we realize that we want to
[8:29] come back to something something we're
[8:31] called to and that that
[8:34] prefix re means to be brought back to
[8:36] revive since simply means to revitalize
[8:39] to take someone that was once vital and
[8:41] simply make them vital again
[8:44] it doesn't mean that you were always
[8:46] dead and that god just comes along and
[8:48] picks you up it means that one time you
[8:50] were alive in christ but at some time
[8:53] you lost maybe the joy of the lord and
[8:56] it's time to revitalize yourself in
[8:58] christ
[8:59] redemption simply means to be brought
[9:01] back to god amen now many times we think
[9:04] of redemption as the first time we ever
[9:06] come to god but turns out that the bible
[9:09] says that by predestination god knew us
[9:11] already from the foundation of the world
[9:14] amen and so we know that redemption
[9:16] means to simply god brought
[9:19] bought us back by his blood to himself
[9:22] amen you were always his you were always
[9:24] in christ from the foundation in the
[9:27] world
[9:28] he knew you amen and by his
[9:30] foreknowledge he predestinated you the
[9:32] apostle paul says amen so my i i think
[9:36] we can just about get a revival tonight
[9:38] just thinking about god's words
[9:40] but so many times people when they begin
[9:42] to think about a revival they they start
[9:44] looking for something to come that's
[9:46] outside of themselves and they they want
[9:48] god to to have a special dense
[9:51] dispensation of grace perhaps some some
[9:53] kind of extra rain they're looking to
[9:56] fall have fallen down on them
[9:59] and so i wanted to come back and maybe
[10:01] look at this scripture tonight where the
[10:03] prophet joel is promising a rain he says
[10:06] there's going to be a former rain
[10:08] they say amora which that means a
[10:10] teaching rain and there's going to be a
[10:12] ladder rain which is the harvest rain
[10:15] and that's going to come forth at the
[10:16] same time he says amen
[10:19] and so i wanted to just maybe take a
[10:21] little bit of a teaching tonight and uh
[10:24] we'll see if it goes off into treachery
[10:26] a little bit and a little bit of
[10:27] preaching but we'll just see where the
[10:29] lord leads tonight but i wanted to come
[10:31] back and look at the words of our
[10:32] prophet to start with and how brother
[10:35] branham approached this scripture verse
[10:38] now before we start there i i want to
[10:41] say that
[10:43] that reign and the philistine in the in
[10:46] that area of israel there
[10:49] um
[10:50] that climate there that mora that
[10:52] teaching reign is considered the the at
[10:55] the end of october and the beginning of
[10:58] november it's considered the the period
[11:00] of winter
[11:01] the commentator says is from the end of
[11:03] october until the end of march and that
[11:06] rain does not entirely cease
[11:08] that early rain means the first autumnal
[11:11] showers which prepare the arid soil
[11:14] for seed
[11:16] so
[11:17] the early rain is the rain preparing for
[11:20] some kind of seed
[11:21] and the latter rain is later spring
[11:23] showers especially in march which bring
[11:26] forward the crop towards harvest
[11:29] and at that time the crop is then
[11:31] brought forward to harvest not in march
[11:34] when the rain is falling but later on in
[11:36] may is when the wheat harvest is brought
[11:38] forth so that's kind of the the uh the
[11:41] climate that we're talking about the the
[11:43] prophet joel is speaking from
[11:46] and brother branham says in the spoken
[11:47] word is the original seed he says
[11:49] someone asked me to repeat that hebrew
[11:51] word again in joel the second chapter
[11:54] and the word former in is the hebrew
[11:57] word for mora which means teaching
[12:00] in other words it'll be a teaching rain
[12:02] and then also a harvest rain and he says
[12:05] now we've had the teaching rain and
[12:07] we're ready now for the harvest rain is
[12:10] in 1962.
[12:12] now we've had the teaching rain
[12:14] and you know the first drain is when you
[12:16] plant the seed that starts your crop of
[12:17] growing and then just before it matures
[12:20] there comes another crop and that's what
[12:22] they call the harvest rain the spring
[12:24] rains about june it makes your crop and
[12:26] the rain we find out was the spirit so
[12:29] we have this early type that the rain in
[12:32] the bible is a type of the spirit
[12:35] so now in the same sermon
[12:37] brother branham asks the congregation
[12:39] why then has the revival fires let up
[12:43] he says you don't hear very much of
[12:45] billy graham like the great evangelist
[12:46] oral roberts not burning forth a country
[12:49] like he used to and my meanings is not
[12:52] even heard of
[12:53] there's just three and he says what's
[12:55] the matter
[12:56] and isn't that what we ask ourselves
[12:58] even in our own lives is what's the
[13:00] matter
[13:02] now billy graham the world was burning
[13:04] up here long ago with billy graham
[13:06] very sheldon hear of it now billy
[13:08] graham's now gone on in our age
[13:10] so what's the matter
[13:12] who's next what's next for the bride
[13:15] what's next for god's people
[13:17] that's
[13:18] what human naturally looks for
[13:21] he says oral roberts just burning up the
[13:24] earth but dying down now tommy osborne
[13:27] all them good godly men but what's
[13:29] happened and believing that god called
[13:31] me for ministry he says what's happened
[13:34] to mine
[13:36] and you say well brother branham yours
[13:38] is the deadest of them all
[13:40] he says that's that's true
[13:42] that is right 1962.
[13:44] he says that
[13:46] brother brown are you saying that you're
[13:48] telling here's here that you actually
[13:49] believe the word and everything then
[13:51] what's happened to you then what's taken
[13:54] place
[13:55] that's what we want to know
[13:57] now put her down in your mind and i'll
[14:00] pull down the umbrella and shake off the
[14:01] rain and open up your heart here just a
[14:03] minute
[14:04] that's what we want to do tonight is
[14:05] let's open up a heart here just a moment
[14:08] because i think even today we have the
[14:09] same question is what's the matter the
[14:12] coming of the lord is supposed to be
[14:14] upon us what's the matter is my life
[14:16] lining up when i look at all the
[14:18] churches around me are they lining up
[14:20] what's going to take place to get us
[14:21] ready for the coming of the lord
[14:23] what's the matter
[14:26] he says remember the bible said in
[14:27] genesis first chapter that every seed
[14:30] comes after its kind
[14:32] and it will have to bring forth after
[14:34] its kind
[14:35] so i believe that it's near the harvest
[14:37] time
[14:38] and the seeds are being planted now
[14:42] he says oh i wish you could just see
[14:44] what passed before me then
[14:46] oh something is happening i can see it
[14:49] passing before me it's done caught the
[14:51] spirit it's no longer just brother
[14:53] braham speaking as a man but god is
[14:56] coming down on this sermon and
[14:57] quickening it
[14:59] he says amen oh now i know this is the
[15:02] truth it's thus saith the lord
[15:05] by vision see move can't hardly look
[15:07] down here every time i look see
[15:09] it's just and something's happening you
[15:11] see so now we can have we can have
[15:13] certainty that god's inspiring this
[15:16] he says i believe it's near the harvest
[15:18] time the seeds have been planted the
[15:21] denominational siege of the churches
[15:23] such as the evangelicals like the
[15:25] baptist the presbyterian the lutheran
[15:28] and the pentecostal seeds has been
[15:30] panted where into the pentecostal
[15:33] organization
[15:35] by great men like oral roberts and tommy
[15:37] hicks and osborne great men of god and i
[15:40] believe that the word of god has been
[15:42] planted unadulterated away from all
[15:45] those organization
[15:47] now the seed must be planted and then it
[15:50] must have water in order to grow
[15:53] see why did we have it in that planting
[15:55] time it's the former rain he says the
[15:58] teaching rain has went forth
[16:01] and he says now what's the matter now
[16:03] now she is waiting for the latter rain
[16:06] you throw forth all your seeds in that
[16:09] teaching reign
[16:10] but now you have to wait for the
[16:11] laddering to come and quicken it
[16:14] he says that's when she produces her
[16:16] fruits
[16:17] then the kind of seed that you plant in
[16:19] your field will be the kind of crop
[16:22] you'll reap
[16:23] if the denominations want more members
[16:26] that's what they're going to get the
[16:28] pentecostals want more pentecostals the
[16:30] baptists want more baptist
[16:32] well they're going to get that but the
[16:34] word is going to produce
[16:36] sons and daughters of god
[16:39] what's a son and a daughter of god it's
[16:41] that person who has been made a partaker
[16:44] of the divine nature filled with god's
[16:46] holy spirit and identified with the word
[16:49] of god
[16:50] not a creed not a dogma
[16:53] not something that he rece recitates
[16:55] because that's what his his his church
[16:57] says but something that he himself has
[16:59] come into alignment with the word he's
[17:02] recognized it in the word by his own
[17:04] self and something has quickened him not
[17:07] because a man william branham said it
[17:09] not because a man josiah cornett or john
[17:12] martin said it not because as mammy or
[17:15] as pappy said it but because there's
[17:17] something there's a seed on the inside a
[17:19] sieging of god a predestinated seed a
[17:23] very part of god that god made in his
[17:25] own image
[17:27] the same seed that was in adam that god
[17:30] made man in his own image and that seed
[17:33] of god recognizes something in the word
[17:36] and it lines itself up and identifies it
[17:39] and says that's the truth
[17:41] he says he might he might be looking at
[17:43] acts 2 38 for the first time and going
[17:45] back and forth to matthew where it says
[17:48] teach all teach all men to be baptized
[17:50] the name of the father and of the name
[17:52] of the son and the name of the holy
[17:53] ghost and he hears the teaching from the
[17:55] prophet sure but
[17:57] the prophet says well look at acts 2 38
[18:00] jesus christ is the name of the father
[18:02] the name of the son the name of the holy
[18:04] ghost now it's not just because of
[18:06] prophets teaching it the prophet is just
[18:09] the bible says that the word of the lord
[18:11] comes to the prophet
[18:13] but it's not the prophet that quickens
[18:15] sons and daughters of god it's the word
[18:17] of the lord coming through that vessel
[18:20] god using that vessel behold i'll send
[18:23] elijah my prophet before the great and
[18:25] coming day of the lord to what turn not
[18:28] it's not all about a prophet
[18:30] there's something in that scripture that
[18:32] i identify with
[18:34] my name's in malachi 4 5 and 6. it's not
[18:38] about elijah the prophet it's about
[18:40] those sons and those daughters
[18:43] that have their hearts turned back to
[18:45] the pentecostal fathers
[18:48] and i can say now i recognize what the
[18:51] word is for my life now i recognize i
[18:54] have to be baptized in the name of jesus
[18:56] christ so that i can receive my promises
[18:58] amen
[18:59] the promise
[19:01] of the holy ghost amen
[19:04] so brother brahm says in 1962 they're
[19:06] waiting for that seed to come forth and
[19:08] the kind of see or that rain to come
[19:10] forth and whatever the seed was that's
[19:12] what they're going to get
[19:14] now be careful here because when we when
[19:17] we throw down our seeds a lot of times
[19:20] what we throw down is based upon what we
[19:22] want to see come forth
[19:25] brother branham often taught us to to
[19:27] expect things from god
[19:29] but the fact of the matter is that
[19:31] oftentimes we get what we expect isn't
[19:33] it
[19:34] and it's not just with the word of god
[19:36] but there's a principle here that our
[19:39] expectations
[19:41] yield forth fruit
[19:43] whether that fruit is under godliness
[19:45] or that fruit's off the word
[19:48] if i expect that i'm going to have a bad
[19:50] day even though god intended for me to
[19:52] have a bad day a good day
[19:54] i'm probably going to still have a bad
[19:56] day because that's what i was expecting
[20:00] and brother branham talks about this he
[20:02] says
[20:03] the very next day after the spoken word
[20:05] is the original seed he says they've
[20:07] been talking so much now about a latter
[20:09] rain
[20:10] now remember he just said that we're
[20:13] waiting for that latter rain but now he
[20:15] says they're talking about it and not
[20:17] discarding you ladder rain brethren but
[20:19] that's not latter rain
[20:21] what were they doing they were
[20:23] manufacturing some expectation
[20:25] he says if the latter rain would have
[20:27] been there the power of god would have
[20:28] struck that thing and she would have
[20:30] swept the world the latter rain is
[20:33] fixing to come but what's the matter the
[20:35] church is manufacturing herself
[20:37] something
[20:38] just like eve tried to do
[20:41] and isn't that just about human nature
[20:44] when we start asking ourselves questions
[20:46] like what's the matter
[20:48] well especially the men in the room we
[20:50] want to fix it right away
[20:52] that's that's that's what happens with
[20:53] my wife i ask her what's the matter and
[20:55] i'm i'm asking it because i want to fix
[20:57] the problem
[20:59] and god don't need us to fix his
[21:01] problems matter of fact god don't have
[21:03] any problems but he needs us to catch
[21:06] the movement of the spirit the bible
[21:09] says that sons and daughters of god are
[21:12] led by the spirit of god
[21:15] he wants us to act like his sons and
[21:17] daughters
[21:19] but the church he says is manufacturing
[21:21] herself something
[21:23] she just like eve tried to do she tried
[21:25] to have more light to manufacture
[21:26] something and we've done and gone done
[21:28] the same thing trying to make something
[21:31] in ourselves
[21:32] see keep your hand off of it let god do
[21:35] it take his word and believe it hold
[21:38] that in your heart and the when the rain
[21:40] begins to fall it will take hold and the
[21:43] word will manifest its own self
[21:47] amen
[21:49] you kind of start to see what people's
[21:52] expectations are based on some of the
[21:53] questions that they they ask brother
[21:55] branham and questions the answer is you
[21:57] can pick it up there where someone says
[21:59] with a bride before jesus comes we'll
[22:02] see have all power of the holy ghost
[22:04] perform miracles and raise the dead and
[22:06] so on as in the latter rain
[22:08] or is this the latter rain for the 144
[22:11] thousand jews will all ministers have
[22:13] this or are we just waiting for the
[22:15] coming
[22:17] isn't isn't that that just shows what
[22:20] people are looking for doesn't it will
[22:22] the
[22:23] will will the bride have all power of
[22:25] the holy ghost
[22:26] to perform miracles raise the dead
[22:30] is this the latter rain
[22:32] well now wait a second if i go back to
[22:35] mark
[22:38] it said that we already had that power
[22:41] that they will they will raise lay hands
[22:44] on the sick the sick will recover they
[22:46] will cast out demons they will bring the
[22:49] dead back to life again and it didn't
[22:51] say anything about weight for the latter
[22:53] rain it said this is the mark of
[22:56] sons and daughters of god those who
[22:58] believe in me
[22:59] will manifest this amen
[23:03] now you may not manifest all those
[23:05] things all the time but those things
[23:07] will be resident within the body of
[23:09] christ
[23:11] so
[23:12] look at how brother branham answers this
[23:15] and it's so good because
[23:18] he doesn't come out and answer it
[23:19] directly because he doesn't i believe
[23:22] it's he addresses more
[23:25] the expectation behind the question
[23:27] because he doesn't ever say well yes
[23:29] they will or will yes they will not that
[23:31] goes without saying but he says
[23:34] the question is can you nurse
[23:38] seems like his answer doesn't have
[23:39] anything to do with a question
[23:41] but he says the real question here is
[23:43] can you nurse
[23:45] so this person's got some kind of
[23:47] expectation probably somebody's saying i
[23:49] need something to happen here and
[23:51] brother brahm says the question is can
[23:53] you nurse
[23:54] it says that same question came to the
[23:55] pentecostals and they couldn't do it
[23:58] they grabbed a breast from the old
[24:00] denomination they came out of but then
[24:02] the real seed to come
[24:04] comes in nurses from that breast
[24:07] see that was the last sign that abraham
[24:09] had before the promised son that they'd
[24:11] waited all these years
[24:13] god was standing in the form of a man
[24:16] and could discern the thoughts that was
[24:17] in sarah's heart it goes back to
[24:20] what happened just before
[24:22] abraham inherited his promise of a son
[24:24] says the last sign that they had
[24:27] was here
[24:28] god came and discerned the thoughts that
[24:30] was in sarah's heart remember when she
[24:33] laughed up her sleeve behind the tent
[24:35] when god said that abraham would have a
[24:37] son and he'd visit him not many days
[24:40] hence
[24:41] and that was the last time i had and
[24:42] then the promise came
[24:44] and after that she chained back to young
[24:46] woman young man isaac was brought forth
[24:48] on the scene the promised son
[24:50] he says now i believe you're seeing the
[24:52] last thing that'll happen to the church
[24:54] before the rapture
[24:56] i believe it the rain is
[24:58] over this is 1964 1962 he said that
[25:02] we're waiting for that rain
[25:04] just two years later he says the rain is
[25:06] over
[25:09] that's what's promised the church right
[25:11] there
[25:13] you notice the other day when we started
[25:15] the trumpets the holy spirit said that
[25:16] don't belong here see we're just now to
[25:19] wait on the coming of the lord
[25:21] just wait
[25:22] keep your lamps trimmed all filled with
[25:24] a spirit pray up every hour not every
[25:27] day just keep ready be sweet and
[25:31] watching
[25:32] the question is what happened
[25:34] 1962 to 1964 what happened he said the
[25:37] rain was there we're waiting for it now
[25:38] he says the rain's over and watch what
[25:40] your expectation is just nurse from god
[25:44] brother graham gives some insight into
[25:46] it earlier in that year of 1964
[25:49] recognizing your day and its message
[25:51] though how important it is to recognize
[25:52] our day
[25:54] everywhere now he says there's no
[25:56] revival everybody is complaining
[25:58] ministers outstanding papers that comes
[26:00] here to the church a very fine paper and
[26:02] i know the editor and i know the people
[26:04] and they're very fine brother sister
[26:06] moore of the herald is coming one of the
[26:07] finest papers in the field and it's all
[26:09] about fast pray sound of the trumpet
[26:11] fast pray something's about to happen
[26:13] let's make something break forth we're
[26:15] going to have a great breaking day
[26:17] there's going to be something happen all
[26:18] of you pray pray pray we're not too late
[26:20] yet
[26:21] you see that
[26:24] that pressure
[26:25] that anxiety that stress in trying to
[26:28] inject human emotion and human effort
[26:32] into the whole situation
[26:35] how con how in contrast that is
[26:39] to el shaddai the great breasted god who
[26:42] says come and nurse from me
[26:44] fast pray fast pray we're not too late
[26:47] yet
[26:48] something's about to break forth can you
[26:50] nurse from me he says why do they do
[26:53] that
[26:53] they want a great awakening oh watch
[26:57] what you're wanting
[26:59] they're crying believing there will be
[27:01] an awakening and they're good people
[27:04] what have they done
[27:06] they have not recognized
[27:08] the awakening of the bride
[27:12] 1962 to 1964 something happened and
[27:15] these folks didn't recognize it
[27:17] see by being a christian they feel the
[27:19] pull of the hour but they haven't
[27:21] recognized what's been done past tense
[27:26] and that's what's making them feel that
[27:27] way they know that something is supposed
[27:30] to happen
[27:31] but they're looking for it way off in
[27:33] the future to come when it's already
[27:35] happened right
[27:37] by you
[27:39] see friends we're in the time
[27:42] of the coming of the lord
[27:45] now
[27:45] according to just nature believing that
[27:47] god works according to nature and
[27:49] knowing that our type is the type of a
[27:51] wheat
[27:52] we have to realize that
[27:55] the rain isn't what's going to get us
[27:57] there
[27:58] matter of fact the bible even says this
[28:00] it says that as snow and summer and
[28:02] there's rain and harvest so honor is not
[28:05] seemly for a fool
[28:08] it would be just as is as
[28:11] seemly for a fool to have honor as it
[28:14] would be for god to use some special
[28:17] dispensation of grace
[28:19] and pouring forth his spirit
[28:21] to bring us to a final harvest
[28:24] it's the rain that brings them to
[28:26] maturity
[28:27] but in that final harvest we're going to
[28:30] find out what it is that god uses to
[28:33] bring his crops in
[28:36] brother branham says this in modern
[28:38] events made clear by prophecy
[28:40] he says about the wheat he says the
[28:43] shuck held it but now the shuck pulls
[28:45] away and remember 20 years has passed
[28:47] and no more denominations have come of
[28:49] it
[28:50] it won't we're at the end of
[28:51] denominations the wheat has taken shape
[28:54] is 1965.
[28:56] december thereof but what's the matter
[28:59] with the wheat now
[29:01] how he believes your wheat
[29:03] he says what's the matter with you
[29:05] what's the matter with a wheat now is
[29:07] that is that your question some days you
[29:09] get up all the morning and says well if
[29:11] i'm supposed to get in the harvest i
[29:12] feel like what's the matter with me
[29:15] he says
[29:16] it must lay in the presence of the sun
[29:21] to ripen before the combine comes along
[29:24] and picks it up
[29:27] we're not looking for some ladder rain
[29:29] to fall
[29:30] that's already fallen
[29:32] but now we're looking for that combine
[29:35] to pick it up
[29:38] and all we have to do is lay in the
[29:40] presence of jesus christ
[29:44] now we're going to get to what that
[29:45] latter reign was i don't want you to
[29:46] think i'm just going to pass over that
[29:48] but let me take my time and getting
[29:50] there today
[29:52] he says now the events that we're seeing
[29:54] place it's all absolutely shown in the
[29:56] bible of every age
[29:57] we think we're out of cater but we're
[30:00] not
[30:01] everything is just exactly
[30:04] with god's word
[30:06] amen i love it when where he says in the
[30:09] shalom message i've got it here because
[30:10] i found it so encouraging he says now
[30:13] and sometimes we get so discouraged and
[30:16] confused but he says if you can't look
[30:17] up
[30:18] or if you can't look ahead just look up
[30:21] don't even try to look ahead see when we
[30:23] start trying to look ahead that's where
[30:25] we get all these offshoots trying to
[30:27] inject ourselves and make something
[30:29] happen he says don't even try to look up
[30:32] look ahead just look up what is the
[30:33] apostle paul said looking unto jesus
[30:37] not the next day not the next event not
[30:39] the next outpouring not the next next
[30:41] next not what what do i need to do next
[30:44] it's just where is god's hand in my life
[30:47] let me take a hold of that hand let it
[30:50] lead me into the promised land let me be
[30:52] lockstep with god's spirit not trying to
[30:55] figure out where god's going to step
[30:56] next but let me just know where my lord
[30:59] is today and step right behind him and
[31:02] let me be faithful to that relationship
[31:05] that i'm called to if he's calling me to
[31:08] holiness today let me shuck off
[31:10] everything of the world if he's calling
[31:12] me to be a greater witness today let me
[31:14] shuck off my complexes and talk the
[31:17] person down at the gas station let me
[31:19] just be led of god and not worry about
[31:22] where god's going he said that he would
[31:24] lead me he would guide me he would send
[31:27] me into all truth he said he wouldn't
[31:29] point the way oh hallelujah god don't
[31:32] point the way friends god said that he
[31:35] would lead you
[31:37] and guide you as a shepherd does a sheep
[31:40] amen amen praise the lord i'm glad that
[31:42] he don't make me some some kind of bull
[31:45] or some kind of horse and send me off on
[31:47] my way he calls me his sheep his little
[31:50] lamb he takes me by his tender staff and
[31:53] leads me all the way to promised land
[31:56] amen don't look ahead just look up
[32:00] put your hand in hands he says let him
[32:02] lead you look up done ahead amen
[32:06] but then
[32:08] we come back to
[32:09] asking ourselves well what happened in
[32:12] between 1962 and 1965 there was some
[32:16] kind of there was some kind of rain that
[32:18] came forth there was some kind of a
[32:20] revival brother branham said that we
[32:22] were looking for it
[32:23] 1965 the invisible union of the bride of
[32:27] christ
[32:29] he says watch then the spiritual bride
[32:32] when she begins to have a revival
[32:38] watch the fruits of it it's not empty
[32:40] out all the hospitals it's not some
[32:42] public display of the people
[32:45] it's not all these outward
[32:46] manifestations
[32:48] when she begins to come back
[32:51] and line herself up
[32:53] with the word of god
[32:56] whoa hallelujah
[32:58] so that's where the bride's revival is
[33:00] the invisible union of the bride and the
[33:04] bridegroom
[33:06] lining herself up with what christ the
[33:08] word
[33:10] that's what we're being called to
[33:12] if you want to know what do i need to do
[33:14] to get ready for a rapture just ask
[33:17] yourself what is the rapture
[33:19] why it's just the call to the marriage
[33:22] supper that's all it's just a call to
[33:25] the wedding feast
[33:27] so my question to tonight is are you
[33:29] married
[33:31] are you ready for the wedding feast
[33:34] don't try to make yourself well i
[33:37] haven't i haven't raised the dead yet or
[33:39] i haven't checked off this spiritual
[33:41] accomplishment i haven't spoken in
[33:43] tongues yet i haven't done this i i
[33:45] haven't i haven't i haven't ask yourself
[33:47] what has he done in my life
[33:50] how much have i allowed him to do in my
[33:52] life
[33:53] am i allowing him to bring me into one
[33:55] minute with him
[33:57] one man isn't just
[33:59] doing the works of christ
[34:01] one man is
[34:02] knowing christ
[34:04] and having his character having his
[34:06] spirit amen
[34:08] you know he said that there would be
[34:09] many that would come to me in that day
[34:11] and he would say lord lord
[34:14] many works have we done in your name
[34:17] and yet he would say depart from me for
[34:20] i never even knew you
[34:22] i would rather be the person that never
[34:24] did any works but knew him
[34:26] and still believed in his works in my
[34:28] life
[34:29] and told others of the same than to be
[34:32] the one that was so hypocritical is to
[34:34] tell everyone about jesus christ but
[34:36] never come into real fellowship with him
[34:40] tell my children about christ tell the
[34:42] people at work about christ but really i
[34:45] never came to know him
[34:46] let me not be that
[34:48] that is what we're striving for
[34:51] that's where the bride's revival is when
[34:53] she begins to come back
[34:54] and line herself up with the word of god
[34:57] he says watch then again you'll see how
[34:59] the scriptures at that time there will
[35:02] be a message to come out and sweep and
[35:03] catch that bride
[35:05] catch that woman elect oh i believe
[35:08] that's the message that we're hearing
[35:09] today a message that's prophesying again
[35:12] to god's bride though the though the
[35:13] prophet has gone off the scene yet
[35:15] there's a five-fold message
[35:18] five-fold ministry that's repeating that
[35:20] message and that's what's catching the
[35:22] bride in this last hour
[35:24] so where is the bride's revival the
[35:27] bride's revival is in the word brother
[35:30] branham in restoration the bride tree he
[35:32] teaches us that those four
[35:35] critters that came there and ate away at
[35:37] the bride tree the palmer worm and the
[35:40] locust and the cankerworm the
[35:42] caterpillar he said that that's a type
[35:45] of the four restorations that had to
[35:47] come
[35:48] so the first restoration was
[35:50] justification
[35:51] under underneath luther he says the just
[35:53] shall live by faith
[35:55] and wesley comes along and brings a
[35:57] message to shape up the church and get
[35:59] her to you know take off the worldliness
[36:01] a message of sanctification
[36:04] then you see the azusa street revival
[36:07] and and the gifts and pentecost got hung
[36:09] up on all the gifts and she did exactly
[36:12] the opposite of what the apostle paul
[36:14] told her to do
[36:15] the apostle paul speaking to the early
[36:17] church he said follow after church
[36:20] charity and desire spiritual gifts
[36:23] notice he didn't say it the other way
[36:24] around he didn't say follow after
[36:27] spiritual gifts and desire charity
[36:29] secondarily
[36:30] he said follow after charity which is
[36:33] love which is god
[36:35] follow after him follow after that
[36:38] relationship with christ
[36:40] but now that doesn't mean that we shuck
[36:43] off
[36:44] all the gifts that god restored to us
[36:46] so i think it'd be a pretty poor bride
[36:48] indeed that didn't appreciate a few
[36:50] roses from her husband every once in a
[36:52] while
[36:53] didn't appreciate some gifts on mother's
[36:54] day didn't appreciate some some kind of
[36:57] gift giving
[36:59] but that's not what we're in it for is
[37:00] it
[37:01] i
[37:02] i know my wife didn't marry me because i
[37:05] gave her a pretty looking ring on her
[37:07] finger
[37:09] she appreciated it she desired it i'll
[37:12] even say she desired it she desired a
[37:14] pretty looking ring
[37:16] but
[37:16] what was it there was
[37:19] something behind that that token
[37:21] symbolized
[37:23] the gift is just a symbol of god's love
[37:26] and there's where we want to follow
[37:28] after so what's the fourth thing that
[37:30] could be restored it was the word itself
[37:34] underneath the malachi 4 5 ministry
[37:38] notice i didn't say the holy ghost was
[37:39] restored
[37:41] because the holy ghost was there all
[37:43] along
[37:44] we didn't just start receiving the holy
[37:45] ghost at the end of this age the baptism
[37:48] of the holy ghost was to all believers
[37:50] acts 2 38 that this promise is unto you
[37:53] and unto your children and as many as we
[37:55] believe even as those that are far off
[38:00] so all through the ages we have the holy
[38:01] ghost but what was the difference now
[38:04] brother branham said the difference now
[38:06] was that that church had been bound
[38:08] had bound the holy ghost for nearly 2
[38:10] 000 years underneath martyrdom back
[38:13] there under the church ages and they
[38:15] bound the holy ghost at the door of
[38:17] creeds and dogmas
[38:19] so that the holy ghost could not work
[38:22] but she that church is going to be
[38:24] liberated she is coming back and that's
[38:27] what the bible said
[38:29] the holy spirit has been bound in these
[38:31] denominational rivers for almost 2 000
[38:33] years
[38:34] but is to be loosed again in the evening
[38:37] time
[38:38] by the evening time message
[38:40] he didn't say it but i'll say by the
[38:42] evening time messenger
[38:43] because it's the word that comes to
[38:45] prophets and the holy spirit back in the
[38:48] church again christ
[38:50] himself
[38:51] revealed in human flesh in the eating
[38:53] time
[38:55] bound by what bound by creation dogmas
[38:58] like
[38:59] the days of miracles are passed
[39:02] that took away people's faith in god's
[39:05] word
[39:06] well
[39:07] he was he received stripes for your
[39:09] healing but i don't know how i don't
[39:12] know how they preach it but
[39:14] the days of miracles are passed so that
[39:16] god only does your healing
[39:18] in smaller ways he doesn't do miraculous
[39:20] healings
[39:22] so we're gonna we're gonna start
[39:23] compartmentalizing god's power and the
[39:25] way that god's going to manifest himself
[39:27] to you
[39:30] and so they'll teach that
[39:32] the
[39:33] book of acts was just a template to show
[39:35] god's power but and to to get the
[39:37] message to spread through the world but
[39:39] then he kind of dialed it back a little
[39:41] bit
[39:42] but what does that do to people's faith
[39:45] faith in a god that
[39:47] not that they walk away and don't
[39:49] believe god anymore but they don't
[39:50] believe that god can affect them in the
[39:52] way that god wants to be able to
[39:53] manifest himself to them what about
[39:58] what about the
[39:59] the doctrine of serpency
[40:04] why does that matter how does that how
[40:06] does that
[40:08] bind the holy ghost by man's creeds and
[40:10] dogmas
[40:12] can we just be real here
[40:14] i i
[40:15] why does it matter
[40:16] why does it matter
[40:18] what what impact does it have to you
[40:22] that you've been taught the doctrine of
[40:24] the serpent seed and what really
[40:25] happened in the garden
[40:30] well for one thing
[40:32] i don't believe in a fairy tale
[40:35] when i go back in the bible and i start
[40:38] reading about her
[40:39] grabbing a apple or a pear or something
[40:42] off the tree
[40:43] and
[40:45] all of a suddenly she recognizes that
[40:47] she's naked
[40:49] and she
[40:50] grabs a hold of that apple and gives it
[40:52] to her husband
[40:53] and he recognizes that he's naked
[40:56] it doesn't make any sense to me
[40:58] matter of fact the only reason why it
[41:00] makes sense to people i think is because
[41:01] they've been raised up in it since they
[41:02] were children when fairy tales made
[41:04] sense
[41:07] but when you start realizing that it was
[41:08] a sex act in the garden
[41:10] that is the the the the same thing that
[41:13] made you and i realized that we were
[41:14] naked is the same thing that made adam
[41:17] and eve realize that they were naked
[41:19] that they that they lost their innocence
[41:21] at that time
[41:23] then the bible makes sense now it's no
[41:24] longer a story
[41:27] and now the continuity of scripture can
[41:29] be kept and now it's something that i
[41:30] can have faith in and i can see that
[41:32] that
[41:34] the scripture is solid from genesis to
[41:36] revelations and
[41:37] that it makes sense to me
[41:39] and then if that makes sense to me then
[41:42] everything has to make sense to me and i
[41:44] can start knocking on i can start
[41:46] knocking on the scripture and it's like
[41:49] it's like when you're knocking on a wall
[41:51] you look for the hollow spots
[41:53] and when you when you come across
[41:54] something solid you know that's
[41:56] something you can you can drive
[41:58] a hammer and a nail into
[42:02] and before maybe you you came across the
[42:04] scripture and said well i don't i don't
[42:05] really understand that but that's what
[42:07] everybody teaches so we'll just kind of
[42:08] go with it that it was an apple
[42:10] or maybe this denomination says it's a
[42:12] pear
[42:13] it feels kind of hollow i i'll just move
[42:15] on to the stuff that i really know about
[42:16] like
[42:17] calvary and
[42:20] these fundamentals
[42:22] but it's all christ
[42:25] it's all the word of god
[42:27] so there's something in this word that
[42:29] doesn't make sense to you now you can
[42:30] keep on knocking on it until you find a
[42:32] hollow place
[42:34] and say god
[42:36] and there are still many scriptures for
[42:37] me that i come across and say god i
[42:39] don't understand this
[42:41] but i'm not going to set it aside
[42:43] i might set up a set up on a shelf for a
[42:45] while but i want you to bring together
[42:47] the continuity of scripture
[42:49] and if i if it's not
[42:52] continuous for me then i know i'm not
[42:54] looking at it right and bring it and
[42:57] bring genesis into line with revelation
[42:59] until every book in the bible lines up
[43:01] for me
[43:03] and now we can have faith in it
[43:05] what about baptism in the name of jesus
[43:08] christ
[43:09] there's another thing that was bound by
[43:11] man's creeds and dogmas
[43:13] baptism in the name of the father in the
[43:15] name of the son the holy ghost but what
[43:17] was it it was a baptism without a
[43:19] promise
[43:20] because we weren't baptized according to
[43:22] acts 2 38 that says repent and be
[43:24] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[43:27] then you shall receive the gift of the
[43:29] holy ghost
[43:32] but now i can have faith and say now
[43:34] that i understand what i'm doing and i
[43:36] understand that jesus christ is
[43:39] how god revealed himself to this world
[43:41] that he is the father and the son and
[43:43] the holy ghost that it's one god
[43:46] just changing his mask as it were
[43:49] and i know who i serve and i'm not a
[43:51] polytheist i believe in one god and not
[43:53] in three separate persons but in
[43:55] different manifestations to man
[43:58] that jesus that jesus christ is jehovah
[44:00] of the old testament and jehovah of the
[44:02] old testament is jesus of the new
[44:05] and when i'm looking at the old
[44:06] testament i'm looking at the jesus in
[44:08] the new testament i'm looking at the
[44:10] same person
[44:11] i'm looking at the same god the same
[44:14] characteristics this is just a slightly
[44:16] different manifestation
[44:18] and now i can get down in those waters
[44:20] and say i'm going to be baptized the
[44:22] name of jesus christ today and when i
[44:24] raise up from these waters i'm
[44:26] identifying myself with jesus christ i
[44:30] know who i'm identifying myself with i'm
[44:32] not questioning whether i'm identifying
[44:35] part of myself with the holy ghost and
[44:37] part of myself with god the father and
[44:39] part of myself with the son like
[44:40] somebody said i didn't as a trinitarian
[44:43] said i didn't know who i was praying to
[44:44] so i split my prayers up between the
[44:46] three of them so they wouldn't get
[44:47] jealous of one another
[44:48] what kind of confusion is that
[44:52] that's what satan wants to do is because
[44:54] when we start having confusion enter in
[44:57] it breaks down faith
[44:58] introduces doubt and now you can't stand
[45:01] solid as a christian but the christian
[45:03] that has a revelation of the name of
[45:05] jesus christ can get down the waters and
[45:07] say when i get up from these waters
[45:09] today i will hold within my hand the
[45:12] token of god's promise for the holy
[45:14] ghost and if god don't give me the
[45:16] problem the promise of the holy ghost
[45:18] and manifest it to me as soon as i break
[45:20] forth from those waters i'm gonna hold
[45:22] acts 2 38 in my hand until he blesses me
[45:26] with an outpouring and a sealing of the
[45:28] holy ghost the earnest of my inheritance
[45:32] until the day of my redemption
[45:34] and i can walk solemn that and i can say
[45:37] i didn't get it yesterday but i'm
[45:39] holding on to the promise just like
[45:41] abraham i didn't get my son yesterday
[45:43] but i'm holding on to the promise just
[45:46] like noah i didn't get a flood yesterday
[45:48] but i'm holding on to the promise i'm
[45:50] building this ark and one a day after i
[45:53] one day i'm going to be sealed with pits
[45:55] from within and i without and when the
[45:57] judgment falls and the rains come that
[46:00] holy ghost will hold me
[46:02] oh hallelujah i tell you what as a
[46:04] christian if i got baptized in in the
[46:07] name of jesus christ i broke forth from
[46:09] those waters i wouldn't fear one bit if
[46:11] a car came and hit me afterwards because
[46:13] i'm still holding on to the promise of
[46:16] god in his scripture
[46:18] maybe i didn't feel the holy ghost maybe
[46:19] i didn't interpret it correctly that i
[46:21] had gotten it or not but i'm still i
[46:23] would still walk up to those pearly
[46:25] grates and say lord i maybe i just
[46:27] didn't know what i was talking about
[46:29] didn't know what i was feeling i don't
[46:31] know if i'm holding the holy ghost right
[46:32] now but i know one thing i'm holding i'm
[46:35] still holding on to your promise i did
[46:37] everything i knew how to do i was true
[46:39] to the revelation you gave me and i'm
[46:42] holding on to acts 2 38 oh i believe
[46:44] those pearly greats would swing open for
[46:47] me
[46:48] that's the difference now
[46:50] that now that holy ghost was resident
[46:52] within the
[46:54] the body of christ all those years
[46:56] but bound by creeds and dogmas
[46:58] now we can take a hold of it
[47:00] and have faith and confidence towards it
[47:03] amen
[47:04] oh hallelujah
[47:06] so where are we at now then
[47:09] i don't believe we're fullest virgin
[47:10] here tonight
[47:12] remember the foolish virgin when they
[47:13] recognized that it was the hour to have
[47:15] oil in their lamps
[47:17] they went out and they went with those
[47:20] who sold the oil in the markets
[47:23] but there was a group that already had
[47:25] the oil and i believe
[47:27] there's a group sitting here tonight
[47:29] that already had the oil
[47:32] and you didn't buy it with your money
[47:34] you didn't buy it with your efforts
[47:36] but you bought it by simply nursing from
[47:39] el shaddai believing on his promises
[47:42] and it was given to you
[47:45] so what do we do in this hour then
[47:47] i believe we do according to isaiah 60
[47:49] verse 1 where the prophet tells us arise
[47:52] and shine
[47:53] for thy light has come
[47:55] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[47:57] thee for behold the darkness shall cover
[48:00] the earth and gross darkness the people
[48:03] but the lord shall arise and shine upon
[48:05] thee
[48:07] rise up and do what
[48:09] trim our lamps
[48:12] if your lamp has started to smoke over
[48:14] don't think that it's that you need some
[48:16] new revival
[48:17] some
[48:18] new denomination
[48:20] some new movement within the message
[48:22] some new camp meeting
[48:26] i believe that you can get everything
[48:27] that god has for you right here in this
[48:29] church
[48:32] it's the word that you need friends
[48:35] and if your lamp is smoking up it's time
[48:37] to just simply trim it
[48:39] maybe trim some worldliness out of your
[48:40] life maybe trim some time out of your
[48:43] day so you can commit yourself to
[48:45] growing your
[48:47] roots as a as a wheat waiting for
[48:49] harvest and saying i know that rain has
[48:51] already fallen let me just grow my roots
[48:54] until i can grab a hold of it and reach
[48:56] down in this soil that god's planted me
[48:58] in and suck up this message suck up this
[49:01] word suck up this this beautiful
[49:03] outpouring
[49:05] of god's revelation that he's given us
[49:07] amen
[49:08] it's not to a group
[49:10] it's not
[49:12] some special dispensation of grace that
[49:14] we're still waiting for
[49:16] so i don't preclude that god would still
[49:18] work in that way i just say that
[49:21] our prophet said this he said i don't
[49:23] see anything that's left for the church
[49:25] now but the coming of the lord
[49:27] just keep your lamps trimmed and shine
[49:29] for him
[49:31] so that's all i can tell to you is just
[49:33] to keep your lamps trimmed
[49:36] so it's not a group but it's
[49:39] as we see in the laodicean church age is
[49:42] to whomsoever will open unto me behold i
[49:45] stand at the door and knock
[49:47] to whomsoever will open the door unto me
[49:49] i'll come in and i'll stop with them
[49:52] are you opening the door to christ
[49:56] oh that's different now isn't it right
[49:58] that's a little bit less comfortable
[50:00] because now we've got to look inward
[50:02] instead of looking outward pray fast
[50:05] pray pray something's about to break
[50:06] forth something is coming
[50:08] some great whoosh of the spirit is
[50:10] coming some torrential downpour that'll
[50:12] just carry us all away and we'll be
[50:14] helpless against it that's that's what
[50:16] the flesh wants
[50:18] something that just washes all of our
[50:20] troubles away
[50:23] but he says in laodicea
[50:25] i'm knocking at your heart's door
[50:28] are you going to open to me are you
[50:29] going to open to me on thursday morning
[50:32] are you going to come and sup with me
[50:34] are we going to dine together
[50:36] brother branham said it this way and
[50:38] trying to do sir got a service without
[50:40] it being his will he said
[50:42] i believe it was some nobleman that went
[50:44] over to wales to understand and figure
[50:45] out what all the mechanics was in the
[50:48] revival during the welsh revival does
[50:51] that just sound like us humans figure
[50:53] out what all the mechanics are write it
[50:54] down on notepad take it back home
[50:56] package it and and produce it on the
[50:58] shores of america
[51:00] and when they got off the ships with
[51:02] their tall hats and round collars a
[51:04] little policeman they found swinging his
[51:05] club around like that and they said my
[51:07] good man
[51:08] can you tell me where the welsh revival
[51:10] is
[51:11] how many remember where this little
[51:13] welshman said the revival was
[51:16] he said it's in me
[51:17] you're staring at it you're facing it
[51:19] right now the welsh revival is in me
[51:22] well i got something some news for you
[51:24] tonight there's something bigger than
[51:26] the welsh revival tonight
[51:28] there's a global revival there's a
[51:31] bright age that's broken forth there's a
[51:33] arising and a shining of jesus christ
[51:36] upon his people
[51:37] there's a bride's revival that's upon us
[51:40] the question is can you identify
[51:42] yourself with it and say you're looking
[51:44] at it you're looking at the bride's
[51:46] revival
[51:47] my i and my lord are in communion it's
[51:50] an invisible union you cannot see it but
[51:54] it's happening every moment of every day
[51:57] and i'm identified with it
[51:59] oh hallelujah
[52:01] let's stand
[52:02] tonight praise the lord
[52:05] and as you're standing i want to read
[52:07] just one verse
[52:10] james the
[52:11] practical apostle
[52:15] he says in chapter 5 be patient
[52:17] therefore brethren
[52:20] oh i believe that stands true to the
[52:22] church tonight as we wait for god's
[52:24] coming be patient unto the coming of the
[52:26] lord
[52:27] behold the husbandman
[52:29] waiteth for the precious through the
[52:31] earth
[52:32] he waits for those tender grapes as it
[52:34] were
[52:35] and he hath long patience for it until
[52:38] he received the early and the latter
[52:40] rain
[52:41] be also patient
[52:44] he says that a couple of times must be
[52:46] important amen be patient
[52:49] and what does he tell us to do he says
[52:51] establish your hearts
[52:53] for the coming of the lord draweth night
[52:57] amen so i hope i can just leave you with
[52:59] that tonight friends if
[53:01] if you're wanting a restoration with god
[53:03] if you're wanting revival to be
[53:05] revitalized in christ
[53:07] establish your hearts and what god has
[53:09] already given to us amen he's given us
[53:11] great and precious promises
[53:13] he gave us elijah he gave us malachi 4 5
[53:16] and 6. he revealed his word
[53:19] to to our hearts
[53:21] establish yourself
[53:23] make sure you're established in the
[53:24] present truth
[53:25] and i believe that there you'll find
[53:27] that that maturity that you're looking
[53:30] for
[53:31] don't look for another rain
[53:33] but make sure that you're printing the
[53:34] presence of the sun ripening before the
[53:36] combine comes and picks us up
[53:39] mark if you would come and we'll go
[53:41] ahead and close the service in the word
[53:43] of prayer
[53:44] dear lord jesus we just come before you
[53:46] father
[53:48] lord we're so appreciative
[53:51] of the word that you've given to our
[53:52] hearts lord
[53:54] a word of the lord that we can have
[53:56] confidence in the lord
[53:57] i remember the prophet that he said the
[53:59] the greatest
[54:01] vindication of my ministry
[54:04] i was on the edge of my seat when i read
[54:07] those words
[54:09] maybe it was the resurrection of the
[54:11] dead the
[54:12] cloud in the sky the
[54:14] pillar of fire above his head
[54:17] he said the greatest
[54:18] vindication of my ministry
[54:21] is the fruit that it brings forth
[54:23] in the hearts and the lightest believers
[54:27] lord i believe that that ministry was
[54:29] the ministry of jesus christ through
[54:31] your servant
[54:33] i wanted to go and accomplish everything
[54:35] that set out to do lord
[54:36] in my life i believe that would be the
[54:39] prayer of
[54:40] each person here lord
[54:42] maybe just with a lifted hand now we
[54:44] would each
[54:45] symbolize as a token to you lord
[54:49] that that is our desire that there would
[54:52] be a fruit that would be brought forth
[54:54] lord a harvest a crop a mature wheat
[54:57] lord
[54:59] granite lord may we each do our part
[55:01] each day to
[55:03] expose ourselves to that sunlight that
[55:07] christ light that word that you've given
[55:10] so we can become mature sun
