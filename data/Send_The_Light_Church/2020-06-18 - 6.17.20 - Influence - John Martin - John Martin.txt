TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but what an honor today that we could use our vessel to the Lord let him let him fill us and of course we have a part to play in that a preparation a heart and our vessel so he feels welcomed amen man praise the Lord good to be in church with you today and more and more of them seeing the importance of us being together we've got so many things that are attacking us left and right and we just need to be together more and more amen under the umbrella of the word of course amen turn with me if you would to the book of 2nd Kings chapter 5 second Kings chapter 5 I don't know if a request they got in probably did but sister Cheryl had taken sick certainly wasn't expecting that when we had seen her but she just she wasn't feel more it just all sudden start feeling sick and her Stumpy's appreciate your prayers for her amen well tonight we want to for a title talk about influence influence I believe we are all subject to being influenced by spirits and we also possess a power to influence and so we don't take that for subject the power to influence before we begin reading here in 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 let's look to the Lord and prayer together Heavenly Father we come to you as humbly as we know how at this moment we are sinners saved by grace we have fallen we have come short of your glory and we ask that the blood of Jesus Christ would cover us all at this time Laura that we would be in that nothing could hinder this service nothing could hinder you from revealing yourself and showing us how we can be more like you more equipped to stand against the enemy to be able to use the influence that you give us to help others Lord we need you tonight and we pray that you'd move in our midst in their hearts and bless us with the revelation of your precious words we commit the service in our lives into your hands now for your honor and and your glory we pray these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen well in Chapter five here this is the story of of naman and we've all have heard this story a number of times and naming the Bible says was a I captain of the host of the king of Syria he was very very close to the king he was uh he was a good man and was through him that they were able to have victory in the war the Bible says that he was a mighty man of value but he also had leprosy and he in and through the time of the war they were able to seize a handmaid that could be used for the name ins wife and and she got to be close to him but she wasn't in influence to name ins wife and she had wished that name in her her husband could get alone with the Prophet that was in the Land of Israel and naman would be healed and that was her desire and even though they weren't maybe of the same she had a spirit to want to try to help and and and and so that the word got out and then the word got out to the king and the king of Syria sent a message to the king of Israel that I'm sendin naman here to get healed by your prophets and this really disturbed the king of Israel and he thought they were starting to have some sort of quarrel and start a fight because who could a king how could he heal a man of leprosy so what not really being well in tune with perhaps the the Prophet because the Prophet was supposed to do it right not the king and so we want to pick this up in verse number eight and it was so when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore has now rent they clothes let him cover let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel notice the exclamation was to know that there's a prophet because if you believe in the prophets you're gonna prosper amen amen so naman came with his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the house of Elijah and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and I flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean and name and was raw and went away and said behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper are not AB a banner even ax and farm paw rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel may I not wash in them and be clean and so he turned and went away in a rage and his servants came here spake unto and said my father if the Prophet had bid me to do some great thing what does now not have done it how much rather then when he say it to the wash and be clean then went he down and dipped himself seven times into Jordan according to the saint of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean amen amen god bless you you may be seated we're just going to stop right there what a wonderful influence that the servants of naman were on naming just pointed him to the word of the Lord it was quite simple but yet a lot of times we ourselves don't know how to use the powerful tool of influence influences a very powerful to it is the power to be a compelling force to produce effects on actions opinions or behaviors and you see this if you look it up in the Bible or look it up in the dictionary it can help accomplish and achieve things it is used to affect or sway someone or something to a particular outcome this is the brother John definition influence is the power to create an atmosphere that brings about your will or your desire influence can be used for good or for bad and it simply depends on the motive and I would just want that to soak in why did the Prophet tell us to check our motives there's something about a motive that teaches us about the spirit that we're dealing with now we see influence plays a great part in politics in news in war and family issues and church situations it can be a very powerful tool look what this kolben 19 has done the influence that has had on the world on the stock market nobody can just like work together we'll make it through this however long it's going to take no let's just go crazy look at the riots the influence that this has had the the Democrats and Republican parties influence mayo and voting there's so much influence out there it's all around us motivated by spirits that are trying to accomplish its will use in human beings now if you've allowed your character to be molded by Christ then your influence can be a powerful tool for God but power to influence others without character is simply satanic so there's no Switzerland in this there's only two spirits what is God and what is the devil Satan was able to create an atmosphere in heaven that was more appealing and more exciting than gods more appealing more excited just want that to soak in he had power to influence other beings created by God against God's will revelations 12 for says that his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven Jude 1:6 says and the angels which kept not their first estate left their own habitation I mean I am sure that Satan did not leave the next day after God created him no Satan created an atmosphere that was more appealing than truth than God's Word than the eternal life he had the ability to create an atmosphere that looked more appealing that the other angels could gravitate to and say yeah is worth it sake was able to create a will that was more exciting than God's boring will that's why he's so good at being able to do in churches today people want concerts they want to feel good they want to be entertained I can see Satan telling his demon angels let's entertain the people so they'll be less likely to surrender their lives to God we were not born of the Spirit when we were born in the flesh it's a transformation it's a it's a regeneration it nature changed and that God uses all sorts of trials and in times and situations to bring about his character and his nature in us and we have to learn to surrender our lives to God but Saint knows if he entertains us that we won't get serious about having to change her nature now God didn't make any mistakes when he created Lucifer he was an angel of light he bore God's light he led the other angels and worship and other ministries of God God made him perfect in all his ways the motto says Lucifer was flawless until his will became more appealing than his own makers will say Lucifer knew who created him but his will became more appealing than his maker and you've all created something you've all made something can you imagine whatever you made can you imagine brother Mike you make him this nice sign and the sign just gets up and starts walking over here and says I want to say this know I created it for this purpose to give to this person to bless them with this you just can't go over there and do what you want to do but that's what Lucifer did Lucifer started to defile the sanctuary of heaven with his selfishness his pride he wanted to exalt himself above God's will yeah now we don't want to just say above God because we'll never do that but we will about God's will now listen Saints I'm not just telling you a story that happened in heaven I want you to realize that this that's our lives now if you want an idea of what went on in heaven before Satan was cast out true with me to second Timothy chapter 3 second Timothy chapter 3 verse number one we're gonna read the first five verses there now the scripture starts out this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come this is just the manifestation of really went on in heaven now we just want to read it like this Satan became a lover of himself Calvinists bolster proud blasphemer can you say Amen is that not what Lucifer did in heaven disobedient to his creator unfaithful for what God did for him he became unholy without natural affection for God and the other angels he became a juice breaker a false accuser I imagine he was falsely accusing God to the other angels trying to get him on his side incontinent fierce despisers of those angels who would not side with him traitor heady highminded lovers of his own pleasure more than a lover of God's will God's will became - boring - boring Satan kept a form of his godliness but he denied the power to live right from such turn away same thing that's happening in the last days in the church he got the influence right through to the church Satan is the master of deceit there's no one that can influence a person a home a business or a church for selfish reasons like Satan can yes he creates his selfish atmosphere and offers personal gain instead of character to people first he offers personal gain over character like the Pharisees they love the praises of men more than they loved praising God think about that they did what they character to praise God they wanted the praises of men more they wanted recognition they wanted something down here they wanted their will it was more appealing than God deserves all the glory personal gain over character I hope you're seeing look at what look at let's take a look at what happened in the Garden of Eden Satan influenced the most subtle beast of God's creation and perverted him away from God's will now we're talking about the most subtle beast not talking about Eve right now say he influenced the most subtle beast of all God's creation there was only one hire that was man yes Satan created an atmosphere that he enjoyed and wanted to benefit from Saint created an atmosphere that the most subtle beasts enjoyed thought this would be a good idea that he could benefit from Satan may have told him isn't Eve so beautiful she's right in the image with God himself you know wouldn't it be nice to be like her closer to God cuz you know she's closer to God she's in the image you're not right now you can only bring forth of your kind but if you were to be with her you could bring the human race right into your kind and make a greater and more intelligent super subtle race that was appealing to the most subtle Beast it wasn't like he hat you know put him out of headlock and beat him up he influenced him because that most subtle beast muted himself willingly and said this is a good idea I don't want to be down here I'd rather be closer to the image of God so Satan created an atmosphere that influenced the most subtle beast to carry out his idea because this is really came from Satan himself after submitting to Satan's enticement the most soft obese led his vessel to the devil he said have your way I'm in unity with this influence right Romans chapter 6 verse 16 says know ye not that to whom you huge yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are whether eat to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience on two rights and scientists I'll probably get back to the scripture but I want you to understand that we have the ability to healed our vessel to one influence or the other now while under the anointing of the tree of knowledge of good and evil the most subtle beasts began to create an atmosphere around Eve and Eve was enticed in the wrong atmosphere if she wouldn't have been if she wouldn't have got in the wrong out in this fear if she wouldn't allowed the wrong atmosphere see you I believe Eve was allowed to be around the most subdue beasts Eve was not around not allowed to go eat of the tree of knowledge of good evil which was the spirit of the devil that got inside that most of the beasts so we can't trust one another you couldn't trust that most of the beasts got her in trouble hey any one of us can go off the deep end give it time I tell you that does not the Bible say if the Lord doesn't come there be no flesh saved if you don't come quickly he keeps waiting things are just getting ridiculous that's why it's important to be in the right atmosphere to create the right atmosphere and to live in it and you have the ability to create the right atmosphere when it's wrong and to stay right there in it it's not always about the atmosphere that your flesh and Joy's but you must maintain an atmosphere around you that's best for your soul right we all know what it's like to be in an atmosphere that we enjoy that's not good for our soul I want us to turn to Genesis chapter 3 and just maybe read a little about it as we as we read in Genesis chapter so I want you to keep in mind that Satan wanted to produce an offspring and have a kingdom that was greater than God's but he couldn't create an offspring right he couldn't create so he perverted God's creation and how Satan enticed Eve to the most subtle beast with the idea that she could be in control of her will and choose her own will why wait for God we all are enticed with that thing all you gotta do is think about all the things you want to do and you don't even think about saying the Lord will and if you do say the Lord won't you don't really mean it you're just saying because it's the thing to say it doesn't come from the heart comes from the head it's like quoting scriptures the double quote scriptures Satan gave the most up to be something that God didn't offer God wasn't gonna offer the most subtle beasts to be anything more than what God created him to be but Satan could offer him more yeah just like he offers us more yeah and now Satan is going to offer something to Eve that God didn't offer remember brother Graham says Satan God Eve to lust after knowledge all right let's begin reading Genesis chapter 3 now this the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman he ate have God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden noticed he took only part of the truth it's true because he did say the word you can eat of every tree but he left out the except yes but he's still quoted part of it why because Satan always gives us a part of the truth to get us off if he just came to us with pitchforks and fire and and negative evil we would never listen to him but he comes to us with a part of the truth so we listen and soon as we listen it sounds right and that reasoning is what catches us and a woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but hallelujah but she knew the word but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden of God in the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die so she gave the word back she gave the word right back to him praise God that's what we're supposed to do but you know Satan wasn't giving up he had convinced that most subtle beasts if you really want to be more superior and be more like Eve you got to make this happen I know it's how he had a determination he wasn't gonna give up and the serpent began to beguile Eve and said unto the woman ye shall not surely die oh my I got confusion in my mind right now all all until this very moment I've always heard preached that if I partake of that tree I'm gonna die and I even told them oh so two beasts she probably did not recognize who it was that was speaking to her that it really was at the loss of toby's but it was really Satan inside a more subtle beast why it's important that we understand what spirit speaking to us and I don't care who's talking for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil right there she lusted for that ability to be able to to discern to know what was good to know what was evil she wanted her eyes to me she wanted to be like God we need to be careful maybe there are certain things that God does not want you to get into maybe he wants you to take the Prophet for what it what he said maybe he just want you to believe trust him yeah because if you start going in an area maybe the enemy will be right there just to confuse you because this is really what happened right to eat she got confused she thought God was holding out on her you mean there's something that I could get by doing this that God didn't give me it's appealing Satan's influence is always appealing for your will but not gods and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant for the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made them aprons and when they heard the voice of the God walking in the in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden when we feel that feeling of wanting to hide something's wrong I'm not saying that we should all be picture-perfect but we got to understand what spirit is influencing us the power of influence should never be taken lightly it's a very powerful force when you read Genesis chapter 4 it's also quite easy to see how Satan influenced Cain he got mad he got mad at God for not accepting the sacrifice as well as he got mad at Abel for being accepted by God and if he just got rid of him got rid of them God would have to look at him the influence that Satan has my brother branham said if we go and we actually say something that affects the influence of you looking at somebody in a negative way [Music] it's really the same spirit and so eat therefore you're guilty of the same murder and look at this Kane murdered Abel yeah course Jesus gave Satan the credit he was a liar from the beginning a murderer from the beginning the influence came from him but the point that I'm trying to say to you when you actually feel negative towards somebody yeah you you think you're right Kane thought he was right get rid of Abel because God wasn't fair with him sacrifice look beautiful who wants some blood all over you anyways so when you go and you're tempted to think something negative about somebody to say something negative about somebody remember it may seem so right in your eyes so did it came yeah you can't go by that you have to go by simply one thing it's wrong to do it yeah it's evil to do it so wrong influence God did not make us in that position he put us in it in a position to find the wrong things about our lives and to work on them are you with me now you might say well now brother John Cain was of that wicked one he was serpent seed and that's why it all happened nothing really to do with the power of influence I'm just gonna go on you know predestination seed for a moment okay if that's true then tell me why then evil why was the serpent seed as well think think about this for a second Eve was that serpent seed but she got under the power of influence so whether you're God's seed or serpent seed the power of influence can affect you the same you just can't go by on the child of God or they're not a child of God we're talking about the power of influence is very strong never ever underestimate the power of influence with all the thoughts that come into your mind you're always being influenced now listen to this by one spirit or another all the time there's no Switzerland in your thoughts and the influence now sometimes it's real obvious to see which one is which when you're getting bombarded a lot from the devil or even have any places just praising God and you're crying and you're loving him it's easy to see those but there are times that the spirits are so close so close that's when there's most religious that it's right doctrinally perhaps but the spirit could be wrong because Satan does use the word he does use a cracks it well that person did punch me in the face they did run me off the road they did say this about me they wrote this about me facts yes but does not give us any spirit to come against them you always always want to be under the influence of the right spirit but it don't happen by because we're elect now one spirit will lead you just like it led Christ to lay down your life yeah to help others yes to carry out God's will that's that's all that that Jesus did he lay down his life to carry out the will of the Father ain't gonna be any different in you and I now you're a child of God and we need to present our bodies back to God Hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and the things that accompany salvation so God's Spirit is expecting other things of us yes than other people that call himself Christians yes and don't you think he has a higher expectation of his bride yes look he had a higher expectation of job have you not considered my job like my job have you not considered my servant job there is none like him and all the world yes I want to be like that don't want to go through what he went through but I want to be like that but you know I'll just say it like this you don't have to go through what he went through to become what he is because he was that before he went through it we can be like him we can be under the influence of the Holy Spirit Romans chapter 12 verse 1 I'm talking about the one spirit that's influencing you that's leading you I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service so you're a child of God you're his bride present your body back to God yes well what does that mean brother John won't care to know what it means don't let the thing the word just go off your back and like I lied whatever it sounds too much like responsibility don't want to think about it if you're real serious about really wanting to make sure you're being influenced by the right spirit you've got to listen to what I'm saying you can see brother's how this is tying in with trying the spirit now the other spirit the other spirit because there's only two that's going to influence you the other spirit will lead you to exercise your own will your own rights yes you don't have to lay down your life it might say something like this now if you're a a child of God didn't God say that you could eat of every tree of the garden and just kind of like leave something else then the Bible say that Christ paid your debt it's not by works you can never be saved by your own merits kind of omit part of the word yeah never telling you this part I would like to see Satan come and tell you this that if Christ died for us then we're all dead and that we should not henceforth live unto ourselves but unto Him which died for us and rose again lay down our lives for the Brethren and it's a different spirit saying this now we're gonna do that now the satan spirit may say you're you're an automatic heir with Christ if you be the elect of God you can't be deceived I mean it's worth now think about this predestination is in the Bible it's a real word and it really means something but why did God fear say that Minister should stay away from it but they don't feel that fear of God they think they got it all handled because Satan can take that word and confuse people make him feel secure when they ought to be stretching forth demarcus making sure that they're doing the rest of the things that the satan has left out remember when Jesus told the Pharisees he said he said you've taken part of the word but you've left out the weightier matters of life yeah Satan does that so I understand these scriptures I understand you let can be to see if I understand that we're we're joint heirs with Christ do you know that what kind of thoughts will lead a carnal mind to believe when those are spoken to them to believe that they're never wrong a carnal mind be deceived God sent a prophet to tell us that we should always bear a spirit and an attitude that I could be wrong it's a good quote it's a good thing to say but to live that spirit to live out that everyday st. always leave something out that's why I want to say the Lord willing let's take a look at it in Matthew chapter 4 how this other in this other spirit influenced Jesus to do his own will Matthew chapter 4 7 word verse number 1 so awful quite in here I don't see the pages out of here no amens it's like a wake-up we're having Church today don't let the influence you to you know go night night then was Jesus led up of the Spirit to the runners to be tempted of the devil God will allow you to go in the ring with the devil and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward a hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread well we know that he was he was creating an atmosphere here manipulation if thou be the Son of God if you're a real Christian then why don't you just take God's Word and just say this so you can see that there was truth Cobin 19 and this whole mess up and of the world and and being away from it has got people so distracted in so many different places going and doing so many different things I just don't see I see it's an opportunity for the devil to take advantage of it I got thinking I got you know the Bible says smite the shepherd the sheep was scattered I think Satan found a way to scatter sheep without smite the Shepherd so much division in this message we need to come together pray for one another because we need God's grace and help I need your prayers we need one another's prayers we're not in a place where we're just a little bit better than the other and he answered in verse 4 and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now notice what he was saying here don't come to me with your Sh to try to get me to buy into that I gotta take the whole word Saint gets most people because he gives them the word so they can yeah that's good brother so they could reason whatever they're going through then the devil taketh him up into a holy city and setting him on a pinnacle of the temple and with each temptation you're gonna see here that Satan lifts up Jesus more lifts him up takes him up higher makes them feel better offers him more you'll see it Satan was trying to influence Jesus he took him up higher to a pentacle trying to manipulate him and he sayeth on the in verse 6 if thou be the Son of God cast thyself dumb for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest thou lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone he is quoting the same word of God that the most subtle beast oh my did you know that most subtle beasts knew the word of God and he knew how to only speak part of the word and lead part of it out so he's good at that he's good at when we come to church only take part of the message that deals the best that we know we're already doing that we can feel like we're a Christian about but you don't have to worry about anything that makes that challenges you because that just makes you feel bad did you ever like a coach when you played your heart out you did your best and he says come on you can do better than that I always like the one's a good good job good job way to go out there but a good coach he sees your potential you may think you're there but he knows there's more in you the bride there's more in the bride just because we're bride it doesn't that doesn't mean anything we still have to get there get to a place with us pottery can we have to be ready so it's okay for him to cause us to get culture to him amen verse number seven Jesus said unto Him it is written again you missed part of the word thou shall not tempt the LORD thy God it's important to know the word because Satan's coming to you with part of the word tomorrow and if you reason with that thing he'll influence you the wrong way with God's Word look at this verse 8 again to take the devil taketh him up into exceeding high mountain and showing him all the kingdoms of the world of the gourd he just kept takin him up he'll do that to you he'll give you a good feeling get you up there make you feel like you don't have to you to the Lord and he saith unto Him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship Me but he says that to everyone of us in so many words then say it Jesus on him get thee hence Satan I want to stop this conversation I'm done with it get behind me thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve in other words I am NOT going to serve myself because when you serve yourself you're serving the devil notice the devil leaved him left him and angels came in minister right afterwards you know we just don't have time to do everything you you it's awful quiet I'm glad you got something with me saw the piece you're not serious about that too serious about that remember when Satan quotes to you the word or the message of the hour he will always leave something out and there's a purpose for that a little bit off he can't get us to go to a bar he can't get us to drink a fifth or whiskey but he can just you think about that he said he's a Christian he's a message because he's influencing you to relax and steer you away from giving yourself your all to the Lord that's not trying to do if you can stay a mediocre Christian if you could just come to church pay your eyes just keep doing that that's all that really matters this thing about getting ready well the blood makes you ready I don't know why it's so quiet doing right now you know we should just pack up we're different hey we're of the group that's ready to go we don't have to search anymore would just stay at home and we'll wait all will come and we won't have preaching we'll just have singing worship testify come on come on where do you want to take this God is you you more and we can't give more until we're gonna be challenged to get more because the devil don't want you to get more he's doing everything he can to get you not to give more you've given enough you've given your life to God I just go through the course of the day and I think you may be alone with your thoughts and still be greatly influenced or you may be talking to someone direct and become influenced or you may hear somebody talking and be influenced by what you hear but you are always being influenced by one spirit or another now that's kind of scary yeah now you know what we do for Christians we just give everybody the benefit no not a curse I'm supposed to be good and I understand about giving the benefit of the doubt but to me you don't give the benefit of the doubt blindly no matter what to everybody for everything how are you gonna try the spirit to see if it's of the Lord or not when there's a it's something that just doesn't make sense to you when there's a puzzling situation you just can't clearly see what just give the benefit the doubt move on I could be wrong I'm not gonna sit here and judge when I don't know I saw you speeding today no I didn't I saw it well I didn't all right I believe you god bless you you give the benefit of the doubt when it's it's obvious you can't know for sure but you don't walk around everybody you're talking to every time they're talking to you that's God talking to you don't do that they could be under a spirit that they're deceiving they don't know it now whichever one of these atmospheres you you'd yourself to is the very one that you'll be influenced by and the one that you are influenced by is the one that you will influence others by yes you can see that between Satan more subtle beast Eve oops just just what flows right through God is God is looking for vessels they use an insane you the blind lead the blind they all fall in the ditch yeah we need to know who we're following I love this I love the word I love that I'm imperfect you're okay with that and you know if I preach something that's not kind that's contrary to this word that's your duty that's your job our confidence is in the word God is allowed to use human beings who are imperfect in fact he loves showing off 7th grade education hillbillies amen remember when the angel of the Lord told brother Branham that he liked to saw Moni believe it wasn't because he liked to be no it was the message that we need to start exercising more which is to believe to come to church with the excitement of believing this word more than just yeah I never liked that but I agree no all they believe this is to help you and the more that you receive it inside the more you can walk out and not be influenced by the wrong spirit and therefore not let your body be used to influence others wrong and not even know what you're doing a lot of times we manipulate certain situations as certain people and say certain things about certain things just to get something to happen I wasn't gonna say that don't know where that came from but that is the truth because we're steering so bad how we want something and we think we're so right about what we see lord help us the angel of the Lord was creating a challenging atmosphere for the people to believe I can see that it wasn't just why I kind of I'm gonna send this song over song so cuz I really like it no we've got to believe God's Word war than what we're believing when we Joe Gabriel was set to deliver God's Word to Mary he started out telling her that she was highly favored and God was with her he was creating a good atmosphere or right atmosphere and he said Mary you're going to conceive a son and Mary said how shall this be seen I know not Amanda it's okay it's okay how am I gonna manifest all the fruits of the spirit overcome how am I gonna get rid of this thing in my life how am I gonna love my enemy it's okay to say that you've never experienced it before if you never knew this before the holy ghost is gonna overshadow me yes and by the way if that doesn't give you enough faith to believe let me remind you about your cousin you know she conceived it's been six months now she's of old age she was beyond yeah with God nothing shall be impossible the angel of the Lord was influencer creating an atmosphere to make her believe she's that some onus she said be it unto me according to thy word the handmaid of the Lord present yourself to the word that's preach from the pulpit present yourself to that word say it be it not to me don't con the cart carnally and just because it's Church get something from God walk away with something take something home that you can say I received it all has to do with your faith you cannot allowed this work to be entertained into your heart it has to be believed in your heart don't wait for your favorite preacher what if he doesn't show up for a while the word that's being preached to us is to build an atmosphere cross to believe I'm just gonna take a few minutes more please bear with me I never want to hold people's time now remember at all times not only when we are influenced by some spirit but all the time continuously we are being influenced by spirits whether we're alone with somebody talking hearing somebody they're spirits that are dealing with us and those spirits that are influencing us are trying to cause us to influence others with Jesus he said now you don't know what I've done but you're gonna know soon I want you to go wash one another's feet yes he said now you're my disciples and I'm leaving you now but I want you to go yell preach this gospel every creature that spirit was influencing his disciples the very same thing he did when he stood and he looked at the multitude he's and he he looked at them with compassion today they're they're sheep without a shepherd of course they won't you do anything but that I just I want to read this quote to you can I read a little bit we created an atmosphere around us that influences others as well the transcendent message identification it says now you have seen people that you just love to be around yet they might not bracket of society and again they might be of a different race they're the colored or the brown or the yellow but there is just something about that character that you just love be loved to be in their presence he says because each person is a little dynamo of their own and you put out in an atmosphere yeah every one of you like it or not put out an atmosphere I don't care if you're quiet they're quiet one among us or the loudest one among us there's an atmosphere that you put out and I'm talking about God's will God's presence or that Devils will which is presenting you to do your will right either one and then you see people that were noble but yet you were always bad to get away from them it's just they create such an atmosphere around where you are nothing against them they're nice people but you just don't like the atmosphere they're in yeah now listen to this he said and their character creates whatever they are yes it makes them what they are yeah see the atmosphere that we create comes from what we are inside and the message is your life worthy of the gospel brother Branham says and did you know you are a little Creator yourself yes you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why you just love that type of person have you seen that congregation says Amen have you seen that okay just as kind there you are like to be around them they create the atmosphere by the life they live yeah the way they talk and their conversation then you've seen those that every time you you shunned them all time they want to talk about something evil if I understand correctly God said there's none good they're all evil why because they all seek their own they all seek their own they want to do their own thing right so what evil are they talking about come on the quicker you answer these questions the quicker we're gonna be over Church self self will self will is evil yes all the time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody say oh my there they come they're going to criticize somebody there he's in here now he's going to talk about this man all they were doing is tell or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around them see they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere yeah and the things that you think on and the things that you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere you don't have to be sitting in front of a television for eight hours be all things you think about so we create an atmosphere around us no doubt about it if the Holy Spirit is influencing you at the time it will eventually lead people to Christ what did the Holy Spirit do to you what does it do to you is it going to use you different than how he deals with you what is he interested about you getting ready to make it to make a rapture first we have to get saved right gotta walk up this seven steps of perfection yes we can't be like the the rabbit and just get distracted go run over here go run over there stay in the race keep marching forward and if they already know Christ then the spirit inside of you is going to influence them to a higher walk with Christ because that's who Christ is now if you're under a carnal atmosphere in your mind usually influenced by a different spirit it will not lead people to Jesus or how to make him Lord of their lives or a closer walk for them no sir it won't do that a carnal influence is anything but that anything but that it's all about the spirits motive that's creating the atmosphere in your mind if it's God spirit he's serious about getting us ready he cares about our soul about the condition where it's at and where he wants it and how to help us and you know what he's still laying down his life for the brother he's just doing it inside of you now if it's not God's Spirit then well it's certainly that spirit or those spirits or who's ever talking is not really serious about getting ready they may make you feel like they care about you about your flesh but not about yourself because they're not even dealing with it not interested in going the Second Mile not interested in sacrificing laying down his life and if you recognize these two spirits when you're thinking thoughts it's going to be easy to see I like the influence that nameís servants had unnamed they could have just been off talking about whatever you know there's you know pretty big fish in that Jordan River I didn't want to say that because we got fishermen in here but there was an interest and if you're a servant of God you're interested in helping someone that may be even higher than you a servant is helping others influence what are we influenced I I can influence brother Mark that he will that will be such good friends and he would let me use his car you can influence people for personal gain that's the same thing that same is doing he influences people for personal gain what's his personal gain he wants to exalt his throne above the throne of God God is interested in getting people closer to him when he gets us convinced that we're pretty close right now it's very easy to get involved in something else let's say you are close to God why don't you help somebody like there's no excuse for us not being anointed by the Spirit of God led by the Spirit of God to help somebody any spirit that's separate from that that doesn't do that it's influencing you just a little bit off track 9 understand we've got to go to talk about other things I understand that I don't let it control right start allowing God to use you present your body to him and let him use you to help the person you're talking to you're talking to him anyways let it help them let the Lord use you let's stand together thank you for your patience amen that's about a heart in prayer just whatever you desire in your heart concerning what the Lord has spoken to you tonight just place that before him we all want to be not only more aware what spirits influencing us but we want to be used by God to influence others to him amen amen Heavenly Father's we come before you today we thank you for your word we thank you for the examples in your word we thank you for for showing us clearly more disse more decisively the two spirits that are out there that are trying to influence one way or the other Lord you have equipped your bride you are equipping your bride there is an invisible union of your bride and you happening the Lord we just are asking you humble as we know how as we leave from this building tonight with this word that you've given us that we can begin to think on these things through the course of tomorrow and the next day and the next day and begin to think about the influence that is coming into our minds from the things that we're thinking the things that we're hearing and and lord help us to quickly see is that spirit laying down his life to see you become the Lord of their life Lord that's a towel an hour that you've told us to be sober to be vigilant that you're come in an hour when the world think of not Lord where you don't want to be caught up in everything and miss the influence of the Holy Spirit in our lives Lord there's some hearts here that are are open to the things that you've spoken and they want to be used by you you know their hearts Lord you see them I pray that you would grant to them the desires of their heart Lord I know that we spoken in such a way that it could be easily misunderstood what was spoken the Lord I'm trusting you that you take the spirit of this message in which it was preached and that you were rightly divided to the harm that would question Lord for we need you in this hour and if there's ever an hour that we need to be serious about your coming it's in this hour when the whole world is going in every other direction that you we're turning to you Lord we love you tonight we thank you tonight we thank you for your great Holy Spirit that's influencing our lives to make you Lord of our lives to make you more of what you want to be we ask that you would use us lord to help our our to help one another to help our fellow brother to use our bodies and our mouths and our thoughts and our actions to lead others to you we commit ourselves and your hands now Lord with this message but this word for us let us be the influence to the two others that you've called us to be and we give you the praise for these things or we humbly ask them now in Jesus Christ's name do you love Jesus do you love the word Amen praise God do you let everything that I do be pleasing to you but everything I pursue be pleasing no Lord to
