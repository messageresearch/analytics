[18:28] amen you know I mean when we have an
[18:30] injury it's you know it's one thing but
[18:33] when a little child like that has an
[18:35] infra of course it's pretty devastating
[18:37] so uh let's just keep her in our hearts
[18:41] amen

[36:09] it could be a lot worse and
[36:12] Brother Bruce always does his homework
[36:15] he's uh he's the man to get if you want
[36:18] something done right
[36:20] he'll make sure it's done right and
[36:23] that's a really good quality to have
[36:26] amen
[36:29] well
[36:30] um how many has been thinking
[36:35] about the place of I don't care
[36:39] yeah brother Ferguson has been speaking
[36:44] to us in the men's meetings about being
[36:46] more sensitive
[36:49] and to the way that God would speak to
[36:51] us and the different ways that he would
[36:53] speak to us and
[36:56] brother Mark has been talking about the
[36:59] choices that we make are very important
[37:03] and
[37:04] I I just uh I feel that
[37:10] the enemy
[37:12] camouflages himself
[37:14] in areas right around us right in our
[37:16] own minds and our thoughts and we don't
[37:18] quite recognize it and the whole purpose
[37:22] of it is to expose the enemy so when he
[37:25] does come to us with little attitudes
[37:27] and things that we can quickly resist
[37:30] them
[37:31] because that's that's the greatest
[37:33] damage that he could do is inside of us
[37:36] and this is the only one that we have
[37:38] control over and us that are their
[37:41] husbands or heads of the home we have to
[37:43] watch out for our wives and our children
[37:45] and so seeing that I don't care creeping
[37:49] in is is you gotta you gotta get rid of
[37:52] it quickly and we we gotta bind together
[37:57] and bind together
[37:59] um
[38:00] tonight we want to talk about the Gates
[38:02] of Hell
[38:03] before we get there we're going to talk
[38:05] about the gates so turn with me if you
[38:07] would to Matthew chapter 7.
[38:11] we're looking forward to
[38:13] the fellowship this uh
[38:16] this Sunday
[38:20] it's just good to be together with
[38:23] brothers and sisters of light precious
[38:25] faith amen
[38:27] let's look to the Lord in in prayer
[38:30] let's also I don't know if a request got
[38:33] in for uh from sister Kathleen about her
[38:38] daughter Emily who's very sick with RSV
[38:41] virus
[38:43] and she's not getting better and and she
[38:46] wanted us to hold her up in prayer we
[38:49] know that she's been a big help to
[38:51] Sister Kathleen over there and if she's
[38:54] sick I'm not sure uh if she's able to
[38:57] help like she'd like to so if we could
[38:59] just remember her in prayers we go to
[39:03] him right now Heavenly Father we thank
[39:05] you that you've all that you've given
[39:07] each of us strength and health to be

[39:19] with enough health and strength to be

[39:22] bottom of our heart Lord as we look to

[39:33] sister Kathleen Lord we want them to to

[39:40] you Lord as they used to when they were
[39:42] here and father her sister has a prayer
[39:46] request for her daughter that's been so
[39:49] faithful lord it's just been a real
[39:52] Saint and a real blessing Lord in so
[39:57] many ways and we just pray that Lord you

[40:04] unite together in prayer that you the
[40:06] great physician would go and do the
[40:10] complete work in her body you are that
[40:13] virus Lord that is taken over and Lord

[40:19] she's getting better that she's on the
[40:22] men Lord may you touch her
[40:25] we love you for it we thank you for it
[40:28] Lord Jesus Lord as we before we look
[40:31] into your word we ask God that you would
[40:34] prepare our hearts for it Lord give us
[40:37] the right ears to hear the the right
[40:41] heart to perceive to understand and give
[40:44] us the grace to walk in it and a Lord
[40:46] above everything give us the the proper
[40:49] Revelation that you'd have us to take
[40:51] from these scriptures or we commit this
[40:53] service to you and all the needs that we
[40:55] have into your hands for your honor we
[40:58] pray in Jesus name amen amen
[41:02] may God receive glory for every
[41:06] for every Revelation that he gives us
[41:08] amen
[41:09] amen Matthew chapter 7 starting with
[41:11] verse number 12. therefore all things
[41:14] whatsoever ye would men should do to you
[41:19] do ye even sow to them for this is the
[41:24] law and the prophets
[41:26] enter in at the Straight Gate for wide
[41:29] is the gate and Broad is the way that
[41:32] leadeth to destruction and many there be
[41:35] which go in there at because
[41:39] straight is the gate
[41:41] and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
[41:44] life and few there be that find it
[41:48] amen God bless you may be seated
[41:55] well
[41:57] everybody
[41:58] wants to be thought of the very best
[42:02] of it right
[42:05] the scripture says that we should think
[42:07] the very best of everybody because if if
[42:11] we're to do unto others like we want
[42:13] them to do unto us then we can never do
[42:15] we should never do anything you know or
[42:18] say anything ill or or we we should be
[42:22] what we want them to be of course our
[42:24] concept is we take upon ourselves often
[42:28] the place of God in other words what you
[42:31] do to me I'm going to pay back to you
[42:34] and I'll remember this because you did
[42:36] that and we're kind of taking the place
[42:39] of God
[42:40] and in reality the the law is that
[42:44] whatever we would want others to do to
[42:46] us that's what we should initiate
[42:49] to others not only do what we feel it is
[42:54] deserved but we need to initiate we need
[42:57] to be the one laying down the life for
[42:59] others
[43:01] and then Jesus gets in in speaking about
[43:03] the two gates because one gate is
[43:06] certainly going to not do that
[43:08] and and the Straight Gate is going to
[43:12] uh one of these Gates it leads to heaven
[43:16] to eternal life and we learn that's
[43:18] living for others so this one gate leads
[43:20] to living for others where the other
[43:22] gate it leads to a selfish life living
[43:25] for yourself and it it ends up turning
[43:28] into a destruction
[43:31] a destruction and I I'd like to kind of
[43:34] call this the Gate of Hell because it
[43:37] leads to a destruction
[43:40] the the gate that leads to life it's
[43:43] it's a Straight Gate where the other
[43:45] gate it's a wide gate and when you think
[43:48] about a Straight Gate you can think of
[43:50] like the The Straits of Mackinac The
[43:52] Straits of uh uh Gibraltar uh and most
[43:57] Straits
[43:59] um they they narrow down they come to a
[44:02] small a small opening and I think the
[44:05] smallest one is the Straits of Tatar and
[44:08] it's near uh near Russia somewhere over
[44:10] there and so it's really hard just to to
[44:13] take a big boat and just go through
[44:15] there real easy it's actually difficult
[44:18] when you're in the ocean you just go and
[44:20] you don't have to worry about things but
[44:22] when you come into a straight uh
[44:24] straight you got to pay attention when
[44:26] we're in
[44:28] um Georgia and
[44:30] um by Savannah others were the big
[44:33] barges uh come in there and it is so
[44:37] narrow where they got to go that they
[44:39] don't allow the drivers of the votes
[44:41] whatever they're called I don't know if
[44:43] they're called drivers or what but they
[44:44] don't allow them to drive the boats and
[44:46] they're not allowed to and Savannah the
[44:49] the shipping yard will take out their
[44:51] little tug bolts out there and they will
[44:53] be the ones that are doing the directing
[44:55] because it's so hard to navigate in
[44:58] there and this this gate that uh is the
[45:02] straight that leads to life is it's very
[45:04] it's a small a small uh area to get
[45:08] through
[45:09] and uh it's very very difficult to to
[45:14] make it through we know that Jesus is
[45:17] the Straight Gate
[45:19] he he he is the door and as great a God
[45:23] as he is uh his standard is is so so
[45:28] narrow
[45:30] you've heard of somebody being
[45:31] narrow-minded you know you're just so
[45:34] narrow-minded well Jesus is very
[45:37] narrow-minded he's very narrow-minded
[45:40] and and he has you have to stay with the
[45:44] word you can't deviate from the word
[45:47] and
[45:48] um in order to find this Straight Gate
[45:51] you literally have to seek it
[45:55] because the the Bible Jesus said few
[45:58] people find it
[46:01] yet all people want to go to heaven but
[46:03] why only a few people find it because
[46:05] they're not willing to seek but if you a
[46:09] little bit earlier in this chapter it
[46:10] talks about seek and you shall I knock
[46:12] the door shall be open and this is the
[46:15] way that you find God Is by pouring out
[46:18] your heart and seeking after God and
[46:21] then God chose you the way
[46:23] it's just it's all about relationship
[46:29] this
[46:30] this wide gate when you think about the
[46:33] wide gate
[46:35] let's just think about it's it's wide
[46:37] enough to fit any idea that man has
[46:43] any idea that man has can go through
[46:47] there any idea any religion and this is
[46:50] what I think that's what goes through
[46:52] that gate amen and that's it's it's very
[46:55] broad it's very spacious it it has room
[46:58] for anybody's idea
[47:01] but what are the gates of hell
[47:04] they're really demons tempting us to not
[47:08] do God's will
[47:13] whereas the Straight Gate it opens up to
[47:16] a narrow way
[47:19] and that way is Christ
[47:21] the thing is when we we think about
[47:24] these Gates
[47:25] we can think that we have already
[47:28] entered into this gate
[47:30] when we accepted Christ as our personal
[47:33] Savior and we repented and we got
[47:35] baptized and we we entered into that
[47:37] gate
[47:39] and
[47:40] if we say Amen to that uh
[47:44] I'm good to go with that but the way is
[47:48] narrow
[47:50] the way is narrow and we just can't take
[47:55] our foot off the gas because we've
[47:57] entered into the gate and kind of Coast
[47:59] the rest away and and just take certain
[48:02] scriptures and just you know I'm going
[48:04] to make it because I'm predestined it it
[48:06] just doesn't work like that
[48:09] there's a false sense of security and
[48:12] there's a true sense of security in
[48:14] Christ
[48:15] but you have to follow the way
[48:19] the gate it leads to the way and the way
[48:22] is straight and narrow that this way
[48:24] it's it's a harder way
[48:27] and if you if you look up that word
[48:30] narrow it means crowded with afflictions
[48:33] trouble sufferings tribulations this is
[48:38] God's way
[48:40] think about it this is the
[48:42] that's why it's so hard to find because
[48:45] nobody's excited about that
[48:49] I mean in God's way you're either in a
[48:51] trial or you're going to be going into
[48:53] one
[48:55] you don't spend much time just taking it
[48:58] easy
[49:00] the kingdom of God suffered violence
[49:03] and we've got to take it by force we've
[49:06] got to take it by force they that live
[49:08] golly shall suffer persecution so this
[49:11] way it's a harder way
[49:17] I would like us to view God's way as
[49:19] always being set before us
[49:22] just like we talked about this day for
[49:25] me and my house we're going to serve the
[49:27] Lord but we've got to make that decision
[49:29] every day it's not just I made the
[49:32] decision once so it's going to happen
[49:33] automatically it's not you're going to
[49:36] wake up and wanting to do your own thing
[49:38] because your flesh is just that way
[49:42] and so you it has to be it you have to
[49:45] teach uh yourself you have to learn from
[49:49] God to deny your flesh to crucify your
[49:52] flesh to mortify the Deeds of the body
[49:54] to put it under subjection so that the
[49:57] spirit of God can have the preeminence
[49:59] in our lives
[50:01] it's just not automatically going to
[50:04] happen there's a a lot of devils that
[50:06] want to distract us
[50:09] a lot of devils
[50:11] can we turn to Ezekiel chapter 3 verse
[50:15] chapter 3 and I want to start with verse
[50:17] number 16. I want to read some
[50:19] scriptures that I I believe should help
[50:23] encourage us I think all the scriptures
[50:25] should should help us encourage us they
[50:28] they're never meant to discourage us
[50:31] right right
[50:33] no
[50:36] these scriptures talk about our POS our
[50:39] position
[50:41] our relationship with God it's too often
[50:46] we get the the mindset that
[50:50] um because I've entered into the gate
[50:53] everything is okay because I've done
[50:54] these Works everything's okay and we
[50:57] can't we can't think like that we've got
[51:00] to think about an ongoing relationship
[51:03] an ongoing relationship Ezekiel chapter
[51:06] 3 verse 16 says and it came to pass at
[51:09] the end of seven days that the word of
[51:10] the Lord came unto me saying son to man
[51:12] I have made thee a Watchman over the
[51:14] house of Israel now I want you to put
[51:16] yourself in the position as a Watchman
[51:20] you are a Watchman you are a a servant
[51:23] of God uh someone that God uses to watch
[51:28] over somebody
[51:32] it's the truth
[51:33] you have a family you have a home you
[51:36] have a neighbor you have somebody you
[51:38] work with
[51:39] it this isn't just
[51:42] for for ministers that's correct
[51:44] therefore hear the word at my mouth and
[51:47] give them warning from me
[51:51] notice where the warning's coming from
[51:53] when I say unto the wicked thou shall
[51:55] surely die
[51:57] thou and thou givest him not warning
[52:01] nor speakeas to warn the wicked from his
[52:04] Wicked Ways to save his life
[52:08] the same Wicked man shall die in his
[52:12] iniquity
[52:14] in his I don't care to do the will of
[52:18] God when I know
[52:20] but his blood what I require at thine
[52:23] hand that's why it's important to tell
[52:26] people the truth
[52:28] yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn
[52:31] not from his wickedness nor from his
[52:34] Wicked way he shall die in his iniquity
[52:37] but thou has delivered thy Soul now now
[52:40] think about this
[52:42] I thought my soul was saved when I
[52:45] repented
[52:46] and I got baptized why do I need to keep
[52:49] saving my soul because if God tells you
[52:52] to do something if you don't do it your
[52:55] soul is required
[52:58] this is why we just can't hide behind
[53:00] something that we've done we've got to
[53:02] be thinking or being sensitive to what
[53:04] he's telling us today
[53:10] again when a righteous man doth turn
[53:13] from his righteousness and commit
[53:16] commit iniquity commit yeah
[53:21] I know I but it's not that big a deal
[53:24] and lay and I lay a summoning pot before
[53:27] him he shall die
[53:30] because thou has not given him warning
[53:35] he shall die in his sin and the
[53:37] righteousness which he have done shall
[53:40] not be
[53:42] remembered
[53:43] but his blood will I require at thine
[53:46] hand so you know for the Lord to tell
[53:49] you that you need to say something to
[53:51] somebody this is serious business
[53:54] this is really serious
[53:57] we are our Brother's Keeper
[54:00] we have to be concerned about one
[54:02] another
[54:05] nevertheless if thou warn the righteous
[54:07] man that the righteous sin not
[54:11] any
[54:12] and he doth not sin he shall surely live
[54:15] because he is warned also thou is
[54:18] delivered thy soul
[54:22] so the righteous man can sin and and
[54:25] fall off
[54:27] I mean the gates of hell are around us
[54:30] I mean think about the people who we
[54:32] thought would never go away
[54:34] look what's happened
[54:36] I thought certain people they would just
[54:38] be here day in day out service after
[54:41] service what happened
[54:43] I mean we were three more agents and at
[54:46] any time if we're not careful we could
[54:48] listen to the wrong spirits
[54:51] Ezekiel 18 verse 3.
[54:54] as I live saith the Lord God as I live
[54:58] saith the Lord God verse 4 behold All
[55:00] Souls are mine
[55:02] as the soul of the father so also the
[55:05] soul of the son is mine the soul that
[55:07] sinneth it shall die so God created the
[55:11] soul the soul belongs to him and he
[55:13] places in a body gives us opportunity to
[55:15] do what we want to do with it and by the
[55:18] grace of God he's using us today to help
[55:21] Souls get saved
[55:23] praise the Lord
[55:24] [Music]
[55:26] verse 20 the soul that sinneth it shall
[55:29] die the son shall not bear the iniquity
[55:33] of the father notice this neither shall
[55:36] the father bear the iniquity of the son
[55:40] the righteousness of the righteous shall
[55:43] be upon him and the wickedness of the
[55:46] wicked shall be upon him
[55:51] but if the wicked will turn from all his
[55:54] sins that he have committed and keep all
[55:57] my statutes and do that which is lawful
[56:00] and right he shall surely live he shall
[56:03] not die
[56:06] so it's about your end result where the
[56:09] how the tree falls that's the way it
[56:11] lies so you know when we go to bed at
[56:13] night the Bible says don't let the the
[56:16] sun go down upon your wrath don't lay in
[56:18] that situation make sure you make surety
[56:22] of your friends and and and and and and
[56:24] keep the relationship fresh with God
[56:29] amen verse 24 but when the righteous
[56:32] turneth away from his righteousness
[56:35] so we can be righteous and turn away
[56:37] from our righteous and committed
[56:39] iniquity
[56:42] and do it according to all the
[56:43] Abominations that the Wicked Man do it
[56:45] shall he live
[56:47] question mark all his righteousness now
[56:50] that's why I want to get through all his
[56:51] righteousness that he have done shall
[56:54] not be mentioned
[56:57] how many times people rely on the things
[57:01] that they have done to set the
[57:03] Precedence of who they are
[57:06] and they bypass
[57:08] the attitude and spirit that they're
[57:11] walking with
[57:12] is that they're using these things as
[57:14] like credentials
[57:16] and and
[57:18] what God is interested in is is how
[57:22] we're living today
[57:24] do we have an i and I don't care
[57:26] attitude or or or are we very interested
[57:30] in every word of God that he wants us to
[57:32] do
[57:34] in his trespasses they have trespassed
[57:36] and in his sin that he have sinned in
[57:38] them shall we die yet ye say the way of
[57:41] the Lord is not equal hear now o House
[57:43] of Israel is not my way equal are not my
[57:46] your ways unequal
[57:48] so you can call God bad but he's calling
[57:51] you bad when a righteous man turneth
[57:54] away from his righteousness and commit
[57:56] iniquity and dieth in them for his
[57:58] iniquity that he have done shall he die
[58:01] for his iniquity that he have done shall
[58:03] he die again when the Wicked Man turneth
[58:06] away from his wickedness that he have
[58:09] committed and doeth that which is lawful
[58:11] right he shall save his soul alive I say
[58:16] if there's breath inside of a human
[58:19] being there is a chance for salvation
[58:23] we can't look at
[58:25] we can't look at things in judge you
[58:28] know a lot of times we judge people
[58:31] we just well look what they're at look
[58:33] what they're doing
[58:35] and we judge them and you we can never
[58:37] do that
[58:39] God has called us to help people just
[58:43] help people God is the one that
[58:46] has got to convict the heart and and
[58:49] soften the heart and make somebody get
[58:52] their heart right with God
[58:55] all right that was verse 27 28 because
[58:58] he considereth and turneth away from all
[59:00] his transgressions that he have
[59:02] committed he shall surely live he shall
[59:05] not die see so God is looking at the
[59:09] Turning Away
[59:11] not the past
[59:13] not the past I was talking to someone
[59:15] today at our shop and I just said you
[59:19] know the past has nothing to do with
[59:21] right now the past does not judge our
[59:24] future it shouldn't even judge our
[59:27] present
[59:30] it's our past
[59:33] verse 29 yet
[59:35] saith the house of Israel the way of the
[59:38] Lord is not equal all House of Israel
[59:40] are not my ways equal are not your ways
[59:44] unequal so say I went like uh
[59:48] 62 years
[59:50] and I just want to serve the Lord the
[59:52] best I can in 62 years and three months
[59:56] I decide you know what I just I'm so
[1:00:00] sick of this I want to do my own thing
[1:00:03] and I die at 64.
[1:00:06] now God is
[1:00:09] Fair
[1:00:10] is is he going to say oh oh 62 years two
[1:00:14] years oh yeah he's in
[1:00:19] it this does not matter
[1:00:21] if I do this
[1:00:25] it's very important how we are today
[1:00:30] it's very important our attitude when we
[1:00:32] come into the house of God when we leave
[1:00:35] how we are when we wake up how we are
[1:00:37] when we go to bed this is what God is
[1:00:40] looking at
[1:00:44] therefore I judge your house of Israel
[1:00:46] everyone according to his way saith the
[1:00:48] Lord God repent and turn yourself from
[1:00:50] all your transgressions so your iniquity
[1:00:52] shall not shall not be your ruin cast
[1:00:55] away from all your transgressions
[1:00:57] whereby you have transgress and make you
[1:00:59] a new heart and a new spirit for why
[1:01:02] will you dial House of Israel for I have
[1:01:04] no pleasure in the death of him that
[1:01:06] died saith the Lord God wherefore turn
[1:01:09] yourselves and live ye
[1:01:12] praise God so if we could just in keep
[1:01:15] encouraging people to turn to turn to
[1:01:18] turn just keep turning turn towards the
[1:01:20] Lord
[1:01:21] in that if you just save one Soul think
[1:01:26] about it the worth of that soul is worth
[1:01:28] ten thousand worlds you cover a
[1:01:31] multitude of sin by just helping that
[1:01:34] one person turn towards the Lord the
[1:01:37] past does not mean a thing
[1:01:42] we just got to get away
[1:01:44] from the idea
[1:01:48] that are good deeds in our works
[1:01:50] the things that we have done
[1:01:53] they stand up as a president
[1:01:56] as credentials
[1:01:59] to
[1:02:01] allow us freedom and liberty to kind of
[1:02:05] do what we want to do
[1:02:09] God's way is living for God every day
[1:02:13] not claiming God every day but living
[1:02:16] for God every day
[1:02:18] you can claim God all day every day and
[1:02:22] live for yourself
[1:02:24] brother Brandon I've read this quote
[1:02:26] many times and I hope it's okay because
[1:02:28] to be honest with you if you're getting
[1:02:31] sick of this quote just pray for me that
[1:02:33] I live this quote
[1:02:36] that's just how I feel about it
[1:02:39] brother Brandon spoke this in a man
[1:02:41] running from the presence of the Lord he
[1:02:43] said how wishy-washy that's what too
[1:02:46] many Christians
[1:02:48] uh too many Christians today are so soft
[1:02:52] and soaked and everything until they
[1:02:54] think all they have to do is just join a
[1:02:56] church or go somewhere and put their
[1:02:57] name in the book do a little something
[1:02:59] jump up and down about shout say
[1:03:02] something like that and call it
[1:03:04] Christianity
[1:03:07] that's called Christianity
[1:03:10] but Christianity definition
[1:03:14] this is a brother Branham dictionary I
[1:03:17] believe it's coming from Heaven don't
[1:03:19] you
[1:03:20] Christianity is an everyday
[1:03:22] rugged life living for God in this
[1:03:27] present world
[1:03:31] you're not living for yourself you're
[1:03:33] living for God
[1:03:35] and he he goes in and describes what's
[1:03:37] happening on the inside
[1:03:39] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[1:03:43] the love of God in the heart and it sets
[1:03:46] you a fire and it puts you out yonder
[1:03:49] with people making converts
[1:03:54] how many converts
[1:03:56] have we been making
[1:03:59] he says
[1:04:00] converts to Christ and then he says this
[1:04:03] word responsibilities that's a
[1:04:05] responsibility being a Christian is a
[1:04:07] responsibility
[1:04:08] and brother Brian I'm saying there's too
[1:04:11] many people who who want to claim
[1:04:13] Christianity without responsibility
[1:04:17] he said but it's easy to go the way the
[1:04:20] world goes it's easy to flow down the
[1:04:22] streams go out there and sit down and in
[1:04:25] the river with your boat
[1:04:27] you get the your oars and start pulling
[1:04:29] up against the current you don't make
[1:04:31] much time and it goes hard
[1:04:34] but you just want once let loose to
[1:04:36] those oars and watch how fast the trees
[1:04:38] uh you pass the trees going down and
[1:04:42] look where you're going
[1:04:44] when things are just floating easy
[1:04:46] remember you're going towards a great
[1:04:49] cataract down there of some sort
[1:04:52] you're going towards the falls and it
[1:04:55] won't be long you'll be going over the
[1:04:57] falls just floating with the world easy
[1:04:59] the way it goes he says you don't want
[1:05:02] to do that no sir but you must accept
[1:05:06] your responsibilities so this is the
[1:05:09] thing that we are tempted the Gates of
[1:05:11] Hell attempt us
[1:05:13] with the easy path
[1:05:15] we're just taking it easy
[1:05:18] and God's saying we got a responsibility
[1:05:22] and and that responsibility isn't just
[1:05:25] one this this and make sure you got
[1:05:27] these four things checked off because at
[1:05:29] any given time at any given day God
[1:05:31] could be giving you more
[1:05:32] responsibilities
[1:05:34] what is he what is he really saying to
[1:05:37] us if we're supposed to be making
[1:05:39] Converse what are we doing to make
[1:05:41] converts
[1:05:43] and how often do I need to do that is
[1:05:45] that like a kind of a once a month kind
[1:05:48] of tradition a once a year only when God
[1:05:52] brings somebody in front of us I mean I
[1:05:55] mean we could go a long different ways
[1:05:57] here but the thing I'm trying to to get
[1:06:00] to is that this is the way of Christ
[1:06:03] and and the the gates of hell are broad
[1:06:07] they're easy they're just you know have
[1:06:11] any excuse you want to do anything you
[1:06:13] want
[1:06:14] and God is calling us away from that to
[1:06:18] be aware
[1:06:19] of it
[1:06:25] we just got to get away from thinking
[1:06:27] that good things
[1:06:29] put us in the Kingdom or in favor with
[1:06:31] God
[1:06:33] Matthew chapter 7. I want to start here
[1:06:37] with verse number 18 Matthew chapter 7
[1:06:40] verses 15 to 20 discusses God's way is
[1:06:45] not a mixed fruit
[1:06:47] God's way that straight nearby it's not
[1:06:50] a mixed fruit
[1:06:52] he says in verse 18 a good tree
[1:06:56] cannot bring forth evil fruit
[1:07:00] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[1:07:02] good fruit
[1:07:04] so no we are all mixed creatures right
[1:07:07] we all make mistakes every day and and
[1:07:10] sometimes people can look at us and they
[1:07:13] couldn't tell us
[1:07:14] from a sinner
[1:07:17] we couldn't tell us a difference from a
[1:07:19] sinner
[1:07:20] because we have acted wrong we've we've
[1:07:23] we've handled a situation wrong we we've
[1:07:26] uh brother Brandon says it's not the
[1:07:28] action but the reaction that really
[1:07:29] counts and and and we've all come short
[1:07:32] of the glory of God
[1:07:34] and that's not what I'm referring to
[1:07:36] what I'm referring to is on a day in day
[1:07:38] out basis our fruit should be the same
[1:07:45] our fruit should be the same
[1:07:48] and he said in verse 20 wherefore by
[1:07:51] their fruits you shall know them
[1:07:54] it's the fruits
[1:07:57] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[1:07:59] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:08:00] heaven
[1:08:02] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:08:04] which is in heaven makes it real real
[1:08:06] clear that one gate you don't have to do
[1:08:10] the will of God
[1:08:12] and the other gate you have to
[1:08:17] remember and and and and the thing that
[1:08:19] I'm concerned about is not the 18
[1:08:22] scriptures that I know in the Bible
[1:08:25] right right
[1:08:27] I'm concerned about all the things that
[1:08:29] God's thinking about me
[1:08:31] what is he expecting of me
[1:08:38] the fruit of God is looking for our
[1:08:40] lives to do all of his will
[1:08:43] verse 22 many will say to me in that day
[1:08:45] Lord Lord
[1:08:46] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[1:08:49] in thy name have cussed out devils and
[1:08:51] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:08:55] and then will I profess unto them I
[1:08:58] never knew you
[1:09:00] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:09:05] so these believers who profess to belong
[1:09:08] to Christ they never departed from
[1:09:11] iniquity
[1:09:13] they they never departed from knowing to
[1:09:18] do something about God's will
[1:09:22] and not doing it they never got away
[1:09:24] from that they held why they why they
[1:09:28] did these words for they prophesied boy
[1:09:29] they cast out Devils why they exercised
[1:09:32] why they use the name of Christ why they
[1:09:34] Proclaim Christianity they were still a
[1:09:37] part of them
[1:09:38] that knew other things that they should
[1:09:41] be doing
[1:09:43] and declined to do them
[1:09:48] this is
[1:09:50] this is part of the Gospel
[1:09:52] this is part of the gospel and and I it
[1:09:56] would be nice to come to church
[1:09:59] and to have the preacher just say well
[1:10:01] you need to be doing this and you need
[1:10:02] to be doing that you need to and then be
[1:10:04] okay now I know what I need to do and go
[1:10:06] do it but you know God wants us to ask
[1:10:08] him Lord show me what I'm missing
[1:10:11] show me what I need to be doing because
[1:10:14] the time that I literally turned it down
[1:10:16] I didn't want to do it
[1:10:18] and I just got involved in my own will
[1:10:22] but brother Brandon says if you want to
[1:10:23] find out where God's at he's right where
[1:10:25] you left him
[1:10:26] and if he told you to do something he
[1:10:28] wants you to go back there and I don't
[1:10:30] care if it's one one week one month or
[1:10:33] 20 years he'll meet you right back at
[1:10:36] that spot because his word is eternal
[1:10:43] we read this last service
[1:10:46] second Timothy chapter 2 verse 19.
[1:10:49] nevertheless the foundation of God stand
[1:10:52] Asher having this seal the Lord knoweth
[1:10:56] them that are his and let everyone that
[1:10:59] nameth the name of Christ move away get
[1:11:02] away from iniquity
[1:11:06] so these these people that cast out
[1:11:08] devils and did all these wonderful
[1:11:10] things they never had the seal
[1:11:14] they never had the seal
[1:11:17] because the Bible says uh the foundation
[1:11:20] of God stand is sure having this seal
[1:11:23] the seal is you will depart from
[1:11:26] iniquity you you have to the Holy Ghost
[1:11:29] will
[1:11:30] it will let you stay in that condition
[1:11:34] it will get every bit out of us
[1:11:37] I'm not afraid that we know
[1:11:41] one another's iniquity
[1:11:44] because we got it
[1:11:46] when I'm afraid of is us getting
[1:11:47] comfortable with it
[1:11:50] that's what I'm afraid of
[1:11:54] because if we make excuses for we won't
[1:11:57] depart
[1:11:59] we've made it a reason to allow it
[1:12:03] and God is calling us to move away and
[1:12:06] it's different for you than for me it's
[1:12:08] different for me than you
[1:12:10] but it's a realness and the the gates of
[1:12:13] how are constantly there trying to get
[1:12:16] us to do our will
[1:12:18] that's what those gates are there
[1:12:20] they're all about us so we don't even
[1:12:22] realize that how close the devil gets to
[1:12:24] us
[1:12:25] the devil gets so close to us he could
[1:12:27] literally use me
[1:12:31] right
[1:12:33] yeah have did you ever hear anybody say
[1:12:35] that's just a devil talking out of you
[1:12:39] well what what did Jesus say to Peter
[1:12:42] get behind me Satan
[1:12:45] anyway
[1:12:46] we're just going against the will of God
[1:12:50] it's always doing is going against the
[1:12:52] will of God it was a horrible thing
[1:12:55] caught him
[1:12:56] to to devil to come out of Peter to to
[1:13:00] to get behind him and stop stop filling
[1:13:02] his mind with that because thou Savers
[1:13:05] the things that belongeth to man
[1:13:07] and not to God
[1:13:15] as we strive to walk in God's way
[1:13:18] he's continually showing us
[1:13:21] because the Bible says when he the
[1:13:23] spirit of truth will come he will lead
[1:13:25] and guide you into all truth now as he's
[1:13:28] showing us
[1:13:29] it's it's real easy I mean
[1:13:32] um
[1:13:36] you're going to go to a wedding they're
[1:13:39] going to open the door for you and
[1:13:41] they're going to just say you just come
[1:13:42] sit right here and you feel oh I get to
[1:13:45] sit here and you feel real good
[1:13:48] you think boy if the Lord it just shows
[1:13:50] me like that the way of truth that's
[1:13:53] just that's comfortable I can handle
[1:13:55] that but if he tells me you got to give
[1:13:57] up this you're going to suffer this
[1:14:00] you're going to be persecuted for this
[1:14:02] you've got to lay it on your life for
[1:14:03] this person you got to pray for this
[1:14:06] person you've got to give up time and
[1:14:08] you well all of a sudden
[1:14:10] this note is appealing and is enjoyable
[1:14:13] as the other way
[1:14:16] and so as we're thinking God's showing
[1:14:19] us his way it's not pampered with
[1:14:21] enjoyment
[1:14:23] I mean when God took brother by Adam's
[1:14:26] wife away and his daughter
[1:14:29] I believe God was showing brother
[1:14:31] Brandon something
[1:14:33] that God's will is preeminent it needs
[1:14:37] to be preeminent in our lives
[1:14:40] and I'll tell you
[1:14:42] I mean there's a lot of people that
[1:14:44] wanted to be a prophet and have that
[1:14:46] discernment and I'll tell you the things
[1:14:49] he had to go through I would have lost
[1:14:51] all my family I would lost everything I
[1:14:53] had
[1:14:54] you understand
[1:14:56] and it's it's the grace of God that
[1:14:58] we're here today but we must take this
[1:15:00] seriously that God is trying to teach us
[1:15:04] continuously
[1:15:06] not to of course our flesh is always
[1:15:09] wanting to be satisfied with where we're
[1:15:11] at to feel like we've attained and and
[1:15:14] and but we need to have that attitude
[1:15:16] that Paul had I haven't attained I'm
[1:15:19] pressing towards where Christ wants me
[1:15:21] to be it just needs to be there on a
[1:15:23] regular basis
[1:15:25] Isaiah 55 verse 6.
[1:15:29] we have to put everything we have into
[1:15:31] it
[1:15:32] to find the will of God now I'm not
[1:15:35] speaking about the will of God whether
[1:15:37] he should lead you to buy this car or
[1:15:40] that car or this house or that house or
[1:15:44] things like that but I'm talking about
[1:15:47] the leadership of the Lord for what he
[1:15:50] wants you to do today it's something we
[1:15:53] don't think about often we get up in the
[1:15:56] day and we go about our day I'm going to
[1:15:58] work I'm doing this and and really God
[1:16:01] has a will for us
[1:16:03] and it's just important to call on God
[1:16:05] and say God what would you have me to do
[1:16:08] amen all right Isaiah 55 verse 6 seek ye
[1:16:10] the Lord while he may be found call upon
[1:16:13] him while he is near
[1:16:16] don't you wish sometimes when you went
[1:16:17] to pray you could just feel his presence
[1:16:22] let the wicked forsake his way
[1:16:25] let the unrighteous man his thoughts
[1:16:29] and let him return unto the Lord
[1:16:33] and he will have mercy upon him to our
[1:16:35] and to our God for he will abundantly
[1:16:37] pray what a promise
[1:16:39] I'm okay
[1:16:41] with
[1:16:42] uh
[1:16:43] viewing myself is wicked
[1:16:46] is unrighteous as of needing Mercy
[1:16:52] is needing Grace I'm okay with that
[1:16:55] because it's so dangerous
[1:16:58] to be to just only claiming myself as
[1:17:01] I'm a righteous Son of God I'm okay with
[1:17:04] that when the devil is trying to attack
[1:17:06] me
[1:17:07] but the Lord wants me to remain humble
[1:17:11] because he gives more grace to the
[1:17:13] humble not the proud not the arrogant
[1:17:16] remember
[1:17:17] he says for my thoughts are not your
[1:17:20] thoughts
[1:17:21] neither are your ways my ways
[1:17:25] so he's already making it clear that the
[1:17:27] way that a natural man is the broad way
[1:17:34] for as the heaven is higher than the
[1:17:35] earth or my ways higher than your ways
[1:17:38] and my thoughts are
[1:17:40] then then your thoughts and you just the
[1:17:43] examples remember when Naaman he wanted
[1:17:47] to go wash in the The Cleaner rivers and
[1:17:52] didn't didn't want to go washing dirty
[1:17:54] his own understanding he was leaning on
[1:17:57] because he just couldn't understand why
[1:17:59] God would make him lower himself to go
[1:18:02] wash in some dirty water
[1:18:04] or why God would use us to lower
[1:18:07] ourselves to go help somebody who's in
[1:18:09] in a dirty situation
[1:18:12] but it's God's way
[1:18:15] it's God's way
[1:18:20] Psalms 16 verse 11 says Thou will show
[1:18:24] me the path of life
[1:18:27] amen there's a way that seemeth right
[1:18:30] unto man right but it's the end of death
[1:18:32] but the Holy Ghost will leading against
[1:18:35] all truth thou will show me the path of
[1:18:39] life
[1:18:41] and in thy presence
[1:18:43] is fullness of joy
[1:18:46] how many wants Joy the remedy's right
[1:18:49] there
[1:18:50] just create an atmosphere where his
[1:18:53] presence just comes
[1:18:55] hard to have God around you without the
[1:18:57] joy of the Lord amen at thy right hand
[1:19:00] there are Pleasures forever more amen
[1:19:04] back to Matthew chapter 7 verse 24.
[1:19:12] we want to build our life every day on
[1:19:16] the rock
[1:19:17] amen therefore whosoever heareth the
[1:19:20] sayings of mine and do with them I will
[1:19:23] liken unto him liking unto I will liken
[1:19:27] him unto a wise man which built his
[1:19:31] house upon a rock so you don't got to be
[1:19:34] a brain surgeon
[1:19:36] you don't gotta know how to do a lot of
[1:19:39] things
[1:19:40] all you have to do is have a heart
[1:19:44] to want to do what you hear
[1:19:47] at church
[1:19:50] when you put a tape on when you read
[1:19:53] your Bible
[1:19:54] when you get down on your knees to pray
[1:19:56] have a heart to do those things and you
[1:20:00] will be wise
[1:20:02] you will be wise
[1:20:05] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:20:08] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:20:10] the house and it fell not for it was
[1:20:11] founded upon Iraq of course it was Jesus
[1:20:15] Christ it was the word of God
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:18] and everyone that heareth these Saints
[1:20:21] of mine
[1:20:23] and doeth them not again talking about
[1:20:26] this iniquity
[1:20:28] shall be likened unto a foolish man
[1:20:31] which built his house upon the sand
[1:20:35] in other words he was able to build it
[1:20:39] it was strong enough to build a life
[1:20:43] remember the foolish virgin
[1:20:45] they had some oil
[1:20:49] but it went out
[1:20:53] they didn't build their house upon the
[1:20:57] rock because that rock said you got to
[1:21:00] get the seal
[1:21:03] and the rain just said and the floods
[1:21:05] came the winds blew and beat upon the
[1:21:07] house and it fell and great was the fall
[1:21:10] of it
[1:21:15] so I don't care how much God has ever
[1:21:17] used me I don't mean that in a
[1:21:20] disrespectful way to God I don't mean it
[1:21:22] that it doesn't mean anything about my
[1:21:24] future
[1:21:27] what's important to me is can I can I go
[1:21:30] back to the last time God spoke to me
[1:21:32] and can I see myself doing it
[1:21:34] that's what I want to look like that's
[1:21:36] what's important because that's what
[1:21:38] that's what my life is being built on
[1:21:42] and if you can see that I say praise God
[1:21:45] but if you can't see that we need to be
[1:21:48] paying attention to the things that God
[1:21:50] is saying and you need to see yourself
[1:21:52] you need to Envision yourself doing what
[1:21:54] he told you to do
[1:21:57] no matter if it's just between you and
[1:22:00] God or it involves somebody else it's
[1:22:02] important God wouldn't have said it to
[1:22:05] you if it wasn't
[1:22:07] brother Branham said in the message from
[1:22:09] that time he says oh you got good
[1:22:12] intentions certainly hell is paid with
[1:22:14] with good intentions you don't think
[1:22:17] that
[1:22:18] you think that that's the way to do it
[1:22:21] he says you're just presuming that
[1:22:23] you're in the way that you should do it
[1:22:26] so presuming
[1:22:29] presuming didn't David say keep back
[1:22:31] your servant from presumptuous sin just
[1:22:34] assuming that what I'm doing it's going
[1:22:36] to be okay my intention this was my
[1:22:40] intention I I feel that that has a place
[1:22:45] but we can't just keep doing that
[1:22:47] you know take time to pray
[1:22:50] take time to seek God to be this to be
[1:22:54] serious about it because
[1:22:56] a lot of people can be sincere and have
[1:22:58] good intentions but they're sincerely
[1:23:00] wrong
[1:23:02] now our flesh is an enemy of God every
[1:23:05] one of us God hates our flesh God does
[1:23:08] not love your flesh more than mine
[1:23:12] you don't even love your flesh
[1:23:14] now one ounce of it
[1:23:17] I would say that the gates of hell are
[1:23:20] continually after us and they're they
[1:23:23] they they do things to appeal to our
[1:23:26] flesh
[1:23:28] they try to entice us into thinking the
[1:23:32] way
[1:23:33] that the world thinks and since we were
[1:23:36] brought up that way to do what we want
[1:23:38] to do we're very uh
[1:23:42] it's easy for us to get sick sucked into
[1:23:44] that
[1:23:46] and and and so we not we must remember
[1:23:49] that no matter how spiritual or how long
[1:23:52] that we've been saved or or how close we
[1:23:56] think we are at God our flesh is still
[1:23:58] our flesh and it will always be an enemy
[1:24:00] of God and we must make sure that we're
[1:24:03] we're in tune spiritually to the Lord
[1:24:06] Romans 8 verse 6 is for to be carnally
[1:24:09] minded is death
[1:24:12] but to be spiritually minded that's life
[1:24:15] and peace so in other words if this is
[1:24:17] what God said we need to do this needs
[1:24:19] to be important we need to be doing this
[1:24:20] we need to be making a plan for this we
[1:24:22] need to put this in our home we need to
[1:24:24] put this in our life we need to get
[1:24:25] serious we need to get this in our
[1:24:27] church we need to be we need to be
[1:24:29] praying we need to be saving Souls if I
[1:24:32] need to be doing this daily this is what
[1:24:33] I should be doing
[1:24:35] that's what God wants to see
[1:24:40] because the carnal mind is enmity it's
[1:24:43] against God it is not subject to the law
[1:24:46] of God now here's the catcher neither
[1:24:49] indeed can be that's right well no
[1:24:52] matter what you try to do in a carnal
[1:24:54] State you're always going to be in
[1:24:56] opposite sides with God
[1:24:58] if you do not take your time to crucify
[1:25:01] your flesh and get into the spirit you
[1:25:03] will never be able to make God happy
[1:25:05] you'll never please him you'll never get
[1:25:08] on the same wavelength with them
[1:25:10] God he just hates our flesh
[1:25:16] it gets us in trouble
[1:25:18] the Broadway it's a worldly way of
[1:25:22] thinking it's worldly wisdom worldly
[1:25:25] understanding worldly knowledge it's
[1:25:27] just worldly
[1:25:30] now God's way is it's higher his his
[1:25:34] wisdom is from above it's first peaceful
[1:25:36] and gentle easy to be entreated without
[1:25:39] partiality without respect to persons
[1:25:42] and and you you you sow peace
[1:25:45] it's just two different wisdoms two
[1:25:48] different knowledges
[1:25:50] I'll give you a little example
[1:25:54] Proverbs 23 verse 12 says apply thy
[1:25:57] heart unto instruction
[1:25:59] in thy ears in thy ears to the words of
[1:26:03] knowledge
[1:26:04] withhold not correction from the child
[1:26:07] for if thou bedest him with the rod he
[1:26:11] shall not die how many times have I I
[1:26:14] happened seven seven kids I have asked
[1:26:16] the question many times is this
[1:26:19] too much am I going too far
[1:26:25] and
[1:26:26] I'm so glad God does not stop correcting
[1:26:30] me
[1:26:32] no matter how bad I am no matter what
[1:26:35] I've done
[1:26:36] because he's he's going to save my soul
[1:26:40] and we need to think about that with our
[1:26:43] children
[1:26:44] thou shall beat him with the rod
[1:26:47] and thou and shall deliver his soul from
[1:26:52] hell so here you are you're beating his
[1:26:54] flesh
[1:26:56] to save his soul
[1:26:58] from hell
[1:27:00] wow there's a connection
[1:27:03] there's a connection
[1:27:06] and he also warns us of worldly wisdom
[1:27:09] and if you read Proverbs we learn about
[1:27:12] the wisdom of Solomon
[1:27:15] and it also talks about the wisdom of
[1:27:18] the world in contrast with one another
[1:27:21] in Proverbs 7 verse 27 if I could say it
[1:27:24] like this worldly wisdom and
[1:27:27] understanding is the way to hell
[1:27:30] going down to the chambers of death and
[1:27:33] that's what worldly wisdom and worldly
[1:27:36] understanding will do
[1:27:38] Proverbs 15 verse 24 the way of life is
[1:27:41] above to the wise
[1:27:44] that he may depart
[1:27:47] from Hell beneath
[1:27:49] from these Gates of Hell amen
[1:27:52] when I think about if you want to turn
[1:27:54] to Jonah chapter 2 when I think about uh
[1:27:58] Jonah the gates of hell was after Jonah
[1:28:02] absolutely the demons got Jonah to enter
[1:28:06] into iniquity
[1:28:10] the place of knowing to do good and not
[1:28:13] doing it he entered the place of I don't
[1:28:15] care when God told him you need to go to
[1:28:18] Nineveh you need to preach the gospel
[1:28:22] well his attitude was I don't want to
[1:28:27] so he knew to do good and was doing it
[1:28:31] not he kind of went off in his way I'm
[1:28:33] just going to kind of do my thing and
[1:28:35] nobody's going to know about it
[1:28:38] people on the ship didn't know about it
[1:28:41] but God knew about it
[1:28:44] God knew about it
[1:28:48] Jonah
[1:28:49] chapter 2 verse 1. then Jonah prayed
[1:28:52] unto the Lord is God out of the
[1:28:55] fish's belly
[1:28:56] and said I cried by reason of my
[1:28:58] inflation unto the Lord and he heard me
[1:29:00] and out of the valley of Hell the belly
[1:29:04] of Hell cried I
[1:29:07] that's how how how much it was it let
[1:29:11] his this broad way this broad way of
[1:29:14] thinking his his own Brewery wisdom if I
[1:29:16] just don't go then you know Nineveh you
[1:29:19] know they're just gonna perish because
[1:29:20] God will have to kill him foreign
[1:29:26] leads to hell this idea of doing your
[1:29:29] own thing leads to hell
[1:29:32] but he said
[1:29:33] I cried cried I and thou heard us my
[1:29:36] voice
[1:29:37] for thou has cast me into the deep in
[1:29:39] the midst of the Sea and the floods come
[1:29:41] past me about all the Billows and the
[1:29:43] waves they passed me over then I said I
[1:29:47] am cast out of thy sight think about
[1:29:51] this he went his way away from God away
[1:29:56] from God's will
[1:29:58] he got to a place where he realized that
[1:30:02] he was separated from God
[1:30:06] and he said yet I will look again toward
[1:30:10] the Holy Temple he realized
[1:30:15] he realized that he had to turn towards
[1:30:17] God he had to repent the Bible's we read
[1:30:20] it the the wicked man turned from his
[1:30:22] Wicked Ways and and do the will of God
[1:30:24] that God would hear
[1:30:26] it was about relationship it's about
[1:30:28] where we're at today
[1:30:31] the waters come past me about even to
[1:30:34] the soul so not just the body but the
[1:30:37] soul
[1:30:38] The Depths closed me around about the
[1:30:40] weeds wrapped around my head I went down
[1:30:42] to the bottoms of the mountain the Earth
[1:30:44] and her bars was about me forever
[1:30:47] yet has thou brought up my life from
[1:30:50] corruption oh Lord my God
[1:30:53] when my soul fainted within me I
[1:30:55] remembered the Lord that's what we got
[1:30:57] to do we got to remember the Lord not
[1:31:01] anything else just remember the Lord and
[1:31:04] my prayer came in unto thee into thy
[1:31:06] Holy Temple they that observed lion
[1:31:09] vanities they forsake their own mercies
[1:31:10] that we got to get our mind on the Lord
[1:31:15] the Lord has mercies new every day for
[1:31:18] us amen but I will sacrifice unto thee
[1:31:20] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[1:31:22] pay that that I have vowed
[1:31:25] we've all vowed I will live for you Lord
[1:31:28] I will serve you
[1:31:30] that's a vow that he expects us to keep
[1:31:36] the gates of hell are trying to keep us
[1:31:39] from doing that and the Lord's spake
[1:31:42] unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah
[1:31:44] upon dry land
[1:31:48] the Gates of Hell shook Jonah but I want
[1:31:52] you to catch this
[1:31:54] it never prevailed
[1:31:56] because Jonah already had the word
[1:32:00] inside of them
[1:32:04] the bride
[1:32:06] already has the word of God inside of
[1:32:09] her
[1:32:10] she can get shook up she can get shaken
[1:32:14] but it can't prevail
[1:32:16] because she has the word and it's the
[1:32:19] only thing that the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:32:21] come against
[1:32:23] so we see that Jonah went through this
[1:32:25] God's Prophet it was a terrible thing
[1:32:27] surely
[1:32:29] but the word was still in him he just
[1:32:32] God had to get him to the place that he
[1:32:34] could realize that
[1:32:36] there's this is death going this way
[1:32:39] you know when he said I'm just not going
[1:32:41] to go to an interview I'm going to go
[1:32:42] over here I'm going to go do this he
[1:32:43] wasn't realizing that there was death
[1:32:45] waiting him
[1:32:47] he was just thinking he was getting out
[1:32:48] of his responsibility
[1:32:52] but God had to show him no it's not
[1:32:55] going to go the way you think this way
[1:32:57] that you're thinking if you keep going
[1:32:58] it's death
[1:33:00] and it's I remember the Lord I do I
[1:33:03] don't want to be away from him
[1:33:06] and I know that he has Mercy for me
[1:33:10] and that's that's how we've got to be
[1:33:12] every day
[1:33:14] just just turn to the Lord with a soft
[1:33:17] heart and serve him amen
[1:33:21] and this message called in his presence
[1:33:23] and brother Brown was just starting out
[1:33:25] and he was reading Isaiah chapter 6 when
[1:33:28] Isaiah went in into the temple there and
[1:33:31] he got into the presence of the Lord and
[1:33:33] he saw the angels and it was just all a
[1:33:36] holy holy situation and
[1:33:40] uh brother Branham I'm just going to
[1:33:42] pick up right here and just quoting and
[1:33:44] he laid he laid it upon my mouth talking
[1:33:47] about the the coals off the fire and
[1:33:50] Lowell this hath touched thy lips and
[1:33:53] thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[1:33:58] is purged now before he went into there
[1:34:01] I don't believe that he thought that he
[1:34:05] had iniquity
[1:34:07] in sin
[1:34:09] because remember when he first this
[1:34:11] first happened he said well unto me
[1:34:15] boom I'm a man of unclean lips but it
[1:34:18] wasn't until he was in the presence of
[1:34:20] the Lord that he realized that
[1:34:23] yeah and I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:34:25] saying who shall I send and who shall go
[1:34:28] forth then said I here am I send me
[1:34:33] presence of the Lord will do that
[1:34:35] this is what he went to say may the Lord
[1:34:37] bless his word I think
[1:34:39] that's a most striking scripture that we
[1:34:42] find
[1:34:43] that in the presence of God men
[1:34:46] recognize themselves to be sinners
[1:34:51] he says we may feel pretty good when
[1:34:54] we're out different places and feel like
[1:34:57] that we're pretty good people right but
[1:34:59] when you ever come into the presence of
[1:35:01] God then we see how little we are
[1:35:11] I'll tell you if we knew that we
[1:35:13] couldn't get away with iniquity we
[1:35:15] wouldn't try it
[1:35:17] but it's when those Gates of Hell can
[1:35:20] can get us to think that it's okay
[1:35:26] we'll be okay
[1:35:29] the Gates of Hell came to Jesus
[1:35:32] Matthew chapter 4 and the first thing
[1:35:35] they tried to get him to identify who he
[1:35:38] was just like Satan comes to us
[1:35:40] well if you're a real Christian
[1:35:43] how many times we wonder are we a real
[1:35:45] Christian
[1:35:46] get trying to get us to
[1:35:48] to question our identity where we stand
[1:35:53] those that's the gates of hell that
[1:35:55] we're trying to Prevail against Jesus
[1:35:59] and and said you know if if you could
[1:36:03] just bow down and surrender your will to
[1:36:06] mine this thing is all be over you can
[1:36:07] have the whole kingdoms of the world
[1:36:11] because that's what the big thing was I
[1:36:13] will make my throne above the Throne of
[1:36:14] God I will be like the most high that's
[1:36:17] been on Satan's mind ever since
[1:36:20] and he tried to get Jesus just
[1:36:23] here you you
[1:36:25] can have it all
[1:36:31] he wanted it he came to Earth To Die For
[1:36:34] Us he wanted us
[1:36:37] but he didn't want us
[1:36:40] all to be under Satan
[1:36:45] and that's what Satan tries to get us to
[1:36:47] do he tries to get us to compromise
[1:36:50] just compromise just do this just do
[1:36:54] that this doesn't matter if that doesn't
[1:36:56] matter and I'll give you what you want
[1:37:00] that's why it's more healthy
[1:37:03] not to want
[1:37:06] you you're not as tempted right but so
[1:37:09] that's that's why Jesus said how hard it
[1:37:11] is for a rich man to enter in
[1:37:14] because when you got money no you got
[1:37:17] power to to do a lot with it to buy a
[1:37:19] lot of stuff to do a lot of stuff it
[1:37:21] just you fall into a lot of the Bible
[1:37:24] says a hurtful lust and and and and
[1:37:27] trials and things
[1:37:29] all right Matthew chapter 6 verse 13. oh
[1:37:33] my
[1:37:34] time has slipped away a little bit on us
[1:37:40] I'll I'll try to make this great this is
[1:37:42] a midweek service and I don't mean to
[1:37:44] take us long but I I hope this is being
[1:37:47] a blessing
[1:37:49] Matthew 16 verse 13 when Jesus came
[1:37:52] under the coast of caesarea Philippi he
[1:37:55] asked his disciples saying whom do men
[1:37:57] say that I the son of man am
[1:38:00] now Jesus knew he was going to get a big
[1:38:02] broad view of who he people thought he
[1:38:06] was that's just the way of the world
[1:38:08] people are leaning their own
[1:38:09] understanding their own thoughts
[1:38:11] and they said some say that they are
[1:38:14] John the Baptist Elias others Jeremiahs
[1:38:16] or or one of the prophets there's a big
[1:38:19] view of who Jesus was just like today
[1:38:22] you have so many different churches out
[1:38:24] there so many people going to different
[1:38:25] churches and oh I go to this church I go
[1:38:28] to that church and
[1:38:29] because they feel
[1:38:32] this is God this is where God is at
[1:38:35] and he saith unto them but who do you
[1:38:38] say that I am now he's asking his own
[1:38:41] disciples for Jesus's identity and this
[1:38:44] truly is really what it comes down to
[1:38:46] are we building our life upon the rock
[1:38:50] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[1:38:52] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:38:56] amen I love this because Peter
[1:38:58] identifies himself as Jesus Christ being
[1:39:01] the unadulterated word of God the
[1:39:03] absolute
[1:39:04] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:39:07] blessed art thou sign member Jonah for
[1:39:10] Flesh and Blood did not tell you to you
[1:39:13] you didn't hear it at church
[1:39:15] you didn't read it from a book you
[1:39:17] didn't hear it from Robin's shoulders
[1:39:19] somebody that was in the message a while
[1:39:21] it didn't come from flesh and blood
[1:39:25] but my Father which is in heaven now
[1:39:28] I'll tell you this just throws out the
[1:39:30] crutches and the everything from
[1:39:32] somebody who doesn't want to dig into
[1:39:35] Christ for themselves
[1:39:38] we can't find security just in being in
[1:39:40] the right Church
[1:39:42] we've got to find Christ for ourselves
[1:39:46] and I say unto thee that thou art Peter
[1:39:49] and Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:39:51] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:39:54] against it
[1:39:56] the gates of hell this entrance of I
[1:40:00] don't care about doing all of God's will
[1:40:03] it shall for it won't Prevail over us
[1:40:06] because you've heard from God when you
[1:40:09] just hear from a man
[1:40:12] well
[1:40:14] it's not a big thing
[1:40:15] I mean can't do everything I mean it's
[1:40:18] but when you hear from God
[1:40:20] it's personal
[1:40:22] it means something to you
[1:40:26] we have a promise when we receive the
[1:40:28] word of God you may be shaken but Satan
[1:40:32] will not Prevail amen
[1:40:35] I mean we can say well look what Peter
[1:40:38] went through he had a revelation of
[1:40:39] Jesus who Jesus was and here he denies
[1:40:43] Christ
[1:40:44] but I'm telling you when he denied
[1:40:46] Christ the word of God was in him
[1:40:50] because Jesus prayed for him that his
[1:40:53] faith would fail not
[1:40:56] right you know we go through a lot of
[1:40:57] ups and downs and we expect we kind of
[1:41:00] judge people and ourselves of a certain
[1:41:04] plateau
[1:41:05] about our ups and downs and when we've
[1:41:08] done this we think oh my we just oh
[1:41:11] we're up here we think we're something
[1:41:12] but in reality it's the word of God
[1:41:15] that's hidden our heart
[1:41:17] David said I hide that word that I had
[1:41:19] not sin against thee amen
[1:41:22] he got shaken there he did not have the
[1:41:26] Seal of the Holy Ghost and you know
[1:41:28] we're going to get shaken
[1:41:31] we just need to receive more of God more
[1:41:34] Holy Ghost
[1:41:35] uh if you're sealed get another one
[1:41:38] that's not that's not doctrinal that's
[1:41:41] not that's not a message that was I'm
[1:41:43] just saying don't stop but seeking more
[1:41:46] of the Holy Ghost let's Stand Together
[1:41:54] oh my my you get time
[1:41:56] read Hebrews chapter 12.

[1:42:08] is going to shake heaven and earth all
[1:42:10] right there's a shaking coming
[1:42:13] but we've received a kingdom that cannot
[1:42:16] be moved
[1:42:18] let us have Grace whereby we may serve
