TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and that is try to spend a a few minutes I don't know maybe 15 minutes and just go through some scriptures about prayer and and our whole goal is to try to generate more of a uh a faith that when we do spend our time in prayer we can have an of fire and just more faith and and what it takes to the Bible says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and so we believe that we're just going to read one scripture and then have you be seated um and it's going to be Jeremiah chapter 29 and this is a familiar scripture to us but we want to try to break it down the way that David saw saw the scripture here so Jeremiah 29 ver verse 11 says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end now we that's a promise that we hold on to right all right then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you sayeth the Lord you may be SE did now actually these are this scripture and one more we're going to get into if we were to continue the series on precious promises um we brought a subject of by meeting God's con conditions it actually gives us faith for the promise so when we look at this Promise This Promise is an expected end this promise is peace and but we have to meet God's conditions and and so he's he's telling us here in the scripture uh you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart and that that little bit there of searching with all your heart it it it's very critical to to receive the promise and if we if we if we did that part of just seeking God more when we enter and we go into uh we're having prayer tonight so we're going to be praying one for another we're going to be praying for certain needs and if we can actually just enter in with more of our heart I know it's it's like simple but it's something that we maybe you know we just try to spend that hour in prayer or that time whatever time it is that we end up praying we just end up putting that in prayer we don't put too much emphasis on all the heart and God is looking for all the heart amen okay and Jude CH uh we don't want to turn there but I'm just going to quote it Jude verse 20 says building up yourself in the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost so we literally can build ourselves up during this time of prayer meeting it's not just you know we're having a prayer meet but we can actually build ourselves up in the Most Holy Faith by praying in the holy spirit so we get more of our heart into this time of prayer so if you have a Bible turn with me to uh Daniel chapter n and I just want to read uh the quite a bit of this prayer this was uh Daniel's prayer concerning the very uh uh scriptures that we we just read there in in Jer Jeremiah and even though we're not the children of Israel that have been in Babylon we can still take this scripture because it's it's a promise that we're trying to claim for our life right an expected end that we would have peace well we have to do the fulfilling of our part and seeking God with all our heart and I believe that Daniel sets this example just perfect for all of us let's start with uh verse uh number three verse number three of Daniel chapter 9 and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by Prayer by supplications with fastings and sackcloth and Ashes oh my my my my so it's not just prayer meeting it's supplications supplications that's Earnest prayer that's what that word means if you look that up and it's different than in the New Testament but here in the Old Testament it's meaning Earnest prayer and then it says with fasting so now you're going to go without food you're going to actually hurt your body to because you're you're you're more you want more of your heart to be in it okay and then it says with sackcloth and Ashes of course um in in the Old Testament they literally would have a sackcloth and and Ashes and they would they would wear this on their outside of their body and it was worn to show remorse is what it was for and and here this is what Daniel was doing now of course in our day we don't wear it on the outside right it we it's on the inside and and God sees our heart but we're dressed in humility and it's Don uh Den denotes one's guilt so we're going to come before the Lord in this prayer meeting and we're all guilty but but sometimes we don't want to show that well Daniel saying here if you if you want to seek the Lord with all the heart you got to be dressed with SA cloth and ases so you're the inside of you's got to be um have that remorse for the wrong that you have done that we have done and that we need to take responsibility and not just uh Lord cover me with your blood okay God bless everybody and then prayer prayer is over with you know that's not with all of our heart even though you may mean those words we still have to get a fervency into our prayer prayer so he's listing all these things and he said and I prayed unto the Lord in verse four my God and made my what confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments so he's a he's addressing how great God is who he is and going to make his confession before him and he says here in verse 5 we have sinned and have committed an iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled uh even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments that's a good confession there don't you think neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name for our Kings and princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces so he's making a separation here in is seeking the Lord that there is a difference between him between God and himself God is righteous and we're we get full of confusion because the devil puts thoughts in our minds and we can just do this we could do that and and and really our will is just going to bring confusion to our lives all right as it as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whether thou drivest them because of their trans trespass that they have trespassed against thee wow oh Lord to us belongeth confusion of face belongs to us we deserve it to our Kings to our princes to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord Our God belong mercies and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants and the prophets yeah all Israel have transgressed thy law it kind of sounds just like what what what Jesus said uh there's none good but God and Paul said there's none righteous no not one and and and so if we can just realize that the only good that's ever in US is of god it would just help us to approach with more of our our our heart because look if if if we just you know quickly think you know God cover me with your blood I'm just coming to you now in prayer we're never going to get into the deepness and I'll tell you if God's holy spirit does come to you and bless you with his presence you will begin to repent of those things you will because he just he just demand s it to enter in now I'm thankful for the times that his presence comes and you just you just didn't hardly expect it as it were you know but when it comes you do offer the you do offer you just you make sure that everything is clean and right because you you don't want to be in his presence without pleasing him all right verse 11 um Y and all Israel have transgressed thy law even the departing that they might not obey the voice there for the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him and he have confirmed his words which he has spake against us and against our our judges and that judged Us by bringing upon us a a great evil for under the whole heaven have not been done as have been done upon Jerusalem to whom much is given much is is required amen as it is written in the law of Moses all this evil has come upon us yet may we not our prayer before the Lord Our God that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth therefore have the Lord watched upon the evil and brought it upon us think about that and brought it upon us for the Lord our God is righteous in all his Works which he doeth for we we obeyed not his voice I mean just I I know this just looks like it's like constantly hitting us over the head but it it's not it's it's what's coming out of David's heart this is how he feels and I believe that this is the type of prayer that gets us not only into the presence of the Lord but actually builds our faith and confidence that we could have an expected in because we met his requirements and now oh Lord Our God thou has brought forth has brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and has gotten thee Renown at as it as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly oh Lord according to all thy righteousness I beseech thee let thine anger and thy Fury be turned away from thy City Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain because for our sins and for iniquities of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us now therefore Our God he the prayer of thy servant here he's this far in his prayer and he's saying Lord hear our prayer he's still in that Lord I'm not sure that I found the favor with you and I'm asking for your mercy I'm asking for your grace you know sometimes we can just we can just pray and when we get done it's just a prayer and there was no like contact and I I believe that this type of spirit gets us more in contact and you know what happens when his presence comes it just he just squeezes your heart the tears fall down and you you feel unworthy and then you feel clean and then you're full of joy amen it's just beautiful now therefore Oh Oh Our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear and hear and open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness because our righteousness is filth your EGS but for thy great mercies that's why we're coming before the Lord oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh Lord and hearken and do defer not for thy own sake oh my God for thy City and thy people are called by thy name what a beautiful beautiful prayer and this is the the the the 70 weeks of the years uh part two here that scoffield has and verse 20 and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sins and the sins of My People Israel and presenting my supplications before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yay whilst I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I have seen in the vision at the beginning being cused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening I oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding am it took a little travailing in prayer and that's what we got to realize we're not just here to pray for a little bit we're here to get contact with God we got to meet him and he says at the beginning of thy supp ations the Commandment came forth and I am come to show thee so at the very beginning of his prayer God commands Gabriel go look we just we need to know that God is working on the other side amen and we just we just we want to follow the example you know if if if I'm going to learn how to pray it's going to be an example here in the Bible that that I can learn from and I I believe that God is touched by a a spirit that is more humble and contrite than perhaps than what we're used to using and I it's okay if we get more humble more more contrite it's okay if we break down more it won't hurt us it won't hurt us in fact it'll just open the door for the Lord to come and and fill us with his spirit so let's let's stand together and we'll sing a little chorus as we go to to seek him you know brother brother Ron was talking about uh believing like Christ is is here like he's here knowing he's here and I'll just say we we need to praise him like we know he's here let's let's pray like we know he's here um I just want to add this to the the prayer request brother Moses who was came and ministered for us from Honduras he had contacted us and wanted us to pray for his Pastor which is brother Casco and himself so if we could remember them when we pray for all the missionaries
