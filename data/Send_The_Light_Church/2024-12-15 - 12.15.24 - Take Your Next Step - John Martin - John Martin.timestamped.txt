[37:14] just come and saturate our being as we
[37:18] commit the service and ask your
[37:21] blessings and the reading of the word
[37:23] now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[37:27] amen God bless you turn with me if you
[37:30] would to the book of Hebrews chapter 10
[37:33] and then also Psalms
[37:36] 44 Hebrews chapter 10 and Psalms
[37:41] 44 well this
[37:44] morning it was a little iffy whether we
[37:47] were going to have
[37:49] church and it seems like the last three
[37:52] services out of all the days are the
[37:55] days that we're having services isn't
[37:57] that something it's like the devil not
[38:00] really wanting us to have
[38:03] church but praise God that we're
[38:06] gathered together we get strength from
[38:07] one another strength from being in the
[38:10] house of the Lord and I really
[38:12] appreciated that worship service and
[38:14] just just being able to worship God amen
[38:19] amen this morning we want to en tile the
[38:22] message take your next step take your
[38:26] next step Hebrews chap 10:39 just going
[38:29] to read that verse but we are not of
[38:32] them who draw back onto
[38:35] predition but of them that believe to
[38:37] the saving of the
[38:40] Soul amen that's and then Psalms 44
[38:45] we're not of them that go backwards
[38:47] neither are we of them that stand still
[38:49] but we are of them that keep moving
[38:51] forward take the next step Psalms 44:18
[38:55] says our heart is not turned back
[38:57] neither have our steps declined from the
[39:01] way amen God bless you you may be
[39:09] seated if the devil can ever get us to
[39:12] stop moving forward he's got a good
[39:14] chance to get
[39:15] us but if you're always moving forward
[39:18] in the things of God usually it's hard
[39:21] for the devil to get you and how the
[39:24] devil gets us he he it's hard for you
[39:26] know he's just not going to tell us um
[39:29] okay what I want you to do is I want you
[39:31] to go over and hate this
[39:34] person no he stops he says can you
[39:37] consider what they just said can you
[39:39] just consider what they just done and
[39:42] you you stop there and in reality God
[39:46] wants us to move forward and and love
[39:49] regardless of what is said and it'd be
[39:51] like that with anything before if to the
[39:54] person who never robbed a bank before
[39:57] uh I I'm sure he just didn't get the
[39:59] thought go rub the
[40:00] bank he got the thought to consider the
[40:04] idea never robbed a bank before he I's
[40:07] going to stop and consider this this
[40:08] could be easier than I
[40:10] thought and so we must continue to take
[40:14] our next step with the Lord and in order
[40:19] to do that we need to be thinking what
[40:21] does God want me to do next and to be
[40:24] looking for when the word is being
[40:26] ministered because I do believe that God
[40:29] has a step for us to be taken all of us
[40:31] it we're not on the same plane but we
[40:34] are on the same straight and narrow path
[40:36] walking towards heaven walking towards
[40:39] the statue of a perfect man and as clear
[40:41] as anything he has a step for every one
[40:44] of us and and and it's really up to to
[40:48] each of us as individuals to identify
[40:50] what that step is am amen so good to see
[40:54] brother Orlando here with us back in the
[40:57] house of the Lord God bless you my
[40:59] precious brother amen let's keep our
[41:02] brother and his family in
[41:05] prayer Paul said it like this in
[41:07] Philippians he says Brethren the one
[41:10] thing I do I forget those things which
[41:12] are behind me and I reach forth to those
[41:15] things which are before in other words
[41:18] that word reach forth means to stretch
[41:21] onself Forward Unto those things that
[41:24] are before not sitting here and saying
[41:27] well well you know let the word come to
[41:29] me no stretch forth I want what God has
[41:33] for me I press toward the mark for the
[41:36] prize of the High Calling of God in
[41:40] Christ Jesus now that word press towards
[41:42] it means to pursue to flee or to follow
[41:46] in order to catch it in other words it's
[41:50] going in front and you have to do
[41:52] something to catch it to catch the prize
[41:55] the prize of the High Calling God is not
[41:57] calling his bride to a a lukewarm leoa
[42:01] yeah you believe you you got baptized
[42:03] that's good enough you're in the message
[42:04] you're going to to Heaven that is not
[42:07] the
[42:07] calling he has called us to be just like
[42:10] him to to come to the Statue of a of a
[42:14] perfect man as we have here now Abraham
[42:17] is the father of our
[42:19] faith and he went through all the steps
[42:23] of faith and we see here that I believe
[42:26] that Abraham he he he walked these steps
[42:30] and he started out with faith this was
[42:33] the first step and you have to add to
[42:35] your faith virtue but did you know it
[42:37] takes Faith to add
[42:39] virtue it literally takes Faith to add
[42:42] knowledge to Virtue it takes Faith to
[42:45] add every one of these it takes Faith uh
[42:47] to to to add the love of God to your
[42:50] life but we'll see here the very
[42:52] Pentacle he started here and it was at
[42:55] the very end when he offered up his son
[42:58] Isaac he said now I know that you love
[43:01] me he he went through all these these
[43:03] these steps and I'll say it like this
[43:06] there's there's many
[43:07] steps in Romans
[43:11] 4:1
[43:12] here it says that Faith was reckoned to
[43:16] Abraham before he even received the Seal
[43:18] of the Holy Spirit we know that brother
[43:19] brandham taught us this and he received
[43:23] the sign of circumcision a seal of the
[43:26] righteousness of Faith which he had yet
[43:29] been
[43:31] uncircumcised that he might be the
[43:33] father of us of all them that
[43:36] believe though they be not circumcised
[43:41] we're not Jews we're not in the faith
[43:44] yet the righteousness might be imputed
[43:47] unto them also and the father of
[43:50] circumcision to them who are not of the
[43:52] circumcision only but ALS but who also
[43:55] walk in the steps of that Faith of Our
[43:58] Father Abraham which he had yet uh which
[44:02] he had been yet uncircumcised so what's
[44:05] wonderful about this we know that the
[44:08] circumcision is the cutting away of the
[44:10] world out of our life the old nature
[44:13] just cut it out and away from it and God
[44:16] is saying that he he as God gave Faith a
[44:21] unto Abraham to to to be justified so
[44:25] they that believe just like Abraham
[44:28] believed we too can become justified in
[44:31] the sight of God with yet that yucky
[44:35] nature on us right before it's cut off
[44:38] we we've got to everything is by faith
[44:40] God built everything made everything
[44:43] created everything by faith and we
[44:45] become into His Image by that same
[44:48] faith and and we we as Paul said I live
[44:52] by the faith of the son of man we have
[44:54] to have that Faith inside amen
[44:58] now the first step that Abraham took was
[45:01] he he left behind everything to follow
[45:05] God he left his idols he left his career
[45:08] he left his family he left his friends
[45:11] to follow the word of God Amen and it's
[45:15] no different than the children of Israel
[45:17] when they left
[45:20] Egypt it's no different than when the
[45:22] disciples they left their own
[45:25] jobs they left everything to follow
[45:28] Christ and the first step in the Born
[45:31] Again
[45:32] process is justification by
[45:35] faith we repent from the selfish life
[45:38] that we were living that was really
[45:41] brought upon by a selfish nature amen
[45:46] so it takes time to understand that we
[45:49] we need to fully repent of that selfish
[45:52] nature a and to to to step away from
[45:55] that
[45:57] and we decided to forsake everything
[46:00] just to follow God which is the word of
[46:03] God and it was all by faith right
[46:05] because there was nothing there to prove
[46:07] anything to us we didn't get a picture
[46:09] of heaven or picture of God or a picture
[46:11] that were you know uh we didn't watch
[46:14] something see something that this is
[46:16] what was going to happen if you believe
[46:18] there was something in our heart that
[46:20] didn't didn't want to go to hell we
[46:21] wanted we wanted to know God we wanted
[46:23] to serve God there was there was
[46:25] something inside the it was the seed of
[46:28] God and it it it it it it responded back
[46:31] to God are you with
[46:33] me
[46:35] now there are a lot of
[46:38] steps that we take after that first step
[46:41] with
[46:42] Christ until we come to our last step
[46:45] through raptures
[46:47] door there's me there's many
[46:51] steps and it actually is quite easy to
[46:53] get out of step with
[46:55] God to start doing what we want to do
[46:58] instead of doing what God wants us to
[47:00] do and if we don't keep the old nature
[47:04] crucified then that old nature becomes
[47:07] the headship of another
[47:10] Direction and and the the enemies he
[47:12] always brings us back to that point well
[47:15] I repented I got baptized I I made that
[47:19] that commitment to God our thought goes
[47:21] back to there but it stops there and
[47:24] people seem to just uh a lot of
[47:26] believers seem to just kind of do what
[47:27] they want to do and that's why they can
[47:29] come to church they can hear the word of
[47:31] God they can be told by somebody this is
[47:33] what God wants them to do and it kind of
[47:35] goes in one ear and out the
[47:37] other so we see what's really going on
[47:40] at this point Proverbs 212 tells us for
[47:44] every way of a man is right in his own
[47:48] eyes every way but the Lord pth his
[47:52] heart so we need to make sure that we're
[47:55] we keep walking in the light of God's
[47:57] word as he speaks it to us our opening
[48:01] scripture but we are we are not of them
[48:03] that draw back unto predition that means
[48:05] ruin or loss we're not of them that that
[48:08] come to a ruin that come to a loss with
[48:10] our walk with Christ but we are of them
[48:13] that
[48:14] believe to the saving of the Soul not
[48:17] the saved of the Soul not past tense but
[48:21] to the saving we're in the I'm in the
[48:23] midst of being saved today amen that's
[48:26] where I'm at I'm pressing I'm I'm I'm
[48:29] pressing I'm not of that group that says
[48:31] I'm
[48:32] saved I'm not I'm not of that
[48:35] group I mean if you want to take that
[48:38] that thought process we were saved
[48:40] before the foundation of the world we
[48:42] were predestinated so if that's the case
[48:44] why do we even repent and get baptized
[48:47] right so there is a continuation until
[48:49] we come into His Image our heart is not
[48:53] our heart is not turned back neither
[48:55] have our steps
[48:59] declined this is really important it it
[49:02] takes some real soul searching for us to
[49:05] to take a look at how we are walking
[49:08] compared to how we were once walking at
[49:11] the closest time of our walk with
[49:16] God because it's easy for us to falter
[49:18] and to begin to kind of take over the
[49:22] Reigns and to uh put our thoughts into
[49:28] what we think we ought to be doing and
[49:31] in reality the word should be dictating
[49:34] to us what to do my sheep know my voice
[49:37] which is the word they follow me the
[49:39] word and it's not like well God didn't
[49:41] speak that to me personally it you you
[49:44] come to church to hear from God if
[49:46] you're not hearing from God then prepare
[49:48] your heart because God's speaking God
[49:50] speaking
[49:52] amen now you can't look back at the
[49:55] beginning of your faith
[49:57] and say that you were saved today that
[50:00] you're saved today
[50:02] because of that
[50:04] day you can't do
[50:07] that you can't look back at a past date
[50:10] and say I have salvation today because
[50:13] of something in the
[50:17] past
[50:19] unless your life is still holding the
[50:22] same beginning
[50:24] commitment that is the only way you can
[50:26] say it but it has to be doing
[50:32] that 2 Corinthians 6 tells us behold now
[50:35] is the acceptable time behold now is the
[50:38] day of salvation now not back
[50:41] then 1 Peter chapter 1:8 says God whom
[50:46] he have not seen you love in whom though
[50:48] now you see him not yet believing you
[50:51] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[50:56] glor Glory receiving the end of your
[51:01] faith what is the end of your faith it
[51:04] is the Salvation of your souls it's not
[51:06] the
[51:08] beginning and this is this is why it's
[51:11] really important that we have a heart to
[51:13] hit the
[51:14] end to grow in Christ because you know
[51:17] the churches out there they teach well I
[51:19] repented I got baptized on this day this
[51:21] day I got saved and I know the day I
[51:24] know what happened I can remember how it
[51:25] happened and that is wonderful but you
[51:28] have got to maintain your
[51:31] growing in the other things that God is
[51:34] telling you in order for that to
[51:39] remain and so this this thing of you
[51:42] know maybe coming into church when you
[51:44] don't feel like it or you don't want to
[51:47] listen or you don't want to do the
[51:49] things that somebody's telling you you
[51:50] read the Bible you're
[51:52] praying you you you develop a habit of
[51:55] I'm serving God but I'm to serve God my
[51:57] way there's more than one way to serve
[51:59] God I'm going to tell you there's only
[52:00] one way to serve God and it's do what
[52:02] his word says that's it that's it
[52:04] there's that's only one way in fact when
[52:06] he told his disciples I'm leaving go
[52:08] preach the word make sure you teach them
[52:10] to observe all things whatsoever I've
[52:12] commanded you and low them with you to
[52:13] the
[52:16] end so we don't want to complicate
[52:20] it always remember God is looking for us
[52:23] to take the next step
[52:26] so we have to make sure that it's our
[52:29] desire to take the next step we have to
[52:31] be humble we have to remain
[52:34] humble and you will find that next step
[52:37] is really hidden in
[52:40] Simplicity you don't expect God to call
[52:42] you on the phone and say brother stand
[52:45] my son stand my
[52:48] brethren this is what I want you to
[52:52] do
[52:55] no his voice can come speaking in such a
[53:00] simple
[53:02] way but it's still him saying brother
[53:05] Stan or my son Stan either way it
[53:08] is but it's up to us to catch what that
[53:11] is
[53:13] am how many's enjoying the
[53:16] word all right well you can let me know
[53:18] you know as
[53:20] we're Hebrews chapter 3:12 I I believe
[53:24] that you you'll you'll you'll enjoy this
[53:26] Hebrews chap 3:12 take heed my brethren
[53:29] lest you lest there be in any of you an
[53:32] evil heart of unbelief and departing
[53:34] from the Living God we've talked about
[53:36] this before people want to serve a dead
[53:38] God here's the rules this is what I did
[53:41] but they're missing god with me today
[53:44] right a living God he says but exhort
[53:46] one another daily exhort try to
[53:49] encourage one another to serve God every
[53:51] day you ever try to tell somebody to you
[53:53] know this is what God want I think I
[53:55] believe this is what God is wanting us
[53:57] to do and they just say no I don't think
[54:00] so so we we we we we need to exhort one
[54:04] another daily while is called today lest
[54:06] any of you be hardened through I don't
[54:10] have to do
[54:11] it the deceitfulness of
[54:14] sin and here's the scripture for we are
[54:18] we are made partakers of Christ if we
[54:22] hold the beginning of our confidence
[54:25] steadfast un the
[54:28] end that word steadfast means firm
[54:31] steady stable and
[54:34] sure now that's the beginning kind
[54:37] that's what we had at the begin when we
[54:38] all repented got baptized we were sure
[54:40] of it I want to go to
[54:42] heaven the hard job is to maintain that
[54:45] firm to the end and you would you have
[54:49] be God will give you many steps to take
[54:52] and each one of those steps you have to
[54:54] believe for and stay steady
[54:56] stay sure Stay Stay rock solid as you
[55:00] walk to the top in your last test I
[55:03] think is going to be the
[55:06] greatest no brother brand he came back
[55:08] from the curtain time he says whatever
[55:10] you do get perfect love and that's what
[55:12] Abraham showed that he had at the
[55:15] end and I I don't think it's going to be
[55:17] given to us like Christmas has comeing
[55:19] we're all getting
[55:20] gifts Christmas is coming somebody's
[55:22] going to get a gift give a gift and when
[55:25] you get a gift it it you don't usually
[55:27] got I have to give something back how
[55:29] much I owe you for this
[55:30] one it's a gift it's given to
[55:35] you but God is not going to give anybody
[55:38] character he does not gift anybody with
[55:41] character and that's the only that's
[55:42] going to be on the other side it has to
[55:45] be overcomed it has you have to overcome
[55:48] to get the character am so that means
[55:51] you you you do have to take that step
[55:52] you do have to overcome you have to to
[55:55] be like Christ
[55:57] so you need to as you're going through
[55:59] these
[56:00] trials we're made partakers of Christ if
[56:03] we continue to hold the beginning of our
[56:05] convers steadfast until the end you
[56:07] can't just stop Midway and say I'm a
[56:10] Christian don't get caught in that light
[56:12] of the devil while it is said today if
[56:15] you will hear his voice Harden not your
[56:18] heart as in the
[56:20] provocation so it's easy to sit in
[56:22] church and hear the word that you need
[56:24] to do this and you you need to stop
[56:26] doing and that and we need to like grow
[56:28] up and we need to become more like
[56:29] Christ and after a while you know that
[56:32] word provocation means irritation it
[56:35] means annoyed we can literally become
[56:37] annoyed by the word or irritated by the
[56:39] word impatient it means it means
[56:42] slightly angry our hearts can become
[56:44] hardened because of the
[56:47] word now the word don't do it the word
[56:51] sets us free what does it is our
[56:54] attitude towards the word
[56:57] and that's why it says the Holy Ghost is
[56:59] speaking Harden not your heart in other
[57:03] words it's got to go through free more
[57:04] agency just say yes Lord I'll walk with
[57:07] you so our next step is to obey every
[57:11] word of God that he speaks to
[57:14] us don't get any I don't care attitude
[57:18] don't get any I'm just gonna ignore this
[57:22] or or don't get puffed up don't Harden
[57:25] your heart just because his voice which
[57:27] is the word irritates you just say
[57:31] Lord something must be wrong with my
[57:34] spirit if I feel this way and and I'm
[57:37] sorry and and I I pray that you just
[57:41] lift this for me and just start
[57:42] worshiping him love him say say Amen to
[57:45] the word even though your flesh don't
[57:46] want to do it don't wait till your flesh
[57:48] wants to do it to say Amen to the word
[57:50] don't do that your flesh is not gonna if
[57:52] your flesh wants to en enjoy saying Amen
[57:55] to the word
[57:56] I I think something's wrong I mean if
[57:59] you think about it isn't that what the
[58:00] Hypocrites do they enjoy that part so
[58:05] your flesh doesn't have to enjoy it but
[58:08] it has to surrender to the word amen it
[58:11] has to surrender so you know just tell
[58:13] the devil get behind me so be it Lord so
[58:16] be it holy ghost come in come in and
[58:18] take over I'm going to take this next
[58:19] step with
[58:21] you our next step is to obey whatever
[58:26] we hear the Lord
[58:28] speaking if it's in his word just follow
[58:31] okay Hebrews chapter 10: 36 says for you
[58:35] have need of patience Hebrews 10:36 for
[58:39] you have need of patience that after you
[58:41] have done the will of God you might
[58:44] receive the
[58:47] promise did not God put Abraham through
[58:51] a lot of patience
[58:56] God was saying to Abraham you have need
[58:58] of
[59:00] patience you have need of patience and
[59:02] after you've done the will of God you
[59:04] might receive the
[59:05] promise and after he received
[59:08] Isaac he still was in
[59:12] need amen he was still in need not so
[59:17] much of the of the patience anymore but
[59:20] he was in need of perfect
[59:24] love and God put him to that test and it
[59:27] took
[59:28] faith God if God is going to to kill
[59:32] Isaac God is more than able to raise him
[59:34] up it took Faith to get perfect
[59:37] love and and and look Saints this is not
[59:40] just coming to church and hearing A good
[59:42] sermon there God is really trying to
[59:44] send us a message to get
[59:46] ready he says for yet a little while and
[59:50] he that shall come will come and will
[59:54] not t
[59:57] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:00:01] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:00:06] pleasure in
[1:00:09] him no pleasure in the person who stands
[1:00:14] still that's drawing back did you know
[1:00:17] standing still is drawing back from
[1:00:20] pressing towards the
[1:00:22] mark you stop pressing you're drawing
[1:00:25] back drawing back doesn't necessarily
[1:00:27] mean
[1:00:30] this so that's why we need to be always
[1:00:33] moving forward but we are not of them
[1:00:34] who draw back unto predition but of them
[1:00:37] that believe into the saving of the Soul
[1:00:40] amen Romans chapter 4 verse 13 I hope
[1:00:43] this is not too heavy for
[1:00:45] anybody no all
[1:00:48] right Romans chapter 4 verse 13 for the
[1:00:51] promise that he should be the heir
[1:00:55] Abraham should be the heir of the world
[1:00:57] was not to Abraham or to his seed
[1:01:00] through the law but through the
[1:01:03] righteousness of Faith so we receive all
[1:01:08] the nature that God is through
[1:01:13] faith by these precious promises that
[1:01:16] God has given us faith in believing that
[1:01:18] God wants me to be like him in his image
[1:01:21] to to have these virtues to be able to
[1:01:23] live this life it is by faith that we
[1:01:26] receive
[1:01:27] it for if they which are of the law be
[1:01:30] Hees faith is made void and the promise
[1:01:34] made of n effect because the law worketh
[1:01:37] wrath for where no laws there's no
[1:01:39] transgression therefore it is of faith
[1:01:41] that it might be by grace to the end the
[1:01:43] promise might be sure to all of us not
[1:01:48] to them only which is of the law but to
[1:01:51] them also which is of the faith of
[1:01:54] Abraham who is the father of us
[1:01:59] all as it is written I have made thee a
[1:02:01] father of many nations before him whom
[1:02:04] we believed even God who quith the dead
[1:02:07] and calleth those things which be not as
[1:02:10] though they were so we can say today you
[1:02:12] know what I just don't have the patience
[1:02:15] that I I that that God wants me to have
[1:02:18] but by faith I am going to have it
[1:02:22] amen it starts with that it starts with
[1:02:24] a confession you you got to confess it
[1:02:26] you got to say I believe it this is what
[1:02:29] I'm saying I often say this when when
[1:02:31] you meet the devil you need to tell them
[1:02:32] where you
[1:02:35] stand if you don't he'll just push his
[1:02:38] way into your life that's right and and
[1:02:41] you you I I heard that one woman say I
[1:02:43] may not be what I need to be but I I
[1:02:47] thank God that I'm not what I used to be
[1:02:50] and and and
[1:02:51] so but by faith we're going to get there
[1:02:54] amen by faith Faith we're going to get
[1:02:56] there so we need to be active like when
[1:02:58] the word is coming forth the word is
[1:03:00] being preached you're listening to a
[1:03:02] tape you're on your knees you're praying
[1:03:04] we've all experienced I experienced this
[1:03:06] you're praying and all of a sudden the
[1:03:08] scripture comes to you that is God
[1:03:10] speaking to you now I don't know what
[1:03:12] he's speaking to you when he says that
[1:03:13] scripture but he is speaking and you you
[1:03:16] receive that you say Amen I'm going to
[1:03:19] walk in it and this is I'm going to tell
[1:03:21] you what
[1:03:28] if somebody wanted to to be able
[1:03:33] to uh to to to learn how to work on
[1:03:38] cars and Brother Bruce says I'm going to
[1:03:41] show you how to take a carart and put it
[1:03:44] back
[1:03:45] together he's capable of doing
[1:03:48] it but you say nah I don't need I don't
[1:03:52] need or or you go there and you're just
[1:03:54] like hey what's this over here and
[1:03:56] you're not paying
[1:03:57] attention how are you going to grow to
[1:04:00] be a
[1:04:02] mechanic you you you've got to be hungry
[1:04:04] and show me show me that again why is
[1:04:06] this how does it what about this so when
[1:04:09] you come to church you got to get into
[1:04:10] the
[1:04:11] word because this word is for you it's
[1:04:15] for the seed right it's for the
[1:04:20] seed what verse are we on there
[1:04:26] all
[1:04:27] right as it is written verse 17 I've
[1:04:30] made the a father of many nations before
[1:04:33] whom he believed even God who quickeneth
[1:04:35] the dead and call those things which be
[1:04:38] not as though they were who against HED
[1:04:41] he believed in hope that he might become
[1:04:42] the father of many nations according to
[1:04:45] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[1:04:48] be that's
[1:04:50] us and being not weak in this very
[1:04:54] important
[1:04:56] foundation not being weak in the
[1:04:59] foundation he considered not his own
[1:05:03] body now being dead when he was about a
[1:05:06] 100 years old neither yet the deadness
[1:05:10] of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the
[1:05:13] promises of God through unbelief but was
[1:05:16] strong in faith giving glory to
[1:05:20] God Amen I am going to be like Jesus you
[1:05:26] know sometimes we walk around with such
[1:05:27] a sour
[1:05:31] testimony this going to I just can't
[1:05:34] believe
[1:05:38] this and it we don't even have
[1:05:41] to have a son when we're
[1:05:45] 90 or a 100 right we don't even have to
[1:05:48] do what he's going we just got one thing
[1:05:50] to overcome and that's the thought
[1:05:52] that's coming to our head it's all we
[1:05:54] got to do amen and we won't do
[1:05:57] it sometimes we get so lazy and well
[1:06:00] well you I'm just you know this it
[1:06:01] becomes a religion this is not a
[1:06:03] religion this is a living God he wants
[1:06:05] us to take the thoughts that come into
[1:06:07] our head and he wants us to be more than
[1:06:10] fully
[1:06:11] persuaded we're more than able to to to
[1:06:14] to trust God in this
[1:06:18] situation and give God glory not the
[1:06:21] devil and being fully persuaded that
[1:06:24] what he had promised he was able to also
[1:06:27] perform so we need to maybe make this
[1:06:30] statement has God spoken to you that
[1:06:35] you're going to be like
[1:06:36] him has he spoken that to
[1:06:40] you it's a promise
[1:06:43] then you need to claim the
[1:06:45] promise you need to be fully persuaded
[1:06:48] of it you need to be reminded him of
[1:06:52] it Lord
[1:06:56] you heard my
[1:07:01] confession brother BR says God likes to
[1:07:03] be reminded of his
[1:07:06] promises so the the worst thing to do is
[1:07:09] to get that off your mind you know to
[1:07:11] come to church with everything else in
[1:07:12] your mind and to expect somehow the
[1:07:14] songs and have such a an encour or an
[1:07:18] entertaining message help us that that
[1:07:21] is not it it's a it's about a realness
[1:07:24] with God that you have before you come
[1:07:27] into the house of
[1:07:29] God that God
[1:07:31] can can get serious with you I mean it
[1:07:34] was a serious
[1:07:37] situation that didn't happen to anybody
[1:07:39] else there before Abraham that
[1:07:43] is right having to wait and turn them
[1:07:46] back young again this experience that
[1:07:48] Abraham he's the father of our faith
[1:07:50] right amen amen I want to read a a
[1:07:53] little uh a little story
[1:07:56] in the greatest battle ever fought my uh
[1:07:58] my daughter an had shared this with me
[1:08:00] and kind of is what kind of prompted the
[1:08:02] whole message today uh earlier this
[1:08:05] week brother bam speaking in the
[1:08:07] greatest batt over fall he says I went

[1:08:18] game he said I stopped at the door and I
[1:08:21] looked up and there it said it's not the
[1:08:24] size of the dog in the

[1:08:45] they are it's the fight that's in the
[1:08:48] dog that it

[1:14:34] on going one objective I'm going to win
[1:14:36] amen I can't lose I'm going to win
[1:14:41] amen you know Jesus said the kingdom of
[1:14:45] God suffer violent and the Violet take
[1:14:47] it by force they press their way into
[1:14:50] the
[1:14:51] kingdom You' got to take the next step
[1:14:54] and it's not going to going to be a
[1:14:55] comfortable one it's not going to be
[1:14:57] easy if you're going to get if you're
[1:15:00] going to do anything that's of any value
[1:15:02] you're going to have to work for it
[1:15:04] you're going to have to suffer for it
[1:15:06] you're going to have to give up the
[1:15:07] flesh for
[1:15:10] it often times what the Lord asks us to
[1:15:13] do is not always easy but we still need
[1:15:16] to walk in
[1:15:18] it God tells us to do
[1:15:21] something if we don't do it we're
[1:15:24] walking in Darkness at that moment I
[1:15:27] want you to think about that God tells
[1:15:28] you to do something and you say well
[1:15:32] I'll deal with that
[1:15:34] later like you don't get Ser you're
[1:15:36] actually at that moment you're walking
[1:15:39] in darkness walking in darkness is not
[1:15:42] just oh I'm GNA leave this I'm gonna go
[1:15:44] do this bad thing walking in darkness is
[1:15:47] not doing what the light told you to
[1:15:50] do that's the true definition there 1
[1:15:53] John chapter 1 verse5 1 John 1:5 says
[1:15:56] then this is the message which we heard
[1:15:57] of him and declare unto you that God is
[1:16:00] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:16:02] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:16:04] him and we choose to walk in darkness we
[1:16:06] lie and do not the truth but if we walk
[1:16:08] in the light see the
[1:16:13] light as he is in the light then we have
[1:16:16] fellowship with one another and the
[1:16:17] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:16:19] us from all
[1:16:23] sin the important importance that when
[1:16:25] you hear the word now here I'm just
[1:16:27] going to say this you ever walk into a
[1:16:29] room and you can't quite see something
[1:16:31] or you're walking on the street or you
[1:16:33] you're in a parking lot and there's
[1:16:34] certain areas that are
[1:16:36] dark and it and and and you you look
[1:16:40] forward to see coming into the light so
[1:16:43] you can see
[1:16:45] better because it's not quite light
[1:16:47] enough where you're
[1:16:48] at sometimes we're wanting there to be
[1:16:51] light so you can like get to your car I
[1:16:53] mean often times we didn't have our our
[1:16:56] our uh our lights on on the porch we
[1:16:58] come up to the house we're trying to
[1:16:59] unlock the door we can't even see our
[1:17:01] keys we have to pull the flashlight out
[1:17:04] turn the flashlight on or pull the phone
[1:17:07] out put the flashlight on to look at her
[1:17:09] key which one the key is and get it into
[1:17:11] the door you need the light to see what
[1:17:14] you're doing amen and the word is the
[1:17:17] light for our life amen and if you don't
[1:17:20] walk in that as he gives it to you
[1:17:24] you're still walking in
[1:17:26] darkness we need to walk in the light as
[1:17:29] God gives us the light so we have to
[1:17:32] keep putting one step in front of the
[1:17:34] other just one step at a time Thy word
[1:17:38] is a lamp unto my feet it is a light
[1:17:41] unto my path amen Abraham kept walking
[1:17:44] in the light he kept taking one step at
[1:17:47] a time he's the father of our faith and
[1:17:50] he kept the
[1:17:52] faith he kept the faith right to to the
[1:17:55] end he didn't stop it he kept it how
[1:17:57] many people we know that were at one
[1:17:59] time real good strong church goers and
[1:18:01] they've let off on the
[1:18:06] gas this serious
[1:18:09] business to me they're not Keeping the
[1:18:12] Faith they're not holding that beginning
[1:18:15] confidence steadfast to the end now you
[1:18:17] go ask them are you are you a Christian
[1:18:19] oh yeah I'm a Christian are you saved oh
[1:18:21] yeah I'm saved but you know according to
[1:18:23] the scriptures something's wrong
[1:18:25] amen and we we should never get
[1:18:27] comfortable with that now I'm not here
[1:18:29] to judge that that person is not going
[1:18:31] to make it but I'm telling you if
[1:18:32] they're going to make it they're going
[1:18:33] to have to repent and turn around that I
[1:18:37] know because if they can do that and get
[1:18:39] away with it why are we here preaching
[1:18:41] the word why are we here preaching to
[1:18:43] come into His
[1:18:47] Image Genesis chapter 22 verse 1 I want
[1:18:50] to try to go through the this real quick
[1:18:52] this is was the end here when God God
[1:18:55] came to the pentacle or or or or
[1:18:59] uh Abraham came to the pentacle of of of
[1:19:02] perfect love here and it came to pass
[1:19:05] after these things that God did tempt
[1:19:07] Abraham now put yourself in this
[1:19:09] position and said unto him Abraham and
[1:19:12] he said behold here am I and he said
[1:19:15] take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom
[1:19:18] thou
[1:19:20] lovest and give thee get thee into the
[1:19:24] land of morah and offer him there for a
[1:19:27] burnt offering upon one of the mountains
[1:19:29] which I will tell thee of and Abraham
[1:19:31] rose up early in the morning and settled
[1:19:33] his ass and took the young men with him
[1:19:36] Isaac and his son and clav the wood for
[1:19:39] the burnt offering and Rose up and went
[1:19:41] into the place which God had told him
[1:19:43] now I want you to understand we don't
[1:19:45] know exactly all the verbiage that took
[1:19:47] place at that time but it just seems to
[1:19:49] me that uh Abraham
[1:19:52] obeyed and that's the kind of attitude
[1:19:54] that we need to have when we hear the
[1:19:55] word of God just just just obey
[1:19:58] it then on the third day Abraham lifted
[1:20:01] up his eyes and saw the place a far off
[1:20:03] and Abraham said unto his young men
[1:20:06] abide ye here with the S and I and the
[1:20:09] lad will go Yonder and worship and what
[1:20:12] come again to
[1:20:15] you I I could see why Abraham didn't
[1:20:19] mind I shouldn't say didn't mind but it
[1:20:21] kind of cuts what I'm saying didn't mind
[1:20:23] having to kill Isaac because he believed
[1:20:26] that God would raise him up again he had
[1:20:27] to because he was the promised son amen
[1:20:30] that's the way we need to believe if I
[1:20:32] go through this trial it doesn't matter
[1:20:34] what happens to me I know that all
[1:20:36] things are going to work together for
[1:20:37] the good I I've already been
[1:20:40] predestinated to make it into His Image
[1:20:42] so if he wants me to suffer a while and
[1:20:44] go through this and do that and lay down
[1:20:46] my life here and help this person so be
[1:20:49] it because I am going to be just like
[1:20:51] him amen kind of attitude we need to
[1:20:54] have
[1:20:57] and Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:20:59] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[1:21:02] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:21:04] knife and they both and and they both of
[1:21:08] them they went both of them together and
[1:21:11] Isaac spake unto his unto Abraham his
[1:21:14] father and said father my father and he
[1:21:16] said here am
[1:21:18] I my
[1:21:20] son still a sobering moment right
[1:21:22] because he's in the flesh
[1:21:25] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[1:21:29] but where is the Lamb for a burnt
[1:21:31] offering now I want you to understand
[1:21:33] this Abraham had a
[1:21:37] revelation what was going to
[1:21:39] happen his son did
[1:21:42] not a lot of times when we're dealing
[1:21:44] with our children or those that are not
[1:21:47] were they I'm saying young in the
[1:21:50] Lord they don't have a revelation of the
[1:21:54] image that they're supposed to be
[1:21:58] in but we still need to speak with them
[1:22:01] of confidence that what you're telling
[1:22:03] them is the will of God brother Brandon
[1:22:05] said like this in the token you must
[1:22:07] believe that when you apply the token in
[1:22:09] your home to your children that it will
[1:22:11] make a
[1:22:12] difference believe that that's the faith
[1:22:15] that that Abraham
[1:22:20] had and Abraham said my son God will
[1:22:22] provide himself a lamb
[1:22:25] for a burnt
[1:22:27] offering so they went both of them
[1:22:30] together how you know how we think about
[1:22:33] David and he spoke all those prophetic
[1:22:35] things that you know we don't even know
[1:22:37] he knew them all right my God my God why
[1:22:39] is Al for say he didn't maybe even know
[1:22:41] that God was going to say that and a lot
[1:22:44] of times God uses our mouth when we're
[1:22:45] talking to people he
[1:22:51] does and they came to the place which
[1:22:54] God had told him of and Abraham built an
[1:22:56] altar there and laid the wood in order
[1:22:59] and bound Isaac his son and laid him on
[1:23:01] the altar upon the wood and Abraham
[1:23:03] stretched forth his hand and took the
[1:23:05] knife to slay his son and the angel of
[1:23:07] the Lord called unto him out of
[1:23:10] Heaven called him out of out of heaven
[1:23:13] and said Abraham Abraham and he said
[1:23:15] here am
[1:23:18] I have you ever said that in church when
[1:23:21] God called you here am I Lord
[1:23:25] here am
[1:23:26] I not only speak Lord but I will
[1:23:32] obey and he said lay not thine hand upon
[1:23:35] the lad neither do thou anything unto
[1:23:38] him for now I know the God know that
[1:23:42] knows everything he says for now I know
[1:23:45] that thou fearest God seeing thou has
[1:23:48] not withhold thy son thy only son from
[1:23:51] me and Abraham lifted his eyes and
[1:23:54] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:23:57] caught in a Thicket by the horns and
[1:23:59] Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:24:01] offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:24:02] instead of his
[1:24:06] son now I
[1:24:08] know it wasn't that God does God knows
[1:24:11] what we're going to be thinking about he
[1:24:12] knows what we're thinking about right
[1:24:13] now amen he knows what we're going to be
[1:24:15] thinking about five minutes he knows
[1:24:19] everything but what he was really saying
[1:24:22] is here is the manif estation of the
[1:24:25] life that you need to be
[1:24:27] living I need you to I expect you to
[1:24:32] live this life not just say well yeah of
[1:24:36] course I believe that you can do
[1:24:38] it be
[1:24:41] willing to take the step by faith and do
[1:24:45] what God told you to do no matter how
[1:24:47] scary it
[1:24:49] seems because what you have a purpose
[1:24:52] Peter cartright had a purpose
[1:24:55] and you know what we all have a purpose
[1:24:59] amen and I I'll say it like this I say
[1:25:02] humbly respectfully I think the purpose
[1:25:05] is greater than what we all know because
[1:25:07] I don't it wasn't at the beginning of
[1:25:10] Abraham's calling that God told Abraham
[1:25:13] you know what I'm going to put you in
[1:25:14] such a position I'm going to make you
[1:25:16] kill your son after I promis it all that
[1:25:19] whole steps of his walk is where's my
[1:25:20] son I I I all I have is when is my my
[1:25:24] seat going to come and we're taught that
[1:25:26] he had to fight those thoughts and step
[1:25:28] out by faith and trust God and keep
[1:25:30] making the booties and all that stuff
[1:25:33] but he never told them about what was
[1:25:35] going to happen I'm telling you we got
[1:25:37] tests coming we got trials coming and
[1:25:39] we've got to learn to take one step at a
[1:25:41] time because if we don't take those
[1:25:43] Steps of Faith we'll never have faith
[1:25:45] for perfect love we'll never be able to
[1:25:47] have faith I am telling you the truth if
[1:25:49] we don't learn to be faithful with what
[1:25:51] we have we'll never about to do what God
[1:25:53] is calling us to do
[1:25:57] this thought process of well I'm I'm in
[1:25:59] the message I'm going to go on the
[1:26:01] Rapture I because I'm I'm no that it
[1:26:03] isn't like that you know many people
[1:26:04] that are that are they say that they're
[1:26:06] in this message that they're not going
[1:26:07] into
[1:26:09] Rapture a lot more than
[1:26:12] our Oh Brother John
[1:26:28] it's not believing the message
[1:26:32] intellectually that puts us into the
[1:26:35] puts us into the
[1:26:37] Rapture it's taking what the message
[1:26:40] taught
[1:26:42] us which is the voice of God about his
[1:26:45] word really to the bride that's what
[1:26:48] that is is taking that and applying the
[1:26:51] token to your
[1:26:53] home and living the
[1:26:55] word that puts
[1:26:58] you in
[1:27:00] preparation my let's
[1:27:03] Rejoice his wife have made herself ready
[1:27:07] for the Rapture that's how we make
[1:27:09] ourselves ready we don't make ourselves
[1:27:11] ready the way we want to make ourselves
[1:27:13] ready we don't add to what the
[1:27:15] chamberlains have already told us what
[1:27:17] we need just do do what the prophet said
[1:27:20] amen amen all right now the end of
[1:27:24] Abraham's
[1:27:26] Faith he started out with faith he ended
[1:27:29] in faith and like Paul told Timothy in 2
[1:27:32] Timothy 4:6 for I am now ready to be
[1:27:37] offered and the time of my departure is
[1:27:39] at hand I have fought a good
[1:27:43] fight I have finished my course and look
[1:27:46] at these beautiful words I have kept the
[1:27:50] faith I have kept it Abraham kept it to
[1:27:54] the
[1:27:55] end where where are these brothers and
[1:27:58] sisters who are not putting their heart
[1:28:00] into the
[1:28:03] word henceforth there is laid up for me
[1:28:07] a crown of
[1:28:09] righteousness which the
[1:28:11] Lord the righteous judge shall give to
[1:28:13] me at that day and not to me only but
[1:28:16] unto all them also that love his
[1:28:20] appearing if people don't love going to
[1:28:23] church they prob probably are not going
[1:28:25] to love his
[1:28:27] appearing that's all he can
[1:28:30] say if a person is just going to act
[1:28:32] like they have
[1:28:35] faith but they're not walking in the
[1:28:38] light of the
[1:28:39] word then their faith is not the same
[1:28:43] Faith as the faith of
[1:28:44] Abraham it's not it's not the faith
[1:28:47] because we're you know Jude told us that
[1:28:49] we need to originally we need to contend
[1:28:51] for the original faith that was given to
[1:28:53] the Saints we need that faith that is is
[1:28:56] is lived James chapter 2:1 17 says even
[1:28:59] so faith if it have not works is dead
[1:29:02] being alone amen yeah man may say thou
[1:29:06] has faith and I have Works show me thy
[1:29:08] faith without thy works and I will show
[1:29:10] thee my faith by my Works thou believest
[1:29:13] that there is one God thou doest well
[1:29:15] the Devils believe also and tremble so
[1:29:16] you're on the same level just to say I
[1:29:20] believe what what separates you and the
[1:29:22] devil is your obedience to the word
[1:29:25] that's what separates you but will thou
[1:29:27] know oh vain man that faith without
[1:29:29] works is dead was not Abraham Our Father
[1:29:32] justified by
[1:29:33] works now I know he said when he offered
[1:29:37] Isaac his son on the altar see thou how
[1:29:42] Faith wrought his works and by works his
[1:29:45] faith was made perfect or
[1:29:49] complete we have to complete the walk I
[1:29:51] have finished the course I've kept the
[1:29:53] faith I kept walking in more light all
[1:29:55] the time and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:29:58] which saith Abraham believed God and was
[1:30:00] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:30:02] he was called the friend of God oh what
[1:30:06] a privilege wasn't that brother braham's
[1:30:09] desire to have put on his
[1:30:11] tomb friend of
[1:30:13] God see ye see then how that by works a
[1:30:18] man is Justified and not by just saying
[1:30:21] I believe amen
[1:30:24] all right we kind of want to close on
[1:30:26] this because time is is we just want to
[1:30:29] close on these next four scripture
[1:30:33] readings all right Joshua chapter 1 this
[1:30:36] came to me in prayer this is one of the
[1:30:38] scriptures that just just popped out of
[1:30:40] nowhere in prayer about this message
[1:30:42] today so I just say this was not me I
[1:30:45] just I believe this was like an
[1:30:47] encouragement from the Lord to help
[1:30:50] us Joshua 1:2 says Moses my servant is
[1:30:53] dead and now therefore rise and go over
[1:30:56] this Jordan thou and all this people
[1:30:58] unto the land which I do give to them
[1:31:01] even to the children of Israel every
[1:31:03] place that the soul of your foot shall
[1:31:05] tread upon that have I given you as I
[1:31:08] said unto Moses so if you're going to
[1:31:11] put your foot somewhere you have to take
[1:31:14] the step amen and remember this was not
[1:31:17] them going into the mall with a
[1:31:19] $110,000 check and said buy all the
[1:31:22] things that you want
[1:31:25] right they literally had to fight for
[1:31:27] that step
[1:31:29] amen you want character you got to fight
[1:31:32] for it am you want to have you want to
[1:31:35] have any of these things you got to
[1:31:37] fight for it amen you want more love you
[1:31:40] got to fight for
[1:31:41] it you've got to be able to let somebody
[1:31:44] look you in the eye and be as bad as
[1:31:48] they want to be and be able in your
[1:31:51] heart to love them anyways amen
[1:31:55] and I just say like this God if I don't
[1:31:57] got it put me to the test because I I I
[1:32:01] I want it I want I want to be like him I
[1:32:04] want to be like him he's our husband why
[1:32:08] don't we want to be like our
[1:32:10] husband it's he won't gift it to us
[1:32:13] right so we have to take it we have to
[1:32:16] take it by
[1:32:18] force from the Wilderness look at he's
[1:32:21] saying how big it is from the Wilderness
[1:32:23] and this l on even to the Great River
[1:32:25] the river of fredes all the land of the
[1:32:26] Hittites the great sea toward the going
[1:32:28] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[1:32:32] there shall not be any
[1:32:34] man able to stand before thee all the
[1:32:37] days of their life as I was with Moses
[1:32:38] so I will be with thee I will not fail
[1:32:41] thee nor forsake thee now I want to say
[1:32:44] this in this verse here instead of using
[1:32:47] the word man because it's a type and
[1:32:50] Shadow Old Testament it was a natural
[1:32:52] battle in the new New Testament it's all
[1:32:55] spiritual battle I'm just going to say
[1:32:56] it like this there shall not be any
[1:32:58] Spirit any demon that shall be able to
[1:33:00] stand before thee all the days of th
[1:33:05] life as God was with
[1:33:09] uh William brandom so shall I be with
[1:33:13] you right as as I was with Moses in the
[1:33:16] in the in the mount so I'll send you
[1:33:19] Elijah the
[1:33:22] prophet and I will not fail thee nor
[1:33:25] forsake thee wow I feel I can go through
[1:33:28] the fire if he's with me what I got the
[1:33:33] fear be strong be of good courage For
[1:33:37] unto this people shall thou divide for
[1:33:40] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:33:42] thee their fathers to give them now
[1:33:45] remember this he's speaking to those
[1:33:47] that are left
[1:33:49] over right because many died in the
[1:33:52] wilderness because of their unbelief so
[1:33:55] he's saying to them that are still here
[1:33:58] to this to these people will I divide
[1:34:01] the
[1:34:02] land remember Jesus praying for his
[1:34:05] disciples these are they that stayed
[1:34:06] with me to the end the other 70 left
[1:34:09] there is blessings coming to those who
[1:34:12] stay with the word to the very end
[1:34:16] amen all right verse seven only be thou
[1:34:21] strong and very courageous that thou May
[1:34:24] observe to do according to all the law
[1:34:28] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[1:34:31] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[1:34:33] the left that thou mayest Prosper
[1:34:35] whether soever thou goest this book of
[1:34:37] the law shall not depart out of thy
[1:34:39] mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein
[1:34:41] day and night that thou mayest observe
[1:34:42] to do according to all that is written
[1:34:45] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:34:48] prosperous and thou shalt have good
[1:34:51] success
[1:34:54] notice in this battle he never tells
[1:34:57] them make sure you hold the your Shield
[1:34:59] like this and make sure you got the
[1:35:00] sword like
[1:35:02] this because the battle isn't ours the
[1:35:04] battle is the
[1:35:06] Lord's the Lord is the only one that can
[1:35:09] defeat the Devil I feel sorry for those
[1:35:12] who feel they have they have power over
[1:35:14] the
[1:35:16] devil you don't have power over the
[1:35:21] devil God has given you power
[1:35:24] through Jesus that's
[1:35:28] it and how many times have people wanted
[1:35:30] to use that
[1:35:33] power right I adure Thee in
[1:35:38] uh to in Jesus name according to what
[1:35:41] Paul
[1:35:42] preached how many how many people want
[1:35:45] they want to use that name but see it's
[1:35:47] the life behind the
[1:35:48] name that that's what really makes the
[1:35:50] demons tremble
[1:35:54] and we we got to start exercising what
[1:35:56] what is spoken here we need we need to
[1:35:58] observe what we're hearing when we come
[1:36:00] to church when we read when we do Bible
[1:36:02] studies when we're getting down under
[1:36:03] knes when God speaks to us just one
[1:36:06] thing hold on to it hold on to it be
[1:36:10] faithful to it and I'll say it like
[1:36:14] this be strong to hold on to it be of
[1:36:19] good courage Be not Afraid neither be
[1:36:22] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:36:23] with thee whether soever thou goest and
[1:36:25] Joshua commanded the officers of the
[1:36:27] people saying pass through the host and
[1:36:29] command the people saying prepare vitual
[1:36:32] for within three days he shall pass over
[1:36:34] this Jordan to go to possess the land
[1:36:36] which the Lord your God giveth you to
[1:36:39] possess it wow you talk about an
[1:36:41] encouraging message they needed that for
[1:36:44] the battle that was in front of them
[1:36:46] amen Paul said follow me as I follow
[1:36:49] Christ
[1:36:50] amen I want to follow Christ do you want
[1:36:52] to follow Christ
[1:36:54] all right last scriptures right here 1
[1:36:56] Peter chapter 2: 19 for this is
[1:36:58] thankworthy if a man for conscience
[1:37:01] towards God endure grief suffering
[1:37:06] wrongfully that shows you got patience
[1:37:09] right God is pleased with
[1:37:11] that for what glory is it when you be
[1:37:14] buffeted for your faults you shall take
[1:37:16] it patiently but if when you do well and
[1:37:18] you suffer for it you take it patiently
[1:37:20] this is what is really acceptable with
[1:37:22] God for even her to you were called
[1:37:25] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:37:27] leaving us an example that we should
[1:37:29] what follow his
[1:37:35] steps his
[1:37:40] steps who did no sin neither was guile
[1:37:42] found in his mouth who when he was
[1:37:45] reviled reviled not again when he
[1:37:47] suffered he threatened not but he
[1:37:48] committed himself to the father to him
[1:37:52] that judges righteously
[1:37:55] who his own self bear our sins in his
[1:37:59] own body on the tree well that that that
[1:38:02] just should make us feel indebted right
[1:38:03] right
[1:38:04] there and and Peter's saying that we
[1:38:08] being dead to sin we should live unto
[1:38:12] righteousness we should walk in the
[1:38:14] light we should take these steps we
