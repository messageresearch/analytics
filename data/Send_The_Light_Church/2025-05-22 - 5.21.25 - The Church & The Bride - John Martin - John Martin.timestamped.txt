[0:01] [Music]
[0:02] Lord, I
[0:06] believe.
[0:07] Lord, I
[0:11] believe that all things are possible.
[0:18] Lord, I
[0:21] [Music]
[0:23] [Laughter]
[0:24] [Music]
[0:28] believe.
[0:30] Jesus is
[0:33] here. All things are
[0:39] possible.
[0:42] Jesus is here.
[0:47] Jesus is
[0:50] here.
[0:52] Jesus is
[0:56] here. All things are
[1:00] [Music]
[1:01] possible.
[1:04] Jesus is
[1:08] here. Amen. Let's look to him in a word
[1:11] of prayer now. Lord, we believe that
[1:14] you're here for you promised where just
[1:17] two or three would be gathered together
[1:20] that you would be there in the midst.
[1:21] And we don't doubt that,
[1:24] Lord. Sometimes, Lord, our feelings
[1:27] don't declare it, but our faith does.
[1:31] Lord, we're going to side with your word
[1:33] today. And Lord, we know that you're
[1:36] here to do exceedingly above all that we
[1:38] would ask, all that we would desire. We
[1:42] just pray at this time that you take
[1:44] away any barrier from us being able to
[1:47] receive more of you tonight.
[1:50] Take away any doubts. Take away any
[1:51] fears. Take away any distractions. Take
[1:54] away any um Lord, mishaps of the day, of
[1:58] the past, any anxiety or or thoughts of
[2:02] the future. Lord, we just pray that our
[2:04] whole focus today could be on a word
[2:07] that you would have directly for us.
[2:10] that as your word comes forth, Lord,
[2:12] today that there would be a faith that
[2:14] would rise in our heart to claim the
[2:17] very promises, Lord, that we're looking
[2:19] for in our lives. We ask that you'd be
[2:21] with those that are missing tonight,
[2:23] those that are not here, Lord. We ask
[2:26] that your spirit would go with and be
[2:28] with them in this hour, that you would
[2:30] help them with whatever that they're
[2:32] there's going on in their life. And
[2:34] somehow, Lord, may they be able to
[2:36] receive the word that we know is for
[2:39] each of us. Lord, we pray also that
[2:42] you'd be with those that are in the live
[2:44] stream today, Lord, that are watching
[2:46] online. Your Holy Spirit be with them
[2:49] and bless them in their homes today.
[2:51] Father, we commit the service into you.
[2:53] just ask your blessings now upon the
[2:56] entire service and anoint the word of
[2:59] God to us which we know is already
[3:01] anointed. But we ask Lord that it would
[3:04] be anointed to our hearts aresh today.
[3:07] May it burn within us. We love you. We
[3:09] thank you for these things now. We pray
[3:11] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[3:14] Amen. God bless you. Turn with me if you
[3:16] would for opening scripture in the book
[3:18] of Matthew chapter 24.
[3:23] certainly
[3:24] appreciate our sister playing the
[3:29] flute and and this had been a good good
[3:32] time to have the
[3:34] trumpet or a guitar or a tambourine
[3:40] or Oh, but it would be good if more of
[3:45] us um that have instruments could play
[3:49] them. Amen. Uh I would like to start
[3:52] begin reading at verse uh
[3:57] 20 sorry verse 21. I know that I made
[4:01] mention of 23 but if we could start at
[4:05] 21. Amen. Before you're seated Jesus
[4:08] speaking here of the last days. And he
[4:11] said, "For then shall there be great
[4:13] tribulation such as not since the
[4:16] beginning of the world to this time, no,
[4:19] nor ever shall be. And except those days
[4:23] should be shortened, there should be no
[4:25] flesh saved. But for the
[4:29] elect's sake,
[4:31] those days shall be shortened." Then if
[4:34] any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is
[4:36] Christ or there, believe it not. For
[4:41] there shall arise false Christs and
[4:43] false prophets, and there shall shall
[4:46] show great signs and wonders, in so much
[4:48] if it were possible, they shall deceive
[4:51] the very
[4:52] elect. Behold, I've told you before,
[4:56] wherefore, if they shall say unto you,
[4:58] Behold, he is in the desert, go not
[5:01] forth. Behold, he is in the secret
[5:04] chambers. Believe it not. For as the
[5:08] lightning cometh out of the east, and
[5:09] shineth even unto the west, so shall
[5:12] also the coming of the son of man be.
[5:13] For wheresoever the carcass is, there
[5:16] shall the eagles be gathered together.
[5:20] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[5:24] Well, we notice in this opening
[5:26] scripture here, it's talking about the
[5:29] two spirits in the framework of the
[5:32] church and that they're so close you
[5:35] literally cannot tell them apart.
[5:37] There's only one group of people that
[5:39] really know the difference. It isn't
[5:42] like it's known to everybody.
[5:45] It's only known to one group, and it's
[5:47] the elect. They're the only ones that
[5:50] know the difference between the two the
[5:53] two
[5:55] spirits. The one is a false spirit with
[5:59] the ability to deceive.
[6:02] It is accompanied with great signs and
[6:05] wonders. It is also has a a pompous,
[6:09] arrogant, doineering, self asssurance of
[6:12] where Christ is at.
[6:16] In other words, they feel Christ is so
[6:18] much in them that they have need of
[6:20] nothing. You can hardly tell them
[6:22] anything.
[6:24] And so they they have this thing about
[6:26] them. They know where Christ is at.
[6:28] Christ is here with this group or Christ
[6:32] is over there with that group or is it
[6:33] in Arizona in the
[6:35] desert or Christ is in the secret
[6:38] chamber of our
[6:40] church. Christ is in our special
[6:42] meetings.
[6:44] And you see there the people are drawn
[6:46] to that with signs and wonders and and
[6:49] Jesus said believe it
[6:52] not. Believe it not. And he makes it
[6:56] real comfortable that where the word is
[6:59] being broken, where the carcass is,
[7:01] there will the eagles be gathered
[7:03] together. If there's one thing I learned
[7:05] very young in my
[7:08] uh uh Christian walk is that Christ will
[7:13] meet you
[7:23] anywhere. Uh, Brother Bruce was telling
[7:25] me one time he went to a church and it
[7:27] it was it wasn't a message church, but
[7:30] as sure as anything, God spoke to him
[7:32] there.
[7:33] And see, God has the ability to connect
[7:36] with you wherever you're at.
[7:40] So, we can't put God in a box and say,
[7:42] "God is there. God is there. God is in
[7:43] this group. God is not in that group."
[7:48] The two spirits are so close today.
[7:52] Today, Jesus is speaking of our day.
[7:54] They're so close, if it were possible,
[7:56] that they shall deceive the very elect.
[8:00] But the elect cannot be deceived.
[8:04] Why? Because the elect of God are filled
[8:08] with the spirit of God. There is the
[8:11] difference. Amen. That's the only
[8:15] difference. God can't be deceived.
[8:19] And if you're filled with God, God will
[8:22] see you through.
[8:24] Not saying we're not going to get
[8:25] tripped up and stuff, but
[8:29] uh you're not going to miss it because
[8:31] you have the spirit of God in you. We
[8:34] want to entitle this message the foolish
[8:36] church and the wise
[8:38] bride. The foolish church and the wise
[8:43] bride.
[8:45] is the w the bride is not everybody in
[8:49] the message. It's not everybody that
[8:52] believes that God sent a prophet. It's
[8:53] not everybody that's not in a
[8:55] denomination. It's not everybody that
[8:57] understands serpent seed or agrees with
[8:59] predestination.
[9:02] Every message church has three types of
[9:04] believers in it.
[9:06] Amen. And there is a difference between
[9:10] a
[9:12] bottle being in the ocean and the ocean
[9:15] being in the bottle. So there's many
[9:18] people that are really in the ocean of
[9:21] the message.
[9:23] That have not received the message
[9:25] inside their vessel. Amen.
[9:29] Brother Brandham speaking of Judas a
[9:32] Scariot here in uh the message
[9:37] of what is the name of the message? I
[9:40] will get the name of that message for
[9:42] you at another time because I erased it
[9:44] off my notes here. But I believe it's
[9:47] questions and answers 53. I believe he
[9:50] gave them power against unclean spirits.
[9:53] So, what we're going to be doing today
[9:54] is we're going to be talking about the
[9:56] difference between the church and the
[9:57] bride. There are a lot of people that
[9:59] are in the church that think they have
[10:02] the Holy Ghost.
[10:04] As solid as anything, they think they
[10:07] have the Holy Ghost.
[10:09] And they do not have the Holy Ghost.
[10:13] And this this may be hard for some, but
[10:16] if we if we don't slice it the right
[10:19] way, if we don't rightly divide it the
[10:21] right way, we're going to get
[10:24] deceived. Okay? So, he said he gave them
[10:26] power against unclean spirits and they
[10:28] went out and they cast out devils. Is
[10:30] that right? And they healed the sick. Is
[10:32] that right? And they came back
[10:34] sanctified, rejoicing, jumping,
[10:36] shouting, praising God. Is that right?
[10:38] And they said, "Even the devils are
[10:40] subject to us." Amen. And Jesus said,
[10:42] "Don't you rejoice because the devils is
[10:44] subject to you, but rejoice because your
[10:47] names, your names are written in the
[10:49] book of heaven."
[10:52] Is that right? And Judas a Scariot was
[10:55] with them. One of them called out,
[10:58] sanctified, and his name written in the
[11:00] Lamb's Book of Life. Read Matthew 10 and
[11:04] see if that's not right. He called each
[11:07] one of them, and Judas and every one of
[11:09] them right down there. He sent them out
[11:11] and gave them power against unclean
[11:13] spirits. Now watch. Put on your
[11:16] shockproof
[11:18] vest. When Judas come right up through
[11:22] the church there as the treasure of the
[11:24] church working with the pastor Jesus.
[11:28] But when it come time to Pentecost, he
[11:30] showed his colors.
[11:32] He showed what he was. And with enough
[11:35] decency about him, he destroyed himself
[11:37] and hung himself at a sycamore tree to
[11:39] fulfill the prophecy. And that spirit of
[11:42] Judas will come right on and believe the
[11:45] Lord Jesus Christ. The devils believe
[11:48] and tremble. He quotes, "He'll come
[11:50] right up and teach sanctification just
[11:52] as pure a holy life as can be and put it
[11:58] and and and when it comes to the baptism
[12:00] of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the
[12:01] spirit, he'll deny it. He'll show his
[12:03] colors every time. That's the spirit.
[12:07] Jesus said, "Beware in Matthew 24 again,
[12:10] the two spirits will be so close
[12:12] together that it would deceive the very
[12:16] elect." Is that right? Well, we read it.
[12:18] I'll tell you what I love about this. I
[12:20] It's like the Lord gave me that
[12:22] scripture before I ever came to the
[12:24] quote, but I just love a confir
[12:27] confirmation. So speaking here that the
[12:30] two spirits are in the
[12:32] church. The two spirits that are so
[12:35] close, they're in the church. And I want
[12:38] us to turn here to Matthew chapter 7.
[12:40] This wasn't in our notes either. If we
[12:43] could just turn put that up on the
[12:44] board. Um and if we could. Matthew
[12:47] chapter 7 starting with verse number 23.
[12:51] just showing again
[12:54] the how God can use somebody and they're
[12:58] really not in in the
[13:00] bride. And and here he's Jesus speaking
[13:04] in verse 21 of Matthew chapter 7, not
[13:06] everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
[13:08] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
[13:09] but he that doeth the will of my father
[13:11] which is in heaven. Now the Holy Ghost
[13:14] is what causes us to do his will. That
[13:16] is right.
[13:18] And many will say to me in that day,
[13:20] Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[13:23] your name? And in thy name cast out
[13:24] devils, and thy name done many wonderful
[13:26] works. And then while I profess unto
[13:28] them, I never knew you. Depart from me,
[13:30] ye that work iniquity. So at this time,
[13:33] God is not accepting this group here to
[13:37] come into a rapture and to be his
[13:40] bride. He's he's saying, "No, I I'm not
[13:43] marrying you. I don't know you.
[13:46] Um, and they're saying, "Well, wait a
[13:48] minute. You don't know me. Yeah, yeah,
[13:50] you use me to cast out devils. I saw it
[13:53] happen." And and and literally I
[13:56] prophesied and it came to pass. In fact,
[13:59] I got a whole list of many wonderful
[14:01] works I did for you. And what are you
[14:04] trying to say? You don't know me.
[14:07] So, it's a a strong
[14:11] indication that we can be used of God
[14:15] and not have the Holy Ghost.
[14:20] All right, let's go to Matthew chapter
[14:22] 25 now and talk about the 10 virgins
[14:26] here. As most of us know the story, but
[14:29] I got some quotes on this. This is going
[14:30] to be a teaching between the church and
[14:34] the bride. They're two different people.
[14:36] Now, here's one thing that we got to
[14:37] watch for when we're listening to the
[14:39] tapes and we're reading the books.
[14:41] Brother Brandham interchangeably uses
[14:43] the church for the bride as well as the
[14:46] church is not the bride. He does. He
[14:49] uses it interchangeably. And you need to
[14:51] be careful every time you're you when
[14:53] you read the word church or you hear the
[14:55] hear him say the word church. Sometimes
[14:57] he means the church and sometimes he
[14:59] does not mean the church but he means
[15:01] the bride. Yes.
[15:03] So, Matthew 25:1, then shall the kingdom
[15:06] of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins
[15:08] which took their lamps and went forth to
[15:10] meet the
[15:15] bridegroom. Okay? And five of them were
[15:18] wise and five were foolish. They that
[15:21] were foolish took their lamps and took
[15:24] no oil with them. We understand that the
[15:28] oil represents the Holy Ghost. Amen. So
[15:33] there's a group of church members that
[15:36] did not take the Holy Ghost with
[15:38] them. But these are special group
[15:43] because they lived a sanctified
[15:47] life. Brother Brandon said, we'll read
[15:49] the quote if we got time. Brother
[15:50] Brandon says they are
[15:52] saved, but they're not in the bride.
[15:55] So you can live a sanctified life, can't
[15:57] hardly tell the
[15:59] difference and not have the Holy
[16:02] Ghost. Another thing I want to say to
[16:04] you, brother Brandon said justification
[16:06] is a is a work of the Holy Ghost and
[16:10] sanctification is a work of the Holy
[16:12] Ghost. So it takes you got a portion of
[16:15] Holy Ghost when you repent, receive
[16:17] Christ as your savior
[16:19] and then obviously to go on to live a
[16:21] life of sanctification.
[16:23] Well, that is the Holy Ghost in you
[16:26] living a sanctified life, but you still
[16:29] don't have the Holy Ghost.
[16:32] You don't have the Holy Ghost. Now,
[16:34] that's the hardest thing I think it is
[16:36] to accept
[16:38] because people want to say, "I've got
[16:40] the Holy Ghost. I've got the Holy
[16:42] Ghost." And it's foolish. God is calling
[16:46] that group of people who's sanctified,
[16:49] who's living clean lives as absolutely
[16:54] foolish. And I am making them I'm typing
[16:58] them as the church. This is the
[17:01] church. This I'm going to call it the
[17:04] foolish church. It is not the wise
[17:07] bride. It is the foolish church. Are you
[17:10] with me? Okay. But the wise, they took
[17:13] oil in their vessel with their lamps.
[17:15] And the bridegroom carried it, and they
[17:16] all slumbered and slept. And at midnight
[17:18] they heard the cry, "Behold, the
[17:19] bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet
[17:21] him."
[17:23] Then all those
[17:25] virgins trimmed their lamps and the
[17:28] foolish said unto the wise. Notice the
[17:32] church member went on and and tried
[17:36] going to another church
[17:38] member to get what only God can give.
[17:44] And this is this is sad because I know
[17:46] this of assuredly. God calls everybody
[17:50] to come and get more Holy Ghost all the
[17:52] time. That's right. But they don't want
[17:54] to.
[17:56] They they the the de devil tricks them.
[18:01] But the wise answer is saying, "Not
[18:02] soul. If I give you what I have, there's
[18:06] not going to be enough for me. In fact,
[18:08] you need to go to the person that
[18:10] actually gives it out and buy for
[18:12] yourself." So, I like that because a
[18:15] real servant of God is going to point
[18:17] you to Jesus Christ, sir. because he's
[18:19] the only one that can give you what you
[18:22] need to become his bride.
[18:25] And I'll tell you, it isn't what you
[18:27] know of the message. It ain't going to
[18:29] make you bride. What's going to make you
[18:32] bride is you being filled with the
[18:34] bridegroom.
[18:37] Same spirit, bone of his bone, spirit of
[18:38] his spirit. Get filled with the Holy
[18:41] Ghost. And that makes you bride by one
[18:43] spirit. We're all baptized into one
[18:45] body. But you've got to receive the
[18:48] fullness of the Holy
[18:49] Ghost. And while they went to buy, the
[18:52] bridegroom came, and they that were
[18:54] ready went in with him to the marriage,
[18:56] and the door was just shut. Afterwards
[18:59] came also the the foolish virgins here,
[19:03] the other virgins that did not go
[19:06] in outside the door knocking. Lord,
[19:10] Lord, open to us.
[19:13] Notice they were spiritual enough to
[19:17] call Jesus Lord because they sung the
[19:19] song in church, right? He is Lord. But
[19:22] they truly didn't make him Lord.
[19:26] They
[19:27] didn't because who made them Lord was
[19:30] the ones that went into the marriage.
[19:35] These they should have said Savior,
[19:37] Savior. Right? Not all that say Lord,
[19:40] Lord unto me shall enter into the
[19:42] kingdom, but he that doeth the
[19:46] will. But he answered and said, "Verily
[19:49] I say unto you, I know you
[19:52] not. Watch therefore, for you know
[19:55] neither the day nor the hour when the
[19:58] Son of Man
[20:00] cometh." So the foolish virgins, they
[20:03] represent the church who goes through
[20:06] tribulation.
[20:08] The wise virgin represents the bride who
[20:11] goes into the rapture before the
[20:15] tribulation
[20:18] period. Now we know the difference
[20:20] between the foolish virgin, the wise
[20:21] virgin. It was the oil which is the Holy
[20:25] Ghost. And so the difference between the
[20:27] church member and the bride is no
[20:30] different than one's got the Holy Ghost
[20:32] and the other doesn't.
[20:36] And they may
[20:38] be
[20:39] justified and not
[20:41] sanctified and they may be sanctified
[20:45] and justified but they don't have the
[20:47] Holy
[20:51] Ghost. The church I'll say it like this.
[20:55] The church does not have the Holy
[20:57] Ghost. That's that is so shocking.
[21:01] That's a that's a real eyeopener. The
[21:04] church does not have the Holy Ghost.
[21:09] They can be justified and sanctified but
[21:11] not have the Holy
[21:13] Ghost. Justification,
[21:16] sanctification, all these casting out
[21:19] devils and you know praying for people
[21:21] and seeing things happen. Uh this is
[21:24] just honestly without going on to
[21:27] receive the Holy Ghost. God looks at
[21:29] that and says that's foolish.
[21:32] That is a foolish church member.
[21:35] foolish church
[21:36] member. The church is lacking the Holy
[21:40] Ghost, but the but the the wise virgin,
[21:44] she has the Holy Ghost. And to me, this
[21:47] is the most striking thing about this
[21:51] message. Whereas the bride is either has
[21:54] the Holy Ghost or she's in the process
[21:57] of getting it. It's one or the other.
[22:02] Brother Brandham, as I made mention,
[22:04] interchanges the word
[22:06] church for bride. And you just can't
[22:10] think he means one or the other. You've
[22:12] got to catch what he's saying
[22:15] by by catching what he's
[22:18] saying. You okay? Can I want to continue
[22:21] on this questions and
[22:23] answers on uh it's questions and answers
[22:26] on Genesis is actually what it is. some
[22:28] quotes again on the difference between
[22:30] the foolish virgin and the wise virgin.
[22:32] And brother Brandon uh goes on to say,
[22:34] "Now watch quite a few quotes today.
[22:37] What the tri when tribulation strikes,
[22:39] he says the church goes up." Now
[22:42] remember just an
[22:45] ordinary church without the Holy Ghost
[22:48] goes through tribulation. See, now he's
[22:50] he's he's he's telling them the church
[22:53] both ways.
[22:55] It's only the elect that goes goes
[22:59] through. All right. It's the bride. Now,
[23:02] the remnant was left.
[23:05] Now, when a woman goes to cut out a
[23:07] pattern for her skirt, you talk about
[23:09] it. She lays the goods out. Is that
[23:11] right? The piece of goods. And she lays
[23:14] her pattern down on this.
[23:18] Now I've seen uh many times you just you
[23:22] pin the
[23:23] pattern on this material and she does
[23:27] the
[23:28] fixing the pattern is to be cut. So she
[23:32] does the fixing where the pattern is to
[23:34] be cut. Oh brother, this really do you
[23:38] good. This really do you good? He says
[23:41] who does the
[23:42] electing? God does. Just like the woman
[23:45] who lays the the pattern out. She does
[23:47] the electing where she wants the
[23:49] shoulder to go, where the sleeve to go,
[23:51] where the side to go. She lays it out.
[23:53] She's the one that determines where it
[23:55] wants to go. God is the one that does
[23:56] the electing. Who he chooses to be
[23:58] bride. God does the electing. Is that
[24:01] right? It's not me to say. It's him to
[24:04] say, and he places the pattern over who
[24:08] he will.
[24:11] Now he says, what is a virgin? Virgin
[24:13] means pure. It means holy. Is that
[24:16] right? What is a virgin girl? It's a
[24:19] virgin who's ever been touched. She's a
[24:21] virgin. What is anything that's pure
[24:24] like a virgin like olive oil? It means
[24:26] it's been distilled until it's
[24:29] virginity. It's pure. It's it's it's a
[24:32] virgin gold. It's with all the dross
[24:35] went through the heat and everything's
[24:37] boiled out of the draws. It's is that
[24:39] right? All of it. All the iron, all the
[24:41] pyite, and everything else is just
[24:43] boiled out in its it's in its virginity.
[24:47] Now, there's where the 10 went to meet
[24:50] the bridegroom, Jesus said. That's
[24:52] right. How many agree with that? Say,
[24:54] "Amen." Congregation says, "Amen." Amen.
[24:58] Love doing that. 10 went to meet him.
[25:01] Now, watch. All of them were
[25:08] holy. Well, in order to be
[25:11] holy, they had to be
[25:15] sanctified. That's cuz that's the only
[25:18] cleansing, the holy stream that God has
[25:20] is sanctification. Is that right? Now,
[25:22] watch. Of the 10 that were sanctified,
[25:25] five didn't have oil in their lamp.
[25:29] And five had oil in their lamp. Is that
[25:33] right? And what does oil
[25:34] represent now? Not the purity or the
[25:39] virginity. That's not what the oil
[25:42] represents. The oil represents the Holy
[25:45] Spirit. Amen. Wow. So, it's not about
[25:49] well, us women shouldn't cut our hair.
[25:53] Our men should cut our
[25:55] hair. Uh we should uh you know, not wear
[25:59] shorts. We should we should uh you know,
[26:01] be decent. We should live decent lives.
[26:03] we should look at the the the decent
[26:06] things. It's not just
[26:09] that. That's just living clean
[26:13] lives. Now, it's important to do that,
[26:16] but just because we do do that doesn't
[26:18] mean we've got the Holy Ghost.
[26:21] It's Yes, it is hard. But here's the
[26:24] thing. We got the devil telling us all
[26:26] the time we got the Holy Ghost. Tells
[26:29] the church all the time we got the Holy
[26:31] Ghost.
[26:33] And I'm going to tell you, you tell a
[26:34] man that's got the Holy Ghost, you know
[26:35] what he's going to do? I need more Holy
[26:38] Ghost.
[26:40] But you tell someone that don't got the
[26:41] Holy Ghost they got the Holy Ghost. You
[26:43] know what they're going to do?
[26:47] Feel
[26:48] comfortable, you know. So, it's it's an
[26:51] important message. 10 of them were
[26:54] virgins. Five was wise, had oil in their
[26:57] lamps. The other five was just as pure
[26:59] and holy, but they had no oil. They were
[27:03] sanctified, Brother Bam says, without
[27:06] the Holy Ghost. Made it real clear right
[27:09] there. But you can be justified without
[27:11] being sanctified. And you can be
[27:12] sanctified without having the Holy
[27:14] Ghost. You can be clean, live pure
[27:16] lives. You can have a form of godliness
[27:18] and deny the power thereof, speaking in
[27:20] tongues and great gifts of God. And
[27:22] every one of them is in there. He said,
[27:25] "There's your five wise virgins who had
[27:28] oil in their lamps, rapturing faith." He
[27:30] says, "Believing in all the signs and
[27:32] wonders and prophecies and everything,
[27:34] and these five cut out of the remnant
[27:38] were taken away," he
[27:41] said. Beautiful. That's the
[27:44] bride. And the rest of them were still
[27:50] virgins and will not be
[27:54] lost, but will go through the
[27:56] tribulation period.
[28:00] And they said, "Give us of your oil. We
[28:04] want the Holy Ghost
[28:07] now." And they said, "Go buy from him
[28:10] who s to you." And they went to pray
[28:13] through then because that's what you
[28:16] have to do. If you want something from
[28:17] God, you got to start praying. And they
[28:20] went to try to pray through then to
[28:23] receive the Holy Ghost. But the Gentile
[28:26] dispensation had been finished. and the
[28:29] persecution arose. And he said they were
[28:32] cast into outer darkness. There will be
[28:35] weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth
[28:39] representing the
[28:41] tribulation. But in the second
[28:44] resurrection, there will be sheep that
[28:47] will be separated from the goats, but
[28:50] never the bride, never the
[28:54] elect. What is the remnant? That's the
[28:58] piece that's left over. Same kind of
[29:00] goods. Is that right? You can go and cut
[29:02] a dress out of calico and spread it out.
[29:05] A big piece of calico and cut it out.
[29:08] It's your business where you want to lay
[29:10] the pattern. And it's God's business
[29:12] where he wants to lay the pattern. Amen.
[29:14] He cuts her out, right? Is that right?
[29:17] And now this the rest of the cal um
[29:22] calico left there. I'm not sure what
[29:24] calico is. One day I'm going to learn
[29:26] what that is. It was I'm sure it's
[29:28] something some kind of
[29:30] material. Could be plaid. It could be a
[29:32] lot of different
[29:36] materials. Is just as good as the calico
[29:39] in the dress. Let me read that. And now
[29:40] this the rest of the calico left is just
[29:42] as good as the calico in the dress. Is
[29:44] that right? But God's the election. But
[29:46] it's God's election. And the remnant is
[29:49] left to go through the tribulation
[29:51] period. The elect will go up. The
[29:53] remnant will be left here to go through
[29:55] tribulation period and all the end time
[29:59] and all the end of the time when they
[30:02] shall see what's happened they'll go
[30:06] down in mardom. So they'll have to give
[30:09] their lives right. They'll have to give
[30:12] their
[30:13] lives. It's like this you know Jesus
[30:15] says I gave my life for you. You accept
[30:19] that you get filled with him. then you
[30:23] don't give your life. You reject his
[30:26] Holy Spirit. See, you reject my life,
[30:28] then you give yours.
[30:30] It's it's it's as simple as
[30:32] that. Then look, you say, "Well, now,
[30:35] Brother Brandon, do you mean to tell me
[30:36] that there's going to be a people that's
[30:38] going to be there at the white throne
[30:39] judgment?" He said, "The bride will
[30:42] never be judged." No, sir. She's Christ.
[30:47] How do you know? How do you get into
[30:48] Christ? By one spirit, you're baptized
[30:50] into one body. Is that right? Now, look
[30:52] here. The Bible says judgment was set,
[30:54] the books were open. Is that right? The
[30:55] book of
[30:56] sinners. And another book was open,
[30:59] which is the book of life. And every man
[31:00] was judged out of thus. Is that right?
[31:03] And who's doing the judging? Jesus. And
[31:05] the saints. He said he came to minister.
[31:08] Who is it? Who is our ancient of days
[31:11] whose hair is like wool? We said, "And
[31:12] 10,000 time 10,000 with him and
[31:15] ministered to him in the judgment."
[31:17] Here's Jesus returns as king and queen.
[31:22] The wedding's over and he's married.
[31:25] Here's the king and queen standing there
[31:27] and there uh stands that sanctified
[31:30] bunch. God said, "Stand to my right side
[31:33] here." And that's the books were open
[31:36] with sinners. Get over here to my left.
[31:38] Here's the ones that had their names
[31:40] written in the book of life. Here's the
[31:42] ones that had their names written in the
[31:45] Lamb's book of life. Brother Brandham
[31:47] said, "My name is written in there." And
[31:49] he said, "Brother Van, my name's written
[31:51] in there. I'll go." He said, "Wait a
[31:53] minute. Judas's Scariot was sanctified."
[31:56] Woo, brother. You better wake up and
[31:59] pinch so you can get it. That's what he
[32:04] said. He said Judas's Scariot's name was
[32:07] in the in the in the book of life as
[32:10] well. And his name was taken out.
[32:16] So Jesus said, you know, rejoice that
[32:19] your names are written in the book of
[32:23] life. I I'll say it like this. We ought
[32:26] to rejoice that our name is not going to
[32:27] be taken out of the book of life, right?
[32:30] Let's take it a step further. Let's
[32:32] let's keep pressing on.
[32:35] You know, there's one way to assure
[32:37] confidence is that you're always
[32:39] pressing on for more of God. where the
[32:42] church member is always fighting this
[32:44] spirit
[32:46] of I got other things I got going.
[32:53] It's a relaxed state. It's a state of
[32:56] there's no emergency to get the Holy
[32:59] Ghost. No emergency to get it. I don't
[33:02] have to go into emergency. I'll just see
[33:05] my regular doctor when I can get an
[33:07] appointment. And you know, right now,
[33:09] you know, it's running a long time and I
[33:11] don't feel like, you know, really
[33:12] seeking God now. I'll probably just, you
[33:14] know, work on it next month. Next month
[33:16] comes and you, you know, by the time you
[33:18] get down and you're still not hearing
[33:20] from him and you just want to wait
[33:21] another month, but you need to get into
[33:23] the emergency. You need to get, brother
[33:25] says, you need to get desperate. That's
[33:27] right. Think about how many times the
[33:30] foolish virgins came to church and heard
[33:32] God woo them. Come receive more Holy
[33:35] Ghost.
[33:38] many
[33:40] times and that church member church
[33:43] members just sat there and did not heed
[33:46] the
[33:49] wooing. Just come to the altar, get into
[33:52] the prayer rooms, humble yourself, make
[33:55] the consecration, rededicate yourself,
[33:57] press in, seek me, set your affections
[34:00] on things above, take it by force, draw
[34:03] nigh unto me. All these woos, God's
[34:06] drawing you to receive more of him.
[34:08] Because if you draw nigh to God, he'll
[34:10] draw nigh to you. You seek, you shall
[34:12] find. You knock, it shall be answered.
[34:14] You knock, the door shall be open. God
[34:16] promised it. But if we don't do our
[34:18] part,
[34:23] Jesus said, "Ask and it shall be uh ask
[34:26] and it shall be given you. Seek and you
[34:27] shall find." Acts Luke uh I'm Acts Luke.
[34:31] What is that? It's Luke, no Acts. Luke's
[34:37] 119. Luke, no
[34:43] f all over. Luke 11:9. Ask and it shall
[34:48] be given you. Seek and you shall find.
[34:52] Knock and it shall be open unto you. For
[34:54] everyone that askketh receiveth, and he
[34:57] that seeketh findeth, and to him that
[34:59] knockketh it shall be open. How many
[35:00] people have rightly tried to seek the
[35:02] Holy Ghost, didn't get it, and say, "You
[35:03] know what? I sought it. I knocked. I
[35:05] asked, and I didn't get it." But I'm
[35:07] going to tell you what, they didn't ask,
[35:08] seek, and knock the way Jesus said.
[35:13] Because God's word don't lie. For
[35:15] everyone that askketh receive it, and he
[35:17] that seeketh findeth, and him that knock
[35:19] it shall be opened. And then he says in
[35:22] verse number
[35:23] 13, "If ye then being
[35:27] evil, know how to give good gifts unto
[35:31] your children, how much more shall your
[35:34] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[35:37] them that ask him." Now, this is the
[35:40] only way to become bride. But you know
[35:44] there's a spirit in this
[35:49] message. There is a spirit in this
[35:51] message that says as long as you're in
[35:53] the message you're bride.
[36:02] There's there's spirits in this
[36:04] message that if you're not having a hoop
[36:07] hollering service, you don't have a a a
[36:10] dynamic prayer line, something's wrong.
[36:15] Then you got a group in the message that
[36:17] says, "Oh, we're way beyond that
[36:18] Pentecostal stuff." You know, it's the
[36:20] it's just the receiving of the word and
[36:22] that's all you got to do. You got so
[36:25] many spirits inside the message.
[36:34] And I'm going to tell you the answer is
[36:35] just get God living inside of you.
[36:40] And when you think you got God living
[36:41] inside you, the way that brother
[36:42] Brandham put it, he says, "Seek him some
[36:45] more. Get some more." And when you think
[36:47] you got it, seek some more and stay
[36:50] there longer and get more. He was always
[36:52] a promoter for more Holy Ghost.
[37:00] Because the spirit, you understand our
[37:02] cockaburn nature is always resisting
[37:06] dying out, right? Resisting the Holy
[37:09] Ghost because the Holy Ghost requires
[37:10] that. Acts 7:51, ye stiff neck,
[37:13] uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do
[37:15] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[37:17] fathers did. Now notice these were uh
[37:19] people who lived for God. They went to
[37:22] church. They were
[37:24] religious and and you they they they
[37:27] paid their their their tithes. They they
[37:29] they they fasted twice a week. They did
[37:32] all those things, but they
[37:35] resist God taking control of their
[37:39] life. So, think about how many times the
[37:41] foolish virgins came to church and heard
[37:44] a different voice speaking to
[37:49] them. You already have the Holy Ghost.
[37:51] You're fine.
[37:53] You'll be
[37:55] okay. Not today. Maybe next
[38:01] time. What will people think if you come
[38:03] up to the altar?
[38:07] Well, you're doing better than so and
[38:08] so. Don't worry about it. Or you know,
[38:12] you agree with the message. You're not
[38:14] saying anything against the message. So,
[38:16] all these thoughts and spirits, they
[38:18] come and they speak to people. What are
[38:20] they doing? They're trying to diffuse
[38:23] people from seeking more Holy Ghost. The
[38:26] best way to ever uh get somebody to not
[38:29] seek the Holy Ghost is convince them
[38:30] they already have it.
[38:32] Why do I need to seek the Holy Ghost if
[38:35] I already got it?
[38:37] And it just devil says, "Great, I don't
[38:41] have to worry about
[38:43] him." John 10:3. John chapter 10:3. To
[38:49] him the porter openeth and the sheep
[38:51] hear his
[38:52] voice and he call his
[38:55] own by name and leadth them out. So you
[38:59] know that's why we can you know brother
[39:01] Brandham taught us that God deals with
[39:03] the Gentiles as individuals. So you may
[39:05] be the only one in the
[39:08] city. Think about that. The only one in
[39:11] your
[39:12] city not just your home. Not just the
[39:17] church, but the city and he calls you by
[39:21] name. That's why you can sit in church,
[39:24] you can hear some God speak to you, and
[39:26] you know it's God speaking to you. So he
[39:30] speaks to his own by name, and he leadth
[39:32] them out. And when he puteth forth his
[39:34] own sheep, he goeth before them, and the
[39:37] sheep follow him, for they know his
[39:39] voice. So I look at this as no different
[39:42] than the pillar of fire and the the
[39:45] pillar of cloud that led the children of
[39:47] Israel. Remember they led them out of
[39:50] Egypt. And then soon as the army started
[39:53] coming, they went behind them and
[39:55] protected them. So it was God was in
[39:59] front of them leading and God was behind
[40:01] them protecting them. Amen. And here's
[40:03] Jesus. He's calling them
[40:05] out. And then and then what does it say?
[40:08] He putteth forth his own sheep and he
[40:10] goeth before them and the sheep follow
[40:12] for they know his voice. So he's calling
[40:15] them out. He leads them out. Come out.
[40:17] And then he goes before them and he he
[40:20] protects them at the same time. And he
[40:23] makes this statement that the sheep
[40:25] follow him for they know his voice. So
[40:28] we've got to know the voice of God.
[40:32] And and it can't be this thing. It can't
[40:35] be this thing that we hear in our minds.
[40:38] I don't know how many times we hear
[40:40] voices in our mind and it and it it
[40:43] wants to uh manipulate us, right? I
[40:47] mean, have you ever heard a voice, you
[40:49] don't need to pray today, you'll be
[40:50] fine? You ever heard that one? That's a
[40:53] real voice. And you know, when you got a
[40:56] lot going on, you can reason with it.
[41:00] you can agree with it or you're
[41:03] tired or you just had a hard
[41:07] day. I I'm I'm just going to say that
[41:09] you can't think, you can't rely on the
[41:13] voices that come into your head. That's
[41:15] not the voice that he's talking about.
[41:17] God does not expect you to discern
[41:21] uh uh thoughts that are coming in to
[41:24] your head if you don't use the word
[41:28] because this is the true voice of God.
[41:32] Now, this voice can come into your head.
[41:34] And it does,
[41:37] but you don't not read the word, stay in
[41:40] the word, and just only listen to
[41:43] certain thoughts and try to, well, I'm
[41:46] pretty good at this. I can kind of
[41:47] figure it out because these thoughts
[41:50] will make they are the ones that keep
[41:52] you sitting down seeking the Holy Ghost.
[41:56] These are the ones that are telling you
[41:57] you got the Holy Ghost when you don't
[41:59] got it. instead of searching the
[42:03] scriptures, searching the message. You
[42:05] know, Brother Bam's telling us you can't
[42:07] just rely on God using your using your
[42:10] gifts and using you to do things and
[42:12] that that's an indication that you got
[42:14] the Holy Ghost. It is not right.
[42:18] Many will come to me in that day.
[42:22] It's be
[42:23] better if we say
[42:26] God do I need more of you? Yes.
[42:31] Do I need more of you, Lord? I want to
[42:33] be sure.
[42:35] Because I, you know, the thing is, I
[42:37] don't think the Holy Ghost ever
[42:38] uncchristianizes anybody.
[42:40] I don't think it does that. Because
[42:43] here's the thing. If you're so full of
[42:45] God, it don't matter what is spoken to
[42:47] you. You are not going to be moved and
[42:50] you're not going to be offended.
[42:53] Great peace have they that love my law,
[42:55] and nothing shall offend them. I'm
[42:57] sorry. I I
[43:00] Brother Brano often rededicated his
[43:03] life. Was it wrong the first time? Did
[43:07] he mess up the first time?
[43:10] There's just something about the wife of
[43:14] God that wants to make sure that she's
[43:18] pleasing
[43:20] him. And there's something about the
[43:23] church of God where they're just in need
[43:26] of nothing. Yeah.
[43:30] God says they're foolish. They're blind.
[43:33] They're they think they're in Well,
[43:36] here's the thing. It's pretty obvious
[43:38] that there's inside the the framework of
[43:42] the message. There is a group of people
[43:46] who are satisfied with being saved.
[43:50] They're satisfied with that. As long as
[43:53] I'm saved, I'll be fine. And then
[43:56] there's a group of people who really
[43:58] want to be his wife. Yes.
[44:01] And that group is willing to give more
[44:04] of their life to be his wife.
[44:08] And I'll say it like this, brother. God
[44:11] had put the pattern on you. He chose you
[44:16] and he put something inside of you. You
[44:19] You cannot deny who you are with him.
[44:23] You you it don't matter how many times
[44:25] somebody called you a church member. You
[44:27] know your
[44:29] bride. And and it don't matter how many
[44:33] times somebody said your bride, your
[44:35] bride, your bride, your bride, you're
[44:36] predestined, you still know that you got
[44:38] to press in to be his wife. Just
[44:41] nothing. If you if you you're you're his
[44:44] spirit inside of you is bearing witness
[44:47] and you're following through because the
[44:50] spirit is leading you, right? He go up
[44:53] before them, my sheep, and and the sheep
[44:55] follow him. So, they're obviously the
[44:58] the the shepherd is leading them
[45:01] somewhere. I mean, you can't even hardly
[45:03] get people to be faithful to come to
[45:05] church. And and the word the word, the
[45:08] voice of the word says all the more as
[45:10] you see the day approaching.
[45:15] I figured
[45:18] if if Brother Bruce can drive all this
[45:21] way to come to church, I should be able
[45:22] to come to church. That's the way I look
[45:25] at it.
[45:32] You know, there's people that will drive
[45:33] hours to go to church. There's people
[45:36] minutes away that won't.
[45:39] And you know what kind of sacrifice you
[45:41] got to make to drive hours?
[45:43] All over the world. All over the world.
[45:46] This is happening.
[45:51] Verse five. And a stranger will they not
[45:54] follow, but will flee from him, for they
[45:57] know not the voice of
[46:00] strangers. That's why it's important to
[46:03] stay with the word. Amen. All right.
[46:07] The
[46:09] church was the children of Israel that
[46:11] came out of Egypt. Exodus chapter 23.
[46:15] We're going to we're not going to
[46:16] obviously just so you know ahead of time
[46:18] when I first start. We're never going to
[46:19] go through all the notes. This just
[46:20] doesn't happen. I don't know why it is
[46:22] like that, but we'll just get what we
[46:24] can and trust God for the rest of it.
[46:26] Exodus 23. And it came to pass in the
[46:29] process of time that the king of Egypt
[46:31] died and the children of Israel sighed
[46:32] by reason of bondage and they cried and
[46:34] their cry came up unto God by the reason
[46:37] of bondage. And God heard their
[46:39] groanings and God remembered his
[46:40] covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[46:43] So he's remembering his covenant he made
[46:45] with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And God
[46:48] looked upon the children of Israel, and
[46:50] God had respect unto
[46:54] them. Exodus 3:7. And the Lord said unto
[46:58] Moses, I have surely seen the affliction
[47:00] of my people which are in Egypt, and
[47:03] have heard their cry by reason of their
[47:05] tasks. For I know their sorrows, and I
[47:08] come and I am come down to deliver them
[47:10] out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to
[47:13] bring them up out of the land, unto a
[47:16] good land, a and a large unto a land
[47:19] flown with milk and honey, and unto the
[47:22] place the Canaanites, Hittites,
[47:23] Amorites, Pez, Pezites, Hivites, and
[47:26] Jebusites. Okay? So, I've come down to
[47:30] deliver them and to take them somewhere.
[47:32] And it's not two different sentences.
[47:35] all one sentence. I'm not just gonna
[47:37] bring him out of Egypt, but I'm gonna
[47:39] take him into a better land. And by the
[47:41] way, that land is possessed by other
[47:44] demons right
[47:45] now. Now, remember, as they uh on their
[47:49] journey to the promised land, they were
[47:52] tested. And instead of being extremely
[47:55] thankful that God had brought them out
[47:57] of Egypt, every test they went through,
[47:59] there was some sort of murmuring, some
[48:01] sort of complaining. I think G said that
[48:03] 10 times. He he tested them, proved them
[48:06] to see if they would follow him with
[48:08] their heart, right? They did with their
[48:11] body, but their heart was back in Egypt.
[48:13] We know that Jude 1:5 says, "And I will
[48:16] therefore put you in remembrance of
[48:18] those people. Though ye once knew this,
[48:20] how that the Lord, having saved the
[48:22] people out of the land of Egypt,
[48:24] afterwards, destroyed them that believe
[48:26] not." So I think God can take his names
[48:28] out of the book of life.
[48:31] He saved them, but they did not choose
[48:35] to follow him. They were just going
[48:37] along for the ride to get out of their
[48:39] Egypt. You know, because life would be
[48:41] so much easier if somebody else was
[48:43] doing it for him.
[48:48] Jesus said, "Your fathers did eat men in
[48:50] the wilderness and are dead." Brother
[48:53] Brandham said that means eternally
[48:55] lost. Can you say amen to that? Here's
[48:58] what he said.
[49:00] But there was an elect within the church
[49:04] that God did not
[49:06] destroy. There was an elect group. So
[49:08] there was an elect inside that church
[49:11] and that was Joshua and
[49:14] Caleb. Numbers 32:10. And the Lord's
[49:17] anger was kindled at the same time. And
[49:19] he swears, saying, Surely none of the
[49:22] men that came up out of Egypt from 20
[49:25] years old and
[49:27] upward shall see the land which I swear
[49:30] unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because
[49:33] they have not what? Wholly followed me.
[49:41] In other words, that group of people,
[49:43] many will come to me in that day and
[49:44] say, 'Lord, Lord, did not we prophesy in
[49:46] thy name do many wonderful works and and
[49:48] and cast out devils. That group, that
[49:51] group there, there's a group there in
[49:53] the church that did not wholly follow. I
[49:56] mean, there are some people, they don't
[49:58] mind doing something for God if they're
[50:01] going to get recognition.
[50:04] Look at me, you know, I'm going to do
[50:07] this. But try getting them to do
[50:09] something that nobody knows about. No
[50:13] recognition, nothing. No glory. Bang
[50:16] glory. You know what? I don't feel
[50:18] allowed to do that.
[50:26] The majority of the people don't wholly
[50:28] follow the Lord. They they
[50:31] don't. Verse number 12. save Caleb the
[50:35] son of
[50:37] Junifth Juanith the Kzanite and Joshua
[50:42] the son of Nun for they have wholly
[50:45] followed the Lord and I think that's the
[50:47] difference when you get the Holy Ghost
[50:50] you've done well made a decision to
[50:52] wholly follow the Lord because it takes
[50:53] a dying out and God don't press it in
[50:56] you've got to want it you've got to want
[50:58] it you got to want it enough to put
[51:00] everything else aside to wholly follow
[51:03] the Lord
[51:04] Lord, these were the elect of God over
[51:07] 20 years old that came out of the world
[51:10] and truly walked with God. Verse 13, and
[51:12] the Lord's anger was kindled against
[51:15] Israel, and he made them wonder in the
[51:17] wilderness 40 years until all that
[51:20] generation had done evil in his the
[51:23] sight of the Lord was consumed. So for
[51:26] every year, for every day, I'm sorry,
[51:30] for every day that they spied out the
[51:34] land and saw that it was good because
[51:36] they could not deny that the land was
[51:38] good. That was the only part of the
[51:40] message that they agreed
[51:42] upon. It is a good land. It is flowing
[51:46] with milk and honey. Look at these
[51:48] grapes.
[51:52] But because they didn't believe that the
[51:55] God that brought them out of Egypt and
[51:56] killed the greatest power that was on
[51:59] the planet
[52:00] was able to take care of these other
[52:02] giants.
[52:04] They had to suffer one whole year for
[52:06] every day they spied out the land.
[52:09] It's true. That's why they wandered in
[52:10] the in in the wilderness for so
[52:14] long. Joshua and Caleb were the elected.
[52:18] But notice their attitude was different
[52:21] also in church. When they came to
[52:23] church, their attitude was
[52:26] different. I'll say it like this. It was
[52:28] an elected attitude,
[52:31] a pleasing attitude. And we know without
[52:34] faith, you can't even please God.
[52:39] But the others who spied out the land,
[52:42] their attitude was
[52:44] negative. It was in church. It was
[52:46] negative. doubtful, harm, harmful, was
[52:49] toxic, it was poisonous. You get around
[52:52] some people and they it's just a
[52:55] negative something coming out of their
[52:57] mouth.
[52:59] There's a way that seemth right unto
[53:01] man, but the end thereof is the way of
[53:03] death.
[53:08] It was a good land.
[53:10] The Holy Ghost is good,
[53:13] but but you have to give up everything
[53:16] for it. Numbers 13:28, Numbers 13:28
[53:21] says, "Nevertheless, the people be
[53:22] strong that dwell in the land, and the
[53:25] cities are walled and very great, and
[53:27] moreover, we saw the children of Anoch
[53:29] there." Notice their their
[53:33] their attitude.
[53:39] They weren't claiming the promise of
[53:41] God. They were looking at the problem
[53:42] they were in.
[53:46] It's, you know, it's one thing to say,
[53:48] you know, this church has got a
[53:51] problem. You know, this church should be
[53:53] doing this. We should have
[53:58] this. Brother Ron, Brother Bruce,
[54:01] Brother John. Sorry for picking on you
[54:03] if I shouldn't be picking on you, but
[54:05] the attitude of this is what should be
[54:08] going on in the church. This should be
[54:11] better. But you know, in
[54:15] reality, there was no, "Hey, let's
[54:18] help."
[54:22] And anytime there's a spirit of
[54:24] criticism, but there's no heart to want
[54:27] to help,
[54:28] it's really not the elective spirit.
[54:32] It's not verse
[54:35] 31. But the men that went up with him
[54:38] said, "We be not able to go up against a
[54:42] people, for they are stronger than we."
[54:46] And they brought up an evil report of
[54:48] the land. Verse 32, which had searched
[54:51] unto the children of Israel, saying, The
[54:54] land though uh through which we had gone
[54:57] to search it, is a land that eateth up
[54:59] the inhabitants thereof, and all the
[55:00] people that we saw in it are men of
[55:04] great
[55:05] stature. I love verse 33 or not verse
[55:08] 33, I'm sorry. Uh let me continue in
[55:10] verse three. And there w and there we
[55:11] saw the giants the son of Anoch and
[55:14] which were come of the giants and we
[55:16] were in our own sight as grasshoppers
[55:20] and so were uh and so we were in their
[55:23] sight as well. Amen. So, you know, I
[55:27] understand that we have
[55:29] terrible trials and things that we face.
[55:33] That's just part of
[55:34] life. But the thing is, God has promised
[55:37] us love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[55:39] gentleness, meekness, temperance, faith.
[55:41] And that's what you need to go through
[55:44] anything.
[55:48] Verse 30. And Caleb stilled the people
[55:52] before Moses and said, "Let us go up at
[55:56] once and possess it, for we are well
[56:00] able to overcome it." Now notice Caleb
[56:04] did not give any
[56:06] statistics. He did not talk about, he
[56:09] did not reason the situation
[56:11] through. He didn't say if we take three
[56:13] guys to every one of
[56:15] them. There was none of that. It was
[56:18] just this is what the word says. I'm
[56:20] standing on God's promise. God spoke it
[56:22] to me. I believe it. Let's go. And
[56:25] that's really what the ministry was that
[56:27] Caleb was preaching. But you know, the
[56:30] church didn't want to hear it.
[56:35] God said, "So be it." For 40 years,
[56:38] Joshua and Caleb was in the church, the
[56:42] only two that was elected. And they had
[56:44] to put up with murmuring, complaining.
[56:46] But you know what? It did not it did not
[56:49] come upon them.
[56:51] They kept themselves from it.
[56:55] And that that's the difference here. I
[56:57] I'm okay if the majority of church says,
[57:00] you know, let's murmur and complain and
[57:02] let's not go. And you know, that's fine
[57:04] if that's where it wants to be. That
[57:07] doesn't mean God's not here. Doesn't
[57:08] mean their life's not here. Doesn't mean
[57:10] the ministry is not here. It just means
[57:13] that the majority are not where they
[57:14] need to be. Right.
[57:18] Everybody would love a perfect church.
[57:21] I would love to be a
[57:23] perfect so you wouldn't have to deal
[57:26] with me. But you know, God is able to
[57:31] take
[57:35] people like Moses who couldn't talk
[57:39] and use him to get the word across to
[57:41] the people.
[57:46] All right, just so you
[57:49] know, oh
[57:52] my I do want to just share a couple
[57:56] things. These are
[57:59] scriptures. The elect is a special
[58:07] people. For thou art a holy people unto
[58:10] the Lord God. The Lord thy God have not
[58:13] chosen thee. For the Lord thy God have
[58:15] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[58:18] himself. The elect of God, the bride of
[58:21] God, is a chosen group of people.
[58:25] They're
[58:26] special. Now, I don't think they walk
[58:29] around telling everybody they're
[58:30] special. That's right.
[58:33] But I think because they have a
[58:35] revelation inside that they are a
[58:37] special people that they
[58:40] adhere to following the word.
[58:45] First Peter chapter 2:9 says, "But you
[58:47] are a chosen generation, a royal
[58:49] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[58:51] people that you should show forth the
[58:54] praises of him who have called you out
[58:55] of darkness into his marvel." So, I want
[58:59] to say like this that darkness isn't
[59:01] just the world to to to the light of
[59:03] salvation. Jesus said, "I am the light
[59:05] of the world." It's not just a
[59:08] salvation because there's many saved
[59:10] that are going through
[59:13] tribulation. And Jesus himself said,
[59:16] "They're foolish. They're saved, but
[59:18] they're foolish."
[59:22] And I believe that the elect
[59:26] lady that she's a special
[59:31] people. She's been chosen of
[59:34] God to walk in the greatest light that
[59:37] there is of the word to walk in all the
[59:40] light. To walk in the light as he is in
[59:41] the
[59:42] light and and and to keep walking and to
[59:46] keep growing and to keep getting closer.
[59:48] And they don't even have the concept of,
[59:50] "Well, I'm saved." That's the main
[59:51] thing. They don't even have that
[59:54] concept. I'll tell you, I hate that
[59:56] revelation. That's a revelation from the
[59:58] devil.
[59:59] It's a revelation that ain't from God.
[1:00:02] God don't have the attitude of, "Well,
[1:00:04] we we're out of Egypt. That's the main
[1:00:06] thing. We don't need this promised
[1:00:07] land."
[1:00:09] They don't. But verse 10, which in times
[1:00:13] past were not a people. I can say amen
[1:00:15] to that. but are now the people of God,
[1:00:19] which have not obtained mercy, but now
[1:00:21] have obtained
[1:00:23] mercy. Second Timothy 2 tells us,
[1:00:25] "Therefore, I endure all things for the
[1:00:27] elect's sake."
[1:00:32] Titus talks about uh Paul being a
[1:00:35] servant of God, an apostle of Jesus
[1:00:37] Christ according to the faith of God's
[1:00:39] elect. soul. In other words, the the
[1:00:41] God's people have a special faith
[1:00:44] because you need it to make a rapture,
[1:00:46] right? The the the elect go into a
[1:00:50] rapture. The chosen, the the wise virgin
[1:00:53] goes into a rapture. So, she's got to
[1:00:55] have the the that rapturing faith.
[1:00:57] Brother
[1:01:02] said, I'm just going to close with this.
[1:01:04] Many scriptures I had to
[1:01:07] skip. You can write them down. 1 Peter 1
[1:01:11] and 2, we're elect according to
[1:01:13] fornowledge. But I want to get to
[1:01:14] Colossians 3:12. Put on therefore as the
[1:01:17] elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels
[1:01:20] of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind,
[1:01:24] meekness, and
[1:01:26] longsuffering, forbearing one another,
[1:01:28] and forgiving one another. If any man
[1:01:30] have a quarrow against another, even as
[1:01:31] Christ forgave you, you know, you do the
[1:01:34] same thing. And above all these things,
[1:01:37] put on charity, which is the bond of
[1:01:39] perfectness. Amen. Let's stand together.
[1:01:41] God bless you. We we
[1:01:47] we are not a group that just says, "I'm
[1:01:50] the
[1:01:52] bride. We are a group that believes we
[1:01:55] are the bride."
[1:01:58] And we are following what the word says,
[1:02:02] doing all that God wants us to
[1:02:06] do to be like
[1:02:13] Jes. To be like
[1:02:21] Jes. I
[1:02:24] long to be like
[1:02:30] him all through life's
[1:02:37] journey. From earth to gloryy.
[1:02:42] [Music]
