[32:55] You are the life,
[33:00] the truth, the way.
[33:05] We bless your name.
[33:10] We bless your name. One more time. Amen.
[33:14] We bless your name.
[33:19] We bless your name.
[33:22] [Music]
[33:29] We give you praise.
[33:33] You are the life,
[33:38] the truth, the way.
[33:43] We bless your name.
[33:48] We bless your name.
[33:52] Amen. Let's just take a moment and bless
[33:54] his name.
[33:56] Hallelujah Jesus. We bless your name
[33:59] today. Praise you, Jesus. Praise you for
[34:03] the name of Jesus.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:06] [Applause]
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; His name
[34:12] is higher
[34:16] &gt;&gt; than any other name. Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; It's worthy to be lifted up and praised.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless each of you today.
[34:25] It's really good to see
[34:28] Johnson and our brother Orlando on a
[34:32] Wednesday. What a great blessing.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. May the Lord
[34:36] bless you.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would turn in your Bibles
[34:40] to the book of Exodus,
[34:43] chapter 12.
[34:47] Some of you already know what we're
[34:48] going to be speaking on. Soon as we say
[34:51] Exodus chapter 12,
[35:00] we're going to begin reading here at
[35:02] verse number five.
[35:06] Everybody there say, "Amen." Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll have a a word of prayer.
[35:13] This is during the
[35:18] the plagues
[35:21] that were in Egypt upon Pharaoh and all
[35:25] of Egypt.
[35:29] And the children of Israel were
[35:32] instructed. God told Moses to speak all
[35:35] the all these things that we're going to
[35:37] read to the congregation of Israel while
[35:39] they were yet in Egypt. And he said in
[35:41] verse 5, "Your lamb shall be without
[35:44] blemish, a male of the first year. You
[35:47] shall take it out of the sheep or from
[35:51] the goats, and you shall keep it up to
[35:54] the 14th day of the same month, and the
[35:57] whole assembly of the congregation of
[36:00] Israel shall kill it in the evening.
[36:03] They shall take of the blood and strike
[36:06] it on the two side posts, and on the
[36:09] upper doorpost of the h of the houses,
[36:12] wherein they shall eat it. They shall
[36:17] eat the flesh in the night, roast it
[36:21] with fire on leaven bread, and with
[36:23] bitter herbs they shall eat it.
[36:27] Eat not of it raw, nor soden
[36:30] at all with water, but roast it with
[36:32] fire, his head, and his legs,
[36:36] and with the prudinence thereof. And ye
[36:39] shall let nothing of it remain until the
[36:41] morning. That which remainth of it until
[36:44] the morning shall be burned with fire.
[36:47] And thus shall you eat it with your
[36:49] loins girded, your shoes on your feet,
[36:51] your staff in your hand.
[36:53] You shall eat it in haste. It is the
[36:56] Lord's Passover.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; For I will pass through the land of
[37:01] Egypt this night, and will smite all the
[37:05] firstborn
[37:06] in the land of Egypt, both man and
[37:09] beast, against all the gods of Egypt. I
[37:12] will execute judgment. I am the Lord.
[37:15] The blood shall be to you for a toolken
[37:18] upon the houses wherein you are. And
[37:21] when I see the blood, I will pass over
[37:23] you. And the plague shall not be upon
[37:26] you to destroy you when I smite the land
[37:28] of Egypt. Amen. Let's just bow a word of
[37:32] prayer. Our heavenly father,
[37:35] Lord, we thank you that we could come to
[37:37] your house tonight to worship you, to
[37:42] praise you, to be with brothers and
[37:43] sisters of late precious faith.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Have our hearts prepared that we might
[37:48] receive from you just a word, Lord, that
[37:50] would help us in our walk with you. And
[37:53] I say tonight, Lord, an important word,
[37:57] Lord, an important message.
[38:00] Father, may it resonate in every one of
[38:01] our hearts. May we go home with a
[38:03] renewed purpose,
[38:05] Lord, that we didn't have when we came.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; I pray that the the Holy Spirit now
[38:11] would move upon our hearts. Only you can
[38:13] do that, Lord.
[38:15] Only you can cause us to hear your word.
[38:20] Lord, give us a hearing ear, receiving
[38:23] heart. Pray, Lord, that you'd help me to
[38:25] get out of the way that your word could
[38:27] be ministered just as you would have it
[38:29] to be to the hearts of your people. feed
[38:31] your bride. Lord, we commit the service
[38:34] remainder of this message into your
[38:36] hands now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[38:45] We're just going to continue reading
[38:47] here. I want to drop down to verse 21.
[38:50] Moses is that was the instructions that
[38:53] God gave Moses. God said, "I am going to
[38:57] pass through Egypt and I am going to
[39:01] kill the firstborn."
[39:04] God was taking
[39:06] uh
[39:09] charge or sending the message of of this
[39:12] that he's going to do. He's bringing
[39:14] judgment upon Egypt. The thing is he
[39:18] made a statement. I'm going to kill all
[39:21] the firstborn where the blood of the
[39:23] innocent lamb is not applied.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; And even uh that doesn't matter if it
[39:29] was a beast or a human being. It doesn't
[39:32] matter if it was Egypt or if it was the
[39:35] uh the Hittites that were visiting or uh
[39:39] neighboring nations or if it was Israel.
[39:42] If there was a firstborn that didn't
[39:44] have the blood applied, death was
[39:46] setting in.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Drop down to verse 21. Then Moses called
[39:51] for all the elders of Israel and said
[39:53] unto them, "Draw out and take your lamb
[39:55] according to your families and kill the
[39:57] Passover. And you shall take a bunch of
[40:00] hissup," which we know the prophet
[40:02] taught us. That was just common faith.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Didn't need anything supernatural. Just
[40:08] believing the word that was preached.
[40:11] You shall take a bunch of hissup and dip
[40:13] it in the blood that's in the in the
[40:16] basin and strike the lentil which is the
[40:19] top post and the two side post which uh
[40:24] with the blood that is in the basin and
[40:27] none of you shall go out of the door of
[40:30] his house until the morning. For the
[40:32] Lord will pass through to smite the
[40:35] Egyptians. And when he seeth the blood
[40:37] upon the lentil on the two sidepost, the
[40:40] Lord will pass over the door, and will
[40:44] not suffer the destroyer to come in unto
[40:47] your house to smite you.
[40:50] And ye shall observe this thing for an
[40:52] ordinance to thee and to thy sons
[40:54] forever. And it shall come to pass, that
[40:57] means today.
[40:59] And it shall come to pass when ye come
[41:02] to the land which the Lord will give you
[41:04] according to he have promised that he
[41:07] shall keep this service that ye shall
[41:09] keep this service. And it and it shall
[41:11] come to pass when your children shall
[41:14] say unto you, what does this mean? Why
[41:18] do you pray in our home? Why do you read
[41:19] the Bible in our home? Why do we
[41:22] reverence the Lord in our home?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. that ye shall say, it is the
[41:26] sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who
[41:29] passed over the houses of the children
[41:32] of Israel in Egypt, when he smoked the
[41:34] Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And
[41:37] the people bowed the head and worshiped.
[41:40] And the children of Israel went away and
[41:43] did as the Lord uh had commanded Moses
[41:47] and Aaron, so did they.
[41:50] Well, this is really a sobering message
[41:52] because the destroyer was not the
[41:56] destroyer was not meant to hurt anybody
[41:59] in Egypt.
[42:01] But there was something that the um I'm
[42:03] sorry, there was the the the destroyer
[42:07] was not meant to destroy anyone that was
[42:10] in Israel. None of the people of God. It
[42:12] wasn't sent for. But something had to
[42:15] transpire in order for Israel not to be
[42:18] destroyed because it was a law
[42:21] that he's just going to destroy all the
[42:23] firstborn in the land.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; So he there was a time where the the the
[42:29] the
[42:31] um there was darkness in the land and
[42:34] then uh there was a a time where the
[42:37] Israel had light and um um and the
[42:40] darkness didn't affect them. But when it
[42:43] came to this plague right here, this was
[42:46] it was affecting everyone and the only
[42:48] way it could be escaped was the blood
[42:50] had to be applied.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached the message the
[42:58] token. How many has heard the message
[43:01] the token?
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Okay, now I recommend hearing this
[43:07] message again.
[43:10] He preached September 1st, 1963.
[43:14] In one way, brother Brandham esteemed
[43:17] this message, the toolken, higher than
[43:20] any other message that he had previously
[43:22] preached.
[43:25] And he took his message from Exodus 12,
[43:28] which we read. Now, he had preached
[43:30] great messages
[43:33] like I'm sure you know some of these.
[43:35] Christ is a mystery of God revealed.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:40] But he esteemed it higher than that. Is
[43:42] your life worthy of the gospel? The
[43:44] flashing red lights of his coming.
[43:46] Standing in the gap. The absolute
[43:49] letting off the pressure. The countdown.
[43:52] Convinced then concerned. Now these are
[43:55] great messages. Why I'm against
[43:57] organized religion. The statue of a
[44:00] perfect man. Jehovah Gyra series. The
[44:05] spoken word is the original seed. That
[44:08] is a magnificent message. The greatest
[44:10] battle ever fought.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Daniel's 70 weeks. Perfect strength by
[44:15] perfect weakness
[44:17] that God had explained. The mark of the
[44:20] beast possessing the gate of the enemy
[44:23] as the eagle stirth up her nest
[44:28] that day on Calvary. The seal of God,
[44:30] the rejected king, the adoption series.
[44:34] What is the Holy Ghost and what is the
[44:37] Holy Ghost given for? How many know
[44:39] these messages?
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Be certain of God. Thirsting for life.
[44:44] Why we are not a denomination? The
[44:46] mighty conqueror, the Hebrew series, the
[44:49] teachings in Revelations,
[44:51] even the church ages.
[44:55] He esteemed the token higher. If I could
[44:58] say this, even the seven seals which
[45:01] brother Brandon preached five months
[45:03] earlier in March and they were
[45:05] sandwiched together between two great
[45:08] messages called God hidden simplicity
[45:10] and revealed the same in the beginning
[45:12] and at the end showing how important it
[45:15] is to to catch this message. He did not
[45:19] want the people to miss the seven seals.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And people came from all over the
[45:26] globe led by God to come and hear the
[45:30] seven seals.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; And yet it was hid in simplicity. And
[45:35] brother Brandham esteemed this message
[45:38] the token higher than any other message
[45:41] that he had preached.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; And we've listened to it. But have we
[45:47] got the importance of this message?
[45:57] Right before he preached the token, he
[45:59] preached the message perfect faith
[46:02] because I believe we need perfect faith
[46:05] &gt;&gt; to really receive the token.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And after he preached the token, he
[46:10] preached it is so important. He preached
[46:13] desperation
[46:15] &gt;&gt; that we've got to get desperate for the
[46:17] token. Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; I just want to read a a quote here that
[46:22] he said in the desperation message. He
[46:25] said, "This morning, the message
[46:28] this morning was to me," which that's
[46:31] when he spoke the token to me was the
[46:34] highlight message of my entire ministry.
[46:37] This morning, see, the highlight message
[46:39] of my entire ministry. He says it two
[46:42] times. Someday I'll tell you how it came
[46:44] about. And I know that everything has
[46:48] worked for months and months and months
[46:53] up to that one message
[46:56] moving up to come to a place that was
[46:59] the capping off time of it. You see, so
[47:03] brother Brandham's now sitting back
[47:05] after preaching all these these messages
[47:08] and he says, "I can see how the Lord has
[47:12] been preparing all these messages that
[47:14] I've been preaching for this message."
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; He's getting the attention of the
[47:21] people.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now,
[47:25] I I I hope that you got what the token
[47:30] meant." See the token is the sign that
[47:34] the blood has been applied
[47:38] that the price that's been asked or
[47:40] required of God. See Jesus paid the
[47:43] price by shedding his own blood. He did
[47:45] that and then from there his life came
[47:48] the Holy Spirit. And when the blood is
[47:50] applied to you,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit is a token that your
[47:56] price is paid.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; God has received you. And that's the
[48:00] token.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Remember that is the token.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Now there is many people who don't know
[48:06] what the token is. See,
[48:09] &gt;&gt; and you have to make it that nobody
[48:11] knows so that all have a chance to get
[48:14] it.
[48:17] The highlight of his ministry.
[48:22] The highlight of his ministry.
[48:25] He's the seventh age messenger.
[48:28] He's the angel to the Leodysian message.
[48:32] The one whose message is to get the
[48:34] bride ready for the groom. The one who
[48:37] went around seven times proclaiming the
[48:40] message of the hour. And it was the
[48:42] highlight of his entire ministry.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; The one who saw cancer fall off people's
[48:48] body where the blind eyes were open and
[48:51] crosseyes became straightened. He saw
[48:54] new limbs come forth. He saw the dead
[48:56] raised. And yet he said, "This is the
[48:59] highlight of my entire ministry."
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; One who God used to discern the thoughts
[49:08] and intents of men's hearts and their
[49:10] minds.
[49:12] The one who could tell you if you were
[49:15] lying to him
[49:17] &gt;&gt; or withholding something from him.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; This man, this man, the one who lived in
[49:23] the supernatural realm more than he
[49:25] lived in the natural realm. Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; The one who had that plane, God had that
[49:32] plane stopped just to go help answer
[49:35] Aunt Jamaima's prayers.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; The one where the sword came down in
[49:41] Sabina Canyon and said, "This is the
[49:43] sword of the Lord."
[49:46] the one where that voice came down in
[49:48] 1933 and brother Brandham is uh
[49:52] baptizing the 17th person in the Ohio
[49:54] River and said as you and your me or as
[49:57] John Baptist forerrun my first coming so
[50:00] shall you and and your message forun my
[50:02] second coming. This man he said this
[50:05] message is the highlight of my entire
[50:08] ministry. the toolken,
[50:12] the man that went beyond the curtain of
[50:13] time.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; This man who God
[50:25] used to send a message
[50:29] to get his bride out.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; The one we will stand before
[50:34] &gt;&gt; on the day of judgment. Amen.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; This man said, "This message, the token,
[50:41] is the highlight of my ministry." The
[50:43] capping off
[50:45] &gt;&gt; like, "If we don't get this, we're going
[50:48] to miss it."
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; God heard the cry of his people and he
[50:58] sent his servant Moses to deliver them.
[51:02] And it the now God could have handled it
[51:07] any way,
[51:09] but he decided to handle it with
[51:12] punishing the Egyptians with 10 plagues.
[51:15] And the first one was the blood,
[51:18] the Nile River, and all the water
[51:20] sources of Egypt turned to blood. The
[51:23] next was a massive infestation of frogs
[51:27] and then gnats or lice
[51:31] and and then there was flies and and
[51:34] pestilence and and then boils, hail,
[51:37] locust, and then darkness. And the last
[51:40] plague was the death of the firstborn.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] And God's people were instructed to take
[51:46] the blood of an innocent lamb and strike
[51:49] it on the two side posts in the upper
[51:51] doorpost of of their house wherein they
[51:54] lived. And they were to take the actual
[51:57] uh meat of that lamb and eat it
[52:01] physically.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And if the blood wasn't applied, there
[52:06] was death to all the firstborn.
[52:11] Now today, if the blood isn't applied to
[52:14] our house,
[52:17] &gt;&gt; then we will die
[52:20] &gt;&gt; because without the Holy Ghost, we're
[52:22] only first born.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; We've got to become born again. And when
[52:28] you apply the blood of Christ to your
[52:31] house, you are born the second time and
[52:35] death will pass you.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:42] You know what it is? The devil, he
[52:44] preaches.
[52:46] How many times have you heard in the
[52:48] world
[52:50] that somebody's born again and you knew
[52:52] they weren't?
[52:55] It's a pretty common thing.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the devil's job is to get us
[53:02] get as many people as he can feeling as
[53:05] comfortable as he can that you've got
[53:07] the Holy Ghost.
[53:09] In fact, many will come to me in that
[53:11] day and say, "Well, wait a minute, Lord.
[53:14] I I cast out devils. I I I did many
[53:18] wonderful works. I I I prophesied in
[53:20] your name." And and and
[53:23] Jesus is going to say, "I never knew
[53:26] you."
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So, you weren't born again.
[53:30] You weren't born again. So, you can have
[53:33] those experiences, not have the first
[53:35] birth, and miss it.
[53:39] It's a it's a very
[53:42] it's a sobering thought to think that
[53:45] the devil is ministering to as many
[53:48] people as will give him an ear. Oh, you
[53:50] got the Holy Ghost. You got the Holy
[53:51] Ghost.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, you got it.
[53:57] Why did Brother Brandham said this was
[53:59] the highlight
[54:01] message of my entire ministry?
[54:06] If you listen to this message,
[54:10] I am telling you will have if you don't
[54:12] have the fear of God before you listen
[54:14] to it, you will have it after you listen
[54:16] to the message
[54:22] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon made it real
[54:24] clear. It don't matter how many demons
[54:28] you've ever cast out by your faith.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; It don't matter how many good deeds
[54:32] you've done. It don't matter how many
[54:34] healings took place. It just doesn't
[54:37] matter. If the blood isn't applied, if
[54:39] the life of Christ is not beaming
[54:42] outside of you, you're going to have a
[54:44] spiritual death.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Now,
[54:52] um
[54:54] I would ask Ree how old he is, but he's
[54:56] sleeping.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; How old are you, Ree? 10. All right.
[55:04] And uh Jonathan, you're you 14 or 15
[55:08] sorry on me.
[55:12] Now I am pretty sure that there is more
[55:16] required of
[55:18] John John than there is of Ree. Is that
[55:22] a true statement?
[55:25] Because there's an age difference.
[55:28] Well, in this age, this is the seventh
[55:30] church age.
[55:32] We have all the truth that's been given.
[55:35] There is no more truth.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; There's nothing more we're looking for.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is finished.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; So more is required. Jesus said, "To
[55:45] whom much is given, much is required."
[55:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; And the life of Christ must be
[55:53] manifested. We can't just have
[55:55] justification
[55:57] &gt;&gt; that it's not going to make it.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] sanctification ain't going to make it.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Or me comparing myself with somebody
[56:06] who's a little bit less than me.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; That ain't going to make it.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; The token must be applied. The blood
[56:15] must be applied.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Now, it's not the literal blood,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; right? It's the life that was in the
[56:28] blood.
[56:30] No, man had sin and it caused God's word
[56:36] to bring death.
[56:39] And yeah, man died physically, but God
[56:43] was concerned spiritually,
[56:46] right? And so, as you know the story,
[56:50] they offered up animals, they killed
[56:52] animals, and they hh made atonement, but
[56:55] it only worked for a year.
[56:59] And then they had to do it again. And
[57:00] brother Brandon taught us the reason why
[57:02] that is is that the spirit that's in an
[57:05] animal cannot come upon a human.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; So it took a human to redeem the human
[57:14] because a human was required because he
[57:17] said the day you eat thereof the day
[57:18] you'll die. That word had to be
[57:20] fulfilled.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And so what did God do?
[57:27] He came himself.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; He came He he birthed himself through a
[57:35] virgin.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Without man being evolved, a virgin
[57:40] shall conceive
[57:42] and God was manifested in the flesh,
[57:45] seen of angels, justified.
[57:48] God came and paid the price for us.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; At Calvary so we didn't have to die.
[57:53] Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; But that does not mean we're all saved.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus went to Calvary.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; There's many people that that can say,
[58:04] "Yes, I believe that Jesus died on the
[58:07] cross for my sins,
[58:10] but that doesn't make them saved."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; I know this is this is hard,
[58:17] but the blood has to be applied. that
[58:20] life has to come back upon the human
[58:23] being and change his nature into the
[58:25] nature of God of what it was back in the
[58:28] garden.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And we've got a a a a message that's
[58:34] being preached by the devil
[58:41] that that really isn't necessary.
[58:45] that all you have to do is just accept
[58:47] the message of the hour. Just repent,
[58:50] get baptized, just try to do your best
[58:53] because really nobody is perfect. You
[58:56] know,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; and you know, as long as you're going to
[59:00] church, you're actually pressing in
[59:05] like, you know,
[59:08] you you just do a good deed once a month
[59:11] for the church and you'll be accepted by
[59:13] God.
[59:15] I mean, there's some that don't even do
[59:17] things for the church.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; You know, oh, they got that handled. I'm
[59:23] not called to do that. What are you
[59:24] called to do? What is God calling you to
[59:26] do? Because if you're doing something,
[59:28] praise God.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; We have to receive the life inside.
[59:39] Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Christ died so the life could come back
[59:44] inside of us.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; And when the life comes inside of us, we
[59:48] literally live the life of Christ.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; It is so simple.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe I've got the Holy
[59:56] Spirit, you know, but I just can't kick
[59:59] this lion.
[1:00:01] All I want to tell you is you need to
[1:00:03] make sure you get enough Holy Ghost that
[1:00:05] you kick the lion.
[1:00:08] And you could just take that with
[1:00:10] whatever it is that's hanging on you.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Don't just be satisfied with how much
[1:00:16] Holy Ghost you got because there's a
[1:00:18] death angel set to come.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Do you know everybody if you don't make
[1:00:24] the rapture?
[1:00:25] Did you know if you belong to him,
[1:00:29] you're going to have to give your life's
[1:00:30] blood?
[1:00:32] Think about this. You're going to taste
[1:00:35] death in the flesh anyways.
[1:00:38] But that still don't put you with the
[1:00:40] bride,
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; you got to sleep a thousand years.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing. This message I I
[1:00:50] say to you, if I say nothing today, go
[1:00:53] and listen to that message and get
[1:00:56] serious between you and God because it
[1:00:58] doesn't matter who else you live with.
[1:01:08] To me, the those 10 natural plagues were
[1:01:12] just a type of the spiritual plagues.
[1:01:15] I believe that. I believe that we're
[1:01:18] dealing with spiritual plagues. And you
[1:01:20] can read more about it in Revelation 16
[1:01:22] and 2 Timothy chapter 3. What's
[1:01:24] happening in the church, but I just want
[1:01:26] to read this in Luke chapter 21:34. Luke
[1:01:29] 21:34. Jesus speaking here says, "Take
[1:01:32] heed to yourselves." Speaking of the
[1:01:34] last day, lest at any time your hearts
[1:01:36] be overcharged.
[1:01:38] You ever been overcharged? You got too
[1:01:40] much going. Can't handle it.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Overcharged
[1:01:44] with surfing, with drunkenness, and with
[1:01:46] the cares of this life. I just can't
[1:01:49] keep up, brother John. So that that day
[1:01:52] come upon you unawares.
[1:01:56] Unawares. I mean, I'm telling you, what
[1:01:58] came upon Egypt was unaware. They didn't
[1:02:01] know what was coming. When Moses stepped
[1:02:03] down there, that was it.
[1:02:07] For as a snare shall it come upon all
[1:02:10] them that dwell on the face of the whole
[1:02:12] earth. Watch ye therefore and pray
[1:02:14] always that you may be accounted worthy
[1:02:17] to escape all the things that are coming
[1:02:19] to pass and stand before the Son of Man.
[1:02:21] I'm telling you, the only way that
[1:02:23] you're going to make that is have the
[1:02:25] Holy Ghost.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Get serious about getting the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost.
[1:02:30] Don't be a gambler.
[1:02:33] That's assuming, right? Uh, brother
[1:02:36] Brandon said assuming is a venturing
[1:02:38] without authority.
[1:02:40] We need the Holy Ghost to escape.
[1:02:47] The 10th plague
[1:02:49] is not just natural death, but it's a
[1:02:52] spiritual death.
[1:02:59] Brother Brandham taught us those that
[1:03:01] were in the age of justification with
[1:03:03] Luther, all they had to do was believe.
[1:03:07] The just shall live by faith. If they
[1:03:10] did, they were part of the bride,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; They were there are brothers.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; And in in in Wesley's age, they had to
[1:03:20] get sanctified.
[1:03:24] Each age more light was given, more was
[1:03:27] required.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, in this age for us
[1:03:32] there, we we got to have it all.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; We can't have Luther's message. We We
[1:03:37] don't live off of Luther's message.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Add to your faith, virtue, virtue,
[1:03:42] knowledge. You add you're you're you're
[1:03:44] you're walking up seven steps to
[1:03:47] perfection.
[1:03:51] Now,
[1:03:56] how many here owns a house? Let me see
[1:03:58] your hands.
[1:04:00] You do. You do. Okay. So, the bank owns
[1:04:02] the rest of them.
[1:04:05] Okay. Is that it? Anybody else own a
[1:04:07] house? Well, I want you children to know
[1:04:11] you own a house.
[1:04:13] You own a house.
[1:04:16] You don't only have a mansion on the
[1:04:17] other side, but you own a house.
[1:04:20] Every one of us has a house
[1:04:24] and the blood has to be applied.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; You children can't look to your mom and
[1:04:29] dad.
[1:04:33] You husbands can't look to your wives.
[1:04:35] You wives can't look to your husbands.
[1:04:38] Hebrews chapter 3:5.
[1:04:40] Hebrews chapter 3:5.
[1:04:44] And Moses verilely was faithful in all
[1:04:48] his house as a servant for a testimony
[1:04:52] of those things which were to be spoken
[1:04:55] after.
[1:04:56] But Christ
[1:04:58] as a son over his own house,
[1:05:04] whose house are we?
[1:05:08] If we hold fast the confidence and the
[1:05:12] rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
[1:05:17] Now I just want to hit 14. And for we
[1:05:21] are made partakers of Christ if we hold
[1:05:23] the beginning of our confidence
[1:05:24] steadfast to the end.
[1:05:27] Now we are the house of God if the blood
[1:05:31] is applied.
[1:05:33] If the blood isn't applied, the death
[1:05:36] angel is going to set in.
[1:05:40] It's a spiritual death.
[1:05:43] So, the blood has to be applied to your
[1:05:45] life.
[1:05:46] You have two side posts. You have a a a
[1:05:50] a head post as it were, a threshold on
[1:05:54] top and two side post. And the blood has
[1:05:57] to be applied. Now, what does that mean?
[1:05:58] If you walk in when you go home today
[1:06:00] from church, you're going to enter in
[1:06:03] the door to your house,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And everybody can visualize what your
[1:06:07] house looks like. Our house, it has gray
[1:06:10] side post and one on top. It's it's got
[1:06:13] a red. You visualize it as you walk in.
[1:06:15] Everybody's got that.
[1:06:17] But you yourself have a door
[1:06:22] and it's displayed by everybody.
[1:06:26] Everybody sees your life. Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Everybody sees when you get angry, when
[1:06:30] you get upset, when you lie, when you
[1:06:33] all the things that you do, it is seen
[1:06:35] by your life.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And the blood has to be applied there.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Now, what would happen if
[1:06:50] they did not eat? If they didn't believe
[1:06:54] in this, if they didn't believe the
[1:06:56] message of Moses, they wouldn't applied
[1:06:58] the blood.
[1:07:01] They literally had to eat the lamb in
[1:07:03] their home. Jesus said, "Unless you eat
[1:07:05] the flesh of the son of man, you have no
[1:07:08] life in you. You drink his blood, you
[1:07:10] eat his flesh. You have to do that or
[1:07:13] there's no life in you."
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; And he said, uh, my my flesh it my words
[1:07:19] are spirit and they are life. It is the
[1:07:21] word of God that we eat. We come to
[1:07:23] church, we hear the word, and that word
[1:07:25] is so real to us that we eat it. We just
[1:07:28] don't let it go in one ear and out the
[1:07:29] other.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; We've got to take it and eat it into our
[1:07:33] house. In other words, though none go
[1:07:36] with me, still I'll follow him. If I'm
[1:07:38] the only one that's going to live at my
[1:07:40] home, I'm going to be that one. I'm not
[1:07:42] going to I'm not going to rely on my my
[1:07:45] husband, my wife, my children, my mom,
[1:07:48] my dad. It does not matter because
[1:07:50] Christ has called me to be his house.
[1:07:53] I'm applying the blood. I'm eating the
[1:07:56] word. I'm becoming the word. The message
[1:07:58] of the hour is real to me. The highlight
[1:08:01] of the message of brother Brandham. It
[1:08:04] means something to me. I've heard his
[1:08:06] voice.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not just It's just another message.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Not just another message.
[1:08:17] We'll get into that if we get some time.
[1:08:20] What the message is, we must apply the
[1:08:23] life of Christ to our house, our vessel,
[1:08:27] our body.
[1:08:29] Get rid of the shenanigans.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Get rid of acting like you're a
[1:08:34] Christian, but really you're not.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; We must have the life of Christ.
[1:08:42] Somebody that acts like a devil and says
[1:08:46] they are Christian.
[1:08:48] I am telling you that is the most phony
[1:08:51] baloney.
[1:08:56] Jesus taught us by their fruit.
[1:09:01] The fruit that's coming forth either the
[1:09:03] blood is applied or it's not.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; The brother Brandham said it like this.
[1:09:11] The blood must be on display. The Holy
[1:09:14] Spirit must be on display. It's nothing
[1:09:16] that you do in your home.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; And then you you you it's not something
[1:09:21] that's hid.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; It's not something that you just out
[1:09:24] there a little bit. Brother Brandon says
[1:09:26] your life is on display. Everybody sees
[1:09:29] it. Your enemies see it. Your neighbors
[1:09:32] see it. Your workers see it.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It's not two different lives.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; It's one life.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] the life for Christ.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the evening time
[1:09:47] message. How many knows what what
[1:09:51] brother Brandon said the evening time
[1:09:52] message was? How many remember brother
[1:09:54] Brandham saying the message is Jesus
[1:09:58] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[1:09:59] forever?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; All right. But he says here in the
[1:10:03] message the token the evening time
[1:10:05] message is to apply the token.
[1:10:10] Well,
[1:10:12] is it the evening time message or is it
[1:10:15] is it Jesus Christ the same yesterday or
[1:10:17] different or is it to apply the token?
[1:10:20] The token is the life of Christ.
[1:10:23] The token is the life of Christ which is
[1:10:26] Jesus Christ the same in you today and
[1:10:29] forever.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; It is the same thing.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:35] The the token applied is Jesus Christ
[1:10:38] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:10:40] Not just at church, not just in some
[1:10:43] brother or some sister, but in your
[1:10:45] life.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's what counts. I'm telling you,
[1:10:50] when the rapture happens, there is
[1:10:52] nothing that anybody can do to help you
[1:10:54] make it in.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Your your sister, your brother, nobody's
[1:11:02] prayer is going to get you in.
[1:11:05] This is the hour that the token must be
[1:11:07] on display,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Don't wait.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Nothing can take the place of the token.
[1:11:18] That doesn't matter how long you've been
[1:11:19] serving the Lord or what great deeds
[1:11:21] you've done.
[1:11:24] How many testimonies you can tell,
[1:11:28] the life has to be on display.
[1:11:32] The toolken is what God gives you when
[1:11:35] he has received your faith.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; You can say, "Well, I repented. I
[1:11:42] believe in Christ. I'm going to get
[1:11:44] baptized." And you get baptized. And you
[1:11:47] say you're a believer. Oh, are you a
[1:11:49] believer? I'm a believer.
[1:11:51] But it isn't until God ushers you and
[1:11:54] gives you the Holy Ghost that you truly
[1:11:57] have been accepted by him.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know that's a strong message,
[1:12:01] but it's a truth.
[1:12:04] Jesus said, "I will build my church
[1:12:10] upon this revelation.
[1:12:14] Upon this rock, I will build my church,
[1:12:17] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:12:19] against it." Christ is building the
[1:12:21] church, not us.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Christ is. Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; We're workers together with him. He
[1:12:30] tells us what to do. We go and do it.
[1:12:34] And he gives the Holy Ghost to them that
[1:12:36] obey him.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Is that scripture? He gives the Holy
[1:12:39] Ghost to them that obey him.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; We play a part, but it's only Christ
[1:12:44] that can give us the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; We can't do anything to get it.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; We can't make it happen.
[1:12:53] But if we follow him,
[1:12:55] ask and it shall be given. Seek and you
[1:12:57] shall find. Knock and the door shall be
[1:13:00] open. If we do what Christ said, how
[1:13:03] much more us being evil, how much more
[1:13:06] will God give us the Holy Ghost?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; That's the token.
[1:13:12] It's the life. It's not going to a
[1:13:15] church where you feel good.
[1:13:17] Amen. You know how many good feelood
[1:13:20] churches are out there? or they're going
[1:13:21] to miss it.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; It's the blind leading the blind.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; And and nobody wants to come to the
[1:13:26] facts. I'm so glad, brother Lando, that
[1:13:29] God sent a prophet because if God wanted
[1:13:31] to send a prophet, there is no church,
[1:13:33] there is no way that I ever I could have
[1:13:36] ever got this truth.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; None. There just isn't.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; I could have got some.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I could have got because I was in the
[1:13:43] Catholic church. I could have got some.
[1:13:46] But to be honest with you, uh, without
[1:13:49] the message of the hour, I would think I
[1:13:52] would always have enough.
[1:13:55] But this tells me that there's more for
[1:13:58] us. Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; More for us.
[1:14:03] The greatest thing a believer can do is
[1:14:06] seek the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Did you know what the revelation of
[1:14:10] Jesus Christ is?
[1:14:15] The revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:18] to you is when it's manifested in your
[1:14:21] flesh.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; It's not what you know,
[1:14:25] not what you can quote.
[1:14:28] It's not even when God comes and showers
[1:14:31] his blessings or gives you faith to cast
[1:14:34] out devils
[1:14:36] to to know the seals to know the
[1:14:38] mysteries to know the thunders to know
[1:14:41] the plagues all the vials all this is
[1:14:45] wonderful but until Jesus Christ is
[1:14:48] manifest in your flesh you don't have
[1:14:50] enough of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; it's not knowledge
[1:14:56] it's it's a a manifestation where you've
[1:14:59] given him your body to live through.
[1:15:03] And
[1:15:05] I I look at it like this. We were
[1:15:06] sharing a little bit of this in the
[1:15:07] men's meeting, but
[1:15:10] Jesus said, "For this purpose, I came to
[1:15:13] give my life at Calvary.
[1:15:15] This is why I came to give my life." But
[1:15:18] when to the acid test came, he was in
[1:15:21] the garden praying and he did not want
[1:15:23] to go.
[1:15:27] This is a perfect
[1:15:31] sinless human being in that body that
[1:15:36] suffered afflictions like you and I and
[1:15:38] didn't want to go.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; How much more are we not going to want
[1:15:44] to?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; But he taught us to die out.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Keep praying.
[1:15:51] Keep being serious. and end your prayer
[1:15:55] with not my will but thy will be done.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; The token is the sign that the blood has
[1:16:05] been applied. Brother Brandham said
[1:16:07] the life of Christ
[1:16:10] will be on display.
[1:16:12] It's we just got to get past this.
[1:16:16] You you can't say I'm not a Christian.
[1:16:18] You can't say that I'm not a believer.
[1:16:19] You can't say I I'm not. You can't say I
[1:16:21] don't believe. I mean, we need to get
[1:16:24] beyond that.
[1:16:26] We should be hungering to say this to
[1:16:29] one another. Do you see the life of
[1:16:31] Christ in me?
[1:16:33] Do you see something that's missing?
[1:16:37] Do you see that I am not displaying the
[1:16:40] life of Christ as you see it?
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Now, that's where we should be.
[1:16:48] You know what? I'm gonna say it again.
[1:16:51] There should be such a hunger inside of
[1:16:53] us to make sure that the token has been
[1:16:56] applied, that the blood is there, that
[1:16:59] the life is being lived, that we're
[1:17:00] living for others,
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; that we're just not half in and half
[1:17:04] out.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; It's sad. Some of us are at the age of
[1:17:10] accountability
[1:17:12] and we're not even concerned about the
[1:17:14] life that we're living.
[1:17:18] We're still depending on mom and dad to
[1:17:20] tell us when to be good, how to be good,
[1:17:24] when we should be seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:17:27] because we're at the age of
[1:17:28] accountability.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, the greatest thing
[1:17:32] your mom and dad make them the happiest
[1:17:34] in the whole world is you get the Holy
[1:17:36] Ghost. There ain't nothing because you
[1:17:38] just well took the job off their their
[1:17:40] hands because the parents are the
[1:17:42] responsibility of being the Holy Ghost
[1:17:45] until you get the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; The prophet said
[1:17:55] it's a fearful thing to fall in the
[1:17:57] hands of a living God.
[1:18:01] Look, there was fear and trembling in in
[1:18:07] the the camp of Israel when they were in
[1:18:09] Egypt.
[1:18:12] I am sure
[1:18:15] that the kids were saying to their dad,
[1:18:18] "Are you sure the blood's applied? I'm
[1:18:20] the oldest, you know."
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; No skin off your teeth, but it is mine.
[1:18:24] Is the blood applied?
[1:18:28] And you need to be concerned about
[1:18:31] yourself.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; All we have to do is believe the word.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Just believe the word.
[1:18:49] Get the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:52] Make it a priority in your life.
[1:18:57] When brother Brandham said, "Set
[1:18:58] everything aside until you get perfect
[1:19:01] love."
[1:19:03] You know, God is love.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; God is the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the word written on
[1:19:13] the Holy Ghost is the word alive.
[1:19:18] So when you lay every side everything
[1:19:21] aside to get the Holy Ghost or get
[1:19:23] perfect love, you're literally laying
[1:19:25] aside everything until you get
[1:19:27] perfection of the Holy Ghost. Right?
[1:19:31] Come on now. Because we all got the Holy
[1:19:34] Ghost in portion,
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; but we need enough Holy Ghost that we
[1:19:41] literally can love our enemy.
[1:19:46] It's the hardest thing to do.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; It's the hardest thing to do is to love
[1:19:52] to a place that you lay down everything
[1:19:55] your whole life and live for your enemy.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Love the soul of your enemy.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; That's godly love.
[1:20:08] And to me, that's the token.
[1:20:11] When you can love your enemy, you've got
[1:20:14] the token.
[1:20:17] We all have those internal battles. I'll
[1:20:20] say it's at that time that Christ must
[1:20:22] come on display.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we get bent out of
[1:20:27] shape if somebody doesn't keep the door
[1:20:29] open for us when we're walking through
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; or somebody doesn't want to shake hands
[1:20:34] with us. Right.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It's it it's sad, but we we have a
[1:20:41] chance to exercise
[1:20:44] perfect love.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; If we're just good to those that are
[1:20:51] good to us, what what good is that?
[1:20:54] Jesus said, "What good is that?"
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; But we should be looking for
[1:20:59] opportunities
[1:21:01] to love when somebody uses us.
[1:21:05] to say all manner of evil against us, to
[1:21:07] talk behind our back
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; because it gives you a chance to
[1:21:12] manifest Christ.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And when you can manifest Christ, you're
[1:21:16] fearless.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; But if you can't manifest Christ, you're
[1:21:20] like going through the graveyard
[1:21:22] whistling.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; You're still scared.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; You're scared of the boogeyman's the
[1:21:28] ghost coming. I don't know. You're
[1:21:30] scared of something in the graveyard.
[1:21:33] But when you've got perfect love, you
[1:21:35] have you boldness. You're not afraid of
[1:21:38] anything.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; All right. First or Colossians chapter 1
[1:21:44] 27.
[1:21:46] Colossians 1 verse 27
[1:21:50] Paul speaking to whom God would make
[1:21:53] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:21:57] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:22:01] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:22:14] everybody that has Christ inside of you.
[1:22:18] It is the hope of glory.
[1:22:21] But can we make a rapture
[1:22:24] with just having Christ in a way of
[1:22:27] justification?
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; We cannot.
[1:22:31] We cannot make the rapture.
[1:22:34] There's there's that hope is not there.
[1:22:38] The only time we can get hope is that
[1:22:41] when we are willing to work to get
[1:22:44] Christ all the way in us.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And that means we have to be honest with
[1:22:49] oursel. Die out to the flesh.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Be willing to get serious about, you
[1:22:55] know, sometimes it's hard to get, you
[1:22:57] know, people motivated to come and get
[1:22:58] in the prayer closets, to get in the
[1:23:00] prayer rooms, to spend time listening to
[1:23:04] tapes. When was the last time you sat
[1:23:06] down and listened to a tape?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother John, I don't even really
[1:23:11] listen to them. I come to church and I'm
[1:23:13] hoping you're going to tell me all about
[1:23:14] them.
[1:23:17] Brother Ron was telling me he he's
[1:23:19] telling me this today. He says, "Um, I
[1:23:22] was watching this
[1:23:24] real or or this some information and a
[1:23:26] man was giving uh the information that
[1:23:29] if you read your your Bible uh once a
[1:23:33] week, it doesn't do anything for you."
[1:23:38] And if you read your Bible twice a week,
[1:23:41] it doesn't do anything for you.
[1:23:44] And if you read your Bible three days a
[1:23:47] week,
[1:23:49] it doesn't do anything for you.
[1:23:52] And if you read your Bible four times a
[1:23:54] week,
[1:23:56] it won't do anything for you. I wonder
[1:23:59] if any of this is now making sense.
[1:24:04] But he says if you read your Bible five
[1:24:06] times a week, it's 200 it'll it'll draw
[1:24:09] you closer to God 220% more.
[1:24:13] It'll help you 220% more. Is that what
[1:24:16] you said?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:18] It It's like all in or or not not
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus or brother Brandon said like this.
[1:24:24] If you want to get closer to God, read
[1:24:26] your Bible and pray every day.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Not once a week or twice a week or three
[1:24:32] times a week, but every day.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; That's how you do it.
[1:24:38] That's how you get more Holy Ghost
[1:24:41] is be serious.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Like I really want more Holy Ghost.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Don't wait for the preacher to to say
[1:24:49] come up to the altar or raise your hand.
[1:24:53] Just make a decision. I want more of
[1:24:55] God.
[1:24:57] And start seeking more of God. Because
[1:25:00] even though you might be in a message
[1:25:03] church,
[1:25:05] you might be even in a wonderful church.
[1:25:08] I would never say you had a wonderful
[1:25:09] pastor, but you might be in a wonderful
[1:25:11] church.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; The thing is that's not good enough to
[1:25:16] get you the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; That's only set in an atmosphere in
[1:25:20] which you can get it.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You still need to I want it. I want it.
[1:25:27] All right. to whom God would make known
[1:25:29] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:25:31] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:25:33] Christ in you the hope of glory whom we
[1:25:35] preach
[1:25:37] warning every man
[1:25:39] and teaching every man in all wisdom.
[1:25:43] What are you doing that for? That we may
[1:25:46] present every man perfect
[1:25:49] in Christ Jesus.
[1:25:53] where to I also labor striving according
[1:25:56] to the working
[1:25:58] to his working which workketh in me
[1:26:01] mightily.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Going to read this quote and then we're
[1:26:05] going to just close. Brother Brandham
[1:26:06] said this morning. The message this
[1:26:10] morning to me was the highlight message
[1:26:12] of my entire ministry. This morning see
[1:26:15] a highlight message of my entire
[1:26:17] ministry. Someday I'll tell you how I
[1:26:21] come about it. And I know that
[1:26:24] everything has worked for months and
[1:26:25] months and months up to that one message
[1:26:28] moving up to come to that place. That
[1:26:31] was the capping off time of it. You see
[1:26:34] now I hope that you got what the message
[1:26:37] the token meant. See the token is a sign
[1:26:42] that the blood has really been applied.
[1:26:44] That the price that has been asked or
[1:26:47] required of God. See Jesus paid the
[1:26:51] price by the shedding of his own blood.
[1:26:52] He did that. Then from
[1:26:56] then from his life came the Holy Spirit.
[1:27:02] And when the blood is applied to you to
[1:27:05] your house, the Holy Spirit is the token
[1:27:09] that your price is paid. That God has
[1:27:14] received you. That the token remember
[1:27:18] that is the token.
[1:27:21] Every see God Calvary was for everybody.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; But until the blood of the life comes
[1:27:33] inside of you, you personally your price
[1:27:35] has not been paid.
[1:27:37] Your price has not been paid
[1:27:41] personally. That's why in every church
[1:27:44] there's three types of believers.
[1:27:48] Some got the Holy Ghost and some don't.
[1:27:54] And those that got the Holy Ghost, their
[1:27:56] price is paid. Remember the 10 virgins.
[1:28:02] Five were wise.
[1:28:05] Five did not take oil with their vessel.
[1:28:08] Remember we are the vessels.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:12] And the oil has to be inside.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; We can't just say, "Oh, I plead the
[1:28:18] blood. I plead the blood. I plead the
[1:28:19] blood."
[1:28:23] Eventually the the life of the blood has
[1:28:26] to be inside of us.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil's scared of.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; He's scared of the life.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; He is not scared of of in my name you
[1:28:36] shall cast out devils.
[1:28:40] How many times have we tried to cast out
[1:28:42] a devil out of somebody and it didn't
[1:28:44] come out?
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? How many
[1:28:48] times we want to cast out a devil out of
[1:28:50] somebody?
[1:28:54] Look, the devil trembles at the weakest
[1:28:56] one among us when we're on our knees to
[1:28:59] God.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; It's just getting serious with God.
[1:29:07] God's on your side.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; God wants to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:29:12] more than you want it.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Only you can apply the token.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Only you can apply his life to you. Only
[1:29:23] you can say, "I I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:29:27] stop this and I'm going to start doing
[1:29:29] that."
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Only you can do that.
[1:29:32] And I trust by the grace of God that
[1:29:35] today
[1:29:37] you're going to make it the highlight of
[1:29:39] your entire life is to apply Christ to
[1:29:42] your life. Amen. Let's stand together.
[1:29:51] Amen.
[1:29:55] Amen. And amen.
[1:30:00] Let's sing
[1:30:03] um at the cross.
[1:30:07] At the cross.
[1:30:13] You know how many people the cross will
[1:30:15] be in vain to?
[1:30:19] But to us who have received his life,
[1:30:24] it's not in vain. Amen.
[1:30:31] Alas,
[1:30:33] and did my savior bleed? And did my
[1:30:40] suffering die?
[1:30:43] Would he devote that sacred head for
[1:30:50] such a worm as mine?
[1:30:55] At the cross, at the cross, where I
[1:30:59] first saw the light and the burden of my
[1:31:03] heart rode away.
[1:31:07] It was there by me. I received my sight
[1:31:13] and now I am happy all the day.
[1:31:19] Was it for crimes that I have done? He
[1:31:25] groaned upon a tree.
[1:31:30] Amazing
[1:31:32] pity.
[1:31:34] Grace unknown and love beyond degree.
[1:31:41] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[1:31:46] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[1:31:50] rode away.
[1:31:53] It was there by faith I received my
[1:31:58] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[1:32:04] Well,
[1:32:06] the sun in darkness is light and shut
[1:32:11] his glories in.
[1:32:16] In Christ the mighty
[1:32:19] maker died for men the creature sin.
[1:32:26] At the cross at the cross where I first
[1:32:31] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[1:32:35] ro away.
[1:32:38] It was there by faith. I received my
[1:32:42] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[1:32:51] But traps of grief and dare repay the
[1:32:57] debt of love I hold.
[1:33:02] Dear Lord, I give myself
[1:33:06] away is all that I can do.
[1:33:12] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[1:33:17] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[1:33:21] rode away.
[1:33:24] It was there by faith I received my
[1:33:28] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Where I first saw the light.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; But every time you open up the Bible,
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; you see more light. That's right.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Every time you come to church, every
[1:33:53] time you put a tape on, often
[1:33:56] often we get on our knees and we hear
[1:33:59] God speak to us. That's light where
[1:34:01] we're seeing more light.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; And God wants us to walk in that light.
[1:34:08] You know, I I don't know how many times
[1:34:10] I've ever looked back and saw
[1:34:14] didn't know why I was preaching what I
[1:34:16] was preaching, but it was leading up to
[1:34:18] what he was trying to get to.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; God wants us to walk in all the light.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; He really wants that blood of life.
[1:34:29] Amen. Let's bow our heart in a word of
[1:34:31] prayer. I wonder if there'd be anyone
[1:34:33] here today that say, "Brother John."
[1:34:37] I just appreciate special prayer for my
[1:34:40] house.
[1:34:42] God bless you. God bless you. Oh, so
[1:34:46] wonderful. So wonderful. All right,
[1:34:49] let's approach him in sincerity now. Our
[1:34:51] heavenly father, we just think about
[1:34:56] when you told your own prophet of this
[1:34:58] age to be more sincere.
[1:35:05] God,
[1:35:08] the first thing I want to ask you is
[1:35:09] just help us to be more sincere. Yes,
[1:35:14] I
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; think your word even says to prove the
[1:35:16] sincerity of our love.
[1:35:20] Keep your commandments to walk in your
[1:35:22] will.
[1:35:26] Thank you
[1:35:28] for sending a prophet to let us know
[1:35:31] what was required to make it.
[1:35:36] And God, all of us,
[1:35:39] we we've lifted our hands. We've we we
[1:35:43] know we have a part of you in us. Some
[1:35:48] are so full, but they want more.
[1:35:53] How beautiful that is.
[1:35:56] How beautiful.
[1:35:59] Lord, we're asking that you would fill
[1:36:01] every one of us with more of you.
[1:36:05] We want you to be on display. We don't
[1:36:07] want to be
[1:36:11] dealing with our our flesh
[1:36:14] in an outward way, but we want to keep
[1:36:17] him crucified.
[1:36:21] Lord, I pray that you would fill us so
[1:36:23] full that our cup would be running over
[1:36:25] like David talked about, "My cup runth
[1:36:28] over." Fill us with joy unspeakable.
[1:36:31] Give us so much joy. We can't wait to
[1:36:34] get to the house of the Lord. As brother
[1:36:35] Ron said, "Grant it, Lord. Fill us with
[1:36:40] more of you. More of you. Help us to to
[1:36:45] take your word when we read it, when we
[1:36:47] hear it, to eat it. Help us to know what
[1:36:49] it means to eat your word by simply
[1:36:53] applying it to our life,
[1:36:56] Lord. And when we do that, that blood is
[1:36:58] being applied. It's Jesus on the inside
[1:37:01] working on the outside. Lord, that's
[1:37:03] what we're asking. Work in us, Lord.
[1:37:07] Work in us. your will work in us to do
[1:37:11] what you want us to do, Lord. Father, I
[1:37:13] pray for our young people here,
[1:37:17] Lord, that are in that transition stage.
[1:37:21] How beautiful it is to get the Holy
[1:37:23] Ghost before you're at that age of
[1:37:26] accountability, which we know can
[1:37:28] happen.
[1:37:30] But Lord, waiting too long, it's a
[1:37:34] dangerous a dangerous place to be
[1:37:38] without the Holy Ghost. And I pray for
[1:37:40] every young person here that you would
[1:37:42] fill them with the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:45] God, keep them from the enemy. Put a
[1:37:48] hedge of protection around them, Lord.
[1:37:52] Lord, may they could they be able to
[1:37:55] just focus on trying to get your
[1:37:58] attention than the attention of one
[1:38:00] another.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we love you. We love you. We
[1:38:07] thank you for filling us with your
[1:38:09] spirit. We thank you for your promise
[1:38:12] that if we just seek you, you will you
[1:38:16] will reveal and you will show yourself.
[1:38:20] we keep knocking, if we keep asking,
[1:38:22] Lord, you're going to give us what we
[1:38:24] want because you gave us that example
[1:38:28] when that woman and that unjust judge.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Kept calling. Kept calling. Finally, he
[1:38:36] gave her what she wanted. Even though he
[1:38:38] wasn't a believer,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; how much more will you avenge your own
[1:38:44] elect that cried day and night? Yes,
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; God. Avenge us of our real adversary,
[1:38:50] this flesh,
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, and fill us with the goods, Lord.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you for these things. Now
[1:38:59] Lord, we pray that you'd bless these
[1:39:00] upcoming services that we're going to be
[1:39:02] having with these visiting ministers,
[1:39:06] oh God, starting this Sunday,
[1:39:09] Lord, and uh right throughout the next
[1:39:12] two weeks, we just ask that the word
[1:39:15] that would be preached would penetrate
[1:39:18] and and do a work inside of every one of
[1:39:22] our hearts, Lord. Amen.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I believe Lord that they're
[1:39:27] they're here in accordance uh to the
[1:39:30] working of the Holy Spirit. And I pray
[1:39:34] that every one of us could just receive
[1:39:37] more of you, heavenly father.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; We just pray your blessings on the
[1:39:41] services ahead. know we think.
