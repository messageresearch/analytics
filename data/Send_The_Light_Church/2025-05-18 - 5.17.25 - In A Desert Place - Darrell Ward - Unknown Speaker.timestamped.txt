[35:02] Brother Bill, we really appreciate you
[35:04] and just the sacrifice just to just to
[35:08] have strength to come here tonight and
[35:10] and ministering every service there and
[35:13] all that you're doing for the kingdom of
[35:14] God. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Let's
[35:17] stand together and let's welcome our
[35:19] brother Darl War from Tennessee now as
[35:21] he comes to give us the bread of life
[35:23] and let's sing only believe as our
[35:25] brother comes. God bless you brother
[35:27] Ray. Thank you for coming and blessing
[35:29] blessing our service. Amen. Amen.
[35:33] Appreciate the worship service too.
[35:37] Only
[35:41] believe.
[35:43] Only believe.
[35:46] All things are
[35:50] possible.
[35:52] Only
[35:55] believe.
[35:57] Only
[35:59] believe.
[36:01] Only
[36:04] believe. All things are
[36:08] possible.
[36:10] Only
[36:13] believe.
[36:14] Lord, I
[36:17] believe.
[36:19] Lord, I
[36:21] believe. Can you just sing that
[36:27] well?
[36:28] Only
[36:31] believe.
[36:32] Lord, I
[36:35] believe. Lord, I believe.
[36:41] All things are
[36:44] possible. Lord, I believe.
[36:51] Amen. Jesus said, "Do you now believe?"
[36:55] Yes. I'm so grateful we know what to
[36:57] believe. Aren't you? Yes. You know, this
[37:00] artificial
[37:02] intelligence, it's a way smarter than me
[37:04] already. I But it's amazing what they
[37:06] can do with that now. They can put you
[37:08] in a place you've never been and make it
[37:10] so real. Is that not right? And
[37:14] yet it's fake.
[37:17] It's not even real. True. So, we're
[37:19] living in a time when people don't even
[37:21] know what to believe anymore because
[37:22] they don't know if it's real or if it's
[37:24] not real. And we got fake news. You
[37:26] know, they got CNN says Fox is fake and
[37:29] Fox says CNN's fake. And I'm so glad
[37:32] we've got the good news. Aren't you?
[37:33] Amen. that in this time of darkness,
[37:36] he's led us into this marvelous light.
[37:39] And what a privilege it is to have a
[37:40] place to come and and and rest and feed
[37:44] off the the word of God. And 24 years
[37:46] that this place has been open that
[37:48] you've had uh to come and hear the word
[37:50] and prepare our hearts because we're
[37:52] going to leave here. Amen. It's closer
[37:55] today than it was yesterday. Amen. And
[37:58] we see what happened just just last week
[38:00] with the with the Pope coming out of the
[38:02] United States. exactly what the prophet
[38:03] of God said back in 1954
[38:06] that there would be a pope that will
[38:08] come from the United States this day.
[38:10] This prophecy has been fulfilled. We're
[38:12] not we're not just reading about visions
[38:14] and we're not reading about quotes.
[38:16] We're we're living them. You're in the
[38:18] vision. Hallelujah. You're in the
[38:20] vision. Amen. And so we see that this is
[38:23] the people this is the people that will
[38:26] take the rapture. Amen. Do you believe
[38:28] that there's people in this building
[38:30] right now that will not see death, but
[38:32] their bodies will be changed in a moment
[38:34] and a twinkling of an eye because it's
[38:36] been prophesied.
[38:37] And this is the generation. Amen. I
[38:40] believe that with all my heart. Amen.
[38:43] And we're feasting off the word body,
[38:45] the un the the unfailing word body of
[38:48] the son of man. Amen. And you are what
[38:50] you eat. Amen. Well, praise the Lord.
[38:54] It's certainly good to be here. I greet
[38:57] you in the name of the Lord Jesus. I
[38:58] didn't mean to get started that way, but
[39:00] it just starts bubbling up in your heart
[39:01] when you start talking about it. Amen.
[39:03] But we greet you in the name of the Lord
[39:05] Jesus. Kind of an honor to be with you
[39:06] once again. If you have your Bibles,
[39:07] turn with us tonight to the book of
[39:09] Exodus. Want to read from Exodus chapter
[39:11] 15, verse 11, and then we're going to
[39:14] jump down to verse 18 and read a little
[39:17] bit. And so, uh, we're just kind of an
[39:19] honor to be with you once again. We
[39:20] always enjoy coming up this way and
[39:21] spending time with brother John and his
[39:23] family and the church here. And it's
[39:25] good to see familiar faces and uh praise
[39:28] God pressing on for the kingdom of God.
[39:30] Amen. We bring you greetings from my
[39:32] church back home, my pastor, brother
[39:33] Donnie Reagan. And but it's kind of an
[39:35] honor to be with you this weekend. We
[39:37] trust something to be said to help you
[39:38] and encourage you. And if you're sick,
[39:40] you'll be healed. If you're weak, you'll
[39:41] be made strong. If you're lost, you'll
[39:43] be found.
[39:44] Amen. Because that's what our God does.
[39:48] Exodus 15 11 the Bible says this.
[39:54] Who is like unto thee, oh Lord? Amen.
[39:56] Among the gods. Amen. Who is like thee?
[40:00] Glorious in holiness, fearful in
[40:03] praises. Hallelujah. Doing wonders.
[40:07] Thank you, Jesus. Verse 18, the Lord
[40:10] shall reign forever and ever. Amen. For
[40:14] the horse of Pharaoh went in with his
[40:15] chariots and went his horsemen into the
[40:17] sea. And the Lord brought again the
[40:19] waters of the sea upon them. But the
[40:21] children of Israel went on dry land in
[40:23] the midst of the sea. And Miriam the
[40:26] prophet is the sister of Aaron took a
[40:28] timber in her hand. And all the women
[40:30] went out after her with timberalss and
[40:31] with dances. And Miam answered them,
[40:33] said, "Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath
[40:36] triumphed gloriously, for the horse and
[40:38] his rider hath he thrown into the sea."
[40:41] Praise the Lord. So Moses brought Israel
[40:43] from the Red Sea, and they went out into
[40:45] the wilderness of Sir, and they went
[40:47] three days in the wilderness, and they
[40:49] found no water. And when they came to
[40:52] Marra, they could not drink of the
[40:54] waters of Marra, for they were bitter.
[40:56] Therefore, the name of it was called
[40:58] Marra. And the people murmured against
[41:01] Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
[41:04] And he cried unto the Lord. And the Lord
[41:06] showed him a tree which when he had cast
[41:08] into the waters, the waters were made
[41:10] sweetise. And there he made for them a
[41:13] statue and an ordinance, and there he
[41:16] proved them. Yeah. And he said, "If thou
[41:19] will diligently hearken to the voice of
[41:21] the Lord thy God, and will do that which
[41:23] is right in his sight, and will give ear
[41:26] to his commandments, and keep all his
[41:29] statutes, not just the ones we want, I
[41:33] will put none of these diseases upon
[41:34] thee, which I have brought upon the
[41:36] Egyptians." And I love this right here.
[41:39] For I am the Lord that health thee.
[41:43] Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Let us bow our
[41:45] heads. Thank you. I want to speak to you
[41:47] for a few minutes this evening on in a
[41:50] desert
[41:52] place. Heavenly
[41:55] Father, Lord, as we gathered here this
[41:59] evening in your wonderful presence,
[42:03] we just want to thank you, Father, for
[42:05] all that you have done for us. Thank
[42:07] you, Lord. Yes, Jesus. And Lord, it's
[42:10] such a troublesome time that we are
[42:12] living in. And yet, Lord, in our hearts
[42:14] there is peace. For Lord, you told us
[42:17] these things would be here and we see
[42:20] them, Lord. But you said when these
[42:22] things begin to happen, you told us not
[42:25] to give up, but you told us to look up
[42:29] for our redemption drawth nigh. And
[42:31] Lord, the songs that we heard sung this
[42:33] evening, it turns our heart towards
[42:36] home, Lord, for that's where we long to
[42:39] be. True. Oh God, may we labor with
[42:43] everything that's within us, Lord, to
[42:44] press to that mark. For there come a
[42:47] time, dear God, when we'll set around
[42:49] the table and you'll come and wipe the
[42:51] tears from our eyes. Tell us, don't cry
[42:54] no more. It's all over. But until then,
[42:56] Lord, may we be faithful and help us
[42:59] tonight, Lord, to take this word and
[43:01] speak it to the hearts of your children.
[43:04] Lord, that our faith would be stirred,
[43:06] Lord, that we could rise up and receive
[43:08] those things which you've already done
[43:10] for us. And Lord, may the word become so
[43:13] real that when we leave the building,
[43:15] may we say, "Did not our hearts burn
[43:17] within us?" And Lord, as we've gathered
[43:20] here on this weekend to to honor the
[43:23] anniversary, dear God, of this
[43:26] tabernacle that's been here, Lord, a
[43:28] light, Lord, in the midst of darkness.
[43:30] We ask dear God if you would to Terry
[43:32] that the door would always be open Lord
[43:35] that the lost could be found and the
[43:37] sick could be healed. Bless brother John
[43:39] Lord and the officers of the church. Use
[43:42] them dear God to seek out that last seed
[43:45] here Lord for we know the prophet taught
[43:47] us that when that last one comes in
[43:50] you'll close the book and call for your
[43:52] bride. Lord until then let us labor. We
[43:55] commit this congregation and oursel into
[43:57] your hands for your glory. For we ask
[43:59] these things in Jesus name. And the
[44:02] bride says, "Amen." God bless you. You
[44:04] may be seated.
[44:07] Amen. Amen. You know, our scripture
[44:09] opens this evening with a declaration of
[44:12] how great is our God. And I'd like to
[44:16] say tonight that he is. He is a great
[44:19] God. There is no God like our God. Amen.
[44:23] You know, there's many gods in the world
[44:25] today. Can you say amen to that? The
[44:28] prophet of God said, "People make a god
[44:30] out of their job or they'll make a god
[44:32] their car." And the Hindus have
[44:34] thousands of gods. Right? But there is
[44:36] no god like our God. Amen. Amen. There's
[44:40] none like him. Amen. But Isaiah said,
[44:43] "Remember the former things of old, for
[44:45] I am God and there is none else. I am
[44:48] God and there is none like me." He is
[44:52] the true and living God. Yes, he is. You
[44:55] know, brother David Silent one time, and
[44:56] I think I've said it here before, but it
[44:58] just comes to my to my memory that
[45:00] brother David Siler said he was over in
[45:02] India and he saw a man take a piece of
[45:04] wood and he fashioned him out of God
[45:07] with that piece of wood. And he David
[45:09] said, I watched him set that idol down
[45:11] and worship it. A God that he made with
[45:15] his own hands. And brother David said as
[45:16] I watched him, he said, "I thought
[45:18] within myself, I am so glad that I don't
[45:21] worship a God that I made with my hands,
[45:23] but I worship a God who made me with his
[45:26] hands." Amen. And I'm so glad that the
[45:29] that the God we serve is not a dead god
[45:32] of stone.
[45:34] Not a God that we pray to and we cry out
[45:36] to, but he has no ability to answer
[45:38] back. That he has no ability to heal us.
[45:40] That he has no ability to deliver us or
[45:43] sustain us. I'm so glad that we don't
[45:45] serve a God of someone's imagination.
[45:47] True. But we serve the God who answers
[45:50] back. We serve the living God tonight.
[45:53] He is almighty. Amen. He is all
[45:55] powerful. He is full of mercy. He is
[45:59] love. And we can cry out to him and he
[46:02] hears our cry and he sees our tears and
[46:06] our God has the ability to answer back.
[46:11] Amen. Aren't you glad of that tonight?
[46:14] He told Moses, he said, "I have heard
[46:16] the cry of my people and I am come down
[46:19] to deliver them." Jeremiah 33:3 said it
[46:22] this way, "Call unto me and I will
[46:25] answer thee."
[46:28] Not could be, not maybe, not hope so,
[46:30] but he said, "If you call, I will answer
[46:33] and show you great and mighty things
[46:35] which thou knowest not." You know, I
[46:38] think of Jonah in the belly of a whale.
[46:40] A man who had more circumstances, who
[46:42] had more symptoms against him than any
[46:44] man I know. Anybody here ever been
[46:47] swapped by fish?
[46:50] Jonah was.
[46:52] Jonah was. And he said, "I cried out to
[46:54] the Lord." Jonah prayed unto the Lord
[46:56] his God out of a fish's belly. And he
[46:59] said, I cried by the reason of my
[47:01] affliction. Unto the Lord, and he heard
[47:05] me. Out of belly of hell cried I, and
[47:08] thou heardest my voice.
[47:14] Think about it. If God could hear the,
[47:16] you know, the prophet said that when a
[47:17] fish eats, you put in a fish in a
[47:19] fishbowl, and when it eats, where does
[47:21] it go? Right to the bottom of the
[47:22] fishbowl. True. And so this fish
[47:25] swallowed a man and he went right to the
[47:27] bottom of the ocean. And here's a man in
[47:30] a fish's belly at the bottom of the sea.
[47:33] But he said, "I cried out to the Lord
[47:36] from the fish's belly and he heard my
[47:39] cry." Amen. You said, "What are you
[47:42] saying, preacher?" I'm saying this. If
[47:43] God could hear the cry of a man in the
[47:45] belly of a well at the bottom of the
[47:47] ocean, cannot he hear our cry tonight in
[47:50] a building that's been set aside to
[47:51] honor him and worship him. Hallelujah.
[47:55] Amen. David said in Psalms 18:6, "In my
[47:59] distress, I called unto the Lord. I
[48:01] cried unto my God, and he heard my voice
[48:05] out of his temple, and my cry came up
[48:08] before him, even into his ears." Praise.
[48:12] That's the God we serve. Who is like
[48:14] thee, oh Lord, among the gods? Who is
[48:18] like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful
[48:21] in praises, doing wonders. He's a wonder
[48:26] working God. Amen. Amen. Glory. Praise
[48:31] the Lord. I said he's a wonder working
[48:34] God.
[48:38] Let me say that again. I said he's a
[48:40] wonderworking God. Amen. That's much
[48:44] better. That's our God. We're not
[48:47] bragging on a man. We're not bragging on
[48:49] organiz We're bragging on the God of
[48:51] glory. Amen. Hallelujah. Doing wonders.
[48:55] He's a wonderworking God. And when he
[48:58] went down to Egypt, wonders he done. He
[49:00] brought his children out of bondage with
[49:02] the mighty hand and drowned Pharaoh's
[49:04] army in the sea. Amen. And the Bible
[49:08] said that his children went across on
[49:11] dry ground
[49:14] here. Not long ago where I'm from,
[49:15] there's a lake called Wata Lake. And
[49:17] they they damned up the river many, many
[49:19] years ago. And when they did, there was
[49:21] a city there by the name of Butler, the
[49:23] old city of Butler. And when they damned
[49:25] up the river there, and the water backed
[49:27] up into that valley, it took the city of
[49:29] Butler underwater.
[49:31] and 40s years, something like that, uh
[49:33] the the dam had been there and that the
[49:36] the dam developed a
[49:37] leak and so the TVA had to let the water
[49:41] down in order to repair the dam. And
[49:43] when they did, the old city of Butler
[49:45] came up out of water and the T TV tva
[49:48] TVA, Tennessee Valley of Authority, they
[49:50] came in with bulldozers and graded out
[49:53] the old road and let the people who once
[49:55] lived there and anybody that wanted to
[49:56] go see it to go down and see the old
[49:58] city. Now, most of the buildings were
[50:00] gone, but the old jail was still there.
[50:01] You could actually look into it. And so,
[50:03] me and my brothers went down there, and
[50:05] we was walking on the road that was
[50:07] bulldozed. Of course, it was muddy. And
[50:08] there was the jail. And I wanted to look
[50:10] inside of it because I'm
[50:12] nosy. And so, I got off the road that
[50:15] they had graded out to look over into
[50:17] the jail. And when I stepped over into
[50:19] that, I sunk up above my ankles in mud.
[50:23] And I thought my brothers were going to
[50:25] pull my feet off trying to get me out of
[50:27] that mud. You say, "Why do you say
[50:29] that?" I say that to say this. How long
[50:31] the Red Sea had been there, I don't
[50:33] know. But the Bible said that when God
[50:35] parted the water, he dried up the ground
[50:37] that when the children of Israel went
[50:39] across, their feet didn't even get
[50:41] muddy.
[50:43] Hallelujah. That's the God we serve. God
[50:45] said, "I care so much for you, I don't
[50:47] even want your shoes to get muddy."
[50:51] That's a wonderworking God. And when he
[50:54] went down to Egypt, he proved every god
[50:56] of the Egyptians was a dead god and that
[50:58] he was the god who delivered his people.
[51:01] Amen. The Egyptians had a god by the
[51:03] name of Ray. Re the ray, it was a son
[51:06] god. But God three days of darkness upon
[51:09] Egypt, but their god could not take the
[51:12] darkness away. And God proved to them,
[51:14] "Your God is a dead God, but I am the
[51:16] true and living God."
[51:19] And when God went down to Egypt, he done
[51:21] wonders. And when God comes to your
[51:23] Egypt, oh yeah, he does wonders. Amen.
[51:27] He'll break the chains of oppression.
[51:29] He'll break the bondage of depression.
[51:31] He'll break Come on, somebody. That's
[51:33] the God we serve. Hallelujah.
[51:36] Hallelujah. A wonder working God. And
[51:39] when Miam saw her enemy was dead, she
[51:42] didn't nod her head and raise her head.
[51:44] That's pretty good. No, no, no. She
[51:46] grabbed a tambourine and up and down the
[51:48] bank she went, beating on the
[51:50] tambourine, praising God. Amen. Oh my.
[51:53] And the daughter's following after her.
[51:55] That's the kind of church service I want
[51:56] to be in. Keep the one that's got some
[51:58] life. Amen.
[52:02] Hallelujah.
[52:04] Beating the tambourine shouting why.
[52:06] There laid the ones who had beat them,
[52:07] who had abused him, who had been mean to
[52:10] them. And there they were washed up on
[52:12] the banks dead. Amen. Brother, it was
[52:15] time to dance. Yeah. because the ones
[52:18] who had brought so much sorrow into
[52:20] their life was dead.
[52:24] Well, I tell you, brother Daryl, when I
[52:26] get to heaven, I'm really going to
[52:28] shout. I'm really going to dance. I
[52:31] guess you must be saving your energy.
[52:35] Well, when I get there, Brother Daryl,
[52:36] I'm going to have a good time. But you
[52:38] know what I say to you tonight? I say if
[52:40] you can see the promises of God are for
[52:41] you. If you can see that he's your
[52:43] deliverer. If you can see he's done
[52:45] spoke us in a rapture. If you can see we
[52:48] have a pillar of fire and a prophet
[52:49] messenger. And the God who led them out
[52:51] of the first Exodus is the same God
[52:53] that's leading us out of this Exodus. I
[52:55] tell you we can shout now. We can dance
[52:57] now. Hallelujah. Our enemy is defeated.
[53:02] Do you believe that tonight the prophet
[53:04] said we are dealing with a defeated
[53:06] enemy? Sickness is defeated. Death is
[53:09] defeated. Hell is defeated. Everything
[53:12] is defeated.
[53:15] You are disputing with a conquered
[53:19] enemy.
[53:20] People come up for prayer say, "Well,
[53:21] the devil said this and the devil said
[53:23] that." Do you
[53:25] realize you're arguing with a defeated
[53:27] enemy? Yes, sir. Well, the devil said
[53:30] this. You know he's a liar, right?
[53:36] Amen. You say, "Well, that's pretty
[53:37] good, brother Daryl." But you know, I'm
[53:38] the least one in this church. And maybe
[53:41] you
[53:42] are. Maybe you are. Maybe you're just
[53:45] not being humble. Maybe you're being
[53:47] truthful. The least one. You know, we
[53:49] make up. We're the body. A body of
[53:51] believers. Is that right? And the body
[53:53] is made up of what? Many, many members.
[53:56] Many different members. I'm glad I'm not
[53:58] all thumb.
[54:02] Aren't you? Amen. I'm glad I got some
[54:05] eyes to see. Amen. and a mouth to eat
[54:08] and a tongue to enjoy the flavor. I'm
[54:10] glad for that. And so in this body of
[54:13] believers, they are many different
[54:15] parts.
[54:16] And maybe you are the least in the body.
[54:20] The least one. You said, "Brother, I'm
[54:22] just the souls of the feet of the body
[54:25] of Christ." And maybe that's what you
[54:27] really are. Right there. You know where
[54:29] that little toe, that crease, where the
[54:30] little toe meets the bottom of your
[54:32] foot? Maybe that's the part of the body
[54:33] that you are. Nothing wrong with it.
[54:36] You're in the body. That's right. But
[54:38] you see what I'm trying to say is if
[54:40] that's who you are, if that's really who
[54:42] you are, guess what? Every enemy is
[54:44] still under your feet.
[54:47] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. You say you got a
[54:50] quote on that. Thank you. I believe I
[54:52] do. You say, "Brother Brandham, I'm the
[54:53] least one." I'm the sos of his feet.
[54:58] But remember, he's triumphed with you.
[55:00] He's triumphed with you over every bit
[55:02] of it. Even if you're the sos of his
[55:04] feet, every sickness, every devil, every
[55:07] power, even death itself is under your
[55:11] feet. It's under you. Amen. This is the
[55:14] truth. If I could just get the church to
[55:16] see that, brother will be a triumph
[55:18] church, believers in him. All evil under
[55:22] him. You need to tell Satan tonight.
[55:24] Satan, you are under my feet. Amen.
[55:29] And on the banks of the Red Sea, they
[55:31] were having a hallelujah time, a big
[55:33] time, a great revival, a great victory.
[55:36] And here they go through the
[55:38] wilderness on their journey, marching,
[55:41] following the message of a prophet,
[55:42] following the pillar of fire, on their
[55:44] way to a promised land, being led by a
[55:47] God who can not fail. Thank you, Jesus.
[55:51] And three days into the journey, they
[55:53] find their first test. They find theirel
[55:57] in a desert place with no water. Three
[56:02] days they marched, all the families, all
[56:04] the cattle, all the animals, all the
[56:06] mules. Remember, remember Moses said,
[56:08] "When we leave, we're not leaving a hoof
[56:10] behind. We're taking everything with
[56:12] us."
[56:14] And here they marched. A single day in
[56:16] the wilderness without water would have
[56:17] been tolerable. Two days would have been
[56:19] difficult, but three days would be
[56:21] almost impossible, especially for
[56:24] children. Well, and for the animals,
[56:28] three days with no
[56:31] water. And after three days, someone up
[56:34] ahead yells,
[56:35] "Water! There's water! There's a
[56:39] fountain of water." Oh my. And the
[56:42] animals begin to smell it and start
[56:43] trying to break. The kids begin to run
[56:45] and someone gets there first and
[56:50] just get back. Get Get the animals back.
[56:54] Get the kids back. What's the matter?
[56:57] What's
[56:58] wrong? We can't drink the
[57:05] water.
[57:07] Why? It's
[57:10] bitter. It's bitter. Keep the kids back.
[57:13] Get back. Think about it. Three days
[57:16] with no water. They'd have been willing
[57:18] to drink anything.
[57:20] But God made this water so bitter that
[57:24] they could not drink it.
[57:28] You see, sometimes God will make a trial
[57:30] so hard, he'll make the water so bitter
[57:34] that you can expect nothing less than a
[57:36] miracle that you would look nowhere else
[57:39] but to him.
[57:43] Amen. the disappointment of finding
[57:46] water only to realize it would have been
[57:49] better to find no water at all than to
[57:52] find water that you couldn't drink.
[57:58] It would only make the situation worse
[58:01] to be so thirsty and there's a fountain
[58:04] of
[58:05] water and you can't drink
[58:08] it. to be so thirsty, to be so dry, the
[58:12] dust from the desert, the sweat, the
[58:14] weariness, to find water. And it's so
[58:17] bitter to hear the children say, "Mama,
[58:20] please, mama. Mama, please let me drink
[58:22] that water." No,
[58:25] honey. Mama can't let you drink
[58:28] it. It's bitter.
[58:34] Why would he do that?
[58:37] Why would he lead us to water? It'd be
[58:39] bitter. All right, we're his people. We
[58:42] follow his message. We listen to
[58:45] Moses. Why the bitter water? And they
[58:48] cried, "Marra, ma!" They named the place
[58:51] the land of bitter
[58:54] water. Just three days before they were
[58:58] singing and shouting how great their God
[59:01] was in the Red Sea revival.
[59:06] And three days later, the same ones that
[59:08] were screaming hallelujah and glory to
[59:11] God. Now the same voices are murmuring
[59:14] and complaining and scared and upset.
[59:18] How soon they forgot
[59:21] the Red Sea revival.
[59:24] How quickly their countenance changed
[59:26] when they arrived in Marra, the bitter
[59:29] land. And it's in those
[59:32] moments when the doctor says, "I'm
[59:34] sorry." When you lose your job, when
[59:37] bitterness comes in your marriage,
[59:38] disappointment, a situation turns
[59:40] against you. It's those moments
[59:43] that Satan takes advantage and starts
[59:46] spewing Oh yes, his lies.
[59:51] Can you imagine the lies he tempted to
[59:52] overtake them with? Satan began to
[59:56] whisper into their ear, "This God of
[59:58] yours
[59:59] delivered you out of Egypt." Oh, sure
[1:00:01] they beat you, but you had food. You had
[1:00:04] water to bring you out here and leave
[1:00:06] you in a desert three days with no water
[1:00:08] to die. Tempt you with water that you
[1:00:12] can't even drink. Some god you serve.
[1:00:14] Some cruel god. Oh yeah. And it's in
[1:00:18] those moments every fear surfaced and
[1:00:21] they only saw death.
[1:00:24] It was a bitter situation.
[1:00:28] Indeed. You see the devil only wants you
[1:00:31] to see the MRI. Right? He only wants you
[1:00:34] to see the X-ray. He only wants you to
[1:00:36] see the drug addiction, the marital
[1:00:38] situation, the fear, the pain, the no
[1:00:40] way out situation. He wants you to see
[1:00:43] the storm,
[1:00:45] but not the sun.
[1:00:48] I was in a bad storm the other day
[1:00:50] flying. We had to land over in
[1:00:51] Charlotte, North Carolina. Sat there for
[1:00:53] about an hour waiting for the storm to
[1:00:54] pass. And when Oh my, I'm telling you,
[1:00:56] you talking about people screaming and
[1:00:57] crying on an airplane. They grown-ups
[1:00:59] yelling and the yelping and the carrying
[1:01:01] on. And we took off and that plane
[1:01:02] rattled and rocked and dove and shook
[1:01:04] and people was crying, kids were crying.
[1:01:06] But all of a sudden we broke through
[1:01:08] that and guess what? I saw the sun.
[1:01:13] Oh God, it was there the whole time.
[1:01:20] The devil wants you to see the storm but
[1:01:23] not the s. That's right. Amen. But think
[1:01:27] about this for a minute. Have you ever
[1:01:28] thought about this? The Red Sea was a
[1:01:31] water problem. It was a big water
[1:01:34] problem. And God moved for that water
[1:01:36] problem. So if God can fix one water
[1:01:40] problem, well, can he take care of
[1:01:43] another water problem? Yes, sir.
[1:01:46] You see, the Red Sea and the bitter
[1:01:47] water was both water
[1:01:50] problems. You say, "What are you
[1:01:52] saying?" I'm saying this. If he can heal
[1:01:53] cancer of the skin, can he heal cancer
[1:01:55] of the bone? Cancer of the liver, cancer
[1:01:57] of the breast, cancer of the esophagus,
[1:01:59] cancer of the brain. If he can bring one
[1:02:01] prodical home, can he bring all
[1:02:02] prodicals home? If he can fix one
[1:02:04] marriage, can he fix yours? If he could
[1:02:07] deliver you once, if he delivered you
[1:02:09] once, cannot he do it again?
[1:02:12] Anybody here ever been delivered of God?
[1:02:14] Anybody here ever been touched of God?
[1:02:16] And I say, if God ever touched you once,
[1:02:18] cannot that God do it again? I say, yes,
[1:02:20] he can.
[1:02:23] Glory. But all they saw was death. All
[1:02:26] they saw was bitter, undrinkable water
[1:02:29] in a desert place. And the people
[1:02:32] murmured against
[1:02:34] Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
[1:02:38] You see, God was leading them to the
[1:02:40] promised land that he said was theirs.
[1:02:42] Why wouldn't he bypass the land of
[1:02:44] bitterness? He's God. He knows all
[1:02:46] things. He knew the water was there.
[1:02:48] Yeah. Why didn't he just bypass it? But
[1:02:51] he led them right straight to the bitter
[1:02:54] water.
[1:02:56] You see, where the Israelites didn't see
[1:02:57] a way, God did.
[1:03:02] Hallelujah. He was the way.
[1:03:08] The test for the Israelites was a
[1:03:10] question of faith and what they couldn't
[1:03:13] see. Yes. Without the bitter water,
[1:03:16] there have been no opportunity for God
[1:03:19] to perform a miracle that day. And the
[1:03:21] most difficult situations in our life is
[1:03:24] opportunities for God to do the
[1:03:25] miraculous and to turn our bitter
[1:03:28] situations sweet to show us just how
[1:03:32] great he is. You see, God could say,
[1:03:35] "I'm a great God. I'm a good God. I'm a
[1:03:37] healer. I'm a deliverer." And we would
[1:03:39] have said, "Yes, Lord." But he didn't
[1:03:42] want it to be a head knowledge.
[1:03:45] Because you do not serve God by
[1:03:46] knowledge. We serve God by faith. Amen.
[1:03:51] And you've got two sets of eyes. Do you
[1:03:53] know that? You got eyes in your head and
[1:03:55] you got a set of eyes in your heart. And
[1:03:58] Satan chose man's head. Satan chose the
[1:04:00] eyes of your head. But God didn't choose
[1:04:04] that. God chose to lead you by the eyes
[1:04:06] of your heart. We look to the unseen.
[1:04:09] For it is the unseen things that are
[1:04:11] real. And the Bible says we walk by
[1:04:13] faith and not by
[1:04:16] sight. But you can't walk by both at the
[1:04:18] same time.
[1:04:20] Well, it's getting quieter and quieter
[1:04:22] about it.
[1:04:26] Think about it. And so God, he just
[1:04:29] didn't want us to know by head
[1:04:31] knowledge.
[1:04:32] Huh? You know, let me let me explain it
[1:04:36] this way.
[1:04:37] My daughter Jessica was blinded in the
[1:04:39] accident and I kept telling her when she
[1:04:41] was little, I said, "Now Kai, you'll see
[1:04:43] me again because God provided a lamb for
[1:04:45] your eyes." And one day her eyes came
[1:04:48] open. And so somebody in the community
[1:04:51] heard the story about how I told her
[1:04:53] that God provided a lamb for because you
[1:04:54] know the prophet said in Bible days that
[1:04:56] a that a lamb was a CNI animal like the
[1:04:58] dog is today and they used a lamb to get
[1:05:00] around with. And I told her, I said,
[1:05:01] "God pro, the same God that provided a
[1:05:04] lamb for blind Barnameus provided a lamb
[1:05:06] for your eyes." And she believed me and
[1:05:08] her eyes come open. And so somebody
[1:05:09] heard the story and they brought Jessica
[1:05:11] a little lamb. Praise the Lord. And gave
[1:05:14] it to her. Well, the lamb was free, but
[1:05:17] the electric fence to put it in was
[1:05:18] about 200
[1:05:20] bucks, but that was all right, you
[1:05:24] know. And so I told Jessica, I said,
[1:05:26] "Now, Kai," I said, "Listen, you see
[1:05:29] that right there? If that light is on
[1:05:30] that box, that fence is hot. If you
[1:05:32] touch it, it'll burn you. I said, "Now,
[1:05:34] if you want to pet the lamb, you tell
[1:05:36] daddy, I'll unplug the box and you can
[1:05:38] pet the lamb." I said, "But if that
[1:05:39] light's on and you touch that wire,
[1:05:41] it'll shock you. It'll burn you." You
[1:05:43] understand? Yes, Daddy. Intellectual
[1:05:46] conception. So, I was over there working
[1:05:48] on a tractor in another field that
[1:05:49] backslid on
[1:05:51] me, and I saw her heading down towards
[1:05:53] that lamb. And before I could get
[1:05:54] through the fence to get to where she
[1:05:56] was at, she grabbed a hold of that wire.
[1:05:58] She had a Oh my She had a Pentecostal
[1:06:04] jubilee. So I climbed through the fence
[1:06:06] and went over to check on her and I'll
[1:06:07] never forget it. Brother, she's holding
[1:06:09] her hand just like this right here. And
[1:06:11] she looked up at me with big old blue
[1:06:12] eyes and tears pouring down her face
[1:06:14] like this. And she said, "Don't touch
[1:06:17] that wire, Daddy. It's hot."
[1:06:21] You see, before it was me telling her,
[1:06:24] but after she experienced it, it was her
[1:06:27] telling me. And God just didn't want to
[1:06:29] tell you, "I'm a healer." He wanted you
[1:06:30] to say, "You're a healer. You're a
[1:06:32] deliverer." Come on, somebody. And how
[1:06:34] do we know that? By experience.
[1:06:37] Amen. Hallelujah. He want us to see just
[1:06:40] how great he is. Amen. The murmurss and
[1:06:43] complain against God. What did it do? It
[1:06:45] made Moses cry out to God. And if you
[1:06:48] want your bitterness healed, then take
[1:06:50] the case to God in prayer. Because why?
[1:06:54] Prayer is the greatest weapon ever
[1:06:56] placed in the hand
[1:06:58] of mankind.
[1:07:00] You see, God begins by making us begin.
[1:07:04] Look at Jonah. Jonah, he said, "I cried
[1:07:07] out to the Lord." Why? By the reason of
[1:07:10] my affliction. The affliction caused him
[1:07:13] to cry out.
[1:07:16] Amen.
[1:07:19] Amen. He begins by making us begin. Yes.
[1:07:22] And the people complained to Moses and
[1:07:24] Moses took the complaint to his master.
[1:07:26] In all the trials of our life, the shest
[1:07:28] way to victory is through prayer. You
[1:07:32] see the power of your prayer, man nor
[1:07:35] demon can stand against it.
[1:07:39] The prophet of God said, "Your prayer is
[1:07:41] more powerful than an atomic bomb."
[1:07:47] You can see why the
[1:07:49] devil makes sure you don't have enough
[1:07:51] time to pray. Ain't that right? We have
[1:07:54] time for everything but our prayer time.
[1:07:56] Well, preacher, I'm trying to
[1:08:00] Amen. You can go all day without getting
[1:08:01] a text and you go in your prayer closet
[1:08:03] to pray.
[1:08:07] The power of prayer in the
[1:08:10] hand of a believer. You see, as soon as
[1:08:14] you have a prayer, God has a remedy.
[1:08:18] Even no, no, let me take it. Even before
[1:08:20] you pray, God has the answer. I was in
[1:08:23] Chief, Alaska, and there's a sister came
[1:08:25] up, Sister Bernie, Sister Bernie Boy,
[1:08:28] and she came up and standing at the
[1:08:30] front and I come. I said, "Sister, you
[1:08:31] need something from the Lord." And she
[1:08:33] said, "I want my son Dale to come to
[1:08:35] church." Now, Chievac is an Eskimo
[1:08:36] village about 150 mi below the Arctic
[1:08:38] Circle. No red lights, no stop signs.
[1:08:40] It's just a village. They have
[1:08:41] snowmobiles in the winter and
[1:08:43] four-wheelers in the summer. And it's
[1:08:45] just a village of about 1,200 people and
[1:08:47] all the teenage drugs and suicide rate
[1:08:49] is real high among the young people. And
[1:08:51] so she's concerned about her son Dell
[1:08:53] because he's starting to run around with
[1:08:54] the wrong crowd. And she said, "I want
[1:08:56] Dell to come to church." And she started
[1:08:59] talking and just the the love of a
[1:09:00] mother for her child, it just broke out
[1:09:02] of her. She began to weep and just was
[1:09:04] talking and pouring all this stuff out,
[1:09:06] telling me all this stuff. And I was
[1:09:07] down like this cuz I sometimes I have a
[1:09:09] trouble hearing. And I was down like
[1:09:10] this and I looked up and I saw the back
[1:09:12] door open and this boy come walking in
[1:09:14] and stood right behind her. And I said,
[1:09:16] "Sister Bernie, ain't that
[1:09:18] Dale?" And when she turned around and
[1:09:21] saw Oh, God. When she turned around and
[1:09:23] saw Dale standing behind her, we had
[1:09:25] church that night.
[1:09:28] Before we ever even
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:33] prayed. Amen. The Bible says, "And he
[1:09:36] cried unto the Lord, and the Lord showed
[1:09:37] him a tree, and when he had cast it into
[1:09:39] the water, the waters were made sweet,
[1:09:41] and there he made for them a statue and
[1:09:42] an ordinance, and there he proved him."
[1:09:44] You see, the answer to their bitterness,
[1:09:47] the answer to the bitter water was
[1:09:50] always there.
[1:09:53] Before they ever knew they had a
[1:09:54] problem, the answer was already there.
[1:09:58] Amen.
[1:10:00] Here not long ago, back before COVID,
[1:10:02] every second week in February, I
[1:10:04] preached down in Man, Louisiana. I done
[1:10:06] it for several several years. Second
[1:10:08] week in February, every year. And so
[1:10:09] about November, I would go and get the
[1:10:11] ticket cuz sometimes, you know, you get
[1:10:12] it in advance, you get a better price on
[1:10:14] the ticket. And so I went ahead and got
[1:10:15] the ticket, went ahead and got my seat
[1:10:17] where I was going to sit. So it come
[1:10:18] time I went down there, preached. So
[1:10:20] they brought me up to Alexander,
[1:10:21] Louisiana to fly home. So I get in the
[1:10:23] seat that I picked out in November. And
[1:10:25] I was sitting there and a man come sat
[1:10:26] down beside me. He said, "Good morning."
[1:10:28] And I said, "Howdy." He said, "Howdy."
[1:10:29] He said, "Where are you from?" I said,
[1:10:31] "Thennessee?" He said, "These
[1:10:33] Tennessee." I said, "Yes, sir." He said,
[1:10:34] "Well, what brings you down here to
[1:10:35] Louisiana?" I said, "I'm a preacher."
[1:10:37] "Oh, you're a preacher." I said, "Yes,
[1:10:41] sir." He said, "Well, since you're a
[1:10:43] preacher, let me ask you a question." I
[1:10:45] said, "Well, sir, I'm not the sharpest
[1:10:46] knife in the drawer, but if I can help
[1:10:48] you, I'd be glad to do it."
[1:10:50] And he said, "My daughter was getting
[1:10:52] her kids ready to bring me to the
[1:10:54] airport and he said, "I was looking on
[1:10:55] the internet and he said, I come across
[1:10:57] something so unusual, I want to ask you
[1:10:59] about it." I said, "Well, if I can help
[1:11:00] you, I'd be glad to do it." He said,
[1:11:02] "Have you ever heard of a man by the
[1:11:03] name of William Brandon?"
[1:11:06] And I said, "Yes, sir. His grandkids go
[1:11:08] to my church." He never sat like you're
[1:11:10] all sitting right there. He never hushed
[1:11:12] the whole time from M from Alexander,
[1:11:15] Louisiana to Atlanta, Georgia. He never
[1:11:18] stopped talking. And when we got off the
[1:11:20] plane, I shook his hand. God bless you,
[1:11:21] brother. He went to a big Pentecostal
[1:11:22] church, 1500 people. He said, "Would you
[1:11:24] come and preach for us?" I said, "Yeah,
[1:11:25] I'll be glad to come." But he said,
[1:11:27] "Well, I'm not the pastor, but I'm going
[1:11:28] to tell him about you." I thought,
[1:11:29] "Well, I was we'll see, you know."
[1:11:33] And so anyway, shook his hand, you know,
[1:11:35] went on down the he went that way and I
[1:11:37] was going down concourse D. Brother
[1:11:38] John. I got to thinking three months
[1:11:41] before that man ever knew he had a
[1:11:44] question, God had the answer set beside
[1:11:46] him. Come on. You see, if he had asked
[1:11:49] anybody else on that plane, they
[1:11:50] probably said, "No, sir. Never heard of
[1:11:52] them."
[1:11:55] That's our God.
[1:11:58] Amen. You want to hear another one?
[1:12:00] Yeah.
[1:12:02] I was down in Mexico in Quanoo, the
[1:12:04] southern part of Mexico, and there's a
[1:12:05] brother down there, and I said,
[1:12:06] "Brother, what can we do to help you?"
[1:12:08] He said, "We need Bibles." He said,
[1:12:10] "I've got people in my church that's
[1:12:12] never owned a Bible." And I thought, "My
[1:12:14] Lord, how many do I have at my house?
[1:12:18] And I said, "Well, how many do you
[1:12:19] need?" He said, "If we could get a
[1:12:21] thousand." I said, "A thousand." He
[1:12:23] said, "I'm I'm not talking about one
[1:12:24] like this." He said, "I'm talking just a
[1:12:26] simple paperback Bible." You know, you
[1:12:28] can get them at the Dollar Tree for a
[1:12:30] dollar. He said, "If we could just," he
[1:12:32] said, "We can give everybody in the
[1:12:33] church a Bible, and then when we witness
[1:12:35] on the street, we can pass Bibles out."
[1:12:37] And I said, "Well, I I I won't promise
[1:12:39] you, but I'll go home and see what I can
[1:12:40] do." So, I go home and I talk to my
[1:12:41] brother-in-law. He's Sunday school
[1:12:43] superintendent there at the church, you
[1:12:44] know, and so the kids started bringing
[1:12:46] their money in. And it wasn't long after
[1:12:47] that, we had quite a bit of money. So I
[1:12:49] called brother Bernay Espanola. He was
[1:12:50] my interpreter down in Mexico. And I
[1:12:52] said, you know, Bernay, I said, I was
[1:12:53] thinking instead of us buying the Bibles
[1:12:55] in the US and trying to get them across
[1:12:57] the border, cuz everybody wants a
[1:12:58] handout. Sometimes you pay more getting
[1:13:00] it through customs than you do for what
[1:13:01] you paid for the thing you're bringing
[1:13:02] through customs. Cuz everybody wants a
[1:13:04] handout. I said, "Maybe we can get them
[1:13:06] printed in Mexico and save that cost."
[1:13:08] He said, "Well, I'll check." So he
[1:13:09] called me back. He said, "Bro, I found a
[1:13:11] man who said he would print a thousand
[1:13:13] and seven Bibles for the amount of money
[1:13:15] that we had or he would print a thousand
[1:13:16] and we'd have a little bit of money left
[1:13:18] over." He said, "What do you want to
[1:13:19] do?" I said, "Tell him just to print a
[1:13:21] thousand and seven." So he prints a 107.
[1:13:23] They get the Bibles ready and they got
[1:13:25] this big bus, you know, like a Greyhound
[1:13:26] bus with the open up the doors at the
[1:13:27] bottom of it. Had all these Bibles
[1:13:29] underneath it. And so the brothers got
[1:13:30] on the bus up there in the northern
[1:13:32] part, Madam Morris, Mexico, and drove
[1:13:34] the bus. The bus went down to the
[1:13:35] southern part with the Bibles. I flew
[1:13:37] down to be there when the brother got
[1:13:38] the Bibles because I wanted to see him.
[1:13:40] And so on the way down through there,
[1:13:42] they got stopped by Mexican soldiers,
[1:13:43] made everybody get off the bus, search
[1:13:45] the bus and all that. So when they
[1:13:46] pulled up those doors, there was all
[1:13:47] these boxes. And this Mexican soldier
[1:13:49] said, "What's in those boxes?" Brother
[1:13:51] Man said, "They're Bibles." He said,
[1:13:53] "Bibles?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said,
[1:13:55] "What are you doing? You selling
[1:13:56] Bibles?" Said, "No, we're not selling
[1:13:58] them." Said, "We're giving them away."
[1:13:59] So we're taking them down to Quanoo to
[1:14:01] give away. He said, "You're giving away
[1:14:02] these B?" He said, "We're giving them
[1:14:04] away." He said, 'Well, if you're given
[1:14:05] away, would you give us a Bible? Brother
[1:14:08] Ben said, "Sure. How many of the are
[1:14:09] you?"
[1:14:12] Said, "There's seven of us."
[1:14:20] Oh, God. That's the God we serve.
[1:14:24] Before they ever knew they had a
[1:14:26] problem, the answer was already there.
[1:14:28] That tree had been growing there for
[1:14:30] years. The answer to your fear, the
[1:14:32] answer to your sickness, the answer to
[1:14:34] your problem was here before you ever
[1:14:36] even had the problem. Amen. You see,
[1:14:39] there's two reports before you. The
[1:14:40] doctor's report and Isaiah's report.
[1:14:43] Amen. Now, I worked in surgery for
[1:14:45] years. I've been on thousands of
[1:14:47] operations. Literally thousands of
[1:14:49] operations. You need your gallbladder
[1:14:51] out, see me after
[1:14:53] church. But there's one thing I learned.
[1:14:56] The doctor's report can be 100% correct.
[1:14:59] And it can be 100% wrong.
[1:15:02] I've seen it. I'm a witness. I have seen
[1:15:04] it with my own eyes. Matter of fact,
[1:15:06] there's a man back our way in
[1:15:08] Greenville, Tennessee, and he went in
[1:15:10] for a PSA level test. And they called
[1:15:13] him and said, "Sir, you have prostate
[1:15:14] cancer. You need to come in." And he
[1:15:16] said, "Well, I've got a big dairy farm
[1:15:17] down here. I can't come in right now,
[1:15:19] and let me take care of the cattle, and
[1:15:20] I'll be in, you know, and get this took
[1:15:22] care of." They said, "Well, you need to
[1:15:23] come now. We need to get get on to this
[1:15:24] thing." So he wrote a letter to his wife
[1:15:27] and he said, "I would rather face my
[1:15:29] hand than cancer." And he went out into
[1:15:33] a field and took his own
[1:15:35] life. After the funeral, the doctor's
[1:15:38] office called and told his wife, "We
[1:15:40] made a terrible
[1:15:41] mistake. The report that was on his
[1:15:44] chart belonged to another man. He never
[1:15:46] even had cancer." But he believed the
[1:15:49] doctor's report to the point that it
[1:15:52] made him do that. But what if he
[1:15:54] believed Isaiah's report?
[1:15:57] And so I say the doctor can be right and
[1:15:59] it can be wrong. But I'm here to tell
[1:16:01] you Isaiah's report is always 100%
[1:16:04] correct. Amen. For God will keep his
[1:16:07] word. Not 99 times out of 100, but 100
[1:16:11] times out of 100, God will keep his
[1:16:14] word.
[1:16:16] You say, "I hear what you're saying,
[1:16:17] brother D, but listen. But listen, this
[1:16:19] problem of mine, but let me say this.
[1:16:21] You may not see the sweet and the bitter
[1:16:23] yet, but hold on and have faith that God
[1:16:26] works all things to the good to bring
[1:16:29] about the sweet according to Romans
[1:16:30] 8:28. And the next time you come to the
[1:16:33] marrah, to the bitter desert land,
[1:16:36] instead of panicking, have faith that
[1:16:38] the God you serve is a God who'll turn
[1:16:41] the bitter water to sweet for the glory
[1:16:43] of his name. You see, in a desert place,
[1:16:46] God shows his greatest power. God does
[1:16:49] his greatest miracles. Did you say,
[1:16:50] "Brother Daryl, I am in a desert place."
[1:16:52] Then you know what I'm telling me?
[1:16:54] You're telling me you're a candidate.
[1:16:55] Amen. For a miracle.
[1:16:57] Glory. Amen. Bless you, Lord. Amen.
[1:17:01] Bless. You see, in a great in a desert
[1:17:03] place, God shows his greatest power. You
[1:17:06] see, God chose to bring them to a place
[1:17:08] where they had to rely on him
[1:17:10] completely. Instead of looking to the
[1:17:12] water for life, he wanted them to look
[1:17:15] to him. You see, if they had drank the
[1:17:17] water, they might have said, "Thank you,
[1:17:18] Lord." But that wasn't what he wanted.
[1:17:22] Amen. He wanted them to see just how
[1:17:24] great he was. He wanted them to
[1:17:27] understand, do you trust the God who
[1:17:29] delivered you to carry you through? You
[1:17:31] see, the Israelites didn't see the sweet
[1:17:33] water. They didn't see the water they
[1:17:36] could drink. But God did. God saw the
[1:17:39] sweet and the bitter because he provided
[1:17:42] it.
[1:17:43] Amen. In a desert place, God shows his
[1:17:46] greatest miracles. The Bible says in
[1:17:49] Luke 9:12, "When the day began to wear
[1:17:51] away, they came the 12 and said unto
[1:17:52] him, send the multitude away that they
[1:17:54] may go into the towns and countries
[1:17:56] round about and lodge and get viddles,
[1:17:58] for we are in a desert
[1:18:01] place." You see, Jesus and disciples
[1:18:04] said, "Let us go into the desert and
[1:18:05] rest." But somehow word got out that
[1:18:07] that's where they going. And when they
[1:18:09] got there, there was a multitude of
[1:18:10] people waiting on them. Now, the Bible
[1:18:13] said there was 5,000, not counting women
[1:18:15] and children. And some some some uh
[1:18:19] Bible uh scholars estimate that the
[1:18:22] crowd was between 11 and
[1:18:24] 15,000
[1:18:27] people. 15,000 people in a desert place.
[1:18:33] And all day long they'd heard the gospel
[1:18:35] preached. And it got evening time and
[1:18:37] the disciples come to the Lord and said,
[1:18:39] "Master, send them away." Right? that
[1:18:42] they may go into the village, that they
[1:18:43] may find lodging, that they may find
[1:18:45] water, that they find stuff to eat. For
[1:18:47] we are in a desert
[1:18:49] place, desert, desolate, solitary,
[1:18:53] lonely, uninhabited. We are in an
[1:18:57] uninhabited place. Send them away that
[1:19:00] they can find some water and some food
[1:19:03] and a place to rest. And Jesus told the
[1:19:06] disciples, "Go among
[1:19:09] them and find something to feed them
[1:19:14] with in a desert
[1:19:17] place." You see, in a desert place, they
[1:19:21] were fixing to see just how great their
[1:19:24] God was. For in a desert place came a
[1:19:28] great miracle.
[1:19:30] For when they went among the people,
[1:19:32] they found a little
[1:19:33] boy who had a bag on his lap.
[1:19:38] And the prophet, if my memory serves,
[1:19:40] said something that that the boy had
[1:19:41] played hookie from school and slipped
[1:19:43] over to the meeting or something like
[1:19:46] that. And so they were there and they
[1:19:48] come up on this little fella and said,
[1:19:49] "Hey buddy, what's in that bag?" Said,
[1:19:52] "It's my
[1:19:53] lunch. Just enough for a little boy.
[1:19:57] Just some biscuits and
[1:20:00] fish. Well, well, what are you going to
[1:20:03] do with
[1:20:05] it? Eat
[1:20:07] it. I'm going to eat it. Said, "Well,
[1:20:10] would you be willing to give your lunch
[1:20:12] to
[1:20:14] Jesus?" What's Jesus want with my
[1:20:17] lunch? He wants to feed this multitude.
[1:20:21] Amen.
[1:20:28] Jesus wants to feed this multitude with
[1:20:31] my lunch, but you see little is much if
[1:20:36] God is in it.
[1:20:40] And so they took the boy's laid. Well,
[1:20:41] it ain't much, but if he can use it, oh
[1:20:44] God,
[1:20:46] beautiful,
[1:20:48] I'll give it to him. But I ain't got no
[1:20:50] talent. But just give him what you got
[1:20:53] cuz see what he's able to do with it.
[1:20:55] You see, as long as you keep that
[1:20:57] problem, it's your problem. As long as
[1:20:58] you keep that fear, it's your fear. But
[1:21:01] if you can just give it to him, see what
[1:21:05] he's able to do with it. And he took
[1:21:07] this little boy's lunch. You know the
[1:21:09] story, and he blessed it. And he fed the
[1:21:12] multitude. And if my memory serves me
[1:21:14] right, when they got done eating, when
[1:21:15] everybody, and you know how we like to
[1:21:17] eat, when everybody got done eating,
[1:21:19] they took up, was it 12 basketfuls of
[1:21:22] leftovers.
[1:21:26] That little boy goes home, throws his
[1:21:28] bag up on the counter. His mama said,
[1:21:29] "Well, Junior, honey, didn't you eat
[1:21:30] today?" So, oh, mama, did I eat? I had
[1:21:33] wonderbread from a wonderworking God.
[1:21:38] You see the children of Israel, they was
[1:21:40] tired, they was weary, and they was
[1:21:42] thirsty. And he gave them sweet water.
[1:21:44] And here these multitude, they was tired
[1:21:47] and hungry and weary. And he fed them.
[1:21:50] And you may be in your desert place. You
[1:21:53] may have arrived in the land of bitter
[1:21:54] water. But you may be there for your
[1:21:58] greatest
[1:21:59] miracle. Yes, sir. in that desert place
[1:22:02] in that land of Mariah. Why don't you do
[1:22:04] like Moses and cry unto the Lord and let
[1:22:08] God show you the tree has always been
[1:22:10] there? You say, "What tree you talking
[1:22:15] about?" I'm not talking about a high
[1:22:17] bush. I'm talking about Calvar's tree.
[1:22:22] Amen. Calvar's tree provided everything
[1:22:26] that we have need of
[1:22:29] here. Not long ago, can I have just a
[1:22:30] few more minutes here? Not long ago, I
[1:22:33] was in a restaurant and a waitress come
[1:22:35] up to me. She said, "Will there be
[1:22:36] anything else?" And I said, "No, ma'am.
[1:22:38] Just just the just just the ticket." She
[1:22:41] said, "Well, someone saw you in here and
[1:22:43] paid for your
[1:22:46] meal." Really? He said, "Yes." I said,
[1:22:48] "Well, let me leave the tip." Said, "No,
[1:22:50] no, they took care of the tip and
[1:22:51] everything. So, if there's nothing else,
[1:22:54] you're free. Just it's all been took
[1:22:57] care of. It's already been paid for.
[1:23:02] Now, I could have done one or two
[1:23:03] things. I could have said, "Ma'am, I
[1:23:05] don't see nobody in this restaurant that
[1:23:07] I know. Are you sure you're talking
[1:23:10] about
[1:23:11] me?" You see, that's what the devil
[1:23:13] does. You can say, "God's a healer."
[1:23:15] Devil say, "Oh, yeah. He's a healer, but
[1:23:16] he won't heal you." Come on. You see
[1:23:19] what I'm saying? I mean, you've been
[1:23:20] there. We've all been there, right? So,
[1:23:23] I could have said, "Are you sure? Are
[1:23:25] you sure it's me? I don't ain't nobody I
[1:23:28] don't see nobody here I know. I could
[1:23:30] have argued. I could have debated. I
[1:23:32] could have even tried to pay for it
[1:23:34] myself. Or I could accept the fact that
[1:23:38] someone paid the price for me. And I
[1:23:41] could walk out that restaurant with a
[1:23:44] belly full of steak.
[1:23:47] So what do you think I
[1:23:51] did? It's exactly right, sis. I went out
[1:23:54] that restaurant and said, "Whoever paid
[1:23:55] for that, thank you." And I said that to
[1:23:59] say this, that whatever you have need
[1:24:01] of, Calvary has already paid the price.
[1:24:05] Yes, sir. Calvary holds the answer to
[1:24:08] every problem. Calvary is where he paid
[1:24:11] the price to have the ability to turn
[1:24:13] all of our bitter waters to sweet. Sweet
[1:24:17] water in a bitter land. David said this,
[1:24:19] "Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
[1:24:21] thou wilt revive me. Thou shalt stretch
[1:24:23] forth thine hand against the wrath of my
[1:24:25] enemies and thy right hand shall save me
[1:24:30] shall save me. Though I walk in the
[1:24:32] midst of trouble, thy will revive me.
[1:24:34] Revive means to have it means to remain
[1:24:36] alive, to sustain life, to re to revive,
[1:24:39] to be quickened from sickness, from
[1:24:41] discouragement, from faintness, from
[1:24:43] death. Oh God. Hallelujah. Though I walk
[1:24:47] in the midst of my troubles, my God will
[1:24:49] revive me. Yes, he will.
[1:24:53] Notice what David said. David didn't
[1:24:54] say, "If I walk in the midst of
[1:24:57] trouble." He said, "Though I walk in the
[1:24:59] midst of trouble." Because as long as
[1:25:01] we're in Leodysa, we're going to walk in
[1:25:03] some trouble.
[1:25:05] But I'm so glad that we do not walk
[1:25:06] alone. For he said, "I'll never leave
[1:25:08] thee, nor will I forsake thee." Amen.
[1:25:12] David understood that there will be
[1:25:14] trouble, but he will revive me in the
[1:25:17] time of my troubles. In a land of bitter
[1:25:20] water, he will make my water sweet. You
[1:25:23] know, my mama, bless her heart, just had
[1:25:25] Mother's Day, but I lost her back in
[1:25:28] 2005 of
[1:25:30] cancer. But my mama said something
[1:25:32] that's always stayed with me. She told
[1:25:34] me one day, she said, "You know, Darl, I
[1:25:36] may have
[1:25:38] cancer, but cancer does not have me."
[1:25:43] And I may have troubles, but troubles
[1:25:46] did not have me.
[1:25:48] He promised me he would revive me. G.
[1:25:51] And the problem said, I think a lot of
[1:25:52] times today, the reason we get into
[1:25:54] tight places is God wants to reveal to
[1:25:56] us, to show us his love, to prove to us
[1:25:58] he's the same God yesterday, today, and
[1:26:00] forever. His power is still the same. He
[1:26:03] wants to show his power. God likes to
[1:26:06] manifest his power. And maybe that's why
[1:26:08] you get sick. Maybe that's why you are
[1:26:11] in a desert place. Come on. Is he wants
[1:26:14] to show you his love. He wants to show
[1:26:17] you he's a
[1:26:18] wonderworking God.
[1:26:21] Listen, let me just say this before we
[1:26:23] close. Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[1:26:27] I've seen cancers
[1:26:30] disappear. I have. Yeah. Amen. I was in
[1:26:34] Cottonwood, Arizona. A sister had a
[1:26:37] tumor on her chest. She had been putting
[1:26:38] some kind of essential oil, some kind of
[1:26:40] ointment or something on it. And that
[1:26:41] night when was preaching the word of
[1:26:42] God, she was just praising God. She
[1:26:44] never came up for prayer. She never even
[1:26:46] asked for prayer. She was just
[1:26:47] worshiping God for the things God had
[1:26:48] done for other people. And she went home
[1:26:50] and took off her blouse to put some
[1:26:51] ointment on it. And the cancer was gone.
[1:26:54] James Tidwell was at BYC. He had a
[1:26:56] cancer in his ear that had been there
[1:26:57] for a long time. And it would scab over
[1:26:59] and bleed and scab over and bleed. And
[1:27:00] that night we had all the young people
[1:27:02] come up for prayer. Had the sisters on
[1:27:03] one side, the brothers on the other. And
[1:27:04] I had all the ministers and all the
[1:27:06] believers come up stand behind the kids.
[1:27:07] And we had one mass prayer for everybody
[1:27:09] in the building. And brother James come
[1:27:10] up and laid his hands on the brothers,
[1:27:12] the young brothers there. And he said
[1:27:13] that night he went and laid down to go
[1:27:15] to sleep and he got up the next morning
[1:27:16] and looked in the mirror and the cancer
[1:27:18] was gone out of his ear. No scar, no
[1:27:20] scab, no cancer.
[1:27:23] I had a cancer coming up in my ear right
[1:27:25] there. They did a procedure called the
[1:27:27] Mo procedure. They cut a hole in my ear
[1:27:29] so big you could read the Constitution
[1:27:30] through it. It left a terrible scar. But
[1:27:33] you see, when man takes a cancer off the
[1:27:35] ear, it leaves a scar. But when my God
[1:27:37] does it, Hallelujah. It doesn't even
[1:27:39] leave a scar.
[1:27:41] Amen. That's the God we serve. Broken
[1:27:43] bodies healed. I've seen live real life
[1:27:46] resurrections. I've seen mental health
[1:27:48] issues restored. I've seen addicts
[1:27:50] delivered. I've seen families restored.
[1:27:52] I've seen prodigals returned. Do not
[1:27:54] tell me my God cannot do it. I have seen
[1:27:57] my God open the eyes of the blind. I've
[1:27:59] seen him bring my daughter out of a
[1:28:01] wheelchair. When the doctor said she
[1:28:03] would not live, my God said she will
[1:28:05] live. And he defied what the doctor
[1:28:07] said. That's the God we serve.
[1:28:10] Hallelujah. When giants come calling our
[1:28:12] name, we will not fear. Amen. For we
[1:28:16] serve the God who does wonders, a
[1:28:20] wonderworking God. Amen. Who takes our
[1:28:22] bitter waters. Amen. In a desert place
[1:28:25] and makes them sweet. Yes, sir. Do you
[1:28:27] love him? Do you believe him? That's the
[1:28:30] God we serve tonight. Amen. Let us bow
[1:28:33] our heads. Hallelujah. I pray I've not
[1:28:36] kept you too long. If thou have forgiven
[1:28:37] me. Amen.
[1:28:40] Hallelujah.
[1:28:42] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh,
[1:28:45] God. But Lord, I'm not bragging on
[1:28:47] myself. I'm bragging on you, Lord. I've
[1:28:48] seen you do it, God. You're a
[1:28:50] wonderworking God. Oh,
[1:28:53] hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:28:56] Jesus. Why would I worry when giants
[1:29:00] come calling my name?
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:05] M my God is so much bigger and troubles
[1:29:10] I
[1:29:12] face. And why would I hunger for power
[1:29:16] or riches or
[1:29:20] fame? Cuz my God is so much better than
[1:29:25] all of these
[1:29:27] things. So I won't be shen.
[1:29:33] I won't be
[1:29:35] moved. My God is
[1:29:39] faithful. His promise is
[1:29:43] true. So I'll speak to the
[1:29:47] mountains. Tell them it's time to
[1:29:51] move. Cuz my God is bigger, better,
[1:29:55] stronger, greater than you.
[1:30:00] My enemies scatter cuz they know the
[1:30:04] battle is
[1:30:08] done. My God is stronger. The victories
[1:30:12] already
[1:30:15] won. Yes, he died for my ransom and rose
[1:30:19] up on the third
[1:30:22] day. Because my God is greater than
[1:30:26] death, hell and the
[1:30:30] grave. So I won't be
[1:30:32] [Music]
[1:30:34] shen. I won't be
[1:30:38] moved. My God is
[1:30:41] faithful. His promise is
[1:30:45] true. So I'll speak to the
[1:30:49] mountains. Tell them it's time to move.
[1:30:53] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:30:59] greater than
[1:31:02] you. Oh heavenly father, tonight I'm so
[1:31:06] glad, Lord, that that's not just words
[1:31:07] of a song that someone put together, but
[1:31:10] oh God, that's a reality. That's the God
[1:31:12] we serve tonight. And Lord, you have
[1:31:14] given us the authority to speak to that
[1:31:16] mountain. Lord, you've given us the
[1:31:17] authority to meet that Goliath, to meet
[1:31:19] that giant in the name of the Lord
[1:31:21] Jesus. had to slay him, oh God, by a
[1:31:24] stone of confession, dear God, that you
[1:31:26] are our healer and our deliverer. And
[1:31:28] Lord, we believe these things tonight
[1:31:29] that many times, Lord, we realize, Lord,
[1:31:31] that we come into these tight places. We
[1:31:33] come into these desert places, dear God,
[1:31:35] that you could just come on the scene
[1:31:36] and show us just how great you are. And
[1:31:39] Lord, I know tonight there's needs here,
[1:31:40] Lord God. But, Father, there's not a
[1:31:42] need in this building that's greater
[1:31:43] than you. There's not a situation in
[1:31:45] this building that's greater than you,
[1:31:47] Lord. And the same God that healed that
[1:31:49] sister in Cottonwood. The same God who
[1:31:50] caused the glaucoma to fall off a sister
[1:31:52] Betty's eyes in Pennsylvania. The same
[1:31:55] God that healed Scott Smith's brother of
[1:31:56] a torn rotator cuff. That's the same God
[1:31:59] who raised Sister Ruth Garland from the
[1:32:00] dead. That's who you are, God. There is
[1:32:02] no God like you. You're the almighty,
[1:32:05] all powerful. Hallelujah. And we believe
[1:32:07] you tonight. And we love you tonight,
[1:32:08] Lord. And we look to you, the author and
[1:32:10] finisher of our faith tonight. And oh
[1:32:12] God, when this giant raises his hand, we
[1:32:14] will meet that challenge in the name of
[1:32:16] Jesus Christ. Oh God, may the people's
[1:32:18] faith rise up tonight to receive, may
[1:32:20] they not look at the bitter water. May
[1:32:22] they not look at the desert barren land.
[1:32:24] May they not look at that situation, but
[1:32:26] may they look to the God who is the
[1:32:27] answer. For you are the answer. Your
[1:32:29] prophet told us, "You're the answer
[1:32:30] yesterday. You're the answer today. And
[1:32:32] if there's a tomorrow, you will be the
[1:32:34] answer tomorrow. You're the God that
[1:32:36] heals bones. You're the God that heals
[1:32:38] cancer. You're the God that open blinded
[1:32:39] eyes. You're the God that makes the lame
[1:32:41] walk. You're the God that raises the
[1:32:43] dead. You're the God that takes a drunk
[1:32:44] and makes a preacher out of them. You're
[1:32:46] the God who delivers from alcohol,
[1:32:48] delivers from drug addiction that
[1:32:49] restores marriages. There is nothing
[1:32:51] that you can't do, God. And tonight,
[1:32:53] Lord, we're not going to look at our
[1:32:54] problems. We're not going to look to our
[1:32:56] symptoms, but we're going to look to our
[1:32:58] God. Amen. And we're going to believe
[1:32:59] you, Father, as we have gathered here
[1:33:01] tonight from different areas. We're
[1:33:02] going to lift up our voice to you. We're
[1:33:04] going to lift up our hands to you. And
[1:33:06] we're going to praise you. And we're
[1:33:07] going to pray for our brother. We're
[1:33:09] going to pray for our sister for oh God
[1:33:11] you have given us a mighty weapon and
[1:33:13] that weapon of prayer and we're going to
[1:33:15] use it tonight against our enemy in the
[1:33:17] name of Jesus Christ. What saints do you
[1:33:19] believe it tonight? Then stand to your
[1:33:21] feet with me in the name of Jesus and
[1:33:23] reach over and lay hands on the person
[1:33:24] beside you tonight. Will you do it?
[1:33:27] Exercise your God-given right as a
[1:33:28] believer to lay hands upon the sick and
[1:33:30] the afflicted and they shall recover.
[1:33:32] That's the promise of God's word
[1:33:34] tonight. Oh, believe with me now and
[1:33:36] believe with me now. Let's pray
[1:33:37] together. Oh mighty creator of heavens
[1:33:39] and earth, giver of every good gift
[1:33:41] tonight. We stand there united as a body
[1:33:43] of believers and we lay our heads upon
[1:33:45] one another. I pray for my brother
[1:33:47] tonight. I pray for my sister tonight.
[1:33:49] In the name of Jesus Christ, let the
[1:33:51] fear leave. Let depression leave. Let
[1:33:53] high blood pressure leave. Let low blood
[1:33:55] pressure leave. Let diabetes leave
[1:33:57] tonight. Let broken bones be healed. Let
[1:33:59] cancer disappear tonight. That's the God
[1:34:01] we serve. That's the God we believe
[1:34:03] tonight. Oh heavenly father, I pray in
[1:34:06] the name of Jesus. Touch our brother
[1:34:08] Bill tonight, Lord. Reach out and touch
[1:34:10] him tonight. Oh God, I believe you for
[1:34:11] it. Father, there's nothing that you
[1:34:13] can't do tonight. And we lift our hearts
[1:34:15] and we lift our heads to you in prayer.
[1:34:17] I pray for my sisters. I pray for my
[1:34:20] brothers. I pray for the marriage. I
[1:34:21] pray for this church. I lift up my voice
[1:34:24] in victory tonight. For Oh, hallelujah.
[1:34:27] For my God cannot fail tonight in the
[1:34:29] name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you're
[1:34:31] defeated. You have no hold on us
[1:34:33] tonight. I rebuke you in the name of
[1:34:36] Jesus Christ for the glory of God
[1:34:38] tonight. Amen and amen and amen.
[1:34:41] Hallelujah. Or do you believe it
[1:34:43] tonight? Then lift up your hand and
[1:34:44] receive it in the name of Jesus.
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:35:07] God bless you.
[1:35:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
