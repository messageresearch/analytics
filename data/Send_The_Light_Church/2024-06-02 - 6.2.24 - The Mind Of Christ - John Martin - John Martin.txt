amen amen all that I have needed he has provided amen amen he knows that's right he knows he knows what you need but it takes it takes a real Revelation it doesn't need to be it sounds sort of like a cliche everybody say oh I need more Revelation but you do it takes every realization you know a child knows mom and dad's got this they got it I don't have to worry about food yeah I got to keep my room clean but I don't have to worry about food and and know things because they know what I have need of before I even ask and my heavenly father knows everything that I have need of I'm amazed I really am I just I sit I sit on my front porch and go oh I think I got it all but I didn't he gave it to me he gave me all this he gave me he gave me Health he gave me clothes he gave me food he gave me he gave me I love the birds I love listening to the birds sing he gave me the birds so I have something to listen to besides on you know and whatever they call that stuff but I'm grateful I'm grateful and it takes a revelation to see that amen that even in sickness that's what job had that we don't have his wife come to him and she said ah job you're crazy foolish man just give it up just give it up look everything's against us and everything else and he look at her he goes did God God not give us all these things and the same hand that gave it to us can he just take it away can he do all those things right that has to become I always like to think of you know like brother Orlando he's he's a carpenter he's got a toolbox and in his toolbox he's got Hammers and screwdrivers and and saws and all kinds of things he opens it up and if if this piece of molding or he's got to take this cover off he's got to have screwdriver so you go in there and they look find a screwdriver and take the cover off what do you need well this morning maybe I need healing so I to go open up the tool box look in there and say oh look at that there's a tool in here and it says I am the Lord that Health thee right oh no I don't want to use that okay you're not getting the cover off he's faithful if you just open up the bag and take the toolbox out take a look at it amen and you're lucky I'm not preaching let's all stand together and sing Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me as brother John comes looking forward to the word of God amen amen you know that one sister [Laughter] Cheryl if not I just give me a key I'll sing it SP but this kind of low Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me Spirit of the Living God all fresh un me melt me mold me fil me use me Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me is which one this morning o I don't I don't think I know the verses Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me Spirit of the Living God oh all fresh on me melt me mold me fil me use me Spirit of the Living God for on [Music] me amen if he would imagine he'd just fill us up so full we'd never have a worry never fear no matter what happened to us and that's our goal is to to re to receive as much of God as we possibly can yield Our Lives to or we certainly appreciate that worship service and it's good to see everyone here in the house of the Lord before you're seated we're going to just read one scripture and have a word of prayer and that's going to be in Philippians chapter 2 good to see um brother Dennis this morning amen we kind of missed him not kind that sounded not not real good but uh I I want you to know that I am on my light is on my light is on I'm GNA let This Little Light of Mine shine amen amen amen I might can just do the handheld if need to but the light is on take that one all right you just bear with me a a moment I guess um always has to be something something God bless you thank you all right can you hear me can you hear me yes praise the Lord amen let's just um take a moment and uh just thow in a word of prayer our heavenly father we want to thank you for your presence this morning Lord you understand all about Humanity you came and you went through all the things that we went through you suffered like we suffered you you are touched by the feelings of our infirmities yet Lord you overcame them you never sinned and Lord today you stand as an advocate for us Lord we pray the blood of Jesus Christ upon each and every heart and life here those that are live streaming today we just pray that your presence would be with us all and Lord that you would prepare us for your word today Lord as it's been said Lord may you give us the Revelation that we have need of Father we commit this service with all the needs that we have into your hands believing Lord that you're going to meet needs we ask it now in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen one verse we'll have you be seated it is um second or Philippians chapter 2 and verse number five let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus God bless you you may be seated how many feel last Sunday that God did something special last Sunday amen and if it may it it may not be all that uh God uh that you want God to do for you but you know something happened something started and I I just want us to just pay attention attention to the thing that started it because if we continue to do it I believe God will continue to bless us am and then if we could just humble ourselves and seek the Lord more it is that simple God will move supernaturally in our midst amen now this this verse though howy he remembers this verse in our men's meeting amen amen I I know brother brother Bruce does and I told an after the men's meeting I said and I had these notes were already done before I got to church yesterday for our men's and this was our opening scripture this is like the last one that Brother Bruce was sharing with us about we want to entitle this message the mind of Christ and for a subject today um mind control mind control and and I I really want to get to the the punchline here is we can control what happens in our mind let's uh the mind of Christ is truly The Living Word of God in operation amen that's what the mind of Christ is let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus we if we looked at Matthew chapter 4 when the devil came to Jesus we would see the mind of Christ in action that's usually where you see the mind of Christ in action is when there's problems and the devil came and he tempted him and the the devil tempts us with popularity he tempts us to use our power and he he he he he tempts us just to to uh uh to to to bring forth the manifestation of our flesh instead of the word of God and the God is always leading us back to the word to put God first in our lives and don't tempt the Lord and and and live by every word of God when we see this woman that was caught in adultery we see the mind of Christ come out when the the the mind of Satan was in in all these people they were want to judge uh this woman condemn this woman and and the mind of Christ was manifested in Mercy in Grace in love uh Jesus was praying in the garden and uh the devil uh came to him and said you know you don't have to go through with this you can call 12 Legions of eight Angels right now you know God can make another way the father could make another way but Jesus the mind of Christ said not my will but thy will be done they came to Jesus to take him away and he was in the right his disciples didn't do anything wrong and even uh when an ear was cut off of one of the solders Soldiers the great mind of Christ was filled with compassion and love and it wasn't fighting Flesh and Blood the mind of Christ does not fight Flesh and Blood it just picked up that ear and healed it so we understand the mind of Christ is the word of God in operation and the Bible is telling us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so let's go back to the beginning of this chapter it says if there be any counsel ation in Christ any comfort of love any Fellowship of the spirit any bows and mercy fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded so the mind of Christ is full of mercies full bows and and and and fellowship of the spirit and and and comfort of Love fulfill ye my joy that you be like minded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind it kind of describes what this mind is let nothing be done through Strife vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind think about others talk about others right let uh each esteem the other better than yourself now the mind of Christ just does that it doesn't have to struggle to do that if we struggle and if we have to struggle to do that that really means we don't have the mind of Christ but we're trying to get it are you with me look not every man on his own things so when it's all about you and not about others something is missing there but every man also on the things of other let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he what what this great aspect God himself he humbled himself and he became obedient now there's the mind of Christ you humble yourself to the word and you begin to obey the word more right you become obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so we have to you know Jesus the first thing he told us is is you got to die out every day deny yourself pick up your cross follow me that's the if we're going to follow God we've got to learn to die out to the flesh because the flesh is enity and and there's where the the Battle Is Now humans in general do not put much interest in the quality of their thinking too often it's not a big deal what they think about uh or how they're even thinking but reality if people don't learn to get control of their mind their minds will control their lives we've heard this before that we need to watch our thoughts they become our words watch our words because they become our actions watch our actions because they become our habits watch our habits they become our character and watch our character they become our destiny Brother Band says our our character is only thing we're taking with us our thoughts even though we don't think there's much to them they lead us to our destiny amen now I've watched people go up and down in their walk all because their mind was in certain things right a person who reads the Bible prays a lot listens to tape I'm going to tell you their mind is a little bit clearer a little bit stronger a little bit more focused but when you get away from that and you're looking thinking reading on other things well spiritually we can go down the tubes pretty fast we've heard it said before a mind is a is a terrible thing to waste uh it has a tremendous amount of power the Mind does I say the mind is a glorious thing that to invest in today but we've got to invest in it if our thoughts are vain they have no purpose they will lead us to kind of a a a a a a wasteland a a No Man's Land a place where things just don't matter what happens if our thoughts have purpose and I'll say God's purpose God's Vision then they will lead us to build our life stronger a healthier and a solid foundation and and we'll have healthy lives because our minds are healthy amen many of us have heard before that our mind is a battlefield anybody ever feel that going on in your mind before crazy stuff going on uncertainty confusion but the Mind itself is neither good or bad it's just simply a plain field and it's important for us to visualize this if we're going to gain control of our minds I want you to think of just a plain field when you're driving by and you see a plain field that's what our minds are you can take that soil and you can plow it up and you can can plant some seed and grow some crops or you can take and build a house on it you can plant a Vineyard you can put up a tall fence and put in a a junkyard bring in lots of cars so cars our minds are a plain field which two forces good and evil they come together and they fight B said in the greatest batt there has to be a place selected and this and the mutual ground a no man's land and they fight here at this place they they just don't one fight over here and one over there and run over over here there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers where each Army test its strength against the other Army a mutual uh meeting place now don't miss this I often think about what's happening in Ukraine when you really you know Ukraine in itself it needs all the help from all these other countries and it's like you've got these two Powers meeting together in Ukraine I and I think our minds are like this that you got good and evil coming in here and trying to uh make us to make a decision in the wrong direction that's what the devil's trying to do and God's trying to make us to to make a right direction but brother R said uh now don't miss this when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin the battle to rage and the Battlegrounds begin in the human mind this is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begun and that it's because that decisions are made in the mind the head where you where you got to meet your men enemy is in your mind you've got to make your choice it meets you I want this little girl here that's very sick to be sure she's listening now real close decisions are made in the mind the head this is where Satan meets you and the decisions are because God has made it that way amen you know too often when we're in a battle with another human being we don't realize that the battle is really in our mind but we often think it's with the other person now there is a physical womb and there is a spiritual womb the physical wom is sacred we know that's a woman that she just doesn't let any old thing in there it's it's it's set aside for her husband hband it's a sacred thing and this womb is where seed is taken in and it brings forth the manifestation of what that seed is amen right and a woman who opens up to any other than her husband actually contaminates herself she is considered a woman of ill Fame a harlot a prostitute an immoral woman a woman of low character we've heard all these before amen now the spiritual womb is no different brother bam said in the spoken word is the Original Seed there is a spiritual womb and there's a physical womb and the mind is the womb to the spirit amen I want to say this that that is also sacred our mind is sacred it's it's been set aside only for our spiritual husband a Believer has been taught to think like her husband in other words let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus the wife of Jesus Christ has been taught to only think on pure things it doesn't think evil of its neighbor it's not judgmental it's not critical right Philippians 4:5 tells us finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of are good report if there be any any strength any virtue if there be any praise then think on these things now this is what the the womb of our mind or the the the womb of our mind has been made for it has been made strictly for the word of God it hasn't been it isn't for you to to think about whatever you want to think about and watch whatever you want to watch read whatever you want to read talk about what you text whatever you want to do and then expect there be peace in your heart mind it don't work like that you become ill ill affected right and a Christian today who opens up the the womb of their mind to thoughts that are not from her spiritual husband contaminates themselves amen we've set the word of God aside and we take on other thoughts inside what we're doing is we're committing a spiritual act that is wrong it's immoral and I'll say it like this if brother bam said the only sin is unbelief that where does that transpire I mean ye yes unbelief or faith is in our heart but the Battleground is up here Amen brother brandom said in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed he said that's exactly what Eve done with a spiritual intercourse first that came by believing Satan's lie I want you to catch that this terrible act that Eve done it came by believing Satan's lie so how can we just think about whatever we want to think about and it's okay right amen that came by believing Satan's lie into the womb of her mind that polluted her Soul it set death in her soul then the natural act taken place right you know we talk and we think about the you know what happened in the garden and this natural act but I'm telling you the the the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it happens up here amen we partake of it up here amen and that's how they committed adultery is let some devil spirit in them something against the word of God then she's committed adultery remember when Jesus said it's um whosoever lookth upon a woman the ACT is already committed see it it all happens in the mind now Eve receive he said now you listen to this eve received the wrong seed word it was a seat because it was a thought amen and she received the wrong seed word Satan's lie against Jehovah's word which resulted in death now look what did she do she receed the wrong seed and how did she do it by believing Satan's lie we don't realize how important it is to think on these things we think it's okay to take a little jolly uh little trolley vacation in our mind and just think about whatever we want to think about that's the place that Satan's looking to get in Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so if you have a a Hate in Your Heart towards somebody that's who you are and if you have a Love in Your Heart amen that's who you are a man is no different than how they think I love this scripture titus5 says unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure and even their mind and their conscience is defiled their minds have become contaminated in other words even though they're thinking about something that's of a pure subject or uh they're reading the word of God or they're listening to the tape because their mind has been corrupted they allowed the wrong thoughts into their mind they're staring at the same pth word of God with a contaminated mindset amen they profess that they know God but in their Works they deny him so it doesn't matter what you say it matters what you do amen being abominal and disobedient and unto every good work a reprobate all because we have this neutral Battleground that we've allowed wrong thoughts to come into yes but we want to take control of that battleground don't we the mind is neutral it's a neutral Battleground brother B said the mind has been chosen for the battle the mind is neither controlled by God or by Satan or I'll say like this or by Big Brother the mind is a free moral agency in which you have been given control of the Battleground I can't control your mind and you can't control my mind now I can influence you and you can influence me but we ourselves make the final decision in our mind what we're going to think on what we're going to accept now God gave each of us the gift to control our minds I like the way to say that's it's a gift he gave us that gift brother Timothy was battling a spirit of fear in his mind with his walk with God he was actually embarrassed to see how a genuine Christian has to suffer so much like it shouldn't be that way so Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 1:8 he said be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be a partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God Amen and in verse seven right above it there's the gift of God for for God have not given us the spirit of fear Timothy but of power and of love and of a sound mind why would you take a wonderful gift like that and then just let the thoughts of the devil Harbor inside your mind now we've all doubt what spirits of fear every one of us the Bible tells us the mind of God tells us that perfect love cast out all fear that's coming in perfect love with the word you want to please your your spiritual husband you want to please him so much you want to think on the right things you want to confidence in him nothing can separate you from God and that love that perfect love for God you can stand with boldness on the day of judgment because you're so much in unity with God and that love for God it will cast out all fear amen fear don't have to be part of our Lives even though God has gifted us with a sound mind the devil knows how to influence us he knows how to push our buttons you know we like to say our our spouses know how to push our buttons I'm going to tell you that's the devil it is the devil that uses people to push our buttons amen that's what I'm saying I am not saying the devil is our spouse got to make this real clear the devil knows how to push our buttons he knows how to get us get us to adjust our own sale how to distract us how to influence the decision making that we're doing amen 2 Corinthians chapter 11 if we could just uh put this up there I don't know if I wrote it down 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you exposed you to one husband in other words do not give your thoughts allow the thoughts of the devil into the womb of your mind one husband if I've exposed you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ God does not want us to entertain thoughts from a wrong Spirit just the word of God but I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ stay with the word just stay with the word if the word says be faithful be faithful amen if the word says love your enemy just love your enemy don't say I can't do it you're going to call God's word a lie the word the word says yet you can but the thing is in your flesh you can't you you just you just surrender surrender I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I give you my heart I give you my life I now can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me amen Satan wants to corrupt our minds contaminate them with just a little leaven to leaven the whole lump Satan will use any means to corrupt our minds to get us to get away from the word of God which is the mind of Christ all right verse four this is this is really it shows us how the devil corrupts the the minds of professing Bel Believers for if if he that cometh if their Spirit cometh preaching another Jesus whom we've not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not already received or another gospel which you have not already accepted ye might well bear with him and in other words we have to learn how to hold up the standard of the pure word of God to a devil who comes in and only gives us 90% of the word it's that 10% that will lead us away from Christ and he won't do it overnight a little bit little bit little bit before you know it you're not even attached to the body of Christ amen and then you wonder why is it some somebody helping me I think it's time for us to fall in love with Jesus you can't mix the gospel with our own ideas with church ideas with philosophy if we just spend a moment considering what the devil has to offer us we got a good chance we're going to get tricked we're going to let a wrong Spirit into our minds look at all the different denominations and church groups out there all the independent groups out there I mean there's people who love entertaining the idea of another gospel a church with more liberal views Satan corrupting the minds of them that don't believe they'd rather have entertainment than be told by God what to do to straight their lives up you can see how Jesus J is on the outside of the church knocking to get back in but they don't want the pure word 2 Corinthians 4:3 says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them who are lost ohow you know brother brother Bruce said that we need Revelation praise God for the revelation we have amen but we need more Revelation right I don't want the truth hid from me Amen in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which don't believe in their heart that the word is real for them lest the light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ who's in the image of God should shine upon them for we preach not ourselves We Don't Preach our opinions but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake amen for whom for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined into our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ this is why we need the pure gospel and only the word of God it is the mind of Christ we don't come here to try to become better people I can't go I can't get up in the morning without thinking how rotten I am I can't I'm so glad his mercies are new each morning the mind is neither controlled by God or by Satan hate to say it it's controlled by you we choose who we're going to listen to good to see sister Linda Helms God bless you you know worst things could have happened May God heal your body amen now here's the secret to mind control it's the same secret to actually losing your mind or possessing the mind of Christ and it's in Romans chap 6:16 I want us to really mark this verse down and think about it in the days to come Romans 6:16 says know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servant ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness know ye not so you take this gift of free more agency and if you yield your mind to the thoughts of God then you will receive the fruit from what the thoughts of God gives you you will receive the love of God the peace of God the joy of God the victory Of God because You' yielded your thoughts unto God let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus let in other words it's free more agency you got to choose to to to whom you yield yourself servant to obey and if you take your Freemore agency and yield your mind to the thoughts of the things of this world the things that are contrary to the word of God things that are 90% truth and 10% false if you yield yourself to those thoughts then you will suffer anxiety you will suffer sorrow you will suffer depression you will suffer self uh self-centeredness and and loneliness all because you viewed yourself to only a partial truth amen know ye not to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant ye are to whom you obey remember it's the battle Ground God set that so we don't have nothing to do with that that's between God and Satan so we get all kinds of thoughts into our minds and at least one of them gets Ed to but often we get a pack of thoughts and we yield to them it becomes confusion we know God is not the author of confusion but all the thoughts that come into our our head they lead us to a particular path to whom you yield yourselves servants to to whom you yield yourself or to whom you accept into your mind that is what will take you down a particular path the thoughts are generated from one of two sources we know and we are here today in our lives when we take a look at a snapshot of our lives today we are here because of the choices the decisions that we made day has gone past if you made the right decisions in the past you had you accepted the right thoughts into your mind they LED you to where you're at today amen we have no one to blame for our situation than ourselves want talk about strongholds for a moment they can they're real now a natural stronghold in the Old Testament was a place of fortification a fortress a castle a fortified City often people become prisoners in their own mind because they yielded their mind to the enemy not because of what happened to them I'm sorry we all might want to use an excuse but there is no excuse God would never put anything on you that you could not bear but will make a way of Escape but look every one of us I'll tell you I I was thinking about this other day I don't know who I was talking to about it but it is the truth uh how many's like like smoked or dranked or you know okay been been on habits like that when you were in the world okay I remember when I was smoking and drinking and doing the things and listening to all kinds of music and had long hair playing my guitar and acting like I'm going to be a rock star that was one of the things I wanted to be when I grew up you know I remember every one of those things I remember you know taking my my first cigarette and how you know I wanted to be like my older brother and you know it it seems that every habit that we've ever gotten into is because we made the choice we wanted to do it when it started the thing is the devil never told us it was going to become a habit and put a chain on our neck and we won't be able to get rid of it when we wanted to they become strongholds that we've started sometimes people get lazy and they just think whatever they want to think in their mind whatever that comes to them they just think about they get lazy oh man imagine right now that you got this field remember it's your field you we talked about at the beginning and you just want to go out there and you want to sit in this field because it's it's got It's got trees along the perimeter and it's got a nice Sunset and the the the grass is beautiful and green you just want to go out there and you want to spend some time with the Lord just look at the beauty of his creation Now imagine someone comes with a D truck and this dump truck is full of poisonous snakes and they just want to get them off their property and they want to dump them on your property the devil is looking for individuals who allow him to put anything he wants to in their mind that's what he's looking for that's why the Bible says be sober be sober minded be vigilant with your thoughts because your enemy is looking whom he may devour people make wrong decisions by allowing the wrong thoughts into their mind that will always lead them to unwanted outcomes in their lives sometimes they'll even feel trapped strongholds I wish I could just get this out of my head I can't seem to get these thoughts out of my head people can get to a place in their minds that they feel that there's no way out of their situation but I'm here to tell you that it's just a lie of the devil the thing is we've got to believe it to start with you can't wait for God to just you know uh do something with your mind and then you're going to believe it God created did everything by faith we were saved by faith we serve God God lives in our heart by faith we will overcome by faith we will get a clear mind by faith we will get out of our situations by faith so let's take control of our mind second Corinthians chapter 3 verse three 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse3 I mean for though we walk in the flesh we don't war after the flesh as I said before the mind of Christ doesn't fight with flesh and blood when you see somebody Waring you know that's just the devil that is just the devil and look people don't recognize the devil in their life they're very good at recognizing the devil in one another's life and that's okay that we can recognize the devil in one another's life that's okay but the thing is if we don't get to recognize in the devil speaking to us for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they're Mighty through god notice through God don't try to pull down the strongholds all by yourself the Bible says submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you it is through Christ that we get rid of the strongholds the message wisdom versus faith brother Braham said that the strongholds were of Satan he knows what he's doing when he gives you a thought I'm telling you he's got something else more in mind than that little thought he's got something he's wanting to build when we yield ourselves to God God can pull down every Fortress every stronghold everything that seems like in possible he can take away every problem in our mind every every any anxiety any pressure any depression any loneliness he can take that fortitude city that you just can't seem to get over out of your mind the bible promises us that God would turn our sorrow into Joy now I I believe that last Sunday I believe that is the path to complete freedom is keep seeking the Lord keep humbling yourself keep calling upon God and God will move if we're too proud uh we think we've done enough we don't feel like doing it anymore I'm telling you he God will just let Satan because you made the choice you understand amen for the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal But Mighty through God to the point down a strong casting down imaginations H imaginations I don't need to go to church all the time I don't really need to like live for others really I mean I live for I live for my wife I live for my husband that's it imaginations imaginations I can't get rid of this problem imaginations how many times have you thought something was so real and you found out at the end that wasn't even real and it scared the two yeah the magibi out of you exactly imaginations the devil can do a lot with an imagination and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God well you know I don't need to pay all my ties I don't really need to pray today and bring my flesh say I'm sorry I don't I don't need to submit to the word of God I don't alls I need to do is every High thing that exalteth itself against this is the mind of God right here this is the mind of God and anytime we exalt ourself above this we're actually exalting oursel against God that's the same thing Satan's doing and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ you have control to bring every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen you just got to start you got to humble yourself and you got to start thinking is it okay for me to be thinking these thoughts just don't go and think them and find out oh yeah I'm at a big mess I need to start you know doing something no don't do that try every Spirit see whether it be of God see if it's the mind of Christ before you spend time thinking about it because the the devil will come in and he'll stay longer than you want him to stay he'll keep you longer in that situation than you want to stay in don't think negatively don't don't doubt don't question don't worry Don't Fear don't allow the enemy to Harbor inside your mind you have control you can cast down the imagination you can bring the thought into obedience to the word of God if the if the word says don't think on it if it's not a good report then don't think on it you just got to get serious with the devil if you be Loosey Goosey then you're going to have a Loosey Goosey walk and you're GNA your walk's going to be like this happy sad happy sad down I'm on cloud n testifying one day with your mouth next day your life is testifying the other way God has called us to be sober amen sound a a a a Christian that can endure [Applause] hardness the the bride is manifesting what the mind of Christ amen that's what she's manifesting because she knows brother BR says she knows what to do with the word what is that live it right live it verse six and having inside of us a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when when your obedience is fulfilled now I just I want to see a raise of hands have you ever tried to get somebody else to be obedient when you weren't being obedient C we we are so talented we've got the ability to help somebody without caring about [Laughter] ourselves when your obedience is fulfilled that's how you put the devil in his place when you become obedient to the word now look do you look do you look on the things of the outward appearance in other words is is this battle really happening outwardly for we don't fight against flesh and blood the Bible tells us that's what James said we're we're fight or or or or Peter Peter said we don't fight against uh flesh and bl that is wrong that's Paul uh we we we fight against spiritual wickedness that's in high places amen that's where the battle is it's up here but we're talking here and James says look don't you know that those Wars are within you those fightings are within you what's happening in here is what we're doing out here and what has to happen is you have to take on the whole armor of God the armor goes on the the spiritual man it does not go on the flesh it goes on the spiritual man it's invisible it's an invisible armor the mind of Christ and we fight we overcome evil with good right be not overcomed of evil but overcome evil with good why the Bible says it's the goodness of God that leads man to repentance amen it's God's grace and his his Mercy towards us we got to give more reverence to the mind of Christ it takes a a huge desire on our part to get more of the mind of Christ inside of us because we've been so programmed by the devil to think about what we want to think about any old time we want to think about it but we need to be more reverent to the word we need to be sober we need to be vigilant we need to understand we're in this spiritual battle it's not us the battle the ground is neutral but you got these two Spirits white dog black dog sit inside they're they're Waring against one another which one's winning the one you feed the most right the one you're yielding to the most how many want God to come inside and and help at the Battle all right let's look at Isaiah 66:1 for a second thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot to where is the house that you will build on to me how are we going to actually do something to get God to come by us and say here God I did this for you where if he built uh Earth he built Heaven he sits in heaven his foot is on the Earth where is the house that you build me and where is the place of my rest where am I going to come and sit down and say okay that's the question verse two helps us to see for all those things have my hands made and all those things have been sayeth the Lord but to this man will I look I I I I'm going to find some rest in this man I'm going to come into this man and take my Abode even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at the mind of God that trembleth at my word reverence the word if the thought that's coming into you is not of the word then get away from it right in other words respect the word tremble at God's word it's the only way we're going to become the word amen we've got to yield to God's thoughts when we yield to them we'll prosper in our minds we'll have healthier Minds we have a more of a sound mind God's thoughts always lead us to freedom from our current situations from our from our our our our our our I'll say sometimes that they horrible situations that we're going through that we're dealing with amen and we're looking for answers but God's thoughts they will lead us to Freedom do you believe that how many times have we heard I've got to stop watching the news it's so depressing because those thoughts lead us in a certain direction I got to get this out of my mind is bringing me down I got to stop listening to that stuff it it's just making me so anxious so if certain thoughts can bring us down I want to say today there are certain thoughts that can bring us up to whom you yield yourself vant is that his servant you are to whom you obey God's thoughts as much as this may seem boring to you and you don't feel like reading it today read it read it well I have a hard time reading ask somebody to read it to you get it on tape listen to it do what you got to do because God is not going to come and force his thoughts into you amen when the thoughts of God come to us there they're they're the seed that will start to bring the strongholds to break the strongholds in our mind now I know we all like the the the things of uh mighty deliverances and I can stand here today God has delivered me I know God as a deliverer and so many things in my life he has delivered me of in other words I could not have done it by myself I could not have done it of myself it was him that did it and I'm okay with that I give him all the glory for it but I want you to understand we don't always get delivered the way we would like to see things delivered sometimes it's one day at a time God wants us to see us take a step towards him but God's thoughts will always lead us to Freedom his thoughts are good his thoughts are are comforting his thoughts are healthy his thoughts are victorious in Jeremiah 19 you know or 29 verse 11 for I know the thoughts I think toward you sayeth the Lord they are thoughts of peace they are not of evil and they're to give you an expected think about this I am evil that's what Jesus said and Paul said there's there's there's none good there's none that are righteous and Jesus said in another place you be evil in order to give good gifts how much more the heavenly father give you the Holy Ghost now God knows our condition and how bad and rotten we are yet his thoughts towards us are healthy thoughts there are good thoughts amen there are thoughts about I haven't expected in for brother Ben I an expected end for brother Dennis I an expected end for brother Roger an expected end and and this leads us to that End Amen but I want you to understand this not everyone that saith Lord Lord is going there the the what's scary about coming to Church brother R says you never leave the same you either are drawn closer to God or you're further way than you leave and it's all determined on one thing that Freemore agency whether you accept the word and you say God I see right now clearly you spoke this morning to my heart I know what you want me to do and I will start walking in that direction but if you take it lightly and it's just like any other thought that comes into your head you don't reverence it you don't it's not sacred to you you just let any old thought into your head I am telling you you may not realize it but you're going to be further away from God down the road when you need him it be harder to get a hold of him because God expects reverence amen he wants you to tremble at the word tremble Jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed Lord help me is is lots of scriptures here yet to go and I didn't have many scriptures not as many as I usually have there still a lot if you continue in my word then are you my disciples and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free right so God gives us his word if we walk out of here and continue in the word that he gave us then we will become more free now I'll tell you there's a lot of people there's a lot of Christians there's a lot of professing believers who go to church who are entertained and they come out and they're just as happy and content as could be they think they're so free that ain't the freedom I'm talking about the freedom I'm talking about is you've been set free from yourself you no longer have to live for yourself you no longer have to your time is so precious to you because you've given it all to God only thing you want to do is make God happy amen that's the freedom I'm talking about and if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed the Bible is filled with the thoughts of God expressed to us we need to read it we need to ponder the thoughts if we accept God's word which is a seed you know when you read the word just you understand you get a thought from that word when you read it is that true you read a book you kind of get a story in your mind what's going on even up here you're hearing the word of God being preached by a man but it's coming to you as a thought and that thought is a word seed thought and when you accept that word seed into the womb of your mind that is what brings the seed in you say yes I believe it it and you believe it to the point now not intellectually but you believe it to the point that it comes into your heart and you say God I love your word I want to do this word I want to do what you're telling me to do it will bring forth the life of the word it'll lead you to joy and happiness it'll be no problem living for others not everybody that hears the word receives the word Hebrews 4:2 you want to write it down Hebrews 21: 1 through3 if you want to write it down you've got to mix the word with a faith okay for a moment let's say that our minds are all tore up in life we're plagued with a mixture of fear and anxiety we're feeling frustrated we're in a state of confusion we're we're we're left alone feeling like nobody cares and nobody understands maybe we feel like we're in a prison in our minds and there's padlocks on the door I feel like I could I could write a [Laughter] song have you ever been there but the Bible tells us is Exodus 15:26 for I am the Lord that Health Thee the thoughts of God are expressed in his word Isaiah 26:3 says he will keep us in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on the Lord because he trusteth in thee so it doesn't matter how mixed up the mind is no matter what you're feeling what you're going through you do not need the circumstance fixed come on now you do not need the circumstance fixed what you need is the peace of God in your heart circumstance can be twice as worse the next day but if you've got peace he will keep you in that time of trial all you got to do is learn to trust the Lord more amen God's word is a seed its purpose is to be planted in our heart through the womb of our mind and to prosper travels to our minds in the form of a thought if we accept it to the point that we yield to it to whom you yield yourself servants to be his servant you are so if you start obeying that word how do you obey that word oh um Lord I just got distracted I just Lord thank you I'm just going to spend some time reading it just doesn't seem to be enough the thoughts are still coming I can't I'm going to put a tape on tape but you know thoughts you know I'm going to spend some time praying and you're actually obeying what the word says you're forcing yourself to keep your mind State on the Lord I am telling you God will reward you with peace as sure as anything because God is a deliver but if you don't want to pay the price and you want to allow any thought to come into your head tell me how can you be a soldier as a witness for Jesus Christ and stand there and say look at me follow me Paul said follow me as I follow Christ amen it's time that we get serious with this word serious when we follow God's word we Prosper am when we follow any other thought it'll show up down the road I love 2 Chronicles 2020 because a lot of people you know they think they believe right they think they believe that but the devil believes they think they're established hey I think the devil's established right Satan doesn't cast out Satan his kingdom would be divided and they Rose early in the morning went forth to the church chur in Fenton Michigan and as they went jehos stood and said hear me oh Judea Judah I'm sorry and ye habitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established I don't know what that means to you but I can guarantee next Wednesday or Sunday whenever you come to church next time this foundation and this building isn't going to be over there it it is established here a Christian when you think of a Christian established Christian is the same yes and if if you're going to have a weak mind and always you're going to say well at least I come to church once in a while that's better than my so and so my friend does that's not an established Christian if you're going to compare yourself with anybody else that is not wise you got to establish yourself with with the word we we got Paul as an example we we we got Christ as an example we got the dis the the disciples we we've got the God sent a a wave sheep in this in this hour to let us know what kind of life we need to be living you can fool some of the people some of the time but you can't fool all the people all the time we need to get more serious with the word of God and believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established Believe In His prophets so shall ye Prosper well I'll tell you I want the word of God just bubbling up inside of me I I want to be prospering spiritually that's what I want amen all right Isaiah 55:6 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts that came from the devil that started from the devil and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and our and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways amen wow I know if I don't get this down my sweet wife will um we share the information with me after the service but I never realize it's hot or cold till it gets to an extreme and it's it's a little bit warm right now for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts but this is what I love about God's thoughts verse 11 so so shall my word which basically is a thought expressed right be that gold forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing wherein to I sent it so I say today if we're here today and we hear God speak to us it is a beautiful thing because the reason that he has spoken is because he wants his word to prosper in our lives let's Stand Together let's take better control of our mind amen by letting the mind that was in Christ be in US amen you have the final say so you have control what goes in your mind make a commitment to God that you're going to be more Vigilant you're not just going to allow thoughts even though even though they're true they may not be pure may not be a good report right so the devil's kind of tricky make sure it passes the test amen yes let's sing without him I could do [Music] nothing without him I could do nothing without him might surely fail without him I would be drifting like a ship without a s [Music] Jus oh Jesus do you know him today please don't turn him away Jesus oh [Music] Jesus without him how lost I would be without him I would be dying [Music] without I would be a slave without him life would be hopeless but with Jesus thank God I'm saved Jesus Oh Jes Jesus do you know him today please don't turn him away Jesus oh Jesus without him how lost I would be so I'll ask him to be my my pilot his word my compass and God I rank safely in glory without him I drift with the time Jesus oh oh Jesus do you know him today please don't turn him away Jesus oh Jesus without him how lost I would be the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in me the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you in all lives frustrations I need you I know I do for the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you think about it in all lives frustrations I need you I know I [Music] do oh the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you amen she continues to play that the only real peace I wonder today if there's someone that's says brother John I'm serious about this message that I heard today I know it's true but today I want to start activating the word of God in my life I believe God sent this message I know part of the reason that God sent this message I know it was for everybody but I I really believe this message was for me to follow and I'll just say if if that's how you feel and this this is not for everybody if that but that's how you feel I want you to come forward and I want to pray with you here I want to pray right with you here because if you feel that you really mean business with God I believe God wants to God wants to bless us I believe that God said that he would do excedy above all that we could ask or even think God don't want to waste our time God loves us now look I'm I'm telling you today you do not have to listen to anything that comes into your head you have control of your mind and we're going to pray today that we're going to harness that control and I want you to believe it now it's the Bible says it's through Christ right we're looking to him in prayer and it's through Christ that we take control of the of of the enemy Heavenly Father we bow our hearts before you humbly Lord you said that you would you would look upon him who is a broken a contrite and he that trembleth at Thy word today Lord here is your bride standing up here they want the womb of their mind to be only impregnated with the thoughts of God lord as the stand here today Lord lord they're wanting to gain control father of their thought patterns as they leave here Lord they want to be more conscious of what thoughts they think about they want to be able to quickly discern right from wrong the thoughts of Heaven versus the thoughts of the enemy that is a mixture and I pray that you would bless everyone Lord with that discernment father that spiritual discernment in their heart and may their love for you be the the thing that pulsates that energizes that awareness and that that quickening to their minds that they may say to the wrong thoughts get behind me Satan get behind me Satan just like Lord you did to Satan on that mountain just like just like when you were in the garden when you said not my will but thy will be done Lord I pray as your as your beloved bride as they spend more time reading the Bible your precious word as they spend more time in prayer in their homes as they dedicate that half hour before service in the prayer closet Lord I pray that you would come and strengthen each and everyone in their mind father that Lord that they would gain back every part Lord that theyve let slip away God that you would for if y each of us Lord that we could be strong in the Lord and the power of thy might father for we're
