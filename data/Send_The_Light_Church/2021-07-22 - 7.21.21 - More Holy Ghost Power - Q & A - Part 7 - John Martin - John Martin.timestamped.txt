[29:17] i uh these would be some more people on

[29:28] sister cheryl want to remember to
[29:30] continue to pray for her
[29:31] um she's not feeling real well but i was
[29:34] wondering is everybody got
[29:36] feel good with the temperature at this
[29:38] time
[29:40] a little hot a little hot we got some
[29:42] people saying a little cold
[29:45] feels good you know i
[29:48] we got a good happy medium that's that
[29:50] was the main thing if everybody's
[29:51] leaning until
[29:52] one way you know that i could help but
[29:56] uh well praise the lord let's turn to
[29:58] the book of acts for opening scripture
[30:00] we'll have a word of prayer have you be
[30:03] seated then we'll
[30:04] we want to kind of finish up the
[30:07] questions and answers
[30:08] today if we could
[30:12] i sure have enjoyed them amen
[30:16] amen let's now in prayer and just ask
[30:19] god to be with us
[30:21] lord we stand here helpless
[30:24] without you we don't have anything to
[30:28] stand on
[30:29] without you and lord we don't want to be
[30:32] up here without you we don't want to
[30:35] read
[30:36] your word without your uh your holy
[30:39] spirit we don't want to hear
[30:41] this word without the holy spirit we
[30:43] just need you
[30:44] in everything lord come prepare our
[30:47] hearts
[30:47] our minds and to be able to receive
[30:51] what you have for us today we thank you
[30:53] for this now
[30:54] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[30:58] amen acts chapter one starting with
[31:01] verse number four
[31:02] and being assembled together with them
[31:05] he commanded them that they should not
[31:07] depart of jerusalem but wait
[31:09] for the power oh i'm sorry for the
[31:11] promise
[31:12] of the father i just gave it away what
[31:14] the promises
[31:16] which saith he ye have heard of me for
[31:18] john truly baptized with water
[31:21] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[31:23] ghost not many days hence
[31:26] when they therefore were come together
[31:28] they asked of him saying
[31:30] lord will thou at this time restore
[31:32] again the kingdom to israel
[31:35] and he said unto them it is not for you
[31:37] to know
[31:38] the time so there are certain times
[31:40] certain things that we're not to know
[31:42] or of the seasons which the father have
[31:45] put into his
[31:46] own power
[31:50] but i'm going to give you power
[31:54] but you shall receive power after the
[31:56] holy ghost has come upon you and you
[31:58] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[32:00] jerusalem and in judea and in samaria
[32:02] and on
[32:03] to the uttermost parts of the earth
[32:07] amen god bless you may be seated we love
[32:10] these
[32:11] words i'll tell you the holy ghost is
[32:14] what we really need amen
[32:16] amen well we had two questions
[32:20] left and um they're not together
[32:24] but i want to go over them both uh one
[32:27] i'd like to make it short and the first
[32:29] this first question is when our loved
[32:32] ones
[32:33] that our true believers pass away
[32:36] are they with jesus awake
[32:40] or are they sleeping until the rapture
[32:44] so this is a good question and the
[32:47] answer is
[32:48] they are both awake and they are
[32:50] sleeping
[32:53] the bible says the dead in christ
[32:56] are sleeping so why do they use
[33:00] the word sleeping because the word
[33:04] jesus used the word dead
[33:07] and we're going to read some scriptures
[33:11] here but
[33:11] they're not sleeping as we would think
[33:14] they're sleeping they're not dead as we
[33:15] would think they were dead and they're
[33:16] not sleeping as we would think sleeping
[33:18] is
[33:19] but it's the same principle as if they
[33:23] were
[33:23] so let's just imagine somebody's at your
[33:25] house and they're sleeping
[33:27] and you there they just fell asleep in
[33:30] the living room after dinner
[33:32] and you're having a conversation but the
[33:35] person sleeping doesn't
[33:36] hear one thing that you're saying they
[33:39] are alive they are there
[33:43] but they're sleeping they're in a
[33:45] they're
[33:46] they're they're in another conscious
[33:48] they're conscious they're they're not
[33:49] with you
[33:50] they're in another conscious
[33:56] so it's the same thing with those
[33:59] of our loved ones who are in christ and
[34:02] they've gone
[34:02] on to be on the other side
[34:09] they are alive and well
[34:15] they're not sleeping but in the same
[34:20] principle we don't have access to the
[34:23] their conscience where they're at and um
[34:28] they're if i could say it like this we
[34:31] want to look at that word as
[34:32] waiting um
[34:36] um we're waiting for bob
[34:39] to wake up he's taking a nap he's alive
[34:42] but we're waiting for him
[34:44] to to to get up the same with those that
[34:47] that are are going on to the other side
[34:50] they're in
[34:51] a waiting place and um
[34:54] we don't have access to them but they're
[34:56] alive so they're not dead amen
[35:01] they're away from us just like someone
[35:03] who's snoring and sleeping
[35:05] they're in another realm as it were
[35:09] um these are in another dimension in
[35:12] their waiting so let's
[35:13] look at some scripture here that's first
[35:15] thessalonians chapter four
[35:21] i believe that is why the word sleeping
[35:23] is being used
[35:28] but i would not have you to be ignorant
[35:30] brethren concerning them which
[35:31] are asleep that ye sorrow not even as
[35:35] others
[35:35] which have no hope
[35:38] you know somebody that's sleeping you
[35:40] have a hope that they're gonna
[35:42] you know get up in the morning that
[35:43] they're going to wake up
[35:45] someone that's dead there's no hope okay
[35:49] for if we believe that jesus died and
[35:51] rose again even so then which
[35:53] sleep in jesus will god bring with
[35:57] him amen
[36:00] for this we say unto you by the word of
[36:02] the lord that they which
[36:03] are a lie that's you and i and remain
[36:07] unto the second coming
[36:11] of the lord if i could say it like that
[36:14] shall not
[36:15] prevent or precede
[36:19] them which are asleep
[36:22] so god
[36:26] is going to bring them
[36:29] with him and then they're going to meet
[36:32] us
[36:34] for the lord himself shall descend from
[36:36] heaven with
[36:37] a shout brother man toast that's the
[36:39] message
[36:41] with the voice of the archangel that's
[36:44] christ himself
[36:46] and with the trumpet of god and we know
[36:49] that's the
[36:50] announcement of the marriage supper
[36:55] and the dead in christ shall
[36:59] rise first
[37:03] so he gets them first
[37:08] these are the ones that are waiting
[37:13] if i can say this i don't want to
[37:14] stumble anybody but they are not with
[37:16] the lord yet
[37:19] when brother branham went beyond the
[37:21] curtain of time
[37:23] and he was so anxious to see jesus he
[37:25] said where's jesus
[37:27] and they said can't see him right now
[37:29] he's up a little higher
[37:32] so in one sense
[37:36] god's presence is with them just like
[37:38] god's presence is with us
[37:40] but it's not just great great rape next
[37:43] to us
[37:44] not right right next to them it's gonna
[37:46] happen
[37:48] at this time it's just a combination
[37:49] he's going to get them be with them and
[37:51] they're going to we're going to meet him
[37:52] in the air
[37:54] isn't that beautiful so they're waiting
[37:58] for the appropriate time
[38:01] then we which are alive and remain shall
[38:04] be caught up together
[38:06] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[38:09] in the air so
[38:10] shall we ever ever ever we're not going
[38:13] to be separated anymore
[38:15] ever be with the lord wherefore comfort
[38:19] one another with these words and i think
[38:20] with all the trials that we go through
[38:22] we need to just comfort one another with
[38:24] these words
[38:26] now brother branham said in the message
[38:28] the uncertain sound he said we which are
[38:30] alive and remain
[38:31] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[38:34] are asleep for the trumpet shall sound
[38:36] all those soldiers laying under asleep
[38:39] across through the ages
[38:40] but when the trumpet sounds though they
[38:43] be dead
[38:45] in sleep that's how he said it though
[38:47] they be dead
[38:48] in sleep shall not hinder them for the
[38:50] trumpet shall sound and awaken them
[38:55] they're prepared those unprepared
[38:58] don't know the sound when the sound of
[39:01] the coming of the lord blasts
[39:03] it shall shake heaven and hell when it
[39:06] blasts
[39:06] but those who are in hell those who are
[39:09] lost
[39:10] don't know the sound
[39:14] they don't know what to do but those
[39:18] though but those though they be sleeping
[39:22] in christ they know that certain
[39:26] sounds that's why we're here today
[39:29] is to to know the sound of the gospel to
[39:31] know the voice of god and
[39:33] and to grow amen
[39:38] now um
[39:42] when we i'd asked you to if you had any
[39:45] questions i wanted
[39:47] one thing to be the common denominator
[39:49] and that these
[39:50] questions should resolve around your
[39:53] personal relationship with jesus christ
[39:57] and i'm so glad
[40:00] because that's we don't have time to be
[40:02] working on anything else except our
[40:04] relationship with god
[40:06] it's getting late but the majority of
[40:09] the questions
[40:11] had to do with some sort of spiritual
[40:14] warfare now what's
[40:18] important to understand this is that if
[40:20] we want to build a relationship with god
[40:24] we're going to have to go through a
[40:25] spiritual warfare
[40:30] questions like how can i overcome how
[40:32] can i combat what are the best devices
[40:34] to use against satan
[40:36] even when we think about the best way to
[40:38] approach
[40:39] god satan is there he has it out for us
[40:41] and he don't want us to approach god
[40:45] or even when we set out to be an
[40:47] undeniable witness for christ
[40:49] satan's intentions are to block us so we
[40:52] don't witness
[40:54] so leaving us in some sort of spiritual
[40:56] warfare
[40:58] and even this last question we see a
[41:00] spiritual battle here
[41:02] and that question is how to have a
[41:05] conviction
[41:06] that the lord has put on your heart but
[41:09] since you're so embarrassed
[41:11] it's hard to confront the person and the
[41:13] person doesn't even know
[41:16] that you did this wrong
[41:20] so the lord has told this believer to do
[41:22] something
[41:25] but this thing that was asked of the
[41:27] lord
[41:29] somehow brought an embarrassment
[41:33] to them are you with me
[41:39] there's nothing more than a spiritual
[41:42] battle
[41:43] going on in the mind amen the devil is
[41:46] always presenting his case
[41:49] why we shouldn't have to follow through
[41:50] with what god said
[41:54] of course the devil basically
[41:57] he just doesn't want us to do anything
[41:59] that god wants us to do
[42:02] but jesus taught us to pray thy will be
[42:05] done
[42:05] here on earth as it is in heaven amen so
[42:08] there's the spiritual
[42:10] the battle now when all these
[42:13] thoughts are happening in our mind we
[42:15] need to remember
[42:16] that we're engaging in a spiritual
[42:18] battle
[42:20] these battles cannot be won with logic
[42:23] with feelings with emotions
[42:26] because they're spiritual
[42:29] we must remember above everything that
[42:32] soon as this stuff starts happening
[42:34] we've entered a spiritual battle
[42:37] ephesians 6 verse 12 says for we wrestle
[42:40] not against flesh and blood
[42:42] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[42:45] so we hear something and we feel that we
[42:47] need to
[42:48] do this or the lord asks us to do that
[42:50] but we we begin to reason and thinking
[42:52] and with feelings and emotions and logic
[42:55] and what are they going to think and
[42:56] this that is that a big deal before you
[42:58] know it we're trying to handle this
[43:00] without a spiritual warfare
[43:04] right in other words we're trying to be
[43:05] carnal logical about it
[43:07] and be smart
[43:11] if you ever ever ever plan on winning a
[43:14] spiritual battle
[43:15] you need to stop wrestling with your
[43:17] carnal flesh
[43:19] or somebody else's carnal flesh
[43:22] you need to put the mind of christ on
[43:25] that's where the battle
[43:26] is happening is in our mind and we need
[43:28] the mind of christ to win
[43:30] amen the mind of christ says
[43:35] put on the whole armor of god
[43:39] that you might be able to stand
[43:43] so we need to put the whole armor of god
[43:46] against
[43:47] principalities against powers against
[43:50] rulers of darkness of this world against
[43:53] spiritual wickedness in our places i'm
[43:55] glad
[43:55] they use that word against
[43:58] we need the whole armor of god to go
[44:01] against
[44:02] these negative spirits that are
[44:04] attacking our mind
[44:06] amen they're against the thoughts
[44:11] of god that's true
[44:14] now if you know where these thoughts are
[44:16] really coming from
[44:18] you'll cast them down but to see the key
[44:21] is satan
[44:23] wants us to think
[44:26] that they're not coming from him
[44:30] and that's where all the logic comes in
[44:31] where you got to like figure it all out
[44:35] god don't want us to figure anything out
[44:37] he just wants us to do what he told us
[44:39] to do
[44:41] amen
[44:44] second corinthians chapter 10 verse
[44:46] three for though we walk in the flesh
[44:48] we do not war after the flesh for the
[44:50] weapons of our warfare
[44:52] are not carnal but they're mighty
[44:55] through god to the pulling down
[44:57] of strongholds
[45:08] we don't want to try some carnal way to
[45:11] get out of the situation or to prove a
[45:14] right
[45:16] or to make some point those are
[45:19] carnal devices
[45:22] that's where you're trying to involve
[45:26] yourself in the battle and handle the
[45:29] battle your way
[45:32] that has to be gone
[45:37] we've got to put more practice into
[45:40] dealing
[45:41] with the spiritual battles god's way and
[45:44] his way
[45:44] is just cast the imagination down you
[45:47] know what to do just cast everything
[45:48] down
[45:50] can you imagine if jesus said if you got
[45:52] out against your brother
[45:53] why don't you take some time to think
[45:55] about it and see really who caused it
[45:57] and um you know you need to just make
[45:59] sure
[46:00] that it's proper for you to go to that
[46:02] person because
[46:03] it could be more their fault than your
[46:05] fault and if it is it can bring more
[46:07] confusion
[46:08] and you don't want to do that so let's
[46:14] you just gotta cast it down he told us
[46:18] what to do just do it
[46:19] amen cast out imaginations and every
[46:22] high thing that exalteth
[46:24] itself against the knowledge of god and
[46:26] bring into captivity every
[46:28] thought to the obedience see the
[46:31] thoughts that we're getting
[46:32] is satan trying to get us not to be
[46:34] obedient
[46:35] amen amen
[46:38] and having in a readiness to revenge all
[46:41] disobedience
[46:42] when our obedience is fulfilled
[46:47] so you just gotta i'm i'm so against
[46:50] this not doing what the lord wants me to
[46:52] do
[46:54] i'm just so ready i'm moving forward
[46:59] do ye look on the things after the
[47:02] outward appearance
[47:05] if any man trust himself to be that he
[47:07] is christ
[47:08] let him think let him
[47:11] of himself think this again that as he
[47:14] is christ even
[47:15] so are we christ in other words
[47:19] you may not always agree what the bible
[47:21] says and think that your
[47:23] christ but paul's taking us right back
[47:26] to the word
[47:28] so who cares about the outward
[47:30] appearance just
[47:31] focus on this thing right here
[47:35] usually when we do something wrong and
[47:38] we're all experts at that today
[47:42] we've been well trained by the best
[47:46] but when we do something wrong we
[47:48] realize
[47:50] afterwards we began to
[47:53] just naturally feel bad about it why did
[47:56] i do that
[47:57] why did i say that why did i act like
[48:00] that
[48:01] why was i being so stubborn why was i
[48:04] being unworkable
[48:06] why was i being impatient and and
[48:08] critical
[48:10] why didn't i try harder why didn't i go
[48:12] the second mile
[48:13] why did i just turn my cheek why didn't
[48:16] i just keep my mouth shut
[48:18] why didn't i just let it go why don't i
[48:20] just forgive them again
[48:22] why don't i just cover them with love
[48:26] why didn't i pray first offer a helping
[48:29] hand why did i just
[48:30] wash their feet why didn't i do unto
[48:33] others
[48:34] as i would have them do unto me and i'll
[48:36] tell you that
[48:37] it's almost endless of the things that
[48:40] we do
[48:40] or don't do and afterwards calls us to
[48:43] feel
[48:44] awkward sheepish embarrassed ashamed
[48:48] self-doubting rattled nervous disturbed
[48:51] uncomfortable withdrawn disappointed
[48:54] helpless
[48:55] down discouraging even sometimes
[48:58] defeated
[48:59] as a believer
[49:03] so this is a question not for the person
[49:06] who wrote it but this is a question for
[49:07] all of us
[49:08] [Music]
[49:10] how do we deal with this thing
[49:15] and what we really need when we're
[49:17] feeling this way
[49:18] is simply the power of the holy ghost
[49:25] we try to deal with all these things
[49:30] carnally and you just need the power of
[49:34] the holy ghost
[49:36] it's not so much what we've done or what
[49:38] we haven't done is the issue
[49:40] the issue is what needs to be done
[49:43] afterwards
[49:44] but the man says it's not the action but
[49:46] the reaction that counts
[49:48] we're in a battle we're going in and out
[49:51] of war zones constantly
[49:54] and we need to know how to react we need
[49:57] to be
[49:58] instant in season and out of season and
[50:00] what can help us
[50:02] is nothing but the holy ghost
[50:07] we need the power of god amen
[50:11] it'll take care of this stuff amen
[50:16] imagine that you did one of these
[50:17] bonehead mistakes
[50:20] maybe you acted like bozo maybe you were
[50:23] acting like humpty dumpty sitting on a
[50:25] wall too long
[50:28] and afterwards you're feeling so
[50:31] awkwardly
[50:32] embarrassed and you just wish
[50:36] you could just get some sort of
[50:37] counseling
[50:39] about the situation from jesus
[50:44] i would imagine jesus counseling us and
[50:47] telling us
[50:48] that you're no match for the devil
[50:51] because what's happening right now
[50:53] is the devil is pouncing now he wants to
[50:55] sift you like wheat
[50:56] yes amen i would imagine jesus
[51:00] telling us that what we really need is
[51:01] to get the power of the holy ghost
[51:03] because there's only thing
[51:04] only one thing greater than the power of
[51:06] the devil and that is the power of god
[51:10] not us thinking that we're greater than
[51:12] the devil
[51:16] revelation chapter 3 verse 18 let's get
[51:18] some real counseling from jesus
[51:21] he said i counsel thee
[51:24] to buy of me
[51:28] gold tried in the fire amen
[51:31] that thou mayest be rich amen and white
[51:35] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[51:37] and that the shame of thy nakedness
[51:41] do not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[51:44] isaf
[51:45] that thou mayest see
[51:51] god knows that the only thing that's
[51:54] going to defeat this situation
[51:57] is deity is god himself
[52:00] and we can't go to anybody else but god
[52:03] for that amen
[52:06] come by of me gold tried in the fire
[52:09] the thing of it it's not free you have
[52:12] to buy
[52:14] you're not buying with money but it will
[52:17] cost you your will
[52:18] it'll cost you your pride it'll cost
[52:20] your arrogancy
[52:22] you have to hunger and thirst for god to
[52:25] get more of god
[52:26] and cry out for the power of the holy
[52:28] ghost and i know this is an
[52:30] old-time religion but that's what we
[52:33] need give me this old-time religion
[52:36] [Music]
[52:38] amen you know we can have holy ghosts
[52:41] and it can slip
[52:41] out
[52:45] we need to get revived amen
[52:49] anything no there's nothing more that
[52:51] will encourage us and keep us
[52:53] like the holy ghost that's right that's
[52:56] right
[52:57] and being assembled together acts
[53:00] chapter 1 verse 4 opening scripture
[53:02] being assembled together with them
[53:04] commanded them that they should not
[53:06] depart from jerusalem
[53:08] but wait for the promise of the father
[53:12] now the promise from the father is
[53:15] a power and that's
[53:18] we we have we all make these bloops all
[53:21] the time
[53:22] right do we not in some fashion formal
[53:24] way they're happening
[53:25] all the time now what we need is a power
[53:28] to deal with it
[53:29] correctly yes yes we want a power not to
[53:33] do it
[53:35] but no it cannot be expected of any
[53:38] human being
[53:39] to go through life and not have some
[53:41] sort of
[53:42] regrets some scars or
[53:46] things that they've done wrong we're
[53:47] human beings
[53:50] so we're not looking to perfect flesh
[53:53] don't never happen but we need the power
[53:56] of god how to deal with this flesh
[54:00] and and and jesus promised us
[54:03] power when we get the holy ghost
[54:07] he said john truly baptized with water
[54:09] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[54:11] ghost
[54:15] now for you that have the holy ghost
[54:19] this message is really for you
[54:24] because we don't have enough holy ghost
[54:30] you have if you had twice the holy ghost
[54:33] that you have today
[54:34] you would have you still need more
[54:37] that's true
[54:38] because we got it in in measure and
[54:40] portion but the thing of it is
[54:44] our blunders come from not having enough
[54:47] of god
[54:49] and how we react to our blunders has a
[54:51] lot to do with not having enough
[54:55] realness to deal with the situation this
[54:57] is it
[54:58] we're like wondering what do i do what
[54:59] do i do well god is not wondering what
[55:02] to do we just need him inside and then
[55:04] we know what to do
[55:06] so i say it like this focus
[55:09] on hungering for more of god and not
[55:13] feeling that i i already have god
[55:17] because this this this message can't
[55:19] help
[55:21] if you already have enough of god
[55:29] i'm not saying doubt what you have i'm
[55:32] saying realize there's more
[55:36] there's more there's more and and more
[55:39] gives
[55:39] more victory more joy more peace more
[55:42] love more giving more laying down your
[55:43] life
[55:44] more not hurting
[55:49] when they therefore were come together
[55:52] they asked of him saying lord
[55:55] will thou at this time restore again
[55:59] the kingdom to israel
[56:02] and he said unto them it is not for you
[56:05] to know
[56:07] the times or the seasons which the
[56:09] father have put
[56:12] in his own power
[56:15] this is so amazing to me that he uses
[56:19] the word power he doesn't say that's you
[56:21] know that's just for the father
[56:24] he's got that handle he's bringing this
[56:28] to the knowledge that it's a power
[56:32] jesus says i have i have power to lay
[56:34] down my life i have power to raise it up
[56:36] amen he said you he told uh pilate you
[56:39] don't have
[56:40] a power to do anything let's say given
[56:41] to give it to you of my father
[56:45] now here's here's the thing when we look
[56:48] at all these blunders and we look at the
[56:49] question and how many times have you did
[56:51] something or
[56:52] and you just felt so awkward embarrassed
[56:54] and shamed and
[56:55] you just you got rattled from the
[56:57] situation
[56:58] and you just wish that you had something
[57:01] greater than what you had
[57:03] that's power
[57:06] but imagine jesus just
[57:09] when jesus stood by brother branham
[57:15] he says now i take every spirit in my
[57:18] control
[57:21] fearless amen that was tommy hicks's
[57:25] testimony you may not agree with this
[57:28] man
[57:30] but he's fearless in what he believes
[57:34] this is what we need not to allow the
[57:37] devil
[57:38] to make us so cow down and sheepish
[57:41] about some situation
[57:45] you know sometimes it's so hard for
[57:46] somebody just to say
[57:48] i'm sorry so hard
[57:52] for them to say i miss the mark i'm
[57:55] sorry
[58:00] it's because it's lacking the power of
[58:01] the holy ghost
[58:08] but you shall receive power after
[58:11] the holy ghost is come upon
[58:14] you so
[58:18] i want to say to all of us we all got a
[58:20] portion of the holy ghost brother
[58:22] branham said justification was a portion
[58:24] of the holy ghost
[58:27] but i want a greater power than what i
[58:30] have
[58:32] and i believe to this day i believe i
[58:34] would have more power of the holy ghost
[58:36] today
[58:37] if i would have spent more time seeking
[58:39] the holy ghost before today
[58:43] amen we have not because we ask not
[58:47] and the devil is doing a good job saying
[58:49] you got it you got it you got it you got
[58:50] it you got it you got enough
[58:54] but then we find ourselves all the time
[58:57] wondering why we're feeling the way
[58:59] we're feeling
[59:06] god's got the answer for us
[59:10] it's through the power of the holy
[59:11] spirit
[59:14] and i want power to lay down my life
[59:18] i want power because if i'm able to lay
[59:21] down my life
[59:23] i know god will give me power
[59:27] for a rapture
[59:31] but if i don't got power to lay down my
[59:32] life how is he going to give me the
[59:35] grace
[59:35] to go on a rapture
[59:43] the promise of the holy spirit comes
[59:45] with
[59:46] power power to witness
[59:51] when you say i'm sorry when you prefer
[59:54] your brother
[59:55] when you lay down your life when you
[59:57] wash somebody's feet
[59:59] when you turn your cheek
[1:00:02] you're a witness for christ amen
[1:00:06] it's not when you say
[1:00:10] hey jesus died for you i mean that's
[1:00:14] wonderful that's wonderful and we need
[1:00:17] that
[1:00:18] we need to go yelp but sometimes we need
[1:00:22] to be a witness
[1:00:23] inside a witness inside the church we're
[1:00:28] a family of god
[1:00:30] we're written of all men we see one
[1:00:32] another
[1:00:33] we're only deceiving ourselves thinking
[1:00:35] that we nobody sees
[1:00:37] who we are
[1:00:44] i think god wants us to wash one another
[1:00:48] the body washes the body amen
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:54] now when the promise of the holy spirit
[1:00:56] comes
[1:00:57] now we have power to take correction
[1:01:01] from the holy ghost
[1:01:05] because how many times has the lord said
[1:01:07] something to us i don't know
[1:01:14] what's happening is you're separating
[1:01:16] yourself from the holy ghost
[1:01:20] but if the holy ghost had his way yes
[1:01:23] sir lord
[1:01:26] right brother brandon says if he could
[1:01:28] just get one man in his hands he could
[1:01:30] turn the world upside down
[1:01:31] he just wants to give us a little bit
[1:01:33] more of himself so we can handle
[1:01:35] the life that we're in
[1:01:38] he doesn't want us to go turn the world
[1:01:39] upside down he just wants us to turn our
[1:01:41] world upside down
[1:01:47] there's many many things jesus would
[1:01:50] like to say
[1:01:52] but without the power of the holy ghost
[1:01:54] we can't
[1:01:56] handle the truth
[1:01:59] we can't handle ben getting on our knees
[1:02:03] and washing somebody's dirty feet oh
[1:02:06] be it i'm going to do something like
[1:02:08] that and somebody might see me
[1:02:10] doing that
[1:02:15] well maybe jesus has called us to do
[1:02:17] that and if we do that out of obedience
[1:02:20] bring every thought into obedience to
[1:02:23] christ then maybe god will bless us with
[1:02:25] joy unspeakable
[1:02:26] and full of glory
[1:02:30] well i want the joy i want this i want
[1:02:32] maybe we need to do this
[1:02:34] first amen
[1:02:39] the holy ghost gives us power to react
[1:02:42] the right way to a wrong situation
[1:02:47] a right way to a wrong situation wrong
[1:02:50] situations are going to happen
[1:02:53] uh offenses are going to come amen
[1:02:56] trials are going to come
[1:02:57] amen in fact brother brian said the
[1:02:59] squeeze is going to get if there's going
[1:03:01] to be a squeeze and it's going to be
[1:03:03] harder
[1:03:03] than what we've ever had before it's
[1:03:06] things are going to happen amen what do
[1:03:09] we need the power of the holy ghost amen
[1:03:12] well how do we get it i come to church
[1:03:15] what else i got to do
[1:03:18] there's a lot more you need to do than
[1:03:20] come to church
[1:03:21] come to church don't give you the holy
[1:03:23] ghost but when you're serious about
[1:03:25] getting to church
[1:03:26] and what happens at church then you can
[1:03:30] receive more of the living word which is
[1:03:32] the holy ghost
[1:03:38] that's what the holy ghost is for it's
[1:03:40] to lead and guide us into all truth
[1:03:45] if a righteous man falls seven times
[1:03:48] he'll get back up
[1:03:49] and he'll keep moving forward
[1:03:53] so it's not about trying to be someone
[1:03:55] who doesn't fall
[1:03:58] it's about being honest about your fall
[1:04:00] and get back up and keep moving
[1:04:03] if someone asks you to go a mile he'll
[1:04:05] gladly
[1:04:07] go too right now well i
[1:04:10] you know i guess i got to go too
[1:04:16] i believe if we got the holy ghost we're
[1:04:17] going to want to turn the cheek
[1:04:23] we'll wash somebody's feet
[1:04:27] and if the person is too blind to even
[1:04:29] see that they got dirty feet
[1:04:31] you'll still wash them well it just
[1:04:35] seems like it's in vain they're using me
[1:04:36] they don't even
[1:04:38] you know what
[1:04:41] god in you is god in you doing
[1:04:45] no matter he's no respecter of persons
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:50] i don't care if someone's some
[1:04:51] somebody's trying to sabotage you behind
[1:04:53] your back
[1:04:56] the holy ghost knows what to do
[1:05:00] the holy ghost doesn't need to come to
[1:05:04] me and ask me for counseling what to do
[1:05:06] about this situation
[1:05:07] i need to go to the holy ghost and get
[1:05:10] counseling from him
[1:05:11] what to do with the situation
[1:05:14] and if the holy ghost is preeminent in
[1:05:16] you it just handles the situation
[1:05:19] amen and that's us learning to yield
[1:05:24] the holy ghost gives us power to witness
[1:05:26] with our lives
[1:05:28] to me every bad situation provides an
[1:05:30] opportunity to witness for christ
[1:05:34] don't be afraid of negative situations
[1:05:36] don't be afraid of mistakes
[1:05:39] it gives god a chance to show he is the
[1:05:41] same yesterday today and forever
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:46] like i said no one's ever going to be
[1:05:48] able to live without regret mistakes
[1:05:49] scars
[1:05:52] things that we're ashamed of
[1:05:55] but what we should be wanting is to
[1:05:57] limit them as much as possible
[1:06:00] which can only be done through the power
[1:06:02] of the holy ghost
[1:06:07] now we at work deal with a lot of
[1:06:10] problems
[1:06:10] every day that's what management's all
[1:06:14] about
[1:06:14] the buck stops here and one of the
[1:06:17] hardest
[1:06:18] things i feel to do is solve a problem
[1:06:20] without creating a new problem
[1:06:24] because most people when they want to
[1:06:26] solve problems
[1:06:28] they just they don't care what problems
[1:06:30] they create in the process
[1:06:31] they just go ahead and solve that one
[1:06:33] problem they don't care if they create
[1:06:35] five other problems
[1:06:39] that's not how the holy ghost works
[1:06:42] you solve the problem without creating
[1:06:44] new problems
[1:06:46] i'm telling you we need the power of the
[1:06:48] holy ghost
[1:06:57] i want to conclude i'm not concluding
[1:07:00] the service
[1:07:01] but i want to conclude this part
[1:07:05] let's get more serious about seeking
[1:07:07] more
[1:07:08] of the holy ghost amen no matter how
[1:07:10] much you have i say for whatever you
[1:07:12] have
[1:07:12] i praise god for it let's not stop there
[1:07:16] be willing to lift your hand just like
[1:07:19] someone who's a new believer
[1:07:21] that's seeking it you raise your hand
[1:07:23] with him and say god fill me with more
[1:07:25] the holy ghost too amen
[1:07:28] get out of the community and the network
[1:07:31] of having enough
[1:07:33] it is a community it is a network
[1:07:37] and the devils are working very hard to
[1:07:40] get you
[1:07:41] so you don't seek more of god
[1:07:46] because you'll be powerless
[1:07:49] get out of the atmosphere that breeds
[1:07:52] that you have
[1:07:52] enough holy ghost get out of those
[1:07:55] thoughts
[1:07:56] get out of those conversations get out
[1:07:59] of it
[1:08:00] how is god gonna how are you gonna ask
[1:08:03] for more if you think you got enough and
[1:08:05] you have not because you ask not
[1:08:08] i say set aside more time to die out
[1:08:13] set aside more time to die out
[1:08:16] not just the normal scenario do your
[1:08:19] prayer
[1:08:19] no just what are you going to do i'm
[1:08:21] going to go spend some rot out time
[1:08:24] i'm going to rot out
[1:08:28] set some time to deny your carnal nature
[1:08:31] to crucify the old man
[1:08:35] to deny your will
[1:08:39] just if that never happens
[1:08:44] how are you opening the door for god to
[1:08:47] come
[1:08:47] and give you more holy ghost he can't
[1:08:51] put anything more
[1:08:52] in there when it's so stuffed up with
[1:08:54] self
[1:08:55] amen satan is always trying we talked
[1:08:59] about this in our men's meeting
[1:09:00] satan is always trying to simultaneously
[1:09:03] think that you can have god
[1:09:05] in the world you can do your will in
[1:09:09] god's will
[1:09:10] you can do what you want and do what
[1:09:12] god's want
[1:09:14] we need to lay in the presence brother
[1:09:16] graham said
[1:09:17] of the s-o-n amen and allow the fruit
[1:09:21] of the holy ghost to ripen in our lives
[1:09:23] yes
[1:09:24] so i got some quotes i'd like to read if
[1:09:27] i could
[1:09:29] he says have to lay in the presence of
[1:09:30] the son this is trying to do god's
[1:09:32] service without
[1:09:33] it being god's will have to lay in the
[1:09:36] presence of the sun to be
[1:09:38] mellowed up that's all
[1:09:41] of it plenty of green
[1:09:44] we haven't got the sincerity
[1:09:48] now this is in 1965 this is in november
[1:09:53] of just one one month
[1:09:56] before his last sermon he says
[1:10:00] we're plenty green we haven't got the
[1:10:02] sincerity
[1:10:04] the sacredness the thing that ought to
[1:10:07] have
[1:10:08] in our midst to know the spirit of the
[1:10:11] living god
[1:10:13] moving in his word and showing us
[1:10:16] the things
[1:10:21] if god could tell the prophet we need to
[1:10:23] be more sincere he need to be more
[1:10:24] where does that put us
[1:10:28] i'm way down the totem pole way down the
[1:10:30] totem pole
[1:10:32] we simply need more of the holy ghost
[1:10:35] among us
[1:10:38] a lot less of our flesh
[1:10:42] and hold yourself accountable to
[1:10:46] where you're at the thing is
[1:10:50] if the devil can get you to think you're
[1:10:52] fine
[1:10:53] you're just coming here to get some
[1:10:55] knowledge learn a little bit more
[1:10:57] try to be a little bit better you know
[1:10:59] hopefully what we hear today is just
[1:11:01] going to make us a better
[1:11:03] there's no power in that that's a
[1:11:06] seminar
[1:11:07] thinking we need to get rid of that
[1:11:11] and say i need to leave here with power
[1:11:13] i need to leave here with power now that
[1:11:15] doesn't always mean
[1:11:16] coming up to the altar and seeking the
[1:11:19] holy ghost
[1:11:20] it may mean lord the word that i'm here
[1:11:22] and let it be living inside of me
[1:11:27] it's hungering for a living god and not
[1:11:30] being satisfied with just the
[1:11:32] the knowledge of the message
[1:11:37] brother branham said in the message
[1:11:40] christ is revealed in his own word he
[1:11:42] said the thing
[1:11:43] that's the matter with the message today
[1:11:48] is those who have obtained it in their
[1:11:50] hearts
[1:11:52] must lie in the presence of the sun
[1:11:55] to get ripened amen so they've received
[1:11:59] it
[1:12:00] but they just refuse to lay in the
[1:12:02] presence of the sun
[1:12:04] to make it real it's got to drop from
[1:12:07] here to here
[1:12:08] it's got to be lived out there's nothing
[1:12:11] that can
[1:12:11] substitute a church attendance typhain
[1:12:15] doing something nice for some that
[1:12:17] doesn't do it we gotta lay in the
[1:12:19] presence of the sun
[1:12:23] he says you can pick up the message
[1:12:27] and then let the sun bake all the
[1:12:30] greenness out of you
[1:12:32] see making you matured christians
[1:12:36] see what i mean god is coming soon
[1:12:39] to receive his church and we must have
[1:12:42] the type of christians
[1:12:44] for him to receive
[1:12:47] the wheat has got to get ripe we can't
[1:12:50] just be thinking i'm seed
[1:12:51] i'm seed i'm in the message
[1:12:57] how about being interested in getting
[1:12:59] ripe for him
[1:13:02] well i'm ripe enough okay okay okay
[1:13:06] but for those that hear the voice we
[1:13:08] need to get more of god
[1:13:11] we need to manifest more of god amen
[1:13:15] it's not for everybody that that is not
[1:13:17] for everybody
[1:13:20] in the message the invisible union of
[1:13:22] the bride of christ brother brandon said
[1:13:24] it's the grain it can't go no further
[1:13:27] we're at the end time so what does it
[1:13:30] have to do now
[1:13:31] lie in the presence of the sun to be
[1:13:34] ripened
[1:13:35] that's exact the word to be ripened
[1:13:38] into your heart to bring forth and live
[1:13:44] what we're talking about
[1:13:47] it can't be any plain we don't need we
[1:13:50] don't need more word
[1:13:56] we need the word that we have received
[1:13:59] to be living in us to be ripened and to
[1:14:03] be able to do what
[1:14:05] it says to do
[1:14:08] i won't be satisfied until i awaken that
[1:14:12] likeness
[1:14:14] in the message who do you say this is
[1:14:18] brother ben says now the wheat must be
[1:14:20] that way
[1:14:21] to lay in the presence of the sun to
[1:14:23] turn to
[1:14:24] a full gospel
[1:14:28] a golden grain for the master
[1:14:31] so this must become
[1:14:35] manifested in us a full gospel
[1:14:39] not just part
[1:14:42] i'm thankful for
[1:14:46] the the life of christ that's in me
[1:14:50] i'm ashamed for the life of christ
[1:14:52] that's not in me
[1:14:56] yes sir so where should my focus be
[1:15:05] these quote what brother bryan is saying
[1:15:07] laying the president's son laying the
[1:15:08] president he's not talking
[1:15:10] to unbelievers he's not talking to those
[1:15:12] that just
[1:15:13] came in amen
[1:15:20] wouldn't it be nice that you could walk
[1:15:23] up to anybody in the church
[1:15:25] hit them kick them do anything
[1:15:28] and they'd never do a thing to hurt you
[1:15:31] they'd be so full of god
[1:15:33] they'd never hurt you
[1:15:39] i can see why god doesn't want any isms
[1:15:41] in the body
[1:15:44] the way to have it is to have more god
[1:15:47] amen
[1:15:48] not to try to be better than the other
[1:15:49] person and prove that they're wrong
[1:15:51] and we just need to lay in the presence
[1:15:55] of the son
[1:15:56] amen you know to be honest with you
[1:16:00] if you think
[1:16:04] if somebody's going through a hard time
[1:16:06] and they're just
[1:16:10] you become the straw that breaks the
[1:16:13] camel's back if you know what i'm saying
[1:16:15] your situation
[1:16:19] god is placed in your hands an
[1:16:21] opportunity to be christ to them
[1:16:26] that to me is amazing
[1:16:29] that god would entrust any of us
[1:16:33] to be a witness
[1:16:37] and we look at it as oh why me why do i
[1:16:39] gotta go through this
[1:16:43] it's about helping somebody
[1:16:46] we need one another amen
[1:16:49] amen the message of man running from the
[1:16:52] presence
[1:16:53] of the lord brother ben says i believe
[1:16:55] we have the truth
[1:16:58] he said i'm satisfied with that
[1:17:01] i believe the wheat is absolutely the
[1:17:04] shuck
[1:17:04] is pulling away from it but the wheat
[1:17:08] has to lay in the presence of this s-o-n
[1:17:12] to ripen and that's what
[1:17:15] we're here for friend to stay in the
[1:17:18] presence of the son
[1:17:20] till our little group of people here
[1:17:24] to become so ripened to christ it
[1:17:27] becomes the bread on his table
[1:17:30] that's what i want to do and i love how
[1:17:34] he said it this little group here
[1:17:36] it just fits our little group here
[1:17:39] i love it
[1:17:45] it's the last year of his life he said
[1:17:46] that
[1:17:53] god's only place of worship god's only
[1:17:55] provided place of worship brother bram
[1:17:57] says just
[1:18:00] take my word for it if you believe me
[1:18:04] be sure to burn every bridge
[1:18:07] of the world behind you amen
[1:18:11] i believe the church is beginning to
[1:18:13] hear the message
[1:18:15] and beginning to understand this is
[1:18:18] one month one month
[1:18:21] before the accident he says i believe
[1:18:24] the church is beginning to hear the
[1:18:26] message
[1:18:26] and begin to understand it but friends
[1:18:29] listen
[1:18:30] we've got to lie in the presence of the
[1:18:32] son
[1:18:34] we've got to get ripened our faith isn't
[1:18:38] ripe
[1:18:40] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:18:42] that god has given us
[1:18:43] and we're seeing the signs that he has
[1:18:45] shown us
[1:18:48] and proving it by the bible it's there
[1:18:50] but
[1:18:51] oh how the church needs to lie in the
[1:18:54] presence
[1:18:55] till it's tendered up
[1:18:58] you know and gets sweet in the spirit
[1:19:02] so that it
[1:19:05] can bathe down
[1:19:09] i'll say it like this the message
[1:19:12] and all the quotes in the bible and all
[1:19:14] the quotes
[1:19:16] won't do us any good until
[1:19:19] it becomes manifested in her life
[1:19:23] in order to do that jesus said a seed
[1:19:25] must die and fall into the ground
[1:19:27] rot out in order for it to come forth
[1:19:30] and bring forth the fruit
[1:19:32] now brother branson says good you're
[1:19:34] understanding the message that's
[1:19:36] great we're hearing the message you know
[1:19:39] intellectually we're hearing it
[1:19:41] and we're seeing the signs and it's
[1:19:43] proven it's the bible
[1:19:45] but oh how the church needs to lie in
[1:19:48] the presence
[1:19:49] till it tenders up you know
[1:19:52] and gets sweet in the spirit that's
[1:19:54] what's missing
[1:19:57] well brother john i don't think i should
[1:19:59] have to do that i think
[1:20:01] you should have to do that
[1:20:04] you ever meet one of those people they
[1:20:05] got a higher standard for
[1:20:09] then they're willing to live
[1:20:13] i love this because this is not for
[1:20:15] everybody brother branham's talking to
[1:20:17] the bride here
[1:20:21] he goes on to continue to say later in
[1:20:23] that message now church
[1:20:25] we're teaching now but remember when you
[1:20:28] leave here
[1:20:30] start moving out of the shock now
[1:20:34] you're going into the grain he says but
[1:20:37] lie in the presence of the sun
[1:20:40] don't add to what i've said don't take
[1:20:43] away
[1:20:44] what i've said because i speak the truth
[1:20:46] as far as i know it as the father has
[1:20:48] given it to me
[1:20:49] don't add to it just say what i've said
[1:20:52] amen the thing of it is
[1:20:56] just tell people to come seek the lord
[1:21:00] jesus
[1:21:03] and then you yourself
[1:21:06] lie right in his presence
[1:21:09] just make love to him
[1:21:13] say oh lord jesus son of god i love you
[1:21:17] tender my heart lord take away all the
[1:21:21] filth
[1:21:22] and the love of the world amen and let
[1:21:25] me live
[1:21:25] holy in this present world before you
[1:21:32] so simple we don't need theologians
[1:21:37] we don't need he's pointing us
[1:21:40] to lay in his presence and he's actually
[1:21:42] showing us
[1:21:43] how to do it
[1:21:46] it's simple you stay there
[1:21:50] until you're ripened until
[1:21:53] that embarrassment leads until that
[1:21:55] shame
[1:21:56] leaves until you get deity inside of you
[1:22:00] it can't come any other way
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:08] this is the last quote it was the third
[1:22:11] from his last message he ever preached
[1:22:13] modern events
[1:22:14] are made clear by prophecy brother
[1:22:16] branham says we're at the end
[1:22:18] of denominations the wheat's taken shape
[1:22:22] but what's the matter with the wheat now
[1:22:25] you can't it must lay in the presence of
[1:22:28] the sun to ripen
[1:22:30] before the combine picks it up
[1:22:35] so come to church get more knowledge
[1:22:37] read more books listen to more tapes
[1:22:40] go to more churches live stream more it
[1:22:43] does not matter
[1:22:46] what is needed is to get
[1:22:49] in the presence of the sun so you can
[1:22:51] get ripened for the combine
[1:22:53] that's it
[1:22:57] i believe we have enough word
[1:23:01] to make a rapture if we never heard
[1:23:03] another word
[1:23:06] but what is wrong with what is wrong
[1:23:08] with us when we cannot
[1:23:10] put emphasis on the word that we've
[1:23:13] already heard
[1:23:16] like somehow we think it's just gonna
[1:23:18] magically come we've got
[1:23:20] a hunger to see it living in us
[1:23:24] everything brother branham has given us
[1:23:26] the the the antidote here
[1:23:29] it'll help us in our battles our
[1:23:30] spiritual battles in our mind
[1:23:32] the battles that we have with somebody
[1:23:36] the thing that seems to be
[1:23:40] so small of a thing laying in the
[1:23:42] presence of the son oh yeah i have heard
[1:23:43] about that quote before
[1:23:47] it needs to become a more of a major
[1:23:50] a major push for us
[1:23:53] you know saints we're not really
[1:23:55] fighting against one another
[1:23:59] we are fighting against the devil who's
[1:24:02] trying to keep us
[1:24:03] down so we need this
[1:24:07] so we can overcome the devil and his
[1:24:10] devices
[1:24:12] i just i want you to commit with me
[1:24:16] to seek the lord and to spend some time
[1:24:19] ripening
[1:24:20] amen amen you ever just
[1:24:24] get down on your knees and you're
[1:24:25] praying and you're just like
[1:24:28] you're not interested in it you're not
[1:24:30] feeling like it you wish it was
[1:24:32] you can't wait to the prayer time's over
[1:24:34] and you got things you want to do that

[1:24:49] at that moment
[1:24:50] and you don't want to you just want to
[1:24:54] get through this

[1:25:05] god in your prayer closet
[1:25:06] he said i will reward you openly
[1:25:12] so let's spend some more time getting
[1:25:14] into the presence of the sun
[1:25:16] i want to ripen into his image when you
[1:25:18] get done all praying and you feel like
