[33:34] amen if you have your Bibles this
[33:35] morning we're going to look into the
[33:36] book of Nehemiah the 4th chapter and
[33:39] while you're turning there just briefly
[33:41] just appreciate everybody as as brother
[33:42] John said we just got back from Honduras
[33:45] and I believe brother Johnson's been
[33:46] there in different ones before brother
[33:48] John has support him so they're they're
[33:50] doing well um things are moving on the
[33:53] Lord is blessed uh we had a youth camp
[33:55] there and we had uh several several
[33:57] probably a few dozen young people come
[33:59] to the Lord receive the Holy Ghost
[34:00] different things like that so just an
[34:02] exciting time it's a beautiful country
[34:05] and uh particularly this time of year
[34:07] where it's 80 degrees there as opposed
[34:09] to whatever it is here it was quite a
[34:13] change to come back you know usually I'm
[34:14] pretty all about you I want to get home
[34:16] and stuff but they have good burgers
[34:18] there they have really good beef there
[34:20] and it was warm and I'm like maybe I
[34:21] should just make the family come to me
[34:24] but we're back so we're happy to be with
[34:25] you actually we're just happy to be here
[34:27] so I do like the cold weather I like it
[34:30] a little less as I get older I don't
[34:33] like it quite as cold as I used to like
[34:34] it so but anyway you didn't come here to
[34:37] hear me ramble like I'm some old man I
[34:38] just I'm only 40 but uh appreciate
[34:42] everybody's prayers and and it's
[34:44] encouraging to see that God is
[34:46] fulfilling his word he said I'll have a
[34:48] bride out of every Kindred and tongue
[34:51] and Nation so continue if you pray for
[34:53] them please pray for the people of
[34:54] hondur or continue to pray for them and
[34:56] just so much more could be said but we
[34:58] had a real good time there I got a
[35:00] little sick there but I'm doing well
[35:01] today uh as far as that goes so we're
[35:04] just trust in the Lord with the service
[35:06] day Nehemiah the 4th chapter um so many
[35:08] different things I I want to get to this
[35:10] morning but I don't want to be all day
[35:12] about it but um um we're going to look
[35:14] in the book of Nehemiah here the fourth
[35:16] chapter I love the book of Nehemiah as
[35:18] you may have guessed that's probably why
[35:20] my firstborn son is named Nehemiah yes
[35:23] I'm looking at you so everybody look at
[35:25] him okay so
[35:27] well anyway he's going to get me for
[35:29] that
[35:32] later um no I love the story of Nehemiah
[35:35] if anybody's not familiar Nehemiah
[35:37] during the the time of the Captivity uh
[35:40] the people of course they gone to
[35:41] Babylon and then Babylon was destroyed
[35:43] by the mes and Persians and so Israel's
[35:45] out of their promised land and he gets
[35:48] uh Nehemiah hears that Jerusalem had
[35:51] been laid waste of course Ezra had just
[35:52] gone back and began to work on the
[35:53] Temple and so Nehemiah has this burden
[35:56] he goes before the the Lord and the King
[35:58] speaks to him and gives him permission
[35:59] to go back and rebuild Jerusalem rebuild
[36:01] the walls of Jerusalem and so uh like
[36:04] any great undertaking that God gives a
[36:07] man when Nehemiah goes back and he
[36:09] begins to do this he encounters some
[36:12] opposition and I would say today that if
[36:14] you have lived a life as a Christian at
[36:16] some point you've probably encountered
[36:18] some opposition somewhere if not it
[36:20] might be questionable whether you're on
[36:21] the right track so so we're going to
[36:23] read this here in Nehemiah the 4th
[36:24] chapter this morning and I know you're
[36:26] standing for just a little bit but don't
[36:27] worry as I always remind you I shall
[36:29] remain standing the entire time so you
[36:31] get no sympathy for
[36:33] me neiah chap 4 let's just read in verse
[36:36] 12 together and I'll have you be seated
[36:37] here after we get to verse uh 20 here
[36:40] Nehemiah chap 4:12 and it came to pass
[36:42] that when the Jews which dwelt by them
[36:44] came they said unto us 10 times from all
[36:48] places when she shall return unto us
[36:50] they will be upon us speaking about the
[36:52] enemy coming upon them the adversaries
[36:54] so Nehemiah has got an action plan I
[36:57] like this he's not just uh one of these
[36:59] empty worded politicians he's got a plan
[37:01] he says therefore set I in the lower
[37:03] places behind the wall and on the higher
[37:05] places I even set the people after their
[37:08] families with their swords their Spears
[37:11] and their bows and I looked and Rose up
[37:14] and said unto the Nobles and to the
[37:17] rulers and to the rest of the people be
[37:20] not ye afraid of them remember the Lord
[37:24] which is great and terrible and fight
[37:27] for your brethren your sons and your
[37:30] daughters your wives and your houses and
[37:33] it came to pass when our enemies heard
[37:35] that it was known unto us and God had
[37:38] brought their counsel to not that we
[37:40] returned all of us to the wall everyone
[37:42] into his work and it came to pass from
[37:45] that time forth that the half of my
[37:47] servants wrought in the work and the
[37:50] other half them held both the spears the
[37:52] Shields and the bows and the habens and
[37:55] the rulers were behind all the house of
[37:57] Judah they which build it on the wall
[38:00] and they that bear burdens with those
[38:01] that laid it everyone with one of his
[38:03] hands rought in the work and with the
[38:06] other hand held a weapon this is some
[38:08] real good Second Amendment preaching
[38:10] right here if
[38:11] you're not making it political just
[38:13] saying for the builders everyone had his
[38:15] sword gted by his side and so build it
[38:19] and he that sounded the trumpet was by
[38:21] me and I said unto the Nobles and to the
[38:23] rulers and to the rest of the people the
[38:25] work is great
[38:27] and large and we are separated upon the
[38:30] wall one far from another in what place
[38:34] therefore ye hear the sound of the
[38:36] trumpet Resort ye thither unto us our
[38:40] God shall fight for us amen may the Lord
[38:44] bless the's word you may be seated this
[38:46] morning um I'd like to speak on a
[38:50] thought this morning the hero of a
[38:52] greater world Amen and uh it's
[38:55] interesting I was looking through the
[38:56] pictures I'd taken on this trip and so
[38:58] my my iPad I have these pictures for my
[39:00] missions trip Sav so I there's the story
[39:03] I tell and it's interesting I actually
[39:04] found the picture of it this I stayed at
[39:07] this hotel some years back I was in
[39:09] India and I stayed at a certain hotel
[39:11] and uh there was a brother with me his
[39:13] name was David he was from the church in
[39:14] chenai and he was my uh he was my
[39:16] interpreter so he was taking me about
[39:18] and stuff and so he comes one morning uh
[39:20] to get me from the hotel and he's taking
[39:22] me there's a plazy walk across to get to
[39:24] a restaurant across the way and so we're
[39:26] going through this Courtyard and there's
[39:28] the there's several different busts of
[39:30] famous individuals I guess they're
[39:31] famous or whatever in India I don't know
[39:33] most of them you know it was some
[39:34] British guy that colonized them and some
[39:37] Indian person I think it was mamag
[39:38] Gandhi and different ones stuff and so
[39:40] the reason I bring this up is I'm
[39:42] looking at all these different statues
[39:44] there just a row of different figures of
[39:46] their of their black like busts of these
[39:48] different figures and there's one that
[39:49] stood out in particular to me as an
[39:51] American they had one there of Abraham
[39:53] Lincoln and uh so I thought that was
[39:55] rather pecul you know cuz again you know
[39:58] what do the Indians have to do with
[40:00] Abraham uh Lincoln so um you know I
[40:03] started asking this guy said I'm just
[40:04] curious what's this doing here in the
[40:06] middle of India and he's like oh Abraham
[40:08] Lincoln he was a great man and he was a
[40:10] hero and he's just tell me all the
[40:12] things about the 16th president United
[40:13] States and when he was president and the
[40:15] Gettysburg address and all this stuff
[40:17] and it's fascinating to me because we
[40:19] live in a culture now where uh some
[40:22] people uh protested I guess or they you
[40:24] know whatever the like most most young
[40:26] people probably don't even know who
[40:27] Abraham Lincoln was or what he did but I
[40:29] think of that I think of that color man
[40:31] brother Bram talked about where he saw
[40:33] the Garment where Lincoln's blood was
[40:35] and it meant something to him when he
[40:37] looked at that bloodstained garment that
[40:38] this man he died for my freedom amen and
[40:42] so we think about this and so I'm like
[40:44] well what's that have to do with India
[40:45] it has nothing to do with India he says
[40:47] but what it represents to us is that
[40:49] he's a hero to us and I'm thinking I
[40:51] never knew the Indians thought Abraham
[40:53] Lincoln was a hero but here we are and
[40:56] so I think which is really interesting
[40:57] if you think about the fact that he's a
[40:59] Christian man you know and all these
[41:00] other things and they're predominantly
[41:02] Hindu I guess so his his heroism
[41:05] transcends even the religious or
[41:07] cultural boundaries that that we have in
[41:09] our country or that they have in their
[41:11] country amen so I got to thinking about
[41:13] this idea what what makes a man a hero
[41:15] what makes a woman a hero amen because
[41:18] they're founding fathers or whatever I
[41:20] mean you know I don't know how that
[41:21] works but it's it's it's one of our
[41:23] figures amen so uh it's interesting to
[41:25] me because uh you you think about what
[41:28] what makes somebody hero and we we
[41:30] typically think of a man's courage or
[41:31] his bravery you know that a hero's got
[41:33] to be brave and I believe that's
[41:35] certainly a part of it but we see all
[41:37] throughout history there's plenty of
[41:39] people they're Brave they're bold and
[41:41] they're foolish because of it they make
[41:43] all kinds of mistakes amen so a person
[41:46] can be brave and
[41:47] stupid they can be brave and die for the
[41:50] wrong thing amen so it's not just a
[41:52] matter of being brave there's plenty of
[41:54] people who have who because of vain
[41:56] Glory Glory they they're willing to die
[41:57] as fools and so you think about the idea
[42:00] well maybe it's somebody that's talented
[42:01] but there's many people that are
[42:03] talented in the world today Elvis
[42:04] Presley was talented amen but what did
[42:07] he use it for he didn't use it for the
[42:09] glory of God he used it for himself so
[42:11] there's many people that are talented
[42:13] maybe an inventor or whatever it is but
[42:15] they misuse their talents amen and the
[42:18] Bible even talks about people they bury
[42:19] their talent so it's more than just a
[42:21] talented person it's more than just a
[42:23] brave person it's more than just a
[42:25] famous person there's many people in the
[42:27] world today that they're they're famous
[42:29] apparently Abraham Lincoln is famous in
[42:31] in India I had no idea you know I mean
[42:35] so but there's plenty of people that are
[42:36] famous but they're not famous for a good
[42:38] thing amen and so this idea like the
[42:41] Indians especially in the orient and the
[42:43] Eastern culture to them a hero is
[42:46] somebody that changes the order of how
[42:47] things are done they they change the
[42:49] very way that the cosmos functions the
[42:51] the social Paradigm or whatever amen so
[42:54] I say all these things you know to me
[42:56] all these things are important but what
[42:58] makes a hero uh somebody of Distinction
[43:02] is that they have an uncommon virtue or
[43:05] moral fortitude amen they they have a
[43:07] strong moral conviction about something
[43:09] in so much that they endure exceptional
[43:11] Hazard or even give up their life
[43:14] because to them it's the right thing to
[43:15] do amen amen so it's not just something
[43:18] that endures danger but it's something
[43:19] that puts themselves In Harm's Way for
[43:22] someone else to do it amen you know we
[43:25] think about this modern an era of
[43:26] entertainment and you know we've got
[43:28] we've got this uh you know many people
[43:30] they redefine what a hero is amen do we
[43:32] have a hookup here I'm just going oh
[43:34] thank you sir praise the Lord you know
[43:37] you look at the idea of a hero we have
[43:39] superheroes nowadays and superheroes are
[43:42] actually less heroic than normal Heroes
[43:43] they say what do you mean well listen if
[43:45] you're bulletproof and you can fly and
[43:48] you can heat vision stuff and somebody
[43:50] comes up to you and they threaten to
[43:51] shoot somebody and you stand in the way
[43:53] that doesn't make you Brave that just
[43:55] makes you
[43:56] bulletproof amen that it doesn't take
[43:59] any listen if you're invulnerable it
[44:01] doesn't take any courage to put yourself
[44:03] In Harm's Way amen but listen when that
[44:06] gun can kill you just as much as the
[44:08] next person and you put yourself In
[44:10] Harm's Way that shows there's something
[44:12] different about you than everybody else
[44:14] amen Jesus said No Greater Love does a
[44:16] man have that he would lay down his life
[44:19] for his friends and that's what we're
[44:21] talking about today amen somebody that's
[44:23] want to lay themselves on the line where
[44:24] it might even cost their life it might
[44:26] cost them all kinds of things but the
[44:29] cause is so
[44:30] great the need is so great that it's
[44:33] worthwhile for them to do it when maybe
[44:36] nobody else wants to when maybe nobody
[44:38] else is willing when it's not the
[44:40] popular thing to do yet the lay their
[44:42] lives on the line amen and that's what
[44:44] makes it a real inspiration that's what
[44:46] makes it heroic amen because it's not
[44:48] just what they did it but we look at
[44:50] their lives and it inspires us there's
[44:52] something we say listen I want to be
[44:54] somebody like that amen and and here's
[44:56] the thing anybody can look at a hero and
[44:58] say I want to be like that but it's a
[44:59] different thing to be that in the midst
[45:01] of adversity amen anybody with any sort
[45:04] of sound mind would say oh yeah I wish I
[45:06] could do those things but what happens
[45:09] when the trouble actually comes that's
[45:12] what shows what kind of character we
[45:14] have amen so it what it represents to us
[45:18] is what makes it heroic it inspires us
[45:20] say man you take our country's flag the
[45:22] flag in this country well it used to
[45:24] mean something to some people it still
[45:25] does to some people and not so much to
[45:27] other people amen is that all right
[45:30] listen this this we think about the song
[45:32] The Star Spangled Banner when they saw
[45:34] that flag wave and it meant something to
[45:36] them in that battle amen we think about
[45:38] six Marines climbing up uima and raising
[45:41] the flag if we think about these things
[45:43] amen listen the flag it represents
[45:46] something that's what makes it
[45:48] significant amen and so there's this
[45:50] story I thought of because I talking
[45:51] about Abraham Lincoln I thought about
[45:52] this story during the Civil War I
[45:53] learned it when I was a kid and all
[45:55] these years later by the grace of God I
[45:56] get to use it and it's really safe cuz
[45:58] I'm here in the north amen I was talking
[46:01] about this one time down south well
[46:03] maybe they don't think he's so heroic
[46:04] here I don't know how that works but but
[46:05] there's a man during the Civil War his
[46:07] name was Thomas plunket has anybody ever
[46:09] heard of Thomas plunet all right man I
[46:11] got some got some backup today praise
[46:14] God so you know the story I might as
[46:15] well just skip on you can tell everybody
[46:16] else about it later no I'll go ahead and
[46:19] tell but Thomas plunket he' fought at
[46:21] the Battle of Gettysburg he was a Union
[46:23] soldier he fought a different few
[46:24] different places and what he famous for
[46:26] is during the Battle of Fredericksburg
[46:28] in Virginia uh he was they were there
[46:30] one day and his unit was under enemy
[46:32] fire and the there was one guy in the he
[46:34] was the standard Bearer he held up the
[46:35] flag that had the Union flag it showed
[46:38] what who they were identified with and
[46:40] so he seen his friends start taking fire
[46:43] and he became known as the hero of four
[46:45] words because he'd always say don't let
[46:46] it fall don't let it fall boys don't let
[46:49] it fall and he would encourage these
[46:50] guys and they start falling one would
[46:52] get shot and die and another one would
[46:54] run up and grab the the standard and
[46:55] they continued doing that till he was
[46:57] the last man that was around the
[46:59] flag and so this guy he goes and he
[47:02] grabs this Banner this endon and uh
[47:05] during the fight he loses both arms I
[47:07] don't even know how he holds it up
[47:08] without an arm I don't know if he's
[47:09] using his stump or what I don't know
[47:10] what the science is behind it but he
[47:12] ends up getting shot up kins explode
[47:14] around him and shrapnel and bullets he
[47:16] loses both arms but he stands and he
[47:20] holds up this flag amen cuz he's not
[47:23] willing to let it fall amen and finally
[47:26] some private shows up and they get
[47:27] reinforcements and they carry it forward
[47:29] for him and listen he went the rest of
[47:31] his life this is this is not 2024 where
[47:34] he can get Prosthetics he's got no arms
[47:36] he's shot up he's a veteran but he was a
[47:39] hero to the Union Army because he
[47:40] wouldn't let it fall no matter how heavy
[47:43] the fire got no matter how bad things
[47:45] seemed he wouldn't let that flag fall
[47:48] now listen that flag is just a piece of
[47:50] cloth like any other piece of cloth amen
[47:53] if brother John took my jacket right now
[47:55] and hung on a stick outside and starts
[47:57] shooting at it sister an gets a gun
[47:58] starts shooting at it say better go get
[48:00] your suit you know what I'm going to do
[48:01] I'm going to go to pennies and I'm going
[48:03] to buy another jacket cuz I'm not going
[48:06] to risk my life for a suit jacket it's
[48:08] just a piece of cloth amen but listen
[48:11] the flag it's just a piece of cloth
[48:13] naturally but that's not what makes it
[48:16] special what makes it special is what it
[48:19] represents the stripes on it represent
[48:21] the blood of soldiers who died for you
[48:24] and I to have Liberty it represents the
[48:28] thousands of men that carried it into
[48:30] battle so you and I today could sit here
[48:32] and have religious freedom and preach
[48:35] this message and have the Liberty to do
[48:37] it and believe the things that we
[48:38] believe amen we are here today because
[48:41] men suffered and died for our Liberty
[48:44] listen this Bible is here today because
[48:46] men like William tendle took their stand
[48:49] and suffered so we could have these
[48:52] things amen we' have entered into other
[48:54] men's labors and when we look at our
[48:56] Bible when we look at a flag we remember
[48:59] what it means to
[49:02] us that's what makes it
[49:04] special amen the jacket's not special
[49:08] the the the flag the cloth the material
[49:10] is not special it's what it represents
[49:12] listen you and I today our humanity is
[49:15] not special the devil today is not
[49:18] afraid of our Humanity it's the one we
[49:21] represent the one we represent is the
[49:24] one he's terrified of
[49:26] amen if you're coming in your own
[49:28] righteousness your own ability and you
[49:30] think you're going to outsmart the enemy
[49:32] if you think you're human ability will
[49:34] help you surmount every trial you're
[49:36] going to falter you're going to fail but
[49:38] if you remember who you're representing
[49:41] today
[49:44] Hallelujah see it represents something
[49:46] brother Ram says this these Warriors
[49:48] they take these young kids out just the
[49:50] cream of the crop because they don't
[49:52] know no better than discipline Army
[49:54] discipline they say stick your head up
[49:55] over the hill let somebody shoot it off
[49:57] die like a hero and they gladly do it
[50:00] yes run up there on one and get shot
[50:03] down the other and shot down and the
[50:05] nation forgets them unless their family
[50:07] well that's about the
[50:09] truth come back this here they come back
[50:11] he says you see what I mean many of the
[50:12] soldiers he but a man seldom will you
[50:15] ever find one that'll lay down his life
[50:18] for the cause of Christ
[50:20] amen he won't even crawl out up his
[50:22] shade tree and go to church won't even
[50:24] get out from behind the television long
[50:26] enough to attend a Wednesday night
[50:26] prayer meeting that's right a shame
[50:28] disgrace he says that's the reason
[50:30] Angels don't visit the churches that's
[50:32] the reason Angels don't visit homes
[50:34] we've got to get down to deep
[50:37] sincerity of this thing
[50:40] amen talking about sincerity brother bam
[50:42] I love the idea you know brother Bram
[50:44] liked the idea of heroism he liked a
[50:46] valent man a man with courage a man with
[50:48] a backbone he liked that sort of thing
[50:50] there's different examples he uses in
[50:51] the message and one of the big ones he
[50:54] uses we all know the story about the
[50:55] mother deer amen amen I was thinking
[50:57] about this that mother deer you know
[50:59] when when when Bert old snake guys out
[51:01] there he's got that call he's going to
[51:03] go shoot these little FS that Mama dear
[51:04] she she thinks her young one is in
[51:06] danger she knows that she's in danger
[51:09] looking for it but because she's a real
[51:11] mom amen and it's amazing to me because
[51:14] this is just a brute Beast brother Ram
[51:15] says I think about a mother possum and a
[51:18] mother deer a real mother amen Nature
[51:20] has that in a real mother and yet we've
[51:22] got a society today which teaches moms
[51:25] not to Value the children not to raise
[51:27] them up for the Lord to even to even
[51:30] murder them in the womb and yet these
[51:32] natural animals come me out somebody I
[51:36] know it's not popular but it's the truth
[51:37] anyway these natural animals have enough
[51:40] mom about them to not do that to their
[51:42] own
[51:43] young and we claim to be civilized and
[51:46] we claim to be ethical and we claim to
[51:48] be enlightened and the deer got more mom
[51:51] and the posum listen I'm not condemning
[51:52] the woman I'm condemning the spirit
[51:54] which tells a mom which tells a young
[51:57] lady it's okay to do that they're
[51:58] deceived by the
[52:01] devil not condemning the person hope you
[52:04] understand that today amen but our

[52:10] children to the fires of M just like

[52:43] them they're animals and then we're
[52:45] surprised when they act like animals I
[52:47] know why they act like animals cuz you
[52:49] told them that's what they are right but
[52:51] if you confess that's a son that's a
[52:54] daughter of God that's my blessing
[52:56] that's my Heritage and you'll speak that
[52:58] over their life and you'll believe that

[53:28] that's not the same thing amen sometimes
[53:29] God's children make mistakes that
[53:31] doesn't make them not God's children it
[53:34] just means they did something wrong
[53:35] that's why there's a blood that's why
[53:37] there's forgiveness amen listen if my
[53:39] heavenly father can forgive me I ought
[53:40] to be able to forgive my own children

[54:29] guy when he was out there he was not a
[54:31] trained soldier he was a farmer he
[54:34] didn't know William Brandon was going to
[54:36] be speaking about him in the future had
[54:38] nothing to do with why he did it he did
[54:40] it because he believed that his
[54:43] sacrifice would make a way for Liberty
[54:45] and one man's sacrifice one man
[54:49] sacrifice it it made a difference for
[54:51] Switzerland to this
[54:54] day
[54:56] what that he was a trained or a great
[54:57] man it's what he did it's what he was

[55:14] not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in
[55:18] The Strife well he liked it amen amen be
[55:21] a hero in the strife and I got thinking
[55:23] about this listen there's no such thing
[55:24] as a hero in ease or in times of Peace
[55:27] amen there it's it's when extraordinary
[55:30] circumstances arise amen without chaos
[55:33] there's no such a thing as a hero amen
[55:35] they are like a flag or a banner amid
[55:37] the chaos amid the darkness amid
[55:40] adversity they stand out amen so it's
[55:43] not so much that strife and this this is
[55:45] how I feel about it it's not that Strife
[55:47] makes people's here makes people into
[55:49] Heroes it just reveals what was in them
[55:50] the whole time amen right listen if you
[55:53] don't have that character in you now you
[55:55] don't suddenly get it in the midst of
[55:57] adversity it amazes me people are like
[55:59] well listen if this happened to me you
[56:00] know I used the Second Amendment here a
[56:02] minute ago so I just use that you know
[56:03] anytime Congress passes one of these
[56:05] bills and they're going to take your
[56:07] guns or this that you know all the
[56:08] keyboard Warriors show up and they're
[56:10] going to stop it they're going to go to
[56:11] my front yard and you got you know
[56:13] they're going to have to pry them out of
[56:14] my cold dead hands you'd be the first
[56:16] people to give up right anybody can talk
[56:20] listen if if social media and the
[56:22] internet has taught us one thing anybody
[56:25] can say anything and 99% of the time
[56:29] they're not going to deliver amen but
[56:32] listen if you have the right character
[56:34] in you what that character is revealed
[56:37] in adversity it's revealed in Trials
[56:39] amen you don't get it there you had it
[56:41] in the first place and God allows
[56:46] Hallelujah why am I going through this
[56:48] why is God allow me to be in this
[56:49] situation to reveal something about you
[56:51] that nobody knew about you cuz God knows
[56:53] things about you you don't know about
[56:54] about you God sees things about your
[56:56] life that you don't see I don't see my
[56:58] listen Gideon didn't see himself as a
[57:01] mighty man of Valor that's why God sent
[57:03] a bunch of midianites his way why they
[57:06] coming here to show that Gideon is a
[57:08] mighty man of Valor the sword of the
[57:10] Lord and the sword of Gideon will defeat
[57:12] this Army though they be like
[57:16] grasshoppers very good why would God put
[57:20] me in the most desperately wicked evil
[57:22] deceiving age proof for you you are
[57:25] that's right listen he didn't do it to
[57:28] destroy you he did it to to show you off
[57:33] amen he did to exhibit the character of
[57:36] Christ in your life amen it's not for
[57:39] your harm it's for your good it's for
[57:41] his
[57:43] glory amen because anybody can talk oh
[57:46] yeah we listen you go to any nomenal you
[57:49] go to any nominal Evangelical Church
[57:51] what's the first thing in their
[57:52] statement of for faith we believe the
[57:55] Bible to be the inspired word of God
[57:58] It's the final Authority in all things
[58:00] to the church and then literally
[58:02] everything else is contrary to the Bible
[58:04] we believe in three gods and we believe
[58:05] in baptism and the titles that's just
[58:07] anybody can say oh yeah we believe in
[58:09] the Bible everybody that goes to church
[58:11] well not everybody most people that go
[58:14] to church oh yeah we believe the Bible
[58:16] but who's actually going to live it
[58:18] that's the difference God's not
[58:20] interested how well we argue it he's
[58:22] interested how well we live it in the
[58:25] midst of adversity listen it's easy to
[58:27] live a Christian Life in this church in
[58:29] front of everybody but when you go home
[58:31] when you get sick when you're at work
[58:34] when you encounter adversity what kind
[58:36] of Life do you live
[58:38] then that shows your
[58:43] character the Bible says if you faint in
[58:45] the day of
[58:46] adversity thy strength is small amen
[58:50] listen I used to work at a
[58:52] factory years ago and I had this job I'm
[58:55] chucking these aluminum rims on this
[58:56] conveyor for 12 hours some were 20 PBS

[59:22] first day on the job they're like yeah

[59:30] you pay money to lift weights and now
[59:33] you got a
[59:34] job and it's too hard cuz you don't you

[59:45] some guy next to me 55y old little Irish
[59:48] guy 5 foot5 little belly like this man
[59:51] he could out work all of
[59:53] them you're strength is not measured by
[59:56] how strong you are when everything's
[59:57] going well your strength is measured by
[1:00:00] what you've got when adversity comes the
[1:00:03] first time of trouble comes if the the
[1:00:05] big muscles don't do you no good then
[1:00:08] they're not worth
[1:00:10] nothing it might win you a competition
[1:00:12] or photo shoot but they won't overcome
[1:00:16] adversity I don't get any ideas now I'm
[1:00:19] not handing out autographs today I know
[1:00:20] you're all looking at this guy
[1:00:23] but I'm not I know you're not it's okay
[1:00:26] doesn't take much to discern it you're
[1:00:27] all laugh and I got
[1:00:28] it amen I love this be not dumb driven
[1:00:33] cattle he says don't be dumb driven
[1:00:35] cattle in other words most
[1:00:37] people when Trouble Comes their
[1:00:39] circumstances dictate their response yes
[1:00:42] they're driven like cattle and most
[1:00:44] people live in fear they're they're
[1:00:45] controlled by media they're controlled
[1:00:47] by fear they're controlled by narratives
[1:00:48] they're controlled by agendas they're
[1:00:50] driven all the time but listen we're not
[1:00:53] cattle that's right we're sheep you
[1:00:55] don't drive sheep you lead Sheep amen
[1:00:58] when Jesus come to Jerusalem he said I
[1:01:00] that he wanted to gather them amen he
[1:01:02] was moved with compassion because they
[1:01:05] were like sheep not having a Shepherd
[1:01:09] can I say it this way there's a group of
[1:01:10] people I believe there's a group of
[1:01:12] people on the Earth today still they're
[1:01:14] not looking to be driven about with the
[1:01:16] circumstances of this life but they're
[1:01:18] looking for the leadership of God
[1:01:20] they're looking for the moving of the
[1:01:21] Holy Ghost that's what they want to
[1:01:23] influence their decision that's what
[1:01:25] makes them act out amen amen we're not
[1:01:28] pushed along with the tides of fate and
[1:01:30] the tides of popular opinion and
[1:01:32] politics we're moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:01:35] we believe this Bible despite
[1:01:38] circumstances despite obstacles we've
[1:01:41] taken our
[1:01:43] stand
[1:01:46] amen hallelujah the Bible says this
[1:01:49] speaking of Jesus Isaiah chapter 11 in
[1:01:52] that day there should be a root of Jesse
[1:01:54] which shall stand for an end sin to the
[1:01:56] people what's an end sin it's a ban you
[1:01:58] lift it up and mean you lift it up and
[1:02:00] it gives them a direction Amen to it the
[1:02:03] Gentiles seek and his rest shall be
[1:02:06] glorious Paul quotes it in Romans 15
[1:02:08] there shall be a root of jessing and he
[1:02:10] that shall rise to Reign Over the
[1:02:12] Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles trust
[1:02:16] amen again Psalm 60 the Bible says in
[1:02:19] verse four thou has given a banner to
[1:02:20] them that fear thee that it may be
[1:02:23] displayed because of thy truth so listen
[1:02:26] you've got a banner today amen you've
[1:02:29] got something to display the banner does
[1:02:31] you no good if you stick it under your
[1:02:35] bed let me ask somebody the banner does
[1:02:38] you no good as a soldier if you leave it
[1:02:41] in the
[1:02:41] barracks listen this Bible does you no
[1:02:44] good if you leave it on the page amen
[1:02:47] it's no good if you just stick it under
[1:02:49] your table or on top of the table when
[1:02:51] you're done and you just leave it there
[1:02:52] amen a banner to work an inant or a
[1:02:55] standard to work it has to be on
[1:02:58] display it does not function otherwise
[1:03:01] amen listen our lord Jesus he led
[1:03:04] captivity captive he's a great Captain
[1:03:07] Amen in him shall the Gentiles trust the
[1:03:09] Bible says if I be lifted
[1:03:12] up I will draw all men to me see we must
[1:03:17] lift up Jesus we can't lift up our idea
[1:03:20] or our church Identity or our argument
[1:03:22] and our fuss and our fighting we must
[1:03:24] lift up Jesus Christ that's the only
[1:03:27] listen you might draw a lot of people
[1:03:30] you might get a big crowd preaching
[1:03:31] other things but if you want to draw
[1:03:33] that rainbow trout if you want to draw
[1:03:36] the elect amen the ones that are not
[1:03:38] driven like cattle if you're looking to
[1:03:40] get the real sheep of God you must lift
[1:03:42] up the word you must lift up Jesus
[1:03:45] Christ that's the only thing that will
[1:03:48] draw
[1:03:49] them amen amen so for a Bandon to work
[1:03:53] it has to be it it it has to identify
[1:03:56] where you are it has to be visible it
[1:03:59] has to be lifted up amen the Bible calls
[1:04:03] God one of his Redemptive name Jehovah
[1:04:04] nii the Lord is our Banner amen or our
[1:04:09] refuge amen it's in the book of Exodus
[1:04:12] the 17th chapter you don't have to turn
[1:04:13] there but you're probably all familiar
[1:04:15] with the story the people of Israel they
[1:04:16] they're heading towards the promised
[1:04:17] land and I believe they run into the
[1:04:19] amalekites and so Moses sends Joshua
[1:04:22] down there to make war on him and and
[1:04:24] it's a curious story because you know
[1:04:26] he's down there fighting with him and
[1:04:27] stuff Joshua's down there fighting the
[1:04:29] enemy and Moses he stands up on this
[1:04:31] mountain side and he lifts up his hands
[1:04:32] over the people and as long as he's
[1:04:34] lifting up his hands over the people
[1:04:37] they had Victory but you know this guy's
[1:04:39] getting a little
[1:04:40] older this guy's not like the guy that
[1:04:42] come to the factory he's like me his
[1:04:44] arms get tired pretty quick and Moses
[1:04:46] after a while his arms start to get a
[1:04:47] little heavy and they come down and
[1:04:50] Aaron and her notice when his arms go
[1:04:52] down they start losing the battle so
[1:04:54] they get This brilliant idea let's set
[1:04:56] him down we ain't got a we don't have an
[1:04:58] easy boy but we got a rock we'll set him
[1:05:00] on this rock and we'll hold his arms up
[1:05:02] for him
[1:05:03] amen well praise the Lord that's the
[1:05:05] thing to do amen when you see somebody
[1:05:07] getting tired you see somebody getting
[1:05:09] worn out don't push him down lift him up
[1:05:12] you see your pastor man he looks tired
[1:05:14] this week well don't tell him he's tired
[1:05:16] he knows he's tired he don't even remind
[1:05:19] it he knows how much he worked this week
[1:05:20] lift him up in prayer say brother we're
[1:05:23] praying for you we're getting behind you
[1:05:25] amen we know if we can all stand behind
[1:05:27] what the Lord wants to do there's
[1:05:29] victory in that amen listen as long as
[1:05:31] he held those arms up and there they
[1:05:34] call him Jehovah ni the Lord is my
[1:05:37] banner see as long as you hold the Lord
[1:05:40] up there's Victory there
[1:05:42] amen you said well listen I'm not know
[1:05:45] this and I'm not that listen you don't
[1:05:47] have to be some super soldier or some
[1:05:49] superhero you have a banner the banner
[1:05:53] is what special brother bam says
[1:05:56] this he says notice it takes the weakest
[1:06:00] the rejected you say well that's me well
[1:06:02] praise God this quotes for you then
[1:06:04] practically every hero God ever had on
[1:06:08] the front lines was that type of person
[1:06:10] ah see you didn't disqualify yourselves
[1:06:12] you just signed up listen I'm too weak
[1:06:15] I'm not good hey you're the one he's
[1:06:16] going to use sorry sorry not
[1:06:21] sorry a person that was rejected
[1:06:25] Ed anybody here maybe you don't have I
[1:06:28] don't need to show hands you know who
[1:06:29] you
[1:06:29] are a person that was
[1:06:32] rejected a person that thought he was
[1:06:36] insufficient a person that had no
[1:06:38] ability at all well glory to God now
[1:06:41] he's talking to me too that person is
[1:06:44] just in good shape so God can start
[1:06:46] using him that's right when they feel
[1:06:49] like they can't they haven't got nothing
[1:06:52] that's when God can take a hold of them
[1:06:54] and do something with them but when
[1:06:56] we're thinking we're able to do it then
[1:06:58] God can't use us because we're wanting
[1:07:00] to do it
[1:07:01] ourselves so the other side we get these
[1:07:03] feelings we think that we are
[1:07:05] insufficient we don't want to do it but
[1:07:07] if we'll just listen to the call of God
[1:07:11] Amen what I want to encourage you with
[1:07:12] this morning if we just listen to the
[1:07:15] call of God that's the very thing that
[1:07:17] God wants to get us into that kind of
[1:07:20] shape so he can amen well listen I've
[1:07:24] had more trials I've had more problems
[1:07:26] last listen I am less confident in
[1:07:28] myself than I've ever been brother
[1:07:30] good I've got good news for you you're
[1:07:33] in good condition listen when you have
[1:07:35] nowhere to turn but God you're in a good
[1:07:37] spot cuz now you have to depend on God
[1:07:40] and so yourself like you've done for
[1:07:41] years of your life that's what most of
[1:07:43] us do well I'm going to depend on them
[1:07:44] 80% of the time that's not good enough
[1:07:46] amen listen 80% not you have to hold him
[1:07:49] up
[1:07:51] always amen
[1:07:55] we take Nehemiah I'm going to bring it
[1:07:56] back to Nehemiah and I think why' we
[1:07:58] even read about him this is
[1:08:00] why Nehemiah is a seemingly
[1:08:03] inconspicuous person he's not a king or
[1:08:06] a prince of the tribe of Judah or this
[1:08:08] or that he's a nobody to his Brethren
[1:08:13] well he had a pretty good job he's the
[1:08:14] king's cup bear it's pretty good till
[1:08:15] the king gets poisoned I
[1:08:17] guess other than that it's pretty good I
[1:08:20] mean he's trusted the king trust him you
[1:08:22] know but Nehemiah is not some stand out
[1:08:25] you know there wasn't a bunch of
[1:08:26] magazines he's the first draft pick and
[1:08:28] he's this and all nehemiah's going to
[1:08:30] change the scene he's nobody to
[1:08:34] nobody and he's just sitting there one
[1:08:36] day and his brother writes to him listen
[1:08:39] Jerusalem lies waste the people got
[1:08:41] nowhere to live but you know what there
[1:08:43] was something about Nehemiah I love it
[1:08:45] because he he feels this burden for the
[1:08:47] people he feels this need he does what
[1:08:49] any of us should have done in that
[1:08:50] situation he begins to pray amen
[1:08:54] Beautiful Lord I I can't leave it like
[1:08:57] this yeah I know the Situation's bad but
[1:09:01] Lord I I can't leave Lord there's got to
[1:09:03] be something that can be done Lord
[1:09:05] there's got to be someone there was
[1:09:08] someone he was he was volunteering
[1:09:10] himself at the very time didn't realize
[1:09:12] it
[1:09:14] amen this man Nehemiah we find out and
[1:09:17] you can go back and read through the
[1:09:18] whole book he's he's a remarkable man
[1:09:21] he's got Vision he's got ambition I he's
[1:09:25] pragmatic and methodical yet he's a man
[1:09:27] of great faith and hope in God and one
[1:09:29] of the things he was really good is he
[1:09:30] knew how to Rally the people to Hope in
[1:09:33] the midst of adversity yes amen I love
[1:09:36] it because like I said he he's not some
[1:09:38] great general or Veterans of battles or
[1:09:40] all these things but there's just
[1:09:41] something God gave him favor with the
[1:09:43] people when the enemy begins to come in
[1:09:46] like a flood then they're all saying
[1:09:48] listen there's no way we will not allow
[1:09:50] this city to be built we will not allow
[1:09:51] God to do this thing we will come out
[1:09:53] against against you 10 different ways
[1:09:55] it's not going to happen the people
[1:09:57] became
[1:09:59] afraid but it only takes one Arnold Von
[1:10:02] Winkle re amen only takes one Mama dear
[1:10:06] Hallelujah to change the situation amen
[1:10:09] it just takes one genuine person it just
[1:10:11] takes one person that cares
[1:10:13] enough I think one of the biggest things
[1:10:16] I know I preached about this a little
[1:10:17] bit last time I'm going to preach it
[1:10:18] again I think one of the biggest things
[1:10:19] that hinders us we just don't care
[1:10:21] enough we get indifferent because we
[1:10:23] lived in a different age and the love of
[1:10:25] man is wax cold because iniquity abounds
[1:10:28] and we see stuff going on says well
[1:10:29] that's just how it's going to be it
[1:10:31] doesn't always have to be that way
[1:10:34] listen I can't change the world then you
[1:10:36] can change it for one person you can
[1:10:38] make a
[1:10:40] difference amen how how much do we care
[1:10:43] about the
[1:10:44] situation and this one man Nehemiah
[1:10:47] listen they went through that City they
[1:10:49] saw the same thing he saw they saw the
[1:10:52] rubble they saw saw the destruction they
[1:10:55] heard the threats of the enemy and
[1:10:56] they're all afraid and they all want to
[1:10:58] give up but Nehemiah saw something
[1:11:00] different am amen listen he seen the
[1:11:04] same debris the same problems hearing
[1:11:06] the same threats but he prayed and he
[1:11:08] got before God and he said listen God
[1:11:10] gave me favor with the King God brought
[1:11:13] me you didn't call me here God brought
[1:11:16] me here some of you come here this
[1:11:18] morning because you were supposed to
[1:11:19] come here but some of you recognize
[1:11:21] today God called you to be in this place
[1:11:24] this morning because you were born for
[1:11:27] such a time as this you were called for
[1:11:29] such a time as this amen and you might
[1:11:32] recognize he was not there by accident
[1:11:36] he was there as part of the plan of God
[1:11:38] and he begin to remind the people he
[1:11:41] held up the testimony of what God had
[1:11:43] done in his life he says don't you be
[1:11:46] afraid of them remember the Lord amen
[1:11:51] that's what happens when we get in
[1:11:52] trials and we get concerned cuz we
[1:11:54] remember this thing and we remember the
[1:11:56] doctor's report and we remember what
[1:11:57] happened to this person and he says
[1:11:59] listen don't remember what the enemy
[1:12:01] said don't remember the negative
[1:12:03] circumstances remember the
[1:12:06] Lord you're remembering all the wrong
[1:12:08] things and forgetting the right thing

[1:12:21] witness remember the hard which is great

[1:12:28] for your brethren you fight for your
[1:12:30] sons you fight for your daughters you

[1:12:36] fall at the first sign of trouble oh the
[1:12:38] devil's coming my way well he better
[1:12:40] strap himself in cuz he's got the fight
[1:12:43] of his life on his hands amen if he
[1:12:46] wants to listen if he wants to come to
[1:12:47] Spencer Drive in vanw Ohio there's a
[1:12:49] bunch of other houses he'd rather go to
[1:12:50] First amen he's going about he's like a
[1:12:54] roaring lion he's seeking whom he can
[1:12:56] devour cuz he can't get everybody
[1:12:59] there's somebody next to the shepherd
[1:13:01] there's somebody they're ready for
[1:13:03] battle there's somebody they've got
[1:13:05] their sword

[1:13:24] ready if he comes out you remember the
[1:13:26] Lord and you
[1:13:28] fight
[1:13:29] Hallelujah listen I see it all the time
[1:13:31] in churches we spend so much time
[1:13:33] fighting with each other when we should
[1:13:35] be fighting for each
[1:13:37] other maybe if we just start fighting
[1:13:39] for each other for once instead of
[1:13:40] fighting with each other we'd get
[1:13:42] somewhere listen that's what the enemy
[1:13:44] wanted to do he sent all these letters
[1:13:45] try to get him a fight with each other
[1:13:46] but Nehemiah said no you stand together
[1:13:48] and you fight for the Lord you remember
[1:13:50] who you're fighting for you're not just
[1:13:52] in the fight for yourself
[1:13:54] listen if you're sitting here today in
[1:13:56] this church you are not here for
[1:13:58] yourself only people are looking at your
[1:14:01] testimony people are dependent on you
[1:14:04] what's your next move what's your stand
[1:14:05] look like and what you hold up in your
[1:14:09] trials what you hold up in adversity is
[1:14:12] what they're going to
[1:14:13] see do you fold and run away like
[1:14:16] everybody else or do you stand there and
[1:14:18] say if I've got to I will die this day
[1:14:22] for the kingdom of God
[1:14:24] but the people will know if I die
[1:14:26] there's at least one
[1:14:27] person there's still a witness on the
[1:14:30] earth God Still's got
[1:14:35] one brother B said a token it's not of
[1:14:39] effective unless it's on
[1:14:43] display
[1:14:47] amen one of the things I
[1:14:50] see I don't want to go too far with this
[1:14:52] I guess but I'm here we're here now amen
[1:14:54] sometimes people they they wander away
[1:14:56] from the truth they wander away from the
[1:14:58] faith the family will fight them tooth
[1:15:00] and nail and I'm thinking if you fight
[1:15:02] for them as hard as you fought with them
[1:15:04] they'd have a place to come back
[1:15:09] to I'm not supposed to be the one
[1:15:11] keeping people out I'm trying to get
[1:15:14] them into the kingdom listen they've got
[1:15:16] enough obstacles trying to keep them out

[1:15:20] he told me he wants his house full
[1:15:25] amen I don't care if they're the most
[1:15:27] backslid Heathen devil Pagan in the
[1:15:29] world if God's going to give them a shot
[1:15:31] then I want to help them I will fight
[1:15:33] for them I'll lay my life I've got to
[1:15:36] I'll be any sort of unpopular I'll be
[1:15:38] called any kind of a
[1:15:41] name cuz that one soul is worth 10,000
[1:15:44] worlds to
[1:15:48] God I listen I get it sometimes those
[1:15:50] are the hardest ones to fight
[1:15:52] for

[1:15:57] ungrateful well that's what Jesus did

[1:25:57] you know she uh they had uh they they'd
[1:26:01] broken her water they had induced my
[1:26:03] wife and the doctor I don't know he must
[1:26:05] have been one of the lower graduates of
[1:26:07] medical school he just kind of left my
[1:26:10] wife unattended and stuff and and he
[1:26:12] come back I think the nurse was the
[1:26:14] nurse checked on you and noticed that
[1:26:15] the baby was breached in other words the
[1:26:17] the uh the court had prolapsed is what
[1:26:19] it was the court had prolapsed in other
[1:26:20] words Janna's head had pinched off the
[1:26:22] umbilic according she' been without
[1:26:24] auction for for minutes and I'm in
[1:26:25] another room they told me to go out and
[1:26:26] wait while they're doing something and
[1:26:28] so I go back to the room and they will
[1:26:29] my wife out on this stretcher or on the
[1:26:33] bed or whatever I'm like I have no idea
[1:26:35] what's going on and here she had been
[1:26:37] without oxygen for 13 minutes already so
[1:26:40] they were taking to do an emergency
[1:26:41] csection so the nurse comes
[1:26:43] in and the nurse begins to tell me well
[1:26:45] listen your child already went without
[1:26:47] oxygen for 13 minutes after 15 minutes
[1:26:49] brain damage sets in so she's giving me
[1:26:51] this bad Di diagnosis and I just kind of
[1:26:54] okay well you know I didn't say anything
[1:26:56] at first and so she you know how it is
[1:27:01] well this guy must not be listening to
[1:27:02] me because he's not weeping in this and
[1:27:04] if you did that's fine but I'm just she
[1:27:06] so she decides to repeat it again she
[1:27:07] like sir I don't know if you heard me
[1:27:09] but uh you should probably be prepared
[1:27:10] your daughter's going to have brain
[1:27:11] damage and I looked right at that nurse
[1:27:12] and said well listen I'd have reason to
[1:27:14] worry if I weren't a Christian amen well
[1:27:17] you know what she didn't say anything
[1:27:19] else that was
[1:27:20] nice that ended discussion amen and as
[1:27:23] you can see my daughter's here today the
[1:27:24] Lord has preserved her and I'm saying
[1:27:26] this for a reason it's so easy when we
[1:27:29] get a negative report oh man that's so
[1:27:30] bad but you know what I did I said I'm
[1:27:32] going to lift up the Lord I'd have a
[1:27:34] reason to worry if I weren't a Christian
[1:27:36] because listen I'm a Christian and no
[1:27:38] matter what happens God is faithful but
[1:27:41] I'm just silly enough I'm just I'm just
[1:27:44] crazy enough to believe that despite
[1:27:47] your report despite Medical Science
[1:27:49] God's going to deliver her safely and
[1:27:51] she's here today amen amen and man I
[1:27:53] didn't have to yell at the nurse I
[1:27:54] didn't have to rebuke nothing I lifted
[1:27:56] up the
[1:27:57] Lord my God is more than
[1:28:01] able listen I listen I can't take credit
[1:28:04] for it it's him I lifted up it's not me
[1:28:07] I didn't do anything that none of you
[1:28:09] could do you're all capable of doing the
[1:28:11] same thing that's not for my glory I'm
[1:28:14] not the one that gets it it's the one
[1:28:15] you lift up I lifted him up and he
[1:28:18] showed
[1:28:20] up Hall
[1:28:23] praise the Lord listen I just I believe
[1:28:25] that about the message I believe that
[1:28:27] this message is this that great amen I
[1:28:30] believe you don't have to try to fix it
[1:28:31] or polish it up or make it look special
[1:28:33] or whatever it's already special because
[1:28:35] it's Jesus
[1:28:37] Christ that's like the story I talked
[1:28:39] about went the first time I went
[1:28:40] overseas to Uganda these this brother he
[1:28:42] he left the Pentecostal church had a
[1:28:44] church of 900 people and he left this
[1:28:46] cuz he heard the message he believed it
[1:28:48] and he was a bishop and everything else
[1:28:50] left the Pentecostal Church lost two
[1:28:51] two-thirds of his church and you know
[1:28:53] brother talks about a brush Harbor
[1:28:54] they're meeting under a brush Harbor
[1:28:56] they've got straw and sticks that's what
[1:28:58] they got they got a generator and one
[1:29:00] light bulb and let me tell you when
[1:29:02] you're preaching at night and I'm not
[1:29:03] trying to sound racist now but when
[1:29:04] you're preaching at night there in the
[1:29:06] African jungle it's hard to see people
[1:29:08] with one light bulb amen praise the Lord
[1:29:11] I'm just like where are they at I got a
[1:29:12] microphone and one light bulb and I'm
[1:29:14] preaching to these people they they said
[1:29:16] will you go preach for this brother I
[1:29:17] said i' love to stand with somebody that
[1:29:19] stands with the message cuz listen it
[1:29:21] would have been easy for him to follow
[1:29:22] the message when he had no following but
[1:29:24] he knew it would cost him it cost him
[1:29:27] 600 people it cost him a salary it cost
[1:29:30] him standing but he want to stand with
[1:29:32] the message because he believes it's
[1:29:35] true I want to stand with somebody like
[1:29:38] that amen listen if I feel that way
[1:29:40] about it how much more does God feel
[1:29:42] that way about it if you stand for him
[1:29:45] he will stand for
[1:29:48] you that's Jehovah ni amen let's stand
[1:29:51] for I went I preach and it's funny cuz
[1:29:53] these six Pentecostal ministers they
[1:29:55] show up they're walking through there in
[1:29:57] the mud it's like night time out they
[1:29:58] come up there and they're they're
[1:30:00] they're coming to see what happened to
[1:30:01] their their previous
[1:30:02] associate and they're laughing and
[1:30:04] making fun they see that he doesn't even
[1:30:06] have a church building and stuff and
[1:30:07] they're laughing at this Rabel and this
[1:30:09] message and stuff and uh so we begin to
[1:30:11] have the service and I begin to preach
[1:30:13] and it's funny because I remember just
[1:30:14] like I'm talking you now there was a
[1:30:16] woman she was laying here on a like a a
[1:30:19] like a bed or something and I just
[1:30:21] thought she was tired because you know
[1:30:23] they were supposed to start service at
[1:30:24] 3:00 and didn't start till 6:00 cuz
[1:30:26] that's how African time works at it's
[1:30:28] where I've gone and so we get
[1:30:30] done and uh they said we want you to
[1:30:34] pray for this woman up here I said oh I
[1:30:36] don't I'm sorry I didn't realize she had
[1:30:37] something wrong what's wrong with her so
[1:30:39] she's paralyzed on the whole right side
[1:30:40] of her body so I went with The
[1:30:42] Interpreter and I began to pray for her
[1:30:44] and I looked at The Interpreter said
[1:30:45] tell her to stand up in the name of
[1:30:47] Jesus Christ he looked at me like I was
[1:30:49] insane which is you know maybe a
[1:30:51] rational respon response but said no
[1:30:52] tell her to stand up and I took her by
[1:30:54] one hand and he took her by the other
[1:30:56] hand and she stood up and she walked
[1:30:58] through that
[1:30:59] meeting and so the people they start
[1:31:01] gathering around and there's a guy who
[1:31:03] comes up and this guy this remember he's
[1:31:05] blinding his right eye he wanted me to
[1:31:06] pray for his eye to be open and so I
[1:31:08] cover his good eye his left eye and I
[1:31:10] start praying for him and I'm not even
[1:31:12] done praying he says I can see the trees
[1:31:14] in the distance and I'm thinking I can't
[1:31:17] see the trees in the distance thank you
[1:31:20] Jesus and God opened this man's eyes and
[1:31:23] God be to do these different miracles in
[1:31:24] the meetings and this is why I say this
[1:31:26] these Pentecostal ministers you know how
[1:31:28] they are they went from laughing and
[1:31:30] making fun and going oh oh well well
[1:31:32] these are Miracles now we want to see
[1:31:33] this and they're on the edge of their
[1:31:35] seat and they're watching all this so
[1:31:36] they want to talk to me this is why I
[1:31:37] said they all wanted to talk to me
[1:31:39] afterwards so we go in this little Hut I
[1:31:42] guess or whatever like they're talking
[1:31:43] to me and they're just all of a sudden
[1:31:45] these guys they're laughing fun they're
[1:31:46] having a good time man that was great
[1:31:48] and this and that I said tell us how do
[1:31:50] you do these things I said well if you
[1:31:52] want to do these things do what your
[1:31:53] brother did preach the
[1:31:55] message beauti amen it's not me it's not

[1:38:18] weakest of all yet in our weakness your
[1:38:20] strength is made perfect amen and it's
[1:38:23] not by our might or our power but by
[1:38:25] your spirit that today I believe as the
[1:38:29] as as we have heard declared unto us
[1:38:32] there's an invincible Army on the face
[1:38:34] of the Earth amen it is not the strength
[1:38:36] of our arms our own intelligence but the
[1:38:39] might of the same spirit that fell in
[1:38:41] the day of Pentecost that has preserved
[1:38:44] a church through Dark Ages and
[1:38:46] persecutions and false
[1:38:48] doctrines but Lord you never left your

[1:39:13] Lost may we stand what it's
[1:39:15] unpopular may we stand for the right
[1:39:18] thing we're not here to stand against
[1:39:20] people today
[1:39:22] we understand the weapons of our Warfare
[1:39:24] they're not carnal but they are
[1:39:26] Mighty against principalities and powers
[1:39:29] and might and
[1:39:33] dominion and though our enemies they're
[1:39:36] married though they seem to be
[1:39:38] everywhere we understand that there are
[1:39:40] more for us than against us we're
[1:39:44] surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses
[1:39:47] by an innumerable company of
[1:39:50] angels
[1:39:53] the spirit of God the spirit of burning
[1:39:57] is in our midst

[1:40:01] us through every trial through every
[1:40:04] circumstance there's a people here
[1:40:07] though they be in fiery trials yet the
[1:40:09] fiery trying of their faith the trying
[1:40:12] of their faith is it's worth
[1:40:14] more than gold tried in the
[1:40:17] fire lord it doesn't always feel like it
[1:40:21] that doesn't always seem like it but
[1:40:22] you've testified it and we believe it's
[1:40:24] true I pray you just bless this church

[1:40:28] needs represented here today Lord may
