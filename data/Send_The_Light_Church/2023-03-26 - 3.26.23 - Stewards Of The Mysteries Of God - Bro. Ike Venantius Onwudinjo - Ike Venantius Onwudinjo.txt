believe that our God is able to do all things Mighty and eternal God we want to thank you for an opportunity to gather at your feet this morning we want to thank you for your awesome presence in this place I want to thank you for the pastor of this local assembly Pastor John Martin I want to thank you for everyone that comes to Worship in this place I want to thank you for each family that is here today I want to thank you for the message of the hour that is bringing your bride to fruition at this hour Lord Jesus because you live we are living and I am praying oh god father that everyone that is standing here this morning be blessed the Bible tells me that the blessings of God make it rich and it added no sorrow and I ask you oh God that every request in the heart of any man or woman here be met for the Bible tells me that thy hands is not short that you cannot reach us neither is your ear block that you cannot hear us Lord your eyes is wider than these hearts and the scripture said in the book of Nahum that the doors out of your feet is the clouds of the air Lord that is not an impossible before you he will be sick delivery of Christ save he that is dying spiritually and physically Lord Jesus we commit the service the message of today into a hand as we ask you Lord to speak that great word that breaks every Fester down Lord Jesus I pray that oh God my father there will be no circumstances no power no posing Powers anywhere that will stand against your world this morning getting the people to believe you and to trust you today do one thing say one thing that we make one person to believe you better further our faith in you today thank you Lord Jesus for we have prayed in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord just before we take our seats let's read the scripture Hallelujah I want to read from the book of First Corinthians chapter number four First Corinthians chapter number four I believe you have your Bibles First Corinthians chapter four by the grace of God amen verse 1. let a man sow account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God Heavenly Father we pray that you will bless your word this afternoon into our hearts in Jesus Christ's name please be seated God bless you I want to thank Pastor John for the opportunity he has given me to come and to thank the Lord for all that God is using you to do in this place and of course the entire world Amen and celebrating this morning I want to speak on a topic I just we take from that First Corinthians chapter number four verse 1. I call it the steward of the mysteries of God Amen amen these two words of the mysteries of God and I want to believe that there is no message that can be preached that have not been preached before is that right amen what we do is to remind one another of these things because Paul said I believe is Paul he said that you do good if we remind one another of these things Hallelujah and so I have not come to preach anything new I have come to remind you what you know and I want to just do it in a manner by the special grace of God that your faith will come alive again that that heart that is getting weak will be weak no more Hallelujah that's why we are children of God right the servant of the most high told us that he by the special grace of God has taught for us the food for the season Hallelujah and so you see I regretting about this food is it doesn't sour Hallelujah it does not sour any time you take that food you eat it you love to eat it again and again hallelujah praise God anytime you come in contact with this menu it gives you all the nutrients you want amen now you might say physical nutrients is included oh yes because the things of the spirit determines what happens in the physical when you are fed spiritually you will be fed physically because Jesus said when Satan took him up to the Mount to test him to try him he said to him that man does not live by bread alone but by every word every word everyone everyone that proceeded from the mouth of the Lord is the food Glory every what you eat the word it will give you all you need now the Bible said that God has given us all things that pertained to life and godliness is that right all things that pertaining to life and godliness therefore you see the word of God gives us life in the spirit and gives us life in the physical and that's why we don't joke with the word the Bible Paul was speaking he said that it is only day that are dying that are going into darkness that cause the word of God foolish but to us who are saved it is the power of God unto salvation so the Jews and to the Gentiles to every man to the black to the white to the green I don't care the color that word of God is life to us it is the power of God it is we've got no other power accept the word of God not himself say man more than the word that's right yes I have tested these things a little years now and I have found out that it is true amen at every application of the word of God the power of God goes with the word amen so this morning we want to consider what I just title like I said the stewards or the mysteries of God Paul wants us to know right that's we all are stewards of the mysteries of God now you you you want you want to you you want to go down that scripture very well you will find out that Paul was speaking concerning the ministers Hallelujah because when he started speaking when you go to the next verse he spoke of himself all right but you see the word ministers is not limited today that stand at the pulpits oh God praise God he talks of everyone that believes for everyone that believes is giving the power to become amen oh man the Bible said the Book of John chapter 1 verse 12 as many that believe he gave them power to become the sons of God and as a Son of God you are a minister there is something you've got to give so the word here is talking to everybody as many that believe him to you to me to that little boy to that little girl the word is saying that we are still words of the mysteries of God oh glory be to the name of the Lord amen and so it is important for us to define or do it because if you get the concepts then the text will be easier for you praise the Lord amen praise the Lord he said additional meaning here we tell us that are these two words if you want to describe this two word as a noun he said that a steward is a person appointed to manage or to supervise a property or an event anybody appointed to supervise a property or an event the person is a steward right that means he takes charge of the property that is committed unto his hand amen amen he oversees it he makes sure that what the honor of the property has there does not rot he showcases to the whole world to cleanse the property that have been given unto him Hallelujah now I want you to trickle it down to the word of God Paul is saying here that we the Believers are the ones that have been appointed to manage to Showcase Hallelujah the mysteries of God oh my and you know that the mysteries of God are all encapsulated in one mystery the entire mysteries of God is in one mystery that one mystery is Jesus Christ Hallelujah and everything Jesus carries amen because brother and told us in a message called the mystery of Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said that God has a property in him Hallelujah God wanted to do something and that is a mystery to the world right and he came by getting this mystery to you and me by Jesus Christ when God came as a man and then we call him the Son of God or the son of man whichever one applies to you there Hallelujah but you know Christ is came as a son of man a Son of God and the son of David is that right Hallelujah right now he is in the office of the son of God amen Hallelujah he's going to come as the son of David in a millennium he's going to come as the son of David and we are going to rule with him Hallelujah so you see God the almighty God has given his children the power to manage the Mysteries of God the power to show the world the word of God to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost that is what this Bible is telling you and me that's what the scripture is trying to bring forward to us that we have gotten these things as a commitment from God amen and when we when I said that the entire mysteries of God is encapsulated in one mystery which I now told you is Jesus Christ amen I am talking of the word of God and the Revelation therein because in the Book of John chapter 1 the scripture says that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God Amen and the Word was God and the Word was made manifest the Bible said he became a man he became he came in the flesh and he is called Emmanuel God With Us Hallelujah so the mystery of God is the word of God Amen so what have been committed to the hands of the Believers the Believers the True Church of God Hallelujah is nothing but the word of God the revelational power of the word of God that is what I've been committed into our hands and so it will be a shame for us if we cannot showcase this mystery that's right it will be a shame to the church to the bride of Christ if we cannot manage this property that God has given to us amen amen hallelujah God began to speak to us in the Book of Matthew chapter 25. if we begin to read it from verse 1. amen the scripture talked about God likening the kingdom foreign a lord who has many things and servants but one day he choose to go somewhere and he called his servants destroyed and said you take this beat this one five talents the other one two talents the other one one talent and said you manage you occupy see like come oh my I love that language occupied till I come you get that so it's it's not saying keep it until I come it means manage it live by it develop it right make it bigger until I come because he is a businessman do you know that God is a businessman Jesus Christ is a businessman he said in his word I go about my father's business Hallelujah so if he goes by the business of his father it means he's a businessman of course what is business business is to make gain of what you have been given and the Salvation has been given to him right he has to make Gain of it and you see where did where it where it concerns us is that the scripture said that Jesus why he was going away he didn't go with the salvation he left it for us he said as my father sent me so I send you he said the words I do you shall do and greater what shall you do because I go to my father Oh Glory ah what a wonderful word amen I'm feeling happy hearing it again because you know I'm not preaching to you alone I'm preaching to myself Hallelujah he said you occupy till I come right and so it is his Mysteries that he has given to his church to occupy until he comes back right yes so you see when he liking that when the Lord Jesus Christ like in the Kingdom of God in that manner he said to the first person take these five talents the second person two talents the other one one Talent and the Bible tells us that when he came back when the master came back he demanded for each and every one of them to render his accounts all right yes because you know Hallelujah every business at the end of the year they organize what we call a shareholders meeting is that correct yes yes at the end of the year you must come together the chairman the managing director and every stakeholder we call it annual general meeting of the stakeholders is that right and then the stakeholders will sit down and ask the managers of the company he said what have you done this year give us the balance sheet of this company let's know how much gain you have made yeah yeah see spiritual physical things type spiritual is that correct I saw when they said they will ask and the words of this word of that it's okay we traded 27 million tons of Social and so materials and we made so so again and then this and this is this we have spent this on this and this is the balance and the Bible the the we know that when that is done the shareholders received their dividend Jesus is looking for a dividend from every one of us oh yeah if we cannot give the dividends of these Mysteries then we have put him to shame but God forbid God forbid amen we cannot afford to miss it we cannot afford no it is not possible the Church of God cannot afford to fail Jesus Christ because he told us that when he came back the other one with one Talent told him Master here is your talent I know whom you are I have kept it for you and he said he called him what a wicked steward and I pray for every one of us here that God will not call you a wicked steward we shall not be found in that level we want to be praised like the one with the five talents like the one with the two talents the Bible said that he called them and praised them because they made double of what had been given to them now I want you to think what prophet have you made of these Mysteries that have been committed into your hand what prophet every one of us from the puppy to the people what prophet have you made over these things that the Lord has given to us as his children to trade with all glory be to the name of the Lord you see you have to understand whom you are the understanding of whom you are helps you to express yourself better yes yeah amen in second Corinthians chapter five if you begin to read from Verse 18 to 20. can we have it can we have it on the boat and all things are of God who are the reconcile us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation he has given to us so we had become the stewards of the ministry of reconciliation he has given us that to ensure that we reconcile the world to Jesus Christ amen because you want to know that in the beginning the Bible said God made Adam and Eve and he gave them Dominion do you know that he gave them Dominion to rule over this world he said to them also that thou shall occupy increase command but along the way man threw it away but God has a program because God cannot let his property to get rot away and so he began the process amen he started the process even before the foundation of the world Amen because the Bible said that Christ was slain before the foundation of the world and that's why we are not here by accident oh I am not here by accident my name has been written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world for this purpose was the son of man made manifest that he might destroy The Works of unbelief as it occurred in the Garden of Eden let's see let's see half the scripture second Corinthians chapter five so to us he committed unto us the word of reconciliation this is a big word is a very big word the word of reconciliation it looks simple but it is too wide because when you want to reconcile a people there are many things that goes around it that's the truth is that right reconciliation does not just go by only discussing please can you forgive him can you do this no it's part of it all right it's part of it but when you want to reconcile a people right there could be something like okay I give you this all right and you you try everything you can do to get the heart of the people together once again that's the concept of reconciliation amen right now in the next verse can we see the next verse verse 20. okay verse okay have we done verse 19 have I read it to which that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not in putting their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation next one now and then I like that can we Echo it now and then let's read it let's let's enjoy the the scripture he said now then we are ambassadors of Christ [Laughter] we are ambassadors of Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ State be ye reconciled to God but my the point I want to make there is that we are ambassadors that means amen what heaven Curry the bride carries it now the ambassador of America to Nigeria right it's like the president of America in my country is that right what he says is what America is saying isn't that if he doesn't issue me a Visa here I will not be here I don't have to call on uh Biden to issue me a Visa I'll go to his Ambassador isn't that I said I need a visa to visit United States can you give me a Visa then he gives me a Visa and when I come to the Port of Entry nobody will deny me entry because the ambassador of your country has given me the Visa having satisfied me worthy to have it amen is that right now that is the position of Christians yes that is the position of the bride of Christ in this age we are to show the world the word of God amen nothing less nothing more amen so we are ambassadors of Christ we are the stewards of the Mysteries of God praise the name of the Lord so brethren you want to consider in First Peter chapter 2 verse 9. we can still have it because I want us to understand where I'm going so that by the time we are winding down on this message you will know your position and that will help us a lot can we see it first Peter chapter 2 verse 9 he said boy ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should know what show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness until His Marvelous Light now what interests me that most is this to show fault the Praises of God that's the greatest one that interests me that because it makes no sense that you are a royal priesthood you are a prince you are a holy nation you have all these things with you and you don't show it amen and then you put it in your bag who knows what you are carrying in the bag nobody knows what is in your bag until you open it up you've got to show it to the world and then they will believe what you are talking about they will know whom you are if you can't show it you don't have it oh yes you don't have it the evidence that you have it is that you are able to show it fault hallelujah how do you get the word known that we are in the end time you've got to show them how do you get the word know that Jesus Christ is the almighty God you have to demonstrate it how do you show the world that you ah a custodian of the mysteries of God you've got to show the world the mysteries of God if they can't see it then you don't have it you better shut up and walk away amen but the bride is not meant to shut up we are to speak we are to demonstrate we are to show the world because he has given us the power to do it how Jesus said in the book of uh Paul was speaking in the Book of Romans in chapter 8 verse 11 he said if this power that brought Jesus Christ out from the grave lives in you if he does what lives in you if he lives in you he shall Quicken you up he shall Quicken both your mother and physical body and their spiritual body the quickening power is not only there for our Rapture Oh Glory you know that it's not there only for the Rapture Day it is there for now [Music] God has given us all everything Hallelujah I feel happy always knowing that I am one of them oh yes that's that's one great happiness I have I don't care what is happening but anytime I remember that I am one of them I can look at the face of cancer and tell him shut up you have no power over me I can look at any situation of life I said shut up you have no power over me because he that is in me is greater than he that is in the world is that right that's the position of the church fortunately enough it does not die down amen and that's why sometimes I look at us we speak of William arumbraham every day we speak of the past of God in William Braham but we don't manifest the power in our own time amen Hallelujah it is not the messenger that matters most it is the message of the messenger come on Church as much as we glorify our all we thank the Lord for the messenger the Messenger will mean nothing if the message of the messenger does not go into our lives [Music] that's where the the bride in this hour is failing it we are becoming philosophers great writers and great lawyers argumentators we keep arguing brother Abraham said brother Abraham said his brother Abraham going to come back again is he going to ride on the trail again and all this that does not matter most Hallelujah amen and you know what amen the consolation of the angels that form the cloud amen the face of he that was in it was not William Brown whose face was in it the face of Jesus Christ I saw Jesus Christ we transcend all because the Bible said the bride and the bridegroom has become one amen so the headship of Christ has come unto the body amen amen the power of God is in the church today that is the mystery that is part of the Mysteries that we are holding we must be merchandise of this Mysteries we must make merchandise our faith not for gain in our apostles but to gain The Souls of men for the kingdom that's what he stands for you oh praise the name of the Lord you love the Lord today you love him you see the problem with the church is that the church has gone into what Abraham has preached to us about spiritual ammunition Hallelujah we have lost it but I believe amen the remnants must always be there it doesn't matter what is happening amen that disease that Affliction cause spiritual Amnesia cannot catch up with everyone and you are one of them that it will not come around can you say Amen to it it shall not affect you because what is this spiritual Amnesia the Bible the program told us that it is a state in which a man or anybody or whoever cannot identify himself again you don't know whom you are you've lost your senses yeah it's true you don't even know that this is their mother you don't even know that this is your father you can't even identify a wife because you don't know whom you are and told us that the cause of this is shock one of the things that brought spiritual ammunition or ammunition as it is generally is when you have a shock when you are shocked assuming you have an electric shock for instance right right you don't get balance isn't that you lose your senses what we have what the church is suffering today is a shock but I am telling somebody today we've got the power to reverse it if God can return never never charges whom he made a beast at a certain point because he he thought he has gotten the entire world right if God can bring him back from the mind of an animal back to that of a human being how much more will God make his bride greater praise the Lord so today is our day [Applause] today is our day I believe it I know that God is doing something in our life amen I just want to preach on a little bit and I will stop you give me a little more time if you are conversant with that message Abraham preached he says something amen he he told us the causes of this loss of identity like I said one is shock the second one is you know our reasoning being of two opinions when you have two opinions you don't know whether you have to follow your left or your right you've lost your senses it's like a man driving on the way and he's approaching an exit and it's looking at the exit he doesn't know do I take an exit or do I go on the highway what do you think will happen to that person if I just entered anywhere I'll get himself in the bush because he doesn't know the road to follow that's it and that is what has happened to the church yes but I want I I know I'm speaking to the saints of God who today cannot suffer that fit praise the lord we cannot suffer it we are not meant to suffer it it is the devil that should suffer it amen amen the devil lost his sense in heaven and he began to think that maybe he's not God and the Bible said there was war in heaven a battle ranged on and God told him you cannot share this my glory that's right because I can share my glory with anybody so you gotta kick him out amen amen if God kicked him out from Heaven you've got to kick him out of your life Hallelujah he's the only confused person we've got to kick him out of the church we have to tell him you have no power over any child of God we are in control for the mysteries of God that has been committed unto our hands no man can take this no I can't give it up it's the property of my father and I know nobody wants to give up the property of his father easily before any man can take the property of their father from your hand he must give you a great fight in fact sometimes you will swear and we want to die without property if we can do it in the physical terms can't we do it with the spiritual things right yeah we can I believe we can for the power reside with us and so problem said in that message is I can't read it right now but I just want to paraphrase it because of time he said that he's an American and so whatever America was I am whatever America is now I am whatever America will be tomorrow I am because I am identified with America as a citizen that's what Abraham said and we are not citizens of this world we are citizens of heaven and so what happens is is what we are what heaven was is what we are what heaven will be tomorrow is what we will be tomorrow because we are identified with Heaven amen we are of him amen amen amen the Bible said in the Book of Revelation chapter 22 verse 17 he said the bride the bride and cry and the groom they are one and they say come yes Oh Glory amen yes that's who we are we can't suffer that amen preaching in a message he called a man running away from the presence of God Abraham said that we have got responsibilities all of us as bride of Christ we got responsibilities we are responsible for preaching the truth of God's word we cannot shy away from it we are responsible for making sick people to beware amen praise God Amen because he said we cannot join the train the ship to tashish and what is touches denominations John had joined the ship going to touches instead of going to Nineveh where he was sent he left his responsibility and followed another way thinking that there is a way but the truth is that God's program can never be thwarted amen no way you cannot you can run but you cannot hide Hallelujah he run but God brought him back to Nineveh and he have got to preach that message and he preached that message therefore my brethren you cannot run you cannot hide you have got to come out and uphold the mysteries of God for we are the stewards of God hallelujah we must pray for the sick right the prosperity Of The World Is Ours both financially are you afraid to say it are you careful to say it the finances of the world belongs to Christians I'm sure I'm not bringing a new doctrine to you everything that God got the bride got it is ours amen we cannot hide from these things Hallelujah now the Lord said that amen amen that the church is Anointed I'm coming to that now and I want you to get get that into your mind the mystical Body of Christ is greatly anointed right and we are anointed with the word we are anointed with the revelation we are anointed with the holy spirit of God and so we must exercise the powers of the Holy Ghost what's his name Samson was not a huge man Abraham told us that is that right it was such a small man as small as not being able to lift this maybe but when the spirit of God Came Upon him the gates of gods have made no sense he took the gates of Gaza put it on his shoulder and went upstairs I love that amen and so that is what God has given the church for all that was in God he poured into Jesus Christ and all that was in Christ has been poured into the church into the bride and so we must exercise the power of God we must live a life that is worthy of the scripture amen yes we must live their life if our life cannot be Tracy upon Paul said we are the Epistles of God we are the written Epistles of God people today don't have the patience to read the Bible do you know that no there's no time you got your hours at work you want to go to work 10 hours here eight hours the other way now tell me the time you got to open your Bible how much more an unbeliever he got no time to look at the scripture but it's looking at the people he's looking at the person that said he's a Christian and if he cannot see Jesus in that person he will never know Christ that's why it is important for you to understand that you are holding the mysteries of God in trust for him if you can't act it you don't have it you don't have it sir Ma you don't have it to be a great pity said the church is Anointed let's read this scripture Isaiah 11 1-5 show it off the book of Isaiah Isaiah's chapter number 11 verse 1 to 5 I want it on the ball on the screen because I want us to read it together good and they shall come forth a rod out of the this time of Jesus and the branch shall grow out of his roots is that right let's read out now and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of God read on and shall make him of a quick understanding in the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears because of the spirit of God that will be upon him and he is prophesying about Christ prophesying about you and him have you ever seen a place where only the head is moving can you imagine that no I mean only the head a cut off my head and my head is walking can you imagine that no I you see if we are not practical if we are not practical with the things we do we will not understand the scriptures why let's cut off this head and tell the head to move on and let's see whether he can move the head requires the body Jesus Christ is the head of the church requiring the body so the anointing on the head flows into the body that is the church this is the prophecy of the church right amen amen yes sir the church is being prophesied about here yeah amen we will come down with the spirit of wisdom we will come down with the spirit of understanding and of cancer a spirit that will make us to fear the lord that is what the Lord has given us to be able to carry on with the Mysteries that have been committed unto us Hallelujah in Isaiah chapter 10 verse 27 let's read it Isaiah 10 27. I like that again what a great scripture he said and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from all thy shoulders and his yoke from off thy neck and the York shall be destroyed because of the anointing you know this story very wise we was talking about the time that they are syrians we are we are we are tormenting the the the the the the the the the the Israelites that was what was going on here they place a lot of yoke on the Israelites but God through this Prophet said wait on my brethren my sons and daughters I am going to anoint you and when I anoint you amen the burdens of the serious and the syrians shall not be upon your head any longer [Music] what we break that yoke is the anointing and in the book of Acts chapter 2 God poured out the anointing that's right the holy ghosts he said and thou shaltari in Jerusalem and wait for me there go nowhere until you be endured with power from our high and the Bible said that on that day as they were praying at the upper room the power came in rights like a Russian might win and settled upon each and every one of them like a clothing tongue of Fire and that is how it is cycling upon every bride yes every one of us sitting down here I want you to feel it we are not talking Theory we are talking of practical things have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed can you put down a history of how the Holy Spirit Come Came Upon you can you remember it if you can then you are a steward of the mysteries of God and you cannot fail amen amen you cannot fear if Jesus did not fail you can not fail amen I say it one more time if Jesus couldn't fail you cannot fail if the spirit of God never disappointed you cannot disappoint he settled upon each and every one of them anywhere I go I always tell the people I have a history of when I receive the Holy Ghost it's a story I don't forget I receive the Holy Spirit on the 26th of February 1999. yes I can tell you all that happened that day you cannot win a prize and not remember the day the award was that's the price that we won at Calvary the Bible said at Calvary he won us all is that right that that man of calvary has won my hands for himself you remember it you remember the day then I can tell you that the mystery of God is with you and so there is no chance I said to this church there is no chance that man that is sick today you will be healed somebody did not hear me very well you didn't get it I said that sick man or sick woman today you'll be healed [Music] amen the impossibilities of your life will be set off today for the Lord is with us here do you know there is no age of the Gentiles that the Lord identified himself with a pair of Fire and the prayer the cloud but he did with this age yes amen and a pair of fire was that spirit that led them amen and if he led them and they got victory he will lead us and we will get victims amen he's leading us today and we are getting Victory that's why I'm confident to tell you by the time we finish today the situation of your life we get out of you I want somebody that can believe Jesus hear me hear me this power is given to both the Jews and the Gentiles for Christ is not a respect of any man Peter said so when he came to the house of Cornelius he said I can perceive that God is not a respect of any man that's why I tell you we cannot continue to talk about Abraham and not do what Abraham did Ibraham loved we are bound to love that's right amen if he died at the altar to love somebody Hallelujah we must die at the altar to love one another if he stood with the Holy Spirit to Proclaim healing upon anybody we can still stand with the holy spirit amen and Proclaim healing to everyone that is seek here therefore diabetes is not for you I don't know who I'm talking to me I'm talking to somebody here I said diabetes is not your Birthright Hallelujah diabetes whether it is diabetes 1 or diabetes two High BP high blood pressure cancer anything amen it's not your property your property is the mysteries of God today is somebody's day I believe it with all my heart you are not living this home the way you came in you're going to leave this Hall better than you can Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to them forever amen I believe it Hallelujah Church we are the anointed bride of Christ and as anointed as we are we must show forth this anointing yes oh yes amen where Abraham told us in the message he called that I just quoted that is the Christ the mystery of God revealed he said that the anointed one is upon the anointed people the anointed one is now not just upon but in the anointed people so the one God is now in many gods you understand what I'm saying that one God is known in Gods know you not the Bible said that them that the word of God came to they are called Gods amen and the word of God Has Come to Us therefore we are gods yeah we are little girls praise the name of the Lord God is with us here we cannot fail I will not wish our time any longer because I know the peculiarities of this country Hallelujah amen I want to tell you today Moses was the steward of God and in the Book of Numbers Chapter 20. the Bible said and God spoke to Moses and Aaron he said to Moses you go down to the Rock and speak to the Rock and The Rock will give water and you and I know that the water was not a cup of water for there we are up to 2 million or more right and so it is wasn't a little stream it was the Fountain of water the living Fountain and Jesus came and identified himself as a fountain of the Living Water Hallelujah whosoever drilled the water shall not die but he shall live Moses held that mystery and he spoke to the Rock even though yeah he spoke to the Rock and the water came out Hallelujah the same Moses as a custodian of the mysteries of God made a brass serpent Abraham taught us that is the judged judged sin yeah amen hang it on a tree and said whosoever look at shall not die but leave and Jesus gave me the Book of John chapter 3 and he said as Moses lifted up that brass serpent so shall the son of man be lifted up and whosoever look at shall not die but leave so I want to tell somebody here today look and live amen amen we are going to demonstrate the mysteries of God it is with us amen it is here we have got to show it we are not going to baby it we are going to show it to the world the realization of whom you are is important Moses did it you can speak again remember Moses went with his rod in his hand is that right amen he went with the rod and the road signifies the judgment therefore we are with the rod the rod is the word for in the book of Psalm he said for thou he said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want isn't that correct amen he said though I walk through the valley of the Shadows of death I shall fear no evil amen for their rods and their words they do what they comfort me the rod of God is here somebody will be comforted here today do you believe that yes somebody must be comforted because that road is within it doesn't matter the value of the shadow of death you are passing through in Psalms chapter 23. Jesus Christ is here amen I am glad because he said something in Malachi chapter 3 verse 17. he said on that day I will do something that the world we know there that surveyed me and there that served me not there must be a demarcation line something must show that you serve him something must show because you have the mysteries of God do you believe that do you believe that I want you to feel it I'm not just speaking to entertain anybody I'm not here to entertain you amen I am here to bring down the Mysteries and remind you that you are a custodian of it in case you are forgotten he is still saving people today the door salvation is still open go into the whole world and preach the gospel Brethren the Great Commission is with us Mark chapter 16 verse 15. down to 17 is still with the church this side shall follow them that believe amen yes that science shall follow us because we believe that sign is here that sign is the Holy Ghost that's the great sign and then the other side the walking of Miracles and the rest is for us to perform because the power of God is with us you got a broken home you have issues today God will amend it you have problem with your children God can touch them yeah if sister had your rights could get the two children saved your own children will be saved today Jesus the same yesterday to them forever amen amen we are still operating the creative Ministry of William Brown we are a child of the the top pool of William arambraham the word ministry all is encapsulated in US think about it think about it what stood against us is less than what is standing with us do you know the book of First John chapter the Bible says and then in chapter 4 verse 17 he said that as God is so shall we be and he also said in first John I think two or three numbers one he said we don't know yet whom we shall be like but we know that when he shall come we will be like him right amen amen amen so everything about God is with us could you just rise on your feet he paid it up I could not pay I old adapt I could not pay I need that someone to wash my sins away and now I say a brand new song I'm Amazing Grace all the Lord by Jesus Faith adapts that I could never pay that man of God as one my heart from me and I to set me free flashlight [Music] I want you to look at that situation around you I want to tell you cancer can be taken away from your body or the body of your loved ones at this hour for the Bible said that he sent his word and this word healed them and delivered them he has sent his word again this morning his word is able to deliver you I got a friend I was telling my brother two days ago I got a friend that lives in London a sister that was afflicted with the cancer of the breasts and she started going for chemotherapy but one day on his schedule day for another chemotherapy the doctors took him in and there was no reaction again after we have prayed just a night before them amen and they said what is happening we have not seen this type before where is the cancer a cancer that I've taken over all the breasts disappeared oh Jesus Christ and then insisted that he should go for radiograph radiography or what I'm not a medical person to confirm and she went and they couldn't find any trace of cancer that same God is here today look unto Jesus Christ the author and the finish of our faith begin to look at him at this hour and I asked our sister the keyboards just give us any song as we pray [Music] I want you to think about it God's gift is for them that love him do you love him God's special things Heritage are for there that love him if you have not submitted to serving God today is your day I want to tell you there is no tomorrow we don't know this might just be the last meeting we will have on Earth there might be no opportunity for anybody again so I want you to hand it over to him and tell him Lord take over my life for I know nothing take over my spirit let it be yours fill me up this morning teach me Lord to wait can you play for me Teach Me Love to wait down on my knees foreign [Music] my place [Music] in prayer foreign [Music] that's right [Music] yes Lord let's take the next stanza of that song my heart [Music] and God for your name if my face keep my eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh yes Jesus officials [Music]
