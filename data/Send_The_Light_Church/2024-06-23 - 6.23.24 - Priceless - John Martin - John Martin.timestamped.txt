[38:55] the in the house and I was measuring my
[39:01] ears and and I
[39:03] noticed not just by sight but I took a
[39:07] scale and I made sure that what I was
[39:08] seeing is correct and I I actually my
[39:11] one ear is bigger than the other
[39:16] ear I and
[39:21] uh definitely imperfect this body is
[39:25] imperfect amen
[39:28] but God purchased all of us amen not
[39:32] just our soul but he he purchased our
[39:34] spirit and our bodies and even though
[39:37] our bodies don't inherit the Kingdom of
[39:40] Heaven God still purchased it and and he
[39:43] wants to use it on a temporary basis
[39:46] amen first Thessalonians tells us that
[39:49] and the Very God of Peace sanctify you
[39:52] holy and I pray God your whole spirit
[39:55] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[40:00] until the coming of the Lord Jesus
[40:02] Christ
[40:03] amen this morning as we're listening to
[40:06] God's word the word can actually discern
[40:10] or
[40:12] aunder the the soul and the spirit
[40:15] that's inside of us right amen just like
[40:18] the word can discern the very thoughts
[40:20] and intents of our heart amen this
[40:23] morning we want to talk about our our
[40:26] worth what our our worth is amen the
[40:29] Bible says that we're bought with a
[40:31] price everything has a value when you go
[40:35] to garage sales you look at what you
[40:39] think would be a good deal that you
[40:41] could use when you're hunting for a
[40:44] house you're you're looking for a good
[40:47] deal when last week we bought a car and
[40:50] of course you you don't want to spend
[40:52] too much money on a car you want to
[40:54] spend what you think would be a good
[40:56] deal many of us have been on Facebook
[40:58] Marketplace looking for a good deal
[41:02] amen the company I work for they
[41:04] manufact your custom tools and and parts
[41:07] in each
[41:09] job when it's quoted it takes so much
[41:12] time to do that job and our time is
[41:16] valuable uh because we have to pay of
[41:19] the employees and the expenses and and
[41:22] so each job has a certain amount that we
[41:26] would bid to get that job and if if if
[41:29] if if we we just can't do the the job
[41:32] for uh it takes eight hours to do and
[41:34] you just can't do it for
[41:36] $2 right you you would you wouldn't be a
[41:39] to get anywhere amen let's say your AC
[41:42] goes out at your home and you want to
[41:45] replace it because it's pretty hot out
[41:47] am and you get a quote for
[41:49] $46,500
[41:52] are you going to replace that AC unit
[41:55] for that price
[41:57] no way
[42:00] Jose because the quoted value is higher
[42:04] than what you think it's
[42:06] worth now let's say your family is
[42:09] expanding you want to buy a new home
[42:13] gated in a gated community it's got the
[42:16] swimming pool it's all blocked in it's
[42:18] real nice and it's just a newer home and
[42:23] and and and they this the going price is
[42:26] the same 46
[42:28] $1,500 now are you going to want to buy
[42:32] that uh
[42:34] yeah a couple of those because you you
[42:39] the value of that is is such a good
[42:42] price for you it's worth it to you
[42:45] amen Jesus is that Merchant man amen
[42:50] seeking goodly pearls that's you
[42:53] amen now when he found you and I'll say
[42:56] you as the whole because he's not going
[42:59] to one is not going to be left behind he
[43:03] sold all that he had and he bought it
[43:06] and you are bought with a
[43:10] price everything has some kind of value
[43:12] your body does your spirit does your
[43:15] soul does Amen now we're taught that if
[43:18] your body weighed 150 pounds and you
[43:21] combined the value of all the uh
[43:24] elements there in inside
[43:27] uh that you would be worth at one time
[43:29] about 84 cents your body that's the
[43:33] value of your body brother Bram said in
[43:35] the message separation from unbelief he
[43:38] says but that soul brother that's in
[43:40] there tonight in the front of God is
[43:45] worth 10 million worlds true amen 10
[43:52] million worlds that's right now you take
[43:55] care of that 84 cents
[43:58] yeah but you'll just let anything come
[44:01] into that Soul amen he said let's be
[44:04] sensible
[44:05] brother let's really serve the Lord
[44:10] amen now brother brand made mention of
[44:12] 10,000 worlds it's 10 10 million worlds
[44:15] what he's trying to do is put a
[44:18] something out there that is
[44:20] unconceivable man hard to imagine the
[44:24] value it's so far out there so he makes
[44:27] the statement he's really not saying
[44:29] it's worth that right are you with me
[44:33] amen Jesus taught that our soul is more
[44:36] valuable than our body if you want to
[44:37] turn to Matthew chapter 10 or up on this
[44:40] screen verse number 27 says what I tell
[44:43] you in darkness that speak in the light
[44:45] amen and what you hear in the air that
[44:48] preach ye upon the housetops Amen in
[44:51] fear not them which kill the body now
[44:55] that word fear means reverence don't
[44:57] don't reverence them that which are
[44:59] which kill the body but are not able to
[45:02] kill the soul that's right that ought to
[45:04] make us Fearless right there amen but
[45:07] rather reverence him that is able to
[45:10] destroy both soul and Body in hell so
[45:15] he's
[45:17] separating the the the the different
[45:19] part of
[45:20] us and and he's he's telling us to
[45:24] reverence one but not the other the one
[45:28] that has control of the Soul we all got
[45:32] a soul and that's why we're here today
[45:34] is to get our soul more like the nature
[45:38] of God amen amen verse 29 are not Two
[45:41] Sparrows sold for a
[45:43] farling and one of them shall not fall
[45:46] to the ground without your
[45:49] father but the very hairs of your head
[45:52] are all numbered fear ye not therefore
[45:55] ye are more valuable
[45:57] than many sparrows now notice he didn't
[46:00] say all the
[46:03] sparrows he just said many of
[46:06] them so is he is he talking about my
[46:11] soul what's the comparison
[46:16] here
[46:18] wherefore okay whosoever therefore shall
[46:20] confess me before men him I confess
[46:23] before my Father which is in heaven so
[46:27] he goes right back to verse 27 that what
[46:30] I tell you speak
[46:33] it but whosoever shall deny me before
[46:37] men him will I also deny before my
[46:40] Father which is in
[46:43] heaven Matthew 16 we just trying to show
[46:48] the different the the the the the
[46:51] different values
[46:53] here verse Matthew 16: 26 for what is a
[46:57] man profited if he gain the whole world
[47:01] and lose his own
[47:03] soul or what shall a man give in
[47:07] exchange for his soul Jesus is asking us
[47:10] to put an actual price tag on our soul
[47:13] right amen and the body could have
[47:17] everything in this world and the Soul
[47:19] could still be
[47:22] lost so what shall a man give in
[47:25] exchange for his soul
[47:27] think about this world there people go
[47:30] to church and they don't even think
[47:31] about their soul right they're wanting
[47:35] something that makes them feel
[47:39] good but Jesus could not value your soul
[47:43] worth one
[47:46] world what shall you give in exchange
[47:49] for his soul he could not say it was
[47:51] worth one world how about two how about
[47:55] three or four a thousand or 10,000 or 10
[47:58] million you cannot compare something
[48:02] natural with something that has a chance
[48:05] of Eternity amen right and that's what
[48:08] every human being has he has a chance of
[48:13] Eternity of course the soul that doesn't
[48:16] get converted now that doesn't get born
[48:18] again cannot enter the kingdom of God
[48:21] that's right right so it has to be
[48:23] converted it has to be changed and and
[48:26] and souls are going to perish right many
[48:31] many go in there at Jesus said few be
[48:33] that find it so more people do not get
[48:37] converted than ever do get converted
[48:39] amen right now our soul that is
[48:42] priceless it lives in a a body that's
[48:45] not worth very
[48:48] much look at the
[48:50] kings in the past celebrities movie
[48:53] stars we hear people dying all the time
[48:57] athletes musicians great men that have
[49:00] had Great
[49:01] accomplishments but when it was over
[49:04] it's over right it's really over so how
[49:08] can we how can we compare this world to
[49:12] Eternity Psalms chapter 90 if You' like
[49:15] to turn there Psalms chapter 90 starting
[49:17] with verse number n are you getting
[49:19] something out of this all right for all
[49:22] our days are passed away in thy wrath we
[49:25] spend our years
[49:27] as a tale that is told so you just think
[49:30] of somebody that's gone on and you could
[49:32] just tell the
[49:35] tale of the years that they've had the
[49:38] days of our years are three score and 10
[49:43] 70 right but if by reason of strength
[49:47] they be 80 years yet is their strength
[49:51] and labor
[49:54] sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly
[49:58] away amen praise the Lord amen our
[50:03] bodies stay here from where they came
[50:06] but our souls leave amen who knoweth the
[50:09] power of thine anger even according to
[50:12] thy fear so is thy wrath God wants us to
[50:16] reverence him amen so teach us to number
[50:20] our days that we may apply our hearts
[50:23] unto wisdom amen
[50:27] we only got so many
[50:29] days many don't make it to 70
[50:33] amen I don't have a we don't have a we
[50:36] don't know if we're going to wake up we
[50:37] don't even know if we're going to meet
[50:38] here next
[50:40] week it's by the grace of God so we need
[50:43] to take take this soberly James said
[50:46] that our life is but a vapor or smoke it
[50:48] it appears for a while and then it's
[50:50] gone we've all seen a vapor how it
[50:53] just is there and then it's not there
[50:56] anymore amen
[50:58] right we only have so much time to get
[51:02] our soul completely converted or if I
[51:05] could say it like this to those who feel
[51:08] it's already completely converted we've
[51:10] only got so much time to get our nature
[51:13] completely changed
[51:16] am and it's a work in process
[51:20] right because God is coming for a bride
[51:23] without spot a wrinkle now if if our
[51:25] nature did need to be changed then look
[51:29] all we need to do is just Lord I accept
[51:32] what you did at Calvary and I don't need
[51:34] to worry about my nature change but we
[51:37] do we do need that that because that's
[51:40] part of the that's part of the process
[51:43] amen first Peter chap 1 verse
[51:47] 23 I hope it's okay just going through
[51:49] these scriptures kind of quick being
[51:52] born again not of corruptible seed but
[51:55] incorrupt Able by the word of God which
[51:58] liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh
[52:02] is as grass our body right is as the
[52:05] grass and the glory of man as the flower
[52:08] of that grass so just think of all these
[52:11] people that had done great things or
[52:13] that you uh got records and sports and
[52:17] the grass withth and the flower thereof
[52:19] falleth away but the word of the Lord
[52:22] endureth forever and this is the word
[52:25] which by the go goel is preached on to
[52:28] you the only thing that's going to last
[52:30] is the word of God that's inside our
[52:33] soul amen if that doesn't happen it
[52:37] don't matter what we achieve in this
[52:38] life it doesn't matter what we do it'll
[52:40] Veil to nothing that's
[52:43] right people can really get mixed up on
[52:46] the value of
[52:48] things like how much they're really
[52:51] worth or how much others are worth you
[52:54] know some people wouldn't give a Wooden
[52:55] Nickel for somebody
[52:58] body or how much Jesus is
[53:02] worth some just swear take his name in
[53:10] vain there are those who thought the
[53:12] life of Jesus was worth 30 pieces of
[53:15] silver that's
[53:17] right some thought a thief and a robber
[53:20] was more valuable than
[53:23] Jesus people can really get mixed up on
[53:25] the on what things are are valued at or
[53:30] like taking up an offering in Mark 12:
[53:33] 41 and Jesus sat over against the
[53:36] treasury and be behold how the people
[53:38] cast money into the treasury and many
[53:41] that were Rich cast Rich cast in
[53:45] much so just so you know we want to
[53:47] follow this scripture today we want to
[53:49] talk about this one
[53:51] know and there came a certain poor
[53:54] Widow and she threw in two mites which
[53:58] make up a farling and he called unto his
[54:02] disciples you know he's always teaching
[54:05] called unto his disciples and he saith
[54:07] unto them verily I say unto you that
[54:09] this poor
[54:11] wiow have cast more in than all they
[54:16] that have cast into the
[54:18] treasury and they're thinking how can
[54:21] this be I mean I got a calculator I know
[54:25] how to add
[54:28] but see God is looking at the value of
[54:31] the antenna of the
[54:33] heart and he says for all they did cast
[54:37] of their abundance it's what they had
[54:39] that they I got this to give today so
[54:41] I'm going to give today but
[54:43] she of her want in other words I do not
[54:49] want to put this in right but I'm going
[54:51] to yes
[54:53] sir she cast in all that
[54:56] she had you talk about being able to
[55:00] trust God that
[55:01] much even all her
[55:05] living I'm so glad that God sees
[55:08] everything amen amen sees everything and
[55:11] and if we could just have if we could
[55:13] look through the eyes of God and see
[55:16] things the way that he sees them I think
[55:19] there'd be a lot less drama in our life
[55:21] don't you
[55:22] amen now Satan has got gotten many
[55:25] people to devalue the
[55:29] church in this age they've they've
[55:31] kicked out Jesus out of the church and
[55:34] he's actually standing on the outside of
[55:37] the door of Freemore agency knocking and
[55:41] and asking if he could come in and S
[55:43] with people because the people that are
[55:46] the head of the church don't put allow
[55:48] the Holy Ghost to be behind the pit am
[55:52] because if they did there wouldn't be
[55:53] very many people in the church right I
[55:56] mean
[55:56] look at even his own disciples left him
[56:00] when he began to preach the strong word
[56:02] of
[56:04] God now Moses was just an Avenue for the
[56:09] people to get out of the claws of
[56:12] pharaoh they were happy they rejoiced
[56:15] when they when they they left Egypt but
[56:18] after that they didn't want to listen to
[56:20] this man they wanted to get a different
[56:21] leader right amen the prophet in this
[56:25] age was just an Avenue for some people
[56:28] to get out of the Clause of
[56:30] denominations like they got this great
[56:33] Revelation about how bad the
[56:35] denominations and I'm so glad that we
[56:38] I'm in a message now that just believes
[56:40] that you know to come out of her and I
[56:41] did that I'll tell you when I was in the
[56:45] denomination I knew something was wrong
[56:47] with
[56:48] it right amen and I think God is not
[56:51] just calling us out but he's calling us
[56:53] in into a relationship with him into the
[56:56] the promised land of a nature
[56:59] change there's more for
[57:04] us Church ought to be
[57:07] respected amen a place where God
[57:12] speaks not man not all that's just
[57:14] brother John you know how he is
[57:18] right well we know how he is the but do
[57:22] we know really how God is
[57:26] that's why Jesus said he that has ears
[57:28] to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is
[57:32] saying amen it's a good prayer to pray
[57:35] God give me ears today that's a good
[57:37] prayer to pray Satan has devalued the
[57:42] church he's brought disrespect right
[57:45] into the
[57:46] sanctuary talking joking entertainment
[57:50] pass the
[57:51] coffee you've you've been into these
[57:54] churches where they have just about
[57:55] everything
[57:58] defiled the sanctuary with iniquities no
[58:01] reverence people can't endure sound
[58:04] Doctrine anymore they don't want that
[58:05] they want something that doesn't hurt
[58:08] them they want a certain type of
[58:12] ministry rather than I just want to hear
[58:14] from God I don't care
[58:16] what I don't care how it feels I just
[58:19] want to hear from God Amen there's a
[58:22] famine in the land for the hearing of
[58:24] the word amen that's true brother bam
[58:27] said this is where we
[58:29] come and we let the word of
[58:32] God discern our heart and tell us where
[58:35] we're really standing with him yes now a
[58:38] proud person says I don't need that I
[58:41] know where I'm standing with God that's
[58:43] that is a person who thinks they know
[58:45] their heart where the scripture tells us
[58:48] we don't know our heart we have to allow
[58:51] God to speak and and see if our our
[58:54] heart becomes our conscience becomes
[58:57] tender uh be becomes uh open and and and
[59:02] tender to where God can speak to it and
[59:04] say yes that's true because it's going
[59:07] to be a a still Small Voice it's not
[59:11] always going to be some rocket thing and
[59:13] we have some um something happen out
[59:16] here that makes your eyes go real big
[59:18] right right know it's about a real
[59:21] genuine
[59:22] relationship and and we go we we we
[59:25] leave church and we go and we spend
[59:27] every day out there doing what we want
[59:29] to do and and and and and to this is a
[59:33] place that is truly the place that we
[59:35] hear from God we don't hear from
[59:37] man now if you're hearing from man
[59:40] you're in a place of carnality Amen I'm
[59:43] just going to say it you know flesh is
[59:46] contacting flesh and and it's got to be
[59:49] the inside contacting God right it just
[59:52] got to
[59:53] be Satan's goal is to de to devalue
[1:00:00] us he not only wants to devalue the
[1:00:03] church in the ministry but he wants to
[1:00:05] devalue
[1:00:06] us he wants to make us feel like our
[1:00:09] soul is only worth 84
[1:00:12] cents like it's not worth trying to get
[1:00:16] the Holy Ghost come on like it's not
[1:00:20] worth trying to to go up to the Altar
[1:00:22] and get closer to God Amen it's not
[1:00:25] worth spending extra time in prayer it's
[1:00:28] not worth living for
[1:00:31] others right devaluing who we are amen
[1:00:36] how many times is the devil lied to you
[1:00:38] try to make you feel like you weren't
[1:00:40] worth
[1:00:43] anything come on
[1:00:47] Amen how many times you felt nobody just
[1:00:50] tells me they appreciate
[1:00:52] me come
[1:00:54] on I like the story that was told about
[1:00:57] the Old
[1:00:59] Violin there is an estate sale going on
[1:01:03] and you have been to estate sales and
[1:01:06] auctions where they're auctioning off
[1:01:08] things and well there was one going on
[1:01:11] and there were things that were being
[1:01:13] sold some were pretty good priced and
[1:01:16] some was a bunch of
[1:01:18] junk it wasn't going for very much and
[1:01:22] one of the items that came on to be
[1:01:25] bided was an Old Violin and the
[1:01:27] auctioneer just said who'll give me
[1:01:31] $35 and I tell you from the look of it
[1:01:34] it was all dusty it just didn't look one
[1:01:37] of the strings was hanging it just
[1:01:38] didn't look very good nobody bit on it
[1:01:41] he said 25 and he said 10 he said who
[1:01:45] will start the bid off for five and
[1:01:49] nobody nobody bit on it the auctioneer
[1:01:53] said it was made by a 21 year old boy
[1:01:57] back during World War II when money was
[1:02:01] scarce and his name was
[1:02:04] Jack jock
[1:02:07] Francis and nobody had heard of the lad
[1:02:10] and it just sounded absolutely horrible
[1:02:12] when he strung it trying to get the
[1:02:15] attention of the
[1:02:17] people someone in the midst of
[1:02:19] them stood up went up to the front
[1:02:23] grabbed the Old Violin
[1:02:25] dusted it off said just a minute
[1:02:29] here I see something here and he put the
[1:02:33] string back on he tuned it up real quick
[1:02:38] and he began to play Amazing Grace How
[1:02:40] Sweet the
[1:02:42] Sound and the whole audience got in in
[1:02:46] awe of what was really happening that
[1:02:48] such a
[1:02:50] beautiful uh tune uh music could come
[1:02:54] forth from an in instrument that just
[1:02:57] didn't look like it was worth
[1:03:00] anything and then he said uh who give me
[1:03:04] 100 and then 200 and 300 and before you
[1:03:07] know it the the thing was selling for
[1:03:11] thousands of
[1:03:13] dollars all because there was now an
[1:03:16] awareness by the people of the value of
[1:03:20] that violin
[1:03:22] am it was the same violin right
[1:03:26] what
[1:03:27] changed was how it was
[1:03:31] viewed and Satan's job is to try to get
[1:03:34] us to look at our lives is not valuable
[1:03:38] right amen because we place so much
[1:03:42] emphasis on on how
[1:03:45] others communicate with us and talk to
[1:03:48] us and the thoughts that we think and we
[1:03:51] need to know who we are we need to know
[1:03:54] who we belong to and that never
[1:03:58] changes but this one
[1:04:01] violin it was from Paris France it was
[1:04:05] made during the Nazi occupation of Paris
[1:04:09] and the bridge was stamped with his name
[1:04:11] jock Francis the artwork on the back by
[1:04:15] an artist of a Margaret depicting Christ
[1:04:18] and Mary Magdalene and today if you
[1:04:20] would go on Google you would find out
[1:04:22] that you can buy that same violin for
[1:04:24] $95
[1:04:28] $5,000
[1:04:32] wow God saw your value way before you
[1:04:35] were born amen God it was during the
[1:04:39] devil's occupation here on Earth right
[1:04:44] amen but I'll tell
[1:04:46] you on your Bridge he stamped the blood
[1:04:50] of Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ he has provided away every time
[1:04:55] we come to church to really hear the
[1:04:57] voice of God speaking to us
[1:05:00] personally our souls are Priceless in
[1:05:02] the sight of God today amen that's right
[1:05:06] God knows what it's like to be separated
[1:05:08] from him eternally we down here people
[1:05:11] down here don't think about
[1:05:13] that they they don't spend time thinking
[1:05:16] about what happens after death what
[1:05:19] happens when I die because if we take
[1:05:23] time to think of that thought we may
[1:05:25] Recon consider our what we do down here
[1:05:29] right Calvary is what makes our
[1:05:33] soul value Priceless amen it's Calvary
[1:05:39] it's because he saved it not All Souls
[1:05:41] are going to be saved so what is the
[1:05:43] value of a soul that's in Hell eternally
[1:05:48] separated from
[1:05:50] God it's the life of God's blood coming
[1:05:53] inside of US changing our nature that's
[1:05:56] what makes it Priceless amen and now God
[1:06:00] knows that our soul even when it's not
[1:06:03] converted if it belongs to him if it's
[1:06:05] part of that great pearl of great price
[1:06:08] if it's part of that whole Pearl it's
[1:06:11] just as Priceless in an unconverted
[1:06:13] State as it is when it's converted but
[1:06:16] I'll say this to you you can't rest
[1:06:18] going on the other side without being
[1:06:21] converted because then you're you're
[1:06:23] just proving that you were not part of
[1:06:26] that great price amen you've got to get
[1:06:29] converted you've got to get serious
[1:06:32] about getting a nature
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:35] change God bought
[1:06:38] you you were his from the
[1:06:42] beginning and then you got
[1:06:45] lost you got lost you really got stolen
[1:06:48] from the devil amen but God bought you
[1:06:51] back amen amen that's right you're
[1:06:55] bought
[1:06:56] with a
[1:06:57] price all we have to do now is believe
[1:07:01] the word of God
[1:07:04] enough to follow it to obey it right
[1:07:09] that's what brings about a change nature
[1:07:13] turn with me to First Peter chapter 1 1
[1:07:15] Peter chapter 1 verse 13 and if you want
[1:07:17] if you get tired you can just stand up
[1:07:20] shake
[1:07:22] yourself I know some of you are working
[1:07:24] in that heat
[1:07:26] 1 Peter chapter 1:3 wherefore G up the
[1:07:29] loins of your mind be sober and hope to
[1:07:33] the end for the grace that is to be
[1:07:34] brought to you at the revelation of
[1:07:36] Jesus Christ as obedient children now
[1:07:39] not fashion yourselves according to your
[1:07:41] formal desires and lust and your
[1:07:44] ignorance but as he which have called
[1:07:46] you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner
[1:07:50] of way that you conduct yourself that's
[1:07:52] right because it is written for is Holy
[1:07:55] for I am Holy for if ye call on the
[1:07:58] father who without respect to P persons
[1:08:01] judgeth according to Every Man's work
[1:08:03] past the time of your sojourning here in
[1:08:06] fear for as much as you know that you
[1:08:08] were not
[1:08:11] redeemed with corruptible things amen as
[1:08:15] silver and gold from your vain
[1:08:19] conversations received by the tradition
[1:08:22] of all the denominations that you came
[1:08:24] from right
[1:08:26] but with the precious blood of Christ
[1:08:30] amen as of a lamb without blemish
[1:08:35] without
[1:08:37] spot the Precious Blood of the Lamb
[1:08:40] think about this there there is nothing
[1:08:44] greater in the existence of the whole
[1:08:48] universe right nothing is more valuable
[1:08:53] than God's own son that was per perfect
[1:08:56] that he died that blood the value of
[1:09:00] that blood he placed as great as us when
[1:09:05] we were dead in our sins think about
[1:09:07] that the value of us being
[1:09:11] saved is the same as the value of the
[1:09:15] blood of the Son of God Amen I'll tell
[1:09:18] you that's pretty Priceless am Amen to
[1:09:20] me that's
[1:09:23] priceless who verily was
[1:09:25] foreordained before the foundation of
[1:09:28] the world but was manifest in these last
[1:09:30] times for you who by him do believe in
[1:09:33] God that raised him from the dead and
[1:09:35] gave him glory that your Faith and Hope
[1:09:38] might be in
[1:09:40] God God valued
[1:09:44] you the same as his only begotten son
[1:09:48] God exchanged himself for you think
[1:09:50] about that you're not
[1:09:54] just a
[1:09:56] uh something that set aside separated
[1:10:00] from God like this is
[1:10:04] separated but we are a part of God

[1:14:23] corrects why because you're Priceless
[1:14:27] amen your feeling should not dictate to
[1:14:30] you your value that's right amen that's
[1:14:34] right we are not carnal people that have
[1:14:37] to be feeling like we're worth
[1:14:40] something we by Revelation know what
[1:14:43] we're
[1:14:45] worth amen that's it
[1:14:49] amen look if I got to if I can talk you
[1:14:52] into feeling your Priceless that means
[1:14:56] somebody that's can come by and talk you

[1:15:07] this we hold our
[1:15:10] value we hold our value it don't
[1:15:15] depreciate it doesn't go the other
[1:15:18] way you know you buy a car you drive it
[1:15:21] off the lot wait a week see go go to try
[1:15:23] to sell it back don't even drive it you
[1:15:29] lose but you don't lose your
[1:15:33] value doesn't matter who looks down on
[1:15:36] you doesn't
[1:15:39] matter
[1:15:41] how how they belittle
[1:15:44] you when you're feeling like you're
[1:15:46] getting picked on I want you to remember
[1:15:49] the donkey
[1:15:51] story there was this old farmer
[1:15:55] and you know what his donkey had come to
[1:15:58] the point in his life where he just
[1:15:59] wasn't worth anything anymore and he was
[1:16:02] just going to bury
[1:16:04] him CU he was just too much of a
[1:16:08] pain and so he had this one well that
[1:16:11] was all dried up and couldn't be used
[1:16:15] anymore for drawing water so he just
[1:16:18] took that old donkey and he threw him in
[1:16:21] the
[1:16:22] well and he began to take this dirt and
[1:16:26] just one by one start filling
[1:16:32] up the well and the dirt hit the
[1:16:36] donkey's back and you know the donkey
[1:16:39] had been so good to his master all these
[1:16:43] years uh lifted many burdens for the old
[1:16:48] farmer plowed many
[1:16:51] Gardens and he was down there feeling
[1:16:54] like he just wasn't worth anything kind
[1:16:58] of like feeling used you ever been you
[1:16:59] ever felt like you were used
[1:17:02] before that's exactly how this old
[1:17:04] donkey was feeling just used no
[1:17:08] respect so this is dirt was hitting him
[1:17:10] he was just thinking what am I going to
[1:17:11] do this must is this is this going to be
[1:17:14] my end is it true that this is this is
[1:17:18] what I really am I'm just not worth
[1:17:21] anything and then something on the
[1:17:24] inside of of them
[1:17:27] said
[1:17:28] no I am worth
[1:17:33] something I am valuable amen and when
[1:17:37] that dirt hit his back that old donkey
[1:17:40] just brushed his back like this and the
[1:17:43] dirt fell out and he stepped right up a
[1:17:45] little
[1:17:46] higher and that just kept happened until
[1:17:49] he reached to the very top and was able
[1:17:53] to walk over and get back on the
[1:17:56] ground now I'll tell you that's the way
[1:17:58] that we need to believe who we
[1:18:01] are it don't matter what Satan tells us
[1:18:04] amen look Satan comes to church too amen
[1:18:07] he's trying to keep you from believing
[1:18:10] the word of God for your life and sure
[1:18:12] your flesh is just like my flesh that
[1:18:15] doesn't want to Humble itself and and to
[1:18:18] follow the word that's a true statement
[1:18:21] but you know we're not here to build our
[1:18:23] flesh amen we're here because we're Sons
[1:18:27] and Daughters of God we're Priceless in
[1:18:29] the sight of God and we're going to be
[1:18:32] Overcomers whatever's thrown at
[1:18:34] us that's
[1:18:37] right I'm sure you've heard the the
[1:18:39] story about the slave that came to
[1:18:44] America and uh he was he was different
[1:18:49] than all the other
[1:18:50] slaves and there was actually other
[1:18:53] slave owners that envied not having this
[1:18:57] guy this
[1:18:59] man this
[1:19:02] slave and and so they they would go to
[1:19:05] the the owner of the slave and they said
[1:19:08] we would like to buy this slave from you
[1:19:11] we'll give you double what you paid for
[1:19:14] him and the slave owner would tell him
[1:19:17] he's not for sale that's right he's not
[1:19:19] for sale we we purchased them he's here
[1:19:22] he's staying with us
[1:19:25] and uh and and so they began to ask
[1:19:28] questions because this man when he was
[1:19:30] out on the field he worked like nobody
[1:19:33] else right you know the Bible talks
[1:19:36] about working with eye service in other
[1:19:38] words you work as long as the boss is
[1:19:40] look at but when the boss ain't looking
[1:19:42] then it doesn't
[1:19:43] matter but that slave wasn't like
[1:19:46] this this slave he he always carried
[1:19:51] himself in such a
[1:19:53] way that
[1:19:56] he didn't let things get him
[1:19:58] down he kept on
[1:20:01] working at all
[1:20:04] cost and he worked harder than the
[1:20:06] others and so they asked him why is he
[1:20:09] like this do you feed them something
[1:20:11] different do you give them more breaks
[1:20:14] do you give them easier jobs do you give
[1:20:16] them benefits after work and no no no
[1:20:19] none of that but I'll tell you I what I
[1:20:23] was wondering the same thing when we
[1:20:25] were first learning about it and we
[1:20:27] learned that where he comes from he is
[1:20:31] his dad his father is a king over in the
[1:20:34] land that he comes from
[1:20:36] am and they're taught to conduct
[1:20:40] themselves just like a son of a king
[1:20:45] amen and so when he came here he didn't
[1:20:48] say well things are
[1:20:50] different I guess it's hopeless now I'm
[1:20:52] in a different situation there's no way
[1:20:55] no he knew who he was amen and he
[1:20:59] conducted
[1:21:00] himself like a son of a king amen amen
[1:21:04] now believe we that are Priceless no
[1:21:07] matter what we're going through we ought
[1:21:09] to La act like we're Children of the
[1:21:11] king amen amen we hold our value and if
[1:21:16] you keep your value let me just say this
[1:21:19] you'll keep living for others
[1:21:22] right but if you don't keep your value
[1:21:25] all of a sudden you'll start living for
[1:21:26] yourself
[1:21:28] right eternal life is living for others
[1:21:32] eternal life is not doing things for
[1:21:36] others it's not doing things for people
[1:21:39] right it's actually living for
[1:21:42] somebody's Soul am to get either
[1:21:46] somebody to Christ or to get somebody
[1:21:49] closer to Christ amen that's what
[1:21:51] eternal life is because you're you're
[1:21:54] already
[1:21:56] Priceless you already got everything you
[1:21:58] want because you got Christ you got joy
[1:22:01] you got peace you got everything you
[1:22:03] could possibly want there is nothing
[1:22:04] more that you want if you never get
[1:22:06] another thing you're still living for
[1:22:08] others
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:09] amen Deuteronomy 7:6 says for thou art a
[1:22:14] holy people unto the Lord thy God the
[1:22:16] Lord thy God have chosen thee to be a
[1:22:19] special people unto himself above all
[1:22:22] the people that are upon the face of the
[1:22:25] earth now that's pretty
[1:22:27] special the Lord did not set his love
[1:22:30] upon you nor choose you because you were
[1:22:32] more in number than uh any of the people
[1:22:35] but ye were fewest of all
[1:22:37] people but because the Lord loved
[1:22:41] you we just can't
[1:22:44] even I cannot fathom that love I can't
[1:22:49] wrap my head around it I it's it's like
[1:22:51] Priceless to me just like 10,000 worlds
[1:22:55] I can't understand the value of my soul
[1:22:59] converted it's going to take eternity to
[1:23:02] keep unfolding for me to understand amen
[1:23:05] Jeremiah 31:3 I want you to write this
[1:23:08] down Jeremiah 31:3 the Lord have
[1:23:10] appeared of old unto me saying yay I
[1:23:14] have loved thee with an Everlasting Love
[1:23:19] Therefore with loving kindness have I
[1:23:21] drawn thee now catch this
[1:23:25] Everlasting Love Priceless we hold our
[1:23:30] value we hold our value God is not
[1:23:34] exchanging his love he's not withdrawing
[1:23:37] his love his loving kindness draws us to
[1:23:41] him it is the goodness of God that leads
[1:23:44] man to repentance amen we're
[1:23:49] Priceless I remember telling my son 30
[1:23:52] years
[1:23:53] ago when he was just a boy every night
[1:23:57] before he'd go to bed when I tuck him in
[1:23:59] I'd say I love you bigger than this
[1:24:01] whole
[1:24:03] world He's 33 years old now but I
[1:24:07] haven't stopped telling him amen I tell

[1:29:44] you how valuable you are
[1:29:47] am you can take it you can take the
[1:29:51] furnace Isaiah 43 this is going going to
[1:29:55] be one of our last scriptures
[1:29:58] here Isaiah 43:1 but now thus sayith the
[1:30:02] Lord the that created thee oh
[1:30:07] Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel
[1:30:10] fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have
[1:30:12] called thee by thy name and thou art
[1:30:14] mine when thou passest through the water
[1:30:17] I will be with thee through the rivers
[1:30:19] they shall not overflow thee when thou
[1:30:21] walkest through the fire Thou shalt not
[1:30:24] burn neither shall the flame Kindle
[1:30:28] under upon thee for I am the Lord thy
[1:30:31] God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I
[1:30:34] gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and
[1:30:38] siba for thee since thou was precious in
[1:30:43] my sight thou has been honorable I have
[1:30:48] love thee therefore will I give men for
[1:30:52] thee
[1:30:54] and people for thy life amen isn't that
[1:30:59] powerful so here's another version of
[1:31:01] that verse says you are Priceless to
[1:31:05] me I have loved you and I honor
[1:31:09] you so I will trade other people for
[1:31:13] you and I will give up other nations to
[1:31:16] save your
[1:31:18] lives we are Priceless amen we are
[1:31:22] absolutely priceless in the sight of
[1:31:26] God know ye not that your body is the
[1:31:30] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:31:33] which
[1:31:34] ye have of God and you are not your own
[1:31:38] you are bought with a
[1:31:42] price therefore glorify God in your body
[1:31:46] and your spirit which are
[1:31:50] God's we
[1:31:52] cannot truly
[1:31:55] conceive the value of how much we we're
[1:31:59] worth but I'll say it like this it's
[1:32:01] beyond our comprehension
[1:32:05] amen one thing we can say that we are
[1:32:09] truly Priceless amen and we hold our
[1:32:14] value God is going to see us
[1:32:17] through and we're going to be just like
[1:32:20] him when he returns God values us as
[1:32:24] much as himself I'll say that just pray
[1:32:27] for that
[1:32:28] Revelation because if you get a true
[1:32:30] revelation of that you're you're not
[1:32:32] going to be discouraged amen amen you
[1:32:36] need something to hold you amen amen one
[1:32:41] day a young
[1:32:43] boy asked his father what the value of
[1:32:47] his life
[1:32:49] was instead of answering the father told
[1:32:52] him he just just picked up a rock he
[1:32:54] said take this rock and go to the market
[1:32:58] and if anybody asks you the price of of
[1:33:02] of the rock uh you just hold up two
[1:33:05] fingers but don't say a thing so he went
[1:33:09] to the market with this rock and uh some
[1:33:13] lady
[1:33:14] said how much is that that rock I I
[1:33:17] would like to buy that rock I'd like to
[1:33:19] put it in my garden and the the little
[1:33:22] boy just did what his dad said he just
[1:33:24] raised two
[1:33:25] fingers he said $2 I'll take it I'll

[1:33:36] $2 for this stone that you this rock
[1:33:39] that you just picked
[1:33:41] up the father said now I want you to

[1:33:58] you just hold up two fingers but don't
[1:34:00] say a
[1:34:01] thing and so he goes to the museum and
[1:34:04] he walks in there and he's just staying
[1:34:05] there and he waits for the owner to come
[1:34:07] and he says wow look at that that that
[1:34:11] that rock it is it is it looks so
[1:34:14] valuable uh h i I I'll I want to buy

[1:34:29] it the boy just takes the Rock and he
[1:34:33] leaves he goes home and he tells his dad
