[36:34] need this morning amen if you have your
[36:37] Bibles let's open our scriptures to
[36:39] Daniel
[36:41] 11:32 it's an honor to be back again uh
[36:44] today um I appreciate the the
[36:47] opportunity by our pastor to be
[36:49] ministering I pray something can be said
[36:52] today to be a to be a blessing and and a
[36:55] help in in some way uh my my family
[36:58] ain't with me today and I I apologize we
[37:00] were we were at our my uncle Jonathan's
[37:03] meetings there in Ohio there in Lima
[37:05] this week so it's a busy weekend and so
[37:08] we drove I drove up this morning from
[37:09] Ohio but Lord willing hopefully next
[37:12] time if it if it works out they they can
[37:14] come with me and get to meet the meet
[37:16] y'all and so um but but Daniel 11:32 the
[37:21] Bible would say and such do wickedly
[37:23] against the Covenant shall he corrupt by
[37:26] flatteries but the people that do know
[37:28] their God shall be strong and do
[37:31] exploits what a promise amen can we bow
[37:34] our heads this morning dear gracious
[37:36] Heavenly Father Lord how we love you
[37:39] Lord and and we're grateful father for
[37:41] this this opportunity to come into your
[37:43] house Lord and for just having a place
[37:45] that we can come to and worship Lord
[37:47] with a freedom and a liberty Lord today
[37:50] God we have needs God be maybe there's
[37:53] afflictions in the body Lord whatever it
[37:55] is Father only you can meet the these
[37:57] needs and these desires father Lord I
[38:00] ask that you would speak this morning
[38:01] Lord speak to these lips of clay father
[38:04] Lord I ask that you would just discern
[38:06] the Heart by Your Word father and just
[38:08] and just meet the need and encourage
[38:10] father strengthen and uplift today
[38:12] Father Lord we we commit the service
[38:15] into your hands I I Lay My Gift into
[38:17] your hands Lord and ask that you would
[38:19] just move today we ask these things in
[38:21] your precious name amen you may be
[38:24] seated this morning and if I had a a
[38:27] simple subject it would be the people
[38:29] that know their God and brother brandom
[38:32] he would place this scripture at the end
[38:34] time and he he would say this here that
[38:37] uh and Daniel said in the day in that
[38:39] day they run run to and fro and
[38:42] knowledge shall increase and he said the
[38:44] wise shall know their God in that day
[38:46] and shall do great exploits in that day
[38:49] but the wicked will not know the god of
[38:51] Heaven they know him in a form and in a
[38:55] ritual so I believe that knowing God is
[38:58] more than just a form more than just a
[39:00] ritual but I believe that it's an
[39:02] experience that you can that you can
[39:04] come and contact with the supernatural
[39:07] being and see that there's a living
[39:09] presence Among Us not just an idea not
[39:12] just an opinion but there's something
[39:14] living right Among Us and and brother
[39:17] Brandon would tell us that the Holy
[39:19] Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years but
[39:22] is to be loosed by the by an evening
[39:24] time message he would say the Holy Ghost
[39:26] has been B by these denominational
[39:28] Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to
[39:31] be loosed in the evening time by the
[39:34] evening time message the Holy Spirit
[39:36] back in the church again Christ himself
[39:40] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[39:43] time he promised it he said it and he
[39:46] promised it so the veil that has hid God
[39:48] and has kept him from the people I
[39:51] believe has been loosed in this
[39:53] generation by a message that there can
[39:55] be a people that know him more than just
[39:58] an idea or or just coming to church and
[40:01] and singing songs and raising our hands
[40:03] and and that's wonderful and things but
[40:05] I want to know my God I want to
[40:07] experience him I want to feel him in the
[40:10] hard times in the tough times when I go
[40:12] through trials when I go through
[40:14] circumstances I want more than just a
[40:17] feeling I want something real and
[40:19] brother Brandon would saying I think
[40:21] today we've had much fine preaching many
[40:24] fine ministers able ministers that has
[40:26] brought us the word your pastors and
[40:29] evangelists and so forth that comes
[40:31] through the city but I think the main
[40:33] thing that I'm trying to bring to you is
[40:36] the reality of the presence of Christ
[40:39] that you might see him and know that
[40:42] it's him by his identified promise for
[40:45] today so he says what I'm trying to do
[40:49] is to bring to you the realities of the
[40:52] presence of Jesus Christ and so reality
[40:55] is something that you can see something
[40:58] that you can feel something that that
[41:00] it's tangible it's God with flesh on it
[41:03] as brother Brandon would put it it's
[41:05] something that you can grab a hold of
[41:07] and say I've got it in the hardest time
[41:09] in the deepest time I got it and brother
[41:12] Brandon would say that you might see him
[41:14] and know that it is him so we have to we
[41:17] had to have something identify what
[41:20] Jesus really is because we're living in
[41:22] America where there's churches on every
[41:24] corner almost you know and everybody is
[41:27] claiming to have Christ everybody has
[41:29] the same Bible everybody's claiming to
[41:31] have the Holy Ghost in their church but
[41:34] who is the right one What doctrine is
[41:36] the right Doctrine what church has the
[41:38] truth and brother Brandon he lets us
[41:40] know the secret that you might see him
[41:43] and know that it is him by his
[41:45] identified promise for today and so it's
[41:49] not that it's our pastor getting up and
[41:51] saying this is truth we're following it
[41:54] it was thus saith the Lord and a pillar
[41:56] of Fire coming and vindicating it and
[41:59] letting you know that I am here
[42:02] revealing my presence to you that you
[42:05] can know me by the power of the
[42:07] Resurrection not just hoping that you
[42:10] know me but there's an identification in
[42:13] this day that you can take back the
[42:15] scripture and say right here it's
[42:17] prophesied in these days that there
[42:20] would be a prophet Malachi 4 that return
[42:22] my heart back to the back to the faith
[42:25] of the fathers and so once we see
[42:28] prophecy in this generation fulfilling
[42:31] what was in the book then we can
[42:33] understand that this is Jesus Christ oh
[42:36] this ain't just an idea not just an
[42:38] opinion but here is the Revelation the
[42:41] reality of the presence of Jesus then we
[42:44] can know him you know brother Brandon
[42:46] would tell the story of the little boy
[42:48] that wanted to see wanted to see God y
[42:50] y'all remember the story and he would
[42:52] come up to his mom and would say mom can
[42:54] anybody see God and she would say no sir
[42:57] or she would say go ask the Sunday
[42:59] school teacher and he would go up to the
[43:01] Sunday school teacher and would say
[43:02] teacher can anybody see God and she
[43:05] would say no son nobody can see God and
[43:08] live this boy boy was discouraged and
[43:10] heartbroken why serve a God that you
[43:13] can't see then he would go up to the to
[43:15] the preacher and would say preacher can
[43:18] anybody see God and he would say no son
[43:20] nobody can see God and live and this boy
[43:23] was discouraged he was walking down this
[43:25] Trail by this Lake and brother Brandon
[43:28] would tell us that there was an old
[43:29] fisherman that was sitting in a boat and
[43:32] this boy would run into the boat jump on
[43:34] his lap and this man was looking up at a
[43:36] rainbow and had tears coming down his
[43:39] face and he would say Sir can anybody
[43:42] see God and he would say son all I have
[43:44] seen is God for the past 35 years this
[43:48] man was not walking by natural sight but
[43:51] was walking by a revelation that the
[43:53] presence of Jesus Christ is here on
[43:56] Earth and I can see him and what is so
[43:58] incredible is here the preacher may have
[44:01] been looking at the same rainbow the
[44:03] Sunday school teacher was looking at the
[44:05] same rainbow mama was looking at the
[44:07] same rainbow and all she seen maybe was
[44:10] clouds all they seen was colors but this
[44:13] man with Revelation could look at a
[44:16] rainbow and know that this is Jesus
[44:18] Christ This Is God and you see once you
[44:21] get a revelation that Jesus is upon the
[44:24] Earth you can look at the same things
[44:27] that the world looks at but it reveals
[44:29] to you that it's Jesus Christ oh you can
[44:32] go through the trials and that trial
[44:35] reveals to you that he is with me oh you
[44:38] see you would never know that God could
[44:39] heal if you never was sick and it's the
[44:42] same sickness that discourages the
[44:44] unbeliever that brings the faith in your
[44:47] life knowing that he's Jehovah Gyra he's
[44:50] Jehovah Rafa he is all of these
[44:52] Redemptive names to me you see everybody
[44:56] can look at the same things and brother
[44:58] Brandon would say what do you see when
[45:00] you look you see cuz you can look at
[45:03] something but what are you seeing what
[45:05] are you beholding what are you
[45:07] understanding you see and brother
[45:09] Brandon would tell us that he would
[45:11] preach the message called looking to the
[45:13] Unseen looking under Jesus and brother
[45:15] Brandon was say another the people look
[45:17] at the word literally and that's the way
[45:19] you are supposed to look but it declares
[45:22] itself both both literally and
[45:24] spiritually the spirit makes the to live
[45:27] to the promise in other words it's a
[45:30] seed the spirit gives it life and and it
[45:34] G like the rain gives the gives to the
[45:37] seed that is buried in the ground it
[45:39] breaks forth life and he says when you
[45:41] look at Jesus the promised word of the
[45:44] hour then it will be revealed to you if
[45:47] you look at him you'll see that he's the
[45:50] same yesterday today and forever the
[45:53] same Christ and so we're not just
[45:55] looking up the word now naturally but we
[45:57] want to see it spiritually which is
[46:00] revelation you see brother Brandon would
[46:02] say he would tell us that there that
[46:04] there is there's two men in us he said
[46:06] there's the inward man which is the soul
[46:08] and he says then there's the outward man
[46:10] which is your eyes and he says your eyes
[46:13] is dictated by your flesh and so if
[46:15] you're going through circumstances and
[46:17] you're looking through your natural eyes
[46:20] and you look at the chaos you look at
[46:21] the hard times and if you're looking
[46:23] through those eyes instead of the eyes
[46:26] of faith it's going to bring you down
[46:29] right it's going if you're constantly
[46:30] looking at the negative it's going to
[46:32] discourage you if you're constantly
[46:34] looking up the chaos it's going to
[46:36] discourage you but if you look by faith
[46:39] you can look up the chaos and see even
[46:42] though I'm walking through the valley of
[46:44] the shadow of death I fear no evil so it
[46:47] depends on how you are looking when you
[46:50] look oh Hallelujah cuz if you look at
[46:53] naturalize at this a message we can be
[46:56] deep to right cuz there's websites
[46:59] there's critics there's naysayers that
[47:01] are saying all of these things against
[47:03] the message so if we look through
[47:05] naturalize sometimes it can be
[47:07] believable right if we if we're looking
[47:10] for faults and looking for mistakes
[47:12] brother the Brandon would tell us if you
[47:14] come to church expecting to criticize he
[47:17] says don't worry the devil will give you
[47:20] plenty to criticize but he says if
[47:22] you're coming expecting to see God move
[47:25] don't worry you're going to seek him so
[47:28] if you look at the message to criticize
[47:30] it don't worry the devil is going to
[47:33] give you something to criticize but I
[47:35] say I'm not looking to criticize I'm
[47:37] looking through eyes of faith that I can
[47:39] see the realities of the presence of
[47:43] Jesus Christ oh I believe that's your
[47:45] desire this morning I want to see the
[47:48] realities of Jesus Christ oh it's the
[47:51] realities that are going to save our
[47:53] children oh thank you brother it's the
[47:55] realities that is going to get get us in
[47:57] a Rapture that that brother Brandon was
[47:59] saying we are told that we have an
[48:01] outward man and an inward man the
[48:03] outward man looks by his eyes and the
[48:06] inward man walks by faith so we are led
[48:08] by one of these two persons outside the
[48:12] outward man the inward man is God you
[48:15] see we do not see with their eyes though
[48:17] many times we thought we see with their
[48:20] eyes we only look with their eyes but we
[48:22] see with our hearts ain't that
[48:25] incredible we look with our eyes but we
[48:28] see with our heart and we see that
[48:31] seeing is to understand cuz it was Jesus
[48:33] that were look to Nicodemus I believe
[48:35] and would say list a man is born again
[48:37] he cannot see the kingdom of God and
[48:40] brother Brandon would say that see means
[48:42] to understand and so we can see
[48:45] scripture but I don't want to just see
[48:47] it I want to understand it you see
[48:49] because understanding brings a
[48:51] revelation that goes beyond what you see
[48:54] you remember whenever it was Elisha and
[48:56] servant Gesa I believe that was there
[48:59] and they were surrounded by the Syrian
[49:01] Army you remember the story and the
[49:03] Bible would tell us that the boy would
[49:05] look out and would see that they were
[49:07] surrounded by the armies and would run
[49:09] back to Elisha and when they were
[49:11] surrounded by the Army what are we going
[49:13] to do and Elisha will look at him and
[49:16] would say there's more with us than they
[49:18] are with them so here stood the boy
[49:21] looking naturally could you imagine
[49:23] being this young boy could you imagine
[49:25] looking out of the tent and saying man
[49:27] all it is is me I'm a young boy and an
[49:29] old man and there's trained men out
[49:31] there with with swords with Spears with
[49:34] armor there's no way we're going to make
[49:36] it out alive and what would the prophet
[49:38] say open this Poor Boy's eyes his eyes
[49:42] was already open oh I'm preaching now
[49:45] his eyes were already open but his faith
[49:47] was blocked off by what he was seeing
[49:50] naturally and I say we need to stop
[49:53] walking by natural sight and walk by
[49:56] faith
[49:57] that looks beyond the condition that
[49:59] looks beyond what we're going through to
[50:02] a promise that no matter what I go
[50:05] through I'm with you every step of the
[50:07] way oh Hallelujah so what would happen
[50:10] when this boy's eyes would be open he
[50:13] would look that there was Chariots of
[50:14] Fire there was angels that were
[50:16] surrounding him no matter the condition
[50:19] that he was in when he changed his Focus
[50:22] from naturally to spiritually he would
[50:25] see into an unseen realm that there were
[50:28] angels with me oh and I don't believe
[50:30] it's by coincidence that you are still
[50:33] here with your right mind that you're
[50:35] not in prison that you're not in a jail
[50:37] cell somewhere that you're not in a
[50:39] grave somewhere it was the Unseen World
[50:42] it was angels that was guiding you every
[50:45] step of the way oh do you believe that
[50:47] this
[50:48] morning you remember it was Jesus the
[50:51] Bible would tell us that it was after
[50:53] that he was tempted in the wilderness
[50:55] for 40 days that the Bible say says once
[50:57] the devil left him then there came
[50:59] ministering Angels oh there came
[51:02] ministering Angels you know but the
[51:04] Bible would tell us that whenever Jesus
[51:06] was upon the cross for the Brandon would
[51:08] say all he had to do was move his hand a
[51:11] certain way and there would be Legion
[51:13] Legions of angels that would bring him
[51:15] off the cross y remember him saying that
[51:17] so it was Angels even though he was at
[51:20] his weakest moment there was Angels oh
[51:23] and even though when he felt like he was
[51:25] by himself the angels of God were still
[51:28] there the Bible would say that the uh it
[51:31] would talk they would talk about uh
[51:33] Elijah whenever he got tired remember
[51:35] that and brother Brandon would dramatize
[51:37] it and would say that God would look
[51:40] down and would say my servant Elijah is
[51:42] tired I need the angels I need an angel
[51:45] with the softest hand to go down and
[51:47] massage his shoulders to stroke his brow
[51:50] even though Elijah was tired he was
[51:52] running for his life there was an unseen
[51:55] realm that he could not see naturally
[51:58] that there was a ministering Angel oh
[52:01] Hallelujah you may feel tired this
[52:03] morning you may feel like you you can't
[52:05] take another step but in the Unseen
[52:07] realm there's ministering angels that is
[52:10] guiding you walking with you keeping you
[52:13] every step of the way oh Hallelujah we
[52:17] might not see them naturally but if you
[52:19] look through the eyes of Faith you will
[52:21] see that there are angels God is walking
[52:24] with us every step of the way brother
[52:26] brand going say this when God made man
[52:29] he made him first for he for he made
[52:31] this little this little certain
[52:33] compartment in man for his own Throne
[52:36] his control tower God wants to lead man
[52:39] but man wants to lead himself therefore
[52:42] the war is constantly the man wants to
[52:45] go after what he sees with his eyes that
[52:48] is where he is deceived he says that's
[52:51] where Satan deceived Eve was by what she
[52:53] could
[52:54] see the fruit was more Pleasant to the
[52:57] eye but it was death to the soul he says
[53:00] so it is tonight God wants to lead man
[53:03] so he made himself a little control
[53:06] tower in the midst of his heart so that
[53:09] man would be led by the spirit of God
[53:11] getting off on his own leading is what
[53:14] separated him from his Fellowship
[53:16] looking at what he could see with his
[53:19] eyes ain't that incredible but the
[53:21] brandom is saying God wants to lead man
[53:24] but there's a war between man and God
[53:26] because man is trying to lead himself by
[53:29] what he sees oh and it's hard sometimes
[53:32] I'm sure the elders can witness it that
[53:34] it's hard sometimes you've been through
[53:36] some hard times you've been through some
[53:38] circumstances and it's easy to walk by
[53:41] walk by faith or walk by sight instead
[53:43] of by faith and brother brandom is
[53:45] saying that is what deceives man is
[53:47] walking by your sight oh my and I say
[53:51] let's change our Focus let's change our
[53:53] eyesight cuz brother the Brandon would
[53:55] say that it's only only a special class
[53:57] of people that can know God only a
[54:00] special class of people and he says it's
[54:02] because he would say what would identify
[54:04] him would be identification of the
[54:07] scripture that says he would be and so
[54:10] it's somebody that is not looking
[54:12] naturally but is looking through eyes of
[54:15] faith that can see him he would say you
[54:17] would recall that I mentioned at the
[54:20] beginning of this message that this book
[54:22] we are studying is the actual revelation
[54:25] of Jesus himself in the church and his
[54:29] work in the future ages then I mentioned
[54:31] that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[54:34] Revelation or we fail to get it bringing
[54:37] these two thoughts together that you
[54:39] will see it it won't take just ordinary
[54:42] study and thinking to make this book
[54:44] real it's going to take the operation of
[54:48] the Holy Ghost that means this book
[54:51] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[54:53] special class of people it will take one
[54:56] with prophetic Insight what is that
[54:59] prophetic Insight it's the it's the
[55:01] inward man looking by faith at the word
[55:04] of God and seeing that this is Jesus
[55:07] Christ being revealed he said it's going
[55:10] to take more than just comparing verse
[55:12] with verse you know why because brother
[55:14] Brandon would say there's so many people
[55:16] with different opinions of who Christ is
[55:19] he would say you be surprised to know
[55:21] all of the opinions of who who they
[55:23] think Christ is he says some of them
[55:26] look looked at Jesus and says he's a
[55:28] wonderful teacher he says some looked at
[55:30] him and said he was a wonderful scholar
[55:32] and a philosopher and he says certainly
[55:35] he was those things but he was a teacher
[55:38] plus Oh I thought that was so powerful
[55:41] he says he was that what the what their
[55:43] natural eyes were looking at he was that
[55:46] but he was more than that you see he
[55:49] would say this should be surprised to
[55:50] know what some of their opinions are
[55:52] some of them thinks he was just a
[55:54] wonderful teacher well he was was there
[55:56] that's just exactly many thingss he was
[55:58] a great philosopher which he was there
[56:01] certainly he was some of them thinks he
[56:03] was a good man he was but he was more
[56:06] than that he was all of that plus some
[56:09] of them think he was a prophet he was a
[56:11] prophet but he was more than a prophet
[56:14] he was what a prophet was plus and so if
[56:17] you if you've got the ability to walk by
[56:20] faith you are this prophetic people that
[56:23] has prophetic Insight looking at Jesus
[56:25] today
[56:27] ain't that incredible that not anybody
[56:28] can look at him the right way but the
[56:31] predestinated so if you've got a desire
[56:33] on the inside and you're walking by
[56:36] faith you that you should be you you
[56:38] have a right to Rejoice because you're
[56:41] not anybody has the leading no the Bible
[56:43] would say that uh nobody comes to the
[56:46] father unless the father draws him the
[56:48] word draw is an inward pulling so nobody
[56:51] can come unless there's an inward pull
[56:54] to his bleeding side so if there's an
[56:57] inward pull you should have you have a
[56:59] right to praise God cuz not anybody is
[57:02] being pulled the Bible would say if I be
[57:05] lifted up I will draw all men unto me
[57:08] and so it is the predestinated that is
[57:10] looking what has been lifted up in this
[57:13] generation and inwardly they're being
[57:15] pulled oh Hallelujah that they can see
[57:19] the realities of Jesus Christ oh
[57:23] hallelujah it's not you doing it you're
[57:25] just being pulled inward by
[57:27] predestination and you're just walking
[57:29] by faith you're walking by faith every
[57:31] step of the way oh Hallelujah but it's a
[57:34] special class of people that can
[57:36] identify him by his promised word today
[57:40] not by what not by what uh brother
[57:42] brandham was wearing not what the word
[57:44] was wearing in the flesh of brother
[57:46] brandom but you can look past the Flesh
[57:49] and see it was more than a prophet in
[57:50] this generation it was brother Brandon
[57:53] pointing to something oh Hallelujah you
[57:56] see if I say look look at this TV screen
[57:59] right there your attention is first upon
[58:01] me right then it goes from me to what
[58:04] I'm pointing to right cuz now I I'm the
[58:07] attraction I say look but then the
[58:09] attraction goes from me to what I'm
[58:11] pointing at and brother Brandon would
[58:13] say the attraction was John the Baptist
[58:16] he was the attraction but whenever Jesus
[58:19] came he says the attraction went from
[58:21] the prophet to the prophecy so when
[58:25] brother random came here was the
[58:27] attraction the first two PS were were
[58:30] the the the visions and the the healing
[58:32] on the hand the vibrations but the third
[58:34] pole was the opening of the word
[58:37] pointing you to Jesus Christ the
[58:40] realities of his presence is upon the
[58:43] Earth today look at him oh seek Him by
[58:47] faith that he is here today by his
[58:50] revealed word of the hour oh Hallelujah
[58:54] you got to look past the flesh and see
[58:57] that Jesus was here today you remember
[58:59] when Nathaniel met Jesus it wasn't what
[59:02] Jesus was wearing that revealed to
[59:05] Nathaniel that he was the Christ it was
[59:07] whenever he discerned the heart you
[59:09] remember it was Philip that would run to
[59:11] Nathaniel and would say here here's a
[59:13] man here this is the Messiah and I could
[59:16] just and brother Brandon would sort of
[59:18] dramatize it that he might have been
[59:20] critical are you sure that this is the
[59:23] Messiah and when he ran up to Jesus
[59:25] Jesus looked at him and said behold an
[59:28] Israelite with no gal and here stood
[59:30] Nathaniel and thought how do you know me
[59:33] and he says whenever you was under the
[59:35] under the fig tree before Philip called
[59:38] Thee I saw you and so it wasn't the
[59:41] Garment that what Jesus was wearing that
[59:44] revealed it to Nathaniel it was prophecy
[59:47] being fulfilled oh Hallelujah so don't
[59:50] matter what preacher is is preaching
[59:52] behind this pull pit if it's the word
[59:55] coming across it is Jesus Christ to you
[59:59] oh you see what if Nathaniel would have
[1:00:01] looked at Jesus and says now you're not
[1:00:03] wearing the right clothes you should be
[1:00:05] wearing this type of garment your
[1:00:07] sandals should be this type of way your
[1:00:09] hair should be this type of weight if he
[1:00:11] was looking up the Garment he would have
[1:00:13] failed to see that this was scripture
[1:00:16] being fulfilled I hope this is okay this
[1:00:18] morning and so many times we look at the
[1:00:21] gift that is behind the pull pit and we
[1:00:23] think oh it's just the pastor we're not
[1:00:25] going to see God move it's just the
[1:00:27] Evangelist we're not going to see God
[1:00:28] move oh it's just this one we're not
[1:00:30] going to see God move you got to look
[1:00:32] beyond the flesh look beyond the Garment
[1:00:36] that is preaching and see that it's a
[1:00:38] message that is being lifted up that
[1:00:41] will inwardly draw you oh Hallelujah
[1:00:45] stop looking at the Garment and look at
[1:00:47] the word brother Brandon would say but
[1:00:49] what would identify him would be the
[1:00:52] identification that the scripture says
[1:00:54] that he would be
[1:00:56] he would say that's how we have to
[1:00:58] identify him and that's the way he was
[1:01:00] identified then because he wasn't any
[1:01:03] spectacular man in a certain array of
[1:01:05] dress he had no organization that he
[1:01:08] boasted of he had no credentials from
[1:01:10] any certain Fellowship that he could say
[1:01:13] I belong to the biggest he had only the
[1:01:15] works of God that was proven and spoken
[1:01:18] of that would identify him that was his
[1:01:22] credentials ain't that powerful he says
[1:01:24] his credentials wasn't n what he was
[1:01:27] wearing his credentials was what the
[1:01:29] word spoke of him and he was fulfilling
[1:01:32] the word that's what his credentials
[1:01:34] were and I say we got the credentials in
[1:01:37] this generation we had a Prophet come
[1:01:40] with Vindication after Vindication the
[1:01:42] Messiah sign letting you know that Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ is upon Earth again not not the
[1:01:48] man William Brandon I don't believe in
[1:01:50] deifying the man but I do believe he was
[1:01:53] pointing to something oh he was the John
[1:01:55] the Baptist pointing that here comes the
[1:01:58] Messiah here he comes oh what would
[1:02:01] brother brandom say that that the
[1:02:03] purpose of his ministry is to declare to
[1:02:06] you that he is here that he is here not
[1:02:10] a million miles away but he is here and
[1:02:13] you can experience the realities of it
[1:02:16] but you see once you identify what where
[1:02:19] he is at today that produces such a
[1:02:21] faith that you know that you're right
[1:02:24] right how many's ever been in in an AR
[1:02:25] argument before and you just know that
[1:02:27] you're right you know that you're right
[1:02:30] but then the other person pulls out
[1:02:31] their phone and Googles it and you're
[1:02:32] wrong how many's ever been there before
[1:02:35] you lose all your confidence cuz you
[1:02:37] just thought that you was right and
[1:02:39] that's the way it is with this message
[1:02:41] the devil can come and put questions in
[1:02:43] Your Mind questions in your mind but if
[1:02:45] you've never seen it Vindicated then
[1:02:48] you're not going to know if it's true or
[1:02:49] not oh come on now but once you identify
[1:02:53] it that this is scripture this ain't a
[1:02:55] man's message it's scripture then you
[1:02:58] can go toe to- Toe with the devil and
[1:03:00] say oh I don't care what you say I don't
[1:03:03] care what the critic say I don't care
[1:03:05] what the naysayers say I have identified
[1:03:07] by scripture and I can see that it is
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ there's a confidence when
[1:03:13] you know that you are right brother
[1:03:15] brand I'm going talk about Dave and I
[1:03:17] say all he had was a little piece of
[1:03:19] leather a little sheep skin and some
[1:03:21] sticks and he said but it was Revelation
[1:03:23] that he had and he says it was revealed
[1:03:25] guilty him and he says God took me out
[1:03:28] of the Paw of the lion out of the Paw of
[1:03:30] the bear and he can take me out of this
[1:03:32] uncircumcised Philistine hand he says it
[1:03:35] was revealed to him and what was so
[1:03:37] incredible I think about it is brother
[1:03:39] Brandon would say that Saul was Head and
[1:03:41] Shoulders above above all the rest of
[1:03:44] the army but it wasn't revealed to him
[1:03:47] ain't that incredible the power of
[1:03:49] Revelation here stood Saul through
[1:03:51] naturalize was more capable of
[1:03:54] fulfilling the promise more capable of
[1:03:57] destroying the Philistine but since it
[1:03:59] wasn't revealed to him he could not do
[1:04:01] it oh that's the power Revelation you
[1:04:04] got to know that this message is my
[1:04:07] message oh come on now you see we can
[1:04:10] look at that in a negative way but we
[1:04:12] can also look at it in the positive here
[1:04:15] stood a man that was Head and Shoulders
[1:04:17] that should be able to fulfill the word
[1:04:20] but then also was a little boy that
[1:04:22] naturally was not able right you look at
[1:04:25] David and think man there's no way this
[1:04:26] guy can bring down the Philistine
[1:04:28] there's no way but we can also take
[1:04:30] encouragement from that we can look at
[1:04:32] ourselves many times and see I'm just a
[1:04:35] mama oh I'm just a daddy I'm just
[1:04:37] somebody that goes to work I'm just a
[1:04:39] teenager and we think that we're not
[1:04:41] able to fulfill the promise of the hour
[1:04:44] but look at David if it can be revealed
[1:04:47] to David that God can bring him through
[1:04:49] you can get that same Revelation that I
[1:04:52] can be the embodiment of deity in this
[1:04:55] gener ation bringing forth the promise
[1:04:57] you know brother Brandon would say that
[1:04:59] that said brother Brandon would say that
[1:05:01] he would talk about the Tabernacle and
[1:05:03] would say behind those Badger skins was
[1:05:06] the shik glory he says it was once
[1:05:08] Badgers behind those skins and then he
[1:05:11] would say now it's no longer badgers or
[1:05:13] animals but now it's the housing place
[1:05:16] for the shik glory and he says so can
[1:05:19] your skins be changed into the housing
[1:05:22] place for the Shak glory in other words
[1:05:25] de deity is no longer just behind the
[1:05:27] veil deity is no longer just in a
[1:05:30] prophet but deity can be put into your
[1:05:34] skins oh Hallelujah it can be a young
[1:05:37] boy a mama or a daddy a pastor that is
[1:05:40] no longer just me walking by natural
[1:05:43] sight but it's deity on the inside
[1:05:46] leading me every step of the way we know
[1:05:49] our God we know our God in the hard
[1:05:52] times we know him in the good times we
[1:05:54] know him
[1:05:56] oh it's Revelation brother brandham says
[1:05:59] talking about David in that same quote
[1:06:01] he says his brothers were more able to
[1:06:03] do it Saul Head and Shoulders above his
[1:06:05] army but you see it was not revealed to
[1:06:08] them oh my amen there it is they
[1:06:10] believed that could be done but they
[1:06:13] believed God could do it but it wasn't
[1:06:15] revealed to them ain't that incredible
[1:06:17] they knew God could do it but they could
[1:06:20] not believe that he can do it through
[1:06:21] them and that's a big tactic that the
[1:06:23] devil brings against against lay members
[1:06:26] how many's ever felt that before that I
[1:06:29] can't do it it's just the pastor's
[1:06:30] message only the pastor can overcome
[1:06:33] only the Deacon can overcome only mama
[1:06:35] can overcome or daddy and you see here
[1:06:37] stood Saul and David's Brothers hiding
[1:06:40] behind the rocks and here come David you
[1:06:42] see that's the tactic of the enemy he
[1:06:45] knows if he can keep you under under
[1:06:48] that under those voices he can rise up
[1:06:50] his head in your home and you won't defy
[1:06:53] it oh come on now now here stood an
[1:06:56] uncircumcised Philistine that was
[1:06:59] defying and cursing the armies of God
[1:07:02] and here stood men that was capable of
[1:07:04] bringing him down but since it wasn't
[1:07:06] revealed to them they were hiding behind
[1:07:09] the rocks and brother brandom says there
[1:07:11] were still goliaths today but there were
[1:07:13] still Davids here as well and so
[1:07:16] goliaths are always going to pop up
[1:07:18] their head I may be unconfessed sins or
[1:07:21] pornography or gossip whatever it is but
[1:07:24] if you are if you don't got a revelation
[1:07:26] that this message for you you're going
[1:07:28] to let those goliaths run your home oh
[1:07:31] run your marriage run your children's
[1:07:33] life run the church whatever it is but
[1:07:36] somebody's got to get some gumption
[1:07:38] about them and say this is my word this
[1:07:41] is my Revelation this is the presence of
[1:07:44] Jesus for me Hallelujah and oh I just
[1:07:48] love the story I know it's simple story
[1:07:50] but David would say who is this
[1:07:51] uncircumcised Philistine and everybody
[1:07:54] else was afraid of
[1:07:56] oh man we're living in a day of people's
[1:07:58] rights we're living in a day of a of a
[1:08:00] cancel culture you know I'm sure you'all
[1:08:02] heard of that phrase phrase up here if
[1:08:04] you don't like something you can just
[1:08:06] cancel it right you know if you don't
[1:08:08] like what somebody's saying just cancel
[1:08:10] him and that's and that's the tactic of
[1:08:12] the enemy that he tries to bring that
[1:08:14] into homes where you can't say anything
[1:08:17] against that Spirit it come to the pull
[1:08:19] Pit Where where the devil makes you
[1:08:20] afraid to stand up against the spirit
[1:08:23] it's the cancel culture trying to get
[1:08:25] you to bow down to the enemies that is
[1:08:28] coming against your home your life your
[1:08:30] mind but David would stand up and would
[1:08:33] say who is this guy who is this spirit
[1:08:36] and here stood everybody else saying
[1:08:39] don't say anything about it you're going
[1:08:41] to make him mad Here Comes The Devil
[1:08:43] whispering in your ear don't don't stand
[1:08:45] up against the television you're going
[1:08:47] to make the enemy mad don't stand up
[1:08:49] against the gossip Spirit you're going
[1:08:51] to make this one over here mad but David
[1:08:53] didn't care about the voice voes he knew
[1:08:56] that that was an uncircumcised
[1:08:58] Philistine that was trying to destroy
[1:09:01] his home trying to destroy his family's
[1:09:04] life and I say little church it's time
[1:09:06] to get courage about us and see I don't
[1:09:08] care what the enemy is saying I've got a
[1:09:11] revelation of who I am in this
[1:09:14] generation I'm not just some cast away
[1:09:17] but I'm The Virtuous the blood wash prde
[1:09:20] of Jesus Christ that's who you are oh
[1:09:24] you're not some passed away God chose
[1:09:26] you oh Hallelujah you're not somebody
[1:09:29] that is an afterthought that you're just
[1:09:31] an accident being here but God
[1:09:33] predestinated you but the brand I'm
[1:09:35] would say that God planned you
[1:09:37] Generations back through your great
[1:09:39] great grandfather great great
[1:09:41] grandmother all the way down to you here
[1:09:44] so that you would have the right color
[1:09:46] hair he would know the color eyes that
[1:09:48] you would have so if he would work
[1:09:50] naturally to get you to look a certain
[1:09:53] way what about spiritually oh Hallelujah
[1:09:56] God knew you would be here in this
[1:09:58] generation so he would give a message
[1:10:01] and would call your name and inwardly
[1:10:03] draw you oh Hallelujah you see I don't
[1:10:07] believe anybody's here by
[1:10:09] accident oh come on now I don't believe
[1:10:12] that I don't believe you're just here
[1:10:14] with no gifts with no callings that you
[1:10:16] can't do nothing about it I believe if
[1:10:18] you're here God's got a plan for your
[1:10:20] life the Bible would say gifts gifts and
[1:10:23] callings are without repentance gifts
[1:10:25] and callings many people think I'm just
[1:10:28] taking my Liberty hope this is okay
[1:10:29] brother many people think well I can't
[1:10:31] sing so I'm not called I can't preach
[1:10:34] I'm not called I can't play any
[1:10:35] instruments I'm not called I can't do
[1:10:37] this I'm not called but the Apostle Paul
[1:10:40] would separate the two gifts and
[1:10:42] callings are without repentance so you
[1:10:45] might not be able to sing but that don't
[1:10:47] mean you're not
[1:10:48] called oh come on now you might not not
[1:10:51] be able to play music play the piano or
[1:10:53] the flute but that don't mean you're not
[1:10:56] called God still has a plan for you and
[1:10:59] a predestinated will for you to
[1:11:02] fulfill oh Hallelujah but it's by
[1:11:05] Revelation that we can see where we are
[1:11:08] in this generation and you remember the
[1:11:10] two that would walk on walk on the road
[1:11:12] to
[1:11:12] Emmas they were talking about Jesus in a
[1:11:15] day gone by and I think it's so
[1:11:17] incredible that they were talking about
[1:11:19] all the negative things around them and
[1:11:22] and the Bible would say that the two the
[1:11:24] two ladies come to the SRE where Jesus
[1:11:27] was y'all remember that and here they
[1:11:29] come and the Bible says they were
[1:11:30] perplexed and the word perplexed means
[1:11:33] confused or or or or at a loss and here
[1:11:36] they came at a loss and I love how the
[1:11:39] Bible would put it the Angels would
[1:11:41] stand there with the message and would
[1:11:43] say why are you seeking the living among
[1:11:45] the dead and what were the what what
[1:11:48] were they looking through the confused
[1:11:50] State they were they were perplexed and
[1:11:53] so they would come looking through
[1:11:55] natural eyes confused and since they
[1:11:58] were confused they were looking for a
[1:12:00] living God among Dead
[1:12:02] traditions oh that many times we can
[1:12:05] make this message a dead
[1:12:07] tradition come on now this message will
[1:12:10] never denominate but that don't mean you
[1:12:12] can't denominate it to yourself you can
[1:12:15] be looking you can be so focused on the
[1:12:17] negativity around the message that
[1:12:20] you're looking for a living God among
[1:12:22] Dead traditions oh but I say this
[1:12:25] message is not a dead letter it's the
[1:12:27] Living God to this generation to
[1:12:30] inwardly draw you and pull out a bride
[1:12:33] for his name's sake oh and here would
[1:12:36] here they would be they would come and
[1:12:38] the Bible would say that the angel speak
[1:12:41] a message to them and would remind them
[1:12:44] of what Jesus said and it's so
[1:12:46] incredible because he would start to
[1:12:47] bring back to remembrance what Jesus
[1:12:50] himself said and the Bible would say and
[1:12:53] they remembered his words so here they
[1:12:55] would be conf be confused and perplexed
[1:12:58] but once the message would come to them
[1:13:01] it would bring them out of that confused
[1:13:03] State and they will remember the words
[1:13:06] that was prophesied oh you might be
[1:13:08] confused this morning but we've got a
[1:13:10] message that is reminding you of what
[1:13:13] the word says I will never leave you I
[1:13:15] would never forsake you but I will be
[1:13:17] with you all the way to the end of the
[1:13:20] age remember his
[1:13:22] words wo it's feeling good good up here
[1:13:26] remember his words don't be seeking a
[1:13:28] living God among Dead traditions
[1:13:31] remember his words now what's so
[1:13:34] incredible here goes these two ladies
[1:13:36] they would run away from the SRE and run
[1:13:39] to the disciples and now here's the
[1:13:41] disciples they were so focused upon all
[1:13:44] the negativity around them as well and
[1:13:46] the Bible says that here the here these
[1:13:48] two ladies would tell and testify to
[1:13:51] them what they had just seen y'all
[1:13:53] remember the story there Luke 24 I
[1:13:55] believe then the Bible says that the
[1:13:57] disciples looked at him and they heard
[1:14:00] these stories as Idol tales and believe
[1:14:03] them not oh man ain't that incredible
[1:14:07] here would come some witnesses from an
[1:14:09] angel saying he's not dead he's alive
[1:14:13] but because they were walking by natural
[1:14:15] eyes the stories of the supernatural
[1:14:18] seemed as Idol
[1:14:19] taals and so too many times somebody
[1:14:22] gets up and testifies and says I was
[1:14:24] once B by drugs and god Set Me Free I
[1:14:27] was bound by pornography and god Set Me
[1:14:29] Free but we're so focused on the
[1:14:31] negativity they seem as Idol Tales oh
[1:14:35] I'm preaching now but you notice then
[1:14:37] here we go the tooth from the emus they
[1:14:39] thought these were Idol Tales but now
[1:14:41] here they go they're walking to EMAs and
[1:14:44] they were talking about all the
[1:14:45] negativity how they thought this was the
[1:14:47] Messiah how that he was dead he was
[1:14:49] crucified then here would come Jesus
[1:14:53] Jesus would appear in their very midst
[1:14:55] and walk with them and I love how the
[1:14:57] Bible puts it the Bible says Jesus
[1:14:59] himself Drew near oh he didn't send an
[1:15:03] angel but Jesus himself oh and I saw
[1:15:06] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:15:08] heaven with an open book yeah the Lord
[1:15:11] himself shall descend with the shout oh
[1:15:14] what is that shout it's a message coming
[1:15:17] to you and here the Bible says Jesus
[1:15:19] himself Drew near and started the talk
[1:15:22] with him and the Bible says he asked him
[1:15:24] what do he talking about and they look
[1:15:26] to Jesus himself and says are you a
[1:15:29] stranger in these parts you see with
[1:15:31] that Revelation Jesus is a stranger oh
[1:15:35] Hallelujah if you're walking by natural
[1:15:37] eyesight the Revelation the reality of
[1:15:40] Jesus is a stranger but the Bible says
[1:15:43] he rebuked them oh and sometimes the
[1:15:45] word has to rebuke you oh come on now
[1:15:48] thank God for a fivefold Ministry a
[1:15:50] pastor that ain't somebody that ain't
[1:15:53] afraid to take the word and through
[1:15:55] Spirits it was Jesus that was get grab
[1:15:57] the word and the Bible says he rebuked
[1:16:00] them and said oh fools and slow of heart
[1:16:02] to believe could you imagine if your
[1:16:05] pastor got up and done
[1:16:07] that would anybody be left you know what
[1:16:09] I mean you see where and here Jesus was
[1:16:12] so was so comp so compassionate about it
[1:16:15] he would say oh fools you're looking the
[1:16:18] wrong way don't be looking naturally but
[1:16:20] shouldn't the shouldn't the son of man
[1:16:22] be crucified didn't he SA these things
[1:16:25] and brother brandom says he was
[1:16:27] preaching to them but he they they could
[1:16:30] not seek him because they had to receive
[1:16:32] him you know brother Brandon would say
[1:16:34] that he says preaching the word won't
[1:16:36] bring Revelation you got to receive it
[1:16:39] and the Bible would tell us there would
[1:16:41] walk there were Jesus at the evening
[1:16:43] time acted like he was going to walk by
[1:16:45] their house you remember that and the
[1:16:47] Bible says they constrained him and said
[1:16:50] come in with us and right there once
[1:16:52] they received him in the put them in a
[1:16:55] position for the bread to be broke to
[1:16:58] them oh so once they received him in and
[1:17:01] the bread was broke what is that bread
[1:17:04] what did Jesus say I'm the living bread
[1:17:06] I'm the broken bread so once the bread
[1:17:09] was broke it open their eyes to Pro
[1:17:13] prophecy being fulfilled you see you got
[1:17:16] to look at it the right way the bread
[1:17:18] has been broke in this generation the
[1:17:20] seals have been loosed to let you know
[1:17:23] that the presence of Jesus Christ what
[1:17:26] would brother brandom say he would say
[1:17:28] he's the one that opened those seals he
[1:17:30] would talk about Mount Sunset and he
[1:17:32] would say it was quickening power to
[1:17:34] open those seals and he says what were
[1:17:37] those seals it was Jesus Christ he says
[1:17:40] the opening of those seals was Jesus
[1:17:43] Christ so it was that it was the Lord
[1:17:45] himself descending with the shout which
[1:17:48] was the message broken bread to open
[1:17:51] your eyes that Jesus Christ the reality
[1:17:55] of his presence is here today Hallelujah
[1:17:58] it is here to bring you through every
[1:18:01] problem to bring you through every trial
[1:18:03] to bring you through every every
[1:18:04] circumstance that you go through it's
[1:18:07] Jesus Christ walking with you and we
[1:18:10] know
[1:18:11] him you see not just walking with him I
[1:18:14] want to know him right I don't want him
[1:18:16] to be walking with me and I don't know
[1:18:18] him I want to know him in the power of
[1:18:22] his
[1:18:23] resurrection Hallelujah oh I want to
[1:18:25] know him maybe was zakus that would say
[1:18:29] I I I want to I want to see Jesus and
[1:18:31] who he is you remember that he didn't
[1:18:34] want to just seek him he wanted to seek
[1:18:36] who he was that should be our desires
[1:18:39] this morning I don't want to hear I
[1:18:40] don't want to just hear a sermon I want
[1:18:42] to see who he is I want to see who he is
[1:18:46] and the Bible would say that zakus would
[1:18:48] clim clim to the fork of the tree I I
[1:18:51] know we all know the story brother
[1:18:53] brandom says he came to the Old
[1:18:55] Testament and the New Testament man at
[1:18:57] the fork of the tree and then put him in
[1:18:59] a position for Jesus to notice him and
[1:19:02] you notice it wasn't him crying out to
[1:19:05] Jesus once he climbed up the tree it was
[1:19:08] Jesus Calling to him oh man if you ever
[1:19:11] look by faith it's no longer you saying
[1:19:14] oh man I don't understand it's God
[1:19:16] saying if you walk by faith I will inly
[1:19:18] draw you I will draw you there he was in
[1:19:22] that tree and here come Jesus that kid
[1:19:24] yes come down today for I must abide in
[1:19:28] your house I must abide the word abide
[1:19:31] is the take up
[1:19:33] residence Hallelujah so here Jesus says
[1:19:36] I must take up residence in your in your
[1:19:38] house but you notice the body of Jesus
[1:19:41] left right he he he he didn't live in
[1:19:44] that house but who he was dwelled there
[1:19:48] the revelation of Jesus the body left
[1:19:51] but the revelation of Jesus remained in
[1:19:53] that house we might not got the body of
[1:19:55] Jesus today but we've got the revelation
[1:19:58] of Jesus but the Brandon would say he is
[1:20:00] here in every aspect but the Corporal
[1:20:03] body oh ain't that an incredible thing
[1:20:05] we might not have his body but we got
[1:20:08] his
[1:20:09] presence and what would that Revelation
[1:20:11] do to zakus it would make some changes
[1:20:14] right it was zakus the Bible would say
[1:20:17] that he start to started to repay all of
[1:20:19] his debtors he would start to repay all
[1:20:21] of the ones that he done wrong it was
[1:20:23] the revelation of Jesus making some
[1:20:26] changes once he understood who he was it
[1:20:29] started to change his life and I believe
[1:20:31] there's a quickening power inside of
[1:20:34] this message that can change desires oh
[1:20:37] you want your teenagers to be saved lift
[1:20:39] up this message oh I'm preaching now you
[1:20:42] want to see a Revival in your home lift
[1:20:45] up this message there's a quickening
[1:20:47] power I would draw all men unto me
[1:20:50] brother Brandon would talk about the he
[1:20:52] would talk about the five boys that
[1:20:54] would go into the and go into the the
[1:20:57] the Navy y'all remember the story but
[1:20:59] the brandom says that the oldest got old
[1:21:01] enough he went into the Navy the second
[1:21:02] oldest went into the Navy all the way
[1:21:05] down to the fifth went into the Navy and
[1:21:07] the parents were were confused because
[1:21:10] they there was no there was no military
[1:21:13] service in their family nobody had been
[1:21:15] in the
[1:21:16] military and so they went and they were
[1:21:18] investigating it how come these boys
[1:21:21] wanted to go into the Navy when there's
[1:21:23] nobody in the family family and brother
[1:21:25] brandham says they would go into the
[1:21:26] bedroom and there was a picture that was
[1:21:28] upon the wall of a ship upon the ocean
[1:21:31] and brother brandham says every night
[1:21:33] before they went to bed they looked at
[1:21:35] that picture when they got up in the
[1:21:37] morning they looked at the picture when
[1:21:39] they went to bed they looked at their
[1:21:41] picture every day until they got old
[1:21:44] enough that would create a desire to
[1:21:46] join the Navy and brother brandom says
[1:21:48] if a natural picture would do that what
[1:21:50] about Jesus Christ if I be lifted up I
[1:21:54] will draw am men if a picture would do
[1:21:57] that naturally what would this message
[1:21:59] do if we lift it up if we lift it up
[1:22:02] above our children lift it up above our
[1:22:04] marriage lift it up in our house in our
[1:22:07] church it will draw all men and you
[1:22:10] notice what happened and changed the
[1:22:12] course of their family history ain't
[1:22:15] that incredible that nobody in their
[1:22:17] family was on the direction of military
[1:22:20] service until that picture was lifted up
[1:22:22] then once that was lifted up but change
[1:22:25] the course of their family Direction and
[1:22:27] this message can change the course of
[1:22:30] family history it can change the course
[1:22:32] of family curses it can change the
[1:22:35] course of generational curses that has
[1:22:37] passed from generation to generation you
[1:22:40] lift up this message it can change the
[1:22:44] course it's not a Del letter it's a
[1:22:47] living God it's a living presence and
[1:22:51] that's what I love about this message
[1:22:52] it's the mystery of God revealed it's no
[1:22:55] longer the blind leading the blind but
[1:22:58] it is the mystery of God revealed and
[1:23:00] brother Brandon will tell us that it's
[1:23:01] the revelation of God that gives us the
[1:23:04] authority over the devil it's the
[1:23:07] revelation of who God is because we got
[1:23:09] to know him the Bible would tell us uh
[1:23:12] let me find let me find the scripture
[1:23:14] here in Psalms 119 and 27 make me to
[1:23:18] understand the way of thy precepts and
[1:23:20] so shall I talk of thy wondrous works so
[1:23:24] be before we can declare his works we
[1:23:27] got to understand his precepts and so it
[1:23:29] was God revealing himself in this
[1:23:32] generation so that we can see and
[1:23:35] understand who he is and I believe that
[1:23:37] is what Daniel is talking about the
[1:23:39] people that know their God will do
[1:23:42] exploits the people that understand who
[1:23:45] their God is will be strong and do
[1:23:47] exploit and I think that's incredible
[1:23:49] because we're living in the day of
[1:23:50] illnesses we're living in the day of of
[1:23:53] spiritual family we're living in today
[1:23:55] but in the midst of that and if you read
[1:23:57] Daniel in that chapter it's it's
[1:23:59] speaking uh uh it's speaking of a famine
[1:24:02] it's speaking of curses it's speaking of
[1:24:04] how the
[1:24:05] worlds it's almost a depressing
[1:24:07] scripture but in the midst of that he
[1:24:10] stops and would say there's a people
[1:24:12] that know their God so in the midst of
[1:24:15] all of the chaos there was still an
[1:24:17] elected seed there that knows their God
[1:24:20] and they are strong oh and I believe
[1:24:23] there's still some people people that
[1:24:24] are strong in their faith they've been
[1:24:26] through some hard times but they are
[1:24:28] strong they've been through some storms
[1:24:30] but they are strong still you may say I
[1:24:33] feel pretty weary in my body that's not
[1:24:35] what we're looking at what about your
[1:24:37] faith what about your faith it was the
[1:24:40] Apostle Paul that would say I've ran my
[1:24:42] course I finished my race and I've kept
[1:24:44] the faith right I've kept my faith I've
[1:24:47] been through some hard times but I still
[1:24:49] got my faith why why would Jesus pray
[1:24:52] over Peter and would say the the the
[1:24:54] devil desires to sift you like wheat but
[1:24:57] I pray I prayed for you that you lose
[1:24:59] not your faith right how come he would
[1:25:02] pray for his faith that was a spiritual
[1:25:05] sight right how come he didn't pray that
[1:25:07] the devil would stop sifting him the
[1:25:10] word shft is the
[1:25:11] shake it's referring back to the wheat
[1:25:14] and you would shake the wheat and it
[1:25:15] would it would push off all of the all
[1:25:17] of the access stuff to get the seed and
[1:25:19] here Jesus prayed that he kept his faith
[1:25:22] cuz he knew if he kept his faith Faith
[1:25:24] he can make it through the shaken times
[1:25:27] oh and I don't believe he just prayed
[1:25:28] for Peter but he prayed for you as well
[1:25:31] that you lose not your faith he knew you
[1:25:34] would go through some hard times where
[1:25:35] you felt like you couldn't make it but
[1:25:37] he interceded for you we have a high
[1:25:40] priest that can't be fail by the
[1:25:42] feelings of our infirmities we don't got
[1:25:44] one that can't be failed we got somebody
[1:25:46] who can be fa he was tempted in all
[1:25:49] points like we are tempted yet without
[1:25:51] sin so that he could intercede for for
[1:25:54] you and pray for you that you lose not
[1:25:56] your
[1:25:58] faith oh Hallelujah and so it's Daniel
[1:26:00] saying somebody that knows their God is
[1:26:03] going to be strong and do exploits and
[1:26:04] brother Brandon would say this here and
[1:26:06] think of it not one believer of any age
[1:26:09] needs to cry in his heart oh that I
[1:26:12] might have been back there in the first
[1:26:14] age with the APO when the apostles were
[1:26:16] first sent out there was no need to look
[1:26:19] back look up and behold him who is even
[1:26:22] now walking in in the midst of the
[1:26:25] churches through all ages Behold Him who
[1:26:28] was the same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:31] who never changes either in essence or
[1:26:33] in his ways where two or three are
[1:26:36] gathered together in his name there he
[1:26:38] is in the midst and not only in their
[1:26:41] midst as an as a complacent onlooker or
[1:26:44] a recording Angel but there he stands
[1:26:47] expressing exactly what he is the life
[1:26:50] and sustainer and Giver of all good
[1:26:52] gifts to the church how Hallelujah ain't
[1:26:55] that incredible he says there's no need
[1:26:57] to look back and wish we was there in
[1:27:00] the first church age he says look up and
[1:27:03] behold what word behold means to look so
[1:27:06] if you can look at him and behold him
[1:27:09] you will understand that he's walking in
[1:27:11] the midst of this last church and the
[1:27:14] then you know the the midst is in the
[1:27:15] middle so he's not working walking at
[1:27:18] the beginning of the church age or just
[1:27:20] at the end of the church age on the side
[1:27:22] or on this side but he's walking in the
[1:27:24] midst of the church age with you every
[1:27:27] step of the way and the word behold
[1:27:29] means to look the Bible Will Tell Us in
[1:27:32] John 1:29 the next day John seeth Jesus
[1:27:36] coming unto him and saith Behold the
[1:27:38] Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[1:27:41] the world or other words look the Lamb
[1:27:44] of God here is the Fulfillment of
[1:27:46] Prophecy look at him and brother brandom
[1:27:49] says Behold Him who is even now walking
[1:27:52] in the midst look at him don't be so
[1:27:55] focused on everything you're going
[1:27:57] through but Behold Him don't be so
[1:27:59] focused on the rebellious teenager
[1:28:01] Behold Him don't be so focused on
[1:28:04] marital problems look at him Behold the
[1:28:08] Lamb that taketh away the sins of the
[1:28:10] world you see because once you recognize
[1:28:12] him that releases exploits to you and
[1:28:15] it's so incredible cuz brother Brandon
[1:28:17] would say this and he was see and she
[1:28:19] saw what he was talking about Mary
[1:28:21] Magdalene the the Mary that would wash
[1:28:23] the the feet of Jesus and he said she
[1:28:26] saw it and she recognized his presence
[1:28:29] what did it do it washed what did it
[1:28:31] released to her forgiveness it released
[1:28:34] to her forgiveness of her sins so here
[1:28:38] once she recognized the presence of
[1:28:40] Jesus it would open up a channel for
[1:28:43] exploits to come oh you want to see the
[1:28:46] supernatural inside of your life
[1:28:49] recognize that he's on Earth today
[1:28:52] that's what this message is pointing you
[1:28:55] to a living God recognize that he's here
[1:28:58] for me you see because it was it was
[1:29:00] Simon that would invite Jesus to his
[1:29:03] house but he didn't make him feel
[1:29:04] welcome y' brother Brandon would preach
[1:29:06] at the unrecognized presence of Jesus he
[1:29:09] would he would talk about how Simon left
[1:29:11] him there in the in the corner with
[1:29:13] dirty feet but here would come this this
[1:29:15] little woman that was unworthy she was
[1:29:19] so scarred she was she was messed up she
[1:29:21] had addictions if there was anybody that
[1:29:24] did not have a right to be in the
[1:29:26] presence of Jesus it was this woman and
[1:29:29] here stood the perfect ones Simon the
[1:29:31] priest no Faults against him but yet he
[1:29:34] did not have nothing inside of him to
[1:29:36] recognize who he was oh you may see I've
[1:29:39] got faults I got mistakes I've got
[1:29:41] failures that don't matter if you got to
[1:29:44] see it on the inside it's inwardly
[1:29:46] pulling you and here would go this lady
[1:29:49] with scars and mistakes and condemnation
[1:29:52] maybe she was walking with her head down
[1:29:54] ashamed of who she was ashamed of her
[1:29:58] life ashamed the mistakes and choices
[1:30:01] that she made but there was something on
[1:30:03] the inside of her heart that would start
[1:30:05] to draw her and she would look inside of
[1:30:07] this door and when see somebody see a
[1:30:10] man just sitting there with dirty feet
[1:30:13] and she would look and see more than a
[1:30:15] man but it was her
[1:30:17] forgiveness she would see more than a
[1:30:19] man but it was her Liberation she would
[1:30:22] see more than a man it was her freedom
[1:30:25] from for from from condemnation from
[1:30:28] from The Prostitute life it was her
[1:30:30] freedom and I say little church this is
[1:30:33] more than a message it is your
[1:30:35] Liberation it's your rapture it's your
[1:30:38] body change what do you see when you
[1:30:41] look at it oh it's your salvation for
[1:30:44] your children it's your body change it's
[1:30:46] your sound of mind what do you see when
[1:30:49] you look at it oh hallelujah it's more
[1:30:53] than a letter friends it's the reality
[1:30:55] of Jesus and here she looked whenever
[1:30:59] she looked and recognized who that was
[1:31:01] it would release to her forgiveness the
[1:31:04] very thing she desired most it would be
[1:31:07] a channel opened up to her and brother
[1:31:09] Brandon would say this the body of
[1:31:11] Christ is one Spirit where every member
[1:31:13] from Pentecost to this time drinks of
[1:31:16] the same new wine the same Holy Ghost
[1:31:18] bringing forth the same results how do
[1:31:21] we do it by one spirit it's God's open
[1:31:24] door it's the Holy Spirit what is it
[1:31:26] it's God's open door it's a sign it's a
[1:31:29] seal it's a comforter it's an advocate
[1:31:32] it's an assurance it's a rest it's peace
[1:31:35] it's goodness it's healing it's life
[1:31:37] it's God's open door to all of those
[1:31:40] things what is it's the presence of God
[1:31:44] and here this was God's open door to
[1:31:46] this lady her forgiveness would walk
[1:31:48] through that door and brother brandom is
[1:31:50] saying it's God's open door to you is
[1:31:52] all of these things he says your healing
[1:31:55] your peace it's goodness whatever you
[1:31:58] have need of it's God's open door that
[1:32:00] you could just walk right through it and
[1:32:02] I say this morning whatever your need is
[1:32:05] it's God's open
[1:32:06] door it's God's Open Door whether the
[1:32:09] brand I'm going talk about the the woman
[1:32:11] at the woman at the whale but the
[1:32:13] brandom saw the Bible would say I have
[1:32:14] needs to go by Samaria I have needs what
[1:32:18] was that it was predestination she he
[1:32:21] knew that there was somebody there that
[1:32:22] needed him it was pred a predestinated
[1:32:25] seed that was pulling out to him and I
[1:32:28] think it's so incredible that here he
[1:32:30] would bypass all of everybody else he
[1:32:33] didn't come to the to the well when all
[1:32:35] the virgins was there but he came to the
[1:32:37] well whenever he was The Prostitute he
[1:32:40] came to the well whenever it was
[1:32:42] somebody that wasn't even even could be
[1:32:45] there with the rest of the other virgins
[1:32:47] but brother Brandon would say this now
[1:32:49] what did this putting the old scripture
[1:32:51] with that experience that Jesus was
[1:32:53] given to her what did it do it made the
[1:32:56] Messiah and did you notice quickly her
[1:32:59] sins were forgiven because at the
[1:33:02] beginning she was redeemable she was in
[1:33:04] God's thinking at the beginning so it
[1:33:07] redeemed her or brought her back when
[1:33:10] she seen this expressed scripture
[1:33:13] manifested of Jehovah what he was what
[1:33:16] he is oh Hallelujah so whenever he says
[1:33:20] I have needs to go by Samaria there was
[1:33:22] a predestined needed seed he had to
[1:33:24] reveal himself to oh so whenever this
[1:33:27] little woman could you imagine just put
[1:33:29] yourself in this lady's shoes for a
[1:33:31] second she couldn't be with the rest of
[1:33:33] the virgins she couldn't be with the
[1:33:35] rest of the married women she had to go
[1:33:37] to the well at a different time and
[1:33:39] could you imagine she's walking out of
[1:33:41] her home and here would come all the
[1:33:43] other ladies walking back to their homes
[1:33:45] and I'm sure they're talking about her
[1:33:47] right cuz people like to
[1:33:49] talk right people like to talk it was
[1:33:51] job that would say when is the VIN
[1:33:53] talking going to cease he's there on the
[1:33:55] ash Heap and his friends were talking
[1:33:57] about him talking about him talking
[1:33:59] about him and it's incredible he says
[1:34:00] when is the VIN talking going to cease
[1:34:03] but anyways here it come here would go
[1:34:05] these ladies I'm sure going back to
[1:34:06] their homes and here would this this
[1:34:08] little lady walk out of her home and
[1:34:10] maybe she's thought oh man here they're
[1:34:12] going to see me they're going to talk
[1:34:13] about me and I could just imagine these
[1:34:16] ladies oh there's that one again where
[1:34:19] she go oh she's going to the well we
[1:34:21] better hurry up we got to make sure
[1:34:23] we're not even even associated with her
[1:34:25] and here would come this lady walking by
[1:34:27] maybe she was ashamed with her head down
[1:34:30] thinking my goodness why have I made
[1:34:32] these choices why have I made these
[1:34:34] mistakes and here she would go up to the
[1:34:36] well and here would stand Jesus and look
[1:34:39] at her and say give me something to
[1:34:41] drink and maybe you shocked her and when
[1:34:43] she we have no we have no dealings with
[1:34:45] each other you're a Jew you're you're
[1:34:48] you're you're different we're not even
[1:34:49] supposed to be together and I can
[1:34:52] imagine that these other girls were
[1:34:54] getting to their homes and look back oh
[1:34:56] look at her she's with a man up there we
[1:34:58] know what she's like we know what what
[1:35:00] her what what her line of work is and
[1:35:03] maybe they're criticizing but little did
[1:35:05] they know it wasn't little did they know
[1:35:07] it was a predestinated seed coming in
[1:35:10] contact with the living presence to open
[1:35:13] up a channel that she could be redeemed
[1:35:16] back to a spotless State and here she
[1:35:19] would be sitting there and Jesus would
[1:35:22] start to talk with her brother brandom
[1:35:23] said he was trying to connect with her
[1:35:25] spirit and whenever he would start to
[1:35:27] talk with her something would register
[1:35:29] and she would say wait a second
[1:35:31] something's different about you whenever
[1:35:34] the Messiah comes he will do these
[1:35:36] things whenever she looks she seen
[1:35:38] something different when the Messiah
[1:35:41] comes he would do these things and he
[1:35:43] would say I am he and what would she do
[1:35:46] the very things that she was arguing
[1:35:49] with Jesus about she would drop cuz the
[1:35:51] Bible would say he looked to her when
[1:35:53] say give me something to drink she would
[1:35:55] start to we got no dealings with each
[1:35:57] other and he would say if you knew who I
[1:35:59] was you would ask a me to drink and what
[1:36:01] would she say you've got no buckets to
[1:36:03] draw with right the the well is deep how
[1:36:07] are you going to get water and whenever
[1:36:09] she seen that this was the Messiah
[1:36:11] what's the Bible say she dropped her
[1:36:13] buckets she dropped the very thing that
[1:36:16] was keeping her from seeing the presence
[1:36:19] of Jesus she dropped it and I see
[1:36:22] whatever it is that is hindering you
[1:36:24] from seeing the supernatural you can
[1:36:26] drop it this morning if it's
[1:36:28] condemnation you can drop it if it's if
[1:36:31] it's hidden sins you can drop it if what
[1:36:34] if it's blood pressure if it if if it's
[1:36:37] things coming against your mind that is
[1:36:39] keeping you from seeing the realities
[1:36:41] you can drop it this
[1:36:43] morning oh it's a living presence that
[1:36:46] has come to deliver it's God's Open
[1:36:49] Door she dropped her water bucket she
[1:36:52] dropped it and said come come see a man
[1:36:54] and could you imagine a heo these
[1:36:56] critics that was just criticizing her
[1:36:59] now she comes running by him saying come
[1:37:01] see a man come see a man and what's so
[1:37:04] incredible is the Bible says that the
[1:37:06] men of the city believed on Jesus
[1:37:09] because of the woman's
[1:37:12] reports so here's here's the husbands of
[1:37:15] these
[1:37:16] critics could could do you think that
[1:37:19] these ladies would allow their husbands
[1:37:20] to even be near this lady no but what
[1:37:23] changed
[1:37:25] exploits exploits changed she once had
[1:37:28] what she once had actions of a
[1:37:30] prostitute she had actions of unbelief
[1:37:33] but once she recognized Jesus it changed
[1:37:36] her actions from that of a prostitute to
[1:37:39] that of exploits of faith that here she
[1:37:42] would run and say go what would she use
[1:37:45] to witness come see a man who is told me
[1:37:48] all the things that I ever done she
[1:37:51] would use her past mistakes to bring
[1:37:54] that the the to to bring that City to a
[1:37:56] living reality you see that's what the
[1:37:59] devil wants to do in your life is to
[1:38:01] make you ashamed of where God brought
[1:38:03] you from oh come on now that's how
[1:38:06] condemnation works you know my dad has a
[1:38:08] saying he my brother W Martin's the
[1:38:10] pastor there he's my dad and he would
[1:38:11] say the devil talks you into robber in
[1:38:13] the bank then calls the police on you
[1:38:16] right how true is that the devil makes a
[1:38:18] mistake makes you trip up and causes you
[1:38:21] to make mistakes and then he brings
[1:38:23] condemnation upon you you see he wants
[1:38:26] you to be ashamed of where God brought
[1:38:28] you from he wants you to be ashamed of
[1:38:30] how God delivered you he wants you to be
[1:38:33] ashamed but this little lady wasn't
[1:38:34] ashamed oh she was liberated she was
[1:38:37] free come see a man that has told me all
[1:38:41] the things that I ever done and you
[1:38:43] notice what what what things did he even
[1:38:46] tell her that she had five husbands well
[1:38:49] like how how did she know that he knew
[1:38:51] all the other things it was Revel
[1:38:54] that if she could bring if he can tell
[1:38:56] me these things and brother Brandon
[1:38:57] would say if he could tell you the past
[1:39:00] don't you think he can tell you the
[1:39:02] future and they were in a prayer line he
[1:39:04] was starting to discern a a lady's life
[1:39:06] and would tell her I think at her
[1:39:08] address tell her how how she got the
[1:39:10] yness and then would stop and say don't
[1:39:12] you think if God can tell you your past
[1:39:14] what about your future so she knew that
[1:39:17] he could tell of the the past nothing's
[1:39:20] hidden oh little church and I believe
[1:39:23] that we had a had a word in this
[1:39:25] generation that didn't just take us to
[1:39:27] the mind of God but also took us to the
[1:39:29] Future and we see hey I seen you there
[1:39:33] job where were you when the sons of God
[1:39:35] shouted for Joy it was job that had a
[1:39:38] revelation but then what would that
[1:39:40] Revelation do then that Revelation would
[1:39:42] lift him up and would say and at that
[1:39:44] day in my flesh I will see God so that
[1:39:47] Revelation didn't just take him back to
[1:39:49] the mind of God but it took him to the
[1:39:52] Future h oh hope you're hearing me this
[1:39:54] morning this Revelation didn't just take
[1:39:57] us back to predestination that God knew
[1:39:59] you but it also took you to the Future
[1:40:02] it says you are my bride you're
[1:40:04] rapturing material no matter what you've
[1:40:06] been through what you're going through
[1:40:08] there's nothing that can change the
[1:40:10] course for your
[1:40:12] life oh
[1:40:14] hallelujah it's exploits quickly her
[1:40:18] sins were forgiven because at the
[1:40:19] beginning she was redeemable because she
[1:40:23] was in God's thinking at the beginning
[1:40:25] that's why you're here this morning cuz
[1:40:27] at the beginning you was
[1:40:29] redeemable that's all it
[1:40:31] is that's what predestination is
[1:40:34] predestination ain't a crutch that gives
[1:40:36] you free will to sin predestination is
[1:40:39] you were redeemable at the beginning and
[1:40:41] since you're redeemable there's a little
[1:40:44] voice on the inside that says man why am
[1:40:48] I here why am I even here just like the
[1:40:51] the woman up the well are aring with
[1:40:53] Jesus but then something registered when
[1:40:56] the Messiah comes he's going to do these
[1:40:58] things that's what predestination does
[1:41:00] you may fall but you get back up and say
[1:41:03] Lord I'm sorry but I know something's
[1:41:05] different about this word something's
[1:41:07] different about this word oh Hallelujah
[1:41:10] and it can open up a channel AM you see
[1:41:13] that's what exploits are exploits ain't
[1:41:16] always speaking in tongues exploits
[1:41:19] ain't always seeing visions right
[1:41:21] exploits ain't always you know
[1:41:23] prophesying or or dancing in the aisles
[1:41:25] you know I've never prophesied before
[1:41:28] I've never seen a vision I've never
[1:41:29] spoken tongues before does that mean I
[1:41:31] don't have exploits you see exploits is
[1:41:34] more than those things exploits
[1:41:36] sometimes is just the life yes exploits
[1:41:39] and sometimes come see a man who has
[1:41:42] told me all that I ever done I've got
[1:41:45] mistakes I've got no I've got nothing I
[1:41:47] can point to but there's one thing
[1:41:49] there's something different about my
[1:41:51] life and maybe that's all you can point
[1:41:53] point to this morning maybe you can't
[1:41:55] point to something special but if you've
[1:41:58] got something inside of your heart that
[1:41:59] is drawing you it's
[1:42:02] exploits it's special what would what
[1:42:05] would Jesus what would Jesus tell uh he
[1:42:07] would tell uh uh Nathaniel or yet
[1:42:10] Nathaniel whenever he whenever he would
[1:42:12] reveal to him that he had seen him under
[1:42:14] the tree there in John 1: 147 do Jesus
[1:42:17] saw Nathaniel come to him and saith of
[1:42:19] him behold an Israelite of indeed in
[1:42:21] whom is no gal Nathaniel saith unto him
[1:42:24] whence thou knowest me Jesus answered
[1:42:26] and said unto him before that Philip
[1:42:29] called thee when thou were under the fct
[1:42:31] tree I saw Thee the 50th verse Jesus
[1:42:34] answered and said unto him because I
[1:42:37] said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig
[1:42:39] Tree believest thou Thou shalt see
[1:42:42] greater things than these in other words
[1:42:45] I'm not just revealing to you that I
[1:42:47] always knew you that I seen you but
[1:42:49] there's some things for you to see in
[1:42:51] your life oh this me this message has
[1:42:54] come to you it says I haven't just
[1:42:56] called you but I brought you here to
[1:42:58] produce exploits the Bible would say in
[1:43:01] John 15:16 you have not chosen me but I
[1:43:04] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:43:06] should go and bring forth fruit and your
[1:43:09] fruit should remain that whatsoever you
[1:43:12] ask in my father's name he may give it
[1:43:14] to you and that really spoke to me
[1:43:16] brother John you have not chosen me but
[1:43:18] I've chosen you and ordained you look up
[1:43:21] the grace of God and ordained you to
[1:43:24] bring forth fruit that your fruit should
[1:43:26] remain that whatsoever you ask you see
[1:43:29] many people want to have the spoken word
[1:43:32] and think that's exploits that is but
[1:43:34] here Jesus is saying I've chosen you to
[1:43:37] have
[1:43:38] fruit that your life should remain that
[1:43:42] whatsoever you
[1:43:44] ask many people put the carp in front of
[1:43:46] the horse they want to do the spoken
[1:43:48] word they want to speak it and that's
[1:43:49] fine that comes with it but don't forget
[1:43:52] to live the life
[1:43:53] don't forget to have the exploits that
[1:43:56] there's a life that has been changed
[1:43:58] that this message is no longer in tape
[1:44:00] form and book form but it's in flesh
[1:44:03] form you have not chosen me but I chose
[1:44:06] you when you was unable to choose me I
[1:44:09] chose you think about that for a second
[1:44:11] and I'm bringing this to a close think
[1:44:13] about that for a second when we was
[1:44:15] unable to choose God we was unable to
[1:44:18] grasp this message this message grabbed
[1:44:20] us it was Peter that would lie Curse God
[1:44:23] I'm going say I don't know the man I
[1:44:25] don't know him and what it was and his
[1:44:28] intentions were so good I you know I I
[1:44:31] think it was because of predestination
[1:44:33] he wanted to do good it was Jesus that
[1:44:35] would say Peter you're going to lie
[1:44:37] you're going to curse me three times and
[1:44:39] he would say no Lord I'll go with you to
[1:44:41] the death but under the pressure there
[1:44:44] was nothing on the inside yet he had not
[1:44:46] been born again yet but then here he was
[1:44:49] can you imagine the condemnation that
[1:44:51] was on his mind and his heart there he
[1:44:53] was in a boat naked fishing thinking I
[1:44:56] just cursed them I just cursed the
[1:44:57] Messiah I just cursed Jesus I denied
[1:45:00] that I even knew him but then all of a
[1:45:03] sudden he hears a voice Peter hey Peter
[1:45:06] and here he is you know he's in
[1:45:08] condemnation upon this boat condemning
[1:45:10] himself why would I if I had to do it
[1:45:12] all over again I would stand up for him
[1:45:14] I don't care what they would do to me
[1:45:16] Peter and he's he's blazing he's
[1:45:18] drowning out that voice with
[1:45:20] condemnation beating him up right I do
[1:45:23] that why did I do that Peter and all of
[1:45:26] a sudden I can just imagine that there's
[1:45:28] a voice you know and it was hey Peter I
[1:45:31] got a message for you I met Jesus I met
[1:45:35] Jesus and you know what Jesus told me he
[1:45:38] told me go tell my disciples and Peter
[1:45:42] and here would stand Peter Jesus
[1:45:44] remembered me he remembered me even
[1:45:47] though I cursed even though I I fa to
[1:45:50] stand up for him even though I ran
[1:45:52] against
[1:45:53] he still remembered me it was the grace
[1:45:56] of God saying Peter I already knew you
[1:45:59] would go through it but I see you here
[1:46:02] on the other side of it
[1:46:04] redeemable oh little church don't beat
[1:46:06] yourself up with condemnation why did I
[1:46:09] make this mistake why did I make that
[1:46:10] mistake here was a voice crying out to
[1:46:13] you this morning that God already knew
[1:46:15] you would make it but knew you was
[1:46:18] redeemable he knew you would make
[1:46:20] mistakes he knew you would have fail
[1:46:23] he knew you would have addictions but he
[1:46:25] knew you was
[1:46:27] redeemable he knew maybe you would turn
[1:46:29] away from this message but he knew you
[1:46:31] was
[1:46:32] redeemable let our musicians come this
[1:46:35] morning you have not chosen me but I
[1:46:38] chose you Peter when you was unable to
[1:46:41] choose me I chose you when you was
[1:46:44] unable to remember me I remembered you
[1:46:48] when you was unable to stand up for me I
[1:46:51] stood up for you oh Hallelujah he stood
[1:46:55] up he stood that's the favor of God you
[1:46:59] see the favor of God don't just don't
[1:47:01] don't have an expiration date because
[1:47:03] you make mistakes that's right the favor
[1:47:05] of God is always there and theel before
[1:47:09] Nathaniel ever knew that Jesus was even
[1:47:12] upon the Earth Jesus already saw him how
[1:47:16] powerful is that before he before
[1:47:18] Nathaniel or Phillip ever came to him
[1:47:21] Jesus already seen him
[1:47:23] there before a preacher ever got up
[1:47:26] behind this pull pit and preached to you
[1:47:28] the promises of God God already saw you
[1:47:31] how incredible is that that here stood
[1:47:34] Nathaniel in this state of not even
[1:47:36] knowing the presence of God is on Earth
[1:47:39] and God already saw him so before you
[1:47:41] you ever came to this message maybe you
[1:47:44] was in a Catholic church or or a Baptist
[1:47:47] or Pentecostal church maybe you was an
[1:47:49] atheist before you even knew anything
[1:47:51] about the realities of of God God
[1:47:53] already saw you and I believe it was
[1:47:55] because God saw him Nathaniel under
[1:47:58] inspiration or Phillip under inspiration
[1:48:01] would go to Nathaniel and would say hey
[1:48:03] come see this man come see it and I
