[15:47] amen well we just have a just
[15:51] one request here from our sister
[15:53] kathleen
[15:54] i think she we've brought she's brought
[15:56] prayer for this lady before
[16:00] maureen she is 37 years old and has a
[16:03] four
[16:04] stage breast cancer and it has spread
[16:06] into her lungs
[16:08] she and her husband are have young
[16:11] children
[16:12] and they are christian and believing for
[16:14] a miracle
[16:15] iman we're all being tested
[16:19] you know one way or another we know that
[16:23] health seems to be as you get older
[16:25] health seems to be
[16:26] kind of always testing aches and pains
[16:29] but um just take it to the plead the
[16:32] blood
[16:33] amen it's all we can do as believers
[16:37] is trust in god um
[16:40] and he says it's by your faith that you
[16:43] are healed
[16:44] so we just believe that this morning if
[16:47] there'd be any
[16:48] manga one amongst us this morning that
[16:51] needs a touch from the lord lamb
[16:53] just uh plead that blood this morning as
[16:55] we go in prayer
[16:58] um i just also like to lift up
[17:01] our brother benjamin for complete
[17:02] healing amen
[17:04] that the lord was gracious found him uh
[17:07] opportunity to get
[17:09] surgery done and that the lord would
[17:11] completely heal him
[17:13] also for anybody else in india with this
[17:17] kovid
[17:21] there's always something whether it's
[17:23] covert or something else
[17:25] it's kind of masked but i truly believe
[17:28] that
[17:29] behind the mask is that you know
[17:32] the devil you know we want to just bring
[17:34] us down do whatever he can to
[17:36] uh just get you to lay back in this hour
[17:39] that we're living in

[17:43] also let's just remember the anniversary
[17:47] of d-day
[17:48] i know for how many know that but if
[17:51] you've ever watched
[17:52] the movie or watched anything
[17:55] presentation on d-day i mean
[17:57] these guys knew they had a slim chance
[18:01] but they fought
[18:07] that we might have freedom
[18:12] um some people take it for granted
[18:19] and christ fought for our freedom
[18:25] so we just go by faith be thankful
[18:28] for this morning amen uh let's just
[18:32] remember

[18:44] carpet in it i think it's coming along
[18:46] great
[18:47] and i hope that it builds your
[18:50] anticipation
[18:51] that one day there'll be an announcement
[18:53] and it'll be
[18:55] that this is the last day here so i pray
[18:58] that uh

[20:49] amen may be seated amen hallelujah
[20:53] uh brother mark would you uh give that
[20:56] you want to stand up or come up here
[20:58] okay
[20:59] i just want to testify i was on a trip
[21:01] to north carolina a couple weeks ago and
[21:03] it was just such a beautiful time
[21:05] i've never had a vacation or experience
[21:08] something like that
[21:14] just to be
[21:23] it was such a beautiful time i didn't
[21:25] want to leave and get to go to
[21:27] berry coffees church as well what really
[21:30] challenged me is i was looking at the
[21:31] song leader he was
[21:33] he was in there already he's praying
[21:35] before it started just
[21:38] and another thing too he just he learned
[21:39] you know how to like sung in keys and
[21:42] it really challenged me to be a better
[21:43] song leader you know i'm a very good
[21:45] song leader and i just want to just grow
[21:47] as much as i can in the lord you know
[21:50] just seeing them being able to change in
[21:51] keys like seeing the key of g
[21:53] you know thinking faster and then other
[21:55] testimony as well as
[21:56] i was talking to him after service and
[21:59] he was just saying how
[22:00] he works two jobs and goes to school
[22:02] full time and he
[22:04] makes it to every service i was just
[22:06] like i was just really challenged by
[22:07] that it's no excuse
[22:09] you know when i just just seen this day
[22:10] and age i know the devil can make us
[22:12] have so many excuses
[22:14] but our host of duty is here at church
[22:16] lord wants you to be here no matter what
[22:18] excuse you have
[22:19] and i guess i understand if you're
[22:20] really sick yes but the devil likes to
[22:22] use other excuses in our lives work
[22:26] can't be excused
[22:27] you just got to do it because the lord
[22:28] the lord is going to say that that day
[22:30] that they have judgment well you have to
[22:32] do all his work you know i understand
[22:33] he's not
[22:34] because the lord the lord knows he has a
[22:36] perfect plan to vote for your life
[22:38] and one more thing uh when we're at
[22:40] lunch before we're leaving
[22:42] i was talking to this lady at lunch and
[22:44] she was and she lives in pittsburgh or
[22:46] i'm sorry
[22:46] butler and she was just saying how you
[22:48] know she she wants to do more for a
[22:50] church and she lives about three and a
[22:51] half hours away she looks up for the
[22:52] paul's church
[22:53] and she doesn't make it to every service
[22:54] but she just said and heart she wanted
[22:56] to do more
[22:57] and it just really just challenged me
[22:58] that she wants to do so much more for
[23:00] her church being that far away
[23:01] and you know who am i to do i should be
[23:04] so much more come so closer
[23:06] and then uh one last thing i'll stop
[23:08] talking and then
[23:09] as we were leaving uh and i was leaving
[23:12] from the gas station uh right
[23:14] right after the trip and she asked me to
[23:16] pray and i was beginning to cry and weep
[23:18] because i didn't want to leave i just
[23:19] love that time precious
[23:22] when brother brandon said uh back in the
[23:23] day he used to cry and leave when he'd
[23:25] leave one another at church
[23:27] i felt that and we could have that same
[23:29] exact thing in our church
[23:30] you know the same exact thing we can
[23:32] have we just have to gather as one be
[23:34] unified with the lord more
[23:36] right and i don't want this fire that
[23:38] the lord has given me to die i just
[23:40] began to thank the lord so much for that
[23:41] opportunity
[23:43] and i just want us to have that same
[23:45] experience we can have all that same
[23:46] exact experience we just got to just
[23:48] love one another more get in the spirit
[23:50] more
[23:51] and just just strive to press towards
[23:53] the mark
[23:54] and thank you guys for hearing me
[23:58] hey my mother amen hallelujah

[24:05] that uh our brother's on fire it's been
[24:08] for a while
[24:09] and uh you know you know
[24:12] it's it's gonna be a revival let it

[32:39] well god bless you turn with me if you
[32:41] would to the book of
[32:43] and let's continue to pray for our
[32:44] precious brother
[32:46] and all the missionaries i think it's
[32:50] harder now because they can't
[32:52] get away come to the states receive
[32:56] encouragement from the brothers here
[32:57] because so many brothers encouraged our
[33:00] brothers overseas
[33:02] and support so let's continue to pray
[33:04] for them it's harder for them
[33:06] and we want to continue to pray for our
[33:10] church because
[33:11] we used to just have um
[33:16] almost like almost too many missionaries
[33:18] coming through here
[33:19] we just never invited people because
[33:21] they just came
[33:22] honestly but now that the missionaries
[33:24] aren't here and people are not traveling
[33:26] with the culvert we really need to start
[33:29] looking to more evangelism
[33:32] to come into the church and and and
[33:35] be a part of this ministry amen
[33:38] amen so we want to pray for that and
[33:40] we're going to read just one verse and
[33:43] first john chapter four first john
[33:46] chapter four
[33:48] verse number four
[34:02] amen before we begin reading
[34:05] let's just look to the the author of
[34:08] this
[34:09] precious priceless book amen
[34:12] our heavenly father lord approaching you
[34:16] at this time we're
[34:18] as our brother ron said we're unworthy
[34:21] lord
[34:22] unworthy to approach you lord by your
[34:25] grace that we're
[34:27] even standing here today in your
[34:29] sanctuary
[34:32] lord we ask that you would cleanse me
[34:34] and wash me and prepare me set me aside
[34:36] for the service let me only speak
[34:38] those things which would be of you
[34:42] keep my mouth from saying anything that
[34:43] would not be
[34:45] of truth lord
[34:49] father i pray that you would bless
[34:52] the hearers of the word for they've come
[34:55] to hear from you
[34:58] i pray that you would bless each one
[35:00] with an ear to hear
[35:03] for lord that was requirement lord i
[35:06] pray that you
[35:07] bless each one with good ground that the
[35:09] word could fall on the good ground
[35:11] bring forth fruit lord
[35:15] pray that you would bless
[35:18] each of us that we'd mixed the word
[35:20] today with faith that it would
[35:22] profit our lives when we leave here
[35:24] today
[35:25] so lord we ask that you would just move
[35:27] in our midst may each one of us feel
[35:30] your presence and able to grow
[35:34] and take just something from this
[35:37] service
[35:38] that we might be better equipped to
[35:40] overcome the enemy
[35:42] we commit the service now to you and ask
[35:44] your blessings lord on the reading of
[35:46] the word
[35:46] in jesus christ's name we ask amen
[35:50] amen first john chapter 4 verse 4
[35:53] ye are of god little children and have
[35:56] overcome
[35:57] them because greater is he that's in you
[36:01] than he that is in the world god bless
[36:04] you may be seated
[36:09] ear of god little children
[36:14] and you've overcome them who's them
[36:20] amen them are the spirits that are not
[36:24] of god it's the nature that is not of
[36:29] god
[36:31] and we all battle that which is not of
[36:35] god
[36:39] these spirits are not of god
[36:43] the spear these spirits that are not of
[36:45] god are
[36:46] greater than any human flesh
[36:52] they have the ability to overcome every
[36:55] human being
[36:57] but the children of god have overcome
[36:59] them because
[37:01] there is a god that lives inside of them
[37:04] that is greater than them
[37:07] greater is the god that lives in us
[37:10] through faith without the faith they
[37:14] can't get the job done because god don't
[37:15] do anything by faith
[37:17] we can't just say i believe i'm a child
[37:19] of god
[37:33] did you know as long as we're hanging
[37:35] around our flesh
[37:37] the spirits of the world are there too
[37:42] they don't leave
[37:45] they don't leave that realm that's where
[37:47] they live
[37:48] they live in that dimension and they
[37:51] are attracted to carnality like a magnet
[37:59] and that's why we're we've been told to
[38:02] get out of the flesh
[38:02] to get into the spirit get away from
[38:04] them
[38:06] the only hiding place greater than the
[38:08] spirits of this world
[38:09] is simply god's presence
[38:13] that's the only place the devils can't
[38:15] do any harm
[38:18] and when we're courageous enough to die
[38:20] out of our carnal nature
[38:22] we can't enter into the spirit but we're
[38:24] just not going to enter the spirit
[38:26] by just simply plopping in church
[38:31] we can overcome the enemy within we're
[38:34] not
[38:34] ignorant of the devil's devices we're
[38:37] overcomers we're discovering how to
[38:41] detect the enemy
[38:42] within us by accepting the truth that
[38:45] there
[38:46] is a law of sin that wars in our members
[38:50] we are in presently the greatest battle
[38:52] ever fought
[38:53] we're fighting against the greatest
[38:55] enemy we know which is our carnality
[38:58] our carnal nature gets in the way of any
[39:01] progress
[39:02] of our personal relationship with god we
[39:04] want to grow in christ we want to know
[39:06] christ more
[39:07] the only thing that stands in a way is
[39:08] our carnality
[39:11] the more we try the spirit that is
[39:14] speaking to us
[39:16] speaking to our minds the better will be
[39:19] able to detect them
[39:21] amen after we've detected
[39:24] our carnal nature we're learning to
[39:27] diffuse
[39:29] or dissolve the enemy within
[39:33] and we do that by humbling ourselves
[39:35] under the mighty
[39:36] hand of god that he won't have any
[39:39] ground to work through
[39:41] that he won't have he's like i don't
[39:42] have no armor i don't have nobody to
[39:44] work through
[39:45] what about those spirits that get cast
[39:47] out they go out
[39:50] looking for someone to dwell in because
[39:51] the devil can't do anything
[39:53] unless he's got a vessel to work in but
[39:55] if he comes back to your house and he
[39:56] finds it empty
[39:58] that spirit that you were dealing with
[40:00] that got cast out by the word of god at
[40:02] church one day
[40:04] amen he comes back and he sees that you
[40:07] have not
[40:07] filled that occupancy with the holy
[40:09] spirit
[40:10] he has the right to bring
[40:13] demons five times greater than him
[40:17] and enter back in
[40:21] so we need to humble ourselves
[40:25] the devil can't work through a humble
[40:27] person
[40:29] i remember brother johnson used to say
[40:34] a praying man a man that really really
[40:38] prays gets into the spirit you'll find
[40:41] that that man will be
[40:43] dead to himself and a dead man
[40:47] will never hurt you
[40:52] he's dead to himself but if you don't
[40:55] die out to yourself and that old nature
[40:57] can just spring up at any time and just
[41:04] as long as we walk around in the flesh
[41:07] we're walking with devils
[41:10] we don't know it we don't realize it but
[41:12] we are
[41:14] the word always detects and uncovers
[41:17] the greatest enemy the word will do that
[41:22] jesus the word made flesh uncovered
[41:24] brother peter's
[41:25] greatest enemy his selfish nature that
[41:29] savors the things of men
[41:30] and not be of god remember the word was
[41:33] standing right there with peter
[41:36] and showed him his greatest enemy
[41:39] and the word will always disarm the
[41:42] greatest enemy
[41:45] just like when the word defused peter's
[41:47] greatest enemy his carnal nature
[41:49] when jesus told him to just deny
[41:52] yourself peter
[41:54] pick up the father's will and start
[41:57] following
[41:59] he told them what to do to defuse the
[42:01] enemy
[42:02] to disarm them and this morning we want
[42:06] to destroy
[42:06] our greatest enemy from within and the
[42:09] word of god will do it
[42:12] remember when the devil came to jesus
[42:14] and he appealed to his
[42:16] flesh that's what he did he was hungry
[42:18] been fasting
[42:21] the devil wanted jesus to focus on using
[42:25] god's word for his body to prove his
[42:29] identity
[42:31] that's right if
[42:34] thou be the son of god command these
[42:36] stones to be made bread
[42:39] just use the word for your body
[42:44] but jesus detected the enemy through a
[42:47] physical need this hunger that he was
[42:49] having in his body
[42:51] and jesus disarmed the devil by denying
[42:54] what his own flesh
[42:57] because he wanted food the bible says he
[42:59] was hungry
[43:02] he disarmed the devil by not giving them
[43:05] what his flesh wanted jesus took away
[43:08] his weapon when he answered and said in
[43:11] matthew chapter 4 verse 4
[43:12] it is written man shall not live by
[43:15] bread alone
[43:16] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[43:18] the mouth of god
[43:20] we don't pick and choose what part of
[43:22] god's word we want and what part we
[43:24] don't
[43:25] we must live by every word of god
[43:28] because when we get to heaven every word
[43:30] of god will be there
[43:33] don't pick and choose
[43:37] the devil tried another tactic you know
[43:40] if he can't get you in the first one
[43:42] he'll try another one
[43:44] next the devil wanted jesus to focus on
[43:46] using
[43:47] god's word and power for a personal
[43:52] miracle
[43:55] come on we all want miracles right and
[43:58] by doing this miracle
[44:00] it would prove his identity and his
[44:02] connection
[44:04] with god
[44:07] if thou be the son of god cast these
[44:10] cast thyself down for it is
[44:13] written notice they were both saying the
[44:15] devil and god
[44:16] was saying it is written both of these
[44:20] spirits use the word
[44:23] satan is quoting the bible he says he
[44:25] shall give
[44:26] his angels charged concerning thee and
[44:29] in their hands they shall bear thee up
[44:30] let's say
[44:31] lester any time thou dash thy foot
[44:33] against
[44:34] a stone by doing this miracle
[44:37] it's going to prove you're connected
[44:40] with god
[44:41] we all want to prove that we're
[44:42] connected to god sometimes we spend too
[44:45] much time
[44:45] trying to prove to somebody that we're
[44:47] connected to god
[44:52] notice jesus detected the enemy through
[44:55] the devil's temptation by trying to get
[44:57] jesus
[44:58] to control his own will over the
[45:00] father's will
[45:03] and it's the word of god
[45:07] just do it
[45:10] then jesus disarmed the devil by denying
[45:13] his flesh from any self-will and said it
[45:17] is written thou
[45:18] shall not tempt the lord thy god
[45:22] even jesus had to deny his will had to
[45:26] deny his flesh
[45:27] the devil was coming and dealing with
[45:30] him
[45:33] using god's promise to prove some
[45:35] identity is
[45:36] always tempting the lord
[45:40] brother branham said god doesn't clown
[45:43] around for anybody
[45:46] jesus was going through a spiritual
[45:48] battle with the devil just like we all
[45:50] do
[45:51] and the third thing the devil tried to
[45:53] do was to get jesus
[45:55] to imagine all sorts of glory
[46:02] the glory of man the glory of all the
[46:04] kingdoms
[46:05] just imagine you having this glory
[46:09] but jesus detected the enemy right away
[46:13] speaking to him again he tried the
[46:15] spirit he knew it was the devil we've
[46:18] got to know
[46:19] what spirit is speaking to our heads we
[46:22] can't just go through life
[46:23] just oblivious and not knowing what's
[46:25] going on we've got to know the enemy
[46:30] i want you to notice something i've
[46:31] never seen before the first two
[46:32] temptations
[46:33] the devil wanted jesus to use the power
[46:36] of god
[46:38] to get what his flesh wanted and this
[46:40] third temptation
[46:42] he wanted jesus to use the devil's power
[46:46] to get what his flesh wanted
[46:52] all these things the devil said i will
[46:55] give thee if thou will fall down and
[46:58] worship me
[47:01] he'll do whatever he can if he can't get
[47:04] you
[47:07] to use to use god's word for your flesh
[47:12] well then he'll try to give you
[47:14] something the easier way
[47:16] because see he was going to inherit the
[47:18] get the keys back
[47:22] but see wouldn't it what's easier die on
[47:25] the cross and suffer
[47:27] or just bow down say devil
[47:30] it's you're okay i bout to
[47:34] i bow my will to yours that's a lot
[47:37] easier than having to suffer
[47:39] and we and the devil comes to us all the
[47:42] time and gets us to bow before him
[47:50] it should be getting easier for all of
[47:52] us to detect
[47:53] the enemy that's speaking to us that's
[47:55] what this has been about
[47:59] jesus not only defused the devil but he
[48:01] destroyed
[48:02] his present power over him when he said
[48:05] get thee
[48:06] hand satan for it is written thou shall
[48:09] worship the lord thy god
[48:10] and him alone only shall thou serve
[48:15] he destroyed the present power
[48:19] over satan at that point
[48:22] get thee behind me boom gone
[48:26] the word of god casted in the mouth
[48:29] destroyed him now don't
[48:31] understand the devil is uh alive with
[48:34] his bag of tricks
[48:37] he's not to be annihilated until it's
[48:39] all over
[48:40] but he will be annihilated
[48:44] eventually but he
[48:47] is around
[48:50] but you can destroy him for the present
[48:53] moment
[48:53] around you that's what this is about
[48:57] you don't have to be subject to him
[49:00] you can say also get thee hence satan
[49:04] for it is written what is it written
[49:08] greater is he that's in me than he
[49:10] that's in the world
[49:11] i'm not living for the world am i not
[49:14] living for my will
[49:15] my flesh my desires i i'm born again to
[49:18] the will of god
[49:19] [Music]
[49:21] jesus stayed with the word he overcame
[49:25] the devil
[49:26] with manifesting the word he just didn't
[49:29] quote the word just didn't quote the the
[49:33] messenger
[49:34] he lived the word he lived what he said
[49:40] you know the devil is not scared of the
[49:42] word being quoted he quotes it himself
[49:48] he's scared of someone that's
[49:49] manifesting it
[49:54] the word of god is the only thing that
[49:56] can
[49:57] that the devil can't handle he can't
[50:00] handle
[50:01] the word of god because when
[50:04] god made satan made lucifer
[50:08] he made him just underneath him
[50:12] all the other angels everything else was
[50:15] underneath him
[50:16] think about that
[50:20] and when the word of god becomes
[50:24] manifest it is written
[50:27] i'm here to cast you out satan can't
[50:30] handle that
[50:32] he can handle john martin real easy
[50:37] because john martin is just flesh and
[50:39] blood
[50:42] but if the word of god gets a hold
[50:44] inside john martin's life
[50:47] that word can cast out satan
[50:51] but john martin can't the bible says
[50:54] greater is he that's in john martin
[50:57] than he that's in john martin's nature
[51:03] verse 11 then the devil leaveth him and
[51:06] behold
[51:07] angels came and ministered unto him
[51:11] the devil left him
[51:14] power to destroy the works of the devil
[51:19] jesus took charge of the conversation
[51:23] that was happening in his mind
[51:26] think about this he wasn't
[51:30] it wasn't just a physical thing that was
[51:32] there
[51:33] how can you show all the kingdoms of the
[51:35] world that never came yet
[51:38] right not past a lot of them were burnt
[51:40] blown up
[51:41] this is something that was happening in
[51:43] his mind the same thing that you and i
[51:44] battle
[51:45] you've got to take charge of what's
[51:47] happening here you can't allow things to
[51:50] be just going on in there
[51:51] and think it's no big deal they're going
[51:53] to bring you down
[51:54] [Music]
[51:59] it's a take charge situation
[52:03] if you want to destroy the enemy within
[52:05] you've got to take charge of the
[52:07] conversation
[52:08] of the thoughts that's happening inside
[52:10] your mind
[52:11] if you don't tell the devil to leave he
[52:13] won't
[52:15] he'll just stay right there and keep
[52:17] feeding you
[52:18] if you don't tell him to get the hint
[52:20] satan he won't
[52:21] if you don't tell him to get behind me
[52:23] satan he won't
[52:26] he stays where he can to do his mischief
[52:33] what did jesus say to the devil while he
[52:36] was trying to teach peter
[52:37] how to live a surrendered life he said
[52:41] get thee behind me satan
[52:43] at the time that he was trying to teach
[52:45] peter how to live a surrendered life
[52:48] just deny yourself give up your will and
[52:51] do the father's will
[52:54] follow me he said get thee behind me
[52:57] saying thou
[52:58] art an offense to me for thou savers not
[53:00] the things that be
[53:01] of god but the things that be of the
[53:04] flesh
[53:07] you destroy the enemy within by
[53:09] manifesting christ
[53:11] the word for the hour and wherever
[53:14] you're at whatever
[53:15] job you're on whatever place whatever
[53:17] car whatever home
[53:18] you take the word for that hour for that
[53:21] moment and that will destroy the enemy
[53:27] you can't take church with you you can't
[53:30] take this time with you
[53:32] but you can take the god that's here
[53:33] with you
[53:36] it takes faith it takes faith
[53:40] it takes a strong hand of faith to take
[53:44] the sword of the word
[53:45] and cut the devil
[53:49] get out of here to destroy him
[53:53] you can't i wish nobody knows what i'm
[53:56] going through he understands
[53:58] nobody cares
[54:01] nobody's helping me
[54:02] [Music]
[54:07] the scripture said
[54:11] greater is he that's in me
[54:14] than he that's in that carnal nature
[54:18] now as long as you believe you can't you
[54:20] can't
[54:23] but when you become one with the word
[54:25] and just say what the word says
[54:28] regardless of how you feel what you
[54:30] think what you've been through
[54:32] is what you're becoming
[54:36] the word of god made flesh again
[54:41] detect disarm and destroy the enemy
[54:45] within
[54:46] detect disarm and destroy
[54:50] that's it don't play around
[54:53] don't give him a chance to come in don't
[54:56] open that door
[54:57] don't say that it sounds pretty
[54:59] interesting to me i'd like to have it
[55:06] you be spiritual enough
[55:10] to be a peacemaker when you get better
[55:14] at detecting disarming and destroying
[55:15] the enemy within yourself
[55:17] you will be able to help others
[55:21] god can take a man who can't even detect
[55:24] his own
[55:24] spirit used by the devil to cause all
[55:27] sorts of discord
[55:29] and make a peacemaker out of him
[55:33] i love the word blessed are the
[55:36] peacemakers
[55:37] for they shall be called the children of
[55:39] god
[55:40] our god can take and change the nature
[55:43] of a man
[55:46] god can take a man who don't know how to
[55:48] detect his own greatest
[55:50] enemy used by the devil to unravel
[55:54] relationships
[55:55] and make a restore out of him
[55:59] galatians chapter 6 verse 1 brethren if
[56:02] a brother be overtaken in a fault
[56:04] ye which are spiritual restore such a
[56:07] one in the spirit of meekness
[56:10] consider yourself lest thou also
[56:13] be tempted
[56:17] you ever just didn't want to listen to
[56:18] the word because it was presented to you
[56:21] in such a way that it offended you
[56:23] amen amen
[56:26] bear ye one another's burdens and soul
[56:29] fulfill the law of christ now we're
[56:31] talking about when you're able
[56:33] to detect your own greatest enemy you
[56:35] bring your vessel under subjection
[56:37] now god can use you to fulfill the law
[56:40] of christ amen
[56:42] to bear one another's burns for if a man
[56:44] thinks that he doesn't have to do that
[56:47] for if a man thinks he doesn't have to
[56:49] do that
[56:50] in other words he thinks he's something
[56:52] greater than having to submit
[56:54] to bear in one another's burdens when he
[56:56] is nothing he deceives himself
[57:00] but our god he's able to take our
[57:04] nature and make him a restorer
[57:10] amen god can take a man
[57:13] who wanted to promote his own burden his
[57:16] own will
[57:17] his own ministry and give him a ministry
[57:20] of reconciliation
[57:22] to bear other people's burdens god can
[57:25] take a man who by nature
[57:26] had been fulfilling the desires of the
[57:28] flesh the laws of nature
[57:30] and give him a new birth amen with a
[57:34] a a new nature uh a a new law to fulfill
[57:38] the law of christ and that is to love
[57:39] one another
[57:42] god can take a man whose heart's been
[57:44] inhabited by hate by jealousy
[57:47] by selfishness and turn around
[57:51] until it becomes the law of god
[57:54] where he's fulfilling just with one word
[57:58] loving his neighbor as himself
[58:01] that's what god can do god can take a
[58:04] man and teach him how to detect
[58:06] disarm and destroy the enemy
[58:11] and when he can a man can do that for
[58:14] himself
[58:14] he'll know how to help somebody be an
[58:16] overcomer
[58:19] first cast out the beam that is in nine
[58:22] oh nine
[58:23] or you'll not be able to see clearly how
[58:25] to cast the moat
[58:26] out of thy brother's eye
[58:30] jesus told us what's first and what
[58:32] second
[58:33] amendment a lot of time we want god we
[58:35] want god's strength his power
[58:37] we want his blessings but we don't want
[58:39] to submit
[58:41] first is humility submit then god
[58:44] seek ye first the kingdom and then other
[58:46] things be added
[58:48] god is the god of order amen
[58:52] this victory of overcoming the devil
[58:54] doesn't happen on its own
[58:57] it doesn't happen just because you've
[58:58] been a christian ex long
[59:02] calvary was a gift but overcoming the
[59:04] enemy within
[59:05] is not a gift it cannot
[59:09] it will not happen on its own we've got
[59:12] to go out there
[59:13] and face the giants and overcome them
[59:18] well it has to be through christ we
[59:20] can't do it we
[59:22] we can't we can't overcome them
[59:30] how many times do we hear i just i just
[59:33] can't do that
[59:34] you know we make up excuses i can't do
[59:37] this
[59:38] i can't overcome i can't i can't i can
[59:40] they can't
[59:43] we can't by ourselves
[59:47] look at the the the the spies that came
[59:51] back
[59:52] 10 of them had the testimony that the
[59:54] word of god was true it was a land that
[59:55] falls with milk and honey
[59:57] but they said i can't to the sense that
[1:00:01] they said they couldn't they couldn't
[1:00:04] to the two that said i can
[1:00:07] they believe the word of god that god
[1:00:10] made the promise
[1:00:12] because humanly possible there's no way
[1:00:14] that little david's going to be
[1:00:16] goliath there's no way that these little
[1:00:20] children of israel are going to beat
[1:00:21] these giants out of the land
[1:00:23] it would have to take god so when you
[1:00:27] realize that you're on god's side
[1:00:29] that the word is with you he promised it
[1:00:32] to you
[1:00:32] greater is something in you than what
[1:00:34] you are then you can
[1:00:36] overcome the things of the flesh you can
[1:00:38] overcome the giants in your life
[1:00:41] you know a lot of times we walk through
[1:00:42] life and we don't want to deal with
[1:00:43] those giants
[1:00:44] we want to act like we don't got them
[1:00:48] like the pharisees well i don't got that
[1:00:50] many problems
[1:00:52] in fact i do this and this and this and
[1:00:54] this i don't talk about giants it makes
[1:00:55] me feel bad
[1:00:58] you're never going to overcome them like
[1:00:59] that
[1:01:01] gotta call it out we've got to go out
[1:01:05] and face the giants in our life
[1:01:07] brother adam said character is not a
[1:01:09] gift it's a victory
[1:01:10] you can't have a victory without a
[1:01:12] battle so we must fight the good fight
[1:01:14] of faith
[1:01:15] lay hold of what
[1:01:19] a complete nature change that's what
[1:01:22] that means
[1:01:23] lay hold if i say lay hold of eternal
[1:01:25] life everybody's going to say i already
[1:01:27] got it
[1:01:28] i already laid hold of it i already got
[1:01:30] it i'm already a believer
[1:01:32] lay hold of a complete nature change a
[1:01:35] complete new birth
[1:01:36] where all things are of god amen
[1:01:40] that's what you're fighting for you're
[1:01:43] not fighting to say well i'm going to
[1:01:44] prove to you
[1:01:45] i'm a child of god i'm in the body i'm
[1:01:48] in the message
[1:01:49] i'm bright what good is that
[1:01:53] fight for a nature change fight about to
[1:01:56] lay down your life
[1:01:57] to turn the cheek the golden second mile
[1:01:59] to prove with your
[1:02:01] life that you're manifested word of god
[1:02:03] in the flesh again
[1:02:08] it's about detecting disarming and
[1:02:11] destroying the enemy
[1:02:13] within not about proving out here to
[1:02:16] anybody
[1:02:18] remember james chapter four verses one
[1:02:21] through four
[1:02:22] teaches to detect the enemy within when
[1:02:24] you get time to read it we we've gone
[1:02:26] through this in the past
[1:02:28] verse five clearly identifies the nature
[1:02:31] of our greatest enemy
[1:02:32] amen do you think that the scripture
[1:02:35] sayeth in vain
[1:02:37] the scripture that dwelt in us it
[1:02:39] lusteth to envy
[1:02:41] oh not mine brother john
[1:02:44] no no i'm a real spiritual person
[1:02:50] that spirit that dwells in us it lusteth
[1:02:54] to envy in other words it wants
[1:02:57] it wants endlessly it wants you get up
[1:03:00] and it wants
[1:03:01] it doesn't stop wanting well at least my
[1:03:04] answer is not as bad as yours brother
[1:03:06] john
[1:03:09] carnality
[1:03:12] then james teaches us to disarm the
[1:03:15] enemy within by disarming
[1:03:17] our pride our proud spirit
[1:03:20] our carnal nature if we want to receive
[1:03:24] power to overcome
[1:03:25] we must humbly submit to god
[1:03:30] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:03:33] we must be willing to face this is not
[1:03:36] correct
[1:03:37] verse 6 but he giveth more grace
[1:03:41] he giveth more grace to disarm
[1:03:46] that spirit that lusteth that want
[1:03:50] he gives more grace wherefore he says
[1:03:53] god
[1:03:53] resists that proud spirit but he giveth
[1:03:57] grace
[1:03:58] to disarm that spirit unto a humble
[1:04:02] person a person exercising
[1:04:05] that's living out humility what a what a
[1:04:08] privilege it is
[1:04:10] to live out and manifest humility
[1:04:14] it's not about well it's i'm i'm humble
[1:04:17] inside you just don't see it
[1:04:19] well if you don't see it the devil ain't
[1:04:21] scared of it
[1:04:26] because it's not the word made flesh
[1:04:30] it's the word thought
[1:04:36] jesus i know
[1:04:40] i know but who are you
[1:04:43] you've got to manifest that word
[1:04:46] manifest the life of christ
[1:04:48] manifested nature change that's why we
[1:04:50] should be interested
[1:04:51] and really come to church and get in our
[1:04:53] nature change really find out where
[1:04:55] we're at with god
[1:04:56] where we can go to the second level how
[1:04:58] we can get to becoming the
[1:04:59] statue of a perfect man not be satisfied
[1:05:02] with just making it to church
[1:05:04] but becoming the church to the world
[1:05:10] verse 7 submit yourselves therefore
[1:05:13] to god submit yourself therefore resist
[1:05:16] the devil
[1:05:17] and he will flee from you you will
[1:05:20] destroy
[1:05:21] the works of the devil just like jesus
[1:05:23] did amen
[1:05:25] he submitted to the father's will
[1:05:28] he didn't say this is a pretty good idea
[1:05:31] yeah everybody don't know if i just do
[1:05:32] this miracle
[1:05:34] no he submitted and i'll tell you the
[1:05:36] devil is real tricky
[1:05:40] we need to stay humble and say lord is
[1:05:41] that you we need to be humble and try
[1:05:44] the spirits instead of just thinking oh
[1:05:45] everything i think is right
[1:05:51] just detect disarm the enemy
[1:05:54] with humbly submitting to god amen
[1:05:58] i could be wrong i could be wrong
[1:06:04] i've been wrong enough to know that it
[1:06:07] was right
[1:06:08] before it happened
[1:06:14] so i if i just go off of history if i
[1:06:16] think i'm right
[1:06:18] it's a good chance i'm wrong
[1:06:22] but if i could be wrong now there's the
[1:06:25] fear of god i
[1:06:26] i have a better chance that god will
[1:06:28] correct me
[1:06:31] we need faith to resist the devil
[1:06:36] because remember the devil's coming and
[1:06:38] he's coming with a
[1:06:40] boo in your life he's coming with a boo
[1:06:45] and usually when he booze i mean i don't
[1:06:48] know how many times i just
[1:06:51] my wife's there doing her laundry i'm
[1:06:54] just i'm going to wait for her to turn
[1:06:55] around because i don't want to scare her
[1:06:57] i'm just in there waiting she turns
[1:06:59] around
[1:07:05] the devil's there just waiting to boo
[1:07:08] you
[1:07:11] and he is gonna boo you
[1:07:14] you need faith submit to god and then
[1:07:17] you can have faith
[1:07:18] you can't have faith without submitting
[1:07:20] to god it's like taking some ouija board
[1:07:23] or
[1:07:23] you know taking taking the word that you
[1:07:25] don't believe in you know shining
[1:07:27] something in front of the devil's face
[1:07:29] it don't work
[1:07:35] humbly submitting yourself to god proves
[1:07:37] that you have faith in god
[1:07:40] because it takes faith to submit to god
[1:07:43] and say
[1:07:44] i'm trusting you lord right now things
[1:07:46] don't look real good
[1:07:48] but i'm trusting you brother branham
[1:07:51] said in the message if god be with
[1:07:52] us then where's all the miracles he said
[1:07:55] the devil
[1:07:56] can't set a foot on you to hurt you
[1:08:00] until first you get away
[1:08:03] from god now i want you to think about
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:07] you and your relationship with god how
[1:08:10] close is it
[1:08:11] are you barely just hanging on by a
[1:08:14] thread
[1:08:17] or are you praying in the spirit getting
[1:08:20] into the word
[1:08:21] letting the message begin to build up
[1:08:24] muscles of faith in your life
[1:08:27] because the devil can't set a foot on
[1:08:29] you to hurt you until you
[1:08:31] first get away from god
[1:08:36] you get away from god god ain't getting
[1:08:39] away from you
[1:08:40] you're getting away from god
[1:08:43] you must first remember that brother
[1:08:46] branham said
[1:08:47] check when anything happens see if
[1:08:50] you're in the faith
[1:08:52] or not and see if you're right
[1:08:56] up to the place with god
[1:09:00] god is always calling us up to the place
[1:09:04] he's not calling us hey just relax
[1:09:08] take the lazy boy away
[1:09:11] take it easy you've had such a
[1:09:14] hard trial
[1:09:17] so is the whole world nobody's wanted
[1:09:20] this covered 19 thing
[1:09:25] he said then remember that the devil
[1:09:28] can't do you no harm
[1:09:30] you're in christ when you know that you
[1:09:33] have humbly submitted to god
[1:09:35] the devil can't touch you he cannot
[1:09:38] touch you
[1:09:38] he cannot lay a hand on you he can't do
[1:09:41] anything
[1:09:42] when you're submitted to the word and
[1:09:45] what is the word i'm talking about
[1:09:46] i'm talking about when god came to your
[1:09:48] heart and he spoke
[1:09:49] something to you in a service that is
[1:09:52] god coming to you when you submit to
[1:09:53] that
[1:09:54] the devil can't do anything but you walk
[1:09:56] out with ninety percent of the word
[1:09:58] there's ten percent that you haven't
[1:10:00] taken i'm telling you you cannot say to
[1:10:02] the devil it is written anymore
[1:10:06] because man shall not live by bread
[1:10:08] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:10:10] out of the mouth of god amen
[1:10:12] we need the whole word the bride
[1:10:16] the bride's food is the word of god
[1:10:20] amen you're going to act like an eagle
[1:10:22] that just yeah i i don't really
[1:10:23] you know need all of it
[1:10:28] we need the whole word of god
[1:10:31] we cannot receive the lord without faith
[1:10:36] i'm talking about more of the lord doubt
[1:10:39] and self-pride
[1:10:40] will actually disarm us
[1:10:44] but humility will disarm the devil
[1:10:47] because he doesn't have anything to work
[1:10:49] through now
[1:10:51] humility will not only disarm the devil
[1:10:53] but it will give more grace
[1:10:55] to destroy him in other words i'm sick
[1:10:58] of this in my home
[1:10:59] i'm sick of having to go get drank
[1:11:01] through the mud over and over and over
[1:11:03] and have no joy have no peace have no
[1:11:06] love don't want to reach out for anybody
[1:11:08] don't got time for god
[1:11:10] you can destroy that how many submit to
[1:11:13] the word
[1:11:15] more grace for more faith in the word of
[1:11:18] god
[1:11:19] it will destroy the devil
[1:11:23] how many more want more grace
[1:11:26] humbly submit to the word it will
[1:11:29] produce faith
[1:11:30] that's what produces faith because we
[1:11:31] all hear the word right
[1:11:34] the word that they heard did not profit
[1:11:36] them
[1:11:37] not being mixed with faith in other
[1:11:40] words
[1:11:40] i don't really have to do that
[1:11:44] instead of that's for me it's for me
[1:11:49] yes i want to be healed yes i want joy
[1:11:53] yes i want peace yes i want love i want
[1:11:56] all these blessings of god
[1:11:58] but what good is any of it if i'm not
[1:12:01] submitted to god
[1:12:04] is he going to take me for his little
[1:12:06] bride
[1:12:08] nobody wants to be married to a bride
[1:12:10] who's not submitted
[1:12:14] so why focus on all the wants that we
[1:12:17] could get the blessings of god
[1:12:21] when really all god wants is just one
[1:12:23] man in his hand
[1:12:26] that he could lead and guide wherever he
[1:12:29] chooses to
[1:12:31] don't you want to be that ephesians
[1:12:33] chapter 2 verse 8
[1:12:34] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:12:38] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:12:40] and that
[1:12:41] and that not of yourselves it is the
[1:12:44] gift of god
[1:12:46] it's not of works lest any human being
[1:12:50] should boast for we
[1:12:53] are his workmanship created in christ
[1:12:56] jesus
[1:12:56] onto good works which god have before
[1:12:59] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:13:03] i want to make i feel two powerful
[1:13:05] statements
[1:13:07] our first birth created us unto the
[1:13:10] works of the devil
[1:13:12] which are selfish works driven by
[1:13:15] selfish
[1:13:16] motives a selfish nature
[1:13:19] but our second birth will destroy those
[1:13:23] selfish works
[1:13:24] and create within us an unselfish
[1:13:28] behavior of living for others
[1:13:32] now you tell me what you're created unto
[1:13:36] when jesus christ came to earth he was
[1:13:39] manifested
[1:13:40] god in the flesh he was the
[1:13:43] manifestation
[1:13:44] of god in the flesh that's what he was
[1:13:49] at one time or another every person has
[1:13:51] wondered what god is really like
[1:13:54] what's his nature like brother branham
[1:13:56] tell us if you want to know who god
[1:13:58] really is
[1:13:58] look at jesus christ you will know
[1:14:01] exactly
[1:14:02] who god is his nature his makeup how he
[1:14:05] handles things
[1:14:06] how how uh funny loafy dophy
[1:14:09] uh serious you'll know exactly how god
[1:14:13] acts when you look at jesus christ
[1:14:16] you'll see the compassion of god through
[1:14:18] jesus christ
[1:14:19] you'll see the importance of staying
[1:14:21] with the word of dealing with the devil
[1:14:23] you'll see god through jesus christ
[1:14:26] because he was god
[1:14:27] manifested in the flesh
[1:14:30] now did not the angel of the lord tell
[1:14:32] brother branham that jehovah the old
[1:14:34] testament was jesus of the new.
[1:14:37] did not jesus tell philip philip have i
[1:14:39] not been so long with you
[1:14:41] when you've seen me you've seen the
[1:14:42] father
[1:14:45] the word manifested well i just want you
[1:14:48] to know
[1:14:50] you you are
[1:14:54] deathly getting
[1:14:57] you are blessed because there's like
[1:14:59] three pages of notes with nothing
[1:15:00] written on there
[1:15:09] you know when your friends tell them you
[1:15:10] ever print something and then
[1:15:13] pages come out with it i don't want you
[1:15:16] to really think you're getting out early
[1:15:19] whatever jesus did god did
[1:15:24] jesus said i do nothing except the
[1:15:26] father shows me first
[1:15:27] i do not the works of my father i do the
[1:15:30] works
[1:15:31] i'm sorry i do not my own works but i do
[1:15:33] the works of my father
[1:15:36] and if i do not my father's works then
[1:15:38] don't believe me these are just
[1:15:40] words that jesus spoke jesus came to
[1:15:44] earth
[1:15:44] with a purpose and it was to carry out
[1:15:47] the father's
[1:15:48] will the father's eternal purpose that
[1:15:52] was
[1:15:53] that was his purpose for god's soul love
[1:15:56] the world saint john 3 16
[1:15:58] though for god so loved mankind that he
[1:16:01] gave his only begotten son that
[1:16:03] whosoever
[1:16:04] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:16:06] have
[1:16:07] everlasting life of course there's a lot
[1:16:10] of people that believe in him are going
[1:16:12] to perish
[1:16:14] because they do not believe as the
[1:16:15] scripture have said
[1:16:17] if you believe on him as the scripture
[1:16:18] said out of your belly shall flow rivers
[1:16:20] of living water we've got
[1:16:22] to believe not like the devils believe
[1:16:24] the devils believe on them
[1:16:26] devils testify a lot more than people
[1:16:28] say there's no god
[1:16:31] there's a god you know there wouldn't be
[1:16:33] so much chaos in the world
[1:16:35] you've got every kind of thought process
[1:16:37] out there
[1:16:41] in the very same chapter that he the
[1:16:43] bible says for god so loved the world
[1:16:45] that he gave
[1:16:46] the very same chapter jesus said you
[1:16:48] must be born again
[1:16:52] so calvary didn't
[1:16:56] give you the new birth
[1:17:03] it paid the price of our sinful nature
[1:17:09] but we still have to go out and hunt the
[1:17:11] holy ghost
[1:17:14] because even as as jesus resurrected
[1:17:17] from the dead
[1:17:18] that spirit didn't come about on
[1:17:20] everybody
[1:17:22] and god is no respecter persons he ain't
[1:17:24] going to pick and choose
[1:17:25] who he's going to put his spirit on
[1:17:28] you've got to go hunt
[1:17:30] you got to seek it you got to knock you
[1:17:32] got to ask
[1:17:34] and if you do he promised to give you
[1:17:36] the holy ghost
[1:17:37] the nature of god and it will change us
[1:17:44] chapter 10 verse 17 therefore doth my
[1:17:46] father
[1:17:47] love me because i lay down my life
[1:17:52] that i might take it up again the father
[1:17:55] loved his son because he was fulfilling
[1:17:58] the father's purpose
[1:18:00] the giving of himself to others
[1:18:04] think about that you want god to love
[1:18:06] you
[1:18:08] lay down your life for others
[1:18:11] lay down your life no god still loves
[1:18:13] yes
[1:18:14] he loves everybody
[1:18:19] listen every one of you wants something
[1:18:22] at one time or another from your wife or
[1:18:25] your husband
[1:18:27] and when you want something bad enough
[1:18:29] you're willing to give
[1:18:31] a little bit more
[1:18:35] is it wrong for our creator to want us
[1:18:38] to love
[1:18:41] is it wrong for our creator for him to
[1:18:43] want us to lay down our life
[1:18:45] is that wrong no because he created us
[1:18:51] it should be our desire to want to
[1:18:54] please him
[1:18:58] moses brother it was not moses in the
[1:19:02] wilderness that was loving the people
[1:19:04] that's good brother branham taught us it
[1:19:06] was christ in moses
[1:19:09] so when you're laying down your life for
[1:19:10] somebody it's not you
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:14] it's christ in you
[1:19:18] well i don't like doing it because they
[1:19:19] just throw it back in my face brother
[1:19:20] john
[1:19:23] where's the criteria they've thrown it
[1:19:25] back in jesus's face
[1:19:28] they were making it bleed all the way to
[1:19:32] calvary
[1:19:35] but he still had father forgive him they
[1:19:38] don't know what they're doing
[1:19:39] all you need is the spirit of christ and
[1:19:41] you that much where you can say father
[1:19:42] forgive they don't know what they're
[1:19:43] doing
[1:19:44] lay down your life for them let them see
[1:19:45] christ manifest in the face or else what
[1:19:47] we have is our
[1:19:48] independent church this is what we
[1:19:51] believe in our church
[1:19:53] and we all got churches right you are a
[1:19:55] church
[1:19:57] you're all representing something you're
[1:20:00] either representing this message
[1:20:01] representing christ
[1:20:03] you resent representing your own
[1:20:04] independent church
[1:20:10] lay down your life for others
[1:20:14] sometimes we forget our purpose on earth
[1:20:17] matthew chapter 20 verse 28 even as the
[1:20:19] son of man came
[1:20:20] not to minister on to be ministered unto
[1:20:23] but to minister and to give his life a
[1:20:26] ransom
[1:20:27] for many jesus always kept the fathers
[1:20:31] eternal purpose in view in his vision
[1:20:34] why he got up in the morning
[1:20:36] what he was set out to do you know we
[1:20:39] the devil has got us so programmed that
[1:20:42] all we need to do is fit jesus in today
[1:20:44] somewhere
[1:20:46] just fit them in we don't need the
[1:20:49] vision
[1:20:50] the the vision of others without a
[1:20:52] vision of others
[1:20:53] they're going to perish
[1:20:58] well that's not my calling well what is
[1:21:00] your calling my calling is the easy way
[1:21:04] the easy way the broad way
[1:21:08] the way that everybody wants to go
[1:21:09] nobody wants to die out
[1:21:11] how are we going to overcome the devil
[1:21:12] in our life how are we going to destroy
[1:21:14] him
[1:21:17] i'll tell you this is my advice to you
[1:21:21] you that are struggling say amen to the
[1:21:24] word the devil will hate it
[1:21:27] he'll stay as long as you allow him when
[1:21:30] you get serious and you want him out
[1:21:31] you want to become all that christ has
[1:21:33] called you to become then stand with the
[1:21:35] word say
[1:21:36] amen to the word so be it amen
[1:21:40] this is this word is not being preached
[1:21:42] to make you feel bad this word is being
[1:21:44] preached
[1:21:44] to to dispose the devil to uncover the
[1:21:47] devil
[1:21:48] to let him to let you see what's
[1:21:50] happening really in your life
[1:21:58] it was giving of his life that actually
[1:22:00] destroyed the power of satan think about
[1:22:01] that it was the
[1:22:02] the purpose of fulfilling his life that
[1:22:05] destroyed the devil
[1:22:07] and the devil didn't even know it is
[1:22:09] what the bible says
[1:22:10] they would have never crucified him they
[1:22:12] knew
[1:22:14] and the key is for us the same thing
[1:22:18] it wasn't the birth of christ it was the
[1:22:21] death
[1:22:22] that brought the victory the thing is we
[1:22:24] couldn't have death
[1:22:26] if there was no birth but the sacrifice
[1:22:29] was not the birth it was the death
[1:22:33] but we rejoice in the birth so because
[1:22:35] there was a death
[1:22:37] the problem is everybody that's carnal
[1:22:40] rejoices in the birth
[1:22:41] and they don't think about death
[1:22:45] like some santa claus here he is
[1:22:50] they don't feel the tears of suffering
[1:22:52] and and
[1:22:53] and i'm in debt to you lord
[1:22:59] in order for jesus to have given his
[1:23:01] life he first had to overcome his own
[1:23:03] will think about
[1:23:04] how hard this was not my will but
[1:23:07] thy will be done he manifested character
[1:23:11] when he gave up his will philippians
[1:23:14] chapter 2 verse 8
[1:23:16] and being found in fashion as
[1:23:19] a man he humbled himself
[1:23:22] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:23:25] death of the cross
[1:23:28] wherefore god also highly exalted him
[1:23:32] and gave him a name which is above every
[1:23:35] name
[1:23:37] that at the name of jesus every knee
[1:23:41] should bow of things in heaven things in
[1:23:44] earth and things
[1:23:45] under the earth and that that every
[1:23:48] tongue should confess that jesus
[1:23:50] christ is lord to the glory
[1:23:53] of god the father
[1:23:57] it's the very same thing for us if we
[1:24:00] follow his footsteps
[1:24:02] we too surrender our life become
[1:24:05] obedient humble ourselves become
[1:24:07] obedient
[1:24:08] unto death first peter chapter 5 verse 6
[1:24:11] says humble yourselves
[1:24:13] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[1:24:15] that he may
[1:24:16] what exalt you did he not exalt
[1:24:20] jesus we follow his footsteps
[1:24:24] then we will be exalted in due time
[1:24:29] the way up is down the way to victory is
[1:24:33] humility
[1:24:34] ain't climbing over something you know
[1:24:36] the world is dog-eat-dog
[1:24:38] prove who's better than who
[1:24:43] we must overcome our will that's what's
[1:24:46] standing in a way
[1:24:47] we must overcome that thing that's
[1:24:49] keeping us from moving forward with
[1:24:51] christ
[1:24:53] we think we're going to just kind of
[1:24:58] i'm sorry the righteous scarcely made it
[1:25:01] where does that put me
[1:25:03] i don't have any room to take it easy
[1:25:09] it's through surrendering through the
[1:25:12] surrendering
[1:25:12] of jesus's will to the obedience of the
[1:25:16] father's will
[1:25:17] at calvary that actually destroyed the
[1:25:19] power of satan that he had over mankind
[1:25:26] i'm thankful that he gave up his will
[1:25:30] i'm thankful that he surrendered his
[1:25:31] will
[1:25:33] he just didn't he just didn't say
[1:25:36] he didn't walk around and say well you
[1:25:39] know what i don't really have to do
[1:25:40] anything because
[1:25:41] john baptized me i'm already baptized it
[1:25:45] fulfilled
[1:25:45] all righteousness is exactly what needed
[1:25:47] to be done
[1:25:50] i don't need to do anything else
[1:25:53] no he had to surrender his will after he
[1:25:55] got baptized
[1:25:57] come on now
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:01] if you're interested in in your
[1:26:02] relationship growing it ain't going to
[1:26:04] grow outside of you giving up your will
[1:26:09] there ain't there ain't room in heaven
[1:26:10] for two wills friend that's why satan
[1:26:12] got kicked out
[1:26:15] we either surrender to god's will or
[1:26:17] we're not we're not going to get
[1:26:19] anywhere
[1:26:21] not going to get where we want to get to
[1:26:22] anyways when god spoke to the most
[1:26:25] subtle beast in the garden
[1:26:26] god also prophesied at calvary of
[1:26:29] calvary
[1:26:30] in genesis chapter 3 verse 15 and i will
[1:26:32] put enmity
[1:26:33] between thee and the woman between thy
[1:26:36] seed and her seed
[1:26:37] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[1:26:39] shall bruise his heel now notice
[1:26:43] the seed didn't die just the head got
[1:26:46] bruised
[1:26:48] calvary gave a deadly blow to the actual
[1:26:50] power that satan had
[1:26:53] he bruised his head in satan has no
[1:26:57] power over you
[1:27:00] i want you to listen to what i'm saying
[1:27:02] satan has no
[1:27:03] power over you now
[1:27:07] unless you think he does
[1:27:15] if you think you
[1:27:19] have to listen to him then he's deceived
[1:27:22] you
[1:27:25] and the word of god is here to remind us
[1:27:31] that we don't have to listen to him we
[1:27:33] don't have to
[1:27:34] jesus his own words were that he was a
[1:27:37] liar from the beginning
[1:27:39] he lies to us and he's
[1:27:42] he's a good he's good at it he points to
[1:27:45] all of our mistakes
[1:27:46] all of our problems every issue that
[1:27:47] we've ever done and says there's the
[1:27:49] proof
[1:27:52] but he's still a liar he never points us
[1:27:56] to the end he never points us
[1:28:00] that we're going to be like him in the
[1:28:02] end he never points us
[1:28:04] to that he's going to finish the work
[1:28:06] that he started in
[1:28:07] us doesn't point us to perfection
[1:28:11] he just points us to our past mistakes
[1:28:15] because he wants to keep us down
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:19] he's a liar
[1:28:22] satan has no power over you unless you
[1:28:25] believe he does
[1:28:28] at one time he did he held the keys of
[1:28:30] death
[1:28:31] and a corrupt nature over mankind
[1:28:36] but calvary paid the price for our
[1:28:37] freedom jesus took back
[1:28:39] the keys that satan took he took him
[1:28:41] actually brother and said unlawfully
[1:28:43] brother branham said in revelate or
[1:28:45] jesus said in revelations chapter 1
[1:28:47] verse 18
[1:28:48] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:28:50] behold i am alive forevermore
[1:28:54] and have the keys of hell
[1:28:57] and of death
[1:29:00] and you're going to tell me that satan
[1:29:03] has one over you
[1:29:08] unless you believe it jesus said in john
[1:29:12] 8 36
[1:29:13] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:29:16] you shall be free indeed you know
[1:29:19] brother branham did not
[1:29:20] have any power of his own
[1:29:24] no power of his own the angel of the
[1:29:26] lord told brother branham
[1:29:28] if you can get the people to believe not
[1:29:30] even cancer will stand before your
[1:29:32] prayer
[1:29:35] all his job was is to let the people
[1:29:38] know
[1:29:39] that the devil has deceived them and
[1:29:42] that you can have
[1:29:43] whatever you believe jesus is the same
[1:29:45] yesterday today and forever
[1:29:47] and and god has broke the powers of
[1:29:50] satan
[1:29:52] to get the people to believe in the word
[1:29:54] to believe in jesus christ
[1:29:56] that's what his job was that's what our
[1:29:59] job is
[1:30:00] to go out paul did not have any power of
[1:30:05] his own
[1:30:07] his job was to get the people to believe
[1:30:09] that jesus had already
[1:30:10] done the work in acts chapter 26 he's
[1:30:15] testifying the king agrippa
[1:30:16] and in verse 15 he said talking about
[1:30:19] his testimony
[1:30:21] he spoke on the on the road to damascus
[1:30:24] he said who art thou
[1:30:26] lord introduction
[1:30:30] to jesus christ and he said i'm jesus
[1:30:34] whom you're persecuting you think you're
[1:30:36] doing me
[1:30:37] a work you think you're doing me
[1:30:41] what i want you to do but you don't even
[1:30:43] know me
[1:30:44] you don't even know my nature you don't
[1:30:46] know i'm meek hallelujah
[1:30:48] lowly in heart take my yoke upon you
[1:30:52] learn of me you want rest for your soul
[1:30:56] it's rest it's right you know you're in
[1:30:59] rest
[1:31:00] when you can get beat shipwrecked stoned
[1:31:03] and you still have compassion on the
[1:31:05] people that are doing it
[1:31:07] he wasn't in any rest trying to destroy
[1:31:09] all the christians
[1:31:11] look what jesus said but arise and stand
[1:31:13] upon thy feet
[1:31:14] i have appeared unto thee for this
[1:31:16] purpose notice it's attached to god's
[1:31:18] eternal purpose
[1:31:20] to make them minister and to witness
[1:31:21] both of these things which thou has seen
[1:31:23] of those things which
[1:31:24] i will appear unto thee delivering thee
[1:31:26] from the people
[1:31:27] and from the gentiles unto whom now
[1:31:30] and i send thee to open their eyes
[1:31:33] to turn them from darkness to light and
[1:31:36] from the power
[1:31:37] of satan onto god that there may be
[1:31:40] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[1:31:42] among them that are sanctified by
[1:31:44] faith that is in me his job
[1:31:47] was to turn the eyes of the people
[1:31:50] away from darkness to the light if you
[1:31:52] can get the people to believe
[1:31:56] paul didn't have any power on his own
[1:32:02] it was the name of jesus
[1:32:06] same power you have same authority you
[1:32:10] have over the devil
[1:32:12] you can destroy the enemy within with
[1:32:14] the
[1:32:15] name of jesus same power
[1:32:19] well brother john i tried it just submit
[1:32:21] more to god then submit more to god
[1:32:23] build your faith up
[1:32:24] to believe that that word is really in
[1:32:27] you
[1:32:28] because it's the word of god manifest in
[1:32:30] the flesh that will destroy the devil
[1:32:35] brother branham said in the message that
[1:32:38] is i be not afraid he said if
[1:32:40] he was standing here tonight with this
[1:32:42] suit on
[1:32:44] that he gave me that beautiful
[1:32:49] he could not heal you
[1:32:52] jesus standing here could not heal you
[1:32:56] if you come and begged him and pleaded
[1:32:58] to him
[1:33:00] he cannot do what he's already done
[1:33:04] he cannot do what he's already done
[1:33:08] he's waiting for us to believe
[1:33:12] just believe in him his word that's
[1:33:14] never failed can't fail
[1:33:15] i'm afraid john i'm afraid to get out
[1:33:17] there i'm afraid to go on that limb
[1:33:21] tell the enemy to get out of you
[1:33:24] cast them out get behind me saying
[1:33:26] destroy it
[1:33:31] the way that we become the word is
[1:33:34] believe
[1:33:37] we're not going to become the word
[1:33:38] through church attendance
[1:33:41] by how long we're in the message by
[1:33:44] works
[1:33:47] we become the word by submitting to the
[1:33:49] word the only way we can become the word
[1:33:52] we need to get serious about this more
[1:33:55] serious than we've ever been
[1:33:58] brother brahms said he cannot do what
[1:34:00] he's already done
[1:34:01] he left it up to you
[1:34:05] on the basis of your faith he cannot
[1:34:08] save you against your own will
[1:34:11] cannot save you against your own way he
[1:34:14] says you're a free more agent
[1:34:17] you can turn it down or you can accept
[1:34:19] it
[1:34:21] he said do you clearly understand that
[1:34:24] he cannot hear you he cannot heal you
[1:34:26] against your will he cannot save you
[1:34:28] against your will
[1:34:29] but he can make himself known
[1:34:32] in his promises he said then you
[1:34:36] accept it upon those bases
[1:34:40] god spoke the word you believe it it
[1:34:43] comes to pass
[1:34:44] god is hid in simplicity it's not
[1:34:47] complex
[1:34:48] it does not do my feelings my emotions
[1:34:51] how good the service was how much the
[1:34:53] spirit flowed
[1:34:54] what the message was it doesn't matter
[1:34:56] who's preaching it matters that you love
[1:34:58] the word you believe the word you're
[1:35:00] submitted to the word you become the
[1:35:01] word
[1:35:04] god can't god is not going to force his
[1:35:06] word on anybody
[1:35:07] you're either in love with it or you're
[1:35:09] not fall in love with the word of god
[1:35:13] by faith in god we can destroy the enemy
[1:35:15] we can overcome and have the victory but
[1:35:18] it has to be through faith
[1:35:19] we need to stop listening to the devil
[1:35:21] up here
[1:35:24] he says you dirty no good for nothing
[1:35:25] you're just a hypocrite
[1:35:28] on the basis of these 17 things that you
[1:35:31] did this week
[1:35:33] you need to stop listening that if
[1:35:35] you're going to go any further with god
[1:35:38] you need to cast that out that has
[1:35:40] nothing to do with what you will become
[1:35:43] if you let that stand in the way that's
[1:35:45] always going to be there
[1:35:47] because that's the same thing he used
[1:35:49] the week before and the week before
[1:35:51] and the month before and the year before
[1:35:56] you got to stop the cycle i'm a new
[1:35:59] creation
[1:36:00] i'm a new creature in christ old things
[1:36:03] are being passed away
[1:36:05] behold all things are becoming god's way
[1:36:11] just tell the devil the devil that's
[1:36:13] been bothering you he's a liar get
[1:36:15] behind me
[1:36:16] that's all you got to tell them first
[1:36:18] john chapter 3 verse 8 for this purpose
[1:36:21] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:36:24] manifested
[1:36:25] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:36:28] devil
[1:36:36] now the whole world
[1:36:40] that we know of everywhere you look
[1:36:43] every news that you hear
[1:36:45] practically you're seeing the works of
[1:36:47] the devil
[1:36:50] everybody just conning lying get to just
[1:36:53] get on top of somebody get further ahead
[1:36:56] get rich get this get
[1:36:57] that so what does this verse really mean
[1:37:02] because jesus was manifested the son of
[1:37:05] god was
[1:37:06] manifested
[1:37:13] but things are still happening today
[1:37:17] but are they happening to the believer
[1:37:22] are they happening to the believer that
[1:37:25] believes the word of god so much
[1:37:27] that christ comes manifested inside of
[1:37:30] them
[1:37:33] we know calvary what the job that it did
[1:37:37] but now brother bryan says it's up to
[1:37:38] the individual
[1:37:41] if you want to destroy the works of the
[1:37:44] devil in your life
[1:37:45] because that's what this series is about
[1:37:51] manifest the word
[1:37:54] there's no other way
[1:37:57] we've got to get away from that thinking
[1:38:00] about just using the name of jesus
[1:38:02] to cast some devil out and you're not
[1:38:04] even interested
[1:38:05] in your life changing
[1:38:08] that's a warp sense of thinking
[1:38:11] it was the complete manifestation of god
[1:38:14] in flesh that destroyed
[1:38:16] satan's hold over the human race
[1:38:20] that before calvary there was no chance
[1:38:24] of a nature being changed no chance for
[1:38:27] the holy ghost to come on somebody
[1:38:29] he manifested a surrendered life unto
[1:38:32] death even the death of the cross
[1:38:35] and by that supreme sacrifice god took
[1:38:38] away
[1:38:39] the keys from the devil he no longer
[1:38:42] has any say so over you so stop
[1:38:45] listening to him
[1:38:47] don't listen anymore
[1:38:52] he's still got a bag of tricks he's
[1:38:55] still doing his magic
[1:38:59] god didn't take the devil away we're
[1:39:01] still dealing with the enemy with him
[1:39:03] that god has given every man and woman
[1:39:05] the same opportunity to overcome the
[1:39:07] devil
[1:39:09] man can't do it by himself he can't
[1:39:10] overcome by himself
[1:39:12] he needs god in him greater is he that's
[1:39:15] in me than he that's in the world
[1:39:16] i can't do all things through christ who
[1:39:18] strengtheneth me
[1:39:20] it's not through your strength right you
[1:39:23] know how our strength goes
[1:39:28] like the mountains
[1:39:32] look at me on something next moment oh
[1:39:34] my god what's going on
[1:39:37] through christ
[1:39:41] jesus said just go ahead my son jason
[1:39:45] use my name cast out any demon you want
[1:39:52] he gave us his name
[1:39:55] and it's through that name that devils
[1:39:57] are cast out
[1:40:00] jesus said satan can't cast out satan
[1:40:03] the kingdom would be divided
[1:40:09] well he's not here in his corporate
[1:40:10] fresh
[1:40:12] to cast that demon out of you
[1:40:16] but you can still use his name
[1:40:20] you can still have faith in the name of
[1:40:22] jesus to take care of
[1:40:23] any demon you want
[1:40:27] and you know what i understand that
[1:40:28] other people got problems
[1:40:30] and you want to pray for them and you
[1:40:32] want to cast the devil out
[1:40:33] i just think that's wonderful don't you
[1:40:35] stop doing that but this
[1:40:36] series is about the greatest enemy you
[1:40:39] have
[1:40:42] we need to get serious about casting the
[1:40:44] enemy out
[1:40:46] this is all about growing our
[1:40:47] relationship with christ
[1:40:50] it's all about getting ready to meet him
[1:40:52] his bride have his wife have made
[1:40:55] herself ready
[1:40:58] what did she do she she took her
[1:41:00] husband's name
[1:41:03] and said get off me satan i belong to
[1:41:06] jesus
[1:41:07] he has power over you
[1:41:10] he left his name behind
[1:41:13] the body's gone but his spirit is here
[1:41:18] demons have to flee at that name
[1:41:22] they are cast out don't you just want to
[1:41:25] cast a devil out of you
[1:41:28] that's a right spirit by the way
[1:41:32] i know when we're having an argument
[1:41:33] with somebody we want to cast it out of
[1:41:34] them
[1:41:38] problem is you don't recognize the enemy
[1:41:40] within
[1:41:45] because if you recognize that enemy
[1:41:46] you'll have compassion on them
[1:41:50] amen jesus said be of good cheer
[1:41:54] i have overcome
[1:41:58] you had a problem don't worry about it
[1:41:59] be of good chair i've overcome well
[1:42:01] that's him
[1:42:02] that's him he over okay what about me
[1:42:06] well if that same spirit that was in
[1:42:10] christ
[1:42:10] dwells in you it'll quicken your body
[1:42:13] that devil will have to leave because
[1:42:15] he can't stand the presence of the holy
[1:42:18] ghost
[1:42:20] so we can be of good tear we can
[1:42:22] actually be happy
[1:42:24] we can actually sit in church listen to
[1:42:25] this sermon and smile
[1:42:29] john chapter 16 verse 33 these things
[1:42:31] have spoken unto you
[1:42:32] that you might have peace in the world
[1:42:35] you're going to have problems but be of
[1:42:38] good cheer i
[1:42:39] have overcome the world
[1:42:43] now did jesus have a hard time with the
[1:42:45] things of the world
[1:42:48] do you remember where he's like
[1:42:50] struggling with some
[1:42:52] carnal things of the world did he want
[1:42:55] to be some great politician or something
[1:42:58] no what did he overcome
[1:43:02] he defeated satan's offer
[1:43:07] to use his own will
[1:43:11] so the thing you have to overcome is
[1:43:13] your own will
[1:43:14] it's your greatest enemy it's standing
[1:43:17] in the way brother i'm said of god's
[1:43:18] progress
[1:43:19] i'll say it stand in the way of your
[1:43:21] relate our relationship with christ
[1:43:24] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:43:26] manifested he might destroy
[1:43:27] the works of the devil we must submit
[1:43:32] to god let the word become manifested
[1:43:35] it's real simple it's real real simple
[1:43:38] whatever the word tells you to do just
[1:43:40] do it
[1:43:44] does does the word go around robin banks
[1:43:48] don't rub a bank if you rob banks
[1:43:52] does the word uh uh hit people in the
[1:43:55] face
[1:43:57] don't need people in the face you're
[1:43:59] manifesting the word
[1:44:04] does the words swear cuss
[1:44:13] take drugs
[1:44:16] does the word not care about others
[1:44:20] that's gotta hit home
[1:44:24] i know you don't rob banks but are you
[1:44:26] living for yourself
[1:44:29] because that's not the word that's not
[1:44:32] the word either
[1:44:34] i think we need to cast out that selfish
[1:44:37] nature
[1:44:39] use the name of jesus
[1:44:42] all things are god that's what the new
[1:44:44] creature is
[1:44:47] look at lucifer god gave him power and
[1:44:50] he ended up using it for himself
[1:44:53] his own reputation he ended up
[1:44:55] disrespecting god
[1:44:57] and he even manipulated other people
[1:45:00] away from god the prophet concluded that
[1:45:04] any kind of power without character was
[1:45:07] satanic
[1:45:11] so do you want power to do what you want
[1:45:16] because that's exactly what satan
[1:45:18] offered jesus
[1:45:21] power to do what he wanted
[1:45:24] you might call it oh it's liberty in
[1:45:26] jesus
[1:45:29] right no liberty in jesus is to do his
[1:45:32] will
[1:45:34] don't let the devil preach to you let
[1:45:37] the holy ghost preach to you
[1:45:41] god wants to give you all the power you
[1:45:43] want
[1:45:45] he wants you to surrender all of your
[1:45:48] selfish carnal nature
[1:45:50] and everything that's against god amen
[1:45:54] first
[1:45:57] first john chapter four verse one
[1:45:59] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[1:46:02] the spirit whether they are of god
[1:46:04] because many
[1:46:05] false prophets those are those spirits
[1:46:09] that speak to your head i've
[1:46:12] i've gone out into the world we all hear
[1:46:14] them every day they come speak to us
[1:46:17] hereby you know the spirit of god
[1:46:20] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[1:46:22] christ is come into your flesh
[1:46:24] is of god if you're manifesting the word
[1:46:29] if the spirit that's speaking you is
[1:46:31] causing you to live the word
[1:46:33] you know that what you just heard is
[1:46:35] from god
[1:46:37] you know we we are not mr and mrs
[1:46:40] discerners the word is a discerner not
[1:46:44] john martin
[1:46:46] you know we might have some sort of gift
[1:46:49] that god will use periodically
[1:46:52] but don't mistake that for walking
[1:46:53] around and think you know everything
[1:46:57] the word is a discerner we're we're told
[1:47:00] to try the spirit
[1:47:01] and every spirit that confesseth not
[1:47:03] that jesus christ has come into christ
[1:47:05] it's not of god
[1:47:07] if the word is not manifesting it's not
[1:47:10] of god
[1:47:14] this is the spirit of the antichrist
[1:47:17] in other words he's just to hear but not
[1:47:19] a doer of the word
[1:47:22] where have you heard coming even
[1:47:23] now already it's in the world yeah i was
[1:47:25] born with that nature
[1:47:30] we all lied not
[1:47:33] being honest we still lie right it's
[1:47:35] true it's true
[1:47:38] i know brother john but it's not like i
[1:47:39] used to
[1:47:44] the word is the only thing that does not
[1:47:46] lie and you can have confidence in the
[1:47:48] word
[1:47:52] ye our god little children you have
[1:47:54] overcome
[1:47:55] them those spirits that are not of god
[1:47:57] because greater is he
[1:47:58] that's in you than he that is in the
[1:48:02] world
[1:48:05] greater greater do you believe that
[1:48:08] it's all based on faith you're either
[1:48:11] a joshua and caleb or you're one of the
[1:48:14] other 10 spies that came to church
[1:48:15] spy out the land okay that's a good
[1:48:19] service
[1:48:20] yeah that's it's really full of milk and
[1:48:21] honey here's a really good one
[1:48:24] but do you believe you can take care of
[1:48:26] those giants in your life
[1:48:30] first john chapter five verse four no i
[1:48:33] got two more scriptures but i first want
[1:48:34] to go to revelations chapter 12 verse
[1:48:36] 11.
[1:48:37] in case you're you're writing it down
[1:48:39] revelation chapter 12 verse 11
[1:48:41] and they overcame him by
[1:48:44] the blood of the lamb okay this
[1:48:48] is god's sacrifice at calvary
[1:48:53] we can't go anywhere without the blood
[1:48:56] and by the word of their testimony their
[1:49:00] testimony matches the word
[1:49:02] they believed they really believed that
[1:49:04] greater was
[1:49:06] god inside of them that he that was in
[1:49:08] the world
[1:49:10] that's their testimony
[1:49:13] and they love not their lives unto death
[1:49:16] in other words they
[1:49:17] surrendered their will to god this is
[1:49:19] the only way we're going to overcome the
[1:49:21] devil
[1:49:21] we may get everywhere else we want to
[1:49:23] get to in life without that but you will
[1:49:25] never
[1:49:25] overcome the devil without this
[1:49:31] your testimony needs to match the word
[1:49:33] you need to believe that there's a god
[1:49:35] greater in you that can handle your
[1:49:36] nature
[1:49:39] and you need to stick with your first
[1:49:40] testimony they love not their lives
[1:49:45] until the next revival
[1:49:50] to that special service to that one time
[1:49:52] i got prayed for
[1:49:53] to the one time i went to unto death
[1:49:58] you've got to believe it
[1:50:01] you got to believe it last
[1:50:04] last one first john chapter 5 verse 4
[1:50:09] are you more than able to take the land
[1:50:13] first john chapter 5 verse 4 for
[1:50:14] whatsoever is born of god
[1:50:17] overcometh the world because the
[1:50:21] overcomer is manifesting through the new
[1:50:23] birth
[1:50:24] right he's born of god
[1:50:27] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:50:30] the world even our faith
[1:50:32] amen faith do you believe that greater
[1:50:36] is he that's in you
[1:50:38] if you don't believe it if you just
[1:50:40] believe he's greater but you don't
[1:50:41] believe he's got that power inside of
[1:50:43] you
[1:50:45] to overcome your flesh you can't
[1:50:50] overcome
[1:50:53] can't heal you can't save you can't do
[1:50:56] anything without faith
[1:50:57] you've got to believe we're all saved
[1:51:00] here
[1:51:03] every one of us has been healed at one
[1:51:05] time or another
[1:51:07] amen that's right
[1:51:11] god has shown his power in so many ways
[1:51:15] now it's up to you to get serious about
[1:51:17] what god's really interested in
[1:51:20] he wants his bride ready
[1:51:23] we can't sit there and just well the
[1:51:25] five-fold ministry just needs to do it

[2:03:37] of sin this
[2:03:40] nature in our
[2:03:44] ourselves this selfishness that

[2:03:53] of yielding to you lord of
[2:03:57] wanting to be more in your likeness in
[2:03:59] your image and
[2:04:00] the devil's always showed us
[2:04:04] as we're an easier way to get to where
[2:04:06] we want to get to
[2:04:08] maybe just listen to another tape maybe
[2:04:12] just do this

[2:04:37] trying to get us to think that we can't
[2:04:40] be overcomers that we can't
[2:04:42] be any closer to you that we can't live
[2:04:44] with more of the joy of the lord in our

[2:06:29] ears pinch our conscience
[2:06:31] the hour is late and lord you're
[2:06:35] calling us to overcome that greatest
[2:06:37] enemy that stands in the way from
[2:06:39] from going out reaching out for more
[2:06:41] souls
[2:06:43] to being used in that purpose of
[2:06:48] that eternal purpose of getting other
[2:06:50] people to believe in what you've already
[2:06:52] said
