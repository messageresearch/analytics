comes let's just sing i know it was the blood amen hallelujah amen i know it was a blood i know it was a blood i know it was a blood for me the right wow i was lost he died upon the cross i know it was a blood for me i know it was a blood i know it was a blood i know it was a blood for me one day when i was lost he died upon the cross i know it was a blood for me i know it was the blood i know it was the blood i know it was the blood for me one day when i was lost he died upon the cross i know it was a blood for me lord we want to thank you for shedding that blood for us lord and allowing us lord a chance to get underneath that blood lord to be a recipient lord of that blood lord that we might be made worthy by your grace to come into your presence we just thank you for that blood today we thank you for the salvation the blood that brought our salvation to us lord that we can live with you eternally lord we thank you for it jesus we praise you lord amen amen thank the lord for the blood and that we need to stay under that blood as soon as we get out from under that blood that's when the enemy comes and he he can get us and we know the blood is the living word amen he gave his own life for us and we're eternally grateful for that well god bless each of you turn with me if you would to the book of saint john chapter 16 our hearts are very very heavy after the passing of our brother dan our home is very sad and hurting and i would appreciate your prayers for each one especially for our daughter ann god knows and and and we just need the lord and uh another one lost just in this short period of time um are our hearts are still hurting for the chanult family and all um of of uh our our all the siblings and all the ones that were close brother dan was telling me that brother jerry was his best friend and the hurt the pain and we just need we need the lord and uh we're grateful for his salvation and uh there's there's always two aspects the one is he's in a lot better place uh not suffering not dealing with the bondage that he was under um and it's hard for us thinking that we cannot be with him no more down here on earth it doesn't make it any easier but we just need to know that there is something to help us until we are to the other side and i believe that god has peace for us today we want to title this message peace today and if we could just read a verse or two of scriptures and then we'll have a word of prayer saint john chapter 16 starting with verse number 32 behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered and every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me these things have spoken unto you that he might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer have overcome the world and then saint john chapter 14 verse number 27 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth divine to you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid amen let's look to the lord in prayer heavenly father we're grateful for the scriptures that we can draw comfort strength from we're thankful that you could look at this moment lord when you spoke these words that you knew we'd be need and peace in the years that were ahead of those words when you spoke them and lord we're asking today that the words would become alive to us real to us today as we have need of these words lord we know these scriptures are true but we need the holy spirit to come and bring peace to all of our hearts lord lord just thinking about the great hour that we're living in and didn't think that things could ever be this bad in the world but it's just the beginning of the of what is lying ahead of us and lord if there's ever an hour as we approach your soon coming of needing peace it's the hour that is before us lord and so we pray that peace would be so magnified in our lives lord we thank you for these things we pray that you'd bless this service now to every one of our hearts for we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen god bless you may be seated death was going to take place jesus was going to die and he didn't want the disciples to be caught off guard um so he gave them time to to think about it and and he spoke about his death because he didn't want them to be overtaken with the situation and he even told them that everybody's going to scatter and i'm going to be left alone but he made it clear that he wasn't alone that the father was with him but at this departure the disciples knew they would need something because their best friend was leaving and he said i am leaving you my peace now they they needed it they needed the piece for a lot of reasons and obviously the first one was because they all scattered just like he said and they were got to a place where they were denying him swearing and just they got so carnal so much in the flesh that uh jesus was left alone and they were missing peace during that hour god scatters his children for good reasons we don't know what they are and always and as we're going through them but we do know that we don't question what god does god is always in control the prophet taught us that one of the main reasons that the disciples were scattered because after they received the holy ghost and they did exactly what jesus told them to do terry in jerusalem to the end of power from on high all sudden they began to witness and and sharing the gospel and what happened persecution came and the prophet taught us that disciples were so greatly persecuted that the reason they that uh they were persecuted is because well there's a couple reasons and we know they that live godly in christ jesus are gonna suffer that persecution but god wanted to scatter them around the world for the purpose of spreading the gospel now that's what the prophet said so when you preach the gospel persecution comes and that persecution is what's going to scatter you and so we should never be dismayed by what's transpiring because god is still in control the holy spirit was directing his disciples to different areas andrew went north to russia and then into scotland philip went to asia minor thomas carried the gospel to india peter eventually went to rome italy and witness to the roman empire nero there peter and his wife were beheaded for believing in the lord all the the uh the disciples died for their belief john pastored a church in ephesus and was taken to the patmos island just off the coast of turkey there we know what happened to him and they think that uh thadetus thadde fedeus took the gospel to mesopotamia preached in iran and he was clubbed to death for his faith in brute lebanon took the gospel to egypt and as far as the british isles and was killed for his belief one of the places that matthew ministered with ethiopia and a couple places bartholomew ministered was persia and um uh armenia so i want you to think about this is all over the place why didn't these 12 disciples say hey let's take a huddle now where do we want to go we gotta you know get away from nero and we gotta you know escape this persecution let's go over here we'll just have our own little church over here because god has something else in mind and so we shouldn't be afraid of what god is in control of he scattered them he got them alone and now he could use them one-on-one without an influence and they had to spend more time in prayer because they didn't have a pastor to go to they didn't have anybody else to look to they went to god but i'll say it like this they had peace for their day they had peace for that day when they first went through the the process of jesus leaving them and the actuality of it happening they were in the flesh and couldn't get a hold of that peace but the scripture says that peace is in him amen he said these things have i spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation that be of good chair i've overcome the world the only way we can be of good cheer is have that have jesus inside so the peace for us today is inside christ acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria and the other most parts of the earth these disciples now had the power they had power to lay down their lives they had power to spread the gospel you know spreading the gospel is is not that hard it really isn't but spreading the gospel to the point that it'll bring persecution to your life is a lot harder everybody don't mind witnessing as long as you don't step on somebody's toes but when you you have to say it like it is that this word is the only way to make it they all died in the faith they suffered the pain of their fellow brother dying think about that there was only 12 of them they're spreading the gospel they're getting persecuted everywhere and they were suffering because the core was 12 people i'm sure they were wishing that those 70 would have never left i'm sure they were wishing they had more help but they were like islands by themselves spreading the gospel but when you have jesus you have everything you have everything god had left them with peace in that hour a peace that passeth all understanding and a peace that passeth all understanding is a power think about that there's power when you have peace it keeps your heart and your mind sound and god left them with peace it doesn't come with being with everything being okay outwardly because that's the problem this world is falling apart it ain't gonna like january first culvert is gone the life the world in some sort is changed forever in some sort it is it's it's it's a it's but this is not the end we don't even know what's coming but we know it's going to be bad so peace comes when everything is going wrong and still something inside of you said all as well so no matter how hard things are going how bad how sad how terrible god has left us his peace and that's all that matters we don't want the peace the world can give us we want the peace that only god can give us now the father allowed the 12 disciples to be scattered away from jesus when he needed them most they couldn't even get him to pray within one hour the time he needed he tried and he tried he tried three times couldn't get him to pray amen when jesus was hanging on the cross about the ninth hour he cried out my god my god why has thou forsaken me here jesus was left forsaken by his own twelve disciples hanging on the cross even god even the father had forsaken him he was hanging on the cross as a man free more agency giving him his life for us he died as a human he was the the perfect lamb of god that was acceptable for adam's sin and all of ours though he was forsaken though he died as a man there was a joy that was set before him and we know that joy was us he saw us he was living for us and he was dying for us amen so keep your thoughts on joy the joy that god has for us hey if you think about the hardest thing that jesus went through and joy was set before him everything that we go through there's there is a joy that is set before us it's up to us to keep our eyes on it we can turn our eyes off of of the provided way to give us peace and it won't help us so you've got to keep your eyes on what god has provided for us brother john i'm having a hard time seeing it right now keep looking keep searching keep seeking and when you find it it'll give you strength no matter what the tribulation that you're going in because the holy spirit is our love it is our joy and it is our peace god is well acquainted with the feeling of feeling forsaken and he is acquainted with our feelings of feeling forsaken hebrews chapter 2 verse 18 for in that he and i'm sorry if these scriptures don't go up on the board i've asked anne i don't know how things are looking on the live stream but i've asked ann not to be messing with the live stream because i just want her to enjoy the word and and she serves and serves and serves and uh she's here for one reason today that because she cares about all those that are home and uh we're we have been graced with ann's giving to the lord or dedication and so if things aren't just perfect on the live stream i just want you to know that that one is on me amen the scripture so if they don't come up here you have to either write them down or get to them quick hebrews chapter 2 verse 18 for in that he himself have suffered being tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted so he's been there done that and he's able to help us hebrews chapter 5 verse 2 who can have compassion on the ignorant and and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmities hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest there is someone that can have compassion upon us that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the fiends of infirmities but was at all points tempted as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in a time of need now it doesn't matter what the need is your brother brother uh ron had expressed his company got sold i i believe there's some questions some wonder not only him but everybody that's worked in that is working in that company brother tyler wants help with his son sister brooke of course the channel family every one of us has needs god wants us to come boldly before him come to him with confidence that he has what we have need of today come with confidence god is rich in mercy his grace shall meet our every need the bible tells us john 16 32 our opening scripture behold the hour cometh yea and is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me god may allow others to scatter away from us to will to where we feel alone but we're never alone no matter how alone we may feel god is always with us he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you and if there's a to me i think there is such a a a balance between taking what is available from god in other words god this is your word i'm standing on it and allowing the devil to take us places we don't ever want to end up going and it doesn't matter what it's about and one of the hot the hardest things i think for a human being is to deal with separation and death but the next thing is just separation while living it's just it's hard to deal with because it's it's a separation and we need to understand as we're going through a separation that we're not alone we're not alone we may not i i um it was one of the hardest things i went through i believe when my brother had gone on and i was young and it couldn't get any more closer home and i just remember remember just grabbing my dad as this teenager or not a teenager i was probably my my i'm not sure how old i was to be honest with you um maybe early 20s i'm i'm not sure and i'm sorry that i don't remember dates you know how my my memory is but i remember instantly uh at the place where you died just grabbed my dad and sobbed and began to pray i didn't know what else to do but i prayed i prayed for my dad's soul i prayed that we would be together i would pray for his help and this is what we as christians have available to us when we're going through separations god has not left us he has left his peace with us and that peace is for us we've got to be willing to claim it because the devil don't want you to have it [Music] these things have i spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world despite our tribulations no matter what they are god has left us a peace and that's what we want to remember we want that more than we want the trial to leave because trials are here to stay they're only getting worse and we don't want to have you know our peace like this we just want peace the peace that passes all understanding when i think about the time that brother branham was tricked uh into a meeting with 300 ministers from different denominations and just for the most part were trinitarian they uh they didn't believe in a oneness god they didn't believe in the the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and uh he was going to be challenged there and it was basically a modern uh mount carmel showdown and he was by himself and even his close friends were part of uh uh of of the situation and they didn't want to tell him what it is you remember that brother branham felt forsaken brother brandon makes this comment when the lord spoke to him when the lord showed him he says okay well i won't go and what did god tell him to do he said go i'll be with you god will send us in the midst of many people that are against us and he went there with a boldness because he knew god was with him and that he gave him peace peace that passeth all understanding what do you mean go what ain't gonna make a difference god gave him peace don't you just love that i want god to say to me go i'll be with you one time the lord told brother bryan says you walk with too many ministers we all become influenced by others mainly with those that we associate with the most to be honest with you god wants our influence to come from him and him alone the three hebrews they felt forsaken why were why were they called the three hebrews because it dwindled down to only three of them everyone else had scattered all of nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was against them there were only three standing for the lord i wonder how many are standing today in this nation for the lord while everything's going on you know some people take advantage of this covet there's looting the hospitals let's just tag it i i've talked to i talked to this one man doesn't go to our church i gave him a couple a few tapes we're going to see what happens but you know he said i just i'm really getting used to this enjoying the you know sitting at home and and and and watching from the from the live stream i said really he says yeah and what's really neat is um you know when we're on facebook i can see everybody's comments or what they're thinking about what the pastor is saying you can see how people enjoy not being under the influence they rather know what somebody else thinks about them what do you think about what the pastor just said how about lord is that you speaking because it doesn't matter what jim thinks about what the pastor said it only matters what the lord has revealed to me and i just my heart just you know just heard about that and i i just began to minister him just like if he sat here and i said look the lord can speak to you that's all that matters it don't matter what anybody else thinks it only matters what the lord is speaking to you but god had left these three hebrews with peace for their hour and in daniel chapter 3 verse 16 shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter i just want to say this and i just came to me and i'm kind of cutting it but i look those of you that are staying at home for the reasons that you're staying at home i believe it's beautiful and it's right and stay with it that's not what i'm talking about though i'm talking about where the devil gets in in the flesh and takes advantage of the situation that's what i'm speaking about there's a difference that's what was was what came to me when this doctor he was actually a doctor was telling me this and i just wanted to help him to the lord and because laodicea we know the spirit is just you know continually drawing us down in a way in an easier path but these three hebrew children answered and said oh neb nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee about this matter in other words it we're not worried about your threats we're not scared we're not moved we're not frightened god left his peace with them verse 17 if it be so if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand so he wasn't sure they weren't sure exactly what uh what god was going to allow the king to do but they were solid that they were in god's hands and that's what we must remember as children of god we are still in the hands of god and there is a peace for us there is grace for us there is help for us there are things for us to help us through these things he says but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up now look if if if the devil can take this covet 19 virus that spread throughout the world and use it for his propaganda and i'll tell you we could spend hours and hours and hours of things that are happening in the world all because it came forth from this virus that wasn't there before certainly the devil can take any situation that's happened in our life and get in there and make it worse for us that's why we've got to be careful not to bow down to that thing not to give in to what the devil is trying to shove down our throat there is a difference you know we cannot take away the pain and the hurt of separation i spent some time thinking about my my mom my dad my brother my cousin my cousin ray i spent i was so close to him there's so many people in life and the older you get the more people you separate from that's just how nature goes and anytime i take any one of those and i go there long enough begin to hurt and it's a reality and you just never ever ever ever get over it you just don't you don't but you can see how the enemy would like to capitalize on every situation and make it worse another thing i'm saying today is that god has left us at peace in every situation that's all i'm saying that god has left us a peace buy that peace it'll keep our minds and keep our hearts as we're going through things what about daniel everyone's scattered away from daniel he was called a goody goody shoe shoes yeah that's it that's what he was considered and all the the princes and the presidents they just they were set up and they wanted to destroy daniels everyone first took him he was the only one brave enough to pray three times a day i think about that i think that made a difference in what god gave him do you think when he when he he knew about the situation he went into his room do you think he went in there playing the lottery i don't think no he wasn't prayer does not keep us from having trials and tribulations in her life prayer helps us to go through trials and tribulation in your life we need prayer we need to stay in contact with god amen david didn't pray with fear knowing what would happen to him in daniel chapter 6 verse 10 now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber towards jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did a four time so the very pressure of being caught and killed did not change his attitude about prayer with god why because god had left daniel peace that's something you can't make up and if you know what i'm saying how many times you've been in a situation and you've been bothered many times wishing that there was peace so peace is something that's real and it's not always there jonah was forsaken he was left alone in the seed but was he alone i mean can you imagine going on some uh what do they call those big boats where you go look at different crews go on a cruise and they just like push you over going to alaska some whale comes up and gets you you think about this jonah was really forsaken but he was not alone we're not alone we may feel it but we need to understand call on god who is amongst us he is our strength he is our fortress he is our refuge he's our present help in a time of need i don't want to wait till tomorrow for what i can have for today he's a present help everyone first paul when he made a decision to serve christ everyone thought he was a madman paul you've gone mad even gamelia didn't say to to to to uh paul or saul um you just that a boy you just keep you know you keep you know serving jesus because gamalia was the one that taught him everything that he believed beforehand so everybody of his old life forsoot paul think about it because he was mad and then when he began to serve christ did you know others began to forsake him as well second timothy 4 10 says for demons have forsaken me having loved this present world so here is a man that was once walking with paul and forsook him and took a change for loving the present world you talk about forsaken he was in prison he was beaten to death he was stoned he was whipped i don't think he felt like he had a big following i don't think he felt like he had a big church big popularity but he wasn't alone god was with him god was in him god left his peace with paul god left peace for paul in his day and we have peace for us in our day david was left alone he was forsaken by everybody was mocked deserted spit upon talked about all his men left him but god never forsook him despite all his human flaws and problems david still had a heart for god the lord gave david peace through all his tribulations psalms chapter 9 verse 9 the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou lord has not forsaken them that seek thee what a key keep seeking the lord and the lord is right next to you psalms 37 verse 25 i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread god does not forsake his children from the very beginning god has always remembered those that are left behind he thought about his disciples he looked down from the cross to his mother he says mother behold thy son son behold thy mother god is concerned for us that are left behind god has help for us god has grace for us god has strength for us god has not forsaken us amen psalms 29 verse 11 the lord will give strength unto his people the lord will bless his people with what with peace the lord will bless his people with peace psalms 55 and i'm sorry i'm just going through this kind of quick and you just have to kind of soak it in today psalms 55 18 he have delivered my soul in peace he have delivered my soul in peace from the battle that war that was against me the lord delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me now we all go through battles it's the greatest battle over fault was in our minds and god will deliver us amen in peace he's not going to take away the trials necessarily he just said that he give us peace through the trials no matter who or what is warned against us god will deliver us in his peace we don't want to look outside for peace scrambling for how i can help this situation just look to jesus he is he is our peace amen amen isaiah chapter 26 verse 3 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth thee now remember being in school and the teacher telling me to pay attention watch this movie stay in tune and my mind would wander sometimes uh listening to a lecture sometimes being in church [Laughter] and and if your mind wanders you're not going to get the benefit of what's what's coming towards you and we know peace is out there peace is left for us and it's human nature to want peace in every situation we talk to people all the time in the world they don't know god they don't know uh but they want they want peace inside they don't know the lord so they don't know how to look to the lord and they don't know how to keep their mind stayed on the lord but the blessings that we have in this message and being taught by god through the ministry that god sent in this age to a prophet we understand the realness of the word and that if we follow the word we will get word results thou will keep him in not just a little piece but a perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee now when i think about all my problems and i'll tell you i got more problems i feel that all of you put together you know how that goes my problems are worse than yours the answer is not solve all the problems the answer is keep your mind on the lord he'll direct us he'll show us if all these people that we talked about went through such terrible things and peace kept them us going through the terrible things that we're going through i believe there's a peace that can keep us and trusting in the lord is the only thing that will open the door to peace hebrews chapter 11 verse 35 others were tortured not accepting deliverance that great chapter of faith that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trials of cruel mockings oh and scourges yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sold asunder they were tempted they were slain they were with the sword they wondered about sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted and tormented of whom the world is not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains in the dens of caves of the earth what got them through what got them through yes it was faith it was faith in god they kept their mind on god that's what faith does to you faith does not give you all the answers how to solve the problems they still got solid asunder they still had to go through uh living in caves and they still went through things that will never ever have to go through but god kept them god had a peace god did not take his peace from them he left them with peace in their situation for their hour i may go through something tomorrow and your peace that you have today or my peace that i have today may not be there tomorrow just i'm just being honest with you i'm going to have to look for peace tomorrow i'm going to have to trust in the lord tomorrow i'm going to have to believe him for tomorrow because each day is the day of salvation each day we have to call on the lord what about daniel he prayed 21 days why didn't the angel say hey i heard you the first day you should have just shut up stopped you got to keep on pressing on we don't got answers for life situations in our life nobody knows where we're going nobody knows what we're feeling nobody knows what we're struggling and that's okay because we have a god that has a peace for us today we have a god that can make up the difference in our life that's all that matters he's with us i'll say today god has given us a peace second corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 we're getting ready to close very soon but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that's what they had inside of them to go through everything they went through that the excellency of the power may be of god and out of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not despair we are persecuted but not forsaken i wanted to read this for a moment because we will always feel forsaken by people but god will never forsake you cast down but not destroyed we have it it's inside of us when god said peace i'll leave with you he never said i'll leave it at the huntington bank and he never said you'll find it in that book you're reading or that tv or that whatever peace is in christ psalms 119 verse 165 great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them can you imagine going through the things that they went through and they weren't offended they were in love in love with god in love with the word and your great peace that comes from that when you when you love the word you love god you don't love the word you don't love god and it's it's a growing process there's things that there's still many things that god wants to tell me but i can't bear it yet i'm having a hard time brother i'm being faithful with what god's given me think about it brother john i want more peace psalms 34 14 says seek peace and pursue it pursue it sometimes it's just not going to drop there sometimes you just got to reach out and say lord i'm coming to you for peace ephesians 2 verse 14 says that jesus christ is our peace he is our peace he is the prince of peace he is the peace maker amen isaiah chapter 9 verse 7 of the increase of his government and peace an increase of the government and peace there shall be no end god has left us peace in this day in this hour for us there's peace today is there's peace for us now i can't give it to you and you can't give it to me i can comfort you and i can make you feel good you can comfort me and make you feel good not just say it i have been so blessed by some of the saints unworthy to be associated with such beautiful people on the planet i do believe the bride is the best wonderful people on the planet amen amen that's who god chose to marry but there comes a time that you need something that will hold you and that can only come from god he is our peace and we need to stay focused on giving god the honor where all peace comes from amen we're going to close here with this if that's true no it's not true but it's it's getting truer as we get to the end philippians chapter 4 verse 6. be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known to god don't leave anything up for chance don't leave anything up for assumption don't leave anything up for what god can't handle this one no in everything by prayer and supplication now notice with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god when you say thank you what you're really saying to god is i trust you and you're showing it by your spirit by your attitude and if you do that the bible says in verse 7 and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus amen finally brethren whatsoever things are true and honest and just and pure and lovely and of a good report if there's any virtue if there's any strength in these thoughts if there's any praise about them think on these things if it doesn't pass the word test get that thought out of you that's why i'm telling you the devil would like to take advantage of every situation and take you further than what it's meant to be those things which you both learned and received and heard and seen in paul do and the god of peace shall be with you can you say amen to the word amen amen just going to read our opening scriptures behold the hour cometh let us stand yea and it is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me these things have i spoken unto you that you might have peace so it's okay that's what jesus was saying it's okay because you're not alone i've spoken these things tonight that you might have peace that in christ you would have peace in the world you're going to have this stuff it doesn't speak anything about covet in the bible but we just need to be of good cheer anyways if he overcame in his situation and all these that we read about overcame we're going to overcome we're going to make it through peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid god has left us peace today that i want us to take the advice that jesus gave us let not your heart be troubled it was just advice that jesus gave we can take it we can hold to it these things have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace so let's just agree with the lord and take his advice and and take what he has left us amen let's look to the lord and prayer heavenly father we thank you today for leaving us peace you would not lie you cannot lie and lord we want to thank you for what you've made available lord as we going through our our tests and our trials lord we're always faced with the the hardships of our of doubts and fears that are associated with our trials they just seem to come coupled in and associated with all of our hardships so many of our hardships wondering fearing doubting questioning and we know that that view that comes with those that that natural view are things that cannot please you because without faith we can't please you so lord when our trials come when these problems come god would you give us the grace to hold your unchanging hand to trust in you regardless may we choose to trust you and believe and not set aside our thoughts for fear we don't know what's going to happen but we know that you hold what's going to happen and we want to thank you today that you've left us a peace and knowing that now pray for every heart for every situation i'll pray especially for my family for those lord that are hurting for the chanult family lord for the this greatest trial that we could go through of separation that you would bring your peace in this hour lord that you would grant all of us the peace of god and that you'd keep our hearts and our minds perfectly in harmony with you lord we thank thee for these things we trust you for them we give you praise for them and we are in debt to you

with god just out in the store just the other last week on the store i i didn't i didn't feel that i didn't feel the urge or not just to talk to him i just felt a push like this i got an actual push or pushed me over there and pushed me over there he was bending down looking at something and i walked through it says can i talk to you he said sure you talk to me i said can i pray for you and he walked through it he didn't want me to pray for him but the lord nudged me again and said go and ask him to pray for him again so i didn't i didn't get mad i just i just i said can i pray for you please he says sure you can pray for me so i prayed for him and he got out and he went to his car he was heaven i think he was having a bad day or something i don't know what he was having with some sort of bad day was heaven but he had a kind of a flower kind of an angry look on his face but when i got done praying for him he had a smile on his face you know we live in a world where there's a lot of odd people yeah just live for jesus do what he tells you to do we're going to be odd to them but the key is just doing what the lord asked you to do and and you can't go wrong or trying to
