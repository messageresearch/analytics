for the offerings a mother brother Jonathan could you just lead us in the prayer let's just stay standing as our brother gets ready to come and say I'll Fly Away amen how many ones it's waiting that day some glad morning when this life is oh oh wow I'll Fly Away oh to our home on Godzilla so sure how far away [Music] I'll Fly Away Oh Glory I'll Fly Away I won't die Hallelujah bye bye I'll Fly

by Empire Fly Away amen it's closer it's closer today than it's ever been that's for sure we don't we don't know when it's gonna happen but we do know where it's closer today amen and I believe the Bible says it's to him that endures to the end amen and that's what we're doing we've come to God's house to get strengthened to get fortified to help us with our our journey to get um what we need to help combat the enemy and so we can endure to the end because that's our goal we can't change the date whenever the Lord would would call us we don't know what we're going to go through the prophet said there would be a little squeeze the thing is we just want to have all that we can get of Christ so that whatever happens we know uh will be able to overcome amen because just just saying that were the elect does not give us power to overcome but because we're Overcomers proves that we're elected amen praise the Lord so good to see those of you in the house of the Lord today turn with me if you would to the Book of Proverbs chapter 4 verse 20. appreciate and feeling good enough to come today and help with the live stream I know there's some that are are watching in it and we just pray that God be with each family that's tuning in may the Lord just bless you with Revelation wherever you're at Brother Joseph Ben sends his greetings to all of you and he also requests our prayers he'll be traveling tomorrow to Lansing and he's going to be remaining there as he's going to school it's not as close as we wanted him to be but he's closer and he covets our prayers and he's looking forward to being with us just as often as he possibly can amen it sounds just a little bit a little bit loud can that sound like a little echo later what am I hearing hearing something fan that's it that is it who said fan another round all right praise the Lord before we begin reading in proverbs 4 let's look to the to the author of this precious book Heavenly Father we want to thank you that you called us out of sin you've called us out of the world and father that you set us upon a rock a solid rock and here we are today only by your grace Lord we thank you for the grace that you've bestowed upon us we thank you for the mercy that we wrote our life we thank you for the love that you still have for us today just as strong as you had the day that you called us Lord we thank you that our faults and our failures our mistakes haven't come between your love for us but Lord you just told us to repent and to to walk towards you and that Lord you would continue uh to keep us through this journey father and we thank you for that today we thank you for the saints that have gathered out for the saints that are watching we just pray that the Holy Spirit would come and give us the very word that you intended for us to have to help us with our walk with you father we commit it all to you Nash your blessings now on the reading of the word may come forth to each heart personally with revelation we pray in Jesus precious name amen amen Proverbs chapter 4 starting with verse number 20. my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings let them not depart from thine eyes but keep them in the midst of thine heart for there are for they are the our life unto those that find them I love that and health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee Ponder the paths of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from Evil amen God bless you may be seated well we want to continue on with motives and in part one we spoke on mixed Motors and we took the subject just trying to throw a seed into our hearts why do we do what we do she's trying to throw that out there because I think we feel that everything that we're doing is always for the right motives and um a lot of times it's not our Motors are selfish they they have to do with an agenda that we're trying to get to and we're not even being that considerate that it may not be the perfect will of God we also learned that we could be right in the uh the middle doing something that would be for God but we would have an ulterior motive for doing it and then that kind of cancels out that we're really doing the right thing okay right right didn't that he say did not Jesus said rather have your cold you know don't mix it don't mix the cold in the hot your will with God's will amen amen just do it because it's God's will and part two we want to title this message searching for our motives searching for our motives we want to dig a little deeper in discovering our motives instead of just assuming that they're all okay in order to as the Bible says here keep our hearts with all diligence in order to do that we must humble ourselves and just Ponder the path of our feet just I I know we're doing this we're supposed we're set out to do this and we're saying that this is the reason that we're doing it but take a minute and ponder it take some time and ponder it and a lot of times we we just want to take up like 30 seconds or you know two minutes and and and check her motive but that is not it sometimes it takes a lot more than that right amen and we make many decisions dozens of decisions every day behind those decisions is a motive and that's what we want to learn to make sure that our motive is only for God Amen right that it's it's just 100 percent God not well this is kind of what I have to do no if it's God's will you got to do it amen and if it's not God's will we want to step away amen foreign so searching are true intents it takes real courage it takes a courage it takes you got to be a strong Soldier because you're a lot of times when people really take time to look for their motives they're going to discover things that they didn't know were there right right because the devil is trying to hold hide back from us what's really going on right just like he's deceived the whole world and they're they're thinking that they're going to make it right they think they're going to make it in fact many will come to me on that day and say Lord Lord I should have made it because these credentials but their heart wasn't really all there for Christ so I just want to go through a couple bullets from last service the definition of a motive is simply the reason for doing something the reason for doing something especially one that is hidden or not obvious we've all experienced when we're talking to somebody we got a certain motive or certain objective that we're working with this one person to get what we want out of them without coming out and saying it now we're all guilty of that and some of us if I can say it like this we're professionals with it we're professionals we know how to talk about this but we're really going after this that's not going to help us and and really knowing our motives for other things because you develop habits right right and if you're developing a habit of hiding something over here you know that's just that's just a wrong spirit um now it's one thing and I just want to catch this because there's different it's this is a hard subject because there's not a lot of talk about it there's not a lot of information about it we do know that God hid Calvary from Lucifer the Bible tells us that if Lucifer would have known what what was going to come about he would have never done it and we do know that Jesus said that he hides the truth from the wise and the prudent but he also said that he will reveal it to obey someone who really wants to know so the the true nature of God is if someone is genuine and they really want to know God will show them but if no matter what they're going to do their own will no matter what they've got their own agenda well then you can't expect God to just lay it out for you and so this is hard subject of searching for our motives may be more difficult for some than others in harder at certain times for us than other times just depending on where our our heart is at amen the word objective means the thoughts and plans and efforts that we direct towards our end game towards our goal it's a strategic position to attain or purpose to achieve it might be something like this um brother Mark I want you to talk to brother Bob about uh his shoes being tied before he comes to church and uh really don't let him know I want you to talk to him yeah you're with me it's a strategic plan that Bob never knows what's behind what Mark's talking to him about and see this stuff happens all the time but we don't think about it we don't want to admit it we don't want to come to grips with it and before you know it it becomes our character the way that we are right and what we want to do is we want to break down those walls because these are the things that help initiate isms and schisms and favorites and and things like that when when you think when we get to heaven we're all going to be one all going to be one because that was the prayer that Jesus prayed with his disciples and and and for his disciples before he left and it is the goal that God has for us today and the way that we're going to get there is just just being more open and honest and not just hey if you if you think something is wrong with somebody that's okay you still gotta love them with the love of Christ they should you know the one thing they said about brother Brandon nobody could tell his enemies from his friends because he just loved everybody he just transparent with everybody I say if you if you have discovered something about somebody that's now your opportunity to help them shouldn't distract you from doing something or not doing something we said that any good that we could say or do would be in vain unless the motive of our heart was pure and right so here are these they were worshiping with their mouth they were praising us with their arm they were you know next to one another but their heart wasn't there and and so it was a vain situation this people draw nigh to me with their mouth and if they honor me at their lips but their heart isn't there so but in vain they do worship me so we could do a lot of things in vain if our mold of of what we're doing isn't pure and isn't right so God is looking for fruit from the things that we say the things that we're due looking for a fruit behind it our motives can easily be mixed with other motives for doing things and this is probably the most dangerous thing they can be mixed in other words we have a selfish desire about this situation but we're not going to talk about it we're not going to admit it what we're going to do is talk about this other reason because God's word says that we should do or the prophet said we should do it but yet we're going to get some sort of personal gain from the situation well automatically you're you've uh eliminated yourself from the blessing that you would be getting now that's what how the brother Branham taught it in the message so we have to make sure even though it is the will of God we got to make sure that our heart is I just want to do it to please the Lord I don't care about anything else and then you're uniting with God's Will and there's no chance for the flesh to get in amen amen what did Jesus say in the sermon to the churches at the end time I would that you were really either hot or cold I want you one way or the other way so and you how many times have have someone talked to you but you know that wasn't genuine what they were doing come on you know you know how that feels and you don't even feel comfortable around it right Jesus was saying if you don't put your heart into it I'd rather just have you go in the lust of your flesh in the world go do what you want to do because I only want a relationship that's genuine that's what really the Holy Ghost is saying to the to the church in this hour now the prophet taught us to check her motives to check our objectives amen and he gave us examples of pursuing good things but having a wrong reason for it or wanting to move mountains but Jesus for Jesus but but in ourselves we can't even move our flesh or our negative attitude out of the way right in a message brother Brandon spoke uh in in the message a paradox and I just want to read part of this quote he starts off by quoting Mark 11 22 he says if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what God Said will come to pass you can have what he said so I just as we're as we're reading this I I want us to to realize that the the the the very uh heart of of this message that we have today or the very subject is that God wants us to search our our motives and not assume that they're okay so in order to do that you have to keep asking yourself why why do you want to do why there's got to be a reason and not just well because of this because of the god no it takes much more so brother Brandon says but that takes motive and objective so he says you see this mountain be moved doubt not in your heart but whatever you say or come to pass he said but that takes motive and objective can you nobody's ever said that preachers will come up and say that they just say you gotta have faith to move that mountain but now he's bringing a a thought with this of course you've got to have a reason for it you can't have faith unless you got some reason as I tried to say last night some people's faith is in their textbook and some people's faith is in something else but it depends on where your faith is I want to believe God's word what he says is true then I've got to see whether it's his will or not see there's two different things you remember brother I'm talking about the three lights he's got a line it up so it's got to be his will and then I've got to see what my objective behind doing his will is really amen you know he has people some you know brother brother uh Ron was up here and he was talking about um asking if anybody wants to step in and help him uh clean uh while he's gone and when he comes back he'll resume the responsibility and you know how it is you ask somebody if they want to do something the first thing they want to say is well what is it it depends right and it's kind of like this with doing the will of God um uh it's the will of God but it depends whether I want to do it or not so he says I've got to see whether it's his will or not and then if it's his will I've got to check my objective to it and then my motive in doing it right and if I do it because I say well I'm going over the mountain here and there's a mountain before me and there's a million people on that side perishing and I got a hundred million here on this side I'm preaching to well if I can't get over and around or under the mountain or nothing and yet some things in my heart keep telling me go over the mountain go to them go to them and I can't get over now Jesus said they shall move this mountain yeah see now the thing of it is first what if I say go now first I never created that there so now he's getting he's searching where did that thought come from to go he's searching did I didn't think that that was coming from my desire so he's checking his flesh something created that it's for a good cause because why would I go to one million over there when a hundred million are here perishing on this side but it's something in my heart saying go over on that side tell the first thing I have to say well if I go over there this side can only pay me so much a month and over there see he said my motive is not right my objective is not right a lot of time when money has to do with something well the love of money is the root of so many things and who can who can know if they love money because we need money to pay bills we want money to pay bills so where is that fine line right it's very deceptive amen all right well what if I say no I don't care about the money but when I get over there someday the ages are calm they'll put up a great monument and say oh brother Branham was a great missionary he said then still my motive is not right because see here's another thing you know money can buy you a lot of stuff it's the one thing that can buy you a lot of stuff if you have enough money you can buy a lot you can buy popularity you can buy a lot of stuff with money without money um people still want popularity right they still want to be recognized for they still want other everybody wants to be loved I mean just naturally before we knew the Lord when you're growing up in our families we've felt we were being shortchanged right right and and we were being loved just a little bit less than our siblings or or those at school in the class or those on the team and we're just always looking for more I mean it's a natural thing so now this just opens the door for wanting something Beyond I just want to do as well I don't I don't want anything else see so brother Brian I'm saying here you the heart he said the heart the motive is is still not right but when I don't care if they ever know who went over there oh praise the Lord he's just in my heart then I'll speak to that mountain and it'll happen see if your motive is only I just want to please him I don't care how much it hurts I don't care what I get out of it I don't care how much I got to suffer then you know you're digging deep you're digging for the goat you're digging deep you're going to find out because God wants you to have confidence in what you're doing but see your motive in your objective depends on who you are and what business what that's where the church misses it so far they get worked up with an emotion and the first thing you know it's enthusiasm and you don't stop to check it before here again check there for sure then you'll know is thus saith the Lord see whether it's right now we find out again that Moses was in the line of duty and there he was at the Red Sea oh I love this word I just love this message it really teaches us what you can't find anywhere else turn with me if you would to the book of Acts chapter 19. I know you got you brought your Bibles with you praise the Lord for that Acts chapter 19 there was a situation in the book of Acts where some people wanted the benefits of Christ without having a close relationship with Christ and this is a typical Temptation that many many people have starting with verse 11 and God brought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought onto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons uh and disease and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them so this was a real uh real Miracles and and the Bible calls them special Miracles by the hands of Paul then certain of the vagabond a Jews now these are wandering strolling around just no place no um no accountability no headship no just wandering around and they were EX exorcists they took upon them notice took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure You by Jesus who we don't know it's you know who we really don't know whom Paul preacheth and there were seven sons of either a Jew a chief chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirits answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirits was leaped on them and overcame them failed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also drawn the Ephesus and fear fell on them all in the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified and many uh many that believe came confessed and showed their deeds now here these men were wanting to accomplish some good doing the right thing same as Paul was doing and and same as Jesus taught in my name they'll cast out devils but their motive was wrong it wasn't pure for Christ it was mixed something was in it for them and when we're searching for our motive we've got to confess Lord if I don't get anything out of this I want to do it and I'll tell you when you don't get things out of it and nobody knows about it you're most likely not to do it right I'm just talking Human Nature these men were not humble men they were not pondering the paths of their feet they were not keeping their heart with all diligence they didn't need Jesus they didn't need a relationship with Jesus but they just wanted to gain something from the name of Jesus wow wow maybe they began to say within themselves we have Abraham as our father they were they were they were Jews right right they were proud arrogant Wanderers and notices they took upon themselves to do this it wasn't God telling to do it they took upon themselves to do it and the the reason I'm sharing this these the scripture is I'm wanting us to be more careful about wanting to search our our motives a bit instead of just assuming all the time 100 they're right they're right they're right if they're right why aren't we serving one another more why aren't we laying down our life why don't we the prophet said that eternal life is living for others what does that mean and how and where do we see that where do we see that in our life how many times did the denominations want to host a meeting announcing brother Branham we want we're going to have brother Brandon he's going to be with us but they didn't want brother pranam to preach his Doctrine they didn't want him to talk about what the women had to do their ABCs they didn't want to get into certain aspects of the ministry of the word of God they only wanted brother Branham to pray for the sick because then it was something that they could rally behind this is no different than they did with Jesus they wanted Jesus to to feed them to heal them they were they would rally behind that but when he began to give them the word it began to separate the people from Jesus did it not amen it did and and here's the thing we've got to be all in for Christ it does not matter what he puts us through uh whatever he puts us through it's for our good amen amen and he's trying to do something in her life now let's just say my motive is wrong in a certain situation let's say I'm trying to take advantage of brother Mark and uh I uh I tell brother Mark I'm in a bad way brother Mark I I I just I need you to do all these things for me but my motive was just to try to get him to do what I want him to do now that cannot be pleasing to the Lord is that true okay now let's just take this a step further me as your pastor you probably wouldn't want me doing that would you not Okay so would you not want me to John would you please take a moment and check your motives make sure you're doing the right thing that's what we're trying to get more in our lives I want to ask this question I just want you to be honest with me how many has thought more about your motive since the last service okay okay now before that time and God bless you for doing that now before that time how much did you think about it and see see here with a wrong motive we're going to get in trouble I can tell you everything that was God's will for me to do and I did it for the right reason always worked out but everything that I did for me yeah I'm getting something out of it it did never it never worked it never prospered because God is not going to share his glory with my flesh thank you so this this idea of checking our motives may seem like something we were never taught by our mother and father but it is something that we need to do be because it was the counsel of the Prophet he's the one that told us to do it amen how many times did they tell brother Rand they loved him but they really didn't he knew that they didn't want to check their motives too often Believers think it's not relevant to check their motives not that important or they get spiritual lazy and they don't want to do it or they're just too proud to check their Motors there's always a reason that enemy will use to keep us from going down this path to really Ponder our motives but when we see someone do something that isn't just right something that we makes us question we don't have a problem of questioning their motive we'll question somebody else's motive much more than we'll question our own right now you tell me what that is when we're taught by the message to give the benefit of the doubt towards somebody and we're taught by the message to check our own motor but it said reverse it's because of the nature that we have and so the reason I'm bringing this out is it's understandable that we're not checking our motives a lot it's understandable but we've got to combat that force of nature that we're born with and even though we're we're born again it doesn't mean though that that nature can't uh try to take control over us the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and then that that it's to me the the uh 2023 uh John Martin interpretation of that is I could be wrong I could be wrong let's check it out that's how we keep our hearts with diligence is to to make sure that this is I'm doing this for the right reason to check our Motors our objectives and everything that we do everything that we pursue it can't be just because amen it it has to be it's only because it's his will I don't care how much I can and I'll tell you when you're in the will of God it will never ever take you away from God will never show you his will and tell you to do as well and take you away from God never never no matter what happens it just it just it will not happen it's a real indication to know because in other words God will not put anything on you that you can't bear he's not going to put you in a position that you can't handle it he that's just not God yeah yeah that's right he'll take you right to that limit for sure but how many times people use excuses I can't do this I can't do this I I can't do this and it's all the will of God but they can't do it because of this that just we we've got to mature and we we the one way to help us mature is to be checking our motives searching our own motive is honestly the hardest thing to do is one of the hardest things to do if not the hardest and that's because there's a a prideful force in our in our human nature that depicts being challenged about anything that we're doing or that we're setting to do I mean even James said that that we should never say I'm going to go here and I'm going to do this I'm going to do that but it should always be if it be the will of the Lord that's right but man has this this nature about him that he's always right Proverbs 21 verse 2 tells us every way of a man is right in his own eyes so his motive is right in his own eyes but the Lord pondereth the hearts Proverbs 12 verse 15 says the way of a fool is even right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth unto wise counsel unto counsel is wise and I believe brother Branham has given his counsel to check her motives and I think it's a wise thing to do no matter how much we think our motive is good check it no matter how much we think we're right check it no matter how much we see that it's the will of God doing the will of God check your motive always check your motive you can't not go wrong in fact we may think it's a waste of time but God is pleased with it God is pleased with that attitude he is never pleased with us assuming David said keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins thinking that what I'm doing is okay a man literally has to defy the prideful force of nature inside of himself to check his own nature that's how hard it is he has the humble himself under the mighty hand of God he has to consider that what he's doing he could be wrong right amen Pride wrote some things down here haughtiness arrogancy hatred lust bitterness grudges will absolutely blind a Believer and keep him from seeing his own true motives it doesn't matter if something happened yesterday to you or something that happened 10 years ago to you these things block us from seeing our motives we think about the uh the little bird that was always tied and he tried to fly away and every time he tried to fly away his he was tied to that stake and he could only go so far and he hit the ground he'd hit his face in the dirt and he said man this I'm never going to get anywhere and he finally just decided to quit trying and the man came by and he cut the very string that was holding him back but the bird was so uh psychologically uh in his mind thinking that he would never get away no matter what he didn't even try and I'll say it like this we can become psychologically tied to I'm always right I'm always right I'm always right you know we'll fight even when we're wrong even when we know we're wrong we'll sometimes we'll fight because we're unwilling to give in to our spouse or to somebody or our employer our employees come on Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9. man's heart is very deceptive this is why we got to check our motives the heart is deceitful Above All Things and desperately wicked we might just say selfish and who can know it what a question who can know it who can stand and say I know my heart but yet we'll say yeah I'm right what I'm doing I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his way and according to the fruits of his doing the Lord is the one that searches we're the ones I don't get this far I want to get to this and say it if you really really want to know your motive you got to ask God to help you see it sir amen because he's the only one that can show you what's in there think about all the times you thought you were right about something and then found out you were wrong yeah many times and and when we found out we were wrong what did we do at that moment what do we usually do we just we we go as if nothing happened that's what we usually do because it's no big thing it's only a big thing if the other person's wrong then it's a really big thing then we got a problem here we're gonna talk about it but when we're wrong hey sorry it's what you see what I'm saying so look there's many I I said that to say this there's times that we're we're wrong and we don't even know it and if we really want to know we've got to ask God to help us God I know I know I got a revelation my heart is so wicked [Laughter] I got a revelation of your word that my heart is deceitful Above All Things look at laodicea in need of nothing they were so much in need but they're so deceived we need to ask God God help me to see what my motive here help me if I I'm trying to get something out of this that's for me and I think that that humble contriteness is what opens the door for God to share with you what's really going on because as soon as you know that your motive isn't right you'll you'll repent if you if you've taken the time to ask God what your motive is when he shows you you will repent but you won't repent if you don't take time to ask him even if God preaches it to you that's right because the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of the heart and when God does deliver it to you if you're still not asking you won't repent right because your your heart is not wanting it see it God only works through three more agency and you've got to want what he wants you've got to want what God's will is for your life I love this word a Believer who thinks it doesn't take much effort to know their own motives is too proud it takes a lot of effort I mean it if scripture is true that it's very deceptive very Wicked and all as you we think is that Lord remember to write and then then we're we're actually saying that that that that that Wicked heart can just you know turn on a dime and I know that we've been converted I understand that but since my conversion I've done a lot of evil things come on so that we can't hide behind while I'm born again I'm converted yeah I'm a born-again converted doing bad things that's another reason for me to check my motives so when we're searching out are our very true motive for doing what we're doing we need to cry out to God say God search me try me see if there be some Wicked way in me we sing about it let's put it into practice I mean when's the last time you said oh uh Wicked yeah Wretched Man that I am who who who can deliver me from this body of Flesh when's the last time that we've viewed ourselves as is is such a a low degree that it puts us on our knees um I'm not talking about feeling bad and and and somebody pouncing on you and making you feel not I'm not talking about that I'm just talking about self evaluation this flesh will never ever glory in his presence this flesh is not going to enter the Kingdom of Heaven There is a difference between the spiritual man and the old man amen now when a man thinks all he has to do is spend a few minutes thinking about what he's doing and call that I checked my motive he's missed it a man is deceived and thinking his carnal nature isn't that very deceptive you can't figure it out whether your motor's right God God if you don't bring God in on the scene you can't imagine what he what he thinks about that right when his word says you do need me when I try the heart I'm not saying that you don't know your heart because maybe God showed you about something I'm not saying that but I'm talking about the many things that isn't the devil has opportunity to to get in there and and twist things up he has the ability to twist things in her mind and make us look at certain things and not other things he has the ability to point out that there are certain aspects and and camouflage our own selfishness in this situation our own hidden agenda true amen and then we don't want to talk about it well God wants us to talk about to him that's what he wants to check what our true motive is it requires God he's the only one that knows our heart right how many times we heard we don't judge any because we don't know their heart only God knows their heart right well we don't know our heart either only God knows this amen I quoted it but let's go there Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12. for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edges sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit and the joints in the mirror and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart I have to say I can't do that I can't do that I have questioned myself and I'm okay with it because I got I got scripture and I got a message and I'm not going to act like I don't need to do it but God is faithful I believe that he comes hear and he discerns what's going on now when we look at the scripture and we think about coming to church and we want God to speak to us something that only we and him know just kind of confirm this is this is on my heart God knows I didn't talk to anybody and the word comes and he speaks and then we say yes God was there and God was there and he discerned the heart and he spoke but what about when God comes here and he unveils some things that are in our heart that should be there we don't have the same attitude we don't have that same yes Lord I want you to discern it so you see it requires humility God I've got to hear from you I've got to hear I've got to see that what I'm doing is exactly what you want me to do if that's not there when the word comes and it speaks to us it'll go right over our head it'll be like water off a duck's back and will never think that God was there I'll tell you that what I love about the scripture here is God is not going to leave us in church without speaking to us I don't care what our background is I don't care what we're going through God is there to speak to us the Bible says in verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto him of Unto unto the eyes of him of whom we have to do in our whole lives are in his hands amen now motives uh can be easier to detect for the most part than what meets the eye I'm not trying to be contrary to what I've been saying but I want to try to give you some pointers moldas are usually either selfish or they're for others right that's it and any motive that's for yourself you need to be real careful right but when your motive is for others which brother Branham taught us that eternal life is living for others and I say that's why brother Brian could say Mission workers always in the will of God when your motive is for to do God's will we can always say that right we can always say well I'm doing this because God wants me to this is God's will but if you're in it if you're getting anything out of it you need to be sure but if it's for somebody else and you're not getting anything out of it you see there's no selfishness there none your motive is pure your motive is right in this age when then people are falling away the love of many is waxing cold people don't don't have time enough to help others because they're so busy swallowing up with their own life and if they're not swallowed up with their own problems they're trying to get ahead of the Joneses are you with me and there's no end to that there's no end to that so somewhere down the line I believe the elect got a balance they got a balance and we need to be spending our time getting Soul saved are you with me all right all right first John we're going to have to hurry because time is is is getting away from us first John chapter 3 verse one checking our motives ought to be on a consistent basis not just once in a while so let's say I checked my motive about Lord should I be preaching are you sure are you sure Lord you want me to preach I think that motive needs to be checked often come on look I am never going to give a reason not to check your motive it just ain't gonna come from me it ain't gonna come from from behind this Pulpit when I'm here I think the righteous or as bold as a lion but I don't think they're arrogant there's there's a difference I feel that we constantly need to be checking our most kid at any time the devil can get in there right it's the truth amen it's not so much is it the will of God for me to be preaching but is my heart where it needs to be right now when I'm preaching amen you understand the difference yes it's not like the Revelation comes and goes but the enemy can get in there all right first John chapter 3 verse 1 beloved what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God even though it does not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we're going to be like him and we're going to see him as he is now what does this do for us verse 3 unveils this every man that have this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure and you're checking your motive you're getting it when you when you find a wrong motive you are a praise God because you're doing something that you normally don't do right when you find out you got a wrong motive you get caught with something something was wrong you just want to kind of just not talk about it let's just get over let's just go into something else let's change the subject but you're not learning you may think you're learning but you're not learning right this this process of purifying yourself it's a real process and when you when you're checking your motives nobody knows about it right this is between you and God this is how you purify yourself you don't need somebody else to tell you you're doing wrong all the time that's what the Holy Ghost is for you have no need that any man teach you but the holy ghost that dwelleth in you he teaches you all things now he's saying check your motives work with me work with me praise the Lord all right first John chapter 4 verse one beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are going out into the world I remember many years ago it's just I'm talking many years ago I was just a young believer and I heard brother Hankins speak on this and it just about blew my top when I heard it he said you even it doesn't matter if it's God or a demon you try the spirit I thought who am I to try God but you don't know who it is that's why you're trying it and after you learn that it's God then you reference it you reverence God but here's the thing how many times do we take time to try the spirits that come and speak to us that entices to do this that lead us to do that it isn't just God trying to lead us you got a demon that's trying to lead you off track all the time and if it's not one it's another and if it's not another it's another if it ain't through this person it's through that person look what happened to job's wife leading them off the path I mean the devil is real he'll use whatever weak vessel he can to speak to you but just think about your own thoughts the Devil Wants wants us to be in the flesh wants us to walk in the carnality of our ourself he wants to distract Us by everything that can distract Us in this world and there's a lot of problems in this world there's the good there's the bad and there's ugly you got them all you got stuff that appeals to you you got stuff that's bad and then you got some pretty ugly stuff but the devil wants to distract you with it there's a spirit of air that will cause us to air from our walk with Christ and where we were walking real close with him we had intentions we had desires we're we're strong and then all sudden we're allowing this are you with me all right then there's a spirit of truth and the Bible says when he comes he will lead and guide you into all truth now friends we're not there yet I say to the send the light church we are not there yet we can say the light has come the message has come but we don't have it all yet I'm not manifesting all of Christ yet I'm not living for all of of others yet are you with me so that word try believe not every Spirit but try the spirits that word try means to test to prove out to discern or to examine so I want to ask you when's the last time that you tried a spirit that came to you now if I was to ask you when's the last time you tried somebody else's spirit just wonder how often we do this how often we think we already know that there's no need to discern discern because I'm already know that I'm right how many feel like you just you're you're willing to dig a Little Deeper amen this this this message is is not to hurt us Hammer us it's to get us to mature you know I see people that are so old in this message that would are 10 feet they they One Touch check in their own attitude their own spirit with a ten foot pole because they're scared about what they're going to find but you know if you're right you you could spend three hours talking about it you could literally spend three hours talking about it to somebody if you know that your motive is right because I don't I've honestly I don't care how much I fail I don't care how many mistakes I make here I don't care if I say the wrong words I don't misunderstand me I don't want to do that but if I said everything perfect but my motives were wrong if God used a seventh grade education to bring the message of this hour I don't think he's too much wanting to display dignity to the bride I think he's more interested in the real being real amen all right just another quote I know it's it's time very close to being time this is in the message the spoken word is the original sin I just want to I you take time when you get home to read the next six verses there in John which we did not read Saint John chapter 1 uh Chapter 4 verses 1 through 6 or 7 and you'll see there's a a learning there of how to check your motives how to know your motor so in searching for a mold is be sure that it's God's will first and then check what your motive is behind doing it in other words don't just say well I'm doing it because it's God's will because I can do God's will and do it for me I've got to just do it only because it's God's will amen all right spoken word is Original Seed now it's a it's rough friend it's very rough I don't mean to be that myself yeah I I hope you understand that but today I'm given the expression of why I have did the things that I've done and now for just a little analysis before we dismiss for lunch that is I want you to know that this has been my motive and my objective is God's word my motive is to please him and I can't listen to everything and believe God's word now I want to read that again I can't listen to everything and believe God's word neither can I listen to everything and please God my motive is to know his word and to please God by serving him by his word now every person here that's been born of the spirit of God that's in the elect group was perhaps once a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal or something another somewhere now you know that you know that so then you see when you say go out to them that's what you have to do there's somebody in there if you'll sow the seed there'll be a harvest someday some of it will go by and say oh there's nothing but he's a Deceiver didn't they say the same thing about our Lord there's nothing to that and then why don't you check it with me nothing but a Deceiver then check it with the word if it isn't the word then it's deceiving now if your theology is different from the word then it's then it isn't right now others will go by and say well you know what I believe I'll try it a while he said you'll choke you can't try it for a while you have to be sold out but when you're really empty out and say Lord Jesus no more of me but you from this on see then it's going to bring forth a hundred fold you believe that congregation says amen I believe it too with liberty and justice for all that's right yes sir I pledge my allegiance to my Lord see to the to preach his word and to stand on his truth if it'll cost me my life I'll still go on just the same it would be a great thing for me not wanting to do it but if I had to if I had to do it I would mingle my blood in this earth like those who mingled their blood for the same thing like those who died in the pits of the lions like those who died on crosses those who were sawed asunder that were kicked out of their organizations and wondered about in sheepsins goats skins and destitute it would be a great privilege for me as the disciple of Christ returned back and had counted all joy because they were able to stand the reproach that brought on his name they could suffer that for him there's there are little suffering I don't want to suffer nobody wants to suffer but I would like to join my hands with all the denominations and say brother let's go I'd like to do that I would I'd like to take my hand I'm sorry if I do so he's trying to say he can't go with the denominations I would like to join my hands with the denomination and say brother let's go but if I do that I'd like to do that but if I do that I take my hands out of his far be it from ever doing that I stand alone I stand with him his word for as Eddie parat said on Christ the solar Rock I stand all their ground is sinking sand and Christ is the word amen so we're going to have to stand alone if we're a person that is going to be uh easily motivated by others it's going to be hard to walk with the Lord and it's going to be hard to know your true motives so take what our the prophet said and let your motive be only God's word if you if there's an instant of getting something out of it just a teeny little bit if there's anything to get out of it get away from it I say get away from it pursue something where you get nothing out of it and you'll find the Lord there I believe that so I just got a few bullets here and and and and Cheryl you can come if you'd like I just want to say in search for our true Motors you first must desire to know it above all costs if you if that desire to really know what isn't there you might as well forget this whole message you've got to want to know it because it's going to cost you to spend more time with God In Prayer it's going to take more than just a a quick check or three minutes here or this it's going to take some soul searching amen confess openly let it be real to you I could be wrong about this if that's not there in anything I think you got to check your spirit then begin to try the spirits ask the questions the hard questions why am I really choosing to do this is this for his kingdom for his people for his church for Souls did he really tell me to do this or is this something I'm wanting to do and these questions will open the door for a communication between you and God so he can show you really what the motive is and that's what it's all about keeping your motor pure is going to keep us out of trouble down the road amen let's Stand Together I think always think of of Balaam who so bad wanted to do his will and trying to make it God's will kept pursuant until it happened but it wasn't and he he just should have fell in love with God's Will and not been tempted to get anything out of it and we must learn to just pursue this I say Saints with all your heart I know that we may not be used to doing this it it it we may have spent a little time with it but let's in our personal walk with the Lord our personal time with the Lord our personal prayers just ask God to unveil to you the true motives behind everything that you're asking for everything that you're wanting to do everything that you're unwilling to do you know why aren't you why aren't you willing to help brother Ron out why what is that motive or if somebody asks you to do so what is that motive so I think this will help our growth don't you amen let's just bow in a word of our heavenly father Lord I Thank you for your people I thank you that they they love you they love your word and Lord we all have this hope in us that one day we're going to be like you Lord if we would remain here to your coming we have the promise as your elect your beloved that we will be just like you when you appear in that nature in that character in in manifesting you in our normal everyday lives father I pray that you would give us such discernment Lord when we call upon you for it when we humble ourselves to you and say God would you would you just help me to see to make sure that I'm on the right path Lord would you just come and open our eyes help us to see what things we may have to take care of Lord not pray that you would just bless us with such a maturity here as we grow Lord in you help us in our interaction with one another help us to always give the benefit of the doubt to one another Lord if we're going to question help us to question ourselves father help us to do those things that are pleasing to you father I we pray that you'd be with the hearts of those that couldn't be here tonight we just ask that your your presence would be with them in their homes we pray that you'd be with our precious brother Marty and Lord is his son his daughter their spouses and their children and Lord all the loved ones of our of our precious sister and our brother may you you be with him in this hour may they find consolation and comfort to the word of God May the holy spirit that dwell in them continue to comfort them day by day as they Lord will all need you day by day granted Heavenly Father we commit ourselves to you and as the body Believers Lord we love you we thank you for these things in Jesus Christ's precious name we pray amen amen

wonderful testimony I was praying that the Lord would show me my motive and he showed me it was wrong that is a glorious testimony I think that's what we need we we need testimonies that the word is making an impact in our life amen it it don't always have to be about some glorious thing that on the outside it can be something that's gloriously happening on the inside character is changing amen
