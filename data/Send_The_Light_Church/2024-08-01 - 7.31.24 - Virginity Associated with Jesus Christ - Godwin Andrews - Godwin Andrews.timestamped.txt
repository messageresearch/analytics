[35:40] that changes us not the delivery of the
[35:43] word but the word amen so we just want
[35:46] to welcome our brother to come and give
[35:48] us the bread of life
[35:52] oh
[35:54] believe only
[35:58] [Music]
[36:00] all things are
[36:03] possible only
[36:05] [Music]
[36:35] shall we turn to our
[36:37] Bible Ephesians chap
[36:41] 5 beginning with verse 25 to the end of
[36:45] the
[36:46] chapter verse
[36:50] 33 Ephesians chap
[36:54] 5 beginning with verse 25
[36:58] five
[37:00] husbands love your
[37:03] wives even as Christ also loved the
[37:06] church and gave himself for it that he
[37:10] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[37:14] washing of Water by the word amen that
[37:18] he might present it to
[37:20] himself a glorious church not having a
[37:25] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[37:30] that it should be holy and without
[37:35] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[37:39] as their own bodies he that loves his
[37:43] wife loves
[37:45] himself for no man ever yet hated his
[37:50] own flesh
[37:52] but nourishes and cherishes even as the
[37:57] Lord God the
[37:59] church for we are members of his body
[38:03] and of his flesh and of his
[38:07] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[38:10] his father and mother and shall be
[38:14] joined to his wife and they two shall be
[38:19] one
[38:20] flesh this is a great
[38:23] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[38:26] and the church
[38:29] nevertheless let every one of you in
[38:33] particular so love his wife even as
[38:37] himself and the wife see that she
[38:41] reverence her husband amen may the Lord
[38:45] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[38:48] holy word amen shall we bow our heads in
[38:52] prayer our gracious loving Heavenly
[38:55] Father
[38:57] this is our
[38:59] privilege that you have enabled us to
[39:02] gather together in the name of Jesus
[39:05] Christ to worship you and to ponder over
[39:09] your words which are a lamp unto our
[39:12] feet and a light unto our part and
[39:15] father we pray that you will help us as
[39:18] David said in Psalm
[39:21] 119 verse
[39:23] 11 that I have hid your word in my heart
[39:28] that I sin not against thee father we
[39:32] pray this evening that you will help us
[39:36] that we may hide your word in our hearts
[39:40] that we walk a life which is worthy in
[39:43] your sight for we know that our life on
[39:47] this Earth is coming to an end pretty
[39:50] soon and Lord your coming is very near
[39:53] so we want to lead a life which is holy
[39:58] and perfect and biblical in your sight
[40:02] Lord that through our Lives Many people
[40:06] who have not known this truth who are
[40:09] walking in darkness amen may know the
[40:12] name of Jesus and come to the light and
[40:16] receive the life Everlasting amen Jesus
[40:19] we commit each one of us into your hands
[40:22] we pray that you will sanctify every
[40:24] heart and prepare our heart to receive
[40:27] your word word in Jesus name we pray
[40:30] amen you may be
[40:38] seated I de it a great
[40:41] privilege for me to be able to come to
[40:46] this
[40:46] fellowship and the body of Christ which
[40:50] is a part of the body which is bur
[40:53] over
[40:55] and I'm very certain that the Lord has
[41:00] given me a good health even at the age
[41:05] of
[41:06] 87 and Lord has enabled me to travel to
[41:11] various places in my own country and I
[41:15] have preached the word practically all
[41:18] of
[41:18] India and we have many congregations in
[41:22] different states that are functioning
[41:26] under uh 45
[41:29] Pastors
[41:31] in a state called Andra Pradesh which is
[41:34] part of central India
[41:37] and we have nearly 200 churches in that
[41:41] particular
[41:43] State uh and in other parts of India we
[41:46] have uh here and there and in the city
[41:50] of Kolkata of course I'm very sorry that
[41:54] I have been there in that City for for a
[41:57] long
[41:58] time I came to Kolkata in
[42:02] 1969 and as a pastor and district
[42:05] superintendent of the Methodist Church
[42:08] at that time I did not know the
[42:10] message but the message came to me in
[42:15] 1974
[42:17] and I was given this s churches book by
[42:23] a minister from the salvation
[42:28] Army he believed the message but because
[42:31] of circumstances
[42:33] and difficulties faced by the financial
[42:38] difficulties faced by the ministers he
[42:41] still stuck to the Salvation Army
[42:44] because in a denomination you have the
[42:47] guarantee of your salary but when you
[42:50] are not in a denomination there is no
[42:53] guarantee so anyway he gave me the book
[42:56] and that convinced me and I started
[43:00] preaching the same message in the
[43:01] Methodist Church and people were very
[43:05] disturbed because since 1969 until 74
[43:10] everything was
[43:11] peaceful but since I started preaching
[43:14] the
[43:15] message uh the baptism in the name of
[43:18] Jesus Christ godhead and all that people
[43:21] started writing letters against me to
[43:23] the bishop and Bishop wouldn't say
[43:27] anything but Bishop was not present in
[43:31] Kolkata the whole of India was divided
[43:34] as regards the Methodist Church was
[43:36] concerned in four
[43:38] divisions and our division was the
[43:40] Eastern Division and the headquarter of
[43:44] the bishop was
[43:45] about uh 600 miles away from Kolkata so
[43:50] once in a blue moon he would come to
[43:52] Kolkata so when he came to Kolkata he
[43:54] showed me the letters which were written
[43:56] by my congregation people and he said
[44:01] these are your love letters read them so
[44:05] I read them and I felt that it is people
[44:10] are not to be blamed because it is their
[44:13] ignorance they don't know the
[44:15] scure and we should teach them the Bible
[44:20] so our service would begin at 10:00 in
[44:23] the morning I Chang it to 9:00
[44:27] I said from 9 to 10:30 we will have the
[44:31] church service regular church service
[44:33] and from 10:30 we will have a Bible
[44:37] study class every Sunday up to to 12:00
[44:42] midday and people were very excited that
[44:47] this was something new which was being
[44:49] started in the church never done before
[44:52] so I said you cannot me when I'm on the
[44:56] ppit
[44:57] you have to listen to me but when I'm
[45:01] across the table you can ask me any
[45:03] question you want to and I will give you
[45:05] the answer from the Bible that
[45:09] way people were
[45:11] satisfied that my steps were
[45:14] correct and I was taking this stand on
[45:18] the Bible not on the
[45:21] denominational Constitution and all that
[45:24] the denominational Constitution says you
[45:26] have to bapti children but the Bible
[45:30] doesm bapti children so I sto baptism
[45:34] and that was one reason people were
[45:36] angry that he has sto the child baptism
[45:40] so I told Bishop you are bishop and you
[45:44] know more Bible than I do and I would
[45:48] like you to show me at least one verse
[45:49] in the Bible supports the child
[45:53] baptism and
[45:54] he so he realized
[45:58] he was on a wrong foot so he said well
[46:02] you are a minister you know how to
[46:04] control your congregation I it to you so
[46:09] whatever you think is right do it I'm
[46:12] not against you that the bishop me
[46:16] permission toe whatever IED to pre and
[46:20] then things subsided and because of the
[46:23] Bible study after 2 years nearly 12
[46:28] people got ready to be baptized in the
[46:30] name of the
[46:31] Lord and it was July 7th
[46:37] 1978
[46:38] when we were baptized in the name of the
[46:41] Lord and I was the first one then my
[46:45] wife followed and the other members and
[46:49] five others stood up right there when
[46:52] the baptism ceremony was going on they
[46:55] said we also would like to be baptized
[46:58] so in a lot 17 were baptized all
[47:01] together Lord and this
[47:06] was by a pastor from New Zealand maybe I
[47:10] don't know whether you know brother
[47:13] Regional sh from New
[47:16] Zealand he was an old man and in 1978
[47:21] when he came to Kolkata he said his age
[47:25] was 72 years old at that time so in
[47:29] 78 and his wife was also
[47:33] there so he was ministering somewhere in
[47:37] nor and the Holy Spirit spoke to him and
[47:40] him go to
[47:41] Kata anded times he said ibody
[47:49] inata he hearkened to the voice of the
[47:52] Lord and he decided to change his Ro
[47:56] from way to New Zealand he came Kata he
[48:00] came to Kata and he looked for me
[48:05] because in one of his diary he had my
[48:07] name I had written him one letter once
[48:11] only because of the track which he had
[48:14] written what baptized
[48:19] so I had acknowledged and told him that
[48:23] I agree with your teaching and I'm quite
[48:26] satisf what you have written in
[48:28] this pamphlet so that way he had my
[48:32] address in his diary so he wrote me a
[48:35] letter from Norway that this thing has
[48:39] happened with me the holy spirit is
[48:41] telling to go to Kata but I don't know
[48:43] why I should go to Kata but I'm coming
[48:45] to Kata and I'm coming by such and suche
[48:50] I will do my all hotel bookings you
[48:52] don't worry about that but I will be
[48:54] there for 3 days
[48:56] and so we received him and at the
[49:00] airport
[49:01] and uh we hired a taxi to come to the
[49:04] city it's about 10 mil away from the
[49:07] city the
[49:08] airport so in a taxi he still says I
[49:12] have come but I don't know why I have
[49:15] come then I told him the whole story
[49:19] how people are ready for baptism in the
[49:22] name of the Lord and we didn't know whom
[49:24] to call because I not known to any end
[49:27] time believer so we were praying Lord s
[49:31] somebody and you are the answer to our
[49:33] prayers amen so he was very happy we
[49:38] arranged some meetings for him for 3
[49:40] days and on the third
[49:43] day we had requested a Baptist Church to
[49:48] Lear their baptistry because in the
[49:50] meist church we didn't have the
[49:52] provision for immersion baptism so that
[49:56] Pastor of course there is a long story
[49:58] for that also how
[50:01] he with great difficulty agreed because
[50:04] I had shared that pamphlet of brother sh
[50:08] to him also he was sitting in his porch
[50:11] and I was there request him to give his
[50:15] Baptist so I just handed over that track
[50:18] to and when he saw that I giving a track
[50:22] on baptism to a Baptist minister
[50:26] so he laughed and he said thank you
[50:31] very I said taking his name he was
[50:37] a doctor of theology reti reg of the
[50:42] University of theological college
[50:46] and I took his name I said
[50:51] Dr if you go through this track a
[50:55] genuine than you will come out of your
[50:58] m not a sarcastic way of thank you as
[51:02] you
[51:03] have he said is it so I said yes I'm
[51:07] going to it now said go ahead sit
[51:11] here he through and he just reved how
[51:15] can this be this is talking only in
[51:19] Jesus name he is avoiding the father
[51:23] avoiding the Holy Ghost how can we avoid
[51:26] it
[51:27] I said he not avoiding
[51:29] anybody he including the Father the Son
[51:33] and the Holy Ghost the name is one that
[51:36] is Jesus Christ anyway he wouldn't agree
[51:40] with the track but he said you write an
[51:44] application give me to to the committee
[51:48] I will present it and if the committee
[51:51] agrees then you will get the
[51:54] baptistry so while writing the
[51:56] application I said if I write that we
[52:00] are going to be baptized according to
[52:02] acts 238 they may not give
[52:05] us
[52:07] so I said Lord what should I write in
[52:10] this application so I wrote you will
[52:13] bead to know because they are happy with
[52:15] the immersion baptism the Methodist CH
[52:18] doesn't do that so if you do an emotion
[52:21] baptism they are happy because it is
[52:24] something like their baptism they did
[52:28] not know the difference between acts 238
[52:30] and Matthew
[52:32] 2819 so I wrote in the application you
[52:35] will be glad to know that certain
[52:38] Methodist people have decided to be
[52:41] baptized according to the
[52:46] scripture that way they could not catch
[52:50] what we intended to do so they
[52:55] considered the application and they said
[52:57] all right we will give you the baptistry
[53:00] and so the baptistry was very nice you
[53:03] know uh they had the old baptistry right
[53:06] here in front of the
[53:07] pulpit but they had made a new baptistry
[53:10] which was in the wall over here so the
[53:13] whole congregation could see the whole
[53:17] process of going how the baptism is
[53:19] taking place right here on the top so
[53:23] while sated everybody could see and hear
[53:27] what the question is being asked from
[53:29] the candidate and what answer he is
[53:31] giving so that way our baptism took
[53:35] place on 7th July
[53:38] 1978 and
[53:40] theref until I left the Methodist Church
[53:43] in
[53:44] 82 nearly 80 people were baptized in the
[53:48] name of the Lord Jesus
[53:49] Christ and the Lord continued to bless
[53:52] me and of course after I left the
[53:54] Methodist Church I had to leave my
[53:57] Bungalow and every facility that was
[54:00] given by the Methodist Church and I
[54:02] didn't have a place to go so some
[54:05] brother who was a faith brother so he
[54:08] helped me to get a place which is also
[54:12] still a Methodist property but it was
[54:14] under his control so he gave me
[54:17] Methodist CH was again angry that I
[54:20] occupied their
[54:21] property so I said you have not given me
[54:24] this property it has come to me from
[54:27] second
[54:29] so
[54:30] anyway that is a different matter but uh
[54:35] I got rid of the Methodist Church in
[54:37] July June of
[54:40] 1982 and ever since the Lord has been
[54:44] very gracious to me to uh help me to
[54:49] preach the word of God in different
[54:51] parts of India Punjab and in South India
[54:55] Punjab is the west
[54:59] and Kata happens to be the eastern part
[55:02] of
[55:03] India so many congregations have been
[55:07] established and the people are growing
[55:10] in the Lord but at the same
[55:13] time as we know that the coming of the
[55:16] Lord is very
[55:17] near I'm going to share this evening a
[55:21] very different
[55:22] subject which you may not have heard
[55:25] before
[55:27] and the subject is
[55:31] virginity virginity you understand what
[55:34] virgin means virgin
[55:37] is
[55:39] undefiled by human
[55:42] beings how virginity is associated with
[55:47] the life of Jesus Christ
[55:50] amen how virginity is associated with
[55:55] the life of Jesus
[55:57] Christ and how virginity is associated
[56:00] with your
[56:02] life that will be the final thing
[56:06] because as we have read this scure in
[56:09] Ephesians
[56:11] 5 here
[56:14] the the illustration of the husband and
[56:17] wife is a type of the church and Christ
[56:23] yes and therefore the
[56:28] relationship has to be
[56:31] maintained
[56:33] that we become one with each
[56:38] other if you
[56:42] consider the whole Bible if we take the
[56:45] whole Bible in
[56:48] account what could be the central theme
[56:51] of the entire Bible if if we look at
[56:54] from Genesis to revelation
[56:57] there is a
[57:00] problem in the book of
[57:02] Genesis and that problem runs through
[57:05] the whole
[57:07] Bible and solution is found in the New
[57:13] Testament and through that
[57:16] solution we have come to this
[57:19] stage now we are going to see what was
[57:23] the
[57:24] problem the problem was
[57:26] of
[57:29] relationship amen
[57:31] relationship if you
[57:34] read Genesis chap
[57:38] 3 and verse 8
[58:16] Genesis 3 verse 8
[58:20] says and they heard the voice of the
[58:23] Lord God walking in the G Garden in the
[58:27] cool of the day and Adam and his wife
[58:31] hid themselves from the presence of the
[58:33] Lord
[58:34] God Among the Trees of the
[58:38] garden now this verse tells us
[58:42] that God used to have fellowship with
[58:45] man
[58:47] amen that was the sole purpose of the
[58:50] creation of
[58:53] man he had his angels with him
[58:57] even before the Man was
[59:00] created
[59:01] but he created in his
[59:05] Ownage to have fellow
[59:08] with that was the purpose of
[59:12] the but something
[59:14] happened and the sin entered their life
[59:18] we know the story how the sin enter
[59:19] their life and the relationship was
[59:24] broken the relationship was broken and
[59:28] they could not God could
[59:30] not have fellowship with a sinful man
[59:34] because God is Holy and he wants our
[59:38] lives to be holy then only we can have
[59:41] fellowship with God and Adam and Eve had
[59:45] sin in their life so they were asked to
[59:49] leave the place get out of the of Ed and
[59:54] it appears the very purpose for which
[59:56] Man was created is
[59:58] lost was The
[1:00:00] Fellowship God is Not
[1:00:02] defeated God has his
[1:00:06] mind prepared from the even before the
[1:00:09] foundation of the world how he is going
[1:00:12] to save the Lost Humanity amen and that
[1:00:15] is the story that runs throughout the
[1:00:19] Bible in the Gospel of
[1:00:23] John Chapter 2 we we find the first
[1:00:27] miracle that Jesus performed in the can
[1:00:30] of
[1:00:31] Galilee that is turning the water into
[1:00:34] wine we we all know the story very well
[1:00:37] and how this happened this was a place
[1:00:41] of marriage
[1:00:42] and it appears the poost was very
[1:00:46] popular and let us imagine that he
[1:00:49] invited 100
[1:00:51] people but 150 came
[1:00:56] so Arrangement is for 100 and 150 people
[1:01:01] have turned up so naturally the wi is
[1:01:03] going to
[1:01:04] be was
[1:01:06] over but this was
[1:01:09] aity and shame what of an arrangement
[1:01:15] made
[1:01:17] which important part of the marriage is
[1:01:22] over
[1:01:24] so if everybody comes to know they will
[1:01:27] laugh at
[1:01:28] him at him so it was a matter of
[1:01:32] prestige for him but luckily Jesus was
[1:01:36] there and his mother was there and so
[1:01:38] she said they have no
[1:01:41] wine and we know what Jesus
[1:01:45] did she told theant do what he says so
[1:01:50] there were six jars
[1:01:54] of water pots
[1:01:57] containing about 27 Gall each such a
[1:02:02] bigus told them to fill the jars with
[1:02:06] water and they filled it up to the
[1:02:09] brim and now Jesus tells take it to the
[1:02:14] marri Govern of
[1:02:16] theast the Govern tasted that which had
[1:02:20] into wine he
[1:02:22] said to The Host to the
[1:02:27] bridegroom everyone gives
[1:02:29] bestality in the beginning and have
[1:02:34] drunk then which is of lower quality but
[1:02:38] you have kept the
[1:02:40] bestality Until the End am you have kept
[1:02:44] the best quality until the end now this
[1:02:49] speaks of the message of the hour amen
[1:02:54] the message of the hour has been given
[1:02:56] in every age God has given the message
[1:03:00] to that particular age what was
[1:03:03] required the best was kept for your age
[1:03:09] amen and God has given us the best of
[1:03:12] the wine that we have drunk in this age
[1:03:16] am but I'm going to take the
[1:03:18] illustration of the six
[1:03:21] jars I'm speaking on the relationship
[1:03:24] you know and the
[1:03:26] relation has to be
[1:03:29] restored now this is the AG of
[1:03:32] restoration all lose ends have to be
[1:03:35] brought in Perfection am and
[1:03:39] restoration so God had a means of
[1:03:44] restoring that lost Fellowship which was
[1:03:47] in the Garden of
[1:03:48] Eden how is he going to do
[1:03:52] it different
[1:03:54] ways now these
[1:03:56] pictures or these vessels which were
[1:04:00] laid there in which the water was
[1:04:05] filled they
[1:04:07] represent the six means of
[1:04:11] purification is mentioned there these
[1:04:13] jars kept according to
[1:04:16] the man of purification of the
[1:04:20] juice and these jars represents the six
[1:04:26] ways of
[1:04:29] God's relationship with the Lost
[1:04:34] Humanity he didn't want to lose
[1:04:37] them he had them for his
[1:04:40] fellow so first thing that he gave to
[1:04:45] Moses on
[1:04:47] SI the two taets of
[1:04:51] stones and each Stone had five
[1:04:54] Commandments on each
[1:04:56] five
[1:04:57] Commandments on each
[1:05:00] taet and it was nearly 40 days when
[1:05:05] Moses was on the mountain and down in
[1:05:08] the valley people said what happened to
[1:05:10] the man who brought us out of the land
[1:05:12] of egyp he appears to have died because
[1:05:16] 40 days have passed and he not yet to
[1:05:19] return so they built a CF of gold and
[1:05:24] started dancing and
[1:05:26] saying this is our leader who brought us
[1:05:28] out of the land of Egypt and he lead us
[1:05:32] now God says to Moses go down and see
[1:05:35] what is happening in the valley and when
[1:05:38] Moses comes he sees what is happening
[1:05:41] and he very angry he thre those two taet
[1:05:45] of stones with the 10 commandments and
[1:05:50] that taets were broken and the fire came
[1:05:54] out of it and and consumed
[1:05:57] everything they who were dancing they
[1:05:59] were all
[1:06:01] dead now when Moses returns back to the
[1:06:04] mountain again to the Lord he said bring
[1:06:08] me two taet of stones again and he
[1:06:13] brings two taets of a stone and God
[1:06:16] again writes five on this one five on
[1:06:19] this
[1:06:20] one because this Commandments
[1:06:25] is the G of the whole
[1:06:28] Bible the
[1:06:31] Commandments is the G of the Bible how
[1:06:36] it talks right
[1:06:40] relationship the first four
[1:06:44] Commandments your right relationship
[1:06:48] with
[1:06:48] God this is
[1:06:51] vertical from fifth to the 10th
[1:06:56] is
[1:06:57] horizontal man to
[1:07:00] man that makes the
[1:07:03] cross you see
[1:07:05] that your right relationship with God
[1:07:08] first four Commandments you know all the
[1:07:11] Commandments not repeat it so the first
[1:07:14] four Commandments deal with your
[1:07:18] relationship with God
[1:07:21] vertical and fifth to the 10th
[1:07:27] to should have a right relationship
[1:07:30] because it is a of relationship that has
[1:07:33] to be
[1:07:35] restored so the 10 commandments were
[1:07:38] given to restore back the
[1:07:41] relationship that also people did not
[1:07:44] care so he appoints
[1:07:47] priests
[1:07:49] priests now the priest were in between
[1:07:53] the congregation and and God
[1:07:56] the priest
[1:07:58] were s of link to the congregation to
[1:08:02] represented congregation to God and God
[1:08:05] to the
[1:08:07] congregation I'm going very fast because
[1:08:09] it will take long time you know I'm
[1:08:12] going very fast so this was another link
[1:08:16] that kept the relationship God and man
[1:08:20] together through the
[1:08:22] priest that also did not work the Third
[1:08:26] comes then he appointed the
[1:08:30] judges the judges were a link between
[1:08:34] God and the
[1:08:35] congregation you see they were all
[1:08:37] Anointed with the oil they were all
[1:08:40] Anointed with the Holy Spirit you know
[1:08:42] they were chosen people of God to be a
[1:08:45] link between the congregation and God so
[1:08:49] the third thing first we found the 10
[1:08:54] commandments second
[1:08:59] the
[1:09:00] priest
[1:09:02] third the
[1:09:04] judges
[1:09:06] fourth comes
[1:09:09] the
[1:09:12] uh
[1:09:15] Kings after the
[1:09:17] judges is the
[1:09:20] Kings now when the Israelites were
[1:09:22] settled in land of
[1:09:24] Canan found different communities
[1:09:26] different
[1:09:27] communities and they had all Kings the
[1:09:30] Amit and thees
[1:09:33] Andes and all that they had
[1:09:36] owns but they that they don't have
[1:09:40] KS so they asked Samuel we want a king
[1:09:43] like other people have KS we also want
[1:09:46] to have a King Samuel was very
[1:09:49] angry you read that in the 1 Samuel 7
[1:09:54] and 8
[1:09:56] and the Lord said to
[1:09:59] Samuel so we know the story how was uh
[1:10:04] selected to be the first king of Israel
[1:10:07] so he becomes the fourth
[1:10:12] link then that also did not
[1:10:18] work then the fifth
[1:10:20] link is through the poal books five
[1:10:24] books you have been your Bible beginning
[1:10:26] with the Book of Job Psalms Proverbs
[1:10:32] Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon
[1:10:35] these are five books in your Bible which
[1:10:38] have the wisdom
[1:10:41] literature so through the wisdom
[1:10:43] literature you are advised how the
[1:10:47] relationship should be maintained in a
[1:10:50] cordial manner between God and
[1:10:53] man now the
[1:10:56] thing this also did not work comes the
[1:11:01] prophets the sixth J represents the
[1:11:06] prophets and they were also
[1:11:10] the sanctified people filled with the
[1:11:13] Holy Ghost and spoke in the guidance of
[1:11:16] the spirit of the Lord now we have 17 of
[1:11:20] them in our Bible beginning with Isaiah
[1:11:24] to Malachi
[1:11:26] but this is also divided in two
[1:11:29] parts Major Prophets and the Minor
[1:11:33] Prophets The Major Prophets are five
[1:11:37] Isaiah Jeremiah
[1:11:40] lamentation eel and
[1:11:43] Daniel these are the five Maj prophets
[1:11:47] and beginning with Hosea to Malachi we
[1:11:49] have 12 Minor Prophets but these are the
[1:11:53] six jars of
[1:11:56] communication a link between the Lost
[1:11:59] humanity and God you see this this is
[1:12:03] how it
[1:12:05] runs we know the story how brother also
[1:12:10] us that there are certain numers in the
[1:12:13] B their own
[1:12:16] significance number six number three
[1:12:19] number you find number s manytimes in
[1:12:23] the Book of Revelation
[1:12:25] and we have in the book of Kings
[1:12:30] also in the book of Samuel also and many
[1:12:33] books have the set of
[1:12:36] Sev so seven is a number of
[1:12:41] completion the
[1:12:44] six is a number for man because Man was
[1:12:49] created on the sixth day so number six
[1:12:53] is an incomplete number
[1:12:55] amen and this
[1:12:59] marriage host had only six
[1:13:03] jars but there needs to be a seventh one
[1:13:10] also and here is the seventh
[1:13:13] one the seventh one is Jesus Christ
[1:13:18] himself look from him Comes This
[1:13:22] ordinary water which is being filled in
[1:13:25] these six jars turning into the best
[1:13:28] quality of
[1:13:31] wine any man no matter how sinful he
[1:13:35] might be if he comes in contact with
[1:13:39] Jesus is going to turn into the best
[1:13:42] quality
[1:13:46] person that is the message of the hour
[1:13:49] today amen that is why God our Lord
[1:13:55] needs a virgin
[1:13:58] bride that is why we are considering
[1:14:00] virginity virginity
[1:14:03] virginity and we are
[1:14:05] seeing how virginity is associated with
[1:14:09] Jesus first of
[1:14:14] all we find that Jesus was born of a
[1:14:18] virgin
[1:14:20] Bo Isaiah
[1:14:23] 7 verse 14 says
[1:14:33] that therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:14:36] give you a
[1:14:38] sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and
[1:14:42] bear a son and shall call his name
[1:14:47] Emmanuel so the birth of
[1:14:50] Jesus
[1:14:52] was a virgin birth amen no human being
[1:14:57] has ever born of a virgin birth except
[1:15:01] Jesus so he is the first to be born of a
[1:15:06] virgin
[1:15:08] womb then second thing we
[1:15:12] find where did he come
[1:15:14] from he come from a place where no human
[1:15:18] has ever
[1:15:21] reached he's talking to Nicodemus in
[1:15:26] 3 and know that Nicodemus ACC tose 1
[1:15:31] John 3 verse 1 he was the ruler and
[1:15:37] political leader of the Jewish Community
[1:15:41] he was a
[1:15:42] leader so why did he come in the night
[1:15:46] to Jesus he should have come in the
[1:15:49] daytime but he scared of his
[1:15:52] position he doesn't want to be
[1:15:55] exposed to people that people will
[1:16:00] think otherwise why this fellow is going
[1:16:03] to this Jesus who is not of us and he is
[1:16:09] a mean he not a good why this fellow is
[1:16:13] going and meting him
[1:16:15] soodus knew that he was from God so he
[1:16:19] comes and Praises him and says Lord we
[1:16:22] know that you are from God because no no
[1:16:25] can do all these Miracles which you are
[1:16:28] doing now the Bible
[1:16:30] say
[1:16:32] in 1
[1:16:35] Corinthians 1 verse
[1:16:42] 22 why did Nicodemus Talk of the
[1:16:46] miracles of Jesus you see this is the
[1:16:49] speciality of the Jews for the Jews
[1:16:53] require a
[1:16:56] and the Greeks seek after wisdom now
[1:17:00] this is
[1:17:01] the characteris of the Greeks and the
[1:17:05] Jews Jews are interested only in the
[1:17:08] signs show us a sign sign theyed
[1:17:13] sign and Jesus said the evil and this
[1:17:19] generation which is evil seeks a sign
[1:17:22] but no no sign will be given except the
[1:17:25] of Jonas as Jonas was three days and
[1:17:27] three nights in the heart of the belly
[1:17:30] of the veale so shall the son of man be
[1:17:33] three days and three nights in the heart
[1:17:34] of the earth sign they were seeking sign
[1:17:37] they were only interested in sign but
[1:17:40] what has the sign to do with your life
[1:17:43] how it is going to save
[1:17:45] you signs were there many miracles Jesus
[1:17:49] performed but the Miracles did not have
[1:17:52] life it was only help for the physical
[1:17:57] bodying the sck or raising the
[1:18:02] dead healing the blind and death and all
[1:18:06] that all kinds of human
[1:18:08] ailments they were only a means of
[1:18:12] attraction to Jesus
[1:18:14] Christ now through the Miracles Jesus
[1:18:16] attracted the attention of the people
[1:18:19] and when they
[1:18:20] gathered
[1:18:22] he gave them
[1:18:25] the message of the
[1:18:27] hour what was the message of the hour
[1:18:30] the kingdom of God how can you be the
[1:18:34] part of the kingdom of God right amen
[1:18:36] and that is exactly what the whole Bible
[1:18:39] is teaching about how man can be
[1:18:42] restored back to the kingdom of
[1:18:44] God and that is the goal before us we
[1:18:48] want to be the part of the kingdom of
[1:18:50] God and so are many Christians trying
[1:18:55] to reach the kingdom of God but how will
[1:18:58] you
[1:19:00] reach without being a virgin you
[1:19:03] cannot you have to be a
[1:19:06] virgin you have to be a virgin because
[1:19:09] Jesus is associated with Virgin
[1:19:13] virginity now we are going to see seven
[1:19:15] points of virginity which is associated
[1:19:19] with Jesus so first we found that his
[1:19:23] birth was from the virgin boom amen
[1:19:28] secondly talking to Nicodemus in the
[1:19:31] 13th verse of John
[1:19:35] 313 it says no man ever ascended to
[1:19:39] Heaven except he who came down from
[1:19:43] heaven even the son of man which is in
[1:19:46] heaven you see man has not been able to
[1:19:51] defile even heaven heaven is pure
[1:19:55] I come from that pure
[1:19:57] place so Heaven is a virgin
[1:20:01] place where we all want to go to heaven
[1:20:08] amen and if we are
[1:20:11] Unholy we cannot go to heaven now there
[1:20:16] is a which I would like to share with
[1:20:18] you in Psalm 94 verse
[1:20:23] 20 and it's
[1:20:25] says shall the Throne of iniquity have
[1:20:30] fellowship with you there is a
[1:20:34] question shall theone of
[1:20:37] iniquity have fellow with you which
[1:20:41] frames Mischief by a
[1:20:45] law the answer is
[1:20:49] no God cannot have fellowship with
[1:20:53] iniquity
[1:20:55] that's God cannot have fellowship with
[1:20:59] sin God is Holy and he
[1:21:03] tells
[1:21:05] Moses in Leviticus
[1:21:09] 19 1 ver 1 and 2 if I read that it says
[1:21:21] here and the Lord spoke to Moses saying
[1:21:25] speak to all the congregation of the
[1:21:28] children of Israel and say to them ye
[1:21:32] shall be
[1:21:34] holy for the Lord your God am
[1:21:38] Holy the holy God cannot have fellowship
[1:21:42] with
[1:21:45] Unholy one if you want to have
[1:21:48] fellowship with God you have to be
[1:21:51] holy
[1:21:53] and this Heaven is
[1:21:56] Virgin the tomb was
[1:21:59] virgin and now the ministry of Jesus
[1:22:03] Christ the ministry is a virgin
[1:22:08] Ministry no man on the face of this
[1:22:12] Earth has done the things that Lord
[1:22:15] Jesus Christ has done
[1:22:17] amen be it
[1:22:20] Islam be it
[1:22:22] Hinduism it any Rel religion which is
[1:22:25] found on the face of this
[1:22:27] Earth no one has ever done such things
[1:22:31] now we have two
[1:22:33] witnesses about this
[1:22:36] ministry first is the the witness of
[1:22:40] Jesus Christ
[1:22:41] himself he says in
[1:22:45] Psalm John 15
[1:23:12] verse 23 and
[1:23:19] 24 Jesus answered and said to him if man
[1:23:24] love me he will keep my words and my
[1:23:29] father will love him and we will come to
[1:23:32] him and make our AB with
[1:23:35] him verse
[1:23:37] 24 he that loves
[1:23:43] me he that loves me not keeps not my
[1:23:47] saying and the word which you hear is
[1:23:50] not mine but the father's which sent me
[1:23:58] that is 14 I misre it chapter 15 verse
[1:24:03] 24
[1:24:06] yes if I had not done among them The
[1:24:11] Works which no other man did now these
[1:24:13] are the of Jesus
[1:24:16] himself if I had not done among them The
[1:24:20] Works which no other man did they had
[1:24:24] not had sin but now have they both seen
[1:24:29] and hated both me and my father right
[1:24:33] amen this is the testimony of Jesus
[1:24:35] himself he's talking
[1:24:37] about now you know the
[1:24:40] Pharisees and the rulers of the
[1:24:43] society the high priest and all that
[1:24:45] they did not like
[1:24:46] Jesus they wanted to kill him so they
[1:24:51] sent some SE and some leaders to catch
[1:24:56] hold of him and bring him to the
[1:24:59] office we find that in the seven
[1:25:02] chapter
[1:25:05] joh how these people are to catch of
[1:25:09] him and here in the sth
[1:25:14] chapter of John we
[1:25:16] find that verse 37 we will read and see
[1:25:24] in the
[1:25:25] last day that great day of the feast
[1:25:29] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[1:25:34] TR thirst let him come to me and drink
[1:25:38] he that believes on me as the scripture
[1:25:41] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:25:45] rivers of Living
[1:25:47] Water but this spoke he of the spirit
[1:25:51] which they had that believe on him
[1:25:54] should
[1:25:54] receive but the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:25:58] given because that Jesus was not yet
[1:26:02] glorified now here the preaching of
[1:26:06] Jesus is going on and the officers have
[1:26:11] sent the men to catch hold of Jesus and
[1:26:14] bring
[1:26:17] him and verse 46 let us leave all the
[1:26:21] rest and read 46
[1:26:24] the officers
[1:26:26] answered never man speak like this man
[1:26:32] now this is the testimony of the
[1:26:35] soldiers who sent to catch of him they
[1:26:39] have not C hold of him they returned
[1:26:42] empty and the priest ising why did not
[1:26:47] him what the you have arrested him him
[1:26:52] now this is the answer they
[1:26:55] never a man like this
[1:26:59] man no human being has ever spoken like
[1:27:02] what he spoken hising
[1:27:08] witness
[1:27:11] andr theyr him they have return
[1:27:17] empty
[1:27:19] offic spoken this we areed
[1:27:24] you will read it that they are angry
[1:27:26] with them and say you
[1:27:29] areed
[1:27:31] haveed have the Pharisees also believed
[1:27:34] on him and so many questions are there
[1:27:38] so the ministry of Jesus is a virin
[1:27:43] Ministry no one on the face of this
[1:27:46] Earth has done those things Jesus has
[1:27:50] done now number four
[1:27:54] the ministry is
[1:27:56] over now it is a time for him to
[1:28:00] be taken into custody and put to death
[1:28:05] so as it is
[1:28:08] mentioned in the book
[1:28:11] of Old
[1:28:13] Testament we have the prophecy of Jesus
[1:28:16] riding a
[1:28:18] c so he riding a c and we read in the
[1:28:24] Gospel of Mark
[1:28:27] 11 verse
[1:28:30] 2
[1:28:32] and when they came near to
[1:28:35] Jerusalem to be and Bean at the Mount of
[1:28:41] Olives he sends forth two of his
[1:28:45] disciples and says to them go your way
[1:28:49] into the village opposite you and as
[1:28:52] soon as you be entered into it you shall
[1:28:57] find a cold tide where on never man sat
[1:29:03] you
[1:29:05] see over on never man sat lose him and
[1:29:10] bring him am a virgin
[1:29:15] cult was not
[1:29:20] defiled I'll go little
[1:29:24] because time is running out and now we
[1:29:29] come to the death of Jesus
[1:29:32] Christ now the death of Jesus Christ is
[1:29:35] a virgin
[1:29:37] death no man on the face of this Earth
[1:29:40] has died for
[1:29:44] others except Jesus Christ am no man has
[1:29:49] ever given his life for the sake of
[1:29:52] others but Jesus Jus died for
[1:29:56] all you see in the book of Timothy we
[1:30:01] read let me find out in the book of
[1:30:03] Timothy
[1:30:31] chapter 2 verse
[1:30:32] 3 1 Timothy 2:3 for this is good and
[1:30:38] acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:30:40] savior who will have all men to be saved
[1:30:45] now here it is mention that it is his
[1:30:50] will that all should be saved but are
[1:30:54] all men going to be saved no but he his
[1:30:58] will is that all should be saved and to
[1:31:03] come to the knowledge of the truth for
[1:31:06] there is one God and one mediator
[1:31:09] between God and the man Christ
[1:31:13] Jesus in the fourth
[1:31:16] chapter we find
[1:31:18] that he is the
[1:31:21] savior of the whole world
[1:31:36] world I'm not able to find it now but it
[1:31:39] is in the four chapter somewh that he is
[1:31:43] not only the savior of the ones who are
[1:31:46] saved but he the savior of the whole
[1:31:48] world his sacrifice is for all but only
[1:31:53] those who believe on him shall be saved
[1:31:57] not all and Jesus came only for his own
[1:32:02] if you read Matthew 1 verse 21 it is
[1:32:06] written
[1:32:08] there that Joseph was not willing to
[1:32:11] bring Mary his wife because she was with
[1:32:15] a
[1:32:16] child and the angel of the Lord appears
[1:32:21] to him in the dream and
[1:32:25] says
[1:32:28] Joseph
[1:32:30] don't be angry with
[1:32:33] yourself now this whatever is in the
[1:32:36] womb of Mary is from the Holy
[1:32:39] Ghost she is going to Bear a son and you
[1:32:44] shall call his name
[1:32:46] Jesus for he shall save now this is
[1:32:50] important which nobody notices
[1:32:54] and all the churches who read this verse
[1:32:59] never give Credence and thought to this
[1:33:03] verse what is written there and he shall
[1:33:07] save his people not all
[1:33:11] people he shall save his people from
[1:33:14] their sins
[1:33:16] amen so Jesus comes for his own people
[1:33:20] amen and you are one of them amen
[1:33:24] you have to be
[1:33:26] virgin then only you are going to have
[1:33:29] fellowship with
[1:33:30] him now we found the fifth thing that
[1:33:33] his death was a
[1:33:35] virgin and how it was a virgin that let
[1:33:39] me see we find in the gospel of
[1:33:44] Mark 10 verse
[1:33:48] 45 Jesus
[1:33:50] giving the
[1:33:54] definition of his own
[1:33:57] life why did he come on this Earth he
[1:34:00] says in the
[1:34:02] 1045 Mark
[1:34:16] 10:45 for even the son of man came not
[1:34:21] to be ministered to
[1:34:24] but to minister and to give his life a
[1:34:27] ransom for
[1:34:32] many no one has given his life for
[1:34:35] many Jesus says I have come for that
[1:34:39] purpose so in this way the ministry and
[1:34:43] the death of Jesus Christ is a virgin
[1:34:46] death I have written several verses over
[1:34:49] here but I'm not going to read all these
[1:34:52] Romans chap 5: 6 to 10 you can write and
[1:34:57] 10th chapter 6
[1:34:59] to13 we'll deal with this uh portion of
[1:35:04] the Virgin death of Jesus Christ now let
[1:35:08] us
[1:35:10] take number
[1:35:12] six Jesus Is
[1:35:15] Dead Ain
[1:35:18] death now he is going to be placed in a
[1:35:22] tomb and that tomb has to be a virgin
[1:35:25] tomb
[1:35:27] amen Luke 23: 53
[1:35:56] Luke
[1:35:57] 23 verse
[1:36:02] 23
[1:36:04] 53 Luke 23:
[1:36:10] 53 and he took it down and wrapped it in
[1:36:15] a linen and laid it in a
[1:36:19] Seer that was H in stone where in never
[1:36:24] man before was laid
[1:36:28] Amen in this tomb no man was ever laid
[1:36:32] am this was a virgin
[1:36:35] tomb now number
[1:36:38] seven comes his
[1:36:41] resurrection his resurrection is a
[1:36:43] virgin
[1:36:45] Resurrection how can you prove it let us
[1:36:48] see Matthew chap 27
[1:37:18] Matthew chap 7
[1:37:20] 2752 53
[1:37:28] Jesus when he had cried again with a
[1:37:31] loud voice yielded up The Ghost and
[1:37:35] behold the veale of the temple was rent
[1:37:38] in two from the top to the bottom and
[1:37:42] the Earth did quake and the Rocks
[1:37:46] rent and the grapes were opened now
[1:37:50] notice here and the grapes were opened
[1:37:55] and many bodies of the Saints which
[1:37:58] slept
[1:38:00] arose
[1:38:02] arose and came out of the
[1:38:06] graves when after his resurrection am
[1:38:11] not
[1:38:13] before after his
[1:38:16] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:38:19] and appeared to
[1:38:21] many you see
[1:38:24] when he gave up the ghost on the cross
[1:38:27] the graves were opened and they became
[1:38:29] alive but they did not come out of the
[1:38:32] graves until Jesus came out of the Grave
[1:38:36] so he became the first
[1:38:39] born Romans chapter
[1:38:42] 8 let us see Romans chapter 8
[1:38:55] verse
[1:38:58] 29 for whom he did for
[1:39:02] no he also did predestinate to be
[1:39:06] conformed to the image of his
[1:39:08] son that he might be the first
[1:39:12] born among many Brethren yes he is the
[1:39:18] first
[1:39:19] born he the first one in Resurrection
[1:39:23] amen so his resurrection is a virgin
[1:39:27] Resurrection all these seven things
[1:39:29] brothers and sisters relate how the life
[1:39:34] of Jesus was associated with
[1:39:38] virginity now comes the last he coming
[1:39:42] to receive a
[1:39:45] bride and that bride has to be a virgin
[1:39:50] bride unless you are virgin how can you
[1:39:53] be
[1:39:53] virgin be found in
[1:39:57] him let the spirit of God lead
[1:40:02] you this evening we were sitting in the
[1:40:05] uh men's meeting and we found
[1:40:10] that
[1:40:11] uh
[1:40:13] the things many things that we are
[1:40:16] claiming to be
[1:40:19] Christians denominations are also
[1:40:21] claiming to be Christians
[1:40:24] how are we
[1:40:26] them but we are we know that we
[1:40:30] are a Baptist also says he a Christian a
[1:40:34] Methodist also says he a Christian a
[1:40:37] Pentecostal also says he a
[1:40:41] Christian
[1:40:43] difference
[1:40:45] difference must know who the what the
[1:40:48] difference is and the difference is that
[1:40:51] you should know that position is a very
[1:40:55] special
[1:40:56] position and that is found in First
[1:41:00] Peter chapter
[1:41:09] 2 verse but you are a chosen
[1:41:14] generation a royal
[1:41:16] priesthood a holy nation a peul people
[1:41:22] that you should show forth his Praises
[1:41:25] of him who has called you out of
[1:41:27] Darkness Into His Marvelous Light right
[1:41:32] brothers and sisters this message has
[1:41:34] done great things for us and this Bible
[1:41:37] which is a closed book to the
[1:41:40] denominations amen and this evening I
[1:41:43] was telling there are two words in Greek
[1:41:47] regarding this Bible everybody reads
[1:41:50] this Methodist also read it Pentecostals
[1:41:53] also read it the Roman Catholics also
[1:41:56] are now allowed to read it but do they
[1:42:00] get what is written in it
[1:42:02] no so this Bible is a Remar to them it
[1:42:07] is just like any ordinary book like you
[1:42:11] can read any book and so you read Bible
[1:42:14] also like way because you don't get out
[1:42:17] of it what it
[1:42:18] says but what did Jesus say to his
[1:42:22] disciples
[1:42:24] you remember he always preached the
[1:42:26] kingdom of God but according to Matthew
[1:42:30] 13 verse
[1:42:32] 34 and
[1:42:35] 35 let us see what uh the Bible says
[1:42:40] about the ministry of Jesus Christ how
[1:42:43] he did
[1:42:44] it Matthew 13:
[1:42:49] 3435 all these things spake Jesus to
[1:42:53] multitude in Parables and without a
[1:42:56] parable speak he not to
[1:43:00] them that it might be fulfilled which
[1:43:03] was spoken by the prophet saying I will
[1:43:06] open my mouth in Parables I will utter
[1:43:09] things which have been kept secret from
[1:43:11] the foundation of the world then Jesus
[1:43:15] sent the multitude away and went into
[1:43:18] the house and his disciples came to him
[1:43:21] saying declare us the parable of the
[1:43:24] tears of the field and he explained to
[1:43:28] them
[1:43:31] now he has spoken only in Parables
[1:43:37] why why did he speak in
[1:43:41] Parables if you
[1:43:44] read verse 16 of this
[1:43:50] chapter it says
[1:43:56] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:44:00] and your ears for the
[1:44:04] here for verily I say to you that many
[1:44:08] prophets and righteous have desired to
[1:44:12] see these things which you
[1:44:15] see and have not seen them and to hear
[1:44:19] these things which you hear have not
[1:44:22] heard them
[1:44:24] here therefore the parable of the
[1:44:29] now if
[1:44:31] you
[1:44:33] see the Book of Revelation 2 and 3 every
[1:44:37] one of you know these are the seven
[1:44:39] letters to the seven Church
[1:44:42] ages and in the end of every letter it
[1:44:47] is written let him hear who has the ears
[1:44:51] to hear
[1:44:55] yes and Jesus calls his disciples
[1:44:58] blessed are your ears that they can
[1:45:02] hear and blessed are your your eyes that
[1:45:06] can
[1:45:07] see you remember the eyesight of
[1:45:12] David it
[1:45:14] was that with one
[1:45:17] stone he killed the he was CED all over
[1:45:21] only this
[1:45:25] and the first stone that he
[1:45:29] hising out of theing it went andit his
[1:45:32] head and gol was down he had a
[1:45:38] sharp he had a sharp eye and the same
[1:45:42] David says open thou eyes that I may
[1:45:46] behold the wondrous things out
[1:45:49] OFW Psalm 119 verse 11
[1:45:54] he is praying to open his eyes not these
[1:45:57] eyes but the eyes of the
[1:46:00] heart the eyes of your heart must be
[1:46:03] open and if the eyes of your heart are
[1:46:06] open brothers and sister you will see
[1:46:08] great things hidden in this
[1:46:12] Bible and verse 105 says Psalm 119 verse
[1:46:18] 105 your word is a lamp unto my feet and
[1:46:23] a light unto my PA and I have hid your
[1:46:26] word in my heart that I sin not against
[1:46:30] you you have to become a virgin
[1:46:33] bride because Jesus is coming to receive
[1:46:37] you very
[1:46:38] soon unless you are a
[1:46:41] bride he not going to take you
[1:46:45] home
[1:46:46] virginity is
[1:46:48] associated with Jesus Christ so
[1:46:51] virginity must be associated with your
