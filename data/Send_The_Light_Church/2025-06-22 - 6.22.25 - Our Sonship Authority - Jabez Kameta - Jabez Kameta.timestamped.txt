[0:00] I forgot but it's good to see you. God
[0:03] bless. I want to tell a little story uh
[0:05] if I could. Brother Ketta who's
[0:09] ministering for you today and uh I'm not
[0:12] sure if you all know but the brother is
[0:14] from Nigeria is his wife back here.
[0:16] Sister of faith.
[0:18] Amen. I refer to as faith hope and
[0:21] charity.
[0:23] Sister of faith. Anyway, I want to tell
[0:25] you about brother Ketta a little story
[0:26] and I I hope he can't hear me too much.
[0:29] But uh uh as we were driving down here
[0:33] today,
[0:34] the brother's in the back seat and he's
[0:36] got his phone and like a true man of
[0:38] God, he's having a Zoom meeting with his
[0:42] own church which is about six and a half
[0:44] hours ahead, you know, and so he's back
[0:48] there. I wouldn't say he was preaching,
[0:49] but we'll say he was greeting his
[0:51] church. So, I thought that was wonderful
[0:54] that he would uh do that and and that
[0:56] his church of course.
[1:00] So, when I knew that I was going to be
[1:03] bringing brother Ketta and his wife here
[1:06] today,
[1:08] I knew this guy over here was going to
[1:10] ask me to sing,
[1:12] but I couldn't really catch the mind of
[1:14] the Lord for any song that I might sing
[1:17] uh for you. that I I did catch some uh
[1:20] some inspiration of some choruses. So,
[1:23] if you know these choruses, you're more
[1:25] than welcome to to join in and sing with
[1:28] me. And I want to take the job of the
[1:30] song leader for sure. So, but God bless
[1:33] you all and I trust the Lord has been
[1:36] good to you.
[1:38] Lord, my heart is open
[1:44] and won't you come inside
[1:49] and take up all my being
[1:55] and ever to abide
[2:01] [Music]
[2:05] and I swung wide every door.
[2:10] So won't you come inside? Dear Lord, I
[2:16] need you more and more.
[2:22] And Lord, my heart is open.
[2:27] Won't you come inside
[2:32] and take up all my being
[2:38] ever to abide.
[2:43] I've opened all my windows
[2:48] and I've swung wide every door.
[2:52] [Music]
[2:54] So won't you come inside, dear Lord? I
[3:00] need you more and more.
[3:06] Amen.
[3:08] And the more that I surrender,
[3:13] the lighter my load.
[3:17] The more that I release my cares, the
[3:22] more you take control,
[3:25] the more that I can humble myself, the
[3:30] more you lift me up.
[3:34] Every day I live, Lord, I love you more.
[3:42] The more that I surrender,
[3:47] the lighter
[3:48] my Lord,
[3:51] the more that I release my cares, the
[3:55] more you take control,
[3:59] the more that I can humble myself, the
[4:04] more you lift me up.
[4:07] Every day I live. Lord, I love you more.
[4:16] And falling in love
[4:18] with Jesus.
[4:23] Falling in love with Jesus.
[4:28] Oh, I'm falling in love with Jesus.
[4:34] And it's the best thing I've ever ever
[4:38] done. Amen. Well, I'm falling in love
[4:43] with Jesus.
[4:46] Falling in love with Jesus.
[4:52] Oh, falling in love with Jesus
[4:58] is the best thing I've ever ever done. M

[5:32] offering.
[6:20] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. In the
[6:23] city where the lamb is the light. Amen.
[6:27] There's a country far beyond the starry
[6:31] sky.
[6:33] There's a city where there never comes a
[6:36] night.
[6:38] If we're faithful, we shall be by and
[6:42] by.
[6:44] Is that city where the lamb is the
[6:47] light.
[6:49] In that city where the lamb is the lie.
[6:54] That fair city where there cometh no
[6:57] night.
[6:59] I have a mansion over there. And when
[7:02] free from toil and care, I am going
[7:06] where the lamb is alive.
[7:10] Here we have our days of sunshine. But
[7:13] we know
[7:15] that the sun that shines upon us now so
[7:18] bright.
[7:20] We'll be changed to clouds and rain
[7:22] until we go
[7:25] to that city where the lamb is alive.
[7:30] In that city where the lamb is the lie.
[7:36] That fair city where there cometh no
[7:39] night.
[7:41] I have a mansion over there. And when
[7:44] free from toil and care, I am going
[7:47] where the lamb is alive.
[7:50] [Applause]
[7:51] There the sun take forever and the day
[7:56] shall be one eternal day without a
[8:00] night.
[8:02] And our tears shall be forever wiped
[8:05] away.
[8:07] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[8:12] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[8:17] That fair city where there cometh no
[8:20] night.
[8:22] I have a mansion over there. And when
[8:26] free from toil and care, I am going
[8:29] where the lamb is alive.
[8:33] Here we have our disappointments all the
[8:36] while
[8:38] and our fondest hopes bitter blind.
[8:43] Though by night we weep, the morning
[8:46] brings a smile. Praise the Lord. In that
[8:49] city where the lamb is alive.
[8:53] In that city where the lamb is the lie.
[8:59] In that city where there cometh no

[9:07] free from toil and care, I am going
[9:10] where the lamb is alive.
[9:14] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[9:19] In that city where there cometh no
[9:22] night.
[9:24] I have a mansion over there. And when
[9:27] free from toil and care, I am going
[9:30] where the lamb is alive.
[9:35] Amen. Amen.
[9:38] Praise the Lord. Amen. And ask brother
[9:40] John to come. God bless you, Bruce. God
[9:44] bless you. It's good to be in the house
[9:45] of the Lord. Amen. Amen. And it is our
[9:50] first time to have a brother Jabz and
[9:54] his wife Faith
[9:56] with us. Amen. God bless you. Amen. To
[10:00] have a representation from Nigeria, it's
[10:03] a wonderful, wonderful. And we've uh
[10:06] heard about our brother um from brother
[10:09] Jeff Snodgrass last year, but we were
[10:12] unable to have them because of his uh
[10:15] schedule was already filled. So this
[10:18] year uh uh we had set it and I had
[10:22] forgot actually to put it in my calendar
[10:26] and then we got a call from our precious
[10:29] brother Gordy to remind us who's that uh
[10:33] he'll be here next week. So
[10:36] oh my I just thankful that the Lord um
[10:40] has arranged today's
[10:43] service to be as it is. And I'll say
[10:46] this, um, we have we've had a little bit
[10:49] of difficulties in the in the back. We
[10:51] were going to try to get a presentation
[10:53] and we're not able to do that. But you
[10:56] know what? We're trusting in the Lord
[10:58] Jesus Christ today. And our brother does
[11:02] have a little bit of a thick accent.
[11:04] What that means is that we got to like
[11:07] twi try twice as hard to listen. Amen.
[11:11] And um and it it just takes one word
[11:14] from the Lord, right? And it just kind
[11:17] of reminded me of uh in the book of Acts
[11:20] where they all heard in their own
[11:23] language what was being spoken. And I I
[11:26] just I believe in the power of God that
[11:29] can go beyond the natural to get us what
[11:32] we need on the inside today. So let's
[11:36] stand together and and just uh believe
[11:39] with all of our heart as the word is
[11:41] coming forth
[11:43] and uh and I believe together we can
[11:47] magnetize the presence of the Lord here.
[11:50] Amen. Let's sing only believe as our
[11:52] brother comes to minister. Amen.
[11:55] Only

[18:35] wonderful song. I really appreciate
[18:36] that. So, can we just stand on our feet
[18:39] and then look at the scripture? I would
[18:41] try to
[18:43] um
[18:45] compose myself and um and try to do it
[18:49] in American way. You know, back home uh
[18:53] we we use 2 hours, 3 hours and so forth
[18:56] like Africans, you know. But when you
[18:59] come to to the US, you have to try to
[19:02] maintain it 1 hour, 1 hour, 15 minutes,
[19:04] that's enough. So, so I trust that God
[19:07] will help me to make use of that time
[19:09] and be a blessing to the people. So, let
[19:11] us look at the scripture. We have a
[19:14] couple of scripture to read. Would like
[19:16] to read a book of um uh first Kings
[19:19] chapter 17
[19:21] and um Joshua chapter 10
[19:25] and
[19:27] Matthew chapter 16.
[19:30] Three scripture. First Kings chapter 17,
[19:34] Joshua 10
[19:36] and
[19:39] Matthew 16,
[19:45] first Kings the 17th chapter,
[19:47] take a verse from there. And Elijah the
[19:50] Tishbite, who was of the inhabitant of
[19:54] Gileian,
[19:56] said unto Ahab, "As the Lord God of
[19:59] Israel liveth, before whom I stand,
[20:03] there shall be no due nor rain these
[20:07] years, but according to my word." Now,
[20:11] he never said according to the word of
[20:13] the Lord. He never said, "Thus says the
[20:15] Lord." If he could have said thus says
[20:18] the Lord, I think that Ahab could have
[20:19] take it serious. But he say according to
[20:22] my own word. Amen. So Joshua chapter 10
[20:30] verse 12
[20:35] verse 12. Then spake Joshua in the uh to
[20:39] the Lord in that in the day when the
[20:43] Lord deliver up the Amorite
[20:47] before the children of Israel. And he
[20:50] said in the sight of Israel,
[20:54] son, stand thou still upon Gibon, and
[20:59] thou moon in the valley of Adelon. and
[21:03] the sun stood still, and the moon stayed
[21:07] until the people had avveniled
[21:09] themselves upon their enemies.
[21:13] Is not this written in the book of Jes
[21:18] stood still in the midst of heaven, and
[21:21] hastened not to go down about a whole
[21:23] day. And there was no day like that
[21:28] before it or after it that the Lord
[21:32] hearken unto the voice of a man. Amen.
[21:36] Amen. Not the voice of an angel. Amen.
[21:39] But God listen, hearken unto the voice
[21:43] of a man. Now could that be could could
[21:46] the hour come that the father have to
[21:48] honor the son, honor the words of his
[21:51] children? Amen. Amen. For the Lord
[21:54] fought for Israel. The Matthew 16 verse
[21:58] 19. Matthew 16:E1 19.
[22:07] And I will give unto thee the keys of
[22:10] the kingdom of heaven.
[22:13] And whatever thou bind shall bind on
[22:16] earth shall be bound in heaven. Amen.
[22:18] and whatsoever thou shalt lose on the
[22:22] earth on earth shall be lose in heaven.
[22:24] Amen. May the Lord add blessing to his
[22:26] word in our heart in Jesus name. May be
[22:29] seated. I want to choose a title this
[22:32] morning on uh our sunship authority.
[22:35] Amen. We are sons and daughters of God.
[22:38] So I want to speak on the authority that
[22:40] we have our sunship authority. Now was
[22:44] speaking about faith for this day in a
[22:47] message uh spiritual food in due season.
[22:51] He said I want you to get build up now
[22:54] in this holy oracle of God. Amen. Right.
[22:59] This message is a holy oracle of God.
[23:02] Amen. Amen. Amen. In the faith
[23:06] said the faith of this hour. Amen. The
[23:10] faith. say it's going to take more faith
[23:13] than ever was in any other age otherwise
[23:16] there will be more faith in this age
[23:18] than Paul age than erranos age than
[23:22] Martin age than Luther's age than
[23:25] wesling age and than the Pentecostal age
[23:28] amen it will take more faith in this age
[23:31] than any other age for this is the
[23:35] rapturing faith amen amen to be taken up
[23:39] amen Amen. So in our define faith in
[23:42] another one the end time he was defining
[23:45] faith. He said what is faith? In
[23:47] paragraph 68 the end time say what is
[23:50] faith?
[23:52] And I said faith is something that is
[23:54] revealed to you. Amen. That is not yet
[23:59] but will be. Amen. Amen. God has
[24:03] revealed to you something. Amen. That is
[24:06] going to be but it's not yet. But you
[24:08] are proclaiming that it shall be just
[24:12] like like Noah that it there shall be
[24:15] rain. There have not been rain before
[24:18] but when Noah caught it by faith that
[24:21] there will be rain and Noah proclaimed
[24:23] it for 120 years and it and it happens.
[24:27] Amen. Amen. So it says so faith is a
[24:30] revelation of the will of God, God's
[24:33] will to you. Say by revelation. Amen. By
[24:36] revelation all the heroes of faith in
[24:38] Hebrews 11 by faith, amen, they obtain a
[24:42] good report. Praise God. For Abraham by
[24:45] faith, Enoch by faith, Gideon by faith,
[24:48] Samson by faith. Amen. All these heroes
[24:51] of faith. Amen. They express faith on
[24:54] the word of God. Hallelujah. And they
[24:57] see it come to pass.
[24:59] And that's what God want us to do. Amen.
[25:02] is to respond to his word, to act on his
[25:05] word, to recognize his word, to believe
[25:08] his word. Amen. So he just finished
[25:11] preaching in the message hear ye him and
[25:13] then he tried to call a prayer line.
[25:17] So he called a prayer line uh to pray
[25:20] for the sick, those with a prayer card.
[25:22] And Agabite after meeting him said
[25:25] Agabite said to me that number seven has
[25:29] already been healed. Amen. while I was
[25:32] preaching. Amen. Without hands be laid
[25:35] upon them. Amen. Amen. Say just while he
[25:38] was preaching. Amen. Prayer card number
[25:41] seven was healed. Hallelujah. Abraham
[25:45] said, "Praise the Lord." That is good.
[25:49] That is the original way. God's original
[25:52] way. Amen. Of doing it. Preach the word.
[25:56] And that is the way God want it done.
[25:59] Hallelujah. For he sent forth his word
[26:02] and his word healed them.
[26:04] Amen. So God will be more happy when as
[26:09] he speak the word to you and you respond
[26:11] to the word and you receive your
[26:13] blessing. Amen. That is God's original
[26:16] way of doing it. Amen. You see that in
[26:19] Acts chapter 10 when Peter was preaching
[26:22] to the people, he was identifying Christ
[26:25] and the people's heart were ready and
[26:27] they were willing to receive the word.
[26:29] And the Bible said while Peter there
[26:31] speak come the Holy Spirit and it fell
[26:34] upon the people and that can happen this
[26:36] morning. Why speak the word you can be
[26:39] healed. You can be delivered. You can be
[26:41] set free.
[26:45] Hallelujah.
[26:47] Praise be to God. Abraham said God sent
[26:50] his word and what did he do? He healed
[26:52] them. That's right. That's good. That's
[26:55] right. Amen. Praise God. So this morning
[26:59] we want to speak on the authority of the
[27:01] word.
[27:03] Amen. Want to look at authority of the
[27:05] word. A sunship authority. The authority
[27:09] of the word. So bra was speaking on uh
[27:12] Jesus on the authority of the word. 1954
[27:15] this paragraph uh 15. He said now we are
[27:20] going to speak but just for a few moment
[27:22] the authority of God's word. Right.
[27:26] The authority of God's word. He said,
[27:29] "Now every word of God, Amen, is written
[27:33] sworn authority."
[27:35] In other words, Amen. Every word that is
[27:40] spoken is absolutely right. The right of
[27:44] every believer to accept it. Yes. As the
[27:48] infallible truth. Amen. God said it. I
[27:51] believe it. That's settle it. Amen.
[27:54] because it's God's word. Amen. And
[27:58] Abraham said, he said said, "God is
[28:00] ready to bankrupt heaven for any word to
[28:03] fail."
[28:05] Hallelujah. Amen. So if you can take
[28:07] that word, say, "God is ready to
[28:09] bankrupt heaven for the word to ever
[28:12] fail." See, heaven and earth shall pass
[28:15] away, but my word shall not pass away.
[28:19] Amen, says the Lord. It must be
[28:21] fulfilled in his season. It cannot
[28:24] return back to God void. It must
[28:26] accomplish the purpose and prosper in
[28:29] the thing it was meant. That is God's
[28:33] word, the authority of God's word. And
[28:36] that is what we want to stand here this
[28:37] morning. So we have to go back to the
[28:39] word and then go back to the beginning.
[28:42] Amen. Go back to your beginning as son
[28:45] of God. The authority you have. So he
[28:48] was telling us in the message the
[28:49] fundamental foundation for faith. He was
[28:51] speaking here to us that in paragraph 22
[28:54] he said now God when he made man in the
[28:57] beginning. Amen. He made him a superior
[29:01] to anything on the earth. Amen. He gave
[29:05] him the jurision of everything on earth
[29:08] to control everything. He controls the
[29:11] animal life. He controls the foul life,
[29:14] the fishes of the sea. Amen. He controls
[29:17] the wind. He controls the plant life. He
[29:20] controls everything.
[29:22] Man was a secondary god on the earth. Do
[29:25] you believe that? Amen. He gave him the
[29:28] power to control all things. All element
[29:31] of the earth. Amen. Amen. You see why he
[29:34] say if thou speak to this mountain be
[29:36] move and don't die to your heart. Amen.
[29:38] He give them power over every element of
[29:41] the earth. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[29:45] So he was saying them. He said that was
[29:47] Adam. Adam was given this great power
[29:50] but then the power that was given to him
[29:54] to make his choice is what he failed. So
[29:58] Adam fell by the power of choice. And we
[30:01] are standing on that same ground the
[30:03] power of choice. Is God's words cor
[30:05] right or is wrong? Amen. Do we accept
[30:08] his word or do we reject his word? So
[30:11] it's a power of choice. Amen. Do we
[30:13] agree with his word and deny ourself or
[30:16] reject ourself and accept his word?
[30:21] Hallelujah. So Adam could speak to the
[30:24] wind and it obeys him. He could speak to
[30:27] the trees and the trees could obey him.
[30:29] Say come over tree you planted here be
[30:31] planted here. Wrote Adam be planted here
[30:33] and the tree obey him. See he could
[30:35] speak to it. It could obey him. He could
[30:37] speak to the wildlife and it obey him.
[30:39] He could speak to the waters. Amen. over
[30:42] whatever it is and everything obey Adam.
[30:45] Amen. Amen. And even till this day all
[30:48] the names that Adam name all the beast
[30:51] of the earth. Amen. They still obey him.
[30:53] Amen. You can imagine a monkey jump in
[30:56] here and Adam look at the monkey. He
[30:58] said, "Oh, look at you. You must be
[31:00] monkey. Your name is monkey." And the
[31:02] monkey never question. He went out.
[31:04] Amen. He could gorilla comes and say,
[31:06] "Oh, look at you're a gorilla. You can
[31:08] go." And that was all. Amen. Amen. He
[31:11] named the lion. He named the tiger.
[31:14] Amen. And then when he when a creature
[31:16] came before him and the creature looked
[31:18] like him. They look alike. And Adam look
[31:22] at him say look at this thing.
[31:25] And the creature said good morning
[31:26] brother. Adam said good morning. You
[31:29] could talk. Say how are you? Say I'm
[31:32] fine. How is your family? Said we are
[31:34] good doing well.
[31:37] said, "I thought I'm the only one that
[31:38] was that the Lord has made." Said,
[31:41] "Where is this thing coming from?"
[31:44] He said, "Where where do you live?"
[31:45] Said, "I'm living over there." And look
[31:47] at him. I said, "No, you're a serpent.
[31:50] You're a deceiver." And he call him
[31:52] serpent. And he said, "Yes, sir, I'm a
[31:53] serpent."
[31:56] Amen. So everything obey Adam. Amen.
[32:00] Hallelujah. That was the beginning of
[32:02] man. See that now? That was the
[32:04] beginning of man. Amen. That was when
[32:06] God gave him the power. See, power over
[32:10] everything on the earth. Amen. But now
[32:14] through the fall, he lost that power.
[32:18] Then he become unconscious of the fact.
[32:22] Amen. After he has lost his relationship
[32:24] and friendship and fellowship with the
[32:26] father, then he lost that. So he become
[32:30] unconscious. Amen. Of what he really is.
[32:32] And brother said he caught amnesia.
[32:34] spiritual amnesia. Praise the Lord. And
[32:37] amnesia is a loss of identity. And
[32:40] Abraham say if you want to get a man
[32:42] Amen that had amnesia, if you want to
[32:44] restore him back, bring him to familiar
[32:46] places. Amen. Hallelujah. And I thank
[32:50] God we are in familiar places. The
[32:52] message of the hour is a familiar place.
[32:55] Hallelujah. He revealed to us where we
[32:57] came from. That we come from God and we
[32:59] are going back to God.
[33:02] Hallelujah. Praise be to God. So Abraham
[33:06] said, "Amen." And all his great channel
[33:10] became clog up. Amen. And he couldn't
[33:13] get through. Man couldn't get through.
[33:15] Amen. Because his channel, his faith
[33:17] channel has been clunk up. Amen. And God
[33:21] can't build a church where the channel
[33:22] are clunk up like that. He can't build a
[33:25] church on that. That's why when Jesus
[33:28] came in in the coast of Cassera,
[33:30] Philippine in Matthew chapter 16. Amen.
[33:34] And he want to build a church. So and
[33:36] they have great followers going with
[33:37] him. So he he he called his disciples.
[33:41] He said well uh who do men say I this
[33:44] number I am. And uh they begin to give
[33:47] their own suggestion their own ideas. Oh
[33:49] I had some bre some group of believers
[33:51] there. They were saying that you are
[33:53] John the Baptist. Okay. They say okay
[33:57] what what do you have to say? He said I
[33:59] even had some say that you are
[34:00] Jeremiah's. Some say you are uh Elias
[34:04] and others said you are one of the
[34:06] prophets. Wonderful. So you can see that
[34:09] they all have divided opinion of who I
[34:11] am. Amen. Abraham said that why is there
[34:14] division in the church? He said is
[34:16] because of lack of revelation. That is
[34:19] what causes a division. So but if the
[34:21] people can get the revelation of who he
[34:23] is and where the church is in harmony
[34:25] with that revelation, there will be no
[34:27] division at all. They will all say one
[34:30] thing. They have one mind, one faith,
[34:32] one baptism, one Lord, another fish and
[34:35] start. Amen.
[34:38] Hallelujah.
[34:40] Praise God.
[34:42] So he said, "Now my disciples, you have
[34:46] been walking with me, you eat with me,
[34:49] you sleep with me, and we all rejoice
[34:52] and uh worship together." He said, "Then
[34:54] who do you not say that I not?" Amen.
[34:58] Because now you have now understand that
[35:00] there's confusion out there. They don't
[35:02] know who I am. Then what about you?
[35:04] Amen. What was Jesus trying to do? He
[35:07] was trying to open a channel. Praise
[35:10] God. Amen. Said, "Who do you say I am?"
[35:13] And all of a sudden the channel got
[35:15] open. The clunging pull out. Praise God.
[35:18] And Peter stood up there. He said, "Thou
[35:20] art the Christ, the son of the living
[35:23] God." Hallelujah. And that moved Jesus.
[35:26] Amen. I said Jesus I said Peter. Amen.
[35:30] Now let me tell you once you catch a
[35:33] revelation of who God is then he gives
[35:36] you the revelation of who you are. Amen.
[35:39] And the church must catch this
[35:40] revelation of who God is of who you are
[35:43] and who the devil is.
[35:47] Praise God. Say thou art Peter, thou art
[35:49] Peter rock said upon this system of
[35:52] revelation I will build my church and
[35:55] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[35:57] it. Hallelujah. So you see the church is
[36:00] built upon revelation. Amen. Upon direct
[36:02] direct inspiration for Peter became a
[36:05] channel of communication. Hallelujah.
[36:08] And by direct inspiration. Amen. What
[36:11] was that? It was St. John 5:e 19. The
[36:15] son do nothing except what the father
[36:16] revealed to him. The father walketh at
[36:18] the to the son walketh ed to see. Amen.
[36:21] The father and the son was in harmony.
[36:24] And brother said this same harmony we
[36:27] exist between amen. Between the church
[36:29] and Christ. Same harmony that Jesus
[36:32] operate in with God. Amen. The father.
[36:35] Amen. The same harmony with Jesus and
[36:38] the bride.
[36:41] Channel of communication. Amen. Amen. So
[36:45] now said now what Adam was in God. He
[36:49] said Christ redeem us back to that.
[36:52] Did you get that? Say what Adam was in
[36:55] God. Christ redeem us back to that. He
[36:58] said now a redeemer to redeem anything
[37:01] is to bring it back to its origin again.
[37:05] Amen. So and Adam never had to be sick.
[37:09] He never had to die. He never had to
[37:12] worry. Amen. He never had to heartache.
[37:16] He never had to fear. He just climbed in
[37:19] the arm of the father God. Amen. And
[37:22] just like a child, everything was his.
[37:27] Praise the Lord. You see why Jesus said,
[37:29] "Ask what you will." Say, "Anything you
[37:32] ask the father in my name, I will do
[37:34] it." Praise God. Say, "Whatever you ask,
[37:37] I will do it." So that your joy may be
[37:40] in full. Amen. Because Jesus doesn't
[37:42] want the church to be warning.
[37:45] Hallelujah. Don't want to see you sad.
[37:47] Don't want to see you being frustrated
[37:49] or depressed. Jesus never want to see
[37:51] you that way. He want to see you happy.
[37:54] God want to see you always happy.
[37:58] Amen. Say ask it shall be given that
[38:02] your joy may be in full. What? Whether
[38:05] it's a spiritual blessing, whether it's
[38:07] a material blessing, whether it is a
[38:10] physical blessing, whatever it is, say
[38:12] you just ask it. I want to see you
[38:14] happy. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So
[38:19] Adam as a child just like a child
[38:22] everything was his say whatever he asks
[38:25] why he got it. Amen. Everything obey him
[38:29] because he was God's child and the child
[38:32] the God child is an heir to all things
[38:35] and we are heir to all things. We are
[38:37] God's child, God's children and as
[38:40] children of God, we are heir to all
[38:42] things. Yes. Amen. So now when man fell,
[38:46] Abraham said he lost this.
[38:50] Now what he lost in the fall, Christ
[38:53] come as a redeemer.
[38:55] Say, did you ever stop to think he was
[38:57] asking the church? Say, did you ever
[38:59] stop to think what Christ came to redeem
[39:02] us for as a church? Have you ever
[39:05] stopped to think or consider what Christ
[39:09] came to redeem us for?
[39:11] He said he gave us eternal life,
[39:14] everlasting life. Did you agree with
[39:16] that? Amen. And he brought us back to
[39:19] eternal fellowship and relationship to
[39:22] God. Amen. to be sons and daughters
[39:25] again to restore us back to all that
[39:30] Adam lost in the fall. It belong to you
[39:32] and I. So every dentive blessings that
[39:36] is in this Bible belong to you. It
[39:39] belong to me. It belong to us. We are to
[39:42] exercise our faith authority that it is
[39:45] mine. Mine mine mine mine mine.
[39:48] Hallelujah. And you Amen. You got to
[39:51] make footprint.
[39:53] Hallelujah. Possess every ground that
[39:56] you are standing on. Hallelujah. And it
[39:58] belong to you. Praise God. But what the
[40:01] church need is to make footprint. Make
[40:04] advanced steps advanced step.
[40:11] I wanted to have a church. I need a
[40:14] land, but I don't have money.
[40:18] So I said, what do I do? But I have God.
[40:21] Amen. I have God. Amen. So I said, "But
[40:24] I don't have money, but I have God."
[40:26] So I I started telling people, "I want I
[40:29] need a land where we have a church." So
[40:32] somebody told me it's a land they
[40:34] selling. No, it's just a labor in church
[40:38] that tell me that a land that they
[40:41] selling. I said, "Okay, good. Let let us
[40:43] go there." And I went there. I don't
[40:45] have money in my pocket, but when I get
[40:47] to the land, I look at it, it was a
[40:49] choice place. Amen. And I know what God
[40:53] said. Because my heavenly father owns
[40:56] heaven and earth. Say the earth is the
[40:58] Lord, the fullness thereof. I begin to
[41:00] make footprint. I begin to walk around
[41:03] the land. I said, this land is my land.
[41:06] I said, Father God, this land belong to
[41:07] me. I'm taking it over. I take it over.
[41:11] It's my land. Amen. It belong to me.
[41:15] I said, "Lord, nobody will buy this
[41:17] land. I am the one that is having this
[41:20] land." Amen. I've established my
[41:24] footprint and nothing can take it off
[41:26] because you make a promise that wherever
[41:28] the soul of my feet are upon, you gave
[41:31] it to me for an inheritance. And so this
[41:33] land is my inheritance.
[41:36] Praise God. And I went home. I said,
[41:40] "Okay, now let me now make a step of
[41:41] faith now and try to raise some raise
[41:44] some money. I try to make some savings."
[41:46] Amen. Get out some savings. And the land
[41:48] was about 150 60,000 naira. So I was
[41:51] making some savings and uh I just I've
[41:54] been able to raise up about uh 60,000.
[41:57] Amen. I was thanking God that I'm making
[41:59] advance. Amen. I said as far as I'm
[42:01] concerned, nobody will take that land
[42:03] because I have put my footstep there.
[42:06] That's right. Amen. So uh my the brother
[42:10] who told me the place he told him the

[42:16] the want to buy the land and so forth.
[42:18] So you mean that say yes okay well let

[42:30] the brother. He said look take me to
[42:32] your pastor because I needed money now.
[42:35] I needed to pay for the land. So they
[42:37] came to my place. When they came to my

[42:42] said, "Well, you wanted to buy the
[42:43] land." I said, "Yes, I wanted to buy buy

[47:26] ruled in the affairs of men. The hearts
[47:28] of king are in his hands. He controls
[47:31] all humans life. And the bible said that
[47:33] kings shall bear us. And the bible also
[47:36] promise us that which inherit the riches
[47:38] of the gentiles. Amen. That's what it

[48:10] waste that time. I said, "Now you pick
[48:12] your phone and call him as a son of
[48:14] God." I said, "Before you call him," I
[48:16] said, "God will go ahead of you." Amen.
[48:19] Because his heart is in the hand of God.
[48:21] Amen. He doesn't control his heart.
[48:24] Amen. The Bible said he hardened
[48:25] Pharaoh's heart. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[48:28] Even before Moses get there, he haden
[48:30] Pharaoh's heart. So, he controls human
[48:32] heart. I said, "You call him." So, he
[48:35] called him that night. It was around uh

[49:23] to go to the bank. He said don't go to
[49:25] the bank that money is the interest is
[49:27] too high. I said then then you give me
[49:29] the money. Praise the Lord. Amen. So he
[49:33] said well I don't have that kind of
[49:34] money. He switch up the phone about

[49:40] said h what we have been discussing

[50:03] project in hand

[50:08] take loan. Then he switch up the phone
[50:10] again. So the brother he called me. I
[50:13] said brother relax. Said God is working
[50:16] on him. Amen. God is dealing with him
[50:18] now because the heart of kings are in
[50:20] his hands. He control the human heart.
[50:22] Said just calm yourself. Relax. Don't
[50:25] bother yourself. Just calm. I said that
[50:27] land that property belong to you. Amen.
[50:30] So after a while about 10 minutes time
[50:32] he called again. He said, "Yes, bro."
[50:35] Say, "Why you keep disturbing me? You
[50:37] don't You said you can't help me, and
[50:38] yet you're calling my phone, my my line.
[50:41] You're calling my He said, "No." He
[50:43] said, "I call a line because I'm
[50:45] restless."
[50:46] He said, "And my heart is disturbing me.
[50:49] But that I give you the money. I will
[50:52] give you the 36 million so that I can
[50:54] have rest in my heart."
[50:57] Say, "So, say, so but how will you pay
[50:59] me? How will you refund the money? How
[51:00] will you pay it?" He said, "Well, you
[51:03] just uh state the terms of payment,
[51:06] right?" Said, "What can how much can you
[51:08] pay in a month?" But the brother said,
[51:11] "I can I can give you 3 million every
[51:13] month." Said, "But the 3 million is
[51:15] little." I said, "Well," he said, "Well,
[51:17] that's what I can afford to give you 3
[51:18] million every month." He said, "Okay,
[51:20] fine. I accept it.
[51:23] Let me give you the money. Then you can
[51:25] pay for the land." Praise the Lord.
[51:27] Amen. So about that time, so when they
[51:29] went for the meeting to pay for the
[51:31] land, then there were a lot of biders
[51:33] that came in and begin to bid at higher
[51:35] price. Some say 60 60 million 60
[51:40] million. So uh the brother said but we
[51:44] have discussed this we have end up at 36
[51:46] million. Why you say 60 million?
[51:49] He said, "Well, uh, well, because we
[51:51] have agreed for 36 million, uh, what we
[51:55] can do for you now is you have to pay 50
[51:56] million because others are bidding for
[51:58] 60 million. You have to pay 50 million."
[52:01] The brother called me and said, "Pastor,
[52:03] the matter has changed that the sellers
[52:06] are saying 50 million." I said, "Well,
[52:08] if it's 50 million, buy it." I said,
[52:11] "Because the place worth 80 million. So,
[52:14] if it's 60 million, 50 million, buy it.
[52:16] Take it over." Said, "But how do I make
[52:18] it?" I said the God that provided the
[52:20] first will also provide the second. So
[52:24] you just go take just make footprint.
[52:27] What you do? Pay the 35 million first.
[52:29] 36 million. Pay that first. Said the
[52:31] balance you are going to pay. Don't
[52:33] worry. He said then let me sell my car.
[52:34] I said you are not going to sell any
[52:36] car. You are not selling any car. The
[52:38] car is yours. It's useful to your
[52:40] business. You are not selling any car. I
[52:42] said look the word of God is the
[52:44] creative power of God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[52:47] The word of God can create. You just
[52:50] take God at his word. Then let God
[52:53] defend his word. Say if God can't defend
[52:55] his word, then God is powerless. Amen.
[52:58] Amen. You are Are you not a believer?
[53:00] You say, "Yes, I'm a believer." Then
[53:02] stand there. Hallelujah. Whatever go
[53:04] stand there, God will bring to pass his
[53:07] word. Hallelujah.
[53:10] So later he called me he said pastor
[53:15] some friends who had that I'm buying
[53:17] this property said well they said to
[53:19] assist me son said well oh I learn that
[53:22] you are buying this property he said yes

[53:40] Amen. Faith is very simple. Amen.
[53:44] Abraham said faith is uh is as simple as
[53:47] this. It's like use it as an a soap with
[53:51] high soap with he said look if I was
[53:53] going to the go for hunting

[54:02] the house and I forgot my knife. Right.
[54:06] Amen. My hunting knife. I forgot on the
[54:08] table. So I left for hunting. And uh
[54:12] when I get into the forest, I found that
[54:15] I need to use a knife. So I begin to
[54:19] look for the knife. I couldn't find it.
[54:21] I checked my pocket. I couldn't find the
[54:23] knife. So I started thinking. Then I
[54:25] remember I realized that oh I forgot the
[54:28] knife at home where I was eating. I
[54:30] forgot that knife. Amen. My mind say I
[54:33] forgot the knife. He said what is faith?
[54:36] Now you are going to reject what your
[54:38] mind said. Amen. Though your mind is
[54:40] saying truth that you forget the knife.
[54:43] Amen. But faith is you are going to
[54:45] denounce your mind. You will say I never
[54:48] forget that knife. Amen. You keep
[54:51] repeating I never forget. Repeat it. I
[54:53] never forget that knife. Amen. Look, let
[54:56] me tell you. God will make your body to
[54:59] obey your confession. If your body say
[55:02] you are sick, you say no, I am healed.
[55:05] Amen. I am healed. I am healed. Your
[55:07] body will obey your confession.
[55:09] Hallelujah. Amen. The prophet say look
[55:14] he said he said when a man even tell a
[55:16] lie and he keep on repeating that lie he
[55:20] said after a while the lie will become
[55:21] truth to him. Did you get it? Yes. Amen.
[55:25] What about if a man will tell a lie and
[55:27] the lie will become truth to him? What
[55:28] about if you're telling the truth? Amen.
[55:31] Eh praise the Lord. Right. What about if
[55:34] you're making confession? Amen. That by
[55:37] his stripe I am healed. Amen. I am
[55:39] delivered. Amen. I am set free. Amen.
[55:42] Amen. When you keep on saying that your
[55:44] the cells in your body are obeying it.
[55:47] Amen. He said the Bible said let the
[55:49] poor say that I am rich. Hallelujah. You
[55:53] have no money in your pocket. You say I
[55:54] am rich. Amen. I am rich. I am yeast.
[55:58] Hallelujah. Your body will obey it.
[56:00] Amen. Amen. Because it will come to
[56:02] pass. Amen.
[56:05] So Abraham said he said if you keep on
[56:08] confessing that that no I did not forget
[56:11] this knife. The knife is somewhere we
[56:12] know I came with a knife and your mind
[56:14] said no you you forgot the knife. You
[56:16] make use of the knife at home and you
[56:18] said no no no no I I I know I use the
[56:20] knife but no I not forget it. I came
[56:21] with it. I I came with that knife. He
[56:24] said and you begin to look for the
[56:25] knife. Amen. And your mind is saying
[56:27] that you forget the knife. Just stop
[56:29] disturbing yourself and you say no I not
[56:32] forget the knife. Amen. Now you are
[56:34] going to adapt your mind. You will doubt
[56:36] your thoughts. Amen. Say if you keep on
[56:39] doing that he say after a while he said
[56:42] your faith we go home go to the house
[56:45] say we pick the knife from the table he
[56:47] say we put it in your pocket. Amen. Say
[56:49] you put your hand in the pocket you'll
[56:51] find a knife there. Say yes I said I I I
[56:53] did not forget the knife. Say that is
[56:55] how faith operate. Hallelujah. He call
[56:57] everything contrary. Faith, Paul said,
[57:00] is a substance of things. So far, and
[57:03] evidence of things not seen. Amen.
[57:06] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. Amen. It
[57:09] work in the realms of the unseen.
[57:12] Amen. Amen. So, Brother was saying here,
[57:16] Amen.
[57:18] He said the thing of it is that since he
[57:20] has restored man back to his place, man
[57:24] in the fall has lost his conscience of
[57:27] what the father put him here on earth to
[57:29] do. That is the problem with the church.
[57:32] Amen. So the great thing I found in the
[57:35] church is fear.
[57:38] The church is always afraid to act on
[57:40] God's word. Amen. So he was speaking in
[57:43] pastor's vision. Abraham said now
[57:47] it say cut every obstacle from the human
[57:49] being. Cut it out. Amen. That they might
[57:53] be connected like in the garden of Eden.
[57:56] Paragraph 23 to 251. 251. He said I was
[58:00] going to I was going to shook you
[58:03] say but I'm going to say it. He said man
[58:07] is omnipotent. Anybody believe that?
[58:10] Amen. He said man is omnipotent. said
[58:13] you don't believe that said but he is a
[58:17] man fully surrendered to God is
[58:19] omnipotent
[58:21] and we see that the Bible demonstrated
[58:23] it in Joshua praise God Joshua was a man
[58:27] in the path of duty praise God and the
[58:31] Amorite have ran him up is in battle
[58:34] with the Amorite and he needed sunlight
[58:37] to fight Amen and the sunlight is a
[58:40] natural element amen Amen. And he had
[58:42] light to fight with. And and the Bible
[58:45] did not know that Joshua now went into
[58:47] fasting and prayer. Like some of us
[58:49] would do, bro, let us fast, church. Let
[58:51] us fast. We need to make a fast. Let let
[58:53] us fast. Let us seek the face of God and
[58:55] fast. Amen. Joshua never did that.
[58:58] Joshua never called for a prayer
[59:00] meeting. Let us have a prayer meeting
[59:02] for God to move. He never did that. But
[59:04] Joshua recognized that he's in direct is
[59:07] in line of duty. He know that he's a son
[59:10] of God. As the son of God is an heir to
[59:13] God's promises. Amen. He looked at the
[59:16] son. Amen. He said, "Son, stand still."
[59:20] He look at the most anger in the valley
[59:22] of Aderon because I'm to defeat the
[59:25] enemy. If the church can take that
[59:27] stand. Hallelujah. Praise God. Even
[59:30] against
[59:32] nature, stand against nature and take
[59:35] his stand against the enemy. Amen. Amen.
[59:38] If church can take that stand, if the
[59:39] man can if the church can only speak
[59:42] what God want to hear is your word.
[59:46] Amen. Say say speak the word only.
[59:51] That's all. Say speak the word only
[59:55] because the Romans recognize that Jesus
[59:59] was a man with authority. Hallelujah.
[1:00:02] Said what about the church? Amen. Can
[1:00:05] they recognize that they are men sons of
[1:00:08] God with authority to speak the word and
[1:00:11] the word we and and anything that is
[1:00:14] contrary will obey him.
[1:00:16] Amen. God answered Joshua. It was not
[1:00:20] God that said son stand still. It was
[1:00:22] Joshua that said son stand still and God
[1:00:26] hearken to the voice of a man. Praise
[1:00:29] God. And we can see Elijah. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:33] He did demonstrate it. Elijah, he was
[1:00:36] tired of all this stuff that was going
[1:00:39] on in Israel. How Elizabeth, Amen, has
[1:00:43] converted the entire Israel into B
[1:00:46] worship. He offers scholarship, Amen. to
[1:00:50] Jehovah's ministers, Amen. And all the
[1:00:53] young men from Bible school have taken
[1:00:55] the message of Jezebel out. And then the
[1:00:57] entire Israel has been converted until
[1:00:59] Elijah think that he's the only one
[1:01:01] left. Amen. Amen. Yes. Praise God. Amen.
[1:01:04] And he was so tired of the system. He
[1:01:07] walked before Ahab. He said, "Ahab,
[1:01:10] I am sick and tired of what you're doing
[1:01:13] of what is going on now." Hallelujah. He
[1:01:15] said, "Let me tell you, Ahab, look,
[1:01:17] there shall be no rain. There shall be
[1:01:20] no due. Amen. Until I call for it
[1:01:24] according to my word." Amen. Amen.
[1:01:27] Right. And Ahab must have thought that
[1:01:29] maybe he said this his words. life
[1:01:31] because he said according to my words
[1:01:33] but if it's your word there's no problem
[1:01:36] after not god you are just a man like me
[1:01:39] you can go because if he have said
[1:01:42] according to the lord word of the lord
[1:01:44] aab could have check amen could have
[1:01:46] pinch himself what is going on are you
[1:01:48] getting me but he said according to my
[1:01:50] word and just downplay what he said but

[1:01:57] lock up the heavens
[1:01:59] amen you know that Whatever he bind on
[1:02:02] earth is bad in heaven. He lock up the
[1:02:04] heaven and put the key in his pocket.
[1:02:06] And he went to the brook share it.
[1:02:08] Praise the Lord. Because they know that
[1:02:11] what he said the father will honor it.
[1:02:15] Can you imagine three years no rain and
[1:02:17] they looking for Elijah? Why were they
[1:02:19] looking for Elijah?
[1:02:22] You think they never pray? You think
[1:02:24] they never see the face of God? They
[1:02:26] must have been praying and seeking God's
[1:02:28] face. And God is said, "What is
[1:02:30] happening?" He said, "We needed rain. We
[1:02:33] need rain. Why you disturbing me?" I
[1:02:35] never lock up the heavens. If you need
[1:02:37] rain, go and look for Elijah. The key is
[1:02:40] with Elijah. He lock up the heavens.
[1:02:42] Elijah will open the heavens.
[1:02:45] Hallelujah. Praise be to God. Because
[1:02:48] it's a scriptural promise that whatever
[1:02:50] you bind is bound in heaven. Amen.
[1:02:52] Whatever you decree shall be
[1:02:54] established.
[1:02:57] Praise God. Hallelujah. You can look at

[1:03:18] him. And he get him a place. You know,
[1:03:21] Elijah went in with Ghazi and he saw
[1:03:25] meal well prepared on the table. And
[1:03:27] this man must have eaten. After eating,
[1:03:29] he gets satisfied. Look, let me tell
[1:03:31] you. When a man is satisfied, he's
[1:03:32] happy. Amen. Right. And when a man of

[1:08:25] But Elisha was not satisfied. said, "How
[1:08:28] can this lady be doing all this
[1:08:30] wonderful thing for me, making me feel
[1:08:31] so good like this? I need to do
[1:08:33] something for this woman." And Jesus
[1:08:35] said, "If you go into any home and the
[1:08:38] home receive you, say whatever he said
[1:08:41] it is and then bless the home."
[1:08:45] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. He gave
[1:08:48] you power to bless. Amen. He gave you
[1:08:50] power to speak and he will do it. Amen.

[1:09:06] this house once. There have never been a
[1:09:09] child cry or um play around in this
[1:09:12] house. Elijah said oh my god that is
[1:09:16] true. Please call the woman back. Call
[1:09:18] her bring her back. And she came and
[1:09:21] stand at the door and Elijah looked at
[1:09:24] him. Elisha look at him and look at her.
[1:09:27] He said look woman said by this time
[1:09:29] next year you are going to embrace a
[1:09:32] baby boy. Amen. And the woman said oh
[1:09:36] man of God don't tell me don't tell lie
[1:09:38] to me. Why? Because Elisha never said to
[1:09:41] say the Lord. Amen. Are you getting me
[1:09:43] church? He never said to see the Lord.
[1:09:46] Say by this time next year you will
[1:09:48] embrace a baby. Hallelujah. and he left
[1:09:52] and God give her a baby boy. Do you see
[1:09:55] that church? Let me tell you in Kenya
[1:09:57] the first time I went to Ken.
[1:10:00] I preached in Black Guar.
[1:10:04] After preaching I went down to the I
[1:10:05] went I went out to the where the car
[1:10:07] park car was they parked their car. So
[1:10:10] while I was while standing there a
[1:10:12] brother came to me with his wife he said
[1:10:15] well I am broango. I said okay well how
[1:10:18] are you? They said fine this is my wife
[1:10:20] sister matrix. I said great. He said
[1:10:22] please
[1:10:24] I would like you to visit me before you
[1:10:27] leave. I said you mean that? I say yes.
[1:10:30] I said okay fine but one thing you will
[1:10:32] do you have to tell your pastor first.
[1:10:35] If your pastor approved that then I will
[1:10:37] come. Yes only on that condition. Amen.
[1:10:40] Amen. So when I was about to leave the
[1:10:43] eve of my living Kenya the pastor called
[1:10:46] Mr. Braameda. I would like us to visit
[1:10:48] the brother. I said fine let us go. So
[1:10:51] we went to the brass house. It was
[1:10:52] brother James and Yago. We get there.
[1:10:55] The brother prepare all manner of meal
[1:10:57] on the table like a feast. Wow. So we
[1:11:01] ate. After eating I enjoyed myself
[1:11:04] pretty good at night. Pretty good. So we
[1:11:08] are about to leave. I said okay let us
[1:11:09] have a word of prayer. So and uh
[1:11:12] Brianago stood up. I said bango do you
[1:11:14] have do you don't you have any need in
[1:11:16] this you don't do have any need before
[1:11:17] you spend so much and take care of us
[1:11:20] like this I think you should have a need
[1:11:21] what is that he said bro kamea actually
[1:11:25] we have married for a couple of years
[1:11:27] now but there's no baby I said why said
[1:11:31] the doctor said that it is impossible
[1:11:34] for my wife to have a child that they
[1:11:37] can never be pregnant
[1:11:39] so that is the problem we have I said Oh
[1:11:43] god inspired that scripture to me about
[1:11:47] Elijah. Amen. I said God
[1:11:50] this man has make me happy. I've enjoyed
[1:11:53] myself. I said young the only thing I
[1:11:56] have to tell you is that by this time
[1:11:59] next year before I come to when I come
[1:12:02] to Kenya you'll be carrying your baby. I
[1:12:05] just said I never have a dream. It
[1:12:07] wasn't a vision. Amen. But it was the
[1:12:10] scripture inspired to my heart. Amen.
[1:12:12] Amen. Say if God could do that for
[1:12:14] Elisha, he can do that for me also too.
[1:12:17] If Elijah is happy and he bless that
[1:12:19] woman, I am happy. I will bless this
[1:12:21] woman. Amen. Hallelujah. So I spoke it
[1:12:25] and I left. So the preceding year I came

[1:18:22] I was in a bra Oscar's church in
[1:18:25] Lewisville, Kentucky. And in the e that
[1:18:28] was on Saturday night uh with my host,
[1:18:31] we're discussing and we're testifying
[1:18:33] about or testifying about God's wonder,
[1:18:36] God works and his power and his
[1:18:38] blessings that uh with this message that
[1:18:40] God has given to us. So the the minister
[1:18:43] told me say brada
[1:18:46] brother then says brada he said you
[1:18:48] ministers you always talk preach and
[1:18:50] preach and preach nothing happen
[1:18:53] I have not seen anything happen I said w
[1:18:56] bro things are going on get into mission
[1:18:59] feed amen you are going to comfort three
[1:19:01] devils out there you going to see things
[1:19:04] happen that right there you say see God
[1:19:07] the faith need an atmosphere
[1:19:10] to operate Amen. The church got to
[1:19:14] create the atmosphere and then faith he
[1:19:16] begin to create things to happen among
[1:19:20] the people. Amen. So I telling him said
[1:19:22] no bra no there's nothing not nothing
[1:19:25] happened nothing but like that I said
[1:19:27] because he had not seen that in the
[1:19:28] message. I said well bro
[1:19:31] you will see it.
[1:19:33] So I was in Oscar on Sunday. He took me
[1:19:35] to Oscar church on Sunday to preach like
[1:19:38] Abra God brought me here. So uh I preach
[1:19:41] there and I preach on the power of
[1:19:43] faith. So I tell the church I'm not
[1:19:45] preaching on the power of God. Amen. I
[1:19:48] said there's a power of God. I said and
[1:19:51] there's power of Satan. I said but we're
[1:19:54] talking about the power of faith. Amen.
[1:19:56] So I narrate the quote on bra when he he
[1:19:59] was speaking to that chandelier when he
[1:20:01] told that sister you know the quote
[1:20:03] there about brother sister that uh was
[1:20:05] dying and so forth and I tried to preach
[1:20:07] faith to the sister and the sister was
[1:20:09] still arguing and so forth said well
[1:20:10] look he said and she claimed she has
[1:20:12] faith but say she doesn't have faith and
[1:20:15] I say now look at the shalia said look
[1:20:17] can you say shalia and the sister say
[1:20:19] yes say now say can your can you be able
[1:20:22] to make the chala to move around and
[1:20:25] move
[1:20:26] And the sister said, "No, no, nobody can
[1:20:28] do that." But said, "Yes, I can." He
[1:20:31] said, "Then then you then you do it. If
[1:20:33] you have the faith to do that." So now
[1:20:35] look at the chandelier and move his head
[1:20:38] and the chandelier move and move his
[1:20:40] head and move his head and the teeth
[1:20:41] begin to move turn around and still his
[1:20:44] head and the chandela stood and the
[1:20:47] ladies screamed and said, "Oh, you have
[1:20:49] bewitched it."
[1:20:52] Say you bewitched that, right? Abraham
[1:20:54] said no not bewish that is it then what
[1:20:56] happened is it god that make the shalia
[1:20:59] to move around said no
[1:21:04] is it is it Satan said no I pray you who
[1:21:07] made it to move said I make it to move
[1:21:10] he said but you are far away from it how
[1:21:12] do you move it he said my faith move
[1:21:14] that hallelujah said that is the power
[1:21:17] of faith hallelujah and brother said
[1:21:19] even magician use it now if magicians
[1:21:22] will use faith what about the church of
[1:21:24] God. Amen. What about the church of God?
[1:21:27] Amen. He said by faith by faith and
[1:21:29] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:21:31] God. All the armors of the Christian
[1:21:34] armor is based on faith. Amen.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah. Say if the church don't have
[1:21:41] faith for divine healing, how will they
[1:21:42] have rapturing faith to be changed in a
[1:21:45] moment? Talk about that. Amen. Say but
[1:21:46] the power of God data
[1:21:52] that it won't happen. But let me tell
[1:21:53] you it will happen. All things are
[1:21:56] possible to them that believe. Amen.
[1:22:00] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. So I
[1:22:04] said let us we are going to use the
[1:22:05] power of faith this afternoon. So when I
[1:22:10] finished the message and I call for the
[1:22:11] prayer line and the people came to the
[1:22:14] line to be prayed for. So I was praying
[1:22:17] for the people. I noticed a sister. She
[1:22:21] knelt down praying. After a while, she
[1:22:23] stood up and she went back to her seat
[1:22:25] and sat down. I was still praying for
[1:22:27] them coming towards her. The sister let
[1:22:30] stood up from the seat and they came to
[1:22:32] the altar and they let down again. I get
[1:22:35] to her and I prayed for her. So after I
[1:22:37] finished praying, I left went to the
[1:22:39] office. So the brother ran to my office,
[1:22:42] the one that we argued the previous
[1:22:44] night, Saturday night. So the brother
[1:22:46] came to the office. He said, "Pastor." I
[1:22:49] said, "What's that?" He said, "Come
[1:22:50] over. Come for come and hear a
[1:22:51] testimony. Come over. Come over.
[1:22:54] I said, "Okay, what is going on?" He
[1:22:55] said, "Brada, I have had but today I can
[1:23:00] see."

[1:40:36] said, "Okay, fine. You go bring it." And
[1:40:39] he brought it bus and a t-shirt to drop
[1:40:42] it on the on the pastor's table. And I
[1:40:46] said, "Lord,
[1:40:48] you heard what the sister said. She said
[1:40:51] she brought this shite up in the fear of
[1:40:53] the Lord."
[1:40:55] And Abraham said, "The child may depart
[1:40:58] from St. John 3:16." said, "But St. John
[1:41:00] 3:16 can never depart from the child." I
[1:41:03] said, "Lord, the enemy has illegally
[1:41:06] take this child. Please restore this
[1:41:09] side back to the mother. The mother
[1:41:11] heart is bleeding for this child." I
[1:41:13] said, "Now Lord, please anoint this
[1:41:16] dress like you did anoint apron from the
[1:41:20] body of St. Paul. Anoint this dress that
[1:41:23] when this boy if he ever put on this
[1:41:25] dress, take that demon from that side."
[1:41:28] Amen.
[1:41:30] After we prayed, he gave it to the
[1:41:32] sister and the sister went with it.
[1:41:34] Amen. So he dropped the dress on the
[1:41:37] bed, the boy's room. In the boy's room,
[1:41:40] on the bed in the boy's room, this man's
[1:41:42] room. So when he came back from work and
[1:41:45] uh he found the dress on his bed, he had
[1:41:48] to call the mother said, "Mom, mom." The
[1:41:51] mother came said, "What's the matter?"
[1:41:53] He said, "I've been looking for this
[1:41:55] dress. I've been looking for this dress.
[1:41:58] I I've searched everywhere. I can't find
[1:41:59] this dress. Who put this dress here?
[1:42:02] The mom said, you've been looking for
[1:42:04] the dress. He said, "Yes, if you're
[1:42:07] looking for the dress and you found a
[1:42:08] dress, then you take it. Why you asking
[1:42:11] me you have found a dress? Then take
[1:42:13] it." Yeah.
[1:42:15] And the mom walked away. So he took his
[1:42:17] bath and uh take up the dress and he put
[1:42:21] on the dress that evening. So the sister
[1:42:25] was testifying.
[1:42:26] He said that around 2:00 a.m. in in the
[1:42:30] morning that they started hearing voice
[1:42:32] coming out of the boys room and he stood
[1:42:36] up said what is going on? He was hearing
[1:42:38] weeping crying like that. So he went
[1:42:41] there and then knocked the door and
[1:42:43] opened the door. There he found the son
[1:42:46] lying with knees on the ground and his
[1:42:48] hand on the bed. He was the boy was just
[1:42:51] weeping and crying saying, "Oh God, why

[1:44:23] of your servant or your son or daughter?
[1:44:28] He asks. He said, "Oh my, a prayer of a
[1:44:33] saint will go a million times higher
[1:44:37] than an angel because we are sons of
[1:44:40] God." Hallelujah. But sometime we come

[1:46:07] God don't answer prayer. Can't he can't
[1:46:09] answer our prayer. What make you think
[1:46:11] that God God answers prayer?

[1:46:37] said no man could tame him, right? He
[1:46:40] break offs, rip his clothes. Nobody
[1:46:43] could tame that devil. Amen. But when he
[1:46:45] saw Jesus, amen, he made an advance. But
[1:46:49] sometimes some of us are afraid to make
[1:46:50] an advance.
[1:46:52] You can't come to prayer. You can't come
[1:46:54] to the altar to pray. You afraid to make
[1:46:56] an advance. And yet he don't even have
[1:46:58] the number of demon that brother have.
[1:47:00] But the made an advance to come to see
[1:47:03] Jesus. Jesus not go to meet him at the
[1:47:05] tomb. But he came out of the tomb. Amen.
[1:47:08] Against his will. He make advance to
[1:47:10] meet Jesus there. Hallelujah. because he

[1:47:15] go home the same. He can't leave the
[1:47:17] church the same. There's something going
[1:47:19] to happen to him.
[1:47:22] And the brother came before Jesus, knelt
[1:47:26] down before Jesus. And Jesus said, look
[1:47:29] at the demon that possessed the brother
[1:47:31] and said, "Who are you?"
[1:47:34] He said, "My name is Le." What is your
[1:47:36] name? My name is Leon. Said because we
[1:47:39] are many. We are very, very many. Amen.
[1:47:43] So your man say yes. Say my name is
[1:47:45] Legion. He said but have you come to
[1:47:46] destroy me before my time? You know
[1:47:48] that. Amen. God has a distorted power.
[1:47:51] Amen. And the devil will be destroyed.
[1:47:52] Be cast in lake of fire. Say but have
[1:47:54] you come to destroy me before my time?
[1:47:56] Amen. And the devil put a prayer
[1:47:59] request.
[1:48:01] Amen. He wrote a prayer request to
[1:48:04] Jesus.
[1:48:06] He said Lord said do you see that swine
[1:48:08] there?
[1:48:10] It's a man that had an investment there.
[1:48:12] Say, but the man doesn't pay tithe.
[1:48:14] Amen. He eat he always eat his tithe.
[1:48:17] And you said we shall send the devil for
[1:48:19] name sake.
[1:48:21] Praise the Lord. He has an investment.
[1:48:25] He skip this wine. Amen. He said,
[1:48:28] "Please, I pray you let me go to that
[1:48:30] one. Let me let me go there."
[1:48:32] Hallelujah. And destroy that business.
[1:48:35] Amen. Amen. Yes. Now Jesus knew that he
[1:48:38] was going to destroy the man investment.
[1:48:40] Don't he know that? Don't Jesus know
[1:48:42] that that the man has that that was the
[1:48:44] man's investment. That was a man's
[1:48:46] business. And Jesus knew that. And this
[1:48:49] demon were praying Jesus that please let
[1:48:52] us go there to the swine. Did Jesus
[1:48:55] answer the demon prayers? Yes. So did he
[1:48:58] did Jesus answer the demon prayer? Did
[1:49:00] he answer legion's prayer? The legion
[1:49:02] went there. Now if Jesus could answer a
[1:49:04] demon prayers that is mischievous. What
[1:49:07] about you sons and daughters of God?
[1:49:10] Hallelujah. What about you sons and
[1:49:12] daughters of God? Hallelujah. Is here to

[1:49:16] anointing is here to answer your prayer.

[1:49:32] are. This is sunship authority.
