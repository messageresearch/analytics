So good to be in the house of the Lord today. And um what a promise where two or three are gathered together in his name. &gt;&gt; We don't have to see him. We don't have to feel him. &gt;&gt; We know he's true to his word. &gt;&gt; He is here in our midst. What a privilege it is to be in the house of the Lord with the presence of the Lord today. Um God bless you. Let's turn in our Bibles to the book of 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. [snorts] Um, as we have in the past, we've uh tried to give up Wednesday so we could have more time for the sisters to um prepare for the Thursday Thanksgiving and just try to have a little break with the with the family. And so we're going to have our thanksgiving message this morning and be as brother Ron was expressing to be thankful for all that we have. Amen. Uh just a little testimony. We uh we heard that um um Cheryl's mom Nancy had really enjoyed being here &gt;&gt; and um she just said that all the people really seemed happy and want really wanted to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so God bless you for that because that's all you. Amen. So, she's uh out north uh now uh trying to finish closing up things there and uh we hope to see her again here. Um that would be just wonderful to get the word right inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Before we uh read just a verse here, let's look to the Lord in prayer. How many desires something from the Lord today? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's believe it. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come to you as as your bride, as your body, and as as your people, Lord, knowing that you have a heart for us, and we have a heart for you, and there's needs in our our lives, Lord, that we know that you're the only one that can meet those needs. And Father, we've come into your house. We've come into this place. we've gathered in your name, Lord, to worship you, to honor you, and to receive that which we have need of. We pray that you would bless your people, clothe them with your spirit today. Lord, open our eyes to a realization that we could never leave here and never be the same people that we were when we came. Lord, fill our hearts with thankfulness for you. You've never done wrong. You've never let us down. You've been so faithful. Just pray that you come and minister now, Lord, as we set our attention upon thee. Bless the remainder of the service. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to read just one verse in Thessal Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse number 18. In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated. This is the day that the Lord hath made. I will rejoice and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; If a believer was to fulfill this scripture, in everything give thanks. We would have to say that this person would have have to lived a life of gratitude. &gt;&gt; We want to entitle this message a life of gratitude. &gt;&gt; We are living in the most ungrateful time &gt;&gt; known the history of man. &gt;&gt; Between entitlement and the spirit of this church age which is in in need of nothing. Um uh it's hard to really find genuine uh thankfulness in people. &gt;&gt; Um and I would like each one of us and we know how it is. You go through trials, you go through tests and you just you kind of get down in the dumps, right? And you and you forget to be thankful, forget to be grateful. And uh I would just like if we could this morning, everyone that's listening to kind of set aside the most difficult persons or people in your life to set aside every circumstance you have, every problem that you encounter and whatever your age is, young or small, because none of it matters when it comes to your personal choice to be grateful. &gt;&gt; It's it's all about you and how you view life. And God has told us in his word, "It is my will." He said that you give thanks in all things. &gt;&gt; It is the will of God concerning you. No matter what age, what you got going on in life, it is God's will for us. Being grateful has nothing to do with how much you get or the things that you possess, how little you have to work for what you do have or how easy life is or how enjoyable things are around you. Being grateful is an attitude. It's a mindset that has nothing to do with anything except your attitude. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where a lot of times we look at, well, if you knew what I was going through, you'd understand. Or you don't know how bad I have it or you don't know this or you don't know that. You don't understand. It's always like people give excuses and reasons &gt;&gt; uh not to be happy and and then not to be grateful for what they have. But it is a mindset that that we must continue to maintain. Having gratitude is a choice. Being thankful is a choice. But greater but a greater choice is to express gratitude. See at times we all can be thankful. We we all can be happy at times. We can all say, "Yeah, thank you for this wonderful dinner." But how about when you got to get up and actually make something if you want to eat? Can you be that grateful? You you understand what I'm saying? So this is a very challenging scripture. In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Living a life of gratitude. Living a life of gratitude is not saying I am grateful. It's not saying I'm thankful. It's living out your thankfulness. &gt;&gt; It's living it out. Living it out. It's ex it's it's a it's an expression in your life. You ever do somebody something for somebody and it took you hours and hours, sometimes weeks to do &gt;&gt; and the only thing they say is thank you &gt;&gt; and that's all you ever ever ever get out of it. It doesn't say in everything just you know say the say uh say thank you and that's it. But give thanks is an expression. &gt;&gt; Don't say thank you. Give thanks. &gt;&gt; Give yourself. &gt;&gt; It is the will of God for you to do that. I like that. It isn't just John Martin's opinion. &gt;&gt; It's God's will. &gt;&gt; Living a life of gratitude is one of the most difficult challenges in life. There's so many odds stacked up against us as a person. If a person was to do this, he would have to not lean to his own understanding &gt;&gt; because his own understanding doesn't want to be always thankful for what they're going through. They would have to be able to fully trust God at times. And during adversity, they would have to look for reasons to be grateful because when you're going through a test or a trial, the only thing you want to do is talk about that situation, &gt;&gt; like, why me, Lord? How why did this befall me? And those questions automatically take you away from being grateful. &gt;&gt; A person would have to be a a a person that would be full of joy all the time. You have to be full of joy to look at the the right to find something. I remember in was going to brother Johnson's church. I think it was brother Johnson maybe was telling the story about this older lady. Um she always was saying good things. She couldn't never say anything bad. She was always saying good things. And there was this one man that was going to try to catch her and say, "Well, what do you think about the devil?" And [laughter] and and she said, "He's a good adversary. [laughter] And you just you'd have to be a person full of joy. Count it all joy when you fall into diverse trials. &gt;&gt; It have to be a person of spiritual understanding. And I I say that because you to think it not strange the fiery trials to con to try you. You'd have to be spiritual &gt;&gt; because as soon as you get in that carnality um all of a sudden um you're thinking this is a strange thing that's happened to me. Why is this happening to me? &gt;&gt; They would need to rejoice in as much as they are partakers of Christ's suffering. So this person would have to be a very special person built inside to to be living a life of gratitude. Most everyone can show gratitude at specific times or for specific reasons. But the will of God for us is to give thanks in everything to express a sincere gratitude in everything that we do and everything that we're experiencing and and everything that happens to us because we have to always remember God is with us. &gt;&gt; There's no need to murmur. There's no need to complain. There's no need to be negative. It's hard when those things are in your life or they bombard your life or they try to penetrate into your life. It's hard to fulfill the scripture in everything uh give thanks for this is the will of God uh concerning you. And I want I want my life to represent a life of gratitude. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't have anything to do what you have. It has everything to do with who you are. What can help us to become full of gratitude? Just full of it. Nobody wants to live a life of partial gratitude. Not completely ungrateful, but not completely grateful. Just kind of a lukewarm grateful. [laughter] I mean it when you're going through it, you usually think, well, being, you know, half grateful is better than not being grateful at all. But in reality, that's not what the scriptur is calling us to do. God God's bride, they ought to be the most happiest, the most grateful. &gt;&gt; They ought to be a a people that set aside for him. &gt;&gt; So what can help us to live a life full of gratitude? So just one little thought I want us to we could have so many things but one thing I want to just focus on today is we need to focus on God &gt;&gt; because there is just absolutely nothing wrong with God. &gt;&gt; No matter you can't find fault with God. They couldn't find fault with Jesus. Um he's a good God. There's no one good but God. Everybody else you can find fault with. But even in the midst of living in this um terrible world that we're living in, uh God still wants us to give thanks for everything that we go through. So I want us to focus on God more. God is good. Everything that God does is good. Everything he after he created everything he looked back to himself his own testimony of his own works says and it was good. &gt;&gt; Jesus said there's none good but one. That's God. It's even the goodness of God that leads man to repentance. God's goodness. Job said, "Behold, God is great." Psalms 145:1 says, "I will extol thee, my God, oh king, and I will bless thy name forever and ever. Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name forever and ever. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, &gt;&gt; and his greatness is unsearchable. &gt;&gt; See, if we could just focus on him, then our problems won't seem so great in our sight. because it's problems that usually get us down &gt;&gt; and then we we kind of justify a reason not to be happy, &gt;&gt; justify a reason not to be thankful &gt;&gt; and and then we we almost begin to put the blame on on on situations where in reality God wants us to be mature Christians. &gt;&gt; Wants us to be strong Christians. He wants us to to be able to exercise that ability, that attitude to be strong in the Lord. Lamentations uh uh chapter 3 verse 22. I could quote it. I know you know it but I I just wanted us to read it. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed &gt;&gt; because his compassions fail not. &gt;&gt; They are new every morning. Great is thy faithfulness. Well, just focusing on that &gt;&gt; this morning when I was praying and just crying out to God for mercy like he has mercy there for us. And if we could just focus on the goodness of God. He loves us. He's not going to leave us in a place of just despondency. I like I love this this verse here. 1st Samuel chapter 12 um chap verse 24 if you want to write it down. I see you you guys are writing some things down here and that'd be a good good one to write down is this one right here. 1st Samuel 12 verse 24. Only fear the Lord and serve him in truth with all your heart. For consider how great things he have done for you. &gt;&gt; For you, for you. You know, we need to keep a record of the good things that God does for us. &gt;&gt; We seem to forget what he did last week, [laughter] last month, last year. And God doesn't want us to forget those things because we can build. I mean, if you you think about it, when David was faced with having to go against uh Goliath, um what did he do? He brought up what God did for him in the past. &gt;&gt; Look, God helped me with a bear. God God helped me with a lion. And he he brought that up to help face his challenges that stood in front of him. And a lot of times we just we you know we wake up and and we got bad things going on in our life and in certain situations and we don't know how to deal with it. Don't know what to do and we get upset, we get bothered, we get angry, we we we we just want to throw in the towel. And in reality, God says, "No, look what I've done for you. Consider what I've done for you." &gt;&gt; It is no secret what God can do. what he's done for others, he can do for you. &gt;&gt; So, keep keep the Lord before you. &gt;&gt; Count your blessings. Name them one by one. Bring up something he's done in the past. If If God never did another thing for you, could you still live a life of gratitude? &gt;&gt; WHAT A CHALLENGE. WHAT A CHALLENGE. God just wants us to be grateful for him. &gt;&gt; He saved us. &gt;&gt; Is there anything else that he needs to do? It should be easy for us to be grateful. &gt;&gt; Should be very easy. Think about God has redeemed us. Even when we were dead in sins and uh trespasses, he has quickened us together with Christ. The Bible says, "For by grace are you saved and has raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Now, God did that. He loved us when we were in our sins. He brought us out of that. I think there's we don't need any other re reason. We don't need any other blessing. We don't need any other reason to live a life of gratitude. &gt;&gt; God has changed his nature. Our na God has changed our nature. God has given us eyes to see. He said, "Blessed are your eyes for they see. Your ears for they hear." This is what God did for us. Brother Ron said he's brought us out of darkness into his marvelous light. God has given us revelation of who he is. He has reserved that for himself. And think about the revelation that you have today that other people don't have even when you try to tell them. &gt;&gt; We are written epistles read of all our lives express who we are. &gt;&gt; It isn't how high you can jump. &gt;&gt; It isn't how loud you can shout. It's what life you can live. &gt;&gt; That's where it counts. God has protected us. He has shielded us from so many things. God has kept us back from going into back into the world. Right? So many people have have slid back into the world. But look where we're at today. &gt;&gt; God has filled us with his spirit, his life, his love, his joy, his peace, his goodness. All that God is is poured into you. God has delivered us from a spirit of fear and and and manipulation and abuse from the devil tormenting us in our minds. And he has given us a spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind. God has brought healing many times to our bodies, to our spirits, to our soul. So just consider how great things God has done for you. &gt;&gt; God is good. He's great. He's faithful. &gt;&gt; He will never put more upon us than what we can bear. I &gt;&gt; I'm sure, brother Dennis, we all have at one time or another. we've given something to somebody do whether it's our child or somebody that works for us and they didn't quite do well in their what they were doing and we step back and we said did I give them too much did I put too much on them you know what I'm saying but here's the thing with God no matter what we go through how we feel God will never put anything on us that we can't bear &gt;&gt; he knows how much we can bear &gt;&gt; that's why we can rejoice in our trials that they're not too great too hard &gt;&gt; so when we quiet our minds and consider all that God has done for us. Our gratitude magnifies &gt;&gt; um alleyu. He proclaims God's majesty here in Job chapter 37 verse14 when he said hearken unto this oh Job stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. You ever just look at the stars and say, "Oh my." &gt;&gt; Look at the the mountains, the mountain peaks, look at the birds. Just look at what God created and think he is a great God and &gt;&gt; he created you. Sure, you were born with a demonic um selfish, uncaring, stingy, I'm going to be first self-centered spirit in your life. [laughter] But God is changing us. &gt;&gt; That is glorious. &gt;&gt; He makes all things beautiful in his time. He is making us into his same image. Psalms 8:3 says, "When I consider thy heavens and the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained? What is man that thou art mindful of him?" God. God will never leave us in a situation that he won't take care of us. &gt;&gt; His grace is sufficient to meet every need. But you know, if you just just think about it, we don't this is not my notes here, but it just kind of came to me in 1 Corinthians chapter 10, if you want to write it down. [clears throat] God was not well pleased with the children of Israel because they murmured and they complained. That that was what he said. In other words, they didn't remain grateful for what God did for them. &gt;&gt; If they if they could have, you know, they when they came over and they passed over the Red Sea, what did they do? They danced, right? They shouted, they danced, and they said, you know, God gave us the victory. But you know what happened is they didn't continue dancing. [laughter] They and they could have they they could have walked up when there was a problem and because there was like what 10 problems or something like that that they went through and all those problems they murmured and complain. They wanted to get a new leader. Let's go back into the world. Let's go back to Egypt. And all God wanted to do was trust him. &gt;&gt; Just trust. How can you watch the greatest the only the the greatest world power die in front of your eyes and doubt what God's going to give you? &gt;&gt; Because even though the the the promised land was filled with giants, those giants were nothing like Egypt. &gt;&gt; Egypt was so much of a greater problem. &gt;&gt; And for whatever reason, they didn't build on that faith. And they went through the trials in the wilderness. And what happened? Every time they went through a trial, they got beat down. Beat down. Beat down. Beat down to the place they were scared. &gt;&gt; Now, that wasn't God's fault. God gave them an opportunity to be positive with every trial to to have a heart of gratitude that God will provide a way. He will provide all uh bitter water to be sweet. &gt;&gt; He He will provide food for us. He will provide healing for us. &gt;&gt; God is faithful. He is good. &gt;&gt; Now, we can look back on that. The Bible says as examples for us that that we need to just be more grateful &gt;&gt; in everything. Give thanks. I'm telling you, if they would have just gave thanks in every one of those trials that they went through, I believe when they would have came up to the next trial, they would have such strength, such faith, such ability to say, you know, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. &gt;&gt; See, see, our attitude has everything to do with where we're going in life. &gt;&gt; Quoted this before. He had made everything beautiful in his time. We have to trust him for that. &gt;&gt; Psalms 91:1, "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge. He is my fortress. He is my God. In him I will I trust." Just consider the place that you dwell. You're dwelling with God. You talk about safety. It's like it doesn't matter what goes wrong in your life, you're dwelling with God. All is well. My son died. All is well. What a testimony. I know that there's room for growth in my life to be more thankful. Deuteronomy 4:7. Think thinking about the nation of of of Israel now. For what nation is there so great who have God so close to them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for. &gt;&gt; Think about that. There was no nation at all underneath the sun except Israel that they could call upon God and that he would be there with him whenever they called upon him. &gt;&gt; Now you are spiritual Israel. What people are there like you that when you call on God that he's there? Think about that. In all thy ways acknowledge him and he'll direct thy paths. The Lord is nine to all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. That's Psalms 145 if you want to write it down. God is with you if you just call upon him. He is faithful. Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5. Knowing that, knowing that, having that, let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have, for he have said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. What a comfort soul that we may boldly say, "The Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me." &gt;&gt; Boy, that just that that doesn't give you boldness right there. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm thankful that God is my helper. You know, if you I remember as a kid when I was a kid going to school and we would like we'd play football and we'd play sports and we'd all we'd all like choose who was going to be on our team. We did a little bit of that out here behind the church. We're like, you know, pick on who's who's going to be on whose team and you'd always want the, you know, the best player, the fastest player. You know, you got to make sure you get them. &gt;&gt; But God is our helper. &gt;&gt; He's the best one to have on your team. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody can forsake you, but if you got God, &gt;&gt; if I got Jesus, I got a law, &gt;&gt; right? Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He's the same. We don't have to think that things are going to be different now because of this, that, or the other. Count on God. Isaiah chapter 61:10. A lot of lot of scriptures here. They're they're they're to hopefully cause us to put our focus on God and to that if there if we people are going to let us down, &gt;&gt; but God won't let us down. &gt;&gt; That's why if we if we make God our focus, it's easier to remain grateful. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 61:10, I will greatly rejoice in the Lord. My soul shall be joyful in my God, for he have clothed me with the garments of salvation. He have covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom deckth himself with ornaments, and as a bride adornneth herself with her jewels. Wow. Isn't that beautiful? Beautiful. All right. Here's a prayer in 1 Chronicles chapter 29. This is David praying. And I like I like reading prayers because it helps me to know how to pray. Amen. 1st Chronicles 29:10. Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation. And David said, "Blessed be thou Lord God of Israel our father forever and ever. Thine, oh Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty. For all that is in heaven and in earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as the head above all. Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over all, and in thy hand is power and might, and in thy hand is to make great, and to give strength unto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee and praise thy glorious name. What a wonderful prayer. &gt;&gt; Ending our prayer with thanksgiving. If you read the Bible enough, you would notice that Paul would often say, "I give thanks upon every remembrance of you." Or, "I I thank you when I heard of your faith." Or he would always express, "I giving thanks." &gt;&gt; We ought to be thankful and give thanks for one another. &gt;&gt; I mean, you may not be getting everything you want out of everybody here, &gt;&gt; but think about this. Everybody here has prayed for for you. And when I think of that for me that everybody has prayed for me, well, I can tell you I don't deserve that. &gt;&gt; And in that state of mind, it helps me to be thankful for everybody. Hebrews 12 verse 1, wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that so easily beset us. And let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross. He despised the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider this man, for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you think you got it worse, be weary and faint in your minds. Consider God bore our sorrows. He bore the stripes on his back for us. He was beaten for us, bruised for us. &gt;&gt; Our sorrows were taken away. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Set your affections on things above and not on things of the earth." When you think about heaven, you don't murmur and complain as much. &gt;&gt; Look at Psalms 1 verse one. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor si siteth in the seat of the scornful, but his delight, his delight is in the Lord, and in the word does he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season. His leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he do it shall prosper. You know this to me sounds like a life of gratitude. A man, a a woman, a believer whose life is full of gratitude. &gt;&gt; So when we consider how great God is, that means we can do all things through Christ who strengthenth us. &gt;&gt; That ought to cause us to worship and give thanks. When we consider how great God has been to us that we can be confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in us, he's going to perform it unto the day of Jesus, he's going to finish it. That ought to make us want to worship him and and and give honor to him and give thanks to him. Just knowing he's going to finish the work. &gt;&gt; See, what happens is we get away from the reality of God and we start dealing in this life &gt;&gt; down here and oh, this got this problem. I got this problem and I need help over here and nobody cares about this and I got this and and in reality what it is that is just there to prove where you're at with God. &gt;&gt; That's all that's there for. &gt;&gt; You think that these are just problems that you know this you call this real life down here and and this is just going to church twice a week. &gt;&gt; No, but the reality is you got to bring God into your life. &gt;&gt; You got to bring God into your real life. prosper. Let him prosper you in everything that you do. When we consider that God works all things for the counsel of his will, then we know that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord and called according to his purpose. He's working all things through the council of his own will. Not Satan's, not Putin's, not anybody. He's working everything the council of his own will. &gt;&gt; And when we love that same God that he makes everything work out for our good, &gt;&gt; that ought to be enough to make us thankful. &gt;&gt; There are so MANY REASONS TO BE THANKFUL. IF A PERSON IS NOT FULL OF GRATITUDE, SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THEIR ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; It's all there is to it. When we consider how great God really is, the easiest thing to do ought to be to give thanks for all things. Whether we're whether it's for the good or the bad that happens to us. Whether it's the blessings we get or trials, whether it's God's prosperity in our life or or his hardships for us, whether it's victories or battles, whether it's sunshine or storms, we ought to be able to say, "I love you, Jesus. Praise your name. I give thanks to this." I I shared this story one time and brother I think it was brother Johnson he was uh ministering and u giving thanks and and along those lines and I don't know if it was a thanksgiving message or what it was but might have been because um afterwards they uh went up north and they were hunting and they were around the campfire and as they were around the campfire um one of the um he was roasting a marshmallow and uh you know how sometimes they can get uh real hot and they just it kind of blows up and it it blew up and it went in his eye and the devil automatically came to brother Johnson and said, "Okay, what are you going to be what are you going to be thankful for that for?" And he just says, "I'm I'm thankful that it didn't blind me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He gave thanks for that situation, &gt;&gt; challenged by the devil. and and and to me there is nothing greater than this word right here being manifested in flesh. &gt;&gt; It's not a story. It's not how well you can preach. It's not how well you can sing it. It's how well you can live it. &gt;&gt; How well you can live that word. &gt;&gt; That's what attracts God's attention. Brother and brother Ram said the word is what attracts the bride. Remember he he told that story about um uh when the message kind of went out, the gifts were being expressed, it attracted a lot of people, but the majority of them were small fishes. And he says you can't teach um Pentecostal baby spiritual things because he tried to explain how that gift worked and God didn't want him to do that. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it people want to mimic. People want attention drawn to them. So they try to do something and so then there was uh larger fish, right? And then um and then at the end there was and there were there was not as many. But then at the end there was the very large fish and there was just not very many of those at all. [snorts] And and and that's what when it comes to the real bride, there isn't very many at all. &gt;&gt; There there just isn't. There's there there's a lot of people that associate with the bride, but there's not a lot of bride members. There are few. And uh we ought to be the most thankful. &gt;&gt; We ought to be the most thankful because we're part of the group of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we ought to count it all joy. When the trials come into our lives, we ought to give thanks. God knows what we have need of. God knows the character that he's trying to build within us. He knows what's lacking and what is needed. So, we go through a trial. We just forget about trying to lean your own understanding. Figure it all out. Get all down in the dumps. Just give God thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't lead your own. Thank you, Lord. You know what you're doing. Remember last service we talked about that when we're weak, we're really strong. And Paul speaking in 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly. Now look at the attitude that Paul has after he just seeks the Lord three times. Take this away from me. Take this away from me. It hurts. says, "Most gladly, therefore, I rather glory in my infirmities, &gt;&gt; and that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I actually take pleasure I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in in having needs in my life, in necessities, when people persecute me, and when the distress comes upon me for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. What an attitude to be happy when you're going through a trial. &gt;&gt; To me, that just seems to to be priceless. I mean, who can do that? Who can do that? It it would have to be Christ in a person. And that so I just say that's priceless. In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus. concerning you. You know, when a man goes into the army, I don't know if you're thinking about [clears throat] going into the army, are any of you? Not. Not. No way. Okay. Well, when a man goes into the army, what does it do? Usually, when he thinks about going to the army, what is the first thing we think? Boot camp. That's right. Boot camp. It it it it it toughens you up. You know, when a person goes in the army, if any anybody's ever watched somebody go into the army and come out and you you see a difference in them, you you definitely see it. It toughens you up. They learn to become a real man. What do they do? They they have to be taught, you don't lean to your own understanding. You do what I tell you to do. Yes, &gt;&gt; they learn to take authority or take orders from authority &gt;&gt; where before, you know, maybe living at home, they didn't have to listen to mom or dad. &gt;&gt; But you in the army, that don't work. &gt;&gt; That don't work. You learn because it's no more about I love you. &gt;&gt; If you get down and do 25 push-ups and you say that again, you're going to be doing 125. Right. It's it's it's no take advantage. It's this is the army. Well, as soldiers of God's great army, we have to learn to become real strong soldiers, &gt;&gt; real strong Christians. We need to learn to not be wise in our own eyes, but fear the Lord and depart from evil. That kind of thinking. We need to learn to trust the Lord with all of our heart, not lean to our own understanding. In all of our ways, acknowledge God and he's going to direct our path. Now, that's what we need to learn to do to be a strong soldier. Paul didn't pull any punches when he's talking to Timothy. Timothy was afraid to be a partaker of the sufferings of Christ. In fact, one place he said, "All that live godly in Christ Jesus are going to suffer persecution." But if you turn with me to 2 Timothy chapter 1, I want to try to read these real quick because I have some other scriptures I would like to get through. But I think a lot of times be what makes a person not um h have a life or or live a life of gratitude is because they're not strong. They're weak. They're weak and they they have to have everything all their feelings and everything has all the ducks got to be in the row and everything just has to be perfect and then they're going to be okay. Thank you. And that's that to me that makes for a weak a weak Christian. Second Timothy chapter 2 verse one. Thou therefore my son Timothy be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him to have called him and chosen him to be a soldier. In other words, uh in all things give thanks for this is the will of God. This is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. It is the will of God that you give thanks in everything. Don't allow yourself to become entangled with things that make you sour, bitter, angry. Get away from that. Don't entangle yourself with that thinking. Think on these things. Think on the things that leave you at peace. And if a man strive for masteries, look at this. He is not crowned except he strive lawfully, right? You can't go into the Olympics and take a bunch of steroids. You get kicked out. You don't win the crown. You got to do it lawfully. The husbandmen that labor must be first partakers of the fruit. Consider what I say. And the Lord give thee understanding in all things. It is the will of God that we that in everything we give thanks. I'll tell you, if we could just leave here with the determination to be more thankful, I believe that we would accomplish what God wants in our life. &gt;&gt; It's hard for God to bless us when we're not thankful. &gt;&gt; I mean, you that got children, if they're always murmuring and complaining, you don't want to do things for him. That's just natural. And and God's God's no different. [snorts] All right? Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein I suffer trouble. I'm suffering trouble as an evildoer, even unto bonds, but the word of God is not bound. Therefore, I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they may also obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. Is a faithful saying. For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us. If we believe not, yet he abide the faithful. He cannot deny himself. I'll just say it like this. In all things, give thanks. Let your life express gratitude. Don't make excuses while you're down in the dumps. God don't accept it. Don't try to get other people to accept it. Learn to crucify your selfish flesh and remain grateful for all things. Psalms 30:1 says, "Thou has turned for me my mourning into dancing. Thou has put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent. Oh Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever. I just say every morning when you wake up, this is the day the Lord have made. I will rejoice and be glad in it. He has turned your mourning into dancing. All the negativity in your life. All the sorrow, he's turned it into happiness, to joy. Don't wait to everything's done to start walking by faith. Sometimes you got to walk through the furnace, but if you do, God will meet you there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 92:1, it's a psalm for the Sabbath day. Say the Sabbath day. Well, we're, you know, today we're looking at it as the resurrection day. The Bible says, "It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto his name, oh most high, to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, upon an instrument of 10 strings, and upon a sultry, and upon the harp with a solemn sound. For thou, Lord, has made me glad through thy work. I will triumph in the work of thy hands." Oh, just to get somebody to believe the word here today, to get somebody to hang on to this word and and and and and become what the instrument that God wants us to be. Psalms 106 verse1, praise ye the Lord. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever. You know, I read that like eight times in the book of Psalms. That very same thing. I mean, for God's mercy endure it forever. That ought to be enough to make us thankful. Verse two, who can utterly who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can show forth all his praise? I wish there was I wish we'd have uh some competition in here that we would just try to uh show forth all his praises, &gt;&gt; right? Not just some of them, but all of them. &gt;&gt; That that give him what he's worthy of. I mean Ephesians 1:15, "Wherefore I also uh I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and the love unto all saints, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers." I wonder if I was to ask today, how many times did you wake up this week in the morning or sometime in the course of the day, you sat time aside to give thanks to God, make mention of all of your brothers and sisters, right? You know, when you pray for others, God just seems to put his favor towards you. In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you personally. So there may not be anybody in this church that'll take this message, but make sure you take it. &gt;&gt; You take it. Let your testimony be a life of gratitude. Start pressing that when people look at you, they only see gratitude. Let it be absent from murmuring, complaining, any kind of negativity. I tell you, if you keep your thoughts positive, your words will be positive. Let it be filled. Let your life be filled with an expression of gratitude for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Let's stand together. God bless you. You know, just before service, Brother Ron, um, you all sang that song at the Hallelujah side. And Brother Ron, 60 seconds before you started singing that, I wrote it down. I want to sing that after service. So, I thought that was so good. Amen. Can we sing How Great Thou Ar Oh Lord my God, when I in awome wonder consider all the worlds thy hands [singing] have made. I see [singing] the stars here. Hear the rolling thunder. Thy power throughout the universe display. [music] Then sings [singing] my soul, my s Savior God to thee.

Okay. Great is our God. How great is his word. He's the greatest one that ever was heard. He rode back the water of the mighty Red Sea and he said, "I will lead you. Put your trust
