Grover uh Saturday this Saturday uh the 11th at 5 PM amen um let's just bring a guest to make it a point to call some people to Reach Out time's running out and uh as our brother said in the men's meeting you know we didn't want to be fallen short short coming the Lord comes we might it might be that message that they need to hear so let's just bring and also Sunday uh the 12th also uh we have a special communion Services coming up on the 19th uh that's a Sunday so let's just be in prayer for that um just to partake of the Lord's supper and uh uh no I think it's a time to consecrate our hearts too you know because every time you consecrate your heart you've drawn closer to Christ so let's just keep that in our prayers oh oh so if you could just remember our our daughter Katie um in in your prayers she got kidney stones and um I've been anybody's had kidney stones they know what it's fun so she still hasn't passed them yet so they're just evaluating her at this point so we just pray that God would just dissolve them and she'd be on her way to a recovery and also for my grandson Evan he had two seizures pretty severe seizures in the last couple days and uh just pray for wisdom for the doctors and uh I'm just from the Lord for that um they really don't know why yet but he kind of suffers from anxiety and uh he said that he's had these little anxiety attacks it was it might be actually a small little many many seizure that he was having that led up to the bigger ones that he's had now so um you know this world has got so many things that wants to put its weight on you got to give it to Christ because if you don't carrying it around and I know but you but my shoulders ain't big enough so we know that we have but a short time and um it's just the hearts the hearts meant will be failing for fear we're here see it all around us so we just pray for peace for that um please remember my grandfather CJ oh this is a Gabrielle CJ he has he had a fell a few weeks ago getting out of the two of his uh still suffering I'm sorry sister oh out of the tub e sorry I can't read this still suffering from the effects of uh bad concussion pray for a complete healing and a restoration of his his mind too I know that as we get older that's the own money my way I felt twice since I've been back home and uh you know we need to uh take care of our bodies better as we get older you know be we're the weight wants to bring us down and you know Jesus wants to lift us up so but we need to be good stewards of our body so let's just pray for uh Gabrielle's uh uh grandfather amen remember him and pray CJ um amen so uh let's just stand as we take these needs before the Lord just remember all the missionaries just remember our brother Mark in prayer uh as he prepares his heart and the word for us now let's just pray one for another uh that we would we would just receive uh as a sign says prevailing revelation that's how we grow closer to Christ without Revelation I I just think it's just uh we need Revelation especially in the time that we're living to put our focus more on Christ so let's just go in one Accord dear heavenly father Lord as we come before you tonight Lord God we're so grateful for the things that you've done in our lives so we're grateful for lord your presence here already tonight Lord God and Lord when we may call upon your precious name

worship you oh my soul Rejoice take your my king and what you hear [Music] amen who's come here for the Lord to hear from the Lord amen would like to open our Bibles up and we'll turn to First Samuel 13 14 and then to acts 13 22. so it says in verse 14 of Samuel chapter 13. but now thy kingdom shall not continue so he's talking about Saul which was the first king of Israel the Lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee now we'll go to Acts chapter 13. verse 22. and it says in verse 22. and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King in whom also he gave a testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will like just a just welcome the author and this is bower hits dear Lord Jesus you're the only one Lord who could bring this word to life you're the only one who can Quicken it to our hearts Lord we pray that you would just come down and send your Holy Spirit Lord and to speak to us Lord like only you can Lord touch us like only you can Lord may your word Lord just give us prevailing Revelation that will change Us From the Inside Out Lord I pray you'll bless each believer here Lord let them this here directly from you let them be able to testify they heard a personal revelation from you and Lord I pray you take control Lord this service Lord move your unworthy servant Plum out the way that you could have the preeminence Lord and Lord once again we give you the the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen you may be seated um so this little uh the title of this sermon is a man after God's Own Heart so something that we all can strive for uh every day and you don't have to be David to be a man that for God's Own Heart you just have to have a Hungry Heart to receive from the Lord and so we want to just uh we had a couple we got a quite a few uh scriptures in the Book of Psalms so let's go to Psalms chapter one and I just believe we're living in a day and age where we can't fall in love with God too much because we need to fall so deeply and madly in love with God that these things that are happening in the world won't affect us they won't move us but we'll be staying firm because all these things that are happening is just showing us how we're going home soon so this worked that much more harder while there's light and let's every time the church is open like our precious practice said let's enter in with Thanksgiving in our hearts let's come with an expectation to receive from the Living God who wants to change you and use you out there in that dark world to shed light amen let's go to Psalms one and uh very familiar scripture but we're going to take our time tonight don't worry you won't be here two hours but it's gonna take our time tonight and just let the Lord just speak to us so it says in verse one blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly amen nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but notice what verse 2 says but his Delight amen is in the law of the Lord and his law that he meditate day and night so we got to be feeding upon the word studying in the word meditating upon the word so for doing that the word condensed dwelling you richly see God wants to write it upon your hearts upon your minds and it's so important for us to be feeding on that word because if you're feeding on the word then God has opportunity to Quicken it in your heart go to verse 3 and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water so God is liking us to trees and when you're a train order a tree to be fully established the roots have to grow deeper and deeper and deeper and God wants our roots to grow so deep that when a strong wind comes it won't Shake us it won't tip us over but it'll just loosen Our Roots enough so they can grow deeper and if you notice the rest of this it says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water now notice the rivers are plural but the water is one so the rivers lead to One Life Source One water source and that is Jesus Christ amen fourth it says that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper verse 4 the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor the sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish so if you notice in verse 3 says his fruit it says uh so bringeth forth his fruit in his season so Jesus said we are we're connected to the vine or the branches and so God expects our tree to bear fruit and if a tree is truly planted by the rivers of water and it's root surges deeply grounded then that tree is going to eventually have to bear fruit so God expects to see fruit in our life and we're connected to that one water source then there has to be fruit in our life but if there's not fruit in our life then we need to do a checkup inventory search me o God and see if there's something hindering us from producing that fruit because that fruit is not for you it's for others long-suffering joy peace that's right all the fruits of the holy spirit for others so they can see Christ in your life amen so let's go to let's go to Psalms 2 which is right uh right over it so God wants us to be established in him so being established in God is so important because if you're not fully established then God can't use you in the magnitude that he wants to use you in so when the fiery Trials come when the mighty winds come we don't want to get uprooted in fact when they come it should only loosen Our Roots so they can go deeper that's what trials should do trials shouldn't come uh they shouldn't be a surprise to us because the scripture tells us our fiery trial is more precious than gold and the reason why we have trials is so more of Christ can dwell in US richly amen so go to Psalms 2 and read verses 11 through 12. serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling kiss the sun lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him so the type of fear isn't like a the type of fear as the devil says or the cowering but the type of fear I'm talking about the scripture is talking about is a reverence towards God that you don't want to do something to offend him or hurt him that you have so much love in your heart that you want to just everything you do your thoughts your actions you want to make sure that they're pleasing unto him that's the type of fear that the scripture is talking about and we go to Psalms 1 11 10. so I just see David just looking at his life in the Book of Psalms and all throughout the Old Testament he was always a man that wanted to please God amen and he was just so open and so honest you know when how he's feeling and he was that's what God is looking for for us to be open and honest not try to put a put on but David is always honest did he mess up yes he messed up but he was honest about that mess up and he repented and it didn't go back to that same thing he did that's what God is looking for let's go to Psalms 1 11 10. so it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so if you desire wisdom from God we need to be fearing God respecting God asking for God for this wisdom a good understanding have all they that do no his what Commandments if you love me keep my commandments so we heard in the Bible study today so if we want we want all these things from God but yet we're not doing the things he's asking us to do so if you want something from God you got to be obedient to God yes God will bless the just in the unjust but I don't want just some physical blessing I want a blessing that will just change my nature that will touch my soul so read that one more time the fear of the Lord is the beginning no it's the beginning of wisdom so we got to keep fearing them keep fearing them keep respecting them a good understanding of all they that do his Commandments his praise endureth forever and we'll go to Psalms 112 which is right next door verse 1 and then six through eight praise ye the Lord blessed is the man that feareth the Lord if you ever read the book of Psalms in Proverbs you'll notice that that word fear is used a lot which meaning it's an it's important to God it's something that is a not something you can take or leave but is a must just like coming into God's house he demands respect and reverence how we conduct ourselves in the house how we when you come with expectation in the house of God all that is going into the fear of the Lord so he says blessed is the man so you're going to be blessed if you fear the lord that feareth the Lord that delighteth knows right here greatly in his Commandments notice how important his Commandments are to him to fear Him and to follow his Commandments are so important to him go to verse 6. surely he shall not be moved forever the righteous shall be an everlasting remembrance verse 7. he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord so our hearts like that's why I can see David was a man after God's Own Heart because his heart was fixed in trusting in the Lord no matter what situation he was going in no matter if the Philistines were coming or whoever was trying to Compass him his heart was constantly fixed upon the Lord and we need to have the same type of attitude same type of trust as David has in the Lord David was no different than you and I he was a human being per se in that sense he didn't have some superpowers he couldn't fly but he had liked passions he made mistakes he had issues just like us so we can be a man after God's Own heart as well in fact in this layout is he an age we need to be after God's Own Heart because the cares of this life is trying to take our eyes off of God the government the policies all these things are trying to take us off of God's eyes and we need to be constantly after God's Own Heart so he says his heart is fixed I looked that word up the word fixed means settled established firm fast and stable so when you when somebody truly fixes something you expect it to be firm established and to stay there so our heart needs to be constantly fixed on God 24 hours a day no breaks so let's go to verse um eight notice what it says right here another verse 8 says his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see his desires upon his enemies so our heart needs to be established we can't just be coming to churches to come to church but we got to be so established that every time we walk on the door is God I need to hear a word from you I need my heart to be changed I need my nature to be changed because I know this the devil wants to sift me like wheat but you prayed for me Lord and I need you I need thee every hour so I heard we said before must be fixed on him no matter what's going on no matter the neighbors yelling at you if if your wife's not talking to you your husband's not talking to you you got to be fixed on him you can't let anything affect your love relationship with Christ because as soon as you let that affect your love relationship with Christ then that's when the enemy can get in and like brother John preached about influence of another Spirit that's going to influenced another Spirit can come on we let your guard down that's when Satan comes in so I got a quote is that okay if I read it yeah yeah so it's in his presence 1962 uh 0909 Psalm 16 8 we're going to turn there as well if we want to just turn there while we're reading this psalm 16 8 David said I have sent the Lord before me notice that when you said the Lord before you that means he's the center of your whole life because you're setting them before you see a lot of times we put ourselves before the Lord I gotta do me I gotta do this and this and this and this then I'm going to put the Lord first but David said I have said the Lord before me that's a good thing to do Psalms 16 8 I have sent the Lord before me so he could not be confused about it amen he wanted to be conscience of his presence so David said I have set the lord always before my face now I David have said the Lord before my face always to be conscious conscience of what of God's presence wouldn't that be a good lesson for us for all of us tonight said the Lord before our face so we'll be conscience of his presence put him first why put him first before you why then you won't sin when you're realizing that constantly you're in the presence of God let me do one more time then you won't sin when you are realizing that constantly you're in the presence of God when you realize God is around you you watch what you say amen when he thinks that when he thinks God is gone he'll cuss he'll lust after women he'll he'll do he'll still cheat lie he'll do anything when he thinks that God don't see him it's like when David uh made that that mistake he didn't think God was watching but he was so we always got to be in a constant uh spiritual awareness that God is watching our life everything that we do God is watching us and we can't hide anything from him so that's why it's so important to be conscious spiritually conscious if I could say but bring him into the presence of God and he'll stop right now and David said I put the Lord but always before me that's a good thing no wonder why God said he was a man after his own heart man would do everything when he thinks that God isn't near remember one more time man would do everything when he think that God is not near but when he realizes that God's near did you ever notice a sinner let a Godly person walk up he'll quit his cussing if he's got any respect at all he won't tell dirty jokes that he would have told see he'll leave off that because he knows that he's in the presence of God because God dwells in the Tabernacle of his people see so God dwells in each one of us you have to believe that that's why it's so important for us to conduct ourselves in the right manner because like Paul said you're living Epistles somebody might never read a Bible he might be the only Bible they ever read and that's why it's so important for us to be constantly in Oneness with God because we don't want somebody to see us we want somebody to see Christ in US after David said this I think I read that already but let's go to Psalm 16. actually I'm sorry it was home 16. but one more this last quote after David said this he said my heart shall rejoice I wish you read it psalm 16 my heart will rejoice and my flesh shall Rest In Hope why my heart shall rejoice because I've got God before me all the time I love that my heart shall rejoice because I've got God before me all the time that's where your joy comes from your peace your long-suffering that's why you can Rejoice because it's not you that has the strength but it's God that has given you the strength to live in this Dark Age of laodicea and age all my flesh shall rest notice all my flesh shall Rest In Hope if I die I'll be raised again for heal and not suffer his holy one to see corruption neither will he leave his soul in Hell see when David put God before him and was conscious that constantly he was in the presence of God seek ye first the kingdom of God let's go to Psalm 16 and we'll go with verse 1. is to read that so it says in verse 1. preserve Me O God for in thee do I put my trust O my soul thou thou has said unto the Lord thou are my Lord my goodness extended not to thee let's go to verse 5. the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou maintain is my lot verse 8 verse 9 sorry verse 7. I Will Bless The Lord who has given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night Seasons I have sent the lord always before me because he's at my right hand I shall not be moved so for setting the lord always before us we're in that trial we can't be moved because we put the Lord before us and we know we're in this trial free Divine Purpose because God is trying to beat more of his image into us because we're not going to heaven just because our name is Mark Cosby or brother John or Brother Joseph brother Jonathan but we're going in heaven because it'll be just like him and that just like him processes is starting in Trials because he's molding you he's shaping you he's the master Potter we're the clay and he's the Potter verse 9. therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope for thou will not leave my soul in Hell who's thankful for that neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption that will show me the path of life he will show you the path of life if you're seeking after his heart if you're following his Commandments if you're trusting in Him he'll show you the path of life he said our plans to prosper and give you an expected end for a reason he didn't say that because it just sounded good but he said it because he meant that in thy presence is fullness knows that in his presence is what fullness of joy yeah at thy right hand there are Pleasures ever more amen so look the word up Delight uh so Delight is a high degree of pleasure or satisfaction of mind and joy to affect with great pleasure to please highly to give or afford High satisfaction or joy as a beautiful landscapes the lights so like David said we got a delight in the law of the Lord it's awesome to finish definition I Harmony Delights in The Ear The Good Conduct of children especially their Petty Delights their parents so our hearts must be fixed on the Lord at all times we can't afford to get distracted amen we're too late in this race to get distracted we're too late not to finish this race just because we started off strong in the beginning we still have to finish the end so like I said before Satan is throwing everything he has all his Arsenal everything up his sleeve he's trying to throw everything he he has because his knows his time is short and if he can get us just distracted one one percent he has you see God isn't looking for 99 but he's looking for 100 of your life this is not a math test where you get past the 99 but God is looking for a hundred percent and we owe God everything that we have inside of us to give it to him and I promise if you give everything you have to God he's going to bless you abundantly let's go to Romans 13 11. and that knowing the time that now it is at high time to wake out of sleep notice what Paul says right here for now is our Salvation nearer then when we believe one more time and that knowing the time that now it is high time to wake out of sleep if you're sleeping wake up it's no time to sleep it's no time to let you flow off the gas we got to keep straight forward Don't Look Behind look straight forward God's always moving forward God doesn't move behind he moves forward he says for now is our Salvation nearer then when we believe we're coming closer to the rapture and they're still the Rapture hasn't happened they're still Souls that's why it hasn't happened maybe there's somebody in your life that only you can reach and we need to be sober Vigilant we need to be diligent we need to be disciplined because a disciple the word disciple has discipline in there so we got to discipline ourselves daily amen amen let's go to Romans 8. don't worry it's not 8 28. Miss so in Romans it's the um let me get there myself so Romans 8 and we'll go towards the end of Romans 8 actually so it says in Romans 8. verse 35. so who shall separate us from the love of Christ so he's asking us the question what's going to separate you from Love Of Christ and it says shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Prevail or sword so is are you gonna let that separate you from the love of Christ anybody amen no amen as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us verse 38 Fran persuaded so Paul's saying right here that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers it's more nor things present or nor things to come so whatever the devil is going to throw at you a week from now two weeks from now two hours from now don't let those things separate you from the love of Christ don't let that separate you from being a man after God's Own Heart because Paul just claimed right here when Jesus died he died so these things could not separate you from him he's giving you the overcoming power to all these things so don't let anything get in the way of your walk with God because we've come too far we've marched too far God's given us eyes of Malachi 4. God's given us eyes of his word he's given us a Vindicated word that it's not just here but he's played he wants to place it in here if that word can be placed in here we can be where Miss Jesus Christ for a reason so verse 39 he said nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in what in Christ Jesus our lord let's go to Second Corinthians 4 16. and so the Bible says for which cause we faint not but though our outward men perisheth yet the inward man is renewed day by day so when that carnal man dies then that man inside can be renewed day by day Paul said I Die daily for a reason amen so what pleases God I'm gonna ask that question to you guys I made a couple answers brother John what please is God Amen brother Jonathan what place is God Amen brother Ron what place is God Amen Brother Bruce what place is God amen amen what touches his heart anybody what touches a guy's heart amen amen we're going to find out these answers you gave them all all the right answers we're going to see them in the scriptures go to Psalms 34 18. because we want to make sure that we're pleasing God every day and we're touching his heart because the end of the day that's all that's going to matter what we did for God Amen what we did with this light that he's given us because we only got one life to live it shall soon pass was done for Christ will last so in Psalms 34 and go to verse 18. the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken and or a broken heart and save as such be as a contrite spirit that's what the Lord is looking for us to be broken be humble we got to let go of everything that is besetting US distracting us and we've got to just look to what the author and finish of our faith that's what the scripture tells us and so it's okay if sometimes the world just sometimes it just you know just gets to us it kind of just you know feel like everything is just going wrong when you feel that type of feeling go straight into prayer because what he's your Refuge he's a strong tower and don't forget that he he is those things and we gotta always remember that he's a high priest that can be touched by what the feeling of our infirmities and he knows even here he even sees and hears when a tear hits the ground so he knows all those things let's go to Isaiah 57. we'll read verses uh this verse 15 this one verse out of here and then we'll go to James 4. oh I forgot Proverbs three fives on here too so we'll go to 15. for those saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy so I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit notice what it says to revive the spirit of the humble so humility is so important that's what pleases God is humility that's one that's one of the things that pleases God is humility because he wants to look at says and to revive the heart of the contrite ones so he wants to revive us our spirit he wants to survive our hearts and we don't have to wait until a Revival comes to be revived but we can have a Revival every day in our in our spiritual walk with God it just depends how what you're feeding on in your attitude amen amen and we're going to go to um James 4. how we're doing on time and reverses um James 4 I believe we're gonna start with verse 4. I believe yep I do uh yeah we'll do verse 4. James 4 4 and we'll go to verse um eight he adulterouses and adulteresses adulterers and adulterous sis know you not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God do you think that the scriptures saith in vain that the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy so we have another old man inside of us that loves to lust after the things of the world and we have to recognize it and realize that that we're in a battle and the battle is between you and your carnal flesh the battle's not against me and Brother Bruce or me and brother Marty but it's Mark Cosby and Mark Cosby spiritual Mark Cosby in the carnal Mark Cosby and but knows what he says right in verse in six but he giveth more grace wherefore you saith God resisted the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble so if you have everything figured out God can't show you anything but if you're a lamb was a lamb do as we heard shears all of its rights away and that's what humility is you you know you have this Liberty you can do anything you want to but you don't want to because it won't be pleasing to God so true so true Liberty is you giving your rights away see Satan wants to paint some picture where Liberty is what the world society is you could you're you can do whatever you want with your body you can do this you can whatever but that's not a type of Liberty that's his bondage this is Liberty uh clothed in bondage because that's all it is is bondage because you doing your own will is you doing the devil's will that's what your own will is that's what it's that's what carnality is and true Liberty is submitting unto your master Shepherd amen so it says submit yourself so no so notice first you have to humble yourself and then you can submit because if you're proud you're never going to submit yourself because you think you don't have to but if you're if but if you're humble then you're gonna submit yourself therefore to who to God and then you can resist the devil so a humble submit and then risk the devil wrist resist the devil and then guess what he will flee from you because you're in connection with God and when you're in connection with God Satan can do nothing he is powerless against you but if you're not in connection with God then Satan can trick you he can deceive you uh he can hurt you uh so many we can keep going down the list what he can do but when you're in the presence of God connected with God then Satan is powerless against you and it says and notice so we got humble submit then you can resist and then it says draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you so in order for all this to happen humility has to be the first thing you got to realize how in Need You are of God and when a humble person recognizes that he's in need of God he's going to want to draw nigh to God so it says draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you so you have to make that First Act you have to do your 50 as we heard on Sunday says cleanse your hands so we play a part so it's impartial cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded we'll keep going be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning in your joy to heaviness verse 10 humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up now I think a lot of times people I think lift up is like oh look at me but I believe maybe I'm wrong but I believe when he's going to lift you up he's going to lift you up in the Heavenly places with him that he can be manifested so yeah I don't want to be lifted up I want people to see me because I I have so many flaws I can give you a list of them if you want them I made so many mistakes and I want somebody just to see Christ in me because that's what I was putting this Earth for and I want a closer walk with them the more closer I can get with him that's probably not even correct English the closer I can get to God the more people can see a written bible and that should be our desire let's go to Proverbs 3 5. that was also um in the Bible study they didn't know about that's okay I love that so Proverbs 3 5. so we're just we're just trying to see what pleases God and what touches his heart and then after that we're going to finish in the Book of Psalms so Proverbs 3 and verses through five through six I believe so it says we probably heard it so many times but I think it's fitting to hear this again I think we we can't hear hear this too much because it says trust in the Lord with all thy heart notice that so you're not trusting just partially or he might do this but you're believing he's going to do this amen if I if I trust him with all my heart the scripture says he's going to help you so it says trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not unto their own understanding and notice in all thy ways acknowledge Him in all thy ways and he shall direct thy Pastor scripture telling us if we trust with him in all our heart in in all ways acknowledge Him then it says he's going to direct our paths but the thing is a lot of times we want the blessings of God without following the word of God I'm saying one more time we want the blessings of God sometimes without following all the word of God and we wonder why God isn't answering but we need to look back and see if we're following all the Commandments that God has commanded in his Bible for us to follow to get that blessing because if person X Y and Z got the blessing of God guess what they followed the blueprint that God gave them so if we follow that same blueprint not like robots but in the newness of life then God is obligated this is humble God is obligated because he is bound to his word it's forever forever settled in heaven for a reason and he's not a man that will lie and his voice his word would not return void so if you meet the same requirements if you're ever one the Holy Ghost tonight and you met every requirement God is obligated to fill you and seal you to the day of your Redemption if you want healing it's in the word he already died for your healing you're just claiming until the manifestation happens so if you've met everywhere if they that wait upon our Lord shall renew their strength if you're waiting then there's no time limit but God will renew your strength you just gotta believe that he's going to do it in his perfect time verse 7 be not wise in thy own eyes no fear the lord notice that fear the lord and notice what says another commandment and depart from Evil so you got to fear the lord and depart from evil so let's go to Psalm 16. uh actually no read 16 11. let's go to 16 11 then we'll go to 15. so so 16 11 we read this already but read again says that will show me the path of life in my presence is the fullness of joy so if you're looking for joy in any other place but in the presence of God you'll never find it I don't care how many cars you buy how many uh Collectibles you buy how many whatever you fill in the blank you'll never you'll be searching constantly and be missing always feel like you're missing something amen and go to 15 Psalms 15 which is this next door and reverses one through five Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle it's asking a question who shall dwell in the Holy Hill he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart so Noah's heart is just mentioned so many times not talking about just your fleshly heart but your spiritual heart if we could say it that way because God said I'll give you a new heart and says he that back biteth not with this tongue nor doeth evil so saying is saying these people who are going to abide in there he that backbideth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor in verse 4 in whose eyes a vile person is condemned but he honoreth them that fear the lord notice that again fear the lord amen uh he that sweareth not to his own hurt and changeth not he that puteth not out his money to assuring or taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved so all these things just telling us what we should do and shouldn't do and it says never would never be moved amen so if we're doing these things fearing the Lord seeking after his heart seeking after the perfect will of God following his Commandments then how can we be how can we be moved because we're standing in God we're standing in his righteousness not ours his grace his Mercy his strength his power his Revelation so if we're standing all those things that are God then how can we be moved because we recognize my help coming from who the Lord and if you recognize where everything comes from which comes from God then your eye is going to be fixed on him your heart's going to be fixed on him so I think we can never forget what he did at Calvary because if you ever if you if you forget that you'll lose your indebtedness so let's never lose that indebtedness to God and we'll always have our eyes fixed upon him let's go to Psalms 37. amen verse 1. fret not thyself because of evil doers so let's not worry about what's happening in the world all these things are happening yeah you want to be obviously informed but let it not affect your walk with God because perilous times in in the book of Timothy Paul tells us these things aren't you know a surprise men's Gonna Be Love of theirselves and uh unthankful and all the Unholy having a form of godliness without the power thereof so all these things are meant to happen these are the scriptures being fulfilled which we should be happy they're being fulfilled because we're that that much closer to the coming of the Lord amen service scriptures that's being fulfilled in the Bible and we're almost home verse 3. verse two neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down so this world is going to be cut down so you know what do we have to worry about God's Vengeance will be mine if they don't repent and turn them to God then they're gonna have they're gonna have to answer for why they didn't do that like the grass and whether as the green herb says trust in the Lord notice how much that that word is used in Proverbs it says trust in the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verily thou shall be fed Delight thyself I remember uh my brother was talking to me yesterday uh the scripture and this I just felt in my heart to put this in here if you just look look at verse 4 the first look at verse 4 the first verse Delight look at verse five commit and then look at verse seven rest and look at verse eight cease all those are so important we're going to just get into that but I just love that I was just looking at them like man I can just see it clearly now I just see the word I see Delight commit rest cease I'm like and let's go I love the word amen trust in the Lord and do good so thou shall dwell in the land and verily shall not be fed verse 4 Delight thyself also in the Lord and we know what Delight means a high degree of pleasure or satisfaction of mind and joy and it says and he shall give the desires of thine heart but we got to make sure our desires are lining up with the word of God because a lot of times we have desires that are lustful desires we got to make sure that our desires please God because we're like oh why did he give Desires in my heart maybe they're not lining up with God's plan for your life your motive isn't lining up so sometimes we gotta just look back and see what maybe God didn't answer for a certain reason and even a no from God is just as good as a yes so it says commit thy way unto the Lord notice that commit so trust commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and say that word again trust also in him so you got to commit yourself unto God and trust that he's going to lead you to the end Mark that high calling that that that Perfect Image that theophany so you got to trust that he can do that and he shall bring it to pass and he shall also he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and the Judgment as the Noonday verse 7 rest in the Lord now that's not talking about some lazy rest it's not talking about that kind of rest because your rest is the Holy Ghost see when you're resting then you can truly work if you're arrested in the Holy Ghost you can truly be a worker that the Holy Ghost can use that's the type of rest that we're talking about not as the world says in your lay back in a lazy boy but resting in the Lord knowing that he's your Jehovah Jireh that he's your healing that he's your portion all those things you can rest in knowing the Lord if you need healing he's going to provide that if you need food in the table he's going to provide that if you need money in the bank account he's going to provide that if you need a vehicle he's going to provide that if you need clothes guess what he's going to provide that it'll keep going verse uh finish verse 7 up and wait it says rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him see God doesn't work on your time he works on his perfect time say one more time God doesn't work on your time he works on his perfect time says wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way don't look to other person in the world that's prospering don't worry about that God blesses the just and unjust I'd rather have my soul prospering all day every day over me having a million dollars in my bank account this is dishonest with you because a million dollars in make account doesn't mean that you're that much closer to God than the next Joe it doesn't says who prospereth in the way his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass verse eight no cease from anger and forsake wrath it's telling us to let that go let the anger go let the Wrath go because only wrath and anger is going to destroy you eventually if you let it so we can't have anger and wrath in our life we got to forsake those things fret not thyself and any wise to do evil forever do or shall be cut off but those that Waits upon the Lord they show and inherit the earth and then we'll go to verse 23. the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall notice that though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand I have been young and now am old yet now I have seen I I not seen the righteous forsaken nor is seed begging for bread could we serve up a mighty God he's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you he's going to be with you until the end whatever your end is whatever my end is he's going to be with you until the end his Mercy he is ever merciful and lindeth and his seed is blessed notice verse 27 says saying depart from Evil and do good and dwell forevermore so it says depart from Evil and do good and dwell forevermore so God wants to give us things that he is in store for us he wants to bless you exceedingly abundantly than what you expect but he cannot give it to you unless our ways are committed unto him we must trust Delight commit rest and seize cease so look those words up so trust confidence so when you're trusting in somebody you have confidence that they're going to fulfill what they said just like as a parent to a or a kid to a parent they have trust that your mom and dad are going to provide for you say a Reliance so when we're trusted in God we're relying on God we're arrested says resting off the mind on the Integrity veracity Justice friendship or other sound principle of another person to be confident of something present or future United is going to believe that God God can do this but you're going to believe he will do this because his word declares he's going to do this so it says resting uh friendship other sound principle another person to be confident of something present or future says to commit to the care of incompetence trust your maker with yourself in all your concerns or no more time trust your maker with yourself and all your concerns and I like the word delight a high degree of pleasure or satisfaction of Mind joy to affect with great pleasure to please highly so you're delightening God you want to please him highly to give or afford High satisfaction or joy as a beautiful landscape Delights the eyes Harmony Delights The Ear The Good Conduct of children and especially their Delights their parents so commit to give in trust to put in the hands or power of another so you're willing to let go of your plans your hopes your dreams your thoughts and commit yourself unto God lord if the plans that I have don't line up with your plans I'm gonna kick them right out and so you got to be willing to commit yourself to God daily because it's so easy for those things just to creep in our lives and we we kind of don't get committed as we once were we got to be just as committed as we were when we started the race so we can finish the race like that because many has started in this race but have not finished it that's right they they they gave up they threw the tile in let us not be any of those people that have thrown the towel in like I said before we've come too far to not to be a man after God's Own Heart so it says trust aren't sorry to give trust to put in the hands or power of another to entrust with confidence or relying with him for wrestling in the mind so we gotta cease as well and cease means to put a stop so this the Bible says to cease from anger to put it in to Cease the rage also means Extinction to stop to be at an end as wondrous ceases the storm had when a storm stops and it's gone it stops no more same thing in our life we gotta stop those things that are taking us away from God we got to stop playing in fire and just walk away from it let it go if God is calling you to leave something leave it don't try to play it Samson tried to play with Delilah and look what happened that wasn't I don't believe that's God's perfect will for him just to perish like that but what he did was he gave his heart to Delilah while still trying to serve God right and God can't use you in the magnitude that he wants you to use if you're playing with Delilah Emma and Delilah is the type of the world you have to have a girl in your life but Delilah can be something that you've been holding on to that you haven't let go let go of it we've come too far so expectations this is from brother Brandon 1950 August 10th but look you can't judge Men by the size of his stature I've seen men that weigh 200 pounds and have an ounce of man man is judged by character man and then and then be a man after the heart a man after God's heart and God will bless you so he'll bless you for being a man after his own heart and we'll finish up in give me one second we'll finish up with this quote actually I was thinking of Jairus in the Bible when he said come lay your hand on my daughter and she she shall live but the Roman Centurion the Gentile he said I'm not worthy that you'll come under my roof let's look at the humility he said just speak the word Jesus admired that I love that because that Roman realized that Jesus I love this head every disease under his control so that Roman Centurion maybe to some Jew was um a heathen but he recognized that Jesus Christ who he was had had power over every disease and he felt So Unworthy to be in the presence of the king that he even went he said just speak the word and I know my servant will be healed so we got to have that type of faith knowing maybe you've been dealing with something for years remember that woman 12 years dealing with that blood issue and she made up in her mind if I just touched the Hem of His Garment and she didn't let the her other past failures just distract her or hurt her but she said if I just touched him in His Garment and he said thy faith heals it so maybe maybe we just need a touch of him of His Garment tonight may we just need to touch his heart tonight let's finish this quote he said Jesus or just speak the word and my servant will live and those what brother bran says right here and that's the way we want to be Christians to admire and to stand up as great gallient soldiers in the face of conflict and let our heavenly father say I have a child that I'm proud of let's be like job he said job have you my perfect servant Joel I have the child that I'm proud of you know God does look upon us like that amen because you know he said David was a man after his own heart and knows what he says right here and that's the way we want to be after his own heart so in this day and age our heart needs to be fixed upon him we need to trust him in every situation we're going through because this is getting darker and darker and these doors are going to close one day I want to make sure that we're every time we're sitting in these seats every time we're in the prayer the prayer room needs to be full every service we don't need to be talking before service we got to be seeking him talking with if you want to talk with anybody talk with God because you can talk with me before a service but I can't give you anything I can't give you anything but if we're spending time with God before service then God can just move in such a mighty way and God wants to move in a mighty way but if we're not preparing our heart for not seeking on him on a daily basis if we're not going after him we ought to go after God because the devil wants you to not go after God because he knows when you go after God and seek God then healing is going to happen spiritual healing physical healing Revelation is going to happen life direction is going to happen confusion is going to go away turn to peace and so we gotta be seeking after those things which is the things of God that's going to give us fruit I don't want this right I want rotten fruit I want fruit that will help sustain somebody else amen oh it was we're going to stand to our feet in this invite sister Cheryl so I just look at the life of David and want to be like David faith faith like David love God like David because David was a man after God's Own Heart now I'm just so thankful that God placed this man in the Bible for us and we just see brother Brandon mentioned David lots of times and I think it's very in order for us to maybe go back in the Book of Psalms let's look at David's life look how the things he wrote he knew how to praise the Lord he knew how to Worship the Lord he knew how to love the Lord and let's just look at his example and say Lord help me to live a life similar to David yeah we can't be David but we can be like David because guess what was in David the spirit of Christ was in David it's in Paul so we could be like Paul like Christ all these servants were pointing to Jesus Christ and so I just see that I just believe that in this day and age we need to unite together more we need to pray more we need to seek God more say Lord what do you want me to be on this Earth who do you want me to speak to today what do you want me to do for you today and that's being a man after God's Own Heart because you're you're setting aside your will your plans sometimes like brother Ferguson said this we'll plan a day out and and not even include God into it sometimes God might change the whole direction of your day Say Hey I want you to do this instead of this today like you might want a fat he might want you to fast today or something whatever it is always be open for God to change your plans but never be open to change God's plans so if we could just sing near The Cross I think that's where we need to be [Music] Me Near The Cross [Music] [Applause] Mountain free to all the healing stream flows from calvary's Mountain [Music] in the cross in the cross be my glory [Music] forever till my raps are soul shall

Lord Jesus we we just see the enemy Lord just trying to work in overtime Lord we see him Lord just working in politics and so many things but Lord I pray that none of this shakes our faith Lord that we just have that faith that was once delivered to the Saints Lord I put that same Faith Lord just reside in US Lord now we can just commit ourselves unto you just trust in you Delight in you Lord and deceased from the things that have taken us away from you Lord there's been so many things in our lives Lord that have distracted us Lord I pray from this day for Lord they will no longer let us distract us from our walk with you Lord that Lord will just walk humbly and pleasing unto you Lord father just give us the overcoming strength that we need Lord we can't overcome this age without you lord we can't do without you lord you're our strength you're our life you're our Holy Ghost you're everything Lord and we need you to dwell Rich to just dwell richly in US Lord help us Lord I pray

our footsteps may you guide our footsteps Lord Lord just change our nature Lord change our lives Lord I pray father that from this day four we'll just submit ourselves unto you that you can just do that Mighty work you said he that started the good work and would finish that work you know we have faith that you're going to finish that work Lord if we trust in you if we commit unto you then Lord you're obligated to finish that work Lord because all you're looking for is a man after your own heart all you're looking for is a man who's willing to lay everything aside to please you to follow all
