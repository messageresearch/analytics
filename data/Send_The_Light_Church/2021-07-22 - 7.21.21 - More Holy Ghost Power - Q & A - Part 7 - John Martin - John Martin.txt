i'm learning to lean i'm learning to lead her jeans gaining more power than i ever seen i'm learning to lean on [Music] i'm learning [Music] gaining more power that i've ever seen i'm learning to lean on jesus amen a very appropriate song chorus for our message tonight we want to entitle this holy ghost power and we need to lean upon jesus more and brother brahms going to share with us just really how to do that and with all the evil powers that are uh becoming stronger and stronger in this late hour that we're living in we need more and more power of the holy ghost amen well god bless you this evening good to see you everyone i i uh these would be some more people on sister linda's side of the church it looks like it's a little out of balance well um sister cheryl want to remember to continue to pray for her um she's not feeling real well but i was wondering is everybody got feel good with the temperature at this time a little hot a little hot we got some people saying a little cold feels good you know i we got a good happy medium that's that was the main thing if everybody's leaning until one way you know that i could help but uh well praise the lord let's turn to the book of acts for opening scripture we'll have a word of prayer have you be seated then we'll we want to kind of finish up the questions and answers today if we could i sure have enjoyed them amen amen let's now in prayer and just ask god to be with us lord we stand here helpless without you we don't have anything to stand on without you and lord we don't want to be up here without you we don't want to read your word without your uh your holy spirit we don't want to hear this word without the holy spirit we just need you in everything lord come prepare our hearts our minds and to be able to receive what you have for us today we thank you for this now in jesus precious name we pray amen amen acts chapter one starting with verse number four and being assembled together with them he commanded them that they should not depart of jerusalem but wait for the power oh i'm sorry for the promise of the father i just gave it away what the promises which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time so there are certain times certain things that we're not to know or of the seasons which the father have put into his own power but i'm going to give you power but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in judea and in samaria and on to the uttermost parts of the earth amen god bless you may be seated we love these words i'll tell you the holy ghost is what we really need amen amen well we had two questions left and um they're not together but i want to go over them both uh one i'd like to make it short and the first this first question is when our loved ones that our true believers pass away are they with jesus awake or are they sleeping until the rapture so this is a good question and the answer is they are both awake and they are sleeping the bible says the dead in christ are sleeping so why do they use the word sleeping because the word jesus used the word dead and we're going to read some scriptures here but they're not sleeping as we would think they're sleeping they're not dead as we would think they were dead and they're not sleeping as we would think sleeping is but it's the same principle as if they were so let's just imagine somebody's at your house and they're sleeping and you there they just fell asleep in the living room after dinner and you're having a conversation but the person sleeping doesn't hear one thing that you're saying they are alive they are there but they're sleeping they're in a they're they're they're in another conscious they're conscious they're they're not with you they're in another conscious so it's the same thing with those of our loved ones who are in christ and they've gone on to be on the other side they are alive and well they're not sleeping but in the same principle we don't have access to the their conscience where they're at and um they're if i could say it like this we want to look at that word as waiting um um we're waiting for bob to wake up he's taking a nap he's alive but we're waiting for him to to to get up the same with those that that are are going on to the other side they're in a waiting place and um we don't have access to them but they're alive so they're not dead amen they're away from us just like someone who's snoring and sleeping they're in another realm as it were um these are in another dimension in their waiting so let's look at some scripture here that's first thessalonians chapter four i believe that is why the word sleeping is being used but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope you know somebody that's sleeping you have a hope that they're gonna you know get up in the morning that they're going to wake up someone that's dead there's no hope okay for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so then which sleep in jesus will god bring with him amen for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that they which are a lie that's you and i and remain unto the second coming of the lord if i could say it like that shall not prevent or precede them which are asleep so god is going to bring them with him and then they're going to meet us for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout brother man toast that's the message with the voice of the archangel that's christ himself and with the trumpet of god and we know that's the announcement of the marriage supper and the dead in christ shall rise first so he gets them first these are the ones that are waiting if i can say this i don't want to stumble anybody but they are not with the lord yet when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and he was so anxious to see jesus he said where's jesus and they said can't see him right now he's up a little higher so in one sense god's presence is with them just like god's presence is with us but it's not just great great rape next to us not right right next to them it's gonna happen at this time it's just a combination he's going to get them be with them and they're going to we're going to meet him in the air isn't that beautiful so they're waiting for the appropriate time then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever ever ever we're not going to be separated anymore ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words and i think with all the trials that we go through we need to just comfort one another with these words now brother branham said in the message the uncertain sound he said we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet shall sound all those soldiers laying under asleep across through the ages but when the trumpet sounds though they be dead in sleep that's how he said it though they be dead in sleep shall not hinder them for the trumpet shall sound and awaken them they're prepared those unprepared don't know the sound when the sound of the coming of the lord blasts it shall shake heaven and hell when it blasts but those who are in hell those who are lost don't know the sound they don't know what to do but those though but those though they be sleeping in christ they know that certain sounds that's why we're here today is to to know the sound of the gospel to know the voice of god and and to grow amen now um when we i'd asked you to if you had any questions i wanted one thing to be the common denominator and that these questions should resolve around your personal relationship with jesus christ and i'm so glad because that's we don't have time to be working on anything else except our relationship with god it's getting late but the majority of the questions had to do with some sort of spiritual warfare now what's important to understand this is that if we want to build a relationship with god we're going to have to go through a spiritual warfare questions like how can i overcome how can i combat what are the best devices to use against satan even when we think about the best way to approach god satan is there he has it out for us and he don't want us to approach god or even when we set out to be an undeniable witness for christ satan's intentions are to block us so we don't witness so leaving us in some sort of spiritual warfare and even this last question we see a spiritual battle here and that question is how to have a conviction that the lord has put on your heart but since you're so embarrassed it's hard to confront the person and the person doesn't even know that you did this wrong so the lord has told this believer to do something but this thing that was asked of the lord somehow brought an embarrassment to them are you with me there's nothing more than a spiritual battle going on in the mind amen the devil is always presenting his case why we shouldn't have to follow through with what god said of course the devil basically he just doesn't want us to do anything that god wants us to do but jesus taught us to pray thy will be done here on earth as it is in heaven amen so there's the spiritual the battle now when all these thoughts are happening in our mind we need to remember that we're engaging in a spiritual battle these battles cannot be won with logic with feelings with emotions because they're spiritual we must remember above everything that soon as this stuff starts happening we've entered a spiritual battle ephesians 6 verse 12 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood we wrestle not against flesh and blood so we hear something and we feel that we need to do this or the lord asks us to do that but we we begin to reason and thinking and with feelings and emotions and logic and what are they going to think and this that is that a big deal before you know it we're trying to handle this without a spiritual warfare right in other words we're trying to be carnal logical about it and be smart if you ever ever ever plan on winning a spiritual battle you need to stop wrestling with your carnal flesh or somebody else's carnal flesh you need to put the mind of christ on that's where the battle is happening is in our mind and we need the mind of christ to win amen the mind of christ says put on the whole armor of god that you might be able to stand so we need to put the whole armor of god against principalities against powers against rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in our places i'm glad they use that word against we need the whole armor of god to go against these negative spirits that are attacking our mind amen they're against the thoughts of god that's true now if you know where these thoughts are really coming from you'll cast them down but to see the key is satan wants us to think that they're not coming from him and that's where all the logic comes in where you got to like figure it all out god don't want us to figure anything out he just wants us to do what he told us to do amen second corinthians chapter 10 verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they're mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds we don't want to try some carnal way to get out of the situation or to prove a right or to make some point those are carnal devices that's where you're trying to involve yourself in the battle and handle the battle your way that has to be gone we've got to put more practice into dealing with the spiritual battles god's way and his way is just cast the imagination down you know what to do just cast everything down can you imagine if jesus said if you got out against your brother why don't you take some time to think about it and see really who caused it and um you know you need to just make sure that it's proper for you to go to that person because it could be more their fault than your fault and if it is it can bring more confusion and you don't want to do that so let's you just gotta cast it down he told us what to do just do it amen cast out imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience see the thoughts that we're getting is satan trying to get us not to be obedient amen amen and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when our obedience is fulfilled so you just gotta i'm i'm so against this not doing what the lord wants me to do i'm just so ready i'm moving forward do ye look on the things after the outward appearance if any man trust himself to be that he is christ let him think let him of himself think this again that as he is christ even so are we christ in other words you may not always agree what the bible says and think that your christ but paul's taking us right back to the word so who cares about the outward appearance just focus on this thing right here usually when we do something wrong and we're all experts at that today we've been well trained by the best but when we do something wrong we realize afterwards we began to just naturally feel bad about it why did i do that why did i say that why did i act like that why was i being so stubborn why was i being unworkable why was i being impatient and and critical why didn't i try harder why didn't i go the second mile why did i just turn my cheek why didn't i just keep my mouth shut why didn't i just let it go why don't i just forgive them again why don't i just cover them with love why didn't i pray first offer a helping hand why did i just wash their feet why didn't i do unto others as i would have them do unto me and i'll tell you that it's almost endless of the things that we do or don't do and afterwards calls us to feel awkward sheepish embarrassed ashamed self-doubting rattled nervous disturbed uncomfortable withdrawn disappointed helpless down discouraging even sometimes defeated as a believer so this is a question not for the person who wrote it but this is a question for all of us [Music] how do we deal with this thing and what we really need when we're feeling this way is simply the power of the holy ghost we try to deal with all these things carnally and you just need the power of the holy ghost it's not so much what we've done or what we haven't done is the issue the issue is what needs to be done afterwards but the man says it's not the action but the reaction that counts we're in a battle we're going in and out of war zones constantly and we need to know how to react we need to be instant in season and out of season and what can help us is nothing but the holy ghost we need the power of god amen it'll take care of this stuff amen imagine that you did one of these bonehead mistakes maybe you acted like bozo maybe you were acting like humpty dumpty sitting on a wall too long and afterwards you're feeling so awkwardly embarrassed and you just wish you could just get some sort of counseling about the situation from jesus i would imagine jesus counseling us and telling us that you're no match for the devil because what's happening right now is the devil is pouncing now he wants to sift you like wheat yes amen i would imagine jesus telling us that what we really need is to get the power of the holy ghost because there's only thing only one thing greater than the power of the devil and that is the power of god not us thinking that we're greater than the devil revelation chapter 3 verse 18 let's get some real counseling from jesus he said i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire amen that thou mayest be rich amen and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isaf that thou mayest see god knows that the only thing that's going to defeat this situation is deity is god himself and we can't go to anybody else but god for that amen come by of me gold tried in the fire the thing of it it's not free you have to buy you're not buying with money but it will cost you your will it'll cost you your pride it'll cost your arrogancy you have to hunger and thirst for god to get more of god and cry out for the power of the holy ghost and i know this is an old-time religion but that's what we need give me this old-time religion [Music] amen you know we can have holy ghosts and it can slip out we need to get revived amen anything no there's nothing more that will encourage us and keep us like the holy ghost that's right that's right and being assembled together acts chapter 1 verse 4 opening scripture being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father now the promise from the father is a power and that's we we have we all make these bloops all the time right do we not in some fashion formal way they're happening all the time now what we need is a power to deal with it correctly yes yes we want a power not to do it but no it cannot be expected of any human being to go through life and not have some sort of regrets some scars or things that they've done wrong we're human beings so we're not looking to perfect flesh don't never happen but we need the power of god how to deal with this flesh and and and jesus promised us power when we get the holy ghost he said john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost now for you that have the holy ghost this message is really for you because we don't have enough holy ghost you have if you had twice the holy ghost that you have today you would have you still need more that's true because we got it in in measure and portion but the thing of it is our blunders come from not having enough of god and how we react to our blunders has a lot to do with not having enough realness to deal with the situation this is it we're like wondering what do i do what do i do well god is not wondering what to do we just need him inside and then we know what to do so i say it like this focus on hungering for more of god and not feeling that i i already have god because this this this message can't help if you already have enough of god i'm not saying doubt what you have i'm saying realize there's more there's more there's more and and more gives more victory more joy more peace more love more giving more laying down your life more not hurting when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father have put in his own power this is so amazing to me that he uses the word power he doesn't say that's you know that's just for the father he's got that handle he's bringing this to the knowledge that it's a power jesus says i have i have power to lay down my life i have power to raise it up amen he said you he told uh pilate you don't have a power to do anything let's say given to give it to you of my father now here's here's the thing when we look at all these blunders and we look at the question and how many times have you did something or and you just felt so awkward embarrassed and shamed and you just you got rattled from the situation and you just wish that you had something greater than what you had that's power but imagine jesus just when jesus stood by brother branham he says now i take every spirit in my control fearless amen that was tommy hicks's testimony you may not agree with this man but he's fearless in what he believes this is what we need not to allow the devil to make us so cow down and sheepish about some situation you know sometimes it's so hard for somebody just to say i'm sorry so hard for them to say i miss the mark i'm sorry it's because it's lacking the power of the holy ghost but you shall receive power after the holy ghost is come upon you so i want to say to all of us we all got a portion of the holy ghost brother branham said justification was a portion of the holy ghost but i want a greater power than what i have and i believe to this day i believe i would have more power of the holy ghost today if i would have spent more time seeking the holy ghost before today amen we have not because we ask not and the devil is doing a good job saying you got it you got it you got it you got it you got it you got enough but then we find ourselves all the time wondering why we're feeling the way we're feeling god's got the answer for us it's through the power of the holy spirit and i want power to lay down my life i want power because if i'm able to lay down my life i know god will give me power for a rapture but if i don't got power to lay down my life how is he going to give me the grace to go on a rapture the promise of the holy spirit comes with power power to witness when you say i'm sorry when you prefer your brother when you lay down your life when you wash somebody's feet when you turn your cheek you're a witness for christ amen it's not when you say hey jesus died for you i mean that's wonderful that's wonderful and we need that we need to go yelp but sometimes we need to be a witness inside a witness inside the church we're a family of god we're written of all men we see one another we're only deceiving ourselves thinking that we nobody sees who we are i think god wants us to wash one another the body washes the body amen amen now when the promise of the holy spirit comes now we have power to take correction from the holy ghost because how many times has the lord said something to us i don't know what's happening is you're separating yourself from the holy ghost but if the holy ghost had his way yes sir lord right brother brandon says if he could just get one man in his hands he could turn the world upside down he just wants to give us a little bit more of himself so we can handle the life that we're in he doesn't want us to go turn the world upside down he just wants us to turn our world upside down there's many many things jesus would like to say but without the power of the holy ghost we can't handle the truth we can't handle ben getting on our knees and washing somebody's dirty feet oh be it i'm going to do something like that and somebody might see me doing that well maybe jesus has called us to do that and if we do that out of obedience bring every thought into obedience to christ then maybe god will bless us with joy unspeakable and full of glory well i want the joy i want this i want maybe we need to do this first amen the holy ghost gives us power to react the right way to a wrong situation a right way to a wrong situation wrong situations are going to happen uh offenses are going to come amen trials are going to come amen in fact brother brian said the squeeze is going to get if there's going to be a squeeze and it's going to be harder than what we've ever had before it's things are going to happen amen what do we need the power of the holy ghost amen well how do we get it i come to church what else i got to do there's a lot more you need to do than come to church come to church don't give you the holy ghost but when you're serious about getting to church and what happens at church then you can receive more of the living word which is the holy ghost that's what the holy ghost is for it's to lead and guide us into all truth if a righteous man falls seven times he'll get back up and he'll keep moving forward so it's not about trying to be someone who doesn't fall it's about being honest about your fall and get back up and keep moving if someone asks you to go a mile he'll gladly go too right now well i you know i guess i got to go too i believe if we got the holy ghost we're going to want to turn the cheek we'll wash somebody's feet and if the person is too blind to even see that they got dirty feet you'll still wash them well it just seems like it's in vain they're using me they don't even you know what god in you is god in you doing no matter he's no respecter of persons [Music] i don't care if someone's some somebody's trying to sabotage you behind your back the holy ghost knows what to do the holy ghost doesn't need to come to me and ask me for counseling what to do about this situation i need to go to the holy ghost and get counseling from him what to do with the situation and if the holy ghost is preeminent in you it just handles the situation amen and that's us learning to yield the holy ghost gives us power to witness with our lives to me every bad situation provides an opportunity to witness for christ don't be afraid of negative situations don't be afraid of mistakes it gives god a chance to show he is the same yesterday today and forever amen like i said no one's ever going to be able to live without regret mistakes scars things that we're ashamed of but what we should be wanting is to limit them as much as possible which can only be done through the power of the holy ghost now we at work deal with a lot of problems every day that's what management's all about the buck stops here and one of the hardest things i feel to do is solve a problem without creating a new problem because most people when they want to solve problems they just they don't care what problems they create in the process they just go ahead and solve that one problem they don't care if they create five other problems that's not how the holy ghost works you solve the problem without creating new problems i'm telling you we need the power of the holy ghost i want to conclude i'm not concluding the service but i want to conclude this part let's get more serious about seeking more of the holy ghost amen no matter how much you have i say for whatever you have i praise god for it let's not stop there be willing to lift your hand just like someone who's a new believer that's seeking it you raise your hand with him and say god fill me with more the holy ghost too amen get out of the community and the network of having enough it is a community it is a network and the devils are working very hard to get you so you don't seek more of god because you'll be powerless get out of the atmosphere that breeds that you have enough holy ghost get out of those thoughts get out of those conversations get out of it how is god gonna how are you gonna ask for more if you think you got enough and you have not because you ask not i say set aside more time to die out set aside more time to die out not just the normal scenario do your prayer no just what are you going to do i'm going to go spend some rot out time i'm going to rot out set some time to deny your carnal nature to crucify the old man to deny your will just if that never happens how are you opening the door for god to come and give you more holy ghost he can't put anything more in there when it's so stuffed up with self amen satan is always trying we talked about this in our men's meeting satan is always trying to simultaneously think that you can have god in the world you can do your will in god's will you can do what you want and do what god's want we need to lay in the presence brother graham said of the s-o-n amen and allow the fruit of the holy ghost to ripen in our lives yes so i got some quotes i'd like to read if i could he says have to lay in the presence of the son this is trying to do god's service without it being god's will have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty of green we haven't got the sincerity now this is in 1965 this is in november of just one one month before his last sermon he says we're plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing that ought to have in our midst to know the spirit of the living god moving in his word and showing us the things if god could tell the prophet we need to be more sincere he need to be more where does that put us i'm way down the totem pole way down the totem pole we simply need more of the holy ghost among us a lot less of our flesh and hold yourself accountable to where you're at the thing is if the devil can get you to think you're fine you're just coming here to get some knowledge learn a little bit more try to be a little bit better you know hopefully what we hear today is just going to make us a better there's no power in that that's a seminar thinking we need to get rid of that and say i need to leave here with power i need to leave here with power now that doesn't always mean coming up to the altar and seeking the holy ghost it may mean lord the word that i'm here and let it be living inside of me it's hungering for a living god and not being satisfied with just the the knowledge of the message brother branham said in the message christ is revealed in his own word he said the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who have obtained it in their hearts must lie in the presence of the sun to get ripened amen so they've received it but they just refuse to lay in the presence of the sun to make it real it's got to drop from here to here it's got to be lived out there's nothing that can substitute a church attendance typhain doing something nice for some that doesn't do it we gotta lay in the presence of the sun he says you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making you matured christians see what i mean god is coming soon to receive his church and we must have the type of christians for him to receive the wheat has got to get ripe we can't just be thinking i'm seed i'm seed i'm in the message how about being interested in getting ripe for him well i'm ripe enough okay okay okay but for those that hear the voice we need to get more of god we need to manifest more of god amen it's not for everybody that that is not for everybody in the message the invisible union of the bride of christ brother brandon said it's the grain it can't go no further we're at the end time so what does it have to do now lie in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's exact the word to be ripened into your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about it can't be any plain we don't need we don't need more word we need the word that we have received to be living in us to be ripened and to be able to do what it says to do i won't be satisfied until i awaken that likeness in the message who do you say this is brother ben says now the wheat must be that way to lay in the presence of the sun to turn to a full gospel a golden grain for the master so this must become manifested in us a full gospel not just part i'm thankful for the the life of christ that's in me i'm ashamed for the life of christ that's not in me yes sir so where should my focus be these quote what brother bryan is saying laying the president's son laying the president he's not talking to unbelievers he's not talking to those that just came in amen wouldn't it be nice that you could walk up to anybody in the church hit them kick them do anything and they'd never do a thing to hurt you they'd be so full of god they'd never hurt you i can see why god doesn't want any isms in the body the way to have it is to have more god amen not to try to be better than the other person and prove that they're wrong and we just need to lay in the presence of the son amen you know to be honest with you if you think if somebody's going through a hard time and they're just you become the straw that breaks the camel's back if you know what i'm saying your situation god is placed in your hands an opportunity to be christ to them that to me is amazing that god would entrust any of us to be a witness and we look at it as oh why me why do i gotta go through this it's about helping somebody we need one another amen amen the message of man running from the presence of the lord brother ben says i believe we have the truth he said i'm satisfied with that i believe the wheat is absolutely the shuck is pulling away from it but the wheat has to lay in the presence of this s-o-n to ripen and that's what we're here for friend to stay in the presence of the son till our little group of people here to become so ripened to christ it becomes the bread on his table that's what i want to do and i love how he said it this little group here it just fits our little group here i love it it's the last year of his life he said that god's only place of worship god's only provided place of worship brother bram says just take my word for it if you believe me be sure to burn every bridge of the world behind you amen i believe the church is beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand this is one month one month before the accident he says i believe the church is beginning to hear the message and begin to understand it but friends listen we've got to lie in the presence of the son we've got to get ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that god has given us and we're seeing the signs that he has shown us and proving it by the bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lie in the presence till it's tendered up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe down i'll say it like this the message and all the quotes in the bible and all the quotes won't do us any good until it becomes manifested in her life in order to do that jesus said a seed must die and fall into the ground rot out in order for it to come forth and bring forth the fruit now brother branson says good you're understanding the message that's great we're hearing the message you know intellectually we're hearing it and we're seeing the signs and it's proven it's the bible but oh how the church needs to lie in the presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit that's what's missing well brother john i don't think i should have to do that i think you should have to do that you ever meet one of those people they got a higher standard for then they're willing to live i love this because this is not for everybody brother branham's talking to the bride here he goes on to continue to say later in that message now church we're teaching now but remember when you leave here start moving out of the shock now you're going into the grain he says but lie in the presence of the sun don't add to what i've said don't take away what i've said because i speak the truth as far as i know it as the father has given it to me don't add to it just say what i've said amen the thing of it is just tell people to come seek the lord jesus and then you yourself lie right in his presence just make love to him say oh lord jesus son of god i love you tender my heart lord take away all the filth and the love of the world amen and let me live holy in this present world before you so simple we don't need theologians we don't need he's pointing us to lay in his presence and he's actually showing us how to do it it's simple you stay there until you're ripened until that embarrassment leads until that shame leaves until you get deity inside of you it can't come any other way [Music] this is the last quote it was the third from his last message he ever preached modern events are made clear by prophecy brother branham says we're at the end of denominations the wheat's taken shape but what's the matter with the wheat now you can't it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the combine picks it up so come to church get more knowledge read more books listen to more tapes go to more churches live stream more it does not matter what is needed is to get in the presence of the sun so you can get ripened for the combine that's it i believe we have enough word to make a rapture if we never heard another word but what is wrong with what is wrong with us when we cannot put emphasis on the word that we've already heard like somehow we think it's just gonna magically come we've got a hunger to see it living in us everything brother branham has given us the the the antidote here it'll help us in our battles our spiritual battles in our mind the battles that we have with somebody the thing that seems to be so small of a thing laying in the presence of the son oh yeah i have heard about that quote before it needs to become a more of a major a major push for us you know saints we're not really fighting against one another we are fighting against the devil who's trying to keep us down so we need this so we can overcome the devil and his devices i just i want you to commit with me to seek the lord and to spend some time ripening amen amen you ever just get down on your knees and you're praying and you're just like you're not interested in it you're not feeling like it you wish it was you can't wait to the prayer time's over and you got things you want to do that day you know what i'm talking about that you know what's happening right there is you're facing rotten rottening out that's what you're facing at that moment and you don't want to you just want to get through this as fast as you can and get on but god is calling us to become more like him amen and in the simplicity of meeting god in your prayer closet he said i will reward you openly so let's spend some more time getting into the presence of the sun i want to ripen into his image when you get done all praying and you feel like well i don't got anything to pray about i don't feel like staying here i just got to get out i said would you take time pray for me amen pray for me it may help you to stay there just a little bit longer i believe our lives can change with this simple getting in god's presence we've heard the word god his presence can come and begin to quicken things to us that we've already heard amen amen let's stand together i think about all those times you had to wait more than 60 minutes i don't know if i can ever like make it up you know buddy i sure appreciate all the times that you've been patient with me amen let's look to the lord in prayer heavenly father lord as we stand in your presence we're so grateful for your mercies and your grace love and your long-suffering even your word declares that you have had you've paid you you've been long patiently waiting for the fruit to be manifested and lord we believe that we were a part of the end time bride that will go in a rapture and it is the hardest age to to live the spirits are much worse and we need more of the holy ghost to overcome and god i'm asking you today that you would remember your little bride here each member lord those that are live streaming those that perhaps will watch this that they feel a connection to the word that they've heard tonight lord i pray that you would fill them with your spirit oh god no matter how much they have given a double portion of what they have lord lord i pray that you would meet with us when we get in the prayer closet when we still wait some time to spend with you god would you just come i pray to every believer with your presence and just reward them for making the effort to do what you have asked us to do lord that we may be encouraged to continue to spend time with you in prayer to continue to seek you more than we ever have lord you're able to take us and make us a great witness for those that around us lord and we commit ourself into your hands lord phil is so full of the holy ghost the devil won't know what to do with us lord jesus we'll give you the praise and honor for in jesus precious name amen amen praise the lord let's sing let the holy ghost come in amen amen
