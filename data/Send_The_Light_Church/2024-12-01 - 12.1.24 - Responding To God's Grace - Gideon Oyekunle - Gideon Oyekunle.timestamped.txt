[46:12] enough but I know that uh is the grace
[46:15] of God upon your life amen that from

[46:22] you know all over the world not just
[46:24] only in Nigeria but all over the world
[46:26] is a great thing that you have done the
[46:29] prophet of the almighty God said you
[46:30] know that the reward shall be shared
[46:32] together in glory am so we look forward
[46:34] to that great time when we shall receive
[46:37] our reward and we believe you know that
[46:40] by the grace of God we will not lose our
[46:43] reward God bless you amen let's read The
[46:45] Word of Life
[46:48] Romans chapter 7 and Romans chapter 6 I
[46:53] will read Romans chapter 6 first and and
[46:57] then I will read chapter
[47:06] 7
[47:08] Romans chapter 6 from verse 1 to
[47:15] 4 what shall we say then shall we
[47:19] continue in saying that Grace May
[47:23] abound God forbid how shall we that we
[47:28] that are dead to sin live any longer
[47:31] daring
[47:33] God know ye not that so many of us as
[47:38] were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[47:41] baptized into his
[47:43] death therefore we are buried with him
[47:48] by baptism into death that like as
[47:52] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[47:55] the glory of the father even so we also
[48:00] should walk in newness of
[48:03] Life Romans
[48:10] 7 know ye not brethren for I speak to
[48:14] them that know the law how that the law
[48:17] had dominion over a man as long as he
[48:20] liveth for the woman which ha an husband
[48:23] is bound by the law to her husband
[48:27] so long as he liveth but if the husband
[48:31] be dead CH is losed from the law of her
[48:36] husband so then if why her husband
[48:40] leaveth she be married to another man
[48:44] she shall be called an
[48:46] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[48:49] she is free from that law so that she is
[48:53] no
[48:54] adulteress though she be married to
[48:57] another man wherefore my brethren you
[49:00] also have become dead to the law by the
[49:04] body of Christ that you should be
[49:06] married to another even to him who is
[49:11] raised from the dead that we should
[49:15] bring forth fruit unto God for when we
[49:18] were in the flesh theem motions of sins
[49:23] which were by the law did work in our
[49:27] members to bring forth fruit unto death
[49:30] but now we are delivered from the law
[49:35] that being dead wherein we were heard
[49:39] that we should serve in newness of
[49:41] spirit and not in the
[49:45] Hess of the letter and may the Lord
[49:48] bless the reading of his holy word amen
[49:51] God bless you may be seated
[50:05] in this morning we want to speak on the
[50:07] subject of
[50:09] uh responding to God's Saving
[50:13] Grace responding to God's Saving Grace
[50:17] amen uh this morning you know I think
[50:21] you know the Tabernacle the church at

[50:29] them amen but I think you know they are
[50:34] with us this morning and some people you

[51:15] responding you know to God's Saving

[51:25] it's much amen just like what Apostle
[51:28] Paul said you know over then the book of
[51:30] 2 Corinthians chapter 9:1 15 it said
[51:35] thanks be to God for his unspeakable
[51:38] gift amen so you know they are too many
[51:41] Hallelujah but we want to call our
[51:44] attention Amen to something you know
[51:46] that is very important and what is it
[51:49] Grace Hallelujah Grace amen you know uh
[51:53] the prophet of God told us you know the

[52:05] you know she washed she had an
[52:07] inspiration you know to get something
[52:09] done for the Lord and then you know she
[52:12] washed to save you know some some some
[52:15] some some money and then when she has
[52:17] saved those the the money then she
[52:20] invited the preacher to come and hold a
[52:23] meeting and then when the preacher came
[52:25] for the meeting
[52:27] then you know nobody came but God in his
[52:31] Divine Mercy has ordained that somebody
[52:33] will come to the meeting that you know
[52:36] the labor of this little woman will not
[52:39] be in vain and then you know what
[52:41] happened God you know inspired you know
[52:44] somebody an insignificant person amen
[52:48] you know but
[52:49] predestinated and ordained before the
[52:52] foundation of the world with a message
[52:55] you know to generation to his people
[52:59] remember that each day ends a generation
[53:02] today a generation is ending tomorrow a
[53:06] generation will end and every one of us
[53:09] we are messenger of this message
[53:12] Hallelujah therefore if we are
[53:15] messengers of this message then I can
[53:18] tell you my brothers and sisters in this
[53:20] morning that you have a message
[53:22] Hallelujah for you can never be a

[54:17] into the meeting then you know the
[54:19] preacher preached and this young Dwight
[54:23] Moody overed his life that day you know

[56:20] hallelujah for a s safe is worth more
[56:24] than 10,000 word
[56:27] Glory Hallelujah can't you see brothers
[56:30] and sisters you know that I'm sorry but
[56:33] I want to say this not to bring down
[56:35] anybody the president of the best world

[57:08] word is amazing yes it what a great

[57:29] day dght Moody was you know right there
[57:33] in his office and was studying the word
[57:35] of God Amen and then you know he came
[57:38] you know to the Book of Romans chapter 7
[57:41] and when he read the book of Romans
[57:43] chapter 7 you know what an inspiration
[57:46] you know it was to Young Moody amen he
[57:49] read it and he saw what Apostle Paul
[57:52] said how we were separated Glory amen we
[57:57] were separated amen from law amen onto
[58:02] grace through the death of our Lord
[58:04] Jesus Christ how you know we became
[58:08] separated you know from our former
[58:11] husband Hallelujah and then you know we
[58:14] were married you know to the new husband
[58:17] actually not a separation you know but
[58:19] it's a separation also because death
[58:22] means separation and the death is a
[58:25] total separation ation and the year
[58:27] Apostle Paul was
[58:29] showing how you know that we become you
[58:34] know separated by death amen you know
[58:37] from The Works of the flesh from the
[58:39] things of the world from the things that
[58:42] once rule over us you know onto the
[58:45] other side amen God in his infinite
[58:48] grace and mercy called you and high out
[58:52] of the world and then you know in death
[58:56] with our former husband our first
[58:59] husband God dealt with it by death
[59:03] Hallelujah God killed it at the cross
[59:08] Hallelujah he bruised the head of the
[59:10] serpent at the cross Hallelujah he
[59:14] bruised the head of the serpent the root
[59:17] of sin God bruised it he killed it right
[59:21] there at the cross for the Bible said in
[59:23] the Book of Genesis chter 3:15 that
[59:26] shall bruised Hallelujah the head of The
[59:30] Serpent and the serpent will bruise his
[59:32] ear that's the reason why you know the
[59:35] devil you know he cannot kill Christ and
[59:39] make him to remain in the grave Jesus

[1:28:04] Jesus Christ said you don't have it and
[1:28:06] the Bible says he is the high priest of
[1:28:09] our prion Hebrews chapter 3:1 that is to
[1:28:12] say whatsoever you profess that's what
[1:28:15] he will confess before God in heaven
[1:28:18] that he has done for you and but Abraham

[1:28:47] God bless you you love him this morning
[1:28:50] you believe his word this is nothing
[1:28:54] but the truth and the friends if that is
[1:28:58] the truth then we should lay our
[1:29:03] life
[1:29:05] down to God and serve him with our whole
[1:29:10] heart we should move away from the
[1:29:12] things of the world we should move
[1:29:15] closer to God and save him all the Days
[1:29:20] of Our
[1:29:22] Lives the prophet used this
[1:29:25] illustration he
[1:29:27] said it's like husband and wife he said
[1:29:33] that was what Apostle Paul was saying
[1:29:35] here in
[1:29:37] Romans he said the law has
[1:29:41] power over a woman in as long as a
[1:29:47] husband
[1:29:50] live but if a husband be dead
[1:29:56] dead she's
[1:29:58] free to
[1:30:02] remarry but if she goes and
[1:30:06] marry why her husband is still living
[1:30:10] she will be called an adulterous
[1:30:14] woman that's the
[1:30:17] Bible but if her husband be
[1:30:21] dead she's no longer under the
[1:30:25] law of a
[1:30:28] husband she can be married to another
[1:30:32] man and that

[1:31:11] everything it's because of the first
[1:31:14] husband which is adamic nature yes
[1:31:18] that's
[1:31:19] it but
[1:31:22] if you come to the
[1:31:25] cross of Jesus
[1:31:28] Christ and you
[1:31:30] accepted the forar suffering of
[1:31:33] Christ and all those that He took and

[1:40:16] lay in the presence of the son we sung

[1:40:21] of God you die out out to your will so
[1:40:25] he can become more of our husband it's
[1:40:27] not just a claiming God is our husband
[1:40:31] but our life has to die out to the old
[1:40:33] nature glory and then his nature lives
[1:40:37] inside and we do what our brother just
[1:40:39] said we go out we win souls we live for
[1:40:41] him we we start manifesting more of the
