[28:52] we have a
[28:54] all of us are precious in the sight of
[28:56] the lord
[28:58] and uh
[29:00] all of us are equally precious
[29:03] uh but i wanted to say that before i
[29:06] said this we have a precious sister in
[29:08] our midst
[29:10] who
[29:11] we've
[29:12] have uh desired to just share
[29:16] a little bit uh about her to testify of
[29:19] the lord and she's been coming now for
[29:23] oh a number of months i don't know do
[29:25] you know how long it's been about four
[29:28] months
[29:29] well uh she is one of those persons
[29:32] one of those sisters
[29:34] that she didn't have to come
[29:36] more than once to know who she really
[29:39] was if i could say that
[29:42] and uh she has been a true blessing
[29:45] to our family and to the support of of
[29:48] the church
[29:50] and um
[29:52] so we had we'd made
[29:54] mention about her sometime in the future
[29:57] sharing a little something for the lord
[30:00] and uh
[30:01] and so this morning we wanted her to
[30:03] just have liberty and
[30:05] and and share whatever is on her heart
[30:06] we don't know but we just want to say we
[30:08] appreciate our sister lynn and her love
[30:11] for jesus christ
[30:13] amen god bless you
[30:17] good morning saints oh
[30:18] amen good morning i'm like sister shirl
[30:20] i don't like being up here back here but
[30:24] um
[30:25] but i just want to thank pastor john for
[30:27] welcoming me into the family amen and
[30:29] brother branham always said that you
[30:31] could know about
[30:33] the congregation because they take on
[30:35] the spirit of the pastor
[30:37] and the pastor has a compassion for the
[30:40] people
[30:40] and i notice that in the people they
[30:42] have compassion for one another
[30:45] and that carries a lot with me because
[30:48] um
[30:49] i wouldn't be here if god didn't let me
[30:51] to be here
[30:52] so i gotta hurry up because i i love the
[30:54] word so i'm not gonna talk that much
[30:57] because i've been serving the law for 31
[30:59] years
[31:00] i've been in a message for 24. but that
[31:03] word being a message to me that message
[31:05] is christ
[31:06] it's not a tape it's not a book it's a
[31:08] person and that's christ himself
[31:10] so but i do owe you an explanation how i
[31:12] end up on your doorstep so if you just
[31:15] give me a few minutes and
[31:16] i just want to rush through it a little
[31:18] bit but i was been
[31:20] thinking about that it'd been a year i
[31:23] keep hearing testifying testify
[31:25] and i do
[31:26] on one-on-one but not as a whole because
[31:29] i'm not comfortable in that but
[31:31] god gets you out your comfort zone you
[31:33] know and the lord knows i'll do anything
[31:35] for it i've got to that point that it
[31:37] doesn't matter anymore with me whatever
[31:39] lord says do i'll do
[31:41] but
[31:42] i said i didn't want to do a lot of say
[31:44] a lot of things but
[31:46] my conversion the lord says are you
[31:48] ashamed of me
[31:50] and i think a lot of times people don't
[31:52] see christ because we don't
[31:54] express him
[31:56] through us what he has done we want to
[31:58] say what he will do but what has he done
[32:00] for us
[32:01] and the main thing for me that god saved
[32:03] my soul
[32:05] and um
[32:06] he knows you from the beginning
[32:08] and
[32:10] even when before i was born my mother
[32:12] was carrying me and she and my father
[32:15] and my two siblings walking downtown and
[32:16] a woman came up to her and says you got
[32:18] a blessed event
[32:21] and she says it's a girl
[32:23] and she says name her linda
[32:26] so my mother turned around and she said
[32:28] james that's my father you hear what
[32:30] this older lady said he says what lady i
[32:32] didn't hear anything
[32:33] and when he looked around she was way
[32:34] down the way he said she says i'm having
[32:36] a girl and call her linda
[32:38] he says well there's nobody in my family
[32:39] named linda but i'm linda so my mother
[32:41] followed that because god even knows you
[32:44] before that but you know and so
[32:47] through it all we was raised in a
[32:49] pentecostal when we was young my mother
[32:51] took us out and put us in the baptist
[32:53] church and i'm like i was young i said
[32:56] but we're going backwards
[32:57] even then i knew from pentecost to to
[33:00] baptist we kind of like going backwards
[33:02] but god knew all things he knew all
[33:05] things so i was raised whereas that you
[33:08] accept jesus christ shake that hand
[33:10] you're saved
[33:12] now getting to church and work
[33:14] that's how i was raised
[33:15] so i was in the church doing what i want
[33:18] to do go to church
[33:20] and
[33:21] go back and live the life of a center
[33:23] because i knew no better
[33:25] but one day
[33:27] i was looking around in my room and i'm
[33:29] saying i have no need of nothing decent
[33:31] job nice car
[33:33] people friends all of that i'm looking
[33:35] around all this stuff i had accumulated
[33:36] i didn't need
[33:38] and all of a sudden something hit me and
[33:40] it says you need salvation
[33:44] and i just dropped on my knees
[33:46] and i prayed
[33:48] and when i prayed on my knees when i
[33:51] came to myself
[33:53] i heard this wind
[33:55] now granted i'm ashamed to say i never
[33:57] read my bible i did not read my bible
[33:59] i'm in the baptist church i listen to
[34:00] the preacher go back home and just do my
[34:02] thing i didn't read the bible
[34:04] but when i got off my when i when i got
[34:06] up i looked and i said man it sure is
[34:09] windy out
[34:10] and i had a picture window when i looked
[34:12] out the window there's a big tree by my
[34:14] window now one leaf was moving
[34:18] but i heard it
[34:20] when i got up i was so happy
[34:23] i said i'm saved i knew there was a
[34:25] change in my life
[34:27] and it happened on a friday
[34:30] friday and i said i'm saved but i can't
[34:33] tell nobody
[34:34] i said i can't tell nobody and i went to
[34:37] work and i'm all giddy and just all just
[34:40] but i said i can't tell nobody
[34:42] but that weekend i couldn't hold it that
[34:44] monday i started telling it and i had a
[34:46] in my bro plant i worked there there was
[34:48] a lot of ministers and bishops and
[34:50] and deacons and that type of stuff and
[34:54] i came to one young man he was apostolic
[34:56] i said i'm saved i'm saved
[34:59] he says you got the holy ghost
[35:02] i said
[35:03] you know it was the holy ghost
[35:06] there i go back on my knees again
[35:10] and all of a sudden when i was praying i
[35:12] said lord i don't even know what i'm
[35:13] praying for but i'm not getting off my
[35:15] knees until you give it to me
[35:18] and all of a sudden
[35:19] baptized in the holy ghost and fired
[35:21] thank you lord and then all of a sudden
[35:23] i heard this talking i said who was that
[35:27] talking
[35:28] and it was a language that i never heard
[35:30] of before
[35:32] when i found out it was me
[35:34] and when brother branham says that the
[35:35] new birth is a messy experience yes it
[35:37] is
[35:38] because that fire will burn you when i
[35:40] got done i was glad i had a leather
[35:42] couch because it was a mess
[35:45] and i said thank you lord thank you lord
[35:48] but to make a long story short now
[35:51] and in my church they knew there was
[35:52] something different but they did not
[35:54] know what
[35:56] and i had all these questions and i'm
[35:58] just just running just running just
[36:00] running like i get the bible now i got
[36:02] my bible i'm just reading reading
[36:04] reading i have all these questions and
[36:06] i'm asking the pastor these questions
[36:08] and he's looking at me like what's wrong
[36:10] with you
[36:11] you know so and i found out that
[36:14] sometimes when when you can understand
[36:16] how
[36:17] how paul did when he was persecuting the
[36:19] church because of what he had believed
[36:21] but now there is something different
[36:23] it's a heresy to them that spirit is
[36:25] still alive today
[36:27] it is still alive today but all this
[36:29] time you know i'm just seeking the lord
[36:31] to seek the lord but i knew that it was
[36:32] something more
[36:34] it was something more and it took seven
[36:36] years
[36:38] to finally i got to a place where my job
[36:40] was transferred
[36:42] and you know the lord started wrath my
[36:44] conversion though i start having visions
[36:46] and dreams and
[36:47] manifestations i won't go on to that but
[36:49] i knew that there was something going on
[36:52] and i didn't understand that there was
[36:53] visions at the time because i did not
[36:55] know
[36:56] and so when i got to the place where my
[36:58] job transfer me and my bloody mouth i
[37:01] started talking about what the lord had
[37:03] done and one the minister said to me he
[37:05] says
[37:06] you're a witch
[37:08] and i said no i'm not a witch but i just
[37:11] thought a lot of christians went through
[37:13] this type of thing what the lord was
[37:14] doing so
[37:16] he went on and then about a week later i
[37:18] saw him he had red eyes because he had
[37:20] looked like he had been crying
[37:22] and he said and i knew then the lord had
[37:24] got a hold to him
[37:26] so he says i want you to read something
[37:28] so he gave me a book
[37:30] he says i said okay i'll read it
[37:33] it's something about friday was on a
[37:34] friday and i went home and i started
[37:37] reading a book and i do believe it was a
[37:38] spoken the spoken word is the original
[37:40] seed i believe that was the book
[37:43] and so um i read it
[37:45] and i said okay because the first thing
[37:47] i started looking at women should not
[37:49] wear pants and and this type of thing
[37:50] i'm like oh okay
[37:52] so i gave it back to him that monday he
[37:54] said how you like it i said it's okay
[37:56] it's okay he said no read it again
[37:59] i said okay
[38:01] i'll read it again
[38:03] so i took it back
[38:04] and i started reading it and i just
[38:06] started crying
[38:08] and everything that the prophet was
[38:10] saying
[38:11] i was saying amen
[38:12] amen amen that's what was missing
[38:16] was that we know his brother john
[38:18] preached that justification lead to
[38:20] sanctification say if occasionally the
[38:21] baptism on holy ghost holy ghost leads
[38:23] to the way of christ himself that's
[38:25] where i was in between before i got the
[38:27] message and when i got that i said there
[38:28] it is
[38:29] there it is right there
[38:31] and so
[38:33] i was like a fanatic because my sister i
[38:35] was like i need more i need more and i
[38:38] had her going on computer just
[38:39] downloading stuff she said i can't be
[38:40] downloading all this stuff i'm not
[38:42] supposed to be online like that and it
[38:44] was like i was just hungry for more and
[38:46] more and more and so by that time
[38:50] i was still in the baptist church and i
[38:51] stayed there for almost 17 years
[38:54] and when you
[38:55] have come to a way and they don't
[38:57] understand that there's a lot of
[38:59] friction
[39:00] you caught it's a lot of problems
[39:03] but you know then i got to that point
[39:05] where um
[39:07] i
[39:08] i didn't know there was anybody else
[39:09] live that was in the message because i
[39:11] told my oldest sister where is everybody
[39:14] but that's the way the lord was leading
[39:15] me and so for years we didn't even know
[39:18] anybody else was alive that knew the
[39:19] message and i was always online just
[39:22] grabbing whatever i could you know and
[39:25] so then it finally came up to that point
[39:26] to where is that we found a church that
[39:28] was having a meeting in indiana
[39:31] and my sister don't never do anything
[39:34] without seeking the lord
[39:35] no matter what it is
[39:37] seek the lord first
[39:39] because the lord allowed me to actually
[39:41] see
[39:42] where the two spirits would be so close
[39:45] to they were full of very elect if
[39:47] possible
[39:48] but god would not leave his bride and
[39:50] error never
[39:52] never so i ran into that so i said i
[39:56] told my older sister well and at that
[39:58] time i had left the baptist church i
[40:00] decided not to go back
[40:02] so i was out for 13 years
[40:04] just the message just a word
[40:07] god dealing with me and just still
[40:09] holding on to what i believe
[40:11] till one day when i got on the internet
[40:13] i found out
[40:14] there's some churches that's actually a
[40:16] lie
[40:17] so i got in i got into that and here
[40:20] come the fivefold ministry that is so
[40:23] important and i thank brother john for
[40:24] having a fivefold come to this church
[40:26] because that's the provided way of god
[40:29] and that when i got a hold to that it
[40:31] start
[40:32] everything that was in my life the
[40:34] visions and all that start coming
[40:35] together
[40:36] and like pastor john said you should see
[40:38] yourself in the bible
[40:40] you should see yourself in the bible and
[40:42] all that started coming together where i
[40:44] saw myself from genesis to revelation
[40:47] the whole time
[40:48] and so then i got to a point where that
[40:51] lord i'm tired
[40:52] i'm tired of the virtual thing i gotta
[40:54] go i gotta get i've always been in
[40:56] fellowship with the church always
[40:59] and so
[41:00] i'd have started to see because in ohio
[41:02] i don't wanna speak his name because
[41:04] maybe he don't want me to know but i
[41:06] started listening to him and through him
[41:08] i was able to get through a lot of other
[41:10] ones
[41:11] but then i said i'm gonna go
[41:14] and then the pandemic hit
[41:16] so i had to sit back down god wasn't
[41:18] ready yet
[41:19] so okay i said back out but then i
[41:22] opened up even more because i'm i'm like
[41:24] a sponge when it comes to teaching of
[41:26] the word i love it and so
[41:29] after the pandemic i told my sister i
[41:31] started crying i said i'm tired
[41:34] i said nobody wants to talk about god i
[41:36] said i'm tired
[41:38] and she says lynn i'll take you there
[41:40] and so i said okay the lord says no
[41:43] can't go not that there was anything
[41:45] wrong with that church
[41:47] but it wasn't my place
[41:49] so
[41:50] i didn't but then i got so
[41:53] chopped i guess i was getting ahead of
[41:54] god because i was so hungering to get
[41:56] back in fellowship because see i've
[41:58] always paid my tithes why i was a sinner
[42:01] paying tithes
[42:03] i believe in paying tithes and offering
[42:05] and so i said
[42:08] at least i can just give my my money to
[42:10] somebody so they can help the kingdom of
[42:12] god so i wrote this pastor
[42:14] and so he told me he says we don't do
[42:17] that you got to be under a fellowship of
[42:19] someone for to pay ties with he says but
[42:21] i'm going to search and see if there's
[42:23] someone in your area where you can go to
[42:26] so i got ahead of myself again because
[42:28] i'm sitting there and tasha said lynn
[42:31] there's a church in um ann arbor
[42:34] was that bible tabernacle i do believe
[42:36] so we went there they had moved
[42:39] i was disappointed again
[42:41] so i went back home i said lord i give
[42:43] up
[42:44] i'm tired of trying i'm tired i said
[42:47] you'll tell me where to go and so then
[42:49] three days later here come a card and it
[42:51] says
[42:53] i found two churches around you bible
[42:55] tabernacle and send the light church
[42:58] cinderlight church never popped up
[42:59] anywhere on the website when we was
[43:01] looking what tash was looking did not
[43:03] pop up
[43:05] i said i'm there
[43:06] i'm there and at that time the devil
[43:08] fought me tooth and nail because he hit
[43:11] tasha left and right she was sick in the
[43:13] hospital just about dying and but he was
[43:16] trying his best because you got to know
[43:17] the enemy the lord has taught me well
[43:19] you got to know that enemy
[43:21] and i told the lord no matter if she's
[43:23] in the hospital not i'm going to the
[43:24] church i'm going so
[43:27] he told me he said well you wanted to
[43:28] come home or stay i said bring it home
[43:30] because tasha is not a very good patient
[43:32] you know i have to be there for so i
[43:34] said bring her
[43:35] bring her home so that i told her she
[43:37] says you going i said i'm going i'm
[43:40] going and so precious jonathan
[43:44] he met me at the door and he says hi how
[43:47] are you
[43:48] i said i'm fine he said who you with i
[43:49] said nobody
[43:51] he said well okay then i'll just show
[43:53] you around that blessed my heart so
[43:55] cause he made me feel so good and when i
[43:57] got here i knew i was supposed to be
[44:00] here
[44:01] and so tasha when i got home she said
[44:02] how was it i said i found home
[44:05] i found home so i thank god that he
[44:07] allowed me to come here but he would not
[44:09] let me go anywhere for 13 years because
[44:12] he have me a place to go
[44:14] when you wait on god you'll never be
[44:15] disappointed you have to wait on god and
[44:18] seek him for everything thank you pastor
[44:20] john

[44:35] same yesterday today and forever god is

[44:49] encouraged to see god more in our life
[44:51] from their the testimony that we heard

[48:05] verse number 5
[48:10] and every plant of the field before was
[48:12] in the earth and every herb of the field
[48:15] before it grew for the lord god had not
[48:18] caused it to rain upon the earth and
[48:20] there was not a man
[48:23] to till the ground
[48:25] but there went up in the midst of the
[48:27] earth and watered the whole face of the
[48:29] ground and the lord god
[48:31] and the lord god formed man
[48:34] of the dust of the ground and breathe in
[48:36] his nostrils the breath of life and man
[48:38] became a living soul and the lord god
[48:41] planted a garden eastward
[48:44] in eden and there he put the man whom he
[48:47] had formed amen jumping to verse 15 and
[48:50] the lord god took the man and put him in
[48:52] the garden of eden to dress it and to
[48:54] keep it and the lord god commanded the
[48:57] man saying of every tree of the god thou
[48:59] mayest free to eat but of the tree of
[49:00] the knowledge of good and evil thou
[49:02] shall not eat of it for in the day that
[49:04] thou eat us thereof thou shall surely
[49:07] die amen god bless you you may be seated
[49:14] in
[49:14] our
[49:16] taking
[49:17] um
[49:18] some thoughts honestly
[49:20] that were
[49:22] uh
[49:23] come from
[49:25] a sentence or two that our brother
[49:27] jonathan had
[49:28] mentioned in our men's meeting
[49:30] about
[49:33] us
[49:34] getting
[49:36] to know more who we are
[49:38] in christ
[49:43] just feeling that desire for all of us
[49:45] to know our our place and who we are and
[49:48] our purpose and and and and to to get us
[49:52] on on a track of moving forward with the
[49:54] lord it had been behind this and we
[49:58] begin to study
[50:00] and
[50:01] um
[50:05] and i think
[50:06] for us to know who we really are we need
[50:09] to
[50:10] we need to know
[50:11] who
[50:12] who adam was the first man
[50:15] that god created because we're we're
[50:17] going back to that image right
[50:20] and so we want to entire this message
[50:21] making man in god's image and if it
[50:24] would be the will of the lord we want to
[50:26] have this service as a foundational
[50:29] service for a
[50:31] a mini-series
[50:33] on how to get back to the image of god
[50:35] because our opening scripture god said
[50:38] let us make man a human being in our
[50:42] image and after our likeness
[50:46] god
[50:47] has had
[50:48] to deal with man not wanting to be in
[50:51] his
[50:52] image for many years
[50:58] sixteen or seventeen hundred years after
[51:00] god had had made man in genesis chapter
[51:03] five and god saw that the wickedness of
[51:05] man was great and you're probably not
[51:07] going to see as many scriptures on the
[51:09] board we're just trying to change things
[51:12] up here a little bit
[51:14] but god saw that the wickedness of man
[51:16] was great in the earth and that the
[51:18] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[51:20] heart was only evil continually
[51:24] now look here it says and god repented
[51:27] and it repented the lord that he had
[51:29] made man
[51:31] on the earth and it grieved him at his
[51:33] heart and the lord god said i will
[51:35] destroy man whom i've created
[51:38] from the face of the earth both man and
[51:41] beast and creeping thing in the files of
[51:42] the air and for it repented me
[51:45] that i made them
[51:49] now that word repented means proper uh
[51:52] properly to sigh that is to breathe
[51:54] strongly by implication to be sorry
[51:57] uh uh in a favorable sense to pity
[52:00] console to rule to avenge to comfort to
[52:04] ease one's self he was obviously looking
[52:08] at the condition of man and saying this
[52:12] is not
[52:13] what i created adam to be
[52:16] there was a total difference in mankind
[52:19] from the original creation when he
[52:21] created adam in his own image
[52:24] god had to be
[52:26] considering
[52:28] what has happened to man well we know
[52:31] man became perverted he began to
[52:33] literally do his own will and that's
[52:35] simply what it is when you do your own
[52:37] will
[52:38] it's perverted
[52:40] you god's will is the only will that's
[52:43] right
[52:46] god wanted to destroy sodom for its
[52:48] wickedness
[52:50] and and abraham interceded with the lord
[52:54] and that bird of course we know it was
[52:55] christ in in
[52:57] abraham he says will thou destroy the
[52:59] righteous with the wicked
[53:02] but god's desire was to destroy sodom
[53:05] because they were doing their will so
[53:07] much
[53:08] yeah now we can say oh yeah was it
[53:11] really that or was it because of they
[53:13] were sodomites and they were you know
[53:15] they were gay
[53:19] when you do your own will it's i don't
[53:23] care how mild it seems
[53:25] it's just as evil as that thing turning
[53:28] to a corrupt perverseness
[53:32] it's either god's will or our will
[53:35] and if we do our will long enough man
[53:38] will destroy himself
[53:42] but we don't want to belittle
[53:45] the fact that our will is okay as long
[53:48] as it's not really causing harm or
[53:50] danger to anybody right
[53:52] god created us for the purpose of
[53:55] serving him
[53:57] following his will and carrying out what
[53:59] he wants us to do that was the image in
[54:02] which he created man to begin with
[54:08] god destroyed the armies of egypt simply
[54:12] because they wouldn't submit to god
[54:14] if if pharaoh would have just said okay
[54:16] you want your people to go go ahead
[54:20] egypt probably wouldn't have got
[54:22] bombed probably wouldn't have drowned
[54:26] but he he had a purpose to show his
[54:29] glory
[54:30] in his ability to destroy a nation
[54:33] but it was all because they i mean there
[54:35] were so many other people on the planet
[54:37] that weren't obeying god's will but he
[54:39] let him let him go
[54:42] and so here he is he saves his people
[54:45] out of the land of egypt
[54:47] destroys the egyptians
[54:49] and then afterwards destroys his own
[54:52] people because they were unwilling to do
[54:55] the will of god
[54:58] think about how important it is
[55:01] if you want to be in the image of god
[55:03] you need to be so
[55:04] interested and concerned about the will
[55:07] of god in every aspect of your life not
[55:09] just going to a message church not just
[55:12] saying you believe the bible not just
[55:14] being baptized but you're interested in
[55:16] the will of god in every aspect of your
[55:18] life
[55:20] because that is the image of god
[55:35] we know that god is going to destroy man
[55:37] again
[55:40] he's going to destroy the earth he's
[55:41] going to
[55:42] burn it the bible says it's going to
[55:44] burn with fire
[55:46] because of man's wickedness because of
[55:48] his sin and and because he's
[55:51] manifesting the image of a beast
[55:57] which is the opposite of god's will
[56:00] right you've got you've got the image of
[56:02] christ and you've got the image of the
[56:03] beast there is no in between there's no
[56:06] switzerland in the deal
[56:08] and
[56:11] we are reflecting one or two images
[56:14] right man is reflecting one or two
[56:15] images
[56:17] like if i go up to brother mark and i'm
[56:19] not not happy i'm gonna hit him in the
[56:20] face i don't put him in a headlock i'm
[56:22] gonna calm every name in the book that
[56:24] is not the image of christ that i'm
[56:26] displaying right now
[56:29] get angry talk behind his back
[56:32] lie
[56:33] it's not the image of christ
[56:36] that is the image of the beast
[56:39] that is the we live in in such a
[56:42] terrible world don't we we we see the
[56:45] image of satan all over the place
[56:49] don't get too quiet on me if it's true
[56:51] say amen get into the word
[56:56] well about 4
[56:58] 500 years or so had passed after the
[57:00] flood
[57:01] and here we are living
[57:03] in a world that's
[57:06] increasing or ever involving in
[57:09] wickedness
[57:11] insanity
[57:14] to such a degree
[57:16] that the world has never experienced
[57:18] before they don't even know who they are
[57:21] the world don't know who they are humans
[57:25] have lost their respect one for another
[57:29] think about it how intelligent and smart
[57:31] they are but yet they've lost their
[57:33] respect for one another
[57:36] and the world is in one crisis after
[57:39] another
[57:41] and one of the major crisis in humanity
[57:45] is that they've lost their identity
[57:49] they don't even know the reason they
[57:51] were created they don't know the purpose
[57:53] they were created
[57:56] they don't even know what they're
[57:57] supposed to do or how they're supposed
[57:59] to act so they just do whatever they
[58:02] feel to do
[58:06] the world is evolving more and more and
[58:08] to identify crisis and that
[58:11] identity crisis means a period of
[58:15] uncertainty
[58:16] and confusion in which a person's sense
[58:19] of identity becomes insecure
[58:23] typically due to a change in their
[58:26] expected aims
[58:28] or a role in society
[58:32] now if that is not the description of
[58:34] the world i don't know what is
[58:38] men are confused
[58:40] men are confused about their gender
[58:43] they don't know if they're male or
[58:45] they're female
[58:46] women don't know their role in society
[58:49] children are increasingly becoming more
[58:52] insecure
[58:53] about who they really are
[58:57] there's such a strong evil spirit that's
[59:00] pushing a perversion into the world
[59:03] through the movies through music through
[59:06] electronics and the internet
[59:09] and instead of people using it to become
[59:12] more healthier they get a hold of people
[59:15] who are more perverted than them than
[59:16] they get perverted
[59:19] doctors are not allowed to put on birth
[59:21] certificates what gender babies are
[59:23] anymore what in the world is happening
[59:28] even doctors are being forced to
[59:29] question their
[59:31] expected aims or their role in society
[59:36] instead of children
[59:38] accepting the fact who they are
[59:41] i i mean i didn't there was like no
[59:43] question in my family what i was
[59:47] they're given a choice in life what they
[59:49] want to be now
[59:51] despite
[59:53] who they are
[59:55] you can choose your gender you can
[59:57] choose what spirit you have or who you
[1:00:00] want to be with or what bathroom you
[1:00:02] want to use
[1:00:04] the world has totally gone insane
[1:00:08] they don't know
[1:00:09] who they are
[1:00:14] we know it's just another ploy of the
[1:00:16] devil amen
[1:00:18] towards god's own creation
[1:00:21] perverting the creation of god just like
[1:00:24] it was in the days of noah the days of
[1:00:26] lot
[1:00:29] men have lost
[1:00:31] their expected roles
[1:00:34] they're
[1:00:36] they're
[1:00:36] what they're supposed to be in life and
[1:00:39] they just begin to do more and more and
[1:00:42] more and more what they want to do
[1:00:45] and it's getting further away from god
[1:00:49] and that's why it's important
[1:00:51] that your interest in doing god's will
[1:00:54] all the time needs to become very high
[1:00:57] on your priority list
[1:01:00] this this mindset that satan gives us
[1:01:03] that well all we got to do is is go to
[1:01:05] church on on sundays and and and do this
[1:01:09] or do that we're okay and kind of
[1:01:11] everything else is up to you
[1:01:14] but the bible says that we're not to be
[1:01:16] conformed to this world but be
[1:01:18] transformed by the renewing of our minds
[1:01:20] that we may prove what is that good and
[1:01:22] acceptable and perfect will of god for
[1:01:23] our lives every day we have an
[1:01:25] opportunity
[1:01:26] no matter who we're talking to
[1:01:28] no matter what we're doing
[1:01:31] to do the will of god
[1:01:33] or to do our own will it's true amen
[1:01:39] when god created man and woman in the
[1:01:41] beginning there was no confusion about
[1:01:43] it
[1:01:45] there was no confusion the confusion
[1:01:47] came in is when satan came into their
[1:01:51] lives
[1:01:53] and got them to question
[1:01:57] confused about who they were
[1:02:00] who was really in control
[1:02:02] was it god or or
[1:02:04] or
[1:02:06] you could be in control
[1:02:09] that's what he told eve
[1:02:11] you can decide
[1:02:13] what you would like the outcome to be
[1:02:18] amen god knows you're gonna you're gonna
[1:02:20] be just like him knowing good and evil
[1:02:23] don't you want to be in a place brother
[1:02:25] brandon taught us that she lusted for
[1:02:27] knowledge
[1:02:29] but it wasn't the right knowledge it
[1:02:31] wasn't the knowledge of how i can please
[1:02:33] god more
[1:02:35] it wasn't that knowledge
[1:02:37] it was a knowledge in order to where she
[1:02:40] could exercise her own will
[1:02:43] instead of gods
[1:02:48] nobody wants to rely
[1:02:50] on
[1:02:52] somebody else
[1:02:53] i mean that's the fleshly nature
[1:02:56] so this was appealing
[1:03:00] satan he just wants to pervert god's
[1:03:02] creation
[1:03:04] this morning we purpose to to lay a
[1:03:06] foundational message about our roots
[1:03:09] who our creator is and who we are
[1:03:12] both of which satan has confused the
[1:03:14] world with
[1:03:16] and then i'd like to build off of this
[1:03:18] message and get back
[1:03:21] to the image in which we're supposed to
[1:03:24] be
[1:03:25] we know that this book called the bible
[1:03:28] it's the only book
[1:03:33] that describes
[1:03:35] who god is and who the image of god is
[1:03:39] and who we are
[1:03:43] it's the only book that could really
[1:03:44] tell us our roots where we came from
[1:03:47] amen
[1:03:48] we know we were in the mind of god adam
[1:03:50] was in the mind of god before
[1:03:53] he created before god created him and
[1:03:55] that goes way way back
[1:04:05] but the scriptures are the only thing in
[1:04:07] which you and i
[1:04:09] can rally behind
[1:04:11] and know
[1:04:12] what really the image of god really is
[1:04:17] and what we're supposed to be our sister
[1:04:19] when she was testifying today made
[1:04:21] mention
[1:04:22] of a number of different churches and i
[1:04:24] remember when i was hunting for a church
[1:04:27] before god led to the message i'll tell
[1:04:28] you if there's a strong hunger in a
[1:04:30] man's heart for the truth god will lead
[1:04:32] him to this message
[1:04:35] there's just no doubt in my mind about
[1:04:37] it
[1:04:40] but there's a lot of different ideas out
[1:04:42] there
[1:04:45] we just want the truth
[1:04:49] the scriptures help us
[1:04:51] interpret the scriptures
[1:04:55] brother branham says
[1:04:57] that
[1:04:58] our ideas or how we view things about a
[1:05:01] scripture about ideal in the word it
[1:05:04] must dovetail from genesis to
[1:05:06] revelations that can't contradict
[1:05:07] anything
[1:05:09] if it does then we have to step back and
[1:05:11] say i think i have to i have to conclude
[1:05:16] that i'm wrong
[1:05:18] something's not right we can't cross any
[1:05:20] scriptures we need the scriptures
[1:05:24] they
[1:05:25] interpret
[1:05:27] they help interpret the word going back
[1:05:29] in the beginning before anything ever
[1:05:31] was the the scripture tells us in john 1
[1:05:34] 1 that in the beginning was the word the
[1:05:35] word was with god the word was god
[1:05:38] and verse 2 the same was in the
[1:05:40] beginning with
[1:05:42] god the word we don't have anything else
[1:05:45] besides this word
[1:05:47] we we don't even want man's opinion
[1:05:49] about the word amen
[1:05:52] and i tell you i say this if i didn't
[1:05:54] know william branham was a prophet his
[1:05:57] opinion about the word would mean just
[1:05:59] as much as everybody else's opinion to
[1:06:01] me about the word but because i know he
[1:06:04] was god said because i know god revealed
[1:06:07] to me who he was then i can have
[1:06:10] confidence i'll do nothing except i
[1:06:12] reveal with my secrets unto
[1:06:14] his servants the prophets
[1:06:16] we can have confidence that's why we
[1:06:18] ought to be spending time digging into
[1:06:21] the message and not waiting for it to be
[1:06:23] preached to us
[1:06:26] dig in the message you've got 24 hours a
[1:06:28] day you've got seven days a week find
[1:06:31] time to seek the image of god you will
[1:06:34] find it in that message
[1:06:38] that's what god sent a prophet for he
[1:06:40] did not send a prophet so
[1:06:43] it could just go to the people's ears
[1:06:46] make sure you go to a church
[1:06:48] that believes that god sent a prophet
[1:06:50] that is not the reason he sent a prophet
[1:06:52] it is not good enough to just believe
[1:06:54] god sent a prophet we've got to get into
[1:06:56] the message and get the message that god
[1:06:59] sent through to us through that prophet
[1:07:02] that's right amen
[1:07:05] we can't depend on one fold ministry
[1:07:08] twofold three four or fourfold
[1:07:11] or whoever comes to the church
[1:07:13] we need the fivefold
[1:07:16] all of it jesus said in john 5 39 he
[1:07:19] said search
[1:07:21] the scriptures
[1:07:23] for in them you think
[1:07:26] you think you have eternal life how many
[1:07:28] people have you talked to that think
[1:07:31] they have eternal life
[1:07:33] he says
[1:07:34] but the scriptures they are they
[1:07:37] which testify of me the scriptures are
[1:07:40] what testify of who jesus is brother
[1:07:44] branham said that if you can't find
[1:07:45] jesus christ in every scripture go back
[1:07:48] and read it
[1:07:49] we need this to know the image of god
[1:07:53] he brother adam also said if you want to
[1:07:55] know the image of god you want to know
[1:07:56] who god is look in the face of jesus
[1:07:58] christ look at jesus and you will know
[1:08:01] exactly the image of god
[1:08:04] the bible tells us i believe it's in
[1:08:06] colossians he is a he is in the in he is
[1:08:09] in the image of the invisible god
[1:08:13] all that was in god he poured into
[1:08:15] christ he is the image and he made man
[1:08:19] in his image
[1:08:21] that's why it's important for us to to
[1:08:23] focus on
[1:08:24] being in the image of god amen
[1:08:29] john
[1:08:30] first john chapter 5 verse 13 says first
[1:08:33] john chapter 5 verse 13 these things
[1:08:35] have i written unto you that
[1:08:37] believe
[1:08:39] on the name of the son of god
[1:08:42] that ye may know
[1:08:45] that you have eternal life
[1:08:48] and that ye may believe
[1:08:50] on the name
[1:08:51] of
[1:08:52] the son of god
[1:08:54] these things are written we have this
[1:08:56] bible so we can know whether or not we
[1:08:58] got eternal life
[1:09:01] not not question who we are
[1:09:05] if if we follow the word
[1:09:09] we're truly following god
[1:09:11] now if you're following part of the word
[1:09:13] you're doing exactly what eve did that's
[1:09:16] right amen
[1:09:19] brother brandon says she she followed
[1:09:21] 99.997
[1:09:26] of the word
[1:09:28] that's what he said
[1:09:30] we can't be interested in in following
[1:09:33] more the word than our neighbor
[1:09:37] than somebody else in church right
[1:09:39] we've got to follow all the word man
[1:09:41] shall not live by brethren but by every
[1:09:43] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:09:45] god
[1:09:48] our emphasis needs to be for our lives
[1:09:50] god help me to live all your word to
[1:09:54] seek all your will and not be content in
[1:09:58] this laodicean spirit all around us that
[1:10:01] attacks us through the media through the
[1:10:03] television through the radio through the
[1:10:05] billboards to the people we talk to with
[1:10:07] nonchalant spirits that doesn't matter
[1:10:09] what you do
[1:10:11] or that tries to
[1:10:12] puff you up because you're doing better
[1:10:15] than them that is just so antichrist
[1:10:19] we need to be interested in the part of
[1:10:21] the word that we're not following that's
[1:10:23] right
[1:10:24] because he's coming for a bride without
[1:10:26] spoderico and that should be our goal
[1:10:35] god's word can straighten up any
[1:10:37] confusion
[1:10:38] he can straighten up any marriage any
[1:10:41] relationship any any church any any any
[1:10:45] problem that then the human has this
[1:10:48] word can straighten it up
[1:10:50] this word is the absolute
[1:10:53] it is the final amen it has the answer
[1:10:56] to man's problems
[1:10:59] but for some reason man isn't interested
[1:11:02] in going home and open the book here's a
[1:11:05] sister testifying
[1:11:08] oh my i just love the testimony can
[1:11:11] glean so much from that testimony
[1:11:14] but here she is going to church going to
[1:11:16] church going to church
[1:11:18] working at the church working for the
[1:11:21] lord
[1:11:28] you don't want to be in that position
[1:11:33] what you're doing is you're following a
[1:11:36] man
[1:11:39] and it not that the man here or the men
[1:11:43] here
[1:11:44] would say anything to mislead you
[1:11:51] but the very fact that god sent you this
[1:11:55] word
[1:11:56] and you're too lazy to read it
[1:11:59] what are you telling him about your
[1:12:01] relationship with him
[1:12:04] this flesh is never going to want to
[1:12:06] read this
[1:12:08] like you would want to watch your
[1:12:09] favorite tv show
[1:12:11] you can't wait to see what happens you
[1:12:13] hope they come back and put another
[1:12:15] season on
[1:12:19] your your flesh doesn't love this word
[1:12:25] your flesh hates this word
[1:12:30] you love the word that's something
[1:12:32] deeper inside you
[1:12:34] that's the inner man
[1:12:37] that's the part of man that's attached
[1:12:40] to god
[1:12:41] that's where you came from that's where
[1:12:43] you're going
[1:12:45] but you're trapped in a body
[1:12:48] and if we don't follow these simple
[1:12:50] instructions that to deny yourself every
[1:12:53] day to pick up your cross
[1:12:56] you're not you're not going to ever be
[1:12:58] excited about reading the word unless
[1:13:01] you want to get some knowledge for
[1:13:03] somebody
[1:13:04] that'll puff you up
[1:13:06] knowledge puffs you up
[1:13:08] but i'll tell you if you're not wanting
[1:13:10] that word so you can know how to better
[1:13:12] please your master amen it's your
[1:13:14] motives god sees that
[1:13:17] we're just going to take our time with
[1:13:18] this if it's okay
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:22] genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said
[1:13:25] let us make man
[1:13:27] in our image
[1:13:29] and after
[1:13:30] our likeness let him have dominion
[1:13:34] over everything
[1:13:36] and so he created man in his own image
[1:13:38] verse 27 says and the image of god
[1:13:40] created him male and female
[1:13:43] so if we can identify god
[1:13:46] then we can know who we are because
[1:13:48] we're in the image of god
[1:13:51] and even though today we're not in the
[1:13:53] same image that god created man
[1:13:56] we know according to the word of god the
[1:13:58] absolute that we're returning back to
[1:14:00] that image
[1:14:02] god's not going to be mocked if he said
[1:14:04] let us make man in our image he's going
[1:14:07] to have a man after his image i don't
[1:14:09] care what he's got to go through
[1:14:11] isaiah 55 verse 11 says so shall my word
[1:14:14] be that go forth out of my mouth it
[1:14:17] shall not return unto me void but it
[1:14:19] shall accomplish that which i please and
[1:14:22] it shall prosper in the thing that i
[1:14:24] sent it to
[1:14:25] so god will have a people in his image
[1:14:30] we know part of this process
[1:14:33] john 3 16 for god so loved the world
[1:14:36] that what that
[1:14:38] he gave himself ephesians
[1:14:41] 5 tells us he gave himself for it that
[1:14:44] he might sanctify the church he might
[1:14:46] cleanse it
[1:14:48] and wash it
[1:14:50] and wash it by the
[1:14:51] by the word
[1:14:53] we are washed by the word
[1:14:55] to come to church and our only motive is
[1:14:57] to get to feel better
[1:15:01] without washing
[1:15:04] in other words i wanna i'm all been
[1:15:07] from the market i work in the pond
[1:15:08] pulling the seaweeds out and when he
[1:15:10] gets done he is so dirty i don't want to
[1:15:13] hug him i try to hug him before he's
[1:15:15] done before he does the job
[1:15:18] but to go ahead and say you know i just
[1:15:20] want to be clean from this yucky sweaty
[1:15:22] stuff on me and never go into the water
[1:15:26] how are you going to get clean right
[1:15:28] it's true
[1:15:29] you know what's really appealing for the
[1:15:31] women is they got this the spray now you
[1:15:33] can wash your hair with the spray
[1:15:35] without getting it wet
[1:15:38] that's really appealing
[1:15:42] you we come to church to get washed
[1:15:47] because we're we're we're trying to get
[1:15:49] to a place that we're not
[1:15:52] and if that could be our focus and our
[1:15:54] goal well i'll tell you we just won't
[1:15:56] get offended
[1:15:57] we won't get offended by the word
[1:16:00] we think we're being offended by a man
[1:16:03] but we're not
[1:16:07] the man is not doing anything or saying
[1:16:09] anything to hurt you
[1:16:12] we we don't want that spirit behind the
[1:16:14] pulpit
[1:16:16] but the word cuts
[1:16:18] it hurts
[1:16:20] but it's not meant to hurt our soul and
[1:16:23] our spirit
[1:16:26] it's to change the nature of our soul
[1:16:38] so let's let's
[1:16:40] allow the lord to have his way
[1:16:43] with this word we come in the church
[1:16:45] we're prepared we let the word speak to
[1:16:46] us
[1:16:47] if it if it's cutting a little bit
[1:16:50] it it's cutting off
[1:16:52] what shouldn't be there if the shoe fits
[1:16:53] wear it
[1:16:55] if it doesn't fit
[1:16:57] but it's okay
[1:16:58] it's still the word
[1:17:00] and great peace have they that love my
[1:17:03] word and nothing shall offend them
[1:17:05] just fall in love with the lord more
[1:17:08] now we know the image of god god is holy
[1:17:12] he's righteous he's just he's true he's
[1:17:14] full of compassion
[1:17:16] the bible says that god is love
[1:17:19] i believe if we just spend more time
[1:17:22] when we read the bible seeking the image
[1:17:24] of god
[1:17:26] we would
[1:17:28] we would know more what we're supposed
[1:17:30] to be
[1:17:31] now the problem with the with the world
[1:17:34] they don't care
[1:17:36] that's the biggest thing is there's not
[1:17:37] enough care
[1:17:39] they would rather go to a church
[1:17:41] and put their name on the book shake a
[1:17:44] hand
[1:17:45] burn some candles
[1:17:47] whatever it might be
[1:17:49] but to go ahead and subject your life
[1:17:53] to come under
[1:17:54] the image of this word
[1:17:56] is too hard
[1:17:58] it's too much effort
[1:18:00] and that's why the world
[1:18:04] isn't interested that interested
[1:18:07] if they could pull into a bank get their
[1:18:09] money pull into
[1:18:11] a restaurant get their food if they
[1:18:12] could just pull into church and get come
[1:18:14] up with the image of christ well they
[1:18:16] would do that right
[1:18:18] amen
[1:18:20] but i tell you
[1:18:24] building character or the image of
[1:18:26] christ
[1:18:27] it's not a gift it's it won't be just
[1:18:29] handed to you because of some easy thing
[1:18:32] that we did
[1:18:34] it it comes to you hating your flesh so
[1:18:38] much the image of the beast that you're
[1:18:40] manifesting that you get serious about
[1:18:42] dying out to it and saying god fill me
[1:18:45] with the holy ghost
[1:18:47] that's when things begin to happen in a
[1:18:49] man's life
[1:18:52] and i'll tell you don't ever get to a
[1:18:54] place where you're satisfied
[1:18:57] paul was never there
[1:19:02] god had taken this man
[1:19:05] who was a total antichrist
[1:19:09] and and put him as the example for you
[1:19:11] and i
[1:19:13] in 14 books of the bible
[1:19:17] and his attitude is our example
[1:19:21] i'm forgetting everything that's in the
[1:19:22] past
[1:19:24] don't let the right hand know what the
[1:19:25] left hand doing i don't care what sins i
[1:19:27] don't care what vic i'm putting them all
[1:19:28] in the past
[1:19:30] and i'm pressing towards the image
[1:19:34] i'm not there yet i haven't attained yet
[1:19:36] i haven't apprehended it yet
[1:19:38] but i'm pressing towards it
[1:19:41] and when you get down to the end of your
[1:19:43] journey you aren't about to say like he
[1:19:45] said i've fought a good fight i've
[1:19:47] finished my course
[1:19:50] there's there's a crown that awaits me
[1:19:52] not only me what he said but to everyone
[1:19:55] that loves him
[1:19:58] love not just
[1:20:00] love what he did for me
[1:20:03] i love to do his will every day in your
[1:20:04] life
[1:20:06] interested about what you're doing
[1:20:07] taking time to check lord is this
[1:20:09] pleasing we've seen that song pleasing
[1:20:11] pleasing let everything i do be pleasing
[1:20:13] to you it's a beautiful nice song
[1:20:16] but does our life do that
[1:20:21] you know
[1:20:22] we'd be
[1:20:23] here's how tricky the devil is
[1:20:26] brother man said that this message will
[1:20:27] never become denominationalized
[1:20:29] but we do and it's the truth
[1:20:32] but the thing is because we go to a
[1:20:34] message church does not mean we're in
[1:20:36] the message
[1:20:40] is really the message in us
[1:20:43] can put a bottle in the water
[1:20:45] but it's the water in the bottle
[1:20:48] so we can be in the in the message but
[1:20:50] is the message in us
[1:20:56] the devil is always trying to get us to
[1:20:59] just relax
[1:21:02] give you what you want make you happy
[1:21:07] and that keeps us from pressing
[1:21:12] that's how that's why this is the worst
[1:21:14] age out of all the ages is it isn't
[1:21:16] because
[1:21:17] all the perversion and all the corrupt
[1:21:19] politics and
[1:21:21] the nations are
[1:21:23] so
[1:21:24] no
[1:21:25] it's
[1:21:26] because we can have everything we want
[1:21:31] and we don't want to battle not wanting
[1:21:33] it
[1:21:35] that's what makes it hard here
[1:21:38] that's why we say come to church pray
[1:21:41] get prepared get get get in a place
[1:21:43] where the holy ghost can begin to deal
[1:21:45] with you because we can be so much in
[1:21:47] the flesh that we're actually missing
[1:21:49] god
[1:21:54] there's various aspects
[1:21:57] to god's image
[1:21:59] one
[1:22:00] is that god
[1:22:02] has dominion does he not he created
[1:22:04] everything
[1:22:07] and i wish
[1:22:08] men
[1:22:09] would remember this that god has the
[1:22:11] finals hazel
[1:22:13] it'd help them to make different
[1:22:14] decisions but when god made man
[1:22:17] he gave him dominion as well
[1:22:20] after that that same image
[1:22:23] god
[1:22:24] gave all the animals to name
[1:22:26] they're
[1:22:27] still finding animals
[1:22:30] that didn't even know and here adam
[1:22:34] so intelligent names them all
[1:22:37] and whatever he named the bible says
[1:22:39] that's the way they are
[1:22:41] so when he caught a horse a horse it was
[1:22:42] a horse
[1:22:46] he moved mountains
[1:22:48] he could say
[1:22:49] i want this and it would happen
[1:22:52] because he had a creative power
[1:22:55] inside of him brother mantelli said he
[1:22:57] was like a mini god
[1:22:59] because he was created in the image of
[1:23:01] god
[1:23:05] we at this time
[1:23:07] we can't hardly
[1:23:09] stop an argument
[1:23:12] stop a fight
[1:23:13] we can't hardly stop some negative
[1:23:16] nonsense
[1:23:18] but i'll tell you what
[1:23:20] adam had power
[1:23:23] brother brandon says we have power
[1:23:25] inside of us to create an atmosphere
[1:23:30] but if we don't practice creating the
[1:23:32] atmosphere in our homes
[1:23:35] in bad situations with our employees our
[1:23:37] neighbors
[1:23:41] how is god going to entrust in us
[1:23:43] a greater power
[1:23:46] we have to learn to be faithful with
[1:23:48] what we have control over
[1:23:51] that's why that last service we talked
[1:23:53] about
[1:23:55] being able to function
[1:23:56] as a body
[1:23:59] i mean
[1:24:00] i having seven children we did
[1:24:04] experience confusion in our home
[1:24:07] confusion with our children
[1:24:09] things not getting along things not
[1:24:11] being right
[1:24:13] now if i said well that's just the way
[1:24:15] it is
[1:24:21] i don't think brother johnson would have
[1:24:22] said
[1:24:23] brother john
[1:24:24] you need to be a deacon
[1:24:29] i don't want to get into any of this
[1:24:31] but here's the thing
[1:24:33] if god puts something in your power
[1:24:37] he expects you to control it
[1:24:40] so i don't care how bad the atmosphere
[1:24:42] is
[1:24:43] god has placed it in you a power to
[1:24:45] create an atmosphere to fix the thing
[1:24:48] now you may not be able to totally
[1:24:50] permanently fix it forever i understand
[1:24:52] that because it has everything has to go
[1:24:54] through a few more agency
[1:24:57] but at that time there are things that
[1:24:59] you can do right a soft answer turns
[1:25:01] away wrath
[1:25:02] i mean there's just certain things in
[1:25:03] the word that if you you follow that
[1:25:06] you'll get the right results
[1:25:09] that's what god's wanting us to get back
[1:25:12] to
[1:25:14] now
[1:25:17] before the fall
[1:25:19] there was no sorrow there was no pain
[1:25:21] there was no strain there was no
[1:25:22] suffering
[1:25:24] all the work that adam did
[1:25:26] was fun
[1:25:29] i know the difference between working
[1:25:31] and having fun working hard and having
[1:25:34] fun and working hard and not having fun
[1:25:38] and hurting there's a big difference
[1:25:42] but the original
[1:25:44] the
[1:25:45] original creation
[1:25:49] uh there was no pain
[1:25:52] there was no hurt
[1:25:54] like today it's like no pain no gain
[1:25:56] that's not how it was then
[1:26:01] because there was an equipped and i know
[1:26:03] that
[1:26:04] we're not going back to that on this
[1:26:06] side of the rapture
[1:26:08] [Laughter]
[1:26:10] but
[1:26:11] we are gonna because you have to totally
[1:26:13] restore the whole planet and that's not
[1:26:14] gonna happen it's gonna burn but god is
[1:26:17] restoring us
[1:26:20] now another aspect to god's image
[1:26:23] is that god is invisible
[1:26:27] god is invisible so when he created man
[1:26:30] he created him invisible amen
[1:26:33] couldn't see him amen he was invisible
[1:26:37] in the same image
[1:26:40] another aspect to god's image according
[1:26:41] to john 4
[1:26:43] is that god is a spirit
[1:26:47] and so he created man a spirit
[1:26:53] and
[1:26:53] not only that in order for adam
[1:26:57] to worship god
[1:26:59] he had to worship him in the spirit
[1:27:04] no different than today
[1:27:07] no different than today coming in the
[1:27:09] church and not getting in the spirit is
[1:27:10] not going to be acceptable
[1:27:12] it may be good enough for you
[1:27:15] but it is not for god
[1:27:18] because the image of god is the spirit
[1:27:23] another aspect
[1:27:25] is at the time of god's creation when he
[1:27:28] created man
[1:27:30] that
[1:27:31] god held both male and female inside him
[1:27:36] and so when he created man
[1:27:38] he created
[1:27:40] adam with the masculine and the feminist
[1:27:43] spirit inside of him
[1:27:45] that's a scripture we know that
[1:27:48] now eventually god separated
[1:27:52] adam into two
[1:27:55] they were supposed they were both adam
[1:27:56] still
[1:27:58] they were both still adam but one was
[1:28:01] masculine one was female and the female
[1:28:03] part was called eve
[1:28:06] but he called him both adam
[1:28:08] are you with me
[1:28:10] now just as god separated himself
[1:28:16] at
[1:28:17] calvary as it were
[1:28:19] and he separated the feminist part of
[1:28:22] him
[1:28:23] and he put that part in
[1:28:25] his bride
[1:28:28] that's why we are
[1:28:30] a part of god that's why we cannot die
[1:28:35] that's why nothing can separate us from
[1:28:37] the love of god
[1:28:39] you you
[1:28:40] god can't die
[1:28:42] and if god is inside of you you can't
[1:28:45] die
[1:28:47] and
[1:28:48] you can't have an identity crisis about
[1:28:51] this situation
[1:28:53] i'll say it like this
[1:28:55] if you're concerned at all about this
[1:28:59] take the advice of the testimony that we
[1:29:01] heard today
[1:29:03] when our sister was told do you have the
[1:29:05] holy ghost
[1:29:07] she didn't say well i'll tell you what
[1:29:09] god met me and you know god came down
[1:29:11] and i know my sins are forget didn't do
[1:29:13] that
[1:29:15] no she didn't do that with the word
[1:29:18] she went back home
[1:29:20] and said god there's a holy ghost and
[1:29:23] it's for me
[1:29:25] and she got serious so serious it
[1:29:28] reminded me of what brother brahm told
[1:29:31] that one story if you don't give me the
[1:29:33] holy ghost you're going to find my bones
[1:29:35] here when you return right amen right
[1:29:38] that's the determination
[1:29:42] i told her sister the other day
[1:29:44] her testimony reminded me
[1:29:46] of
[1:29:47] when brother branham says i'm so glad
[1:29:48] god got a hold of me before the church
[1:29:51] did
[1:29:52] that's what we need we need to go home
[1:29:54] and let god get a hold of us amen that's
[1:29:56] right
[1:29:59] so we can make this church a better
[1:30:00] church
[1:30:02] this this place this body
[1:30:04] this purpose
[1:30:08] we know that inside of god are various
[1:30:10] attributes brother ram talked to us
[1:30:12] about it
[1:30:13] and that had not yet been manifested in
[1:30:15] isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 says for unto
[1:30:18] us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:30:21] given and the government shall be upon
[1:30:23] his shoulders and his name shall be
[1:30:25] called wonderful counselor the mighty
[1:30:26] god the everlasting father the prince of
[1:30:29] peace so now it looks like we're all
[1:30:31] over the board here
[1:30:33] he's a son
[1:30:34] he's a father
[1:30:36] he's a counselor
[1:30:38] he's a mighty god
[1:30:42] god
[1:30:44] is more
[1:30:46] than just a spirit
[1:30:48] he's more than
[1:30:50] just a father brother random explained
[1:30:52] that god is one but he's manifested in
[1:30:55] three offices
[1:30:56] he also went on to say that that god is
[1:30:59] a triune being
[1:31:02] he has a soul
[1:31:04] he has a body
[1:31:07] right
[1:31:09] the bible says
[1:31:10] in the beginning was the word and that
[1:31:12] verse 14 of saint john chapter 1 that
[1:31:14] word was made flesh the word jesus
[1:31:17] christ
[1:31:19] was the body of god
[1:31:23] the world didn't know it
[1:31:25] they were blind
[1:31:26] they spit on them they
[1:31:28] talked behind his back they they wanted
[1:31:30] a crew even one of his own disciples
[1:31:32] said he wasn't worth
[1:31:36] 30 pieces of silver
[1:31:40] think about it
[1:31:42] blind
[1:31:46] we don't want to
[1:31:48] stand behind how much god loves us we
[1:31:51] need that
[1:31:52] we need that
[1:31:55] but if that's all we do will never come
[1:31:58] into the image of christ
[1:32:02] you can say all day long come to a
[1:32:04] church and just hear all day long your
[1:32:06] bride your bride your bride your bride
[1:32:08] god loves you god loves you you're part
[1:32:11] of him
[1:32:12] go out there and get whipped by the
[1:32:14] devil
[1:32:18] because you need
[1:32:20] the life of christ inside of you to beat
[1:32:22] that devil when you leave here amen
[1:32:25] so that word has to become manifested in
[1:32:28] you the bible says that jesus christ was
[1:32:31] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:32:33] devil and he has to be manifested in us
[1:32:36] to destroy the works of the devil that
[1:32:37] he's trying to do to us he's trying to
[1:32:40] suppress us and and keep us away from
[1:32:42] the word and and keep people out of
[1:32:45] church and keep them from being a
[1:32:47] witness
[1:32:48] so you shall receive power
[1:32:50] you shall be witnesses for me
[1:32:53] now this is what the devil's doing
[1:32:57] so we need
[1:32:59] god inside of us
[1:33:07] i'm just thinking that
[1:33:10] i was unable to get to the you know
[1:33:12] where i wanted to get to so i have to
[1:33:13] find a place just to stop here because i
[1:33:15] don't want to just go on
[1:33:18] but
[1:33:19] i don't want you to forget where we're
[1:33:21] at for the next time we get together
[1:33:25] because we're trying to lay a foundation
[1:33:28] god
[1:33:29] is one but he's a triune being
[1:33:32] and he made man the same way
[1:33:34] and we're going to be getting into the
[1:33:36] details of those same things
[1:33:39] we know
[1:33:40] god is one
[1:33:42] first john chapter 5 verse 7 for there
[1:33:44] are three that bear record in heaven the
[1:33:46] father the word and the holy ghost and
[1:33:48] these three what are one jesus said i
[1:33:51] and my father are one there's there's
[1:33:54] one lord one father one spirit one god
[1:33:59] so god is a triune being
[1:34:01] and he made man a triune being
[1:34:05] first god created man in spirit form
[1:34:09] male and female and he had dominion
[1:34:11] over things and god
[1:34:13] wanted him
[1:34:15] to till the ground
[1:34:17] but
[1:34:19] his spirit couldn't till the ground
[1:34:23] that's what the bible says
[1:34:25] so he created
[1:34:27] man a body
[1:34:31] an outside body i'm just going to throw
[1:34:33] this sign up here real quick so you get
[1:34:35] it idea
[1:34:37] am i allowed to take a little bit more
[1:34:39] time
[1:34:40] because of the uh
[1:34:42] our wonderful testimony
[1:34:46] so he just created a body
[1:34:51] and this body had the ability to
[1:34:54] feel things to see the different plants
[1:34:59] to taste the mint to to smell the
[1:35:02] lavender
[1:35:04] to hear the different things
[1:35:07] in the garden he was able
[1:35:09] to make contact
[1:35:11] with the garden
[1:35:13] that he wasn't able to do
[1:35:16] in the spirit amen
[1:35:19] why are we going through this
[1:35:21] because i want you to know why you act
[1:35:24] the way you act amen why you do the way
[1:35:28] you do and and what we're supposed to be
[1:35:31] doing
[1:35:32] because so often when we look at one
[1:35:34] another we look at one another's face
[1:35:37] and we say that's who you are but
[1:35:38] brother man says you're not a body when
[1:35:40] he they ask the question who what are
[1:35:42] you he said your soul
[1:35:45] your soul
[1:35:46] we're not even the thing we're looking
[1:35:48] at
[1:35:49] finally when these bodies are dissolved
[1:35:51] we have another body weight in us
[1:35:53] but not the regenerated soul
[1:35:57] how the tree falls that's the way it
[1:35:59] lies
[1:36:00] it's changed here that is the thing that
[1:36:03] has to change here
[1:36:06] we are getting a body where we don't get
[1:36:08] more wrinkles we can hear better
[1:36:15] but our soul
[1:36:17] is changed here
[1:36:20] this is why it's so important
[1:36:22] to get serious about the word
[1:36:24] for your personal life
[1:36:30] brother jonathan could put everything he
[1:36:32] has into becoming more like christ
[1:36:36] and brother bob over here because
[1:36:37] there's no brother bob he could just
[1:36:39] lala did whatever just not a big deal
[1:36:42] and never change
[1:36:46] so
[1:36:48] we have to put everything we have
[1:36:50] into changing our soul the nature
[1:36:54] of the spirit we're going to get into
[1:36:55] this
[1:37:00] the body
[1:37:01] was made
[1:37:03] when god created the body he created it
[1:37:07] from the earth
[1:37:10] the body was not in the image of god
[1:37:14] that body was in the image of a beast
[1:37:17] just where all the other animals came
[1:37:21] it was two separate
[1:37:22] it was too separate
[1:37:27] we don't want to put so much emphasis in
[1:37:29] this flesh
[1:37:32] it's just a beast
[1:37:36] and so
[1:37:38] whether
[1:37:41] whether we want to say that after the
[1:37:43] body was created then he put the the the
[1:37:46] spirit the spirit the spirit let's do
[1:37:49] that
[1:37:50] let's put this
[1:37:54] spirit
[1:37:56] now brother ram talked about i don't
[1:37:58] definitely don't want to get into
[1:38:03] spirit and soul which one is which
[1:38:06] he taught it both ways
[1:38:09] but
[1:38:10] we're going to do the very best to
[1:38:12] explain it
[1:38:13] what we feel
[1:38:15] to help understand
[1:38:19] so whether you want to say he put this
[1:38:21] body around the spirit or he created the
[1:38:23] body and then he put the spirit in it
[1:38:26] doesn't matter
[1:38:27] we're a triune being
[1:38:29] we have a spirit we have a body so far
[1:38:36] and
[1:38:38] remember the spirit made contact with
[1:38:40] god
[1:38:42] the body made contact with the garden
[1:38:46] we
[1:38:47] were created
[1:38:49] to bring pleasure to god
[1:38:53] god said there was no man to till the
[1:38:56] garden
[1:38:58] so he created man with a purpose to get
[1:39:01] to work
[1:39:03] to till the garden to take care of the
[1:39:04] garden
[1:39:06] not the spirit
[1:39:07] the body
[1:39:09] so our bodies are created for his
[1:39:11] pleasure amen
[1:39:13] can you say amen to that
[1:39:15] our bodies have a purpose
[1:39:18] now you have a choice
[1:39:20] do what you want with your body
[1:39:22] do what you want with your life
[1:39:25] he gives every man that free moral
[1:39:27] agency
[1:39:29] but it's not his will for you to do
[1:39:32] anything other than the perfect will of
[1:39:34] god
[1:39:36] man let's stand together
[1:39:43] remember flesh and blood will not
[1:39:45] inherit the kingdom so that outside body
[1:39:48] is not going to
[1:39:49] inherit it
[1:39:51] we do have a another body he looks
[1:39:55] like we did
[1:39:56] when we were younger
[1:40:00] can't wait can't wait to meet him
[1:40:04] but
[1:40:06] this flesh
[1:40:08] it just it's it's going to rot and the
[1:40:10] more that we
[1:40:11] can
[1:40:12] fight against its desire
[1:40:16] for
[1:40:18] for whatever for whatever the more we
[1:40:20] can fight against that
[1:40:23] the more that we could yield our vessel
[1:40:25] to be used for the glory of the lord
[1:40:27] because that's why we were created
[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:33] amen let's just look to him in a word of
[1:40:35] prayer
[1:40:37] our gracious heavenly father
[1:40:39] we want to thank you
[1:40:42] you know who we are
[1:40:44] that word declares you know our frailty
[1:40:47] you know that we're just
[1:40:49] flesh we're just humans
[1:40:53] the lord you also know that
[1:40:56] inside of us
[1:40:58] is a part of you
[1:41:02] you place a german life in us and when
[1:41:05] your word comes
[1:41:07] hovers over us
[1:41:09] it be we begin
[1:41:11] to be drawn to that word and attached to
[1:41:14] that word and want to become the
[1:41:16] manifestation of that word
[1:41:19] remember that story that brother branham
[1:41:22] gave about
[1:41:23] that little
[1:41:25] eagle egg that got
[1:41:27] lost in the barn yard and hatched and
[1:41:32] just seeming
[1:41:34] so different than everybody else that
[1:41:36] was there and then one day mother eagle
[1:41:38] came by and let out her scream
[1:41:42] and then she knew
[1:41:44] she knew there was no more confusion her
[1:41:48] how odd she was she knew who she
[1:41:50] belonged to
[1:41:52] and god you sent this
[1:41:54] message for us you you've opened your
[1:41:57] word to us that we can know that we are
[1:41:59] truly your bride
[1:42:03] and father i pray that you would
[1:42:05] give us all
[1:42:06] revelation of this
[1:42:08] great image that you're bringing us into
[1:42:12] that we could do our part
[1:42:16] to to seek after it to hunger after your
[1:42:20] righteousness and and all that your
[1:42:22] image is lord
[1:42:25] i pray that your spirit would come
[1:42:27] inside of us
[1:42:28] in a great
[1:42:29] measure and and that we would spend more
[1:42:32] time with you and more fellowship and
[1:42:35] read your word and just grow and grow
[1:42:38] until we become what you've called us to
[1:42:40] be
[1:42:42] lord we commit

[1:42:54] that lord are uh

[1:43:03] holy ghost would help all of us for the
[1:43:06] time is short

[1:43:13] lord that
[1:43:14] you put in our
[1:43:16] our responsibility list as it were and
[1:43:19] that is to make ourselves ready

[1:43:25] become dressed with it and
[1:43:28] to seek these things lord
[1:43:30] take away any spirit from us that is is
[1:43:34] making us more casual and and more
[1:43:38] lukewarm

[1:44:35] nothing would keep that from happening
[1:44:38] lord that that desire that they have
[1:44:40] would bring forth fruit
[1:44:42] that they would see more of the love and
[1:44:45] the joy and the peace and more of the
