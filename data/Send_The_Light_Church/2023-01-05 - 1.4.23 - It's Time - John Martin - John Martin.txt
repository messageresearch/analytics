we're turning there I want to say it's so good to see brother Johnson in church it's been a while it's good to see you we will continue praying for sister Johnson amen and we want to continue praying for sister Tasha good to see I think I saw sister Linda Helms there haven't seen her in a while God bless her amen Ecclesiastes chapter 3 I thought this was something when brother Ron had made mention of these couple of these verses here starting with verse number one two everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time together Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to rent and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace what prophet have he that worketh in that wherein he labereth I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to to be exercised in it he have made everything beautiful in his time amen God bless you may be seated our hearts will go out to brother Marty and his children and the grandchildren just uh knowing that separation has come and taken place it isn't like going on vacation or being separated for a little bit you come back and you're joined together this is for the rest of time while we're here and it is something that we as a church will need to uh continually help brother Marty love him hug him tell him how much he means to you and and how much sister Kathleen has meant to you as well because even though our sister is not going to be in church here anymore the memory of our sister will always remain with us I am happy to report that brother Marty is doing well um each time that we had seen them he is doing well he's doing so well today that I couldn't help but to tell him how well he is doing and he reminded me of his parents telling him when he was younger that he was always the strong one but his attitude helps and and his children it reflects off and their children they're doing well in the last um evening everyone got to be around a sister Kathleen that very night and it was wonderful and they're very grateful for that time that they had I will say that most everyone that that we know that knows her in some fame or some some fashion former way are our grieving to some degree and they will be having a memorial service um Saturday some sort of memorial service Saturday January 14th that's all we knew we just got that information like an hour before they had decided it will not be here because the church cannot hold the people so it's going to be at their daughter's church and I'm not sure that they're going to be an officiating of it I'm not sure exactly how it's going to go but we're all of course invited and it would be good to go and show our support amen our sister Kathleen had been attending our church for around 20 years and she had been faithful from the beginning she had been faithful from the beginning honestly from the time she stepped in brother Marty stepped in they paid tithes and they didn't miss a Beat and never had to well we'll just wait a month no it was never like that they had a revelation of ties they were faithful to it and the reason I'm bringing this up is uh two days before she had passed away were talking to brother Marty and sister Kathleen and she didn't have a lot of strength to where she could talk so she'd have to muster up the strength and to say something and she'd say give up the ties here she is I told her I said it says your in this condition and you're worried about your ties but it was to God see those ties belong to God and I'm saying this is the type of people they are this is the type of sister that she was she was faithful when she wasn't here she was she prayed for all of us she was a prayer where she was one of the prayer warriors of this church and I'm sure on the other side we'll we'll know all about it but she was a faithful member to the body of Christ into this little assembly here she loved the word of God and she loved the message of the hour amen she loved the five-fold Ministries she always expressed how thankful she was for the fivefold ministry here and of course she she loved the ministry here and she often wanted a a copy of our of of the of the notes and uh I felt a little funny about it because you know what are my notes but um she just loved the word and she loved to study the word and she would talk about the things that she would study and how often they were right in continuity with Sunday school as you know she was uh she taught Sunday school for years she believed in every promise of God Amen and she held to those promises Faithfully to the end she believed that God was faithful to his word that he had never failed one time of the promises of God she was a faithful servant of God in her church as well in her home she was the church nurse but she also was a nurse in the hospital and she just cared about people and many of us or some of us she you know when she talked to you she was concerned about you yeah and uh she was just faithful to do her very very best and she used to tell me about people not wanting to listen to her she would she would get up here and she would tell us how many times to wash her hands and to to not spread germs and to stay home if you were sick and she really cared we appreciate appreciate the example the role model I would tell her I said I didn't wait to the end through the years I would tell her I look up to you sister Kathleen because I believe that there's Christ in one another and we should be able to see things in one another that we look up to them amen amen I believe that with all my heart you don't want to wait till it's too late to express how much you care and love one another I can't I I can't express enough how important it is how much it encourages and help one another to let them know how much you love and appreciate them every Sunday she would come to church early she was earlier than anyone and of course she wanted to get ready for Sunday School prepare but she also wanted she'd practice uh tuner dulcimer and get that ready but what was so remarkable she wanted to come and pray for the service pray for the ministry pray for the Saints she took it serious and she was as faithful as faithful to be about you could I'd just be there and she'd pop in and right there just like clockwork and it really done something for the ministry when there's someone there who you know is Faithfully praying for the ministry because I believe prayers are the backbone of the ministry I believe that you could count on her she wanted to put her shoulder to the wheel about things she was always concerned she worked non-stop for Jesus she was always looking for opportunities to share the message with somebody she would tell me those different ones that she would talk to she will be greatly missed and I was telling brother Mark before service there is no one that will be able to take her place she'll be missed with tears shall be missed with sorrow shall be missed with great memories personally this is me I believe that if she could stand here today after being on the other side she would tell us to press on to what this message taught us get perfect love because nothing but perfect love can enter in and we need to press on we need to press on no one that's ever gone to the other side and has come back has come back with a testimony or if I could just stay here for a little bit longer with you guys it was why did you call me back and and I don't want to be here and and and she's in a better place she is free from the pain that she was suffering and and to sit there and watch her suffer brother Marty was watching it for months months and he's had I don't mean it wrong but he's had much time to grieve and his share that he lost her uh a while ago [Music] but we it was a shock to us and it's okay if we grieve it's okay however we feel because it's natural and you don't want to bottle up things but we need to come to the realization that she's doing real well today she's doing real well today I'd like to title this message it's time if you're in pain you hurt it's time to grieve if you're thinking of sister Kathleen's new body and her being set free forever then it's time to rejoice when we had opportunity to pray with her the last couple of days it was it was hard it's hard seeing her like this and it was hard for her but she had muster up just enough strength to say praise the Lord in that condition praising the Lord I believe it's always time to praise the Lord amen it's always time to praise the Lord she had a good attitude amen and to everything there's a season and a time to have repurpose under Heaven a time to be born and a time to die you walk in or drive into any cemetery and you'll see uh tombstones with two dates on them person's name and two dates and it was the time that they were born and the time that they died and when you look at those dates they're all ready set couldn't change them that was what was ordained to be all right and when we look back and we see those tombstones and we hear about a person's life uh Smith's Wigglesworth or somebody that's going on to be with the Lord there was a time that they were born in a time that they died and we accept that and when we're looking ahead we don't know when we're going to die we don't know we don't know who's going to be left to go on a Rapture and we don't know who's going to die prior we don't know but when we're in this this place called the middle and we see the actual end take place it shocks us as if something is wrong especially because we believed that our sister was going to be healed come on now and we didn't see it [Music] it didn't make it wrong it's in God's time God is in control the time to die always brings rise to questions especially why where is the time to be born seems to be more understandable more in order more more joyous we don't question a beautiful new baby being born we don't say why did this happen we're rejoicing but when the time of death comes about it stirs up many questions inside of us many of those questions can come into our minds and they will stay unanswered these unanswered questions can open the door for confusion for doubts for Fears they can affect our lives and sometimes even leave us scarred I wonder how many can raise your hand and say I was asking why amen amen how come why didn't she get healed I mean the very fact that these questions that come into our mind bring confusion and doubt and fears and make us angry and upset let us know that they don't come from God because God is not the author of confusion God has not given us the spirit of fear but we know the enemy is doing what he can to bring us down and to Hold Us in Chains and to to get us to stop believing in the word of God and trusting God that he's faithful one question that can pass to our mind as Believers is why wasn't so and so healed why wasn't so-and-so we know a number of of Believers that have have died from different diseases and different things Through the Ages it's a good question why was it so and so healed but honestly it's none of your business it's none of your business it's God's business [Music] it's God's business he's The Giver of Life the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord Lord has his reasons to everything there's a season time to be born a time to die we cannot change the season God chooses it for us God chose us out of a million people to be born into this life and by God's foreknowledge he knew the very year the very day the very minute that our time would be up if it's God's time there ain't enough doctors there ain't enough medicine and there is not enough believers now now listen to me yes God raises the Dead God has raised it God God will raise the Dead it is God's word but that doesn't mean that there's not a end to the season and we must understand that we don't know when the end of the season that somebody's life is but whenever that end is that's the end we don't change it we don't change God's mind we don't say this is the way things are going to be because we didn't create the life we didn't author their life and and we're certainly not one to say it's not time it's never time to separate from some but I never want to accept I want heaven to start right now I'm serious I don't want to go through separation and and that foreign if God raises somebody for the dead and brother Johnson here is testified that means it was not time the season wasn't over I remember when I was young I got a job doing a Cabinetry and I was a young believer in brother Johnson's church and I as young believers you're on fire for God and you want to share Jesus with everybody and so I was sharing Jesus with my boss and my boss was not a Believer he didn't believe in God and so he added more out for me he watched me real close but I'll never forget this he be he told me of a out of a body experience that he had he died he got there was an accident he died he was lifted up and he was up in in the air and he was looking down on his body and he was looking down on the men the the ambulances that were trying to get him to come back oh and uh and they revived them obviously he came back and here was a person that did not believe in God and saw this thing happen if it's not time it's not time but if it's time it's time and that's what I want to say we just got to trust God it's not what we want it's not what we feel but it doesn't mean anything was wrong right foreign we gotta tell the devil where he belongs he don't belong in our minds he don't belong in our thoughts right amen this message may not be for everybody in every area but it needs to go for those where it's meant to go for amen if it's not time I believe Believers can say to this mountain be thou removed and it will be removed and but if it's time there's nothing we can do I remember hearing brother Brandon talking about a lady that was deathly sick and she was going to die and they asked brother Brandon to pray for her and many ministers had prayed for her she was a a well-known uh person I can't remember the story well but I do remember this that there was even a prophecy that went out over her that she was going to get healed and brother Branham and they just wanted brother Branham to pray and to believe because he had this gift and and that she would be healed because they didn't want her to die and brother Brandon said she was not going to live no matter what because there is a season there's a time to be born and a time to die and it's in God's hands and it doesn't belong in the hands of man so we would like to change things and we'd like to control things and we like to say why things are and why things are not but you know we're no match for God we're no match for God amen God's will will always supersede our desires and our will amen when the time has arrived it has arrived brother Daryl told me when he was here before this last time and he had prayed for sister Kathleen he said that he was in the Army and when he was in the army that he had about 10 or 12 commands that were given to him that everyone that was in the Army had to do you just had to do it but if a commanding officer would tell him to do something different he said that was the only time that those commands could be superseded is when a commanding officer said no you don't have to do that this is what I want you to do and he went on to explain to me that we have commands in the Bible they shall lay hands on the sick or they shall recover and to pray one for another and and we have these commands right here but if our commanding officer Jesus Christ says different for that situation it supersedes what he wants for that moment and we must remember it's not us that's got everything figured out God's got it figured out and we've got to trust him we just got to follow suit do what the word says and trust God for the rest of it God does everything beautiful in his time turn with me if you would to II Samuel chapter 12 verse 15. David had a child that suffered and died we know the some of us know the story here second Samuel chapter 12 verse 15 and Nathan departed unto the house unto his house and the Lord struck the child that Uriah wife bear unto David and it was very sick now David therefore besought God for the child and David fasted and went in and laid all night upon the Earth you could see that David was really reaching out to God God will you change the situation for my my child and the Elders of the house arose and went to him to raise him up from the Earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with him and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the Servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then that's himself would we tell him that the child is dead but when David saw his servants whispered David perceived that the child was dead therefore David said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself changed his apparel and came to the house of the Lord and He worshiped then he came to his own house and when he and when he required and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat this is after the death had taken place he's just changing his old demeanor about the situation there was no grieving uh expressions of grieving going on there was one of them moving forward are you with me and then verse 21 then said his servant's unto him what thing is this that thou has done thou did as fast and weep for the child while it was a lie but when the child was dead thou did US rise and eat bread they wanted to know what was going on and then he said while the child was yet alive I fasted I wept for I said who can tell whether God will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead therefore should I fast can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return to me amen I shall go to him we shall go to Sister Kathleen to those that have crossed to the other side but they cannot come back I just read this verse 24 and David Comfort Bathsheba his wife and went into her and lay with her and she Bears son and called his name Samuel and the Lord loved him I just love the the the the attitude we don't know what the Lord would do I mean we've heard through the message we've heard through ministers that sometimes sickness is allowed to be on people because of reasons that God is trying to deal with are you with me and God I've heard some ministers say God doesn't even want us praying those things off because God wants those things dealt with see this is what I'm saying this stuff is not our business it's God's business God has called us to pray for one another to believe the word for one another and what happens happens that's it that's it be a faithful servant to Christ just do his his bidding do his will David couldn't change the mind of God I had a brother who lived less than four days on Earth was that fair was that right why did that happen I mean the questions could go endless but God had his time a set time a season I had a father who died at the hands of a doctor who was just doing a routine biopsy I'll tell you when I got that phone call there was such a awesome peace and I was just a very young believer I think brother Johnson was out of town in a mission trip and I couldn't explain it but I knew it was not the doctor's fault all right because I trusted in God God is in control and the quicker we can trust God that he's in control of things the less we'll get bothered and upset because we seem to take things into our own hands all the time for what reason to show God how ignorant we are God is awesome he knows what he's doing and he will say sorry to no man on the day of judgment there will be no mistakes and the more we can under take that into our hearts the more we can walk with the trust and the soberness that no matter what we go through all things work together for the good we got to trust him no matter what I'm so thankful that God gave us time to pray and fast with sister Kathleen I am I'm thankful for brother Daryl and all the ministers who laid hands on her and and the handkerchiefs we prayed for and that she held on to for so long I am grateful for that amen I'm grateful for every brother and every sister that came to the Altar and prayed with when she could even barely walk to get up here I counted an honor to about a grab her arm and lift it up because she couldn't lift it herself and praise the Lord with her amen but what has happened has happened and it's in God's hands I'm thankful for every soldier of the cross that believed the word of God and that he keeps his Commandments it was God's time it was God's will God is in control his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and he don't have to tell us why you know when that happened to my dad I never said why when that happened to my brother I never said why no if God wants to tell me something he'll tell me he wants to reveal something to me he will I think he's looking for me to have a right attitude I think that's what he's looking for first it never seems to be our time when somebody leaves never separation will cause grief it'll start a roller coaster ride of anxiety persistent traumatic grief can cause us to cycle through different stages we've all heard about the different stages of grief and most of us have dealt with it at one time or another our human nature wants to fight accepting this current change that's happened and we deny certain things we um begin to uh we want to even bargain with God we're going to be a better person we'll do this a lot of things transpire when we're dealing with a separation foreign it can even cause us to go into depression look what happened to Peter when he finally had to deal with Jesus separating from him now Jesus told him ahead of time I'm going to separate don't let your heart be troubled I'm going away but I'm going to come back he even told him that the elders and the chief priests are going to take them and and crucify him and so he they knew ahead of time and he said I'm going to send you a comforter he's going to comfort you during comfort you he's going to be with you I'll be with you even in you to the end but when the actual time transpired and they were taken Jesus away from him and that separation was happening look at the grief that was starting to take place Peter started acting like he never acted before started saying I don't even I don't even know him denying him cursing that he even knew Jesus so I'll say it like this no matter what we go through it's okay it's okay because this flesh this human part of us has a hard time dealing with separation but just know when the dust settles God is in control and God has something for us to help us through these times do you believe that we need to keep our focus on God's perfect will that he's in control as much as possible God views death and much differently than we do to us it's the end to God it's the beginning of a life without sorrow without pain without any kind of crying and and hurt and and and Psalms 116 verse 15 says precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints precious in the sight of the Lord I'll tell you when I was with sister Kathleen I said sister Kathleen I want you to understand this that right now what's going on is something precious in the sight of the Lord and I said I want to just give you the John Martin version precious in the sight of the Lord is the crossing over Jordan of his Faithful Servants amen I believe it because God knows that person is going to be so happy [Music] not having to be interfered with the devil's thoughts and negativity and anxiety and burden about this no set free from all that Hallelujah [Music] God has something for us to deal with this new reality it's only found in him it's peace he is the Prince of Peace but he's not only the Prince of Peace he is our peace the Bible says he is our peace John 14 verse 27 says peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid it's Jesus is telling us that we have control of what we're going to think about look we sing that song Let the Holy Ghost come in we already know God wants to give us the Holy Ghost more than we want it with so much force and so much pressure but we're the ones standing in the way we've got to want it and we've got to want God's peace and we can do that by accepting God's will amen is accepting God's perfect will verse 28 ye have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you if you love me you would Rejoice because I said I go unto my father from my father is greater than I and the reason I wanted to read this is I believe that there's a part of us that needs to Rejoice with sister Kathleen because she has gone on to be with Jesus she has gone on to be with the father and we should be rejoicing for her amen Hallelujah she's never gonna hurt she's never had a heartache no one's ever going to use her and stop and talk behind her back anymore and nothing can affect her the devil can't get to her we ought to rejoice and I'll say again rejoice think on her blessings it will help he promised to keep us in perfect peace if our mind has stayed on him Philippians chapter 4 verse 4. rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice verse 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God Hallelujah you know you're putting yourself in the hands of God amen that's what you're doing you're you're putting the situations in God's hands amen you're not just saying you're not coming to him with just uh here's my request and and no matter what give me what I want that don't work that don't work be careful for nothing trust God in every situation he'll work it out I believe it says they're in a book of uh Psalms um trust in the Lord with all thy heart lean not to thy own understanding and all the ways acknowledge Him and give you the desires I'm not quoting it exactly right but you know the scripture you know the word I just say if you just committed to God he'll direct everything amen now look at verse 7 and the peace of God which passeth all understanding you know what that dude that just kicks all the Y's out kicks all the questions out amen no I got peace that surpasses all those questions shall keep your hearts and I love this and your minds through Christ Jesus so you you can't just say well I got peace down here but this thing's going to mount Mill in the mouth no no claim the promise claim the word this is what the word says we've got to bring our faith under subjection to the word and then the word Works in our behalf amen finally Brethren whatsoever things are true and honest just and pure and lovely and of a good report if there be any strength if there be any praise think on these things these things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in Paul do and the God of Peace shall be with you that's a promise Saints we have to put effort to keep our thoughts right yeah we can't just say oh yeah that's a scripture I like that scripture I wish it worked for me no it works for everybody who does it but if we don't do it and then we're wondering why we're caught up it don't work for the unbeliever amen it works for the believer and he promised to keep us and perfect peace all right Philippians chapter 1 verse 21 for to me for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain so are we sad I because sister Kathleen's gone and we reword that are we sad because sister Kathleen's not here I told sister Kathleen the lesson probably 26 hours I said I am really jealous that you're going before me because for her it was gain it was total gain but if I live in the flesh that is the fruit of my labor yet what I shall choose I want not for what I am for I am in a straight betwixt too having a desire to depart and to be with Christ Which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you so that's what I'm saying is as long as we're here on the Earth we're here for a purpose to help somebody it's for somebody it is not for ourselves sister Sharon the Fontaine one of her first albums uh they she sang a song I'm going home where I belong I want I want to go home where I belong amen all right James chapter 4 verse 14. I want to share this the scriptures with you because I want us to realize when we leave here don't think you've got the rest of your life we don't know what the rest of our life is amen verse 14 whereas ye know not what shall be on tomorrow for what is your life what is your life anyways what what is that end date do you know it is even a vapor which appeared for a little time and then vanisheth away for that y'all to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this and do that if the Lord will I have confidence God knows what he's doing I have confidence in the will of the Lord all right First Peter chapter 1 verse 22 we're gonna end with this scripture let's yes let's just read it for four verses here First Peter chapter 1 verse 22 senior purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently wow I love this scripture this this is real being born again not of a corruptable seed but Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever amen and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you God's will God's word if we've got breath in our lung don't just give God five or ten minutes of your day give them your life amen practice on a daily basis to give him your all amen now I don't did I tell you that was my last scripture it was not the last one I I wanted to give you another one and it I let's if we could read just two more if that's okay second Corinthians chapter five verse one I want to say this sister I asked sister Kathleen she wanted to give a message to the church in her last words to the church was she said tell the church I love them I love them that was a message from Mr Kathleen to each of you second Corinthians chapter 5 verse one for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that which not for that we would be uncle but that would be clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now we that have wrought us for the self same thing as God and who also have given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that while as we are at home in the body okay whether we're at home in the body we are absent from the Lord while we're home in the body if we are absent from the Lord so as long as we're here there's a part of us that is absent from the Lord are you with me for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether we be present or absent we may be accepted of him now this is really really important there's a message in this whether we are absent from the body present with the Lord we as long as we have an opportunity we need to be laboring for the Lord because whether we're present or absent God's going to hold us accountable yes sir amen amen don't think your life is your life and you can do what you want you've been bought with a price you now need to ask God God what would you have your servant to do for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to what you have done whether it be good or bad amen I say while we have time because we don't know the end date of any of us let's spend the rest of our life living more for God than we ever have does that go along with that men's meeting amen that goes right along with our men's meeting I mean last one this is first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. but I would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others have that have which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now I'll love this next verse wherefore Comfort one another with these words I'll tell you just stay with this and don't worry about all the other stuff we need to comfort one another you know when we come to the house of the Lord we don't always get what we would like to get here but we always get here what God wants us to get here so I'll say like this when we we come to the house the Lord is to find out where we are with him so we can get closer to him so we can get more ready that is the main purpose now it doesn't mean other needs can't be met but look you're in the business of comforting others you understand and if you spent more time comforting others God will bless your heart in your mind he will because what you sow is what you read that's right if you're coming to the house of God to get all your comfort and you're not getting and I say unto you spend more time trying to comfort other people and you'll see it'll come back around to you we just got to use the house of God for what it's meant to be I believe the word of God is is for Comfort but you understand I'm saying we don't want to make it something different we got scripture right there in the Bible what we need to be doing we are commissioned by God to comfort one another amen praise the Lord let's Stand Together in God does everything beautiful in his time if you just take some time in the light of this message to think about what was displayed the last two years by Sister Kathleen faithfulness to pain and suffering and trials she displayed Christ to us in a way that we didn't have an opportunity to you understand what I'm saying so this thing was not in vain God knows what he's doing and when we think of her we think of that faithfulness we think I want to be faithful to the end if he puts me through something I want to say praise God right to the end let's just trust God Amen amen let's let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you from the depths of our heart for your daughter and your servant who's been with us so many years Lord we can't think of a time not one time that she wasn't faithful and Lord we think about The Parables that you gave in your word and when you came time to that accountability of of of the things that were done with their lives like we read in your word those that carried out your will you said to them well done thou good and faithful servant Lord we want to thank you for bringing amongst us a faithful servant Lord she helped so many people she encouraged so many she prayed she she stood behind this ministry always always and Lord we're we're in debt to you for sitting such a one amongst us for so long we thank you for her Lord we thank you for the time that we're able to have with her amen May the the memories of her always be with us every service in our lives Lord May if we get discouraged may we just look to something that she helped us with in our own personal lives to help us along through our trials Lord father I do pray for these that perhaps didn't know her as well Lord we just asked let them see Lords the goodness of you inside of her Works father Lord I pray that you would

sister's prayer for years Lord for years she's come to the altar Lord and just ask for prayer for her children Lord I know those prayers are not going to be unanswered I know they're going to be
