[37:40] and how we should where we need to stand
[37:43] and and
[37:44] um I believe that this this service here
[37:47] is going to help us let's turn to
[37:49] Matthew chapter
[37:51] 13. Matthew Chapter 13 and read the the
[37:55] parable of the terrors
[38:00] are you are you okay with this
[38:03] okay
[38:05] it's in the Bible
[38:07] [Laughter]
[38:10] Matthew 13 starting with verse number 24
[38:12] another Parable put he forth unto them
[38:15] saying
[38:17] the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a
[38:19] man which sold good seed in his field
[38:22] but while men
[38:24] slept the enemy came and sowed tares
[38:28] among the wheat
[38:30] and went his way
[38:32] but when the blade was sprung up and
[38:35] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[38:37] tares also
[38:39] the Servants of the householder came and
[38:42] said unto him sir did us not thou sow
[38:47] good seed in the field
[38:50] from whence then have it tears
[38:55] he said unto them an enemy has done this
[38:58] the servants responded will thou then
[39:01] that we go and gather them up
[39:05] and he said nay last while ye gather up
[39:09] the tares
[39:10] you root up also the wheat with them
[39:14] let both grow together
[39:17] until the Harvest and in the time of
[39:20] harvest I will say to the Reapers gather
[39:22] thee together first the tares and bind
[39:25] them in bundles to burn them but gather
[39:27] the wheat into my barn
[39:33] um now
[39:36] what are these two seeds but back in
[39:40] August we ministered on the two seeds of
[39:42] Abraham one was a spiritual seed one was
[39:45] a natural seed
[39:46] and tonight we want to learn from Jesus
[39:49] here about growing together
[39:52] and the one seed is a spiritual seed and
[39:55] that is the seed of God
[39:58] it was planted by God through the spoken
[40:02] word he spoke the word and
[40:06] the seed came forth and it was planted
[40:10] just like he spoke everything else into
[40:12] existence the Earth the Stars everything
[40:15] was spoken by him and he is still
[40:20] speaking into existence
[40:22] he's still alive he's still making all
[40:26] things new amen
[40:28] now Genesis tells us that every seed
[40:31] will bring forth of its own kind in
[40:34] order for God's seed to come forth it
[40:37] must be born again
[40:42] the only way that God's seed is going to
[40:45] come forth
[40:46] is to be born again because it wasn't
[40:49] born properly to begin with as we don't
[40:52] have time to talk about that but we just
[40:55] know that we were born uh in a
[40:58] corruptable nature
[40:59] the first nature around that seed it
[41:03] must die in order for the new life to
[41:06] come forth we just can't bring forth the
[41:08] new life with the old the first nature
[41:11] must die out before the new nature comes
[41:13] forth amen
[41:15] all things are passed away behold all
[41:17] things are become new and all things are
[41:21] of God
[41:23] so this is that seed that he planted he
[41:26] planted a good seed fact everything that
[41:28] God ever created was good
[41:30] and if you think about it say when he
[41:32] was created he was good hard to think
[41:34] about that right now but he was at one
[41:36] time
[41:37] in John chapter 3 verse 3 says Jesus
[41:40] answered and said unto them verily
[41:42] verily I say unto you except a man be
[41:45] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[41:48] God so the good seed that's been sown it
[41:51] must be born again it can't it's not
[41:53] just going to develop on its own there's
[41:55] a process that has to happen amen a
[41:58] complete conversion now the other seed
[42:02] is a natural seed and it was planted by
[42:05] the Devil Without
[42:08] the spoken word of God
[42:12] or without the will of God
[42:18] now since the devil can't create
[42:23] life
[42:25] eternal life
[42:27] the only way that he could plant the
[42:29] seed is to perversion
[42:31] he took something that was already
[42:34] perfect and he perverted it
[42:40] Satan was able to convince man to take
[42:43] control of his own will and this is
[42:47] what's really important here because
[42:48] that's not how God created man in the
[42:52] beginning right he didn't create him to
[42:54] here's your will go do what you want
[43:04] but Satan offered
[43:07] a way that man could take control of his
[43:11] own Direction in life
[43:13] and he
[43:15] he brought forth uh
[43:19] a nature that you can determine your own
[43:22] discretion what you want to do where you
[43:24] want to go right
[43:26] in other words the control of your own
[43:29] seed that's what
[43:31] uh the most subtle Beast to the
[43:35] anointing of Satan got Eve to do was to
[43:38] take control of her own seed that she
[43:41] could bring forth her own seed by her
[43:43] will didn't need to wait for God didn't
[43:45] need to get any okay just do what you
[43:48] want to do
[43:51] and it's really the devil's discretion
[43:54] even though man thinks it's his own
[43:57] discretion
[43:59] true it just shows the unity between man
[44:02] and the devil an unconverted soul
[44:06] now this natural seed planted by the
[44:09] devil
[44:10] never becomes born again
[44:15] it may go through what looks like the
[44:17] stages of the new birth but the outs
[44:20] from the outside appearance
[44:22] in other words
[44:24] things may
[44:26] seem
[44:29] a church goer may even get baptized but
[44:33] all things don't become new
[44:39] and all things don't become of God
[44:43] so therefore it cannot be the seed of
[44:46] God right
[44:47] because we're just talking about two
[44:49] seeds
[44:50] no the the nature of the seed never ends
[44:55] up changing
[44:59] this we're talking about the two seeds
[45:01] that were sold one is spiritual one is
[45:04] natural the one that's spiritual it
[45:06] changes amen the one that's natural it
[45:09] doesn't change
[45:10] the nature inside never dies out so it
[45:14] remains a natural seed
[45:17] did you notice in this Parable why the
[45:21] enemy he couldn't just get his own land
[45:24] and sow his own seed
[45:28] well first of all the devil can't create
[45:30] right
[45:31] so he couldn't create
[45:34] a planet
[45:37] to put the seed in he couldn't create a
[45:39] sun to warm the seed he couldn't create
[45:42] water to give it moisture
[45:46] so he had to use
[45:48] he had to steal
[45:52] he didn't even ask God
[45:55] he just went and planted the seed
[46:00] the only thing the devil can create is a
[46:02] bad atmosphere
[46:04] a bad attitude and I don't care attitude
[46:09] so what does he do he uses God
[46:12] the ground was already prepared for seed
[46:15] the sun was already shining the moisture
[46:17] was available
[46:18] Satan just uses God to bring forth his
[46:21] own seed
[46:23] and you know what God just allows it
[46:26] Matthew 5 verse 45 Matthew 5 45 God
[46:30] maketh his son to rise unto evil and
[46:35] under good and sendeth Reign on the just
[46:37] and the unjust so
[46:40] God knows about this situation right
[46:45] right this is a a very important point
[46:48] and it takes
[46:49] the presence of God to bring forth both
[46:53] seeds
[46:55] remember that amen it takes the presence
[46:58] of God to bring forth both seeds
[47:03] take son takes the moisture and it
[47:07] brings forth both seeds it
[47:10] God is the only Giver of Life
[47:18] I don't care what seed you plant in the
[47:20] Earth
[47:21] in your garden the sun and the water
[47:25] will bring forth that seed no matter
[47:28] what the seed is
[47:33] what we need to roll plants is what we
[47:36] need to get a harvest brother Brandon
[47:37] said in the message Corinthians book of
[47:40] correction he said in the Holy Spirit
[47:42] kept speaking to me about that
[47:44] what is that
[47:46] I read it over and over and it was in
[47:48] the book of uh Hebrews
[47:52] and then a vision come and I saw the
[47:54] world standing before me turning
[47:57] it was all diced up
[47:59] and light plowed and ready for to plant
[48:02] and there went a man by in white sowing
[48:07] seeds and after he went around
[48:09] cultivating the Earth another man come
[48:12] in Black sowing seeds behind him and
[48:15] when the seeds
[48:17] that the good man sold come up was wheat
[48:20] and the bad the black men sold the seeds
[48:23] come up that was dressed in black it
[48:26] come up and it was Weeds
[48:28] and oh one was contrary to the other
[48:31] right
[48:32] and a great drought come in the vision
[48:35] and the little wheat bowed his head and
[48:38] it was just so thirsty for the for a
[48:40] drink
[48:41] and the weed bowed its head and it was
[48:44] thirsty for a drink
[48:46] and then a great Cloud came over
[48:49] and the rains come down and the little
[48:51] wheat raised up and began to scream
[48:54] praise the Lord praise the Lord it was
[48:57] so happy to get water amen and the
[49:00] little weed raised up and began to
[49:02] holler praise the Lord praise the Lord
[49:04] for the same water
[49:07] then I understood see there it is the
[49:10] holy spirit will fall but by their
[49:13] fruits you shall know them
[49:16] said the Lord Jesus
[49:18] not by the not by the reaction of the
[49:22] spirit
[49:23] whether they heal the sick or whether
[49:26] they speak with tongues or whether they
[49:28] sing in the spirit or whether they
[49:29] Rejoice this way or that way
[49:32] they can do all that and still be lost
[49:38] right it's your life within you a
[49:40] born-again experience
[49:43] we must be born again we cannot get to
[49:46] where we're wanting to without the
[49:48] nature change
[49:50] and it's something that we just got to
[49:52] be serious about and and God doesn't
[49:55] gift it and as we understand gifts right
[49:59] you got a hunger you got a thirst you
[50:02] got to be willing to die out you got to
[50:04] say God I want this more than anything
[50:06] yeah
[50:08] now Jesus tells about the meaning of the
[50:12] parable starting in uh verse 36 of
[50:15] Matthew 13
[50:16] verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude
[50:19] away and went into the house and his
[50:22] disciples came in unto him saying
[50:24] declare unto us the parable of the
[50:27] Terrors of the field and he answered and
[50:29] said unto them he that sold soweth the
[50:33] good seed is the son of man
[50:35] and the field is the world the good seed
[50:38] are the children of the Kingdom but the
[50:41] tares are the children of the wicked one
[50:45] the enemy that sold them is the devil
[50:48] the Harvest is the end of the world the
[50:51] reaper the reapers are the Angels
[50:54] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[50:56] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[50:58] end of this world
[51:01] the son of man shall send forth his
[51:04] angels and they Shall Gather out of his
[51:07] kingdom all things that offend in them
[51:09] which do iniquity and shall cast them
[51:12] into the furnace of fire there shall be
[51:15] wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall
[51:17] the righteous shine forth as the sun in
[51:20] the Kingdom of their father who have
[51:22] ears to hear Let Him hear so obviously
[51:27] everybody doesn't have ears to hear and
[51:31] that's why Jesus said actually he said
[51:33] that in every Church age for the last
[51:36] 2000 years
[51:37] and he that have ears to hear Let Him
[51:40] hear Jesus wants us to hear the truth he
[51:45] doesn't want us to have itching hears
[51:48] itching ears just wanting to hear it the
[51:51] way you want to hear to hear the type of
[51:53] message you want to have to hear the the
[51:56] type of preaching that you want
[52:01] you know we if we all wanted
[52:04] if we were all in charge of what we
[52:08] wanted the church what kind of preaching
[52:10] it would be it would all be different
[52:13] it would all be different because we all
[52:15] got different taste
[52:17] but we've got to trust the Lord
[52:21] God can use anybody to help anybody
[52:28] and it if we take that out of God's hand
[52:32] and say I cannot be helped because of
[52:36] this this this or that
[52:39] we're limiting God because God can do
[52:42] anything he can use anybody
[52:45] so we just must have confidence in
[52:47] hearing from God when we come to church
[52:53] to hear what the spirit is saying to the
[52:55] church now before we get into the nature
[52:57] of these seeds uh two different Sowers
[53:00] sold their own seeds
[53:04] and they had their own purpose and
[53:07] intention for sowing the seed I want to
[53:09] talk about this what was the purpose of
[53:12] planting their seeds well they both
[53:14] wanted a Harvest Right
[53:16] they wanted the fruit from the Harvest
[53:19] so let's take a look at God's purpose
[53:21] for planting the seed let's start with
[53:23] him first or Colossians chapter 1 verse
[53:27] 16 says all things
[53:29] were created by Him
[53:31] and for him
[53:33] so we see right here the reason he
[53:36] planted his seed was for him
[53:41] he did not plan it for somebody else
[53:44] right
[53:46] I think
[53:48] my wife was telling me that she planted
[53:52] some sort of hot peppers
[53:55] jalapeno peppers and she gave them away
[53:58] to our sister Tasha here
[54:01] and I said
[54:02] did you say one I kind of wanted one I
[54:05] didn't save any I didn't plant them for
[54:07] me she said
[54:11] but God planted the seeds for him
[54:16] in Revelations chapter 4 verse 5
[54:20] and the four beasts
[54:23] had each of them six wings about them
[54:26] and they were full of eyes within and
[54:29] the rest and they rest not day and night
[54:33] saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[54:37] which was which is and which is to come
[54:41] and when those beasts give glory and
[54:44] honor and thanks to him that set upon
[54:46] the throne who liveth forever and ever
[54:47] the four look at something else happened
[54:49] then Four and Twenty Elders fell down
[54:53] before him
[54:55] that sat on the throne and they
[54:57] worshiped him
[54:59] that liveth forever and ever and they
[55:01] cast their crowns Before the Throne
[55:03] saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive
[55:06] glory and honor and power for thou has
[55:10] created all things and for thy pleasure
[55:12] they are and were created
[55:17] amen now if he created the Heavenly Host
[55:20] to praise him to worship him to give him
[55:23] honor and power and to give them
[55:25] everything don't you think the seeds
[55:27] that he planted ought to be doing the
[55:29] same thing
[55:32] amen
[55:34] amen Revelations 5 verse 11.
[55:37] and I beheld and heard the voice of many
[55:40] angels round about The Throne of the
[55:42] Beast and the elders and the number of
[55:44] them was 10
[55:47] 000 times 10 000 and thousands of
[55:51] thousands
[55:53] now we're getting into lots of people
[55:56] here
[55:58] saying with a loud voice
[56:02] Worthy is the land that was slain to
[56:05] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[56:08] strength and honor and glory and
[56:10] blessings and every creature which is in
[56:14] heaven and on the earth and under the
[56:17] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[56:20] that are in them heard I sane blessing
[56:25] and honor and glory and power be unto
[56:27] him that saith on the throne and unto
[56:29] the lamb forever and ever
[56:33] and the four be said amen and the 420
[56:37] Elders fell down and worshiped him that
[56:39] liveth forever and ever I just can't
[56:41] imagine us going to heaven the seed of
[56:45] God and kind of sitting around and going
[56:47] what's going on hey what'd you hear
[56:49] about the news going on
[56:51] we were created to bring God our honor
[56:55] to bring him pleasure
[56:57] his seed is going to grow to bring
[57:02] pleasure to to his creator
[57:06] this is the sea that God has planted
[57:09] this is a a man a woman that's been born
[57:12] again he's things are no longer of his
[57:15] life but all things are of God Amen
[57:20] no the seed of God
[57:23] was planted by God to bring forth Glory
[57:27] unto God with our lives
[57:31] with our whole lives
[57:34] to give him our strength our power our
[57:39] might our time our abilities to increase
[57:43] his kingdom
[57:45] there's a purpose there
[57:48] the seed of God was planted by God to
[57:52] honor his name amen amen by doing all
[57:54] that we do in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:58] and we were planted by God to worship
[58:01] Him in spirit and in truth amen
[58:05] I'm sorry we were not planted for any
[58:07] other reasons
[58:12] to let our just like the Four and Twenty
[58:15] elders just like the Beast to let our
[58:19] will fall down to his will amen and let
[58:23] his will be done in our lives
[58:27] that's the kind of worship that he's
[58:29] looking for
[58:34] we were planted by God himself to bring
[58:36] forth pleasure unto him
[58:39] it's no longer just do what you want
[58:43] Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday is
[58:45] coming up oh yeah
[58:48] or Wednesday nights coming up no it's
[58:50] our whole life
[58:51] it's a it's a change
[58:54] you know when I first I went to a church
[58:58] like
[58:59] I grew up going to a church
[59:02] but I'll tell you when I met the truth
[59:05] in brother Johnson's Church
[59:08] everything changed every single thing
[59:11] changed
[59:14] and the things that did not change they
[59:16] were supposed to
[59:18] um
[59:22] eventually they've got to change
[59:25] they just got to
[59:27] we've we're going to become completely
[59:29] new creatures that should just make us
[59:30] so excited so happy so excited
[59:34] amen God can do it
[59:37] amen God can do it if the everything
[59:40] that you need to become all that you're
[59:43] to be to bring in pleasure lies inside
[59:45] of you just gonna lay in the presence of
[59:48] the Sun and and re-ripened amen
[59:52] amen now the purpose that Satan planted
[59:54] the natural seed was simply to steal
[59:57] worship from God
[1:00:00] I'm just trying to keep it real simple
[1:00:02] it was to steal the worship from God he
[1:00:06] was jealous of God receiving the worship
[1:00:08] he wanted to steal it away from him and
[1:00:11] by default Satan ends up
[1:00:15] foreign
[1:00:16] worship from God when we don't worship
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:25] this is there's no Switzerland here
[1:00:27] right there's good and evil
[1:00:30] there's worship God or we're not worship
[1:00:32] Him
[1:00:33] and that's all satan wanted to do
[1:00:36] he wanted
[1:00:38] to stop the worship that's all that was
[1:00:41] going on in heaven
[1:00:42] [Laughter]
[1:00:45] worshiping with their wings and praising
[1:00:48] and holy holy going out all the time
[1:00:50] time after a while he said you know I
[1:00:52] think I should get some of this stuff
[1:00:56] and just by default when he got one of
[1:00:59] the angels to just
[1:01:01] stop for a little bit
[1:01:04] that made him feel real good
[1:01:07] that made Satan feel real good when he
[1:01:10] got some of the angels to stop
[1:01:13] worshiping
[1:01:16] because they were doing the will
[1:01:19] of Saint Lucifer
[1:01:21] right you understand
[1:01:23] so when we're not worshiping we're doing
[1:01:26] the will of Lucifer
[1:01:28] ah I'm just trying to bring some light
[1:01:31] of how important it is for us to worship
[1:01:34] God and and not just stay in a kind of a
[1:01:38] neutral zone of of of God knows my heart
[1:01:42] yes God knows your heart but he wants
[1:01:44] you to worship him he wants you to
[1:01:46] praise him all ye that have breath
[1:01:48] praise ye the Lord
[1:01:54] we notice in the world
[1:01:56] that the people worship everything
[1:02:01] sports teams
[1:02:02] players musicians movie stars
[1:02:05] men and women who have achieved great
[1:02:08] things they will stand and they will
[1:02:11] applaud and they will paint their faces
[1:02:13] and they will get naked and they'll do
[1:02:15] everything to get excited and we come to
[1:02:19] church and we got frowns on her face
[1:02:22] and we don't understand why we're not so
[1:02:25] happy
[1:02:27] God created us to bring pleasure to him
[1:02:33] when you're when you're in church here
[1:02:36] and you're worshiping who cares about
[1:02:38] anybody else
[1:02:40] and who cares about what anybody's
[1:02:42] thinking amen amen because you're here
[1:02:44] for one purpose and that's to glorify
[1:02:46] God
[1:02:48] it's all that matters and if we all did
[1:02:50] that pretty soon we wouldn't really
[1:02:52] matter what was what was happening with
[1:02:55] anybody else and God inhabits the
[1:02:58] Praises of his people The More We Praise
[1:03:00] Him the more we can have it and I'll
[1:03:01] tell you when God's presence comes
[1:03:03] you're always happy
[1:03:04] you're always happy
[1:03:06] it does not matter honestly it does not
[1:03:09] matter if what he is speaking to you
[1:03:12] goes against the grain I've been there
[1:03:15] but when his presence is there it's like
[1:03:18] not an issue it's not an issue it's just
[1:03:21] when his presence is not there
[1:03:24] and you you hear
[1:03:26] that's why the Bible says speak the
[1:03:27] truth in love because you can really
[1:03:29] hurt somebody when you don't use love
[1:03:32] come on when God's presence is there
[1:03:35] it's just a beautiful
[1:03:37] beautiful
[1:03:39] but Satan has stolen away the worship
[1:03:42] from God in the church
[1:03:45] not just out there in the world
[1:03:47] and all these things that are happening
[1:03:49] in their worshiping
[1:03:51] everything else and they'll go and
[1:03:53] they'll give three hours to some
[1:03:56] football game
[1:03:58] but they won't go to church and lift
[1:04:00] their hands say I love you Jesus
[1:04:02] what is going on
[1:04:06] sees Satan the people in the world are
[1:04:09] blinded but the church shouldn't be
[1:04:12] blinded
[1:04:13] the church their eyes should be open
[1:04:16] that this is God's house this is his
[1:04:18] Sanctuary this is a many of Heaven
[1:04:22] this is the place where we come and
[1:04:25] worship Him from the dictates of our
[1:04:26] heart we give thanks to what he's done
[1:04:29] for us what he's given to us we can't
[1:04:32] out give out thank out worship god
[1:04:35] he has saved our soul and I'll be
[1:04:39] forever in debt for that
[1:04:42] he should receive our praise on a
[1:04:44] regular basis
[1:04:48] people refuse to worship God
[1:04:52] with all that's within him
[1:04:55] here we read about the Angels doing it
[1:04:57] day and night and
[1:04:58] people struggle
[1:05:00] some sit right in church expecting God
[1:05:03] to bless them
[1:05:05] without blessing God
[1:05:09] we all want God to bless us
[1:05:11] but sometimes we don't we don't bless
[1:05:15] God and worship him for one reason
[1:05:23] it's not my song
[1:05:26] what about your relationship
[1:05:29] what about that why is your relationship
[1:05:32] on hold this is the place you can come
[1:05:34] and really let loose
[1:05:37] let loose
[1:05:39] it's hard to do it in a grocery store
[1:05:42] yeah
[1:05:42] or in your McDonald's line
[1:05:45] but I'll tell you in church you should
[1:05:47] be able to just be yourself
[1:05:49] worship God worship your creator your
[1:05:52] savior your Redeemer your healer your
[1:05:54] provider Jehovah worship Him
[1:05:57] because if you don't do it you're
[1:05:59] fulfilling the natural seed
[1:06:06] you're fulfilling the will and purpose
[1:06:10] in which the wicked one planted his
[1:06:13] seeds
[1:06:15] right
[1:06:18] I want to make the devil feel
[1:06:19] uncomfortable
[1:06:26] you know it's it's sad but some people
[1:06:28] they don't mind receiving praise
[1:06:32] from others
[1:06:34] but they have a hard time praising God
[1:06:36] what is that
[1:06:38] what is that
[1:06:42] we've got to recognize what's going on
[1:06:45] I'll just say it real clear you were
[1:06:48] created to worship God to bring him
[1:06:50] pleasure let's practice it let's work on
[1:06:53] it let's work on it
[1:06:55] please him well brother John how do I do
[1:06:57] that well let's start by getting on our
[1:07:00] knees and say God I want to do that
[1:07:03] you know Express the desire to him he
[1:07:05] will tell you what to do when his
[1:07:07] presence come you can't help but praise
[1:07:08] him
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:17] I don't want to achieve or fulfill
[1:07:20] Satan's purpose that's right and
[1:07:23] understand we go through trials we go
[1:07:25] through tests sometimes we're sick
[1:07:26] sometimes we're just not doing well
[1:07:29] that's the time to offer a greater
[1:07:31] sacrifice
[1:07:33] a greater sacrifice because the greater
[1:07:35] the sacrifice we read the prophet said
[1:07:37] the greater the reward
[1:07:42] God's purpose for planting his seed is
[1:07:44] to bring forth pleasure no wonder all of
[1:07:47] Heaven fell down and worshiped him that
[1:07:50] liveth forever and ever say and Worthy
[1:07:52] is the land that was slain
[1:07:55] I don't think it was a One-Shot deal I
[1:07:58] don't think it was a Netflix movie one
[1:08:00] time back in the 50s or 60s and no it's
[1:08:04] all the time he's worthy all the time
[1:08:07] he's a present God Amen not a past but a
[1:08:11] present God Amen
[1:08:15] praise did you know the Bible says that
[1:08:18] praise is actually perfected in the
[1:08:21] young plants
[1:08:23] you don't even got to be a full mature
[1:08:26] wheat to bring perfect praise to God
[1:08:31] you got to do is from the depths of your
[1:08:33] heart mean it
[1:08:35] as simple that's very simple you don't
[1:08:39] even gotta all you gotta do is get try
[1:08:40] just I Love You Lord and mean it from
[1:08:43] the dust your heart and he receives that
[1:08:47] receives it
[1:08:49] praise is so important to God that he
[1:08:53] literally will command the rocks to
[1:08:56] praise him if we don't think about how
[1:08:58] important it is to God it may not seem
[1:09:00] like important to us or we don't feel
[1:09:02] like doing it but that doesn't mean God
[1:09:04] don't want it right
[1:09:06] right he makes everything to praise him
[1:09:08] I believe the Bible talks about the
[1:09:10] leaves they clap their hands when the
[1:09:12] wind's going through the trees
[1:09:17] sometimes I think we need to change our
[1:09:19] attitude in the church
[1:09:21] stop allowing the Devil to steal praise
[1:09:23] away from God just because the way we
[1:09:25] feel
[1:09:27] if we're here if we come here let's just
[1:09:30] Praise Him
[1:09:32] will we sing a song wherever I am I'll
[1:09:34] praise him whenever I can I'll praise
[1:09:35] him
[1:09:36] He's Worthy
[1:09:38] Psalms 34 Verse 1. now this is what
[1:09:42] happened when David changed
[1:09:45] his attitude his behavior this is what
[1:09:49] he said and this is all we need to do I
[1:09:52] Will Bless The Lord at all times
[1:09:55] his praise shall continually be in my
[1:09:58] mouth
[1:09:59] my soul shall make her boast in the Lord
[1:10:01] The Humble shall hear thereof and be
[1:10:03] glad notice who is going to be happy
[1:10:05] about praise
[1:10:06] the humble
[1:10:09] not the proud the proud don't want to
[1:10:13] the proud are too proud
[1:10:15] oh magnify the Lord with me and let us
[1:10:18] exalt his name together
[1:10:22] Psalms 149 verse 1 praise ye the Lord
[1:10:25] sing unto the Lord a new song his praise
[1:10:28] and his praise where in the congregation
[1:10:32] of the Saints right where we're at
[1:10:35] right where we're at I think we've got
[1:10:38] scripture on what we're talking about
[1:10:40] here we got scripture
[1:10:42] no
[1:10:44] Hebrews chapter 13.
[1:10:46] verse 15 we know that Abel offered unto
[1:10:50] God a more excellent sacrifice right
[1:10:52] the scripture says let us offer the
[1:10:55] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[1:10:59] oh so we're like out there saying holy
[1:11:01] holy holy holy
[1:11:03] well you've been granted an opportunity
[1:11:07] to praise God in so many different ways
[1:11:12] let us offer the sacrifice see it's the
[1:11:15] sacrifice of praise to God continue that
[1:11:16] is the fruit of our lips giving thanks
[1:11:20] to his name amen now look at this next
[1:11:22] verse but to do good and communicate
[1:11:24] forget not for what such sacrifices God
[1:11:28] is well pleased God does not want you to
[1:11:32] forget to communicate with him
[1:11:36] he wants you to remember to communicate
[1:11:39] with him right
[1:11:41] it's it's a sacrifice that's well
[1:11:44] pleasing to God
[1:11:46] I think uh too many people forget to
[1:11:49] give thanks
[1:11:50] they forget to continually I'm here to
[1:11:52] Worship the Lord their mind is on so
[1:11:55] many other things you know what it's
[1:11:56] just get your mind on the Lord
[1:11:59] it doesn't matter if
[1:12:02] whatever's going on what's important is
[1:12:05] the Lord
[1:12:07] now we are not natural plants who refuse
[1:12:10] to praise God we're spiritual plants of
[1:12:13] God who can't wait to get to the house
[1:12:16] of church
[1:12:18] to worship Him
[1:12:20] we can't wait to get there
[1:12:22] it I'll tell you worship starts way
[1:12:24] before you get here and I'll tell you if
[1:12:26] you're doing what you need to be doing
[1:12:27] when you're not here when you get here
[1:12:28] you usually end up doing what you should
[1:12:30] be doing
[1:12:31] it's true it's true you're preparing
[1:12:37] you were never planted to do your own
[1:12:39] will
[1:12:41] nor to worship him at your own will
[1:12:48] because look my flesh if I yield to that
[1:12:51] will
[1:12:52] it may only want to worship
[1:12:55] once in a while
[1:12:57] but he didn't create a born-again son
[1:13:01] and daughter of God to worship him three
[1:13:04] times a week
[1:13:07] no
[1:13:09] no we're different
[1:13:11] we're different
[1:13:13] should always be a song of Praise on
[1:13:15] Earth on our our heart amen
[1:13:20] when I was in the world I'll tell you
[1:13:22] what I never worship God
[1:13:24] I didn't feel like it
[1:13:26] I exercised my own will and my will said
[1:13:29] I didn't want to I felt uncomfortable
[1:13:31] it's weird
[1:13:32] what do you mean I when I was growing up
[1:13:35] in my house uh you know my mom and dad
[1:13:38] they didn't get me and sent me around
[1:13:39] and say let's worship God it was so when
[1:13:41] I came into church and they were
[1:13:43] worshiping God this is weird
[1:13:46] I'm just being honest
[1:13:51] but when things begin to change
[1:13:55] all sudden
[1:13:57] you start counting your blessings
[1:14:01] you'll be surprised what God's done for
[1:14:03] you
[1:14:04] and then you you can't stop saying thank
[1:14:07] you Lord
[1:14:09] amen you find so many things to praise
[1:14:11] him for see to me it's it's more of an
[1:14:15] attitude
[1:14:17] it's really it's an attitude and if your
[1:14:20] attitude is I I I'm in Love with You
[1:14:22] Lord Nothing Else Matters you're just
[1:14:25] praising because he's worthy of all
[1:14:27] praise and all glory amen
[1:14:30] God planted us for his purpose and not
[1:14:33] ours
[1:14:36] now there are some similarities and
[1:14:38] differences in these two plants in many
[1:14:40] ways it's difficult to tell them apart
[1:14:42] one from another
[1:14:44] before wheat produces fruit the tares
[1:14:47] can look identical to the wheat
[1:14:50] in the spring wheat and tears end up
[1:14:53] growing together
[1:14:54] the tears naturally grow faster than the
[1:14:57] wheat did you know that
[1:14:59] and in fact they can grow
[1:15:03] uh bigger and their arms stretch out
[1:15:06] further and they can actually cover the
[1:15:08] wheat yes
[1:15:09] and and and and make it harder for the
[1:15:12] wheat to grow
[1:15:15] so you can't look at
[1:15:19] somebody and say man they're growing so
[1:15:21] fast
[1:15:23] that's not a that's not a
[1:15:26] uh identification
[1:15:29] come on
[1:15:35] the truth is that there are times that
[1:15:37] the tares are taller stronger and
[1:15:40] healthier than the wheat
[1:15:45] look at Matthew chapter 7.
[1:15:47] it wasn't until the fruit of the two
[1:15:50] plants began to bear
[1:15:53] the fruit that you could tell the
[1:15:55] difference
[1:15:56] and in Matthew chapter 7 verse 17 even
[1:15:59] so
[1:16:01] Jesus said
[1:16:02] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[1:16:04] good fruit
[1:16:06] but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[1:16:08] fruit
[1:16:09] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[1:16:13] fruit neither can a crop tree bring
[1:16:15] forth good fruit every tree that
[1:16:17] bringeth not forth good fruit is You
[1:16:19] Down cast in the fire whereby
[1:16:22] wherefore by their fruits you're going
[1:16:26] to know them
[1:16:29] look at the very next verse
[1:16:33] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[1:16:35] Lord's under the kingdom of heaven but
[1:16:36] he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:16:38] which is in heaven the fruit of the
[1:16:41] wheat is to do the will of their father
[1:16:44] amen
[1:16:45] amen because he planted them for his
[1:16:48] purpose
[1:16:53] now we've got a fruit of the spirit
[1:16:57] but we're talking about the fruit of the
[1:17:01] wheat
[1:17:02] yes the fruit of God working in a person
[1:17:05] is love joy peace long-suffering and it
[1:17:08] it that is
[1:17:11] the Holy Spirit
[1:17:13] in his different ways
[1:17:16] but that same Spirit can be on the good
[1:17:19] and the evil produced the same thing and
[1:17:23] yet not be
[1:17:27] the fruit that God's that Jesus is
[1:17:30] referring to here the wheat must do the
[1:17:34] will of God that's all there is to it
[1:17:37] that's the fruit he's looking for
[1:17:39] it and of course if if the will of God
[1:17:42] is to love and to cover your brother and
[1:17:47] to lay down your life and all the things
[1:17:49] the prophet said and all the things
[1:17:50] that's what you do
[1:17:53] you live peaceably with all men you yes
[1:17:56] you're going to Bear the fruit of the
[1:17:58] spirit but you understand you can't just
[1:18:00] go by the times that God has used
[1:18:04] somebody his anointing the rain the
[1:18:07] falls on the just and the unjust and the
[1:18:10] Sunshine they're both growing they're
[1:18:12] both praising you can't go by that
[1:18:16] you go by one thing
[1:18:19] the fruit of obeying the word of God
[1:18:22] is that important
[1:18:25] we we got to we've got to pay attention
[1:18:28] to what's important to God that's the
[1:18:30] fruit he said when he said You shall
[1:18:32] know them by your fruit look there's
[1:18:34] many false prophets
[1:18:36] we heard about and we had a wonderful
[1:18:39] Bible men's meeting today did we not
[1:18:41] Brothers
[1:18:43] and and there's Satan can uh transform
[1:18:46] himself into an angel of Light we heard
[1:18:50] but he can't do the will of God
[1:18:54] he don't want to honor him and praise
[1:18:56] him and worship Him from with his life
[1:19:00] with obedience to the word
[1:19:03] so
[1:19:04] it's important that we understand we we
[1:19:08] all are the seed of God here
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:13] amen okay what we what we've been
[1:19:15] planted for is to follow this word and
[1:19:20] to bring pleasure by obeying this word
[1:19:22] he says if you love me keep my
[1:19:24] Commandments
[1:19:31] foreign
[1:19:34] I'm not going to go over Galatians 5 22.
[1:19:38] but you can read it if you want to
[1:19:40] sometime it
[1:19:43] I I probably should read it just so we
[1:19:45] can so you can see Galatians 5 22 says
[1:19:48] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:19:49] peace long suffering gentleness goodness
[1:19:51] Faith meeting his Temperance against
[1:19:53] such there is no law
[1:19:55] but we know that God's presence falls on
[1:19:58] both the just and the unjust and can act
[1:20:01] very similar
[1:20:05] we can feel that awesome presence of God
[1:20:07] in our lives at times but it doesn't
[1:20:09] mean that we're bearing the fruit of
[1:20:10] obeying God's will
[1:20:13] I think that we got to remember
[1:20:14] but look at verse 24 it tells us about
[1:20:17] the seed of God here but they that are
[1:20:19] Christ
[1:20:21] have what crucified the flesh with the
[1:20:25] affections and the lust so if we live in
[1:20:28] the spirit let's walk in the spirit
[1:20:29] let's not be desirous now look at here's
[1:20:32] the natural going back to the Natural
[1:20:34] seed if you don't crucify the flesh
[1:20:36] you'll be desirers of vainglory you'll
[1:20:39] be provoking one another you'll be
[1:20:41] envying one another and that is what the
[1:20:45] natural seed does
[1:20:47] all right Matthew 24. now we're told in
[1:20:50] the last days that the two crops would
[1:20:52] be impossible for the foolish virgin to
[1:20:56] dify
[1:20:57] deficiate no
[1:21:00] yeah that's it that's the word I'm
[1:21:02] looking for
[1:21:03] the foolish version it's not going to be
[1:21:06] able to know the difference there's only
[1:21:08] one group of people
[1:21:10] Matthew 24 22 and accept those days be
[1:21:13] shortened
[1:21:14] there should be no flesh say but for the
[1:21:16] elect's sake
[1:21:17] those days shall be shortened thank the
[1:21:20] lord it's getting terrible out there
[1:21:22] then if any man shall say unto you Lo
[1:21:24] here's Christ or no look there is Christ
[1:21:29] believe it not
[1:21:32] for there shall arise false Christ false
[1:21:36] prophets and shall show Great Signs
[1:21:41] now that means if you look that up it
[1:21:43] means Supernatural miracles
[1:21:45] and wonders that's people who are in
[1:21:49] doubt and dude endowed with exceptional
[1:21:52] qualities or abilities
[1:21:55] that's that wonders people can do
[1:21:58] wondrous things in so much to the
[1:22:01] highest degree that if it were possible
[1:22:03] they shall deceive the very elect
[1:22:09] that the scripture says the elite can't
[1:22:12] be deceived
[1:22:15] something about the elect when they hear
[1:22:18] the word
[1:22:20] when they hear the word
[1:22:22] they're attracted to it yeah
[1:22:26] yeah they
[1:22:29] they want that manifested in them
[1:22:33] that's what they're wanting
[1:22:35] they because Jesus said man shall not
[1:22:37] live by brother but by every word that
[1:22:39] proceedeth out of the mouth of God the
[1:22:42] bride is attracted to the word but see
[1:22:44] so many other people are attracted
[1:22:48] to the Miracles
[1:22:51] to the signs
[1:22:53] to the to the individuals who can do
[1:22:56] wondrous things
[1:22:58] but for some reason they don't check out
[1:23:01] to see
[1:23:03] if they're doing the will of God in
[1:23:05] their life
[1:23:06] yeah it didn't meant didn't Jesus say
[1:23:08] man you'll come to me in that day and
[1:23:09] say Lord Lord what about all these
[1:23:11] things I did
[1:23:12] right but they did not do the will of
[1:23:14] God
[1:23:16] and that's the fruit
[1:23:18] that he's looking for amen are you with
[1:23:20] me yes sir
[1:23:22] God wants us focusing on the fruit
[1:23:26] Satan wants us focusing on all the
[1:23:29] Miracles
[1:23:31] on the signs
[1:23:34] I mean you talk to the people in the
[1:23:35] world and they're always talking about
[1:23:37] signs
[1:23:39] try to talk to them about the word Jesus
[1:23:42] Christ is the word they're not even
[1:23:43] interested
[1:23:44] but I want to talk about this thing that
[1:23:46] happened
[1:23:47] what about this this change happening in
[1:23:51] you want to talk about that
[1:23:54] it's just that people are not focusing
[1:23:56] on the right thing and that's what Satan
[1:23:58] wants them to do they Satan wants them
[1:23:59] to get focused on other things
[1:24:04] now whatever his word says the elect are
[1:24:07] interested in it
[1:24:09] they're interested in obeying the word
[1:24:12] that they're not oh gain
[1:24:15] amen catch what I'm saying there it's
[1:24:18] easy to say Amen I've been baptized
[1:24:20] right
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:22] but how about amen you need to start
[1:24:25] because you're not doing that yet or you
[1:24:27] need to stop doing this because you are
[1:24:29] doing that still
[1:24:31] see the bride is interested in the part
[1:24:33] that she's not obeying
[1:24:35] because that's one way she's going to
[1:24:37] get complete see
[1:24:40] no wonder the prophet said we come to
[1:24:43] church to find out where we're at with
[1:24:44] him
[1:24:45] they're focusing on the part that
[1:24:47] they're not that's not connected yet the
[1:24:50] holy spirit is still leading all of us
[1:24:52] into all truth
[1:24:54] amen not just the the truth of of that
[1:24:57] God sent a prophet and but what did that
[1:25:00] Prophet say
[1:25:01] you know dig it into the word
[1:25:04] amen as the two plants mature it's much
[1:25:07] easier to see the fruit that they're
[1:25:09] bearing
[1:25:11] now the fruit of the wheat
[1:25:14] is so heavy
[1:25:16] it they when you look at a mature Wheat
[1:25:20] Field
[1:25:20] all the wheat is bowed
[1:25:24] you look at a mature Terror and it's
[1:25:27] sticking straight up proud as a peacock
[1:25:30] it just has it just doesn't want to bow
[1:25:36] but I believe a mature Christian is
[1:25:39] always humble
[1:25:41] they're bearing bearing deck because
[1:25:43] just like we read
[1:25:46] the elders they bow down and they
[1:25:49] worshiped
[1:25:50] uh
[1:25:52] what a I believe the wheat that he
[1:25:55] planted is also going to Bow before him
[1:25:59] yeah he's going to honor him
[1:26:01] gonna let him be first in their lives
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:06] now although different the two seeds
[1:26:09] look similar on the outside but on the
[1:26:11] inside of the terror
[1:26:13] there's a little black seed
[1:26:16] and if you eat them it'll literally
[1:26:19] cause dizziness
[1:26:21] and nauseousness
[1:26:23] it'll cause you to be nauseous
[1:26:25] and I'm going to be honest with you I'm
[1:26:27] sure you've all experienced this
[1:26:28] spending some time fellowshipping
[1:26:32] with the wrong
[1:26:35] group
[1:26:36] and you get done and you feel a little
[1:26:39] dizzy
[1:26:41] you feel a little nauseous
[1:26:44] from what was just talked about
[1:26:48] are you with me
[1:26:49] so you need to make sure that you don't
[1:26:52] partake
[1:26:53] of the wrong
[1:26:55] influences amen
[1:26:58] now the tendency that people have in
[1:27:00] church is to weed out the terrors
[1:27:04] I mean that's exactly what the parable
[1:27:06] said in fact
[1:27:11] you think of a church you think well
[1:27:13] church should be this way there
[1:27:15] shouldn't it should be holy there should
[1:27:17] be all good people that go there
[1:27:19] and uh they should never do bad things
[1:27:22] and if if you hear one bad thing about
[1:27:25] anybody going to church well they're
[1:27:27] just an outright hypocrite
[1:27:30] right
[1:27:32] so the natural tendency is when there's
[1:27:36] something that's not right
[1:27:38] with someone in the church you need to
[1:27:41] rip that thing out
[1:27:43] right
[1:27:45] that's that's what that's
[1:27:47] that's the tendency I mean you think
[1:27:49] about when you have a garden weeds are
[1:27:51] coming up you don't want the weeds there
[1:27:52] you go on you pull the weeds out
[1:27:55] people look for things that don't belong
[1:27:58] in a church
[1:28:01] should be filled with only wheat
[1:28:06] kind nice people
[1:28:08] who care about me
[1:28:11] who want to help me
[1:28:13] who are concerned about me who lay down
[1:28:15] their life for me
[1:28:17] I feel it's all about me
[1:28:22] I come to church for me
[1:28:25] so when people aren't being good
[1:28:29] I think they shouldn't be allowed here
[1:28:35] big time brother big time
[1:28:38] but understand these are thoughts when
[1:28:41] we have thoughts about oh I just don't
[1:28:43] feel comfortable there I don't feel like
[1:28:47] being around that per that person that
[1:28:49] is a bad representation of the church
[1:28:52] you understand we have those thoughts of
[1:28:54] of wanting to that something's wrong and
[1:28:58] Jesus says let them both grow together
[1:29:02] don't be thinking like that
[1:29:06] they're there they're here
[1:29:08] they're here
[1:29:10] and they're
[1:29:12] supposed to be here
[1:29:14] the instructions are let them both grow
[1:29:17] together until the time of the Harvest
[1:29:21] we don't want to judge people
[1:29:25] we don't want to try pulling the weed
[1:29:28] out
[1:29:31] brother brother John what are we to do
[1:29:33] then grow in Grace
[1:29:35] right grow in love
[1:29:38] grow help lay down your life you can
[1:29:41] still be Christ to everybody we're
[1:29:43] supposed to be
[1:29:46] amen this message is not to start trying
[1:29:48] to pinpoint who the Terrors are and who
[1:29:51] the weed is this message is to help us
[1:29:54] not think
[1:29:55] negatively about others and grow
[1:29:57] together even if whoever they are
[1:30:01] are you with me
[1:30:04] can you say Amen to them
[1:30:06] God has called us to be fruit inspectors
[1:30:10] and then after we inspect the fruit you
[1:30:12] know what he says go lay down your life
[1:30:18] and if you don't want to do that
[1:30:21] then your church
[1:30:23] and God's Church
[1:30:24] are different churches
[1:30:28] I'm just saying God's will for his
[1:30:30] church is to allow tears and wheat to
[1:30:32] grow together in the same church
[1:30:35] until he sends his angels to separate
[1:30:39] them
[1:30:44] the servants should we go gather them up
[1:30:47] Nay last thou yes while you gather up
[1:30:50] the tears you root up the wheat with
[1:30:52] them
[1:30:53] all of our roots are intertwined we
[1:30:56] fellowship with one another
[1:30:58] and to be honest with you we kind of
[1:31:00] know one another's
[1:31:02] problems
[1:31:07] it might just
[1:31:10] we do
[1:31:11] and we we kind of have these ideas that
[1:31:14] this person shouldn't do that
[1:31:18] and they should know better
[1:31:22] so what help them
[1:31:25] help them if if there's a need help if
[1:31:28] you don't know how to help then get on
[1:31:29] your knees
[1:31:30] but to do anything different is wrong
[1:31:34] to talk about it to do nothing it's
[1:31:36] wrong
[1:31:37] the least you do is pray until God tells
[1:31:40] you what to do
[1:31:42] because you know God is in the business
[1:31:44] of perfecting us
[1:31:46] he the only time
[1:31:49] that he's going to get away and and go
[1:31:51] on that
[1:31:54] high wire is when our nature
[1:31:57] is so we got a such a wrong Spirit on us
[1:32:02] but as soon as that thing leaves the
[1:32:04] Holy Spirit comes back and he begins to
[1:32:06] lead and guide us into all truth now I
[1:32:08] believe that's what his that's what we
[1:32:10] are to do with one another to grow to
[1:32:12] grow together to help one another
[1:32:15] now we we obviously we've got to learn
[1:32:18] you think about this when your children
[1:32:20] were young you could spank them I was
[1:32:23] talking to brother Johnson today and he
[1:32:25] was telling me his his birthday he's
[1:32:27] going to be 90 years old on November 6th
[1:32:29] praise the Lord
[1:32:32] and the first thing I said to him I said
[1:32:34] well brother Johnson you must have
[1:32:35] honored your mother and your father
[1:32:38] because the promise is you get long life
[1:32:42] and but he says well one thing to help
[1:32:44] me was I I got a good Whip and I I I I
[1:32:50] I I I I I I
[1:32:51] got whipped if I didn't do the right
[1:32:53] thing or something along those lines and
[1:32:54] this is when I say when our children are
[1:32:56] younger sorry if I didn't say that just
[1:32:58] write brother Johnson
[1:32:59] when we were younger I could spank my
[1:33:02] children
[1:33:03] and tell them you're going to do what I
[1:33:04] tell you to do or you're going to get
[1:33:05] another one and they would somebody do
[1:33:07] it
[1:33:09] but you know when they turned 17 years
[1:33:11] old
[1:33:13] you don't walk around with the belt
[1:33:15] going like this like some cowboy
[1:33:20] you have to learn to work
[1:33:24] without that manipulative fear
[1:33:27] and that's what we need to learn to do
[1:33:29] as a church
[1:33:31] we don't just
[1:33:33] throw the word at somebody and say no
[1:33:37] no we need we need to love
[1:33:40] show love behind what we're trying to
[1:33:43] help that person with are you with me
[1:33:45] grow together in Christ
[1:33:48] praise the Lord
[1:33:50] no if someone's trying to yank you
[1:33:54] out of their Circle brother Bynum told
[1:33:57] us just draw a bigger Circle you're
[1:33:58] going to have the carnal seed you know
[1:34:02] bring it up stuff and trying to do stuff
[1:34:05] you just draw a bigger Circle you be
[1:34:08] Christ to them no matter what
[1:34:10] come on we should have heard more amens
[1:34:13] on that one
[1:34:15] let's grow together until the time of
[1:34:18] the Harvest the quicker we can accept
[1:34:20] that both the wheat and the tares are
[1:34:22] meant to be inside the church
[1:34:25] the better we're going to be
[1:34:27] the better we're going to be
[1:34:29] God doesn't want isms and schisms in the
[1:34:33] church body
[1:34:34] he doesn't need you telling others about
[1:34:37] Who's acting like a terror in the church
[1:34:42] the spirit of Christ doesn't need your
[1:34:44] knowledge of people's faults spreading
[1:34:46] around
[1:34:48] God doesn't need your negative opinions
[1:34:51] floating around
[1:34:53] right God doesn't need us dividing the
[1:34:56] body into sections just because
[1:35:00] something is wrong
[1:35:09] if something's wrong help what's wrong
[1:35:12] don't separate and try to get somebody
[1:35:14] else to separate right all you're going
[1:35:16] to do is bring disunity to the body
[1:35:21] and the devil will get you to do it
[1:35:23] because he's going to tell you you're
[1:35:25] spiritual you're right you know God
[1:35:28] showed you
[1:35:30] yeah that's right division
[1:35:33] you know the prophet said it Paul said
[1:35:35] it
[1:35:35] that
[1:35:37] you're one happy body right now but
[1:35:40] Satan won't allow it to stay that way
[1:35:45] so something's coming
[1:35:47] as sure as anything something is coming
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:51] amen so what are we going to do when
[1:35:52] it's come are we going to all look up to
[1:35:54] the pastor you've got to Rally everybody
[1:35:56] together
[1:35:58] that's not what the prophet said that's
[1:36:00] not what Paul said
[1:36:02] we have to learn to stick together
[1:36:05] we have to learn to love one another to
[1:36:08] pray for one another to cover one
[1:36:10] another
[1:36:12] I mean this is what training is all
[1:36:15] about and then when we're out of the
[1:36:17] church and we're communicate with one
[1:36:18] another talking on the phone and tell
[1:36:20] that's the time that you put into action
[1:36:22] what you're hearing about
[1:36:24] the brand said that there's three types
[1:36:26] of believers
[1:36:27] in every Church
[1:36:29] the unbeliever the make-believer and the
[1:36:31] believer
[1:36:32] now the genuine believer
[1:36:37] not only believes the complete word of
[1:36:39] God
[1:36:40] but he follows the word of God
[1:36:45] remember the devil's believe
[1:36:48] right so there's a similarity between
[1:36:50] the devils and the believer
[1:36:52] they both believe
[1:36:55] and there's another similar did you know
[1:36:57] that
[1:36:58] they both tremble
[1:37:01] the Bible says the devil believes and
[1:37:04] trembles
[1:37:05] but according to Philippians chapter 2
[1:37:08] verse 12 about write it down that we're
[1:37:11] to work out our own salvation with fear
[1:37:14] and trembling
[1:37:17] amen so we tremble for another reason
[1:37:19] because we don't want to displease God
[1:37:22] but see the reason they tremble is
[1:37:25] because they know they're not obeying
[1:37:27] their time is short and they're going to
[1:37:29] hell that's just that simple that's why
[1:37:31] they they they fear
[1:37:36] now the unbeliever that's in the church
[1:37:38] well he believes in God or he wouldn't
[1:37:42] be in church
[1:37:44] so he believes
[1:37:46] part
[1:37:48] but he does not believe all
[1:37:51] there's that's the unbeliever
[1:37:54] think about that he's not just the the
[1:37:59] atheist I'm oh I hate God don't believe
[1:38:03] God there's nothing by it so don't hey I
[1:38:06] got to go to church
[1:38:09] he's there's nobody that hates God or
[1:38:14] doesn't believe in God and says I got to
[1:38:16] go to church Faithfully
[1:38:18] you understand so it's got to be
[1:38:21] something that's closer
[1:38:25] so the Devils believe
[1:38:27] they got that knowledge of the reality
[1:38:30] in that Realm
[1:38:32] but they don't submit
[1:38:35] now the unbeliever he
[1:38:37] has uh could I'll say it like this could
[1:38:41] have a belief in some of the word but
[1:38:44] not all the word so the TR the part here
[1:38:46] is that he doesn't believe part I just
[1:38:48] don't believe that I believe the days of
[1:38:50] Miracles are passed
[1:38:52] I don't believe it
[1:38:55] you understand
[1:38:57] now the make-believer he makes the
[1:39:00] leaves that all the word of God
[1:39:05] in other words he could say Amen to
[1:39:07] every word of God
[1:39:09] but he doesn't submit to it
[1:39:14] so that's the mate that's the mate
[1:39:15] believer
[1:39:17] so they're not like you know big stamps
[1:39:19] on our forehead but understand this
[1:39:21] they're all allowed in the church
[1:39:23] because brother Brian said they're in
[1:39:24] every Church
[1:39:25] they're in every Church
[1:39:27] so the tears of hair we're a mixed group
[1:39:30] but we have to believe when we look at
[1:39:33] one another we're we're speaking to the
[1:39:35] elect of God here
[1:39:37] and we we treat one another like the the
[1:39:39] elect of God and when things happen that
[1:39:42] somebody didn't shake your hand right
[1:39:44] and somebody didn't they said this about
[1:39:46] you and they did this and they didn't
[1:39:48] let you in your circle and they cut you
[1:39:50] out you know what I don't want to hear
[1:39:53] it because you heard the word today
[1:39:56] you heard the word today what you're
[1:39:58] supposed to do now mature now mature if
[1:40:01] you're a wheat do the mature thing bow
[1:40:03] your head
[1:40:05] bow your head
[1:40:08] draw a bigger and just grow in Grace
[1:40:10] with the tears grow in Grace with the
[1:40:13] tares because that was what Jesus told
[1:40:15] us to do
[1:40:16] I just say you know we're without excuse
[1:40:19] here no matter what happens in this
[1:40:21] church we ought to be the happiest bunch
[1:40:25] because we're going to grow in Grace
[1:40:27] we're going to grow together
[1:40:35] just want two more scriptures here we're
[1:40:36] going to close one is Hebrews chapter 6
[1:40:38] verse 7.
[1:40:42] let's focus on manifesting the part of
[1:40:45] Christ that we're not
[1:40:48] to become more of a Believer basically
[1:40:52] press toward the mark lay aside
[1:40:55] everything until you get
[1:40:56] perfect love
[1:40:59] for the tares
[1:41:06] we gotta love our enemy Hebrews chapter
[1:41:08] 6 verse 7 the Earth which drinketh in
[1:41:11] the rain
[1:41:11] that cometh often upon it and bringeth
[1:41:14] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[1:41:16] dressed receiveth blessing from God
[1:41:20] but they which bear thorns and Briars
[1:41:24] it's rejected
[1:41:26] and is nigh unto cursing whose and
[1:41:29] notice the end is to be burned it's at
[1:41:32] the end
[1:41:34] but beloved
[1:41:36] speaking to us here all of us but
[1:41:39] beloved
[1:41:41] we are persuaded better things of you
[1:41:45] and the things that accompany salvation
[1:41:49] though we thus speak
[1:41:52] Let There never ever be anything
[1:41:55] negatively spoken about anybody
[1:41:59] because there's better things that God
[1:42:01] expects of us
[1:42:03] his wheat
[1:42:05] sticks out
[1:42:07] they stick out just like God
[1:42:10] because they were created
[1:42:12] for a purpose
[1:42:13] now I'm saying if there's a need
[1:42:17] don't you just turn
[1:42:18] your your head away from it
[1:42:22] no if you see a need God is entrusted in
[1:42:25] you to do something yeah
[1:42:28] that's right that's right it start with
[1:42:31] prayer
[1:42:32] and and God give you Holy Ghost boldness
[1:42:36] to go wash somebody's feet and help them
[1:42:40] get them get them where they need to get
[1:42:43] to because if you just turn away say
[1:42:45] well you know just
[1:42:48] well how are you going to help the body
[1:42:49] the body is supposed to help the body
[1:42:51] function together
[1:42:54] see what we're hearing from the pulpit
[1:42:57] is what we're to become
[1:43:00] it's not what we are right
[1:43:03] it's what we're in the process of
[1:43:05] becoming when the Bible says grow
[1:43:08] grow together or grow in Grace
[1:43:11] it's it's actually going somewhere that
[1:43:14] you are not
[1:43:16] and this helping one another needs to
[1:43:18] become
[1:43:19] more of a reality
[1:43:22] more of a reality
[1:43:24] yeah the church I go to they really love
[1:43:27] one you know how do you know they love
[1:43:29] one another because they help you when
[1:43:31] you're not doing well
[1:43:33] when you fall they help you get back up
[1:43:35] they they pray for you they intercede
[1:43:38] for you they they they they care and and
[1:43:41] they they want to they want to meet you
[1:43:43] in the prayer room
[1:43:46] t
[1:43:47] we're one body undivided
[1:43:51] we stand together we grow together
[1:43:55] and we we don't even care who we think a
[1:43:59] terror is or who's not a tear or who an
[1:44:01] unbeliever is or who a mate Believers we
[1:44:04] don't care
[1:44:07] only thing we want to do
[1:44:09] is be such a weak that we can help
[1:44:14] help the situation because what's
[1:44:17] already set is set there's never you're
[1:44:19] never going to go into if you went into
[1:44:21] a church that was perfect the second you
[1:44:23] walked in it would be polluted
[1:44:25] you're never going to find a church
[1:44:27] that's perfect
[1:44:28] but if we can all get the mindset of
[1:44:32] doing our job that God has told us to do
[1:44:34] we will become a better Church
[1:44:37] and the thing is if we have the attitude
[1:44:39] well you know it's not me it's always
[1:44:41] the other person I'm telling you you're
[1:44:43] you're in you're the greatest culprit
[1:44:45] right
[1:44:47] right because it doesn't matter who the
[1:44:49] worst person is or who's got the greater
[1:44:51] need God has called us all to help
[1:44:54] you see what I'm saying it's like
[1:44:57] there's no excuse for the Church of God
[1:44:59] there's no no excuse for the elect of
[1:45:01] God they won't be deceived they know
[1:45:04] where they stand they know what they're
[1:45:06] needing to do are you with me
[1:45:09] our real estate and Taylor God bless you
[1:45:18] as part of growing up
[1:45:20] and that's a I believe Ephesians 4 tells
[1:45:23] us that that God gave us a
[1:45:25] a five-fold Ministry to grow up
[1:45:29] and
[1:45:37] um
[1:45:42] that's just bow our hearts in a word of
[1:45:46] prayer and
[1:45:49] our our heads bowed
[1:45:52] just looking to the Lord right now if
[1:45:56] your desire is to stretch
[1:46:01] higher
[1:46:02] closer to the Lord to to be more mature
[1:46:06] to
[1:46:07] to
[1:46:10] put away certain
[1:46:12] natural things and to be more spiritual
[1:46:18] as the scripture teaches us when someone
[1:46:21] would be
[1:46:23] Fallen overtaken into fall ye which are
[1:46:26] spiritual go to them in a spirit of
[1:46:27] meekness
[1:46:29] if you feel that you want to be
[1:46:34] this mature Christian just place that
[1:46:37] before the Lord as we go to pray because
[1:46:39] it's it's all an individual affair
[1:46:42] and I don't believe we need to be scared
[1:46:45] of what God's calling us to
[1:46:49] amen amen amen Heavenly Father we come
[1:46:52] to you as a as a body of Believers we're
