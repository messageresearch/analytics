mom it's good to see everybody in the houses of the lord this morning and you know we can say we can stay home and we probably have a what the world will say is a pretty good reason to stay home or we can say lord god it's my footsteps i'll do what i can but i'm still coming and i thank you for that this morning because the devil's on the process you don't care how long as you're not giving god glory you don't care amen that's our brother john has requests please remember all our children that are out of the ark of the safety amen amen you can say amen to that one amen uh and uh also

mercies for her and her sister for brother marty and sister kathleen for all those uh sister joyce and brother sister kelly and all those that just aren't in the house of the lord this morning for whatever reason we pray that god has protection around him and that his spirit would just uh he's had a long arm amen so we all know that you can't run from god his arm is longer than iran so we just

service and and god just reminded me that uh you know satan was cast down because iniquity was found in and when you say well you know what is that that's anything you know anything that you put before god because we know that we shouldn't put anything before god amen so let's just check our lives and just make sure that we're putting him first in all things i mean he he loves us and he

praise the lord amen when we get to heaven god will want to be praised he's not going to want to know my thoughts [Applause] but he's going to want to be praised because he's worthy of all praise amen god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of deuteronomy chapter 6 for very familiar scriptures you know this word the whole word should be familiar to us amen we should be at least getting it at least getting more familiar with it amen how many is glad to be here this morning amen how many was able to to go to some of the meetings that brother danny ratliff had here amen praise the lord praise the lord well we're thankful we're thankful for them and we've been praying for them and glad for those that were able to go amen before we begin reading the word here let's just ask god's blessings and this word for revelation for each of us amen heavenly father lord we have not gathered as just mortal human beings trying to figure out the things of god but we have gathered as spiritual beings this morning our hearts have been prepared lord we've been cleansed by the only thing that can cleanse us is your blood and lord we have been set apart now for your word to receive the engrafted word which is able to save our souls lord this late hour that we're living in we need your word more than ever we humbly pray lord as humbles we know how that you would bless us with the revelation of your word today lord through the course of this service i asked that you would minister to every one of us here today you know the various needs that are in our heart and the request only you lord can meet them all for you are the great physician lord we just asked today that our relationship would be drawn closer to you and that by a way of revelation we could come to know you a little bit more father we commit this service now into your hands with all the needs that are represented here we humbly pray this now in jesus christ's name amen amen deuteronomy chapter 6 starting with verse number 4 hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might amen these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down at night and when thou risest up in the morning thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy gates amen god bless you may be seated on the title this message love the word amen the word and for a subject i want to talk about loving god outside of his word loving god outside of his word jesus referred back to this very same commandment that we read this morning one time when he was talking to a lawyer that was trying to tempt him and we can find this in matthew 22 36 when this lawyer was tempting jesus you know he didn't like the ministry of jesus because it wasn't quite like moses the prophet jesus uh he asked he said master which is the great commandment in the law because see jesus said i am the way to god and he didn't like that so he's saying master what's the great commandment in the law and jesus said and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind he said this is the first and great commandment but you notice he didn't stop there because this lawyer didn't want to fulfill the word amen and he said the second is like unto it that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and jesus said i'm your neighbor of these two commandments hang all the law and all the prophets yes amen if we can get this straight amen everything else will just turn out right [Music] too often we try to love god and make our own personal choices about loving our neighbor loving god ought to be the center theme of all of our lives appreciated that song this morning i believe it was the right time for that psalm but reality we become satisfied with only loving god with some of our mind some of our our our heart and and some of our strength or some of our might if i could say it like that we ought to be pressing towards loving god with everything because in the end that's all that's really going to matter in reality the human nature that we're born with isn't doesn't gravitate to loving god first and if it does try to do it it usually has some selfish motive of what they can get out of it that's why at times church seems to be hard for us we can take it or leave it basically but when god's nature is preeminent you cannot wait till those doors are open abandoned had made some strong statements about loving god he said we could love god and still miss it at the end that's a hard one to understand when the bible says that nothing can separate us from the love of god in christ jesus i'll say it takes a tremendous amount of effort to love god with everything right with all thy might our strength all of our our mind with all of our thoughts with all of our efforts to love him in every possible way it's almost like a new religion amen because people feel they they have a choice and they can still love god as much as they do and everything is okay is it okay with god that's what matters each and every one of us should keep pressing towards maintaining the commitment of loving god every day with everything brother branham said in the message influence of another he says when you leave god out of anything i want you to leave me out of it too brother brandon said because you must always remember god first yes the devil don't care if you're not doing horrible things as long as you're putting god second yes most people don't realize almighty god will not take second place to anyone to anything amen he may use second place but he'll not take it exodus 20 verse 3 says thou shalt have no other gods before me god wants to be first amen not only are we to keep god first by loving him with all our lives but we need to teach the same to our children to our families the words of of loving god with all of our lives in deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 7 they need to be taught diligently unto our children yes these words that that god that that moses through the inspiration of god was commanding the children of israel to love the lord god with everything those words shall be in your heart and they shall be taught diligently unto thy children and thou shalt talk of them when you're sitting down in the house what you think about sitting with your children and when they'll get up to to walk somewhere maybe to go outside or go to the store and when thou takes a nap or goes to sleep at night amen talk about him and when you get up in the morning talk about loving god first now this is the word of the lord this love of god must diligently be taught to our children and if we don't do it who's going to do it [Applause] amen all of our might strength and mind should be used to love god with everything and in every way and to teach our children the same with a diligent fashion now this is a full-time job i don't even know if i've got time to do anything else and thou shalt bind them verse 8 for a sign upon thine hand and thou and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes yes god likes signs to be posted but not on the wall but posted on our lives when people see everything that our hands do they ought to see us loving god and when they look into our eyes they need to see the love of god in our eyes amen they need to see it on our faces thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house none thy gates a lot of times you see people putting up signs at the at the gates of their property at the end of their driveway and some sort of uh sign that they what they like and what they believe in and maybe they put up a state sign or a u of m flag or something to kind of let all the people that are driving by know where they stand and god wants people when they see us to see the sign that we love god first in our lives and they need to see it first impression amen as they enter into our lives god wants us to display the theme of loving god loving him and teaching everyone especially our children this great commandment i want to say today loving god is not enough we've got to love him with all of our heart yes amen amen amen don't come short of the word all right all of our mind all of our strength all of our spirit all of our soul that's the thing we take for granted that we think we do but if we do it'll be so apparent it'll be so apparent everybody will be gravitated to being around you they will want what you got amen amen teaching our children to love god with all of our heart our mind our strength it's god's commandment and anything short of his commandment is simply a definition of your love anything short of the commandment is your love because god's commandment is all and we shouldn't stop there with just loving god with everything we have we need to take it to the next level we need to to love others as we love ourselves right love thy neighbor as thyself we've got to love others how god has loved us and how has he loved us unconditionally to teach them to teach our children to love god with all of our with all their strength with all their might with all their spirit and soul and if we do not teach them that same right we are only loving them with our love and our love comes up short amen i don't want a definition of my personal love i want a definition of god's love now you might say i'm not i'm not turning my cheek for a person who's just going to mistreat me again i'm not going to let them use me again take advantage of me again i'm not going to go the the second mile i'm not even going to give them the second inch i'm not going to forgive them again they're just going to do it again to me how many times you expect me to forgive anyways i've bailed them out so many times i'm done with it enough is enough anything short of loving your neighbor as yourself is a definition of your love doesn't matter if you claim god's love now when people hear about you let them hear that you love unconditionally and that will be a definition of god's love so it's not about you loving god or having the love of god in your hearts it's about loving god with everything so it can be manifested to those who don't possess it that's the important part by this great loving commandment shall all men know that i have chosen you to be my disciples otherwise everybody's claiming to be his disciple yes amen it's not what we claim it's his love abroad in our heart by the holy ghost being manifested to those who are mistreating us anybody can love somebody that loves them anybody can get along with somebody that wants to get along with them show me somebody who will lay down their life when they're being stepped on and i'll show you somebody who has god inside of them because only god can do that amen most people getting their beard pulled out or the blood running off their head or just want to tell them they're doing wrong they shouldn't do that so if loving god is the most important thing we can do and that's the thing that the only thing that really matters why is it so hard for me to put god first to love god first why are we loving him more it's because of our selfish flesh our carnal nature amen it's all it's all about me attitude our mindset brother branham said that our greatest enemy was ourself [Music] i want to stay away from that person i want to stay away from the devil i'll tell you your greatest enemy is the person you're stuck with is standing in the way of victory amen we learn wednesday night that jesus wants us to learn how to die daily remember what god spoke to brother branham he said this in itself basically the choice that you've made to deny yourself and choose the harder way to deny it's all about me attitude this in itself will bring the past that tremendous victory in love divine if we don't deny ourselves how do we expect to ever get filled with the love of god amen you can't make god loves you can't make god love you you can't make god love through you it's a relationship oh wretched man that i am who's going to deliver me from this body of death yes we need a great delivery amen yes amen every single hour of every single day to save our wretched self yes when i was without christ in my personal life i thought i was an okay person i was in the world doing all the the worldly things that everybody else was doing and you you notice those who are a little bit worse than you and when i looked at them enough it helped me to feel that i was just a little bit better i was an okay guy because i wasn't doing what they were doing but i was blind i was blind little did i realize i had a devilish self-tendered nature just as them i was spiritually dead in sins and trespasses walking according to the spirit of this world i just didn't realize it the bible tells us it's the very same spirit of disobedience that's now working in the chil in children and adults and adults amen i was simply carrying out the nature that i was born with fulfilling the desires of my mind and my flesh and the lust that was inside i was simply by nature a child of wrath but i was still good enough i didn't need anything else because everybody else was doing the same thing until one day god showed me how horrible i was and when god shows you how horrible is then you realize you need to be born again but as long as you think you're good enough because you go to church because you do these things you never see a need for the new birth the revelation of the new birth comes when you realize that you're lost that a man at his very best is all vanity and there's no way we can make it find favor in the sight of god outside of a new birth ephesians 2 verse 4 but god who is rich in mercy praise god you know when you need somebody you don't you need money you don't go to a pover uh somebody in poverty you go to somebody that's got the goods somebody's got the money yes i need some money but you know you you should do it humbly or a better chance of getting it but we need mercy mercy rewrote my life god who is rich in mercy for his great love so great wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with christ how many has been quickened that puts you in the family of god that makes his brother branham says overalls uh hug somebody in a tuxedo it's the love of god amen by grace you're saved he loved me when i was a sinner and i didn't even know it and you know what he did he didn't say the same thing the devil told me which is you're an okay guy right don't you worry about it you're gonna make it i love you no he says as many as i love i rebuke i chase sin right amen you're not in a condition to make it into the kingdom amen only the blood of jesus christ can put us in there amen to think that god loves you as a good person just doesn't do so much for you does it it won't change you it'll make you feel yeah of course i mean god even sees i'm a good person but when you realize that you're the biggest sinner on the planet amen and god still loves you as a sinner that'll turn your heart around amen that'll do something for you god loves to change your life from the moment that he changed your life every person that has had that experience ought to be putting their roots in that love but i'm sad to say that the majority of the people experience the love of god resort to only having that love to be a part of their lives they want to keep that love with them but they never put their roots in that love maybe they want to keep it with them when it's convenient or they may need it god's love should not only change us but it should continuously be changing us until we leave here i don't need to change anymore is to tell me that you're defining the fullness of god in your life whoa i don't know why that was so quiet there should have been some amends in there to pack around an attitude that i don't need to change anymore that i have changed enough is telling me that you've got the fullness of love of christ in your life [Music] well i don't like saying amen to my word but i believe that's the word of god and i want to say amen to that there's a reason that the apostle paul said i'm pressing towards the mark because his matter no matter how much revelation he had how much of god that he had he still realized that there was more for him amen too often we get satisfied like because of this much god i got my life i kind of like where in the world well i'm not as bad as that person not as bad as that believer going to church not as bad as that one calling himself a christian that one who says they love god amen i honestly love the opportunity to love somebody who's out of the way and i'm not talking about people who don't know christ i'm talking about people who claim to be christians to know god who simply do not see where they're at at the time amen and that's why they're acting the way they're acting amen paul told timothy to be an example to the believers we have a job to do we have a job to be christ to those around us the body edifies one another we grow together we don't rebuke together we don't just try to be some diamond one to another all the time even though it is scriptural but the thing is uh we need to love one another as we love ourselves now you know you love yourself because you took good care of yourself before you got into church today you wanted to look presentable you didn't want to look like a hobo but now if you can love me the same way take care of me the same way well i don't know if i can love john that same way why not why not that's right i need help i need your love i need the love of god in you to help me there will come a time that god will will expect you to demonstrate the love of god in your heart for me amen and for every other one that's in this church because the devil has the the great ability right while you're sitting in church looking up just like that lawyer wanted to tempt jesus because he he saw something in jesus that he didn't agree with yet he was flawless but the devil has a way of showing us things but where are you going to stand are you going to sit on the seat of the scornful are you going to sit on the seat of the judgment right right are you gonna come up and wash my feet you'll have an opportunity the person you're sitting next to the person that's behind you the person that's in front of you you know we got just as much falls as we got good things but the flaws aren't in the spirit now they're in the flesh love covers a multitude of flaws [Applause] the love of god is what we need today change your life psalms chapter 1 verse number 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly amen nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful amen you're blessed in god's ways blessed is the man who's walking in god's ways but you know when we walked in the world they weren't god's ways amen but when you begin to walk in god's ways your life becomes blessed because jesus is a true friend he sticketh closer than any of your your other friends out there but his law but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night how many delights in the word of god today [Music] it's where our love needs to be it needs to be in the word amen and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and bringing forth his fruit and his season and his leaf shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper yes wow do you want your life to prosper more here's the answer delight yourself in the word of god amen delight yourself in it don't read it because well you know brother ben says every christian should read his bible every day you know i don't got quite time to do that so i just i just grabbed my little you know bread of life and just get my scripture for the day or my little phone app and you know boom oh yeah this is a good one i'll send it to so-and-so the light yourself in the word of god there's things in there that god wants you to know things he wants to bring back to your remembrance things he wants to be fresh to you to reveal to you [Music] well you know the word has hit in my heart and i already got it you want to prosper put god first put god first we never want to be satisfied with god's love just being a part of our lives we don't want to have the mindset that we can just uh pull it pull it into our lives whenever we need it or just have it when it's convenient always remember whatever you're rooted in that's what you will become amen wherever your heart is rooted in that's what you will become amen is the scripture something about where your treasure is where your heart is there where your treasure be also somewhere there so you want your treasure to be in the love of god see most people just they want god's love there they want god's love to take them through they want god's love god to love them and that's they're okay with anything everything else it doesn't really matter and that's where they're missing a part of god the more that you're planted in god's love the more you'll be able to love just like god loves now that all be the desire of our hearts our lives is to be able to love like god loves us not just benefit from god loving us and not being able to love him back with that same love and how do we love god back with that same love not by sitting in church and just saying i love him i love him because he first loved me i'd get out of church and love somebody that's how you love god the same way that he loves you what good is it to have something and not be able to manifest it i mean god in heaven had a love that he wanted to express and he couldn't and he caused a situation to happen that he could save somebody that he could redeem somebody that he could heal somebody so what good would it be to have that love and not be able to express it it would be useless so look for an opportunity to love somebody that can't love you back look for an opportunity something that's so down in the dumps they couldn't love you first if they had to but you love them first you can turn their life around [Music] amen the more that you're planted in god's love the more you'll be able to love like him unconditionally everywhere to every person at all the time press towards it the more that you're planted in god's love the more you'll be able to comprehend and know because you really can't know the love of god to experience it otherwise you got knowledge god loves me he died for me the bible says that but if it's that change in you you're not experiencing it right that's right while morty's saying what else is there to experience for the john how about feel for the person who's lost how about have that love the mask has come down you grabbed it now put it on your brother put it on your sister because life is leaving them and they need the oxygen of the holy ghost amen jude chapter 1 verse 21 jude chapter 1. i just you know what i am just going to feel so good about saying it keeping yourself in the love of god you have a choice where are you going to keep yourself where are you going to be rooted is god's love going to be a part of your life or is it going to be your life keep yourself in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life so keep on experiencing the love of god in your life just keep experiencing one experience after another just keep it going keep experiencing keep yourself in that love what god's wanting to love the lord thy god with all the heart with all thy soul with all thy might amen from glory unto glory amen ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 ephesians 3 verse 17 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that's right if you're not going to believe it christ won't be there but at this very moment if you can believe that christ will be there god is not scientific even though he knows all about science yes god is a god of faith and if you want him you got to take him by faith and i'm so thankful i'm so thankful that i don't do so these things or be a certain knowledge or ability all they got to do is only believe only believe amen god sees your faith and he comes inside your heart he dwells there by faith as soon as you begin to the doubt says without faith it's impossible to please god amen and he just kind of like waits for you to get your attitude and your mind right so he can come back and just have the preeminence there you've got to allow god to be preeminent in your life [Music] keep your proud thinking out of the clouds and make sure you're grounded in love in the love of god keep your steps out of your ways and make sure your paths or the path that you're walking is the love of god rooted and grounded in the love of god everything amen that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you be rooted and grounded in love yes i want to be honest with you there's a lot of mentality out there that you know since people receive christ they love god they just plucked themselves up and they just go somewhere else they don't realize as soon as you do that you lose where your strength your nutrition your water comes from you've got to stay in the love of god you can't i've got it figured out now i've got all this i got all the knowledge got it figured out any opportunity comes by to love somebody and you just get all tripped up because it's too hard yeah that's right they mistreated you too much it's too hard to love them what are you rooted in get your roots back in the love of god amen anything else short of that you're not going to grow properly that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith being rooted grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breath the length the depth and height there's something there's something there's a a structure to god's love and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with the fullness of god that's the revelation i want right there amen take this whole world but give me jesus it takes being rooted and grounded in the love of god to comprehend just how much god loves you it takes being rooted and grounded in love to know the love of christ to the place where our lives might be filled with the fullness of god i'm not happy with how much i have amen want the fullness well i'm not going to get it through head knowledge i'm not going to get it through the the mysteries and knowing all the mysteries and having all faith to remove mountains making all these sacrifices even burn my body fall in love with the word amen no god see we all know god through experience we've all felt god's love god has blessed us and bubbled us over it's a bubble and it's a bubbling right now we've all experienced his presence coming home he's listened to a song and oh that's so true also in the presence of the lord comes sitting in church something happens you know that that was just for you amen you begin to feel lord you did hear my prayer when i was praying the other day amen and we all experience god in that way but not too many of us love the word not too many of us are falling in love with the word we're falling in love with the god who expresses love to us by meeting our needs by answering our prayers by directing our paths by letting us feel his presence but we're not anxious about the word that's true that he has for our hearts now this is just human nature our our natures can become selfish about god's love right yes sure we want god's love we want to feel it and experience it know that it's with us and but god wants us to love the word his word it's a challenge for us to be filled with this fullness and we can't outside of the love of god because god is love now in tim that's able to do exceedingly above all that we ask or even think according to the power that's working in us well brother john i'm not feeling that power it's still working you've got to believe it you don't got to i don't i believe that mary received the word of god through faith when she said be it unto me according to that word it wasn't according to how i feel about the situation it went beyond her comprehension her own understanding how could a man receive the word who's never a woman receive a seed without knowing a man today you're sitting in the presence of god who can inject his seed into the womb of your mind and receive it down into your hearts [Music] and life can come forth it is that real we don't need some show some light some some entertainment some hollywood some stories we just need the word of god fall in love with that word it's a sea that can come into our hearts continue to change us from glory unto glory most people come short of the love of god that god intended to have for them now long ago we ministered here on knowing christ as savior or his lord remember that some know this to be true a lot of people who say that they love god are not love with his word it's evident when you give them the word they say no thank you they will express all the things that god did for them and they will testify about it and they should but sometimes they're not interested in the word of god it's almost like they're bragging how much god loves them i said it and i believe it with all my heart instead of giving god glory the breaking how much god loves them i'm unworthy of his love friends it's almost like they're they're more special than the person they're talking to but yet they call it a testimony one time brother branham got home from being away and it was late and sarah and rebecca were so anxious to see their daddy and the older one was bragging to the younger one i've got all of daddy i got him and the younger one said yeah but daddy's got when you choose to put god first he's got all of you in the palm of his hand but when we're just gonna brag about god's love but we don't feel in debt to it when it doesn't make you want to get on your knees and love somebody with the same love that god loved you with you might have all jesus but friend what's going to hold you is when god is holding you loving god and not being in love with all of his word is one of the greatest deceptions that satan has put on the believer this is god in letter form amen god is his word amen it has never failed this word has never failed i am a human being that has lied well brother john what are you doing at the pulpit show me a man on the planet that hasn't lied amen and i'll do everything i can to get him over here and i'll sit underneath them amen well i expect more out of you you know we do need a revelation of our pastor that's the truth well brother john i got a revelation of my pastor my pastor would never say what you say he would never do what you do he would never act my pastor he would give me the scriptures and make me feel the way that i want to feel that's my pastor that's your revelation that would almost be like jesus telling you everything that you wanted every day i love you so much i can never rebuke you i can never hold you accountable i just let you keep lying let god's word be true amen we can count on it we need to fall in love with this word they're inseparable amen when you think about god i want you to think more about his word not so much the letter but the spirit of the word for each one for each and every one of our lives god and his word need to be inseparable in every situation that you're in yes too often we leave the word and go with the feelings go with our thoughts go with our understanding go with what we emotionally feel about it when we're told plainly to not lean to our own understanding just acknowledge him his word would direct your paths now i'll say this if you respected the word of god more in church god you would see god's directing your life more [Applause] but because you're coming to church for a feeling or emotion or something different you're not respecting him how do you expect god to just be your dubois we need to fall in love with the word the word is where jesus is at that's why so many people leave church and they're feeling nothing's transpired come on people can leave a a a another church a denominational church an independent church and they've got the the most enjoyable everything and feels so good about leaving right something really happened really encouraged them and really made them feel better there's been a change but their life remains the same when god was telling us to love him with all of our might involve our strength with all of our mind with all of our heart with all of our soul what he was really really telling us is to love his word with all of our heart with all of our strengths [Applause] do not allow your personal experiences with the love of god to be separate from this word amen too many of us are loving god outside of the word of god and are missing all the love that god has for us amen he has he wants us to be filled with the fullness of his love that's what the bible says first john chapter one verse number one not first john saint john sorry saint john chapter one verse one time is running out time was really filled with swift transition today i don't really know what happened in the beginning was the word and the word it was with god and the word it was god the same was in the beginning with god see it's insufferable you can't separate the bible from god amen if you don't understand something pray about it god wants to reveal himself at the same time he wants to reveal himself to the hungry to the thirsty he's also hiding himself from the person who's got the wrong motive about knowing about it so if the word and god was the same at the beginning then we when we fall in love with god we need to fall in love with the word hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear now i can say that i made this from some wood that somebody cut from a tree and they planed it earth it was planed when it was brought to them and then perhaps somebody planted the tree watered the tree but in reality all the hands that have touched it the actual substance came from something we don't even see and that's the word of god amen amen and at the beginning when there was nothing the word amen spoken into existence amen and that word was god and that his word will not return void it will accomplish its purpose that it was sent out to do god didn't bring us this far to leave us it will accomplish that which he intended it for we can have a confidence he that which have begun a good work in us is going to finish it the word is going to finish it because the word is already spoken we don't need to emphasize look towards experiences of our flesh experiences of the love of god in our flesh the good feeling it brings us oh did you just feel the presence of the lord there i want to feel the presence of the lord here if you don't feel it here what good is it to feel it here this won't change you this temporary makes you feel good you know that right that's why i eat double stuffed oreos because they don't do good here they taste good here john chapter 1 verse 14 and the word that was at the beginning was spoken and was made flesh and it dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and full of truth god's word will not return void a virgin shall conceive and it came forth it was manifested in the beginning god called your name yes you're going to come forth you're going to be a manifested son and daughter of god it's gonna happen because god's seed is inside of you you have to say yes to the word because when you were in the world you weren't saying yes to the word you were just doing what you wanted to do and nobody could tell you any different yes and that's why your life didn't change but when you turned your life to christ when you did the things that you should do that's when change began to take place and i say it like this do not sit here and say i've changed to know because the word called you a manifested son and daughter of god and you've got to agree with that word you've got to say be it unto me finish the work you've started in me lord you're not through with me and i believe you're what i'm gonna change and you know what it's just slowly it's not some you know we want to see some some dream prophecy some arm come forth we all want that that's beautiful that's wonderful but god chose the preaching of his word to bring forth manifested sons and daughters of god and it happens here and then there are this you know when your child is is growing up you don't shove the whole encyclopedia down his throat as soon as he starts school you give him a little bit yeah first they learn to take a nap when the teacher says take a nap if you're good we're going to have our graham crackers and milk right i don't know what they do because of my fondest memories is at lunch time when i was in school [Laughter] and don't tell me you can't wait to get out here and go to lunch because that's not why we're here we got to give time for that child to grow experience give a little bit more and a little bit more can you imagine your 13 year old saying i know more than you you stopped telling me what to do you were hypocrite yourself we can get that attitude at church who are you to preach that i saw you get upset probably didn't see me get upset but you've probably seen something sure the devil showed you something he's real good at it he can tell you all about me even when i'm not telling you be at home just sitting on the couch thinking to me he'll tell you a whole bunch of stuff he's good i don't know i'm not allowed to preach like this when it's at the end of the service turn with me to colossians chapter one now there's nine verses here that are kind of like there's no period after just comma or semicolon and it just kind of goes on and you know when you're in school they would call this a run-on but god's word is etron i just want to kind of cut here at the end of that colossians chapter 15 who is in the image jesus christ is in the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are here on earth things that are visible and invisible we got invisible waves going through here right now whether they be thrones or dominions principalities or or powers even the powers of satan right that's good all things are created by him and for him for him that tells me that god wants to be god that's what that tells me and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of this church amen that's correct he's the head yes who is the beginning of the firstborn of the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence now how do you allow jesus christ to be preeminent in this church how do you do it don't get that close to me brother john stay back how do you allow him to be preeminent in your life in this church you let the word be preeminent amen in other words you let the word judge you yes you let it be the final say-so for your life not just well that's probably for somebody else ain't for me let the word be preeminent that's how he has preeminence in this church [Applause] we all have an opportunity to build this relationship with god just yield to him amen let the word govern your life change your life whatever god is trying to do he wants to be thankful for jesus he's not only supplying our needs we don't want to be just thankful for him supplying our needs we want to be thankful that we ought to be thankful that god wants to correct your life in a closer way with him tell me which parent in here ever had the attitude james i feel i got permission from the parents james i i love you the way you are you do not need to change you keep being as disobedient as you are you don't have to do your chores more than you're doing them now which isn't very much you don't have to take your plate to the table no parent is going to say that why would we expect god to come in here and say you don't need to change anymore you're good where you're at you've hit the plateau fact you've been there so long i don't know why i didn't rapture myself let the word have preeminence let all the feelings that we comprehend be set aside let all the emotions and knowledge be set aside let everything that you think you know be set aside let all the tongues and the prophecies and the dreams and the knowledge be set aside and fall in love with this word fall in love with this word fall in love with the other part of god that we haven't been thinking about to know the love of christ with passive knowledge that we might be filled with the fullness of god so the fullness of god comes with the love of god fall in love with his word it's time to build our love relationship with the word amen thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light to my path amen the word is settled it's forever settled in heaven it ought to be settled in our heart we just need to settle with it i have so many things that i need to just bypass and sometimes i ask the lord lord why did did you have me go through them why am i writing them down if i'm not going to be able to preach on them it's a big battle i have then i gotta wonder did i did i stay too long on a subject is it for another time did i do the right job but i'll tell you my anchor is the lord is in control he knows what he's doing amen praise the lord john chapter 12 verse 46. excuse me i i am skipping a lot trust me too many people think that god didn't come to judge them just came to save them and this is this is the part of the gospel that that really satan wants people to know about god wants us to walk in the light of his word saint john chapter 12 verse 46 i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness so here is his statement god gives us the truth of his word so you don't stay in the condition that you're in amen verse 47 and if any man hear my words and they don't believe them i judge them not right for i came not to judge the world but my job here is to save the world look at the next verse he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words have one that judge him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day we cannot get away from the word of god it was in the beginning it will be in the end he is the alpha he is the omega we need to fall in love with the word amen we don't want to kick the can down the road right don't build your love relationship outside of your love for the word don't do that fall more in love with the word let's stand together let your love relationship be more with the word set your affections on the word i wish i could give you all these scriptures i want to encourage you to read the bible you're going to see them be more rooted and grounded in god's love yes amen stay away from loving god outside of the word it's so easy to do feelings emotions i got my private stay away from that delight thyself in the word god when you start thinking about god i want you to think about the he's the word god putting the preeminence the emphasis on the word so we delight ourselves to get into it more and and read it and seek to get grounded rooted in the love of the word yes yes so we can speak the word the truth of the word in love rather than just speaking the truth speak it in love there's always a way out think about this none of us today standing here are without the mercies of god at our fingertips nobody has blasphemed the holy ghost think about it he wouldn't be here today so if you're in the condition that you have access to god's mercy then what about your brother what about your sister i look back in my life at how many times i just i don't honestly know how i can even move forward because if this vile nature yes sir i've got to learn to crucify it i've got to learn to deny it it it creeps in the more that god shows me in his word the more horrible i am [Music] amen fall in love with the word of god amen let's sing that course we were singing before we when we started the worship service humble yourself humble yourself and just see what god would do humble yourself before your lord and king [Music] give him your heart offer your everything there's no limit on the love he has for you so humble yourself and see what god will do humble yourself and let them have his way [Music] love his word and his will obey for his eyes are on the one whose heart is true so humble yourself and see what god will do don't you love this course humble yourself before your lord and king [Music] give him your heart offer your everything there's no limit on the love he has for you so humble yourself and see what god will do humble yourself oh just let him have his way granted lord [Music] for his eyes are on the one whose heart is true so humble yourself believe what god will do amen he's waiting on us he's the same yesterday today and forever his love is constant brother branham expressed his love to give us the holy ghost is so strong he's here to fill us with him he wants us to humble ourselves and if we do it's up to god see what god will do ain't that his word will prevail by his word oh by his word prevail by his word i'll never fail by his word by his word by his life by his love i'll never fail [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise the lord by his grace by his grace [Music] overcome [Music] by his word i'll never fail by his word i'll overcome amen we got the word of god on our side the same thing that jesus used against the devil that's the same thing we could use against the devil and us in our mind get behind me satan amen get out of this family get out of this situation by his word i'll prevail i'm in love with the word of god amen jesus name above all names amen [Music] name above all names beautiful savior glory is lord [Music] god is with us blessed
