[39:33] voices and Je and said Jesus Master have
[39:37] mercy on us and when he saw them he said
[39:40] unto them go show yourselves unto the
[39:42] priest and it came to pass that as he
[39:44] went they were cleansed and one of them
[39:48] when he saw he was healed turned back
[39:52] with a loud voice glorified God fell
[39:54] down on his face at his feet giving
[39:56] thanks and he was a
[39:59] Samaritan and Jesus answering said were
[40:03] there not 10 cleansed but where are the
[40:07] nine there are not found that return to
[40:10] give glory to God Save The Stranger and
[40:13] he said unto him arise go thy way thy
[40:17] faith have made thee whole and God bless
[40:20] you you may be
[40:22] seated well most of us know that the
[40:24] English settlers known as pilgrim
[40:27] arrived in America in the Mayflower in
[40:32] 1620 and it was in the Autumn of 1621
[40:36] that they had their first
[40:38] Thanksgiving and a lot of things have
[40:40] changed since the first Thanksgiving
[40:43] which was over 400 years
[40:45] ago the first Thanksgiving meal was
[40:48] likely including duck
[40:51] venison
[40:53] Seafood along with cabbage onions corn
[40:56] and squash
[40:58] there was no
[40:59] turkey there was no stuffing as we know
[41:02] it today no mashed potatoes no cranberry
[41:05] sauce or many fine
[41:09] desserts the first
[41:11] Thanksgiving perhaps had pumpkins on the
[41:14] table but they certainly didn't have any
[41:16] pumpkin
[41:18] pie they did during Thanksgiving play
[41:22] ball games and sang and danced today we
[41:25] sit down and watch football games with
[41:28] fans shouting and dancing so it's a
[41:30] little bit
[41:32] different there was about 90 Native
[41:34] Americans and about 50 pilgrims there
[41:38] that came together for the first
[41:39] Thanksgiving and both of their purposes
[41:42] of coming
[41:43] together
[41:46] was to
[41:47] show their Thanksgiving and to give
[41:51] gratitude for what God had given them in
[41:54] the Harvest amen that's right that was
[41:58] their purpose of gathering together and
[42:00] so you've got pilgrims you got these
[42:01] Indians and they're like different just
[42:03] different cultures all together that
[42:05] they both have to eat
[42:07] right and they're coming
[42:10] together to give an expression of
[42:14] Thanksgiving for what God had did
[42:17] through the Harvest because you know
[42:18] they had to till the ground they they
[42:20] did all this stuff but yet they couldn't
[42:23] give the increase the increase came from
[42:25] God
[42:27] amen and and and they had just this this
[42:29] great gratitude that had been in their
[42:33] hearts and and there was no no Black
[42:36] Friday shopping to look forward
[42:39] to In fact when they celebrated
[42:42] Thanksgiving they actually expressed
[42:45] gratitude for a
[42:47] week they had Thanksgiving for a week
[42:50] they that that's what they did the next
[42:51] day that's they didn't look forward to
[42:52] shopping and getting
[42:54] deals to people today people people have
[42:57] lost their
[42:59] gratitude and they've lost a love to
[43:02] express
[43:03] it Paul warned the church would be in
[43:07] perilous condition right before the
[43:09] Rapture would take place that
[43:11] churchgoing people would be lovers of
[43:14] their own self Covetous bolsters and
[43:18] unthankful instead of coming together to
[43:21] give thanks and express attitude they
[43:23] they came to church with a proud Spirit
[43:26] right
[43:28] amen the proud would be in such an
[43:30] unthankful condition that many of them
[43:33] would walk away from the
[43:35] faith maybe they they wouldn't stop
[43:38] going to church but they would walk away
[43:41] from the original Faith they had when
[43:42] they got
[43:44] saved we know the world has fallen in
[43:48] love with themselves so much that their
[43:50] lives is only their life is the only
[43:54] life that matters that's right
[43:57] because iniquity in their own life is
[44:00] abound many love with wax cold Jesus
[44:03] said and that Spirit has literally crept
[44:07] into our homes and when it creeps into
[44:09] our homes it creeps into our
[44:12] church so I asked I want to entitle this
[44:14] message today where did the Thanksgiving
[44:19] go where did the Thanksgiving go and
[44:23] when I pondered this question I thought
[44:25] about these 10 lepers
[44:28] lepers they had a bad rap according to
[44:31] Leviticus 13: 45 the law of Moses lepers
[44:37] had to easily
[44:38] identify they were easily identified by
[44:41] others because they had this contagious
[44:44] condition and their clothes had to be
[44:47] torn they had they had to let others
[44:50] know they had this disease so they
[44:53] didn't come by them and get this uh any
[44:57] any any any part of this disease was uh
[45:01] part of it could have been
[45:03] contagious so they had to make sure
[45:05] nobody came by them and so they had to
[45:07] go out with a completely it was a
[45:10] humiliating uh
[45:13] uh behavior and and spirit that they had
[45:16] to walk around instead of being proud
[45:18] look at me I got a touchdown they had to
[45:19] walk around say stay away from me
[45:21] because I am gross I've got leprosy amen
[45:25] their clothes were torn their hair was
[45:27] left untidy and the upper part of their
[45:30] lip had to be covered and when they saw
[45:32] someone approaching them they had to
[45:34] yell out unclean unclean in other words
[45:36] I'm warning you stay away from me
[45:39] amen and it came to pass as Jesus went
[45:42] into Jerusalem that he passed through
[45:44] the midst of Samaran Galilee back at
[45:47] Luke 17 verse 12 and and as he entered
[45:52] into a certain Village there met him 10
[45:55] men that were lepers
[45:58] and as the law they stood a far off yes
[46:02] and they lifted up their
[46:04] voices and said Jesus Master have mercy
[46:10] upon us amen not only unclean
[46:14] unclean but they they called Jesus
[46:19] master and they pleaded for
[46:23] help you know there probably was no
[46:25] other physician that could help them
[46:27] with
[46:28] Leprosy and when we realize there is
[46:30] only one person in this world that can
[46:33] help us we ought to be looking to him
[46:36] the author and the finisher of our faith
[46:39] not looking to one another not depending
[46:41] upon one
[46:42] another I think it's good to say come
[46:45] pray with me but it's good that we look
[46:47] to God he's our Master
[46:51] amen verse 14 and when he saw them he
[46:56] said un to them go show yourselves unto
[46:59] the priests and it came to pass that as
[47:02] they went they were cleansed now this is
[47:06] this verse 14 in in itself is profound
[47:10] to
[47:11] me because when we come to Jesus and we
[47:14] got this need in our life and we really
[47:15] want Jesus to help us we're looking for
[47:18] some sort of structure in what he's
[47:21] telling us to make sense remember non
[47:23] wanted to be clean and it didn't make
[47:25] sense to him because he was asked to go
[47:27] into the dirty Waters of Jordan amen and
[47:30] so we're looking okay come over here I'm
[47:32] going to lay hands on you I'm going to
[47:33] pray for you this is what we're going to
[47:35] do there was none of
[47:37] that and we shouldn't be ever expecting
[47:39] that for the needs in our lives I'm
[47:42] telling you what God is looking for is
[47:43] obedience to his word amen he's going to
[47:46] give you a word and I don't know what
[47:47] it's going to be but whatever he says
[47:49] just do it because that is what brings
[47:51] the
[47:52] results amen he just said go show
[47:54] yourself on the priest that's all he
[47:56] said he didn't even say you're healed he
[47:58] didn't say it's going to happen he just
[48:00] said go show yourselves to the priest
[48:04] and it came to pass as they went in
[48:06] obedience they were cleansed and one of
[48:09] them just one of them when he saw that
[48:12] he was
[48:13] healed he turned back with a loud voice
[48:18] and glorified
[48:24] God he didn't whisper it
[48:28] he didn't come back to say hey bu thank
[48:30] you have a good one thank you for what
[48:32] you did
[48:34] man
[48:36] no he didn't care what he looked
[48:40] like amen he didn't even care if the
[48:42] other nine came with him when he went to
[48:44] church right he was going with a purpose
[48:48] amen he had a loud voice and that loud
[48:51] voice wasn't Go Lions go Chiefs
[48:57] it was I want to glorify the one who
[48:59] just healed
[49:01] me that's right and he fell down on his
[49:06] face at the feet of
[49:09] Jesus giving him
[49:13] thanks and it was important for God to
[49:16] know that he wasn't a Jew he wasn't a
[49:20] what we would call a
[49:24] chosen uh his chosen people
[49:28] it was a
[49:30] Samaritan telling me that God will
[49:33] recognize me if I give him
[49:37] thanks and Jesus answered answering said
[49:42] where there not
[49:44] 10 but where are the nine this the
[49:47] subject here is he's he's getting praise
[49:50] he's getting honor and and Jesus is not
[49:52] saying well I'm glad you came to be the
[49:54] example for everybody else at church
[49:56] there was nothing like that his mind was
[49:59] on the praise that was being due to him
[50:02] that he wasn't
[50:04] receiving his atttention was I'm only
[50:07] getting one tenth of the praise I should
[50:09] be getting in this
[50:13] service he asked the question where the
[50:16] nine we could say Jesus was asking where
[50:19] did the Thanksgiving goal
[50:23] amen there are not found that return to
[50:26] give glory to God save this
[50:31] stranger and he said unto him arise go
[50:34] thy way thy faith have made thee
[50:38] whole you know there's a blessing that
[50:41] only comes from those who fully give God
[50:45] glory yes I believe that now if Jesus
[50:48] who's no respector persons would ask the
[50:51] question where are the nine that were
[50:54] not making enough effort to bring God
[50:57] the glory that was due to him then I
[50:59] believe Jesus who is the same yesterday
[51:01] today and forever would be asking the
[51:04] same thing to to any person who comes
[51:07] into church who God blesses them in some
[51:10] fashion formal way and they don't make
[51:13] the effort to give the glory that's due
[51:15] to his
[51:16] name and I don't want God in this church
[51:20] looking at me saying where are you
[51:23] supposed to be worshiping me amen
[51:27] in other words if I don't if we don't
[51:29] worship God because we don't feel like
[51:31] it you're robbing God of his glory amen
[51:36] because he's due your
[51:38] worship amen because you're
[51:42] special not what I'm saying he's worthy
[51:46] of the praise of a
[51:50] hypocrite I think we'd have to be pretty
[51:52] low not to worship God
[51:57] I know that's a hard one but look the
[51:59] very fact that you woke up with breath
[52:01] today ought to give you something inside
[52:02] of you to say thank you Jesus we get
[52:05] we're just like the world you know we
[52:06] wake up taken for granted the things
[52:08] that God has given us so I'll say to you
[52:11] where did the Thanksgiving go I know
[52:14] you're not getting what you want you got
[52:15] treated bad and this is happening and
[52:17] that's happening but I'll tell you just
[52:18] look to what God has done for you amen
[52:22] how's that song Go count your blessings
[52:24] name them one by one right amen the very
[52:27] fact that you would be truly a grateful
[52:30] person makes you an
[52:34] oddball it makes you an oddball
[52:36] especially to The
[52:38] Ungrateful they look at you
[52:40] weird a person that would actually
[52:43] rejoice when they're going through a
[52:45] fiery trial which seems
[52:48] strange can you say
[52:51] Amen that they could be so forced so
[52:55] focused I should say God in the middle
[52:57] of their
[52:58] trial that they're not looking at the
[53:02] the problem but they're looking at The
[53:04] God Who allowed the situation to take
[53:07] place for their
[53:09] good can you say Amen to that do not all
[53:12] things work together for the good I mean
[53:14] when you see somebody going through a
[53:15] trial and they're not murmuring they're
[53:17] not complaining you but they're saying
[53:18] Lord I count it all joy that's an
[53:21] oddball but you know that's God inside
[53:23] that man that's what that is or in that
[53:25] woman
[53:28] I've always believed if you're going to
[53:30] do anything do it with all your
[53:32] heart do it with purpose do it with
[53:35] passion do it with ambition do it with
[53:37] aspiration do it with motivation do it
[53:40] with value do it with
[53:42] substance I say do it with all your
[53:45] heart it ain't worth doing it at
[53:47] all I'll tell you when God made you he
[53:50] didn't make you halfway when he saved
[53:53] you he didn't save you halfway he put
[53:56] his whole heart into you he gave you his
[53:58] word he gave you his word and it's
[54:02] perfect word
[54:05] amen why would we want to be
[54:07] half-hearted back to
[54:10] him they that worship God must worship
[54:13] Him in spirit and in truth for the
[54:17] father seeketh this type of worshipper
[54:20] to worship
[54:21] him one who's willing to step out of the
[54:24] flesh the fleshly mind
[54:27] to get away from their worldliness and
[54:29] their thoughts and their feelings and
[54:31] their their worldly deeds and their
[54:33] worldly
[54:35] words and to step into the spirit realm
[54:38] where there's nothing that matters
[54:39] except Jesus Christ and I'll tell you it
[54:41] takes effort to get there it doesn't
[54:43] take any effort to go through those
[54:45] doors and sit in this seat in the flesh
[54:47] it takes no
[54:48] effort but to die out to the flesh to
[54:51] get in the prayer room mean business
[54:53] with God step in here and say I want to
[54:55] meet God and I want to I want to enter
[54:57] into the spirit and worship him because
[54:59] he is the spirit and they that worship
[55:01] Him must worship him in the spirit it is
[55:03] not an option to God it may be an option
[55:05] to us but it's not an option to God he
[55:07] will not accept any kind of worship In
[55:09] the
[55:11] Flesh
[55:14] amen all these worldly churches out
[55:16] there that come together and have
[55:18] entertainment they think they're
[55:19] worshiping God
[55:30] tell you God has put our sins in the sea
[55:32] of
[55:33] forgetfulness we ought to be the
[55:35] happiest people in the world Amen we
[55:38] just need to focus on how worthy he is
[55:40] amen how good he is that his mercies are
[55:43] new each
[55:47] day he's worthy he's worthy he's worthy
[55:50] I want you to place yourself next to the
[55:53] cherabin the syapin and all the Angels
[55:55] the heavenly
[55:56] host join along with them who are
[56:00] worshiping God did you know they're
[56:01] worshiping God they're honoring God
[56:04] their mind is not on what we're going to
[56:05] do when we get out of here for
[56:08] worship amen and I'm telling you this
[56:10] stuff needs to be taught in their
[56:12] homes children don't just grow up to
[56:15] love the
[56:16] Lord they
[56:19] don't and I think about it that God has
[56:22] placed us as parents in a
[56:24] pivotal part of their
[56:27] lives to be Christ to them until they
[56:30] receive Christ I think that's the
[56:32] greatest honor for a parent right there
[56:35] the greatest honor Revelations 5:11 says
[56:39] and I beheld and I heard the voice of
[56:43] many angels round about the throne and
[56:46] the Beast and the elders and the number
[56:48] of them were 10,000 times 10,000 and
[56:51] thousands of thousands has anybody got
[56:53] that number figured
[56:54] out that's a that's that's a lot this is
[56:57] around the
[56:59] throne that is a that's a lot of
[57:02] angels I wonder if any of them were just
[57:04] sitting talking about you know what's
[57:05] going to be happening
[57:08] tomorrow they were saying with a loud
[57:11] voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
[57:15] to receive power and riches and wisdom
[57:19] and strength and honor and glory and
[57:22] blessing amen Worthy is the Lamb he's
[57:26] worthy to be praised now that's why I
[57:28] say I want us to join with them because
[57:32] that's happening whether we're doing it
[57:34] or not
[57:35] am and every creature which is in heaven
[57:39] and on Earth and under the
[57:41] Earth and such as are in the sea and all
[57:45] them that heard I saying blessing and
[57:49] honor glory and power be unto him that
[57:52] sth upon the
[57:53] throne and unto the lamb for ever and
[57:57] ever and even today today even today
[58:03] today today is not exempt and today is
[58:07] not exempt in the
[58:08] sanctuary I believe there should be
[58:11] something inside of us
[58:14] bubbling to praise him with all of our
[58:17] heart amen there's just something about
[58:20] entering into the realities of God it's
[58:24] easy to put passion into your word
[58:26] worship when you're there it's easy to
[58:28] praise him to the degree that all that
[58:31] hear your voice they know where you're
[58:35] standing but when you
[58:38] say Praise You
[58:41] Lord going to do my
[58:44] part I mean I don't care who's looking
[58:48] at
[58:49] me I don't care what people
[58:52] think he's worthy to be magnified and he
[58:56] wants us to Magnify Him in front of one
[58:59] another he
[59:06] does when we come to God's house we
[59:08] ought to be given God our very best no
[59:11] excuses no rebuttal no reasons no
[59:14] tiredness no I'm not in the mood
[59:17] today because I know God's asking where
[59:21] is the Thanksgiving amen that's right we
[59:24] ought to Humble ourselves for what
[59:27] reason to to worship
[59:29] him a person that doesn't want to
[59:32] worship they're
[59:34] proud and I'll say it like this we need
[59:36] to Humble ourselves to give God the
[59:39] praise that he's worthy
[59:44] of don't wait around for somebody else
[59:48] to kind of pick up the service and make
[59:50] it so easy for you to join
[59:53] in because God is wanting you to be like
[59:57] that one
[59:58] leper like when he left he did not care
[1:00:03] if the other nine
[1:00:05] came God is looking at you and he says I
[1:00:08] don't want you to think about anything
[1:00:10] except how much I am worthy to be
[1:00:12] praised
[1:00:14] amen and when your focus is like that
[1:00:17] you you're so zoomed in you're in his
[1:00:20] spirit in his presence cuz I'm telling
[1:00:22] you if you were in heaven if you were
[1:00:23] around the throne you wouldn't be
[1:00:25] thinking and what you're thinking about
[1:00:27] today you wouldn't be worrying about
[1:00:29] what's going to what you want to do
[1:00:30] later today the only focus would be is
[1:00:33] he's here he's here I worship you you're
[1:00:37] worthy I think we just need to come into
[1:00:40] church with that attitude of worshiping
[1:00:42] him with our very
[1:00:45] best Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll
[1:00:47] draw a men unto
[1:00:50] me you know what it how good it is when
[1:00:52] you lift up Jesus those around you just
[1:00:55] feel better
[1:00:56] your children your your spouses your
[1:00:58] parents everybody feels better around
[1:01:01] you when you're lifting up Christ but as
[1:01:03] soon as you start Dow somebody
[1:01:05] else you just ruin the atmosphere
[1:01:08] because Jesus isn't in
[1:01:10] Downing he's not he's not a
[1:01:13] downer Jesus is not a downer amen that's
[1:01:16] a good
[1:01:17] sermon Hebrews 3:6 we're God's
[1:01:21] house you know we're God's house Hebrews
[1:01:24] 3:6 tells us If We Hold Fast the
[1:01:28] confidence and rejoicing of Hope firm to
[1:01:30] the end in other words God's going to
[1:01:32] stay right with you in your house if you
[1:01:35] keep rejoicing amen but the moment you
[1:01:38] like give back to that and say well once
[1:01:41] saved always saved I don't need to
[1:01:42] Rejoice I don't need to worship I don't
[1:01:44] need to give my
[1:01:45] best God that Grieves the Holy
[1:01:50] Ghost God can't dwell in that type of
[1:01:53] atmosphere so he goes and he just kind
[1:01:55] of takes his flight and he kind of
[1:01:56] waiting for you to get back to where you
[1:01:58] were when you first got
[1:02:00] saved when you first got saved you
[1:02:02] didn't say I'm not going to worship God
[1:02:05] I'm not going to say thank you for
[1:02:07] salvation there was something inside you
[1:02:09] that you couldn't stop you from saying
[1:02:11] thank you amen I think we should have
[1:02:14] that today I if you think I'm an oddball
[1:02:17] then you can just call me the Oddball
[1:02:19] Pastor I'm okay with it I believe God
[1:02:23] inhabits the Praises of his people
[1:02:27] Psalms 26 verse1 I want to read the four
[1:02:30] verses there starting with verse number
[1:02:32] one Speaking of the coming coming to
[1:02:35] God's house
[1:02:36] here that's what we're speaking about
[1:02:38] Judge Me Oh
[1:02:42] Lord for I have walked in my Integrity I
[1:02:47] have trusted also in the Lord therefore
[1:02:50] I shall not slide amen now examine me oh
[1:02:54] Lord and and prove
[1:02:57] me and try me my
[1:03:01] heart see he was he had a real
[1:03:04] relationship with God that he wanted to
[1:03:07] be serious with God he wanted God to be
[1:03:11] real with him and to get him to a place
[1:03:13] that he'd be perfectly
[1:03:16] pleasing I think this is the most
[1:03:19] beautiful attitude right
[1:03:21] here verse eight Lord I have loved thy
[1:03:25] habit ation of thy house and the place
[1:03:29] where thine honor it
[1:03:33] dwells verse seven that I may publish
[1:03:36] with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell
[1:03:40] of all thy wondrous
[1:03:42] works I believe we ought to come to
[1:03:44] church if nobody asks you to testify if
[1:03:47] nobody ask you to say something there
[1:03:48] ought to be something inside of you that
[1:03:50] says I am going to publish my voice with
[1:03:53] Thanksgiving today I am going to sing
[1:03:55] these songs like I mean them with the
[1:03:58] greatest part of my
[1:04:01] heart we're not making this church and I
[1:04:04] hope to I want to break that M today if
[1:04:06] I
[1:04:07] can
[1:04:09] amen I believe that we should from our
[1:04:11] heart have
[1:04:14] church break all the Traditions that the
[1:04:16] devil tries to put on us all the
[1:04:18] thoughts of the day all the things that
[1:04:19] we're going through all the problems
[1:04:21] that we
[1:04:23] have take a minute
[1:04:26] give God some Glory that's right amen
[1:04:29] let him know I Believe In You Lord
[1:04:32] you're more than able to do exceedingly
[1:04:34] above all that I all that I could ever
[1:04:36] think or want you're
[1:04:42] able he he wants to dwell in that type
[1:04:44] of atmosphere because I'm going to be
[1:04:45] honest with you that's who he
[1:04:47] is that's who he is he is not down here
[1:04:51] some little I don't care about you I'm
[1:04:54] not thinking about you I'm too busy
[1:04:56] doing other he's not down
[1:04:58] there he's
[1:05:00] God and we need to reverence him like
[1:05:03] he's God to to to to to desire to give
[1:05:08] thanks in in the sanctuary where his
[1:05:13] honor
[1:05:17] dwelleth Psalms 100 I think we should
[1:05:20] make a Joyful Noise unto the
[1:05:22] Lord come before his presence with sing
[1:05:27] do we really know if I could say this
[1:05:30] that the Lord he is
[1:05:33] God it is him that made us and not we
[1:05:35] ourselves we are his people and the
[1:05:37] Sheep of his pasture how many times we
[1:05:39] come in and we think that God is just
[1:05:41] like a you know co- partner with
[1:05:52] us now I can't
[1:05:54] imagine I just can't imagine
[1:05:57] ever ever any one of my children coming
[1:06:01] to me and looking at me as if I'm just
[1:06:06] their coal
[1:06:11] partner just it's just not going to
[1:06:16] happen now I'm speaking
[1:06:19] naturally because they're not my
[1:06:22] Heritage they're God's heritag
[1:06:25] belong to
[1:06:27] God but here's the thing they didn't
[1:06:30] birth me I did not come out from
[1:06:36] them I can't imagine sitting in church
[1:06:40] and looking at God is just someone he's
[1:06:42] just a co-equal with
[1:06:49] me now I look at him as my master right
[1:06:55] amen my head amen the creator of my soul
[1:07:01] amen if he chooses to make me a joint he
[1:07:04] with Christ that's his
[1:07:07] business up to half of the Kingdom
[1:07:09] that's him that's not me saying I
[1:07:12] deserve it I'm still going to worship
[1:07:15] him as he's Lord of lords King of Kings
[1:07:17] he created me that's the problem with
[1:07:19] Lucifer he didn't know who he got away
[1:07:22] from who created him I'm going to be
[1:07:24] like the most High I'm going to act the
[1:07:27] way I want to act nobody's going to tell
[1:07:28] me and we end up bringing that Spirit
[1:07:31] into church how is God going to get
[1:07:33] Glory from
[1:07:36] that where did the Thanksgiving go enter
[1:07:39] into his gates with Thanksgiving the
[1:07:41] Bible says and into his courts with

[1:07:49] wait till we're singing to do
[1:07:54] that the word should be praised the word
[1:07:59] should be praised for he is the
[1:08:01] word it's easy to feel good when you're

[1:10:37] robbed god of what he's owed to
[1:10:40] him you know how how we've done
[1:10:44] it he you don't understand what I'm
[1:10:48] going through you don't know what I have

[1:10:51] problems I have you don't know the half
[1:10:53] of it you know what you don't know my
[1:10:57] God that's all I want to
[1:10:59] say and I know it's pretty bold but I I
[1:11:03] I what I I know that the God that I know
[1:11:06] is the one when you're you're in jail
[1:11:08] you're chained up you're still praising
[1:11:09] him when you're in the fiery furnace
[1:11:12] you're still praising him when you're in
[1:11:14] the Valley of the wild you're still
[1:11:15] praising when you're in the Lion's Den
[1:11:17] you're still praising you swing those
[1:11:19] doors open you don't care you're an
[1:11:22] oddball that's the God I know that's the
[1:11:25] god I want to know amen that's the god I

[1:11:35] that you're worthy of today I'm not
[1:11:37] going to wait another day I've robbed
[1:11:38] you long
[1:11:41] enough here the angels are so
[1:11:48] faithful Harden not your heart it's a
[1:11:51] choice it's a
[1:11:53] choice we have a choice to FOC focus on
[1:11:55] how great God is and and to pay him what
[1:11:58] we owe him what's due to him which is
[1:12:00] honor and praise or by default we can
[1:12:04] just sit there and make a declaration
[1:12:07] that he is not worthy of your
[1:12:09] praise amen that's by default you sit
[1:12:12] there do nothing by default you are
[1:12:15] telling him he's not worthy of your
[1:12:19] praise I want that to
[1:12:22] stick and I'm okay if you say that's not
[1:12:24] true that's just John Martin I'm okay
[1:12:27] you'll meet that someday because it is
[1:12:29] the truth he's worthy of all praise we
[1:12:32] get so proud that we just we just we
[1:12:34] we're so into ourselves that we can't we
[1:12:37] can't get into Christ we can't get into
[1:12:38] the spirit we can't worship Him in
[1:12:40] spirit and
[1:12:44] Truth Psalms 5 verse 14 Psalms 50 ver14
[1:12:50] offer unto God Thanksgiving and what
[1:12:55] does this say pay thy vows unto the most
[1:13:02] high oh yeah you owe the moment you wake
[1:13:06] up in the morning you owe God
[1:13:08] Thanksgiving
[1:13:10] am he gave you another day of life a
[1:13:13] chance to serve
[1:13:16] him look the whole world wakes up
[1:13:18] breathes and cares nothing about God
[1:13:21] that's right and they will pay for every
[1:13:23] day they will pay for every day day
[1:13:25] because they're robbing God but if you
[1:13:27] want to get blessed by God don't Rob
[1:13:30] them don't Rob
[1:13:33] them anybody ever been so down in the
[1:13:35] dumps you just start praising God and
[1:13:37] all of a sudden you feel better you know
[1:13:39] what I'm talking
[1:13:40] about God says you put me first and I'll
[1:13:43] bless
[1:13:45] you you wait on me I'll lift you up into
[1:13:49] Heavenly
[1:13:50] places give God what's he's it's first
[1:13:53] don't sit around and say well God you
[1:13:55] got to work out everything in my you got
[1:13:56] to you got to heal me you got to do that
[1:13:58] you got to do everything and you know
[1:13:59] what then I'm going to praise you
[1:14:00] because you're God no that ain't the god
[1:14:01] you're
[1:14:02] serving the god you're serving deserves
[1:14:05] to be praised no matter
[1:14:07] what no matter what pay thy vows to the
[1:14:10] most
[1:14:11] high even Jesus himself said praise was
[1:14:14] perfected in
[1:14:16] babes so as soon as we leave the Babe
[1:14:19] stage I think the question starts
[1:14:21] arising where did thy Thanksgiving go
[1:14:26] where did it go because when we were a
[1:14:28] babe we were praising God with our whole
[1:14:32] heart well you know things are harder
[1:14:35] now what's harder is you're not focusing
[1:14:38] on the one who saved
[1:14:41] you come on it's okay if you say Amen to
[1:14:45] the
[1:14:46] word how would you feel if someone came
[1:14:48] to you into your house and started doing
[1:14:50] whatever they felt like doing in your
[1:14:52] house
[1:14:55] come on now I know you want to make them
[1:14:57] feel at home when they come into your
[1:14:58] house but what if they went beyond that
[1:15:00] anybody ever come in your house and
[1:15:01] started doing things that you didn't
[1:15:03] want them to do and you said I didn't
[1:15:04] sign up for this come on you know what
[1:15:07] I'm talking
[1:15:08] about and all of a sudden they lose
[1:15:10] their welcome like you want it's okay
[1:15:12] come on over but they went too far has
[1:15:14] anybody ever experienced
[1:15:17] that but God experiences is
[1:15:20] that when we come into his house which
[1:15:23] we're all welcome amen
[1:15:25] but he wants us to come in in Spirit
[1:15:28] come in with praise come in with
[1:15:32] Thanksgiving and don't make his house a
[1:15:35] den for Just
[1:15:40] selfness Right self
[1:15:46] gain give him what he's worthy of honor
[1:15:50] his
[1:15:52] house make it what he wants it to be
[1:15:58] we don't want to grieve them here just
[1:16:00] like you wouldn't want me going into
[1:16:02] part of your house and messing it all
[1:16:07] up you might let me get away with it one
[1:16:10] or two times because you like me but
[1:16:12] after a while you're going to say
[1:16:15] uhuh and if we want to get blessed by
[1:16:18] God start reverencing him more in his
[1:16:21] house start reverencing his house amen
[1:16:24] this is not the John Martin church this
[1:16:27] is not the sun theight church this is
[1:16:28] God's house we got to put some name on
[1:16:30] it it's got to be some preacher here but
[1:16:33] it's still his house and we need to
[1:16:35] honor it as it's his
[1:16:38] house God wants his house to be a House
[1:16:41] of
[1:16:42] Prayer
[1:16:43] yes Psalm
[1:16:47] 69:3 Psalm 69:3 I will praise the name
[1:16:50] of God with a song and and will Magnify
[1:16:53] Him with thanks Thanksgiving can you say
[1:16:56] Amen this also shall please the
[1:17:00] Lord you want to please the
[1:17:03] Lord I'm not asking you to put $500 in
[1:17:06] the
[1:17:10] offering I'm not asking you to stay in
[1:17:13] vacuum the
[1:17:14] church except brother Ron or sister
[1:17:21] Amanda you want to please the Lord Just
[1:17:25] Praise Him get
[1:17:28] Beyond where you're at amen and thank
[1:17:34] him because he's asking the question
[1:17:37] where did the Thanksgiving
[1:17:38] go where did it
[1:17:41] go I will praise the name of God with a
[1:17:44] song will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving
[1:17:46] this also shall please the Lord better
[1:17:49] than an ax or a bolock that have horns
[1:17:54] and hoofs
[1:17:56] The
[1:17:57] Humble is going to see this they're
[1:17:59] going to hear the word they're going to
[1:18:02] say amen and they're going to be
[1:18:04] glad and your heart shall live that seek
[1:18:09] God Amen oh I love that do you know the
[1:18:13] more humble you are the more you'll
[1:18:15] praise
[1:18:18] God and the more proud you are the less
[1:18:22] you're going to praise God
[1:18:26] I'm not making a general blanket
[1:18:27] statement but I'm making a general
[1:18:29] blanket statement because Hypocrites
[1:18:30] plays the
[1:18:32] Lord but they can get at least humble
[1:18:34] enough to do
[1:18:36] it but then they have that ability to
[1:18:38] get proud enough not to be
[1:18:40] sincere you understand what I'm saying
[1:18:42] amen but God is still worthy to be
[1:18:44] praised in fact he said if you don't
[1:18:47] praise me the rocks are going to cry out
[1:18:50] he's worthy and he's looking for it he
[1:18:53] demands it think just the nature of God
[1:18:55] forget me and what I'm saying here right
[1:18:57] now think about this in heaven all the
[1:18:59] angels and everybody in heaven are
[1:19:00] praising
[1:19:01] him now he set that up it wasn't us
[1:19:04] setting up Church down here he set his
[1:19:06] church up amen and I think what he told
[1:19:09] Moses is make sure you make the
[1:19:12] Tabernacle according to the pattern that
[1:19:13] I showed you in the mount I believe God
[1:19:15] wants to be praised here
[1:19:18] amen and and you are the church you
[1:19:21] should be praising him when you're not
[1:19:23] here amen
[1:19:26] amen Psalms 107: 19 then they cry unto
[1:19:30] the Lord in their trouble and he saveth
[1:19:33] them out of their distresses yes and he
[1:19:36] sent his word and he healed them and
[1:19:38] delivered them from their destructions
[1:19:40] notice there's an s on that
[1:19:42] thing all that men would praise the Lord
[1:19:47] for his
[1:19:48] goodness and for his wonderful Works to
[1:19:51] the children of men and let them
[1:19:55] sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving
[1:19:59] and declare his works with
[1:20:03] rejoicing I'll say this don't wait to
[1:20:05] after service to
[1:20:07] testify start rejoicing when the word
[1:20:13] comes when you feel in your heart I'm
[1:20:15] thankful just say praise the Lord I'm
[1:20:18] thank you thank you
[1:20:20] Lord I believe God is wanting us to
[1:20:22] stretch out from where we're at
[1:20:25] and I don't want to offend you for where
[1:20:27] you're at I just want to get you where
[1:20:29] God wants you to get
[1:20:32] to Psalms 116 verse1
[1:20:35] 17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice
[1:20:40] it's a sacrifice I understand you don't
[1:20:42] feel like doing it that's how much
[1:20:45] greater it's going to
[1:20:46] be I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
[1:20:49] Thanksgiving and will call upon the name
[1:20:52] of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the
[1:20:54] Lord
[1:20:55] now in the presence of all his
[1:20:59] people don't wait till you get
[1:21:05] home God wants you to do it in front of
[1:21:09] everybody well brother John this is

[1:21:46] how you respond to this
[1:21:51] message I want to be the one that comes

[1:21:58] a good Psalms but we're going to pass
[1:22:00] that Revelations 4:10 the 4 and 20

[1:32:49] winding down
[1:32:51] here I wonder this morning
[1:32:54] which leper are
[1:32:57] you which of the 10 are
[1:33:00] you well brother John I just want to
[1:33:02] make it real clear I'm not a
[1:33:06] leper well we heard Brother Bruce say
[1:33:08] that leprosy is a a type of sin and
[1:33:10] we're all
[1:33:12] Sinners so which sinner are
[1:33:17] you we've all been healed we're all
[1:33:21] saved
[1:33:24] are you just going on your way are you
[1:33:27] coming back to give God
[1:33:30] glory so my question is where did the
[1:33:32] Thanksgiving
[1:33:35] go are you the one or the ones that go
[1:33:40] your way or are you the
[1:33:42] one one of the ones that come back to
[1:33:44] give God
[1:33:46] glory Psalms
[1:33:48] 115:17 says the dead praise not the Lord
[1:33:56] neither any that go down into
[1:34:00] silence but we will bless the
[1:34:03] Lord from the from this time forth and
[1:34:07] forever more praise the
[1:34:13] Lord I'm not asking you to stand but I'm
[1:34:15] asking you this question where you stand
[1:34:18] in Praise will you stand for praise will
[1:34:21] you stand praising the the Lord will you
[1:34:24] take a stand for praising God will you
[1:34:28] take a stand for giving him the praise
[1:34:30] that's due to
[1:34:34] him did you you remember you've been in
[1:34:37] churches where they pass the plate right
[1:34:40] you know the feeling you get when
[1:34:41] they're passing the
[1:34:43] plate right you know that feeling you
[1:34:45] get or sometimes you've gotten let me
[1:34:48] just say it like
[1:34:50] that like oh no they're passing the
[1:34:53] plate that's the first thought you get
[1:34:55] oh no they're passing the
[1:34:59] plate this is not my favorite part of
[1:35:01] the
[1:35:03] service and then you're watching where
[1:35:05] the plate is and you're kind of timing
[1:35:07] out when it's going to hit your
[1:35:10] roll and then you're
[1:35:13] thinking how much should I
[1:35:17] give depending on what kind of pressure
[1:35:20] you're
[1:35:21] under you're hoping you left your
[1:35:27] wallet so you pull out your
[1:35:30] wallet depending how you're feeling and
[1:35:32] all the emotions and the feelings you
[1:35:34] make a
[1:35:36] decision you ever been there and you put
[1:35:39] your money and as you're putting it in
[1:35:41] you feel good that you're
[1:35:44] giving then you have this thought did I
[1:35:47] give enough amen did you ever have that
[1:35:50] thought when you gave an offering did I
[1:35:52] give enough
[1:35:57] I want you to
[1:35:59] consider are you giving God enough
[1:36:06] praise I know we can always rely on God
[1:36:09] knows my
[1:36:10] heart but God wants to see your hands
[1:36:13] lifted yes he wants to hear you shout am
[1:36:17] he wants to hear you exalt amen magnify
[1:36:21] amen lift up I mean he there's many
[1:36:23] words in the Bible that shows how God
[1:36:26] wants to be
[1:36:29] praised and I believe as we step into
[1:36:32] that we can give an offering that's that
[1:36:36] he's pleased
[1:36:43] with do you believe that inside of you
[1:36:47] lies
[1:36:55] the praise that he's worthy
[1:37:02] of can you make a a decision to bless
[1:37:06] his name
[1:37:08] more to exalt him to give him thanks to
[1:37:11] glorify him to shout to magnify to sing
[1:37:16] to express to say I love you with all my
[1:37:19] heart my last scripture I want to share
[1:37:21] with us is in Hebrews 13:12
[1:37:24] Hebrews 13:12 wherefore Jesus also that
[1:37:27] he might sanctify the people with his
[1:37:30] own blood he suffered without the gate
[1:37:34] want you to think about what Jesus did
[1:37:36] for
[1:37:37] you you know I'm still in debt to him
[1:37:40] brother
[1:37:41] Orlando since the day I realized he died
[1:37:44] for me amen I
[1:37:47] feel I know that I can't pay that debt
[1:37:50] but I'm still in debt amen
[1:37:54] I'm still in debt am and I love I love
[1:38:02] it I love that
[1:38:04] relationship in fact he wants me to
[1:38:06] remember it when I get to heaven he
[1:38:08] wants he's going to come up and he's
[1:38:09] going to say see these these nail prints
[1:38:12] in my
[1:38:14] hand let us go forth therefore onto him
[1:38:20] without the camp bearing his reproach
[1:38:23] amen amen for here we have no continuing
[1:38:27] City amen but we seek one to come amen
[1:38:31] by him therefore by him therefore let us
[1:38:34] offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[1:38:39] continually and that is the fruit of our
[1:38:42] own
[1:38:43] lips giving thanks to his
[1:38:47] name now verse 16 is for us that seem to
[1:38:51] forget verse 15
[1:38:53] but to do good and to
[1:38:57] communicate what we just said in verse
[1:38:59] 15 forget not in other words don't
[1:39:03] forget to praise the Lord amen for with
[1:39:06] such sacrifices God is well please let's
[1:39:09] Stand
[1:39:11] Together be an oddball stay filled with
[1:39:14] Thanksgiving amen
[1:39:34] in your heart I just want you to think
[1:39:36] about this that God is just simply
[1:39:38] calling us to a higher
[1:39:43] praise it to some of us it may just be
[1:39:46] more sincere to some of us it may
[1:39:49] be taking advantage of the opportunity
[1:39:52] to to worship the word when it's being
[1:39:55] preached cuz sometimes I think we just
[1:39:58] some of us kind of just sit and then and
[1:40:00] we wait till the end to say something
[1:40:02] and it's
[1:40:04] like God is speaking say thank you Lord
[1:40:06] for what you're you're feeding me amen
[1:40:10] because it's that
[1:40:13] word that's what we live by when we
[1:40:16] leave God wants us to take this
[1:40:20] word and worship him all day amen Amen
[1:40:24] to create that atmosphere around you of
[1:40:29] Thanksgiving to let others know that you
[1:40:32] have made your
[1:40:34] creator a God that's worthy to be
[1:40:38] praised I don't think praise is just for
[1:40:43] church but I think it's a place that we
[1:40:45] should be able to worship him better
[1:40:47] than any other
[1:40:49] place I know it's easier to praise him
[1:40:52] when you're alone nobody's around
[1:40:53] understand
[1:40:54] that but this is his house you come to
[1:40:58] his house where his honor dwelleth where
[1:41:02] his people dwelleth and God wants to be
[1:41:04] magnified in his house I would like to
[1:41:07] see the house come down as it
[1:41:11] were but you know we all got to get this
[1:41:13] revelation of how worthy he is right not
[1:41:17] what we're trying to make here but to
[1:41:20] get out of ourself and to to to come
[1:41:23] he's calling us
[1:41:25] to amen let's sing Thou Art
