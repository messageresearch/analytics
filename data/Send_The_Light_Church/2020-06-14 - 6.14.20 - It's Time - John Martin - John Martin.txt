he's got you in his mind and that he wants to bless you and lift you up and to have any places in Christ Jesus Amen turn with me if you would to Saint John chapter 17 we've got a couple of Scripture readings here the first one in st. John 17 and then the second will be in revelations chapter 22 god bless each of you that have come out I know it gets I it's going to because it may be even harder I think knowing that we have streaming capabilities because you can still hear the word and streaming but I just believe we need to gather together all the more as we see the Day approaching amen something about his presence but we are so grateful for the live streaming because it helps in times like this we're brother Marty and sister Kathleen can't be with us or brother Bruce it's sister Donna Beach so far away or we're on vacation things like that so it has its place and we're grateful for it and we just pray that God would bless each and every one that's live streaming today amen amen let's look to the Lord and in a word of Prayer before we read his word Heavenly Father we thank you that you've placed a desire in our heart whether we're live streaming or whether we're here Lord to want to grow in the things of God to want to make sure that we're we're ready and to allow that word to vindicate we're ready to meet you Lord father we pray this morning that your great Holy Spirit would come and deal with every one of us Lord it's only you can our words they they fail Lord even if we speak your word but it's not your spirit speaking it Lord it can fail as well but Lord when your word anointed is spoken by you Lord it can deal with our hearts and bring us to the statue of a perfect man and we pray that you take this time Lord that we were placing in your hands and asked you to take this precious word that's eternal and make it real to us make it alive in this give us revelation of it Lord we have prepared our hearts the best we could we've worshipped you in spirit and in truth and now Lord we place ourselves on the altar we ask that you would give us revelation of the things that you speak to us today we give you the glory and honor for it as we son that song in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord Saint John chapter 17 verse starting with verse number 20 neither Jesus in his great prayer here in the upper room before he gets ready to separate from his disciples and there was a concern that he had he says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou has gave us me I have given to them that there that they may be one even as we are one I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me praise the Lord then revelations chapter 22 starting with verse number 17 as a very big prayer that Jesus was praying for a oneness with any eternal God and human beings but Jesus I thank thee father because thou always hears answers my prayers amen verse 17 in the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take of the waters of life freely fry testifying to every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto the things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testify if these things say surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen and God bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message it's time it's time for our subject becoming one with God it's time to begin to manifest Christ more more amen because we don't want to be satisfied with how much we are manifesting Christ what I think about the there is a a group that doesn't go on a rapture then waits a thousand years go through the white throne judgment some are saved and some are not now the ones that are saved there was a part that they missed out on they missed out on the thousand-year reign they missed out on the honeymoon miss out on being the bride so there was a part that was taken out of the book of life so we don't we we don't want to miss anything that God has for us amen now here Jesus in st. John chapter 17 was praying now Jesus was a man that believed in prayer before he went to Calvary he was preparing his disciples for his his natural separation he said I'm going to be crucified he says let not your heart be troubled leaving me he says I'm going to send you a comforter and it will be me in the form of the Holy Ghost amen and there's many things I want to say to you right now you really need need to hear them but you can't handle it right now but when the Holy Spirit comes when I come in the form of the Holy Spirit I'm going to be inside of you and you're not going to easily be offended you're going to be able to take what I'm saying to you because I'm on the inside the view of it just on the outside you can't handle it and when I come back in the form of the Holy Spirit I'm going to lead and guide you into all truth for the spirit of truth will not speak of himself this is so wonderful because you know there's a good indication we can figure out what Spirit is doing is speaking to us if it's speaking of God or if it's speaking of itself amen because you can be speaking the Word of God but yet speaking yourself jesus said in Saint John 15:15 I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known auntie isn't that wonderful that we can be so close to God that he just he shares everything there's a oneness amen he says you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and I've ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain now whatsoever he he shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it to you these things I command you that you love one another God has chosen us to be one with him not just to be saved or make it to heaven no God chose us to be one with him one in purpose to be in the same image that God created Adam in God chose us from the foundation of the world to bear his fruit and that that fruit would continue being fruity so other people can see it he ordained us from the beginning to love one another everyone exactly the way he loves everyone not partial even the enemies when we were originally in the mind of God we were manifested in his likeness in the likeness of God just like Adam was when God said let us make man in our image he visualized Adam being just like him he didn't it wasn't like well let's make in our image and like opening the back a box of Cracker Jacks and and we wonder what the prize is going to be when you get down to the bottom of it no Jesus knew exactly what Adam would be there was no doubts no questions he was he had in his mind to be a mini creator have dominion over everything even the most subtle beast to have power to what to love to submit to the Word of God to obey the Word of God to be grateful to be thankful amen to do the will of him who hated him there was a complete oneness between Adam and God Adam a spirit man also manifested in the flesh and perfect harmony and oneness with his God now when we were in God's mind before there was ever world God visualized us being one with him in the same way he knew same love same submission same gratefulness thankfulness everything was the same but he knew it wouldn't be that way because we would be boring pervertedly and when we were born pervertedly that just messed everything up our will became selfish we were filled with hatred we were proud we wanted to do our own will we didn't want to do the will of our Father who created us so we were born unacceptably to God but it never changed his original plan in his mind he provided a way for us to be born again with a new nature to take on what he originally planned from the beginning to act like he act to love like he loved to do his will were born by the will of God it's the only acceptable way the Bible says that by one spirit we're all baptized into the body Christ and it is God's holy spirit that makes us one with God makes us United with God his Spirit transforms our minds the way that we think we begin to think like him that's why Paul said in Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 let this mind that was in Christ that this might be new which also was in Christ Jesus we can't have the mind of God we just got to get rid of ours can't put a boat there there's that room for both people who thinks two different ways a double minded man he's unstable in all his ways so what kind of mind is that kind of spirit is that and Paul said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus what kind of mind is that Paul defines and describes and helps us clearly understand the mind of Christ in Philippians chapter 2 turn with me if you would they're the footings chapter 2 as we read this take note this is exactly what God had in his mind when he had you in his mind at the beginning before the foundation of the world he visualized his mind in you and this is exactly what Jesus was praying for in st. John chapter 17 that there would be a oneness between them you can't be one with Christ and not have the mind of Christ you know where would we be without the blood of Christ to cleanse us and it the blood of Christ makes us one by covering us but we still need to be filled with the life that was in that blood in order to think like him to act like him to talk like him so he says here in flipping chapter 2 verse number 2 fulfil ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord and a19 this is the mind of Christ and this is the oneness like-minded same as the mind of Christ the same love as Christ being of one Accord Amen I just love this word Jesus said I and then and now in me that they may be perfect in one this is we need the mind of Christ for this to be fulfilled it's so it's a reality the way we think is very important the things that we let go through our mind the things we think about the things that we we say about the things that we thinking they're important they're either showing one ship with Christ or they're just your opinion let me just say this God knows every evil that's happening on the planet and every second of the day but he doesn't go around thinking about it talking about it well and on it so just because we're speaking truth it doesn't mean it's a good report it doesn't mean we should be there with that all right let nothing verse three let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mine this is the mind of Christ lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves know contents and others rather condescend to men of low estate condescend yourself to get down where they're at and help them this is the mind of Christ in other words let nothing be done in your fleshly carnal selfish powerful nature but when god's new nature inside thinking of yourself more humbly mourn worthily but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves now that's a big big challenge for some people all they can say is get more of the Holy Ghost and it won't be such a challenge look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others somewhere down the road in our journey from here to the promised land we need to put a halt to thinking about ourselves to talking about ourselves planning about ourselves we need to stop we need to put a halt to it it's not the mind of Christ it's not about us you know you take away some people you take away then talking about themselves and they don't got nothing to talk about let every one of us in this church be thinking praying caring and doing things for others she that's the message to this church the promised land is filled with living for others nothing short of that eternal light is living for others this is the mind of Christ this is the mind of the bride and the spirit and the bride say come there is a unity in the way that they think let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus it can be done don't say it's hard for me start believing him start reading the Bible more started saying lord help me to be humble like you are help me not to exalt myself against you lord your will who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God Jesus did not think his nature was different than his father's he knew where he came from who he was he had a revelation he said I come from God I go back to God his character was just like the character of the father brother Branham taught us if you want to know who God is look at Jesus Christ you'll know exactly how he acted he didn't have some look at me attitude he wasn't talking about me he was always talking about Jesus we're talking about the father God was manifested in the flesh Jesus Christ amen Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ was in the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature and we are coming into manifestation of the same image remember he is the firstborn among many brethren we can't keep such a wide gap I understand that we're not God but that doesn't mean I can stay down where the devil wants me to be I've got to believe that God can come into my life and change my nature change the way that I think and act and how I talk that I really can humble myself and live for others and esteemed somebody else better than myself and not be a respecter of persons and and only love certain people I mean I don't want to be down there where the devil wants me I want to be up in heaven II places with Christ Jesus and donal love everybody that's what I want so my question to you is do you know who you are do you ever a revelation of who you're supposed to be we're supposed to be in the form of God if you have that revelation then take on the same mind of Christ we have one mind one Accord esteem others better than yourself put others before you it says the things of others the things of others I want to challenge you how many of you have called somebody and it's concerned about them we're too busy in our lives we've got so much plans and so much things going on in such a direction that when we finally do connect with somebody it's on something so carnal or it's about herself now I'm not saying be a monk and live in a cave but what I am saying is we need to manifest the word we need to take time to manifest it alright verse 7 speaking of Jesus Christ or the mind of Christ in this but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men think about this this is who the father was this is who Jesus was when he manifested in the flesh and this is who we are we're not superior to others if you've got that nature where you have to you're too proud to get underneath somebody you don't want anybody to see so you got to like text them privately we need to stop acting like we're superior over others stop thinking like it stop talking like it we need to get rid of the reputation of continuously trying to build ourselves and look like were something in somebody else's eyes need to get rid of it don't make yourself of our reputation if that is in your mind it's the wrong spirit God didn't want to show off who he was yeah he got a burn when it comes time for God to show his glory he will but he's the only one that can do that we need to get rid of our reputation we need to realize or just like them until you become the servant of God then you're like Almighty God that's what would make you greater than them if you want to really become greater than another human being you need to submit yourself and become their servant and then you're just like Jesus Christ you're just like God that's what are you saying here we want to become we want to show were more than they are by what we know or what's wrong about Vann and it's not even the mind of Christ the mind of Christ is get underneath that person and help them get them up no matter where they're at it can be real low or real high but get underneath them and when you be do that then you're just like Almighty God we all want to be like that he says it Jesus even told his disciples want to be great because of all and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so he didn't stop he kept going with that attitude rate to the end of humility and unworthiness now we're talking about the mind of Christ and this is so important if we're ever going to be one with God oh you know I am not much every one of us is one with God but there is a difference between repenting getting baptized asking Calvary to take care of what's missing in their lives and becoming in the image of Jesus Christ and and being ready to take on the bride nature because the bride nature is the female part of God we're just like him the same image the same mind we don't have to try real hard to humble ourselves we don't have to put up some little image in front of somebody we don't have a form it's not a sales pitch it's not just acting like it right now because we're in front of people it's the life that we live we need the mind of crisis is important to the to the bride to the believer it's not just something while we're just shoot for the dark hope we hit it someday no it's something we practice with every thought that we think that comes into her head we begin to practice what we're doing with those thoughts humble thoughts this is what God visualized in his mind for you from the foundation of the world to be just like this now he knows we were born like that Adam was we weren't so we have to do a lot of suffering a lot of crucifying to the flesh to get to think like that because the love of God thinks no evil we don't have a problem sitting in our couch thinking evil about somebody and nobody will ever know it let's see the mind of Christ doesn't do that I can see where brother brand said this will not be a public show this is going to be done in secret yeah this is between those who love God more than anything this is what Jesus meant when he prayed for us to be one with him is to is to fulfill to have this type of mind in our thinking every day by God's own holy spirit we are missing and supernaturally baptized into the body of Christ and God's own seed inside of us it begins to Germany it begins to grow and we begin to become more like him when we're born again but it is apparent that we don't all grow the same some grow faster than others it's very apparent to me that we play a big part in how fast we grow don't put it all on God God don't look at you and say I don't want you to grow first oh I like your eyes I want you to grow real fast God ain't like that he's no respecter persons if we want to grow more then we got a humble ourselves more we got a cruise to sell crucify our flesh more we got to get a revelation of what it means to die out that he might increase amen as we receive God's Holy Spirit he leads us to become one with himself because it's him inside United with himself now Justin doctrine yeah I don't want us to become one Justin doctrine but in nature in the way that he acts the way that he handles situations on a daily basis the thing that we put such a little emphasis on well it really doesn't matter how we act really doesn't matter what we say what we think doesn't matter our temperature well I'll tell you physically if you get too hot you begin to think serious right there but you get a fever we need to put more emphasis on a daily basis what we're manifesting the attitudes that we pack around are we representing the selfish nature the way we talk and act or is it God's character God's holy spirit just doesn't lead us to become with one with the knowledge like I understand this you can have all understanding right can have all knowledge but we need his character that's the life we lived the Holy Spirit unites us with his character not just the knowledge of his word when his Spirit has preeminence in her life it would transform our minds to think more humble to talk more humble to act out more humble so we're still going to think we're still going to talk we're still gonna act but it's just gonna be with a different spirit because God dwells with them that are of a humble contrite spirit he says I am humble he's the high lofty one but he's humble learning me a meek I'm humble praise the Lord let all that I think say and do be pleasing to the Lord how many wants to be one with Jesus amen now there are many reasons that people would like to be one with God but the reason Jesus gave us was for his glory not for ours no doubt God wants us to be united he wants us he wants to be united with the bride unfortunately all of his wife isn't in yet all of his wife don't even know him yet they're out in the world so the rapture can't happen yet and he's got a particular interest with them his nature is to leave the ninety-nine you go after the one so God has a very big interest for those that aren't saved and when you feel that burden for the souls of others that's the Holy Ghost that's the Living God inside of you because I wasn't born with that I mean I wanted to beat up my brother I wanted to steal from the people that stole from me I wanted to be better than everybody that God's Spirit is so different you you can honestly look at people now and know that their deceit you can say Father forgive them they don't know what spirit they're under there's an anointing on them they don't even know they're acting selfishly another random I believe said that no man deserves to hear if every man hasn't heard at once received this message and I say that is where God's heart is that that's what brother grant said mission work it's always in the will of God it's awesome to think that when God was praying in this right before he went on to - to Calvary his last tiny spending with his disciples it's awesome to think that we was praying with his disciples that he was praying for you and I we were in his mind at the same time he was praying you believe that he didn't just pray for you he prayed for those who you would witness to look at verse st. John 17 verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word their word amen you have a word to share with somebody you have a ministry to share with somebody the gospel didn't stop with us we're not the last ones on the train we're not the last ones in the boat the lifeboat now at the time to get on board as she is passing by but if we wait too long we shall forever die there are souls to rescue there are souls to save it's up to us to send the light we need to send the light we see HUD unveiling his purpose for unity or oneness as Jesus prays to the Father that day verse 21 that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me look at the the purpose here for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son our oneness with God opens the eyes of the world that the Son of God may be seen in us that's the reason that word God is purpose in which he wants us to be one he's got all through eternity to do whatever he wants to do with us when were in heaven and he has given us the earnest of his spirit now which is love joy peace longsuffering but those things are not meant just to be for us selfishly why do I need to have to be long-suffering with myself why do I need to be meek with myself fruit so the spirit are needed so other people when you're when they're being when they're being bad that they can see the life of Christ inside of you now the purpose of being one with Christ is said that other people can see that that Jesus has been sent and he's been sent in you to them to manifest that he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the reason Hebrews 13:8 that's why God has given us the Ministry of reconciliation that the world may know that the Son of God has been sent because he he he's dead he's no longer seen in this body that he walked on the planet 2000 over 2,000 years ago for about 2,000 years ago but he's alive in us but what good is that living life inside of us if other people can't see it what would be a need then for oneness with God his his reason that he's given for oneness is that others may know that he's been sent not 2,000 years ago ain't gonna do no good from they want to know Jesus is alive today they want to know Jesus is the I am God that what he's done for others he can do for them yes the answer is Calvary but Cal Reyes has become real to them personal to them God's purpose for our oneness with him isn't just for us in our certification people's lives people's souls are depending upon it it is the heart of God I believe if Jesus was here in the flesh today at this pulpit I believe somewhere down the line he would have prayed the same prayer then others in this world may know that he's been sent and that God would use us the Holy Spirit would use us to reach them there is not one person in here that would say it doesn't matter to me if you want to cut my finger off I don't need it we want our fingers take my my I take my arm nobody wants to give up their body Jesus isn't gonna lose one member of his body not one but what he's looking for is someone who would take in to them who would take Jesus to them it starts out with carving out some time of your life to help somebody today don't wait til tomorrow don't wait til somebody comes by and says hey can you tell me about Jesus go yell you never taught his disciples stay here in go out and bring them in God wants people to know today that God sent a prophet with God's message for the hour that's ticket is ready no other message will work we need to stand united with Christ in prayer and his eternal purpose Amos 3:3 says can two walk together except they agree how can we walk close together with Christ and be in disagreement about his purpose when he's calling us to to share him with others but we don't agree with that united we stand with Christ divided we fall jesus said that even satan's kingdom was United now they're United in the purpose to divide and conquer to sow discord and division among the body of Christ but Jesus and his angels are rejoicing over one soul that unites with Christ so there's a unity in the kingdom of God as well when God spoke in the prophecy and he told us to to build our unity how do we do that we come together and pray one for another it starts right there because you know if we come and just tell all the people what they need to do well you know you're not gonna get too much United with somebody look how hard it is for you to even listen to me you literally have to be in the spirit to say it's of God because the flesh don't want to hear it but when we come together we pray for one another God would do things that we've never seen God's kingdom is United God's Spirit in the church is United Northern random even taught us if there was another spirit that tried to get in there by anyone somebody in the church somehow did the church coming in the church he says you just waxed that much closer together is that what he said that's exactly what he said he said now you're all one big happy bunch but the devil is also united to not keep it that way a lot of junk going out in the world it's confusing the people more and more we need to know where we stand in his purpose and what he's called us to do a person that has a burden for souls you can trust them a lot more that they care about the whole body it's not my notes as all came extra we need to stay united with the Living Word stay attached to the vine don't become separated stay attached to his love stay attached to his will stay United to fulfill the purpose of God verse 22 of st. John chapter 17 and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one now the glory that Jesus had was the glory of God Jesus gives us the glory of God now listen not glory from God but the glory of God it is the kernel nature of man to want to get glory and steal it from God because it's the reputation it's look at me what do we have to do anything about anything there's nothing good in me amen say it again I'm okay with everybody saying John there is nothing good in you because it's the truth why would I take offense to that I would just take offense to say that there's no Jesus in you as we give God Liberty in our hearts that's when the glory that's the glory that Jesus has given you it's when you give him Liberty to do what he wants to do inside of you in other words when we received the Word of God that's preached to us we become more like him because God don't give us the word just to give us head knowledge he's interested that that word becomes a part of our life second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord were changed what do we change we're changing to the glory of God see it's the glory of God we should never take glory away from the Lord if we do it's satanic we just don't know it yeah and the glory which thou gave us me I give them that they may be one that's the reason we got glory there'd be one with God even as we are one becoming one with God doesn't happen by church attendance it doesn't have my tape listening by typing by Bible reading it's when we slow down to submit to the word that we've heard agreeing with the word doesn't make us one our relationship with God doesn't grow necessarily like a marriage any two people that have gotten married or even when you begin to have a serious relationship now I've seen this many times many times but I've known people before they were married and then when they come and they get married they change both of them do there becomes a blending together they they learn to have to be long-suffering forgiving and and they learn they can do things all the way they want to anymore so there's like some neutral blending together and becoming like a new you like that with God in our relationship with God God don't need to change we do a hundred percent of the changing he's the same yesterday today and forever we are the ones that are changing to new creatures so the relationship is a little bit different we are the ones that always have to be humble and our human relationships I can say you listen to me or you listen to me you can't do that what God well you shouldn't do that with one another but that's human nature that's human nature our relationship with God completely relies on you becoming humble enough to submit to the word that he places in front of you every time you come to church that's how we become more like Jesus he remains the same he's just the same as the day he called me he hasn't changed one bit and thank God for that because when we get so lost in her sin and so down in the dumps and so depressed and so away from walking in the spirit we finally humble ourselves to get in prayer and we feel his presence come oh we begin to think back when he first loved us and how he forgave us and we're so grateful that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen verse 23 I in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me to think that God loves you as much as he loves himself that is just like mine bothering for he so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son turn with me to Ephesians chapter five verse number 25 Ephesians five verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that's how much he loved us that he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of the water by the word so what a precious moment we have right now then he gives us his word we're in the process of the washing when the word is being preached in reality he's expressing his love to you his commandments are not Grievous he wants that word to wash us to wash us of our I own ideas of our own plans of our of our of our reputation and the things that we want to do to get people to look up to us he wants to wash us of that stuff and he wants us to just be just so clean that the only thing he sees is himself amen praise the Lord that he might present to himself a glorious church having not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish well I'll tell you I got blemishes he's still working on me the love that God has given us is awesome the love he has given us Romans five verse five because the love of God is she'd abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us he didn't give us his unconditional love that we could conditionally love others know that love needs to be used to let the world know that Jesus is alive that that the father sent Jesus amen so the world can behold the glory of God John chapter thirteen verse 34 John chapter 13 verse 34 and I need to be moving so you need to be moving with me don't make me stop for you a new commandment I give you that you keep loving the same way you've always loved the way I love because it's not the wording gonna know that the father sent Jesus in you well just tell them I'm in the message now buddy brother branham's are probably gonna help anything think you can help one thing a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another on conditionally seven times seventy and by this love not your love but the love I put in your heart by the Holy Ghost that's why we need the Holy Ghost by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another John chapter 15 verse 12 this is my commandment in John 13 it was a new commandment in verse 15 is my commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you that made all his disciples feel like I am NOT doing that right now I have to start manifesting something greater than what I was now we were in the image of God this is how he visualized us to be one with him to love just like he loves and I'll tell you it's going to take a great manifestation no you aren't going to go on the cross and die for the world but you're going to get up and pick up your cross and follow him on a daily basis also people ain't gonna see that see the love of God they're just gonna see your love well Milo is pretty good you know you know my love is pretty good up wow you know I can do a lot with my love but it'll come short of them seeing Jesus and if you're not interested in them seeing Jesus and you're interested in your reputation because people can want to know you we people can want to know oh we could want not we but people we'd get a spirit on this that we want other people to know that we know Jesus for what reason for your reputation the reason we want people to know Jesus is so Jesus can help them there no we can do to help them except introduce the the bridegroom to the bride that they don't know their bride yet that's our job make ourselves of no reputation greater love hath no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends something about the family of God they're tight my my dad used to say when I was growing up he said blood is thicker than water family is thicker than friendships but God's blood makes his family that spirit will cause us brother brand would walk up to the pulpit he said good morning friends were they all bright some of them didn't even know the message sure but we need to be Christ everybody amen er my friends I'm calling you friends I'm laying down my life for he lay down his life for the world and you are my friends if you do the same for me that's what it means I if you do whatsoever I come in you means you lay down your life for me I got a quote I'd like to read from brother Branham in the Great Commission you think about laying down your life take my word brother Brennan says for this when somebody when someone does you wrong don't mention it all my my you just stop right there with the quote when somebody does me wrong I want to tell everybody about it do you ever hear somebody just talking about somebody doing them wrong what spirit is that well it was so wrong I know if I tell somebody they're just going to agree with me and then they're gonna get on my side so what what would that achieve you're building your kingdom your reputation I want to build God's take my word for this when someone does you wrong don't mention it maybe maybe his destination rests on your attitude towards him after going before God's throne will realize we're all guilty and need each other's help that's right brother preach it you'll begin to feel sorry for that person Satan relaxes when we're just busy shooting at one another I love the spirit and the Prophet because he taught us how to live a life people are gonna do here Jesus that offenses are gonna come we can't do nothing about it people are going to talk behind our back people are going to use us people are gonna destroy us but will they see Jesus anyway I don't want to just shine when everything's on my going my way it's time to shine when everybody's left you you're left alone nobody cares they've done well used you up you know the Bible says the rich have many friends but soon as their money leaves they're no longer needed The Closer that you are in your everyday relationship with God the more you'll be one with him the blood makes you one with Christ but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the character that comes from the Holy Spirit living inside of you the way we act and talk and handle life's issues and problems that's what we're that was an example right there is when somebody says something Zipit love covers a multitude of sin you sure you got something when you can zip your lip brother John are you talking directly at me no but I hope the Holy Spirit is because that was my prayer that the Holy Spirit would take this word and make it real to us not in a way to feel bad for the times we have talked about others but that we can make a stand I want to become one with God because there's too much religious spirits oh I'm one with God I love God I know God but they don't care about living that just a religious spirit we're talking about something that can take inventory when we become one with him we'll act more like him every day what talk more like him well say things like him we'll act like him you'll know how it is you know the more you're with somebody the more you begin to think like them or at least know how they think almost begin to end better anticipate the way they're going to act with a certain situation happens to them and we've heard it before when two people are together they kind of blend and they begin to look like one another and act like one another well we need to become like Jesus we need the mind of Christ so we know the way he thinks we begin to handle situations what would Jesus do in a situation like this are you with me we should be so close to thinking like the Holy Ghost we should be saying the same thing that he's saying the bride will be saying the same thing he says even in the midst of all the confusion the changing that's going on in this world the in this our the spirit and the bride are saying come there's no hope left but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ revelations 22 verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let that athirst come notice the first two are capitalized and the second one is not and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely come and he ends up in the second from the last verse in the Bible testifying that these things are true surely I come quickly to every single person that's ever lived their life has been a vapor of smoke it's been short it's been too quick for them we need a revelation of how quickly Jesus is coming we don't have much time left and it's not about just you being ready God wants you to be one so you can help others get ready that's the reason Romans chapter 8 verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in this you will have to suffer the more you want to become one with Christ because you'll have to die out to your way of loving with respect to persons or choosing who you're in love and who you're not going to talk to you that day for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly wasn't our we were willing to be born in sin but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain together until now there should be something in the bride of Jesus Christ that is screaming out saying come Lord Jesus come we can't allow ourselves to get so relaxed in this world we're not gonna get ready we're not gonna be concerned about others it's time the time is at hand lay aside everything and become him don't become like him become him don't just mimic him become him let him live his life so much through you it's no longer you your life is hidden hidden God Amen it's time to be one with Christ so the world will know that God has sent Jesus in you I want people to see Jesus in me it's time to be getting the rest of the family of God inside Christ yes let's take just take a little bit of time I'm counting if you just take a half hour next week and do nothing except that half hour except trying to hunt the bride I know that sounds ridiculous but it needs to stop start with that we can't just be lured bring the bride in Lord use me Lord I'm waiting Lord just this week open the door if you want me to talk to somebody we already know it's his will for us to do it we just got to go out we got to change the way that we look at those things it's time to manifest that we're one with Christ it's time for us to be hungry and thirsting for us his return it's time for Jesus to come Paul told Timothy in chapter four verse number eight he said henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not me only but I want you all them that love his appearing surely I come quickly let's stand together even so Lord Jesus Lord Jesus how many want Jesus to come soon when that hunger becomes so great that your life is just totally given over to him amen can we try singing make us one make us one it's been a long time since we think for the run usually started make us one make us one make us one undivided body make us one make us one for the sake of your name make us want anybody remember that we're gonna practice that one again and we're gonna teach that one again try not to go so many years without singing it a menacing bind us together find us together Lord bind us together with cords that Hannah Ebro my together nor Ida together Lord bind us together with love bind us together Lord bind us together with cords that cannot be broken mind us together Lord bind us together Lord bind us together with love one more time find us together Lord mind us together find us - together or find us [Music] or by us [Music] love [Music] amen we need his cord the cord of the Holy Spirit amen amen nothing can separate us from the love of God how many how many wants to be war one it's in our control he's he's placed this morning His Word in our lap and the greatest thing we can do is have a heart prepared have it a good ground take that word inside let it wash us that we may become one with him and usually I'll just say it like this it starts out with our attitude think about many things I'd like to say to you but you can't bear it now but when the Holy Spirit comes we can bear it brother Branham says we come to find out where we're at with God we hear the word we find out we're right then our attitude what do we want to do with it well I want to fulfill the reason that God wants me to be one with him not selfishly but now that he could take this body this body that I think is whatever and let him use it to go lay down it's his life again to lay down his life again in front of somebody that they may see him he just needs the best those humble enough will enough to do it amen let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you that you love us so much that you want us to know the truth about being one with you and the purpose of being one God we're asking you that you first forgive us where we've stoled your glory trying to build our reputation city of yours one others to know about us instead of only wanting them to know about you forgive us Lord where we've come short of being one with you forgive us for being so selfish with your love and using your unconditional love in a conditional way [Music] to those that we feel that we want to give it to it keeping it from those that we don't want to share it with Lord we're humbly asking at this time that you would fill us with a greater portion of your spirit a greater portion of your love and that we at this time what more the mind of Christ to think like you think humbly to be thinking about helping others the things of others concerned about others Lord we ask that you decrease our burden for the other members of the family that don't realize that they're part of this family yes and lord if there's somebody here in this room that's desiring to be used if you a little bit more than they've been used I pray that you draw them to that at time of prayer that you can begin to prepare their heart to go out with a boldness and let others whomsoever will let them see that you sent Jesus through them manifest that long-suffering that patience that joy that meat inist that temperance and restore the loss to you lord oh that there may be a unity and a rejoicing in heaven over that one's soul that you use somebody in this church to go reach Lord you're still saving souls use us Lord equip us with what we need lord I pray for each one here desiring to be more one with you today that you would grant to them the very desire of their heart bless them Lord show them day by day experience by experience things that are happening to let them see remind them and show them and Lord you've given you heard today but I believe it takes try to teach time to make it known in a greater way how we might become more one with you or that we say the same thing that the spirit is same it's time it's time or be recognized it's time and now we commit ourselves into your hands your honor amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you for your grace [Music] yes he has risen from the dead and he is more every knee shall bow every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord amen what your tongue gonna confess he's my

read us they're just looking at the manifestation that we love just like he loved where would we be if God did not cover our mistakes can you imagine if Jesus I know what side of the service I should be done preaching they came and told all of your precious brothers and sisters your mistakes and sins what makes us love God because he's so forgiving he puts in this you forget he can't remember it why wouldn't that same love inside of us make us want to it's the same spirit doing the same thing may Jesus bless each of you with him what what greater what greater blessing give could we have than
