[4:59] read in the word now and give you the
[5:02] praise for all these things in Jesus
[5:04] Christ's name we pray amen amen in
[5:07] numbers if you would turn with me into
[5:10] Numbers Chapter
[5:13] 13 we're going to read a portion of
[5:17] scriptures uh from when the 10
[5:20] spies uh or the the 12 Spies I'm sorry
[5:24] went into the promised land and came
[5:27] back with uh a report
[5:33] amen and we're going to start with verse
[5:36] number 23 if we could Numbers Chapter 13
[5:42] starting with verse number
[5:44] 23 and they came unto the brook of ishol
[5:48] and cut down from then a branch with one
[5:51] cluster of
[5:53] grapes and they bear it between two upon
[5:58] a staff and they brought of the
[6:01] pomegranat and the Fig can you imagine
[6:04] going to to to Meyers and and
[6:08] getting some grapes that it took two men
[6:12] and a staff to carry them out of
[6:15] Meyers these were huge the place was
[6:19] called uh the place was called The Brook
[6:22] escroll because of the cluster of grapes
[6:24] which the children of Israel cut down
[6:26] from then and they returned from
[6:29] searching
[6:30] of the land after 40 days and they went
[6:34] and came to Moses and Aaron and to all
[6:36] the congregation of the children of
[6:38] Israel unto the Wilderness pan to cadesh
[6:43] and brought back word unto them and unto
[6:46] all the congregation and showed them the
[6:48] fruit of the land and they told them and
[6:51] said we came unto the land whether thou
[6:54] sent us and surely it floweth with milk
[6:57] and honey and this is the fruit of it
[7:01] and it would have been good if they
[7:02] would have closed the book and
[7:05] ministered on
[7:08] that but nevertheless the people be
[7:13] strong uh that dwell in the land and the
[7:16] cities are walled and very great and
[7:20] moreover we saw the children of anoch
[7:22] there and the alites dwelt in the land
[7:25] of the South and the Hittites and the
[7:27] jebusites and the amorites dwell in the
[7:29] Mountains and the Canaan IED Dr by the
[7:31] Sea and by the coast of Jordan it just
[7:34] kind of seemed to be flooded with Giants
[7:37] and Caleb stealed the people and Moses
[7:40] and said let us go up at once and
[7:43] possess it for we are well able to
[7:48] overcome
[7:49] it but the men that went up with him
[7:53] said we be not able to go up against the
[7:57] people for they are stronger than we and
[7:59] they brought up an evil report of the
[8:03] land which they had searched unto the
[8:07] children of Israel saying the land uh
[8:09] through which we have gone to search it
[8:12] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[8:14] thereof and all the people that we saw
[8:16] in it uh are men of great
[8:19] statue and there we saw the Giants and
[8:22] the sons of anoch which come to come of
[8:26] the Giants and we were in our own sight
[8:28] as grasshoppers and so we were in theirs
[8:31] in their sight amen God bless you you
[8:34] may be seated I tell you this was quite
[8:36] quite a story we want to entitle this we
[8:39] are uh uh well able to overcome amen but
[8:44] before we get to that part I if we could
[8:46] just you know kind of get a background
[8:49] of this uh God's people had come out of
[8:53] Egypt and they spied out the land that
[8:56] God had promised them now the land that
[9:00] uh God brought them out of was
[9:03] Egypt and and they were going to the
[9:06] promised land now these were two
[9:07] different
[9:09] lands and if I could say it like this
[9:12] they represent two different
[9:15] Natures spiritually it was the same
[9:18] Earth occupied by two different groups
[9:21] of people just like the same soul is
[9:24] occupied by two different Natures are
[9:26] you with me now Egypt represent presents
[9:29] a man born with a selfish worldly nature
[9:33] and he's held captive to
[9:36] it and the children of Israel were under
[9:39] the taskmasters of Egypt and man is
[9:42] under the Taskmaster of a selfish nature
[9:45] he ends up doing only what his flesh
[9:49] wants to
[9:50] do both the Hebrews in Egypt and every
[9:53] man that's unconverted are both in
[9:58] bondage uh we we read Paul said for the
[10:01] good that I would do I do not but the
[10:03] evil which I would not do that I end up
[10:05] doing now if I do that which I would not
[10:08] it is no more I but sin that dwelleth in
[10:10] me and I find that a law that when I
[10:13] would go to do good evil is present with
[10:14] me so there is this uncontrollable law
[10:18] of that's inside a man and it brings him
[10:21] into bondage and that's why we got to be
[10:24] born
[10:25] again as there was no freedom for the
[10:28] Hebrews in Egypt there's no freedom for
[10:30] any human being until Jesus sets them
[10:34] free and he that the son is set free is
[10:36] free
[10:38] indeed now when the Hebrews or the
[10:41] children of Israel were set free in
[10:44] Egypt that represented justification to
[10:47] every
[10:49] believer the very fact that they came
[10:51] out of
[10:52] Egypt were set free from the Egyptians
[10:56] that represents justification
[10:59] just as if they were never in
[11:06] bondage God set him free didn't say were
[11:09] you good or bad he just sets them free
[11:12] nobody is worthy to be saved amen amen
[11:15] now they both rejoiced they both looked
[11:18] forward to the promised land when the
[11:21] children of Israel got out of Egypt they
[11:24] were dancing around and they were
[11:26] rejoicing that they were set free and
[11:28] they were thinking about the promise
[11:30] that God had promised them a promised
[11:32] land they weren't going to stay there
[11:34] they weren't going to stay by Egypt they
[11:35] weren't going to stay in the world they
[11:37] were going to go to what God had
[11:38] promised them and so is every believer
[11:41] that when he he gets saved he's he's
[11:43] excited he he wants to go tell everybody
[11:46] I remember when I first got saved I had
[11:48] to tell everybody that I was
[11:51] saved it was just
[11:54] exciting
[11:56] but a Justified believer
[12:02] may be
[12:04] forgiven and he may be set free from his
[12:07] past sins and sometimes even things
[12:10] change in his
[12:12] life but he is not completely free
[12:15] yet and this is important to understand
[12:18] just like the children of Israel were
[12:20] not completely
[12:23] free they were not completely
[12:26] free but they were Justified now
[12:29] if if God would have came right then and
[12:32] there in that state they would make it
[12:36] but God gave them a space of time to
[12:39] prove whether they really would love God
[12:41] or not and it was during that time of
[12:43] proving that they proved that they did
[12:46] not love God
[12:48] first so they weren't completely set
[12:51] free that's why there was a promised
[12:53] land and when you entered that Promised
[12:55] Land you were completely free he amen
[12:59] amen now the next they go through the
[13:02] Wilderness and just like the children of
[13:04] Israel went through the Wilderness every
[13:06] believer goes through this
[13:08] experience and this experience is really
[13:12] it's a type of
[13:13] sanctification which most people do not
[13:16] make it through this
[13:17] process most people that get Justified
[13:20] do not make it through the process of
[13:23] sanctification this process is really
[13:26] set to prepare us for the promis land it
[13:30] cleanses up our ugly nature it makes us
[13:33] worthy to enter in it tries us it proves
[13:35] us to see whether we're going to be
[13:37] faithful or Unfaithful whether we're
[13:38] going to be half committed or or all the
[13:41] way committed that's what this process
[13:46] does you've heard the saying before you
[13:49] can take a man out of Egypt but you
[13:50] can't take the Egypt out of the
[13:53] man so there's certain things you can
[13:56] you can take a man out of a you know
[13:57] he's been hanging in the bar all this
[13:59] time and you finally say okay we're
[14:01] going to make a deal you're not going to
[14:02] be in the bar anymore but still inside
[14:04] of them he wants to be
[14:06] there and the children of Israel even
[14:09] though they left Egypt there was many of
[14:11] them who wanted to go
[14:13] back they were mindful of the things
[14:16] they they they thought about the things
[14:17] that were easier and better because this
[14:21] this this sanctification process or this
[14:24] Wilderness process it it's it's not an
[14:27] easy process to go through through and
[14:30] the children of Israel they begin to
[14:32] murmur the Bible say they begin to
[14:34] complain about their situations and
[14:36] their circumstances and their conditions
[14:38] and they even wanted a different
[14:39] leadership here the leadership just
[14:42] stood in the Gap through these 10
[14:44] plagues and did all this work to get
[14:46] them to come out of the world they were
[14:48] set free they were real happy and all of
[14:50] a sudden this same leader they started
[14:53] having a problem with they wanted
[14:56] different leadership a different Captain
[14:57] somebody to take him back in in in a
[15:00] different direction for their life we
[15:02] see that so many times with people who
[15:05] come into the Lord and and they get
[15:07] started and you work real hard and all
[15:09] of a sudden they go through this process
[15:10] and they don't want you
[15:12] anymore they don't want the leadership
[15:16] anymore this is no different that when a
[15:19] Believer has been Justified
[15:22] saved he's saved and if he died at that
[15:26] point he'd make it but if he continues
[15:30] to walk
[15:31] on
[15:33] then what
[15:36] happens when you tell somebody that God
[15:40] wants to save
[15:41] you God wants to deliver you from these
[15:44] habits God wants to give you Joy God
[15:47] wants to give you peace God wants to
[15:49] fill your life with love get to a place
[15:51] where you can love others that that once
[15:54] that you
[15:55] hated now this becomes really exciting
[15:58] for person who's never experienced that
[16:01] and when they ex they repent they get
[16:03] baptized they accept Jesus Christ as
[16:06] their savior they're they're good but
[16:08] what happens through the process of the
[16:11] Wilderness sanctification when you you
[16:13] know you're sitting you're listening to
[16:14] the word and hear the word being
[16:15] preached and the word says you got to do
[16:17] this and you need to do this and you
[16:19] need to make sure about this and love
[16:21] your love one another and all these
[16:23] things they begin to lose
[16:25] focus of their Promised Land
[16:32] and they begin to saywell this you know
[16:34] nothing seems to change when I come to
[16:36] church everything just I still got
[16:39] problems and they lose focus of their
[16:43] Promised Land because they feel I'm
[16:46] saved and that's all they're looking at
[16:49] and you it's hard to go through through
[16:51] a sanctification process if all you're
[16:53] doing is looking at I'm
[16:56] saved you've got to see yourself
[16:59] as needy as I need God in my life I need
[17:03] I I I Can See Clearly how my nature is
[17:07] not pleasing to God and I need
[17:10] him so what happens to a lot of
[17:13] people when they don't keep their eyes
[17:16] on the promised land I'm going to tell
[17:17] you what the promised land is for the
[17:19] believer it is a complete nature change
[17:21] and I'm going to back that up here as we
[17:23] go through the scriptures it's a
[17:25] complete nature change that's what God
[17:28] promised the
[17:30] believer but
[17:32] because people don't focus on that and
[17:35] it becomes too hard this process and the
[17:38] trials and oh yeah I got to give up this
[17:40] and I gotta I got to be faithful and
[17:42] they're learning all these things and it
[17:43] becomes too hard you know what they
[17:46] become satisfied with their
[17:49] nature they become satisfied with it's
[17:53] okay that I have this nature that isn't
[17:56] quite like God and so they just learn to
[17:58] get used used to it are you with me and
[18:02] instead of focusing on the nature change
[18:04] they began to murmur about the things
[18:06] they have to go through the things they
[18:08] have to to do they begin to complain
[18:12] even complain about the
[18:14] preaching complain and make excuses and
[18:17] and uh why they don't believe and why
[18:20] they're not being faithful they begin to
[18:22] make excuses amen it is no different
[18:27] than the children of Israel what
[18:28] happened to
[18:31] them and they wander around in the
[18:33] wilderness
[18:36] process exercising their own will I
[18:39] don't have to do that I can do what I
[18:42] want to
[18:44] do you know you think about the
[18:47] scripture tells us about all the things
[18:49] they were murmuring and complaining
[18:50] about but you know God saw their
[18:53] thoughts which was much
[18:57] greater and there's so many people that
[18:59] are walking around in this process of of
[19:01] sanctification God's trying to prove
[19:03] them are you going to be faithful or
[19:05] not and they they don't seem to
[19:09] care they they they seem to be just
[19:12] satisfied with where they're at they're
[19:15] saved they're not even looking at the
[19:18] promised land
[19:19] anymore because they feel they got the
[19:22] Holy
[19:25] Ghost I'll say this part you have a
[19:28] portion of the Holy Ghost because
[19:30] brother brandham said justification is a
[19:33] portion of the Holy Ghost and I know
[19:34] brother Brandon said that the Holy Ghost
[19:36] is the promised land but it's more than
[19:38] the promised land because when you're
[19:41] Justified you have part of the Holy
[19:43] Ghost because that that was God that
[19:45] came down and delivered the children of
[19:47] Israel out of Egypt that was God that
[19:49] was God that saves the purpose that is
[19:52] the Holy Ghost that's God in
[19:54] you but that ain't the Promised Land
[19:59] brother darl said it's the most
[20:01] miserable place for a Believer to be is
[20:04] one foot in and one foot
[20:06] out
[20:08] halfhearted half
[20:11] committed the Wilderness you can't make
[20:13] up your
[20:15] mind I'm going into the promised land
[20:19] but you look you don't want to do that
[20:21] because it's too hard to get the nature
[20:23] change they're Giants standing in your
[20:25] way the giant ugly nature that don't
[20:27] want you don't want to
[20:29] crucify and you don't you don't want you
[20:31] know not to go back into Egypt because
[20:34] you know that's not right so you're
[20:36] stuck in the middle being what
[20:40] miserable
[20:42] miserable too many Believers remain in
[20:44] the wilderness content that their past
[20:48] sins have been forgiven but they don't
[20:51] want to labor at all to enter into the
[20:53] promised
[20:55] land now we're told in the book of of of
[20:58] Peter
[20:59] that an entrance shall be ministered
[21:02] unto you how to get in
[21:05] there but you've got to take the word
[21:07] and believe it for your personal life no
[21:09] matter what anybody else does we've got
[21:12] to get out of Leo DEA that that that
[21:14] that habit of just hearing the word and
[21:16] doing nothing with the word when you go
[21:19] home that to me is being stuck in
[21:22] leoda but God has a promised
[21:26] land now what is the Promised Land
[21:29] represent we're told it's the Holy Ghost
[21:32] but it's more than the Holy
[21:35] Ghost if Egypt represents a man born
[21:39] with a selfish worldly nature and held
[21:42] captive the propest land represents a
[21:45] man with God's
[21:50] nature do you see how you can have the
[21:52] Holy Ghost and not have God's nature and
[21:55] the the the message is is threaded with
[21:58] quotes from brother Brandon saying well
[22:00] if you got the Holy Ghost you'll do the
[22:02] same thing that God
[22:03] did it's threaded
[22:06] throughout because people say they got
[22:08] the Holy Ghost because they spoke in
[22:09] tongues or they did this or they did
[22:11] that and and they're ignoring the nature
[22:15] change so that's why I say the promised
[22:18] land is more than just the Holy Ghost
[22:20] because everybody's got a portion of
[22:22] it but the true promised land that you
[22:25] enter in is when you defeat the giants
[22:28] that are in in your life that are
[22:29] standing in the way from God coming in
[22:32] and reigning and ruling in your heart
[22:39] amen it takes the new
[22:43] birth it certainly does but it takes
[22:46] overcoming the giants that are standing
[22:49] in the
[22:50] way we have to fight we have to overcome
[22:53] that ugly nature first just like the
[22:57] children of Israel had fight it first
[22:59] before they entered in see it was no
[23:02] problem coming out of Egypt because God
[23:03] did all the
[23:06] work now God was saying I you want that
[23:10] you better believe for it you have to
[23:15] believe but they with their intellectual
[23:18] understanding said well I'm this big the
[23:21] Giants are that
[23:23] big and and they they they were using
[23:26] that instead of God promised it for some
[23:30] reason these Giants were such a much
[23:34] harder problem for God than taking out
[23:37] pharaoh and all of
[23:41] Egypt imagine how the devil can take the
[23:43] human
[23:45] mind over a period of time and begin to
[23:49] doubt God's
[23:55] ability Hebrews 4:9 says that there
[23:58] remain therefore a
[24:00] rest for the people of
[24:05] God been Justified been Sanctified
[24:08] there's there remains a rest for the
[24:11] people of
[24:14] God for he that has entered into his
[24:17] rest he has also ceased from his own
[24:20] works as God did from his and of course
[24:23] there could be a whole message that we
[24:25] could speak on this right now
[24:33] but you know we we do everything that we
[24:35] can to kind of control our
[24:37] temper and be careful about this and
[24:41] watch that I don't do that and all
[24:42] that's and I I
[24:46] shouldn't it's like we're working to be
[24:48] a
[24:50] Christian but when you enter
[24:53] into the promised
[24:55] land to where you give God control
[24:58] control inside of you now you have
[25:01] ceased from your
[25:05] works it's no longer you but it's Christ
[25:08] in me the hope of glory he's the one
[25:10] that's handling all this
[25:13] stuff and verse 11 says let us labor
[25:17] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[25:22] any man fall after the same example of
[25:26] unbelief
[25:30] now brother brandom taught us that that
[25:34] rest is the word of
[25:38] God you rest in the word it's when you
[25:41] and the word become
[25:43] one look if you're in if you are if
[25:47] God's got his arms wrapped around
[25:49] you what do you have to fear no matter
[25:52] what's happening on the
[25:54] outside but when you're not in his arms
[26:00] Jesus is in the boat and you're slipping
[26:02] in the water and you're
[26:06] Jesus see there's that distance but he
[26:09] said I'll never leave you I'll never
[26:11] forsake you I'll be with you even in you
[26:13] to the end that is that rest that's the
[26:16] word of God you're resting on God's word
[26:19] he cannot
[26:20] lie not come short
[26:28] we enter into the word of
[26:30] God what that means is it becomes
[26:33] manifested in our life we no longer
[26:35] quote it we no longer think about it and
[26:38] then we don't think about it but you and
[26:40] the word become
[26:43] one so we can say that that this rest is
[26:47] also the promised land
[26:49] rest it is the nature
[26:53] change like
[26:59] many of us used to smoke and drink we
[27:01] don't do that
[27:02] anymore we could say we smoke and drink
[27:04] as much as we want
[27:06] to because we don't want
[27:09] to because God don't want
[27:12] to see we've entered into
[27:16] that but there's more for us because
[27:19] we're talking about a complete nature
[27:22] change so don't be satisfied with a
[27:25] partial change
[27:29] Hebrews 3:7 says God was grieved 40
[27:32] years with the children of Israel and
[27:34] their carcasses fell in the wilderness
[27:37] and they could not enter into the
[27:39] promised land rest because of their
[27:42] unbelief right they they not denying
[27:46] that they were saved that God saved them
[27:48] out of they never denied that God saved
[27:51] them out of
[27:55] Egypt but they did not continue you to
[27:58] go onto the promised land and and as
[28:01] brothers and sisters in Christ as Sons
[28:04] and Daughters of God we must understand
[28:07] that God has something more for us amen
[28:11] and the devil's doing everything he can
[28:13] the news is doing everything it can the
[28:15] problems in the world the problems in
[28:17] her home the problems in her life our
[28:19] financial our bank account everything is
[28:21] pointing us to distract us away from the
[28:25] nature change that's the true promise
[28:28] for us don't say I've got the Holy Ghost
[28:31] don't say
[28:35] that don't say
[28:37] that don't say that as an
[28:43] excuse Paul said I press towards the
[28:46] Mark I haven't
[28:49] attained he said I it isn't as I've
[28:52] attained or I I'm I'm I'm there he says
[28:56] but I'm pressing what was he pressing
[28:58] the Mark what's the Mark it's the image
[29:00] of Christ it's the it's the nature of
[29:02] God inside of
[29:07] man he could have I've got so many
[29:09] Mysteries you know God using me to write
[29:11] the New Testament he had so many things
[29:13] to stand on to put his credentials to
[29:15] put his badge out there to say he's got
[29:18] the he's got it but you know what that
[29:20] wasn't his Spirit it wasn't his
[29:24] attitude it was just I need more
[29:29] I know there's more for me and we've
[29:32] read the scripture therefore If any man
[29:33] be in Christ he is a new creature old
[29:37] things are passed away and behold all
[29:41] things are become new and all things are
[29:46] of God now that is a complete nature
[29:54] change you know I I've never seen the
[29:57] spirit in in the message as far as the
[30:00] message that brother Brandon preached
[30:03] that he had already
[30:05] attained never seen that never seen that
[30:09] but you know the devil preaches that to
[30:12] us you don't need to do anymore you
[30:16] don't you look at you already got the
[30:18] holy ghost that way we you know we don't
[30:21] we don't talk about we don't battle we
[30:22] don't we don't we don't question it we
[30:24] don't we're not we're not going to sit
[30:26] here and debate who's got we just you
[30:28] know we all got
[30:30] it okay we all got it let's rejoice in
[30:33] that I'm great with that but I am not
[30:35] great with being satisfied with where
[30:37] we're at when God has called us to be
[30:39] just like
[30:40] him there's the
[30:45] difference don't fall after the same
[30:49] example of
[30:51] unbelief there was no doubt that the
[30:53] promised land surely flowed with milk
[30:55] and honey the fruit clusters were so
[30:58] heavy it took two men to carry
[31:01] him we all got that testimony of how
[31:04] great God
[31:06] is but the obstacles that stood in their
[31:09] way from enjoying
[31:11] it was too big for even God to
[31:14] handle that was their
[31:17] testimony Canaanites Philistines
[31:20] Hittites uh hivites genus sites amorites
[31:24] jebusites mobites they're all
[31:27] Giants and they all took different parts
[31:30] of the promis land if you think about
[31:31] our nature in certain areas you know we
[31:33] can just lose it
[31:37] right Giants that get in the way from
[31:39] the love of God just pouring
[31:42] out and they testified that all the
[31:44] people that they saw in it are of great
[31:48] statue sometimes we look at the problems
[31:50] that we have in our life and they're of
[31:52] great statue we've had them since we
[31:55] were a kid
[31:59] and to think that we can get to a place
[32:02] that we could think like the children of
[32:05] Israel yeah I know God saved me I know
[32:08] that I don't doubt that I don't question
[32:09] that but I don't think he can change my
[32:11] nature to be just like him that's
[32:14] exactly what the children of Israel were
[32:18] saying we were in our own sight as
[32:22] Grasshoppers and so we were in their
[32:24] sight don't fall after the same
[32:28] example of unbelief don't wander around
[32:32] thinking that things in your life are
[32:34] are too big for God to
[32:37] handle that our bad habits got a
[32:39] stronghold in our life and nothing can
[32:41] change that you'll be thinking that
[32:43] things are going to be so so permanent
[32:48] your life that they're never your nature
[32:49] is never going to change don't think
[32:51] like that because that is falling after
[32:53] the same example of unbelief
[32:58] don't ever be thinking you're always
[33:00] going to have these
[33:04] habits smoking swearing drinking
[33:07] pornography being judgmental or critical
[33:10] or finding faults with others getting
[33:13] upset short-tempered easily bothered
[33:15] getting angry yelling blowing your top
[33:18] being selfish wanting life to be about
[33:21] you being lazy uncaring Unfaithful
[33:24] murmuring complaining about things
[33:28] I put in there the preacher the
[33:33] preaching I mean these things can seem
[33:36] like well they just kind of everybody
[33:37] has them and you know everybody's
[33:39] GNA it's like as long as you maintain
[33:42] that attitude you're not focusing on the
[33:44] nature change it'd be better off to say
[33:47] Lord I know these things exist they've
[33:49] been here a while they seem to be Giants
[33:51] because I've asked you to take him many
[33:53] times you have got to have faith that
[33:55] you're going to become just like him
[33:57] amen
[33:58] that's just what the word
[34:01] says don't be thinking that you're
[34:03] always going to be the same always stuck
[34:05] with these Giants in my
[34:07] nature nobody okay nobody wants to deal
[34:11] with with their the their problems their
[34:15] habits nobody wants to deal with their
[34:17] bad nature we just ass soon brush it off
[34:21] throw it under the rug you know try to
[34:23] put on our best behavior and and and
[34:27] forget about it but it's still
[34:29] there don't allow yourself to think an
[34:34] evil report about not building God's
[34:37] nature in
[34:38] yourself that's what we're here for
[34:40] that's why we come to church that's why
[34:42] we pray that's why we read the Bible
[34:44] that's why we listen to the tapes
[34:45] because we want to be more like Jesus
[34:48] amen don't allow an evil heart of
[34:51] unbelief in departing from the Living
[34:56] God thought you know
[34:58] when we first met God it was real to us
[35:02] he was alive he was living we know
[35:05] because we just felt clean and we felt
[35:08] Victory and we felt free and we felt
[35:11] that God loved
[35:12] us and we again in this Wilderness
[35:15] experience and we get distant from
[35:18] God and we start you know we continue to
[35:21] go to church we continue to do certain
[35:24] things but it's not as real and we start
[35:27] serving a dead
[35:29] letter I believe this I'm in the message
[35:34] a dead
[35:37] letter God doesn't want us to serve a
[35:40] dead
[35:41] letter it God wants it to be alive
[35:44] inside of us
[35:48] real Hebrews 3:14 says for we are made
[35:51] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[35:55] beginning of our confidence
[35:58] steadfast to the end
[36:01] am in other words God's got to continue
[36:04] to be alive in her
[36:05] life what was the beginning confidence
[36:08] that the children of Israel had their
[36:10] beginning confidence was that I'm taking
[36:13] you out of Egypt because I have promised
[36:15] you a
[36:16] land that was their that was their
[36:19] beginning confidence obviously to the
[36:21] Wilderness experience they lost that
[36:25] confidence and they began to give up and
[36:28] they even add an attitude you know what
[36:30] we'll serve God on this side didn't that
[36:32] they say that we don't need to go over
[36:35] we'll just we'll serve God over here
[36:36] we'll build our we we'll build here this
[36:38] will be our land but that wasn't the
[36:40] land that God promised
[36:41] them a lot of Believers get like that
[36:45] what was our beginning
[36:50] confidence yes we were told that God
[36:53] will give us the Holy Ghost that's what
[36:54] the Bible says repent be baptized every
[36:56] one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[36:57] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[36:58] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[37:00] the Holy Ghost but we didn't quite know
[37:02] what that meant we didn't quite know
[37:05] what that
[37:07] meant and we come to church and we read
[37:10] more and then we see you know after we
[37:11] get the Holy Ghost we get power Jesus
[37:13] said you shall receive power after the
[37:15] Holy Ghost comes upon you power over
[37:18] what over not just casting Devils out of
[37:21] somebody else but casting the Devils out
[37:23] of yourself
[37:28] Romans 8:29 says for whom he did Forno
[37:31] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[37:34] to the image of his son that he might be
[37:39] the firstborn among many of
[37:42] us amen we're going to be just like him
[37:46] I can't do that by my works I got to
[37:48] cease from my works I know what my Works
[37:50] do they get me in
[37:54] trouble 1 John 3:2 beloved now are are
[37:57] we the sons of God and it so we're yes
[38:00] we're a child of God we're saved and it
[38:03] but it does not yet appear what we shall
[38:06] be but we know by Revelation right
[38:10] there's something inside that's been
[38:11] spoken to us from the word that when he
[38:15] shall appear we shall be like him for we
[38:19] shall see him as he is and I love this
[38:22] third
[38:23] verse every man that has this hope hope
[38:27] in him purifies himself even as he's
[38:32] pure so he's working he's saying yes to
[38:35] the process God I I mean I'm thankful
[38:39] for every dose of holy ghost that he's
[38:41] given me and I could never deny any of
[38:43] it I would never want anybody to deny
[38:46] anything that God has given them but I
[38:48] do know this that there is more for
[38:52] me and we need more preaching there's
[38:56] more for us because this this age and
[38:59] every every movie we see every show we
[39:03] see every commercial every everywhere we
[39:06] go there's nothing being presented to us
[39:08] but hey whatever you want you just
[39:11] whatever have a good
[39:14] one nothing is telling us to press
[39:17] towards there except
[39:20] God
[39:24] only I know if if we could like have a
[39:27] camp meeting here for like three months
[39:29] straight and we have service every night
[39:31] we just have preachers coming in from
[39:32] everywhere I'll tell you we'd be doing
[39:35] good at the end of those three
[39:36] months but you know the the the denial
[39:39] that we'd have to put on our flesh to
[39:40] get here and do
[39:42] that but it is the word that changes us
[39:46] right the Bible says in 2 Corinthians
[39:49] 3:18 but we all with open face beholding
[39:53] in a glass glass the glory of the Lord
[39:56] are changed changed and what are we
[39:58] changed we're changed into the same
[40:02] image from glory to glory even as by the
[40:07] spirit of the Lord don't depend on
[40:10] yourself to get changed don't depend on
[40:13] your ability to take the word that's
[40:15] being preached and say yeah I I I
[40:19] somehow want that to happen no God you
[40:23] just spoke your word and I believe it
[40:26] bring it to pass
[40:28] is by
[40:29] faith God is the one that changes us too
[40:33] much intellectual and not enough just
[40:35] faith and respect for the word of God
[40:37] Amen for we are made partakers of Christ
[40:41] if we hold the beginning confidence
[40:44] steadfast unto the
[40:47] end I think this is what we need to
[40:49] encourage one another with we're going
[40:50] to make it keep pressing you know the
[40:54] Bible says forsake not the assembling of
[40:56] yourselves together and all the more as
[40:58] you see the day approaching why because
[41:00] evil is on an
[41:02] increase and we need to combat it right
[41:04] you overcome evil with good God has more
[41:08] for
[41:09] us our opening scriptures and they told
[41:12] him and said we came unto the land where
[41:16] thou sent us and surely it floweth with
[41:18] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[41:20] it nevertheless the people be strong
[41:22] that dwell in the land the people be
[41:25] strong the habits that we have are
[41:27] strong the cities are walled I I can't
[41:29] even get it I don't know why I'm doing
[41:31] what I'm doing but very great and
[41:33] moreover he saw we saw that the children
[41:36] of anoch there and the amalekites dwell
[41:38] in the land of the South and the
[41:39] Hittites the jebusites and the amorites
[41:41] dwell in the mountains and the
[41:44] Canaanites dwell by the Sea and the and
[41:46] by the coast of Jordan it just it just
[41:48] kind of seems that there's we as humans
[41:51] got a lot of
[41:54] problems we we we were born in sin the
[41:57] Bible says shapen in
[41:59] iniquity so you know what you you get
[42:01] this Clump you put it on the on the
[42:03] wheel and you start to shape it you and
[42:06] you mold it and all through our life we
[42:08] are are we got a spirit inside of us
[42:11] that says no I'm not going to listen to
[42:12] you Mom I'm not gonna listen to you Dad
[42:15] I don't have to give that back I know I
[42:18] told you that but I'm not doing anyways
[42:19] and our whole life becomes shapen in
[42:22] iniquity knowing what to do but you
[42:24] decide you're not going to do it
[42:27] and they begin to mold Us in such a
[42:29] thing that we feel like we got such a
[42:30] terrible nature sometimes if we really
[42:33] take a look at what the word tells us
[42:35] that we're supposed to
[42:37] be and Caleb stealed the people before
[42:40] Moses and said let us go up at
[42:45] once don't have a meeting about it let's
[42:49] go and possess it for we are well able
[42:54] to overcome it
[42:57] what an
[43:01] attitude now I I I don't mean it wrong
[43:05] but what did those two have that the
[43:07] others didn't they went through the
[43:10] Wilderness saw the same experiences were
[43:13] in the same camp for 40 years hearing
[43:16] all the murmuring complaining every time
[43:17] they went to
[43:20] church what what made them have this
[43:24] mindset look we're we're well able we're
[43:28] well able we're
[43:30] equipped let's go they must have been
[43:34] staring at only one thing the promise of
[43:38] God because everything else said no
[43:44] way we're more than able to overcome the
[43:48] old nature that we have inside of
[43:51] us let us go up at once and possess it
[43:54] for we are well able to overcome it what
[43:57] is it it was the Giants obviously that
[44:01] were standing in the way of the land
[44:05] that God said this is yours and we're
[44:07] like this hey if it's ours
[44:12] God I don't want these guys these guys
[44:15] shouldn't be here on the land that
[44:16] you're giv me this can't be what you're
[44:18] giving me but God promised I'm going to
[44:22] come into
[44:23] you in that day you'll know that I'm in
[44:26] you and you and me there's going to be a
[44:27] meeting place
[44:30] amen but you know what God is not going
[44:33] to gift that to
[44:36] anybody you've got to hate your ugly
[44:39] nature as much as God does and when you
[44:42] hate those things so bad that you're
[44:45] willing to to sacrifice and spend more
[44:48] time with God and seek more of the Holy
[44:50] Ghost and say God I need more of you
[44:53] then God will come on the scene because
[44:55] he promised to do it amen
[45:00] we get to this place where we just come
[45:02] completely satisfied that we're in the
[45:03] message we lost sight of what we're
[45:05] supposed to be just calling oursel the
[45:08] bride and it doesn't matter if we're
[45:09] acting like it or
[45:15] not I say to the bride let us go up at
[45:18] once and possess it for we are well able
[45:21] to take
[45:23] it what is it the giant thing things in
[45:27] our worldly nature that are standing in
[45:29] the way from receiving all that God has
[45:31] promised us look we got a prophecy some
[45:34] time ago and it's just as real as if it
[45:36] was just said because I just believe
[45:38] it's the word of God and he said if God
[45:40] said if you would come together and
[45:44] pray for one
[45:47] another if you would seek my face if you
[45:51] would come under the
[45:53] word he said I will do things that you
[45:56] have not not not seen before not
[45:59] experienced before now why would God say
[46:04] that why don't God just do
[46:07] them because we all want him to do them
[46:09] don't
[46:10] we but God ain't G to just do
[46:13] it until you're willing to humble
[46:17] yourself cry out to him and start doing
[46:21] the easy things that we can be doing
[46:22] pray for one another help one another
[46:24] have a burden for one another act like a
[46:27] body act like it's more about you in
[46:30] your life it's about coming in with a
[46:32] heart to help
[46:34] somebody then God will honor
[46:37] that and I think it's the same way with
[46:40] any that we want to see changed in our
[46:42] life if we want more love I think we can
[46:45] get more love if we want more peace we
[46:47] can get more peace we got to you know
[46:49] the devil's trying to put our mind and
[46:51] everything and and God says keep our
[46:52] mind stayed on him that gives us peace
[46:55] so there's a battle you got to fight
[46:56] that
[46:59] battle we are well able to overcome our
[47:01] old
[47:03] nature I believing the promises of God's
[47:07] word by laboring to enter into that rest
[47:10] as the scripture tells
[47:12] us brother BR said Faith final resting
[47:15] places in the word of God that's right
[47:18] and don't wait to understand it don't
[47:20] wait to even you feel bubbly about it
[47:22] just say I believe it that settles it
[47:25] you know it's it kind of just put the
[47:28] the draw bar down that the devil can't
[47:30] come in and give you entertaining
[47:31] thoughts of
[47:32] Doubt God cannot lie he cannot come
[47:35] short he cannot fall he his word will
[47:38] not return void we can stand on the word
[47:41] of God it's the only thing we
[47:44] have I don't mean it wrong but there's
[47:47] only so much we can do to rely on one
[47:51] another we can't we can't get anybody
[47:54] over brother Bri says nobody can make it
[47:55] on somebody else's shirt tail right we
[47:58] need God and we need to get serious
[48:01] about believing the word of God the word
[48:04] says we can be like him then we can be
[48:06] like him if we're changed from service
[48:08] to service then I want to see a change
[48:10] in me God's word is for ever settled to
[48:13] Heaven it will not return un void Heaven
[48:17] and Earth will pass away but my words
[48:19] shall never pass
[48:22] away we are well able to overcome our
[48:25] old nature we're well able to do all
[48:29] things through Christ which
[48:30] strengtheneth me you got a big hard task
[48:34] in front of you and you know it just
[48:35] looks so big I don't know if you ever
[48:37] had one of those projects that seemed so
[48:40] big the way to do it is just one piece
[48:43] at a
[48:44] time one piece at a time got a big pile
[48:48] of dirt to move one shovel full at a
[48:52] time you got a big nature that I just
[48:55] not happy with anything in my life one
[48:57] thing at a time just start seeking the
[49:00] Lord one thing at a
[49:03] time we are well able to
[49:06] overcome because we have a God that's
[49:09] greater in
[49:11] us the god that's in US is greater than
[49:16] the god that's in our worldly
[49:23] nature you know brother BR preached that
[49:25] message possessing the enemy's
[49:27] Gates and it takes some possession you
[49:30] can't just be thinking about whatever
[49:31] you want and allowing lots of things to
[49:33] float around and expect to be in
[49:38] control but you've got to believe
[49:41] there's it's like you know brother R
[49:42] talking about that white dog and the
[49:43] black
[49:45] dog and and he asked the old Indian he
[49:47] says well who's winning in that fight of
[49:50] of of that Christian fight that you're
[49:51] having and he said whoever I feed the
[49:55] most and so
[49:57] if you're you're you're you're
[49:59] feeding the inside part which brother
[50:03] baham said the Holy Ghost feeds on the
[50:05] word the Holy Ghost In You feeds on the
[50:08] word and if you want it to grow you give
[50:11] it the word and when you get the word
[50:13] faith cometh by hearing the word you get
[50:16] more faith and you begin to grow and if
[50:18] you just are satisfied with being in the
[50:20] wilderness I'm saved I know I got the
[50:23] Holy
[50:25] Ghost and ignoring to become more like
[50:29] Jesus in fact you just make excuses for
[50:31] every time you mess
[50:37] up I am not preaching human
[50:40] Perfection and I'm not saying we can be
[50:43] perfect what I am saying is we can have
[50:46] a perfect
[50:47] attitude there was something that Caleb
[50:51] had that the others
[50:54] didn't had a different Spirit the the
[50:56] Bible tells us don't fall after the same
[51:00] example of unbelief hold your beginning
[51:03] confence just go back go back spend some
[51:06] time going back to when you first got
[51:07] saved what was on your mind what was on
[51:10] your mind is I want to make God
[51:12] happy I I want to please him I I I I
[51:16] want to learn about him I want to
[51:18] discover who God is I want I want to
[51:19] know more about them and it was just
[51:22] real and then as we go through this
[51:24] process of sanctification we come to
[51:26] church we hear this word and says we
[51:28] need to stop doing this and we need to
[51:29] do that and you need to do that and it's
[51:31] like oh I don't want to do
[51:32] that and you fall in the wilderness you
[51:36] fall in the
[51:38] wilderness so we got to hold the
[51:41] beginning
[51:42] confidence not today's confidence the
[51:45] beginning God wants the
[51:46] beginning praise is perfected in babes
[51:50] don't try to make it any better just
[51:52] praise him with all your heart because
[51:54] that's what babes do
[51:58] don't let God's word slip through your
[52:02] fingers like grains of
[52:05] s as Ray Boltz would
[52:09] say don't let the word just h no that's
[52:13] God speaking to you so we need to fear
[52:16] the lord we need to respect the word
[52:18] more we need to believe the word no
[52:21] matter what it says Hebrews 4:1 says let
[52:24] us therefore fear lest a promise being
[52:27] left us of what of entering into his
[52:36] rest Les let us uh being left us of
[52:41] entering into with any of you should
[52:43] seem to come short of it and I like the
[52:45] way that said that any of you seem to
[52:49] come short of it for unto us was the
[52:51] Gospel preached as well as unto them but
[52:54] the word preached did not profit them
[52:56] because was not mixed with faith when
[52:58] they heard the preaching they oh well
[53:01] when's the service going to be over I'm
[53:02] getting you
[53:04] know you know what I mean it's just it's
[53:06] not real and I understand that you know
[53:09] we watch so much TV we see so many
[53:11] things on videos we we have to have so
[53:14] much action going around that if the
[53:16] preaching just isn't you know the way
[53:18] that you know we'd like it you know then
[53:21] it's just hard to get into it and I'm
[53:24] sorry the word should have nothing to do
[53:27] about how it's presented right the word
[53:29] is the word amen either you're in love
[53:33] with the word or you're in love at how
[53:35] it's
[53:36] presented is be
[53:40] honest God did not
[53:43] promise to just give us enough Holy
[53:45] Ghost to justify
[53:48] us unto
[53:51] salvation I believe that every one of us
[53:54] that we that every human being not us
[53:56] every human being that ever repented
[54:01] sincerely um got
[54:04] baptized I believe at that moment they
[54:06] were
[54:08] saved because that's just what the word
[54:11] says if they're sincere they follow the
[54:14] word the God's not going to
[54:17] lie but see here's the
[54:19] thing that's why a lot of people don't
[54:22] get filled with the Holy Ghost right
[54:24] away God gives them a
[54:28] chance to
[54:30] prove how much they're going at the
[54:34] Bible says God gives the Holy Ghost to
[54:36] them that obey him that you said brother
[54:39] bman in the men's meeting God gives the
[54:42] Holy Ghost to them obey him well let's
[54:44] see if that man's going to obey let's
[54:45] see if that woman's going to obey let's
[54:47] give him some time let's see what
[54:49] happens let's give him the word to much
[54:50] is given much is required let's see can
[54:52] he do more can he do more and if he
[54:54] completely has follen the word that the
[54:56] one that God wants to
[54:58] fill and it's that
[55:01] simple you know we we we we've made
[55:04] everything so complicated because we
[55:06] have to defend oursel forget about
[55:09] defending
[55:11] yourself just be like
[55:14] Jesus have that attitude of I want to be
[55:16] more like him no matter how much I am
[55:18] like him I want to be more like him so I
[55:22] I don't care you know this what I love
[55:23] about Paul and serving the lord
[55:26] years was he was our example he said
[55:29] follow me as I follow Christ but yet he
[55:33] never acted like he was
[55:35] there he you could put him next to a new
[55:38] believer like
[55:41] Timothy and you could tell that both
[55:45] would have the same attitude I want to
[55:47] be more like
[55:50] Jesus when it comes to that
[55:53] nature we should all be the same
[55:56] all be the same like it just does not
[55:59] matter how long we've been serving the
[56:00] lord or how holy we are or how high we
[56:04] are or what whatever that that may be we
[56:06] all are the same wanting to be more like
[56:09] Jesus that's what God wants out of
[56:14] us God promised us a land that floweth
[56:17] with milk and honey and lots of
[56:20] fruit and our fruit of the promised land
[56:23] is love joy peace longsuffering
[56:29] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[56:32] Temperance now to me this kind of
[56:34] culminates the nature of
[56:38] God and that's why the Bible calls this
[56:41] the fruit of the
[56:43] spirit and this is the promised land
[56:46] this isn't us saying oh yeah that's what
[56:48] the Holy Ghost
[56:52] is this is what I must become yes this
[56:56] is the nature that must get inside of
[57:00] me and in order for that to happen
[57:03] there's certain giants that are standing
[57:04] in the way you know I'm
[57:06] selfish I'm not gonna I'm just not going
[57:08] to give up my time I'm I'm just not
[57:10] going to pray that much I'm just going
[57:11] to do this and that's it well how how is
[57:14] how is God gonna say yeah I'm so happy
[57:16] with that attitude I'm just going to
[57:18] give you
[57:19] love I'm just going to give you peace
[57:21] about I'm going to give you
[57:23] Joy you're going to be so patient now
[57:30] no we have to take care of the Giants we
[57:32] have a part to
[57:36] play and I just say it has everything to
[57:38] do with your attitude and nothing to do
[57:40] with your
[57:41] ability
[57:42] amen and look at the rest of that verse
[57:45] says against such there is no giant that
[57:51] will be able to stand before thee all
[57:52] the days of thy life
[57:56] you got that I don't care what the you
[57:58] are the Fulfillment of the law when you
[58:00] got the Fulfillment of God in you
[58:03] Galatians 524 and they that are Christ
[58:08] now this is just said right after the
[58:09] fruits of the spirit and they that are
[58:11] Christ they they've crucified the flesh
[58:14] with the affections and the lust and
[58:16] these are pretty big giants don't you
[58:18] think he says if we live in the spirit
[58:21] let us also walk in the spirit let us
[58:23] not be desirous of something for
[58:27] ourself or just provoking one another or
[58:32] just envying one another you understand
[58:34] that
[58:36] is the wrong
[58:39] nature that's the thing that we were
[58:40] born with we weren't taught to do that
[58:42] that just naturally happens by aspect by
[58:45] leaving the Giants there
[58:48] amen so we got to get serious about
[58:50] getting these things out of our
[58:52] life we can't have the nature of God
[58:54] flowing through us when we're Walking In
[58:56] the Flesh in carnality of our
[58:59] mind we all got giant problems with our
[59:02] nature but Caleb had something inside of
[59:07] him he stilled the negative attitude
[59:11] that was around him and we need to steal
[59:13] the negative attitude that's around our
[59:16] mind this this thing that's just
[59:18] negative like I think anything that
[59:20] tells you that you can't be just like
[59:22] Jesus is a negative report it's an evil
[59:24] report you need get that you need to
[59:26] steal that just nope I'm not going to
[59:28] think about that that's that's what
[59:31] Caleb's attitude was he
[59:34] stealed the people that were around him
[59:36] and he said let us go up at once and
[59:39] possess it for we are well able to
[59:42] overcome
[59:43] it turn with me if you would to numbers
[59:46] 14 oh you know this I I just had a
[59:49] really a few notes compared to almost
[59:51] half the notes that I did from Sunday
[59:52] and I can't believe that I'm still not
[59:54] getting through my notes it just doesn't
[59:55] matter
[59:56] how
[59:57] many
[1:00:01] I we're just going to trust the Lord
[1:00:05] numbers 14:19 now this is the very next
[1:00:09] chapter and start with 14 pardon I
[1:00:12] beseech Thee the iniquity of this people
[1:00:15] according unto the greatness of thy
[1:00:18] mercy and as thou has forgiven this
[1:00:21] people from Egypt even until now so
[1:00:25] here's this interceding going in that
[1:00:29] that was pleading out to God that he
[1:00:33] would have mercy upon these people who
[1:00:34] were murmuring complaining being
[1:00:37] disobedient and this is what the Lord
[1:00:39] said in verse 20 he said I have pardoned
[1:00:43] according to Thy word if this was your
[1:00:45] prayer you're interceding for the people
[1:00:47] in the church I will pardon them
[1:00:49] according to Thy word but as truly as I
[1:00:54] live all the Earth
[1:00:56] shall be filled with the glory of the
[1:00:58] Lord because all those men which have
[1:01:01] seen my glory and my Miracles which I
[1:01:04] did in Egypt and in the wilderness and
[1:01:07] have tempted me now these 10 times and
[1:01:11] have not hearkened to my voice I wonder
[1:01:15] how many times we've walked out of
[1:01:17] church and ignored the word of
[1:01:20] God that's a that's that's tempting the
[1:01:24] Lord
[1:01:26] and when we don't hearken to his voice
[1:01:28] when we don't get serious about the word
[1:01:30] he said surely they shall not see the
[1:01:34] promised land which I swear unto their
[1:01:36] fathers neither shall any of them that
[1:01:39] provoked me see it now that's pretty
[1:01:44] strong but
[1:01:47] colon but my servant Caleb because he
[1:01:51] had another spirit with him and
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:57] what was this spirit all about and have
[1:01:59] followed me
[1:02:02] fully he wasn't half in and half
[1:02:06] out him will I bring into the land
[1:02:10] wherein he went and his seed shall
[1:02:13] possess it so this is why I say here we
[1:02:15] are there's millions of people that go
[1:02:17] to church people are in the message lots
[1:02:19] of people only God knows who's who
[1:02:23] there's three types of Believers in
[1:02:24] every Church and I just say it like this
[1:02:27] forget your
[1:02:29] reputation forget forget everything
[1:02:32] except one
[1:02:33] thing seek to be like
[1:02:38] Jesus God will take care of everything
[1:02:41] else because if we don't follow him
[1:02:46] fully there is going to be a group who
[1:02:48] don't go on rapture we know
[1:02:51] that and did you know a big part of that
[1:02:54] group are people who made it through a
[1:02:59] Sanctified
[1:03:02] Wilderness there were 10 virgins five
[1:03:05] were foolish five were
[1:03:07] wise the five that were foolish they
[1:03:10] lived good clean
[1:03:15] lives the only difference so they made
[1:03:18] it through that
[1:03:20] process they didn't murmur they didn't
[1:03:22] complain they accepted it they liveed
[1:03:23] good clean lives but
[1:03:27] there were
[1:03:29] still a nature that was inside that they
[1:03:32] could maybe harness but it was still
[1:03:36] there and they didn't go on to get the
[1:03:38] Holy
[1:03:40] Ghost those are the ones that didn't go
[1:03:43] on
[1:03:44] Rapture they're called foolish virgins
[1:03:48] there is a a foolish people who do not
[1:03:51] take the word
[1:03:52] seriously and look we're all we got here
[1:03:57] we we need to encourage one another to
[1:04:01] get serious about the word that's it get
[1:04:04] serious about the world get serious
[1:04:06] about getting to be more like Jesus it
[1:04:08] is
[1:04:10] nothing you know becoming like Jesus is
[1:04:13] not something it's not like going to
[1:04:16] some um you know some Seminary or
[1:04:19] seminar I'm sorry and you get you know
[1:04:22] all uh worked up with some great
[1:04:25] swelling
[1:04:28] words positive yeah we need something
[1:04:32] that's
[1:04:33] real and and what God wants to see in US
[1:04:36] is he wants to see us get real with the
[1:04:38] word and so every one of us are in
[1:04:41] different areas God's dealing with us
[1:04:43] God may be dealing with me with
[1:04:45] something that he's not dealing with you
[1:04:47] about and vice versa and we we need to
[1:04:50] get serious about that that's that's
[1:04:52] important to God because it's what he
[1:04:54] wants and he deserves it
[1:04:56] yeah and I'll just say it like this if
[1:04:59] we copy the spirit that Caleb Joshua had
[1:05:03] copy
[1:05:05] it don't provoke the Lord don't grieve
[1:05:08] the
[1:05:08] Lord just follow the word fully whatever
[1:05:13] the word says just start doing it start
[1:05:15] making sacrifices for it when I think
[1:05:17] about you think about the children of
[1:05:18] Israel they're murmuring they're
[1:05:20] complaining you know they had a you know
[1:05:23] 1,800,000 strong you know we're going to
[1:05:25] win the election we're going in the
[1:05:28] promised
[1:05:29] land but you don't know they didn't
[1:05:33] know Jesus was the final answer whether
[1:05:37] they were
[1:05:39] going they got up to it they realized
[1:05:42] what it was said we can't do
[1:05:45] it now I'll say this if for 40 years
[1:05:49] they would have been practicing
[1:05:51] Christianity if they would have been
[1:05:52] practicing believing the word okay there
[1:05:55] there's no water I believe in God he's
[1:05:57] going to take care of it there's no food
[1:05:58] God's going to take care of it I'm not
[1:06:00] going to complain about the manner that
[1:06:01] I'm getting I'm just going to trust God
[1:06:03] if they had faith in their experiences
[1:06:05] in the wilderness when they got there
[1:06:07] they would have been prepared to enter
[1:06:10] into the the nature of
[1:06:12] God do we got we don't we don't we don't
[1:06:16] we
[1:06:19] don't and you get some time if you would
[1:06:21] read John
[1:06:23] 14 I got verses 15-
[1:06:26] 27 but in these verses this is where God
[1:06:29] said that that I'm
[1:06:32] that I'm going to come into you and
[1:06:35] you're going to come into me and we're
[1:06:37] going to be
[1:06:38] one and this is what it means to have
[1:06:40] the nature of God we come into Christ we
[1:06:44] enter into Christ If any man be in
[1:06:46] Christ he's a new creature old things
[1:06:48] are passed away behold all things that
[1:06:50] become new and Christ comes into us and
[1:06:53] he starts to take a greater control
[1:06:56] and this is the realness of entering
[1:06:59] into the holy spirit because that yeah
[1:07:01] that is the promise but it's it's it's
[1:07:03] in this land right God Wants You are the
[1:07:06] Temple of the Holy Ghost God wants to
[1:07:08] have preeminence here he doesn't want to
[1:07:10] be out here only he wants to be inside
[1:07:13] of us
[1:07:14] amen so we are
[1:07:18] able well able to
[1:07:20] overcome well able what does that mean
[1:07:23] able it means we're equipped
[1:07:26] that means we're capable we're
[1:07:29] qualified God has qualified us we're
