[1:12] amen is that your desire amen amen let's
[1:16] take that before the lord as we pray
[1:18] heavenly father lord we've
[1:22] we've spent some time praying before
[1:24] service we've
[1:25] many of us have spent time during the
[1:27] day praying for the service
[1:30] lord we've sung the songs we've
[1:33] expressed our
[1:35] desire and lord just before we enter
[1:38] into this word that you have prepared
[1:41] for us
[1:42] lord we want you to sweep over our soul
[1:45] we want our heart prepared we want that
[1:48] word to fall on a good ground
[1:50] and lord we want to not only be at peace
[1:54] with the word father but we want to be
[1:57] at peace
[1:58] with all the things that you're bringing
[1:59] to us lord the things that you're
[2:01] wanting us to do
[2:03] lord we know that you have a direction
[2:05] for our lives
[2:07] and father we pray that you would bring
[2:09] revelation to all of our hearts
[2:11] you bring a direction to us that we
[2:13] didn't have before we came
[2:15] you'd increase our faith lord
[2:19] give us a a greater faith a greater
[2:21] revelation lord than
[2:23] what we had before we come and lord may
[2:26] you use this service to accomplish your
[2:28] good will in our lives and
[2:30] lord what you purpose for us we commit
[2:34] ourself into your hands lord we yield
[2:36] ourselves to you we give ourselves
[2:39] unreservedly into your hands might you
[2:41] receive glory and honor as we receive
[2:43] your word
[2:44] for we ask these things in jesus
[2:46] christ's name amen
[2:49] amen praise the lord turn with me if you
[2:51] would to the book of
[2:52] saint matthew chapter seven
[2:55] you know i'm so glad that we can have
[2:57] just as great as service without
[3:00] orchestra or stained glass windows
[3:05] or the
[3:10] choir entertainment
[3:13] or the best preacher
[3:17] in the whole world because we have
[3:21] the best god in the whole world with us
[3:24] amen
[3:26] and he has condensated to men of low
[3:29] estate
[3:31] he has not forgotten his bride amen
[3:34] amen matthew chapter 7 verse number 13
[3:37] and 14 we'll have you be seated after we
[3:40] read these
[3:41] entry ye in at the straight gate for
[3:44] white is the gate and broad is the way
[3:46] that leadeth to
[3:49] destruction and many there be
[3:52] which go in there at because straight is
[3:54] the gate narrows the way which leads
[3:55] unto life and few there be that find it
[4:00] amen god bless you may be seated
[4:05] we want of a couple more scriptures we
[4:07] want to read before we
[4:12] uh tell you what the name of the service
[4:15] is
[4:16] is about but here in this opening
[4:18] scripture here
[4:19] jesus is describing two ways
[4:23] and if i could say it like this when you
[4:26] first start out
[4:27] these two ways could look almost exactly
[4:30] the same
[4:32] no not did not jesus say the last days
[4:35] those two spirits would be so close
[4:37] that you couldn't you couldn't hardly
[4:39] tell the the difference
[4:40] unless you were his elect
[4:44] and somehow the truth gets to the elect
[4:48] that's right so when you start out
[4:53] uh in in this this broad way
[4:56] that leads to destruction it's kind of
[4:58] like a y
[5:01] and it just slightly veers
[5:05] and then after a while this road will
[5:08] take you in the
[5:09] opposite direction it'll take an
[5:12] opposite direction
[5:16] and we don't want that because it's the
[5:17] wrong direction we want to entitle this
[5:19] the right direction today
[5:22] and for a subject uh we want to check
[5:24] which direction our thoughts are going
[5:27] because usually our thoughts uh precede
[5:31] the direction that we end up going
[5:34] proverbs chapter 14 verse 12
[5:36] said there is a way which seemeth right
[5:40] until man but the end thereof are the
[5:42] ways of
[5:43] death so if there's a way that seemeth
[5:46] right
[5:47] but it ends up being wrong there must be
[5:50] a way that seemeth wrong to a man but it
[5:53] ends up being
[5:54] the way of life
[5:58] and brother branham could say it like
[6:00] this that way is living for others
[6:03] or or or it's a perfect love without
[6:06] respect to persons
[6:08] and and that just seems um
[6:11] so wrong to the carnal man
[6:15] because you know we've only got so much
[6:17] time we've got to live for ourselves and
[6:19] you know we're going to choose who we're
[6:21] going to love and who we're not going to
[6:22] love
[6:26] either way it doesn't seem
[6:29] like man really thinks it's necessary to
[6:32] live for others
[6:35] because he has a chance every day to do
[6:37] it
[6:39] and he finds choices that he'd rather
[6:43] do what he wants to do first corinthians
[6:46] chapter 2 verse 14
[6:48] says the natural man receiveth not the
[6:50] things of the spirit of god for their
[6:52] foolishness on him neither can he know
[6:54] them because they are spiritually
[6:56] discerned so there is a way that seemeth
[6:59] right unto man
[7:00] but the end there are the ways of death
[7:04] so this is very critical to understand
[7:07] is we're trying to figure out the right
[7:09] directions for our life
[7:12] because there's a part of us that isn't
[7:16] connected to god
[7:20] and it thinks this way is the right way
[7:23] and the part that's connected to god
[7:25] says it's this way
[7:27] well just depending on what you're doing
[7:29] that day is going to determine a lot of
[7:31] the direction that we're going to end up
[7:32] going
[7:33] well jesus said in 4 in chapter 14 of
[7:36] saint john
[7:37] verse 6 i am the way the truth and the
[7:41] life and no man cometh unto the father
[7:43] but by me so we have to go
[7:45] through jesus to make it to eternal life
[7:50] now as we get into this
[7:53] when we're thinking about the right
[7:54] direction
[7:56] there's different ways that we can view
[7:58] this right direction
[8:02] a lot of times we're thinking
[8:06] that we're in the right direction
[8:11] uh uh if it's about something
[8:14] we want to do someplace we want to go
[8:19] something we want to buy
[8:22] and we're looking for the right
[8:24] direction
[8:25] in that
[8:28] but then there is something that we
[8:31] don't think about that we need to be
[8:33] concerned about the right direction and
[8:35] that is the things that god is thinking
[8:36] about
[8:37] us in other words the things that he
[8:40] wants us to do the places he wants us to
[8:42] go
[8:43] the things he wants us to buy or give to
[8:45] others live
[8:46] for others
[8:49] and then there's things that we spend
[8:51] little time thinking about and these are
[8:53] the things
[8:54] that brother josiah talked about last
[8:55] service
[8:57] and that's what we're doing from the
[8:58] original time that he's he's called us
[9:01] to the time we're making the rapture
[9:02] what's going on in this area
[9:05] this character building that there's a
[9:08] right direction for that
[9:10] and of course the the harder way
[9:13] is the right way that's the way that
[9:16] character is built
[9:18] but the way that seemeth right unto man
[9:20] is the easier path
[9:22] that we don't really necessarily need to
[9:24] have to suffer and we're still going to
[9:26] make it in
[9:28] and that's just simply the the attitude
[9:30] and the thought process
[9:33] that the children of israel had when
[9:35] they came out of
[9:37] when they came out of egypt and
[9:40] there is a picture i wanted to show you
[9:41] right now this is a picture on i-75
[9:44] and you probably all have seen the
[9:46] picture
[9:47] and it's a picture of jesus
[9:51] and uh underneath it it says are you
[9:55] on the right road and it was what i
[9:58] liked about it it's a thought-provoking
[10:02] picture that's what we want to do is we
[10:05] want to
[10:07] provoke our thoughts instead of just
[10:12] assuming that we're all on the right
[10:14] road we're all going the right direction
[10:16] it's a good question and i think we
[10:18] would all anonymously like to say
[10:20] yes i am on the right road i am going in
[10:22] the right direction thank you let's go
[10:24] on to the next subject
[10:27] i think that's really part of the the
[10:30] problem
[10:33] we could start off right and very
[10:37] easily take a slight detour
[10:40] thinking that we're still heading in the
[10:42] right direction
[10:44] because there is a way that seemeth
[10:46] right unto man but the end
[10:48] is the wrong direction and every man is
[10:51] right
[10:51] in his own eyes he thinks
[10:55] he's heading in the right direction
[10:57] that's how every one of us think
[10:59] who is going to actually stand up here
[11:01] and say brother john
[11:02] i really don't know if i'm going in the
[11:04] right direction
[11:06] but to be honest with you that should be
[11:09] all of our
[11:10] all of us because brother brown says we
[11:12] come here to find out where we're at
[11:14] with god
[11:16] but too often we feel we have really
[11:19] have things
[11:20] handled now there's another thing to
[11:24] consider in this
[11:25] you could be on the right road but
[11:27] heading in the wrong direction
[11:35] just like taking the oars out of the
[11:37] water
[11:38] i mean end up going the wrong direction
[11:42] of what you were ordered with
[11:47] so some examples of this i wrote down
[11:52] is the saints in the first church age
[11:54] ephesus
[11:57] jesus said that they labored for jesus's
[12:00] namesake
[12:01] and god recognized their works and their
[12:03] patience and that they didn't faint
[12:04] through their trials
[12:07] but he said in revelations chapter 2
[12:09] verse 4 nevertheless
[12:10] i have somewhat against thee because
[12:14] thou has left thy first love
[12:16] they ended up heading in the wrong
[12:18] direction
[12:20] the right direction was their first love
[12:24] then they ended up going in a wrong
[12:27] direction and when you
[12:28] leave off from something that god once
[12:30] had told you to do
[12:33] when you when you leave off that you're
[12:35] heading in the wrong direction
[12:41] now what we should be really be
[12:43] interested in
[12:44] is what is god's true direction for our
[12:48] life what is he interested in
[12:49] it would not matter if i had 15 trusted
[12:52] tools
[12:53] if i had 15 cars if i had 15 houses
[12:56] 15 bolts 15 motorcycles
[13:02] but he is definitely interested in
[13:04] seeing his image inside of me
[13:08] so the direction that we really want to
[13:10] focus on
[13:12] is are we on the right path to
[13:14] developing our character
[13:19] how do we know we're on that right path
[13:22] have we left something out are we just
[13:25] going through the motions
[13:30] verse 5 remember therefore from whence
[13:33] thou art fallen and repent and do thy
[13:35] first works or else i will come
[13:37] unto thee quickly and i will remove thy
[13:39] candlestick out of its place except
[13:41] thou repent now notice this church
[13:44] they were still going to church but they
[13:46] were backslidden
[13:49] still going through the motions still
[13:51] coming
[13:54] but no vision
[13:57] no burden no
[14:01] love constraining them to do anything
[14:03] more than what they were just doing
[14:08] so we can start out right and end up
[14:10] drifting
[14:12] just a little bit remember the children
[14:15] of israel they started out in the right
[14:17] direction but they decided
[14:18] to take the why in the role they wanted
[14:20] the easier path one without persecution
[14:23] with
[14:23] one without suffering they wanted the
[14:25] easier way
[14:27] so they started out right they rejoiced
[14:31] they could always go back and say god
[14:33] delivered me
[14:36] but they had a hard time saying he's the
[14:38] same yesterday today and forever
[14:44] so they wanted a form of godliness
[14:48] i'm still going to serve god i'm just
[14:50] going to do it my way
[14:51] the french sinatra way
[14:55] look at the rich young ruler he started
[14:59] out
[14:59] in the right direction i kept all these
[15:01] from my youth up
[15:04] but he took a y for the money
[15:08] the right direction was to share what
[15:11] god had given them that's what jesus
[15:13] told them to do
[15:14] share it with others and then you come
[15:17] and follow me now that was the right
[15:19] direction
[15:25] jude chapter one verse three now i say
[15:28] chapter one because
[15:29] it is a chapter just because there's no
[15:32] two doesn't mean one's
[15:33] a chapter right i got a revelation on
[15:35] that so i'm sticking right with it
[15:40] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[15:42] you the common salvation
[15:44] it was needful for me to write unto you
[15:46] and to exhort you that you should
[15:48] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[15:49] once
[15:50] delivered unto the saints
[15:54] a lot of believers have gotten off the
[15:56] straight and narrow
[15:58] gotten off the living by faith
[16:04] kind of taking on a natural approach a
[16:07] more
[16:08] intellectual walk with the lord
[16:12] but we must stay the course we must
[16:14] contend
[16:15] for that faith amen we must fight the
[16:18] good fight we must
[16:20] finish this course we must finish this
[16:22] race that's the right direction is to
[16:24] continue on
[16:26] last service we were reminded about the
[16:30] believers
[16:31] standing still on the right road
[16:35] he said what are we doing in this time
[16:38] i mean just because the whole world
[16:40] quarantined or
[16:41] are we quarantined the rapture are we is
[16:44] the bride being quarantined
[16:47] i mean we're still sending out just as
[16:50] much money
[16:51] in missions as we were before
[16:55] we got to find a way to to reach
[16:59] still gotta to win souls you still gotta
[17:01] move on for christ
[17:09] we must remember church that god is
[17:12] persuaded better things of us
[17:16] the things that accompany the bride
[17:20] they're an elite
[17:24] god doesn't choose everybody
[17:28] to be his bride
[17:31] he's choosing a certain group
[17:35] now it's not we should brag about
[17:40] but it's something we should live higher
[17:42] for
[17:44] live live something that's greater
[17:49] hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 for god is not
[17:52] unrighteous to forget your work and
[17:55] labor of love
[17:56] which ye have shown towards his name in
[17:59] that ye minister to the saints and
[18:01] do minister and we desire that every one
[18:04] of you show the same diligence to the
[18:06] full assurance
[18:07] of hope unto the end
[18:12] well you know what i'm in that's all
[18:15] that matters
[18:17] that's not the right direction we were
[18:20] just told
[18:21] to hold that to the very end
[18:27] you know how you were when you first
[18:28] came in you were on fire
[18:31] for god
[18:34] you couldn't wait to share it with
[18:36] somebody even if they didn't want to
[18:38] hear it
[18:41] you learned quickly that you didn't have
[18:43] wisdom but you had joy
[18:46] you had perfect praise honestly
[18:51] so i want to say wherever you are at in
[18:53] your relationship with christ
[18:56] you need to go on to perfection
[19:00] not be comparing where you're at with
[19:01] soul and soul
[19:03] that won't provoke you to good works
[19:06] you need to lay aside the weights that
[19:09] so
[19:09] easily beset you you need to lay aside
[19:13] everything and go get perfect love
[19:17] go get it don't wait if god's not going
[19:20] to hand it to you
[19:22] go after it brother brown said lay
[19:24] everything aside
[19:25] until you get it go after it
[19:28] when opportunities come up and you got
[19:31] garbage going on in your life and
[19:33] somebody's coming at you and it's a real
[19:35] negative situation
[19:36] this is the opportunity to get it
[19:41] there won't be some flowery sermon that
[19:43] you say amen to makes you feel good say
[19:45] oh
[19:45] i've got perfect love now it don't
[19:47] happen like that
[19:51] and you'll see real quick when you have
[19:53] the acid test
[19:54] whether you're headed or not
[19:59] it's easy for man to assume that he's on
[20:02] the right road all the time and heading
[20:04] in the right direction
[20:06] man naturally has a a carnal spirit
[20:09] about him
[20:12] where spiritual things seem foolish
[20:16] unto him
[20:19] in other words he thinks the harder way
[20:24] is not the right direction
[20:27] humility isn't necessary
[20:30] dying out to the will
[20:34] and denying yourself
[20:37] desire
[20:41] the carnal spirit inside of a man is
[20:43] proud
[20:44] it's boastful is arrogant and he's
[20:48] overconfident and he's in need of
[20:50] nothing
[20:52] the natural man receiveth not the things
[20:55] of the spirit of god
[20:57] so how can he know that he's in the
[21:00] right direction
[21:06] we must always recognize the selfish
[21:10] evil nature that's inside of us
[21:15] and kill it daily there needs to be
[21:18] a real real killing
[21:30] now anything that gets killed isn't
[21:33] enjoyable
[21:35] it hurts so if you're hurting
[21:39] if you pray long enough to where you're
[21:41] hurting
[21:43] you're getting somewhere you've got a
[21:45] good chance you're going to end up going
[21:47] in the right direction that day
[21:51] continue to yield yourselves to the holy
[21:54] ghost
[21:55] as lambs as
[21:58] lambs
[22:01] depending totally on the leadership of
[22:03] god
[22:04] not on your ability to make it through
[22:05] the course of the day
[22:08] just because we're children of god does
[22:10] not mean
[22:11] that we're automatically going in the
[22:13] right direction
[22:17] now if we love god first with our lives
[22:21] and we're working according to the
[22:22] eternal purpose which brother branham
[22:24] said mission work is always
[22:26] in the wild lord there was nothing else
[22:27] he says always in the will of the lord
[22:31] then we know that all things are going
[22:33] to work out for our good
[22:35] but if we love god second
[22:38] and we're working according to our
[22:40] purposes
[22:42] our plans you have no scriptural basis
[22:45] for thinking you're going in the right
[22:47] direction or that things are going to
[22:48] work out for your good
[22:50] even if you're a child of god
[22:55] romans chapter 8 verse 14 for as many
[22:58] as are led by the spirit of god
[23:01] they are the sons of god
[23:05] that's a really good scripture
[23:10] but when we're currently walking in our
[23:11] flesh we're not automatically going to
[23:14] catch god's leadership
[23:16] he can still be leading but we're so
[23:19] much in our flesh
[23:22] that we're going to think all the harder
[23:24] way forget it
[23:26] pray more no way wash somebody's feet
[23:30] not right now
[23:33] all because we're in the flesh
[23:38] but still claiming we're a son or
[23:40] daughter of god
[23:44] romans 8 verse 7 because the carnal
[23:48] mind is enmity it's against god
[23:53] for it is not subject to the law of god
[23:55] neither indeed
[23:56] can be so our carnal flesh
[24:02] our carnal mind isn't going to see god's
[24:04] leadership
[24:05] it's going to think i don't think so
[24:12] so then they that are in the flesh they
[24:15] cannot please god
[24:17] remember how the the lord spoke to us
[24:19] last service and told us
[24:21] that we could actually grieve the holy
[24:23] spirit
[24:25] and hold bitterness and express wrath
[24:28] and anger
[24:29] clamor and evil speaking with malice
[24:34] that certainly wouldn't be going the
[24:36] right direction
[24:37] if we're doing that so it's not about
[24:40] we're son of god we're led by the spirit
[24:42] of god
[24:43] and i'm claiming it
[24:46] right that's crazy
[24:56] i wonder are we going the right
[24:57] direction every day
[25:02] i don't need to be praying the wrong
[25:04] direction
[25:06] but i want to really provoke you wanting
[25:08] to
[25:09] know about it instead of just doing what
[25:11] the devil wants
[25:14] is for you to assume
[25:17] galatians chapter 5 verse 13
[25:20] for brethren we have been called unto
[25:23] liberty
[25:24] only use not liberty for yourself
[25:30] but by love serve one another god's
[25:32] given you liberty
[25:33] to go serve somebody
[25:37] it's not for yourself to do what you
[25:39] want to do
[25:40] we were perverting what god has given us
[25:45] same thing satan did for all the laws
[25:49] fulfilled in one word even this that
[25:51] thou
[25:51] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself how
[25:54] many really
[25:55] cares about somebody like they care
[25:57] about themselves
[25:59] find a person like that i'm telling you
[26:01] they stick out like a sore thumb
[26:04] but that's the right direction
[26:08] but if you bite and devour
[26:12] one another take heed that you be not
[26:14] consumed one of another
[26:17] this i say then walk in the spirit
[26:21] this is the right direction walking
[26:24] in the spirit is the right direction
[26:27] and you should not fulfill the lust of
[26:29] the flesh you want to know if you're
[26:31] going in the right direction are you in
[26:33] the spirit
[26:34] well i just don't got time today
[26:43] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[26:46] the spirit against the flesh so they are
[26:48] contrary one to another soul
[26:49] that ye cannot do the things that you
[26:51] would
[26:54] there's a there's a battle going on
[26:57] if you don't feel the battle you're in
[27:00] the wrong direction
[27:04] you've got to be able to feel that flesh
[27:06] trying to pull you off
[27:08] and go off the y a little bit
[27:12] and when you you see that happening
[27:14] you're aware
[27:15] you've got consciousness you've got
[27:17] antennas going
[27:19] you're being able to discern the spirit
[27:21] to try the spirit
[27:26] now it's true that there are times that
[27:28] god will orchestrate certain things in
[27:30] your life
[27:31] he will intervene in certain situations
[27:34] and cause certain things to happen
[27:36] even if you're absolutely been out of
[27:38] his will going in the wrong direction
[27:41] god can do that he's god he can do what
[27:44] he wants to do
[27:45] but by no means do you ever
[27:48] think just because you're god's child
[27:52] and you and that god does those things
[27:54] that you can do what you want to do and
[27:56] it'll be okay
[27:59] i say no way jose it's
[28:03] it's not going to happen
[28:08] now if that's been your your revelation
[28:11] or your mentality
[28:12] i just want to tell you you're heading
[28:15] in the wrong direction
[28:17] you're just right in your own eyes
[28:20] but what is required to know whether
[28:22] you're going in the right direction
[28:23] that's my question to you
[28:30] you're eating up my time i want answers
[28:36] first of all it's not so much knowing
[28:39] which direction is right
[28:41] but which spirit are you being operated
[28:43] by
[28:47] to whom you yield yourself servants to
[28:49] obey his servant you are to whom you
[28:51] obey
[28:52] it's the spirit
[28:55] don't focus on well
[28:58] should i buy this car should i
[29:02] work at this place should i
[29:06] go to this vacation house
[29:13] why are those things so important
[29:19] i guess maybe a better question is why
[29:21] isn't
[29:22] what god wants you to do with your life
[29:27] more important
[29:31] about what you're yielding to every day
[29:36] if you want to know the right direction
[29:38] you've got to know
[29:40] that you've met god's requirements
[29:43] i don't want you to focus on things in
[29:45] places
[29:49] there's no character building in that
[29:53] our emphasis needs to be what is god
[29:55] wanting you to do with your time
[29:58] who is he wanting you to reach out to
[30:06] to die out to something in your flesh
[30:08] that's going on
[30:09] we all got them
[30:13] yeah but brother john so-and-so's got
[30:15] more than anybody
[30:18] so so i mean obviously there's got to be
[30:22] one person in here that's doing more
[30:24] than others
[30:25] and one person is doing the least
[30:26] there's got to be
[30:28] there's got to be because we're not but
[30:32] but because he that's is guilty of one
[30:37] is guilty of all which puts us on the
[30:40] same level
[30:41] so it really doesn't matter who's doing
[30:43] more who's doing worse
[30:47] what matters is are we spending our time
[30:50] really trying to get on the right track
[30:51] trying to get in the right direction are
[30:54] we just satisfied with
[30:55] going to church
[30:58] i'll come when i can when i can i don't
[31:02] i do what i feel like doing i'll try to
[31:04] fit in and
[31:06] where's where where is the dying out
[31:11] where is that suffering for christ we
[31:14] all suffer
[31:15] in the flesh right
[31:18] hey when you wake up and things aren't
[31:20] going your way
[31:23] but when you choose to die out
[31:27] to live your life for somebody else
[31:30] because you have
[31:31] in your heart and mind their soul is
[31:34] best interest
[31:38] that's the right direction
[31:41] well i'm gonna wait till i get all
[31:43] caught up with all my honey-do lists
[31:46] well mine it just keeps going
[31:51] thinking i there wasn't that much on
[31:52] there when i looked at it last
[32:03] we've got to separate number one
[32:06] from our ideas so that's why it's
[32:10] important
[32:12] the more that you want something
[32:17] it's harder because that thing is
[32:20] standing in the way you're
[32:22] well god promised give me the desire of
[32:23] my heart and whatever i asked for you
[32:25] have not because you asked not and
[32:26] you're just
[32:27] you're you're drilling for what you're
[32:29] wanting
[32:31] why don't we drill for what god wants
[32:33] for us
[32:34] what about that well god wants me to
[32:36] have that be happy
[32:40] okay okay done with the subject let's go
[32:43] on now
[32:44] to perfection not to what you want
[32:48] to perfection to what god wants
[32:52] we don't i want i want i
[32:55] i want my children to have everything
[32:57] that they want
[32:58] it's just a natural feeling i think god
[33:00] wants us to be happy and have everything
[33:02] we want
[33:04] but that ain't all i want for my
[33:05] children i'll tell you that
[33:08] they're gonna go right to destruction if
[33:10] that's all they you know
[33:11] i want them to have something that'll
[33:13] that'll hold them
[33:16] that'll develop character that can
[33:19] function that can
[33:20] represent god that's what i want
[33:25] never free more agency they're not all
[33:26] excited about that
[33:28] think about the same thing for you and
[33:30] god because you're claiming
[33:33] him you're claiming to go in the right
[33:36] direction
[33:40] is it possible he's really wanting us to
[33:43] go in the different direction that we're
[33:44] going right now
[33:45] what are you saying brother john what
[33:47] are you really saying
[33:49] i'm saying exactly what i'm saying
[33:54] now he said a little eleven
[33:58] leaveneth the whole lump
[34:03] so maybe a little bit this direction we
[34:04] want to go is not the direction
[34:07] he's wanting
[34:10] and only you and god can decide this
[34:15] not nobody else because god may be
[34:18] dealing with husband and wife
[34:19] differently in different levels and
[34:20] different things
[34:24] because there's a whole lot of things in
[34:26] my life that he's working on
[34:29] i don't know i can keep it straight you
[34:31] know when you go in and see the doctor
[34:33] and i've got certain doctors
[34:36] i mean charts just
[34:40] you know going through my charts i'm
[34:41] thinking come on what is that a repeat
[34:48] god's probably got a lot of things he's
[34:49] dealing with us with
[34:52] i be i'm interested in knowing
[34:55] what those things are and he's
[34:59] interested in knowing
[35:00] us knowing what those things are but
[35:03] we've got to separate
[35:05] from our ideas number one naaman had to
[35:08] separate
[35:10] from his ideas in order to obey the word
[35:13] of god
[35:15] because he thought it was going to be
[35:17] just like this
[35:20] and if he would have stayed with that he
[35:22] would have went the wrong direction
[35:24] but god's grace came and he headed in
[35:28] the right direction after that and he
[35:30] got the right results
[35:31] abraham had to separate from his family
[35:34] in order for god to lead him to the
[35:36] promised land
[35:38] now watch this god was leading abraham
[35:41] in the right direction and abraham
[35:43] didn't even know where he was going
[35:50] see it's it's not about knowing what the
[35:52] right direction is
[35:53] it's about the spirit
[35:57] having the right spirit
[36:00] having the spirit leading you
[36:03] not to get what you want
[36:09] to give god what he wants now it's a
[36:12] perfect type of god leading his church
[36:14] we don't always know where he's leading
[36:17] but we know
[36:18] that the spirit is leading us in the
[36:20] right direction
[36:22] so we have to separate from our own
[36:24] ideas
[36:25] that's the first thing i want to say and
[36:27] this is why it makes it so hard
[36:28] when you have a big i want about
[36:32] something
[36:33] and you're wanting to to know the right
[36:35] direction for that
[36:39] i say focus on the other things first
[36:43] the i want can get in your way brother
[36:46] branham taurus
[36:47] you got to stay neutral about things
[36:52] so if you stay neutral with certain
[36:54] things it's it's going to be
[36:56] easier to to achieve it that's all i'm
[36:58] going to say but
[37:00] praise god that he has a perfect will
[37:03] for us and everything
[37:05] remember when brother branham was being
[37:06] led to aunt jemima
[37:11] brother brandon had to leave his own
[37:13] ideas
[37:15] his ideas i had to get to the post
[37:17] office i got to get that
[37:19] mailed and then i got to get to the
[37:22] airport because the plane's taken off
[37:23] now those were his ideas
[37:26] and he had to forsake them in order to
[37:29] go the right direction
[37:31] and he didn't even know where he's going
[37:33] keep walking keep walking
[37:35] keep walking
[37:40] that's how god leads he doesn't tell us
[37:43] this is what you're going to do this is
[37:44] what you want and this is how it's going
[37:46] to happen
[37:48] he don't owe me any explanation what he
[37:51] what he needs from me is just obedience
[37:54] and
[37:54] a tenderness to know that's him leading
[37:56] me
[37:57] but if i'm so much in the flesh how am i
[38:00] going to catch
[38:01] the right direction
[38:09] remember the time that brother branham
[38:13] his own ideas was to go to israel
[38:17] and to show that sign to the people
[38:19] because they would believe it
[38:21] and how frustrated it must have been
[38:23] from brother mike here in america
[38:25] and people just rejected it so much
[38:29] so this he had his ideas this is what
[38:32] but it wasn't the direction
[38:34] the right direction for him
[38:37] as a prophet and why didn't god show him
[38:40] that right away because
[38:41] god is not obligated to show us
[38:44] everything all the time when we want to
[38:45] know it what's important
[38:47] is that we learn to be neutral
[38:53] forsake our desires because it was his
[38:56] desire to go
[38:59] it was brother ben's desire to go and i
[39:01] think it makes it harder to see
[39:04] when your desire is for something
[39:08] i hope your questions
[39:11] there were times that brother branham
[39:14] wanted to tell ministers certain things
[39:17] that they were just brother random's
[39:19] thoughts remember god said you're
[39:21] telling them too much
[39:25] you're taught you're telling the
[39:26] ministers too much you shouldn't be
[39:27] doing that
[39:28] this is between me and you
[39:33] there were times brother branham wanted
[39:35] to go to certain places
[39:40] but they were just brother rams thoughts
[39:41] he had to forsake him
[39:44] at the beginning when god told him to go
[39:46] to a certain church
[39:47] and preach to those people brother
[39:50] branham
[39:51] his thoughts were not to go look what
[39:54] happened he went the wrong direction
[39:56] you know the story but there's a lot to
[39:59] this other than
[40:00] well you know what i would love to be
[40:03] able to go ahead and get me a nice
[40:04] cadillac
[40:06] it's not about things you want this is a
[40:09] this is this is your relationship with
[40:12] god
[40:14] is it one for his kingdom
[40:18] or is it one for your kingdom
[40:23] you using god for your kingdom for your
[40:26] wants
[40:27] for your direction
[40:32] for your interest the right direction
[40:37] don't automatically take place because
[40:40] we're children of god this is a real
[40:43] important fact
[40:47] there are precise choices that you have
[40:50] to make
[40:51] remember what god told brother branham
[40:54] i'm reading from the true easter seal
[40:57] about the prophecies is because thou has
[40:59] chosen the narrow path the harder way
[41:03] thou has walked of thine own choosing
[41:07] brother branham didn't choose
[41:10] what seemed right to him
[41:16] now of course god had to teach him some
[41:18] things along the way
[41:22] but he eventually chose the harder way
[41:27] it was a narrow path it was a harder way
[41:30] and he walked it of his own choosing so
[41:33] the
[41:34] the right direction has
[41:37] has to happen in your choice
[41:40] in your choosing it can't be god just
[41:45] you know blindfold you and you know
[41:49] no you are going to be presented with
[41:51] the harder way
[41:52] to live for others to spend time on your
[41:55] knees praying
[41:56] to get serious about what's happening in
[41:58] this hour
[42:01] and you can choose to get caught up in
[42:02] the things of the world
[42:05] and all the distractions as brother ron
[42:07] was saying
[42:08] anything to consume us that's what the
[42:12] devil is presenting to us
[42:16] the word has to become vital to you
[42:20] it has to become important to you don't
[42:22] wait for the lights to flash here we got
[42:24] 18 ministers
[42:25] we're going to have a big rally right
[42:27] here and and you're going to be told
[42:29] what's happening
[42:32] no if it ain't going on in your heart in
[42:34] a prayer closet at your home
[42:35] don't look for it here
[42:39] you're proving where you're at with god
[42:41] in your prayer closet
[42:43] at home this is just where you come to
[42:45] make sure
[42:47] that you don't do what you want to do
[42:49] and have to have god every time you come
[42:51] to church
[42:51] hit you off the high horse yeah right
[42:55] you need we we need to love god beyond
[42:57] that
[42:58] so brother branham he chose the narrow
[43:00] way he chose to walk the heart away
[43:03] he says thou has pro that thou has
[43:06] picked the correct and the precise
[43:11] decision and it is my way
[43:15] wow didn't force him
[43:19] he made it real clear you did have your
[43:21] own choosing
[43:22] you the one that picked it i didn't
[43:25] force it
[43:26] i didn't make you do it just because
[43:28] you're my prophet
[43:30] and to make sure it turned out right i
[43:32] had to control it
[43:35] no frimo agency you chose the right
[43:38] direction
[43:40] you turn the the wrong direction down
[43:44] the easy path brother brandon when he's
[43:47] saying this he said
[43:49] bless god it's my way he said
[43:53] that's what's important
[43:56] you know when you're suffering for
[43:58] somebody i'm telling you
[44:00] that's god's way
[44:04] but when you're suffering because of
[44:06] what you're
[44:07] you've done that's not the same
[44:11] suffering
[44:13] because of this momentous decision
[44:17] a huge portion of heaven awaits thee
[44:19] what a glorious decision that was made
[44:22] this in itself and he says here big
[44:25] prophecies around it this in itself
[44:29] is that which will give and may come to
[44:32] pass the tremendous victory in
[44:35] love divine so here we are brother man
[44:37] says whatever you do get perfect love
[44:43] and we have this beautiful
[44:48] to me real clear instructions here
[44:52] how to get it
[44:56] choose with your own free will
[44:59] to go the harder way
[45:02] and that decision is what will lead you
[45:06] to get perfect love
[45:12] i love it i love the word
[45:17] amen in order to be heading in the right
[45:20] direction
[45:21] we must be sure first of all that we
[45:24] have forfeited
[45:25] our thoughts in other words
[45:28] i i do remember this when i started out
[45:32] i wanted to marry cheryl so bad you
[45:35] remember that honey
[45:39] and i can take you to the field that i
[45:41] cried my eyes out
[45:43] and begged with god and made a plea deal
[45:46] with him
[45:49] as if he was saying well all right i'll
[45:51] do it
[45:57] and that thing just kind of hauled over
[45:59] my head
[46:01] that i made that deal with him
[46:05] and i knew that i could not start my
[46:09] walk
[46:09] off with god with that hanging over me
[46:16] god got me to a place
[46:19] that i did not
[46:24] and was i don't want to say did not want
[46:26] her but i did not want her
[46:28] first
[46:33] i was easily willing to say
[46:37] no if this was what your will was for me
[46:39] lord
[46:41] i forfeited my thought as much as i
[46:44] didn't want to
[46:45] but i did gave that up
[46:50] and then god showed me the right
[46:51] direction
[46:54] but it happens like that every day in
[46:56] our life if we're willing to do that
[47:01] we can learn the will of god on a daily
[47:03] basis for
[47:04] our lives for the things that he wants
[47:07] us to do that day
[47:10] if we forfeit our thoughts what we're
[47:13] going to do
[47:14] how we're going to run the day what our
[47:16] plans are
[47:17] forfeit them say lord i just want your
[47:21] direction for my life i don't want to do
[47:23] this or that i want what you want from
[47:25] me lord
[47:28] romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you
[47:31] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[47:34] that you present yourself
[47:38] yourself your mind your thoughts your
[47:40] life
[47:43] a living sacrifice wow
[47:52] holy and acceptable unto god which is
[47:54] your reasonable service and be not
[47:55] conformed to this world
[47:58] don't just do it because this is the way
[48:00] everybody else is doing in church
[48:04] how do you know the bride well i do
[48:07] because you know they came in before me
[48:10] so
[48:13] we need that personal relationship with
[48:16] christ
[48:17] not that always comparing
[48:20] be not conformed to this world but be
[48:22] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[48:24] that ye may prove what is the right
[48:27] direction
[48:28] the good and acceptable and perfect will
[48:30] of god that is the right direction you
[48:32] got to prove it
[48:33] for i say through the grace given unto
[48:36] me to
[48:36] every one of us sitting here today not
[48:39] to think of himself
[48:41] more highly than he ought to think
[48:45] brother john nothing you can say that's
[48:47] going to distract me i know
[48:49] that i'm going in the right direction
[48:51] and if you say it one more time
[48:52] you're going to offend me
[48:56] that almost sounds like we're thinking
[48:58] more highly than we ought to think
[49:01] but we need to think soberly amen
[49:03] according as god has doubted to every
[49:05] man
[49:06] a measure of revelation we don't know at
[49:09] all we don't know
[49:11] all the direction that god has for us
[49:14] the right direction is to forfeit your
[49:16] thoughts
[49:17] in other words present yourselves
[49:19] soberly
[49:20] as a lamb before the lord lord i don't
[49:24] know what your will is
[49:25] but show me not as someone who's
[49:29] already has things figured out just
[49:31] seems like they always know
[49:34] god's direction all the time
[49:37] god resists the proud who already know
[49:41] and gives grace or gives direction
[49:44] to the humble
[49:48] god gives grace to those who acknowledge
[49:50] and believe that they don't know the
[49:52] right direction yet
[49:55] there's nothing wrong with being humble
[49:58] in fact there's a better chance that god
[50:01] is really directing you
[50:03] now jesus or james taught us in james
[50:06] chapter 4
[50:07] that we really don't know the will of
[50:09] the lord or the right direction
[50:11] that's what he taught us james chapter 4
[50:13] verse 13
[50:15] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[50:17] we'll go into such a city and continue
[50:19] their year
[50:20] and buy and sell and get gained now this
[50:22] sounds like a pretty good plan doesn't
[50:24] it
[50:28] how many times do we hear people say god
[50:30] showed me
[50:38] well
[50:44] this is this is for us whereas you know
[50:47] not what shall be i do too
[50:50] god showed me
[50:57] for what is your life it's even a vapor
[51:00] that appears for a little time
[51:01] and then vanishes away
[51:07] for you ought to say if the lord will
[51:10] we shall live and do this or do that
[51:12] even when brother branham knew he was
[51:14] right he
[51:15] said i could be wrong i'm not saying
[51:18] that god don't show you things i'm not
[51:20] saying that
[51:21] but somehow we can develop that spirit
[51:25] that we're always pushing that agenda
[51:28] instead of pushing the agenda i could be
[51:30] wrong here i'm just trusting the lord
[51:32] and
[51:32] lord show me if i'm off if the lord
[51:36] will we shall live we shall do this or
[51:39] that
[51:41] of course we know it's the will of the
[51:43] lord
[51:44] if we live for others if we spread the
[51:47] gospel if we go e out
[51:50] if we invite somebody to church if we
[51:52] come a little earlier
[51:54] and get our heart prepared we already
[51:56] know that's the will of the lord
[51:58] these are about other things
[52:01] but it's the right direction to say if
[52:05] the lord will but if we're not doing
[52:08] that he says in verse 16 but now
[52:10] you rejoice in your boostings
[52:13] yeah god show me the very rejoicing of
[52:17] it
[52:23] when we arrogantly boast about something
[52:27] we're going to do i'm just going to tell
[52:29] you it's the wrong direction
[52:32] i don't know how many times the lord has
[52:34] showed me something i just tuck it
[52:36] just tuck it
[52:41] it's just the grace that he would show
[52:42] me
[52:45] because he don't owe me anything and i
[52:46] certainly haven't done anything to
[52:48] deserve it
[52:49] in fact it's just the other way around
[52:52] the other way around
[52:54] the right direction has more to do with
[52:56] the humble spirit
[52:57] than it does about what you're doing
[53:01] i'm doing what god told me to do i'm
[53:03] going it has more to do with a humble
[53:05] spirit
[53:07] too many believers today think that the
[53:09] correct doctrine is always the right
[53:12] direction
[53:14] contrary to what the prophet said i'd
[53:16] rather have the right spirit and be
[53:18] wrong in my doctrine than have
[53:21] the right doctrine and be wrong in my
[53:23] spirit so
[53:25] it's more about having the right spirit
[53:28] which we all can have that we all can
[53:31] have that
[53:34] we all can really promote the right
[53:36] direction our life by simply having a
[53:38] right spirit
[53:39] not having to figure out what the right
[53:42] direction is
[53:44] are you with me
[53:48] no the right doctrine and the wrong
[53:50] spirit
[53:52] will always lead people in the wrong
[53:53] direction
[53:55] and the good example of this is the
[53:57] pharisees they were so right in their
[53:59] doctrine
[54:01] that they were so wrong in their spirit
[54:04] their motives were all mixed up they
[54:06] wanted glory for themselves
[54:08] they wanted to prove others were wrong
[54:10] they want to prove they were better they
[54:11] were the only right ones
[54:14] and they had doctrine for it all
[54:18] but they were heading in the wrong
[54:19] direction
[54:22] but the right humble contrite i could be
[54:25] wrong spirit
[54:27] will always lead you out of being wrong
[54:30] in your views to the truth
[54:34] that's why i don't fear being wrong i
[54:38] fear having a wrong spirit
[54:48] look at the prostitutes the tax
[54:49] collectors jesus said they'll enter in
[54:52] faster the bible says the common people
[54:56] heard jesus gladly
[54:58] always remember the right direction has
[55:00] more to do with a humble spirit
[55:02] than it does actually what you're doing
[55:06] proverbs chapter 3 verse 5
[55:09] as we're winding down here proverbs
[55:12] chapter 3 verse 5
[55:13] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[55:16] and lean not to that own understanding
[55:18] so here we've got the
[55:20] first direction you've got to give up
[55:21] your thoughts
[55:24] give them up that's the first thing
[55:27] dump your thoughts lay down your ideas
[55:30] forget about what you've already got
[55:32] figured out
[55:33] just set it aside
[55:37] in all thy ways acknowledge him
[55:41] and he shall direct thy path
[55:45] the reas the recipe for the right
[55:48] direction
[55:49] is to let go of your thinking let go of
[55:51] your understanding
[55:52] and humble yourself to ask god about it
[55:57] and then wait for him to show you
[56:04] if you acknowledge him the promise is he
[56:06] will direct your path
[56:09] if you don't ask him
[56:14] you just go on what you think what you
[56:16] feel what you want
[56:18] what you desire what somebody told you
[56:25] that god gets jealous of that
[56:28] god don't want to share that with
[56:29] anybody he wants to claim that all for
[56:31] himself
[56:33] he wants it to be you and him
[56:38] so when you take the time lord this is
[56:41] the situation
[56:42] strike me trust in that prayer
[56:50] and then you march forward
[56:53] that's you keep maintain and any time
[56:56] you allow your spirit to get haughty
[56:58] boastful arrogant know right away you're
[57:01] in the wrong direction
[57:02] no right away you're in the wrong
[57:04] direction
[57:08] that's why we don't render evil for evil
[57:12] when somebody uses you you just love
[57:15] them and pray for them
[57:18] don't get your flesh in there the right
[57:21] direction is always the harder way but
[57:23] it's the precise decision
[57:24] and it is god's way
[57:30] be not verse 7 be not wise
[57:35] in your own eyes
[57:38] why would that be right afterwards
[57:40] because the tendency is every man is
[57:43] right
[57:43] in his own eyes be not wise in your own
[57:52] eyes
[57:54] be dumb in your own eyes
[57:58] be dumb i don't want people to think i'm
[58:01] dumb
[58:02] that's the problem we're worried about a
[58:06] reputation
[58:09] this is the recipe
[58:13] for the right direction we don't know
[58:15] the right direction
[58:18] so we ask the lord he'll direct our
[58:20] paths do not be wise
[58:22] in your own eyes that just opens the
[58:26] door
[58:27] for pride fear
[58:30] the lord and depart from evil well what
[58:34] is evil
[58:35] lies in your own eyes your thoughts what
[58:37] you think
[58:39] now what if it is
[58:43] the same as the lord's thoughts
[58:51] depart from being wise in your own eyes
[58:57] don't rest on what i know is what god
[59:00] wants
[59:02] the spirit is wrong it's
[59:05] it's more about having the right spirit
[59:08] a humble
[59:09] i could be wrong take the back seat
[59:13] that's the right direction you don't
[59:16] have to prove anything
[59:18] god's going to prove it all
[59:22] it's not so much the right direction
[59:24] that we're looking for but it's the
[59:26] right
[59:26] spirit to direct us i want to try to end
[59:29] with this
[59:31] john chapter 16 verse 12. remember god's
[59:34] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[59:36] that's why we've got to dump ours
[59:41] i'd like to assume everything i think is
[59:43] what god thinks
[59:45] all the music i listen to is the music
[59:47] he likes
[59:49] everybody anybody try telling you a song
[59:51] and say listen this is a good one you
[59:52] listen to and you think you can't wait
[59:53] till it's over
[59:59] but we think the music we listen to is
[1:00:01] the stuff that god likes
[1:00:07] just multiply that to everything in your
[1:00:09] life
[1:00:11] god's thoughts are higher than ours
[1:00:12] we've got to be
[1:00:14] willing to let them go john chapter 16
[1:00:17] verse 12 i have yet many things to say
[1:00:19] unto you
[1:00:20] but you cannot bear them now
[1:00:24] i wonder how many times the holy spirit
[1:00:27] has tried to
[1:00:28] tell you something
[1:00:35] and you said i can't deal with this
[1:00:37] right now
[1:00:41] i i can't bend over that much
[1:00:44] i can't live for somebody that much i
[1:00:46] can't
[1:00:47] pray that i can't go to church i can't
[1:00:51] give that much of my time
[1:00:54] i can't be any more giving than what i'm
[1:00:57] giving
[1:00:59] i wonder how many times the holy spirit
[1:01:02] had something to say to us but we just
[1:01:04] couldn't deal with it
[1:01:08] and yet it's the right direction for us
[1:01:12] but the natural man
[1:01:16] exactly exactly brother ron
[1:01:22] now you don't have to do that but god
[1:01:26] will always bring us back
[1:01:27] to his word he's never changed since the
[1:01:29] day we met him
[1:01:32] he'll never change the quicker we
[1:01:36] change the better things will be amen
[1:01:42] our flesh just wants to to lean to its
[1:01:44] own understanding
[1:01:47] be wise in our own eyes but
[1:01:52] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[1:01:54] come
[1:01:55] when the holy spirit is coming to us to
[1:01:58] guide us in the right direction
[1:02:00] into all truth he shall not speak
[1:02:03] of himself but whosoever he he
[1:02:06] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:02:08] speak
[1:02:09] and he will show you things to come
[1:02:13] see the right direction
[1:02:16] comes from the right spirit
[1:02:20] not the knowledge of what that spirit
[1:02:23] parts to us
[1:02:25] or what we think is the right direction
[1:02:28] it's the right spirit that leads us in
[1:02:30] the right direction
[1:02:32] and the right direction is his will for
[1:02:35] our lives
[1:02:36] not just well i know what this doctrine
[1:02:39] says
[1:02:39] i believe in that doctrine it's not that
[1:02:43] it's the doctrine that he's trying to
[1:02:44] get you to live that you haven't been
[1:02:46] living
[1:02:48] it's you're doing your thing and he
[1:02:50] wants you to start doing more of his
[1:02:52] thing
[1:02:53] that's the direction he's trying that's
[1:02:55] what the personal
[1:02:57] holy ghost is for
[1:03:02] personal he deals with me differently
[1:03:06] than he deals with you
[1:03:14] you may be wanting three cadillacs so
[1:03:16] bad
[1:03:20] you may be wanting three horses so bad
[1:03:25] that's why i didn't say fishing boats
[1:03:31] i know i know but i'm trying to stay
[1:03:33] away from anything that could possibly
[1:03:34] be
[1:03:35] the point that i'm trying to say is
[1:03:37] god's dealing with me
[1:03:38] with my issues we all got issues god's
[1:03:41] deal with you with your issues
[1:03:45] the spirit is trying to lead you through
[1:03:47] those
[1:03:50] we don't want to use god for an earned
[1:03:51] boy
[1:03:54] that means only for the things that we
[1:03:55] would like
[1:03:59] we want to forsake our ideas
[1:04:03] give them up let his spirit
[1:04:06] direct us into something that's harder
[1:04:10] more difficult tomorrow than it was
[1:04:12] today
[1:04:15] that means we're walking more and the
[1:04:16] harder way right
[1:04:19] there's two paths one's easy
[1:04:22] one's hard
[1:04:28] if you want a more
[1:04:32] direct right path for you it's going to
[1:04:35] be harder
[1:04:37] it's not going to be harder for the
[1:04:38] prophet and everybody else but easier
[1:04:40] for you
[1:04:43] so if you're wanting that you can expect
[1:04:45] things are going to be harder you have
[1:04:47] to give up more you have to make more
[1:04:48] sacrifices
[1:04:52] but this is the precise decision
[1:04:55] and that momentous decision
[1:05:00] oh a huge portion of heaven awaits us
[1:05:04] this in itself will bring to pass
[1:05:08] that victory it's a victory love divine
[1:05:13] when you can love no matter what anybody
[1:05:14] does to you that's a victory
[1:05:17] it's not a gift character is not a gift
[1:05:19] it's a victory
[1:05:21] you had to give up something to get it
[1:05:25] you had to overcome your flesh you had
[1:05:27] to kill it you had to crucify it you had
[1:05:29] to say
[1:05:29] not my will lord but thine be done be
[1:05:31] glorified through me
[1:05:32] amen let's stand together
[1:05:37] praise the lord
[1:05:43] god's spirit is leading us in the right
[1:05:46] direction
[1:05:48] how many wants a clearer picture
[1:05:52] of that amen

[1:11:27] for our lives lord
[1:11:31] we don't want to blindly
[1:11:35] just walk
[1:11:39] and think it's the right direction

[1:11:44] those things
[1:11:46] but lord today we're coming to you
[1:11:51] with a a renewed dedication

[1:12:11] with every situation
[1:12:16] and lord i believe
[1:12:19] we believe that you would direct
[1:12:22] your children in the right path
[1:12:27] lord i pray that our faith
[1:12:32] would be strong strong enough to believe
[1:12:38] lord not blindly but with
[1:12:42] a confidence that you have given us
[1:12:46] that we're in your perfect will going in
[1:12:48] the right direction

[1:12:57] humble spirit in every situation

[1:13:09] are off
[1:13:10] when our desires are off but we're still
[1:13:13] trying to claim

[1:15:34] walk in the light
[1:15:37] shining upon me from
[1:15:40] heaven so bright i've made the world and
[1:15:46] its follies are due
[1:15:49] i've started in jesus
[1:15:52] i'm going through yes
[1:15:55] i'm going through yes
[1:15:58] i'm going through and i'll pay the price
[1:16:04] whatever others do
[1:16:07] i'll take the way with the lords just by
[1:16:12] his view
[1:16:13] i'm going through jesus
[1:16:16] i'm going through oh
[1:16:20] there are many who start
[1:16:23] in the race but with the light
[1:16:28] refused to keep pay
[1:16:31] others accept it because
[1:16:35] it is new but not very many
[1:16:40] expect to go through but
[1:16:43] i'm going through yes
[1:16:46] i'm going through and i'll pay the pride
[1:16:52] whatever others do
[1:16:55] i'll take the way with the lord's
[1:16:59] despised views
[1:17:00] i'm going to jesus
[1:17:04] i'm going through i'd rather
[1:17:08] walk with jesus alone
[1:17:12] and have for a pillow like jake up
[1:17:17] a stone live in each moment with his
[1:17:22] face in view then shrink from my pathway
[1:17:27] and fail to go through
[1:17:39] others do i'll take the ray
[1:17:43] with the lord just by spear
[1:17:47] i'm going through jesus
[1:17:50] i'm going through
[1:17:55] amen sounds like you're determined amen
[1:17:58] amen how many will
[1:18:02] work with me because i'm going to do
[1:18:04] this too
[1:18:07] put into practice what we heard tonight
[1:18:11] this this week take the time to pray
[1:18:17] lord i don't know i don't want to assume
[1:18:20] i really need you to direct my life i
[1:18:22] don't want to assume it's almost
[1:18:24] a wrong thing i think to assume that
[1:18:26] god's always leading us
[1:18:28] there's just too many examples in the
[1:18:30] bible that it wasn't soul
[1:18:33] but that humble and controy spirit he'll
[1:18:34] not despise that you have that you
[1:18:37] you are being led because
[1:18:41] you want it more than anything when you
[1:18:43] want it more than anything
[1:18:44] you will be being led but it's when
[1:18:47] those other
[1:18:47] desires slip in there
[1:18:51] that can can can confuse us
[1:18:54] so but if we practice this i just
[1:18:58] believe god will
[1:18:58] prosper us and and bless our lives
[1:19:01] because we're actively trying to put him
[1:19:03] in our lives we're inviting him in
[1:19:07] say that brother what were you going to
[1:19:09] say amen
[1:19:12] amen that's right his word
[1:19:15] is forever settled in heaven
[1:19:18] amen well i just want to say amen to
[1:19:21] what brother
[1:19:22] all ron said for our sister trisha we
[1:19:26] are depending on her and
[1:19:30] it's it's she's used to not leading
[1:19:33] so and then when cheryl's not here has
[1:19:35] to lead it's a totally different role
[1:19:37] you wouldn't think it
[1:19:38] you know but yeah all of a sudden you
[1:19:40] got to be johnny on the spot in the
[1:19:41] first note
[1:19:43] where before cheryl kind of has to do
[1:19:46] that so
[1:19:48] we're thankful for our sister and then
[1:19:52] we could please pray for sister cheryl
[1:19:56] i think things are going better in the
[1:19:59] directions of her lungs
[1:20:00] but honestly her she
[1:20:04] is doing worse her her nights
[1:20:07] her pain her can't walk it's just it's
[1:20:10] terrible but
[1:20:11] there is a little loosening that's going
[1:20:13] up she said today just before i left
[1:20:15] so that's a good sign that's a good sign
[1:20:18] but let's pray that she doesn't
[1:20:20] she gets better somewhat real quick so
[1:20:22] she don't have to go in there and get
[1:20:24] an x-ray because
[1:20:27] it's all possible to stay out of the
[1:20:29] hospital
[1:20:30] good to see brother tyler amen
[1:20:34] brother do you feel comfortable enough
[1:20:36] to to close us in prayer
[1:20:40] okay god bless you
[1:20:47] thank you lord
[1:20:58] amen
