service on Wednesday of next week or Tuesday we're we're canceling that service just so for preparations So today we're having our Thanksgiving service and I I wore my Thanksgiving tie to show my participation in this meal I don't know if you know but when the first Thanksgiving happened it was about four women that took care of it today oh I mean it was all women that did it today it's it's it's either 40 or 60% of of the men uh do the help with the Thanksgiving meals Google has a lot of information there right at our fingertips amen let's let's just bow our heart in a word of prayer before we approach the scripture Heavenly Father we want to thank you for your presence today we want to thank you for the joy that you've placed in our heart Lord a love for you only you could do that thank you for loving us first that we could love you back today Lord We've Come To Worship You praise you to express our our Thanksgiving to you oh also Lord to to glean from your word how we could just be better a better wife how we can better please you Lord May Thy word encourage us today to do that may we not be hurt and offended by it maybe not be bothered but maybe we be lifted up because it's your word lord it's not the word of men but is the word of our creator the one that created our bodies Lord we love you and we commit this service we ask that you'd meet every need that would be amongst us Lord we're so thankful for all the good things that you've done and given us strength just to be here today we commit it all to you now and give you praise and advance in Jesus name we pray amen amen Luke chapter 17 starting with verse number 11 and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaran G Galilee and as he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 that uh 10 men that were lepers which stood AAR off they lifted up their voices and Je and said Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priest and it came to pass that as he went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw he was healed turned back with a loud voice glorified God fell down on his face at his feet giving thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus answering said were there not 10 cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that return to give glory to God Save The Stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith have made thee whole and God bless you you may be seated well most of us know that the English settlers known as pilgrim arrived in America in the Mayflower in 1620 and it was in the Autumn of 1621 that they had their first Thanksgiving and a lot of things have changed since the first Thanksgiving which was over 400 years ago the first Thanksgiving meal was likely including duck venison Seafood along with cabbage onions corn and squash there was no turkey there was no stuffing as we know it today no mashed potatoes no cranberry sauce or many fine desserts the first Thanksgiving perhaps had pumpkins on the table but they certainly didn't have any pumpkin pie they did during Thanksgiving play ball games and sang and danced today we sit down and watch football games with fans shouting and dancing so it's a little bit different there was about 90 Native Americans and about 50 pilgrims there that came together for the first Thanksgiving and both of their purposes of coming together was to show their Thanksgiving and to give gratitude for what God had given them in the Harvest amen that's right that was their purpose of gathering together and so you've got pilgrims you got these Indians and they're like different just different cultures all together that they both have to eat right and they're coming together to give an expression of Thanksgiving for what God had did through the Harvest because you know they had to till the ground they they did all this stuff but yet they couldn't give the increase the increase came from God amen and and and they had just this this great gratitude that had been in their hearts and and there was no no Black Friday shopping to look forward to In fact when they celebrated Thanksgiving they actually expressed gratitude for a week they had Thanksgiving for a week they that that's what they did the next day that's they didn't look forward to shopping and getting deals to people today people people have lost their gratitude and they've lost a love to express it Paul warned the church would be in perilous condition right before the Rapture would take place that churchgoing people would be lovers of their own self Covetous bolsters and unthankful instead of coming together to give thanks and express attitude they they came to church with a proud Spirit right amen the proud would be in such an unthankful condition that many of them would walk away from the faith maybe they they wouldn't stop going to church but they would walk away from the original Faith they had when they got saved we know the world has fallen in love with themselves so much that their lives is only their life is the only life that matters that's right because iniquity in their own life is abound many love with wax cold Jesus said and that Spirit has literally crept into our homes and when it creeps into our homes it creeps into our church so I asked I want to entitle this message today where did the Thanksgiving go where did the Thanksgiving go and when I pondered this question I thought about these 10 lepers lepers they had a bad rap according to Leviticus 13: 45 the law of Moses lepers had to easily identify they were easily identified by others because they had this contagious condition and their clothes had to be torn they had they had to let others know they had this disease so they didn't come by them and get this uh any any any any part of this disease was uh part of it could have been contagious so they had to make sure nobody came by them and so they had to go out with a completely it was a humiliating uh uh behavior and and spirit that they had to walk around instead of being proud look at me I got a touchdown they had to walk around say stay away from me because I am gross I've got leprosy amen their clothes were torn their hair was left untidy and the upper part of their lip had to be covered and when they saw someone approaching them they had to yell out unclean unclean in other words I'm warning you stay away from me amen and it came to pass as Jesus went into Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaran Galilee back at Luke 17 verse 12 and and as he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were lepers and as the law they stood a far off yes and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy upon us amen not only unclean unclean but they they called Jesus master and they pleaded for help you know there probably was no other physician that could help them with Leprosy and when we realize there is only one person in this world that can help us we ought to be looking to him the author and the finisher of our faith not looking to one another not depending upon one another I think it's good to say come pray with me but it's good that we look to God he's our Master amen verse 14 and when he saw them he said un to them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed now this is this verse 14 in in itself is profound to me because when we come to Jesus and we got this need in our life and we really want Jesus to help us we're looking for some sort of structure in what he's telling us to make sense remember non wanted to be clean and it didn't make sense to him because he was asked to go into the dirty Waters of Jordan amen and so we're looking okay come over here I'm going to lay hands on you I'm going to pray for you this is what we're going to do there was none of that and we shouldn't be ever expecting that for the needs in our lives I'm telling you what God is looking for is obedience to his word amen he's going to give you a word and I don't know what it's going to be but whatever he says just do it because that is what brings the results amen he just said go show yourself on the priest that's all he said he didn't even say you're healed he didn't say it's going to happen he just said go show yourselves to the priest and it came to pass as they went in obedience they were cleansed and one of them just one of them when he saw that he was healed he turned back with a loud voice and glorified God he didn't whisper it he didn't come back to say hey bu thank you have a good one thank you for what you did man no he didn't care what he looked like amen he didn't even care if the other nine came with him when he went to church right he was going with a purpose amen he had a loud voice and that loud voice wasn't Go Lions go Chiefs it was I want to glorify the one who just healed me that's right and he fell down on his face at the feet of Jesus giving him thanks and it was important for God to know that he wasn't a Jew he wasn't a what we would call a chosen uh his chosen people it was a Samaritan telling me that God will recognize me if I give him thanks and Jesus answered answering said where there not 10 but where are the nine this the subject here is he's he's getting praise he's getting honor and and Jesus is not saying well I'm glad you came to be the example for everybody else at church there was nothing like that his mind was on the praise that was being due to him that he wasn't receiving his atttention was I'm only getting one tenth of the praise I should be getting in this service he asked the question where the nine we could say Jesus was asking where did the Thanksgiving goal amen there are not found that return to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith have made thee whole you know there's a blessing that only comes from those who fully give God glory yes I believe that now if Jesus who's no respector persons would ask the question where are the nine that were not making enough effort to bring God the glory that was due to him then I believe Jesus who is the same yesterday today and forever would be asking the same thing to to any person who comes into church who God blesses them in some fashion formal way and they don't make the effort to give the glory that's due to his name and I don't want God in this church looking at me saying where are you supposed to be worshiping me amen in other words if I don't if we don't worship God because we don't feel like it you're robbing God of his glory amen because he's due your worship amen because you're special not what I'm saying he's worthy of the praise of a hypocrite I think we'd have to be pretty low not to worship God I know that's a hard one but look the very fact that you woke up with breath today ought to give you something inside of you to say thank you Jesus we get we're just like the world you know we wake up taken for granted the things that God has given us so I'll say to you where did the Thanksgiving go I know you're not getting what you want you got treated bad and this is happening and that's happening but I'll tell you just look to what God has done for you amen how's that song Go count your blessings name them one by one right amen the very fact that you would be truly a grateful person makes you an oddball it makes you an oddball especially to The Ungrateful they look at you weird a person that would actually rejoice when they're going through a fiery trial which seems strange can you say Amen that they could be so forced so focused I should say God in the middle of their trial that they're not looking at the the problem but they're looking at The God Who allowed the situation to take place for their good can you say Amen to that do not all things work together for the good I mean when you see somebody going through a trial and they're not murmuring they're not complaining you but they're saying Lord I count it all joy that's an oddball but you know that's God inside that man that's what that is or in that woman I've always believed if you're going to do anything do it with all your heart do it with purpose do it with passion do it with ambition do it with aspiration do it with motivation do it with value do it with substance I say do it with all your heart it ain't worth doing it at all I'll tell you when God made you he didn't make you halfway when he saved you he didn't save you halfway he put his whole heart into you he gave you his word he gave you his word and it's perfect word amen why would we want to be half-hearted back to him they that worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh this type of worshipper to worship him one who's willing to step out of the flesh the fleshly mind to get away from their worldliness and their thoughts and their feelings and their their worldly deeds and their worldly words and to step into the spirit realm where there's nothing that matters except Jesus Christ and I'll tell you it takes effort to get there it doesn't take any effort to go through those doors and sit in this seat in the flesh it takes no effort but to die out to the flesh to get in the prayer room mean business with God step in here and say I want to meet God and I want to I want to enter into the spirit and worship him because he is the spirit and they that worship Him must worship him in the spirit it is not an option to God it may be an option to us but it's not an option to God he will not accept any kind of worship In the Flesh amen all these worldly churches out there that come together and have entertainment they think they're worshiping God tell you God has put our sins in the sea of forgetfulness we ought to be the happiest people in the world Amen we just need to focus on how worthy he is amen how good he is that his mercies are new each day he's worthy he's worthy he's worthy I want you to place yourself next to the cherabin the syapin and all the Angels the heavenly host join along with them who are worshiping God did you know they're worshiping God they're honoring God their mind is not on what we're going to do when we get out of here for worship amen and I'm telling you this stuff needs to be taught in their homes children don't just grow up to love the Lord they don't and I think about it that God has placed us as parents in a pivotal part of their lives to be Christ to them until they receive Christ I think that's the greatest honor for a parent right there the greatest honor Revelations 5:11 says and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them were 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands has anybody got that number figured out that's a that's that's a lot this is around the throne that is a that's a lot of angels I wonder if any of them were just sitting talking about you know what's going to be happening tomorrow they were saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen Worthy is the Lamb he's worthy to be praised now that's why I say I want us to join with them because that's happening whether we're doing it or not am and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all them that heard I saying blessing and honor glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and even today today even today today today is not exempt and today is not exempt in the sanctuary I believe there should be something inside of us bubbling to praise him with all of our heart amen there's just something about entering into the realities of God it's easy to put passion into your word worship when you're there it's easy to praise him to the degree that all that hear your voice they know where you're standing but when you say Praise You Lord going to do my part I mean I don't care who's looking at me I don't care what people think he's worthy to be magnified and he wants us to Magnify Him in front of one another he does when we come to God's house we ought to be given God our very best no excuses no rebuttal no reasons no tiredness no I'm not in the mood today because I know God's asking where is the Thanksgiving amen that's right we ought to Humble ourselves for what reason to to worship him a person that doesn't want to worship they're proud and I'll say it like this we need to Humble ourselves to give God the praise that he's worthy of don't wait around for somebody else to kind of pick up the service and make it so easy for you to join in because God is wanting you to be like that one leper like when he left he did not care if the other nine came God is looking at you and he says I don't want you to think about anything except how much I am worthy to be praised amen and when your focus is like that you you're so zoomed in you're in his spirit in his presence cuz I'm telling you if you were in heaven if you were around the throne you wouldn't be thinking and what you're thinking about today you wouldn't be worrying about what's going to what you want to do later today the only focus would be is he's here he's here I worship you you're worthy I think we just need to come into church with that attitude of worshiping him with our very best Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll draw a men unto me you know what it how good it is when you lift up Jesus those around you just feel better your children your your spouses your parents everybody feels better around you when you're lifting up Christ but as soon as you start Dow somebody else you just ruin the atmosphere because Jesus isn't in Downing he's not he's not a downer Jesus is not a downer amen that's a good sermon Hebrews 3:6 we're God's house you know we're God's house Hebrews 3:6 tells us If We Hold Fast the confidence and rejoicing of Hope firm to the end in other words God's going to stay right with you in your house if you keep rejoicing amen but the moment you like give back to that and say well once saved always saved I don't need to Rejoice I don't need to worship I don't need to give my best God that Grieves the Holy Ghost God can't dwell in that type of atmosphere so he goes and he just kind of takes his flight and he kind of waiting for you to get back to where you were when you first got saved when you first got saved you didn't say I'm not going to worship God I'm not going to say thank you for salvation there was something inside you that you couldn't stop you from saying thank you amen I think we should have that today I if you think I'm an oddball then you can just call me the Oddball Pastor I'm okay with it I believe God inhabits the Praises of his people Psalms 26 verse1 I want to read the four verses there starting with verse number one Speaking of the coming coming to God's house here that's what we're speaking about Judge Me Oh Lord for I have walked in my Integrity I have trusted also in the Lord therefore I shall not slide amen now examine me oh Lord and and prove me and try me my heart see he was he had a real relationship with God that he wanted to be serious with God he wanted God to be real with him and to get him to a place that he'd be perfectly pleasing I think this is the most beautiful attitude right here verse eight Lord I have loved thy habit ation of thy house and the place where thine honor it dwells verse seven that I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works I believe we ought to come to church if nobody asks you to testify if nobody ask you to say something there ought to be something inside of you that says I am going to publish my voice with Thanksgiving today I am going to sing these songs like I mean them with the greatest part of my heart we're not making this church and I hope to I want to break that M today if I can amen I believe that we should from our heart have church break all the Traditions that the devil tries to put on us all the thoughts of the day all the things that we're going through all the problems that we have take a minute give God some Glory that's right amen let him know I Believe In You Lord you're more than able to do exceedingly above all that I all that I could ever think or want you're able he he wants to dwell in that type of atmosphere because I'm going to be honest with you that's who he is that's who he is he is not down here some little I don't care about you I'm not thinking about you I'm too busy doing other he's not down there he's God and we need to reverence him like he's God to to to to to desire to give thanks in in the sanctuary where his honor dwelleth Psalms 100 I think we should make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord come before his presence with sing do we really know if I could say this that the Lord he is God it is him that made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture how many times we come in and we think that God is just like a you know co- partner with us now I can't imagine I just can't imagine ever ever any one of my children coming to me and looking at me as if I'm just their coal partner just it's just not going to happen now I'm speaking naturally because they're not my Heritage they're God's heritag belong to God but here's the thing they didn't birth me I did not come out from them I can't imagine sitting in church and looking at God is just someone he's just a co-equal with me now I look at him as my master right amen my head amen the creator of my soul amen if he chooses to make me a joint he with Christ that's his business up to half of the Kingdom that's him that's not me saying I deserve it I'm still going to worship him as he's Lord of lords King of Kings he created me that's the problem with Lucifer he didn't know who he got away from who created him I'm going to be like the most High I'm going to act the way I want to act nobody's going to tell me and we end up bringing that Spirit into church how is God going to get Glory from that where did the Thanksgiving go enter into his gates with Thanksgiving the Bible says and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name you know you do not have to wait till we're singing to do that the word should be praised the word should be praised for he is the word it's easy to feel good when you're singing but it should feel good when you're eating the word for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting his truth endureth to all generations including this generation your generation today his truth is here for you for all of us to bless his name Amen to honor him that this word that we're hearing is not just the word of a man it's from the word of God right Psalms 95 verse1 oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hand are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the hills is also is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands formed the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker for he is our God and we are the people of his passion Ure and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice and Harden not your heart so I see in this Psalm we're being asked to look at God for who he is look at the birds look at the sunset look at the sunrises look at the mountains look at the clouds look at everything that he does the reason you're heart is beating is because of God today the reason your organs are functioning is because of God's Grace today look at God and worship him don't Harden your heart don't sit there and say I don't feel like it I don't get it I don't have to don't do that unharden that heart as I don't care where we're at on the realm of Prayer praise give them more amen give them more stretch that thing stretch your heart to God stretch your love to God stretch out to God give him what he's worthy of I believe that we've actually robbed god of what he's owed to him you know how how we've done it he you don't understand what I'm going through you don't know what I have to put up with you don't know the problems I have you don't know the half of it you know what you don't know my God that's all I want to say and I know it's pretty bold but I I I what I I know that the God that I know is the one when you're you're in jail you're chained up you're still praising him when you're in the fiery furnace you're still praising him when you're in the Valley of the wild you're still praising when you're in the Lion's Den you're still praising you swing those doors open you don't care you're an oddball that's the God I know that's the god I want to know amen that's the god I want to walk with that's the god I want to be my heart to be so open to say I Praise You Lord I give you the thanks that you're worthy of today I'm not going to wait another day I've robbed you long enough here the angels are so faithful Harden not your heart it's a choice it's a choice we have a choice to FOC focus on how great God is and and to pay him what we owe him what's due to him which is honor and praise or by default we can just sit there and make a declaration that he is not worthy of your praise amen that's by default you sit there do nothing by default you are telling him he's not worthy of your praise I want that to stick and I'm okay if you say that's not true that's just John Martin I'm okay you'll meet that someday because it is the truth he's worthy of all praise we get so proud that we just we just we we're so into ourselves that we can't we can't get into Christ we can't get into the spirit we can't worship Him in spirit and Truth Psalms 5 verse 14 Psalms 50 ver14 offer unto God Thanksgiving and what does this say pay thy vows unto the most high oh yeah you owe the moment you wake up in the morning you owe God Thanksgiving am he gave you another day of life a chance to serve him look the whole world wakes up breathes and cares nothing about God that's right and they will pay for every day they will pay for every day day because they're robbing God but if you want to get blessed by God don't Rob them don't Rob them anybody ever been so down in the dumps you just start praising God and all of a sudden you feel better you know what I'm talking about God says you put me first and I'll bless you you wait on me I'll lift you up into Heavenly places give God what's he's it's first don't sit around and say well God you got to work out everything in my you got to you got to heal me you got to do that you got to do everything and you know what then I'm going to praise you because you're God no that ain't the god you're serving the god you're serving deserves to be praised no matter what no matter what pay thy vows to the most high even Jesus himself said praise was perfected in babes so as soon as we leave the Babe stage I think the question starts arising where did thy Thanksgiving go where did it go because when we were a babe we were praising God with our whole heart well you know things are harder now what's harder is you're not focusing on the one who saved you come on it's okay if you say Amen to the word how would you feel if someone came to you into your house and started doing whatever they felt like doing in your house come on now I know you want to make them feel at home when they come into your house but what if they went beyond that anybody ever come in your house and started doing things that you didn't want them to do and you said I didn't sign up for this come on you know what I'm talking about and all of a sudden they lose their welcome like you want it's okay come on over but they went too far has anybody ever experienced that but God experiences is that when we come into his house which we're all welcome amen but he wants us to come in in Spirit come in with praise come in with Thanksgiving and don't make his house a den for Just selfness Right self gain give him what he's worthy of honor his house make it what he wants it to be we don't want to grieve them here just like you wouldn't want me going into part of your house and messing it all up you might let me get away with it one or two times because you like me but after a while you're going to say uhuh and if we want to get blessed by God start reverencing him more in his house start reverencing his house amen this is not the John Martin church this is not the sun theight church this is God's house we got to put some name on it it's got to be some preacher here but it's still his house and we need to honor it as it's his house God wants his house to be a House of Prayer yes Psalm 69:3 Psalm 69:3 I will praise the name of God with a song and and will Magnify Him with thanks Thanksgiving can you say Amen this also shall please the Lord you want to please the Lord I'm not asking you to put $500 in the offering I'm not asking you to stay in vacuum the church except brother Ron or sister Amanda you want to please the Lord Just Praise Him get Beyond where you're at amen and thank him because he's asking the question where did the Thanksgiving go where did it go I will praise the name of God with a song will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving this also shall please the Lord better than an ax or a bolock that have horns and hoofs The Humble is going to see this they're going to hear the word they're going to say amen and they're going to be glad and your heart shall live that seek God Amen oh I love that do you know the more humble you are the more you'll praise God and the more proud you are the less you're going to praise God I'm not making a general blanket statement but I'm making a general blanket statement because Hypocrites plays the Lord but they can get at least humble enough to do it but then they have that ability to get proud enough not to be sincere you understand what I'm saying amen but God is still worthy to be praised in fact he said if you don't praise me the rocks are going to cry out he's worthy and he's looking for it he demands it think just the nature of God forget me and what I'm saying here right now think about this in heaven all the angels and everybody in heaven are praising him now he set that up it wasn't us setting up Church down here he set his church up amen and I think what he told Moses is make sure you make the Tabernacle according to the pattern that I showed you in the mount I believe God wants to be praised here amen and and you are the church you should be praising him when you're not here amen amen Psalms 107: 19 then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses yes and he sent his word and he healed them and delivered them from their destructions notice there's an s on that thing all that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing I'll say this don't wait to after service to testify start rejoicing when the word comes when you feel in your heart I'm thankful just say praise the Lord I'm thank you thank you Lord I believe God is wanting us to stretch out from where we're at and I don't want to offend you for where you're at I just want to get you where God wants you to get to Psalms 116 verse1 17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice it's a sacrifice I understand you don't feel like doing it that's how much greater it's going to be I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people don't wait till you get home God wants you to do it in front of everybody well brother John this is private God just made it public he's taken he's taken this stock to the public he wants everybody to see how you feel feel about him right in the courts of the Lord's House in the midst of thee Oh Jerusalem praise ye the Lord don't be the one of the nine lepers come back and give him praise look you will be identified on how you respond to this message I want to be the one that comes back when you get time read Psalms 147 that's a good Psalms but we're going to pass that Revelations 4:10 the 4 and 20 Elders fell down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth in forever and ever and they cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are they are and were created so are you what are you created for all right I want to ask you this question you passed the test you got 100 Point you're you're okay pass the exam how much had did you do that yesterday how much did you save it for today I'm GNA just I'm GNA get you off the hook if you did that's okay but how come I'm not seeing it right now well I did it when I was singing no you were singing when you were singing I'm talking about worship which means you can do when the word is being preached you love the word you love God who is the word and he's calling out I want to receive the worship and praise that is due to my name he's he's you know what he's doing I'm GNA tell you what God's doing this morning he's holding out an offering plate look pay what you owe God wants to be praised if he didn't he wouldn't have all those angels up in heaven doing it everything you just be quiet hey do what you want to do you know free more agency do what you want to do yeah we have free more agency and he said Harden not your heart make a decision choose you this day who you're going to serve and do with all your heart do with all your passion deal with everything you got God don't want half-hearted praise God loves a cheerful Giver amen Psalms 35:18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation I will praise thee among much people Psalms 118:28 Thou Art my God and I will praise thee Thou Art my God I will exalt thee amen okay so if I say to you brother St I I I want you I want to prove you guilty for exalt in God I want to prove you guilty for exalting God you'd have to do a lot more than you normally do you have to step out of the boundary of where you've been to exalt him amen and I believe that God is calling us to exalt him Amen to praise Him above how we feel amen oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his Mercy endure forever you know sometimes it's hard for us to think about what God is what God has done for us to this day or yesterday you if you feel he's done nothing think about the blood he shed for your sins yesterday his Mercy is worth being praised for amen Isaiah 25:1 oh Lord Thou Art my God I will exalt thee I will praise thy name for thou has done wonderful things Thy Thy counsels of old are faithfulness and true that's righten Psalms 3119 oh how great is thy goodness amen which thou has laid up for them that fear thee amen which thou has wrought for them that trust in thee from uh before the sons of men Psalms 8612 we're just going through some scriptures you could see how much God wants to be exalted here Psalms 8612 I will praise the oh Lord oh Lord my God with all my heart right and I will glorify thy name forever more verse 13 for great is thy mercy toward me and thou has delivered my soul from the lowest hell amen Lamentations 3:22 it is of the Lord's Mercy that

way oh Lord I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name I will praise thee oh Lord my God with all my heart I will glorify thy name forever more for great is thy mercy toward me and thou has delivered my soul from the lowest hell amen Psalms 26:12 I read a couple more verses with that one my foot standeth in an even place in the congregation will I bless the Lord I believe that when you're standing here you're hearing the word of God you're standing on a firm ground anytime you leave the word of you leave the word of God you're on Shaky Ground that's right amen you got to stand amen with the word amen Psalms 34:1 oh I Will Bless I Will Bless The Lord at all times anybody want to say that with me all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth that's right my soul shall make her boast in the Lord you ever want to just be boastful and you know it's wrong I shouldn't you know I shouldn't shouldn't take you know I shouldn't take credit for that you know what I'm talking

diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that the youth is renewed like the eagles and that's not the band you know just want to make sure you understand it's not the band Psalms 103: 19 I just want to scoot down there I know it's not I didn't give it to you but I want to read it the Lord had prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all bless the Lord ye Angels bless the Lord you angels that excel in strength that do his Commandments that hearken unto the voice of his word bless the Lord that's what he's telling the Angels even the word of God is saying this bless ye the Lord all ye his hosts you Ministers of his that do his pleasure bless the Lord all his works and all the places of his Dominion bless the Lord all my soul amen everything that God has dominion over he's commanding to bless him amen that's why the person that God do does not have dominion over his heart they're not going to bless him but if God ever gets a hold of you and is on the throne room of your heart he's in first place that spirit inside of you will cause you to bless his name Psalms 104:1 bless the Lord oh my soul oh Lord my God Thou Art very great thou art clothed he's clothed with honor he's clothed with Majesty who covers thyself with light as with a garment who stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain I love this description of how great God is who layeth the beams of his Chambers and the waters who maketh the clouds his Chariot who walketh upon Wings Of The Wind who maketh his Angel Spirits his Ministers of flame of fire who laid the foundation of the earth that that it should not be removed forever Psalms 134 ver1 behold bless ye the Lord all ye Servants of the Lord which by night stand in the house of the Lord lift up your hands in the sanctuary oh wow yes lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the Lord amen the Lord have made Heaven and Earth bless thee out of Zion amen so as we're winding down here I wonder this morning which leper are you which of the 10 are you well brother John I just want to make it real clear I'm not a leper well we heard Brother Bruce say that leprosy is a a type of sin and we're all Sinners so which sinner are you we've all been healed we're all saved are you just going on your way are you coming back to give God glory so my question is where did the Thanksgiving go are you the one or the ones that go your way or are you the one one of the ones that come back to give God glory Psalms 115:17 says the dead praise not the Lord neither any that go down into silence but we will bless the Lord from the from this time forth and forever more praise the Lord I'm not asking you to stand but I'm asking you this question where you stand in Praise will you stand for praise will you stand praising the the Lord will you take a stand for praising God will you take a stand for giving him the praise that's due to him did you you remember you've been in churches where they pass the plate right you know the feeling you get when they're passing the plate right you know that feeling you get or sometimes you've gotten let me just say it like that like oh no they're passing the plate that's the first thought you get oh no they're passing the plate this is not my favorite part of the service and then you're watching where the plate is and you're kind of timing out when it's going to hit your roll and then you're thinking how much should I give depending on what kind of pressure you're under you're hoping you left your wallet so you pull out your wallet depending how you're feeling and all the emotions and the feelings you make a decision you ever been there and you put your money and as you're putting it in you feel good that you're giving then you have this thought did I give enough amen did you ever have that thought when you gave an offering did I give enough I want you to consider are you giving God enough praise I know we can always rely on God knows my heart but God wants to see your hands lifted yes he wants to hear you shout am he wants to hear you exalt amen magnify amen lift up I mean he there's many words in the Bible that shows how God wants to be praised and I believe as we step into that we can give an offering that's that he's pleased with do you believe that inside of you lies the praise that he's worthy of can you make a a decision to bless his name more to exalt him to give him thanks to glorify him to shout to magnify to sing to express to say I love you with all my heart my last scripture I want to share with us is in Hebrews 13:12 Hebrews 13:12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood he suffered without the gate want you to think about what Jesus did for you you know I'm still in debt to him brother Orlando since the day I realized he died for me amen I feel I know that I can't pay that debt but I'm still in debt amen I'm still in debt am and I love I love it I love that relationship in fact he wants me to remember it when I get to heaven he wants he's going to come up and he's going to say see these these nail prints in my hand let us go forth therefore onto him without the camp bearing his reproach amen amen for here we have no continuing City amen but we seek one to come amen by him therefore by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually and that is the fruit of our own lips giving thanks to his name now verse 16 is for us that seem to forget verse 15 but to do good and to communicate what we just said in verse 15 forget not in other words don't forget to praise the Lord amen for with such sacrifices God is well please let's Stand Together be an oddball stay filled with Thanksgiving amen in your heart I just want you to think about this that God is just simply calling us to a higher praise it to some of us it may just be more sincere to some of us it may be taking advantage of the opportunity to to worship the word when it's being preached cuz sometimes I think we just some of us kind of just sit and then and we wait till the end to say something and it's like God is speaking say thank you Lord for what you're you're feeding me amen because it's that word that's what we live by when we leave God wants us to take this word and worship him all day amen Amen to create that atmosphere around you of Thanksgiving to let others know that you have made your creator a God that's worthy to be praised I don't think praise is just for church but I think it's a place that we should be able to worship him better than any other place I know it's easier to praise him when you're alone nobody's around understand that but this is his house you come to his house where his honor dwelleth where his people dwelleth and God wants to be magnified in his house I would like to see the house come down as it were but you know we all got to get this revelation of how worthy he is right not what we're trying to make here but to get out of ourself and to to to come he's calling us to amen let's sing Thou Art Worthy no just no sorries no sorries only sories sores to the Lord Thou Art Worthy thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory glory and honor glory and honor and power for thou H has created has all things created thou has created all [Music] things and for the pleasure they are created Thou Art Worthy oh Lord [Music] th Art Worthy th worthy th Art Worthy oh Lord let's give it to him to receive glory glory and honor
