[35:54] For your word says where the
[35:57] where the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[35:59] liberty. We ask Lord that you would have
[36:03] liberty in our hearts to work your will
[36:06] in our lives and to accomplish the very
[36:09] purpose. Uh Lord that this service has
[36:13] been set aside that you could come and
[36:15] minister to us. Draw us closer to you
[36:18] and help us to
[36:21] Lord we just want to be more in your
[36:23] image today. We commit the service into
[36:26] your hand each soul, Lord, young and
[36:28] old. Bless the reading of your word. May
[36:32] it be accompanied with revelation from
[36:36] above, Lord, that we that it would hit
[36:38] home and accomplish the very purpose of
[36:41] it being spoken. Lord, we love you. We
[36:43] thank you for these things. And now we
[36:45] wait further upon thee in Jesus Christ's
[36:47] precious name we ask. Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to St.
[36:52] John chapter 18. Just have one verse
[36:56] here before you're seated and then we're
[36:57] going to have a perhaps quite a bit of
[37:00] reading.
[37:02] Hope that's okay.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll be reading from the word of
[37:06] God. That's the [snorts] most important.
[37:08] Amen.
[37:18] Amen. St. John chapter 18 and we're
[37:22] going to be reading verse number 37. So
[37:25] this is where um they took uh Jesus and
[37:30] brought him before Pilate. Pilate didn't
[37:34] really know what to do with him.
[37:38] And Pilate therefore said unto him in
[37:41] verse 37, "Art thou a king then?" And
[37:46] Jesus answered, "Thou sayest, I am a
[37:49] king."
[37:51] And he said, "To this end
[37:54] was I born,
[37:56] and for this cause came I into the
[37:58] world, that I should bear witness unto
[38:02] the truth,
[38:04] and everyone that is of truth heareth my
[38:06] voice." Amen. God bless. You may be
[38:09] seated.
[38:12] Well, we we want to entitle this
[38:16] remembering God's gift and for a subject
[38:18] the reason for the season. We've often
[38:22] heard that terminology. Don't forget the
[38:25] real reason of the season.
[38:28] And I feel the reason that Jesus was
[38:30] born was to bring us back to him
[38:33] &gt;&gt; into fellowship into oneness into a
[38:36] personal relationship to birth us and
[38:39] change our selfish nature back into the
[38:42] image of God. It was what God intended
[38:46] for everyone to be born with.
[38:50] When God, if the sin would have never
[38:52] took place in the Garden of Eden,
[38:56] then every one that would have been born
[38:58] would have been born exactly into his
[39:01] image.
[39:03] But God in his
[39:08] great plan did not want that to happen.
[39:14] He wanted um
[39:18] he wanted to see us be born
[39:23] uh through a satanic, evil, selfish
[39:27] nature
[39:28] and for us to turn that down
[39:32] &gt;&gt; to say, "No, I I want to be like Jesus,
[39:37] &gt;&gt; and I'm willing to die out to let the
[39:39] word be born in me." And I believe that
[39:42] was a a showing the bride's love
[39:46] &gt;&gt; to the bridegroom.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Uh and I I in God's province, that's
[39:53] what he allowed.
[39:56] And I believe that
[40:00] if we allow this oneness to take place
[40:06] that it would impact our lives and how
[40:08] we treat one another. Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; And thus it would bring about peace and
[40:14] good will on earth
[40:16] &gt;&gt; and joy unspeakable and and full of
[40:18] glory. And and that is really what
[40:19] Christmas means to me.
[40:22] But I'd like to read some common verses
[40:24] that that are usually read or at least
[40:27] some of them are read. So I'm going to
[40:28] go through them kind of quick. And first
[40:30] is in Isaiah 7 verse4.
[40:34] Basically the prophecy here. Therefore
[40:36] the Lord himself shall give you a sign.
[40:39] Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear
[40:42] a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel.
[40:48] Butter and honey shall he eat that he
[40:49] may know to refuse the evil and choose
[40:52] to go. Now, notice this that every child
[40:56] that is born, if he's going to come to
[40:58] the new birth, he has to learn how to
[41:02] refuse evil and to choose good.
[41:06] It's an individual free will that a
[41:09] child must learn that. I'll tell you, if
[41:12] you give a child everything he wants,
[41:14] that child learns to be spoiled.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; It never learns to not do the evil and
[41:21] choose the good.
[41:23] For before that child shall know to
[41:25] refuse evil and choose good, the land
[41:27] that thou shalt be forsaken of both her
[41:30] kings. That's a prophecy. It did come to
[41:32] pass. Luke chapter 1
[41:35] verse 26.
[41:38] And um this is where it all started. Uh
[41:41] here
[41:43] I I believe God
[41:46] spoke to Mary before Joseph.
[41:52] And in the sixth month,
[41:55] the angel Gabriel was sent from God into
[41:57] the city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a
[42:00] virgin exposed to a man whose name was
[42:03] Joseph of the house of David. And the
[42:05] virgin's name was Mary. And the angel
[42:08] came in unto her, and said, "Hail, thou
[42:11] art highly favored. The Lord is with
[42:15] thee, and blessed art thou among women."
[42:19] Now, we want to keep in mind, we're not
[42:21] Mary, but we are a type of Mary.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; And the bride is highly favored among
[42:28] all the other churches.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; And when she saw him, she was troubled
[42:36] at his saying and cast in her mind what
[42:39] manner salutation this should be. And
[42:41] the angel said unto her, "Fear not,
[42:43] Mary, for thou has found favor with God.
[42:45] And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[42:48] womb, and bring forth a son, and shall
[42:50] call his name Jesus, and he shall be
[42:52] great, and shall be called the son of
[42:54] the highest. And the Lord God shall give
[42:56] unto him the throne of his father
[42:58] David." My, what a type. God is going to
[43:02] come into us, and he's going to take his
[43:03] rightful position on the throne of our
[43:05] hearts.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; And he shall reign over the house of
[43:08] Jacob forever. and of his kingdom there
[43:10] shall be no end. And then said Mary unto
[43:14] the angel, how shall this be, seeing I
[43:17] know not a man? So how in this how in
[43:20] the world is am I going to become born
[43:22] again? How am I going to have the nature
[43:24] of Christ seeing that
[43:29] uh I was born this way? If I could say
[43:33] it like that. And the angel answered and
[43:36] said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall
[43:39] come upon you,
[43:42] &gt;&gt; and the power of the highest shall
[43:44] overshadow you."
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Therefore also that holy thing which
[43:49] shall be what? Born of thee shall be
[43:53] called the son of God.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul could could say, "It's
[43:57] no longer I, but it's Christ that liveth
[43:59] in me.
[44:01] And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth shall
[44:03] also conceive a son in her own age, and
[44:06] this is the sixth month with her, who uh
[44:09] was called barren, for with God nothing
[44:12] shall be impossible. And notice the
[44:13] angel of the Lord is trying to give her
[44:15] faith to believe for this supernatural
[44:18] thing in her life. And Mary said,
[44:20] "Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it
[44:23] unto me according to thy word." And the
[44:25] angel departed from her. Now if I could
[44:27] just say it like this. If we in our
[44:29] heart as the word of God is being
[44:31] preached, if we could just say, "Lord,
[44:33] be it unto me even as their word is
[44:36] being preached."
[44:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, the word is not for
[44:39] everybody. It's not.
[44:44] But it is for those who can receive it.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; And you just have to be the one that
[44:49] says, "Amen. I want this for my life,
[44:51] Lord."
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 1 verse 18.
[44:57] So the Lord appears to Mary now is going
[44:59] to come and is going to appear to um
[45:03] Joseph
[45:05] because Joseph didn't didn't get the
[45:08] revelation that Mary got
[45:10] because God, you know, I can't give you
[45:12] a revelation. You can't give me a
[45:14] revelation.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; If we don't hear from God, we're not
[45:17] hearing at all.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; But God is faithful to reveal himself to
[45:22] each of us. Amen.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[45:25] this wise in verse number 18. When as
[45:29] his mother Mary was
[45:33] uh when as his mother Mary was exposed
[45:35] to Joseph before they came together, she
[45:39] was found with child. Notice of the Holy
[45:42] Ghost. The Holy Ghost was the father.
[45:46] Then Joseph, her husband, being a just
[45:49] man and not willing to make her a public
[45:52] example, he loved her and was minded to
[45:55] put her away privately.
[45:58] Didn't want to make her a a spectacle of
[46:01] the situation.
[46:03] And while he thought on these things,
[46:05] behold, the angel of the Lord appeared
[46:06] unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph,
[46:10] thou son of David, fear not to take unto
[46:13] thee, Mary thy wife, for that which is
[46:15] conceived in her, it's not of another
[46:19] man, it's of the Holy Ghost.
[46:21] That's why we when we we are not just
[46:28] Methodist, Lutheran, Pentecostal
[46:30] assemblies. We're we're not just born of
[46:33] a church.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; We're that which is conceived of us is
[46:38] is of the Holy Ghost. We we've received
[46:40] the word of God.
[46:43] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[46:46] thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
[46:48] shall save his people from their sins.
[46:52] All this was done that it might be
[46:53] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[46:55] by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin
[46:57] shall be with child, and shall bring
[46:59] forth a son, and they shall call his
[47:00] name Emanuel, which being interpreted is
[47:03] God with us. And Joseph being raised
[47:05] from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord
[47:07] had bid him, and took unto him his wife,
[47:12] and knew her not till she had brought
[47:14] forth her firstborn son, and he called
[47:17] his name Jesus.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; That beautiful.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's go where Mary and
[47:27] Joseph go to Bethlehem in Luke chapter
[47:30] 2.
[47:32] And we can't have a Christmas uh service
[47:34] without some of these scriptures, these
[47:38] Luke chapter 2:6. And so it was that
[47:41] that while they were there,
[47:43] the days were accomplished that she
[47:45] should be delivered. And she brought
[47:48] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[47:50] in swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[47:52] manger because there was no room for
[47:54] them in the end.
[47:59] If they really would have known, I think
[48:01] everybody would have just made room,
[48:04] &gt;&gt; but they didn't recognize.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And there in that same country,
[48:09] shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
[48:11] watch over the flock by night. And lo,
[48:13] the angel of the Lord came upon them,
[48:16] and the glory of the Lord shone round
[48:17] about them, and they were sore afraid.
[48:19] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[48:22] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[48:24] great joy, which shall be noticed to all
[48:27] people."
[48:29] And the angel said unto them, uh I'm
[48:31] sorry uh uh I'll just finish reading it.
[48:35] Fear not, for for behold, I bring you
[48:37] good tidings of great joy, which shall
[48:39] be to all people. For unto you is born
[48:41] this day in the city of David a Savior,
[48:44] which is Christ the Lord. And this shall
[48:47] be a sign unto you. You shall find the
[48:49] babe wrapped in swallowing clothes,
[48:51] laying in a manger. And suddenly there
[48:52] was with the angel a multitude of
[48:55] heavenly hosts, and they were praising
[48:56] God, saying, "Glory to God in the
[48:58] highest, and on earth peace, good will
[49:00] toward men."
[49:02] And it came to pass that the angels were
[49:04] gone away from them into heaven. The
[49:07] shepherds said one to another, "Let us
[49:09] now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this
[49:11] thing which is come to pass, which the
[49:14] Lord had made known unto us."
[49:16] and and they came with haste and found
[49:18] Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a
[49:22] manger.
[49:24] What uh what a marvelous thing. Some
[49:28] humble shepherds
[49:30] &gt;&gt; that God appeared to.
[49:33] But notice the angel said it's going to
[49:36] bring
[49:37] uh this good tidings and great joy shall
[49:40] be to all people, not just to some, to
[49:42] all people.
[49:45] So we want to try to bring this this
[49:47] verse in that we we read in St. John
[49:50] chapter 18 verse number 37 and try to
[49:54] bring it into these scriptures. Pilate
[49:56] therefore said unto him, art thou a king
[50:00] then? That was his question because
[50:01] remember at his birth he was called a
[50:04] king. The wise men said where is is born
[50:08] king of the Jews? Where is he that's
[50:09] born king of the Jews? So even at the
[50:12] very beginning of his birth
[50:14] he was called a king and now Pilate is
[50:18] asking the question art thou a king then
[50:20] and Jesus answered thou sayest that I am
[50:24] a king and he says to this end was I
[50:27] born and for this cause came I into the
[50:30] world that I should bear witness unto
[50:32] the truth and everyone that is of truth
[50:35] heareth my voice.
[50:38] Jesus is sharing his own purpose of
[50:43] Christmas,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; his own purpose of what he was born for.
[50:48] It was to bear witness of the truth.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; So we just want to try to break this
[50:55] down. To this end was I born and this
[50:57] cause came I into the world. Jesus was
[51:00] born by the will of God, by the will of
[51:02] the father to do the will of the father.
[51:05] And that will was to bear witness of the
[51:09] truth. So this is this is a this means a
[51:12] whole lot here to bear witness of the
[51:15] truth. That was his purpose of uh being
[51:18] born.
[51:21] I it it so it it's more than just you
[51:24] know you know how it is. The whole
[51:25] church world don't even really know what
[51:27] Christmas is all about.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; It it's just you know Jesus in the
[51:32] manger. They lay it out the nativity
[51:34] saying and they give gifts and I'm not
[51:37] trying to to to be little any of that,
[51:40] but it it is so much deeper than Jesus
[51:42] being born as a baby and with the
[51:45] mentality that he came he he he he he
[51:48] came and he's our savior. And
[51:51] &gt;&gt; um there's
[51:54] it's much greater than that. And we're
[51:56] going to see as we go through here, John
[51:57] 3:16, for God so loved the world that he
[52:02] gave his only begotten son. Whosoever
[52:05] believeth in him should not perish, but
[52:07] have everlasting life. God sent for God
[52:10] sent not his son into the world to
[52:12] condemn the world, but that the world
[52:14] through him might be saved. He that
[52:17] believeth on him is not condemned, but
[52:19] he that believeth not is condemned
[52:20] already because he believeth not in the
[52:23] name of the only begotten son of God.
[52:28] John 3:16
[52:30] is probably the most quoted scripture in
[52:33] the Bible.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Uh with my research, it had over two
[52:39] million searches in 2025.
[52:43] that once that one verse
[52:48] yet it's probably the most misunderstood
[52:50] misinterpreted and misused verse as
[52:53] well.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; First of all, the gift was not eternal
[53:00] life.
[53:06] And what I mean by that, God did not go
[53:08] out and hand out gifts of eternal life
[53:10] to individuals that said, "I believe."
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:14] I wish it was that easy.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; I wish everybody that just said, "I
[53:19] believe had eternal life."
[53:22] &gt;&gt; But that is the way it's presented.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; That's the way the spirit of this world
[53:27] presents Christ.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; But that is not bearing witness of the
[53:32] truth.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; It's not like some Christmas present on
[53:36] the tree that says, "I believe that's
[53:37] for me."
[53:39] It wasn't God's so loving us that he
[53:42] gave us eternal life unconditionally.
[53:44] I'm sorry. God just did not hand out
[53:47] eternal life unconditionally to people.
[53:56] Eternal life is not just being able to
[54:00] live eternally when we die.
[54:05] But this is how the world views
[54:06] salvation.
[54:09] Jesus said, "All that ever came before
[54:11] me were thiefs and robbers." In other
[54:14] words, who wouldn't want eternal life?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; There's no question with that. Everybody
[54:19] wants eternal life.
[54:22] The question is, do I really want to
[54:24] live for God down here?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; That's the question. That's the problem.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; That's the hiccup. So if I can present
[54:32] the gospel in such a way that you enjoy
[54:35] the preaching that you have eternal life
[54:41] &gt;&gt; without doing anything without giving
[54:43] anything
[54:53] &gt;&gt; but he came to bear witness of the
[54:54] truth.
[54:56] Eternal life is a nature change.
[55:01] Let me just make this real clear.
[55:03] Eternal life is a nature change.
[55:08] Jesus didn't come to give us
[55:11] eternal life after we die.
[55:15] Jesus came to give us eternal life
[55:16] today.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; And it affects our nature today.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; In fact, if our nature doesn't change
[55:23] today, then we can't make it to the
[55:25] other side. That's what Jesus meant when
[55:27] he said you must be born again.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Not I'm going to hand you eternal life
[55:32] here when you die
[55:35] &gt;&gt; and then we have this comfort somehow we
[55:37] belong to this church or that church or
[55:39] whatever church and we have eternal
[55:41] life.
[55:44] When eternal life comes into a man's
[55:46] heart, it will change his very nature
[55:51] and they will begin to have a personal
[55:54] relationship with the word of God.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; It's much different than,
[56:04] well, I believe Jesus died for me and
[56:06] this I'm I'm I'm a Luther. I'm a
[56:08] Methodist. I I'm Presbyterian. I'm in
[56:10] the message or whatever it might be.
[56:14] And because I have that personal belief,
[56:16] I got eternal life. And that's all that
[56:19] matters.
[56:21] In other words, don't challenge me about
[56:23] any way I live or anything I do. Don't
[56:26] challenge me about anything.
[56:32] Brother Brandham said in the message
[56:34] that day in Calvary, he said, "Now the
[56:36] first thing I want to say is that Jesus
[56:38] never lived for himself. His life was
[56:41] spent for others. He said, "That's
[56:44] perfectly eternal life."
[56:48] &gt;&gt; When you say you go to church and you do
[56:50] good things, that's fine. But when you
[56:53] live your life to yourself, you haven't
[56:57] eternal life.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Wow. I'm so glad God sent a prophet.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; And I I'll say it like this. I feel like
[57:08] I'm more glad. just could be selfishly.
[57:10] I'm more glad that he showed me who he
[57:13] was
[57:14] &gt;&gt; because without that I would be lost
[57:17] &gt;&gt; personally.
[57:21] Eternal life is living for others.
[57:23] Brother Ram said it proved it when it
[57:26] come to the lamb of God. He lived and
[57:29] had eternal life because he did not live
[57:31] for himself.
[57:33] That's why people say, "Well, I I
[57:35] believe Jesus died for me and I accept
[57:37] him, you know, Christmas and and and
[57:40] he he he went to Calvary for me." And
[57:42] that's the end of it for them.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; And they live for themselves. They just
[57:48] hoard their life and do what they want
[57:49] to do.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; And and and and they're and they're but
[57:53] they still think they have eternal life
[57:55] because that's exactly what the devil
[57:56] wants them to think.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; But Jesus came to bear witness of the
[58:01] truth.
[58:06] He lived for others. He did not live for
[58:08] himself. He lived for others. And you
[58:10] receive eternal life
[58:12] by receiving that day, which was that
[58:15] day in Calvary. And you don't live for
[58:18] yourselves no more. You live for others.
[58:20] So what Calvary did is it opened the
[58:22] door so you could get the Holy Ghost.
[58:24] That's what Calvary did.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Because unless that price would have
[58:27] been paid, there'd be no chance for the
[58:29] Holy Ghost to come back on you.
[58:32] Calvary paid the price of your sin, of
[58:35] that of your past sin, of your nature,
[58:37] so God would be allowed to come back on
[58:40] you.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; God went to Calvary
[58:48] and gave his life unconditionally.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; But no man can benefit from that gift
[58:58] unconditionally.
[59:00] Just trying to rightly divide the word
[59:02] here
[59:04] like they would a Christmas present
[59:06] given to them unconditionally under the
[59:08] tree. Hey, this looks like this is for
[59:10] Joe and this is for Tom and this is for
[59:13] Sally here. And you pass out the gifts
[59:16] unconditionally. You don't say, "Hey,
[59:18] sign for this."
[59:21] Right? You ever get things that come to
[59:23] into your door that we'd like you to
[59:25] sign for this? You have to sign for it.
[59:27] All the stuff that we send to the
[59:29] government, all the checks and
[59:31] everything, I send it certified. I make
[59:34] them sign it and they get a report back
[59:36] because it only takes one time for them
[59:38] to say, "We didn't get it."
[59:40] &gt;&gt; You still have to pay the interest.
[59:42] [laughter]
[59:45] But not Christmas, you just give them.
[59:47] You don't even have to sign it. It's
[59:50] just yours unconditionally.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; So God went to Calvary unconditionally.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. As for God so loved the world that
[59:56] he gave.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean you
[1:00:01] unconditionally receive him.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Brother would go on to say that a pardon
[1:00:07] is not a pardon unless it's received as
[1:00:09] a pardon.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; So there is a condition to receiving the
[1:00:14] new birth.
[1:00:17] Amen. There's a condition to receive
[1:00:21] eternal life. Remember
[1:00:24] when the angels appeared to the
[1:00:26] shepherds and the angel said unto them,
[1:00:28] "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good
[1:00:31] tidings of great joy, which shall be to
[1:00:33] all people."
[1:00:36] In other words, Calvary was to the whole
[1:00:39] world. It was to whosoever will.
[1:00:45] And that's what it says in the book of
[1:00:46] Revelation. Whosoever will, let him come
[1:00:48] and drink of the waters of life freely.
[1:00:50] Ju just if if that's in your heart, if
[1:00:54] you're of the truth,
[1:00:56] come.
[1:01:00] The giving of God's gift was
[1:01:02] unconditional, but the receiving of
[1:01:04] God's gifts is conditional.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that we got to earn it.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Scripture for that is Ephesians 2:8. For
[1:01:13] by grace you are saved through faith,
[1:01:16] and that not of yourself. It is the gift
[1:01:19] of God, not of works, lest any man
[1:01:22] should boast. Look what I've done.
[1:01:26] So, it's nothing we can do.
[1:01:30] Nothing that we could do to to ever make
[1:01:34] Jesus go to Calvary.
[1:01:38] Nothing. There was nothing that we could
[1:01:40] do that would say, "Okay, because John
[1:01:44] Martin did this, I'm going to go die for
[1:01:45] him.
[1:01:47] nothing. He did that out of the love of
[1:01:50] his heart.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; For God so loved THE WORLD THAT HE gave
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; his only begotten son.
[1:02:00] But
[1:02:03] when we receive salvation, look at verse
[1:02:05] 10 now. For we are his workmanship.
[1:02:10] I don't know if anybody ever worked on
[1:02:12] something, but you know when you start
[1:02:14] to do something, you have an end you
[1:02:15] have an end result.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Those of you that uh clean, your end
[1:02:22] result is I want to see this place
[1:02:24] cleaned.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; You're doing a Sunday school project or
[1:02:28] a home project for the kids. You start
[1:02:31] with this, you want to end with this.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Well, well, God don't just save you to
[1:02:36] live what every kind of life you want to
[1:02:38] live. He said you are the workmanship of
[1:02:40] his hands. You He has an end result for
[1:02:42] you. And what is that? For we are the
[1:02:44] workmanship. We are his workmanship
[1:02:46] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:02:50] which is his works. That's the only good
[1:02:51] work there is is his works which God
[1:02:54] have before ordained that we should walk
[1:02:57] in them. No longer walking into
[1:03:00] ourselves.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; So we have the unconditional
[1:03:05] gift of God coming into the world to
[1:03:08] bear witness of the truth and providing
[1:03:12] us an opportunity
[1:03:14] to be saved through Calvary.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Because how many people are going to
[1:03:20] perish
[1:03:22] because they didn't take advantage of
[1:03:24] the gift that God gave at Calvary?
[1:03:28] That was the gift.
[1:03:30] The gift wasn't eternal life to
[1:03:32] everybody.
[1:03:34] I'm just trying to rightly divide
[1:03:36] because if Calvary saved every if
[1:03:39] Calvary just gave eternal life to
[1:03:40] everybody, then everybody would be
[1:03:42] saved.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Calvary was unconditional. What's
[1:03:46] conditional is you believe in believing
[1:03:49] the report. Not all believe the report.
[1:03:53] And the report is that God Jesus came to
[1:03:56] bear witness of the truth. And this is
[1:03:58] the truth. It's the whole thing.
[1:04:06] It's rich to me.
[1:04:09] John 3:16, for God so loved the world
[1:04:12] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:04:15] unconditional
[1:04:18] that whosoever believeth. Conditional
[1:04:22] in him should not perish but have
[1:04:25] everlasting life. See the see the the
[1:04:28] dividing line. For God sent not his son
[1:04:30] into the world to condemn the world but
[1:04:33] the but that the world notice through
[1:04:37] him
[1:04:39] through him might be saved. Not here's a
[1:04:43] Christmas present.
[1:04:48] God provided an unconditional
[1:04:51] opportunity to be saved. But we have to
[1:04:54] go through him, right? He's the way, the
[1:04:56] truth, and the life. He that believeth
[1:04:58] on him is not condemned.
[1:05:02] But he that believeth not
[1:05:06] because he remember he came to to bear
[1:05:09] witness of the of of of truth. He came
[1:05:12] to show us the truth to bear witness of
[1:05:15] the truth. And all they that are of
[1:05:18] truth will hear his voice.
[1:05:21] But he that believeth not is condemned
[1:05:24] already because he believed not in the
[1:05:26] name of the only begotten son. In other
[1:05:28] words, Jesus, he is the only way, the
[1:05:31] only truth, the only life. He was born
[1:05:33] to bear witness of the truth to show us
[1:05:35] the way to
[1:05:38] eternal life. The birth of Christ did
[1:05:41] not
[1:05:43] give us eternal life.
[1:05:48] It all starts with faith. The foundation
[1:05:54] of our walk is faith. The Bible says
[1:05:56] you're saved by faith
[1:06:00] and we walk by faith.
[1:06:04] We live by faith. And that we have to
[1:06:08] fight the good fight of faith.
[1:06:11] And the end of our journey is by faith.
[1:06:13] It's all by faith.
[1:06:17] We finish the course by faith. We must
[1:06:20] believe in order to receive.
[1:06:24] But our belief isn't like an
[1:06:26] unconditional Christmas present of
[1:06:29] eternal life. In other words, it's of no
[1:06:32] private interpretation how we believe.
[1:06:34] Like it doesn't matter how we believe.
[1:06:36] As long as we believe that, you know,
[1:06:38] Jesus died for us, then what else
[1:06:40] matters? Like it's kind of personal
[1:06:43] between me and you. It is not personal
[1:06:45] between you and it doesn't matter what
[1:06:47] you believe. You have to believe
[1:06:49] according to the scriptures.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to believe. We must
[1:06:54] believe his way which is the word
[1:06:57] according to the scriptures. The
[1:06:59] contingency or the condition is we must
[1:07:02] believe. And we can't just believe any
[1:07:04] way we want to, any way that we think.
[1:07:07] Not all that say Lord, Lord shall enter
[1:07:09] in, right? But he that doeth the will of
[1:07:12] the father, then you shall say to me in
[1:07:14] that day, Lord, Lord, didn't we do this,
[1:07:16] this, and this? So, it isn't just
[1:07:18] saying, well, I this is what I believe,
[1:07:20] and because I believe this, I got
[1:07:22] eternal life.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; No, we have to believe according to the
[1:07:27] scriptures
[1:07:29] to make it,
[1:07:31] we have to believe one way, and it's the
[1:07:34] only way, and that's God's way. Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; It's not what brother John says. It's
[1:07:42] what the word of God says.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 5:39, I think we read
[1:07:48] this maybe last service or two, search
[1:07:50] the scriptures.
[1:07:51] For in them you think you have eternal
[1:07:53] life,
[1:07:55] but they are they whichify me. So Jesus
[1:07:57] knowing ahead of time that the devil was
[1:07:59] going to try to throw out there to as
[1:08:01] many people as he could that they have
[1:08:03] eternal life. I mean, look at the
[1:08:05] Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[1:08:09] But he's telling us this is how we know.
[1:08:13] This is how we know whether we got
[1:08:14] eternal life or not. Search them. Search
[1:08:18] these scriptures. Forget about what you
[1:08:20] feel, what you think, what your mom
[1:08:22] said, what your dad said, what your
[1:08:24] pastor said. Look,
[1:08:30] the scriptures declare the only
[1:08:33] acceptable way how to even believe.
[1:08:36] For if you believe not that I am he,
[1:08:39] Jesus said, you'll die in your sins.
[1:08:43] Jesus said in John 12:48, "He that
[1:08:45] rejectth me and receiveth not my words,
[1:08:48] have one that judgeth him. The word that
[1:08:50] I've spoken, the same shall judge him in
[1:08:52] the last days." You see, so right there,
[1:08:54] it just doesn't matter what we believe
[1:08:56] personally. It matters that we believe
[1:08:59] the word of God.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's all that matters.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; That that that's our common denominator
[1:09:05] when we come to church here. What we all
[1:09:07] have in common is we don't care about
[1:09:10] what we believe. We only care about what
[1:09:11] the word of God says.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; That we are his bride by his word,
[1:09:17] birthed by his word,
[1:09:20] coming into his image.
[1:09:23] Everyone testifies that they're a
[1:09:24] believer
[1:09:28] thinking that because they say that they
[1:09:31] have eternal life.
[1:09:34] But Jesus says, "No, sir. The scriptures
[1:09:37] declare whether you got eternal life or
[1:09:39] not.
[1:09:40] We have to believe, but we can't believe
[1:09:42] our personal way." So there's like that
[1:09:44] contingency and that there's not a lot
[1:09:46] of scriptures that talk about this.
[1:09:50] And I think the reason is is because he
[1:09:52] hid it from the wise and prudent
[1:09:57] it and he it because he made it real
[1:10:00] clear. All they that are of truth will
[1:10:03] hear his voice.
[1:10:05] If you got a seed in you, you will
[1:10:07] recognize
[1:10:09] you're married to the word. [laughter]
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
[1:10:16] word shall not pass away.
[1:10:20] It's just like the scriptures proof
[1:10:21] who's the real believer and who's the
[1:10:23] makeel believer.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 7:38, "He that
[1:10:28] believeth on me, as the scripture have
[1:10:30] said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:10:34] of living water."
[1:10:38] Not as the denominations have said, but
[1:10:41] as the scriptures have said. If we
[1:10:43] believe according to the scriptures, the
[1:10:45] Holy Ghost or the living water is going
[1:10:49] to flow out of us.
[1:10:52] I I'm going to be honest with you. I We
[1:10:55] can be a Christian.
[1:10:59] We can have the Holy Ghost, but we can
[1:11:02] be out of the spirit.
[1:11:07] And the the the promise is
[1:11:10] that if we believe according to the
[1:11:12] scriptures,
[1:11:15] then we're going to have the fruit of
[1:11:16] the Holy Ghost in our life.
[1:11:19] And and and Galatians 5 tells us what
[1:11:21] that is. 5:22, but the fruit of the
[1:11:24] spirit is love. Think about this. Look
[1:11:27] at your life. Tell me if this flows out
[1:11:29] of your belly.
[1:11:31] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:11:35] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[1:11:38] temperance,
[1:11:40] because against such there's no law. Th
[1:11:43] this should be flowing from the person
[1:11:46] who receives Christmas.
[1:11:50] Are you with me?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] Because Jesus came to bear witness
[1:11:56] really what eternal life is.
[1:11:59] Against
[1:12:01] such there is no law. And they that are
[1:12:03] Christ, they that have received
[1:12:05] Christmas have crucified the flesh with
[1:12:08] the affections and the lust. If we live
[1:12:10] in the spirit, let us walk in the
[1:12:11] spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain
[1:12:14] glory or provoking one another or
[1:12:16] envying one another.
[1:12:20] So we see here that
[1:12:23] these scriptures tell us if we truly
[1:12:26] believe or not.
[1:12:29] How many people do we know? They say
[1:12:32] they're a believer and they're just
[1:12:33] outright sinners.
[1:12:36] Like there's no doubt even a child could
[1:12:39] say, "Yeah, they're not living the
[1:12:40] life."
[1:12:42] You understand what I'm saying? And so
[1:12:47] Jesus came to bear witness of the truth.
[1:12:50] That's what Christmas was about.
[1:12:53] and
[1:12:56] his whole life is showing us the
[1:12:59] Christmas gift.
[1:13:03] And he's to help whoever wants this in
[1:13:06] them. All you have to do now is receive
[1:13:10] the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost will bring about the
[1:13:16] nature change, coming into his image.
[1:13:19] And really what eternal life is all
[1:13:21] about. It's eternal. You don't wait to
[1:13:24] the other side to experience eternal
[1:13:26] life. Eternal life is lived here.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; It's not even experienced as an
[1:13:34] anointing that comes down and shakes you
[1:13:36] up or you speak in tongues or dance in
[1:13:38] the spirit. That isn't it.
[1:13:42] I mean, yeah, you're you're being
[1:13:43] visited by
[1:13:46] uh uh a heavenly places. You're being
[1:13:50] visited when that happens. But we're
[1:13:54] talking about receiving it IN YOUR HEART
[1:13:57] TO WHERE YOU NO LONGER are thinking
[1:13:59] about living for yourself anymore.
[1:14:02] You're living for others. YOUR YOUR MIND
[1:14:04] IS is the SAME MIND THAT CHRIST WAS.
[1:14:08] [snorts]
[1:14:10] And I think we've we begin to make
[1:14:12] eternal life what we uh want it to be.
[1:14:17] And we ought to be
[1:14:19] looking to the word of God,
[1:14:22] looking to the message to find out what
[1:14:25] eternal life really is. And are we
[1:14:27] really fulfilling the fullness of
[1:14:29] eternal life? I'm not trying to take
[1:14:31] eternal life away from anybody here.
[1:14:33] What I am trying to do is
[1:14:36] the way that I understand this message.
[1:14:40] Brother Brandon was always trying to
[1:14:41] make sure make sure you got it.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Even after you think you got it, he was
[1:14:47] still saying stay there and make sure
[1:14:49] you got it.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; And let's just say it like let's say all
[1:14:54] of us h have eternal life and everybody
[1:14:55] we know have eternal life. Wouldn't it
[1:14:57] be wonderful just to make sure that
[1:14:58] you're living more for others?
[1:15:00] [laughter]
[1:15:01] This is not this is not meant to be in
[1:15:05] any way a a negative thing but just to
[1:15:07] rightly divide what Christmas is all
[1:15:09] about.
[1:15:13] Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:15:15] you, he that believeth on me again,
[1:15:17] believing, the works I do, shall he do
[1:15:20] also, and greater works than these shall
[1:15:23] he do, because I go to my father." And
[1:15:27] and what did Jesus say the works were?
[1:15:30] The works of God is to believe on him
[1:15:33] that who God who the father have sent.
[1:15:37] And if the works of the Holy Ghost is
[1:15:39] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:15:41] shouldn't this be a wonderful
[1:15:43] opportunity for us to express those
[1:15:45] things to one another?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the true gift? I mean,
[1:15:48] imagine for a moment if we could take
[1:15:50] all the gifts away from under the tree
[1:15:54] and we could just sit there together as
[1:15:57] a family
[1:16:00] and express love, joy, peace,
[1:16:05] longsuffering,
[1:16:06] gentleness. If we could be that to one
[1:16:09] another,
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; wouldn't that be what really Christmas
[1:16:14] was all about?
[1:16:15] Not the commercial part.
[1:16:19] I mean, it's so easy to give a gift
[1:16:21] without thinking about Christ.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; It is. And then you're under pressure.
[1:16:28] How many's ever been under pressure? Oh,
[1:16:30] I didn't get so and so a gift yet
[1:16:34] this year.
[1:16:36] Within two days, my hand's still up.
[1:16:41] I mean, it's the reality,
[1:16:44] right?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; But how much pressure we've been under?
[1:16:46] Oh, I got to make sure I show so and so
[1:16:50] the love of God.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I got to make sure I'm more patient,
[1:16:54] more long-suffering.
[1:16:57] What What about that? Where's that
[1:16:58] pressure for that? Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Second Peter 1:8 says, "For if these
[1:17:07] things
[1:17:10] be for if these things be in you, what
[1:17:14] things? Faith, love, temperance,
[1:17:15] longsuffering, if they be in you and
[1:17:17] abound and make they make you that you
[1:17:20] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[1:17:22] in the knowledge
[1:17:25] of our Lord Jesus Christ." In other
[1:17:27] words, there'll be rivers of living
[1:17:29] water flowing
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; from your vessel. But he that lackth
[1:17:33] these things, number one, is blind.
[1:17:38] He cannot see a far off.
[1:17:41] And he's even forgotten
[1:17:43] that he was purged from his old sins.
[1:17:46] Notice he forgot Calvary. He forgot what
[1:17:48] Calvary meant to him.
[1:17:51] Wherefore it would be better, brethren,
[1:17:55] if you give some diligence to make your
[1:17:58] calling and your election sure. For if
[1:18:02] you do these things, you shall never
[1:18:04] fall.
[1:18:10] Jesus said, "To this end was I born, and
[1:18:13] for this cause came I into the world,
[1:18:15] not to bring the Christmas present of
[1:18:18] eternal life to the masses, but to bear
[1:18:20] witness unto the truth on how to receive
[1:18:24] eternal life."
[1:18:27] How to receive eternal life.
[1:18:30] And everyone that is of truth will hear
[1:18:34] my voice. This is to me the supernatural
[1:18:41] the supernatural thing that brother
[1:18:42] Brand tried explaining to all of us
[1:18:43] about having that seed that germ seed
[1:18:46] inside that we were born with that if we
[1:18:48] were ever a child if we're if we uh if
[1:18:51] we are a child we always were a child if
[1:18:53] we have eternal life we always had
[1:18:55] eternal life there's only one source of
[1:18:57] eternal life he began to describe those
[1:19:00] things
[1:19:04] Jesus said in John chapter 10 27 My
[1:19:07] sheep hear my voice
[1:19:10] and I know them and they follow me. So
[1:19:12] everyone that's of truth hear my voice.
[1:19:15] And Jesus said my sheep are the ones
[1:19:17] that hear my voice. I know them. Right?
[1:19:21] The foundation of God says sure God
[1:19:22] knoweth them that are his and everyone
[1:19:24] that nameeth the name of Christ let him
[1:19:25] depart from iniquity. So he knows who's
[1:19:29] belongs to him. And you know what
[1:19:31] happens to those that belong to him?
[1:19:33] They follow him.
[1:19:38] They do not say I belong to God and go
[1:19:40] do their own thing.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; That is not what Jesus said.
[1:19:45] They literally follow the word.
[1:19:49] And he says, "I give unto them eternal
[1:19:53] life." How is he going to give eternal
[1:19:55] life to somebody that don't follow him?
[1:19:58] Brother Brandham said that is satanic.
[1:20:03] Power without character is satanic. And
[1:20:07] to me, eternal life is power,
[1:20:10] right? It's power. Jesus said, "I have
[1:20:12] power to lay down my life. I have power
[1:20:14] to take it again." To me, if we have
[1:20:16] power to die out and live for others,
[1:20:17] that is not that's not you. That's God
[1:20:20] in you.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; That's power.
[1:20:25] I give unto them eternal life, and they
[1:20:27] shall never perish, neither shall any
[1:20:29] man pluck them out of my hand. My father
[1:20:33] which gave them me is greater than all,
[1:20:36] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[1:20:38] my father's hand. I and my father are
[1:20:41] one.
[1:20:44] It amazes me how many believers don't
[1:20:46] follow the word, but they still think
[1:20:49] they're following Christ.
[1:20:55] You talk about how powerful the
[1:20:58] deception of the devil is.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; I mean, you no wonder brother Rand said
[1:21:05] the devil's religious.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Getting people to think they're
[1:21:12] following Christ without lining up with
[1:21:15] the word. No. I'm so glad that Jesus
[1:21:18] came to bear witness of the truth.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If you love me, keep my
[1:21:22] commandments."
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; This this is this is the truth.
[1:21:29] My sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:21:31] me.
[1:21:32] The voice of God is what?
[1:21:36] The word.
[1:21:37] I That should have been anonymous.
[1:21:40] The voice of God is the word.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; You know what? Most religious people say
[1:21:46] the voice of God is, "Oh, God spoke to
[1:21:48] me. God spoke to me."
[1:21:52] It was this thing that just came to me
[1:21:54] and he spoke to me.
[1:21:57] And they emphasized that.
[1:22:02] And it then they kind of diminish coming
[1:22:05] into church and hearing the word of God.
[1:22:10] It's like they have a their relationship
[1:22:14] isn't with the word. Their rel their
[1:22:17] relationship is with their their own
[1:22:20] personal belief.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to say it like this.
[1:22:26] A man can never be changed by his
[1:22:29] personal belief.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; If the word doesn't birth you, you're
[1:22:34] not being birthed.
[1:22:37] Every man brings forth of his own kind.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And if we belong to God, we're going to
[1:22:42] be God
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; in flesh.
[1:22:46] To this end was I born and for this
[1:22:49] cause came I into the world that I
[1:22:51] should bear witness
[1:22:53] unto the truth
[1:22:57] and I should show the way, point them
[1:22:59] the way, and that every man is of the
[1:23:01] truth will hear my voice.
[1:23:03] Only the predestinated will catch it.
[1:23:10] Romans 8:29. For whom he did forno, he
[1:23:14] also did predestinate.
[1:23:17] Who are them? That's everyone that's of
[1:23:19] the truth. He came to bear witness
[1:23:23] of the truth. And everyone that's of the
[1:23:26] truth is going to catch it.
[1:23:28] Whom he did for know he did predestinate
[1:23:31] to be what? conformed to the image of
[1:23:33] his son that he might be the firstborn
[1:23:35] among many brethren. In other words, the
[1:23:37] whole point of Christmas was to bring
[1:23:40] about the new birth.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; It It wasn't some here's the gift, you
[1:23:45] got eternal life. Yeah, you're going to
[1:23:47] heaven.
[1:23:50] I hate that spirit because what is it
[1:23:52] doing? It's deceiving.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; It's deceiving.
[1:24:00] For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:24:03] his only begotten son unconditional
[1:24:06] that whosoever believeth conditional in
[1:24:09] him [clears throat] should not perish
[1:24:10] but have eternal life.
[1:24:14] This is the gift that God gave us.
[1:24:19] He gave us an opportunity to become born
[1:24:22] again.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; And it's us it's up to us to seize it.
[1:24:27] It's up to us to make a difference. It's
[1:24:30] up to us to make changes in our life.
[1:24:32] It's up to us to to to you cast away our
[1:24:36] personal belief and start looking to the
[1:24:38] scriptures. Start searching the
[1:24:39] scriptures. What am I supposed to become
[1:24:41] Lord?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; What do you expect out of me? Because
[1:24:45] see everybody, this is the truth. I just
[1:24:47] just face it. This is human nature.
[1:24:49] Everybody wants to go to heaven without
[1:24:51] changing.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; That is our first nature. Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; That's why you know people if if if they
[1:24:59] were never challenged never challenged
[1:25:03] I think this church would be overflowing
[1:25:05] with people
[1:25:08] but it wouldn't make them any more a
[1:25:10] believer. [laughter]
[1:25:13] It wouldn't make this church anymore
[1:25:15] spiritual. Probably be less spiritual to
[1:25:17] be honest with you.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Look at John 1.
[1:25:22] He came unto his own.
[1:25:26] Jesus came unto his own and his own
[1:25:29] received him not.
[1:25:32] But as many as received him, praise God.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; To them gave he power to become the sons
[1:25:39] of God. And to them that believe on his
[1:25:42] name. You notice it wasn't a Christmas
[1:25:44] gift.
[1:25:47] It wasn't an unconditional Christmas
[1:25:49] gift. You literally have to receive the
[1:25:52] word of God.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You have to receive THE WORD IN YOUR
[1:25:55] HEART.
[1:25:57] Not believe it in history what happened
[1:25:59] in history but that word is has to
[1:26:01] become real to us.
[1:26:04] Now this is what it means to believe on
[1:26:06] his name. Verse 13. what it really means
[1:26:10] to believe on his name. Which were born
[1:26:12] not of blood, not of the will of flesh,
[1:26:17] not of the will of the man, but of God.
[1:26:22] We have to be born again.
[1:26:26] And verse 14, and the word was made
[1:26:30] flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld
[1:26:32] the glory, the glory as the only
[1:26:36] begotten of the father, full of grace
[1:26:38] and full of truth.
[1:26:41] And when we're born again, the word
[1:26:43] becomes flesh in us. That's when people
[1:26:46] start saying, "I, Brother Ron, last time
[1:26:48] I knew about you, uh, 20 years ago, you
[1:26:52] were you were smoking cigars.
[1:26:56] Brother John, I remember I I used to
[1:26:58] smoke with you and and drink with you
[1:27:00] and party with you."
[1:27:03] Yeah. But the words become flesh.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brother M, I remember, you know,
[1:27:10] you used to swear all the time.
[1:27:14] What happened? The word became flesh.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; The word is becoming flesh.
[1:27:26] And the more you yield to God, more you
[1:27:29] yield to the word, the more it'll become
[1:27:31] flesh.
[1:27:33] See, it's not us waiting on God.
[1:27:37] God is waiting on us.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:27:45] He's just waiting for you to give more
[1:27:46] of yourself, give him more liberty,
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; to become manifested
[1:27:52] in the flesh.
[1:27:55] The real gift is to receive the Holy
[1:27:58] Ghost into our bodies and to become born
[1:28:00] again,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; the correct way, his way, the only way.
[1:28:05] And the Holy Ghost leads us back to the
[1:28:07] word
[1:28:09] which births us into his character.
[1:28:13] Straight as the gate, narrow is the way,
[1:28:15] Jesus said, which leadth unto life, and
[1:28:18] few people and few there be that find
[1:28:22] it.
[1:28:27] If you were trying to get somewhere,
[1:28:30] let me just say if the whole world,
[1:28:37] if everybody in Livingston County here
[1:28:41] was trying
[1:28:43] to get to a place
[1:28:45] in Jese County
[1:28:49] and only a few of them made it.
[1:28:52] That would be pretty special, don't you
[1:28:54] think?
[1:28:56] But they were all trying to make it.
[1:29:00] Wouldn't you think if they were all
[1:29:02] trying to get there, that'd be for a
[1:29:04] good reason.
[1:29:06] Maybe you might receive a free house. I
[1:29:09] don't know.
[1:29:11] You're trying to get there, but only a
[1:29:13] few make it. Wouldn't you want to be
[1:29:16] striving to get there?
[1:29:19] Why is it that people come to church and
[1:29:21] they don't have this spirit of striving
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; to become in his image?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Because they stare at eternal life as
[1:29:30] here's the present. I gave you eternal
[1:29:31] life. You don't even need to change.
[1:29:35] There's no
[1:29:38] longing to be in the image of Christ. No
[1:29:41] longing to manifest love, joy, peace,
[1:29:44] longsuffering.
[1:29:46] There's just
[1:29:52] wrong
[1:29:53] understanding about what Christmas is
[1:29:55] about.
[1:29:58] The word is what conforms us into his
[1:30:01] image.
[1:30:03] And it happens as we give God liberty.
[1:30:05] As I said, as we as we worship God in
[1:30:07] spirit and truth, as we're planted
[1:30:10] together in his likeness, as we crucify
[1:30:13] our carnal flesh, as we pick up our
[1:30:15] cross and follow him, as we yield
[1:30:17] ourselves members unto his
[1:30:19] righteousness, as we let the mind of
[1:30:21] Christ become in us. This is how we
[1:30:25] become into his image. And this is truly
[1:30:27] what Christmas is. I tell you, every
[1:30:29] time we come to church, we should be
[1:30:31] experiencing Christmas.
[1:30:35] The fact that you've heard the voice of
[1:30:37] the Lord is a blessing.
[1:30:41] It's an opportunity to believe.
[1:30:46] Jesus said, "In every church age, he
[1:30:47] that have an ear to hear, let him hear
[1:30:50] what the spirit is saying to the
[1:30:52] church." In other words, everyone can't
[1:30:55] hear in every age.
[1:30:59] How many people have heard about this
[1:31:00] message and just walked in and walked
[1:31:04] out?
[1:31:07] There are many, many, many people who
[1:31:10] hear the truth.
[1:31:12] They're blessed,
[1:31:14] but they do not follow it.
[1:31:18] Therefore, they do not believe
[1:31:20] regardless even if they say they
[1:31:22] believe. You know, to me, the scariest
[1:31:26] thing is, and I've heard this a number
[1:31:28] of times when people have come to
[1:31:30] church, they've heard the truth,
[1:31:33] and they just said, uh, uh, you know, in
[1:31:37] in short, I believe in God, but I don't
[1:31:39] believe what I don't believe in what you
[1:31:41] believe.
[1:31:44] That is the scariest thing because they
[1:31:46] have been programmed
[1:31:49] that what they believe
[1:31:53] is really above the word of God.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Somewhere down the line, they were never
[1:32:02] taught the importance in their home of
[1:32:05] the word of God.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; They were taught the importance of mom,
[1:32:09] of dad, what they say goes. But they
[1:32:11] were never taught that the word is is
[1:32:14] priority. It's preeminence.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It is what's going to judge you and I
[1:32:18] when we go to heaven on judgment day.
[1:32:25] Matthew chapter 13 verse 14. We're
[1:32:28] closing up here.
[1:32:33] Jesus speaking. And in them is fulfilled
[1:32:36] the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, by
[1:32:39] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:32:43] understand.
[1:32:44] In seeing you shall see and not
[1:32:47] perceive. You know, people can sit in
[1:32:50] church and hear the word of God and have
[1:32:52] no idea what's going on.
[1:32:56] For this people's heart is waxed gross
[1:33:00] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:33:02] their eyes they have closed less than
[1:33:04] any time they should see with their eyes
[1:33:07] and hear with their ears and what? And
[1:33:09] understand with their hearts and should
[1:33:12] be converted
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; and I should heal them. In other words,
[1:33:16] it's not a Christmas gift.
[1:33:19] You you've got to hear the word, apply
[1:33:22] it to your life, and become the word.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; It's the only way that we're going to be
[1:33:28] healed. It's the only way we're going to
[1:33:29] be converted.
[1:33:31] But blessed are your eyes, for they see,
[1:33:35] and your ears, for they hear. We ought
[1:33:39] to be the most happiest people in the
[1:33:41] whole world.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's praise God. HE
[1:33:46] PUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF US. THAT WASN'T
[1:33:49] US. THAT'S ALL HIM.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S all him.
[1:33:55] If you hear the voice of God, which is
[1:33:58] the word, follow it. And then you will
[1:34:01] become highly favored of the Lord.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You're blessed if you hear, but you
[1:34:07] follow the word. Now you're highly
[1:34:09] favored. You stick out amongst other
[1:34:11] people in the sight of God.
[1:34:14] To this end was I born. And for this
[1:34:16] cause came I into the world that I
[1:34:18] should bear witness unto the truth. And
[1:34:20] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[1:34:25] voice.
[1:34:28] I want to close with Ephesians chapter
[1:34:30] 5. To this end or cause or the reason
[1:34:34] for the season. God is going to have an
[1:34:38] eternal bride.
[1:34:42] Think about that.
[1:34:46] God is going to have an eternal bride
[1:34:48] and Christmas was needed to bring about
[1:34:52] perfection.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 5 22. Wives submit
[1:34:57] yourselves to your own husband as unto
[1:34:59] the Lord. For a husband is the head of
[1:35:02] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[1:35:03] the church and is the savior of the
[1:35:06] body.
[1:35:08] Christ is the head of us church. The
[1:35:10] word is your head
[1:35:14] and he is the savior of you. Therefore,
[1:35:17] as the church is subject to Christ, so
[1:35:20] let the wives be to their own husbands
[1:35:22] in everything. Husbands, now notice he's
[1:35:25] talking here, husbands, love your wives
[1:35:29] exactly,
[1:35:31] even as Christ also loved the church.
[1:35:35] And what did he do? He gave himself for
[1:35:39] the church. He literally died for the
[1:35:43] church.
[1:35:45] Now we know that
[1:35:48] the spirit of this world
[1:35:51] husbands don't love their wives
[1:35:55] rather they use their wives.
[1:35:59] So he's speaking here to
[1:36:04] uh
[1:36:06] he he's speaking in in reference of our
[1:36:09] relationship with with Christ, but he's
[1:36:12] given us instructions as believers.
[1:36:16] Husbands, love your wife even as Christ
[1:36:17] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:36:19] that he might sanctify it. Here's the
[1:36:22] purpose. and cleanse it and with the
[1:36:25] washing of the water by the word. Now,
[1:36:30] this is kind of strange because we
[1:36:32] really feel that somebody loves us when
[1:36:35] they give us what we want,
[1:36:39] right? when God just blesses us, fills
[1:36:43] us with joy, heals our body, supplies
[1:36:47] all of our needs, answers all of our
[1:36:49] requests, and this is what we consider a
[1:36:52] good God.
[1:36:54] But Jesus goes beyond that. That's why
[1:36:56] we got to search the scriptures. He
[1:36:58] says, "Many as I love,
[1:37:00] rebuke, chasen."
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; He wants to get us perfected. He doesn't
[1:37:07] want to hurt us. Want us to feel bad.
[1:37:15] Look at verse 27. So he uses the word to
[1:37:19] present
[1:37:21] him uh to present him to himself a
[1:37:25] glorious church having not having a spot
[1:37:29] or a wrinkle or any such thing, but it
[1:37:32] should be holy without blemish. Think
[1:37:35] about this. This without
[1:37:38] the birth of Christ, this would never
[1:37:40] happen.
[1:37:43] To this end, to this end was I born.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; That I might bear witness of the truth.
[1:37:52] And all they that are of truth will hear
[1:37:56] this right here. I am his bride.
[1:38:00] I'm going to let the word wash me.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to become more in his image.
[1:38:06] So ought men to love their wives as
[1:38:08] their own bodies. He that loveth his
[1:38:10] wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet
[1:38:13] hated his own flesh, but nourish it and
[1:38:16] cherth it, even as the Lord the church.
[1:38:19] For we are members of his body and of
[1:38:21] his flesh and of his bones. For this
[1:38:23] cause shall a man leave his father and
[1:38:24] mother and shall be joined to his wife,
[1:38:26] and they too shall be one flesh. This is
[1:38:29] a great mystery.
[1:38:31] But I speak concerning Christ and the
[1:38:36] church.
[1:38:38] Nevertheless, let every one of you in
[1:38:39] particular so love his wife even as
[1:38:41] himself and the wife see that she
[1:38:43] reverence her husband. Amen. Let's stand
[1:38:45] together. Let's remember God's gift this
[1:38:48] season.
[1:38:51] What it really is. Cherish it every day.
[1:38:55] Bear witness in every way of of what
[1:38:59] Christmas is. You bear witness of the
[1:39:03] reason for this season. And you know
[1:39:04] what's going to happen? Everybody that's
[1:39:06] of the truth is going to hear your voice
[1:39:09] that you're speaking because your life
[1:39:11] is speaking
[1:39:13] what's really important in your life.
[1:39:15] Your life is speaking what's really
[1:39:18] important.
[1:39:20] and and let them see that
[1:39:23] you just want to see them come to
[1:39:25] Christ,
[1:39:27] that Christ died for them and Christ
[1:39:31] sent the Holy Spirit to change their
[1:39:33] life.
[1:39:35] Amen.
[1:39:39] Let's sing that that song. Let your word
[1:39:42] be born in the manger of my heart. What
[1:39:45] are you smiling for? I know you're
[1:39:48] [music] smiling.
[1:39:54] It was a tiny simple stable,
[1:40:00] all beaten
[1:40:03] and torn.
[1:40:06] Hardly a place [singing]
[1:40:09] for a king to be born.
[1:40:14] He didn't choose some place special
[1:40:19] to reveal his majesty.
[1:40:24] So I know I'll give him control.
[1:40:29] He'll be born in me.
[1:40:33] Let your word
[1:40:37] be born
[1:40:39] in the manger of my heart.
[1:40:44] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:40:51] Live inside this house of clay
[1:40:56] and mold it every [singing] day.
[1:41:01] Let your word be born in the manger
[1:41:07] of my heart.
[1:41:12] Well, outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:41:16] Not much to behold.
[1:41:20] Unlikely
[1:41:22] the place
[1:41:24] for his word to unfold.
[1:41:28] But if I'll just yield this vessel
[1:41:32] and let him have his way
[1:41:36] from glory unto glory.
[1:41:40] He'll change me [singing] day by day.
[1:41:45] Let your word
[1:41:48] be born in the manger of my heart.
[1:41:55] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:42:02] Live inside this house of clay
[1:42:06] and mold it every day.
[1:42:11] Let your word be born in the manger
[1:42:16] of my heart.
[1:42:21] Oh, let your word
[1:42:25] be born in the manger of my heart.
[1:42:31] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:42:38] Live inside this house of clay
[1:42:42] and mold it every day.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Let your word be born in the manger
[1:42:52] of my Let's sing it one more time. Oh,
[1:42:57] let your word be born
[1:43:02] in the manger of my heart.
[1:43:06] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:43:13] live inside this house of clay
[1:43:18] and mold it every day.
[1:43:22] Let your word be born
[1:43:25] in the manger
[1:43:28] of my heart.
[1:43:33] Amen.
[1:43:36] [clears throat]
[1:43:37] That's such a desire that I have. It's
[1:43:39] if I could say it like this, it's just
[1:43:41] as important to me today as it was the
[1:43:44] first day.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our hearts. If we
[1:43:48] could close our eyes for a moment, maybe
[1:43:49] there'd be someone here today says,
[1:43:51] "John, Brother John, I
[1:43:56] pray that you would lift me up in prayer
[1:43:59] because
[1:44:02] I want to get more serious about the
[1:44:05] word being born inside of me. I just
[1:44:08] want to pray with you, man. It's my
[1:44:11] desire to pray with you. God bless these
[1:44:13] hands.
[1:44:15] Almost all the hands. Praise God. Praise
[1:44:19] the Lord. Father, we come to you with
[1:44:23] thanksgiving
[1:44:24] in our heart.
[1:44:27] Lord, first we want to thank you. Thank
[1:44:30] you for Calvary
[1:44:35] for giving us that opportunity,
[1:44:38] Lord, to receive you into our hearts.
[1:44:43] And we thank you that
[1:44:48] you came
[1:44:51] to earth
[1:44:53] born that you could die for us.
[1:44:59] We thank you for
[1:45:01] the work that you have started in all of
[1:45:03] our lives.
[1:45:05] And we thank you for your promise that
[1:45:08] he which have begun this work will
[1:45:11] finish it, will perform it until the day
[1:45:14] of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:16] And Lord, we thank you that
[1:45:22] you're you know the our very hearts.
[1:45:27] Your word uh is a discerner of the of
[1:45:32] our thoughts and our intents and there's
[1:45:35] there's nothing
[1:45:37] confusing
[1:45:40] in your mind about us. You see exactly
[1:45:42] what we have need of. Lord, even when we
[1:45:45] don't see, you see it.
[1:45:49] And Lord, we we lifted our our our
[1:45:52] hands, but behind that hand was a heart
[1:45:55] that is desiring, Lord, to manifest all
[1:45:58] of your word.
[1:46:02] And Lord, I pray that you would bless
[1:46:04] every one of us, Lord. the the youngest
[1:46:07] to the oldest.
[1:46:10] Lord, no matter how long we've been
[1:46:12] serving you, Lord, that desire
[1:46:16] rings a happy bell in your heart that
[1:46:20] that we your children.
[1:46:24] We want to we want to be just like you.
[1:46:29] We want to come to that maturity
[1:46:32] that we could be your eternal bride.
[1:46:36] We know, Lord, it's not a a a gift in
[1:46:41] the aspect as the enemy would try to
[1:46:43] present it. But Lord, you've given us
[1:46:45] this opportunity. And every every time
[1:46:48] we come to church, every time we get on
[1:46:50] our knees to pray, every time we listen
[1:46:51] to a tape, [music] every time we open
[1:46:53] the word of God to read it,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; you're giving us that that opportunity
[1:46:58] to say, "Yes, Lord. Make me like this.
[1:47:01] Make me more like you.
[1:47:05] Thank you for coming and bearing witness
[1:47:07] of what the real truth is.
[1:47:12] And Lord, by your grace, we have heard
[1:47:15] your voice.
[1:47:18] And we want to become
[1:47:20] in your image and in your likeness.
[1:47:24] May we not question or doubt, but may we
[1:47:27] just walk forward in faith,
[1:47:31] taking advantage of every opportunity we
[1:47:35] have to manifest you, Lord, to manifest
[1:47:38] love and joy and peace. May out of our
[1:47:41] bellies flow rivers of living water.
[1:47:45] May out of our hearts and our minds, our
[1:47:48] lives a life being lived for others. May
[1:47:51] it just flow out of us, Lord.
[1:47:56] Lord, take away that
[1:47:59] selfish nature that always
[1:48:05] wants.
[1:48:07] Help us to live for others, Lord, to
[1:48:10] look upon the things of others,
[1:48:14] Lord, and bless us with such a a power
[1:48:20] that it's no problem to lay down our
[1:48:22] life for others.
[1:48:27] Because Lord,
[1:48:31] you inside [music] of us can do the same
[1:48:33] thing you did when you walked the earth.
[1:48:36] We need you, Lord. We need [music] you.
[1:48:39] We commit ourselves to you. We give you
[1:48:40] our lives aresh Lord. We pray that you
[1:48:45] would answer every prayer of our heart.
[1:48:46] Lord, we love you and thank you for
[1:48:48] these things now. We praise you in
[1:48:51] [music] Jesus Christ's precious
