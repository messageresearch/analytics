TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here [Music] jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here [Music] amen that is really the theme of our message this morning jesus is here amen and if we can believe it then we can believe for what he can do but we've got to believe he's here to do the bible says exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think amen will god bless you greet you in the name of the lord jesus we're certainly disappointed for our wife not being able to make it this morning and if we could hold her up in prayer i know you've been praying i know she'd like to be here um also if we can remember brother o'well in a special way this morning sister cynthia said last night that he would not uh do an inter intubation or he would not be resuscitated and the doctors said that that was the next step if his his oxygen didn't go up it was in the 80s again and so they had prayer there but um his view is if if god doesn't do it then it must be his will for me to go on but our brother's been so instrumental in the work of the lord i've just been pleading for more souls and more labors that the lord would not be done with him and i just want to continue praying like that of course we want god's will above everything but god is more than able amen amen let's look to the lord in prayer before we begin reading his word amen heavenly father we just counted a privilege to be back in your house the place that we feel a refuge lord a shelter from the the storms of of of this world and lord uh we've gone through some natural storms here most of us uh but lord we've all been bad on spiritual storms the enemy coming at us from the left from the right lord you promised to raise up a standard against our enemy and lord we believe in your word and we pray that you would do that today we ask that you remember our precious brother rowell lord he stood here behind the sacred desk many times to give us the word of life lord he has stood on foreign ground looking for the seed of god in so many places and lord god we ask that you to raise them up from that bed of affliction lord you've touched many people you're able and lord more than able to do this and we just apply our faith with those around the world for our brother today that you would raise them up and use them for your glory we ask that you be with those that are not with us today lord those that are sick those that are afflicted those for some other reason we just pray that you would be with them and meet their need lord father we asked today lord that as we've assembled ourselves together lord for the purpose of receiving more of you we ask lord that you would prepare our hearts lord for anything that isn't prepared we want thy word to fall on a good ground today lord when we leave here we want to bring forth fruit out in the world lord that the world may see that you're alive yet today the same yesterday today and forever use our vessels lord now we commit the furtherance of this service in your hands and us your blessings on the word this morning for we pray these things in jesus christ's name amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of philippians chapter 1 philippians chapter 1. we want to read the first 11 verses there by entitled this message the living word is among us and for a subject remaining confident taking our our text from verse six but let's start with verse number one paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ i thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making me request with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of jesus christ even as it is meat for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defense and the confirmation of the gospel ye ar you all are partakers of my grace for god is my record how greatly i have longed after you in the bowels of jesus christ and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that you may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offense to the day of jesus christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god god bless you may be seated that word confident means convinced be convinced of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ it is very hard to keep our confidence in this hour that we're living the darkest hour that's ever been on the planet evils all around us it's hard to keep our confidence to be honest so many of us have been rattled in one way or another unforeseen things unprecedented things that we've ever seen before horrible things and as the world gets more and more evil it has a negative effect on the church be wrong to say that it didn't but it does it is so bad out there right now jesus said turn with me if you would to matthew chapter 24 he's foretelling of the confusion and the deception that would be in this hour that we're living in he start he starts out here we're starting out in verse 21 he says for then shall be great tribulation such was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be that's letting us know we're living in the worst hour there ever was now if i could say it like this the tribulation isn't just natural and he said except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect say those days shall be shortened think about it even the elect for the elect's sake those days are so bad that they have to be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo he is cr here's christ or there believe it not for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold i have told you these things before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he's in the secret chambers believe it not if you think about even when god called brother branham out to the desert he told the people don't follow me even though god caught him there and god was going to meet in there god doesn't want us to be following people to christ god wants us to believe that christ is with us for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be for here it is for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together we've got to believe the living word is among us now things are pretty bad but if we believe that we are god's elect we should have anything to worry about no matter how bad it gets no matter how hard our trials are no matter what we're going through if we believe we're god's elect everything's going to be okay in fact god is doing something just for us what is he doing he's going to shorten the days just for us it's not about how bad the world is that's true it's about how confident you are it's about remaining confident who you are to the end amen that the living word is among us it hasn't left right now you know we sometimes come in church and we're sitting there and we're waiting to see something you know what you're doing when you do that you're literally saying i didn't bring christ that's what you're saying oh i brought christ i'm looking to see if anyone else got it well why don't you start showing what you got [Music] if there's anything that i believe our church is short on it's giving god the praise that he's worthy to be praised with every time we come together he deserves he's been so good to all of us he's been so faithful and yet we come short of just praising him with just a little bit of time that we have together now i understand we praise him with our life but there should be something happening when we come together as a family kind of word let down our hair and just praise god that's right now when we come to church we must first believe that the living word is among us he promised it first we must believe it then we must recognize him in the word that christ is speaking to us personally not just kind of globally but personally and understand what it is that he is speaking to us what he wants us to do and finally we must follow through with obedience to the word and testify of it and testify and this is really i don't like to use the word routine but this is the routine we don't come to church for a show we don't come to feel good we come to hear from god and we got to believe that god is here and we've got to be able to be in tune with the spirit to receive what he's speaking to us personally and then we got to walk out and obey it amen and then we have fulfilled his will because we're not here to hear a dead letter we're here to hear the living word amen now we're always in a battle and the devil will do everything he can to keep us from what obeying the word he don't care if we listen he don't care if we say amen but he don't want us obeying it that's why we've got to hear it from personally from god and go out and do it bible says we got to put on the whole armor of god cast down imaginations in every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience if we never follow through and do the obedience what's the use of even bringing the thought into captivity and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when when your obedience is fulfilled in one sense in one sense we're all obedient right to what god has spoken to us to do and we've done it in another sense we're all disobedient to what we haven't done that he's asked us to do and yet we come let's say we come to church perfect perfectly obedient well he has a new word for us and this is the way that we need to feel we need to feel that we're going to hear instructions from god we're going to hear what he wants us to do so we better pay attention if we went to school or college or whatever it was and the first thing the teacher said when he got up is we're going to have a quiz at the end of the service today and it's going to be half of your grade i am telling you we wouldn't be sitting around trying to enjoy what kind of joke he's going to be saying today or or maybe we'll just catch up on it later this week we'd be paying attention to what's being said and if the living word is amongst us we need to be hearing what he's saying to us personally because it doesn't matter what he's saying to this brother or this sister it matters to what he's saying to you amen we must believe the living word is among us we must identify what it is he's saying to us personally and we must follow through when we leave here to obey what he said now that's a big thing that's a that's a big scope but that's the reality of a relationship with jesus christ now if we don't do that there's a disconnect somewhere a disconnect now you all know what a disconnect is brother router can tell you what a disconnect is you can have everything hooked up to your air conditioner but if the disconnect is turned off it won't allow the power to go through and if there's a disconnect somewhere in this formality or this formula of believing god's here that he's speaking to us personally we can identify exactly what it is that he said to us personally i don't know what he said to my brother sin i don't know what he he said to my brother james but i know what he said to me and i'm going to follow through with it if that doesn't happen there's a disconnect somewhere each and every time we come to church we must have confidence that the living word is amongst us we have gotten to a place where we have just questioned and doubted it's true but we need to build it back up because god promised never to leave us never to forsake us our confidence must remain into the rapture hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 says for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stead fast unto the end amen god doesn't give us any loopholes here we can't just say i'm made partaker of christ because i repented and i got baptized right how many times have we had thoughts of throwing in the towel now we've all had them we've all had them it's true but that doesn't make me a partaker of christ if i throw in the towel in my mind the devil wants me to think that but that's not what god wants me to think he wants me to hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast right to the end amen being confident of this very thing he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ we must remain confident yes to the very end the living word is amongst us amen i'll say it like this the living word is with you with every situation in your personal life come on now i just want you to focus on this because what good is the word if they can't help our personal lives the living word is amongst us in every rotten situation of our life it's there for a reason it's to help us how many times uh something bad goes wrong and and the devil says well he must have forsaken you he must have just wrote you off too often we lose our confidence in god because sometimes unknowingly we put our confidence in some other thing than god's word or we get our eyes on some person and they let us down leaving us disappointed discouraged or really not knowing who to believe in what to believe we must always remember when this happens god has never let you down amen amen god has never failed amen other human beings fail us and they always will we need to get over it because i'll say it like this you have failed right you have failed me you have failed your employer you have failed your neighbor you have failed your spouse you have failed god yet you're going to hold another human being up for not being able to fail what is that but it doesn't have anything to do because god still among us the problem is when you start looking at one another's faults and problems before you you begin to judge and question god is allowed to be among us when there's human problems human problems doesn't mean god's not among us we don't realize but when we put too much confidence on other people and not enough in god you know god wants humans to fail you when you put too much confidence in them we're never to put confidence in a human being above what they are and they're a human being but john you know and this is this is this isn't just for the you know the preachers or for those who who are uh spiritual in the church or who we look up to but understand everybody has the tendency of holding someone else accountable and i don't care if it's the waitress the person at the drive-through a doctor oh i'm paying that doctor i mean sure you better tell me the truth you better tell me like it is you better not fail you better not lie lawyers judges they've all been bought off not all of them but they just because they hold that title we live in a world of humanity so we don't look to one another as if they need to be perfect they don't in your sight they don't but we need to get our confidence in god his living word is among us not a dead letter just because someone is elect doesn't mean that they're not going to let you down psalms 118 verse 8 says it's better to trust the lord than to put confidence in man now that's the middle verse in the whole bible well to stay with it stay right down the middle of the road that's good turn with me if you would to second timothy chapter three paul adding to the end time prophecy of of the confusion this hour and the deception in this last age he says in verse number one know this also that this know also in the last days perilous times shall come for eventually lovers of their own self covetous bolsters prowl blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinence fears despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god now this is in the church and and we all know these verses and i'm going through them quickly but this is who we rub shoulders with now it shouldn't be among us but it is right but just because that's here doesn't mean the living word is not here this is not a message to discourage us because of the humanity that we have to deal with this is a message to encourage you that no matter what humanity is with us no matter what problem is with us the living word is still here to see us through now look they're having a form of godliness that they're denying the power thereof from such turn away paul is warning us to stay away from fellowship that compromises with full power think about that he doesn't want us to have fellowship with just someone who believes in a little bit of power this is a serious thing this is calling us for total separation from unbelief because why what happens when you hang around somebody who's halfway in right it's good you begin to compromise you know the devil does it he says well you're better than them you're further along than them you don't have to worry go do what you want to do now think about this is so strange to me but instead of spending more time in prayer seeking the power of the holy ghost believers want to spend more time learning verse 7 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth the knowledge of the truth is you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you you're not going to get power by learning more learning doesn't bring the power of god now in the world they'll tell you power is knowledge but i'm here to tell you the holy ghost is power the living word is what brings power it's alive [Music] we know the written word here we're reading we're talking about it we're hearing it but what we're looking for we're looking for that living word to come right here and live inside of us verse 10 but thou is fully known my doctrine my manner of life my purpose long suffering charity my faith my patience persecutions afflictions which came up to me at antioch iconium lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me proving the lord was with him the living word was among them yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus are going to suffer the same type of persecutions and evil men seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived here's the verse i want to get to but continue down the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom those learn them now god wants us to keep our confidence to the end amen continue in the word continue doing what the word tells you to do i mean there might have been a time in your life that god said you need to hang the ten commandments in your room in your house but i'm telling you he's probably not telling you that today he's telling you to move on no matter what he has told you in the past he's asking you to move on continue in this process with christ you know what happens when we get so carnal in the flesh i don't care what the problem is in life i don't care what you're looking for i don't care what your hang-ups are what you're going through if we get so carnal in the flesh that the only way we can receive of god is he better preach that one scripture give that one quote then oh no like you're going to put god in a box like you're going to tell god what to do right i'm praying i'm praying for you know for brother rowell i says god i can't tell you what your will is i can only bring forth my strong reasoning bring forth my just cause god is god he's here to do more than what we would ask or even think but we got to get in tune with the living word [Music] the living word paul is telling timothy and god is telling us to be assured the living word is among us continue in the things that thou has learned being assured that god is the one that taught them to you amen it wasn't some theology it wasn't some man it was god in the men the fightful ministry the living word is among us saints it's time to start beefing up our confidence in god again he's never failed one time he's got a perfect record in heaven we need to stop putting our confidence in man and start trusting the lord more just start trusting him when i say we got to stop putting our confidence in man i'm talking about one another the more you look to the flesh the less you're going to look to god that's true not saying god don't use one another but what i am saying is you need to be looking to god there is no mediator between god and man except the man christ jesus peter turn with me to second peter chapter 3 please peter wanting to stir up what we've already been taught in the word we're facing a lot of spirits today this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you be mindful of the words which are spoken before by the holy prophets and the commandment of us the apostles of our lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers scoffers okay now notice their true intent their true motive is to walk after their own desires they have no interest for souls no interest in living for one another it's their own and when you try to tell them what they need to do they scoff and saying where is the promise of his coming now i just want to ask you a question how many of you have asked that in the last six months should have been here by now why are we going through this what's going to happen for since the fathers fell asleep since brother brown all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god and the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water were whereby the world that then was being overthrown with water perished but the heavens and earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved again unto the fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be nothing you know this one thing that one day is with the lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise the more and more i go on the more and more i see there's only one will that's going to last and it's god's will everything satan started everything man started it's going to come to an end god's will is the only will that matters the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some man counts sackness but is long-suffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance i just wonder if there's someone who hasn't come to repentance yet he doesn't want them to miss it he's being long-suffering he's waiting for them to repent whoever they are wherever they're at and here we are not helping him not helping the father with his eternal purpose reaching out because we're so caught up in our own world i know you don't want to hear that but we need to get building amen with god because it's the only will that matters but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heap the earth also with the works that are therein shall be burned up there's not a whole lot of hope left for the world is there seeing them that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be think about this knowing that the world at any moment is going to be annihilated what person should we be that's what the word is asking us now we can't just answer i ought to be what i am we ought to be answering i need to do this instead of that in all holy conversation that's the life that we live ungodliness now coming with that godliness is going to suffer persecution looking for and hasting until the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we look we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness keeping our eyes on the prize amen god wants our confidence to re remain intact he's not slack he's if there's anything that seems to be out of place it's me not looking for a soul it's me not looking for a soul that that's what's out of place because god's program is moving forward now i got to thinking you know what what happened with brother rowell died i mean he's run his race he has won souls he's got jews in this ground what about me what about me friends what about you i know we're a small church and we don't got the biggest orchestra we don't get the best preacher we know that but we the living word is among us his word has gotten across to us he's looking for somebody to bite into it and start living it after jesus left the scene a couple of his christian brothers were walking on the road to mass we all know the story jesus was now gone and they were left alone and one of the brothers named claphaus said these words he said but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done now notice his word was trusted we trusted they didn't continue to be trusting their trust wasn't remaining they were doubting and this is what bothered jesus i know jesus is here but is he bothered we can say we trusted but are we living are we trusting are we with the living word today they should have been trusting because the living word was right amongst them and they didn't know it now even though we don't see we don't always feel the presence of god these natural senses don't declare that the living word is here but by faith supernaturally we believe that he is here and the more that you can enter into that faith that belief entered into the word hungry thirsty god i want you god i'm needing you the more god will make himself known to you but the more you come just looking for some information looking for this looking for that and not looking for him i understand that you've trusted but are you trusting what counts is that you're walking by faith in the supernatural and not by sight in the natural amen we're spiritual beings in a natural body we're trapped in these natural bodies but we can start activating acting like we believe the living word is here you know you go in a restaurant i can see you just sitting there kind of like you know whatever when's the waitress gonna get in but this is church this is a place where he is here there's no question about it why are we worshiping that living word he that living word wants to be worshipped and it should be because he is the same yesterday today and forever i believe sometimes we're just not we're not catching the living word we're too much in the natural we hearing natural things trying to understand naturally and carnally when we don't pray enough to enter into the spirit of the living god these disciples were greatly troubled that the living word was leaving them for the rest of their earthly life they were bothered about it they were going to have to find some other way to get help and that's what was bothering them and jesus tried comforting them hey look i'm going to come back i'm going to be right inside of you so don't you worry but why is it today that we get away from the god that lives inside of us and we're looking for god and somebody else to help us we're losing our relationship with god we're losing the purpose of why he said i will come and be with you even in you amen he's wanting he's jealous and he wants us to look to him whether god uses somebody that's up to god it ain't up to you don't be looking to somebody else to get help start building your relationship with god spend more time on your knees get in that prayer closet god said if you seek me i will reward you openly did it ever occur to you that god is wanting you to seek him inside of you he's inside and he wants to seek he wants you to seek him inside of you therefore i don't need to talk to this brother i don't need to talk to this sister i just need to get on my knees and believe the living word is among us jesus didn't come to save his bride and just leave his bride alone no he's among us amen he said i'll never leave her amen saint john 14 verse 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while the world sees me no more but you shall see me because i live ye shall live also now you come to church now we know the world don't see christ they don't even see their own agenda or their own their own gender we come to church we should be seeing jesus because he promised you'll see me the world's not going to see me but you're going to see me well i'm not seeing them the way i want okay okay i understand but what are you going to do about it are you going to sit there and wait for something to make you feel better to say you see or you're going to get serious and spend more time preparing because even god himself said you shall seat me and find me when you search for me with all your heart god is interested in all your heart well he's got it does he does he our hearts deceptive above everything how do we know every man's arrogant and his own eyes right in his own eyes the humble that he gives grace to jesus was telling them that he was going to be among them not to worry now i can't see god for you you can't see god for me i can't believe for you and you can't believe for me i'm not saying that you can't pray for me and i can't get healed that's not what i'm saying but i'm saying when it comes to a relationship with jesus christ it's a personal relationship we don't make it on anybody else's shirt tale it's time for the bride to to get strong again we've got to start taking the land that belongs to us matthew recorded their last service together in matthew 28 verse 17. this is the last service they had and when they saw him what'd they do they worshipped him yes i wonder why we come to church we don't worship like we should i think it's because we don't see him because if you saw him literally with your eyes you would worship more and it's okay we don't see him with our natural eyes but something in hot here should say i know he's here i know he's here he's among us he promised to be i'm hungering for that living word i will worship him i will praise him i will exalt him for he is worthy well brother john it's it's just i'm not used to this type of stuff i understand your flesh never will be but god is calling to your soul when god said seek my face my soul my heart said unto him thy face will i seek god ain't calling to our flesh if there's anything about our flesh he wants it crucified but something inside of us needs to be worshipping him and when they saw him they worshipped him but what some sat in church and doubted and they came and they spake on him saying and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth i want you to go therefore and teach everybody every place you go all nations all cities all towns baptize them oh brother john i never baptize anybody you got scripture right here you got a scripture to baptize them you don't need to be a preacher to baptize somebody baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and please make sure it's the name not the titles teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i've commanded you now you've been paying attention long enough the last 10 years there should be a lot of things god commanded you to do and god wants you to teach them to observe all things whatsoever i've commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the world the living word is amongst us not the he didn't sound and leave you a book i'm going to leave you a book with some words that i spoke in the past no the living word amen don't take no thought what you'll think what you'll say for the holy spirit will give you honor answer in a moment because it's a living word it's okay that our physical senses don't declare him here i don't care about them anyways they do nothing but get me in trouble they make me look at wrong things they maybe think wrong things imagine wrong things hear wrong things lost wrong things i'm interested in the living god for my soul there's no perfection to this flesh no flesh will glory in his presence it can't even enter the kingdom of heaven he doesn't want nothing to do with it it was a perverted birth to begin with we got a new body waiting us [Music] we need to get our eyes off of one another get our eyes on christ don't just look to jesus as the author who started for you got baptized told you you were a sinner but look to him to finish it he's the finisher of our faith how is he going to get you there he's going to get you there by telling by doing what he tells you to do today not don't wait till tomorrow right i'm on how many times we come to church and we missed what god was trying to speak to us because our heart wasn't there our mind wasn't there our interest wasn't there and we didn't believe the living word was amongst us we thought it was some dead letter we throw some man up there trying to tell us what to do trying to tell us what to live trying to tell us the bible trying to tell us this thought no no that's from the devil that's because we're coming to church all carnal service after service after service and trying to build ourselves up in what right we should be building ourselves up in the most holy faith revelation upon this rock i'll build my church a living rock when you get a revelation that's alive brother that's a live sister a dead letter can't build anything that kills it destroys it it's a knowledge is against this revelation of god's word oh god stermi we need to remain confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it when's he going to do it what am i going to see in the church when's he going to do it when am i going to perform it until he's doing it every time you come to service brother he's doing it every time you come to service sister he's performing it well i'm just not catching it god came down to our level to die for sin but now he's called every one of us to repent mean come up to him to get seated in heavenly places to die out to meet him in a realm a spiritual realm where he speaks to his bride he makes known to his bride what to do amen well i'm just not quite hearing it all the more we should be spending more time with god amen that's right until you get to hear that voice learn that voice it's not a matter of getting a better preaching it's not even a matter of getting a better atmosphere in this building it's about your heart getting a better atmosphere your mind getting a better atmosphere amen because god isn't in this and in this and in this god said i'm in this i'm in this heart right here that's where you'll meet me no so when you get on your knees to pray you're looking to meet the god inside of you he's among us hopefully i don't feel him stay there stay there he'll come how many met him this morning you know his presence was there before i got to church i was weeping in the car before i got here [Music] couldn't help it couldn't help it was not hard for me to pray when i got to church because i prayed this morning amen all of heaven is behind us making a rapture in fact heaven has put out a special tactic just to make sure he gets accomplished john chapter 5 verse 17 let's take a look at this tag team but jesus answered them and he said my father worketh hitherto and i work there's a tandem team they're working together they're both working together john chapter 4 verse 34 jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the work of him that sent me and to what finish his work he's going to execute he's going to perform what he started in you that's what he's working here we all think about god working miracles and praying some for somebody over the service or or they jump and they shout oh wait there's god working no god's working in you too just let go let god have his wonderful way let him have his way stop saying no i don't want you to do that get your hands off of me get your hands off my heart don't you be telling me let him work in you the bible says it's his good pleasure to work in you don't be stubborn just remain confident it's the living word oh to be able to feel him speak to you you're blessed when you feel that brother john what do i do a lot of people are saying things that are wrong just remain confident doesn't matter what they say the living word is still here in the midst of all the confusion some are saying here's christ look at me some are saying there is christ go there you don't have to go chasing christ in another direction because that ain't the type of god that we serve don't matter if you're on an island it don't matter where you're at the living word is amongst us if you believe how many times have you felt in your heart when you're away from this church and you're driving or you're at home or something and you feel oh god's with me how many's ever felt that and you just knew it yeah yeah how many times did you come to church and wonder where god was at what's going on what's going on because you start put other things in in there to make you have to prove that god is here why can't the god that was with you alone be with you here what about that well i got all these obstacles all these people they're bothering me all these spirits you know what get your eyes on jesus because he's going to prepare a table in the presence of your enemies [Music] the living word is among us it's about us believing it enough to tap into it and say amen to every word of god luke chapter 17 you don't have to go chasing christ in another direction friends he is here yes he is among us he said i will never leave you i will never forsake you luke chapter 17 verse 22 and he said unto his disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man you shall not see it and they shall say unto you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them why not why not because the the kingdom of god cometh not with observation you notice when when you hear about some amazing thing that happened catches your attention that you like so much about it is the outward appearance of the manifestation where we should be looking for the nature change something that isn't you seen outwardly the testimony happens inside yes it will become manifested eventually yes but the kingdom of god jesus says within you the living word is within us well i don't feel it hunger thirst for more you know if you give god a little bit of your time don't expect god to give you the word you give god your peanuts your pennies sometimes we don't give an offering you come to church without an offering sometimes it's physical monetarily and sometimes it's spiritual but he's worthy of an offering even kane gave it offering right wasn't right but he gave one right and when we don't give an offering we're putting ourselves a little bit lower than cain right right right god knows my heart he certainly does and he's telling you to give offering and give it cheerfully praise them cheerfully not just because the song leader says let's praise the lord right now do it because something inside you says i can't wait to get to the house of god can't wait to praise him can't wait to be at my family my brothers and sisters in christ can't wait to worship with him he inhabits the praises of his people we need to let go let god have his wonderful way john chapter 6 verse 29 says this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he have sent christ is going to finish the work he started just all he's got to do is believe believe he's here hear what he tells you to do and go do it and if you just leave here with instructions to go do one thing and you do it do you know that you probably have done most more than what you've done a lot of other times because we come here like suckers and leeches just trying to get information how about a personal relationship how about i just i want to hear from god oh my i'm only halfway through but you know there's 24 hours in a day amen christ is going to finish the work that he started in you the bible says in isaiah 55 verse 11 so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper and if in the thing wherein two i sent it god will not be mocked he would not be laughed at on the day of judgment there will be one word that he spoke that did not come back void now when you receive the word into your heart it will have to accomplish the purpose in which god sent it every promise in the book and every instruction on that day of judgment god will have a perfect record what won't be perfect for a lot of people is they won't have perfect faith right that's true and if there's anything i would like to do is stir up your faith that the living word is amongst us we need to be working at building up our faith amen amen brother brown said it's going to take perfect faith to make a rapture can you say amen to that but how do we get it i wish the whole world could hear this you need a love relationship first before you ever get perfect faith there are certain things that god will give you faith to get healed god will give you faith to go somewhere to to to know something ahead of time god will do that but when it comes to spending eternity with god you need to have a love relationship first but you can't get a love relationship first until you do something else love produces faith we need love to get faith but we need something else before we get love what is that brother brandon made it real clear he said lay everything else aside until you get perfect love it's true so the thing that we have to do is start laying aside things that are in our way things that are bothering things that are gobbling up our time things that we think are our responsibilities what else would he want us to lay aside he wouldn't want us to lay a side church he wouldn't want us to lay aside reaching out loving trying working for the lord he wouldn't want us to lay that aside what does he want us to lay aside everything else till we get perfect love perfect love will produce a perfect faith and brother ben said it'll take perfect love to get you in there because nothing but perfect love was there so we have to literally manifest perfect love on this planet with jesus christ before he's going to give us perfect faith for a rapture how important is it this little statement lay everything aside till you get perfect love i wonder who's been even like trying to lay things aside right who's even interested in that right you know in other words the devil is coming trying to show you another way that you can get more love just listen to your favorite songs more try to enter into the worship a little bit more read your favor your favorite scriptures listen to your favorite tape no you actually have to do something you have to lay aside the things that in your life that's keeping god from giving you perfect love right amen because i'm telling you what you got in your life right now you wanted it you wanted what you got and now what god is saying you need to get rid of it you want my perfect love in you you want to better love your enemies you want to be laid on your life for one another you want to have to not worry about your life anymore then you need to give up what you wanted at one time i'm telling you god is speaking god is speaking there is no other way there's no other way to make a rapture [Music] i know this doesn't make you feel good right this is the remedy this is the remedy god is among us he's the potter we're the clay it's okay for him to say lay it aside put it all down put me first brother brandon said in the message the way to have fellowship how many wants to know the way to have fellowship brother brandon says well you say what good would it do to have faith brother brahm says faith can sign my pardon sure that's value in faith he says don't be wary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first for love produces faith perfect love he says get it perfect love cast out all fear in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said that's what we must have perfect faith to make the perfect word of god perform perfectly that is an amazing quote i wish i just read that and don't say anything else the whole service that's what we must have perfect faith to make the perfect word of god perform perfectly that's it we must believe it without a shadow of a doubt we must believe more saints that the living word is among us when i say that not just here at the pulpit it may spring forth from the pulpit but it's coming to your heart and you have a choice at that matter to believe it perfectly or to believe it half-heartedly or to go home and say well pray about it but it won't perform in you until you believe it perfectly that's what brother branham was telling us god cannot lie it's impossible for god to lie and he's never failed once so always the missing ingredient is believing it now we can't force ourselves to believe but we can't force ourselves to get serious with god i've had it with this flesh i'm done i'm going to take god at his word i'm going to say amen i'm going to have the right attitude about it i'm going to move forward with god i'm going to worship if he tells me to worship i'm going to reach out if he tells me to reach out i'm going to move forward and this shows god you're serious with the word and we're gonna have to stay in together because there's no way that we can finish this so we're just gonna maybe do a part two some other time there's just way too much to try to ramp in believe that he's among the saints believe he's among you what was brother brahm saying when he said if there's only one going to make it in the city you believe you're that one he's saying believe the living word is among you i don't know where my brothers and sisters i don't even know why i don't but i know that i am going to believe that he speaks to me and it don't stop there i'm not going to say i'm not going to cry because he spoke to me and stop how often we do that we feel his presence we cry because of presence we know it's him and we feel good enough because we entered into his presence but that's just the first step we've got to hear what he tells what he's speaking to us and then we've got to go do it but brother john i think when that happens he's just he's just trying to just bless me with his presence i believe that's true sometimes but brother brahm told us you stay there and you wait he wants to speak something to you he has so many things to say do you ever get with somebody and they just got so many things on their minds going on god has a lot of things he wants to speak to us just want to hear him we gotta want to hear him amen let's stand together god bless you let's worship this lord and some courses amen let's sing he is here sing it like you believe it he is [Music] here amen he is here holy holy i will bless his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name is here you can touch him and you'll
