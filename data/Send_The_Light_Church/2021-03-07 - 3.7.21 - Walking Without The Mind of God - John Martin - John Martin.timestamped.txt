[33:11] that we could have is he promised to
[33:13] fill us if we just hunger
[33:15] amen amen let's look to the lord in a
[33:18] word of prayer
[33:20] our gracious heavenly father we thank
[33:22] you that you have
[33:24] kept these doors open today and we can
[33:27] gather together and worship you
[33:29] praise you to express our love to you in
[33:32] song and chorus and
[33:34] lord to express our love to you in your
[33:37] word
[33:38] by receiving it into our hearts by by
[33:40] rejoicing in it and
[33:42] lord we as mere humans lord just
[33:46] were incapable of providing a food
[33:50] for your bride only you can do that
[33:54] and only you can make it known
[33:58] and we're not able to turn the button to
[34:00] make revelation
[34:02] pour out upon us but oh god we're
[34:05] humbling ourself before you
[34:06] you said you'd give grace to the humble
[34:09] and we're
[34:10] humbling ourself before in asking that
[34:12] you would come down
[34:13] this morning by a way of revelation
[34:17] and reveal the word to us that we would
[34:19] hear give us those
[34:20] ears to hear what the spirit is saying
[34:23] to us
[34:24] lift us up into that heavenly realm lord
[34:27] let us
[34:28] walk out of service today mourn your
[34:30] image mourn your likeness
[34:33] continuing the work of the lord that you
[34:35] have for us until you would call us
[34:37] we thank you for these things ask your
[34:39] blessings on all the word
[34:42] that we would hear today for we give you
[34:44] praise in jesus precious name
[34:46] amen amen turn with me if you were to
[34:49] the book of ephesians
[34:51] i got thinking this morning that every
[34:54] one of us
[34:56] on he in the service today
[35:01] need more of god
[35:04] and how that came to me was that god
[35:08] does
[35:08] not take us until we're most ready
[35:12] so that means there must be more of god
[35:15] for us
[35:16] isn't that encouraging amen amen
[35:18] ephesians chapter 4 starting with verse
[35:20] number 17
[35:22] this i say therefore and testify
[35:25] in the lord that ye hence for forth
[35:29] walk not as other gentiles walk in the
[35:32] vanity
[35:33] of their mind having the understanding
[35:37] darkened being alien and
[35:39] alienated from the life of god through
[35:41] the ignorance that is in them
[35:43] because of the blindness of their heart
[35:46] who being past feeling have given
[35:47] themselves over until lasciviousness
[35:50] to walk to work all uncleanness
[35:54] with greediness amen but ye have not so
[35:57] learned christ amen god bless you may be
[36:00] seated
[36:02] um in this little series
[36:05] of walking with god last service we
[36:10] entitled the message walking with the
[36:11] mind of god and
[36:13] and today we want to title this message
[36:15] walking without the mind of god
[36:20] well praise the lord brother john
[36:22] [Laughter]
[36:24] that's okay i've been alone before i can
[36:26] do it again
[36:29] um last service we made mention of three
[36:32] minds god's
[36:33] mind satan's mind and man's mind and
[36:37] actually we learned that satan's mind
[36:40] is this mind that we're born with
[36:43] by nature by default it's it's similar
[36:46] in nature
[36:47] just like in revelations chapter 13
[36:49] verse 18 here is wisdom
[36:51] let him that have understanding count
[36:53] the number of the beast for it is the
[36:54] number of a man
[36:56] right same as the beast number of man
[36:59] and just like the three types of
[37:02] believers there's believers unbelievers
[37:03] and mate believers
[37:04] the scriptures teach us that the mate
[37:06] believers end up at the same place that
[37:08] the unbelievers
[37:09] end up amen just like the unprofitable
[37:13] servant he was a servant
[37:15] he was still a servant but he was
[37:17] unprofitable
[37:19] and for the kingdom he was unprofitable
[37:22] for the kingdom so he doesn't make the
[37:24] rapture
[37:24] all right so it's it's it's important
[37:27] not just to be a servant
[37:29] of god but to be profitable for the
[37:30] kingdom amen
[37:33] and most people think that there are
[37:35] three ways there's god's
[37:37] religious way and speaking of the
[37:39] worldly way of thinking here
[37:41] which that's
[37:45] satan god's religious way
[37:50] is is uh is how it is one way that most
[37:53] people think
[37:55] and it's it's very religious but they
[37:57] don't really realize that satan is also
[37:59] religious so
[38:01] that they're tricked in that way but
[38:02] then there's also satan's way which
[38:05] is horrifying and evil and tormenting
[38:07] and they they they look at it as an
[38:10] extreme but
[38:10] not not knowing again that there is a
[38:13] side of jesus that's very tricky
[38:17] very very religious and then there's
[38:20] their own way
[38:21] of thinking their own mind which they're
[38:24] right in their own eyes
[38:27] uh in other words the
[38:30] the extreme of of of of of
[38:33] god being real religious where you don't
[38:35] need to do that we already know satan is
[38:37] it's real real horrifying we don't do
[38:39] that and in man's mind he's got a
[38:41] balance and everything he sees
[38:42] everything correctly so he's
[38:44] he's right in his own eyes and that's
[38:46] the way the majority
[38:47] of the world functions and that's why
[38:50] it's hard for them to come to church
[38:52] and hear a pure word and say yes that is
[38:55] really the right way
[38:56] amen now one of those
[39:00] has a greater influence on man
[39:04] either satan's way satan's mind or god's
[39:08] mind
[39:08] amen it's going to have a greater
[39:09] influence
[39:11] on man if we do not
[39:15] labor to crucify our flesh
[39:19] our our our first nature die out daily
[39:22] to our way of thinking we'll never walk
[39:25] with the mind of the lord it isn't i'm
[39:29] walking with the mind of the lord ever
[39:31] since i got baptized
[39:34] i mean if you just look just look the
[39:35] past week you'll know
[39:37] you're about to see that there is times
[39:38] in your week that it wasn't the mind of
[39:41] the lord
[39:43] so it requires what jesus taught us
[39:46] to die daily it takes a constant effort
[39:51] to not walk in the vanity of our mind
[39:53] amen
[39:55] i remember living
[39:59] completely in the world at one time in
[40:01] my life i was wearing as i've made
[40:03] mention before
[40:05] pink bell-bottom pants
[40:08] having long hair and i thought i was so
[40:12] cool
[40:15] one time i prepared for weeks to play in
[40:18] our school gong show
[40:20] there's the three of us in the group and
[40:21] there's guitar and a
[40:23] female singer and we were just gonna
[40:26] but we got gunged we talk about vein
[40:32] i remember growing marijuana from seeds
[40:36] planted them right next to my grandma's
[40:38] plants in the living room thinking that
[40:39] nobody would ever know
[40:44] i remember being a businessman selling
[40:47] it
[40:50] remember playing hockey and become an
[40:52] assistant captain
[40:56] remember making these 16 foot long
[41:00] bat boards and i mean they were heavy it
[41:02] took like three people to carry them out
[41:04] onto our pond
[41:06] just wanting to impress
[41:10] everybody that that was around me
[41:15] now you know i didn't go around saying
[41:17] look at me
[41:18] but that desire nobody else on the whole
[41:21] lake built boards like i did
[41:26] i remember saving pounds and pounds of
[41:29] old coins
[41:32] i'm talking about the vanity of my own
[41:35] mind
[41:38] i had endless music collections
[41:41] i built a raft to float around the lake
[41:45] i thought that would be so cool as a kid
[41:47] now
[41:48] that's a cool thing
[41:52] i remember tearing our our neighbor's
[41:54] garage down block by block because i
[41:56] didn't want him to build it it was right
[41:58] across the street and i didn't want it
[41:59] to be there
[42:02] i've done a lot of vain things in life
[42:04] while walking in the vanity of my mind
[42:10] i really wanted to be a doctor i started
[42:12] going to college for it
[42:14] but the lord had other plans in his mind
[42:17] for me until this day
[42:21] when everyone's asleep in our house i
[42:24] will walk downstairs
[42:26] every day and pull out those
[42:30] plastic latex gloves from the box take
[42:32] two of them out of it
[42:34] and i will put those on you know they
[42:37] start to stretch them
[42:39] make sure they go every morning
[42:43] anne's asleep cheryl's asleep i'll put
[42:46] those on
[42:48] to feel the latex around my skin
[42:53] oh yeah having
[43:02] having that glove
[43:04] [Music]
[43:06] between my hand but having that glob
[43:09] between my hand and the germs
[43:11] oh yeah when that's done i'll walk
[43:14] outside and get the ash bucket and clean
[43:16] the ashes out of the furnace
[43:18] out of the fireplace that's what i do
[43:20] with my gloves
[43:25] because those ashes when you go to clean
[43:27] the glass you know they will eat your
[43:28] hand
[43:32] our minds can get corrupted or taken
[43:35] over by simply not
[43:37] holding ourselves accountable to what we
[43:40] think we think if we
[43:43] think it it's okay that's the most
[43:46] dangerous thing to think
[43:48] amen if we get lazy in our minds and
[43:50] don't try the spirit or our thoughts
[43:52] that come to us
[43:53] will end up working vanity in our own
[43:56] minds
[43:58] it doesn't take much not being sober or
[44:01] vigilant or being
[44:02] spiritually relaxed or lazy
[44:06] or in a state of always thinking you're
[44:08] right about things
[44:10] and we end up waking up walking
[44:13] in the vanity of a carnal mind amen
[44:18] we let we read last service about the
[44:20] danger walking
[44:22] in our carnal mind romans chapter 8
[44:24] verse 7
[44:26] you simply not walking with god when
[44:28] you're walking
[44:30] in a carnal mindset because the carnal
[44:32] mind is enmity against god
[44:34] for it is not subject to the law of god
[44:36] neither indeed can be
[44:37] so then they that are in the flesh they
[44:39] cannot even please
[44:41] god amen what we're doing is we're
[44:43] slamming the door on god's
[44:45] face when you're in a carnal mindset
[44:50] there's no connection there right amen
[44:53] yeah god is able to just knock you down
[44:57] get you off your high horse anytime he
[44:58] wants to but his nature is not to do
[45:01] that
[45:02] you notice he did that once to paul
[45:07] paul didn't go back out in the world and
[45:08] say well you got if you really love me
[45:10] you got to do it again
[45:12] it comes time that we got to make a
[45:13] decision for our lives
[45:16] and every day we have a decision to let
[45:18] our mind be the mind of christ or to
[45:20] to be carnal
[45:25] it happens much easier to us than we
[45:28] realize
[45:30] look what happened to abraham and sarah
[45:33] satan provided an easier way for them to
[45:35] get what they wanted
[45:39] they used hagar instead and look at the
[45:41] problems it caused
[45:43] look what happened to lot satan provided
[45:46] an
[45:46] easier way for lot he chose
[45:50] the well-watered plains of jordan
[45:53] because it was
[45:53] easier for him it's more enticing for
[45:57] him
[45:58] look what happened to balaam satan
[46:00] provided an easier way to make some
[46:03] money
[46:04] but he ended up corrupting the whole
[46:05] church that's right
[46:08] look how satan corrupted the the mind of
[46:11] naaman
[46:12] from the simplicity of just following
[46:14] god's word come to church
[46:15] hear god's word this is what god wants
[46:17] you to do
[46:18] he said in second kings chapter 5 verse
[46:21] 12 are not
[46:22] abner and far far rivers of damascus
[46:26] better than all the waters of israel
[46:31] may i not wash in them and be clean
[46:35] so he turned and went
[46:38] out of church in a rage
[46:43] because the word that was presented to
[46:45] him he didn't like
[46:47] amen thank god he had a servant that
[46:50] restored him
[46:50] amen walking without the mind of god
[46:55] will always lead us to trouble
[46:59] look what happened to eve satan provided
[47:02] an easier way for her to get what she
[47:04] wanted
[47:06] and satan is scheming up easier ways for
[47:09] you to get what you want
[47:12] that's why if you do
[47:15] as much as you can as hard as you can to
[47:18] say the lord is my shepherd i shall not
[47:20] want
[47:20] and to really exercise that right
[47:24] because if there's no want satan can't
[47:26] get to you
[47:27] amen he gets to you through your want
[47:33] he wants to let you know that you don't
[47:35] have to walk the straight and narrow
[47:37] path the harder way
[47:39] he's always presenting an easier way to
[47:41] be the bride
[47:42] all right that's true that's why you
[47:45] know i'm bright just by
[47:46] you know because i believe
[47:50] you know and it it it's that's an easy
[47:52] way you know you don't gotta do nothing
[47:57] second corinthians chapter 11 verse two
[48:02] second corinthians chapter one verse two
[48:06] for i am jealous over you with a godly
[48:10] jealousy
[48:11] for i've espoused you to one husband
[48:14] that i may present
[48:16] you as a chaste virgin to christ
[48:20] we must come into the image of christ to
[48:23] marry him
[48:24] amen now brother branham did say
[48:30] that in one place what makes the bride
[48:33] a virgin is that she's not in a
[48:36] denomination a man-made system
[48:37] she's separated from that
[48:42] but it's not just being in a church that
[48:44] isn't a denominational church
[48:46] because remember even though this is a
[48:50] church
[48:50] and we have a belief system inside every
[48:53] church there's three types of believers
[48:55] and you yourself are a church
[48:58] amen so you have to become a chaste
[49:01] virgin
[49:01] to separate from your mind your thoughts
[49:04] your ideas
[49:05] and stay fully with the word amen
[49:09] amen but i fear lest by any means
[49:13] as the serpent begot eve in other words
[49:15] satan will try any means to beguile you
[49:19] but i fear lest by any means as the
[49:21] serpent begot eve through his subtility
[49:24] so your minds notice where it happens
[49:27] so your mind should be corrupted from
[49:29] the simplicity
[49:31] that's in christ amen
[49:35] cropped your minds he's out there
[49:37] wanting to corrupt
[49:38] the way that you think
[49:42] satan will use any means to get you away
[49:44] from walking with the mind of god
[49:46] which is simply obeying what the word
[49:50] says
[49:52] just obey what the word says amen why do
[49:55] you
[49:56] why do you think satan gets you so busy
[49:59] that you don't got time to read
[50:03] and sometimes you know we're so busy
[50:06] that we listen to a tape when we're
[50:08] always doing something else
[50:13] well at least i'm listening well that's
[50:15] good that works for
[50:17] a short time right but if you don't have
[50:20] an
[50:21] interest god i want my life to change
[50:23] and i need you to speak to me about what
[50:24] you want me to change
[50:27] i mean because that's it there's two
[50:29] there's two things that we
[50:30] the bride should be doing number one
[50:33] coming into his image
[50:34] amen amen by receiving all the word
[50:40] we need to be helping our brother come
[50:42] into the same image
[50:44] that was a great commission amen
[50:47] that's it that's that but we want the
[50:50] the
[50:50] the thing that entertains us about the
[50:53] message
[50:58] because there's no change
[51:03] but this message god sent a message
[51:07] to get us in his image right
[51:11] this message gets us in his image
[51:14] not knowledge
[51:18] it makes us gives us the character if we
[51:22] follow it
[51:23] the character of christ
[51:27] and the burden for our brother soul
[51:31] that's his message you get outside of
[51:33] that now i
[51:35] i'm not saying that there's not
[51:37] wonderful and beautiful things that god
[51:40] doesn't give us outside of it because he
[51:42] does right
[51:43] he does he does but remember he said the
[51:47] healing was just the bait
[51:49] god didn't god really is not interested
[51:51] in healing our bodies he's interested in
[51:53] healing our souls
[51:57] i'm not saying god don't care about our
[51:59] bodies he does
[52:01] but look for us to care about the
[52:03] natural things and put spiritual things
[52:05] on such a back burner is not where god
[52:07] is at
[52:18] god doesn't want to see us suffer
[52:20] naturally
[52:23] go through hardships he doesn't but in
[52:26] the
[52:26] aspect if they produce his will
[52:30] like it please the father to bruise
[52:32] jesus
[52:34] if it produces the long-term goal which
[52:37] is to get his
[52:38] his whole family born again new nature
[52:41] ready for the rapture coming into heaven
[52:44] this is the goal of god
[52:45] it will never change
[52:50] we got it the problem is is we're not
[52:53] there
[52:54] we've been there we get out of there and
[52:56] then we get caught up in the vanity of
[52:58] our own mind amen
[53:01] verse 4 for he
[53:04] that cometh preaching another jesus
[53:08] whom we have not preached or if you
[53:11] receive another spirit
[53:14] which ye have not received or another
[53:17] gospel
[53:18] which you have not accepted he might
[53:22] bear with him the simplicity is stay
[53:26] with the word
[53:27] that god has given you stay with
[53:31] it amen don't let satan entice you to an
[53:34] easier way to serve god with another
[53:37] spirit another gospel another jesus
[53:39] another person's opinion about things
[53:43] develop the reality that god is speaking
[53:47] to your heart
[53:48] in church you know we become
[53:52] we have lost the fear of the lord this
[53:55] is why things got out of order in our
[53:56] church
[54:00] because we don't think we need the fear
[54:02] of god when we come into church
[54:06] pick and choose what we want to take
[54:08] like some smorgasbord
[54:11] what about finding out where you're at
[54:15] how god thinks about you the only way
[54:17] that's ever going to happen
[54:18] is you literally have to lay your heart
[54:20] there and say god
[54:22] speak to my conscience
[54:28] but sometimes our conscience becomes so
[54:30] hard that we got to do what the prophet
[54:32] said pinch it
[54:34] get it get it moving
[54:39] galatians chapter 1 verse 6
[54:42] i marvel that ye are so s soon
[54:46] removed from him that called you
[54:51] into the grace of christ unto
[54:54] another gospel see how soon we can be
[54:57] moved you know up and down people are up
[55:00] and down
[55:01] on fire quit on fire
[55:04] quit it's not the holy ghost friends
[55:11] god does not want us so soon removed
[55:16] to another gospel but paul making it
[55:19] real clear to the galatians which is
[55:21] not another but there be some that
[55:23] trouble you and would
[55:25] pervert the gospel of christ now that
[55:28] word
[55:28] pervert it means to change from one
[55:30] nature to another
[55:34] in other words you started on the
[55:36] straight narrow path you've been
[55:38] shown the right way to walk
[55:41] but then your nature begins to
[55:44] shift towards the easier way the broad
[55:47] way
[55:48] right the the way that
[55:51] leads to destruction right amen
[55:54] of doing things verse 8 but though we
[55:59] though we or an angel we could say right
[56:03] here though
[56:04] brother bruce or i amen or an angel from
[56:08] heaven preach
[56:09] any other gospel unto you than that
[56:12] which ye
[56:13] than which we have preached unto you let
[56:16] him
[56:17] be accursed amen
[56:20] now that's pretty strong
[56:24] that isn't just you know pat him on the
[56:26] back
[56:27] and say it's okay
[56:31] accursed
[56:34] how important is the word well
[56:38] let's read verse nine as we
[56:41] said before so i now i say
[56:45] again if any man preach any other
[56:48] gospel unto you then that
[56:52] ye have received let him
[56:56] be accursed this very subject
[56:59] came up in heaven when brother branham
[57:01] went beyond the curtain of time
[57:06] is paul going to make it yeah paul make
[57:08] it
[57:10] well wow that's good because i preached
[57:13] the same thing paul preached
[57:15] we've got to stay with the word of god
[57:18] amen
[57:22] see satan knows satan knows that there's
[57:25] nobody going to stand behind this pulpit
[57:29] and and get you to get off the mark
[57:34] so he works in your personal life right
[57:36] it's true
[57:37] he entices you with an easier way in
[57:40] your personal life
[57:42] that you can come to church and not even
[57:45] be prepared
[57:50] we need to be careful about what we say
[57:52] to others
[57:53] and what we perceive that others are
[57:55] saying to us
[57:58] we don't want to be nice to a spirit
[57:59] that's trying to pervert us
[58:01] from walking in the carnality of our
[58:05] minds amen
[58:06] verse 10 for do i now persuade men or
[58:09] god
[58:10] or do i seek to please men for if i yet
[58:13] please men i should not be the servant
[58:16] of christ
[58:18] satan is always trying to get us walk in
[58:20] the vanity of our mind
[58:22] that's right that's a place where we're
[58:25] always
[58:25] right in our own eyes the place where
[58:28] we fulfill the desires of the flesh and
[58:31] paul talked about it in ephesians
[58:33] chapter 2 verse 3
[58:34] among whom also we've all had our
[58:37] conversations in times past and the
[58:39] lusts of the flesh fulfilling the
[58:40] desires of the flesh and the mind and
[58:42] we're by nature the children of wrath as
[58:44] others
[58:45] but god who's rich in mercy for his
[58:47] great love with he loved us even when we
[58:49] were dead
[58:50] and our sins have quickened us together
[58:53] with christ see it it's the quickening
[58:56] that snaps us out of that
[58:58] yes and puts us in the right place
[59:02] but it's not just about our salvation
[59:04] it's about our walk with god
[59:08] and has raised us up together and made
[59:10] us to sit together
[59:11] in heavenly places see
[59:14] most carnal way of thinking is
[59:18] i'm saved that's all that matters
[59:21] everything else is just do's and don'ts
[59:23] and rules and not really that necessary
[59:26] to follow
[59:26] but what you're doing is you're
[59:28] describing your attitude
[59:30] about the walk that god wants to have
[59:32] with you
[59:35] and look this message for the bride
[59:38] isn't for everybody
[59:41] it is okay for those that do not want to
[59:45] walk this word
[59:46] it's okay amen god isn't gonna force
[59:50] anything
[59:51] amen but it's important for us to
[59:53] understand
[59:54] we cannot be bride we cannot be
[59:56] predestined
[59:57] and continue to walk in the carnality of
[59:59] our mind amen
[1:00:01] it just ain't gonna work
[1:00:07] by default by nature that we're born
[1:00:10] with
[1:00:10] it's so easy to sit back into fulfilling
[1:00:14] the desires of our flesh and of our mind
[1:00:18] and that's why jesus warned us that we
[1:00:20] need to be
[1:00:24] to put forth the effort to deny yourself
[1:00:28] to pick up a cross daily
[1:00:32] to prepare for god like we would for
[1:00:36] church
[1:00:37] every single day even though we're not
[1:00:40] going to church
[1:00:41] i'm preparing for god amen i'm dying i'm
[1:00:44] denying my will lord
[1:00:45] may your will be done in your life today
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:49] this i say and testify in the lord that
[1:00:52] he henceforth
[1:00:54] walk not as other gentiles walk in the
[1:00:58] vanity
[1:00:59] of their mind that word vanity
[1:01:04] it means uselessness
[1:01:08] temporary not lasting
[1:01:12] not during and not permanent
[1:01:16] that's what vanity means think about all
[1:01:19] the things that you do
[1:01:22] that are temporal that you labor for
[1:01:26] that you exercise for
[1:01:30] now what god has given us he has given
[1:01:32] us a kingdom that cannot be moved
[1:01:34] amen it's not temporal it's lasting amen
[1:01:39] but we live in this world we have to
[1:01:41] deal with the things of the world but
[1:01:42] we're your desires
[1:01:46] are you hunting for more than you want i
[1:01:48] mean more than you need
[1:01:53] when we're walking with the mind of god
[1:01:55] we're setting our affections on things
[1:01:57] above
[1:01:59] permanent things when we're walking
[1:02:02] without the mind of god
[1:02:03] our thoughts become more vain
[1:02:07] and more set more on temporal things
[1:02:12] when we look at solomon who who was
[1:02:15] known for his wisdom
[1:02:17] he ultimately had the highest form
[1:02:20] of intelligence from god in ecclesiastes
[1:02:24] chapter 1
[1:02:25] verse 2 the man said vanity of vanity
[1:02:28] saith the preacher
[1:02:30] vanity of vanities all is
[1:02:33] vanity made it real clear
[1:02:37] verse 14 he said i have seen all the
[1:02:41] works
[1:02:41] that are done under the sun and behold
[1:02:44] all
[1:02:45] is vanity and vexation of spirit
[1:02:49] amen here's a man that experienced it
[1:02:52] all
[1:02:53] i wrote down a few of the things that he
[1:02:55] did solomon did great works
[1:02:57] he built houses he planted vineyards he
[1:03:00] made gardens orchard
[1:03:02] greenhouses he planted trees of all corn
[1:03:05] all kinds of fruits he dug ponds
[1:03:08] what if he had fountains in them he
[1:03:11] engineered sprinkler systems irrigation
[1:03:13] systems
[1:03:14] he had servants and maids and he
[1:03:16] gathered silver and gold
[1:03:17] and treasures from all over the world he
[1:03:20] had all kinds of singing groups and
[1:03:22] orchestras
[1:03:24] and he concluded that all the things
[1:03:27] that was in his mind
[1:03:28] to do was all vanity
[1:03:35] and he encouraged us don't set your
[1:03:38] things
[1:03:39] on temporal things solomon did not
[1:03:42] encourage us
[1:03:43] to walk as other gentiles walk in the
[1:03:45] vanity of their own mind he did not
[1:03:47] encourage us to do the things that he
[1:03:48] did
[1:03:55] not on the contrary like jesus said
[1:03:59] after all these things do the gentiles
[1:04:01] seek
[1:04:02] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[1:04:05] his righteousness
[1:04:06] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:04:10] you
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:16] it's amazing what happens when you put
[1:04:18] god first
[1:04:19] that's what solomon really did he just
[1:04:22] wanted to know
[1:04:23] how he could do the job that god gave
[1:04:26] him to do
[1:04:27] give him what it took to do the job amen
[1:04:29] and god looked at that
[1:04:30] this is not normal it's not normal
[1:04:33] you're not asking for something for you
[1:04:37] you're asking for something to help you
[1:04:38] with the purpose that i've called you
[1:04:40] for
[1:04:41] because your heart is right because your
[1:04:42] attitude is right i'm going to give you
[1:04:44] what you asked for and more
[1:04:46] right what an example seek ye first the
[1:04:48] kingdom
[1:04:49] and all other things shall be added unto
[1:04:51] you
[1:04:52] solomon told us to seek more permanent
[1:04:55] things god's word is permanent
[1:04:57] amen without the revelation
[1:05:00] of his word we are in darkness
[1:05:03] that's what we read ecclesiastes chapter
[1:05:06] 11 verse 1
[1:05:08] solomon now after you have in all this
[1:05:10] experience he's pointing us
[1:05:12] to the mind of christ he said cast thy
[1:05:15] bread
[1:05:16] upon the waters
[1:05:19] for thou shalt find it after many days
[1:05:22] well brother john you just gave me
[1:05:24] another job to do no i didn't it god did
[1:05:28] you can cast it out look for the easier
[1:05:30] way or you can start getting serious
[1:05:32] about the word of god
[1:05:33] this is the kingdom of god when you cast
[1:05:35] your bread upon the water
[1:05:36] amen give a portion to seven and also to
[1:05:40] eight
[1:05:41] for thou knowest what covet
[1:05:44] shall come upon the face of the earth
[1:05:48] i mean it's only getting worse
[1:05:51] say there's a little relief that comes
[1:05:53] from this thing maybe there is i don't
[1:05:55] know
[1:05:56] but i'm telling you it's going downhill
[1:05:58] look at all the
[1:06:00] stuff that's happening
[1:06:04] word teaches us that the most important
[1:06:06] things in life
[1:06:07] are saving them that are lost
[1:06:11] and getting those who are saved to the
[1:06:14] image of christ
[1:06:15] that's it those are the most important
[1:06:16] things
[1:06:19] solomon concluded after all his many
[1:06:22] years of research
[1:06:25] into life for us to understand clearly
[1:06:28] what's the most important things and he
[1:06:29] he start i want to start with this in
[1:06:31] ecclesiastes chapter 12
[1:06:33] verse 7
[1:06:37] he says then shall the dust return to
[1:06:39] the earth as it was
[1:06:40] and the spirit shall return unto god who
[1:06:43] gave it
[1:06:45] vanity of vanities say at the preacher
[1:06:48] all
[1:06:48] is value this is the end of the book so
[1:06:50] he starts off
[1:06:52] with giving that message at the
[1:06:54] beginning and he's saying it at the end
[1:06:57] and moreover because the preacher was
[1:06:59] wise he still taught the people
[1:07:01] knowledge
[1:07:02] yay he gave good heed and sought out and
[1:07:06] set
[1:07:06] in order many proverbs the preacher
[1:07:09] sought to find out
[1:07:10] acceptable words that which was written
[1:07:13] was
[1:07:14] upright and even words of truth the
[1:07:16] words of the wise are as
[1:07:19] gourds and as nails fastened by the
[1:07:21] masters of assembly
[1:07:23] which are given from one shepherd and
[1:07:26] further
[1:07:26] by these my son be admonished
[1:07:30] of making many books there is no end
[1:07:32] ain't that the truth
[1:07:35] just get done you want to make another
[1:07:37] one we got more books
[1:07:39] no end and much studying is weariness of
[1:07:43] the flesh
[1:07:45] that is the truth but let us hear the
[1:07:47] conclusion
[1:07:48] of the whole manner what in the world we
[1:07:51] come to church for
[1:07:53] fear god and keep his commandments
[1:07:56] for this is the whole duty of man amen
[1:08:00] we need the mind of god in order
[1:08:03] to keep his commandments otherwise we're
[1:08:06] going to let
[1:08:07] satan take talk us out of it
[1:08:12] amen fear god keep his commandment this
[1:08:15] sounds like a permanent thing
[1:08:21] for god shall bring every work into
[1:08:22] judgment every secret thing whether it's
[1:08:24] to be good or whether it be evil
[1:08:27] walking without the mind of god in
[1:08:29] simplicity is all vanity
[1:08:31] it's vain and often times we walk in
[1:08:35] this world without
[1:08:37] the mind of god amen we can even walk
[1:08:40] right into church
[1:08:41] without the mind of god and not even
[1:08:43] recognize it amen
[1:08:46] which could make our church experience
[1:08:48] also in vain
[1:08:50] temporal useless meaningless
[1:08:55] especially when you walk in the church
[1:08:56] and say well i didn't get what i wanted
[1:08:59] right
[1:09:03] hey let's get this thing over with i got
[1:09:05] things to do today
[1:09:07] you're making church temporal with an
[1:09:10] attitude that's in vain
[1:09:13] a carnal mindset amen
[1:09:17] whoa unto me ever to come into a church
[1:09:21] when somebody's preaching
[1:09:22] and to say that i didn't meet god
[1:09:26] woe unto me i would never do that
[1:09:33] there's a lot of things that could be
[1:09:34] vain about church
[1:09:37] not caring about preparation humbling
[1:09:39] ourselves before the word
[1:09:41] remember when the word fell on any
[1:09:45] ground
[1:09:45] except good ground it was in vain
[1:09:49] right there were four types of ground
[1:09:51] four types of heart
[1:09:52] condition that we can have a heart
[1:09:56] condition
[1:09:57] that could be in vain praying
[1:10:00] repetitious prayers are in vain
[1:10:04] it's vain to come to church without
[1:10:05] wanting to know where you're really
[1:10:07] at with god because god wants you to
[1:10:10] know
[1:10:12] what you don't know
[1:10:15] why because you may have been walking as
[1:10:19] other gentiles have been walking
[1:10:20] in the vanity of their own mind that
[1:10:22] week
[1:10:24] it's vain to come to church without
[1:10:26] willing to suffer to see yourself
[1:10:28] change in other words you're looking for
[1:10:31] the easier way
[1:10:31] just give me some head knowledge give me
[1:10:33] something i never heard before something
[1:10:35] i never learned before
[1:10:36] and now i i can feel like i i know god
[1:10:39] more
[1:10:41] but if you're not living it more you
[1:10:44] really don't know it more
[1:10:45] amen
[1:10:50] it's vain to come to church and worship
[1:10:52] god in the vanity of your own mind
[1:10:55] jesus said in vain do they worship me
[1:10:58] the father seeketh such that will
[1:10:59] worship me in spirit and truth
[1:11:01] that don't happen and just exactly how
[1:11:03] you do it
[1:11:05] it's where the condition of your heart
[1:11:07] your mind is at
[1:11:09] when you're expressing i love you jesus
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:13] we could be sitting in church and it'd
[1:11:16] be in vain and not even realize it
[1:11:19] there's all this hounding about being
[1:11:21] prepared
[1:11:22] it's important amen amen i'm telling you
[1:11:26] if you were going to meet somebody very
[1:11:29] very special you would prepare for it
[1:11:40] jesus said hey i'm coming soon it's
[1:11:44] special
[1:11:45] get ready don't just say
[1:11:49] i know jesus is coming soon therefore
[1:11:51] i'm ready
[1:11:52] he said be ready be ready this message
[1:11:55] makes us ready
[1:11:57] it's vain to walk into church like other
[1:11:59] gentiles thinking
[1:12:01] how great they are
[1:12:05] luke chapter 22 verse 24. here's some
[1:12:08] some strife that happened in the church
[1:12:12] and there was also a strife among them
[1:12:16] which of them should be accounted the
[1:12:17] greatest and he said unto them now
[1:12:19] notice the words that jesus says here
[1:12:22] the kings of the gentiles
[1:12:25] exercise lordship over them
[1:12:28] and they that exercise authority upon
[1:12:30] them are called benefactors
[1:12:33] but ye shall not be
[1:12:37] so walk not
[1:12:40] as other gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:12:43] their mind
[1:12:45] having their understanding darkened
[1:12:49] being alienated from the life
[1:12:52] that is in god amen but he that is
[1:12:55] greatest among you
[1:12:57] let him be as the younger and he that is
[1:13:00] chief
[1:13:01] as he that does serve
[1:13:05] for whether it is greater he that says
[1:13:07] that me or he that serveth
[1:13:09] is not he that says that meat obviously
[1:13:13] but i among you as one that servant
[1:13:22] if we're not here as one that serveth
[1:13:24] our understanding is darkened
[1:13:28] if we're not living a life of serving
[1:13:31] the life
[1:13:32] of god is really not there because the
[1:13:34] life of god serves
[1:13:36] right how is it going to be different in
[1:13:38] you than
[1:13:39] it was in jesus amen
[1:13:43] well i just don't feel god has called me
[1:13:45] to you know bend down and wash
[1:13:47] somebody's feet
[1:13:50] hey if he did would you hear it
[1:13:59] how many feet have you washed this week
[1:14:04] how many of you served this week
[1:14:13] the mind of christ is so much different
[1:14:16] than our carnal mind
[1:14:21] carnality will always bring division in
[1:14:24] a church
[1:14:26] in a home in a business in a family
[1:14:31] when we're walking without the mind of
[1:14:32] god we open ourselves up to all sorts of
[1:14:35] carnal behaviors
[1:14:37] and when we're divided with christ we're
[1:14:40] actually we have a good chance of being
[1:14:44] causing division causing division among
[1:14:47] one another
[1:14:48] right amen because the spirit in us is
[1:14:51] not right
[1:14:53] first corinthians chapter 1 verse 12
[1:14:54] first corinthians chapter 1 verse 12
[1:14:57] now this i say that every one of you
[1:15:01] that sayeth i am a paul and i'm apollos
[1:15:04] i'm a
[1:15:04] cephas and i'm of christ is christ
[1:15:08] divided
[1:15:09] no way was paul crucified for you no way
[1:15:14] or were ye baptized in the name of paul
[1:15:15] no way
[1:15:19] so what is this i am of this and i'm of
[1:15:22] that and i like this church and i
[1:15:23] i like you know that church i like you
[1:15:26] know i like
[1:15:26] live streaming this other place over
[1:15:29] here
[1:15:34] now i beseech you brethren by the name
[1:15:36] of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:39] that ye all speak the same thing
[1:15:44] now this is the mind of christ right now
[1:15:47] to walk without this is to walk without
[1:15:53] the mind of christ that ye all speak the
[1:15:57] same thing that ye
[1:15:58] that there be no divisions among you and
[1:16:01] that ye be perfectly joined together
[1:16:03] in the same mind and having the same
[1:16:05] judgment
[1:16:07] amen makes it pretty clear
[1:16:10] amen what the mind of god is and when
[1:16:14] we're not walking with the mind of god
[1:16:15] we could care less with other people
[1:16:24] there should be a yearning in every one
[1:16:26] of us to be joined together perfectly
[1:16:29] we're the body of christ and if your
[1:16:31] heart's not there your heart's not right
[1:16:34] how you expect to become bride when the
[1:16:37] condition of the heart isn't right
[1:16:40] it's carnal galatians chapter 5 verse 14
[1:16:44] for all the laws fulfilled in one word
[1:16:46] even this that thou shalt love thy
[1:16:47] neighbor as thyself
[1:16:50] but if ye bite and devour one another
[1:16:54] take heed that you be not consumed one
[1:16:56] of another.
[1:16:57] this i say then walk in the spirit this
[1:17:00] is the mind of christ
[1:17:02] now and ye shall not fulfill
[1:17:07] the lust of the flesh that division that
[1:17:09] i'm right you're wrong
[1:17:11] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:17:13] the spirit against the flesh and these
[1:17:15] are contrary
[1:17:16] the one to another so that they cannot
[1:17:18] do the things
[1:17:19] that ye would
[1:17:23] there's very few people in this age that
[1:17:27] we're living in
[1:17:28] that are walking in the spirit amen
[1:17:34] there's talk about religion
[1:17:38] and there are people fill the churches
[1:17:42] but there are very few people walking in
[1:17:44] the spirit
[1:17:46] there's very few people are allowing
[1:17:48] this word
[1:17:50] to impregnate them
[1:17:56] imagine for a moment
[1:18:00] that you got hired in to a job
[1:18:04] and when you came in they told you what
[1:18:06] you were going to do
[1:18:07] you're going to do this and you're going
[1:18:09] to do this and this after you get it
[1:18:10] done
[1:18:11] there's no there's nothing more to do
[1:18:14] it's already done it don't need to be
[1:18:16] done again it don't
[1:18:18] need to be done the next day it's done
[1:18:21] now when you go into work you expect to
[1:18:24] do the next thing that they want you to
[1:18:26] do
[1:18:29] but satan wants us to think that you
[1:18:31] know once we're saved we're always saved
[1:18:33] and there's nothing more to do
[1:18:37] my god has many things to tell us
[1:18:41] but we got to have a heart to want it
[1:18:44] god i really want to be in your image
[1:18:45] i'm so sick of myself
[1:18:48] i'm my greatest enemy
[1:18:52] we got to want the word to pregnant us
[1:18:55] why
[1:18:56] so we can go live it when we leave here
[1:18:58] amen not just become a head knowledge
[1:19:01] in the message the invisible union of
[1:19:03] the bride brother brandon says
[1:19:04] that's what eve took she was pregnant
[1:19:07] with that kind of impregnation
[1:19:09] that's what the church is today now
[1:19:12] speaking of the worldly church
[1:19:13] by bible schools and intellectuals
[1:19:16] and look everyone disagreeing
[1:19:20] with the other what did we just read
[1:19:23] he said it's a big mess just exactly
[1:19:27] what the bible says of babylon
[1:19:30] impregnated with the wrong thing amen
[1:19:35] amen keep up with the joneses i'm better
[1:19:37] than this church i'm but this church is
[1:19:39] better than that church
[1:19:42] i like this brother brandon says the
[1:19:44] bride knows
[1:19:46] where she stands she is very few
[1:19:51] he says there won't be many saved just a
[1:19:54] very very very few right
[1:19:58] you say well there they said there's
[1:20:01] thousands
[1:20:02] brother ben says yes but they come up
[1:20:05] through
[1:20:05] 2 000 years too
[1:20:09] on every age where it come out of i want
[1:20:12] you to think about this
[1:20:13] brother branham taught us about this
[1:20:15] pyramid here
[1:20:17] and as you get closer to the top it gets
[1:20:20] more narrow
[1:20:21] you can feel a lot of people on faith
[1:20:25] but you can't cram all those people into
[1:20:28] that top
[1:20:32] so as each age came and went
[1:20:36] it became harder as god was building the
[1:20:38] building
[1:20:40] this is the hardest age of all ages to
[1:20:43] live the word
[1:20:45] because more word has been given amen
[1:20:48] you've got to get your mind off the
[1:20:49] carnality
[1:20:50] of just i believe and i'm saved i'm no
[1:20:54] this age is becoming his image this is
[1:20:57] the age where you can love your enemy
[1:20:59] you can lay down your life
[1:21:01] for everybody amen much harder to live
[1:21:04] this age
[1:21:05] that's why very few make it
[1:21:09] in the message to choosing of a bride
[1:21:10] the mark of the beast
[1:21:12] when she forms that world council of
[1:21:13] churches and she'll give birth
[1:21:15] to her son the antichrist now the other
[1:21:19] is impregnated by the word of god
[1:21:22] and we'll bring forth the body the
[1:21:25] finished
[1:21:26] body of jesus christ which is the bride
[1:21:29] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[1:21:33] let that sink in how many knows that
[1:21:37] a man and a woman is one
[1:21:41] the christ is one body and christ is one
[1:21:43] body the word
[1:21:45] and the bride will have to be the rest
[1:21:47] of that body
[1:21:48] and the two together makes the one body
[1:21:51] again
[1:21:52] like adam was at the beginning man his
[1:21:55] wife
[1:21:56] are one and now she
[1:21:59] the true bride is so
[1:22:02] listen to this is so sold out
[1:22:06] to him yes that she uses no mind
[1:22:10] of her own his mind of course
[1:22:13] is his will and his
[1:22:17] will is his word
[1:22:20] she becomes sold out to the word so now
[1:22:24] it's very important
[1:22:25] what that prophet said it's very
[1:22:27] important what that word says
[1:22:29] is very important now because she
[1:22:32] is sowed out to it she's become
[1:22:34] pregnated and
[1:22:35] she don't no longer carry the attitude
[1:22:38] well that's good for you but i'm going
[1:22:39] to serve god my way
[1:22:40] that's okay that is really
[1:22:44] okay if you're not bride but that is not
[1:22:47] the nature of the bride
[1:22:51] it's not the attitude of the bride
[1:22:56] in the message pergamos church age he
[1:22:59] says notice the harmony of the father
[1:23:01] and the son
[1:23:03] jesus never did anything until
[1:23:06] first shown him by the father and he
[1:23:08] gives john 5 19.
[1:23:10] now he said this harmony is now to exist
[1:23:15] between the groom and his bride
[1:23:18] he shows her his word of life i love
[1:23:22] that
[1:23:23] he shows her that's what happens at
[1:23:26] church
[1:23:27] come to church and we're hearing the
[1:23:29] word of life he shows
[1:23:31] it to her she receives it
[1:23:36] she never doubts it therefore nothing
[1:23:39] can harm her
[1:23:39] not even death for if the seed be
[1:23:43] planted
[1:23:44] the water will raise it up again now he
[1:23:47] said
[1:23:48] here is the secret of this
[1:23:51] the word is in the bride as it was in
[1:23:55] mary
[1:23:56] the bride has the mind of christ
[1:24:00] for she knows what he wants
[1:24:03] done with the word amen for she
[1:24:06] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:24:09] she has the mind of christ
[1:24:12] it's a reality that's why you just can't
[1:24:15] pick and choose what you want out of
[1:24:17] church
[1:24:17] or just say well church is over and i'm
[1:24:19] going to go do my own thing now
[1:24:20] hopefully when i go to church i'll get
[1:24:21] something
[1:24:22] of an experience with god no the
[1:24:23] experience what we what we want with god
[1:24:26] is that this word becomes
[1:24:27] impregnated in us and we can manifest it
[1:24:30] out to the world that means more than
[1:24:32] any experience you could have in church
[1:24:34] amen to better live this life out there
[1:24:37] is what god is looking for
[1:24:40] it's the secret of this whole thing
[1:24:45] walking without the mind of christ can
[1:24:47] make
[1:24:48] this church be like any other
[1:24:50] denominational church
[1:24:53] true just coming in here making church
[1:24:55] what we want to be
[1:24:56] it ain't what we want it to be honestly
[1:24:59] you remember how it was when you first
[1:25:00] stepped into a church
[1:25:04] maybe you hadn't been there in a while
[1:25:05] you just stepped into church you're just
[1:25:06] like feeling
[1:25:07] a little nervous uncomfortable i wonder
[1:25:10] what they're gonna
[1:25:13] that's the way we need to come into
[1:25:14] church every day
[1:25:16] fear of the lord
[1:25:22] i understand that we should come boldly
[1:25:24] and we should come rejoicing we should
[1:25:25] enter his gates with thanksgiving i
[1:25:27] understand all that
[1:25:29] but if you have that without the fear of
[1:25:31] the lord what you have is a bunch of
[1:25:33] denominations that want to entertain
[1:25:35] have the lights flashing the groups
[1:25:36] going and all right now we're going to
[1:25:38] have this and
[1:25:39] before you know it is they're projecting
[1:25:42] themselves
[1:25:43] their image amen nothing about the image
[1:25:46] of christ
[1:25:48] the word the word the word the word this
[1:25:51] is what we need and not just
[1:25:54] to hear it but to want to live it
[1:26:03] me jesus in the bedroom right don't just
[1:26:07] stay in the kitchen
[1:26:09] don't just sit in the back and hear the
[1:26:10] word he said
[1:26:14] get intimate with him i love this
[1:26:18] here's the secret the word is in the
[1:26:21] bride
[1:26:22] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[1:26:24] knows what he wants done
[1:26:26] with the word she performs the command
[1:26:29] of the word in his name
[1:26:32] for she has thus saith the lord then the
[1:26:35] word
[1:26:36] is quickened notice this the word that's
[1:26:38] in her now
[1:26:39] is quickened by the spirit
[1:26:43] and it comes to pass
[1:26:46] so something has to make that word live
[1:26:49] in you and what that is is the holy
[1:26:50] ghost
[1:26:54] like a seed that's planted and watered
[1:26:57] it comes to full harvest serving
[1:26:59] its purpose so there's a reason that god
[1:27:01] wants you to have the word inside you
[1:27:04] those in the bride do only his will
[1:27:08] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:27:11] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:27:12] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:27:15] god in them doing the works fulfilling
[1:27:17] his
[1:27:18] own word he did not complete all his
[1:27:20] works
[1:27:21] while it was hit while in his earthly
[1:27:24] ministry
[1:27:25] so now he works in you
[1:27:28] amen through the bride he's working in
[1:27:31] you right now
[1:27:32] she knows that for it was not yet
[1:27:35] time for him to do certain things that
[1:27:38] he must
[1:27:39] now do but
[1:27:42] he will now fulfill to the bride that
[1:27:45] work which he left
[1:27:47] for this specific time isn't that
[1:27:49] beautiful
[1:27:51] so beautiful i'd like to
[1:27:55] if i could just read a little bit here
[1:27:56] we've got some time
[1:27:58] we're not having two services right so i
[1:28:00] figured we could just put
[1:28:01] you know two hours you know
[1:28:04] oh i won't do that but turn with me to
[1:28:06] ephesians chapter four
[1:28:08] we're talking about
[1:28:12] not walking in the vanity of our own
[1:28:14] mind
[1:28:15] as other gentiles does other so we say
[1:28:18] so-called believers do
[1:28:22] but what is the mind of christ
[1:28:25] what is it because i know that if i
[1:28:29] don't walk
[1:28:32] right i'm not worthy
[1:28:39] if i keep walking and doing the things
[1:28:41] that i've always done
[1:28:44] because each day or each
[1:28:48] short period of time god's given me
[1:28:50] something more to
[1:28:51] to walk in and i got to do it i got to
[1:28:54] become pregnant
[1:28:55] with this word that he's given me or
[1:28:58] that he's opened up to me
[1:28:59] it's not like it's a new word but he
[1:29:01] comes new to me because
[1:29:03] it becomes personal to me
[1:29:08] and you got to remember we're not down
[1:29:11] at the bottom
[1:29:14] we're up at the top this is the word
[1:29:17] that the bride must become in this age
[1:29:20] let's start with verse number one of
[1:29:22] ephesians chapter
[1:29:23] 4 i therefore
[1:29:26] the prisoner of the lord beseech you
[1:29:31] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[1:29:34] wherewith you're called
[1:29:37] not like other gentiles in the vanity of
[1:29:39] their mind you don't walk like them
[1:29:41] but you walk worthy of what i've called
[1:29:44] you to
[1:29:45] now what is that what is that
[1:29:49] wow look at the simplicity of this get
[1:29:51] pregnant with this
[1:29:53] with all lowliness and meekness
[1:29:57] with long suffering for bearing one
[1:29:59] another
[1:30:00] in love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:30:04] the spirit
[1:30:05] in the bond of peace wow didn't we just
[1:30:09] read all that
[1:30:12] so simple
[1:30:16] but this is not a gift
[1:30:20] it's an endeavoring somebody rises up
[1:30:23] against you during the flesh they're in
[1:30:25] their carnality
[1:30:27] you got to endeavor to keep that unity
[1:30:30] amen you you got to keep that bond to
[1:30:33] peace
[1:30:34] you got to forebear with one another
[1:30:36] you'll be long suffering with one
[1:30:37] another
[1:30:39] because they're not right
[1:30:43] you got to remember it's your walk
[1:30:46] you're walking worthy it's not the
[1:30:48] action that happens to you
[1:30:49] but it's how you react towards it amen
[1:30:53] it's your walk not theirs we can we
[1:30:55] could always say it was obvious
[1:30:56] something's wrong with them
[1:30:57] they shouldn't have done that they
[1:30:58] shouldn't have said that they shouldn't
[1:30:59] act like that that's real easy
[1:31:02] we can identify that it's wrong but can
[1:31:04] we identify the word be impregnated in
[1:31:07] us how to deal with that
[1:31:08] how to restore that amen how to keep
[1:31:11] that from escalating out of the way
[1:31:16] he goes on to say there is one body one
[1:31:19] spirit
[1:31:20] even as you are called into one hope of
[1:31:22] your calling
[1:31:23] one lord one faith one baptism one god
[1:31:27] and father of all who is above all and
[1:31:29] through all and in you all
[1:31:34] one one one one one one
[1:31:37] one one one one one
[1:31:40] is christ divided
[1:31:44] one one
[1:31:49] see how hard it is to be one with
[1:31:51] somebody
[1:31:53] our carnal mind is the only way i can be
[1:31:56] one with mark is that he
[1:31:59] has to like everything i like do
[1:32:01] everything i do
[1:32:04] have like the same songs the same colors
[1:32:07] everything's got to be
[1:32:08] what i like and then we're one right
[1:32:12] but christ is you
[1:32:16] you bend you endeavor
[1:32:20] to keep the unity you be longsuffering
[1:32:23] you be forbearing now it's not me
[1:32:27] liking mark's colors or
[1:32:31] his pecan pie
[1:32:35] because i may don't have taste buds for
[1:32:38] it but it's me becoming christ to him
[1:32:45] the character of christ
[1:32:48] we all can have that and be totally
[1:32:50] different what cars we
[1:32:52] have what we what we want to do and what
[1:32:54] things we
[1:32:55] colors we like and all that stuff
[1:33:00] but see the carnal mind says well i just
[1:33:02] i don't get along with that person and i
[1:33:04] just you know you know i just how to
[1:33:05] handle that
[1:33:06] and just to kind of leave that you know
[1:33:07] what something is wrong
[1:33:10] because today there's nothing stopping
[1:33:12] us from being one with one another
[1:33:15] as we are with christ not a thing amen
[1:33:18] as christ is one with you don't you
[1:33:20] think you can be that same
[1:33:22] one with another person the only way it
[1:33:23] can happen
[1:33:25] is for you to have the same spirit that
[1:33:27] christ has towards you
[1:33:29] now remember because you feel that
[1:33:31] you're one with christ it doesn't mean
[1:33:33] you're just like jesus
[1:33:37] you've got so many pitfalls and faults
[1:33:39] and problems and mistakes
[1:33:40] but yet you're one with christ and
[1:33:42] you'll claim that
[1:33:45] with all your faults why can't we do
[1:33:47] that with one another
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:53] you just gotta have the same attitude
[1:33:54] that christ has towards you
[1:33:56] towards one another amen one one one one
[1:34:01] we're one i will bend over backwards to
[1:34:05] stay one
[1:34:06] i'll never forget because i i've shared
[1:34:07] this with you before
[1:34:09] maybe some of you haven't heard but when
[1:34:11] i first started in business i
[1:34:13] i thought it would be a good thing to
[1:34:15] hire somebody that knew a little bit
[1:34:17] more
[1:34:17] about me in machining than i did because
[1:34:20] we could do more
[1:34:21] right another one that'd be a good idea
[1:34:24] if you want to machine stuff and you
[1:34:25] don't know how to machine it
[1:34:26] you should hire somebody like if i have
[1:34:29] i don't know how to put cars together
[1:34:30] i'd probably call brother bruce if i had
[1:34:31] a problem
[1:34:33] so would you brother mark
[1:34:37] and so i i
[1:34:41] i was more than fair
[1:34:44] i bought him two boxes i just i gave and
[1:34:47] gave and gave
[1:34:48] because i appreciated what he was doing
[1:34:52] to help build the business
[1:34:55] uh but he had the hardest time
[1:34:59] submitting hard the hardest time
[1:35:06] and i said well it's okay if we don't do
[1:35:09] it
[1:35:09] my way but one thing's for sure we're
[1:35:12] going to do it together even if we're
[1:35:14] going to do it your way
[1:35:17] get the unity always in our shop
[1:35:21] no matter what
[1:35:29] now it wasn't the right way a lot of
[1:35:31] times and this still happens to this day
[1:35:34] like my guys they want to do things a
[1:35:36] certain way they get an idea well you
[1:35:38] can't micromanage people
[1:35:40] you gotta let them do their job
[1:35:43] but i remember after about eight years
[1:35:45] and i wanted this person to just
[1:35:47] find something that he could just rally
[1:35:49] behind a boss
[1:35:51] and and kind of be in unity that way
[1:35:55] he didn't want to leave after that but i
[1:35:58] had already made up my mind
[1:35:59] and this is really what i felt the lord
[1:36:02] wanted
[1:36:03] and honestly in our ninth year our
[1:36:06] business doubled in one year after
[1:36:08] that spirit left one year
[1:36:13] unity is important yes amen very
[1:36:16] important they were in one mine and one
[1:36:20] accord
[1:36:21] it's okay that you don't like my shoes
[1:36:24] it's okay it's okay for me not to like
[1:36:27] what you like
[1:36:29] it's not okay for you to have a
[1:36:31] different spirit than christ

[1:36:51] wherefore he saith when he ascended on
[1:36:53] high and led captivity captive and gave
[1:36:55] gifts unto men
[1:36:59] now that he ascended what is it
[1:37:02] but that he also descended first to
[1:37:05] lower parts of the earth
[1:37:07] he that descended is the same also that
[1:37:09] ascended up
[1:37:10] far above all heavens that he might fill
[1:37:13] all things
[1:37:15] and he gave to us is this beautiful
[1:37:19] he gave to us a five-fold ministry
[1:37:24] he gave us the word he gave us an avenue
[1:37:27] in which the word can pregnant us
[1:37:33] to where we can become more like christ
[1:37:38] not get more what we want
[1:37:43] it's hard sometimes to separate the
[1:37:45] flesh
[1:37:46] from the image of christ
[1:37:52] but he gave us a five-fold ministry the
[1:37:54] bible says verse 12
[1:37:55] for the perfecting of us
[1:37:59] that's right amen for
[1:38:02] the work of the ministry for the
[1:38:05] edifying of the body of christ
[1:38:11] till we all come in to
[1:38:15] unity of the faith that's right amen
[1:38:22] don't change my my mind
[1:38:25] about pink
[1:38:28] bowel bottoms
[1:38:33] wash my feet so i can see
[1:38:37] better clothes i need to wear
[1:38:40] one thing to say you need to change you
[1:38:42] need to and it's another thing
[1:38:44] spend some time helping me
[1:38:52] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:38:54] unto a
[1:38:55] perfect man on to the measure the statue
[1:38:57] of the fullness of christ
[1:38:59] that we henceforth be no more
[1:39:03] children tossed
[1:39:06] over here over here one day this one day
[1:39:09] that this is what i think carried about
[1:39:13] with every wind
[1:39:18] well the way that i look at it
[1:39:22] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[1:39:24] men and cunning craftiness
[1:39:26] whereby they lie and wait to deceive you
[1:39:28] notice certain people they look for
[1:39:30] opportunities to say what they want to
[1:39:32] say
[1:39:38] just speak the truth in love amen
[1:39:42] may grow up into him in all things which
[1:39:46] is the head even christ
[1:39:48] from whom the whole body is fitly joined
[1:39:51] together
[1:39:52] compacted by that which every joint it
[1:39:54] supplies something to help the body
[1:39:57] according to the effectual working in
[1:39:58] the measure of every part making
[1:40:01] increase making increase
[1:40:04] of the body onto the edifying of itself
[1:40:07] in love can you imagine
[1:40:08] coming to church and just edifying
[1:40:10] somebody
[1:40:12] increasing somebody you don't got to
[1:40:14] stand by the pulpit to do that
[1:40:16] right right all you got to do is just
[1:40:19] wait after service and express christ to
[1:40:21] somebody
[1:40:23] lift christ up lift the word up
[1:40:29] edify one another this i say therefore
[1:40:33] testify in testifying in the lord that
[1:40:36] ye hands forth walk
[1:40:37] not as other gentiles walk
[1:40:41] in the vanity of their own mind in other
[1:40:43] words
[1:40:44] they're they don't they don't do what we
[1:40:48] just read
[1:40:52] other gentiles it's all about who's the
[1:40:55] greatest
[1:40:56] right it's all about them individually
[1:41:00] but us we're all one together we're
[1:41:03] we're a body
[1:41:04] the ministry is to make us more one amen
[1:41:09] we want to become the word that we hear
[1:41:14] we don't want this word to fit
[1:41:17] our carnal mind
[1:41:21] we want our mind to become this word
[1:41:25] amen let's stand together
[1:41:31] praise the lord for the mind of christ
[1:41:34] praise the lord that the bride
[1:41:37] has the mind of christ and that she
[1:41:40] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:41:43] we just heard the word
[1:41:48] he wants us to be long-suffering he
[1:41:50] wants us
[1:41:51] to endeavor
[1:41:55] work harder to bring unity not endeavor
[1:41:58] to show that we're right
[1:42:01] god is hidden in simplicity you know
[1:42:04] this
[1:42:05] there's no way in the world you would
[1:42:07] ever want to give your children
[1:42:10] something greater if they can't handle
[1:42:12] what they're doing
[1:42:15] she just you just don't want to do that
[1:42:18] so a lot of times when we look at the
[1:42:20] things that god asked us to do
[1:42:21] they could be very simple just they
[1:42:24] could be just church attendance
[1:42:26] it could be real simple it could be just
[1:42:29] just pray daily
[1:42:30] whatever it might be we think it's not
[1:42:33] that big a deal
[1:42:35] but it's those little things that
[1:42:38] that if we're just faithful god will
[1:42:40] give us more
[1:42:43] do you believe that i believe that with
[1:42:45] all my heart
[1:42:46] i i don't i don't think we should kind
[1:42:50] of separate the important things of god
[1:42:52] to the things that are not important
[1:42:54] with god
[1:42:55] the whole word is important to god
[1:42:57] faithfulness is important to god
[1:42:59] amen wherever you see yourself
[1:43:03] today in your walk with god in your
[1:43:08] in your mind
[1:43:13] take the things that god has spoken to
[1:43:15] you
[1:43:20] and just ask god to pregnant it make it
[1:43:22] real make it stick
[1:43:25] so that you're able to become this word
[1:43:30] one thing is for sure you could hear it
[1:43:32] a thousand times
[1:43:34] and never become it if you don't want it
[1:43:38] but if you want it you hunger your
[1:43:39] thirst you want to live it
[1:43:43] that's the opening of your heart
[1:43:45] changing your nature
[1:43:47] don't let any other
[1:43:50] gospel message
[1:43:54] idea come to you it's a wrong spirit let
[1:43:57] it be accursed
[1:43:59] stay with the word that god has given us
[1:44:03] amen let's bow in a word of prayer
