us to he wants to give us the things that are eternal and it's a privilege for us to come into his house today and to receive those things let's go to the lord in a word of prayer before we read his word heavenly father we want to thank you for the privilege of knowing you that one day you came by in our in our walk and you got our attention lord you let us know that the role that we were on

chapter nine it's good to see everyone in the house of the lord today good to see my daughter joy and husband patrick god bless you thank you for coming and each and every one of you god bless you good to have our visitor in the back praise the lord god bless god bless you luke chapter 9 starting with verse number 23 this is a familiar scripture and jesus said to them all so he wasn't leaving anybody out he said if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life will end up losing it but whosoever will lose his life now for my sake the same shall save it eternally for what is a man's advantage if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be a castaway for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of himself shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and the holy angels amen god bless you may be seated say god bless you to those that are live streaming today missing some of the saints i'd like to title this message standing up for jesus for a subject i want to take not embarrassed to follow more of the word than i'm presently following i believe in in that statement i could say that there's certain things in our life that were we really need to be bore four and if it wasn't true we'd be out of here and it would be uh a disgrace for any of us to think i'm there i'm just waiting on somebody else i believe that's why we come to the house of the lord is to to see let the holy spirit speak to our heart if there's anything else he wants to to move up in to take a stand in the bible tells us that every man that's born into this world is born without jesus and he's heading straight to hell in man's greatest currency we learned is time in other words our days are numbered and if he spends all of that time to try to gain the whole world he would literally be a cast away from jesus jesus said for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed of when he shall come in his own glory and his father and the holy angels i don't want to be ashamed of him we're living in the worst age known to mankind we've never seen a spirit of such deception confusion as strong as it is today jesus said that many false spirits would arise in the last days and shall deceive many and because rebellion would abound the love of many what wax code now i'll put in a couple words there but they are exactly what they mean to help us see that rebellion can happen to any of us at any time for any reason we got a believer here how many believes that believers are more in love with themselves today than they've ever been bolsters in the church proud unthankful it was prophesied we see it happening men who are once believers have fallen away from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits second timothy 3 13 says evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived there doesn't paul didn't give timothy a whole lot of hope for the world the world can't give us hope right right amen our only hope can be in jesus many who stay in church are are battling spirits of laodicea right lukewarmness some some believers are at ease in zion and they're they're loving the pleasures of of of uh loving the pleasures of this world more than being a a loving the pleasure of serving god exercising their rights with their attitudes that they don't need nothing they don't need anybody to tell them what to do but jesus said he would spew the lukewarm church right out of his mouth why because they're not taking a stand with the fire of god amen that's right the bible says that he will laugh one day at their calamity brother branham said people are afraid to stand today he said don't be afraid to make your stand for god if you don't stand for him you'll stand alone this age is the worst age to be living in if a man is not standing up for jesus first peter chapter 5 verse 8 says that her adversary the devil is a royal line walketh about seeking whom he may devour who will the devil devour the person who's not taking a stand for god the man who's not on fire for god amen he'll devour your joy your peace your love your patience your tempers he'll he'll devour your faith that's why we got to exercise your faith that's why we got to believe every word of god and and say amen to the word of god and this is a chance for you to exercise your faith muscles the world is completely deceived satan has them at arm's length and as soon as the bride is taken off the earth hell is going to erupt right on the earth just like a volcano tribulation will never tribulation is coming it's the world has never seen before it's going to be so bad so chaotic that men will actually want to die they would rather die than go through what they're going through think about how hard that would be and a man who's not standing with god in this age will surely be devoured there is no purgatory there is no holding place there's no waiting ground this is this is our chance to stand for the lord it's the worst age to be living in if we're not standing for jesus but yet it's the greatest age for the believer who loves standing up for jesus because the greater the evil the greater that you're able to express how much you love god by standing up against it in this lukewarm age where iniquity is bounding will you take a stand psalms 94 verse 16 says who will rise up for me against the evil doers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity so my question is will you stand more it's easier to stand against certain things that you are strong in but we need to take the whole word of god amen noah lived in the age we're nothing but evil was continually on the hearts and minds of the people but he wasn't ashamed god asked him to do something that the world had never done never seen and he was an oddball for about 120 years he preached the same message that god is going to come and destroy the earth and no one believed him but he kept preaching he kept preaching and you know what he didn't preach it he lived it he built an art for 120 years he was showing that what he preached he believed in it wasn't but just his family right that came in jesus said in mark 8 37 what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore will be ashamed of me and of my words now look at this in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in his glory of his father and with the holy angels so here jesus is talking about the adulterous and sinful generation standing up for jesus may seem like an easy thing to do expressing to someone in private that he is your savior you've accepted him as your personal savior or letting someone know that you go to church on sundays or that that you're a christian but there's so much more to standing up to jesus than those things there are other words that the gospel tells us about that we could be ashamed of there's things in this bible that we could be embarrassed about like being too embarrassed to wear the right clothing to keep the makeup off our faces to say that we're in the message of the hour to be associated with certain individuals maybe too embarrassed to be baptized in the name of jesus christ maybe too embarrassed to really love a certain person it may be just easier just to laugh and kind of walk away maybe too embarrassed to to just lay down our lives for a certain individual because we just got something against them maybe too embarrassed to come to the altar too embarrassed to seek more of the holy ghost if i go to law somebody's going to think i don't got any i don't got the holy ghost if i go to the altar and pray jesus says if we don't deny ourselves we're really ashamed of christ brother braham said the word ashamed here means embarrassed whosoever therefore shall be embarrassed of me and embarrassed of my words this is what i wanted us to focus on this morning is the words of christ some reason people seem to separate the two and you can't brother branham said and that's the way that so-called christianity today but when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word christ no they're embarrassed he said another thing being ashamed does it shows that you're not sure what you're talking about if you know what you're talking about you have assurance that you know what you're talking about you can tell anybody that you're not ashamed but if you feel put out or out of place it shows that you're not sure many times i've encountered people who who are simply too embarrassed to follow the word because no matter who you're talking to not just your children not just your parents not not just somebody that's younger and you in the lord but no matter who you're talking to there should be something in your heart to see that person come up higher in christ amen and if it's not you it should be the god that lives inside of you and god wants to use each and every one of us to bring each and every one of us up higher brother braham says when a man ever meets god not in some emotional workup some enthusiasm or some religious doctrine some catechism or creed or dogma that is accepted for a comfort for himself but when he comes to the place like moses did on the back side of the desert walk up face to face with almighty god and you see the voice speaking to you exactly what the word and the promise of the hour is there is something it does to you see you're not ashamed of it it does something to you and that's what we need we need more of an encounter with the holy ghost the living word of god to come to church and try to receive man's words across a pulpit to be a better person that just means somebody much smarter much more intelligent can come by and talk you out of it but when god speaks to your heart and you know it's from him there ain't a man on the earth that can talk you out of it amen and we need that if we're going to stand for him because we're all going to be tested we're all going to be tried truly standing up for jesus means standing up for his word his word is the highest order of absolute amen heaven and earth shall pass away but god's word shall never pass away it's absolutely in vain to stand up for jesus without standing up for his word a man standing for jesus but ignores the bible is really not standing for jesus he's just deceived it's literally impossible to separate jesus from the bible amen what what are we going to be judged by everybody thinks i'm going to be judged by jesus and he's going to judge me i i know he's going to judge me fairly because he just loves everybody and they got this image in his mind their mind that that there's something special that that's going to happen in their favor on the day of judgment come on i'm just i'm just speaking as it is the thoughts that we think the bible is going to judge mankind at the white throne judgment john chapter 12 verse 48 write this down now jesus speaking here he said he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words have one he didn't say two he didn't say three he said have one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day in other words god is not going to come on the white throne judgment and judge you with a different word a different set of circumstances a different age it was already the word that was spoken in the bible that's what we're going to be judged by amen did you know the bible wasn't written with any of man's private interpretation second peter chapter 1 verse 20 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation uh so i don't i i don't really care what you think about the scriptures for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost we i'm sure i remember when i was in the world but i'd listen to music and i'd get in the spirit of that music whether i was listening to the moody blues or neo diamond or alice cooper and today we can even listen to some gospel music some good old gospel music and it really just kind of picks you up well these men when they wrote this it was the holy ghost that was inside of them that was moving them to pen exactly the mind of god it wasn't mixed with their thoughts god got him out of the way and moved in and took control to give us confidence today in the word of god ii timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says all scripture is given by the inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that we the men of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works we don't need anything but the word of god to complete us amen nothing god has protected his word through the ages and times and he stands by every word in the bible amen and he'll vindicate it to be the absolute truth but you have to believe it amen if you don't believe it you'll never know it to be the truth unto the day of judgment and then you will know you will know on that day look the devils believe and they're not even believers right it's true think about that they believe but they're not even believers they're not christian believers but they know and they tremble amen they why do they tremble because they know it to be the truth but they're not rejoicing when the bible is being preached i mean the devil comes to church he doesn't say amen to the word you know what he says oh he's pointing at you he's directing this at you oh he's calling you this he's calling you that the devil comes to church to try to confuse our minds but the holy ghost inside the believer says amen to the word of god whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed the more you stand for god's word the more you'll be standing for jesus i know you think well i can't stand anymore for jesus than what i am but you can find somewhere in the word that you need to be doing and take a stand for it you'll be showing jesus i'm standing for you because outside of this word trying to convince anybody that you're standing for jesus it's vain it's true that's right what good would it be gotta get over here what good would it be for me to slap brother mark on the face and say i love jesus just because i feel in my heart that i love jesus when really i i need to let him hit me and still wash his feet by this shall men know that you're not ashamed of standing for the love of god amen the name of jesus is powerful amen jesus said in my name they shall cast out devils do you know the bible says in acts chapter 4 verse 12 that there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved it's only through the name of jesus peter said in acts chapter 2 verse 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive god in spirit form that's what the holy ghost is not titles jesus never wanted salvation to come through his titles he intended salvation to come through his name amen he meant what he said in matthew chapter 28 verse 18 and jesus came and spake unto them all power is given unto me he was he was he was trying to first he was setting the the foundation look i call the shots all power is given unto me and he said go teach and baptize them in the name singular of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost well what is the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost jesus meant what he said and the apostles carried it out amen ephesians chapter 3 verse 15 says that the whole family in heaven and earth is named after jesus in fact whether we're family or not the word of god says in philippians chapter 2 verse 10 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things that are in heaven things on earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father the name of jesus is above every other name amen there's not only power to cast out demons but there's power to change a nature amen and that happens when you're listening to the word of god and your heart says amen i want that for my life that's this word is jesus amen and when you're believing the word it can change your nature but did you know that god places something even above his name i know it's hard for me to believe it too but it's the truth turn with me to psalms 138 verse 2. that's why we need to study to show ourselves and proof psalms 138 verse 2 i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for their lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou has magnified thy word above all thy name think about that amen his word is honored above his name have one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day that's how important the word of god is to take a stand for the word amen not just say i'm standing for jesus i'm standing for the word i'm standing for every page not just the promises but the commandments come on not just for what i want to stand for but i want to stand for all that jesus believes in and all that jesus is amen too often people will stand for the name of jesus but will ignore the very words that he said if we don't stand for the word we're really not standing for jesus if we're ashamed of the word we're ashamed of jesus we cannot separate the two amen saint john 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god the word was god amen that was the logos word it was a pillar fire it was the same pillar fire that led the children of israel it was the same pillar fire that paul met on the road to damascus that's what was in the beginning verse two the same was in the beginning with god the word amen in verse 14 that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen now we've got to accept this bible to be jesus christ himself in word form amen we've got to it's his letter to us how to be saved and how to stay continually blessed you believe it and you watch it become manifested in your life now there are benefits when we stand up for god's word the bible tells us that god's word will save us it will protect us it will heal us it will guide us it will lead us it will comfort us it will cleanse us put us on the right track psalms 119 i'm going to take all these scriptures from psalms 119. this is a good chapter to read when you get time verse 9 says wherewith shall a young man cleanse his ways it's a good question by taking he thereunto according to thy word verse 41 let thy mercies come also unto me o lord even thy salvation according to thy word it has to be according to the word the bible says in ephesians 5 verse 26 that that god will sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of the water by the word so it's okay when we come to church and we're hearing the words say boy this is just not making me feel good you know a lot of times i get up and i take a shower now you i really do that every day i don't want it but you know when i get up and i take a shower i don't like look forward to it i'd rather stay in bed i look forward to brushing my teeth but you have to do it right and a man when he walks through the course of the day he gets thoughts that are wrong that are evil that he he begins to to take ties with the enemy and he doesn't realize he gets tripped in and he needs to get cleansed of that and the word is here to cleanse us and wash us and it's okay it's a good feeling when you get when you finally get out of that shower and you put some clean clothes on you feel like you're ready for the day now tell you when the word cleanses us you feel like you're ready to go start the right way again the word of god will show you how to think and talk and walk correctly psalms 1 19 verses 105 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my pet well i can just figure it out myself no you can't and the devil's standing there to make sure you can't we need the word of god to tell us when we're wrong where we're wrong when we get off amen and when the word becomes quickened inside of our hearts it will bring such a comfort to us such a strength to our to our our lives right in the middle of the chaos and the problems that we have and i i have a feeling that they're not going away so we're going to need to to get more comfort strength from god's word but i'll tell you what has to happen is the word actually has to do something inside of us it can't just be a mental belief a mental conception or a quoting no you have to come in contact with the the life of the word psalms 118 verse 15 this is my comfort in my affliction for thy word has quickened me verse 28 my soul melted for heaviness strengthened thou me according to thy word the very thing that could help us we try to shy away from and it's the very thing that we need i had a and you've all can relate this you've had a toothache at one time or another you gotta go to the dentist and get it taken care of but i don't like the dentist i don't want to sit there i don't want to hear but you need it because it will bring comfort it will eventually help you in your situation the word will give us understanding psalms 119 169 says let my cry come near before thee oh lord give me understanding according to thy word give me understanding according to thy word i don't want understanding according to the newspaper according to the news according to the radio according to even what my neighbors think i want the word to give me understanding amen god will deliver us according to his word verse 170 let my supplication come before thee deliver me according to thy word verse 160 that word is true from the beginning every one of thy righteous judgments endure forever verse 89 forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven amen you know all of us at one time or another has watched tv shows and sometimes tv shows become mundane and you're looking for another plot you wonder what the next season's going to bring and you hope they change as you hope sometimes you hope they keep this you don't like it when they kill off a bad guy are you with me but when we get to heaven there's not going to be a new word it's not going to be new ideas this is it what a privilege we have today to know that god is in his word amen [Music] we need to stand up for jesus don't be ashamed to share jesus sharing with more people than you are presently sharing them sharing more often with your family your co-workers and neighbors even strangers or people that you don't know share jesus as often as you can thank you i'll tell you the more amens we could get the further we get this train down the track this morning don't be ashamed to share jesus give him more of your time amen it is the most precious currency give him more of your money it is the least precious currency the love of that currency is the root of all evil so use it for the lord give him more of your life it's all you have it's all i have don't be ashamed to stand more for the word of god i'm not taking away your stand for the lord at all wherever we're at praise god we're here to talk about standing more amen where else can i stand more for the lord each one of us need to look at the areas in our lives to see where we can stand more for jesus i'm sure there's areas that we're just sitting down too much we need to get up take our position for jesus sometimes standing up for jesus means taking a backseat [Laughter] by letting your reputation go just like saul did sometimes we're so proud of ourselves we want to preserve our reputation too proud to humble ourselves to a lower degree of labor you want me to do that i'm too important to do that too ashamed to look to be looked at as not a very important person maybe not very profitable jesus said in luke 17 10 so likewise when you have done all those things richard commanded you say in other words have this attitude in your heart we are unprofitable servants we have done that which that which was our duty to do after you do everything that god has asked you to do still view yourself as unprofitable in other words if it wasn't for the grace of god we would know to do what he asked us to do taking a stand for jesus means eliminating your murmuring and you're complaining in your life don't be ashamed to be more content in your life it's an honor the word tells us in philippians 2 verse 14 do all things without murmuring and complaining that you may be blameless harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine his lights in the world what an honor when everybody's murmuring and complaining you're expressing how content you are you're expressing the joy of just being able to serve amen don't be ashamed take a stand for being harmless be content the lord is my shepherd i shall not walk want you know when you you you actually quote that you know that'll get rid of the devil amen you know sometimes we're struggling in our flash it's jus there's that war going on and you want to do your own thing you want to prove your point you gotta you know what got to remind the devil who your shepherd is he'll flee have we been too ashamed to forgive somebody lately say i'm sorry when the word says if we don't forgive he won't forgive us have we been too ashamed to lower ourselves to wash somebody's feet they're too dirty when his word commands us to wash one another's feet regardless of how dirty they are have we been too ashamed to lower ourselves to love a certain person otherwise we can we love but there's certain people that we want when his word declares that that there is no other identification of a real christian than to bow to love brother branham says but how can a man who is filled with the holy ghost how could a man full of the power of god and the love of god in his heart talk to a man a few minutes and not mention something about the love that's in his heart amen that's right something happens you can't do it you just have to express what's going on inside of you amen he said this is must be that evil day that jesus was speaking of where people are ashamed of the word and the spirit of god that acts within them amen have we been too ashamed really to reach out lay down our lives for somebody for a certain person his word mandates us to lay down our lives for one another have we been too ashamed to stop doing something that we know we should when the word prohibits us from doing it amen we have a duty and a responsibility to stand up for the whole word of god amen it needs to become as important to us as anything that you think is important from genesis to revelation brother branham says we've got to accept our responsibility don't be ashamed to take a stand for jesus did you know moses actually took a stand for jesus back in his day he wasn't ashamed to stand for jesus hebrews chapter 11 verse 24 says by faith when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the afflictions with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ in other words esteeming the humility and insults for being a christian or the the humiliating treatment of the words that are spoken or the actions that that came towards him he esteemed that reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt amen for he had respect unto the compensation of the reward i'll tell you we have a great reward when you take a stand for jesus you may not be getting it from the person you're taking a stand for because they may be talking behind your back right don't expect to get your reward from them but god's got one for you amen peter and the rest of the apostles were beaten for taking a stand for jesus they were commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus anymore and he they let him go and in acts chapter 5 verse 41 and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame first name to suffer shame you know two people too many people are too proud to be ashamed that's right too proud to just to be ashamed of anything come on there's got to be a humility in a christian amen that could just be honest and daily in the temple now notice they were kind of worthy to suffer shame for his name and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and to preach jesus christ well brother john you're talking out of a book that happened 2 000 years ago i want some current news the current news is the people that are living today we're not living 2 000 years ago and we ought to be doing the same thing today that's what the current news is are you ready to stand for jesus are you ready to share his words with somebody we stand by standing for his word paul was so indebted to jesus that he was willing to suffer the loss of everything and help save souls in romans chapter 1 verse 14 paul said i am a i am deader this is a good way to be humble if you really feel in debt amen i'm a debtor both to the greeks to the barbarians to the wise and to the unwise pretty much he was a debtor to everybody right even if he didn't know them so as much as is in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are in rome also amen for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation everyone that believeth to the jew first they rejected him and also to the greek amen for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as is written the just shall live by faith not feelings not emotions not understanding not knowledge not your own interpretation but by the word of god we should never be shy right hesitant or uncommitted to make a complete stand for jesus timothy struggled in his early christian walk and paul encouraged him in second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 to take a complete stand for the lord he says for god has not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me who am i i'm in prison but being thou partaker of the same afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god amen sometimes we're just too ashamed too ashamed to lower ourselves and be part of something that you know we think we're much higher than that god wasn't ashamed to call us brethren amen we should not be ashamed of him amen first john chapter 2 verse 20 and i know there's a lot of scriptures today just bear with me try to enter into every one and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him that is coming take a stand for god in this last age there have been millions who have gone on before us that have taken a stand and in hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 the writer says we're foreseen we are also compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight how many's got any weights i mean these are good instructions right here just lay it aside don't act like you don't just lay it aside and the sin and the unbelief which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us the writer's encouraging us that there's been a whole bunch of people before them hebrews chapter 11 shares a good portion of them amen that they ran their race they kept the faith they weren't ashamed to take a stand some of them were beheaded some of them were burned some were fed the lions but they took a stand for jesus christ now today this is in our hour we may not be facing those types of things but every time sin stops right there at the door and invites us to take an easier path maybe not to go to church maybe not to love somebody maybe not to lay down your life or somebody i'll tell you you have a chance to take a stand for jesus right there looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising despising the shame he didn't even let it bother him because it was the joy that was set before him he was he was if i could say it like this this is what he was born for to be a sacrifice that you and i could be saved let's sit down at the right hand of the throne of god take a stand in this last hour reach out to as many people as you can with the gospel amen take us a stand and spread the only news that there is in the whole world right now that can actually save a soul i mean there's other news out there that might not have saved somebody about something but there's only one news that can save a soul amen you sisters with your long hair and your dress you're going to receive a reward standing for jesus remember when you're subject to your husband you're taking a stand for jesus when you're teaching your children to love jesus you're taking a stand for jesus there's so many ways that we can take a stand for the lord amen brothers when you're subject to your employer you're taking a stand for jesus when you walk away from a compromiser you're standing for jesus paul told any believer if any believer had a form of godliness but he denied the power thereof from such turn away you're taking a stand for jesus come on i'm just preaching the word i know it may not be something that we think about but that's why we're preaching it amen when you husbands are taking care of your wives you're taking a stand for jesus when you're helping them with a need you're taking a stand for jesus it isn't just saying i believe in jesus he's my savior it's every single word of god amen stand for the word think about the word read the word meditate upon the word talk about the word listen to it amen let it become such a part of you that you take a stand all day long for jesus when hatred and backbiting is circling all around you when people just want to use you for their gain remember when you love them sincerely from your heart you're taking a stand for jesus that's what he said be perfect amen be just like my father when you do this you're taking a stand see so many people think they're taking the stand for jesus and they ignore what the word says but they're so religious they'll tell you right to their face how much they're taking a stand for jesus hey more wars have been fought over religion than anything else so physically people can really push themselves but they have the hardest time laying down their life because it's too humbling they're too proud in the message the church and its condition brother branham says oh when the world sees the display of the love of god that gallant in the human heart what a difference it'll be when when we let the dove of god come in our heart and gentle us and make us meek there is nothing else that's going to melt our heart like the love of god and friends we need to display it more which means i have to get hot water to display it i have to be in a trial to display it it's not just from the pulpit right it's just not telling somebody on the phone it needs to i need to get in such hot water that people are expecting everything but the love of god and when the love of god is manifested by this you know what all men will know that you are my disciples learn to love more the people that you're talking to amen display an agape love no matter how much it hurts you your pride love them unconditionally paul told timothy if we suffer we shall also reign with him but if we deny him he also will deny us now i think when we deny loving the way he's told us to love we're actually denying him we're ashamed of them brother and says don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplexed the last generation that that ever that will ever be on the earth is sinful adulterous and full of putrified sores all everything that's been decent has become indecent national politics filthy the nations are broken up but yet the message is don't be ashamed of jesus christ keep him first who cares who wins the argument over politics over what's right or wrong about anything that's happening in the world when that becomes a more of a priority we lose our focus on what our party should be what an honor it is for you and i to represent jesus in this sinful age and there are many ways that we can stand up more for jesus and he's looking for frontliners he's looking for someone who automatically wants to sit in the front row to stand in the front row and say lord use me use me lord now when he uses you it ain't going to be easy he i don't think when brother mark goes home he's got 50 people standing in front of his lawn saying would you please tell me about jesus no but the 25 people that he sees at work he has an opportunity to stand firm for jesus we all do brother branham told a little story many times he used different names in it but he talked he told a story about danny danny curry he was an evangelist about a hundred years ago or more maybe 150 named a couple different times but he had a dream one night and he he died he went to heaven and and he wrote a book about this experience he wrote in his book this experience and so as he enters up to the gate and a voice spoke to him the gatekeeper and said who is this that is approaching this uh holy place and he said well my my name is danny curry i'm an evangelist and i i i've left my earthly home and i've come here to take my my position here uh in in heaven and the gatekeeper went and looked in the book he looked all through the book and he couldn't find the name danny curry so he comes back and he tells him i'm sorry but your name isn't in this book and i can't let you in he says well there must be some mistake i was an evangelist in america and i won many souls to jesus he says i'm sorry sir i've searched and it's not there he says oh and distraught what could he do because there was nothing left for him to do just a wanderer and the the angel the the the gatekeeper said well you can appeal before the white throne judgment he said well if that's my only hope if that's my only chance there's nothing else i could do and at that time it seemed like he just was going through time and and and space and and there was a light that became brighter and brighter and before you know it that light was all wrong he couldn't tell where it was coming from and he came right to the center of this light and a voice spoke out to him and said who are thou that has come into the the presence of my justice and he said my name is daniel curry and i i got rejected and condemned at the gate said my name wasn't written in the book and said the only way that i have a chance is to appeal before the white throne judgment he says you want to you want to be judged at my seat of justice and holiness and daniel curry said yes i do he says well were you daniel curry were you did you ever tell a lie and he thought well this is easy i would live for the lord i never never 20 lies and and about the time that he was so sure of the situation that light began to expose his past and he remembered the things that he said that wasn't completely true and he bowed his head and he just said lord i i have lied and the voice spoke out of the light and said daniel curry were you were you always honest with your dealings he thought well surely he was an honest man he lived that life and and and being a christian and everything and to be that example and when he's about ready to say i was an honest man in the presence of god his memory began to flash back all the times he did those shady deals all the times that he wasn't just completely on board and he had to say no i wasn't always honest and he went through the the commandments and i'll tell you we may be sitting here thinking that we're okay but when we get in the presence of god it'll show things that we're not thinking about today and after he went through those commandments he finally asked him at the end he said were you perfect were you perfect on earth because my word says that you must be perfect be perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect about a love unconditionally everybody about that time the power and the presence of god was so strong all he could see was the mistakes that he made the times that he failed to really be perfect and to love everybody and about that time the the thunders began to roar and a blast came and he was getting ready to hear those words depart from me get out of my presence you're not worthy and about that time as he was listening he heard the sweetest voice he ever heard and he turned around to look and he saw the sweetest face that he ever seen he said there he said in his book that there was no mother's voice that could have been as sweet as his voice that he heard and looked so comforting and so beautiful as his face and he came up close to daniel cure and he put his arm around him he drew him close and he said father it's true daniel wasn't perfect but one thing he did do when he was on earth he stood for me today i'm going to stand for you amen amen i'll tell you that's what matters is if you're trying to stand for jesus with all your heart it's not about trying to to be the most perfect person you can be it's about when you hear god speak to you something inside of you says it means a lot to me god i really want to please you because it doesn't matter what people think of you come on beware when all men speak good of you they call jesus beelzebub what are they going to call you some good cookie god just wants us to stand from to take a stand from in our personal lives whatever god speaks to your heart that's where he wants you to stand and eventually the more you stand the closer you get to his image the more you can be used of them in this age don't be ashamed of what the bible says amen don't be ashamed of getting on your knees and helping somebody amen pray for them pray for the love of god in your heart get to a place where you can just love everybody at any time and whatever the god asks you to do just do it amen take a stand for the word if you don't know what the word says spend time reading the bible learn more about jesus you can't know jesus outside the word it doesn't matter what you feel in your heart what you think if it don't line up with the word it's not jesus it's got to be this word take a stand for it because on that day we all want him to put his arm around us and say no i know john martin he wasn't perfect he had a lot of problems but he stood for me and i'm going to stand for him amen stand with me today stand with me today and as you stand i want you to take a stand for jesus to know that despite our problems he's got a blood there to cover us he's standing for us the least we could do is stand for him amen with every head vows my wife goes to just play something quietly i wonder just search in our hearts at this time is there an area that you haven't been willing to stand for jesus kind of been maybe putting it off and just looking at other things where you are standing for him i'm thankful for those areas that you have been standing but is calling us to take a greater stand today [Music] maybe you've been a little shamed [Music] something in his word something you haven't been willing just to just say lord i'm gonna do this let this moment be the moment that inside your heart say god i'm gonna take a stand for you i'm gonna take a stand for your word i'm gonna become more like you or represent you more there's such a love inside of me today i just want to stand for you knowing that you

with you to not be ashamed of what your word is calling us to do lord i pray as you have spoken to our hearts may we open our hearts to you and say yes to your word to receive you to receive your word
