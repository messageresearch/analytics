[31:36] Oh Lord, we worship you this morning. We
[31:39] thank you that we could come into your
[31:41] house and just offer to you, Lord, a a a
[31:45] heart of thanksgiving, a a heart of
[31:47] praise, a heart of gratitude, Lord, that
[31:50] you've given us breath of life today,
[31:52] that you you've given us salvation. you
[31:55] haven't taken it back. And Lord, that
[31:57] you meet all of our needs according to
[31:58] your riches and glory. We just thank you
[32:01] for all things today,
[32:04] Lord. There's not enough hours in the
[32:06] day to thank you for all that you've
[32:08] done for us, Lord Jesus. Oh, we love you
[32:12] today. [applause] Praise [cheering] you
[32:13] today. Praise you today, Lord.
[32:18] [applause]
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. How
[32:23] &gt;&gt; how great is our God?
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to have brother Ron back.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And uh so good to
[32:36] uh see brother Ferguson as well been on
[32:39] our heart and just so thankful to see
[32:43] him pressing pressing in with all the
[32:46] the big family. And you know, the bigger
[32:48] the family, the more sicknesses, the
[32:50] more things you got to go through and
[32:53] just appreciate
[32:55] him pressing in to be with us because we
[32:58] need them are part of part of this local
[33:03] body. Amen. Now turn with me if you
[33:05] would. We're just going to read one
[33:07] scripture in the book of Judges chapter
[33:10] 6.
[33:15] How many is has stopped halting between
[33:17] two decisions?
[33:20] Amen. [laughter]
[33:22] Beautiful.
[33:24] Beautiful.
[33:28] It's so much easier to walk when you've
[33:30] made up your mind.
[33:33] You don't have decisions. Decisions are
[33:35] very easy to make. It's only when you
[33:38] haven't made that decision that
[33:41] everything becomes complex and hard.
[33:49] Can you say amen if you're there? All
[33:51] right. Judges chapter 6. We're going to
[33:53] read verse number 13 and have a word of
[33:56] prayer.
[33:57] And Gideon said unto him, "Oh
[34:01] my Lord,
[34:03] if the Lord be with us,
[34:06] why then is all this befallen us?
[34:11] And where be all his miracles which our
[34:13] fathers told us of saying, did not the
[34:17] Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the
[34:21] Lord hath forsaken us, delivered us into
[34:24] the hands of the Midionites.
[34:28] Let's a word of prayer. Our heavenly
[34:30] father,
[34:32] Lord, we thank you for your people that
[34:34] have brought the sacrifice of praise
[34:36] today
[34:38] because you certainly are worthy of all
[34:42] the praise that can be given to you. You
[34:45] have never failed. You've never slacked.
[34:50] You've never forsaken.
[34:53] You've never come short.
[34:57] You are the most awesome thing that
[34:59] we've ever experienced.
[35:03] And we thank you that your your people
[35:05] have come this morning to bring you
[35:07] praise for just that, for so great a
[35:10] salvation.
[35:12] Lord, we thank you for thy word. Thy
[35:15] word is spirit and their life. And we
[35:18] ask today that you would come with your
[35:21] anointing
[35:23] and that each of our hearts and our our
[35:26] ears are the the ears of our spirit and
[35:30] soul could hear what you you are saying
[35:34] to the church today. Lord, let us grab
[35:37] Lord the very essence of the message
[35:40] today that we might have more faith in
[35:43] you uh for our personal lives. Father,
[35:47] we commit the service in you. We trust
[35:49] you for these things. Meet needs that
[35:51] would be amongst us. Lord, do above,
[35:54] Lord, what we're even asking in this
[35:55] prayer. We pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; And God bless you. May be seated.
[36:06] Well, I knew from the very first song
[36:07] that Brother Ron was singing,
[36:11] uh, very first course
[36:13] that God was with us in this message
[36:15] today.
[36:18] And he's saying, I don't know if you all
[36:19] remember, but he's saying, "Open our
[36:21] open our eyes, Lord."
[36:24] I want to title this message, I am with
[36:27] you always.
[36:30] I am with you always. Israel just had 40
[36:32] years of rest and prosperity
[36:36] in the land. But through this time of of
[36:39] prosperity, they let the bars down. They
[36:43] allowed their standard to become lower.
[36:46] And what happens when people do that?
[36:50] The enemy has a tendency of coming in.
[36:53] And in Israel's complacency, they began
[36:56] to reverence the wrong spirits
[37:00] and began to do evil things in the sight
[37:02] of God. So what did the Lord do? What he
[37:06] always does, he allows the enemy to
[37:08] bring them into bondage because God does
[37:11] not cross through more agency. And they
[37:14] became servants. And when Israel got
[37:16] into the position, they began to call on
[37:19] God for help, which is exactly what God
[37:21] wanted him to do at the beginning. And
[37:23] uh which is the only chance that any of
[37:26] us have of ever making it because God is
[37:29] not going to come in and and and and
[37:31] take away all of our bad choices,
[37:35] right? We've got to say, uh, I don't
[37:38] want those choices anymore. And and we
[37:41] got to say, I choose I choose good over
[37:44] evil.
[37:46] Let's just pick this up now in Judges
[37:48] chapter 6 verse 7. And it came to pass
[37:51] when the children of Israel cried unto
[37:53] the Lord because of the Minionites that
[37:55] the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[37:58] children of Israel just like he did in
[38:02] our age, right? which said unto them,
[38:04] thus sayaeth the Lord God of Israel, I
[38:06] brought you up from Egypt, and brought
[38:08] you forth out of the house of bondage,
[38:11] and I delivered you into the hand of the
[38:14] uh I delivered you out of the hand of
[38:15] the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
[38:17] all that oppressed you, and drove them
[38:20] out from before you, and gave you their
[38:23] land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord
[38:26] your God. Fear not the gods of the
[38:28] Amorites in whose land you dwell, but ye
[38:30] have not obeyed my voice.
[38:35] There's the there's the criteria right
[38:37] there.
[38:38] And there came an angel of the Lord, and
[38:41] sat under an oak tree, which was in
[38:43] Ofra, and that pertained unto the uh
[38:47] that pertained unto Joash
[38:50] the Abberite,
[38:52] and his son Gideon, threshing wheat by
[38:55] the wine press to hide from the
[38:57] Minionites.
[38:58] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[39:00] him, and said unto him, The Lord is with
[39:03] thee, thou mighty man of value.
[39:12] So Gideon did not recognize that God was
[39:15] with him. And often times we don't
[39:18] recognize that God is with us.
[39:22] And let alone our view of oursel is not
[39:26] always what God's view is.
[39:30] So God calls him a mighty man of valor.
[39:33] And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord,
[39:37] if the Lord be with us, then you tell me
[39:41] why all this has happened in our life.
[39:45] If God is really with us, why are we in
[39:48] the condition that we're in? Why are we
[39:49] facing? Why are we going through what
[39:51] we're going through in our lives?
[39:57] And if the Lord is with us, then why
[39:58] isn't he giving us a miracle to get us
[40:00] out of this situation?
[40:03] like being shortsighted that the
[40:06] children of Israel had deafly left the
[40:09] Lord.
[40:11] And when you leave the Lord, bad things
[40:13] happen in your life.
[40:16] You don't get a prosperous ending,
[40:22] saying, "Did not the Lord bring us up
[40:24] out of the land of Egypt? But now the
[40:27] Lord have forsaken us and delivered us
[40:29] into the hands of the Midionites." What
[40:31] a testimony.
[40:33] And a lot of times we can get that
[40:35] testimony
[40:38] that the Lord has forsaken us. And I'm
[40:40] telling you, the Lord never forsakes his
[40:42] people. Never. Never. Never. Never.
[40:45] Never.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Never has happened in the history of all
[40:48] history.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; But we have forsaken the Lord. We have
[40:53] left the Lord. We have backsliden. But
[40:55] God never leaves us. Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And the Lord looked upon him and said,
[41:00] "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt
[41:05] save Israel from the hand of the
[41:07] Minionites. Have not I sent thee.
[41:12] Amen."
[41:17] In other words, Gideon, pay attention to
[41:19] who's with you
[41:22] &gt;&gt; because that's all that matters. When
[41:23] you realize that God's with you, then
[41:26] you can believe all things are possible.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; But if you have to think that you have
[41:30] to come up with answers how to fix your
[41:33] problem,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; how to get through this situation all in
[41:36] your own ability, I'm telling you, there
[41:38] is the problem.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Our trust is in the Lord.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; God will see us through.
[41:47] And all of our lives, we have things
[41:49] that befall us from time to time. How
[41:51] many have something today that is in
[41:54] your life that has befallen you?
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God has allowed things in our
[41:59] life.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; And
[42:02] you know, God doesn't have weenies.
[42:06] What does that mean, brother John? He
[42:09] doesn't have babies.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; There's no babies in heaven.
[42:16] He's not marrying a baby.
[42:18] We may come into Christ as a babe in
[42:21] Christ, but we grow up.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, our character changes.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have anything to do with our
[42:30] age.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Tell you can be more mature in Christ at
[42:37] 13 years old than you can at a man at 60
[42:40] years old.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; It's a truth
[42:45] because it's about overcoming.
[42:48] And some people don't like overcoming.
[42:51] They like blaming other people why they
[42:53] haven't overcame.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; So we have things in our life because
[43:00] God wants to see us overcome.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; We have trials. We count it all joy
[43:05] because in this our faith can grow.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; We can we can meet God in our trial
[43:12] because I think brother Ron said it's
[43:15] easy to worship God when everything's
[43:16] going good.
[43:18] But when you when things are down in the
[43:20] dumps and there's nothing really going
[43:22] in your favor and you praise God, there
[43:24] shows something. There's something
[43:26] deeper inside of you.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Because most people worship God upon
[43:30] feelings and emotions and how they're
[43:32] doing that day and whether they had a
[43:34] good day. You know what? I'm going to
[43:35] I'm going to act like everything's good.
[43:36] I'm going to whistle Dixie.
[43:40] But I'll tell you when you can just live
[43:42] a life of praise.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; It's just genuine. You know, you can't
[43:48] tell if a person's going through a trial
[43:50] or if he's not going through a trial.
[43:52] He's still the same.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; And and that is what God is looking for
[43:56] us to become. So, we all have things
[43:58] that befalls from time to time where
[44:00] something bad happens. it's a tragedy or
[44:03] something hits us out of nowhere and we
[44:05] find ourselves thinking or asking the
[44:06] questions, if the Lord be with us, then
[44:09] why has this situation happened to us?
[44:14] Where is his miracle to take us out of
[44:16] here? Where is the Lord? We're we ponder
[44:18] where is the Lord? How many times we
[44:20] come in the church and we ask where's
[44:22] the Lord?
[44:25] Maybe we're we're wanting something to
[44:27] be ministered on. we're wanting
[44:28] something to be something more direct
[44:30] and we're saying, "Well, where's the
[44:31] Lord? I didn't see the Lord in that." Or
[44:34] maybe because we're not feeling good.
[44:36] We're not feeling encouraged that we we
[44:38] missed the Lord.
[44:41] Or or because we um you know, we we we
[44:44] had some some trial. We didn't even have
[44:46] have time to prepare for service or we
[44:49] come in, we just say, "Well, I just
[44:50] didn't really feel the Lord here." Am I
[44:53] speaking to anybody today?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[44:55] I'll preach it anyways because I know
[44:57] it's the truth.
[45:00] You know, God sent a prophet in this age
[45:02] and that and this prophet was to
[45:04] vindicate that God is not just still the
[45:09] same yesterday, today, and forever,
[45:10] which is a true statement,
[45:14] but that God is where his word is
[45:16] honored.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you believe the word
[45:21] that's preached,
[45:23] &gt;&gt; that God is there. Now, how did he
[45:25] vindicate that? He vindicated it with a
[45:26] prophet to discern the thoughts intents
[45:29] of people's hearts because who else did
[45:32] it?
[45:34] I mean, there have been miracles of
[45:37] healings, but in this man's ministry,
[45:40] there was no man on the planet since
[45:42] Jesus Christ that ever had the ministry
[45:44] of William Brandon. Not even close.
[45:46] Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying certain ministers didn't
[45:51] have certain things that, but I'm
[45:53] talking about as a whole.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; And God sent this one wave sheep to
[45:58] vindicate that his word is the same.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; It is the same today for your life, for
[46:05] my life.
[46:08] So we can have confidence in the Bible.
[46:14] So that whatever the word says, we know
[46:16] it's true because all the other churches
[46:19] didn't preach that.
[46:23] They preached the days the miracles are
[46:25] passed or they you don't have to do
[46:26] this. It always this you only have to do
[46:28] the important thing. NEVER TELLING US
[46:31] THAT GOD LOVES HIS WHOLE WORD and he's
[46:34] never changing on it.
[46:36] So God sent a prophet to let us know
[46:38] that this word is is is true and that
[46:42] he's always where this truth is being
[46:45] preached.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Now since William Brandham's come
[46:53] there's never been another ministry like
[46:56] his.
[46:57] But there don't need to be
[47:01] because we already have the vindication.
[47:05] We don't need it vindicated anymore. All
[47:08] we need to do is believe the vindication
[47:11] when he God sent it.
[47:17] So God is always here.
[47:22] The fact remains that God is always with
[47:25] his people. He never leaves them. He's
[47:28] always there. And I'll just say it like
[47:30] this. He's here.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; He is here right now. right now. He is
[47:36] here.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel him.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; The invisible God is here. The creator,
[47:46] thinking about it, of heaven and of
[47:47] earth. He is here this morning. The very
[47:50] one that spoke the world into existence.
[47:53] He's here among us.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Who through faith spoke all things to an
[47:59] existence. who frame the word of God,
[48:01] the worlds by the word of God, so that
[48:03] the things which are seen uh are were
[48:05] not made of things which do appear. So
[48:08] the so the invisible God became flesh,
[48:12] dwelt among us, went to Calvary for our
[48:15] sins in the in the form now he's here
[48:18] this morning in the form of the Holy
[48:20] Ghost. The very God that died at Calvary
[48:23] is here this morning.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; It's not history we're talking about.
[48:28] We're talking about the I am God, the
[48:31] everpresent God. He's here, the one who
[48:35] not only forgave us of our sins, but
[48:37] he's here today to forgive us of our
[48:39] sins if we just ask for forgiveness.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; He's faithful and just to forgive us of
[48:46] all of our unrighteousness.
[48:48] Our advocate, he's here. The very God
[48:52] who's rich in mercy for his great love
[48:54] wherewith he loved us. And he's caused
[48:56] us to to sit together in heavenly
[48:59] places. That God is here today. He just
[49:02] doesn't want us sitting on a pew. He
[49:04] wants us sitting up IN IN A HEAVENLY
[49:06] REALM WITH HIM, CAUGHT UP IN THE WORD
[49:08] THAT'S being ministered to us.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we come into the
[49:13] church and we just don't even care.
[49:21] Now, how is God going to care for you
[49:26] when you don't care for him?
[49:28] Brother Brandon preached that message.
[49:30] He cares. Do you care?
[49:33] Our body's five senses
[49:36] do not declare him to be here today. We
[49:39] don't see him. We don't hear him. We
[49:41] don't smell him. We don't feel him.
[49:44] our conscious, our memory, our
[49:45] affection, our imagination, our
[49:47] reasoning. They may not declare that
[49:50] he's here today. But there is one thing
[49:52] that should declare him here today and
[49:55] that's our faith.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Our faith because the word says it and I
[50:02] believe the word.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Forget about what kind of day you had,
[50:08] &gt;&gt; kind of week you had.
[50:11] Forget about everything except one
[50:14] thing. God is here. And he's here
[50:17] because he
[50:20] he loves me. He wants to help me and
[50:24] meet my needs and draw me closer to him
[50:27] and help me to know him more
[50:30] and to see me through the things that
[50:32] have befallen me.
[50:35] But without faith now, it's impossible
[50:38] to please God.
[50:43] Have you ever you ever remember I'm sure
[50:45] has anybody ever experienced this
[50:47] talking to your spouse and you know
[50:48] they're not happy with you.
[50:51] You know they're not pleased with you.
[50:54] You know what I'm talking about, right?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Well, if you sit in church and you don't
[50:58] have faith, God is looking that way at
[51:01] you.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So, it's a fearful thing to fall in the
[51:07] hands of a living God. We need to have
[51:09] faith when we come into God's house. We
[51:11] need to have faith when we approach God,
[51:14] not approach him in fear of, oh, I I
[51:19] don't have faith. It'd be better to just
[51:22] get on your knees and repent. Repent of
[51:24] all the unbelief and all the garbage.
[51:28] Amen.
[51:29] That you may approach God and say, "I
[51:32] believe your word.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you at your word,
[51:35] Lord. You're not a man to lie.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; You're not a man to come short. You're
[51:41] not someone that has failed anybody on
[51:43] the planet.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; There's nobody that's going to stand on
[51:47] the day of judgment and says, "I caught
[51:49] you."
[51:56] &gt;&gt; God is true blue.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He that cometh to God must believe that
[52:03] he is
[52:05] and that he's a rewarder to them that
[52:07] are diligent about seeking him.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; You know, it's not about coming to
[52:11] church twice. It's about living for God
[52:14] every day.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Every day,
[52:17] God, what would you have me to do?
[52:20] God is here. Faith in him and in his
[52:24] word is the only thing that would
[52:26] declare him because the other gates
[52:29] won't do it. I would love to, you know,
[52:31] a lot of people they if there if there's
[52:33] a good show, if there's a good concert,
[52:34] if there's a good feeling, you know,
[52:36] there's encouragement, there's um funny,
[52:39] there's, you know, you just feel good.
[52:41] Yeah, that was a good one.
[52:45] But what's good is when the word is
[52:48] revealed to you,
[52:50] when you're in contact with the word
[52:53] because the word is God. He said, "Upon
[52:55] this rock, I will build my church." So,
[52:58] who cares if you feel good?
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Feeling good can only be a distract
[53:05] could could just be a distraction to be
[53:07] honest with you.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; But upon this rock is what I'm
[53:12] interested in.
[53:16] I'm interested in getting closer to God.
[53:20] Imagine there was a dog tied up
[53:22] somewhere in the church.
[53:26] I get your attention now. See that? Just
[53:28] a simple thing about a dog being tied up
[53:30] in church. And everybody wants to listen
[53:32] to me for the first time this morning.
[53:37] Now, we know he wouldn't be able to run
[53:39] around until someone let him loose. Is
[53:42] that true?
[53:47] Without faith, God has handcuffs on
[53:51] and he cannot move in your situation.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; He can't help us.
[53:59] Faith is the only thing that unlocks the
[54:01] handcuffs of God to actually help you
[54:03] personally.
[54:05] Otherwise, he's here. He's invisible.
[54:09] He's here
[54:11] and he's waiting for somebody to believe
[54:12] on him.
[54:14] Someone that will take him at his word.
[54:17] someone that's will say I'm going to
[54:19] unlock God for my life personally
[54:24] &gt;&gt; because we're not about let's do this is
[54:27] I understand when God sent the prophet
[54:30] I'm telling you
[54:33] millions of people
[54:36] long to see that gift in operation
[54:41] and who won it and who won
[54:46] But it's not needed anymore
[54:50] because if it was then God would have
[54:53] every ministry doing it.
[54:55] But he didn't say that. He just said in
[54:58] the days of the voice of the seventh
[54:59] angel. He just said that he would raise
[55:02] up a prophet to do these things.
[55:11] God didn't send 1,000 Jeremiah's or
[55:14] 1,000 Elijah's
[55:17] everything or 10,000 John the Baptist to
[55:20] vindicate that. Yeah, here's Jesus, the
[55:23] Messiah, the lamb of God. He just sent
[55:25] one. And if you didn't pay attention to
[55:27] him, you probably missed it.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; We don't need that anymore. What we're
[55:34] where God is LOOKING FOR IN THE CHURCH
[55:36] today is somebody to believe the word
[55:40] &gt;&gt; take him at HIS WORD
[55:42] &gt;&gt; TO VALUE THE WORD NOT THE gift
[55:47] &gt;&gt; because God is the one that gives the
[55:49] gifts
[55:50] &gt;&gt; but the word is to everybody.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That means everybody can be on the same
[55:54] page AT THE SAME TIME believing the same
[55:57] way.
[56:00] Faith makes God real for our situations.
[56:06] Faith in God will move him in our lives.
[56:12] And doubt will cause him to just stand
[56:14] still. So if you're ever wondering if
[56:17] God's really with us, then what's going
[56:18] on?
[56:20] Maybe he's waiting for you to have
[56:23] faith.
[56:25] Put the responsibility on your
[56:26] shoulders.
[56:28] Don't don't be blaming other people,
[56:30] other situations, you know, how you're
[56:34] feeling.
[56:36] Faith has nothing to do with feelings.
[56:38] It's a different gate.
[56:42] Faith doesn't feel.
[56:45] Faith is faith.
[56:50] Now, we want to make our feelings faith.
[56:54] Listen to a good song. Start tapping the
[56:56] feet.
[56:58] I like this one. Oh yeah, I feel like
[57:00] going to church tonight.
[57:06] You know there I'm just just speaking
[57:09] the word.
[57:12] How many wants to exercise your faith?
[57:16] Hey, this is it right now. you hear the
[57:18] word, say, "I am going to I'm going to
[57:22] start believing the word." Because
[57:25] that'll draw you closer to God like
[57:27] you've never been before.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; And it's not that we don't
[57:32] intellectually believe the word, because
[57:34] we do, but so does the devils.
[57:38] They got the same testimony.
[57:41] But the testimony that we're looking for
[57:42] is believing with our life.
[57:48] like this word is precious to me. Like I
[57:51] don't want to cross it anymore. Like I
[57:53] want to spend some more time thinking
[57:55] about how I can better please the Lord.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Mark 9:23 Jesus said, "If thou canst
[58:03] believe, all things are possible to him
[58:07] that believeth."
[58:09] Nothing to do about feelings, nothing to
[58:11] do about understanding, nothing to do
[58:13] about being a good person.
[58:16] No, nothing about anything except Lord,
[58:20] I choose right now to believe
[58:22] and God can move in your behalf. But
[58:25] remember, all things are possible for
[58:27] you if you believe. But without faith,
[58:33] God's just not pleased. I mean, you
[58:37] children, have you ever looked at your
[58:39] mother or your father and saw that they
[58:41] were unhappy with you? Yeah. You know
[58:44] how they look, right? It doesn't make
[58:46] you go, "Yeah."
[58:49] No, you know you're in trouble.
[58:54] But when God's like kiss, I don't see.
[58:58] All I see is complaining. All I see is
[59:00] murmuring.
[59:02] Just giving the devil glory about how
[59:05] bad things are in your life.
[59:09] God's not pleased with that.
[59:11] God wants somebody to rise up in the
[59:13] midst of their situation and say, "I'm a
[59:16] believer.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not just someone that calls myself a
[59:20] Christian. I actually am going to live a
[59:22] life of believing in God and trusting
[59:24] God in my situation."
[59:29] When we're looking to see if the Lord be
[59:31] with us, the only way to look at him is
[59:33] through faith.
[59:35] It's by counting those things which are
[59:37] not as though they already are. God is
[59:41] always, always, always, and I say always
[59:44] with us. Do not doubt that.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; If you realize just for a second that
[59:50] God is really here,
[59:54] it changes your whole perspective.
[59:59] Like if all of us could see that Jesus
[1:00:01] was sitting right over here in this
[1:00:02] seat,
[1:00:04] everybody look over here.
[1:00:07] [laughter]
[1:00:10] If we could literally see Jesus in that
[1:00:12] seat.
[1:00:17] When he said amen, we would say amen.
[1:00:21] And we would brother, would you hurry
[1:00:24] because I want to talk to Jesus after
[1:00:25] service. I want him to pray for me
[1:00:28] personally.
[1:00:31] Your perspective would change if you
[1:00:33] knew if you saw Jesus here.
[1:00:37] And your perspective changes when you
[1:00:39] really believe that his presence is
[1:00:41] here.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And it's not just about church, but you
[1:00:47] need to believe that he's with you in
[1:00:49] your home,
[1:00:50] that he's with you in the car.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And when you start believing like that,
[1:01:01] then it's just a matter of say your
[1:01:03] prayer and hold to it.
[1:01:07] Not where's he at? Where is he at? Where
[1:01:09] is he at?
[1:01:13] If you need to ask the question, what
[1:01:15] have I done to get away from the Lord, I
[1:01:19] think that's okay
[1:01:21] because God's never going to leave you.
[1:01:24] But the prophet did tell us that we can
[1:01:27] leave the Lord. And he also said you'll
[1:01:30] find him exactly where you left him.
[1:01:35] So if you just want to get back, I think
[1:01:37] that's what prayer and you know, brother
[1:01:38] Bam, he often rededicated his life to
[1:01:40] the Lord.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to pray and say, "God,
[1:01:44] I need you."
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Wasn't like he was a bad prophet.
[1:01:51] He's our wave sheath.
[1:01:56] He wanted a closer walk with God. He
[1:01:58] wanted to be close to God.
[1:02:01] God is always with us.
[1:02:07] Turn with me if you would to Deuteronomy
[1:02:09] chapter 31. We just have a few
[1:02:11] scriptures, but you know how that goes.
[1:02:16] It never goes the way I want it to go.
[1:02:21] Deuteronomy chapter 31,
[1:02:24] we're going to start with verse number
[1:02:26] one.
[1:02:34] That's the fifth book from the
[1:02:35] beginning.
[1:02:43] Starting with verse number one. And
[1:02:44] Moses went and he spake these words unto
[1:02:47] all Israel.
[1:02:50] And he said unto them, I am 120 years
[1:02:54] old this day.
[1:02:59] I can no more go out and come in. Also,
[1:03:04] the Lord hath said unto me, thou shalt
[1:03:05] not go over this Jordan.
[1:03:07] Brother Bman, we still got some years of
[1:03:10] our life before we hit 120.
[1:03:16] But he finally reached to a place that
[1:03:18] he just could not physically function
[1:03:22] anymore. Go in and come out.
[1:03:27] And he says also the Lord said unto me,
[1:03:30] thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
[1:03:34] The Lord thy God, he will go over before
[1:03:38] thee, and he will destroy these nations
[1:03:41] from before thee, and shall possess
[1:03:43] them. And Joshua he shall go over before
[1:03:46] thee, as the Lord hath said. And the
[1:03:49] Lord thy God, and the Lord shall do unto
[1:03:52] them, as he did to Shyon and Og, kings
[1:03:55] of the Amorites, and unto the land uh of
[1:03:58] them whom he destroyed. and the Lord
[1:04:02] shall give them up before your face that
[1:04:04] ye may do unto them according to all the
[1:04:06] commandments which I commanded
[1:04:09] you. So the prophet Moses is telling
[1:04:12] Israel that God is going to destroy our
[1:04:16] enemy. Now here's the thing. This is
[1:04:18] what we must believe for our lives and
[1:04:20] our all of our enemies. And and it
[1:04:23] doesn't matter if they're habits,
[1:04:26] I if they're thoughts,
[1:04:29] um
[1:04:31] whatever your enemy is. And your enemy
[1:04:33] is anything that keeps you from loving
[1:04:34] God with all your heart. That's who your
[1:04:37] enemy is.
[1:04:43] So this promise is on to us. Verse six.
[1:04:48] So he says that we're to be strong and
[1:04:51] of good courage. Do not fear. Don't be
[1:04:55] afraid of them. For the Lord thy God, he
[1:04:59] it is that doth go with thee. He will
[1:05:03] not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
[1:05:06] So the enemy is going to be destroyed.
[1:05:09] And and what he's what Moses is telling
[1:05:12] all of Israel is that God is with you.
[1:05:17] The key was recognizing that God is with
[1:05:19] you. The same as recognizing God's
[1:05:22] presence in your life.
[1:05:25] When you know God is with you, I mean,
[1:05:26] who's going to stand against you? If God
[1:05:28] be for us, who can be against us?
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But if the devil can get you to think
[1:05:33] that God's not with you,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; then you'll be scaredy bones.
[1:05:43] The key is to truly believe that God is
[1:05:47] with you in your in your life.
[1:05:51] God cannot lie. He promises to be with
[1:05:54] him. He promises not to forsake them. It
[1:05:57] is God that goeth with thee. Brother
[1:06:00] Brandham said he is here among us even
[1:06:04] though we can't see him. That's what the
[1:06:05] prophet said.
[1:06:07] Now the evidence that God is with you
[1:06:13] is the victory.
[1:06:18] That is the evidence that God is with
[1:06:20] you.
[1:06:21] Otherwise, God is here waiting for you
[1:06:25] to believe.
[1:06:30] And what is the victory, brother Stan?
[1:06:32] The Bible tells us, "This is the victory
[1:06:35] that overcometh the world, even your
[1:06:38] faith."
[1:06:41] It's you believing that God will move in
[1:06:44] your behalf.
[1:06:46] That God will will remove the enemy out
[1:06:49] of out of your life, that you can serve
[1:06:51] God with a a clear, sound mind, with
[1:06:54] power and love, that you can be
[1:06:56] everything that God has called you to
[1:06:58] be. Because you know most people in the
[1:07:00] world, you know why they want God? For
[1:07:02] what they can get out of them.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Not the bride.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; But the bride is the only one that has a
[1:07:13] true love affair with God.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; See the other people, they say, "Well, I
[1:07:20] want God. I want God. And I love God."
[1:07:23] They even say they love God. And the
[1:07:25] Bible say, "You can love God every day
[1:07:26] and still go to hell.
[1:07:29] They love God for what they can get out
[1:07:30] of God.
[1:07:32] And they love God with their emotions
[1:07:33] and their feelings.
[1:07:36] And they like how it feels when God's
[1:07:37] presence is there.
[1:07:39] And and they like to dance and speak in
[1:07:41] tongues and do all these things.
[1:07:45] They even like when people look at them
[1:07:47] and they're performing for God.
[1:07:50] But in reality
[1:07:53] to the bride, they're of no reputation.
[1:07:57] They know their reputation is Jesus
[1:07:59] Christ. [laughter]
[1:08:03] They have a love affair. They love the
[1:08:05] word of God. If you love me, keep my
[1:08:08] commandments.
[1:08:10] Keep my commandments.
[1:08:13] So, the evidence will literally be of
[1:08:16] victory.
[1:08:20] We're commanded to be strong, to be of
[1:08:22] good courage. Verse 7. And Moses called
[1:08:24] unto Joshua, and said unto him, in the
[1:08:26] sight of all Israel, Be strong,
[1:08:29] and of good courage,
[1:08:31] for thou must go with this people unto
[1:08:35] the land which the Lord hath sworn unto
[1:08:37] their fathers to give them, and thou
[1:08:39] shalt cause them to inherit it. And the
[1:08:42] Lord, he is,
[1:08:44] he is that doth go before thee. He will
[1:08:48] be with thee. He will not fail thee,
[1:08:50] neither forsake thee. Fear not, neither
[1:08:53] be dismayed.
[1:08:56] God is here this morning among us.
[1:09:00] Only believe, all things are possible.
[1:09:07] I think if we could just start
[1:09:09] testifying, God is with me. God is with
[1:09:11] me.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I trust God.
[1:09:14] I'm going to see things move in my
[1:09:17] behalf. Why? Not because I'm great. I
[1:09:19] got it figured out. But because I'm
[1:09:21] trusting God,
[1:09:23] God's going to go before me. He's going
[1:09:26] to fight my battle. The only thing he's
[1:09:28] asked me to do is stay true to his word.
[1:09:32] Just stay with the word. The word says
[1:09:35] love him with all my heart, I'm going to
[1:09:36] love him with all my heart.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; If the word says meditate day and night,
[1:09:42] I'm going to spend time reading the word
[1:09:44] of God.
[1:09:45] And you know, a lot of times I remember
[1:09:47] I I did have some kids
[1:09:50] um and we used to have Bible studies
[1:09:55] and I do remember having Bible studies
[1:09:57] and I remember some of the kids not
[1:10:01] wanting to be in the Bible study,
[1:10:04] but they just they just sat there, but
[1:10:06] they never entered in. And I could tell
[1:10:09] that
[1:10:11] that's not what gets the attention of
[1:10:14] God. What gets the attention of God is
[1:10:17] really wanting to know God.
[1:10:20] Your heart has to be there at whatever
[1:10:22] age you are. Your heart has to be there.
[1:10:26] If the heart's not there, it's called
[1:10:28] religion.
[1:10:30] Brother Brandham said that's like the
[1:10:32] bark of a tree. The real life is on the
[1:10:34] inside.
[1:10:37] And we don't we don't really care about
[1:10:38] how, you know, people view us. What we
[1:10:43] really care about is having a sincere
[1:10:45] relationship with God.
[1:10:47] And it all starts with believing that
[1:10:49] God is with you in those Bible studies.
[1:10:52] God is with you in your home. God is
[1:10:54] with you in the Sunday school class. God
[1:10:56] is with you in the prayer closet. God is
[1:10:58] with you. Even if the whole family is
[1:11:01] blowing up, I'm telling you, if you
[1:11:03] believe in God, he'll be right there.
[1:11:05] Amen. because it's between you and God.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he prepares a table
[1:11:12] before us in the presence of our
[1:11:14] enemies. That means God is not afraid of
[1:11:16] your enemies.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; God is not afraid of your situation.
[1:11:22] God just wants you to stand up, be bold,
[1:11:25] and say, "For me and my house, we're
[1:11:27] going to serve the Lord.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Though none go with me, still I'll
[1:11:33] follow."
[1:11:35] All right, let's turn to another
[1:11:37] scripture. Let's go to Joshua chapter 1.
[1:11:39] We're going to see this same spirit move
[1:11:43] from Moses now over to Joshua.
[1:11:47] Joshua chapter 1, I'm going to start
[1:11:49] also with verse number one. And now
[1:11:51] after the death of Moses, the servant of
[1:11:54] the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord
[1:11:56] spake unto Joshua, the son of Nun,
[1:12:00] Moses's minister, saying, Moses, my
[1:12:03] servant, is dead. Now therefore, arise,
[1:12:08] you have a part to play. go over this
[1:12:12] Jordan, thou and all this people, unto
[1:12:15] the land which I do give them, even to
[1:12:19] the children of Israel. Now he gives it
[1:12:21] to them.
[1:12:38] Anybody want some water?
[1:12:41] Huh?
[1:12:43] [laughter]
[1:12:44] John, what are you trying to do? Ree,
[1:12:45] you want this water?
[1:12:48] I give it to you. You're going to need
[1:12:50] it someday.
[1:12:52] Here.
[1:12:56] How about you?
[1:13:00] It's You got to take it.
[1:13:04] You got to take it.
[1:13:10] It's not easy, but if the Lord promised
[1:13:14] it to you, you'll have it.
[1:13:17] You can expect everything just to be put
[1:13:19] on your lap.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; There's things that we need to get rid
[1:13:24] of our life.
[1:13:27] The kingdom of God suffer violent. The
[1:13:29] violent taketh it by force.
[1:13:32] And we got to get, we know the devil is
[1:13:35] trying to keep us
[1:13:38] from getting the joy of the Lord.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Keep us from getting our healings, keep
[1:13:42] us from victory.
[1:13:45] And we got to get in there and just say,
[1:13:46] "It's mine." We sing it. It is mine.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Victory is mine.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; But we got to leave here with that
[1:13:53] attitude, right? I think we got to leave
[1:13:55] here with that song in our mind and our
[1:13:57] in our thoughts and say, "I'm going
[1:14:00] after more of the land."
[1:14:02] It it's it's not about just I'm in a
[1:14:04] church that believes the truth.
[1:14:07] You've been you're here because God has
[1:14:09] given you the opportunity to receive him
[1:14:11] into your life because he is truth. And
[1:14:15] it's not the knowledge of the Bible that
[1:14:17] we're looking for. Is Jesus said, "My
[1:14:19] words are spirit and they're alive."
[1:14:22] We're we're here to receive the life of
[1:14:24] the word because it's upon that life
[1:14:26] that he's building the church.
[1:14:31] All right? So he says here in verse
[1:14:33] number three, every place that the soul
[1:14:37] of your feet shall tread upon, that have
[1:14:41] I given you, as I said unto Moses. All
[1:14:43] right, let's stand together.
[1:14:49] I want everybody to take some steps.
[1:14:56] move like two or three feet from your
[1:14:58] chair.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Now, wherever you're walking, that now
[1:15:03] belongs to you.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; But if you just sit there, which you
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; you're not going to get it.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So, just tell the devil
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER. Because
[1:15:20] remember
[1:15:22] the God has already given it to you.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; So your confidence is that it's already
[1:15:28] been given, not that you have to fight
[1:15:30] for it.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; That's nothing.
[1:15:34] It's not about your abilities. It's
[1:15:37] about your faith in a God that's already
[1:15:38] given it to you.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; He loves you. That's why he's given you
[1:15:41] the promised land.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; All right. You may be seated.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. We're going to have an opening
[1:15:47] scripture now. We're going to go another
[1:15:48] hour.
[1:15:53] So God goes there in verse four and he
[1:15:55] defines the the boundaries of the the
[1:15:57] borders of the promised land. He says
[1:15:59] from the wilderness of this Lebanon even
[1:16:01] to the great river of the river
[1:16:02] Euphrates and all the land of the
[1:16:03] Hittites and unto the great sea toward
[1:16:06] the going down of the sun shall be your
[1:16:09] coast. God he declares our safety
[1:16:13] because of his commitment towards us in
[1:16:15] verse five. There shall not any man be
[1:16:20] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:16:23] of thy life.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Wow, what a promise.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe with all my heart there
[1:16:29] were many people that the devil anointed
[1:16:32] that went after Joshua from that point
[1:16:36] forward.
[1:16:39] So, it wasn't like Joshua wasn't going
[1:16:40] to have any battles,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; but he knew that none would be able to
[1:16:44] take him down. That's right.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; That is the God that saved us.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE God that HAS REDEEMED US.
[1:16:52] THAT IS THE GOD THAT HAS CALLED us to
[1:16:54] perfection.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE GOD THAT'S GOING TO PUT US
[1:16:56] IN RAPTURE. IT ISN'T US. IT ISN'T OUR
[1:16:59] ABILITIES.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; PETER WAS ANOR AND UNLEARNED. HE HAD THE
[1:17:02] KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; It's all about trusting in a God who's
[1:17:07] promised us.
[1:17:12] As I was with Moses, so I will be with
[1:17:14] thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake
[1:17:18] thee.
[1:17:20] As God was with Moses,
[1:17:23] as God was with Peter and Paul and
[1:17:27] Elijah and Smith Wigglesworth and
[1:17:30] brother Brandham. So God will be with
[1:17:33] you as well.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't stop because your name is John
[1:17:38] Martin.
[1:17:41] He said, "Whoa, whoa, WAIT. THIS THAT'S
[1:17:43] RON CLAYTON. I STOPPED." NO, GOD IS WITH
[1:17:46] RON CLAYTON.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REALNESS OF THIS MESSAGE.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That he is the same.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; He's just wanting us to believe
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; that he'll DO IT FOR OUR LIVES.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; To trust him
[1:18:03] that he is the same FOR US AS HE was for
[1:18:05] what Smith Wigglesworth.
[1:18:11] Now, everybody obviously can't be a
[1:18:13] Smith Wigglesworth,
[1:18:16] but God can be with us the same.
[1:18:19] And did you know God cares about us the
[1:18:21] same?
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if we haven't performed
[1:18:27] miracles. God loves us the same
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; and we're still part of the bride.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And the relationship is just as close if
[1:18:36] we believe him. just as much.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; It's just hard to have a close
[1:18:40] relationship with God if you don't
[1:18:42] believe.
[1:18:44] It's just
[1:18:51] JJ, can you imagine going a whole week
[1:18:54] and mom and dad's not happy with you
[1:18:57] because you refused to do their
[1:19:01] commandments? Didn't take out the
[1:19:03] garbage, didn't wash the dishes, didn't
[1:19:05] sweep the the sidewalk.
[1:19:09] And every time mom and dad sees you,
[1:19:12] they go,
[1:19:18] it's hard to go and talk to your friends
[1:19:20] at school on Friday and say, "Oh, yeah.
[1:19:22] I have a close relationship with my mom
[1:19:23] and dad."
[1:19:26] Because you don't feel it.
[1:19:31] And we know we don't feel we have a
[1:19:33] close relationship with God when we're
[1:19:36] not trusting him in our life.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; We get in the flesh and we just start
[1:19:45] murmuring and complaining and talking
[1:19:48] negative and thinking negative and and
[1:19:51] before you know it,
[1:19:54] we don't really feel we have a close
[1:19:56] relationship with God, but the
[1:19:57] circumstance comes out right, we'll
[1:19:59] start acting like it.
[1:20:03] It's a form.
[1:20:05] Those are peacock feathers.
[1:20:09] God is looking for someone to come in
[1:20:11] the church and show that he is their
[1:20:17] Lord.
[1:20:22] that you truly believe that God is here
[1:20:26] and that you're here for a purpose
[1:20:29] and that you're determined to leave with
[1:20:31] more land than when you got here.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; That you're not going empty-handed.
[1:20:38] You're not coming just to fulfill I went
[1:20:41] to church.
[1:20:43] That there's some substance waiting for
[1:20:44] you and that you're not going to be
[1:20:47] denied.
[1:20:48] Verse six, be strong and be of good
[1:20:51] courage. For unto this people shalt thou
[1:20:54] divide for inheritance
[1:20:56] the land which I swear unto their
[1:20:58] fathers to give them. I say this
[1:21:02] generation, God is going to separate,
[1:21:07] pull a bride out of the Gentiles for a
[1:21:09] rapture.
[1:21:13] And this is what the bride must be
[1:21:14] doing. Verse seven, only be thou strong,
[1:21:19] very courageous,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; very courageous,
[1:21:24] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:21:28] to all that all the law which Moses my
[1:21:32] servant commanded. Turn not from it to
[1:21:35] the right hand or to the left, that thou
[1:21:38] mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[1:21:43] Now, do you see the joy in coming to
[1:21:45] church?
[1:21:48] Coming to church to find out how I can
[1:21:51] prosper in my life,
[1:21:55] how I can do the next thing that God
[1:21:57] wants me to do.
[1:22:01] This book of the law shall not depart
[1:22:03] out of thy mouth, but thou shalt
[1:22:04] meditate therein day and night, thou
[1:22:07] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:22:09] to all that is written therein. For then
[1:22:11] thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and
[1:22:13] then thou shalt have good success. Have
[1:22:15] not I commanded you. Be strong and of
[1:22:18] good courage. Be not afraid, neither be
[1:22:20] dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with
[1:22:22] thee, whether with thee, whethersoever
[1:22:26] thou goest. I want you to remember this
[1:22:30] in your life today.
[1:22:34] Don't complain
[1:22:37] and don't say anything negative about
[1:22:39] your situation. Don't think negative
[1:22:41] about your situation.
[1:22:43] What I want you to say is the Lord my
[1:22:46] God is with me wherever I go.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I want you to Okay. How many's ever
[1:22:54] worked out before?
[1:23:00] Why did you stop
[1:23:06] when you worked out
[1:23:11] the first week? Tell me how easy it was.
[1:23:16] Very hard. I don't care what you're
[1:23:17] doing. I don't care if you're running. I
[1:23:19] don't care what you're working out. It's
[1:23:21] not easy because you're not used to
[1:23:23] exercising those muscles. And if you're
[1:23:26] not used to exercising, be strong. Be
[1:23:28] courageous. The Lord is with me. If
[1:23:31] you're not used to exercising that, it's
[1:23:34] going to seem hard and difficult. You're
[1:23:36] going to feel like a hypocrite. You're
[1:23:37] going to feel, "This is odd. This is not
[1:23:39] me."
[1:23:42] Well, what you want to say is, "I'm not
[1:23:43] murmuring anymore. I'm not complaining
[1:23:45] anymore. I'm not going to think negative
[1:23:47] anything more about my situations.
[1:23:51] I'm going to start trusting the Lord."
[1:23:55] But what happens after about a week or
[1:23:57] two?
[1:24:01] It's a little bit easier your workout.
[1:24:05] In other words, you feel more
[1:24:06] comfortable coming to church and saying,
[1:24:08] "Praise the Lord. I love Jesus today.
[1:24:12] God's been so good to me."
[1:24:15] Because you're used to it. You've
[1:24:17] exercised the right things.
[1:24:21] and and and God is telling Joshua to
[1:24:23] exercise courage.
[1:24:28] Exercise the the fact that God is always
[1:24:31] with me. It's no longer God is over
[1:24:34] there and I'm over here doing my thing.
[1:24:36] God is with me.
[1:24:38] If God isn't with me, I'm going to get
[1:24:39] him with me because I don't want to go
[1:24:41] another day without him.
[1:24:44] Amen.
[1:24:46] God is here to do exceedingly above all
[1:24:50] that we could ask or even think. Matthew
[1:24:51] chapter 28:16. We have half of our
[1:24:54] message to do in seven minutes. Now, how
[1:24:57] is that going to happen?
[1:25:00] I need to study and how
[1:25:04] to study.
[1:25:06] [laughter]
[1:25:08] I need to study how to properly study.
[1:25:14] But there's definitely lots of stuff
[1:25:16] we're not going to be able to do.
[1:25:20] Hebrew or uh Matthew 28:16
[1:25:25] here the 11 disciples went uh then the
[1:25:29] 11 disciples went away into Galilee into
[1:25:31] a mountain where Jesus had appointed
[1:25:34] them. And when they saw him, they
[1:25:36] worshiped him. But some doubted. Okay,
[1:25:39] so they were having a Bible study. Some
[1:25:41] believe, some are doubting. We're going
[1:25:43] to church. Some are believing. Some are
[1:25:45] doubting. Just a the reality of life,
[1:25:49] you know, where we're where where God
[1:25:51] goes, the devil likes to go. But he's
[1:25:54] going there with a different purpose. He
[1:25:57] wants to block people from believing.
[1:26:00] And Jesus came and he spake unto them,
[1:26:02] saying, "All power is given unto me in
[1:26:04] heaven and earth. Go ye therefore and
[1:26:06] teaching all nations, baptizing them in
[1:26:08] the name of the Father and the Son and
[1:26:09] of the Holy Ghost, which is the name of
[1:26:11] the Lord Jesus Christ. teaching them to
[1:26:13] observe all things whatsoever I have
[1:26:16] commanded you. Let's read this together.
[1:26:18] And lo, I am with you always, even until
[1:26:23] the end of the world. How many has been
[1:26:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus?
[1:26:28] Did you know God is with you?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; All the times you wonder where God is
[1:26:34] at, God is still there. He's waiting for
[1:26:36] you to believe that he's there still.
[1:26:42] Now, if we're going to be that group of
[1:26:44] people that just wants God, but don't
[1:26:46] want to do his commandments, we're
[1:26:48] probably not going to feel too close to
[1:26:50] him
[1:26:51] because God here in this great
[1:26:53] commission is calling us out to to share
[1:26:55] Jesus with somebody
[1:26:58] to talk to somebody about Jesus
[1:27:01] to do everything teach them everything
[1:27:03] I've taught you
[1:27:05] because now you are an extension of me.
[1:27:09] I I'm dead. I I I I'm not here, but my
[1:27:12] Holy Spirit's inside of you. Now, you go
[1:27:14] do the same thing. Share Jesus with
[1:27:16] somebody. I'm telling you, if you want
[1:27:18] to feel close to God, do his
[1:27:20] commandment.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Why was that emphasis there? Hello,
[1:27:29] I'm with you always to the end.
[1:27:33] You know what happened after the day of
[1:27:36] Pentecost?
[1:27:39] There was just a beautiful outpouring of
[1:27:41] God's spirit. Everybody was just dancing
[1:27:44] in the spirit and speaking in tongues
[1:27:46] and just had a wonderful time.
[1:27:52] And the commission was given.
[1:27:55] Now you're ready to go out. What
[1:27:56] happened when they went out?
[1:28:00] There was no parades,
[1:28:03] no fanfare.
[1:28:06] I mean, right now, you take the most
[1:28:07] famous singer. I'm telling you, they
[1:28:10] have a fan club. They have a place you
[1:28:12] can mail your letters to,
[1:28:15] and you can tell them how great they
[1:28:17] are. But these disciples didn't have
[1:28:20] fanfare.
[1:28:22] They had persecutions.
[1:28:25] All they that live godly in Christ Jesus
[1:28:27] shall suffer persecution.
[1:28:31] They needed to know through the
[1:28:33] persecution that God was going to be
[1:28:35] with them right to the end.
[1:28:38] The three Hebrew children needed to know
[1:28:40] that God was going to be with them to
[1:28:42] the end. Daniel and the lions of the the
[1:28:44] facing death needed to know God was
[1:28:46] going to be with him.
[1:28:50] David needed to know God was going to be
[1:28:52] with him. Look through everything he
[1:28:53] went through. Look what Paul went
[1:28:55] through. He he bore stripes on his back.
[1:28:59] He was stoned.
[1:29:01] God says, "I'm going to send you to the
[1:29:03] Gentiles. You know what? I'm going to
[1:29:04] have to deliver you when you go there."
[1:29:09] But God never left Paul.
[1:29:12] He never left any of his people. He is
[1:29:14] not leaving us. I don't care what the
[1:29:17] situation is. God is not leaving us. He
[1:29:21] is right here to do exceedingly above.
[1:29:23] Whatever we would ask or whatever we'd
[1:29:25] think, God is always with us.
[1:29:29] And let's stand together.
[1:29:40] He is with us always, even to the end.
[1:29:43] Let's sing that little chorus.
[1:29:46] He is here.
[1:30:01] He is here.
[1:30:04] Hallelu.
[1:30:07] He is here.
[1:30:10] Amen.
[1:30:12] He [singing and music] is here. Holy,
[1:30:16] holy. I will bless his name again.
[1:30:23] He is here.
[1:30:26] Think closely. Hear him calling out your
[1:30:32] name. He is [music]
[1:30:35] here. You can touch him and you'll never
[1:30:41] be the same.
[1:30:46] He [music] is here.
[1:30:49] Hallelu.
[1:30:52] He is here. Amen.
[1:30:57] He is [music] here. Holy, holy. I will
[1:31:03] bless his name [singing]
[1:31:06] again.
[1:31:07] He [music]
[1:31:08] is here listening closely. Hear him
[1:31:13] [singing] calling out your name. He
[1:31:18] [music] is [singing] here. You can touch
[1:31:22] him and you'll never be. Amen. Let's
[1:31:27] sing it again as we believe he's [music]
[1:31:29] here.
[1:31:31] He is here.
[1:31:34] Hallelu. [singing]
[1:31:36] [music]
[1:31:37] He is here.
[1:31:39] Amen.
[1:31:42] He is [music and singing] here.
[1:31:45] Holy, holy. I will bless his [music]
[1:31:50] name again.
[1:31:53] He is here. Listen [music]
[1:31:57] closely.
[1:31:58] Hear him calling [singing]
[1:32:01] [music] out your name. He is here. You
[1:32:07] can touch him and you'll
[1:32:10] [music and singing] never be the same.
[1:32:18] Amen. Amen. I like how that song goes.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Listen closely. He's calling out your
[1:32:25] name.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; At that point, you doesn't matter who's
[1:32:28] standing next to you,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; who's behind you, who's in front of you.
[1:32:32] What's important is that he's he's
[1:32:35] calling to you. your name.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we know that psalm touching
[1:32:41] Jesus is all that matters?
[1:32:46] Can we give it a try?
[1:32:50] Okay, that's okay. We don't have to give
[1:32:51] it a try. Let's sing. Reach out and
[1:32:54] touch the Lord.
[1:32:57] [music]
[1:33:00] Reach out and touch the Lord
[1:33:04] as he passes [music and singing] by.
[1:33:09] You'll find he's not too busy
[1:33:12] [music and singing]
[1:33:13] to hear your heart's cry.
[1:33:17] He is [music and singing] passing by
[1:33:20] this moment. Your needs to supply.
[1:33:26] Reach out and touch the Lord
[1:33:30] as he [music]
[1:33:32] goes by. [singing]
[1:33:34] Reach out and touch the Lord [music]
[1:33:39] [singing] as he passes by.
[1:33:43] You'll find he's not too busy
[1:33:46] [music and singing]
[1:33:47] to hear your heart's cry.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; He is passing by this moment. Your needs
[1:33:56] [singing] to supply.
[1:34:00] Reach out and touch the Lord
[1:34:04] as [singing] he goes. [music] Amen.
[1:34:07] Let's do it one more time. Oh, reach out
[1:34:12] and touch the [music] Lord [singing]
[1:34:14] as he is his.
