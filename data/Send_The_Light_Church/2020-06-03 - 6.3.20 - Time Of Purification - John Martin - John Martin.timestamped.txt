[37:18] what does that mean ready
[37:20] well we want to touch on
[37:25] part three a time for purification about
[37:29] being ready and it is our time this is
[37:33] our time I think this part of the
[37:36] rapture we play a big role in it as we
[37:40] read into Scripture every man that have
[37:42] this hope I'm going to be like Jesus
[37:45] when he returns I'm going to be ready
[37:46] for the rapture I'm going to make myself
[37:48] ready the bride makes herself ready
[37:50] every man that has this hope inside of
[37:53] them purifies himself in other words he
[37:55] plays a part in the sanctification role
[37:59] and in part one I if I could I just want
[38:03] to take my time and maybe probably spend
[38:05] half the service just going through the
[38:07] first two parts if that's okay I
[38:11] can get some more amens and then you got
[38:13] to make up for everybody else you know
[38:15] that they're not here so extra amens
[38:18] but in part 1 of the series being ready
[38:21] we discussed the difference between
[38:23] getting ready and maintaining a state of
[38:26] being ready
[38:27] it takes much more effort to be in a
[38:31] state of being ready and that's what
[38:32] Jesus said be ready he just didn't say
[38:35] work on getting ready too often we can
[38:37] be content with the efforts that we put
[38:40] forth in just getting ready and never
[38:43] having the goal of I need to be ready
[38:44] because he can become in any day any any
[38:47] hour
[38:48] amen and and
[38:51] not for me to determine whether you're
[38:53] ready or you're getting ready but it is
[38:56] a question that you need to answer
[38:59] right it's a question that you need to
[39:01] answer and we we took our scripture in
[39:03] Matthew 24:42 watch therefore for ye
[39:07] know not what hour your Lord doth come
[39:10] watch watch it's a verb it's an action
[39:14] word and it means to keep awake
[39:16] spiritually be be vigilant so that's
[39:20] what it means to watch you can't just
[39:22] watch carnally
[39:24] amen but know this that if the good man
[39:28] of the house had known in what watch or
[39:31] what hour what time the thief were to
[39:33] come he would have kept awake that word
[39:38] watch means CAPTA wake and would have
[39:41] not suffered his house to be broken up
[39:43] therefore be ye also ready for in such
[39:47] an hour as ye think not the Son of man
[39:50] cometh so
[39:51] he's coming as a thief in the night in
[39:54] other words there's an unawareness and
[39:56] he does not owe us
[39:59] the time that he's coming
[40:02] our love and dedication to him is
[40:06] all that he's requiring and he'll he'll
[40:10] take care of the rest therefore be ye
[40:12] also ready for in such an hour she think
[40:14] now the Son of man cometh now remember
[40:16] brother Branham he said that many will
[40:18] not recognize that he came in left
[40:24] remember he said that people will be
[40:26] coming in to church thinking that
[40:28] they're getting saved but they're not
[40:30] because the days of the Gentiles was
[40:33] over that's the reason why there's a lot
[40:37] of time to get ready so this is an
[40:40] important role for us it is not God's
[40:43] job to get me ready
[40:46] because if it was then it would be his
[40:50] job to get everybody else ready
[40:53] now he can only do I can't do what he
[40:57] could do
[40:59] but I have to control my attitude my
[41:01] efforts and being diligent and caring
[41:04] about the subject
[41:07] Jesus I believe in these scriptures here
[41:10] in Matthew 24 is teaching us about a
[41:13] state of awareness when he says be ready
[41:15] he's teaching us about a state of
[41:17] awareness to be ready he said many will
[41:20] come to me in that day and say Lord what
[41:22] about this I did this and I did that and
[41:24] he says I never knew you so they were
[41:27] they were not in a state of awareness of
[41:30] what God had required they thought what
[41:34] they did was good enough so while the
[41:38] enemy is lukewarm mean it's this word
[41:41] I'm making up Luke warming the church
[41:44] into a comfortable state of unawareness
[41:47] of their mind the Holy Ghost is telling
[41:51] us to wake up to pinch our conscious to
[41:55] snap out of it to press in
[41:59] that's what exactly what the Prophet
[42:01] said and
[42:02] I
[42:04] believe when we were feeling that that I
[42:07] got to do something like I got a
[42:10] wonderful phone call today as the
[42:13] request came in from brother Ron Husker
[42:15] and what he was expressing to me it
[42:17] almost sounded like he thought the
[42:18] rapture take place because he called
[42:20] yesterday he couldn't get through and I
[42:22] didn't call him back and had been sent
[42:24] so long since year he actually thought
[42:26] the rapture had taken place and it just
[42:29] I wanted to be ready he wanted to be
[42:31] ready and I think that's the Holy Ghost
[42:34] that's always wanting us to be ready and
[42:37] the devil is telling the church they are
[42:40] ready
[42:41] understand the difference
[42:45] I don't really I see at the very end
[42:50] Paul said I am I fought a good fight I'm
[42:53] ready I fit it at the very end of
[42:57] it but all through his whole walk he was
[43:02] pressing in amen
[43:05] first I just have a few scriptures on
[43:08] this for us first Corinthians chapter 15
[43:10] verse 34 awake to righteousness
[43:15] now remember
[43:17] when we talked about that word watch it
[43:20] means to keep awake spiritually so when
[43:24] I'm talking when this scripture is being
[43:25] read here awake to righteousness
[43:28] it means being in a state of awareness
[43:32] spiritual awareness that you you you
[43:36] know what's happening in the spiritual
[43:38] realm not well this is my opinion
[43:42] our penis could be wrong so a way to
[43:44] righteousness and sin not for some have
[43:47] not the knowledge of God I speeches to
[43:49] their shame so Laodicea don't have the
[43:53] knowledge that they need to awake to
[43:56] right through to righteousness they're
[43:58] there they're sleeping they're sleeping
[44:00] virgin they're in need of nothing
[44:02] they're okay in their state but but he's
[44:04] saying to the bride awake to
[44:06] righteousness amen Ephesians 5 verse 14
[44:11] wherefore he saith awake thou that
[44:14] sleepest and arise from the dead and
[44:18] Christ shall give you light so there is
[44:20] a state that we could be in that we're
[44:23] basically sleeping spiritually we're not
[44:27] walking in the spirit when you're not
[44:28] walking in the spirit you're sleeping
[44:31] because you're not aware and and in
[44:35] policy and awake thou that sleepest
[44:38] okay verse 15 see then that you walk
[44:41] circumspectly
[44:43] that word circumspectly means diligently
[44:46] perfectly exactly see then that you walk
[44:50] perfectly and not as fool's but as wise
[44:53] so how do I do that how do I walk
[44:56] perfectly verse 16 redeemed the time
[44:58] this is now time to be sleeping redeem
[45:01] it use this time to get ready
[45:08] because the days are evil
[45:12] it's not getting is it easier for us I
[45:14] mean after the colvin 19 has been
[45:17] flattened we're on the other side is it
[45:19] easier for us
[45:21] do we feel more energetic in the Lord do
[45:24] we feel like all I can't wait it's
[45:26] harder it's harder the days are things
[45:29] are gonna get worse we have to be the
[45:32] ones oppressed through this we have to
[45:34] make the choices to purify ourselves and
[45:37] to and to make this world live in us we
[45:40] can make that choice amen verse 17
[45:43] wherefore be ye not unwise but
[45:45] understanding what the will of the Lord
[45:47] is what is the will of the Lord be not
[45:49] drunk with wine wherein is excess but be
[45:52] filled with the spirit so they'll
[45:54] understand the will the Lord is get more
[45:57] of the Holy Ghost
[45:59] get more of the Holy Ghost Romans
[46:02] chapter 13 verse 11 and
[46:06] that knowing the time
[46:09] knowing the time that now is high time
[46:13] to awake out of our sleep for now is our
[46:17] salvation nearer than when we first
[46:20] believed the night is far spent the day
[46:23] is at hand let us cast off the works of
[46:25] darkness and let us put on the armor of
[46:27] light let us walk honestly as in the day
[46:30] not rioting boy we need to put that on
[46:33] Fox News not rioting and drunkenness not
[46:36] in chambering and wantonness not in
[46:39] strife and envy
[46:41] but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[46:44] make not provision for the flesh to
[46:47] fulfill the lust thereof so our
[46:50] salvation is near them when we first
[46:53] believed so the culmination of the
[46:56] rapture is nearer than when we first
[46:59] believed so we want to labor to stay in
[47:03] that state of being ready
[47:06] it is not like I got a a picture today
[47:13] from brother Mike Helms who who sent me
[47:15] a picture he was he went to that famous
[47:18] barber in a Lhasa
[47:21] and he got a picture with the famous
[47:24] barber that you know we all seen on TV
[47:26] and
[47:28] you when you go to get a haircut you cuz
[47:31] it Oh got a haircut it's done it's over
[47:33] with but
[47:35] maintaining a state of being ready is a
[47:40] constant everyday affair
[47:43] are you with me so we need to labor to
[47:46] stay in that that's part one so part two
[47:48] we talked about the full atonement
[47:52] and we learned that there's a large
[47:57] group of believers who reject the
[48:00] fullness of the atonement
[48:03] the scary part is they don't think
[48:06] they've rejected it
[48:08] but they have and they don't know it
[48:11] they're not realizing that they they
[48:14] reject to walk in further truth when we
[48:17] reject to walk in further truth we
[48:20] reject the fullness of Calvary
[48:24] no wonder Paul said I know nothing he
[48:27] said Christ and him crucified
[48:29] that's all that's in in the more you
[48:32] know of Calvary which we haven't
[48:34] discovered everything yet we know it was
[48:37] a an act that he did that he paid the
[48:41] price for us but there's so much in
[48:43] there for us and we
[48:46] have to receive it all
[48:52] we went through the ten virgins and the
[48:54] borderline believers in Egypt who
[48:57] believed enough to come out of the world
[48:59] but did not believe enough to die out to
[49:03] get the Holy Ghost
[49:06] the five foolish virgins they did not
[49:10] get enough oil for their journey the
[49:12] borderline believers believed up to the
[49:14] border and
[49:16] they did they didn't want to suffer
[49:18] remember brother Brandon when they asked
[49:20] brother Branham after the bride is
[49:22] raptured will any of the foolish virgins
[49:24] be saved or will they be lost of course
[49:28] after the bride is raptured
[49:30] there's no there's no more Gentiles
[49:34] being saved those that our save will
[49:37] remain saved but
[49:41] they will have to go through tribulation
[49:43] and then they'll have to sleep for a
[49:45] thousand years and then we'll have the
[49:48] white throne judgment and then there
[49:52] ever the books will be open and and and
[49:55] we'll be judging right sitting on the
[49:58] throne with Jesus and judging them I
[50:01] mean but why is virgins gonna be judging
[50:03] the foolish virgin
[50:05] are you with me all right
[50:10] but because the foolish virgins like the
[50:14] children of Israel did not want to
[50:17] suffer both of them didn't want to
[50:19] suffer you have to suffer to get the
[50:20] Holy Ghost you have to suffer to purify
[50:23] yourself
[50:25] you have to suffer the children of
[50:27] Israel had to suffer to go in there and
[50:30] take the promised land and they didn't
[50:31] want to suffer they made a choice not to
[50:35] make the consecration and let the Holy
[50:37] Ghost come in because that's how the
[50:38] song goes
[50:39] make the consecration and let the Holy
[50:42] Ghost come in to make a consecration it
[50:45] takes suffering when brother Branham he
[50:48] would often rededicate his life to the
[50:50] Lord well that took suffering crucified
[50:54] in the flesh
[50:55] brother Brennan said the
[50:57] foolish virgins will have to go through
[51:00] tribulation period the reason of it is
[51:04] is because they rejected the atonement
[51:06] in its fullness she's a believer a
[51:09] professor believer but she still has to
[51:11] go through the tribulation period now
[51:13] she's rejected part of the atonement
[51:17] part of Calvary because many people look
[51:20] at Calvary as just a Christmas gift
[51:28] that's like it's thinking that
[51:34] God doesn't have any Commandments for us
[51:40] the Calvary allowed his Holy Ghost to
[51:44] come inside of us
[51:46] that's what I did we still have to get
[51:48] the Holy Ghost because if Calvary just
[51:51] gave the Holy Ghost everybody everybody
[51:53] would have it
[51:55] without Calvary there was no way God was
[51:59] coming inside of another man
[52:01] never
[52:03] but because the Calvary the price was
[52:06] paid and now he could come inside but
[52:09] it's still up to us to believe for that
[52:12] Holy Ghost that we can receive more
[52:15] and
[52:16] I just say for the bride there's more
[52:20] now to the foolish virgin
[52:24] they're not going all the way anyways
[52:28] so enough enough
[52:32] but to the bride give me oil in my lamp
[52:37] keep me burning keep me burning
[52:42] we can say in this hour that there is a
[52:45] group of professed believers who believe
[52:48] exactly the same way the elect believe
[52:50] until they reach the border of crossing
[52:55] over into the Holy Ghost
[52:58] they're a borderline believer it's too
[53:02] hard to believe for a complete nature
[53:04] change
[53:06] I'm okay with God died for me my sins
[53:09] are forgiven I'm going to heaven I can
[53:11] believe for that but if I have to
[53:14] believe if I have to keep adding to my
[53:16] faith virtue and virtue knowledge and
[53:19] knowledge temperance and keep adding to
[53:21] my life and keep purifying my life and
[53:24] keep having Christ more manifested in me
[53:27] well that that that can become too hard
[53:31] are you with me
[53:33] so to reject the atonement and its
[53:36] fullness really means to reject Calvary
[53:38] in its fullness
[53:40] atonement is not to be looked at as just
[53:42] a gift
[53:43] it means
[53:45] to exchange
[53:48] restoration or reconciliation so you are
[53:51] exchanging your will for God's will you
[53:54] are becoming restored back if you are
[53:57] this is where you get if you are son of
[54:00] God you always were something of God if
[54:02] you are the elect you're just being
[54:04] restored back to with that original
[54:06] thought that God had in his mind at the
[54:08] beginning
[54:09] Calvary was meant to take us beyond
[54:13] the bondage of this world and making us
[54:17] into heaven Calvary was was meant to
[54:20] take us beyond it was meant to take us
[54:23] over into the promised land into a
[54:25] complete nature change now that was the
[54:28] intent of Calvary
[54:35] 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[54:37] therefore if any man be in Christ if any
[54:41] man has crossed over
[54:43] he is a new creature now he's in the
[54:47] promised land old things are passed away
[54:50] behold all things have become new now
[54:52] that should be very important for every
[54:54] one of us and and not thinking that that
[54:58] meant I that meant when I was smoking
[55:02] that meant when I I got rid of my drugs
[55:05] that meant when I got rid of my liquor
[55:07] that meant when I used to have long hair
[55:09] that meant when I used to listen to rock
[55:10] and roll music that no that means
[55:12] everything all things amen he is a new
[55:16] creature old things are passed away
[55:18] behold all things have become new and
[55:19] all things are of God when I read that I
[55:22] think you know what I've got a ways to
[55:24] go I
[55:25] look at that and I say
[55:29] the right just scarcely make it
[55:32] all right all things are of God who have
[55:35] reconciled us to
[55:38] himself by Jesus Christ they have given
[55:42] us the Ministry of reconciliation
[55:45] well since the foolish virgins never get
[55:50] totally reconciled they don't have a
[55:52] burden to reconcile others
[55:54] so they're not reaching out they don't
[55:58] believe in that ministry they believe
[55:59] it's for somebody else
[56:02] but the wise virgin who totally get
[56:05] reconciled to God
[56:07] they now Christ inside of him has the
[56:10] same burden and is reaching up others do
[56:13] you see how beautiful that is
[56:15] amen verse 19 to wit that God was in
[56:18] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[56:20] not imputing their trespasses on them
[56:23] and had committed unto us the word of
[56:26] reconciliation
[56:27] God committed the ministry on to them on
[56:32] to the foolish virgin but they rejected
[56:35] the fullness of the atonement
[56:38] now they may be interested in trying to
[56:41] get people to their church but
[56:43] if their church is just about
[56:48] numbers or entertainment or enjoyment
[56:51] you're really not getting somebody to a
[56:54] nature change
[56:57] now then we are ambassadors
[56:59] not for sun the light
[57:02] for God's light for Christ as though God
[57:07] did beseech you by us we pray you in
[57:10] Christ's stead be reconciled to God now
[57:12] that should be the spirit inside of
[57:13] every one of us when we talk to others
[57:15] we want others to be reconciled to
[57:18] Christ
[57:20] Hebrews 4 verse 1 let us labor let us
[57:24] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[57:27] us we could miss part of the Tollman
[57:30] Saints I
[57:32] mean how many times has the devil
[57:35] preached this sermon to those in the
[57:37] message
[57:38] as long as you're in the message you're
[57:41] okay
[57:42] as long as you believe that God sent a
[57:45] prophet you know it is you believe
[57:47] you're okay
[57:52] the instructions that Paul has given us
[57:54] is we need to fear I could be missing
[57:57] something there should there could be a
[57:59] part of the Holy Ghost that I need that
[58:02] I'm missing a promise a promise
[58:06] amen Hebrews 4 verse 9 there remaineth
[58:11] therefore a rest
[58:12] to the people of God a rest for he that
[58:17] has entered into his rest
[58:19] for he that has entered into his rest he
[58:22] also ceased from his own works as God
[58:24] did from his let us labor therefore to
[58:27] enter into that rest lest any man fall
[58:30] for the same example of unbelief
[58:35] when you enter into
[58:38] the true Holy Ghost you're not trying to
[58:43] live the life its Christ living in you
[58:48] so we need to
[58:52] understand that there is still a rest
[58:55] who's it for the people of God that's
[58:59] who it's for so we need to keep growing
[59:02] keep adding to your walk more Holy Ghost
[59:05] amen because there remains more Holy
[59:08] Ghost to the people of God
[59:10] now brother Branham taught us that the
[59:13] rest is the word his word now that's
[59:17] what he talks entering into the word the
[59:19] word is our rest but it's not the
[59:22] knowledge of the word it's the spirit of
[59:25] the word right because the knowledge
[59:28] the letter
[59:30] killeth knowledge puffeth up so it has
[59:34] nothing to do up here with the knowledge
[59:38] and the letter it has to do with the
[59:41] spirit that edifies that brings a and
[59:44] edification to the situation and
[59:48] that that the Spirit is the Holy Ghost
[59:50] and that's what we need we need more
[59:53] Holy Ghost brother Brennan said in
[59:55] questions and answers when they the
[59:58] question was as please explain fully
[1:00:00] about the Gentiles that don't go in the
[1:00:03] rapture
[1:00:05] but the band said see the Gentile bride
[1:00:07] is in heaven the sleeping virgin the
[1:00:10] Gentile virgin is not to be saved during
[1:00:15] that time she's already been saved I
[1:00:18] read this cult but has been rejected in
[1:00:21] the bride doesn't it isn't that terrible
[1:00:23] she's been saved
[1:00:26] but she's been rejected into the bride
[1:00:32] that's just sad to me it's it's sad but
[1:00:36] but somebody's got to make the call I
[1:00:39] mean when everybody goes enlist in the
[1:00:42] army everybody doesn't become the
[1:00:44] general
[1:00:46] if something's going to make the call
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:49] God makes the call who's the bride and
[1:00:53] and it's not good enough that we've just
[1:00:56] accepted Christ as their Savior
[1:00:59] that relationship has got to grow into a
[1:01:02] love affair
[1:01:05] and be looking expecting Oh Lord what
[1:01:09] would you have me to do amen and
[1:01:13] she only goes speaking of the foolish
[1:01:18] version now and she only goes through
[1:01:22] the tribulation period
[1:01:24] for the time of purification
[1:01:28] because she has rejected Christ the word
[1:01:31] for her purification this is such a
[1:01:33] powerful quote
[1:01:36] she only goes through the tribulation
[1:01:39] period for the time of purification so
[1:01:43] that's why she's she she never purified
[1:01:46] herself and God requires the
[1:01:49] purification so she has to go to
[1:01:51] tribulation now she the Bible says she
[1:01:56] rejected Christ the word for a
[1:01:58] purification but she Risa remember she
[1:02:01] accepted Calvary
[1:02:04] she accepted Christ as her Savior but
[1:02:07] she also rejected part of the word
[1:02:11] so it's important that we don't forget
[1:02:14] some of the word we don't say that parts
[1:02:18] not that important or I don't have to
[1:02:20] worry about that
[1:02:24] the bride takes the word amen okay back
[1:02:28] to the quote and then she has to suffer
[1:02:31] for her deeds
[1:02:33] what deeds she she accepted Calvary
[1:02:37] she's saved but now she has to suffer
[1:02:41] for her knees what deeds for not taking
[1:02:43] the fall Tolman God expects us to take
[1:02:46] the fall told me but the bride who has
[1:02:50] become the word which we're going to try
[1:02:52] to get into in part for the bride who
[1:02:56] has become the word a complete atonement
[1:03:00] was made of Christ what does that mean
[1:03:03] because he is the word the body was
[1:03:06] rendered and when the body was rendered
[1:03:09] the bride was in that body because as
[1:03:11] all the word so when when when
[1:03:15] Jesus was on the cross and he was
[1:03:20] crucified
[1:03:22] when he paid that the debt
[1:03:25] we were right inside of him for the
[1:03:29] judgment
[1:03:31] so he paid for our
[1:03:36] our suffering he paid for all of our sin
[1:03:40] there is always we have to do now is
[1:03:44] obey every word come under subjection to
[1:03:48] the word become the word and that
[1:03:52] requires
[1:03:54] purifying herself
[1:03:56] it's hard to become the word when you
[1:03:59] when you're not living the word in order
[1:04:03] for me to start living that word it's
[1:04:05] going to have to crucify my flesh
[1:04:07] so now I got to purify myself to get to
[1:04:10] that point of living the word in that
[1:04:12] area
[1:04:14] brother
[1:04:16] brother Larry just forgive me here
[1:04:19] because this is about me but I thought
[1:04:21] of you when I'm saying it but I just
[1:04:23] wanted Bree remember when I had long
[1:04:26] hair
[1:04:27] and I did not want to cut it
[1:04:31] because I didn't want to look old fogey
[1:04:35] you know like my daddy I wanted to be
[1:04:39] cool and I want to lose that so you know
[1:04:42] come to church and learning about you
[1:04:45] know this is the way you know Christian
[1:04:46] has to be there was that that point of a
[1:04:50] wrastling I had to suffer I had to give
[1:04:54] up my will because my will was to have
[1:04:56] it now I had to give that up
[1:04:58] you know it wasn't like you know
[1:05:02] Shara was gonna like me more you know
[1:05:04] she first saw me with the long hair I
[1:05:09] don't know what she felt about it but I
[1:05:11] think that you know it was because the
[1:05:13] long hair she liked me
[1:05:15] so you see no matter what we got going
[1:05:18] in our life we're gonna have to suffer
[1:05:20] to get rid of it and and the foolish
[1:05:23] virgin didn't want to do that they were
[1:05:26] I accepted Christ as my savior he died
[1:05:30] for me
[1:05:32] that settles it they don't need to talk
[1:05:34] about anything else though though the
[1:05:38] wise virgin or the bride they know they
[1:05:41] have to be just like him when he appears
[1:05:42] so they I would be interested in
[1:05:45] everything that God is interested in
[1:05:49] beautiful
[1:05:53] now remember at the beginning of the
[1:05:55] series before we started one of the
[1:05:58] points that we were going to look at was
[1:06:01] both the bride and the church have to be
[1:06:05] purified I made that statement the bride
[1:06:08] will force herself through free more
[1:06:11] agency to purify herself before the
[1:06:13] rapture while the church neglects to
[1:06:17] force herself to free more agency just I
[1:06:20] don't want to to purify herself she is
[1:06:23] forced to purify yourself to tribulation
[1:06:26] I
[1:06:27] know
[1:06:29] that's what the Prophet said
[1:06:32] she has to go through tribulation for
[1:06:36] purification and it's against her will
[1:06:45] but she can just say I'm not gonna do it
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:50] so it's it's better
[1:06:53] to be willing to work on it now either
[1:06:56] way we got it we got a purify yourself
[1:06:58] but there's just no no ands ifs abouts
[1:07:01] about it the devil he tries telling me
[1:07:03] all the time you don't have to do this
[1:07:06] that you you got your you're good enough
[1:07:09] you're there you're close
[1:07:11] you're close enough you'll get the rest
[1:07:14] at the end whatever he says that they're
[1:07:16] just all lies
[1:07:17] there's so many things that God hasn't
[1:07:20] even told me that I need to do yet
[1:07:22] if I can't take care of the ones he told
[1:07:25] me why is he gonna trust me with others
[1:07:28] so this is this is
[1:07:31] important that we work and purifying
[1:07:34] ourselves amen
[1:07:36] they asked please explain because you
[1:07:39] said that there would be a small number
[1:07:42] going to the rapture
[1:07:43] both of em said that is these on earth
[1:07:47] that's going to be changed
[1:07:49] small group that's going on the rapture
[1:07:52] he said this is the group that's on the
[1:07:53] earth it's a small group that's on the
[1:07:56] earth he said Strait is the gate and
[1:07:58] narrow is the way and few be that find
[1:08:00] him that's where we're at that is us
[1:08:03] amen he's God but these who accept the
[1:08:07] word in its fullness the words already
[1:08:11] been judged and where this is what we're
[1:08:13] going to get on Calvary questions and
[1:08:15] answers 157 brother and says no could a
[1:08:18] righteous judge a
[1:08:22] man twice for anything
[1:08:25] if the penalty has been paid
[1:08:29] could or could judge a righteous judge
[1:08:32] could he judge somebody two times if the
[1:08:37] penalties already been paid the first
[1:08:38] time no
[1:08:41] if I was in the pollen shop and you come
[1:08:45] by and said I'm going to redeem him and
[1:08:48] you went in and paid the price for my
[1:08:50] Redemption and that's my penalty of
[1:08:54] being in the pollen ship and you paid my
[1:08:56] Redemption then how can the pawnbroker
[1:08:59] claimed me again
[1:09:02] you went in the pawn shop you bought
[1:09:04] something you walking out with it you
[1:09:06] gave them the money how can that
[1:09:07] pawnbroker say wait come back you still
[1:09:10] belong to me
[1:09:12] so he asked the question then how can
[1:09:15] the pawnbroker claim me again question
[1:09:17] mark he said unless I sold out again
[1:09:22] free more agency
[1:09:25] free more agency
[1:09:28] there you are when I rejected the
[1:09:31] fullness of the word then I go right
[1:09:34] back into the pawn shop
[1:09:37] that's what brother Brandon saying
[1:09:41] so you're doing great you come to church
[1:09:44] you hear a new word
[1:09:46] that's not good I don't mean a new word
[1:09:50] the more of the word is being unveiled
[1:09:53] let me say that case there might be
[1:09:56] someone listening for the first time and
[1:09:58] not understanding about you hear the
[1:10:01] word its opens up to you and you say I
[1:10:05] don't think I ought to do that
[1:10:08] you according to what the Prophet says
[1:10:11] you could be putting yourself right back
[1:10:13] in the pawn shop
[1:10:17] see then he says
[1:10:21] when I read when I rejected the fullness
[1:10:24] of the word then they go back to the
[1:10:25] pawn shop si si then fight my way out
[1:10:28] then if I can but he redeemed me all
[1:10:31] right
[1:10:32] now the righteous judge brother Ram said
[1:10:36] this and the mighty conquer he said
[1:10:38] for the righteous judge could not judge
[1:10:41] the just with the unjust because the
[1:10:46] believer was already been judged when
[1:10:48] Christ was judged in his place therefore
[1:10:50] it would be unjust for a holy God to
[1:10:52] judge them again after he's already
[1:10:54] accepted our judgment in Christ isn't
[1:10:57] that beautiful so Calvary really really
[1:10:59] paid for our sins all of them
[1:11:05] in the message the first seal so this is
[1:11:08] a teaching this is a teaching
[1:11:12] speaking on those who don't work I'm
[1:11:15] purifying themselves the brand says so
[1:11:18] if you speak one thing and think another
[1:11:20] you better stop that
[1:11:22] get your thoughts on God keep them pure
[1:11:27] stay right there with it and speak the
[1:11:29] same thing all the time see don't say
[1:11:32] well I'll say it I'll say I'll believe
[1:11:35] it but I'll go I'll go find out in other
[1:11:38] words there's a lot of doubt or question
[1:11:40] there
[1:11:41] just believe it and say it keep those
[1:11:44] two in the same if you don't you're
[1:11:48] opening your door for the door of your
[1:11:51] mind to be double-minded
[1:11:53] notice these types notice these types
[1:11:56] for the RAM said the reason they died
[1:11:58] out
[1:12:00] they go through the purging of the trial
[1:12:03] of the tribulation because they're not
[1:12:06] actually under the blood and I was
[1:12:08] talking about the five he's talking
[1:12:11] about the five unwise virgins don't wise
[1:12:15] virgins here
[1:12:16] they've claimed Calvary they've accepted
[1:12:19] Christ as their Savior but brother
[1:12:22] Branham says they're actually not under
[1:12:23] the blood
[1:12:24] Brooke brother John you've got to give
[1:12:28] you scripture for that one I'm gonna
[1:12:29] give you scripture for that right now it
[1:12:30] just came to me let's go to first John
[1:13:02] okay so sorry verse number seven first
[1:13:05] John chapter one verse number seven
[1:13:13] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:13:18] the light so he shows us more light and
[1:13:21] we walk in it we have fellowship with
[1:13:24] one another and
[1:13:27] the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
[1:13:29] cleanses us from all sin
[1:13:32] so if we don't walk in that light as the
[1:13:37] Prophet said we're actually not under
[1:13:39] the blood
[1:13:41] all right going back to the quote now
[1:13:44] they claim they are but they're not how
[1:13:47] can they go through a trial to purify
[1:13:50] them when they're when there is when
[1:13:54] there is when the bleach of the blood of
[1:13:56] Jesus Christ takes every symptom of sin
[1:14:00] and stuff away from you now this is a
[1:14:04] subject in itself but the more of the
[1:14:07] Holy Ghost which is the blood of Christ
[1:14:10] the life of Christ's blood the Holy
[1:14:12] Ghost
[1:14:13] the more of it that we receive the less
[1:14:16] of us we have
[1:14:19] and it's a process and we're all
[1:14:23] somewhere in that process and it's just
[1:14:27] the more that you hunger for God the
[1:14:28] safer you're going to be
[1:14:31] he says and you're already dead and your
[1:14:34] life is hid in him through God and
[1:14:38] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what
[1:14:41] are you going to be judged for right who
[1:14:43] can lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:14:45] elect right what are you going to be
[1:14:47] judged for where you're going to get
[1:14:49] your purification what do you have to be
[1:14:52] purified from when you're perfectly in
[1:14:55] Christ sinless what's the judgment for
[1:14:59] but it's the sleeping punch
[1:15:02] them that the people can't make out
[1:15:06] there's
[1:15:07] we are in the rapture right now we're in
[1:15:11] the process of the rapture we are in the
[1:15:13] process of purifying ourselves why
[1:15:15] because there's a hope in us that we
[1:15:18] want to be just like him when he comes
[1:15:20] we want to be ready for the rapture
[1:15:22] so the way that we purify ourselves is
[1:15:26] word write the word washes us so we
[1:15:30] hunger for the word the word comes and
[1:15:32] we don't come to church to hear a word
[1:15:33] that we already agree with we come to
[1:15:36] church to hear the word that we might
[1:15:38] become more like him amen that we might
[1:15:42] be challenged and we might find out
[1:15:43] where at and where he wants us to be
[1:15:46] no they haven't done it for years you
[1:15:49] see but this is the hour of Revelation
[1:15:52] see being revealed just at the coming of
[1:15:55] the bride the last why do you not the
[1:15:56] last things that are coming it's coming
[1:15:59] to an end friends I believe when I don't
[1:16:02] know I can't tell you
[1:16:04] but I want to live tonight like it's
[1:16:07] like if it was tonight I'd be ready
[1:16:10] see he might come tonight yet he might
[1:16:13] not come for 20 years I don't know when
[1:16:16] he'll come
[1:16:18] so we can see that the wise virgins are
[1:16:22] purifying themselves right now it's a
[1:16:24] process that's happening and it's
[1:16:26] between them and Christ it's a personal
[1:16:29] affair it's not an outward thing I
[1:16:33] mean you will people will eventually see
[1:16:36] it I mean a good example brother Larry
[1:16:39] we seen brother Larry a while now with
[1:16:42] long hair and gods working on the inside
[1:16:46] of him right it was a personal thing and
[1:16:51] nobody nobody that I know of brother I
[1:16:54] know nobody that talked to you about it
[1:16:57] so it was it was a it was a personal
[1:17:00] thing between the Holy Ghost of him and
[1:17:04] eventually you were getting in a part
[1:17:06] for right here and eventually it
[1:17:08] materializes and it becomes manifested
[1:17:12] we're out where everybody sees but the
[1:17:14] working of purification happens in our
[1:17:16] heart between us and God it's about the
[1:17:18] heart no man knows the heart now the
[1:17:21] foolish virgins they think
[1:17:24] that God's love
[1:17:27] that God loves them just as much as the
[1:17:30] wise virgin and they don't have to worry
[1:17:33] about anything
[1:17:35] it's a very kernel view
[1:17:39] because God does love us the same
[1:17:42] but that doesn't mean he's gonna choose
[1:17:45] us the same many are called many are
[1:17:48] loved but fewer chosen it's really
[1:17:52] important for us to make sure we know
[1:17:55] what God expects of us amen
[1:17:59] the foolish version they still have to
[1:18:01] be purified they still have to go
[1:18:04] through tribulation God requires a
[1:18:06] purification to get into heaven we're
[1:18:08] going to be going through some some
[1:18:09] scriptures here if we have some time
[1:18:13] behold what manner of love the father
[1:18:16] have bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:18:18] called the sons of God
[1:18:20] therefore the world knows us not because
[1:18:23] it knew him not the love of Christ
[1:18:27] constrains us or forces us to deal with
[1:18:33] things in our life that are not pleasing
[1:18:34] to God
[1:18:36] because God's commandments are not
[1:18:38] Grievous we don't have to do it because
[1:18:40] the old this is what the
[1:18:42] somebody told me or this is what the
[1:18:44] church says or this is what you know if
[1:18:47] I don't do this no
[1:18:49] God loves a cheerful Giver it has to be
[1:18:54] of the heart so it's the love of God
[1:18:56] that constrains us to deal with these
[1:18:58] things as he speaks to us the Holy Ghost
[1:19:01] is
[1:19:02] it rebukes us it reproves us and
[1:19:07] this is
[1:19:09] the way that God leads and guides us
[1:19:13] into all truth
[1:19:15] imagine for a moment all we had to do
[1:19:18] was sit and watch somebody
[1:19:22] tell us the news
[1:19:27] well we got out there we don't know what
[1:19:31] kind of news were listening to listen to
[1:19:32] news right we don't know if it's a fake
[1:19:34] news the real news we just right now you
[1:19:37] came and watch anything in that perfect
[1:19:38] confidence that what you're hearing is
[1:19:40] the Sabbath or you just can't so you're
[1:19:43] constantly having to think decide for
[1:19:46] yourself or have your own opinion you
[1:19:48] know what it is but imagine that we just
[1:19:50] come to church and always we had to do
[1:19:52] was just agree with what's right
[1:19:56] no change no suffering just
[1:20:01] identify what's right well that would be
[1:20:05] easy there'd be no suffering there'd be
[1:20:07] no purification it would just be
[1:20:10] knowledge
[1:20:13] but the Holy Ghost talks to us about her
[1:20:17] life
[1:20:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:22] teaches the bride and the bride says not
[1:20:26] my will but thy will be done
[1:20:29] the bride loves God so much as she
[1:20:32] forces herself to deny her own will as
[1:20:35] brother
[1:20:37] Stafford wrote in 1873
[1:20:41] though Satan should buff it though
[1:20:44] trials should come
[1:20:46] when sorrows like sea billows roll
[1:20:51] whatever my lot thou has taught me to
[1:20:54] say it is well it is well with my soul
[1:21:00] the Holy Ghost is teaching us
[1:21:03] now I'm telling you that that person
[1:21:05] suffered greatly lost greatly
[1:21:11] didn't it doesn't seem fair in my eyes
[1:21:14] but who can question God
[1:21:18] but thou has taught me to say when Jesus
[1:21:22] in the garden was taught to say not not
[1:21:27] real father time be done his will was
[1:21:30] let this thing pass for me what this
[1:21:32] suffering passed for me
[1:21:36] love is the center theme
[1:21:40] love has been bestowed upon us by God
[1:21:44] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:21:47] shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy
[1:21:49] Ghost love constrains us to change to
[1:21:53] want to change
[1:21:57] we can see the wise virgins are
[1:22:00] purifying themselves take a look at
[1:22:03] Esther when
[1:22:05] Vashti was
[1:22:07] rejected as a queen
[1:22:10] just like the Jews
[1:22:14] were rejected
[1:22:18] that's when he turned towards the
[1:22:19] Gentiles right
[1:22:21] so Esther was one of the people one of
[1:22:27] the people that were up
[1:22:29] for grabs
[1:22:33] there were many virgins and
[1:22:37] they all had their idea of
[1:22:43] how to get ready so good that the King
[1:22:48] would choose them
[1:22:51] but the Bible teaches us that
[1:22:56] Esther only took what the Chamberlain's
[1:23:00] gave her to do were the others added in
[1:23:05] their own thoughts
[1:23:08] because they were trying to get the
[1:23:10] upper hand
[1:23:12] well our Chamberlain praised God God
[1:23:15] sent us a prophet made it real clear
[1:23:18] what God requires of the bride and if
[1:23:23] you just take that
[1:23:25] don't be questioning doubting don't be
[1:23:29] trying to figure it out yourself and
[1:23:30] I'll tell you it's it's real clear that
[1:23:33] the message that Jesus Christ is the
[1:23:35] same yesterday today and forever in you
[1:23:39] that's what our goal is is to have to
[1:23:43] live the same life that Christ lived
[1:23:46] now in in reality none of us here are
[1:23:51] doing it perfectly
[1:23:54] none of us
[1:23:56] so what difference doesn't matter
[1:24:00] if brother Ben is doing it 1% more than
[1:24:04] I am
[1:24:07] what what good does it do if I'm doing
[1:24:10] it 2% more than brother mark
[1:24:13] if I'm still not living everything
[1:24:19] that maysa in the same vault
[1:24:23] pressing towards the same perfection
[1:24:27] it's only human nature to be comparing
[1:24:30] ourselves with one another to try to get
[1:24:32] some personal gratification about where
[1:24:35] we're standing but to God he's not
[1:24:37] looking at that he's looking at what
[1:24:40] he's giving you too much is given much
[1:24:41] is required and and and as long as
[1:24:45] you're steering that somebody else's
[1:24:47] fault
[1:24:48] weakness problem
[1:24:51] you know what that does it keeps you
[1:24:54] from doing what God wants you to do
[1:24:57] because you keep feeling justified
[1:24:59] because you don't got that problem that
[1:25:02] Bob's got Bob's back on the stand we
[1:25:05] have no box here
[1:25:10] Esther didn't deviate from the
[1:25:13] instructions given to her
[1:25:15] what an example for the bride amen this
[1:25:18] is our time for purification I want to
[1:25:21] go through some scriptures now I know I
[1:25:23] don't got much time we can go through
[1:25:25] the scriptures brothers down what do you
[1:25:27] been doing what's good I thought you
[1:25:28] were going through the scriptures
[1:25:29] hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 it's our
[1:25:33] time to get ready stay ready
[1:25:36] hebrews 12:14 follow peace
[1:25:39] with your best friends
[1:25:44] whoa it's a wrong Bible
[1:25:46] one book I should say follow peace with
[1:25:51] all men and
[1:25:52] holiness
[1:25:55] without which
[1:25:56] no man shall see the Lord God requires
[1:26:02] purification
[1:26:05] Matthew chapter 5 verse 8
[1:26:08] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:26:14] shall see God
[1:26:15] pure in heart
[1:26:18] doesn't mean sincere
[1:26:22] you be sincerely wrong
[1:26:25] purification we're going he that has
[1:26:28] this hope purifies himself
[1:26:31] yeah in order for me to purify myself I
[1:26:34] actually have to look at myself and
[1:26:38] admit I got an issue
[1:26:42] and deal with it
[1:26:47] and if I look at Bob you know Bob's got
[1:26:51] a lot of problems I
[1:26:53] feel when I look at Bob I say Bob is
[1:26:57] there anything I can do to help you
[1:27:01] and I help Bob I
[1:27:05] sorry and I'm moving around just haven't
[1:27:09] removed the camera I can walk away
[1:27:12] feeling good because I help Bob
[1:27:15] but I'm not doing anything to purify
[1:27:18] myself
[1:27:20] we need to look into ourselves be honest
[1:27:23] with ourselves and it's hard it's hard
[1:27:26] the bride is the only one that's willing
[1:27:29] to keep doing and keep doing it and keep
[1:27:31] doing it until they get to a place where
[1:27:34] God says I'm picking her and I'm picking
[1:27:37] him and I'm picking her
[1:27:40] that's it
[1:27:42] he picking me because my name is
[1:27:44] gentleman he is not picking me because
[1:27:46] I'm up here preaching or on the pastor
[1:27:48] he is not taking me because of that
[1:27:54] and he's not picking you cuz you're
[1:27:56] sitting there
[1:27:57] we're in the same boat I
[1:28:00] hope I'm provoking to good works here
[1:28:05] all right first Thessalonians 4:7
[1:28:08] first Thessalonians 4:7 for God have not
[1:28:12] called us unto uncleanness but unto
[1:28:16] holiness
[1:28:17] the call
[1:28:20] we're not born in holiness
[1:28:25] our nature our carnal nature is not holy
[1:28:30] so he's calling us unto a different
[1:28:33] nature oh
[1:28:36] hi for me to say I'm there would be like
[1:28:40] saying I'm perfect
[1:28:43] I mean how many thoughts do we get
[1:28:46] brother Brent says we back in the 60s
[1:28:49] used to he said that we backslide
[1:28:51] hundred times a day
[1:28:53] that's not holy
[1:28:56] what about our behavior our not just our
[1:29:00] thinking our behavior the words that we
[1:29:01] say the attitude that we have the be the
[1:29:03] the raff the anger the the backbiting
[1:29:06] the talking see these are not holy
[1:29:09] things are you with me I'm not just
[1:29:13] talking about
[1:29:16] sex
[1:29:20] that's one little thing
[1:29:24] there's so many other things
[1:29:33] alright Hebrews chapter 12 verse number
[1:29:35] 10
[1:29:38] for they verily
[1:29:40] for a few days
[1:29:42] chasing us
[1:29:44] after their own pleasure o brother mark
[1:29:48] him doesn't mark and I were talking
[1:29:50] about this scripture yesterday it wasn't
[1:29:52] even in my notes but he at that time but
[1:29:56] he for our profit
[1:29:58] that we might be partakers of his
[1:30:01] holiness
[1:30:02] so God chastens us corrects us
[1:30:07] that we might partake of his holiness so
[1:30:11] of course who wants to suffer
[1:30:14] who wants to be correct to chasten
[1:30:17] nobody enjoys that I don't want to I
[1:30:20] don't want to be told I'm doing wrong
[1:30:25] but I need it in order to partake more
[1:30:29] of his holiness that might be a better
[1:30:31] way of saying it instead of just being
[1:30:34] satisfied with what holiness I have to
[1:30:36] be concerned about the part that I don't
[1:30:38] have
[1:30:39] praise the Lord Romans chapter 6 verse
[1:30:43] 22
[1:30:45] but now being made free from sin and
[1:30:49] become servants to God you have your
[1:30:53] fruit unto holiness and the end
[1:30:58] everlasting life
[1:31:01] fruit unto holiness
[1:31:04] boy tell you with TV
[1:31:08] with all the junk
[1:31:12] this is hard
[1:31:17] Saints we got to press in we I'll say
[1:31:21] that let's do this pray one for another
[1:31:23] I
[1:31:25] think if we spent time you know there
[1:31:28] are things that maybe we struggle with
[1:31:30] in our life that others are struggling
[1:31:32] with the same afflictions are
[1:31:34] accomplished in our brother and around
[1:31:35] the world by praying for one another
[1:31:38] you're fulfilling the law of Christ
[1:31:41] first of all it touches the heart of God
[1:31:45] and then he gives you grace for your
[1:31:48] situation
[1:31:49] sometimes we're we're struggling with
[1:31:52] our situation
[1:31:53] or we're being very selfish about
[1:31:56] praying for one another caring about one
[1:31:58] another if we just spent time which we
[1:32:01] all can't do pray one for another God
[1:32:04] can come and help us with our need all
[1:32:08] right Ephesians just a few more
[1:32:10] scriptures here fishin's
[1:32:12] 4:24
[1:32:14] after that ye put on and that you put on
[1:32:18] the new man which after God is created
[1:32:23] in righteousness and true holiness
[1:32:28] so this is what we're doing we're
[1:32:30] purifying herself we're putting on the
[1:32:32] new man I'm not there yet Amen I'm I'm
[1:32:37] still putting him on praise God I'm
[1:32:39] pressing to be the man you know he's you
[1:32:44] know when they come to a brother branham
[1:32:45] they say to brother BAM
[1:32:47] you're such a great man of God and
[1:32:51] they're saying a bunch of things and put
[1:32:52] a pen and say and I would have to live a
[1:32:54] pretty high life to tiful to do what
[1:32:58] you're saying
[1:33:03] and I I just I just you know we we look
[1:33:07] better in one another's eyes
[1:33:10] we look better in one another's eyes but
[1:33:13] when we look in the mirror we're really
[1:33:15] in who we are
[1:33:17] and so I just say let's put on the new
[1:33:20] man let's think about putting the new
[1:33:22] man on some more no matter how much of
[1:33:24] the new man you got to get some more new
[1:33:25] man
[1:33:26] there's as much of Holy Ghost for us as
[1:33:29] we're willing to want second Corinthians
[1:33:33] chapter 7 verse 1
[1:33:36] having therefore these promises dearly
[1:33:39] beloved let us cleanse ourselves from
[1:33:44] all filthiness of the flesh and the
[1:33:47] spirit perfecting holiness in the fear
[1:33:52] of God
[1:33:56] even after Esther was chosen
[1:34:01] after she had a revelation she was the
[1:34:06] queen
[1:34:07] she still came before her husband with
[1:34:10] reverence and fear if it be pleasing in
[1:34:14] your sight
[1:34:16] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:34:20] wisdom to work out your salvation with
[1:34:22] fear and trembling - Satan wants us to
[1:34:25] you know not reverence enough we're look
[1:34:29] I look at what has happened
[1:34:32] through this coal but this thing it has
[1:34:36] caused a lesser respect people have lost
[1:34:39] their respect
[1:34:42] and I don't know if you can you can see
[1:34:45] it
[1:34:46] but I can see it
[1:34:51] alright last scriptures here first
[1:34:54] Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 12 two
[1:34:56] verses here first the Thessalonians
[1:34:58] chapter 3 verse 12 and the Lord make you

[1:35:06] toward another that's beautiful and not
[1:35:10] just towards one another and toward all
[1:35:12] men even as we do toward you to the end
[1:35:17] he may establish your hearts unblameable
[1:35:20] in holiness before God even our father
[1:35:26] at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:30] with all his saints isn't that beautiful
