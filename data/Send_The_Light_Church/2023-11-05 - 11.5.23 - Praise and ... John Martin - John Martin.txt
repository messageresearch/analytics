Jesus I certainly appreciated that worship service this morning amen God has B us to come and dine and I know you're all prepared because you got an extra hour of sleep amen don't you wish that you had that every day and one day we're going to have that every hour there will be no more time we'll never have to worry about getting up amen praise the Lord amen he's worthy to be praised so good to see everyone out this morning it's good to see sister berth it's been such a while since we've seen her sister God bless you uh turn with me if you would to Psalms chapter 99:9 that's 999 that's better than 666 amen and then we're going to continue reading Psalms 100 have a word of prayer Psalms chapter 99:9 says exalt the Lord Our God and worship at his Holy Hill amen for the Lord our God is Holy Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing and know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that have made us and not we ourselves we are the people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his mercy endureth forever and his truth endureth to all all generations praise the Lord amen amen let's bow before him in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we stand before you here Lord we look at ourselves and we know Lord we are so needy so needy of you Lord and we want to thank you today Lord today for Calvary Lord we want to thank you for giving your blood for us Lord Lord to make up the difference Lord because our lives are just all vanity Lord but you you make us complete you make us perfect you make us into your image you are the one that makes us to love like you love you are the one that makes us to give like you give Lord and we're in debt to you today and as we stand here before you in your house Lord we want to thank you for the opportunity to worship you to come into your gates with Thanksgiving to come into your courts with praise to recognize Lord that you are our creator we humble ourselves before you today pray Lord that your presence would come in the furtherance in the ministry of the word Lord that we could feed upon the bread of life which only you can feed us Lord only you can break yourself to us only you can make yourself known to us and we pray that you'd come in a supernatural away and Grant to each of our hearts what we have need of Lord as we wait furtherance on thee we give you glory and praise in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen amen you may be seated well the Bible says out of the mouth of babes and sucklings that thou has perfected praise amen Amen to come into God's presence requires a sacrifice we just can't come in any old way the scripture says know ye the Lord he is God it is he that made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture just that thought alone that he made us and we're coming now into his presence makes us to offer him an offering of humility that we're not worthy to be in his presence and to praise him for the gift of life that he has given us even this day he's given us breath and he's given us health and strength and uh we're living in a n as bad as this country is we still have freedom to worship God from the dictates of our heart and while the doors are still open we should come into these doors with Thanksgiving amen we should come in with a a a praise on our lips because he's told us to enter into his gates with Thanksgiving now Many religious people worship God in vain I say that many when you look at this world even in Jesus's day he said in vain do they worship me so there's a way to worship God that it just does it's it's for not it's in vain he said with their lips they do worship me but their heart is far far from me we heard Brother Bruce say that today in other words in the sight of God words are cheap if love is not the motivation of the worship amen Jesus said some people don't even know what they're worshiping in other words there's something lacking in their relationship so we know that God is the spirit and if we're going to worship God we got to get into the spirit wouldn't it be nice if you could just come in that door and you're automatically in that Spirit now your body may be your body may be because he's honored here but we've got to our spiritual man's got to get into the spirit because we don't worship from our body we worship from the inside and so we got to get into the spirit now maybe some they haven't committed to walking in the truth that they know when you do not commit to walking in the truth that God gives you you cannot worship God in spirit and in truth are you with me he said the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father is seeking such to worship him he's literally here looking for someone that will worship him the way he wants to be worshiped God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth you can't leave out one of them try leaving out something when you're baking a cake you're making cookies how many times you made cookies you forgot to put an ingredients in you went to taste it you thought oh whoa something's wrong with this something's wrong with worship if all you're going to do is just try to get in the spirit but you refuse to walk in the obedience to his word every believer ought to come into church with the offering of Praise we don't want to come to church without this offering because it's a requirement that God has for us now to the unbeliever worship is an option are you with me it's an option but to the True Believer it's not an option it's a requirement but I'll say it like this it's not only a commandment of God it's a privilege it is a privilege to worship God it's such a privilege God promised to actually inhabit our Praises so why wouldn't we want to praise Him amen so if we just Praise Him from our lips he's just going to inhabit our lips but if we we praise him from the deep part of us even though it's hard because you know what we're so programmed to only do what we feel to do I like that song I'm going to sing to it oh he's worthy to be praised on your worst day the worst thing that's ever happened to you in the world God is worthy to be praised on that day he's still God no matter what we go through and he will always remain God Psalms 15 verse one says praise ye the Lord praise God in his sanctuary in his Sanctuary this is not ours this is not mine This Is Not Yours this belongs to him and he's saying for us to praise him now how much do I praise him how do I praise him well look don't you wish that you could get more money when you went to the bank don't you wish your paycheck was a little bit more your retirement was a little bit more when that last cookie is gone don't you wish there was another one I'll just say it like this give God a greater effort give him a great effort and not just a little and say I did my part give them more make it a sacrifice whoa I really gave a lot I really pushed it up I really gave more than I thought I was ever going to give that's what he's looking for amen verse six let everything that have breath praise the Lord children do you have breath praise the Lord do not wait for mom and dad to say praise the Lord praise the Lord without Mom and Dad praise the Lord without your husband there without your wife there praise God because inside of you you want to praise him that's what he's looking for today now the True Believers has prepared his heart to praise God in his Sanctuary because he's worthy Psalms 116 verse number 17 we're going to read three verses there God requires this Sacrifice from all his people I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving the sacrifice in other words you have to bring a sacrifice before the Lord and will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows yes you owe vows unto the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people I guess it's not that private is it he's requiring it to be done in the presence of those that are around you because because God is just not the god to you he's a God to all of us we are his children we are his people we are the Sheep of his pasture and we need to all of us all pay our vows before the Lord in the courts of the Lord's House in the midst of the old Jerusalem praise ye the Lord I say it's time for us to pay up we need to be prayed up to pay up give him what he's worthy Psalms 106 ver1 praise ye the Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord for his good for his mercy endureth forever who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord who can show forth all his praise all right who can good question verse 48 blessed be the Lord God of Israel from Everlasting to Everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the Lord amen now if I'm going to stand before the Lord and I had $1,000 and God told me to give that ,000 to missions and I gave it I know that he would be pleased with that don't you now if God said I want you to give $10 million to missions but I never had $10 million I don't think God would ever ask me to give $10 million I do not want to stand before the Lord when he has asked me to praise him and I refuse to do it you understand what I'm saying if it's in your hands if it's in your heart if it's in your mind praise him it's not an option if you're a True Believer and I'll tell you if you're predestinated to be in His image there's something inside of you that just when the the word comes I'm going to praise him because it's a relationship that you are having with God Psalms 113:1 says praise ye the Lord Praise oh ye Servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth forever and more so let's just say hey I I haven't been praising God the way I should be well this time from this moment ever for from this time forth and forever more let's bless the name of the Lord from the rising of the sun and the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised the Lord is high above all the nations and His glory above above the heavens who is like unto the Lord Our God who is like unto the Lord well you put a football game on and you'll see a lot of Praises going on and they're able to to praise their God what about us who know the real God what about us we ought to light this place up more than any Auditorium any ball field amen the Lord is worthy to be praised but who is like unto the Lord Our God no one but the Lord answers the question in Isaiah 45 verse5 Isaiah 45:5 he says I am the lord and there is none else and there is no God beside me I GED thee though thou has not known me isn't that wonderful just like we take care of our our children when they were real young they didn't even know who we were but we took care of them right verse six that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I am the lord and there is none else I think when we come into his house we ought to let him know there's none like you Lord I Want To Praise You like there's none like you now think about this I know you're you're not going to go to a football game today and you know rip your shirt off and paint your body and say go go go I understand that but you're here in church why won't you give your your best to God because God no give your best but I know that's the heart you understand what I'm saying they're giving their best to their God why not us give our best to our god you understand what I'm saying here Isaiah 45 Verse 18 when we turn our focus on God it you know worship and praise just becomes organic for thus sayith the Lord that created the heavens and God that formed the Earth and made it he that established it he created it not in vain he he formed it to be inhabited I am the lord and there is none else I just love the scriptures now look hey I'm not going to give you any emotion but this word ought it ought make you emotional this word ought to make you emotional Isaiah 45: 211 who have declared this from ancient times and who have told it from that time have not I the lord and there is none else there's no I'm sorry there is no God else beside me a just God a savior there is none beside me amen I'm so glad that God made his self known to us unto me look unto me he said and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else David in his prayer in 1st Chronicles chapter 17 he says oh Lord there is none like thee neither is there any God beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears Psalms 868 I know I'm going through a number of scriptures here Psalms 868 among the God there is none like unto thee Oh Lord neither there are any works like unto thy works so there's so many scriptures describing how great God really is it ought to make it so easy for us to come into church and worship God from the dictates of our heart he is God he is he is the Lord of lords he is the king of kings he is our savior he's our healer he's our provider he's Jehovah Gyra he is he is everything to us and it's something when we have that in our hearts we don't need to be pumped up it just wants to it just wants to come out now I'm going to tell you why it's so hard for us to come into church that way is because we don't come with that mindset when we come into church we think it's the church's job to get us to to remember that well hey it's it's the preacher's job to tell you what you need to remind yourself of that the other six days of the week amen spend some time with Jesus spend some time reading the word spend some time count your blessings name them one by one put your mind set your mind on the things of God that he is God there's none like him he he gave you breath today he let the sun come up today he gave us a place to worship today he gave us brothers and sisters of light precious Faith he has filled our heart with love he is God there's there are so many things to praise God for amen I just say we ought to praise God more we ought to testify the things of God more amen we ought to EXA exalt the name of the Lord Psalms 34:3 says oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together was that our opening verse to exalt the Lord so here we've come together oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together that means if one person is exalting the Lord the other one supposed to be doing it too amen this isn't just for those who are trying to be you know spiritual during service you know all the thoughts we get from the devil right well I don't want to stick out like a sore thumb and you know and I you I didn't do it yesterday and you know you just lay every thought aside and praise God because he's worthy forget about what's happened forget about where you're at forget everything and exalt him enter into his Gates you know sometimes we we think that we worship God through the songs and then we're all done with worship we forget to worship the word amen because he is the word we need to have that worship going throughout the service are you with me now we need to exalt the name of Jesus I believe we ought to use the name of Jesus more don't you the Bible says his name is a high tower in his name demons are cast out all kinds of demons demons of sickness Demons of depression anxiety demons that want to Puff us up Demons of arrogancy haughtiness selfishness demons that want to esteem ourself right didn't didn't Jesus tells Satan thou Savor the things that uh uh appeal to man demons that lift us up demons that want to give us a reputation come on I want to hear some amens because there the I'm talking about demons see the difference is is these demons are attacking us demons that cause anger frustration confusion Strife fighting the Demons of this world Demons of pleasure all sorts of demons did you know demons can get on you when you talk to other people did you know brothers and sisters can have demons on them oh we just talked about all these and we're guilty there's demons that are religious but they just got a form there's no no godly power there it's why the Bible says don't entertain that turn away get away because you think you're strong enough but I'll tell you what Spirits can get on you and you don't even realize it so we need to use the name of the Lord more to cast the demons out of our life are you with me amen say in the name of Jesus Christ get out of me get out of my mind get out of my thoughts he tempts us and oh yeah that oh that sounds cool yeah I would just a demon trying to rob Glory from God look we had a perfect example Jesus made himself of no reputation why would we want to he's our example we follow his steps now everybody's got a reputation here by the way all you need to do is look at anybody here and you know they got a reputation but don't make it don't make one don't make one let your life let your life speak you understand what I'm saying let God build the reputation if he wants to build it but the thing is God wants to be glorified through your body he wants to be glorified through your mind through your thoughts through your words through your actions when people look at you God wants them to see him we need to remember that we need to recognize our own demons be courageous about getting them out you know sometimes we are so bothered by somebody else's mistakes and boy we just wish they really know how to push your button but you know we don't even care if our own button we is pushed we don't care if we push our own button we don't care how upset we get how angry we get we don't really doesn't bother we're just we're going to show we're right that's the time we need to take a stand for Jesus use the name of Jesus say Satan get get out of get out of me get out of my mind this is not your will your will is for me to to walk in humility to esteem my my brother my sister my wife my husband my child amen better than me lift God up the name of the Lord is a mighty weapon we need to exercise it more in our lives it's an honor to actually speak the name name of the Lord Jesus amen to have those words come out notice how the devil anoints the world world to take that same name Jesus in a evil way just they curse with it and then when they're trying to be halfway good you know they say it you know you know kind of like so it's not so obvious but from the heart it's the same intent you know what I'm trying to say to you the same name in other words they're using the name to condemn somebody they they become judge right come on I you know what I'm saying I don't have to say the words you've all heard them but to us we come into God's house we lift up the name of the Lord amen we praise the name of the Lord Jesus Acts 4:12 if you want to write this down Acts 4:12 I forgot to tell you but I'm glad that you got an extra hour of sleep today because you know we got a lot of stuff on the plate today there's a lot at the table today the Bible says neither is their salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven that would be here on Earth given among men whereby we must be saved amen I believe we have to be saved in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no other name look at Ephesians chapter 3:14 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of the Lord Jesus Christ of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named we are all Jesus we're all the family of Jesus I don't think there's no one big Bigg ger and better than anyone we're all the family Philippians chapter 2:9 wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess it that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father now I'm going to say this to the unbeliever that is optional you don't have to do that you don't have to come to the altar bow before him but one day when this life is all over every human being that was ever born is going to Bow before the Lord if they hadn't bowed yet I just wonder brother Johnson if the bride's going to be sitting on the throne at that time next to the groom when they do it I don't know but I'll say it like this it will happen because the word says it's going to happen I'm I'm just glad that I have such a desire every morning and I get up boom hit the floor and thank God because he's the Lord of lords the King of Kings he's worthy to be praised every single day he gives you a new day he don't owe you he don't owe you anything that's right he don't owe you health he don't owe you a sound mind he doesn't owe you anything but we owe him everything he doesn't have to give me another day to live but if he does I want to show that appreciation I want to thank him for that day if he puts Bread on my table I'm going to thank him for that bread if he provides a Bill to be paid I'm going to praise him for that because he don't owe it to me I owe God everything now God has given us his name and we need to use it more in our lives it's a very powerful name honestly if you pray in the name of Jesus Christ you need to expect your prayers to be heard they're Mighty do you know I run to that name every morning every morning I run into the name of Jesus I call on that name every day I sing in that name every day I pray in that name every day that name is above every other name that I speak the Bible says and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him we've often heard around Christmas time his name shall be called called wonderful and counselor and mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace his name is wonderful wonderful as great as the name of Jesus is did you know there's something above his name think about that that God actually has something above the name that you use to cast demons out to pray for your food that we worship when we come to church the songs that we sing about Jesus there's something above that name turn with me if you would to Psalms 138 verse one Psalms 138 verse one I want entitled this message praise and dot dot dot because I wanted you to fill in the blank want you to fill in the blank Psalms 138:1 says I will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will I Sing Praises unto thee I will worship toward thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy Truth for thou has magnified Thy word above all thy name name I want us to consider just how much God manies all his words of this beautiful book called The Bible that every word in here he magnifies it higher than his name you know we're we're very good to use that name of Jesus when we want to God wants us to become as interested in following this word as he wants us to you understand what I'm saying we need to exalt the word of God like he does we need to magnify the word of the Lord if God has magnified his word above his own name how much more ought we to ify his word above our own lives come on we've heard of prayer being more important than necessary sleep this word obedience to this word is more important than anything that you're going through in your life the word of the of the Lord is his will it's his will it's the only book that we know without a shadow of of a doubt it's his will if I told you God spoke to me and he told me to go buy a brand new pair of shoes and give it to so and so down the street we would know there could be question there could be doubt about that even though he might have spoke it but this word there's no doubt about it there's no question about it and this word no matter how much we think it's not that big a deal cuz I've been baptized it needs to be exalted in our life we need to lift it up more we need to get into it we need to say God what would you have me to do the word of God is his will and his will is exalted above his name amen according to Ephesians 1:11 the Bible says that God works out all things after the counsel of his own will think about that he's working out everything to the counsel of his own will right his will is more important than my will in fact he made it pre pretty clean to me when I first met him deny your will deny yourself our will doesn't mean anything when it interferes with God's will your will means everything when it lines up to his will see the whole world is full of people who want to use God for their benefit right but the Bride of Jesus Christ knows her position she's been called to do his will the interest is to do the will of God to exalt the word of God in their life I just want to be like God I want to magnify his word above everything I think we need to talk about it more testify about it more and I think we need to to read about his will more to share it with our texting a little bit more I think when we're having to make a decision in your life am I going to go to church or if I'm going to do this personal thing for my life I think you need to exalt the word of God Amen come on it's the word it's easy it's easy it is easy to take the book and eat it what's hard is to have it digested it's easy to say Amen to the word but it's another thing to say I'm going to live that what was meant behind that amen was so be it my life because I'm gonna do it I'm Gonna Leave Here different than when I came amen what has to change a lot is our attitude the determination to pick up that book and read it and say God I'm gonna follow it today I'm G to walk in your will today Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 now we've read the scriptures before and uh boy you know time is just it's going by fast I'll just tell you that but you got extra hour sleep now we've read this scripture before but I want to just come into it from another Point here not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so this is the an important reason we need to exalt the word to magnify the word in our life look here how Jesus exalts his word above his own name many shall say in to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you what's the end result dep part from me ye that work iniquity so what is working iniquity a working iniquity is when God has spoken to you out of his precious word that he's exalted he exalted it so much that when you came to church he spoke it to you amen and something inside of your heart just oh God I think you're speaking to me and then you walk out and you say boy that was a good service and you don't put into action what he spoke to you that's what it means to work iniquity so this is a dangerous place Jesus said it'd be better if you had not known the way of Truth than to have known it and to walk away from it the Bible says that judgment first begins in the house of the Lord this is a place where we subject oursel to our our bridegroom he's our head now I know a lot of people don't like headship but we have a head and the bride has a head and it's important the little things that he's dealing with us now I'll tell you where Satan gets us a lot of times is none of us are going to deny that we believe the Bible is the truth we would never do that but the very fact that we would not follow to obey a part of it shows something is missing in our relationship with God and where Satan gets a lot of us is well that's just one part and you know everybody is human everybody fails everybody's not perfect and I agree with that praise God for the blood praise God that if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up but there's no scripture in that Bible that tells me I can have that kind of attitude the attitude it wants me to have is to press towards that image to come into His likeness to spend more time on my knees and say God help me with my My Flesh that's so weak and that keeps making this mistake and doesn't doesn't try hard enough help me to to fast more to pray more to spend more time with you Lord that's what it's looking for looking for more heart looking for more heart do you think that was Brother Bruce that was saying God wants it coming from the heart or was that the spirit of God speaking through Brother Bruce come on in the light of the message you tell me what looked like Brother Bruce I know but what was in iring him what was behind him brother brandham said in the message the token he said full obedience to the word of God brings God full obedience to the word brings God the word Eternal into you and that is the token when the word is in you it's Christ in you now too often because we feel his presence and we claim that he's filled us with the Holy Ghost and I've got the Holy Ghost and yeah I received it I'm years ago that you know we just we just take that scripture and we just say goes in one ear and out the other but look how could brother Brandon made also made this statement he says how can you say you have the Holy Ghost and deny the word that's being spoken and the Holy Ghost wrote the word word so doing things in the name of the Lord is wonderful it really is but obeying his perfect will is what counts right that's what counts brother brandham said about six months earlier in another message called the token he said the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price you can't get it until you pay the price well brother John I thought he freely died for me I thought he went to Calvary for me what Jesus did at Calvary didn't make me become obedient I literally had to repent of my ugly sinful nature and say I'm sorry God right I accept your sacrifice at Calvary to cover me but that didn't mean the Holy Ghost came inside that's my first step to get my life covered by the blood I still need to go through a process is called sanctification that's where the word of God you hear the word and the word says you need to cut your hair because it's too long my hair looked like Sister Sister Lor's over there at one time and so when I cut my hair I was becoming obedient to the word there was a process of sanctification going on you and it wasn't up to me Brother Joseph how long I had to go through that process it's not up to me to say oh I went through it long enough and now I've got the Holy Ghost you know it may take one minute it may take 30 years I don't know because your heart is different than anybody else's in here everybody's heart is different I want to continue reading this we got to pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is catch this pay it there's no shortcuts you got to pay it he said that's right what then he says what does it mean to pay it he says believe it and accept it so I wonder now how many caral believers do we got here in how many spiritual Believers what does that really mean to believe it and to accept it well he defines that in the next sentence he says full obedience to the whole word of God that's what it really means to believe and to accept is to become obedient to the full word of God he says full obedience to the word of God will entitle you to the token full obedience not the part of it not the part of it as far as your denomination goes or we might say it like this not the part of it as your denominational thinking goes right because we're not a denomination here but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ think about that full obedience to the word is what brings you into Christ I thought it's separate I thought I got my relationship with this and the word is different I thought church is different the word is different and Christ is in my heart no we don't serve a trinity the Holy Ghost the word of God and the one who died for you at Calvary is all one is all one you can't separate them full obedience to the word let's continue on Matthew chapter 7 back there where we were in Matthew 7 therefore whosoever heareth these says of mine that's this book and doeth them God is going to liken you unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and The Rock descended I'm sorry and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock now I'll tell you that's the life I want right there that is the life I want I want a life that cannot be moved well I can't get that with my own thinking my own smarts my own ability my own money I'm sorry it can only be done when you stand on the word of God you you let your life be with this word is full obedience to the word of God you know we we need to take a good look at our lives I know where you're standing on ain't what you say what you obey it ain't what you say it's what you obey and everyone that heareth the Saints of mine these Saints of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man right which built his house upon the sand and the rains descend the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell oh and great was the fall of it I'll tell you Rapture hasn't taken place yet how do we know this how do we know this brother Dennis because we're still here that's how we know but I tell you I want that ticket in my hand when it does happen I know if the ticket I know if the Rapture happens tomorrow I do not have the day after tomorrow to get ready are you with me teach us to number our days Lord we're running out of time and we need to get serious with this word this we need to fall in love with this word it's not about just having some sort of Association or how we are viewed by other people look you may be the only one going in a Rapture why would you want to compare yourself with somebody compare yourself with the word that's the only thing that can get you there I cannot get you there I cannot get you there but I do believe with the prophet that that office will lead you there it's ordained to God loves you more than I love you and you know I love [Laughter] you God's going to see you through God's going to see you through but we have to take the word we got to leave here and start putting into practice and not be thinking I'm doing it enough we got to cast that demon out if we were doing enough we'd be out of here in fact the prophet said when when you you're as close as you can get to him he'll take you you're still here we have a work to do too right all right brother Bram said then the church age I have to skip a lot of stuff the normal procedure where you study for hours and hours and then you skip it I don't understand that brother B said in the message the Le seean Church age he says he stands outside is a good example he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word that's how we follow him we can't follow him by joining the church by paying tithes we follow him by obeying the word so we come here Lord I want to follow you some more I want to follow you closer I want to draw nigh to you speak to my heart tell me what you want me to do and then when he speaks it to you and you do it then you're following him otherwise you're just following a denominational view oh yeah God's in my heart no matter what yeah I've got the baptism I don't care what anybody says I know I got it what if the word is telling you you're you're missing something see you're disagreeing with God I'm so glad we have the word and I'm so glad that God sent a prophet to tell what that word meant right he's a Seer not only he sees but he's he rightly divides the word for us I don't want to choke anybody but I'm glad that God had a prophet in the Ephesian Church age who wrote 14 books of this Bible that every other Church age messenger had to read and and everybody else did we need to preach the same message that Paul preached we need to believe the same word that Paul preached to us no different I tell you this message is not a different message it's the same message he's the same yesterday today and forever our ultimate focus in life ought to be doing more of the will of God in every day not just our our job or the house or where he wants us to live I'm talking about the important things in life what are the important things I'm talking about what you think about every day what you talk about every day trying to go through the day and not put God in it is wrong and then calling I'm going to pray about where I'm going to live is something important when you want to kick them out of your everyday life come on I feel like preaching today I think we need to be checking our motives checking our objectives you know there's times that we have a motive to do good but we don't we fail to realize that we got other motives mixed maybe I want to you know you're going to do something for the Lord right it's a good motive it really is but then you you kind of want something out of it it becomes a mixed motive I just want to please him don't mix it with the things of the world come on you know what I'm saying let your motive be only for him if you're look at there's only one person that can change your life and that's Jesus Christ there's no human being that no no Seminary no no no uh uh meeting that you can have with the uh Dwayne DWI all these great people only God can change her nature and that simply comes it comes when you say I'm in love with the word I'm just going to start obeying it so we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things that we have heard don't you believe right all right brother Bram said in the message God's only place of worship God's only provided place of worship he said now the word Deuteronomy right that's the fifth book in the Bible is that right is that is that the fifth one okay thank you he said the word itself means two laws the word Deuteronomy and God has two laws the two laws one of them is Disobedience to the word and die and the other is obedience to the word and live there's the two laws I never read that before too often we talk about the Lord and we become careless about his word yes God loves us yes God cares about us but also God has a word for us to live by and he said in Luke 6:46 write it down I'm going to have to go super duper fast and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say I don't want to be of that group that says Lord Lord didn't I do many wonderful things for you while I was alive in my life and then know that there were things that I wasn't being obedient to I don't want to be part of that group I need your prayers you need my prayers you need the prayers of the person sitting next to you we need one another's prayers in fact you know what we need to spend more time praying for one another amen if you love me and I love you we're going to pray together we're going to pray for one another I don't want to neglect the word the word is the most important thing while we come to church I don't want to just praise him and not praise the word I want to do what the Bible says I want to magnify the word above his name I want when I I say amen I want it to be so be it in my life I don't want to have a pitchfork I don't want to say you know I really wish Bob was here today Bob needed to hear that one we don't have any Bobs here so I can say that don't wrestle with the word don't struggle with it Isaiah 4 59 says woe unto him that striveth with his master look he's the Potter we're the clay we don't tell the Potter what to do with us know ye the Lord he is God I think that's the first thing we need to do know the Lord that he is God it is he that had made us and that we ourselves we are the his people and the Sheep of his pasture we are of his blood now think he gave his life at on Calvary for you he gave up his whole life for you that you could have life we need to love this word as much as God loves his word I mean how would you like to be married to somebody that was not even interested in the things you liked wouldn't that be we we call that hell on Earth don't we right why in the world would God want to be with somebody that wouldn't want to do his will it would be hell in heaven right you understand what I'm saying so we need to fall in love with this word more we need to magnify it more we need to to think about its importance when we're not here we come here to get the word and we we leave and we take the word with us man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God every word which word are you leaving out think I would rather spend more time thinking about what I have yet to do than all the things that I have done all the things that I do right if I spend too much time thinking about everything all the great things I've done and how everything is wonderful and I might be missing God trying to tell me I want you to do this are you with me see all right if you got you got a pencil write down Matthew 33 to 30 uh 23 uh through 25 Matthew 23 23 through 25 and this is the scribes and Pharisees and they left out part of the word and and Jesus said you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't leave out part of the word God is looking for full obedience can you say Amen to that all right you going to bear with me a little bit I figured I could do this today because it wasn't Pastor appreciation day and you know I am so sorry that this is taken so long in the message the token brother brand says full obedience to the word of God the word Eternal in you and that is the token when the word is in you when the word is in you all right in the rising of the sun brother random said this Earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to The Obedience of the word of God okay so so here it is I'll just say it like this it is the the holy spirit that quickens your body to fulfill to manifest the word the thing is it's got to start with one thing a desire inside your heart I heard the word I'm interested in pleasing you Lord in fact I want that to be above all my will I want to do your will when God sees that you have that desire and you're and you're knocking you're seeking you're you're calling upon him you're saying God I want to love you the way your word is calling me to love you when he sees that then he sends his spirit and he will Quicken the very thing that you're Desiring in his word and you will manifest it amen do not wait for God to fill you with the Holy Ghost so you can obey the word it ain't going to work like that he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him so there has to be some action being put forth on our ends it's a love relationship you can't get the Holy Ghost by coming to church you can't get the Holy Ghost by just paying ties it takes heart it takes heart you got to get your heart involved exalt the word I come here to exalt the word too often we just come with greedy hands it's all about me not all about me it's all about him that's why I'm here I understand if we're young in the Lord but look if you've tasted that the Lord is good he expect some maturing to take place are you with me all right in the message Investments brother R says how how does this happen how does it come by all night fasting he said well that's good by all night prayer meeting well that's still good but obedience to the word is where it comes obeying the word their interest of what part of the word I'm not obeying you ever looked Lord how can I get things better how can I get more joy how can I get more peace how can I how can I just have this energy to serve you well let's start with Lord is there anything in my life that I'm not doing that you've asked me to do a month ago did I miss something see you know what's happen happening when you ask that question you're getting real with your heart you're getting more into your heart you got to meet God in there he says in that day I'll meet you in there right here amen that's where God wants to meet you right inside your heart get that word in there in the message blind bmus brother B says just like the brass serpent why that serpent didn't have any no virtue in it it was a piece of brass they brought it up out of Egypt neither did the pole have any virtue in it not a bit but it was obeying what God Said do what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God Amen sometimes we look at everything carnal well this doesn't matter and that doesn't matter and you know it doesn't matter how you act in church and it doesn't matter what you it doesn't matter if you come God still you know what there's no virtue in that type of thinking amen you to cast that down there's virtue that comes from obeying the word of God in your life the Bible says let us offer the sacrifice of praise of God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name so we need to praise God we need to use the name of the Lord but what else do we need to do obey the word we need to exalt that that's what's most important the prophet Samuel have and Samuel said have the Lord he's asking a question now have the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord is a good question does he does he have as great Delight he said be hold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams obedience is what matters to God you know we were created to do his will we were born again not to do a different will that we want to do you understand it wasn't just recognizing okay I can't be in the bars and I I I can't play that kind of music and I I can't smoke that stuff anymore but I'm going to go over here and I'm going to start doing this when you're born again you're born again to one will that's the will of God not a different will in this world we got to understand this word is the absolute for the believer am it is what it means to be born again right it isn't something that we just say we're born again because we got baptized 10 years ago come on every day we should be getting closer and closer to God how you doing how's your feelings right now are you wishing I was done I just want to know some of those thoughts you're thinking right now brother Brenham said in the message the resurrection of Lazarus he says look just before the coming of the righteous one the great Son of God God sent an angel down and the angel come to a home that was a respected home now I'm trying to get the word into our homes right now that's why this quote's here if you want angels to visit your home be like zacharias's home they were living upright before the Lord right keeping all the statutes and all the Commandments of the Lord living in perfect obedience to the word in the light that they had I think it matters to God what happens in our home that's right you know we can't come here and like a light switch boop boop right if you want the angels in your home you don't got a hoop hall or anything they encamp round about them that fear of the Lord just submit to the word say God I'm making this I'm rededicating my life to the word I'm bringing into my home I'm bringing it into my life I'm going to make you I'm going to magnify what you're magnifying above your name is your word now and the only way that we could really do it is obey it amen let's stand together I'm going to read one one more scripture it's in Colossians chapter 3:1 15 the Bible says and let the peace of God ruin your hearts how many once that Amen to the which also you are called into one body one body any spirit that tries to separate the body is not of God you're called into one body and be ye thankful come into his his gates with Thanksgiving Amen Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly don't be a popper when it comes to the word of God let it dwell richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord L isn't that beautiful and whatsoever you do in word whatever you're talking about or whatever you do indeed do it do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him amen is that your desire I believe it is you wouldn't be here if it wasn't your desire may it be magnified in our lives amen amen let's sing that little chorus pleasing just want to be pleasing to you pleasing let me be pleasing to you let it everything that I do be pleasing to you we pray let everything I pursue be pleasing oh Lord unto you [Music] please let me be pleasing to you that everything that I do be pleasing to you pray let everything thing I pursue deeply amen let's let's just close our eyes a moment and sing this to them if you know it close your eyes pleasing let me be pleasing to you that everything that I do be pleasing to you pray let everything I pursue be pleasing oh Lord unto you one more time let's just let's just mean it from the depths of our heart please let me be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleasing to you [Music] pray that everything I pursue deeply ising oh Lord to you amen with every head bow every eye closed just she continues to play that I wonder if there's anyone here today that really wants to dedicate your life to the word you feel God calling you to his word praise the Lord God sees Your Heart of Worship right now when your hand is lifted up that's worship to him let's believe it with all of our hearts now as we go to him in prayer our heavenly father you see our hands
