he's really depending on our our prayers amen well this uh evening if you'd like to turn with us to the Book of Proverbs today amen Book of Proverbs with everybody that is gone um we need to double up and triple up on the amens [Laughter] amen we're going to read in the Book of Proverbs chapter 10 we're going to read one verse there and have a word of prayer amen Proverbs chap 10 verse number 12 says hatred stirreth up stries but Love cover all sins am let's look to the Lord in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we come to you Lord so grateful that you take care of us Lord you are our heavenly father you you found us in a world where we didn't know you we didn't care about you and you got our attention and you showed us that we belong to you and you you lifted us up out the myy clay you set us upon a rock to stay amen lord it's so good this evening that we could look to you in prayer father we ask that you would come this evening Lord cleanse us of our sins our iniquities anything that would stand in the way that we would to keep us from being able to receive from you this evening Lord we ask that you would open our eyes hard to see Lord the very message that you you have for us today we want to be dressed in your word we want to be just like you yes Lord we just pray that you would help us Lord may we forget all the thoughts of the day and anything that would hinder us from just entering into your presence now into the opening of the word we do thank you Lord for this time of worship that we had and the songs and being able to express our love to you and now Lord we're just want our hearts to be sensitive to the words that you would speak to us now we thank you for these things we commit this service our hearts and our lives into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated love covers all sins we want to en title this message love that covers amen love that covers God's great love that covered us we all can relate to this subject amen amen Jesus defines the love of the father in John 15:13 he says Greater Love have no man than this than a man laid down his life for his friends amen so we could I could ask this question to you how many loved That Man From Galilee amen he laid down his life for us amen amen and and and this this love the father uh expresses this love in John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen this was the love that covered us amen for God so loved us that he covered us he went and gave his blood that we wouldn't have to am I was a sin I was a sinner amen and I was in a I mean I sin but I was in a very sinful State before I heard him call me I was in the world and I loved the world I smoked I dranked I partied I tailgated I had long hair and pink belt bottoms I was into every type of music and I was a concert entrepreneur if there was a concert I would go to it and I would travel long distances I was a gambler I played cards for Big Money big money I used to run the Poo tables and bars and I I don't know if I still do but I used to have trophies because I would win tournaments and bars I was bad and I've told you before I tore down buildings that other people were trying to build I just didn't like the building being there I sold drugs I I grew marijuana right right in my own home hoping nobody would see it go figure those were bad things but there was something much worse than that amen it was what was inside of me I had a selfish nature life was all about myself amen I would do whatever I had to do to get what I wanted I basically lived for myself I was self-centered I never woke up and said Lord what would you have me to do today Lord lay some soul on my heart I never did that I could not care about that I only cared about me and when I didn't get what I wanted I got angry amen I just want to know is there anybody in this building today that can relate to this the scriptures defined me I was a sinner that lived in the lust of My Flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature a child of Wrath even as others I was dead in trespasses and sins and I walked according to the course of this world and whenever I thought about God that there was a god there and I was going to have to answer to these my life I knew that I didn't know them I was an alien from God I didn't have any hope I was without God in this world amen but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins he quickened us together with Christ right for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast I'll say God loved the unlovable amen he loved the unmerciful he loved the unbearable he loved the selfish he loved the sinner right there was no good thing in me I was a good for nothing but God Who Loved Me was rich in Mercy amen and God's love covered a multitude of sin in my life amen but even today God's love is just as powerful to cover the sin in my life amenes we just keep repenting we keep surrendering ourselves to God the Bible tells us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins amen and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness am just confess him be honest with God Amen Romans 8 tells us blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin amen that word impute means to take inventory or to count them or to write them down blessed is the man in whom the Lord will not count his sins will not write them down will not take inventory and say you know you're going to have this amen we are a blessed people amen blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered amen Romans 4:7 if you want to write it down blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered am amen only God can cover our sins amen God's love covered a multitude of sins amen his love was so great that he wounded oursel for our transgressions it pleased the Lord to bruise Jesus for our iniquities he did it to cover us How [Music] Great Is Our God Amen How Great Is Our God and all will see how great How Great Is Our God that's right God's love is so powerful that is still covering I'll say this a multitude of sin in my life amen amen his mercies are new every morning and if they weren't I would be in trouble we would be in trouble amen look at the strength of God's love it Bears all things it believes all things it hopes all things and it endures all things and if God's love wasn't like that we would not be sitting here today amen Jesus if he just said I'm going to save you but you know you better not make any mistakes we would be in trouble today today 1 John 2:1 I want this one to be on the board 1 John chap 2:1 my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not there's the message that you sin not and if any man sin praise God that's right we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous we have an advocate now that word advocate means in intercessor a counselor or a comforter so when we go to do something wrong when we sin we have a comforter in Jesus Christ we have a counselor that can help us and we have someone that will intercede for us in our behalf and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world Amen that word propitiation means atonement for wrong for any kind of injury anything that we do it's the making amends for a wrong that we have done he is the propitiation for when we do wrong yes now God wants to cover us every day he does not want us to go one day without that covering amen God's love is still among us and we're still being covered by his love amen how many got the love of God in your hearts amen amen his love will still cover a multitude of sin in our life right now there's no sin that God won't cover there's no sin that God won't cover the Bible tells me outside a blasphemy is that right amen so has anybody blasphemed the holy ghost that means we can be covered by his love amen no matter what we've done no matter what the past has been we can be covered just because he loves us amen God's agape love is still covering us and when his love abides in us it will literally do the same thing it does when it wasn't in us can you say Amen to that amen just before Jesus gives his life to be crucified during the Last Supper he says in St John chap 13:34 a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another amen now notice the Commandment is nothing less than what he did he didn't say try to love like I love when you can it was a commandment you got to love not just the way you want to the way you think but exactly the way I Loved You amen and if he covers Us that love through us will cover one another right and by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another so God knows it's no longer saying well God knows my heart hey look everybody's going to know everybody's going to know when you love the way God loves John 15:9 as the father have loved me so I have loved you now continue in Not Your Love continue in my love we have to continue to Manifest this love the same way that Christ did so how did Christ do it well just think about that woman at the well she had five husbands didn't beat her up but his love covered think about it look at the woman caught in adultery look at Zacharias what about the disciples when they were just acting who is the greatest one what about when the disciples wanted to call down fire from heaven amen I mean love covers and we've got to be able to love just like he loved amen not make stipulations of why we can or what we can't we just need to get the love of God shut up in our heart by the Holy Ghost verse 10 if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love see the key word here is abide not in and out not up and down not trying when it's convenient not with respect to persons just abide in the love amen okay imagine for a moment now well I'll just tell you something that happened to me when I when we were building this building at trusted tool and uh we had just painted the floor and it was a it was an epoxy and and and when you if you paint a big 5,000 sare foot floor and you walk in there I mean you're going to get dizzy and we were in there working on the electrical and I'm telling you we were just sitting against the wall three of us and we were just laughing our head off because we just we didn't realize what would happened but we just we got intoxicated the point that I'm saying is when the atmosphere was what it was was there was no respect to persons it wasn't just two out of three that got it and when you're abiding in God's love there's no respect to persons the atmosphere just gets everybody these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full amen the very purpose that God has given us this commandment is so that our joy would remain inside of us amen that we might be full of joy well he's the only one that can give joy amen the joy of the Lord is our strength we need it and if we don't abide in his love we're not getting the joy either come on let's say Amen because this is the word we this com this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you there it is again Greater Love have no man than this and a man lay down his life for his friends and you are my friend if you do whatsoever I commanded you and what has he commanded us to do to love one another just love one another it's why is it so hard because humanly understand when I was in the world before I came to Christ I had people that I loved sure he did people in the world they have people who who they they love one another even Jesus said if you just love those who love you right that's nothing amen there's no joy the Lord in the world there's a temporary fix but it ain't joy we can have joy when we don't have any money the Bottom's falling out but one thing that we do have is the love of God in our heart it covers Us when Christ laid down his life for us he was covering our sin amen and Christ inside of us today will cause us to lay down our life for one another and cover one another now I'll tell you you didn't like that message you're not going to like the rest of the tape 1 John 3:16 Says hereby perceive we the love of God let's define it now what does it mean to love one another like I have loved you John 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for for the Brethren that's right amen lay it down amen what does that mean to you when is the last time you lay down your life and how many times do you lay down your life think about that statement the love of God is still covering a multitude of sin and it's being manifested in the Bride of Jesus Christ today I believe that just like it did when it was in Christ in the bride they're taking the word seriously yes they're taking this word that says this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you and God's love covered us amen and that same love inside of us is going to cover one another amen that's the realness of God being in a person amen you know so the whole church World wants to say God's with me but where is the manifestation it's got It's not good enough just to say that we we love people it's not good enough to to love people with human love human love is with respect to persons you know one minute you can love your spouse and the next minute you don't even want to be with them I don't know why it's quiet we should be about to say Amen to the truth and it don't have to be a spouse it could be one of our brothers and sisters it could be a a a coworker our love is only as strong as to cover our sins our love wants our sins covered God's love wants to cover one another's sins amen and even though you don't want to do it because you're so bothered the spirit inside of you it wants to do it amen that's why we need to be filled with God's love it's without respect to persons now the scriptures are interwoven with how the love of God inside of us covers the sins of one another it's interwoven and I just want to go through some of them let's take a look at Matthew chapter 6 Jesus here in Matthew chapter 6 he's teaching teaching us how or teaching the disciples I'll say teaching us teaching me how to pray and in verse 12 he says and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors right so don't ask God to forgive you of your debt if you're not caring about forgiving others so this is you know this is now God God wants to put you and your brother in the prayer where maybe you just want to leave everybody out you just want to pray this God this between me and you I need your help and God I need you to forgive me I need you in this situation but God says no no bring your brother bring your sister in this and lead us not to temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingom the power and the glory forever and ever amen amen amen amen so be it that's a conclusion and then he gives us a stipulation for forgiveness for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you and then gives us an ultimate warning but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses in other words if we do not cover other men's trespasses then God is not going to continue to cover ours amen we can start the race right but you're going to have a chance to love like he loves to cover like he covers amen and if you don't walk in that then God just says you know what I'm not going to continue to forgive you of yours you believe that that's that's that's the word amen I know it's a hard pill to swallow but this is the character of the Bride Matthew 18: 211 Matthew 18: 211 then came Peter to him and said Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him now let's not get carried away till seven times that's an extreme amount Peter was hoping to only have to Express a portion of God's Divine love just a portion but notice God's love bears all things right it endures all things there's no seven time limit with God Amen and Jesus said unto him I say not unto thee until seven times don't get that into your head that came from the devil but until 70 times Heaven amen we got to get our perspective right of what it means to love one another amen it really means to lay down our life for one another I don't want to just cover my brother seven times and say well look at I feel pretty good because you know out in the world I wouldn't even done it what does that matter if the word tells me to keep covering because look I keep sinning against God I keep falling against God I keep needing to have to ask for Mercy I keep having to say God I'm sorry for those thoughts amen who am I to say no I'm not going to forgive this brother I'm not going to forgive this sister no enough's enough I've had it what are you doing you're not expressing the Christ amen you're not expressing the love of God that covers it's a different love and we've got to recognize it we've got to come into the love of God we've got to make sure that we are so full of the love of God brother Ben says make sure you get to the place where you get perfect love lay everything aside amen you're not born with it you're not born with it all you got to do is be honest with your thoughts you'll see be honest with your thoughts check your thoughts and you'll see think about Jesus hanging there on the cross just saying father forgive them they don't know what they're doing well you know to me if somebody was pulling my beard pulling Jonathan's beard putting a a a crown and and whipping me and blindfolding me and and and taunting me and and and making fun of me and I'm going to say they don't even know what they're doing I would be so enraged am you know what you're doing you shouldn't be doing this to me but he could see beyond the natural into a spiritual realm amen that knew they were deceived and they really thought what they were doing was the right thing the Bible says there will come a day amen when they'll kill you thinking they're doing me a service you know some people won't forgive other people because they think they know better where's that scripture where's that scripture Luke 17 how many's enjoying this messag amen all right all right all right you got to let me know amen Luke 173 says take heed to yourself okay this is take heed to yourself if th thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repents you have a job to do forgive them and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day he turns again to you saying I'm sorry thou shall forgive him amen now you can't do that in your flesh amen it takes the Holy Ghost to do that now if you're saying well I I just can't do that well you know something good that you've identif identified the first need now the second is get more of God Amen because he's not going to tell us to do something if we can't do it right it's good that we realize we can't do it on oursel but it's wrong that we don't humble ourselves and say God h need more of your love to make it Jesus continues here to speak in MA Matthew chapter 18 verse 23 Matthew 18:23 if you're writing it down he continues here to speak of a servant who wants forgiveness we all want forgiveness but he refuses to give it he says therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought to him which owed him 10,000 talents I think we went through this before and 10,000 talents is equivalent to 200,000 years of Labor not one year not one month not one lifetime not two lifetimes 200 ,000 that's a big bill today it's about 3.40 uh it's all about three and a half billion dollars that's the bill that he owed that's the debt he owed now this is of course representing our Salvation amen what it's really representing here for as much as he had for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fou down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all impossible to pay it all but notice his attitude Lord have mercy on me have patience with me then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion amen what turned the thing around he still owed the bill but it was his attitude that turned it around so he losed him and he forgave him the debt this servant was broken he owed a debt he couldn't pay right but he met the Lord's requirement now what is the Lord's requirement the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit A broken contrite heart oh God thou will not despise amen this man was broken the Bible tells us in Psalms 34 that the Lord is is nigh unto them of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit amen this man he became broken and he realized that he could not make make it without the grace of God Amen and so he presented this sacrifice Lord have patience with me and I will work my life to pay everything that I can he didn't say Lord have mercy on me and just go walk his way live any kind of life he wanted his in he felt in debted I'm going to pay amen with my life verse 28 but the same same servant who was just forgiven went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a 100 Pence that's only about a 100 days labor lot different than 200,000 years a lot less and he laid hands on him and he took him by the throat which that didn't happen to him but took him to the by the throat and said pay me what what you OST and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying same thing same thing he said have patience with me and I will pay thee all amen same broken contrite spirit verse 30 and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay his debt wow what do you think of this this was a two-faced a believer that was two-faced he had a broken and contrite spirit towards God and an unmerciful Spirit towards others amen twoof face the servant wanted to be covered for his debt but he was unwilling to cover somebody else's debt which was much much much less and I'll tell you when you compare your salvation with anything that's ever been done against you you cannot compare it amen so when his fellow servant saw his fellow servants saw what was done they look at this they were very sorry in other words they knew this is wrong when you see somebody that's unwilling to forgive or help somebody you know that spirit's wrong amen you just do right they were very sorry and they came and they told their lord all that was done amen now then his Lord after he had called him he said unto him look at the first thing first he had a broken contrite spirit he got into the presence of God he he got a gift of of forgiveness from God but now because of his attitude that he had towards another human being he said oh thou Wicked servant amen I forgave thee all that debt because you desired me to now because I forgave you should us not thou also had compassion on your fellow servant even as I had pity on you we've got to love one another as God loves us and here's this inner scripture that's interwoven that's teaching us that God has an expectation he had a choice to make he could choose to forgive and he could choose to hold a grudge he could choose to forgive he could choose to hold it against him you pay me throw you in prison a lot of times we throw people out amen out of our Circle brother man s draw a bigger Circle draw them in God gave this man a choice and his Lord was wrought and delivered him to the tormenters till he should pay all that was due him right here is a man that one time had a broken and contrite spirit and God forgave him he was going to heaven just as pure as anything because he came with a right Spirit a right attitude and he said I will pay all that I owe Thee I will pay thee with my life I will give you my life and I will serve you then somebody else owed him something and instead of being remembering God forgave me I should not forgive those who trespass against he had developed acquired a different Spirit it wasn't a broken contrite anymore it was no more humble it was proud I've been forgiven I'm a Christian I got favor with God I'm special you're special without the love of God we ain't going to get you anywhere it's going to bring us down amen unforgiveness is an offense against God God doesn't want fellowship with somebody that he has forgiven he wants fellowship with somebody who has forgiven others right that's kind after his kind seed after his seed right he wants fellowship with someone that's loves just like he loves amen it's it's not just a do and don't commandment he's expressing his heart now of course it's our choice we don't have to forgive we can hold grudges we can just say I you know I can't do it and forget it or we can take time to say God I know what I need I need you in here this will make the difference God in here will make the difference amen so likewise verse 35 so likewise shall my heavenly father look at Jesus is saying so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you from your heart forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses amen God really expects us to cover a multitude of sin amen you know sometimes we got to blabber it sometimes we got to talk about it sometimes we got to just you know because we can't seem to Bear it look the word tells me that God would not put anything on me that I couldn't bear amen and his love bears all things that's right amen I would that none of us would have to suffer that is the God's truth and I feel so bad for those that I have have to suffer because of me that is the truth but the bottom line is we all got to come to grips with having the love of God in our heart am we've all got a face that I've got to got to get more filled with so filled with God that at any time that somebody ask for forgiveness I can forgive them amen and I can mean it from my heart brother Ram says lay everything aside until you get to the place where you can even love your enemy and I'll tell you your enemy is your enemy right your enemy is not H it's kind of my brother kind of my no it's your enemy amen and whoever your worst enemy is get to the place where you can love them like you love your best friend amen this is the Perfection that God is looking for all of us be he perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect 1 Peter CH 4:7 we can put that up there 1 Peter chap 4:7 how many feels we're we're at the end how many feels we're at the end the end of time the coming of the Lord amen you were kind of thinking I was at the end of the service didn't you huh I I I was catching that feeling all right first Peter 4:7 but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and and watch unto prayer amen and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins amen we need it amongst us you know we we get hurt we get offended and we get bothered and we think we got some right to go home bothered about something all that's do is telling everybody that you need more love amen really I understand it's not right offenses are going to come I know that hey look greater Is God that's in you and this offense that's coming from somebody else amen we believe in a God that's able to keep us to make us handle things I got a few quotes I wanted us I I wanted me to read for us the seven Church agents brother BR says I tell you that's a very good thing to preach on little children love one another as I get old in the ministry now and my about in my 21st year I think all the time as I go along the more that I think of the Lord Jesus the more that I think of the Lord Jesus the more I begin to find that it's love that covers the whole thing amen he and he quotes the scripture the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost taking sides with Jesus he says and now and you know love is blind about all about about to those those things around us he said love covers up a multitude of sin you know perfect love cast out fear cast out sin cast out Discord what does it he says love does it amen we've got to exercise that amen we've got to speak it we got to believe it don't wait till you feel it feeling I tell you feeling feelings are not always right like the Bible says or two or three are gathered together in my name I will be there in the midst we don't got to feel that we just got to believe that the love of God don't always feel like saying I'm sorry or I forgive you it doesn't we're not always going to have that feeling but we got to do it and mean it from our heart amen it's it's a different than our our human feelings brother brandom said in the message of Satan zeden do you love one another John said little children love one another love one another for love covers a multitude of sin the message power of transformation transformation brother B says I think there is nothing greater than love and love if we can express it now if we can say we have love we're just saying that but when we can express it what we've said that we have then then we show it in ourselves and to me this is that love that Jesus was saying that all men shall know you're my disciples you have love one for when you can love like I can love you basically have the power to not just say I forgive you but from your heart you have just cut out any anything that would bring dissimulation or separation or Discord you just got rid of it you you draw a bigger Circle and you include them in that's what it means to express the love of God now we're not a perfect people brother bar said he says we make our mistakes we do things that's wrong but you see love covers all that right he says we're willing when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another he says yeah that's Warriors that's really men and women that are Gallant yes any man will go out to the battlefield that's got any nerve can walk out there but when he gets knocked down and then he gets up and tries it again see hey we're all trying to be a Christian here that's what it means to get on the battlefield we give our very best to love one another and treat one another right and sometimes we're in our flesh and we do things we say things that we shouldn't it's a truth if you're a real Gallant Soldier say I'm sorry am get back up and say I love you I'm going to try it again and I believe with your prayers I'm going to make it amen amen last quote in the in the message the way to Fellowship brother B says and may God help us tonight to realize how we can have a perfect Fellowship no matter where the storms come whether you're right or wrong you can still have Fellowship amen that's beautiful isn't it and he says the and the only way you can have fellowship at the only way you can have Fellowship comma as your love love perfects period only way you can have Fellowship is walk in the light perfect Your Love grow your love look the world's going down we talked about it our brother brought up why are the churches declining look the bride is is becoming more In His Image she's making herself ready the church is going down but the bride is going up this word is real I don't care nobody in the whole world talks about this through your the course of the week this is the word of God and we need it amen he says don't never forget me if I don't see some of you no more remember this that my theme is love covers it all I thought that is such a beautiful quote I believe in the redeeming love of the Lord Jesus James said James chapter 5 verse 19 brethren if any of you do Heir from the truth and converteth one so notice he aired from the truth and he and and one converteth them let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the air of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins I love that I think brother Mike brought up in our our our our our men's meeting Galatians chapter 6 if if anyone be uh overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual go restore such a one in a spirit of meekness right and what you're doing is you're covering a multitude of sin if you can restore somebody amen but you know everybody's not in the business right amen they are so into their own life this this this message is for the bride 1 John 3:18 says my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth amen praise the Lord amen you I got just I do got a little bit more time I I can I use it amen amen amen Luke chapter 7 let's turn there Luke Chapter 7 it's easy let's say this for a second um sometimes it's easier to forgive verse 36 we're going to start with it sometimes it's easy to forgive somebody isn't it okay say you're you're walking you're walking out of the church you you bump them a little bit you oh I'm sorry oh it's nothing forgive you don't need much love to to to forgive somebody but someone really says something bad about you and you find out about it it's no longer a little bump in the elbow and walking out the door you need a greater love to forgive that amen so look we all have the love of God but the key is do we have enough love to fulfill the scripture and love one another the way Christ loved us that's what we're after all right start here with verse number 36 and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went to the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat and the Pharisees house brought an albaster box of anointment and stood at his feet and be behind him weeping began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with anointment and when the Pharisee which had bid him saw it he spake within himself this man if he were a true Prophet would have known who what who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner Jesus answering said unto Simon said unto him Simon I have something to say unto you and he said master master say on so so one minute you know he's belittling who he really was in his heart but outwardly was acting like oh you're the master you know just an twoof face right amen amen amen let's get let's get what we can get out of these scriptures verse 41 there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 p and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both he says tell me therefore which of the two do you think love me the most and Simon answered and said well I suppose he to whom he uh uh to whom he forgave the most he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou has rightly Judge you answered the question too if you forgive a lot you're going to love a lot amen is that beautiful there's such a message in that thing in other words if you're a person that don't get much forgiveness you know you're probably not going to love very much I say you know what get forgiven a whole bunch because you're going to come out on top you're going to come out on top and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon so he's turning to the woman and talking to Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house and thou gavest me no water for my feet but she is washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in have not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman have anointed my feet with anointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven he's sending a message she was the one that owed 500 P am for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little he just came out and basically rebuked Simon to his face you don't have feel like there's any debt that's why you don't love this woman feels like she owes a big debt to God so she's going to love God Amen and the key for us is to feel more indebted that we could have more of the love that we could express one to another what good is it to have love if you can't show it right amen look and here I don't care about your past I wish we could just take a little thing and just go the past is gone no thoughts of the past today is the day of salvation today is the day we express love today is the day we feel de today is the day we got a new chance to start covering one another let the Holy Ghost In You cover one another we can't but God inside of us can let's Stand Together God bless you I want you to know that was less than one hour hey that's pretty good huh oh well yeah amen Let's uh sing a song We'll have a a word of prayer I want to sing he hideth my soul he hideth my soul and just try to think of this message is for singing the [Music] song a wonderful savior is Jesus my Lord wonderful savior to me

out there and your feet get covered but you're not in the depths God we've all been touched by the love of God we just want to walk deeper deeper deeper in the love of Jesus Amen till all conflict is past the answer is deeper into Christ it's not waiting for the thing to go away it's waiting for us we are the ones that go out there and love one another amen amen you be the one that God is calling to be able to love everyone in every situation and it don't have to be just in this church right in our homes in our in our businesses in our workplaces and our our our relatives amen let's all bow our our hearts in a word of prayer I wonder if every eye closed is there anyone here that says brother John is real simple would you pray for me that I'll have this love that what you spoke on today
