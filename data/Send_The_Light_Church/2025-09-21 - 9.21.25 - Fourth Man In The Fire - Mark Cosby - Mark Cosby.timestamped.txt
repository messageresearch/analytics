[13:15] But I know my belieth

[31:06] Jesus is here.
[31:10] Jesus
[31:11] is here. Oh, Jesus
[31:15] is here.
[31:17] All things are possible.
[31:21] Jesus is here.
[31:26] I'm so thankful that he hears this
[31:28] morning. He hears your prayers. He hears
[31:30] your cries. He even hears the secret
[31:32] things in your heart. So, I'm so
[31:33] thankful that we have a a friend that
[31:35] stick is closer than a brother and um so
[31:39] thankful to be in the presence of
[31:40] family.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Always love to be with you guys. Um miss
[31:44] you guys. Praying for you guys. And so,
[31:47] let's go in a word of prayer.
[31:50] Dear heavenly father, we just thank you
[31:53] for this precious moment, Lord, this
[31:55] precious opportunity, Lord. There's no
[31:58] other place we'd rather be in in your
[32:00] house, Lord. This Lord, we've come here
[32:03] to hear from you, Lord. The prophet said
[32:05] that we we come to hear to see where
[32:07] we're at with you, Lord. And Lord, if
[32:09] you just speak only one word to us,
[32:11] Lord, it'll be worth it all, Lord, us
[32:14] waking up in the morning and making it
[32:16] here, Lord. Please just just soften our
[32:18] hearts, Lord. Deal with us as you deal
[32:20] with sons and daughters of God. Lord,
[32:22] may you open the windows of heaven,
[32:24] Lord, and pour down revelation upon us,
[32:26] Lord.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Give us ears to hear. circumcise our
[32:28] heart, our lips, Lord, that we may be
[32:30] put into service for you, Lord. Father,
[32:33] may you just take over, Lord. May you
[32:35] have your preeminence. May you have your
[32:36] way, Lord. Move your unworthy servant
[32:38] out the way that people may hear from
[32:40] you, almighty God.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; We ask all these things in Jesus
[32:43] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; I just want to say uh it was a wonderful
[32:48] time at the celebration of life
[32:50] yesterday.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; I thought brother John did a wonderful
[32:52] job
[32:54] &gt;&gt; and we're thankful for that. and uh um
[32:56] just keep living on. We got to keep
[32:58] pressing. It's like brother Bruce says,
[32:59] like brother Brand, we got to keep
[33:01] pressing on because there's still work
[33:02] to do. We're still here for a reason and
[33:05] a purpose. So, if we could um we'll turn
[33:08] to our Bibles and we'll read um Daniel
[33:11] chapter 3 and we'll read verses 8
[33:15] through 19 and then I'll have you be
[33:17] seated. Say amen when you get there. I
[33:20] love to hear the turning of pages.
[33:23] I I I've realized it's just not the same
[33:26] when you you read a Bible in your app or
[33:28] a phone. It's just to me I love when it
[33:30] just fits in your hand. You just turn
[33:32] the pages and you see the red letters.
[33:34] It just I don't know. It just it's
[33:36] different. I'm not saying you can't use
[33:38] your phone, but I'm saying to me, I just
[33:39] love
[33:40] &gt;&gt; having that that old Bible just in my
[33:42] hand.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Let's go to um we'll go to verse chapter
[33:46] 3:8. So chapter 3:8. Wherefore at a
[33:49] certain time the Chaldans came near and
[33:51] accused the Jews. Very familiar story
[33:54] here. They spake and said to the king
[33:55] Nebuchadnezzar, "Oh king, live forever.
[33:58] Thou, oh king, has made a decree that
[34:00] every man that shall hear the sound of
[34:02] the cornet, the flute, the heart, the
[34:04] sackbutt, the pulry, and the doulamer,
[34:06] and all kinds of music shall fall down
[34:08] and worship the golden image. And who so
[34:12] fall not down in worship that he should
[34:14] be cast into the midst of a burning
[34:15] fiery furnace?" There are certain Jews
[34:18] whom thou hast set over affairs of the
[34:20] province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach,
[34:22] and Abedneo. These men, O king, have not
[34:25] regarded thee. They serve not thy gods,
[34:27] nor worship the golden image which thou
[34:29] hast set up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in his
[34:32] rage and fury commanded to bring
[34:33] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. Then
[34:36] they brought these men before the king.
[34:38] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them,
[34:40] "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and
[34:42] Abedneo, do you not serve my gods, nor
[34:45] worship uh the golden image which I have
[34:47] set up? Now, if you be ready that at
[34:49] that time, what time you hear the sound
[34:50] of the coronet, flute, heart, sack,
[34:53] butt, pulry, and the doulamer, and all
[34:55] kinds of music, you fall down and
[34:56] worship the image which I have made
[34:58] well. But if you worship not, you shall
[35:00] be cast the same hour into the midst of
[35:03] a burning furnace. And who who is that
[35:06] God that shall deliver you out of my
[35:08] hands? Shar, Mesha, Abednego answered
[35:10] and said to the king, "Oh
[35:11] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[35:12] answer thee in this matter. If it be so,
[35:15] our God whom we serve is able to deliver
[35:18] us from the burning firing furnace, he
[35:20] will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.
[35:22] But if not, be it known thee, O king,
[35:25] that we will not serve thy gods, nor
[35:28] worship the golden image thou set up."
[35:31] And then verse 19, um, we're going to
[35:34] take our, uh, this, we're going to get
[35:35] our other thought from. Then was
[35:36] Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the
[35:38] form of his vishus was changed against
[35:39] him, Shad, Meshach, and Abednego. And he
[35:41] began to command them that they should
[35:43] heat the furnace seven times more than
[35:46] it was heated. Let's keep going. And he
[35:48] commanded the mighty men that they were
[35:49] in his army to bind Sher, Meshach, and
[35:51] Abedneo. Then we'll go to verse um,
[35:53] let's go to verse 22. Therefore, because
[35:56] the king's command was urgent in the
[35:57] furnace exceedingly hot, the flame, the
[35:59] fire slew those men that took up Shad,
[36:01] Meshach, and Abednego, and these three
[36:03] men, Shar, Meshach, and Abednego, fell
[36:05] down into the midst of the burning
[36:07] furnace. They then Nebuchadnezzar men
[36:09] into the midst of the f of the fire.
[36:11] They answered and said, "Thou king,
[36:13] true, O king." And then, I'm sorry,
[36:15] verse 25 is what I'm going to take our
[36:17] thought from. And he answered and said,
[36:18] "Lo, I see the fourth I see four men
[36:22] walking in the midst of the fire. They
[36:24] have no hurt. The form of the fourth is
[36:26] like the son of God. You may take your
[36:29] seats. So the title of the sermon is the
[36:31] fourth man in the fire.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; So I I got this thought last year and I
[36:37] didn't had a chance to minister it and
[36:39] it stuck with me ever since and um and I
[36:43] felt uh the Lord just I felt put on my
[36:45] heart to minister today. And so I I want
[36:48] us to notice this um little backstory
[36:51] that we know that the children, these
[36:53] three Hebrew children, they weren't in
[36:55] Babylon by choice. So they they didn't
[36:58] choose this situation to be in by
[37:00] choice. In fact, the children of Israel,
[37:02] they they they became backsliden. So if
[37:04] we go to Jeremiah, let's go to Jeremiah
[37:07] 25. We'll just get a little a tiny
[37:08] little backstory, read a couple verses
[37:10] here of why they're in the situation
[37:13] that they're in. So we go to Jeremiah
[37:15] 25:es 8-11 and it says in verse 8 um
[37:19] therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts
[37:21] because ye have not heard my words
[37:23] behold I will send and take all the
[37:25] families of the north sayeth the Lord
[37:27] and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[37:29] my servant will bring them against this
[37:30] land and against inhabitants therefore
[37:33] and against all these nations round
[37:34] about and will utterly destroy them and
[37:37] make them astonishment and hissing and
[37:39] perpetual desolations. Moreover, I will
[37:41] take from them the voice of myth, and of
[37:43] the voice of gladness, the voice of the
[37:44] bridegroom, and the voice of the um
[37:48] bride, and the sound of the milestones
[37:49] and light of canos, and the whole land
[37:51] shall be a desolation and astonishment,
[37:53] and these nations shall serve the king
[37:54] of Babylon 70 years. So, we we we
[37:57] realize the backstory that they did not
[37:59] choose to be in this predicament. They
[38:01] did not choose to be in uh idol around
[38:05] them and other means. And so, but I love
[38:09] that they didn't complain. So, they
[38:11] could have said, "Lord, why are you put
[38:13] me in situation? I didn't do anything.
[38:14] I'm I'm faithful." But what they did was
[38:17] they said, "I don't care what you do to
[38:19] us, king. I'm going to serve you no
[38:21] matter what." And he says, "If God
[38:22] doesn't deliver me, I'm still not going
[38:24] to bow down to you." So, I love that
[38:26] kind of that bulldog faith
[38:28] &gt;&gt; because they didn't know necessarily
[38:29] what's going to happen, but they had
[38:30] faith. They had eyes of faith to believe
[38:32] that I'm going to get out the situation
[38:34] because I'm serving the living God. and
[38:36] they had a personal experience with God.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And so, let's let's read a quote from
[38:40] the prophet. He let the the Hebrew
[38:43] children walk right into the fiery
[38:45] furnace. But there was a fourth man
[38:48] standing there with a fan, keeping it
[38:50] off of them. He is always there. So, I
[38:53] can say tonight that that fourth man is
[38:54] in your life too as well. He is always
[38:57] there. No matter where you go, no matter
[38:59] what you're doing, that fourth man is
[39:01] right there in your fire. So, you may be
[39:03] going through a tough time right now,
[39:04] difficult situations. It may feel like
[39:06] you're going into a fiery furnace. But
[39:08] I'll tell you this, that fourth man is
[39:10] with you right now. Jesus Christ is with
[39:12] you right now, fanning the fire off,
[39:14] giving you the courage you need, the
[39:16] strength that you need.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Let's keep that going. So, he says he
[39:20] never leaves. I love that. He He He
[39:22] promised he would never leave you. He's
[39:24] always near. The angel of the Lord
[39:26] encampeth about those who fear him. So,
[39:28] I love that. So fear is the reverence
[39:31] and respect that we have towards God.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; There was three there was the the Hebrew
[39:35] children who wouldn't bow down to the
[39:37] images of King Nebuchadnezzar and they
[39:39] throwed them into a fiery furnace and
[39:41] they spoke to the rock. The fourth man
[39:43] was standing in the fiery furnace there.
[39:45] The rock of ages. Hallelujah. David said
[39:47] if I make my bed in hell he will be
[39:49] there if I take the wings of the morning
[39:51] and I'll fly away. Um, so they was
[39:55] acting upon the word of God when
[39:56] performed a mighty miracle and sent
[39:58] forth a man down among them like that.
[40:01] They kept the fire off them. What was he
[40:03] doing? Acting upon the word of God was a
[40:06] mighty miracle. So we're going to, we
[40:08] all been through many situations in our
[40:10] life, trials, tribulations, hardships,
[40:14] and we have to realize if God took us
[40:16] through that, he's going to take you
[40:18] through this as well. So, I I just love
[40:20] how that we have testimonies that we can
[40:23] look back and see that God can can take
[40:25] you through.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; And the thing is, don't don't just look
[40:28] back at what he's done, but also look
[40:30] what he can do. Cuz sometimes we just
[40:32] look back, oh, God did all these
[40:34] wonderful things back here, but God
[40:35] still wants to do wonderful things in
[40:37] your present life today. And and like
[40:39] the prophet said that um what happens is
[40:42] we we we look at what God has done and
[40:45] what he will do, but we we fail to
[40:47] realize what God is trying to do.
[40:48] presently in our life right now.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And we want to make sure that we're
[40:52] aware of what God wants to do because
[40:54] God wants to lead you to your future.
[40:55] But first, you have to recognize what
[40:57] he's trying to do right now so you can
[40:59] get to that future.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; And let's keep um let's go to So, it's
[41:03] it's this song that really um that that
[41:06] that gave me this inspiration. You
[41:08] probably heard it's called I trust in
[41:09] God. And I really like the lyrics.
[41:11] They're really they're really peaceful.
[41:12] It says, "Blessed assurance, Jesus is
[41:14] mine." And this is where the inspiration
[41:16] came from. He's been my fourth man in
[41:18] the fire time after time. So, I just
[41:21] love how that writer that he got the
[41:23] inspiration that that God is a fourth
[41:25] man. Not just in that story, but the
[41:28] fourth man all the time in the fire
[41:30] because he says time after time, he he
[41:33] can be your fourth man. He can be your
[41:34] guide. He can be your deliverer. There's
[41:36] so many things that God can be in our
[41:38] life because each one of us are going
[41:39] through different things in our life. I
[41:41] don't know it, but God knows what you're
[41:43] going through. And God has an answer to
[41:45] what you need it for. He has a He can
[41:48] meet that need. No matter how difficult
[41:50] that need may seem, he can meet each and
[41:52] every one our needs right now at this
[41:55] very moment. And it says born of his
[41:57] spirit, washed in his blood. And what he
[42:00] did for me on Calvary is more than
[42:02] enough. I love that. What he did on
[42:04] Calvary is more than enough. what he did
[42:07] on Calvary opened the door that you
[42:09] could have a personal relationship with
[42:10] him that that you could have oneness
[42:13] with him, that you could pour your heart
[42:14] out to him because what we lost in the
[42:16] Garden of Eden has been restored through
[42:19] what was done on Calvary. So what was
[42:21] done on Calvary, you can have that
[42:22] oneness that Adam and Eve have now. It
[42:25] it all it is is just a head bow away,
[42:27] just a speaking to God away. You don't
[42:29] necessarily have to always because it's
[42:31] there's going to be times where you
[42:32] can't hit your knees sometime, but you
[42:34] can pray in your car. Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; You could pray at work. You could pray
[42:38] while listening to a song. It's pray
[42:39] where you're walking, where you're
[42:40] working out. There's so many things that
[42:41] you you can do to access God. Because we
[42:44] we we talked about last service that
[42:46] he's a strong tower. He's a very present
[42:48] help in a time of need.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And it says, "Perfect submission all
[42:52] rest." He says, "I know the author of
[42:54] tomorrow has ordered my steps." So, we
[42:58] may not know what steps we need to take.
[43:01] All we have to do is move forward and
[43:02] just trust that God is leading us
[43:04] because he promised to order the the
[43:06] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[43:07] by the Lord. So, and we have that
[43:09] confidence that we may not know where
[43:10] we're going, but we know that God is the
[43:13] author um of tomorrow.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; So, he says, "So, this is my story. This
[43:17] is my song. I'm praising my risen King
[43:20] and Savior all the day long. I trust in
[43:23] God my savior, the one who will never
[43:25] leave me. He will never fail." So I
[43:27] always like hearing that uh that he will
[43:30] never fail. I can fail you. You can fail
[43:33] me. But one person who can't fail is
[43:35] Jesus Christ. I promise this. He will
[43:37] never let you down. Not one time will he
[43:41] let you down. So you you you can have
[43:44] confidence that he will not fail you. So
[43:46] he says, "I trust in I trust in God my
[43:48] savior. Never fail. He will never fail.
[43:50] He didn't fail you then and he won't
[43:52] fail you now." I like that. He says, "I
[43:54] sought the Lord and he heard and he
[43:56] answered me. I sought the Lord and he
[43:58] heard and he answered me. That's why I
[44:00] trust in him. That's why I trust in
[44:02] him." So, when we're seeking God for
[44:03] something with all our heart, we can
[44:05] have confidence that he will answer. I
[44:08] &gt;&gt; I believe that if we're we're pouring
[44:09] our heart out to God, God will give you
[44:12] an answer.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it may not be the answer
[44:15] you want, but it will be an answer. Cuz
[44:18] because I I even think about this, I've
[44:20] heard this before. Even a no from God is
[44:22] good. God's speaking to you.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; I would love to if if God says no to
[44:26] something, that's fine. He spoke to you.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; So to me, that that's a blessing because
[44:31] we live in a day and age of where people
[44:34] want God uh to people want to manip try
[44:38] to manipulate God into giving them the
[44:40] answer they want. And God doesn't work
[44:42] that way. God does not work that way.
[44:44] And so that's why a lot of times like
[44:46] people love to go to certain uh churches
[44:49] because like the people some people love
[44:51] going to mega churches sometimes and
[44:53] because they know that they don't they
[44:55] they don't have to do anything. They can
[44:56] just sit just hear what they want to
[44:58] hear feel good. And when I look at my
[45:01] Bible that sometimes I believe in
[45:03] feelgood sermons. I believe in you know
[45:05] fiery evangelist but sometimes we need
[45:08] words that are going to cut us
[45:10] &gt;&gt; because if it doesn't if it doesn't uh
[45:11] it doesn't challenge you it doesn't
[45:12] change you. So, we we need to be
[45:14] challenged and the word of God sometimes
[45:16] is going to is going to say things that
[45:19] we need to hear, but God is trying to
[45:22] lead us
[45:23] &gt;&gt; um to a closer walk with him. In order
[45:25] to lead us to a closer walk with him, we
[45:28] have to die to oursel. We we have to die
[45:30] to the flesh. We have to be willing to
[45:31] take that hard word because I I look I
[45:34] look in all throughout the Bible that a
[45:36] Christian walk isn't an easy walk. It
[45:38] it's something that when I wasn't
[45:40] serving God, it was easy. But when I
[45:42] started serving God, it got hard
[45:45] &gt;&gt; because now you're going against your
[45:47] nature, the grain against your nature,
[45:49] and your nature doesn't want to serve
[45:50] God. And um
[45:54] see where we at now. Amen. All right.
[45:56] So, let's go to um go to Daniel 6.
[46:02] Go to Daniel 6. So, we'll look at
[46:03] another uh character in the word of God.
[46:06] Now,
[46:13] So Daniel 6 and we'll read verses 10-2
[46:17] first
[46:20] 10-2.
[46:22] Now when Daniel knew that the writing
[46:24] was signed, he went into his house and
[46:26] his windows being open in his chamber
[46:28] toward Jerusalem. He kneelled upon his
[46:30] knees three times a day and prayed and
[46:32] gave thanks before his God as he did a
[46:34] four times. So I love that. So Daniel
[46:37] did not let his So what the enemy wants
[46:39] to do is let's just break it down. I
[46:41] want to expose the enemy. So what the
[46:43] enemy wants to do is he wants to take
[46:45] your prayer life away.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; If he can take your prayer life away,
[46:49] you lose your closeness with God. And so
[46:51] thing is we have to fight to keep our
[46:54] walk with God. We have to fight on our
[46:56] knees. That's where the battle is
[46:58] fought. And and like we said before, God
[47:00] wants to fight your battles, but in
[47:01] order for him to fight your battles, you
[47:03] have to take the fight on your knees
[47:05] first. So God can properly fight your
[47:07] battles. So what the enemy does is he
[47:09] hates when a believer is on his knees
[47:12] seeking God. He hates it because he is
[47:14] powerless against a believer. When a
[47:16] believer is fully surrendered to God.
[47:18] And so that what the devil likes to do
[47:20] is he likes to not he likes to um get
[47:22] you to be distracted. He gets you busy
[47:25] with good things. Taking care of your
[47:26] family, doing this and doing that. And
[47:29] the devil knows he can't get you doing
[47:31] these crazy things in the world. So
[47:32] he'll get you to be so busy with
[47:34] everything around your house and all
[47:35] these things that you have put minimal
[47:38] time in your walk with God. And when he
[47:40] does that, he has you in his fingertips.
[47:41] So what we need to do is I think um in I
[47:44] can't remember think it says the kingdom
[47:45] of heaven has suffered violent and a
[47:47] violent take it by force. So you have to
[47:49] take your personal walk by force because
[47:51] the devil when you go to God, Paul said
[47:54] when when when I would do good, evil
[47:55] would be right there. So the devil knows
[47:57] when you're trying to walk closer to
[48:00] God, he's going to set obstacles and
[48:02] traps. And we have to be aware of of
[48:04] what the enemy is doing.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And we have to be aware and we're aware
[48:08] by um in our prayer lives. So that's why
[48:11] I said it's so important this day and
[48:12] age that we need to pray daily. I'm not
[48:16] saying you got to spend 5 hours a day
[48:17] like I said before. I'm saying it's
[48:19] quality the quality prayer time, quality
[48:22] reading time cuz this is what's going to
[48:24] give you strength.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is going to give you
[48:27] strength. There's so many scriptures in
[48:28] here that will give you strength that
[48:31] that will give you uh what you need
[48:34] because it's is we need to eat food, but
[48:36] we also need spiritual food in due
[48:38] season. And this is the type of food we
[48:39] need to feed our inside man. If we're
[48:41] not feeding on the right things because
[48:43] there's so many distractions out there,
[48:45] social media, Tik Tok, um Instagram,
[48:48] Pinterest, uh YouTube shorts, Instagram
[48:51] shorts. I I can keep on going with all
[48:52] these distractions we have. All it takes
[48:54] is you pick one video and you have it's
[48:57] an algorithm in there that knows exactly
[48:59] what you like. You pick this video, you
[49:01] watch you watch a cat video, you watch
[49:02] this video, that video, and then it it
[49:04] it stores it and it keeps putting
[49:06] similar videos and before you know it,
[49:08] you're scrolling for an hour and a half
[49:09] and you're wondering where my time went.
[49:11] So that's what the devil does. See, the
[49:13] devil got slick. Um he he he has so many
[49:16] social and I'm not saying social media
[49:18] is bad because social media does have
[49:20] some good things because you can promote
[49:22] good things. you can keep in contact
[49:23] with people. Um, but the thing is I
[49:26] think a lot of times, especially young
[49:27] people nowadays, they use social media
[49:30] uh too much and and and what happens is
[49:34] when you use social media too much and
[49:35] there's all these young people trying to
[49:37] make a name for themselves and then
[49:39] these other young people are trying to
[49:40] uh copy off of them and it's ruining
[49:42] their lives because like I said before,
[49:44] you don't know what that person is doing
[49:46] behind closed doors. They're just
[49:48] showing you what they want you to see,
[49:50] but you don't know what they did to get
[49:51] what they have. And everybody's trying
[49:53] to follow follow after them. And we're
[49:56] not called to follow after Hollywood and
[49:59] glamour. We're called to follow after
[50:00] Christ
[50:01] &gt;&gt; because when you follow when you follow
[50:03] after Hollywood and glamour, you're
[50:04] always going to feel empty. And these
[50:06] people feel empty. And that's why
[50:08] they're trying to get um they're always
[50:10] trying to get more followers, a million
[50:13] more, more money. But yet, if you if you
[50:15] if you would actually see where they're
[50:17] at, you'll see the things that they're
[50:18] doing are compromised. And even this I
[50:21] don't know if this this one minister um
[50:24] one of his bigname ministers, I don't
[50:25] minister his name, but he was caught at
[50:28] this um this party uh this one old this
[50:32] uh I'm trying to explain it. So, oh
[50:34] yeah. So, this is you probably heard P
[50:35] Diddy. You probably know who P Diddy is.
[50:37] um this one of these ministers was
[50:39] caught always going to his parties and
[50:41] it's like why are you going to a PD a PD
[50:44] party where there's alcohol women and
[50:46] it's like and he's a bigname preacher.
[50:48] It's just I I look at there's a lot of
[50:50] compromising in this day and age. Um
[50:54] nobody want people want to serve God but
[50:56] they want to serve God in their own
[50:58] terms is what I'm trying to say. And we
[51:00] can't serve God based upon our own
[51:02] terms. And it's like God is not going to
[51:05] compromise to you to your life, but he's
[51:08] expecting us to form to his word
[51:12] &gt;&gt; be
[51:12] &gt;&gt; because God is holy. God God is perfect.
[51:17] God is merciful. God is long-suffering.
[51:20] And God wants to help you.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; But the thing is, God's a gentleman.
[51:24] Just like brother uh Brother Bill said
[51:26] yesterday, he's knocking at the door of
[51:27] your heart.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; But the thing is, he's not going to kick
[51:30] the door down. He's not going to blow
[51:31] the door up, but he's waiting for you to
[51:33] let him in.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Because God wants to help you. He wants
[51:36] to change your situation. He wants to
[51:37] change your life. He He wants to build
[51:40] you, but you have to let the master
[51:42] builder come in and follow his
[51:44] blueprints because he sometimes we have
[51:47] blueprints for our own life
[51:49] &gt;&gt; and we and we want to just keep those
[51:51] blueprints, but sometimes you got to put
[51:53] those blueprints off to a side and say,
[51:54] "Lord, what is your blueprints for my
[51:56] life? What is your plan for my life?
[51:58] Where do you where do you want me to go?
[52:01] Um what direction what job do you want
[52:03] me to have? What what direction should I
[52:05] take? And the more we can involve Christ
[52:08] in all of our life, the more we will
[52:10] grow in Christ because all God is
[52:12] looking for as a believer fully
[52:15] surrendered in God. And we see in in the
[52:17] word in James uh how it tells us how we
[52:20] resist the devil. First we have to
[52:21] submit to God and then we can resist the
[52:24] devil. That's the formula. It's not um
[52:27] it's not the opt it's not resist the
[52:28] devil then submit to God but it's submit
[52:30] to God and then you can resist the
[52:32] devil. So we see in a believer's life
[52:34] submission to God is so important
[52:37] &gt;&gt; because the more you submit the more he
[52:39] can lift you up. And I'm not saying lift
[52:41] you up like in a fame but lift you up
[52:43] more closer to him because the end of
[52:45] the day it's God's strength that's going
[52:47] to get you through this. It it's it's
[52:50] God's strength that's um you're going to
[52:52] become a victor. And we talked about
[52:54] this last time, how that in order to
[52:56] have a victory, there has to be
[52:57] something you have to overcome. There
[52:59] has to be some sort of obstacle that you
[53:01] have to overcome because otherwise, how
[53:03] do you fight? You can't fight anything
[53:05] if there's nothing there. So, in order
[53:06] for you to become an overcomer, there
[53:08] has to be trials, tribulations,
[53:11] hardships, hard times. And we we found
[53:14] out through the word that that they're
[53:16] more precious than gold. And they're
[53:18] there for a reason to build you, to to
[53:20] help you grow. I guarantee you I can
[53:22] talk to brother John how many trials you
[53:24] had over the years and you could
[53:26] probably tell me hundreds and hundreds
[53:27] and hundreds but it made you a better
[53:30] husband, a better pastor, a better
[53:33] friend, a better boss. But there there
[53:36] there's the reason to help build and
[53:38] grow you.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; I lost where I'm at now. Where am I at?
[53:41] Um let's go to Daniel 6. I said oh verse
[53:43] 11. These men assembled and found Daniel
[53:47] praying and making supplication before
[53:49] his God. So the these people were
[53:51] literally just set out to they were
[53:53] jealous of Daniel. There's going to be
[53:55] people that are going to be jealous of
[53:56] you because of your walk. They're going
[53:58] to be so jealous that you're blessed.
[54:01] They see you prospering spiritually and
[54:03] and physically and they they're going to
[54:05] become jealous. So they're going to set
[54:07] things they're going to try to get you
[54:09] in trouble. It could be at your work.
[54:10] They're jealous or they they they hate
[54:12] that you have a walk with God and they
[54:14] don't. And so they're going to do
[54:15] anything they can to get under your skin
[54:17] to try to get you in trouble. But I love
[54:20] the attitude that Daniel had. He he he
[54:22] never one he never one one time talked
[54:25] bad about them. He did not one time talk
[54:28] bad about them. He let God handle it. He
[54:31] let God fight the battle. And I think
[54:33] sometimes we can't take things personal.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; People do things sometimes and they're
[54:39] going to do things over and over again.
[54:40] And the devil does that for a reason cuz
[54:42] he's trying to get a reaction out of
[54:44] you. It's not the it's not the action,
[54:46] but it's a reaction to the action as as
[54:48] the prophet said. So don't let people
[54:50] get under your skin. They're going to do
[54:52] things. That's what they're going to do.
[54:55] And we have to realize that's human
[54:56] nature sometimes that we have to just
[54:58] trust in God and and not complain about
[55:00] the situation, but be thankful that um
[55:03] we have an opportunity to react in the
[55:05] proper way.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Let's go to um okay 12. Then they came
[55:10] near and spake before his king
[55:11] concerning the king's decree. Hey, hast
[55:14] thou not signed a decree that every man
[55:16] that shall ask a petition of any god or
[55:18] man within 30 days, save of thee, oh
[55:20] king, shall be cast into the den of
[55:21] lions? The king answered and said, "The
[55:23] thing is true according to the law and
[55:25] the Mes and the Persians which auth
[55:29] now now Daniel looks like he's in a hard
[55:31] a hard hard a rock and a hard place
[55:33] because there's this decree that when a
[55:36] king would decree something, he could
[55:37] not go back on it. It was his word. If
[55:40] it was sealed, it was his word and they
[55:42] had to follow it." So, it looks like
[55:45] Daniel is in a rough predicament um
[55:47] because he doesn't he he's he's he knows
[55:50] he's doing something that is against the
[55:51] law. But I look at it this you give
[55:53] Caesar's what Caesars's and God's with
[55:55] God.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So if Caesar is contradicting is trying
[55:58] to contradict God's word, you follow
[56:00] God. I don't I don't care how in trouble
[56:03] you get. God promised to take care of
[56:06] his own. If you're faithful to God,
[56:08] he'll be faithful to you.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Let's go to um verse 14. Then the king
[56:15] um when he heard these words was so
[56:17] displeased with himself and set his
[56:19] heart on Daniel to deliver him. I I love
[56:20] that that this king felt so bad. And if
[56:24] as we read the scriptures, this king was
[56:26] trying to find every way to help Daniel
[56:28] out this situation because he respected
[56:31] Daniel and respected Daniel's God. And
[56:34] God's going to set people um they may
[56:37] not even be believers, but they're
[56:38] people who they they respect you because
[56:40] of the God that you serve. They have
[56:42] respect for the stand of faith that you
[56:44] have taken. And God will will do things,
[56:47] put people in certain places to help
[56:49] help you get another job. It could be a
[56:52] loan. Whatever it may be, God's going to
[56:53] set people in your circle to have to to
[56:57] supply those needs that you need. So, I
[56:59] love how God does those things. And um
[57:02] these men were assembled to the king and
[57:04] said unto the king, "Know, oh king, that
[57:06] the law of needs and purses that no
[57:07] decree or statue which the king is
[57:10] established to be changed." Verse 15.
[57:11] Now go to verse 16. Then the king
[57:13] commanded that they brought Daniel and
[57:14] cast him into the den of lions. Now the
[57:16] king spake and said unto Daniel, I love
[57:18] this right here. Thy God whom thou
[57:21] servest continually, he will deliver
[57:25] thee.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And this man is not technically not a
[57:28] believer, but look, he says, "Thy God
[57:30] whom thou believe." He had faith in
[57:32] Daniel's God that he was going to
[57:34] deliver him. So I I like that right
[57:36] there. And it says, "And a stone was
[57:39] brought and laid upon the mouth of the
[57:40] den, and the king sealed it with his own
[57:42] signate." Now, these people who accused
[57:44] him, they are saying, "We finally got
[57:46] Daniel." Like, we finally got this man.
[57:49] Is no way that he's going to get. We put
[57:51] a stone. We put hungry lions. Is no way
[57:54] he's going to get out of this. And he
[57:57] says that the purpose not might not be
[57:59] changed concerning Daniel. Then the the
[58:01] king went to his palace and passed the
[58:04] night fasting. this he he literally he
[58:07] loved Daniel. He was even fasting. He
[58:09] was probably praying for him. They said
[58:11] we're instrument brought before him and
[58:13] his sleep went for he couldn't even
[58:14] sleep. He was so concerned about his
[58:16] buddy Daniel that he couldn't even
[58:19] sleep. It says then the king arose very
[58:21] early in the morning. He went in haste.
[58:23] He was running and went in hasten to the
[58:26] lions. And when he came to the lions he
[58:28] cried with a lamidable voice unto
[58:29] Daniel. And the king speaking said,
[58:31] "Daniel,
[58:32] servant of the living God, is thy God
[58:35] whom thou serest continually able to
[58:37] deliver thee from the lions?" Then said
[58:38] Daniel unto the king, "Oh king, live
[58:41] forever."
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; My God. I love that. Is he your God? Is
[58:44] he Is he your God? My God. So what you
[58:46] we have to do is we have to you have to
[58:48] say he's my God.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz he has to be personally. He can't be
[58:51] I can't I can't have a relationship
[58:53] through brother John with his God with
[58:55] with God. I have to say my God,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; my Lord,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; my healer, my protector. You have to
[59:01] have a personal experience that he's all
[59:03] those things to. You have to have
[59:04] experience that God is God personally
[59:06] for yourself. That's why he can say my
[59:08] God because because he's experienced who
[59:11] God is personally for himself. My God
[59:14] has sent his angel and has shut the
[59:16] lion's mouth that they have no hurt. For
[59:18] as much as before him innocy was found
[59:20] in me. And also before thee, oh king, I
[59:23] have done no hurt. Then was the king
[59:25] exceedingly glad for him and commanded
[59:27] that they should take Daniel out of the
[59:28] den. So Daniel was taking him out the
[59:30] den, and the manner of hurt was found
[59:32] upon him because he believed in his God.
[59:34] And the king commanded and they brought
[59:36] those men which had accused Daniel, and
[59:38] they cast him into the den of lions,
[59:40] them and their children, their wives,
[59:41] and the lions had the mastery of them,
[59:43] break all their bones in pieces, or
[59:45] every they came at the bottom of the
[59:47] den. So I love how this Daniel let God
[59:50] fight the battle. His accus look what
[59:52] happened to his accusers. God fought the
[59:55] battle. Daniel didn't kick and scream
[59:57] and and and say, "Man, they shouldn't be
[59:59] doing this. They're jealous." He just
[1:00:00] let God handle it. Sometimes we get so
[1:00:02] involved in situation that we we we
[1:00:04] worry ourself. We get stressed out
[1:00:07] because we're not letting God take the
[1:00:09] take the driver's wheel. See, God is not
[1:00:11] going to fight for control, the driver's
[1:00:13] wheel with you. You heard of a backseat
[1:00:16] driver. Don't be a backseat driver. Just
[1:00:18] sit in and let God take you the
[1:00:20] destination he wants you to go. That's
[1:00:21] what Daniel did. Daniel didn't complain
[1:00:23] like, "Lord, why am I in this situation?
[1:00:25] I didn't do nothing wrong. I was just
[1:00:26] seeking your face. I was trying to get
[1:00:28] closer to you." He didn't say, "Man,
[1:00:29] Lord, like what's going on, man? Like,
[1:00:31] why am I why am I in this?" But God did
[1:00:33] it for a purpose.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; And I love this, too. When um when
[1:00:36] Daniel was praying, it's another When
[1:00:38] Daniel was praying 21 days, he didn't
[1:00:42] hear not one answer from God.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't discouraged. He kept
[1:00:45] praying.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; He kept praying. Day one, day two, day
[1:00:50] three, day four. Kept seeking God, kept
[1:00:52] seeking God. Week two, week, week three.
[1:00:55] And I love the testimony. He said,
[1:00:57] "Daniel, I heard you since the first
[1:00:59] prayer that you prayed."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So sometimes your prayer has it might be
[1:01:03] held up for certain reasons. I I'll tell
[1:01:05] you this. I love this. Um this it's an
[1:01:07] old song. He's an ontime God. Job said,
[1:01:11] "He may not come when you want him, but
[1:01:14] he'll be right on time." And I'll tell
[1:01:16] you this that he was a right on time for
[1:01:18] Daniel. It may not been when he wanted
[1:01:20] it, but he's right on time. Maybe you
[1:01:22] have a need tonight or tonight. You have
[1:01:24] a need to this morning. And I'll tell
[1:01:27] you this, that need is going to be met
[1:01:29] right on time.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe you want to see your children
[1:01:33] serving God. It's going to be right on
[1:01:36] time. So the thing is sometimes we want
[1:01:39] things in our time because we live in a
[1:01:42] society where everything is so fast,
[1:01:45] fast food, Amazon, whatever it is. Um
[1:01:48] overnight deliveries, all these things
[1:01:50] that we get accustomed and so used to
[1:01:52] having everything right now. And God
[1:01:55] doesn't work like that all the time.
[1:01:57] Sometimes he does work right now, but we
[1:01:59] can't expect God to do that every single
[1:02:01] time because God wants to make sure
[1:02:04] everything is put in place perfectly.
[1:02:06] When God does does things, it's done
[1:02:09] perfectly.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; So if he if he rushes certain things,
[1:02:12] it's certain it's certain things going
[1:02:13] to be missing. He He's making sure
[1:02:15] everything is lined up in order so when
[1:02:17] it's time to meet that need, everything
[1:02:19] will be taken care of. God looks at the
[1:02:21] big picture. We just look at the small
[1:02:23] picture sometimes. So we got to realize
[1:02:25] that like we said yesterday, he says,
[1:02:27] "My thoughts are not your thoughts. My
[1:02:29] ways are not your ways." So we have to
[1:02:31] realize that God does certain things and
[1:02:34] we have to realize that we don't always
[1:02:35] think like God. Sometimes we think we
[1:02:37] all we think like God, but no, sometimes
[1:02:39] we don't
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; because we sometimes think based upon
[1:02:42] our emotion and emotions can be wrong
[1:02:45] because emotions can change. You could
[1:02:46] be happy one day, sad the next, angry
[1:02:49] one day, mad the or or or happy the next
[1:02:51] day. So, we don't serve God based upon
[1:02:54] emotions. And so, we have to put that
[1:02:56] into a fact that that God is um let's go
[1:03:00] to Romans 8:28.
[1:03:08] Now, I think of this scripture right
[1:03:09] here, and we'll read a couple verses in
[1:03:11] here. I had it on my notes, I believe. I
[1:03:12] can't remember, but we'll read a couple
[1:03:14] verses just this time. I want I want us
[1:03:16] to remind us. And we know that all
[1:03:19] things I know we read this last service
[1:03:20] and we know that all things work
[1:03:22] together for a good to them that love
[1:03:24] God to them that are calleding according
[1:03:26] to his purpose. D that's fits right
[1:03:28] there with Daniel's situation because we
[1:03:31] he he could say we know all things work
[1:03:34] together for the good of them that love
[1:03:36] God and are called according to his
[1:03:38] purpose. I believe I'm speaking to uh
[1:03:40] people who are called according to his
[1:03:42] purpose. Every one of you guys are
[1:03:43] called according to his purpose. And we
[1:03:45] can go read in verse 29. for whom he did
[1:03:48] forno he did predestinate to be
[1:03:49] conformed to the image not for him to be
[1:03:53] conformed to us but for us to be
[1:03:54] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:03:58] um lost my that that he
[1:04:02] okay that um he might be the firstborn
[1:04:05] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:04:07] predestinate them he also called and
[1:04:09] whom he called them he also justified
[1:04:11] whom he justified he also glorified what
[1:04:14] shall we say then to these things. If
[1:04:17] God be for us, who could be against? I'm
[1:04:20] read that again. If God can be for us,
[1:04:24] who can be against us?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; So, I don't care what the enemy throws
[1:04:28] at at you. If God is for you, then
[1:04:31] nobody can be against you. I don't care
[1:04:33] what the doctor says. I don't care what
[1:04:35] the boss says. Like, he can say, "You
[1:04:37] ain't never getting that promotion. If
[1:04:39] that promotion is for me and God has
[1:04:42] gave it to me, I don't care how many
[1:04:44] people try to close the door. God will
[1:04:46] open that door or God will take that
[1:04:48] person out and you and put somebody in
[1:04:50] so you get that promotion. So don't
[1:04:53] don't think a situation is impossible
[1:04:55] for God to handle. God can handle the
[1:04:57] small situations, the big situations.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And like like I said before, let God
[1:05:02] kill Saul. David David didn't have to
[1:05:04] kill Saul. We see what happened to Saul.
[1:05:07] God took Saul out so David could be the
[1:05:09] king. So we see that saying. So, let God
[1:05:11] do the thing. Cuz David was going to try
[1:05:14] to David had every opportunity. He could
[1:05:15] have killed Saul right there, but he
[1:05:17] said, "Let me not touch God's
[1:05:18] anointing."
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let me let me let God do his
[1:05:21] thing. Let God do his thing." God knows
[1:05:24] what he's doing. He He He He's been
[1:05:26] around the block a couple of times, so
[1:05:27] he knows what he's doing. So, let him do
[1:05:29] his thing. The The more we the the more
[1:05:32] we can rest,
[1:05:34] the more we can let God move, cuz God
[1:05:36] wants us to rest. I'm not saying be
[1:05:38] lazy, but I'm saying trust. Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Play your part. Uh um trust in him,
[1:05:43] serve him, read the word, speak the word
[1:05:45] out. I think it's so it's so important
[1:05:48] to speak the word out into existence.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Lay lay upon the promises of God. Say,
[1:05:53] "Lord, I'm believing this because I know
[1:05:55] it's your word. I'm believing this
[1:05:57] because I know this is life. I'm
[1:05:58] believing this because it's been made
[1:05:59] real to me. I don't know when it's going
[1:06:01] to happen, but I know it will happen."
[1:06:04] Um so, let's see. Um
[1:06:07] let's go verse 32.
[1:06:09] Um, and he said, "He that speareth not
[1:06:11] his own son, but delivered him up for
[1:06:13] his his um for us all, how shall he not
[1:06:16] with him also freely give us all
[1:06:19] things?" I love that. He that speareth
[1:06:21] not his own son, but delivered him up
[1:06:23] for us all, how shall he not with him
[1:06:26] also freely give us all things?
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; So God knows each one of your needs. He
[1:06:32] knows your needs. He knows your needs
[1:06:34] back there, sister. He knows your needs,
[1:06:35] sister Lori. Your needs, everybody's
[1:06:37] needs. So he's going to supply them. So
[1:06:39] not not your wants necessarily, but your
[1:06:42] needs.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Your needs. I'm not saying God won't
[1:06:45] bless you. God God loves blessing his
[1:06:48] children.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; God financially, spiritually, God loves
[1:06:53] these things.
[1:06:55] Let's go to Joel chapter 2.
[1:07:06] I think to um let's go to
[1:07:13] tell you exactly where to go. Give me
[1:07:14] one second.
[1:07:16] Let's go to Joel chapter one.
[1:07:25] One second.
[1:07:29] Let's go to Joel chapter 2 verse 25.
[1:07:33] Sorry about that.
[1:07:36] You want to put that in a board for me?
[1:07:37] Joel chapter 2 verse 25.
[1:07:41] I love this right here. And he says,
[1:07:44] "And I will restore to you the years
[1:07:48] that the locust have eaten up the
[1:07:50] cankerorm, the caterpillar, the palmer
[1:07:53] worm, my great army which I sent among
[1:07:56] you." Maybe you just feel like your life
[1:07:59] has been shambles. this this this just
[1:08:02] situation after situation, problem after
[1:08:04] problem. You just feel like you're just
[1:08:05] a stump. You just feel like I ain't got
[1:08:07] no life left. But I'll tell you this,
[1:08:09] the Lord said, "I will restore to you
[1:08:12] the years that the locust hath eaten up,
[1:08:15] the cankerworm, the caterpillar, the
[1:08:17] palmer worm, my great army which I sing
[1:08:19] among you." Verse 26.
[1:08:22] And you shall eat in plenty. You can go
[1:08:25] spiritual right there. eat in plenty and
[1:08:28] be satisfied because the world doesn't
[1:08:30] satisfy you. The world leaves you hungry
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; because I can get a good meal and I'm
[1:08:35] hungry
[1:08:36] two hours later, maybe an hour later.
[1:08:39] I can get Chinese food hungry 30 minutes
[1:08:42] later. So, we see that we can't depend
[1:08:45] upon natural food to satisfy us
[1:08:47] spiritually because it can't. But he
[1:08:50] said, ' Ye shall eat in plenty and be
[1:08:52] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:08:54] Lord your God that hath dealt with
[1:08:56] wondrously with you and my people shall
[1:08:58] never be ashamed. Verse 27
[1:09:02] and it says, "And you shall know that I
[1:09:04] am in the midst of Israel." He's in the
[1:09:06] midst of us right now, the midst of your
[1:09:08] life right now. That and that I am the
[1:09:10] Lord your God and none else and my
[1:09:13] people shall never be ashamed. Verse 28,
[1:09:16] please. These in my notes. And it shall
[1:09:19] come to pass afterward that I will pour
[1:09:21] out my spirit upon all flesh, and your
[1:09:23] sons and daughters shall prophesy. Your
[1:09:25] old men shall dream dreams, your young
[1:09:27] men shall see visions. Verse 29.
[1:09:30] And also upon the servants, upon the
[1:09:31] handmmaids, in those days will I pour
[1:09:32] out my spirit. Verse 30. And I will show
[1:09:35] wonders in the heavens and the earth and
[1:09:37] the blood and fire pills of smoke. Is
[1:09:38] there another verse?
[1:09:41] And the sun shall be turned in darkness
[1:09:42] and the moon the blood before the great
[1:09:44] and terrible day of the Lord. So, we
[1:09:45] know that um this is this is um this
[1:09:48] scripture is what Peter actually
[1:09:50] repeated back in the book of Acts. So,
[1:09:53] just I I wanted to bring the restoration
[1:09:55] out because we're in this we're in the
[1:09:58] season of restoration because God is
[1:10:00] trying to restore us from the inside
[1:10:02] out. There's certain things there's
[1:10:04] certain things that God needs to build
[1:10:06] inside of us so we can be back to how we
[1:10:08] used to be before the the for the fall.
[1:10:11] So, God is trying to restore you
[1:10:12] spiritually. He's trying to res restore
[1:10:15] families together. I believe God is in a
[1:10:17] restoration business. And he's not
[1:10:19] trying to make something. He's not he's
[1:10:21] trying when you restore something,
[1:10:22] you're making something how it used to
[1:10:24] be. When somebody tries to restore a
[1:10:26] vintage car, they're not trying to make
[1:10:28] a new car, but they're trying to restore
[1:10:30] back to what it used to be. So God is
[1:10:32] trying to restore you back to what you
[1:10:33] used to be.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; In his image.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And and so sometimes restoration hurts.
[1:10:39] It hurts sometimes,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; but is needed. Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Like when you when you go work out at
[1:10:44] the gym, you literally are destroying
[1:10:46] your muscles. You're hurting your
[1:10:47] muscles. So what? So it can rebuild. So
[1:10:51] when we get hurt is to build us.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And it's very important because the
[1:10:55] prophet brought out a restoration
[1:10:57] message trying to get us back in step.
[1:11:00] We got to get back in step with the word
[1:11:02] of God cuz sometimes we get out of step
[1:11:04] and we got to line back up in our walk
[1:11:07] with God.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Where am I at now? All flustered. Let's
[1:11:11] see. Where am I at? Okay, let's go to um
[1:11:14] All right, let's go to Isaiah 43, verse
[1:11:17] 16. How am I doing on time?
[1:11:22] So, it says, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:11:25] which maketh a way in the sea, and a
[1:11:27] path in the mighty waters." So, I'm
[1:11:29] going to say that to us personally today
[1:11:31] that the Lord is making a way right now
[1:11:34] in the sea for you. He's making a path
[1:11:36] right now. He's building He's building a
[1:11:38] bridge so you can walk where he wants
[1:11:41] you to go. And so maybe it feels like
[1:11:43] you're you're you're in a like we said
[1:11:45] last time in a um a Red Sea showdown and
[1:11:48] you just feel like Lord, I don't know
[1:11:50] where to go. My back's against the wall.
[1:11:52] I got I got this person over here
[1:11:54] yelling at me. I got this this situation
[1:11:56] going on. I just feel like I'm drowning.
[1:11:59] Um the bills are the bills are piling
[1:12:01] up. I don't know what to do. But I'll
[1:12:03] tell you this, God is going to make, it
[1:12:06] says right here, he will make a way in
[1:12:08] the sea, a path in the mighty waters.
[1:12:09] So, he'll make a way for you. He'll
[1:12:11] supply that need, that spiritual need.
[1:12:13] But all you have to do is say, "Lord, I
[1:12:15] don't know how you're going to get me
[1:12:16] out of this, but I know you will get me
[1:12:18] out of this. I'm trusting in you. If you
[1:12:20] start a good work in me, you will finish
[1:12:22] it." So, you got to you got to speak
[1:12:24] faith into the situation. Show God that
[1:12:26] you believe that he can take you out of
[1:12:28] any situation. See, God is going to
[1:12:30] bless you more for that than us trying
[1:12:32] to complain our way out. Cuz you can't
[1:12:33] complain your way out. When you
[1:12:35] complain, you dig yourself deeper. So
[1:12:36] instead of instead of complaining,
[1:12:38] praise him.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Worship him. Say, "Lord, even though I I
[1:12:42] don't know even have the strength to
[1:12:43] worship you, I'm going to worship you
[1:12:45] anyway because me worshiping you is
[1:12:47] going to do way more good than me
[1:12:49] complaining."
[1:12:50] And God is going to say like Paul I
[1:12:52] meant to put that scripture but you look
[1:12:54] at Paul and Silas um they they they
[1:12:58] technically you could outside looking in
[1:12:59] like why are they in prison? They
[1:13:00] deserve to be in prison. All they do is
[1:13:02] living for God. But when they were in
[1:13:04] that prison beaten bloody they still had
[1:13:07] strength to sing praises to God and lift
[1:13:10] his name up. And you know what God did?
[1:13:13] He he he he literally loosened those
[1:13:15] chains and opened and and opened their
[1:13:17] bond open their um word I'm looking for.
[1:13:20] He he he they were in bondage and he he
[1:13:22] he he exactly he he set their shackles
[1:13:25] free. So if they could have enough
[1:13:28] praise and worship inside of them to
[1:13:30] worship and you can say a a bad
[1:13:32] situation. It was dark. It was probably
[1:13:34] smelly. It was probably humid. They were
[1:13:37] bloody. They probably can barely see.
[1:13:39] But they still found enough praise to
[1:13:42] muster up and worship God. So, who are
[1:13:45] we not to worship God when we're going
[1:13:47] through certain things because praise
[1:13:49] and worship will be your strength?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Praise and worship will get you through
[1:13:53] the toughest situation. That's what Job
[1:13:56] had to do. He he had to praise and
[1:13:57] worship God. He said, "Blessed be the
[1:13:59] name of the Lord who giveth and taketh
[1:14:00] away." He still found praise in his
[1:14:03] heart to give God. Even though he he
[1:14:05] could have made an excuse. I don't have
[1:14:06] my kids anymore. I don't have this. My
[1:14:09] wife said, "You better curse God and
[1:14:11] die." But yet, he still found enough
[1:14:13] inside of him to serve God, to give God
[1:14:16] the glory. And I believe that touches
[1:14:18] the heart of God when we're able to
[1:14:20] muster up praise and worship when when
[1:14:23] the situation seems like it you can't
[1:14:25] muster it up. So, that's where the real
[1:14:28] victory is had. That's what I'm talking
[1:14:29] about when victories are won. Because
[1:14:31] it's easy to have a victory when when
[1:14:34] everything's, you know, beautiful and
[1:14:36] set in line. But a real victory to me,
[1:14:39] you you cherish it more when you have to
[1:14:41] fight your way through it where
[1:14:43] everything is up against you and you
[1:14:45] have to really lean upon God in a
[1:14:47] situation that you really have to trust
[1:14:49] God because you've tried everything that
[1:14:52] you could try. You tried this, you tried
[1:14:54] this, you got advice from here, you took
[1:14:56] a loan from here, you did this over
[1:14:58] here, um what whatever you read um the
[1:15:02] daily scriptures every day and this and
[1:15:04] that and that and that and you're
[1:15:06] saying, "Lord, I don't know what to do,
[1:15:08] but Lord, I'm I'm going to keep I'm
[1:15:10] going to keep on my knees no matter how
[1:15:12] bad this situation's get. Lord, I'm
[1:15:14] going to stay on my knees every morning.
[1:15:17] I'm I'm I'm going just cry out to you
[1:15:18] and say, "Lord, I I don't know what's
[1:15:20] going on, but I'm trusting you through
[1:15:21] this trial. I'm going to make it
[1:15:23] through. You are my firm foundation and
[1:15:26] my my my my house is built upon a rock."
[1:15:29] Let's go to Matthew 7.
[1:15:33] Because if you build your house upon a
[1:15:35] rock, I don't care what strong wind
[1:15:37] comes. I don't care what storm comes. I
[1:15:39] don't care what tidal wave comes. That
[1:15:42] house is going to stay strong because
[1:15:44] you built your foundation upon a rock.
[1:15:46] the rock of ages. And anytime a person
[1:15:49] is built upon the rock of ages, there's
[1:15:51] no devil in hell that can destroy the
[1:15:54] house because God has built that house.
[1:15:56] If God has built the house, then there
[1:15:58] is no devil in hell that can destroy it.
[1:16:01] So, you can have confidence that God
[1:16:03] will bring you through, that God will
[1:16:06] take you the extra mile. If you can't
[1:16:07] walk, God will carry you and help you
[1:16:09] walk. He's there to hold your hand.
[1:16:12] Let's go to Matthew 7.
[1:16:15] 7. And we'll go to 24 um through verse
[1:16:17] 29. Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[1:16:19] sayings, he said, "Whosoever." So,
[1:16:21] whosoever hear these sayings of mine and
[1:16:23] doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise
[1:16:25] man which built his house upon a rock.
[1:16:27] Verse 25, my brother, it says, "And the
[1:16:29] rain descended, and the floods came, and
[1:16:32] the winds blew, and beat upon that
[1:16:34] house, and it fell not." I'm going do
[1:16:35] that again. And the rains descended and
[1:16:38] the floods came and the winds blew and
[1:16:40] and and beat that house, and it fell
[1:16:43] not. for it was founded upon a rock.
[1:16:46] Verse 26, it says, "And everyone that
[1:16:49] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[1:16:51] them not shall be likened unto a foolish
[1:16:53] man, which bit his house upon the sand."
[1:16:55] I don't care how nice that house looks.
[1:16:57] It It could be steel reinforced. It It
[1:17:00] could have a a bomb shelter. It could
[1:17:03] have whatever it has in there. Whatever
[1:17:05] you want to say. It could be built up
[1:17:07] really high, really strong. if it's
[1:17:09] built upon sand, it says shall be
[1:17:12] likened to a foolish man. Um, which
[1:17:14] built his house upon the sand. Verse 27,
[1:17:16] and the rains descended and the floods
[1:17:18] came and the winds blew and beat that
[1:17:21] upon that house and it fell and great
[1:17:24] was the fall of it. So, it's not about
[1:17:26] how pretty the outside is, it's about
[1:17:28] what's on the inside.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Because if this if if that house was not
[1:17:32] if there's no foundation, then I don't
[1:17:33] care how much money you put into it. I
[1:17:35] don't care how much insurance you put
[1:17:37] into it is going to fall.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; I want to read this is a song. Um, okay,
[1:17:44] here we go. I'm getting ahead of myself.
[1:17:46] It says,
[1:17:48] so it's called Firm Foundation. It says,
[1:17:50] "Rain came and wind blew, but my house
[1:17:53] was built upon you. This is the reason
[1:17:55] you made it, cuz I'm safe with you. I'm
[1:17:58] going to make it through. Rain came and
[1:18:00] wind blew. My house was built on you.
[1:18:02] This is the reason I'm standing. I'm
[1:18:04] safe with you. He says, I'm going to
[1:18:06] make it through. Yes, I'm going to make
[1:18:08] it through cuz I'm standing strong on
[1:18:10] you. Says my house was built on you.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; So, the reason why we're going to make
[1:18:15] it is because our house is built on him.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason why you're going
[1:18:19] to make it.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Nothing else. No motivational video is
[1:18:23] going to help you make it through. No
[1:18:24] self-help books going to help you make
[1:18:25] it through.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; But, but God himself will help you make
[1:18:28] it through.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And that's so important right there in a
[1:18:32] believer's walk. realizing that it's not
[1:18:34] your strength. It's not it's not what
[1:18:37] you can do, but it's realizing that it's
[1:18:39] all what God has done. It's in a
[1:18:42] finished product you have faith in. And
[1:18:43] that's why we can have faith to keep
[1:18:45] moving on and on and on because what has
[1:18:47] God has done? He died so you can have
[1:18:49] faith. He died so you can have victory.
[1:18:52] He died so you can have that oneness
[1:18:54] like we just said before. Let's let's
[1:18:57] let's look at another character. Um,
[1:19:00] we'll look at uh David in 1st Samuel
[1:19:07] 17:25.
[1:19:16] 1st Samuel 17 25.
[1:19:22] Okay, so this is a very familiar
[1:19:24] scripture. We all know the story of
[1:19:26] David and Goliath.
[1:19:28] probably all quote it. So we'll go with
[1:19:30] um let me see go to verse 25 first kind
[1:19:34] of skip our way through. And the men of
[1:19:35] Israel said, "Have you seen this man
[1:19:36] that has come up? Surely to defy Israel
[1:19:39] he's come up and shall be that the man
[1:19:41] who kleth the king will enrich with the
[1:19:43] great riches will give him his daughter
[1:19:45] and make his father's house free in
[1:19:47] Israel." I just want to mention
[1:19:48] something. A lot of times we we look at
[1:19:52] a situation on the outside and we we
[1:19:54] kind of forget the God that we serve.
[1:19:56] And and I think that the children of
[1:19:58] Israel forgot how they got into the
[1:20:01] land, what God had done. Yet they're
[1:20:03] looking at this obstacle. They're
[1:20:05] they're worshiping this situation more
[1:20:07] than worshiping the God of Israel. And
[1:20:09] they're looking at the outwork. Oh man,
[1:20:11] this man is gigantic. How we're going to
[1:20:12] how we're going to beat him. He's been a
[1:20:14] warrior since his youth. All these
[1:20:16] things, they're looking at the outward
[1:20:17] appearance. And God doesn't care about
[1:20:19] the outward appearance. God, all the uh
[1:20:22] the Egyptians that were chasing him, God
[1:20:24] didn't care. They could have sent a
[1:20:25] million of them. It didn't phase God.
[1:20:27] They could have sent two. They could
[1:20:28] have sent three nations. It doesn't
[1:20:30] bother God.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; But yet, sometimes as human beings, we
[1:20:34] tend to look at the the circumstances.
[1:20:38] And faith doesn't look at the
[1:20:39] circumstances.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Faith just looks at what God said.
[1:20:42] That's all faith looks at. So sometimes
[1:20:44] we have to remind oursel of the faith
[1:20:47] that we have. the God that we serve that
[1:20:49] I don't care what's going on that faith
[1:20:51] is going to get you through because God
[1:20:53] promised it.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse um where am I at? 26.
[1:20:57] And David spake to the men that stood by
[1:21:00] him, saying, "What shall be done to the
[1:21:02] man that killed the Philistine and
[1:21:03] taketh away the reproach of Israel? For
[1:21:05] who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:21:07] that he should defy the armies of the
[1:21:09] living God?" And the people answered him
[1:21:11] after this manner, saying, "So it shall
[1:21:13] be done to the man that kleth him." And
[1:21:15] Elab the eldest brother heard when spake
[1:21:17] unto the men. And Elab anger was
[1:21:19] kindled. I don't know why he was. He was
[1:21:21] jealous. He was So you got to realize
[1:21:24] they were jealous because they weren't
[1:21:26] chosen to be king.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; You know they were very jealous. So that
[1:21:29] that's that anger was kindled because of
[1:21:31] the jealousy because when when Samuel
[1:21:33] came and anointed they tried to put the
[1:21:36] oil in him wasn't him. Wasn't him.
[1:21:37] Wasn't him. And then they didn't even
[1:21:39] think about David. They counted David
[1:21:40] out. They're like this man is this
[1:21:41] scrawny little man over here just sheep
[1:21:43] hurting. is like his dad even think
[1:21:45] about it. He ain't definitely ain't
[1:21:47] king. He He ain't built to be king. But
[1:21:48] God doesn't look at the outward
[1:21:49] appearance. He looks in the inward
[1:21:51] appearance.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; So I love I love that God cuz I
[1:21:55] guarantee you Saul was probably more
[1:21:56] head and shoulders. Uh the B I think
[1:21:58] even brother Brand than anybody in
[1:22:00] Israel. He was a big man probably, you
[1:22:02] know, a little buff. But we we see what
[1:22:04] what God's heart was. The people wanted
[1:22:07] that. So God gave that to him. But what
[1:22:09] God wanted is a man after his own heart.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what God still wants
[1:22:13] today is a man or woman after his own
[1:22:15] heart. That's what he's looking for
[1:22:16] right now. Um, let's keep going. Um,
[1:22:19] let's go to verse 31. And when David,
[1:22:22] the words were heard which David spake,
[1:22:24] they rehearsed them before Saul, and he
[1:22:25] sent for him. And David said to Saul,
[1:22:27] "Let no man's heart fail because of thy
[1:22:29] servant will go fight with the
[1:22:31] Philistine." And Saul said to David,
[1:22:33] "Thou are not able to go against this
[1:22:35] Philistine to fight with him, for thou
[1:22:37] are but a youth and a man from his
[1:22:39] youth." And David said unto Saul, he
[1:22:42] said, David's like, "Listen here. I'm
[1:22:45] going to tell you a testimony. It's not
[1:22:47] about what I what I am or what I do, but
[1:22:49] it's about what God can do." And he
[1:22:51] said, "Let me let me share this
[1:22:53] testimony with you." He said, "Thy
[1:22:54] servant
[1:22:56] um it says, oh, sorry. And I went out."
[1:22:58] So, no, it's um okay. And D verse 34.
[1:23:00] And David said unto Saul, "Thy servant
[1:23:02] kept his father's sheep. And there came
[1:23:03] a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of
[1:23:05] the flock. And I went out from him and
[1:23:08] smote him and delivered it out of his
[1:23:09] mouth. And when he rose against me, I
[1:23:11] caught him by his beard and smote him
[1:23:13] and slew him. Thy servant slew both the
[1:23:15] lion and the bear. And this
[1:23:17] uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one
[1:23:19] of them, seeing he have defiled the
[1:23:22] armies of the living God." So once
[1:23:24] again, David wasn't looking in what his
[1:23:27] strength was or what he did, but he's
[1:23:29] looking at what God had done. And so
[1:23:32] that's why that's why that's why David
[1:23:33] could share that testimony. He's like,
[1:23:35] "Listen, bro. Listen listen, brother.
[1:23:38] I know I can't do it by myself, but I
[1:23:40] know that God that's inside of me can
[1:23:43] give me the strength to to to kill this
[1:23:46] uncircumcised Philistine."
[1:23:48] cuz he could have said cuz y'all y'all
[1:23:50] cow y'all cowering and fearing like
[1:23:52] y'all don't serve the God of Israel
[1:23:55] because y'all literally serving the God
[1:23:56] of Israel who who uh gave you guys
[1:23:59] strength who gave you guys victory over
[1:24:02] all the inhabitants of the land and you
[1:24:03] think he can't do the same thing with
[1:24:05] this one uncircumcised Philistine. This
[1:24:08] is this quote that says um you probably
[1:24:10] the bigger you are the harder you fall.
[1:24:12] So he's got the glass is going to fall
[1:24:14] harder because he's bigger. And David
[1:24:16] said, "Moreover, the Lord deliver me out
[1:24:17] this uh the the paw of the lion. He
[1:24:20] would deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:24:21] Philistine." And Saul said to David, "Go
[1:24:23] and the Lord be with you." He's like,
[1:24:24] "Okay, okay. I believe your testimony.
[1:24:26] Let's go. Let's go." And his armor and
[1:24:28] he put on his helmet upon his head and
[1:24:29] he armed him with the coat of Maul. And
[1:24:31] David was ged with his sword. He's
[1:24:33] probably like falling over all that
[1:24:34] weight upon him and his armor. And he
[1:24:36] say to go for he had not proved it.
[1:24:38] David is like, "I don't need this. I I I
[1:24:40] don't need this armor. I have all I
[1:24:42] need. I have these five stones. Jesus
[1:24:45] faith if you want to put say Jesus you
[1:24:47] can put faith if you want it these five
[1:24:48] stones that's all I need to to conquer
[1:24:50] this giant and verse 40 he took his
[1:24:53] staff in his hand and chose him five
[1:24:54] smooth stones out of the brook and put
[1:24:56] them in a shepherd's bag which he had
[1:24:58] and even in a script and his sling was
[1:25:00] in his hand and he drew near to the
[1:25:01] Philistine and the Philistine came on
[1:25:03] and drew near unto David and the the man
[1:25:06] that bear the shield went before him and
[1:25:08] the Philistine looked about the s the
[1:25:10] saw of David and and he uh disdained him
[1:25:12] for he was but a youth ruddy in fair
[1:25:14] countenance. And the Philistines said
[1:25:15] unto David, "Am I a dog that thou comest
[1:25:18] to me with staves?" And the Philistines
[1:25:19] cursed David about his God. So the devil
[1:25:21] is going to challenge your faith. And
[1:25:23] you got to make sure that you're
[1:25:25] standing on genuine faith because the
[1:25:27] devil knows if you're bluffing. So you
[1:25:29] got to really mean it. You got to really
[1:25:31] have faith because the devil's going to
[1:25:33] come and and try to say, "You don't
[1:25:35] really believe that. You don't believe
[1:25:36] you're going to be healed. You don't
[1:25:37] believe you're going to be out the
[1:25:38] situation. You don't really believe
[1:25:39] that." He going to say, "Devil, shut
[1:25:41] up."
[1:25:43] and say boo back to the devil. Tell the
[1:25:45] devil, "Shut up. I don't care what you
[1:25:46] say." This is what my God says right
[1:25:48] here to me.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; He calls me an overcomer. He calls me a
[1:25:51] victor. He calls me his own. He says,
[1:25:53] "I'm chosen by he he's called me." He
[1:25:55] said, "I didn't choose him, but he chose
[1:25:56] me." So, if he's chosen me, then he's
[1:25:59] going to finish that good work in me.
[1:26:00] So, I don't care what you say. You're a
[1:26:01] defeated creature. Get thee behind me,
[1:26:03] Satan. You got to put Satan in his
[1:26:05] place. You got to you got to when when
[1:26:08] when Jesus got the the uh when he got
[1:26:10] the keys, he he ripped it from Satan and
[1:26:13] took all his power away. So all we have
[1:26:15] to do is say just remind the devil where
[1:26:17] he's going. I know where you're where
[1:26:18] you're going. You're going to lake of
[1:26:19] fire. I'm not going with you.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You go by yourself. I'm not going with
[1:26:23] you. I'm saved.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Um what verse we on?
[1:26:27] Verse 43. Okay. And the Philistine said
[1:26:30] to David, "Am I a dog that thou comest
[1:26:31] to me with staves?" And the Philistine
[1:26:32] cursed David about his gods. And the
[1:26:34] Philistines said to David, "Come to me,
[1:26:36] and I will give thee thy flesh, and to
[1:26:38] the fowls of the air, and to the beast
[1:26:39] of the field." Then said David to the
[1:26:41] Philistines, "Thou comest with a sword,
[1:26:43] and with a spear, and with a shield, but
[1:26:44] I am come to thee in the name of the
[1:26:48] Lord of hosts." So David said, "I'm not
[1:26:51] coming, it's not me coming, but I'm
[1:26:53] coming in the name of the Lord of Hosts,
[1:26:55] the God of the armies of Israel, whom
[1:26:56] thou hast defiled. This day will the
[1:26:59] Lord deliver thee into my hand, and I
[1:27:02] will smite thee, and take take thy head
[1:27:04] from thee, and I will give the carcasses
[1:27:06] of the host of Philine this day to the
[1:27:08] fowls of the air, and to the wild, the
[1:27:10] beasts of the earth, and that all the
[1:27:12] army may know that there is a God in
[1:27:14] Israel. I'm going to say this one thing.
[1:27:17] I don't know if you remember in this in
[1:27:18] the same I think the chapter before that
[1:27:21] Goliath was like, "Let's make this
[1:27:23] wager. If you if you win, we'll serve
[1:27:26] you. And if I win um or if I win, you'll
[1:27:30] serve me. So, I want to tell you this.
[1:27:31] The devil will no never hold his his
[1:27:33] bargain into the bargain.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; He never will. So, don't try and make
[1:27:36] any deals with the devil.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He he he he he's
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; uh he's slimy. He He's He's very um
[1:27:43] manipulative. He's very sneaky. He's not
[1:27:45] going to hold it because we see this.
[1:27:47] They defeated Goliath and the
[1:27:48] Philistines were still fighting against
[1:27:49] Israel.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; They didn't hold it.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you if they won, they
[1:27:52] were like, "Oh yeah, you hold this in
[1:27:54] the bargain. We made it." So don't don't
[1:27:56] listen to the devil. Don't trust him.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; He's a liar. He's a liar from the
[1:28:00] beginning. He's still a liar today.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Um what verse are we on?
[1:28:06] I think it's um okay. This day will the
[1:28:08] Lord deliver. Let's go to verse 47. And
[1:28:10] it says, "And all this assembly shall
[1:28:12] know that the Lord saveth not with sword
[1:28:13] or a spear." Check this out. For the
[1:28:16] battle is the Lord's. I'm going to say
[1:28:18] it again. For the battle is the Lord's.
[1:28:23] And let's go. Let's go. One more. So,
[1:28:25] let's go one more. We read this verse
[1:28:27] last time. I'm I'mma pull it up. And it
[1:28:29] says, I'll read it. And it says, this is
[1:28:31] Exodus 14:14. The Lord shall fight for
[1:28:34] you, and you shall hold your peace. And
[1:28:36] it says, for the battle is the Lord's,
[1:28:37] and he will give it into our hands.
[1:28:40] Verse 48.
[1:28:42] We'll close here in a couple minutes.
[1:28:43] Don't worry, I won't hold you too long.
[1:28:45] We go to verse 48 for me.
[1:28:48] And it says, "And it came to pass when
[1:28:49] the Philistines arose and came and drew
[1:28:51] nigh to meet David that David and hasted
[1:28:54] and ran toward the army to meet the
[1:28:56] Philistines." Verse 49, please. Then it
[1:28:58] says,
[1:29:00] "And David put his hand in his bag and
[1:29:02] took then a stone and slang it and
[1:29:03] smoked the Philistine in his forehead,
[1:29:05] and the stone sunk into his forehead,
[1:29:06] and he fell upon his face to the earth."
[1:29:09] Verse 50.
[1:29:10] And so David prevailed over the
[1:29:12] Philistine with a sling and with a
[1:29:14] stone, and smoked the Philistine, and
[1:29:16] slew him. But there was no sword in the
[1:29:18] hand of David. 51. And therefore David
[1:29:22] ran and stood upon the Philistine and
[1:29:24] took his sword and drew it out of the
[1:29:25] sheath thereof and slew him and cut off
[1:29:27] his hand therewith. And when the
[1:29:29] Philistines saw the champions dead, they
[1:29:30] fled. So I'm going I'm going to tell you
[1:29:33] this that they knew the Philistines knew
[1:29:36] and everybody in Israel knew that there
[1:29:37] was a God in Israel. So when we trust
[1:29:40] upon God, people are going to know that
[1:29:42] there's a God in your life. There's a
[1:29:43] God in Israel. There's a God there's a
[1:29:45] God in send mission. There's a God
[1:29:46] entrusted to there's a God wherever you
[1:29:49] work at, there's a God. And so, we can
[1:29:51] have confidence that if David had a
[1:29:53] testimony like this, you can have a
[1:29:54] testimony just like that.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be giants that
[1:29:57] are going to come into your life. And
[1:29:59] you don't want to be be fearful. Be like
[1:30:01] David. God did these two things. He did
[1:30:04] these things and he do the same thing in
[1:30:06] this situation. So, have faith that if
[1:30:08] God can do that for you, is Jesus Christ
[1:30:10] the same yesterday, today, and forever?
[1:30:13] And just just in closing, we we just
[1:30:16] have to just remind oursel of the God
[1:30:19] that we serve.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; The same God that was with brother
[1:30:22] Brandham is the same God that's with
[1:30:23] you. The same God that was with Moses is
[1:30:25] the same God with you.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; The same God with with Joshua is the
[1:30:28] same God that with you. With Paul with
[1:30:30] you. So he does not change as he says in
[1:30:32] Malachi 3. So we can have confidence
[1:30:34] that a lot of things are going to
[1:30:36] change. I mean, how many times you see
[1:30:38] like candy bars, new and improved
[1:30:40] recipe, like just keep it the same. Why
[1:30:42] you got to change it? It tastes good
[1:30:43] just like the way it is. And how many
[1:30:45] times you see new and improved this, new
[1:30:47] and improved this, new and improved
[1:30:48] this. God doesn't have to be new and
[1:30:49] improved.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; He he he's same yesterday, today, and
[1:30:53] forever.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; So even AI has even AI has flaws. It can
[1:30:57] give you wrong answers.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; You know, even though it's AI, so it
[1:31:00] shows you we can't put our confidence in
[1:31:02] anything in this world. We can only put
[1:31:03] our confidence in here.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Only thing, this only thing that's not
[1:31:07] going to change.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:31:10] prayer.

[1:32:31] of our lives. May you bless all the
[1:32:33] people here, Lord.
[1:32:34] and and and may as we we leave to today,
[1:32:36] Lord, later may you may your presence
[1:32:38] not just stay here, but may it go with
[1:32:40] us wherever we would go. Lord, we give
