[15:51] Joe have some busy time
[15:56] to God's unchanging and a month even
[16:03] what a relevant song amen hallelujah
[16:07] amen watches like to change your order
[16:09] service a little bit here and just keep
[16:13] them thoughts in our mind you know God's
[16:15] the same yesterday today and forever
[16:17] God don't change all these times and
[16:20] things around us can change our lights
[16:22] can change and I think they're partly
[16:24] MEC made too because he's always calling
[16:27] us up higher so he does he doesn't want
[16:30] to sab be couch potatoes and he wants us
[16:32] to grow a month but through that growth
[16:35] we need to take others with us amen so
[16:38] let's just hold that his unchanging hand
[16:40] this morning a month don't know really
[16:44] who wrote this I think it might be look
[16:46] God to bless our government with men of
[16:49] integrity amen
[16:52] was that okay there was somebody anyway
[16:56] so we just pray for that and and a good
[17:00] a good thing so a man also us read
[17:05] sister Kathleen had a request here for a
[17:10] lady she's been with me to witnessing to
[17:13] Katie
[17:14] French she's got cancer and I think is
[17:19] she wrote in her request online that
[17:22] they've kind of run out of options and
[17:27] what God's an option so you have never
[17:30] run out of options a mine sometimes we
[17:33] make him the last option unfortunately
[17:36] but he's still there it doesn't diminish
[17:39] God it just diminishes our faith in God
[17:41] we used him last instead of first amen
[17:46] so let's just pray for Katie that she
[17:49] just Kathy that she just you know leans
[17:55] I got and just believes that you know
[17:59] while you still got brought in your
[18:00] lungs so there's still time amen to have
[18:03] a relationship with Christ regardless
[18:06] how short it is
[18:08] but you know that maybe that short hour
[18:11] this on this I didn't lead into an
[18:14] eternity on that side also for her
[18:18] cousin Barney his son has overdosed
[18:23] twice now and I believe the way it said
[18:28] is Bernie is pretty distressed about it
[18:30] which we all would be so let's just pray
[18:35] for Bernie that he has peace and wisdom
[18:39] and that his son would just there's hope
[18:46] in Christ you know this world there is
[18:48] no Holt into this world so if you're
[18:51] leaning on some sort of trust in this
[18:54] world it's it's all sinking sand you
[18:57] know so let's just pray that Lord
[19:00] intervenes there and shows and reveals
[19:04] himself to Amen also that our faith
[19:10] might raise up in this late hour not
[19:16] only for ourselves but for everybody
[19:20] else that they might see it cuz they're
[19:22] looking to find something and we hope
[19:27] they just find Christ amen
[19:31] well so we have with just one
[19:33] announcement just remember our brother
[19:36] Josiah is gonna be here next
[19:38] I believe it's next Sunday and let's
[19:41] just pray for him and to yield to the
[19:47] Lord and just bring whatever the Lord
[19:49] would have for us amen and I'm sure
[19:52] we'll be blessed
[19:53] amen also if you could just remember
[19:55] sister Laurie and their sisters there
[19:57] about next Thursday I think they're
[20:01] leaving for a couple weeks and they're
[20:04] just gonna go out so we pray that the
[20:11] Lord just be with them and bless your
[20:13] time together and new travels and
[20:16] may they be a witness to whomever so
[20:24] amen
[20:25] so let's just stand let's how many's got
[20:27] an unspoken in the heart amen just love
[20:29] be known to the Lord this morning he
[20:33] says we asked we have not because we ask
[20:35] that so let's not fall shy of asking the
[20:39] Lord for what we have need of this
[20:40] morning let's just go together directly
[20:43] father Lord Lord as we gather as a
[20:46] congregation this morning as we gather
[20:48] as your people or God you said if we
[20:51] would humble ourselves Lord if we would
[20:53] just seek your face or God if Lord
[20:56] there's a lot of things in in your word
[20:59] Lord that shows this Lord that Lord we
[21:03] we should have faith in you Lord and we
[21:05] should we just lean upon you Lord in
[21:07] these times that we live in Lord for our
[21:09] children Lord that seem like maybe
[21:11] they're going into the wrong direction
[21:12] Lord God but says it's for you and your
[21:15] house Lord so Lord we're just applying
[21:19] that token this morning to each and
[21:20] every one of them Laura God then Lord

[21:32] impatient sometimes Lord Jesus but we
[21:35] know Lord there's peaceable fruits to be
[21:37] had Lord God and we pray for that this
[21:40] morning Lord we pray for any
