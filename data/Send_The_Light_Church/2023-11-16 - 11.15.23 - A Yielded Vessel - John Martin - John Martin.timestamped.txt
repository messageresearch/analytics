[34:03] amen amen God bless you turn with me if
[34:06] you would I think our first scripture
[34:08] reading is going to be Judges chapter 3
[34:11] we threw that one in there for a
[34:15] particular reason Judges chapter
[34:18] 3 and you that are over here if you want
[34:21] to you can move over here you don't have
[34:24] to
[34:25] but
[34:27] feel at Liberty today you pretty much if
[34:30] you're ever wanting a seat but somebody
[34:33] else was sitting in and I think this is
[34:35] the day that you could grab that
[34:40] seat Judges chapter 3 we're going to
[34:43] read just one verse there and that's
[34:45] verse
[34:47] 31 and after him was shamgar the son of
[34:53] anath which slew of the Philistines
[34:57] 600 men with an ox
[35:01] gold and he also delivered
[35:05] Israel amen and then
[35:08] Romans
[35:10] chapter 6 Romans chapter
[35:14] 6 verse number
[35:19] 16
[35:25] amen the script rure reads know ye not
[35:30] that to whom you yield yourselves
[35:32] servant to obey his servant ye are to
[35:36] whom you obey whether of sin unto death
[35:40] or obedience unto
[35:42] righteousness God bless you you may be
[35:44] seated we want to title this message
[35:47] today a yielded
[35:50] vessel a yielded vessel now no man is an
[35:55] island
[35:57] he is governed by one Spirit or another
[36:00] I was reading earlier that brother
[36:02] brandom said
[36:04] that we are being influenced by one of
[36:10] two
[36:12] Spirits one of two Realms is always
[36:15] constantly influencing us that's right
[36:18] we we we are not an island to where we
[36:21] we just going to pick up our own
[36:23] influence we're going to go on Google
[36:24] and we're going to go over here and
[36:26] we're going to kind of try to help
[36:28] ourselves to be
[36:30] influenced Satan can use anything he
[36:33] even comes to
[36:34] church and God can use anything the
[36:38] thing is we are being governed by one
[36:41] Spirit at all times and every human
[36:45] being is a
[36:48] servant one or the other every human is
[36:52] either yielding to
[36:55] himself which is the devil when we yield
[36:59] to our own will it's the
[37:00] devil or we're yielding to the
[37:03] scriptures which is
[37:05] god let's continue read we just want to
[37:07] read four verses before we get into this
[37:10] Romans chapter 6:1 17 but God be thanked
[37:14] that ye were the Servants of sin but ye
[37:19] have obeyed from the heart that form of
[37:22] Doctrine which was delivered unto you
[37:25] and that that obedience being made free
[37:28] from sin ye became the Servants of
[37:30] righteousness it was through the through
[37:32] The Obedience of the scriptures the
[37:36] doctrine when we begin to do what the
[37:39] scripture said rather than if it fit
[37:42] with our reasoning if it fit with our
[37:46] ideas verse uh 19 I speak after the
[37:50] manner of men because of the infirmity
[37:53] of your flesh for as ye have yielded
[37:55] your members servants to uncleanness and
[37:58] to here it is Iniquity unto iniquity
[38:01] that's how we used to be right even so
[38:03] now yield your members servants to
[38:07] righteousness and Holiness well we got a
[38:10] big dose of what iniquity was uh that
[38:13] last
[38:14] service just not doing what you've been
[38:18] instructed to do and saying well I don't
[38:20] need to do that and that's pretty much
[38:22] how we were before we ever came to the
[38:25] Lord but after we came to the Lord
[38:27] it doesn't mean that we're not in
[38:30] iniquity anymore you think of of King
[38:33] David is just a perfect example uh a
[38:37] King serving and yet committed iniquity
[38:40] so it's it's it's all around us and we
[38:44] need to be
[38:45] careful now the word yield means to give
[38:49] the right away to surrender to submit
[38:53] and this requires an attitude of
[38:55] humility because you know you're you
[38:58] know how road rage starts right somebody
[39:00] cut you off and you're upset about the
[39:03] idea or you're driving and the guy
[39:05] that's trying to get on the expressway
[39:07] um he doesn't slow down uh he he wants
[39:11] to you know he's forcing you to get over
[39:14] somebody has to yield somebody has to
[39:17] give the right away and uh the
[39:20] scriptures are are teaching us here that
[39:22] we're yielding or giving the right away
[39:25] to one thing or another it's either to
[39:27] the scriptures or to our
[39:30] will and and
[39:33] and it uh it happens throughout the
[39:36] course of the day I I I you know I may
[39:40] be in the will of God working at trusted
[39:44] to I may be in the will of God of going
[39:46] to send the light church but I may be
[39:48] completely out of the will of God of
[39:50] everything else I'm doing that
[39:52] day so this is this we want to take this
[39:56] is is as much as we can uh deeply into
[39:59] our personal lives now when it comes to
[40:02] our whole walk with the Lord I want to
[40:04] make this
[40:05] statement I want to stick it's more
[40:09] important who we yield to than who we
[40:12] actually belong
[40:14] to now this is a very strong statement
[40:18] for those that believe in
[40:20] predestination well brother John I'm a
[40:22] predestinate seat of God and that's all
[40:24] that matters to me
[40:30] I just got some scriptures for that for
[40:32] that for that spirit that would want to
[40:34] speak to us Jude 1 verse5 says I will
[40:37] therefore put you in remembrance though
[40:39] you once knew this how that the Lord
[40:41] having save the people out of the land
[40:43] of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that
[40:45] believe
[40:46] not they did not continue to yield
[40:50] themselves to
[40:52] God and we know according to Exodus that
[40:55] the Lord s said I have surely seen the
[40:58] afflictions of my people which are in
[41:00] Egypt and have heard their Crying by
[41:02] reasons of their taskmasters for I know
[41:05] their sorrows and I am come down to
[41:07] deliver them out of the hands of the
[41:11] Egyptians so this was God's people he
[41:15] delivered them he saved them but
[41:17] afterwards destroyed them so what was
[41:19] more
[41:20] important who they belong to or who they
[41:23] were Ying
[41:24] to look at verse
[41:26] and the angels which kept not their
[41:29] first estate but left their own and
[41:32] their own habitation he have reserved an
[41:35] everlasting change un under darkness and
[41:38] Judgment of the great
[41:41] day Angels which chose not to yield or
[41:46] give the right away to God but they
[41:49] decided to yield to their own
[41:52] will so what's more important who you're
[41:55] yielding to or who you belong
[41:58] to I know this is strong we wanted this
[42:01] is going to be more of a Bible study and
[42:03] I hope you don't mind a lot of reading
[42:07] tonight what we're actually yielding to
[42:09] every day is so much more important than
[42:12] what we
[42:13] realize we could look at what we're
[42:16] yielding to as simply as just seeds that
[42:18] we're
[42:19] sewing right and what and and and it and
[42:23] what we s is what we're going to reap so
[42:25] if you get up in the day and you're just
[42:27] all bothered and upset and everybody you
[42:29] talk to you're just kind of like in a
[42:31] mopy mood and you're not smiling and
[42:34] well by the end of the day you're you're
[42:36] not going to you know be reaping very
[42:38] good
[42:39] stuff and it's the same thing of how we
[42:42] yield to to certain
[42:44] Spirits now a person could be a vessel
[42:47] belonging to God but not
[42:51] saved so we're just we're trying to get
[42:54] some scriptures here that back up it's
[42:57] more important that who you're yielding
[43:00] to than who you belong to and what I
[43:02] mean of course if we're predestinated
[43:04] we're predestinated but the problem is
[43:06] the devil tells everybody that they're
[43:08] predestinated so we got to have a way to
[43:11] combat that thing so a person could be a
[43:14] vessel belonging to God but not be
[43:17] saved so unless that person yields to
[43:20] God they're never going to get saved
[43:22] it's more important to be yielded to God
[43:27] and we know that you just you repent you
[43:30] stop you stop doing your ways you say
[43:33] God I'm going to follow your ways and
[43:35] you you you do what the scripture says
[43:37] you obey the scriptures you yield to the
[43:39] scriptures and you become saved just by
[43:44] following the scriptures Saul was a
[43:46] predestinated vessel Jesus said that he
[43:50] had chosen him to bear his name but
[43:53] until Saul yielded his life
[43:58] he was only
[43:59] working against the Lord he was just
[44:03] kicking against the Lord's
[44:06] will so the importance of viting is just
[44:11] as important to day in our lives as it
[44:13] was the day that that that we got
[44:17] saved now God kicked Saul off his high
[44:21] horse but Saul had to choose to stay off
[44:25] the horse
[44:28] he had to choose to remain humble to
[44:32] follow the Lord's ways every single day
[44:35] it's that that big great thing that God
[44:39] gave us a free more agency to use it
[44:42] every day to bring God
[44:45] glory now a person could be saved by the
[44:48] blood but still be living in a dirty
[44:53] vessel they could be saved but not
[44:56] Sanctified not cleansed not washed not
[44:59] set aside for the service of
[45:02] God in order to be Sanctified one must
[45:06] learn to yield their vessel to the
[45:09] workings of the Holy Spirit according to
[45:12] the scriptures that's what brings about
[45:14] a Sanctified life we have to yield for
[45:17] that to happen you just can't come to
[45:20] church and hear this knowledge nothing's
[45:22] going to change you you have to yield to
[45:24] the scriptures now a person can be saved
[45:28] they can be Sanctified but still not
[45:30] filled with the Holy
[45:32] Ghost and that's because they have not
[45:35] continued to yield their life to the
[45:37] working of the Holy Spirit according to
[45:40] the scriptures because you got to
[45:42] continue to walk in more light more
[45:45] truth obey more scriptures to get more
[45:48] of God that's just all there is to it in
[45:49] Acts 5:32 says and we Are Witnesses of
[45:53] these things and so also is the holy
[45:56] Spirit whom God have given to them that
[45:59] obey him it comes to yielding yourself
[46:03] to the scriptures to obey the scriptures
[46:06] that we get filled with the Holy
[46:09] Ghost now of course there are times that
[46:12] God can just uh uh forgive cleanse and
[46:18] sanctify and and fills him with the Holy
[46:20] Ghost just like
[46:24] that it's true but it don't happen like
[46:27] that for the majority that's right and
[46:30] and there's a reason for it because God
[46:32] wants to prove prove
[46:34] us he wants to prove
[46:37] us it doesn't matter if you need to be
[46:40] saved Sanctified or filled with the Holy
[46:41] Ghost the secret key is to yield Our
[46:44] Lives more to the scripture so we have
[46:46] to get serious with God lord show me
[46:49] which other scriptures am I not yielding
[46:51] to that has to just be a heart's desire
[46:54] that's where the love affair comes
[46:57] in I wish we could just come to church
[47:00] hear the word you know turn the computer
[47:03] off as it were stop live streaming and
[47:05] be changed no no it's much harder than
[47:09] that we've got to bring our vessel under
[47:11] subjection to all those
[47:13] scriptures second Timothy 3:16 we've
[47:16] read this that all scriptures given by
[47:18] the inspiration of God and it is
[47:20] profitable for Doctrine for Repro for
[47:22] correction for instruction and
[47:23] righteousness that the man of God may be
[47:26] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[47:29] good works I I say the scriptures tell
[47:32] us how to yield properly the scriptures
[47:35] teach us how to yield properly know ye
[47:38] not that to whom you yield yourself
[47:40] servants to obey his servant ye are to
[47:43] whom you obey whether of sin unto death
[47:46] or of obedience unto righteousness now
[47:49] when I was in the world nobody in the
[47:51] world could have convinced me that I was
[47:54] I was a servant of the
[47:57] devil no
[47:59] way no no I mean I I was doing bad
[48:02] things yeah I yes I was smoking I was
[48:05] drinking I I I did bad things but nobody
[48:08] was going to tell me I was a servant of
[48:10] the devil
[48:13] that's and today there's so many
[48:15] Christians that have that same mentality
[48:17] so many Believers that have that same
[48:20] Pride that same
[48:22] mentality but to whom you yield yourself
[48:24] too that's it you're a servant of
[48:28] whoever you're ying and the thing is
[48:30] there's two things Satan tried to get
[48:33] Eve to yield to her will he had entice
[48:36] her with what she could have with her
[48:38] will that she couldn't have with God's
[48:40] Will and the devil Works overtime at
[48:43] trying to get us to to bite onto
[48:46] something that isn't God's
[48:50] will Saul was a yielded vessel onto sin
[48:54] but he just didn't know it
[48:56] we could say he was a yielded vessel
[48:58] unto
[49:01] himself he was like everyone that is
[49:04] born born to to do your own will that's
[49:07] why we need to be born again to do the
[49:10] will of
[49:12] God he
[49:14] learned he learned uh from the get-go to
[49:18] to to yield to his own understanding
[49:20] when his mom and dad were talking about
[49:22] you know who's going to teach our little
[49:24] son
[49:26] well they got the best brother B says
[49:28] they got the best man that they could
[49:30] get to teach him that
[49:32] was
[49:36] um Amia that's right thank you they got
[49:39] the best because they were leaning to
[49:41] their own understanding here's a man
[49:43] that can do it brother Bram says just
[49:46] five minutes in his presence can do more
[49:48] than what five years in a seminary of
[49:51] the best training just get in the
[49:53] presence of God he did what was right in
[49:57] his own eyes but he was
[50:01] evil he was evil you know he was viewed
[50:06] as a Pharisee above the Pharisees as a
[50:08] Hebrew of the Hebrews as a as a great
[50:10] man but he was
[50:12] evil because he leaned to his own
[50:15] understandings he he did he did what was
[50:19] wise in his own eyes it wasn't until he
[50:22] feared the Lord he humbled himself and
[50:24] he departed from muing to his own will
[50:27] that his eyes became more and more
[50:31] open turn with me if you would to the
[50:34] book of of Judges I want to go and and
[50:37] spend some time in the Book of Judges
[50:42] now have you
[50:45] ever just felt that you were in you were
[50:51] battling something that you couldn't put
[50:52] your finger on
[50:54] it I mean sometimes it's just trial
[50:57] after
[50:58] trial and you know there the Bible does
[51:01] say that there are there are times that
[51:03] there is a need of manifold
[51:05] temptations that there there's a need
[51:07] for us to go through
[51:09] things
[51:12] but I think a lot of times that we're in
[51:15] a war a war is going around all of us
[51:20] often and we don't
[51:22] recognize the battle we don't recognize
[51:24] the enemy we don't recognize what's
[51:27] happening how many feels that God could
[51:31] allow things to come in our life because
[51:33] we're not obeying
[51:36] him now there's something that we don't
[51:38] really want to look much into right and
[51:41] I love that you all raised your hands
[51:43] and you're behind this because it's just
[51:45] going to make it so much easier
[51:48] today the thing is it it takes a real
[51:51] humbleness of heart to say Lord would
[51:53] you show me is there something
[51:55] that I'm I'm yielding to the wrong thing
[51:58] and I'm doing the wrong
[52:00] thing so in the Book of Judges I'm just
[52:02] going to read the first U couple verses
[52:06] here in verse chapter one now after the
[52:09] death of Joshua and it came to pass that
[52:11] the children of Israel asked the Lord
[52:13] saying who shall go up for us against
[52:15] the Canaanites first to fight against
[52:17] them and the Lord said Judah shall go up
[52:20] uh behold I have
[52:22] delivered uh delivered the land into his
[52:27] hand so here we're we're going to see
[52:31] that God did not
[52:34] take the enemy out of the land so God
[52:37] gave Joshua Joshua went in there and he
[52:40] took possession of the land but the the
[52:44] enemy was not completely destroyed and
[52:46] this is
[52:48] important because our enemy is not
[52:50] completely destroyed so verse verse uh
[52:54] 21 now
[52:55] and the children of
[52:58] Benjamin did not drive out the
[53:04] jebusites that inhabit Jerusalem notice
[53:07] Benjamin didn't do it now I just if I
[53:10] could back up to verse 19 and the Lord
[53:13] was with Judah and he drove out the
[53:15] inhabitants of the mountain but could
[53:17] not drive out the inhabitants of the
[53:18] valley because they had the Chariots of
[53:21] iron and they gave uh herban unto Caleb
[53:25] as Moses said and he expelled then the
[53:29] three sons of anoch now you see that
[53:32] they're taking possession of the land
[53:35] that God gave but at the same time that
[53:37] they're taking possession their enemy is
[53:39] allowed to stay around them are you with
[53:42] me verse 27 neither did manessa drive
[53:45] out the inhabitants of Beth Sheen and
[53:48] her towns verse 29 neither did Ephraim
[53:52] drive out the Canaanites verse 30
[53:54] neither did zon drive out the
[53:56] inhabitants of kitan neither did Asha
[53:59] drive out the inhabitants of acho verse
[54:01] 32 but the uh a uh ashit dwelt among the
[54:06] Canaanites and inhabitants of the land
[54:08] for they did not drive them out verse 33
[54:10] neither did uh Na naph drive out the
[54:15] inhabitants just they did not drive out
[54:18] all the
[54:21] inhabitants
[54:23] h h
[54:27] that's kind of scary don't you want the
[54:28] enemy away from
[54:31] you ver chapter 2 verse number one and
[54:34] the angel of the Lord came up from
[54:36] gilgal to bulam and said I made you to
[54:41] go up out of the out of Egypt and have
[54:45] brought you unto the land which I swear
[54:47] unto your fathers and I said I will
[54:51] never break my Covenant with you praise
[54:54] God for that
[54:55] and he and ye shall make no league with
[55:00] the inhabitants of this land you can't
[55:03] have any connection with the
[55:07] enemy you shall throw down their
[55:10] altars but ye have not obeyed my
[55:15] voice why have ye done
[55:19] this so God call I'm I'm going to keep
[55:22] my Covenant you know you stay with me
[55:24] you follow my word you follow the light
[55:27] you follow me you do what I tell you to
[55:29] do there won't be anybody about to stand
[55:31] before you all the days of your life
[55:33] that's what he told Joshua but if you
[55:36] choose not to follow the things that I'm
[55:38] telling you every day
[55:43] then then you're going to have troubles
[55:46] you're going to have
[55:47] troubles wherefore I also said I will
[55:51] not drive them out from before you but
[55:54] they shall shall be as thorns in your
[55:57] sides and their gods shall be a snare
[56:01] unto you well remember the the the the
[56:04] parable that Jesus gave about the word
[56:06] falling on four different types of
[56:08] ground and one of the grounds was a
[56:10] ground that had thorns in
[56:13] it and it it it it it it became a
[56:17] snare and and sometimes we don't realize
[56:22] it but we're dealing
[56:26] with
[56:28] snares we're dealing with snares now how
[56:31] do I how do we know if that's it get
[56:33] serious in
[56:35] prayer you can you can take the proud
[56:37] side and say no I'm I'm so perfectly in
[56:40] the will of God I'm walking nothing you
[56:42] know this is all the devil all the devil
[56:44] all the devil like God doesn't have any
[56:46] control about
[56:48] things we're just going to go through
[56:50] the scriptures why why was God why was
[56:54] God God so against Israel why did God
[56:57] let his own
[56:59] people uh become in bondage and why did
[57:02] he let the enemy come against
[57:06] them why it wasn't because he was being
[57:10] mean they were not following
[57:13] him and every time they cried out to
[57:17] God every time they humbled thems God
[57:20] came and delivered them he's just
[57:23] faithful
[57:26] all
[57:27] right and it came to pass when the angel
[57:30] of the Lord spake these words verse four
[57:33] unto the children of Israel that the
[57:36] people lifted up their voices and wept
[57:38] well this was just sad news this was
[57:40] just sad news nobody wants to hear that
[57:44] uh God is going to be against them this
[57:47] is going to happen let's go to verse
[57:50] 11 and the children of Israel did evil
[57:53] in the sight of the Lord and sered
[57:56] balum and the and they forsook the Lord
[58:00] God of their fathers which brought them
[58:02] out out of the land of Egypt and follow
[58:04] other gods of gods of the people which
[58:07] were round about
[58:11] them and bowed themselves unto them and
[58:13] provoked the Lord to so here it is they
[58:15] got involved with the things of the
[58:18] world that were around
[58:20] them and they forsook the Lord now they
[58:24] didn't stop
[58:25] going to church and they didn't say God
[58:26] isn't God but as soon as you start doing
[58:30] your will as soon as you decide that I
[58:33] don't have to to to to do what God is
[58:37] wanting me to do you're forsaking the
[58:40] Lord and we look at forsaking the Lord
[58:43] as somebody that picks up leaves the
[58:45] church and never comes
[58:48] back but God is looking at the
[58:51] heart he says you know with their lips
[58:54] they worship me but their heart is far
[58:55] from me so God is looking at the heart
[58:58] God tells brother Brandon make sure you
[58:59] tell the people that their their their
[59:02] thoughts speak louder in heaven than
[59:04] their words do on Earth so there's a
[59:07] something that goes on before the
[59:09] children of Israel ever went back into
[59:11] Egypt before it was in their heart to do
[59:15] it and so we can get involved real
[59:19] simple with the things that are outside
[59:21] of this church and outside of this word
[59:24] very easy
[59:26] easy and the devil has a clever way of
[59:29] saying well it's it's of the
[59:33] lord it's God still wants me to do
[59:37] it that's why we you need to be real
[59:40] humble real honest let the word
[59:43] vindicate what you're saying let the
[59:45] word vindicate it don't fight against
[59:48] the word
[59:50] amen all right verse 13 and they forsook
[59:53] the Lord and served BM and this other
[59:57] Queen of Heaven and the angel of the
[59:59] Lord was hot against Israel whoa it
[1:00:03] wasn't just a little bit against them
[1:00:05] but hot I don't want the Lord hot
[1:00:07] against me and he delivered them into
[1:00:10] the hands of the spoilers that spoiled
[1:00:13] them and he literally sold them into
[1:00:17] slavery that's what that means the hands
[1:00:20] of their enemies roundout so that they
[1:00:22] could not any longer stand before their
[1:00:25] enemies whether soever they went out the
[1:00:28] hand of the Lord was against them for
[1:00:30] evil as the Lord said and as the Lord
[1:00:33] had sworn into them sworn onto them and
[1:00:36] they were greatly distressed so notice
[1:00:38] this they were not able the end of verse
[1:00:42] 14 they were not able to stand before
[1:00:45] their
[1:00:48] enemy
[1:00:51] now it's one thing if there's a problem
[1:00:54] and you can take care of the
[1:00:57] problem you got an enemy you can take
[1:00:59] care of the
[1:01:00] enemy but when you got an enemy and no
[1:01:04] longer you can take care of him that
[1:01:06] means you've become an
[1:01:09] outright servant to
[1:01:12] them are you with me and and and and a
[1:01:16] lot of times not even recognizing
[1:01:21] it verse 16 nevertheless the Lord raised
[1:01:24] up judges which delivered them out of
[1:01:26] their hand of those that spoiled them
[1:01:29] and yet they would not hearken unto
[1:01:32] their
[1:01:32] judges but they went a horn after other
[1:01:35] gods and bowed themselves unto them and
[1:01:37] turned quickly out of the
[1:01:39] way which their fathers walked in
[1:01:42] obeying the Commandments of the Lord but
[1:01:45] they did not
[1:01:49] so and when the Lord raised up judges
[1:01:53] the Lord was with the judge
[1:01:55] and delivered them out of the hand of
[1:01:56] the enemy all the days of the judge for
[1:01:59] it repented the Lord because of their
[1:02:01] groanings by the reason of them that
[1:02:03] were oppressed them and Vex them and it
[1:02:05] came to pass when the judge was dead
[1:02:07] that they
[1:02:08] returned and corrupted themselves more
[1:02:12] than their fathers in the following
[1:02:14] other gods to serve them and to bow down
[1:02:16] unto them they ceased not from their own
[1:02:22] doings nor from their stubborn
[1:02:26] way
[1:02:29] H Lord help us and the anger of the Lord
[1:02:33] was hot against Israel I don't want the
[1:02:37] Lord hot against me and he said because
[1:02:40] that this people have transgressed my
[1:02:43] Covenant which I commanded their fathers
[1:02:45] and have not hearkened unto my voice I
[1:02:47] also will not henceforth drive out any
[1:02:52] from before them of the the Nations
[1:02:55] which Joshua left when he died so
[1:02:58] there's a covenant we all have a
[1:03:00] covenant with God we told God when we
[1:03:04] got saved that we we repent of our sin
[1:03:08] forgive us Lord we promised we're going
[1:03:12] to get baptized we're going to follow
[1:03:13] you all the days of our life we're going
[1:03:15] to do what you want us to do that was
[1:03:17] our decision that we made now God has
[1:03:19] given us time to prove where we stand
[1:03:21] with that
[1:03:23] commitment that's where you see
[1:03:25] everybody is
[1:03:26] not on fire everybody's just not I I
[1:03:30] want all that you have for me Lord
[1:03:33] because there's approving
[1:03:36] time that through them I look at verse
[1:03:40] 22 that through them I may prove Israel
[1:03:45] whether they will keep the way of the
[1:03:48] Lord to walk therein as their fathers
[1:03:51] did keep it or
[1:03:55] not therefore the Lord left those
[1:03:58] Nations without driving them out hastily
[1:04:01] neither delivered he them into the hand
[1:04:03] of Joshua now ver chapter 3 verse one
[1:04:06] now these are the Nations which the Lord
[1:04:08] left to prove Israel by them even as
[1:04:12] many of Israel have not known all the
[1:04:16] wars of Canaan only that the generations
[1:04:19] of the children of Israel might know now
[1:04:21] here it is to teach them War
[1:04:24] or at the least such as no before knew
[1:04:29] nothing thereof namely the five Lords
[1:04:31] the Philistines Canaanites sodomites
[1:04:34] hivites
[1:04:36] um and
[1:04:38] uh uh that dwelt in the land of Lebanon
[1:04:41] Al so God allowed these to stay there
[1:04:45] and he allowed them to stay there for a
[1:04:47] reason one is so that his people Israel
[1:04:51] would learn how to fight learn how to
[1:04:53] war
[1:04:55] and to prove whether they're going to
[1:04:57] fight against them to keep them out to
[1:05:01] keep them away or if we're just going to
[1:05:04] not fight and we're just going to make a
[1:05:06] league with them we're just going to do
[1:05:08] the things of the world are you with me
[1:05:11] now this is now you notice everything in
[1:05:13] the Old Testament is a natural thing
[1:05:15] that
[1:05:16] transpired now in the New Testament it's
[1:05:18] a spiritual
[1:05:20] warfare there's a Warfare going on and
[1:05:24] every we can see better what's happening
[1:05:27] in the spiritual realm when we look at
[1:05:30] the Old Testament and we see what
[1:05:32] happened we are the spiritual Jerusalem
[1:05:35] we are the spiritual
[1:05:38] Israel but yet God just doesn't give us
[1:05:41] everything we
[1:05:42] want God is more interested in us
[1:05:45] yielding to him than us just waving the
[1:05:47] flag and say I belong to
[1:05:50] God he wants us to learn to yield he
[1:05:53] wants us to war war against the things
[1:05:55] of the world he wants us to war against
[1:05:57] our own
[1:05:59] will cuz we're in a
[1:06:03] battle all
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:10] let's drop on
[1:06:13] down I just I want to read verse four
[1:06:17] and they were to prove Israel by them to
[1:06:22] know whether they would hearken un the
[1:06:23] command Commandments of the Lord which
[1:06:25] he have commanded their fathers by the L
[1:06:28] by the hand of Moses now I just wonder
[1:06:31] God is proving us those that are on the
[1:06:34] live stream those that are here God is
[1:06:36] always proving
[1:06:38] us because like brother Ron says he's
[1:06:40] always calling us up
[1:06:42] higher God expects more out of me to
[1:06:45] whom much is given much is required so
[1:06:47] every day every week every month God
[1:06:50] expects more from us so I want to ask
[1:06:53] this question to everyone that's
[1:06:55] listening what is God proving
[1:06:59] you because if we don't think God's
[1:07:01] proving us
[1:07:04] then we don't have nothing to worry
[1:07:07] about and that's the problem we're not
[1:07:09] we're not being aware can I just read
[1:07:12] just a
[1:07:14] few oh I I will understand I want to I
[1:07:17] want to I want I'm really doing my best
[1:07:19] to tie this into our spiritual battle
[1:07:21] but I'm trying to show the example of
[1:07:24] what's happening in the Old Testament
[1:07:26] now let's take a look at uh first at
[1:07:29] verse uh five and the children of Israel
[1:07:31] dwelt among the Canaanites the Hittites
[1:07:34] the amorites the pites Hittites
[1:07:36] jebusites and they took their daughters
[1:07:38] uh to be their wives and gave their
[1:07:40] daughters to their sons and serve their
[1:07:41] gods and the children of Israel did evil
[1:07:43] in the sight of the Lord and forgot the
[1:07:45] Lord their God and served balum and and
[1:07:47] the Groves and therefore the anger of
[1:07:49] the Lord was hot against Israel and he
[1:07:51] sold them into the hand of the kushim
[1:07:54] King all right and Israel served 8 years
[1:07:59] verse 9 and when the children of Israel
[1:08:01] Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised up a
[1:08:05] deliverer to the children of Israel who
[1:08:08] delivered them out uh delivered them
[1:08:11] even alneel the son of Caz uh and that
[1:08:16] was Caleb's younger brother isn't that
[1:08:19] isn't that so neat Caleb's younger
[1:08:21] brother was the first judge and this
[1:08:23] Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he
[1:08:26] judged Israel and went out to War and
[1:08:29] the Lord delivered the kushan rash king
[1:08:32] of that that gentleman and the Lord had
[1:08:37] uh and and and the land had
[1:08:39] rest uh 40
[1:08:42] years uh and annel the son of kzar died
[1:08:48] so here you see Israel did Evil and then
[1:08:52] God raised somebody up and I'll tell you
[1:08:55] it wasn't this this did not
[1:08:58] happen uh you just sit there and you
[1:09:00] stay in your sin and I and I'm just
[1:09:04] going to go kill your enemy for you
[1:09:06] that's not how it
[1:09:09] happens no because if that's how it
[1:09:11] happened then there then they would
[1:09:14] continue to go on serving their gods but
[1:09:19] you'll see each time that this happens
[1:09:22] there was peace in the land
[1:09:25] all right verse 12 and the children of
[1:09:27] Israel did Evil again after those eight
[1:09:30] years in the sight of the Lord and the
[1:09:32] Lord strengthened agon the king of Moab
[1:09:36] against Israel because they had done
[1:09:38] evil in the sight of the Lord and He
[1:09:40] gathered unto him the children of Amron
[1:09:42] and AMC and went and smote Israel and
[1:09:47] possessed the city of palm trees and so
[1:09:49] the children of Israel serve agon the
[1:09:52] king of Moab 18
[1:09:56] years but when the children of Israel
[1:09:59] Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised them
[1:10:01] up a deliverer e Ehud the son of G Gira
[1:10:07] a benjamite a a man left-handed and by
[1:10:11] him the children of Israel sent a
[1:10:14] present unto igog the king of Moab okay
[1:10:18] and we're not going to read it all you
[1:10:19] got time you can read it but um God used
[1:10:23] this second judge to deliver Israel
[1:10:26] again and verse 28 and he said unto them
[1:10:29] follow after me for the Lord have
[1:10:32] delivered your enemies the moabites into
[1:10:35] your hand and they went down after him
[1:10:37] and took the fors of Jordan toward Moab
[1:10:40] and suffered not a man to pass over and
[1:10:42] they slew um and they slew of Moab at
[1:10:45] that time about
[1:10:48] 10,000 men all Lusty and all men of
[1:10:51] valure and and their escape not a man so
[1:10:54] Moab subdued that day under uh was
[1:10:58] subdued that day under the hand of
[1:10:59] Israel and the land had rest 80
[1:11:06] years and after
[1:11:08] that was
[1:11:10] shamgar the son of anith which slew of
[1:11:14] the Philistines 600 men with an ox gold
[1:11:21] and he also delivered
[1:11:25] Israel now that's all we know about this
[1:11:28] man there is nothing else written about
[1:11:31] this
[1:11:33] man we're going to talk about this
[1:11:36] man in a
[1:11:38] minute but I like to talk about our
[1:11:41] spiritual battle turn with me if you
[1:11:45] would to the book of First Peter chapter
[1:11:50] 5 1 Peter chapter 5: 7 how many believes
[1:11:53] you're in a battle
[1:11:57] amen casting all your care upon him for
[1:12:01] he carth for you now what do we have to
[1:12:05] do we have to be sober we have to be
[1:12:07] vigilant because our adversary the Devil
[1:12:10] is a Roy lion walketh about seeking whom
[1:12:12] he may
[1:12:14] devour whom resist steadfast in the fath
[1:12:17] knowing that the same things that are
[1:12:19] going on in your life is going on with
[1:12:21] other people in the church not only in
[1:12:23] the church but around the
[1:12:25] world so
[1:12:29] we in order to be sober to be vigilant
[1:12:32] you literally have to be yielding to God
[1:12:36] you cannot be yielding yourself to just
[1:12:39] any old L doy whatever comes to your
[1:12:42] mind because the devil is looking for
[1:12:44] the person who's not yielding to God to
[1:12:48] devour them to take them in a snare he's
[1:12:52] looking for the weak he's looking for
[1:12:54] those who are not in the battle he's
[1:12:57] looking for those who simply just doing
[1:13:00] their own
[1:13:02] will if you're a human being with a good
[1:13:06] understanding of the scripture when you
[1:13:08] get up tomorrow morning you're not going
[1:13:10] to want your flesh is not going to want
[1:13:11] to do God's
[1:13:13] will and you're going to have to do
[1:13:15] something to make sure that thing is
[1:13:17] under
[1:13:19] subjection because this is the battle
[1:13:21] that we're in
[1:13:26] Ephesians chapter
[1:13:27] 6 verse 11 now what are our instructions
[1:13:32] our instructions here are to put on the
[1:13:36] whole armor of God that we may be able
[1:13:40] to stand against the Ws of the devil
[1:13:44] okay we're not watching some uh colorful
[1:13:47] entertaining story in the Old Testament
[1:13:51] that is just giving us an understanding
[1:13:53] of what's really
[1:13:55] happening
[1:13:56] in in this new testament for we wrestle
[1:14:00] not against flesh and
[1:14:03] blood but against principalities against
[1:14:06] Powers against the rulers of the
[1:14:09] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:14:12] wickedness in high places we must come
[1:14:15] to grips that we are all battling these
[1:14:19] Spirits the more that we can recognize
[1:14:22] it that's right
[1:14:24] the quicker we can gain
[1:14:26] Victory because it's these spirits that
[1:14:29] are trying to get us to LA to relax in
[1:14:33] Leo
[1:14:34] DEA to take it easy to feel like I'm in
[1:14:38] need of nothing to not feel this I need
[1:14:42] to fear the
[1:14:43] lord just just keep doing what I'm doing
[1:14:46] and it should be good
[1:14:50] enough
[1:14:51] look I believe believe that as you all
[1:14:55] agree with me that God allows things to
[1:15:00] happen in our life because we make wrong
[1:15:03] decisions now this happens to me a
[1:15:06] lot you go to do something and it didn't
[1:15:09] work out the way you want to and then
[1:15:12] you Tred to do and then it don't work
[1:15:13] and you try to do this and you got to
[1:15:15] step back and say Lord did I miss you
[1:15:18] somewhere am I in your will are you
[1:15:21] trying to tell me something
[1:15:23] because as much as we're end time
[1:15:26] message Believers it doesn't mean
[1:15:28] everything that we're doing everything
[1:15:30] we're saying every place we're walking
[1:15:32] that that God is prospering our
[1:15:34] way it's a battle out there and I don't
[1:15:38] want to be the one that's causing the
[1:15:40] problem I've got to be honest with
[1:15:42] myself am I Ying myself to the Lord or
[1:15:46] am I just Ying to what I think the Lord
[1:15:48] wants me to
[1:15:51] do all right for we don't wrestle
[1:15:54] against flesh and blood but against
[1:15:55] Spirits wherefore take unto you the
[1:15:58] whole armor of God that you may be able
[1:16:00] to withstand in the evil day and having
[1:16:03] done all to stand now we're not going to
[1:16:05] go ahead and read the rest of this
[1:16:06] chapter but you know about the whole
[1:16:08] armor of God you've got to yield your
[1:16:10] life to put on the whole armor of God
[1:16:12] you can't just get up and you know go on
[1:16:15] with the day do a couple little prayers
[1:16:17] forget to put the armor
[1:16:19] on you've got to yield because the devil
[1:16:22] would like nothing better for you to get
[1:16:24] up and just you know take care of your
[1:16:26] important things tomorrow just take care
[1:16:28] of them he he just don't want you to put
[1:16:31] the armor run he don't want you to be
[1:16:34] sober he don't want you to be vigilant
[1:16:37] he wants you to think that you know God
[1:16:39] has just ordained every step that you're
[1:16:40] taking and it doesn't matter what you're
[1:16:42] doing God's going to be with you no
[1:16:44] matter
[1:16:46] what when I look at my life I I have to
[1:16:51] say I I I wish my steps were more
[1:16:54] pleasing to the Lord you know just being
[1:16:57] honest with
[1:16:59] myself I mean you you can't go hardly 10
[1:17:02] minutes and you're thinking was that
[1:17:03] thought of the Lord Lord forgive me for
[1:17:06] that thought for even letting it stay
[1:17:07] there two
[1:17:10] seconds all right 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:17:12] 10:3 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 for
[1:17:15] though we walk in this flesh we do not
[1:17:19] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[1:17:23] our Warfare they're not carnal but
[1:17:26] they're
[1:17:27] Mighty through god notice it's through
[1:17:29] God to the powing down of the stronghold
[1:17:33] so where is it happening in our
[1:17:38] mind see we may be
[1:17:41] able to control our
[1:17:45] body from doing certain things but we
[1:17:48] can still let our mind go
[1:17:51] there casting down
[1:17:54] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:17:58] exalts itself against the word of God
[1:18:01] the knowledge of God and bring into
[1:18:04] captivity every thought what to The
[1:18:07] Obedience of Christ this takes a
[1:18:12] humility and having in a Readiness to
[1:18:16] Revenge all
[1:18:18] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:18:20] fulfilled so we see right here that this
[1:18:23] is exactly what God required in the Old
[1:18:26] Testament with Israel that they had to
[1:18:29] become they had to Humble themselves
[1:18:31] they had to cry out to God they had to
[1:18:33] say God help me I will follow you and
[1:18:35] then God sent a deliver God delivered
[1:18:37] them and God blessed them until they
[1:18:42] decided to start doing their own doings
[1:18:45] again and it was a repution you see it
[1:18:48] happening year after
[1:18:51] year
[1:18:54] we are in that same
[1:18:57] battle we are in that same battle day
[1:18:59] after day after day week after week
[1:19:02] month after
[1:19:04] month the devil's trying to get us away
[1:19:08] from obeying at least a part of the
[1:19:11] word and he's got us soaked in with a
[1:19:16] well you know as as as long as this and
[1:19:19] this and this you should be
[1:19:21] okay
[1:19:24] but what about go he
[1:19:29] out what about spend some time living
[1:19:32] for
[1:19:33] others what about the other parts
[1:19:37] see all right James chapter
[1:19:40] 4 James chapter 4 verse 5 do you do you
[1:19:44] think that the scripture saith in vain
[1:19:46] the spirit that dwelleth in US it
[1:19:49] lusteth to do its own thing but he
[1:19:53] giveth more grace wherefore he sayith
[1:19:55] God resists the proud but he gives Grace
[1:19:58] unto the humble God never came down and
[1:20:01] delivered Israel until they humbled
[1:20:03] themselves and said God I need
[1:20:06] you so he says here in verse 7 submit
[1:20:09] yourself therefore to God in other words
[1:20:11] yield Your Vessel to God and resist the
[1:20:16] devil and he will flee from you now I
[1:20:20] want to know how often do we re recogniz
[1:20:23] the
[1:20:24] devil how often do we recognize him to
[1:20:27] even resist
[1:20:29] him because when he came to
[1:20:32] Eve he never
[1:20:35] said I am
[1:20:38] evil and I want to present to you to do
[1:20:42] your
[1:20:42] [Applause]
[1:20:44] will no he came the other way God does
[1:20:47] know everything's going to be okay
[1:20:49] you're GNA be just like him if you just
[1:20:51] do what you want to do
[1:20:54] so I wonder how often we really
[1:20:56] recognize the enemy in our
[1:20:59] life so submit your will to God Submit
[1:21:03] Your Vessel to God resist the devil and
[1:21:06] you know what he'll flee from you you
[1:21:09] got to you got to deliver that's god
[1:21:12] with you he's the judge that he has sent
[1:21:15] the word will judge the enemy after we
[1:21:18] submit to God but we got to
[1:21:21] submit
[1:21:23] draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh
[1:21:25] to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners
[1:21:27] purify your hearts ye double-minded be
[1:21:30] afflicted mourn weep let your laughter
[1:21:32] be turned to mourning and your joy to
[1:21:34] heaviness humble yourselves in the sight
[1:21:36] of the Lord and He Shall lift you up now
[1:21:41] we all want that we all want
[1:21:46] that and we know how it
[1:21:50] happens it happens not when we hear our
[1:21:53] favorite song our favorite
[1:21:57] preacher it's when we choose to Humble
[1:21:59] ourselves and say Lord sorry if I have
[1:22:03] not been pleasing
[1:22:08] you 1 Peter 55 says likewise ye younger
[1:22:12] submit yourselves to the Elder y all be
[1:22:14] subject uh yay all of you be subject one
[1:22:17] to another be clothed with humility for
[1:22:20] God resists the proud he gives grace to
[1:22:22] the humble verse 6 humble yourselves
[1:22:24] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[1:22:27] that he may exalt you in due time now
[1:22:29] what is he exalting you what is he
[1:22:32] exalting you uh
[1:22:37] to he's exalting you above your
[1:22:44] enemy right now we are our greatest
[1:22:49] enemy and he exalts us above
[1:22:54] that by one easy path
[1:22:59] humility how humble can we be if we're
[1:23:03] always thinking that we're never
[1:23:05] wrong how humble can we
[1:23:10] be you know it's a it's Pride I'd rather
[1:23:14] say I'm wrong I believe I'm wrong and
[1:23:17] not be wrong you
[1:23:19] understand you turn over every Rock make
[1:23:23] sure because there's a spiritual battle
[1:23:26] going
[1:23:27] on and we we see in the scriptures
[1:23:30] clearly how the Lord delivers it's
[1:23:33] through humility and we all got
[1:23:35] situations going on our life and I'll
[1:23:36] tell you some of the trials I've been
[1:23:38] through I got to sit back and I'll be
[1:23:39] honest with you I have to ask this
[1:23:41] question Lord was that me that made that
[1:23:44] decision because it was
[1:23:46] wrong at the time it looked like the
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:51] one for three months I made these light
[1:23:54] fixtures they're going to I'm going to
[1:23:55] make them
[1:23:57] work well maybe it wasn't the Lord's
[1:24:01] will they're lessons things are
[1:24:07] lessons take time to pray Lord are you
[1:24:10] in this I know i' I've already buried
[1:24:14] myself in this situation for a month a
[1:24:17] year five years whatever it would be but
[1:24:20] Lord I want to know now Lord where do
[1:24:22] you want me to be right
[1:24:24] now it takes that realness between you
[1:24:28] and God not you and your family this is
[1:24:31] an individual what God deals with
[1:24:33] Gentiles
[1:24:35] individually God may be dealing with you
[1:24:37] something totally different than he's
[1:24:38] dealing with your
[1:24:41] spouse so it requires the same thing
[1:24:44] from all of
[1:24:46] us search me Lord now if you feel like
[1:24:49] you don't got any
[1:24:51] battles
[1:24:53] then maybe this message isn't for you
[1:24:55] but maybe what you could do is you could
[1:24:56] take this message and help somebody with
[1:24:59] it there was a a judge he was the third
[1:25:03] judge and his name was
[1:25:07] shamgar and what was so uh special about
[1:25:12] this
[1:25:14] man um
[1:25:16] that in one sense he seemed to be so
[1:25:19] insignificant that there was only one
[1:25:21] verse to scripture written about him
[1:25:24] there was nothing else written about
[1:25:28] him it was just he delivered but I'll
[1:25:31] say it like this he yielded his vessel
[1:25:34] to God you just if we take out the
[1:25:37] important
[1:25:39] parts that are so obvious he definitely
[1:25:43] was not a man that just made a league
[1:25:48] with the
[1:25:49] world his League was with God he stayed
[1:25:53] with God he yielded himself to God and
[1:25:56] God used him in a mighty
[1:25:59] way and you
[1:26:01] notice he didn't build more
[1:26:09] tanks he had an ax
[1:26:13] gold now how brother Brandon describes
[1:26:17] this
[1:26:21] situation this Ox gold was a a a a rod
[1:26:26] with a piece of H brass on the on the
[1:26:29] end of it that you prob you proded the
[1:26:32] the ox to keep going and that's all he
[1:26:36] had now as he tells the story he he
[1:26:39] refers to the same
[1:26:42] thing that happened to Gideon he was in
[1:26:46] the
[1:26:47] barn and he was just a very humble man
[1:26:52] and and he just wanted enough food to to
[1:26:56] take care of of of his family and um the
[1:27:02] the Philistines would come in and after
[1:27:06] the Harvest after all the work is done
[1:27:08] they would just go in
[1:27:12] destroy the uh Israel and take the
[1:27:18] food now we don't see that written about
[1:27:21] him but the prophets saw
[1:27:23] it and he typed it
[1:27:26] with uh Gideon about 90 years later I
[1:27:30] think about that but this thing probably
[1:27:33] was going on for a while because they
[1:27:34] were dwelling with their
[1:27:36] enemy and just going on and on but
[1:27:39] notice the main thing was this man was a
[1:27:42] h investor to God and God kept his
[1:27:45] Covenant with
[1:27:46] him and he didn't need to have a whole
[1:27:50] support system
[1:27:53] it was just him it was just one man
[1:27:57] taking care of 600 men is it 600 men or
[1:28:01] 6,000 600 one man sometimes we're afraid
[1:28:06] to tackle one
[1:28:09] problem and he just used what he
[1:28:13] had he didn't have a whole lot he didn't
[1:28:16] have the whole Army of Israel behind
[1:28:19] him he couldn't call 91
[1:28:24] one but he had a league with God he had
[1:28:27] a covenant with God and I'll tell you it
[1:28:30] doesn't matter what's happening in our
[1:28:32] church it doesn't matter what's
[1:28:33] happening in our homes it don't matter
[1:28:35] what's happening in the world we have a
[1:28:40] a a covenant with God
[1:28:41] alone if you go into Rapture it's
[1:28:44] because of your relationship with
[1:28:51] God
[1:28:52] no matter what talent you
[1:28:56] have we often feel like we ain't got
[1:28:58] much of a
[1:29:00] talent and I'm okay with that I'm okay
[1:29:03] you know if God didn't want to give you
[1:29:06] know me a talent that that could sing
[1:29:09] like a lot of the singers out
[1:29:11] there I'm okay with that look what the
[1:29:15] look with the people in the world that
[1:29:17] have a talent to sing and they're
[1:29:18] they're using it for the devil they're
[1:29:20] using it for themselves to get Glory to
[1:29:22] get money to get
[1:29:23] whatever I'm okay that I'm not
[1:29:27] talented that doesn't stop God from
[1:29:30] seeing me
[1:29:33] through use what you
[1:29:36] have shamard didn't go next door and
[1:29:39] grab
[1:29:40] some other
[1:29:42] tools just use what he had and he got
[1:29:46] the job done and I'll tell you you're
[1:29:50] your love for God your your prayer
[1:29:51] prayers your prayers your faith in God
[1:29:55] they can deliver the church praise God
[1:29:59] they can do they can do Mighty things in
[1:30:01] this
[1:30:04] church the Bible says the prayer of
[1:30:06] faith shall save the
[1:30:09] sick if God be for us who can be against
[1:30:12] us see it's keeping that personal
[1:30:15] relationship that personal Covenant with
[1:30:17] God that personal league with God and
[1:30:19] not allowing yourself to get involved D
[1:30:22] in your will because your will is going
[1:30:25] to take you further away from God and
[1:30:27] here's the thing the devil knows how to
[1:30:29] present to
[1:30:34] you something that looks so much like
[1:30:38] God I'm going to take for for
[1:30:41] instance I grew up and my dad was a a a
[1:30:46] business he he had a
[1:30:49] business and he didn't he went to a like
[1:30:52] a Catholic church and we went there on
[1:30:54] the holidays and that and so I really
[1:30:57] didn't know about God and brother Ron I
[1:31:00] think might have worked for my dad okay
[1:31:03] and so um my dad
[1:31:06] was uh he ran that business the best
[1:31:10] that he he could he could and uh I tell
[1:31:15] you he had me working on Labor
[1:31:19] Day and everybody had Labor Day off
[1:31:22] right and I'm just a kid and I'm working
[1:31:24] there say why are we working on a labor
[1:31:26] day he says it's Labor Day you work on
[1:31:28] Labor
[1:31:30] Day so I said okay Dad so I'm working
[1:31:34] working working away on Labor
[1:31:37] Day but he worked all crazy hours he was
[1:31:42] considered a
[1:31:45] workaholic and and and he worked Sundays
[1:31:47] of course because there was nothing
[1:31:49] there to teach him any different and I
[1:31:50] didn't know I I mean I did my own thing
[1:31:52] on Sundays we certainly didn't go to
[1:31:54] church and you know try to put God
[1:31:59] first so I told my wife as a a for sure
[1:32:04] thing I will never have a business you
[1:32:07] don't ever have to worry I am so against
[1:32:09] having a
[1:32:11] business but you know what
[1:32:15] happened it wasn't even my
[1:32:20] idea it was God's idea
[1:32:24] right the neat thing about it is I still
[1:32:27] walk there knowing it's not
[1:32:30] mine I still walk there walking into his
[1:32:35] place but I made a
[1:32:38] decision I'm going to put work where
[1:32:41] work's at and I'm going to put my family
[1:32:44] where my family needs to be and I'm
[1:32:46] going to put God where God needs to be
[1:32:49] of course I want God in all of them but
[1:32:51] you understand decisions have to be made
[1:32:54] are you going to work Sunday are you
[1:32:55] going to make let your men work Sunday
[1:32:57] are you going to are you going to stay
[1:32:58] up so late um the day before church
[1:33:01] you're going to be
[1:33:03] tired now during all this time at the
[1:33:06] beginning there was there was nothing
[1:33:07] inside of me I never talked to my wife
[1:33:09] about you know maybe someday I'm G to
[1:33:11] like be a
[1:33:13] preacher we never we never had that
[1:33:15] conversation you never heard those words
[1:33:17] come out of my mouth it was just not a
[1:33:19] part of
[1:33:20] me but I wanted to be faithful to what
[1:33:23] God gave me
[1:33:26] amen because he's proven me whether I'm
[1:33:28] still going to put him first while I
[1:33:30] have
[1:33:32] that and what am I going to do with my
[1:33:34] extra
[1:33:36] time I I tell you when I was growing up
[1:33:40] and I was starting to come in I mean you
[1:33:43] had all these different leagues of
[1:33:45] baseball and hockey and all these
[1:33:48] different things you could do and I'll
[1:33:51] tell you
[1:33:52] I love doing all sports not good any but
[1:33:55] I love
[1:33:57] them I love
[1:34:01] them and I tell you I I I with my kids I
[1:34:04] I could have took them all to um all the
[1:34:08] sports made a decision not going to do
[1:34:11] that I I know I may not get liked by
[1:34:14] them when I'm older when they're
[1:34:18] older if they do come into the light
[1:34:20] they'll appreciate it they'll see it
[1:34:24] then but yeah I could have took them to
[1:34:26] all different
[1:34:28] sports I don't want to make a league
[1:34:30] with the
[1:34:33] world and God's you
[1:34:37] know no matter where we're at in our
[1:34:40] age where we're at with our walk with
[1:34:42] the Lord God is still proving
[1:34:45] us he's still proven
[1:34:48] us he wants to see whether we're going
[1:34:50] to stay with him
[1:34:53] keep him first and I'll tell you here's
[1:34:55] the blessing of keeping him first you'll
[1:34:58] be able to destroy your enemy but if we
[1:35:01] don't keep him first we will not be able
[1:35:03] to stand before our enemy he will
[1:35:06] overtake
[1:35:07] us he will he will Cloud us over with
[1:35:13] not the
[1:35:14] ability to walk with the joy of the
[1:35:17] Lord to have the freedom of the spirit
[1:35:20] to be
[1:35:21] that feel set free from
[1:35:26] things and I'm not saying that anything
[1:35:28] that's happening to anybody is because
[1:35:31] of your mistake I would never say that I
[1:35:36] got to ask the Lord all the time but
[1:35:38] myself who am I to judge anybody
[1:35:40] else but this message is for us to to
[1:35:44] check to Humble
[1:35:46] ourselves and to ask God am I uning
[1:35:51] every everything to you am my because
[1:35:53] the promise is if we seek God first all
[1:35:55] the things will be
[1:35:59] added and the enemy will not be able to
[1:36:02] stand in our
[1:36:04] way I I feel if we can be faithful with
[1:36:07] what God's given us in our personal life
[1:36:10] then God can use
[1:36:11] us with other things amen let's Stand
[1:36:15] Together God bless
[1:36:19] you so use what God given
[1:36:25] you don't worry about I'm not real
[1:36:27] gifted it doesn't matter use what you
[1:36:31] got God God is he's the Difference
[1:36:34] Maker he's the Difference Maker when I
[1:36:37] think when I think about the spirit of
[1:36:40] the Lord in our
[1:36:41] church it isn't because we got a great
[1:36:44] preacher and I'll just say this with the
[1:36:47] permission of my wife it is it because
[1:36:49] we've got you know the most amazing
[1:36:50] piano
[1:36:53] player see we say
[1:36:56] Amen but I do believe with all my heart
[1:36:58] God makes up the difference that's
[1:37:01] right and that's all that matters is
[1:37:03] that God makes up the difference
[1:37:05] whatever we're lacking he makes up the
[1:37:07] difference he'll take your o g and he'll
[1:37:10] go destroy 600 of your
[1:37:14] enemies because you're staying with the
[1:37:16] Lord you're staying with him you're
[1:37:18] staying with the
[1:37:20] scriptures
[1:37:21] amen let's bow our our hearts in a word
[1:37:25] of prayer before

[1:38:11] that if we just love you and we work

[1:38:17] purpose like the prophet said you'll
