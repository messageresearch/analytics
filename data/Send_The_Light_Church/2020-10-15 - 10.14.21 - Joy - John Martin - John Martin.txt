TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wasn't able to meet needs but you said in your word that you would do exceedingly above all that we could ask or even think and lord you're a mighty god today and lord as we settle into this part of the service we know that the enemy also wants to be here also wants to come in doubts and fears and confusions and to take your word and kind of twist it god we ask today that you'd come and take control of this surface lord control of every spirit lord we humble ourselves under them your mighty hand and pray that your precious blood would cover us of all of our sins all of our iniquities anything that we've said done or thought lord we put it under the blood today that we might be in unity with you today father i pray that you would have your way as we commit the service to you we ask that you bless the reading of your words to our hearts that you'd give us truly the the revelation and understanding that we need inside lord that we might be stronger that we might be able to combat all the fiery darts of the wicked one we might put on the whole armor of god today lord we give you this service that you may have free will in our lives and we give you the praise for it now for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord how many is glad to finally be in god's house a place where we can receive help and strength from the lord and turn with me if you would to the book of nehemiah if you have your bibles nehemiah chapter 8 we want to entitle the message today as you're turning there joy real simple joy the topic of joy and for a subject battling for joy because it it is a battle the devil is doing everything he can to steal our joy and uh we remember the the message that brother branham gave us about the different worms that ate away at the church and and one of those was joy and we know joy comes from the lord and so the devil is trying to eat that eat that away from us but joy belongs to the people of god amen amen nehemiah chapter 8 starting with verse 1 and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the watergate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel and ezra the priests brought the law before the congregation both men and women and all could hear that all could hear and understand upon the first day of the seventh month and he read therein before the street that was before the watergate from the morning to the midday before the men and the women and those that could understand the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of law and ezra the scribes stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood boy this is where we really need to not articulate but there were scribes and uh levites that um stood with him and here are the names and uh i don't want to butcher them because i'll have to answer to them on the other side so verse 5 and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up and ezra bless the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshipped the lord with their faces to the ground also joshua and ben i and she bia jaimen and acrom akab shabi tia hordija nasita and i'm so sorry the rest of them and the levites calls the people listen to this he calls the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand their reading amen god bless you may be seated praise god for fivefold ministry amen all the people were gathered together they gathered themselves together as one man we can learn a lot in this subject if we could put away our differences and come together in unity just like they did on the day of pentecost that's what they had in common they had in common god i need god they didn't have in common i know this about god right that that's what they had when jesus was uh there and they were trying to see who was the greatest among them remember that he says we're not like that so they learned not to be like that when they came together they were as one man not two not three but as one man one man and one mind of christ one accord god would bless us if we could come together with that mindset now what we have to do is we have to learn to put away the stuff the stuff that bothers us the stuff that the devil uses to naught at us in the message called fellowship brother branham said wouldn't it be marvelous now if the whole group of us here some five or six thousand people whatever the audience is all these people together this afternoon with one accord could come right under the blood could come in one accord come under the blood just like we're under this roof here under the blood of the lord jesus he says what do you think would take place right now he says what do you think would take place he asked a question twice he said why there wouldn't be a feeble person among us in the next five minutes only for being all under the blood not for knowing anything not for knowing the scriptures and being able to quote them knowing the message but by being under this god's blood cleanses me god's blood cleanses my brother god's blood cleanses my sister right here under the blood now if you can get your attitude like that god can do something in our midst brother branham said in the message dr moses and yet when moses come out of the wilderness he said there wasn't a feeble one among them 40 years dr moses if god could do that for them god could do what he did on the day of pentecost is not god the same yesterday today and forever god cannot god bless us we got to do our job to put away the stuff that brings division in our minds in our thoughts in our words i mean we really must have the love of god shed abroad in her heart and ezra and the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood and when he opened the book of the lord all the people stood to their feet with great respect to god's word something about it when they knew the word was coming they just automatically said this is not the word of azeroth this is not the word of nehemiah this is not the word of the levites this is the word of the lord they gave respect see what happens when we come under that place where the blood is here and you believe in the presence of god you're not looking at a man you're not looking at what's at the pulpit you're looking at the spirit of what's speaking to your heart that's almighty god the living word of god amen the bible doesn't say that they were asked to stand right right they all had respect to the word of the lord i'll tell you if there's something that where the church world is lacking in this age is they're losing their respect for god and when i lose my respect for my brother i am losing respect for god you cannot disrespect a human being and respect god and expect your relationship with god to be right he said leave your gift at the altar you go back make things right and then you come and offer your gift to me god expects us to have things right with one another before we try to have a relationship with him and that wasn't in my notes i just know that you cannot respect too much we had that service that'd be a good one just to preach again the devil see when you respect completely the devil can't get in there but when you just only respect a little bit the devil can get in there we're not respecting and ezra blessed the lord the great god the bible says ezra bless the lord did you know you can bless the lord it's not just about the lord blessing you it's about you blessing the lord amen not with your greatness or your abilities but with your humility your adorning your reverence your respect that's how you bless the lord you give respect to the lord that blesses him sometimes we come here and we our attitudes are we just want to you know get more of god up here we need to be working on a relationship right here this is where god's going to meet you he's not going to meet you here he'll meet you in your heart bless the lord i say bless the lord did not david say bless the lord all my soul give god what he's worthy of i'm not used to it brother john it doesn't matter give them start it's got to start somewhere i tell you what the lord to bless you give them some blessings back you want joy bless the lord and all the people answered amen amen bless the lord amen that's what you should be doing is blessing the lord so be it let's bless the lord they lifted up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground why because the word of the lord was coming they were having a worship service not because they wanted to feel good they wanted to hear their favorite song and they just wanted to feel so good about the worship service no they were worshiping because the word was coming forth too often we come to church saints and we divide the worship service with the preaching of the word it's like it's two different things it's like oh i enjoy the worship service but that word you know what i'm saying it's hard to get into it the reason you're worshiping is the word is coming that's why you come to church you can worship anywhere you worship in your car you worship in your home you're coming here to meet with god to hear what god has to say to you that ought to be exciting now if you were going to god's house you'd be pretty excited about what he's going to say to you either that you'd say you know what i can't come over yet i got to take care of some things either way you're going to get excited when you finally get to be in his presence i could understand if this was some some seminary where we come and we learn to say our amends just right we learn to you know what scripture is kind of tied together with other scriptures and we we learn about god up here but we come to get real with god here we allow that word to begin to deal with our heart amen these these people were excited about the word that was going to come forth i'm telling you our worship service shouldn't be something that just that's the exciting part of the service it should prepare us for the word we should be excited about the word and nehemiah ezra and the levites taught the people and gave the sense and caused them to understand what they were reading don't you like making sense of the word who wants a word that's going to be more confusing than before you came in amen god gave us a five-fold ministry for our perfection he gave us a seer called a prophet he's the mouthpiece of god he gave his teachers with patience he gave us apostles and missionaries to establish new works as well as set things in order he gave us evangelists to stir up the fire inside of us amen he gave his shepherds to watch over the flock to defeat us and to to keep us and to see us through as the prophet said so god gave us a fightful ministry to make sense of this message to make sense to make us to understand what well how a christian should live he didn't send a man who didn't live the life and said oh you need to do this no he said a man that could love his enemies that could lay down his life that could turn down money he he sent a man that was so like jesus so we could understand what this book really means now when the people heard the word preached the bible says all the people wept this is no no mistake the gospel ought to squeeze at some point every person's heart and tears should flow i don't believe they were preaching fire and brimstone and trying to make them feel bad i believe that they were so in love with the word of god that that word began to deal with them and caused them to weep because they weren't living up to the word of god you know we want to come to church we want to belong to a church where the word is confirming the life that i'm living is good enough okay i'm going to put god in this box he gets out of that box you know what i'm going to start my own denomination the preaching of the word ought to draw us closer to god so if you want a closer walk i want you to take a humble approach let god deal with your heart if you don't let god deal with your heart something's wrong somewhere the remedy for getting the devil off your back is the same remedy for a closer walk with god it's the same remedy it's the same formula james chapter 4 verse 7. james 4 7 submit yourself therefore to god so you want a closer walk or you want the devil off your back do this right here submit yourself therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you submit to the word don't come to church with a smorgasbord denominational belief i am going to pick and choose what's for me the whole word is for you bring your rake now understand that not every little single thing is exactly what's going on in your life but you take that thing so far that you're missing out what god's really trying to do with your heart we serve a god who's capable of preaching one word and dealing with every heart we're not serving some scholar who can't figure out how to tie his shoes we're serving a god who knows how to deal with our heart how many times have you you you've heard a scripture seen a scripture something was said something was done had nothing to do with what god was speaking to you about that's the god we serve he is capable of dealing with our hearts amen don't make a smorgasbord believer out of yourself now verse 8 9 these are scriptures now that actually define what it means to submit how you submit draw nigh to god and he will draw an eye to you well how do i do that brother john i'm so glad you asked he said cleanse your hands purify your hearts well i feel every day i backslide every day so i would be considered a sinner sometimes i get double minded what to do well i say i need a purifying of the heart so this the scriptures here are speaking about how to get the devil off your back or how to get a closer walk with god be afflicted mourn weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness notice you can be delighted in your flesh which is joy or you can be delighted in the spirit you can be glad and cheerful in your flesh and you can be glad and cheerful in the spirit how to break this down now because the scripture says let your joy be turned to heaviness not god's joy your joy joy is not a gift that he hands out to his favorite children for god is no respecter persons joy is a gift or a fruit of his spirit when you have it when you have god's spirit and you you got god's spirit so you got joy inside you can't separate it you may not about to tap into it for a certain reason god given us time we're going to get into that so if you're willing to battle to keep your flesh dead then joy the joy of the lord should be inside of you but if you do not labor to crucify your flesh do not expect your god's joy to be there let me give you an example here you can be sarcastic you can make fun you can laugh about somebody and you can call it joy but that's just fleshly joy you know some people call it laughter but i'm just gonna for figurative speech because so many times you know i've got joy that's why i'm happy but you can act that way and feel good but it's just a fleshly joy but the joy of the lord would bring great delight in your heart to lay down your life for somebody or to seem other than better yourself not to cut them down not to make fun of them more to make fun of yourself job 20 verse 5 says the trump the triumphanting of the wicked is short but look at this and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment in other words they can experience joy but it's in the flesh oh i'm going to do this one thing i'm going to act this way in front of somebody and then i'm going to go live like this that moment of praying in front of everybody that moment in paying tithes in front of everybody doing your alms before the people well that joy that that just lasts for a moment see the joy of the flesh is just for a moment but we're not talking about that because there's no sustaining power in that fleshly joy cannot endure tests and trials remember when the the word fell on certain ground and they received the word with joy they were shouting they were praising their it was joy they said amen but because there was no deepness in their heart it was more of a surfacy thing after a while they got offended in other words their joy didn't go deep enough the joy that god has for us it's deep it goes it's like a river it's inside of a man it's springing up the joy of the lord can endure every hardship while maintaining a right spirit amen that's what the joy of the lord will do for you brother john you got to break this stuff down we're going to break it down i need to make some statements we need to turn our fleshly joy into heaviness our carnality into the presence of god god is meek the bible tells us this he is lowly he is humble these are just scriptures in the bible and he wants that character to be in us as well isaiah chapter 29 verse 19 says the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord not the proud not the arrogant not to somebody that's got everything figured out the meek the same ones that inherit the earth amen amen so we need to understand if we want joy we need to pay attention right here of how we need to be what's what's wonderful about this is i don't care where you're at what's happening in your life you can turn it around just like that james chapter 4 verse 10 says humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up you know what i've noticed brother is most people want to be lifted up without humbling themselves before the lord we all want to be lifted up but do we want to humble ourselves before the lord we need to take advice from james here humble yourself psalms 30 verse 5 says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning it's a promise if we humble ourselves in the sight of the lord he will lift us up it's a promise we got to believe it we got to confess it we got to stand on it i can't help it that god wants us to humble ourselves it's his rules why get mad at the messenger why why say well you know i just want to come to church and i want to feel so good i know the things i've heard so much about inviting people to church and asking me how about our church and and what they like about their church it's always about the music and how it makes them feel good or how the minister just makes them laugh oh it's like there's no breaking down no breaking down of them they just want to continue to be lifted up in the flesh and they never meet the joy of the lord they never meet what they need to endure nehemiah chapter 10 then nehemiah said unto them go your way eat the fat drink the sweet send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for for this day is holy unto the lord neither be sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength hallelujah neither be sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength now i'm going to tell you if your heart was humble there would be no need to humble yourself you're already where god told you to go other words you're right there ready to receive the joy of the lord and what's important about the joy of the lord it's your strength it's your strength the joy of the lord is your strength our joy is weak it has limitations it can only put up with so much i've had allah that's our joy it's our love it's our joy but the joy of the lord is strong it's limitless its strength can endure the greatest difficulties in our lives and we know that joy is actually a fruit of the holy ghost so if you have the holy ghost you have a portion of god's joy well i'm not feeling it well this is time to do some checkups you know when you go to the dentist and you're going because you're doing your six-month checkup you don't want to go because the chances of them saying your teeth look better than they did six months ago are not very good i'm always hearing have you been flossing john it looks like you need to pick up on the flossing we need to get the the the main dentist in here so he can like look at this area because i got some questions the joy of the lord is our strength we need the joy of the lord a lot of times believers find themselves in a weak state of mind that's right searching for strength to press forward and in reality what they're missing is simply the joy of the lord i'll tell you what provoked this whole message was my precious brother larry honestly yesterday not yesterday but last service brother larry came and it was just like the lord you know speaking to me he said well brother john i sure hope you got a you got an encouraging message for me today i need you i need it and i thought oh lord why do i have to preach this message say my brother needs my brother needs strength and oh it was just a burden on my heart and i was i just felt like lord your people they need to be lifted up encouraged and strengthened got to thinking about the subject the joy of the lord is our strength never underestimate the power of god's joy when jesus faced the greatest trial of his life which we know was he lay down his life for his friends when he faced the greatest trial of his life it was joy that seeded through it was joy that gave him the strength to do that we never want to underestimate the power that there is in the joy of the lord hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 says looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the same and set down the right hand of the throne of god jesus endured death with the joy that was set before him i want you to think about that he endured death with the joy that was set before him he laid down his life for his friends with joy brother sister you do not need anything but the joy of the lord today i don't care what your situation is i don't care what you're going through i don't care what you're facing and what you want to see change what you really need is the joy of the lord in your heart jesus died as a man he did not die as god god cannot die but he he died as a man god became a man to die like a man and it took the joy of the lord to see him through think about it don't underestimate call on the lord humble yourselves do what you got to do to get in the presence of the lord philippians chapter 2 verse 7 but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man what did he do he humbled himself even more and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wow so at this time that he had to actually go and give his life he didn't he was looking for strength in the garden he was praying lord if it's possible let this cup pass from me and he had to pray that like three times because there was a battle going on and he was he was needing joy and god placed in front of him joy hallelujah god placed in front of jesus joy and that joy was you and me he placed our salvation in front of jesus that he could look and know that if he went through this test they would be saved and so often we find ourselves struggling with some situation with some family member somebody at work somebody at church some situation and god god has wanted you to lay down your life that someone can get closer to god you got to put that joy in front of you you got to stop thinking about yourself jesus didn't think about himself he was thinking about others the joy of the lord is your strength it took real strength to do what he did something took place inside of him a real incentive it was the joy of knowing that we would be here on this day in this church listening to this message talking about what he did at calvary [Applause] amen that's how great our god is this is the purpose of god to get all of his family together and he's not done the sacrifice was finished at calvary when he said it but the work that you and i need to be carrying out is not over yet today we got to fit in got to get back to the purpose that god has for us isaiah 53 verse 10 yet it please the lord to bruise him think about this it pleased the father to bruise jesus he put him to grief when thou shall make his soul an offering he shall see his seed for the joy that was set before him he saw his seed and if you could just realize that if you lay down your life for your brother you've got to have a vision that that seed belongs to you you're part of that that's your brother that your sister that's part of the family of god that ought to give you enough to lay down your life problem is you get on the devil's side start judging who's who you go ahead and you finish reading in the book of james it's the very next verse he talks about that we're not supposed to think evil speak evil or judge evil of anybody amen that's anti-humbling yourself which is antichrist brother sister god's joy can give you strength to handle any adversity with out getting a wrong spirit while maintaining a right spirit now you got to understand this as soon as we get the wrong spirit as soon as we get the wrong spirit god is not going to stand there and say i take credit for this brother adam says i this is where i divide my line if i have to choose one of the two i'll take the right spirit you can keep the doctrine because a lot of religious devils will take the doctrine the truth and get so twisted up and send so many people in the wrong direction but a right spirit will always lead you and guide you into all truth so put the emphasis on the spirit that you project out anyone can get psyched up get people to agree with you get so you can feel good about a certain situation but that has not one thing to do with god's strength to turn your cheek or to lay down your life all i got to get we used to have bob bob used to sit here larry he used to sit right in front of his name is bob he was always my example and then brother mark came i i didn't want to say sister sister kathleen i used to use sister kathleen she said no more we can get so thinking we're right about something so strong all i got to get is a few people to agree with me see what i'm doing get so psyched up get the scriptures that we think back up what we're doing and feel like we got it as soon as the trial comes all sudden spirit changes that is not the joy of the lord that's you thinking it's god's joy but it's not it's a fleshly joy the joy of the lord gives you strength to endure all things hey if it can endure giving your life for us after praying three times take this situation away from me how much more ought to do for us when all we got to do is lay down our flesh we don't gotta die on the cross we gotta die to ourself that joy of the lord is what we need in our situations and it's a real thing it's tangible well how i want there to be a front row line of people getting into this we need that brother mike up here the other day when he was getting into the message remember that brother mike he said that's some good preach and he said not nothing to do with the preaching but just the word is this the word we need the joy of the lord the devil don't want you happy he doesn't want you full of joy he doesn't want you to have the strength of the lord the way to get more of god's joy is to get rid of yours and just honestly just say god fill me with your joy get this substitute away from me hebrews chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about what so greater cloud or witnesses let us lay aside every weight well so what's the weight me right i'm in the way lay aside every weight and the unbelief which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that set before us and excuse me as we're running you've got to keep your eyes on the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despised the same as sat down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider this man consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your mind so here the writer to the hebrews is trying to get our focus on considering what jesus went through he didn't even have anybody standing with him he didn't have a parade he didn't have a float he didn't have a group that was with with um you know go republicans go democrats uh he didn't have a committee his own disciples left he was left alone to die on the cross for you and we need the strength of the lord the joy of the lord if we're gonna do that for somebody so consider this man lest you faint in your mind because of what you're going through you think it's too hard for you it is not too hard my god is not a liar he doesn't lie he'll never put anything on you that you cannot bear but will he will make a way of escape and the joy of the lord is your strength i want to read this kind of quick we don't have a lot of time but i think it would be good verse number four let's just pick that up you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten you have forgotten you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children god deals with us in certain ways my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him well you know i'll just have you to say ah you know i know god has never rebuked me never never my god loves me he would never never never say anything to make me feel bad yet it pleased him to bruise jesus he made a flesh went and dwelt in it and then died and you think he's going to cater to your flesh the flesh is enmity with him the way it thinks the way it's pampered he looked at peter and he said satan get behind me thou thou abhorus and now you don't care about the things of god you only care about the things that please man excuse me for paraphrasing that verse but that's just the flesh that's just the flesh nobody wants to suffer i don't want to suffer and i'm not preaching suffering but what i'm telling you there's something greater there's something greater than anything that god allows you to go through and it is the joy of the lord you know if i was listening to this service i'd be shouting hallelujah now if you endure chastening god deal with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastise and everybody wants to be you know what can i say everybody wants to be we're for all our partakers then are ye bastards and not sons furthermore we've had fathers of our flesh who corrected us and gave us reverence and we gave them reverence shall we not much more rather be subject unto the father spirits and live for they very for a few days chasteness after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness how many times have you you got such an attitude towards your mom and dad because they did something you didn't think was fair and i'll have to say there's a lot of innocent people that have gone to prison that's right there's a lot of guilty people that got off the hook things ain't fair life ain't fair yeah our parents probably did spank us and and scold us and yell at us and do a lot of things just for their flesh not god god isn't like that he cares about your character he cares about you becoming him the image of jesus christ he was the firstborn among many brethren you are that brethren you've been predestinated to be in his image this is how we become in his image you know if we never go through trials we'll never find out really where we're at we'll never really know the character we are we'll sit there in the seat thinking that we're something when we're not but when we go through that test and we see where we come short that's god's love that's god's mercy that's god showing you where you're at what you need to do now no chasing for the present seemeth to be joyous no way but grievous nevertheless afterwards it yields the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby isn't that beautiful that's what we have to look forward to god don't do nothing i don't do anything for nothing he's always a purpose wherefore he says now this is for us wherefore lift up your lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight for the pat's paths for your feet lest that which is lame i'm sorry lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently remember our second verse looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness spring up and trouble you and thereby defile many be defiled you take your eyes off jesus this is what happens if i don't believe for the grace of god for bob what good am i what if i got some bitterness springs up about bob before you know it i'm going to tell bob's sister i'm going to defile many why because love is missing love is missing well brother john you don't understand i'm so glad that we got a five-fold ministry to make me understand i'm thankful for revival ministry we can lose our joy for many reasons most if not all are for failing or falling out of a perfect communion with the lord it may not be as drastic as as david when he fell when he messed up yet he followed the correct path back to the lord he humbled himself before the lord and it's the correct and precise path to the joy of the lord is to humble yourself now we don't got time to read it but he starts out talking about his sin and what he did he and his sin he only sinned against the lord and then he gets into his his prayer there and he's talking about you know i've been a sinner from my from my birth his whole life and he just wanted the joy of the lord back he wanted that fellowship back with the lord he said in psalms 51 verse 8 make me to hear joy and gladness verse 12 restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit there's a lot of things that can zap our joy the spirit of worldliness the things of the world iniquities not doing the things that we know we should be doing because he told us already remaining faithful at what he has spoken to you things can zap the joy out because that grieves the lord how we can act we've got to remain connected to the holy ghost for communion and fellowship john chapter 15 let's turn there let's see if we can get through this because i'll tell you if we can get this under the microscope here we don't have to be looking for temporary things to make us happy i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me uh that beareth not fruit is taken away and every branch that bear fruit he purges it that he may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me abide in the word that i've given you i've already cleansed you i've already washed you and you're cleaned by the word now it's up to you to abide in that word and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me i want the joy of the lord bubbling out of me i have a responsibility to stay connected to the word all the word you got a big 55 gallon drum it only takes one little hole for all of it to leak out so why talk about all this other area of this drum that's so perfectly sealed we need to talk about the one area that god wants us to take care of and i don't know what that is it's up to you to find out look it i got my own problems finding out where they're at i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing i cannot get the joy of the lord without the holy ghost if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you what a promise from god amen but we gotta abide in him we gotta have his word abide in us praise the lord herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples as the father have loved me so i have loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy my joy might remain in you god holds the string of his joy in you we want joy joy comes from the lord and he's given us these precious words and i know it's running late but these words say i'm telling you all this today is so that my joy might remain in you so you're not questioning what happened why is this why do i feel like why is it a struggle why am i why do i feel so down it's written here if we care enough i'll tell you this god has not failed one person he has not fallen asleep and forgotten oh yeah this person needed joy i should have gave it to him but i messed up hopefully he'll forgive me god don't mess up god don't come short we mess up we come short and we've got to humble ourselves to find out where we did mess up where we did come short these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain with you and that your joy might be full now why is this so important this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love have no men than this and a man lay down his life for his friends and ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you it's a pretty well clear package right there what we need to do praise the lord these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain with you and that your joy might be full the only way that your joy is going to be full is with god's joy your joy is you may have joy for a moment because you're on the greatest ride at cedar point or you're listening to your favorite song or somebody just put you up on a pedestal but after a while it's not really full but when you get full of god's joy when the pedestal is gone the ride is done and you're there's a need with your brother you're right they're laying down your life still filled with the same joy hallelujah our joy is only partial remember that god's joy is full in every trial how many want more joy into the presence of god labor in prayer psalms 16 verse 11 thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is the fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore so where is god's joy in his presence that's why the fruit of the spirit is joy one of the fruit of the spirits is joy because the holy ghost is his presence i mean and if we're feeling like something's separating brother brethren talk to us about that holy spirit just going kind of sitting there waiting for what waiting for something to change with us now look all we got to do is want it so bad that we're willing to humble ourself call on the lord god fill me with you i want to be filled with your presence get shed this flesh shed it god inhabits the praises of his people we ought to be laboring much harder than we do to enter into his presence we come in if we hard for us to say amen to something brother ron saying about the song or something he's saying between songs what's what's happening i don't feel like it i don't feel led of the lord look friend i don't feel like laboring but i need to labor if you really want to joy the lord you're going to have to labor you have to labor to enter into his presence because in his presence is the fullness of joy amen god is a rewarder of them that diligently seek his presence psalms 27 verse 6 therefore while i offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of joy i ain't got time to do it but if you want to read it sometime in verse 28 not verse 28 deuteronomy chapter 28 will find you'll find in there that god promised that he would bless his people if they would keep his commandments and he would make them the head and not the tale but he says if you didn't then you would be cursed in other words there is no switzerland with god there's no neutral you're either being blessed or you're being cursed with him but this is what he said he said because you did not serve me with joy and gladness i will curse you that's strong we can't serve god half-heartedly he wants us to put our heart into it god loves a cheerful giver he wants something that's going to come in this tabernacle and offer sacrifices of joy and praise and enter into his gates the right way not the way we feel not our carnal way psalms 63 verse 5 my mouth shall fill thee with joy shall praise thee with joyful lips my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips not i am for the promised land these lips need to be showing some joy psalms 95 1 oh come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to what the rock of our salvation well brother john i just don't feel like it you know what you're doing you're just expressing to me where you're at with the lord you've got to labor to enter into his presence psalms not psalms isaiah chapter 40 we're not going to have time to get through everything but god help us to get through what you want us to get through today isaiah chapter 40 verse 28 has thou not known has thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary in other words god is not missing anything [Laughter] god is not sitting here searching oh i wish i had this [Music] there's no searching of his understanding and he giveth power to us he giveth power to us to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as he they shall run and not be worthy they shall walk and not faint the reward of waiting in prayer is renewed joy renewed strength that's the reward of waiting on the lord in prayer well brother john it's really hard there is no other avenue jesus said when i come shall i find faith on the earth it's getting worse and worse in this world i read that verse i didn't know anything about colvin 19. it's just getting worse jesus gave us a parable when he told us about that the the the widow the persistent widdle and it was a prayer to this end that men ought to always pray amen and not faint well brother john the reason i'm feigning right now is because my boss he punched me no you're fainting because you have not taken that punch and got on your knees to get a hold of god though he slayed me yet well i trust him it's not what you're going through you don't have to describe to me how this great trial that you're going through is so hard what i want you to do is stand up here and testify about the joy of the lord that's what i want you to do get into the presence of god let the presence of god be so strong inside of you it'll take you through friends in his presence is fullness of joy fullness of joy in his presence why aren't we well brother john i just don't feel like doing it okay but don't blame the preacher because he's not preaching right don't blame your boss who punched you don't don't blame your brother who didn't shake your hand you know i'm not saying nothing about you i'm leaving you for sunday we're taking turns sometimes bob sometimes you god has made a way for us to receive strength we don't need a caffeine pick-me-upper we need somebody to encourage us and help us and make us feel good that's that only helps for a short a short period of time and and i'm not against things like that but i'm against living on that you can't live on that but you can live on the joy of the lord when you have that you have strength to go through anything i'm telling you his strength is the same yesterday today and forever his strength isn't going to disappear unless you decide to get dispatched to something he's commanded you to do and he might have commanded you to do something you don't want to do friends maybe we've just been a little bit picky that's good good smorgasbord a smorgasbord can't get picky man shall not live by pickiness but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god you know a lot of times we're not really hearing from the lord the way we should because we've got so used to coming to church and feeling i did my duty and it never personally connects but that personal connection is so important because if you don't get it you'll never carry it out you'll never get the joy of the lord god is trying to take us somewhere just a couple more minutes first peter chapter one verse three verse nine what what i don't like about this is at the end these are all the good scriptures and things and the the ones that are encouraging first peter chapter one starting with verse number three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which have which according to his abundant mercy have begotten us onto a lively hope by the resurrection jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that faith not await reserved in heaven for you now isn't that exciting i'll tell you i'll say about any believer you know would get excited about that scripture who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the peering of jesus christ now who are we to say to the potter i don't need what i'm going through right now if need be well who determines that god does god determines that whom having not seen ye love praise god in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with a joy that's so unspeakable and full of glory amen it's so full of glory joy i can't even talk about it it just i i just laid on my life i step on me i lay down my life again they step on me i lay down my life again they step on me but it's joy unspeakable and that's what the joy of the lord is it's not you being happy when you get what you want when you want how you want it as long as you're being treated good it's about laying down your life for the purpose of god god gave you joy for why did why did god tell his disciples you wait jerusalem to you getting deal with power from on high why because if god sent them out to go do something first little persecution they would get they would go run and so you know they they were unfair when you get the joy of the lord you can sit in prison and praise god with chains when you get the joy of the lord you can go through what you're going through and still lay down your life because when they were in prison they wanted to save that jailer because there was a chance they weren't wanting to get back they were wanting to get back to those that threw him in prison and they weren't wanting to run they went right back to the pulpit and began to preach the same word that god gave them that's what the joy the lord will do for you now the joy our joy doesn't do that our joy is only good for a little bit all joy is you know that you go and do something that's real fun after a while it's gone come on you want me to be human with you be human with me be honest with me you know we're looking for something that can only come from god the joy of the lord is exactly what it is it's the joy of the lord it's not you practicing your joy practicing your strength it's you getting yourself out of the way getting into his presence and when god's presence come your strength is renewed you can march forward just like jesus did in the garden think about it when reviled against he revowed not back because he had joy when he was threatened he didn't try to get back at him because it was the joy of the lord our joy it's only for a season you get filled with god's joy and i'm telling you your life will turn around you will have so much time to do the work of the lord amen amen brother john amen stand together in closing in your battle for joy you don't need anyone to be your personal caffeine of joy you don't need a fleshly pick-me-upper all you need to do is humble yourself and spend time praying into his presence now i'm saying it just like it is praying into his presence because when we start praying we're not in his presence we're outside of it but you stay there he'll come because he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him yeah the flesh doesn't want to do this but we know this is the answer to getting joy once that joy comes you talk about hallelujah it's all about living on the hallelujah side amen amen let's bow our hearts our dear heavenly father we thank you for providing a strength for us when the only thing that can take us through is the joy of the lord we thank you that you put it all in our reach you're no respecter persons whether we're the worst sinner in the world or the so close to you you still require us to wait upon you lord i pray for every believer here every believer that's listening i pray lord that you would instill within each of us this one thought of humbling ourselves waiting upon you that your presence could come and just take care of our situations lord you might want us to wait it might be something that can't be fixed in a moment that's why your joy is strength it's strength to endure strength to keep running when all other flesh would just stop the race lord we're keeping our eyes on you bring these thoughts to our remembrance when the battle gets tough and we don't know what to do who to turn to what to say lord would you just remind us to enter into your presence i believe you have joy waiting for every one of us lord joy that is so unspeakable full of glory we can't even explain it because it's so powerful bless each of us lord as we commit ourselves to you we thank you for your precious word tonight in jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen let's sing that magnify the lord oh magnify huh how's that going oh the lord for he is worthy to be prayed o magnify the lord for he is worthy to be prayed
