[1:48] prayer and just invite the author just
[1:50] to reveal his word to us
[1:53] dear Lord Jesus we uh just thank you for
[1:55] this gracious moment Lord truly know as

[2:22] I pray you give them guidance Lord and
[2:24] just bless each Soul here today bless
[2:27] each Soul that's in the live stream Lord
[2:28] and once again Lord we want to you to
[2:31] have preeminence Lord just take your
[2:33] control Lord just send your Holy Spirit
[2:34] Lord and this bless the remainder of the
[2:37] service
[2:38] we ask all these things in Jesus Christ
[2:40] and we pray amen I'd like this to open
[2:43] up in the Book of Psalms and we'll go
[2:46] from we'll go to verse uh Psalms chapter
[2:49] 29 verses 1 through 2.
[2:51] so Psalms 29 verses 1 through 2.
[2:55] please say Amen when you get there
[3:00] so we'll start at verse one
[3:02] give unto the Lord O ye Mighty give unto
[3:06] the Lord glory and strength verse 2 give
[3:10] unto the Lord the glory due unto his
[3:15] name says Worship the Lord in the beauty
[3:18] of holiness
[3:21] may the Lord has had the blessings upon
[3:23] his word you may be seated
[3:25] so I looked that word up Holiness I was
[3:27] just curious so it's sacredness the
[3:30] state of anything hollowed or
[3:32] consecrated to God or to his worship
[3:35] applied to churches or temples that
[3:39] which is separated to the service of God
[3:41] now you don't have to worship God just
[3:43] to be in church but you can worship God
[3:45] in your homes in your cars at your job
[3:48] so a lot of times we kind of just think
[3:50] worship is here at the church but
[3:52] worship is a life it's an everyday thing
[3:54] it's not just something you just put on
[3:56] Wednesdays and Sundays and leave it here
[3:58] but it's something that has to be taken
[4:00] with you is something that comes deep
[4:02] within the heart and so I always loved
[4:05] that song uh How Great Thou Art I just
[4:08] read the lyrics oh Lord my God when I an
[4:11] awesome Wonder consider all the worlds
[4:13] thy hands have made so we're just
[4:15] thinking about that you're just
[4:16] recognizing how Mighty of a God that we
[4:18] serve and how holy he is says I see the
[4:21] stars I hear The Rolling Thunders thy
[4:24] power throughout the Universe displays
[4:26] now I love this part then sings my soul
[4:28] not just the mouth but deep within your
[4:30] heart sings my soul my savior God to
[4:34] thee how great thou are how great thou
[4:37] are so I just love that when we sing
[4:39] these songs to God has to come from deep
[4:42] within we can't just be singing the
[4:44] screens off the word but the words have
[4:46] to mean something so deep as you just
[4:48] sing the songs back to God and that's
[4:51] what true worship is because you're not
[4:52] just singing to sing but you're singing
[4:54] Because you know that you're meeting
[4:56] with God at this very moment let's go to
[4:59] First Peter chapter one and reverses 15
[5:02] through 16.
[5:13] so we saw reverse 15.
[5:15] but as he which has called you is Holy
[5:18] so how many believe that they've been
[5:19] called by God this morning
[5:21] amen amen
[5:22] so be holy in all manner of conversation
[5:26] so it's so important see
[5:29] worse like I said before that's a that's
[5:32] a form of worship how we conduct how we
[5:34] live our lives how people see us is uh
[5:37] is going to be a direct reflection of
[5:39] our Lord Jesus Christ so if we're
[5:41] bringing a bad example to that that
[5:44] we're not worshiping God at that moment
[5:46] if we're just letting any little things
[5:47] slide in our life we have to set a
[5:49] standard see when you worship you're
[5:51] setting a standard that this is how God
[5:54] is calling me to live this is how much I
[5:56] love God so we'll go to verse 16 but it
[6:00] is written be holy for I am Holy another
[6:03] way to learn Holiness is to get more
[6:06] intimate and deep with God because he is
[6:09] the definition of Holiness if you
[6:11] remember reading in the book of uh in
[6:13] the Old Testament when he's on that
[6:15] mountain that not even an animal can
[6:17] touch him can touch that mountain I
[6:19] should say and he still as holy as that
[6:21] today and he still deserves our respect
[6:24] our reverence our praise our honor our
[6:27] adoration so he deserves all these
[6:29] things and we can get in that channel of
[6:31] that we can get into the Holiness of God
[6:34] and he'll teach us how to be holy
[6:37] amen uh there's a a 1955 October 2nd may
[6:42] we worship thee in spirit and in truth
[6:44] so notice he is separated spirit and in
[6:47] truth so something that we both have to
[6:49] do both of these things because we can
[6:51] just Worship in the spirit but not have
[6:53] the truth and we can just have the truth
[6:54] and I have the spirit but when both of
[6:56] those come together that's the type of
[6:59] worship God is looking for in each one
[7:00] of our lives
[7:02] says in the beauty of Holiness may we
[7:06] live every day so this is something that
[7:08] we can attain something we can uh go for
[7:11] go towards for because each day is a
[7:13] brand new day it says not noticing what
[7:15] the world's got to say about it so we
[7:17] don't care what X Y and Z of the news
[7:19] says about it but we care what the Lord
[7:21] says what his standards are because as
[7:24] his ways are his ways are not our ways
[7:26] and his thoughts are not our thoughts
[7:27] and says but what you say about it Lord
[7:29] grant it so I looked up the word worship
[7:32] says to adore to pay to pay Divine
[7:36] honors to to reverence with Supreme I
[7:40] love that respect and variation so I
[7:43] love that to reverence what Supreme
[7:45] respect so it's not just a regular kind
[7:47] of respect but it's a a a fear of the
[7:49] Lord type of respect
[7:51] and so I looked the word of veneration
[7:53] so it's the highest degree of respect
[7:56] and reverence respect mingled with some
[7:59] degree of awe a feeling or a sentiment
[8:02] excited by the dignity
[8:05] of a person or by the sacredness of his
[8:08] character and with regard to place by
[8:10] its so just think about that when you
[8:13] look at respect in a different way when
[8:15] you're trying to we're in worshiping God
[8:16] there's something so different than a
[8:18] it's a regular kind of respect because
[8:20] you're just paying your respect to God
[8:23] because just thinking about what he's
[8:24] done for you what he's going to do and
[8:26] just all the things that he's taking you
[8:28] through this should bring us to our
[8:29] knees and to say well I love you Lord I
[8:31] worship you Lord
[8:33] and look at one more definition of
[8:35] worship says to honor with extravagant
[8:37] love and extreme submission so when
[8:41] you're worshiping God you are
[8:43] surrendering yourself to him you're
[8:45] bowing down before him under his mighty
[8:47] hand and it says as a lover
[8:49] and it says see we we got to realize
[8:51] that worship is something is intimate
[8:53] something that's between you and God not
[8:56] you God in the pastor or you God and
[8:58] brother Mark or you got him brother Ron
[9:00] but it's you and God it's just you too
[9:02] it's a straight and narrow for a reason
[9:04] there's only room for you and for God so
[9:06] we got to recognize that that's what
[9:08] that that interests me God intimacy God
[9:10] is looking for
[9:11] and the thing is true worship has to
[9:15] come from the heart it can't just come
[9:16] from lip motions but it has to come deep
[9:19] within the heart that's where it comes
[9:21] from
[9:22] it says when we come to worship him
[9:23] we're forgetting about ourselves and
[9:26] we're just concentrating on him
[9:28] and he needs to become the main focal
[9:31] point of our life at all times not just
[9:33] when we want to make him a focal point
[9:35] when we need him but we need God in all
[9:37] aspects of our life no matter what we're
[9:39] going through whether it's good times or
[9:40] bad times we need to make that a
[9:42] standard in our life
[9:44] so intimate is in most inward internal
[9:48] so intimate something that's in here see
[9:51] intimacy the word entity is close
[9:53] familiarity or Fellowship nearness and
[9:56] friendship remember in John 15 Hal says
[9:59] uh let's go to John 15 a little set in
[10:01] the notes but
[10:02] it's okay
[10:04] so John 15 and we'll just uh read verse
[10:07] 14. it says ye are my friends if you do
[10:11] whatsoever I command you so just think
[10:14] about that and if we go above it says if
[10:17] you keep my Commandments you shall abide
[10:18] in my love so I being obedient to God I
[10:22] believe is a form of worship as well
[10:24] because that's how you enter into that
[10:26] love that he is uh that he wants to give
[10:29] us and we when we get that love we can
[10:31] love him back with that same love that
[10:33] he loves us with and that's worship
[10:36] right there
[10:37] amen
[10:38] so I I know that I believe the Lord is
[10:40] constantly calling us to a higher more
[10:43] intimate worship the closer more the
[10:45] closer we get to God the more is
[10:47] expected out of us because we're we're
[10:49] reaching a higher maturity just like
[10:51] when you're raising your kids you
[10:53] expected a lot more out of them uh when
[10:56] they were 15 when they compared when
[10:58] they're five years old so the same thing
[11:00] in our walk with the Lord the older that
[11:02] we get the more that it's expected out
[11:04] of us the more we have to labor into his
[11:06] presence because he's given us so much
[11:09] more Revelation than he did five years
[11:11] ago or six months ago and so he's
[11:13] expecting a lot out of us
[11:16] amen so let's go to Romans 12.
[11:21] and we'll start with reverses uh one
[11:23] through three
[11:32] so the the title of the sermon is My
[11:34] Worship belongs to you before I forget
[11:36] to say that and so our worship should
[11:38] always belong to him no matter what
[11:41] I just that simple statement this this
[11:44] thing about that just put yourself in
[11:45] there that your worship belongs to him
[11:47] he's worthy of that
[11:49] so let's go to Romans 12 and start with
[11:52] verse 1. so I beseech you therefore
[11:54] Brethren by the mercies of God that ye
[11:58] presents your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[12:02] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[12:06] your reasonable service and we will
[12:08] present that to God that's worship
[12:11] because you're not it's not your body
[12:13] it's not your life anymore but you're
[12:15] giving it on to him and say Lord let
[12:17] your perfect will be done in my life no
[12:19] matter what Storms Come this is yours
[12:22] I'm Yours
[12:24] verse 2 and be not conformed to this
[12:28] world but be transformed by the by the
[12:31] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[12:34] what is that good and acceptable and
[12:37] perfect will of God
[12:39] for I say to the grace which is given
[12:41] unto me every man that is among you not
[12:43] to think of himself more highly than you
[12:45] ought to think but to think soberly
[12:47] according as God had dealt to every man
[12:50] The Measure of Faith so we got to
[12:52] realize where everything that we have
[12:54] comes from it comes from him
[12:57] our health our jobs our house our family
[12:59] everything comes from God he's the
[13:02] source of it all and if he lifted his
[13:04] hand off of it we see what happened to
[13:05] job when God did that and look at all
[13:08] the things that began to happen so
[13:10] sometimes we don't recognize the
[13:12] blessings that God has given us all that
[13:14] we have and I think a lot of times
[13:16] that's how we get in the Rut of not
[13:18] being grateful gratitude kind of slips
[13:20] away because we forget where everything
[13:22] comes from where sometimes we look at
[13:24] we're looking for things that we don't
[13:26] have instead of just thinking the Lord
[13:27] for the things we already have and so
[13:30] gratitude is so key in a believer's walk
[13:32] it helps it helps you not to murmur and
[13:35] complain because we murmur and complain
[13:36] because we we kind of put the Gratitude
[13:39] off to the side and so the more grateful
[13:41] we can be the less complaining that we
[13:43] will do in our lives amen
[13:46] so let's go to Psalms 103.
[13:52] how many loves the word this morning
[13:54] amen
[13:57] don't be scared to pull on the word it's
[13:59] his word not my word
[14:02] so we'll go to verse one
[14:05] says bless the Lord O My Soul notice
[14:09] that that inward deepness in all that is
[14:13] within me so not just partialities not
[14:15] just part but all that was Within Me
[14:18] bless His holy name bless the Lord O my
[14:22] soul and forget not all his benefits
[14:24] will keep going actually so we'll see
[14:26] the benefits that we get from serving
[14:29] the Mighty God that we serve so who
[14:32] forgiveth all thy iniquities not not
[14:34] just some but all who healeth all thy
[14:37] diseases see we serve a god see when God
[14:40] does something he puts everything into
[14:42] it see a lot of times we like to just
[14:44] put something we'll pray we'll I'll put
[14:46] a little bit in here and a little bit
[14:47] there but when God does something he
[14:50] puts everything he created the world he
[14:52] put everything into it all his heart
[14:54] everything his word and I believe we
[14:57] need to be just like that when we pray
[15:00] put everything you have into when you
[15:01] read put everything you have into we
[15:03] listen to message to the hour put
[15:04] everything you have into it when you
[15:06] come to worship God and sing songs as I
[15:09] am put everything that you have into it
[15:12] no matter how you're feeling no matter
[15:13] the circumstances in life because the
[15:16] circumstances in life shouldn't affect
[15:18] how you praise and worship God how you
[15:20] pull on the word when you read you
[15:23] shouldn't let that affect you because
[15:24] we've come too far to let that affect us
[15:26] we reached uh such a high maturity to
[15:30] let that affect our walk with God verse
[15:33] 4 who redeemeth thy life from
[15:35] destruction who crowneth thee with
[15:38] loving kindness that means like grace
[15:39] and favor and Tender Mercies who
[15:43] satisfies thy mouth with good things so
[15:46] that youth is renewed like the eagles
[15:49] he said lay that wait upon the Lord that
[15:51] scripture the Lord executed
[15:53] righteousness and judgment for all that
[15:56] are oppressed he made known his ways
[15:58] unto Moses and he's still making his
[16:01] ways known unto us today
[16:04] his acts unto the children of Israel the
[16:07] Lord is merciful
[16:09] gracious and slow to anger and
[16:12] plentiness and mercy he will not always
[16:15] shine neither will he keep his anger
[16:17] forever
[16:18] he hath not dealt with us after our sins
[16:21] nor rewarded us according to our
[16:23] iniquities one more verse for as the
[16:25] heavens is high above the Earth so Grace
[16:27] is his Mercy toward them that fear him
[16:31] so just the importance of the fear of
[16:33] the Lord that reverence and respect to
[16:35] him that's what God is looking for as a
[16:37] Believer who could just give him
[16:39] reverence respect and adoration that's
[16:41] all God is looking for
[16:44] amen let's keep going we'll go to habaka
[16:47] 3 17-9
[16:53] pastor
[17:10] always have trouble finding that
[17:11] scripture I don't know why
[17:14] so three of them go 17 through 19. so it
[17:18] says although the Fig Tree shall not
[17:20] blossom neither shall the fruit be in
[17:22] the vines the labor of the olive shall
[17:24] fail and the field shall yield no meat
[17:26] the flock shall be cut off from the fold
[17:28] and there shall be no herd in the stall
[17:30] so we can say we lose our job we lose
[17:33] our home everything's going wrong your
[17:35] family doesn't like you and look what he
[17:38] says right here yet I will rejoice in
[17:40] the Lord
[17:41] I will joy in the god of my salvation so
[17:44] the thing is you can't let the
[17:45] circumstances of Life control
[17:49] the way you're serving God because it's
[17:51] we get in such a habit of doing that and
[17:53] I'm guilty of it too so I put myself
[17:55] right there but we got to get in such a
[17:57] a place where we're not going to let
[17:59] that happen like we said before we're
[18:00] going to set that standard that that's
[18:02] not going to happen anymore because
[18:03] these things don't happen by accident
[18:05] God knew these things are going to
[18:07] happen it's a test and trial when you're
[18:10] taking a math test or a midterm whatever
[18:12] you want to say and you didn't study
[18:14] enough and you fail you gotta retake it
[18:16] again so God is trying to test us he's
[18:19] trying to build uh to build something
[18:22] that he sees inside of us he's trying to
[18:24] mold us and shape us to refine us like a
[18:27] diamond as we heard
[18:30] so let's keep going the Lord God is my
[18:32] strength notice that so you got to
[18:34] realize that he's my strength he's my
[18:36] rock he's my strong tower he's my
[18:38] deliverer he's my healer so God has to
[18:41] be personal to you and all these things
[18:43] in all these ways and if we recognize
[18:45] that he's all those things to us then we
[18:48] have no reason to fear we have no reason
[18:50] to doubt or to worry
[18:52] amen and he will make my feet like Heinz
[18:56] feet and he will make me to walk upon my
[18:58] high places to the chief singer of my
[19:01] string instruments amen so look the word
[19:03] up Joy is a Perpetual gladness of the
[19:06] heart that comes from knowing
[19:09] experiencing and trusting Jesus
[19:12] and then with that note we'll go to John
[19:14] 15 and read verses 10 through 12.
[19:19] you want to just kind of just because
[19:21] happiness see happiness is based upon
[19:24] the circumstances of life
[19:26] but joy isn't based upon circumstance of
[19:29] what's going on see Joy doesn't see the
[19:32] circumstances Joy knows that its
[19:35] strength comes from God so the joy of
[19:37] the Lord is my strength as it says in
[19:39] Nehemiah 8 10. so and we'll go to John
[19:42] 15 reverses 10 through 12. so it says
[19:45] if you keep my Commandments you shall
[19:47] abide in my love even as I have kept my
[19:50] father's Commandments in abide in his
[19:52] love Luke verse 11 says these things
[19:54] have I spoken unto you that my joy might
[19:57] remain in you that your joy might be
[20:00] fulfilled this is my commandment that
[20:02] you have loved one another as I have
[20:04] loved you so we just see that
[20:06] a lot of time we can lose our joy
[20:08] sometimes
[20:09] and remember what David said he never
[20:11] lost his salvation but he said restore
[20:13] unto me the joy of thy salvation so
[20:17] sometimes life can just get to us it
[20:19] brings us down but we see that uh the
[20:22] righteous footsteps is order of the lord
[20:23] we even see if a righteous man fall
[20:25] seven times he gets back up so sometimes
[20:28] we just need that renewing that's why I
[20:30] love that scripture they that wait upon
[20:32] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[20:34] shallow with wings as eagles they shall
[20:36] walk and not Faith they shall run and
[20:38] not be weary and so sometimes we got to
[20:40] just go into the holies of the holiest
[20:42] and just get that refreshing get that
[20:45] renewing that we need sometimes
[20:48] so but we see that what Jesus said in
[20:50] verse 11 just that that your joy might
[20:52] remain but we see in verse 10 we got to
[20:54] be keeping his Commandments we got to be
[20:56] obedient to him sometimes we we want
[20:58] things from the Lord but we're not being
[21:00] obedient to them we're not following
[21:01] what he's called us to do and so you
[21:04] can't have the cart before the horse you
[21:05] gotta follow it God has made it God said
[21:08] in Simplicity sometimes we make it so
[21:10] hard we got if he says if you keep my
[21:12] Commandments you shall abide in my love
[21:14] and that's something not just doing it
[21:16] carnally but it's an intimate keeping
[21:18] his Commandments amen so like we said
[21:21] before happiness is based upon
[21:23] circumstances but joy it will stay if
[21:26] it's from the Lord it has to stay
[21:28] so we uh Nehemiah 8 10 then he said unto
[21:31] them go your way eat the fat and drink
[21:34] the sweet and send portions unto them
[21:36] for whom nothing is prepared for this
[21:38] day is Holy unto the Lord
[21:40] neither be sorry for the joy of the Lord
[21:43] is your strength that's what your
[21:45] strength right there is you can't
[21:47] substitute it you can't compromise with
[21:49] it if you want that strength in that Joy
[21:51] you have to get it from the one who is a
[21:54] supplier of it and God is the only
[21:55] supplier simple as that cut and dry
[21:58] amen let's go to um
[22:02] Colossians 3 16.
[22:06] sorry
[22:08] Colossians 3 16.
[22:18] well we're going there well um I read a
[22:19] little quote this is from Jehovah of
[22:22] Miracles 1959 11 26 brother Brandon
[22:25] saying the statement right here
[22:27] one to what
[22:29] praise the Lord praise the Lord the joy
[22:31] of the Lord is our strength that's our
[22:33] strength that's how we live it's by the
[22:36] joy of the Lord that's in our midst so
[22:38] let's just never forget that so verse 16
[22:41] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[22:43] richly in all wisdom so remember last uh
[22:46] Sunday brother John said we got to
[22:48] submit to the word so and that's a form
[22:51] of worship when you're submitting to the
[22:53] word you're you're worshiping God
[22:55] because God and His word are one and the
[22:57] same so it says let the word of Christ
[22:59] dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[23:01] teaching and admonishing one another in
[23:04] Psalms and hymns in spiritual songs
[23:06] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[23:08] Lord see when we're singing to the Lord
[23:10] you're constantly putting him where he
[23:12] needs to be which is first place you're
[23:14] thinking about him you're meditating
[23:15] upon him in his word and that's how you
[23:17] you stay in worship is always
[23:19] surrounding yourself with Jesus Christ
[23:23] like that song we sung all that I think
[23:26] say and do all to be pleasing to the
[23:28] Lord
[23:29] so I looked up the word uh worship and
[23:31] praise because a lot of times we kind of
[23:33] just group it together you know we just
[23:34] mix it together but they're different
[23:37] so I looked up I got a couple
[23:38] definitions so worship is an expression
[23:41] of adoration and reverence it's reserved
[23:45] for God only notice that so we'll read
[23:48] in Exodus 23 you want to turn there Thou
[23:50] shalt have no other gods before me so
[23:52] anytime we put anything that we put
[23:54] before God is an idol as brother Branham
[23:57] said and so we can't put anything in
[23:59] front of God
[24:01] and we'll go to uh then we'll go to
[24:02] Exodus 30 14 for thou shall not worship
[24:05] no other God for the Lord whose name is
[24:08] jealous he's a jealous God so when
[24:10] worshiping a person submits himself
[24:13] completely before God see there's no
[24:15] partial submission it has to be a full
[24:18] submission
[24:19] it is a stance of humility and surrender
[24:23] in his position a person can align
[24:25] himself with God's will the Bible tells
[24:28] us to Worship in the spirit and in the
[24:30] truth so worship is different than
[24:32] praise in the Hebrew word uh it means to
[24:36] bow down to lower yourself worship is
[24:39] humbling ourselves before a holy God
[24:41] it's surrendering our entire life to him
[24:45] and then we go with praise is an
[24:48] acknowledgment and appreciation of what
[24:49] God has done for us and we give an
[24:51] example of we when I'm when uh God uh
[24:55] opened the Red Sea and the Israelites
[24:57] got before that and then Egyptians went
[24:59] in and God just drowned them and marry
[25:02] him and they were praising God they were
[25:04] just lifting up Praises but right after
[25:06] that when the water was bitter they
[25:08] started to complain see that that praise
[25:11] left they didn't have any worship and so
[25:13] it's easy to praise God when
[25:15] everything's going good when all the
[25:17] bills are paid when when uh everything's
[25:19] going good but
[25:21] worship has to come in then so it says
[25:24] so praise is acknowledgment and
[25:27] appreciation of what he's done for us
[25:28] it's our way of giving thanks to him God
[25:31] is worthy of our praise and we praise
[25:33] God we're saying he's worthy of our
[25:35] attention and Applause when we sing
[25:37] joy-filled songs of praises to God we
[25:40] recount all that he's done for us we
[25:42] thank him and show our appreciation for
[25:44] his work in our lives and we're
[25:46] acknowledging all the wonderful things
[25:48] God has done for us so we got to do both
[25:51] we can't we got to do we got to worship
[25:52] and praise because they they do go
[25:54] together but it's worship and praise so
[25:57] we got to do both of them just like
[25:58] spirit and in truth we can't just do one
[26:01] or the other we got to do both because
[26:03] they go hand in hand
[26:05] so he said before submission to the word
[26:07] is a form of worship because you are
[26:10] putting the Lord in his proper place
[26:12] which is number one and when we put him
[26:14] number one we are showing him how much
[26:16] we love him how much we adore him and
[26:19] how much we cannot live without him
[26:22] see a lot of times we like we said
[26:24] before we let our life situation get in
[26:26] the way of our worship to God we let the
[26:28] fiery Trials come in and just just tear
[26:31] us up
[26:32] and when we do that we we take our eyes
[26:34] off of Jesus Christ see we've got to
[26:36] keep our eyes on Jesus Christ during the
[26:38] trial because it'll make your trial that
[26:42] you'll recognize why the trial is there
[26:45] sometimes we have to encourage ourselves
[26:48] in the word take a look and see what the
[26:50] Lord says about you how much he loves
[26:53] you and cares about you how much he
[26:55] wants to strengthen you and give you Joy
[26:57] it's this song I like it it's called
[26:59] like encourage yourself I just read some
[27:00] of the lyrics from it says sometimes you
[27:03] have to encourage yourself
[27:04] sometimes you have to speak victory
[27:07] during the test no matter how you feel
[27:10] speak the word and you will be healed
[27:13] speak over yourself encourage yourself
[27:16] in the Lord sometimes you have to speak
[27:19] the word over yourself the pressures all
[27:21] around but God is a present help amen
[27:24] the enemy created walls check this one
[27:27] out but remember Giants they do fall
[27:31] speak over yourself encourage yourself
[27:33] in the Lord so it's not it's not a bad
[27:36] thing to encourage yourself remind you
[27:39] what has been given to you this word God
[27:41] has blessed us with he's given it to us
[27:43] and we have to claim it we have to
[27:45] believe it we have to have faith that
[27:47] it's gonna manifest in your life in this
[27:49] perfect time but you can't let the enemy
[27:52] uh just drench your faith you have to
[27:56] that faith has to just keep believing
[27:58] keep just believe like it's already
[28:00] happened and that's something we have to
[28:02] do
[28:03] so go to James 4 5. so James chapter 4
[28:06] verse 5.
[28:13] so James chapter 4 and we'll go with
[28:16] verse 5.
[28:18] do you think that the scriptures saith
[28:19] in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us
[28:21] to Envy but he giveth more grace
[28:25] whatever you saith God resisted the
[28:27] proud but giveth Grace unto the humble
[28:30] so humility is so key it's worship when
[28:33] you're humbling yourself before almighty
[28:34] God you're worshiping the Mighty God
[28:37] says submit yourselves therefore to God
[28:40] so we're worshiping God it says when you
[28:44] submit then you can resist you can't
[28:46] resist and submit so you got to submit
[28:48] first then you can resist the devil
[28:51] because we got to remember it's not your
[28:53] strength that resisting the devil but
[28:56] it's God's Mighty strength that gives
[28:58] you the strength to resist the devil and
[29:00] it says and he will flee from you that's
[29:04] why Jesus when he came uh when he met
[29:08] devil in the wilderness and he tempted
[29:10] him three times what did he use the word
[29:13] and that's what we have to use is the
[29:16] word
[29:16] and God is his word
[29:18] and says draw an eye to God and He will
[29:21] draw an eye to you cleanse your hands ye
[29:24] Sinners and purify your hearts e
[29:25] double-minded
[29:27] humble yourself notice that word humble
[29:28] is being used again because it's so
[29:30] important to God
[29:31] can't work in your life unless first you
[29:34] humble yourself submit surrender humble
[29:37] yourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[29:39] He Shall lift you up
[29:40] just like in a war
[29:42] the fighting doesn't stop until one
[29:44] party surrenders so we're in a war with
[29:48] the devil and we got to submit to be
[29:50] able to to fight this battle hey man
[29:53] amen humble yourselves inside the Lord
[29:55] and He Shall lift you up verse 11 speak
[29:58] not evil one of another brother and he
[30:00] that speaketh evil of his brother and
[30:02] judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the
[30:04] law and judges the law but if thou judge
[30:07] the law thou are not doer of the law but
[30:09] a judge
[30:12] let's go to Second Corinthians chapter
[30:14] 12 verse 9.
[30:26] so Paul was asking um something from God
[30:29] he he even said he has three times
[30:31] Thrice and Look What the Lord said to
[30:33] him in uh
[30:35] and he said unto me my grace is
[30:38] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[30:41] made perfect in weakness we can
[30:44] recognize that we have human frailties
[30:47] and recognize that it's God's strength
[30:49] that gives us the overcoming power then
[30:51] that's when his strength is made perfect
[30:53] because we're recognizing it's his
[30:55] mighty hand his mighty word that gives
[30:59] us the victory in our personal lives
[31:01] that gives us the victory in our church
[31:03] that gives us the victory in all aspects
[31:05] of our life
[31:06] and he says most gladly therefore like
[31:08] grab will I rather glory in my
[31:10] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[31:13] rest upon me worship because you're
[31:15] glowing in the things that you're going
[31:17] through knowing that there's a specific
[31:19] purpose that is going to be done from
[31:21] those things so you're thanking the Lord
[31:22] thank you Lord for this growth that's
[31:24] going to take place at me just keep my
[31:26] eyes on you in this trial help me to see
[31:28] what things you're trying to shape and
[31:30] mold in me that you need to be shaping
[31:32] molding amen
[31:34] therefore I take pleasure in infirmities
[31:37] in reproaches in Necessities in
[31:40] persecutions in distress for Christ's
[31:43] sake for I am weak I am strong amen amen
[31:49] I'm gonna go to Acts 16.
[31:55] very familiar scripture Paul and Silas
[31:58] here
[32:01] so we'll start with verse 22 and acts
[32:03] 16. so it says
[32:06] and the multitude rolls up together
[32:08] against him and the magistrates run off
[32:10] their clothes and commanded to beat them
[32:12] and when they had laying many stripes
[32:14] upon them they cast them into prison
[32:16] charging the Jailer to keep them safely
[32:19] who having received such a charge thrust
[32:22] them into the inner prison and made
[32:23] their feet fast in the stocks just think
[32:26] about the predicament they were in they
[32:29] were witnessing to these people and they
[32:31] began to persecute them they begin to
[32:33] beat them
[32:34] and we're going to see their attitude
[32:36] because attitude is so key attitude is
[32:39] going to Def determine worship and
[32:41] praise and so we see their attitude uh
[32:44] as they're in prison and at midnight
[32:46] Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises
[32:48] they weren't complaining man why are we
[32:51] in here man I'm in pain why we have to
[32:53] do all this but they were singing pray
[32:55] they prayed and sang Praises unto God
[32:58] and the prisoners heard of them look at
[33:00] that testimony that the other prisoners
[33:02] could see that these people were bloody
[33:04] and beaten but yet they were still
[33:06] praising and worshiping God in their
[33:08] pain and so this if they if they can do
[33:11] that then how much more shall we able to
[33:13] do that we're not we're not in prison
[33:15] getting beaten and stuff yeah we may be
[33:17] like in a spiritual prison we could say
[33:19] but we're not in prison we've got
[33:21] freedom and liberty to worship God we
[33:24] live in a country where the freedom to
[33:26] worship the freedom to praise God so
[33:28] what excuse that we have we don't have
[33:30] to hide it we can express it the way we
[33:32] want to and so verse 26 and suddenly
[33:36] there was a great earthquake so at the
[33:37] foundation of the prisons were shaken
[33:39] and immediately all the doors were open
[33:41] and everyone's bands were loose and The
[33:44] Keeper of the prison and waking out of
[33:46] his sleep seeing the prison doors open
[33:48] he drew out his sword and would have
[33:49] killed himself supposing the prisoners
[33:51] had been fled but Paul crowd's loud
[33:53] voice saying do thyself no harm for we
[33:56] all are all here then he called for a
[33:58] light and sprang in and came trembling
[34:00] and fell down before Paul and Silas and
[34:03] brought them out and said sirs what must
[34:04] I do to be saved and they said believe
[34:07] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and
[34:09] thou shalt be saved and thy house so we
[34:12] have to believe that when we have
[34:13] unsaved loved ones and they spake unto
[34:15] him the word of the Lord and to all that
[34:18] were in in the house
[34:19] verse 34 and when he had brought them
[34:21] into the house he set meat before them
[34:24] and rejoice believing in God with all
[34:25] his house so just look at the attitude
[34:27] that they have the good Edge they have
[34:30] open opportunity to witness and to win a
[34:32] soul for Christ so to say we gotta look
[34:34] in the same thing Place ourselves in the
[34:36] same situation
[34:37] think about you having a bad attitude
[34:39] you're not gonna be able to be a proper
[34:40] witness to Witnesses somebody to win a
[34:42] soul so attitude is everything to God
[34:45] because we got to recognize that a
[34:47] situation is going to happen it's not
[34:49] the action but it's the re how you react
[34:51] to the situation what's going to
[34:52] determine the outcome so things are
[34:54] always going to happen in your life that
[34:56] are going to surprise you but it's
[34:57] determined how you react to him and
[34:59] that's between you and between you
[35:03] amen
[35:04] amen
[35:06] so one way to keep in worship is to keep
[35:08] the fear of the Lord in your life and so
[35:11] brother Braham said the statement how
[35:12] you treat others is how you treat God so
[35:16] if we're treating our spouse better or
[35:18] friend's bed or somebody we don't know
[35:20] bad then we're in a sense we're treating
[35:22] God bad he even said as you give unto my
[35:24] little one so you give unto me even a
[35:26] cup of cold water so it's so important
[35:28] how we're treating others in our life
[35:30] because if we keep that fear we will
[35:32] always want to reverence and respect the
[35:34] Lord and this is such an important thing
[35:37] and then go to John chapter 4 24.
[35:43] very familiar scripture we mentioned it
[35:45] a couple times already
[35:47] so it says
[35:51] God is a spirit and they that worship
[35:53] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[35:56] truth amen
[35:58] so it's such a such an important thing
[36:00] and we'll read a quote from Brother bran
[36:03] confirmation and evidence now let's see
[36:05] this let's now let's listen real close
[36:08] because I'm giving a moment of your time
[36:09] to get to the scripture remember that we
[36:11] must never come to church to play
[36:14] religious
[36:15] we mustn't come to put on your religious
[36:18] act to go to church we must notice that
[36:21] he says we must
[36:24] Come To Worship in the spirit and in the
[36:27] truth look who says we must deeply and
[36:31] sincerely notice that he's we don't just
[36:33] come to sit in the seat doesn't matter
[36:35] how we're feeling or what it is but
[36:37] we're coming to meet with the very maker
[36:40] and Crater of Heaven that saved us that
[36:42] took our feet out of the Maori clay and
[36:44] set our feet on the Rock to stay that's
[36:46] what we're coming to worship
[36:48] we must really mean what we're coming
[36:51] here for me one more time we must really
[36:54] mean what we're coming here for so we
[36:56] must come with a expectation to meet
[36:58] with God because he's here he's just
[37:00] waiting for us just to recognize that he
[37:03] is here for our hearts to be prepared to
[37:05] line up with him
[37:08] these days are getting evil the devil is
[37:10] trying to take all our time away he's
[37:12] trying to any way he can to get us to be
[37:15] distracted from God
[37:17] and the time is evil we want it says we
[37:20] want to make every minute count remember
[37:23] that one more time we want to make every
[37:26] minute count look what he says right
[37:28] here and especially when we're in the
[37:30] house of the Lord remember time
[37:32] especially when we're in the house of
[37:34] the Lord so just it goes such important
[37:36] to the preparation because we're not
[37:38] here just to be here but we're here to
[37:40] receive a direct word from God he has
[37:44] something for each one of us personally
[37:46] that can only be for you and so if we're
[37:49] not connected if we're not in the spirit
[37:51] then we're going to miss the very word
[37:53] that he has for us and and we're
[37:56] expected to receive the word if we don't
[37:58] receive the word then we're going to be
[38:01] held accountable for that because that
[38:03] word is going to transform you it's
[38:04] going to change you it's going to take
[38:06] you to a higher praise a higher worship
[38:09] we could say
[38:11] amen whatever he says to you do it 1953
[38:15] let's say praise be to God praise be to
[38:19] God God is the word god means object of
[38:24] worship and God wants to be worshiped
[38:27] Jesus said God is a spirit and they that
[38:30] worship Him must worship Him in what
[38:33] spirit and in truth through truth is
[38:35] what he said I am truth and here is
[38:39] tonight in our midst being truth the
[38:42] spirit vindicating his presence he's
[38:44] both spirit and in truth the woman says
[38:46] that's the truth the man says that's the
[38:48] truth then that's the truth you have no
[38:50] right to doubt it oh isn't he wonderful
[38:53] amen Amen to that
[38:57] amen
[38:59] this is a cellular song I really like
[39:01] it's called Hallelujah from the valley
[39:02] this is such a a deep song it says he
[39:06] loves to hear our Praises he loves to
[39:08] hear the Praises of his people he loves
[39:10] to hear Praises from the mountaintops
[39:12] but I believe it draws a tear to his
[39:16] face when he hears Hallelujah from the
[39:18] valley says hallelujah from the saint
[39:21] who with every who with pain and every
[39:24] heartbeat still lifts his hands and say
[39:26] I Will Bless The Lord at all times and
[39:29] it says no matter come what may
[39:32] Hallelujah from the valley Hallelujah in
[39:34] the pain in verse 2 says he loves to see
[39:37] his children Prosper he loves to shower
[39:40] them with blessings from above but when
[39:42] the rain is pouring down he is touched
[39:45] by the sound Hallelujah from the valley
[39:48] Hallelujah from the saint with every
[39:50] heartbeat
[39:52] so we just see that that Hallelujah from
[39:55] the valley is when everything when the
[39:58] pain is coming just like a rushing
[40:00] waterfall when everything's just closing
[40:02] in but you can still Worship the Lord
[40:05] God is so pleased and so honored with
[40:08] that he's going to give you just the
[40:10] strength that you need to overcome in
[40:12] that situation
[40:14] so we got to stop looking at our trial
[40:16] like it's something like it's like the
[40:18] hardest thing that's ever been
[40:20] we got to realize that we got to be
[40:21] resting in God we've got to labor for
[40:24] that rest see God has given us a place
[40:26] of rest but we don't want to do what it
[40:29] takes to get into that rest we've got to
[40:31] labor into that rest that he's given us
[40:33] and that rest is see the rest isn't
[40:36] something where it's being lazy in this
[40:37] laying back but the rest is giving you
[40:39] the strength just to keep going to keep
[40:42] seeing that Vision you got to keep that
[40:43] Vision before you see God has a vision
[40:46] for each one of our lives and we got to
[40:48] be be willing to just keep that Vision
[40:51] before us constantly
[40:53] because God has so much for us to do he
[40:55] God chose you for a specific purpose a
[40:58] specific reason he just didn't call you
[41:00] out the world just to call you just to
[41:02] set you off to the side but he called
[41:04] you to use you in a mighty way he called
[41:06] you to be a witness to all the uttermost
[41:10] parts of the world the only places that
[41:12] you can be a witness to and we're
[41:14] supposed to be an example to others uh
[41:17] the scripture tells us a living epistle
[41:19] and somebody might never read a Bible
[41:21] and you might be the only Bible they may
[41:24] ever read That's why Paul said became
[41:26] all things to all men that I might win
[41:28] some
[41:30] so we see the importance of us always
[41:32] just being connected and I know we're
[41:35] human beings we have human nature and
[41:37] we're going to make mistakes that's okay
[41:39] when we make a mistake you get back up
[41:41] and keep pressing forward you get back
[41:43] up and say Lord I'm sorry I'm not going
[41:45] to do that again so we got to get this I
[41:47] know human nature is going to be in
[41:49] there we're going to make mistakes we're
[41:50] not perfect see a lot of times like we
[41:53] Perfection Perfection let's go to
[41:55] Matthew actually
[41:57] it's not in the notes either but it's
[41:58] okay go to Matthew uh I think it's
[42:00] Matthew 5 actually
[42:06] so Matthew 5 48.
[42:09] so it says but ye therefore be therefore
[42:13] perfect even our as Our Father which in
[42:15] his Heaven is perfect now if you look at
[42:17] that in a carnal sense that's impossible
[42:20] it's impossible but the thing is uh this
[42:22] is I guess Mark's definition Perfection
[42:24] is knowing you're not perfect
[42:28] is the first step but striving to get
[42:30] closer and more intimate with God that's
[42:33] that's what Perfection is because you're
[42:34] striving to say Lord what things am I
[42:37] not doing that you want me to do what
[42:38] things should I take out of my life
[42:40] that's Perfection that's the type of
[42:41] perfection he's talking about because
[42:43] you're that much stiffer getting more in
[42:45] the image of God that much separate
[42:46] getting the more of the image of God and
[42:48] that's the key what Perfection is we're
[42:51] obviously we're not going to be perfect
[42:52] in these bodies because he didn't come
[42:55] to our demons but in here is what he's
[42:57] coming to redeem and so we got to just
[43:00] constantly just strive for that
[43:01] Perfection that he's telling us he said
[43:03] be therefore perfect even as your father
[43:05] which is in heaven is perfect so God is
[43:07] calling us to be like him he's calling
[43:09] us to be servants and when you when
[43:12] you're obeying God
[43:14] you're entering into another step of
[43:15] perfection if we can say it that way
[43:17] amen
[43:19] amen let's go to go to John I'll go to
[43:22] John let's go to John's sorry Matthew 7
[43:24] verse 7.
[43:26] we'll close here in a couple of minutes
[43:31] amen I'll go to Matthew 7 7.
[43:33] so it says
[43:35] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[43:38] you shall find knock and it shall be
[43:40] opened unto you
[43:41] for everyone that asketh to receiveth
[43:43] and he that seeketh findeth and to him
[43:46] that knocketh it shall be open so I love
[43:49] how it says encouragements to pray
[43:52] and we got to just constantly this when
[43:54] we're on our knees just trying just
[43:56] wanting to enter into the presence of
[43:58] God that's worship because you want to
[44:00] just get alone with you and him that's
[44:03] just the key it's not just about saying
[44:04] your your daily prayers and you know
[44:07] getting up and doing your thing but it's
[44:09] about really getting intimate with God
[44:10] really meaning business that Lord I'm
[44:13] I'm here for you I'm not here just to
[44:15] say what I need but I'm here just to
[44:17] just to lift your name up on how I'm
[44:19] here just to say thank you for all that
[44:21] you're doing all that you have done and
[44:23] just we enter in that way you really can
[44:25] just enter into the presence of God
[44:27] because you're no longer thinking about
[44:29] everything that you need but you're but
[44:31] Matthew 6 33 is being Incorporated right
[44:34] here but seek ye first the kingdom of
[44:36] God
[44:37] and his righteousness and all these
[44:39] things shall be added unto you
[44:41] so when you're doing that see when you
[44:43] seek God first if you read that chapter
[44:46] he knows everything that we have need of
[44:48] before we even ask him and so we
[44:51] shouldn't be worrying about these things
[44:52] we should be the only thing you should
[44:53] be worried about is just seeking him
[44:55] with all our whole heart not just when
[44:58] we want to seek him but when we but
[45:00] seeking him with everything that's
[45:01] within us and we see that you know in
[45:04] Deuteronomy 6 5 you can we go
[45:06] Deuteronomy 6 5 please
[45:08] I know I know it's a notes forgive me it
[45:10] says and thou shall love the Lord thy
[45:12] God
[45:13] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[45:15] with all thy might just notice that with
[45:18] all we said before that when God does
[45:20] something he does it with all and when
[45:22] we do something we need to put our all
[45:25] into it all our effort all our time all
[45:28] our heart and that's all God is looking
[45:30] for is the heart condition like is this
[45:33] believer really putting all his heart or
[45:34] is he not got it's not something in the
[45:36] middle it's not like Switzerland where
[45:38] you can do you know 50 here then 50
[45:40] later in the day but give a hundred
[45:42] percent see it's about the quality it's
[45:44] all about quality over it see a lot of
[45:46] times we put quantity first but I'd
[45:49] rather have you spend five minutes of
[45:52] quality time with God than you 45
[45:54] minutes of this quantity and no quality
[45:56] because God is looking for the quality
[45:58] we see when Moses he said brother bran
[46:00] said this statement five minutes in the
[46:03] presence of God he knew more than he he
[46:05] knew exactly we had to do than compared
[46:07] to the 40 years and I'm not saying just
[46:09] just do five minutes and that's it but
[46:11] what I'm saying is if you have an idea
[46:14] of well I'll just spend 30 minutes and
[46:15] I'll be done with it today but no don't
[46:16] don't do that don't think that time can
[46:19] just take the place of that that quality
[46:21] what I'm saying is put quality into
[46:24] reading the word quality and listen to
[46:26] the message of the hour quality and
[46:28] witnessing somebody quality and
[46:30] discipling somebody because your time is
[46:33] so precious to God it's the greatest
[46:35] currency that God has given us is time
[46:37] because time is how you you build your
[46:40] relationship with God time is how you
[46:42] you build your your marriage build your
[46:44] friendship it all requires time work
[46:47] requires time saving money requires time
[46:51] so if you look at all these things that
[46:52] what time is required buying a car to
[46:55] pay it off takes time so we just see how
[46:57] important as Paul said to redeem the
[47:00] time because the days are evil
[47:02] and so we just see this importance and
[47:05] just in closing we didn't see the such
[47:07] importance of what worship is worship is
[47:10] something that's intimate something that
[47:12] comes from the heart something that
[47:13] doesn't just have to be done here should
[47:15] be done here it should be done in your
[47:16] homes in your cars it could be a Walmart
[47:19] it could be admirers Costco it could be
[47:21] done anywhere so don't just limit
[47:23] worship it's just one place
[47:25] but worship should be everywhere our
[47:27] whole life we need to be worshiping God
[47:29] and and like I said God knows we have
[47:32] jobs and stuff but you can still worship
[47:33] at your job and so we can just rise to
[47:37] our feet and we'll just um
[47:41] sing a little song
[47:44] like this song
[47:49] Here I Am to Worship
[47:53] here I am to bow down here I am to say
[47:59] that you're my God you're all together
[48:06] lovely all together
[48:10] worthy all together
[48:14] wonderful to me
[48:18] Here I Am to Worship here I am to bow
[48:25] down here I am to say that you're my God
[48:32] you're all together
[48:35] lovely all together
[48:39] worthy all together
[48:43] wonderful to me to sing it to him again
[48:47] here I am to worship here I am to bow
[48:53] down here I am to say that you're my God
[49:01] you're all together
[49:03] lovely all together
[49:07] worthy all together
[49:11] wonderful to me to sing it one more time
[49:15] here I am to worship here I am to bow
[49:21] down here I am to say that you're my God

[49:47] amen
