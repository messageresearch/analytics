[34:44] it'll be worth it all. Amen. Well, uh
[34:48] turn with me if you would for opening
[34:49] scripture in the book of Amos today.
[34:53] Let's let's be in special prayer and
[34:59] uh special prayer for this uh our
[35:02] anniversary services this weekend. Um I
[35:06] don't know how many years it's been, but
[35:09] it's been a while. And uh we got brother
[35:12] Gerald Ward coming and um if I just
[35:16] invite some friends, some family and
[35:20] um I know that you'll be blessed from
[35:23] Brother Daryl's ministry. We don't get
[35:25] to have them very often, but when we do,
[35:28] we so much appreciate him. Amen. Before
[35:32] we begin reading here in the book of
[35:34] Amos, let's just ask God's blessings on
[35:37] the reading of the word. Our heavenly
[35:39] father, we thank you that you provided
[35:42] an opportunity for us to gather together
[35:46] in your house today. And God, we thank
[35:49] you for your presence. For you, word
[35:52] declares where just two or three are
[35:54] gathered together in your name. You'd be
[35:56] there in the midst. Amen. Lord, you also
[35:59] declare that you inhabit the praises of
[36:01] your people. We've sang these songs.
[36:03] We've expressed our love and our
[36:05] thanksgiving to you. We know that you're
[36:07] here and we just ask that you'd come now
[36:09] and break the bread of life to us. Lord,
[36:12] we pray that you'd be with each one that
[36:14] would be online today watching the
[36:17] service. God, that you would be with
[36:19] them and bless them in their homes.
[36:22] Lord, touch the bodies of those that are
[36:25] sick and afflicted, those that are going
[36:26] through test and trials. Lord, today I
[36:29] just pray that you'd meet every need.
[36:32] Lord, we commit the service in your
[36:33] hand. ask your blessings now in Jesus
[36:36] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amos
[36:40] chapter 4, we're going to read two
[36:42] verses there starting with verse number
[36:46] 11. I have overthrown some of you as God
[36:51] overthrew Sodom and
[36:53] Gomorrah and ye were as fire as a fire
[36:59] branded out of the
[37:01] burning. Praise God.
[37:04] Yet ye have not returned unto me,
[37:06] sayaeth the Lord, therefore thus will I
[37:10] do unto thee, O Israel, and because I
[37:13] will do this unto thee, prepare to meet
[37:18] thy God, O Israel. God bless you. You
[37:21] may be seated. Like to entitle this
[37:23] message
[37:24] preparations. Our opening scripture
[37:27] here, prepare to meet thy God. I kind of
[37:30] want that to be our our subject today.
[37:32] Amen. is something that
[37:36] um probably wouldn't be like a present
[37:38] thought to think about a lot is
[37:41] preparing to meet
[37:43] God. We'd like to kind of put that off
[37:45] as far as possible. Um but it is
[37:50] something that I believe that God wants
[37:54] us to be thinking about
[37:56] on a regular basis. And if we could take
[37:59] some scriptures here in the in Matthew
[38:01] chapter 24,
[38:04] uh kind of laying a foundation here, uh
[38:07] Matthew chapter 24, we're uh Jesus is
[38:11] talking about his second coming and what
[38:15] would be happening amongst uh nations
[38:18] and just um there'd be wars and rumors
[38:22] of war, but that that isn't here.
[38:23] there's going to be a falling away that
[38:25] because of iniquity, the love of many
[38:26] would wax cold. And when you see the fig
[38:29] tree uh bring forth its its its leaf,
[38:33] you know that summer's nigh. And he
[38:35] gives us these these signs about when
[38:39] everybody is going to meet their god.
[38:43] And uh just want to pick it up here in
[38:44] verse number 36. Matthew 24:36. But of
[38:48] that day and hour knoweth no man.
[38:54] No, not even the angels in heaven know,
[38:56] but my father
[38:59] only. And he goes on to say, but as it
[39:01] was in the days of Noah, so shall it
[39:04] also uh so also shall the coming of the
[39:08] son of man be. And so he describes the
[39:11] part of what it we're paying attention
[39:15] to the days of Noah. For as in the days
[39:18] uh were before the flood, there was
[39:20] eating, drinking, marrying, giving in
[39:22] the marriage until the that Noah entered
[39:25] into the ark. In other words, it just
[39:27] seemed everything seemed normal. Just
[39:32] normal normal
[39:34] stuff. And they knew not until the flood
[39:39] came and took them all the way. So shall
[39:42] the coming of the son of man be.
[39:46] That's right.
[39:51] And then he goes on to say concerning
[39:54] when the son of man shall be, then shall
[39:56] two be in the field, one shall be taken,
[39:58] one left. Two women shall be grinding at
[40:01] the mill, one shall be taken, one left.
[40:03] Watch therefore, for you know not what
[40:05] hour your lord doth
[40:07] come. But know this, that if the good
[40:10] man of the house had known in in what
[40:12] watch the thief would have come, he
[40:14] would have watched and would not
[40:15] suffered his house to be broken up.
[40:17] Therefore, be ye also ready, for in such
[40:20] an hour as you think not. That's when
[40:22] the Son of Man's coming.
[40:25] Who then is a faithful and wise steward,
[40:27] whom his Lord hath made rule over his
[40:30] household to give them meat in due
[40:31] season?
[40:33] So, no one knows when the Son of Man is
[40:36] coming, not even the
[40:39] angels.
[40:41] Furthermore, nothing is going to seem
[40:43] out of sync about it, right?
[40:46] As it was in the days of Noah, as it was
[40:48] in the days of Lot. The the the days of
[40:50] of Noah is like 120 years. And the days
[40:53] of Lot, well, it just seems so so common
[40:56] that um the the the filth that's in the
[41:00] world
[41:03] and and two are going to be outside, two
[41:05] are going to be working, two are going
[41:06] to be in the same bed, one's going to be
[41:07] taken, one's going to be left, right?
[41:11] So, nobody knows, but yet Jesus says,
[41:14] "Watch.
[41:16] Watch therefore, for you know not what
[41:19] hour the Lord." So, what are we supposed
[41:20] to watch for if everything is the same?
[41:24] What are we looking at? Should we be
[41:26] looking at the world? Should we be
[41:28] looking at the world events?
[41:31] I mean, if we do, you know, there's hope
[41:33] because, you know, because Trump has got
[41:36] into office and um, you know, things are
[41:39] looking better now.
[41:42] Should we be looking at that? No.
[41:45] Doesn't matter who's in office, does it?
[41:52] So, in fact, the Bible says when they
[41:54] say peace and safety, we can't even be
[41:56] looking at that because then sudden
[41:58] destruction comes.
[42:01] So what are we supposed to be watching
[42:03] for? Because this is a message that
[42:06] Jesus has given us to be ready to
[42:11] watch. So we need to be looking at
[42:14] something to make sure we're ready. And
[42:17] so a good question that we could ask all
[42:18] of us, are we ready?
[42:21] Are we prepared to meet God? If God
[42:24] would come today, what would merit us
[42:27] being ready to go?
[42:30] Could we say that we're safe and sound
[42:31] at church?
[42:35] That we're in the message,
[42:37] that we've gotten baptiz baptism merits
[42:40] us being ready.
[42:43] I don't think being uh call saying that
[42:45] we're in a message church merits us
[42:47] being ready. But we really need to
[42:50] answer the question, how do we know
[42:52] we're ready?
[42:54] because we know that we're in the
[42:57] season and we could sit and we could say
[43:00] that um you know certain things have to
[43:02] happen yet before uh before the Lord
[43:08] returns. But we also could say the Lord
[43:10] could return u today before the service
[43:14] is over and know that he was perfectly
[43:17] right in his word. Right. And and so I
[43:20] think what's what's really important is
[43:22] to be thinking about in ourselves. Are
[43:24] we prepared to meet the Lord? Because if
[43:26] that's what our focus is, we don't have
[43:28] to figure out what's going out out
[43:29] there, right? We could just focus on
[43:32] what God wants us to be doing today in
[43:35] case he comes today.
[43:39] Therefore, be also ready. For in such an
[43:41] hour as you think not, the Son of Man
[43:44] cometh. It's it's the responsibility to
[43:48] be ready in an hour that we don't even
[43:51] think he's coming.
[43:56] It's more of a responsibility because if
[43:59] we don't think he's coming tomorrow,
[44:01] think about it. Everybody's got their
[44:03] plan made out for tomorrow, don't they?
[44:05] Yes. What we're working, what we're
[44:07] doing, what's going on, what's, you
[44:09] know, it's been set. this is what we're
[44:10] going to do
[44:14] because we're
[44:16] planning. He's actually coming an hour
[44:18] where we don't think he's coming. So,
[44:21] we're in a more dangerous state thinking
[44:23] he's not coming than if we were thinking
[44:26] that he was coming.
[44:29] Right.
[44:31] And I think that's what God wants us to
[44:33] be
[44:34] thinking. Don't be sitting in a place
[44:36] thinking he's not coming.
[44:39] Because if you do, that's what opens the
[44:41] door for relaxation,
[44:44] for taking it easy.
[44:47] But if we could be thinking this could
[44:48] be the day, then that's going to promote
[44:50] us to being getting prepared.
[44:55] Preparation is wisdom in everyday life.
[44:59] Proverbs 30:4, we just talk a little bit
[45:02] about preparation here. Proverbs 30:24
[45:05] says, "There they're they're before
[45:06] things which are little on earth, but
[45:10] they're exceedingly
[45:12] wise. The ants are a people not strong,
[45:16] yet they prepare their meat in the
[45:19] summer." Yes.
[45:22] And and and and what about
[45:24] uh the um beavers?
[45:28] Same same thing. They work real hard.
[45:30] They get their little stuff and they
[45:32] build their hut and they're good for
[45:34] winter. There's a there's a preparation
[45:37] to
[45:38] survival. The conies are but a few a
[45:41] feeble folk yet make their their houses
[45:45] in the
[45:46] rocks preparation. The locust have no
[45:49] king yet they go forth all of them by
[45:52] bands.
[45:54] The spider taketh hold with her hands
[45:57] and is in king's uh palaces.
[46:01] Preparation, no matter what you are,
[46:06] preparation is uh
[46:10] uh wise in whatever you're doing.
[46:15] It would be unwise to try to go to war
[46:18] with another nation without being
[46:19] prepared.
[46:22] Jesus said in Luke 14:31, "Or what king
[46:25] going to war against another king saith
[46:28] not down first and consulted with
[46:30] whether he be able with 10,000 to meet
[46:32] him that cometh to him with 20,000? Or
[46:35] else
[46:36] while or else while the other is yet a
[46:39] great way off, he sendeth an
[46:42] ambassading conditions of peace." So, it
[46:46] is wise to to make sure that you're
[46:49] prepared no matter what you're doing for
[46:53] battle. 1 Corinthians 14:8 says, "For if
[46:56] the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who
[46:58] shall prepare himself to the battle?"
[47:02] And I believe
[47:05] that that there is one group of
[47:09] people that is going to be ready for the
[47:12] coming of the Lord. Amen.
[47:14] And it is a group of people that want to
[47:17] be.
[47:20] They want to be prepared.
[47:23] The people that don't want to be, they
[47:25] won't be.
[47:28] Now, that that group of people that
[47:29] don't want to be, they still want to go.
[47:32] And I believe that the majority of them
[47:34] are convinced that they're going to go
[47:36] in a rapture because the devil has done
[47:38] his job making them think that they are
[47:41] ready.
[47:45] Think about that group. Many will come
[47:47] to me in that day say, "Lord, Lord,
[47:48] didn't we prophesy in thy name? Cast out
[47:50] devils and many did many wonderful works
[47:52] in thy name." And then will I profess
[47:55] unto them? I never knew. So they thought
[47:58] they were
[48:00] prepared. They they thought they were
[48:02] prepared to meet their
[48:04] God. But were they?
[48:08] No. They were left behind to go through
[48:10] tribulation.
[48:12] So, you can't even look at the works you
[48:14] do. You can't even look at the miracles
[48:16] that you perform.
[48:18] You can't even look at the way that God
[48:21] has used you
[48:23] to show that you're literally prepared
[48:25] for the coming of Jesus Christ.
[48:30] Preparation is needed in just about
[48:33] everything we do if we want to be
[48:36] successful.
[48:38] So for
[48:39] instance, if I am going to rent an
[48:47] Airbnb, it has to be prepared for me to
[48:52] go there. It can't be left with all the
[48:55] other
[48:57] messy sheets
[49:00] and how it was left by the person
[49:02] before. So it has to be prepared for me
[49:07] to go there. Now the thing
[49:10] is it can never get
[49:13] clean if our sister Gabrielle doesn't
[49:16] have the supplies needed to clean it. So
[49:19] she has to be prepared herself to get it
[49:23] prepared for the next person to go in.
[49:26] Preparation is needed to accomplish. Try
[49:30] making a meal. How many of you ever made
[49:34] um went to go I'm gonna make this meal
[49:35] and then when you get ready to to make
[49:37] it, you don't even got all the stuff
[49:38] needed to make it.
[49:41] You're not prepared.
[49:46] You can't wait till five minutes before
[49:48] dinner to get ready for dinner.
[49:51] You have to prepare for it.
[49:55] But how many times do we just like I
[49:57] don't know what's going on for dinner.
[50:00] it. I mean, we we live in that society.
[50:02] We'll figure it out when we get there.
[50:04] That's right.
[50:07] We can't wait five minutes before church
[50:09] to get ready.
[50:12] It takes preparation.
[50:15] We can't wait five minutes before our
[50:17] dentist appointment to get ready.
[50:20] I mean, what do we usually do to get
[50:22] ready to go to a dentist
[50:24] appointment? We brush our teeth. We're
[50:27] going to the place that's going to clean
[50:29] our teeth and we want to brush them
[50:30] before we get there because we
[50:33] definitely don't want the hygienist
[50:35] smelling our breath.
[50:37] That is the truth. So, we prepare.
[50:40] How many times have you been on the way
[50:42] to the dentist, you were get get there
[50:44] late, so you made a phone call. Hey, I'm
[50:45] going to be a little bit late.
[50:51] Preparation is important.
[50:57] A lot of preparation is needed for
[51:00] events, for sports competitions, for
[51:03] work. Can you
[51:05] imagine if you're in charge of work, you
[51:08] got to accomplish something. You got to
[51:10] make sure you've got the right
[51:12] materials.
[51:14] You can't have the wrong materials. You
[51:16] won't be able to do your job. You You
[51:17] can't have the wrong tools. You got to
[51:18] have the right tools to do your job.
[51:20] Preparation is important for success.
[51:25] Preparation is needed for Sunday school.
[51:28] Yes. For leading the church worship.
[51:32] Amen. For the ministry of the word of
[51:35] God. Preparation is
[51:38] needed. Uh there's been countless of
[51:40] hours in the back trying to get this
[51:43] system so it works right and there's not
[51:46] interferences and getting problems
[51:48] fixed. And you you don't just wait till
[51:50] five minutes before service to go ahead
[51:52] and you know try to wing it.
[51:55] Preparation is
[51:58] needed before meeting God.
[52:03] Prepare to meet thy God. Watch therefore
[52:06] be ye also ready for ye know not what
[52:10] hour the Lord cometh. He's telling you
[52:13] you don't know. I didn't even tell the
[52:14] angels.
[52:18] I'll give you a hint. When you think
[52:19] it's not going to happen, that's
[52:20] probably when it's going to happen.
[52:24] But we need yet to prepare to meet God.
[52:30] We have to do more than just get
[52:32] baptized and say that I'm in the body of
[52:35] Christ.
[52:37] There'll be many more
[52:40] professors, not people with degrees, but
[52:43] many more people who
[52:45] profess that they're in the body that
[52:47] don't make
[52:50] it. So, we need to be looking
[52:53] at at something else. And I I think the
[52:56] the greatest thing that we could be
[52:58] doing is having a heart to want to be
[53:00] prepared.
[53:02] Jesus, like to honestly
[53:05] say I could be wrong. Yes.
[53:09] I I think what I'm going to do is press
[53:10] towards the bark. I think that spirit
[53:15] will lead and guide you into all truth.
[53:23] And I that spirit I can have confidence
[53:25] in.
[53:27] I believe that's what the predestinated
[53:29] have.
[53:31] They have that spirit.
[53:35] God is always
[53:38] preparing. He sent his angels with
[53:41] flaming swords to protect the tree of
[53:42] life. As soon as Adam and Eve fell,
[53:45] said, "I can't have them get to the tree
[53:46] of life." And he sent something there to
[53:50] to prepare that so they couldn't get to
[53:52] it. Is that true?
[53:54] He sent the pillar of cloud and the
[53:56] pillar of fire to protect the children
[53:58] of Israel as well as to guide them.
[54:01] Like a preparation like he he had it all
[54:04] settled when they were leaving Egypt.
[54:06] What was going to happen at the Red Sea?
[54:10] God wanted the tabernacle in the
[54:12] wilderness prepared according to the
[54:13] vision that he told Moses in the
[54:16] mountain. make it just like I showed you
[54:18] after the pattern that I showed you. So
[54:21] there's a preparation and everything had
[54:24] to be in order. Can you imagine when I
[54:27] when God had everything in order in his
[54:29] tabernacle and in his church and the way
[54:31] he wanted it to be with everything? It
[54:35] wasn't like he just, you know, wanted to
[54:37] go to Wayfair or Art Van and and try to
[54:40] pick out his own furniture for the
[54:43] house. It wasn't like that.
[54:46] He had a purpose in it. It had to be
[54:49] exactly the way he wanted it.
[54:52] And I when we take a look at um when
[54:57] Vashi was cast
[54:59] out and there was a choosing of a new
[55:03] bride for for the king.
[55:08] Well, there was only one person that
[55:11] actually took exactly what was given to
[55:13] her to get ready while all the others
[55:16] added to their their life of what they
[55:20] were going to do to get
[55:23] chosen. And we can't be
[55:25] adding our own ideas of what we think is
[55:28] going to be acceptable to God. We've got
[55:30] to just stay with what the word tells us
[55:33] to do.
[55:36] Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord God will
[55:40] do nothing it, but he revealth his
[55:43] secrets unto his servants, the
[55:44] prophets." Amen.
[55:47] So before God does anything, he prepares
[55:50] and he tells the prophets first.
[55:56] Before God destroyed Sodom, he told
[55:58] Abraham.
[56:00] Before God brought forth a virgin birth,
[56:02] he told Isaiah. Before God destroyed 450
[56:05] prophets, he told
[56:08] Elijah. And before God opened all the
[56:10] mysteries of the Bible in this last age,
[56:12] he told William Brandham.
[56:18] And there's many scriptures that talk
[56:20] about that it might be fulfilled which
[56:22] was spoken by the prophet. That it might
[56:25] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[56:27] prophet. That it might be fulfilled
[56:29] which was spoken by the prophet. Over
[56:31] and over. You'll see it in the New
[56:33] Testament, Acts 2:16. But this is that
[56:36] which was spoken by the prophet Joel. So
[56:39] God stating that he's not going to do
[56:41] anything except he tells the prophet
[56:44] first what's going to happen. So somehow
[56:46] the second coming is tied into the
[56:48] prophet. Yes, sir.
[56:52] God will not come on the scene without a
[56:55] prophet to prepare the way. Amen. Isaiah
[56:58] 40:3 says, 'The voice of him crying in
[57:01] the wilderness, prepare ye the way of
[57:02] the Lord. Make straight a desert in the
[57:06] uh in the desert a highway for our God.
[57:09] And we know that was John the Baptist.
[57:12] Malachi 3:1, "Behold, I will send my
[57:15] messenger, and he shall prepare the way
[57:20] for me."
[57:22] God wants preparation for him,
[57:26] Jesus.
[57:30] Uh, Matthewap
[57:32] 11:7. As they departed, Jesus began to
[57:35] say to the multitudes concerning John
[57:37] the Baptist, "What went out in the
[57:39] wilderness to see is a reed shaken in
[57:41] the
[57:42] wind? But what went ye out to see? A man
[57:44] clothed in soft raignment? Behold, they
[57:47] that wear soft clothing or in king's
[57:49] houses, but what went out to see a
[57:51] prophet? Yeah, I saying to you, more
[57:53] than a prophet.
[57:57] For this is he of whom it is written,
[57:58] "Behold, I send my messenger before my
[58:00] face, which shall prepare thy way before
[58:04] thee." Amen.
[58:07] God uses a prophet before he comes on
[58:09] the scene. It's no different in our age.
[58:11] We know this. Malachi
[58:16] 4:1, "For behold, the day cometh that
[58:19] shall burn as an oven, and all the
[58:22] proud, yay, and all that do wickedly
[58:24] shall be stubble, and the day that
[58:26] cometh shall burn them up, sayeth the
[58:28] Lord of hosts, that it shall neither
[58:30] leave them shall leave them neither root
[58:33] nor branch." Amen. So that's that's
[58:36] talking
[58:39] about that is coming be before the
[58:43] second coming of Christ. Is that true?
[58:45] True. Okay. So, let's drop down to verse
[58:47] five. Behold, I send you Elijah the
[58:50] prophet before the coming of the great
[58:52] and dreadful day of the Lord. Now, we
[58:54] could literally say the great day of the
[58:57] Lord is when Jesus was
[59:00] born. We could say that because he
[59:03] brought good tidings of of great joy and
[59:06] shall be to all people. Uh and there was
[59:09] a trumpet. It was a rejoicing. There was
[59:11] nothing negative that happened at the
[59:12] birth. We could say it was a great day,
[59:16] but we could never say that that day was
[59:18] a dreadful day. That's right. It was a
[59:20] dreadful day.
[59:24] Verse six, and he shall turn the hearts
[59:26] of the fathers to the children, and the
[59:28] hearts of the children to the fathers,
[59:29] lest they come and smite the earth with
[59:31] a curse. Now, there's no way that that
[59:34] this is a dual prophecy.
[59:37] Just like we could say verse five is a
[59:41] Jew prophecy. We could that John the
[59:44] Baptist could fulfill the great
[59:50] day. And John the Baptist, he turned the
[59:53] hearts of the Old Testament fathers to
[59:56] the to the to the to the Pentecostal
[1:00:00] Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost.
[1:00:07] And now the second Elijah coming to the
[1:00:11] second coming is turned has turned the
[1:00:13] hearts of the the the the children back
[1:00:17] to the Pentecostal fathers. Yes sir.
[1:00:20] Lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:00:24] curse. So it happens before the earth is
[1:00:29] burnt.
[1:00:32] God uses a prophet to
[1:00:35] prepare for his second
[1:00:38] coming. Revelations 10:7, "But in the
[1:00:40] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:00:42] when he should begin to sound, the
[1:00:43] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:00:45] declared to who?" His servants, the
[1:00:48] prophets.
[1:00:53] It's important that we don't acknowledge
[1:00:55] who the prophet is. It's important that
[1:00:58] we receive the message of the prophet.
[1:01:00] Amen. Now, just imagine that you didn't
[1:01:03] go to
[1:01:05] church and you were stuck in home and
[1:01:08] you had to read the books and find out
[1:01:09] what the prophet
[1:01:11] said. That is what we should be doing
[1:01:14] every day.
[1:01:17] You cannot
[1:01:20] depend on this
[1:01:23] pulpit to tell
[1:01:26] you Malachi 45 and 6. You
[1:01:30] can't because if that's if that's true,
[1:01:33] then we wouldn't need Malachi 45 and 6.
[1:01:36] But God gave us a five-fold ministry.
[1:01:38] Amen.
[1:01:40] And it is up to us to get a heart for
[1:01:44] what God sent to prepare us.
[1:01:47] If we don't have a heart for it, we're
[1:01:49] not going to get into it.
[1:01:54] And I believe with all my heart that we
[1:01:56] need that message to get ready for a
[1:01:58] rapture.
[1:02:00] It it and it can't be the knowledge that
[1:02:04] God sent a prophet. It literally has to
[1:02:06] be the message that God sent through
[1:02:08] that prophet.
[1:02:13] Brother Brandon said, "Rapturing faith
[1:02:14] lies in those tapes." That's right.
[1:02:20] God has sent a prophet messenger in this
[1:02:23] last age to restore us back to the word
[1:02:27] in Ephesians 5:26 is that he might
[1:02:30] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:02:32] of the water by the word. So the word is
[1:02:35] what
[1:02:37] restores the washing of the word is what
[1:02:40] actually restores us to the state that
[1:02:42] we need to be
[1:02:43] in that he might present to himself a
[1:02:46] glorious church not having spot or
[1:02:47] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:02:49] should be holy and without blemish. So
[1:02:53] God is coming for that type of
[1:03:00] church. Now, the way the bride of Christ
[1:03:03] is getting prepared is by continually
[1:03:05] feeding on the message of the hour.
[1:03:09] Praise God that we we're in a church
[1:03:12] that preaches the message without saying
[1:03:14] William Brandom. That is good.
[1:03:17] Yeah, we don't have to say William
[1:03:19] Brandon and quote the quotes, but we're
[1:03:20] going to do that a lot tonight. But we
[1:03:22] don't have to do that.
[1:03:24] Alls we got to do is have the message
[1:03:26] and preach the message because we can we
[1:03:28] can share the message with others. True.
[1:03:31] You know, you you can talk to a
[1:03:32] trinitarian telling the correct way to
[1:03:34] be baptized. And I never knew the
[1:03:36] correct way to be baptized until I came
[1:03:37] into the message. I'm not saying you
[1:03:39] could have you could have found it out
[1:03:40] another way. But I'm telling you that
[1:03:42] this message is what holds the truth.
[1:03:44] And when you speak the truth to others,
[1:03:45] you're speaking the message to others.
[1:03:53] The message of the hour is helping dress
[1:03:55] the bride. It's full of nuggets that we
[1:03:58] desperately need to get ready.
[1:04:01] when the new poop when the new pope
[1:04:08] I don't actually know how that happened
[1:04:12] but I apologize for
[1:04:14] that. When the new pope was elected I
[1:04:18] had several brothers from the message
[1:04:21] send me this quote. Brother Bruce was
[1:04:24] one of them. This quote was literally um
[1:04:28] over 70 years ago just showing the
[1:04:30] importance of the message here. It was
[1:04:33] in the acts of the holy spirit. Brother
[1:04:35] says I believe one of these glorious
[1:04:36] days when the United Confederation of
[1:04:40] church goes together and the new pope is
[1:04:44] brought out of the United States and put
[1:04:48] over there according to
[1:04:50] prophecy then they'll form an image like
[1:04:53] unto the beast. And I tell you, the true
[1:04:56] church of God will be drove together.
[1:05:01] The real true believers out of the
[1:05:02] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:05:04] Pentecost, Nazarene, pilgrim, holiness,
[1:05:06] whatever they'll be, will go together
[1:05:09] and cemented by the love of God. They'll
[1:05:12] make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:05:14] all the believers, and the agnostics,
[1:05:16] the shallow-minded will be cast to one
[1:05:18] side and they'll go right on in the
[1:05:20] confederation of
[1:05:22] churches. Now, think about it. this pope
[1:05:24] that was just elected. He's the first
[1:05:26] pope that was ever from the United
[1:05:27] States.
[1:05:32] And there's probably other things in the
[1:05:34] message that Brother Random
[1:05:37] spoke that are are needing to transpire.
[1:05:43] But the main thing is I need to be
[1:05:46] reading the things that's going to help
[1:05:48] me get prepared for him. It's not the
[1:05:50] knowledge that that having this pope,
[1:05:52] you know, coming from here. It's just
[1:05:54] there's signs showing us the lateness of
[1:05:57] the hour. But what's really important is
[1:05:58] I just got to accept that God sent a
[1:06:00] prophet to get me ready and get in
[1:06:02] there, read it, say, "God, what would
[1:06:04] you have me to do to get ready?" And
[1:06:06] mean that from our heart. That's what's
[1:06:08] needed. Yes. Because we're not going to
[1:06:10] be taking a test before the rapture.
[1:06:16] Second Peter chapter 3 verse one.
[1:06:21] This second epistle, beloved, I now
[1:06:24] write unto you in both which I stir up
[1:06:28] your pure minds by a way of remembrance.
[1:06:33] Well, that's a good reason to come to
[1:06:34] church. Yes. Not necessarily to always
[1:06:37] hear something new, but to have your
[1:06:40] pure mind stirred up by way of
[1:06:42] remembrance.
[1:06:45] that ye be that ye may be mindful of the
[1:06:48] words which were spoken before by the
[1:06:51] holy prophets and of the commandment of
[1:06:54] us the apostles of of the Lord and
[1:06:57] Savior. Knowing this first that there
[1:07:01] shall come in the last days
[1:07:04] scoffers walking after their own
[1:07:07] desires and saying, "Where is the
[1:07:11] promise of his coming? For since the
[1:07:14] fathers fell asleep, all things continue
[1:07:16] as they were from the beginning of the
[1:07:19] creation. Now there is obviously brother
[1:07:22] Brandham talked to us
[1:07:24] about the the spirit
[1:07:27] um comes in and it's in three stages
[1:07:33] before it's crowned.
[1:07:35] And if I could just say it like this,
[1:07:38] there is a spirit that gets on people
[1:07:43] that doesn't make them believe that
[1:07:45] Jesus is coming soon. Oh, sure.
[1:07:52] And for the most part, people don't like
[1:07:54] talking about that he's coming soon.
[1:07:58] But I remember when I first came in, I
[1:08:00] thought he was coming a long time ago.
[1:08:03] Amen. I thought for sure he was coming
[1:08:06] in 77. I thought for sure he was coming
[1:08:09] in 80. I was telling my worldly friends
[1:08:11] that you had worldly friends. I did. I
[1:08:13] was still hanging on to some of them.
[1:08:17] Not hanging on so much as I, you know, I
[1:08:21] wanted to get them in and, you know,
[1:08:23] connected with them.
[1:08:29] But now we don't even think about it.
[1:08:34] But we should be thinking he could be
[1:08:36] coming anytime.
[1:08:38] We should still have that.
[1:08:41] But so there's a spirit
[1:08:43] there. Walking after your own desires
[1:08:46] and just inside where is the promise of
[1:08:49] where's it at?
[1:08:52] Nothing's changing. I don't see anyone
[1:08:54] becoming more in the image of Christ. I
[1:08:57] don't see anybody changing from glory to
[1:08:59] glory. I don't see anyone becoming a new
[1:09:01] creature in Christ. I just see we go to
[1:09:04] church. Got these problems with these
[1:09:06] people in the church.
[1:09:09] Got these problems with the people in
[1:09:11] the
[1:09:13] family. Everything just seems to be the
[1:09:15] same old same
[1:09:17] old. All things continue as they were
[1:09:20] since the prophet was
[1:09:22] here. Where is the promise of his
[1:09:24] coming?
[1:09:28] Jesus is coming soon. We need to be
[1:09:30] ready.
[1:09:32] We need to stir up our minds
[1:09:35] understanding that these spirits are
[1:09:37] allowed to be here. They're allowed
[1:09:40] they're they're allowed to attack our
[1:09:42] minds and attack our homes and attack
[1:09:44] our church. But we need to take a stand
[1:09:46] against them.
[1:09:49] We need to say for no for me in my house
[1:09:51] will serve the Lord. Well, John, I'm the
[1:09:53] only one in the house. Then you be the
[1:09:55] house in the house.
[1:09:59] But be it. But be it. Brother Bren said
[1:10:04] the message convinced and concerned. He
[1:10:06] says, "You know what I believe? I
[1:10:08] believe that the people are not
[1:10:10] convinced that Jesus is coming soon.
[1:10:15] I don't believe that they're convinced
[1:10:16] that he's coming in this age.
[1:10:20] And I believe that's the reason that
[1:10:22] they're not concerned
[1:10:24] is because they're not fully
[1:10:30] convinced. They're not convinced that
[1:10:33] he's with them. If they were, they would
[1:10:37] come back to the word. That's right.
[1:10:39] Now, many people might misunderstand it.
[1:10:42] Love is disciplined.
[1:10:46] You must discipline people if you love
[1:10:48] them.
[1:10:50] If your little girl was sitting out in
[1:10:52] the road, as I said this morning making
[1:10:55] mudcakes, if you really loved her, you
[1:10:58] would get her off the
[1:11:01] road. Now, the thing is, if she's in the
[1:11:04] road, she don't want to get off the
[1:11:06] road. And she certainly doesn't want you
[1:11:08] telling her to get off the road. In
[1:11:11] fact, she may look at you and say, "You
[1:11:13] don't love me.
[1:11:15] True. If you love me, you let me do
[1:11:18] this.
[1:11:20] But in reality, love says, "No, we've
[1:11:22] got to serve God."
[1:11:26] Yeah, that's right. No matter what, we
[1:11:28] have to serve God.
[1:11:35] You know, our hearts are deceptive.
[1:11:38] Jeremiah 17:9 says, "The heart is
[1:11:40] deceptive above all things and
[1:11:41] desperately wicked. Who can know it?
[1:11:46] I the Lord search the heart. I try the
[1:11:48] reigns even to give every man according
[1:11:50] to his way and according to the fruit of
[1:11:54] his doings.
[1:11:56] So, how can I really be prepared for the
[1:11:59] coming of the Lord when my heart is so
[1:12:01] deceptive?
[1:12:04] And how can I know it? And I just love
[1:12:07] this proverb. Proverbs 16. Turn with me
[1:12:10] here. Proverbs 16. Write this
[1:12:13] down. The preparations of the heart in
[1:12:16] man and the answer of the tongue is from
[1:12:20] the Lord. So I want to divide this here
[1:12:23] for a second. The preparation of the
[1:12:26] heart of man is actually from the Lord.
[1:12:29] If we're going to get prepared for the
[1:12:32] coming of the Lord, it has to be the
[1:12:34] Lord preparing our heart.
[1:12:37] The word is what has to prepare our
[1:12:40] heart. It can't be us saying we're
[1:12:42] prepared. We're going to take this, not
[1:12:44] take that. We're going to come to church
[1:12:45] here. We're going to we're not going to
[1:12:47] do this. This is what we're going to
[1:12:48] allow. This is what we're not going to
[1:12:49] do. Our kids are going to be able to do
[1:12:51] this, but they can't do that. That is
[1:12:53] not going to prepare you. That's what
[1:12:55] all the denominations are.
[1:12:59] We literally have to take what God gives
[1:13:02] us.
[1:13:05] Yes. what he speaks to our heart from
[1:13:08] his
[1:13:09] word follow it and that's where the
[1:13:13] preparation is made we take ourself out
[1:13:16] of the equation Jesus it's not us making
[1:13:19] a decision what we need to do to be
[1:13:21] ready they that compare themselves with
[1:13:23] themselves is unwise
[1:13:26] what we need to do is take the word take
[1:13:28] the message of the hour and let it
[1:13:30] prepare us
[1:13:34] think Think about the love that God has
[1:13:36] for us. He's not going to leave us
[1:13:37] laying.
[1:13:40] He's going to reach down and he's going
[1:13:42] to help us. I mean, think about it. He
[1:13:44] literally went into the world and picked
[1:13:46] every one of us up out of the world.
[1:13:51] That's right. And if he did that, then
[1:13:54] he's certainly not going to leave us in
[1:13:56] some denominational thought inside the
[1:13:58] message.
[1:14:01] He's not going to let us lay in there
[1:14:03] thinking that we're okay being right
[1:14:05] here when God is calling us to get
[1:14:09] ready.
[1:14:12] Now, think about it. He's he's talking
[1:14:14] to his disciples and you know, he he
[1:14:17] didn't send this message. He didn't say,
[1:14:19] "Brother Ron, you know what? Just be one
[1:14:22] of my disciples here, you know, with me
[1:14:24] and you know, you're going to make it.
[1:14:26] You're going to be in the message.
[1:14:27] you're going to be
[1:14:30] ready.
[1:14:32] No, he's putting some fire under
[1:14:35] everybody that's listening. Look, not
[1:14:37] even the I didn't even tell the angels.
[1:14:41] I ain't going to tell you, but you make
[1:14:42] sure you're ready.
[1:14:45] He puts you in a condition of you better
[1:14:48] make sure. But you know what the devil
[1:14:50] does with Leodysia?
[1:14:53] You're okay. You're you're in. That's
[1:14:55] right. You're in. You're fine. Don't you
[1:14:58] don't have to worry about You don't have
[1:14:59] to change anything.
[1:15:03] No preparation
[1:15:07] needed. The fear of the
[1:15:11] Lord, it's clean. It's what gets us in
[1:15:15] the
[1:15:15] direction. I'm glad that Paul didn't
[1:15:19] say, "I've attained.
[1:15:22] I've
[1:15:23] apprehended. I've got such a connection
[1:15:25] with God.
[1:15:27] He never had that. He never preached
[1:15:31] that. And anytime he preached security
[1:15:33] and I and things like that, he preached
[1:15:37] it on the
[1:15:39] basis of what it really is to be in that
[1:15:42] condition.
[1:15:44] Because even to me when when Paul is
[1:15:47] saying, I press towards the mark, that's
[1:15:48] the same thing as Jesus saying, be be
[1:15:50] also g be ready, be watching, make sure
[1:15:54] same spirit.
[1:15:56] But you understand, we're we're we're
[1:15:58] we're we rub shoulders with a with a
[1:16:01] devil
[1:16:03] on the TV and our cell phones and the
[1:16:05] billboards and the radio and everything
[1:16:07] that we're listening to, the people
[1:16:09] we're talking to, they'll talk to you
[1:16:10] about anything except the coming of the
[1:16:12] Lord.
[1:16:14] And it just weighs on you to the point
[1:16:16] you you're you don't even think about
[1:16:18] his coming. You're thinking about all
[1:16:19] these things that are being talked
[1:16:21] about.
[1:16:24] And then we don't even think about
[1:16:25] getting prepared. We're just so busy.
[1:16:28] How many Let me just be honest with you.
[1:16:30] How many's got more things to do than
[1:16:32] you can possibly get done?
[1:16:37] You know, and it is
[1:16:39] literally discouraging thinking about my
[1:16:42] list. Do you know how hard I got to
[1:16:45] fight not to think about the things I
[1:16:47] got to do?
[1:16:50] I literally have to lay it aside. And I
[1:16:53] know this. I got a revelation of this,
[1:16:54] brother Ron. I got a revelation when
[1:16:56] that Jesus comes. I'm going to have a
[1:16:58] bunch of things left undone.
[1:17:05] There's always going to be something
[1:17:06] needs to be done. Something that needs
[1:17:07] to be fixed. Something needs to be taken
[1:17:09] care of.
[1:17:12] We're never going to get to a place, you
[1:17:15] know, I'm living the retired life.
[1:17:19] I mean that might be for some but for it
[1:17:20] just it just doesn't seem to be that for
[1:17:22] me.
[1:17:26] So we can't wait till we get caught up
[1:17:28] and things are straight in the home and
[1:17:31] things are straight with our health and
[1:17:32] things are straight in the church and
[1:17:34] things are straight with the spouse and
[1:17:37] things are straight with the kids and we
[1:17:38] can finally start preparing oursel.
[1:17:42] That's right.
[1:17:45] No, we just got to let God give us the
[1:17:49] word. Every time we come to church,
[1:17:51] every time we listen to a tape, every
[1:17:54] time we read our
[1:17:55] Bible, he gives us a word. You only need
[1:17:59] one word. I'm going to be honest with
[1:18:01] you. You know how it is. You know how it
[1:18:03] is. If anybody knows about, you know how
[1:18:04] it is how hard it is to sit in this
[1:18:06] church and hear so much preaching in one
[1:18:10] service and you walk as I can't I can't
[1:18:12] I can't I can't get all that. I cannot
[1:18:16] retain all that. That's like too
[1:18:18] much
[1:18:20] right. But if you can just get one thing
[1:18:23] from God that you know it's him speaking
[1:18:25] to you, preparing your heart,
[1:18:29] then he can build off of that.
[1:18:39] The
[1:18:40] preparations of the heart in man. Let's
[1:18:42] go back to that. Proverbs 16:1. And the
[1:18:45] answer of the tongue is from the Lord.
[1:18:48] All the ways of a man are clean in his
[1:18:51] own eyes, but the Lord weighth the
[1:18:54] spirits.
[1:18:56] So commit thy works unto the Lord and
[1:18:59] thy thoughts shall be established.
[1:19:02] I know we all have had times where our
[1:19:06] thoughts just would not settle down.
[1:19:13] All right. John 16:13 says, "How be it,
[1:19:17] when the spirit of truth has come, he
[1:19:18] will guide you into all truth, for he
[1:19:20] shall not speak of himself, but
[1:19:22] whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
[1:19:24] speak, and he will show you things to
[1:19:25] come." So the Holy Spirit in our lives
[1:19:28] is constantly showing us what truth to
[1:19:31] walk in. Now, why is it important to
[1:19:33] walk in truth? Because that is what
[1:19:35] prepares you for his coming.
[1:19:38] If he's coming for a bride without spot
[1:19:40] or wrinkle, that means he's not coming
[1:19:43] for someone who's half-hearted.
[1:19:48] He's not coming for someone who says,
[1:19:49] "If I come to church, I come to church.
[1:19:51] If I don't come to church, I don't go to
[1:19:53] church." Do you think he's coming for
[1:19:54] that bride?
[1:19:56] No. He's coming for that bride that
[1:20:00] says, "I just can't wait till those
[1:20:02] doors are open." Amen.
[1:20:05] Well, brother John, there's just not
[1:20:06] enough entertainment here to get me
[1:20:08] excited.
[1:20:12] I would say that is not a good motive to
[1:20:15] want to get to church.
[1:20:17] I mean, we got churches down the road
[1:20:19] that, you know, have have much
[1:20:23] more much more excitement to the flesh
[1:20:26] than what we have here. That's true. But
[1:20:28] I don't think that God is coming
[1:20:32] back for half of his word. That's right.
[1:20:36] He's coming back for a word bride. The
[1:20:39] brother Brandon said a a a wheat bride,
[1:20:42] a a word bride he's coming back for. And
[1:20:46] so we must have a hunger for all the
[1:20:48] word. Amen. All right. Psalms 10:17.
[1:20:50] Psalms 10:17. The Lord thou has heard
[1:20:55] the desire
[1:20:57] of notice the
[1:21:01] humble. Thou will prepare their heart.
[1:21:05] Thou will cause them to cause thine ear
[1:21:07] to
[1:21:09] hear. Now
[1:21:12] notice, he doesn't prepare the heart of
[1:21:14] the
[1:21:17] proud. In fact, he resists them. Amen.
[1:21:22] He resists the
[1:21:25] proud, but the humble, the desire of the
[1:21:28] humble. Thou has heard the desire of the
[1:21:31] humble. Thou will prepare their heart.
[1:21:35] It's the very desire that we have for
[1:21:38] God,
[1:21:40] that gets us in preparation. Because
[1:21:42] look, if we want to hear the word, he'll
[1:21:44] give it to you. He will.
[1:21:46] If you really want to be like Jesus,
[1:21:49] he'll give you what it takes to be like
[1:21:50] him. But if you're just only interested
[1:21:53] in doing bare bones minimum,
[1:22:01] come on.
[1:22:03] How can he prepare that heart? You're
[1:22:06] not going to hear all the
[1:22:09] word. All right. John 14:1, "Let not
[1:22:13] your heart be troubled." Do you believe
[1:22:15] in God? believe also in me. In my
[1:22:17] father's house are many mansions. If it
[1:22:19] were not so, I would have told you. I go
[1:22:22] to prepare a place for you. What a
[1:22:26] vindication that God is the one that
[1:22:29] prepares our heart for him.
[1:22:33] He's going right inside of us to prepare
[1:22:36] our heart so he can live inside of us
[1:22:38] the way he wants to.
[1:22:41] He says, ' And if I go and prepare a
[1:22:43] place for you, I will come again and I
[1:22:45] will receive you unto myself, that where
[1:22:47] I am, there you may be also. I believe
[1:22:49] there's like a communion of what's going
[1:22:51] on inside of us in that day. You'll know
[1:22:54] that I'm in you and you and me. And
[1:22:56] there there will be a a a union taking
[1:22:59] place. You just know when God speaks to
[1:23:02] you, you just know.
[1:23:05] I mean, sometimes they're much stronger
[1:23:07] than others and sometimes it's a little
[1:23:08] bit fain. But obviously, when it comes
[1:23:11] to this
[1:23:13] relationship, you're going to know
[1:23:15] because if we're not prepared to meet
[1:23:19] the Lord, if we're not prepared to meet
[1:23:22] our God, God wants us to get
[1:23:25] prepared. And the the the the the
[1:23:27] calling that the Holy Spirit is calling
[1:23:30] out to us is receive the humble
[1:23:35] heart that makes you desire my word
[1:23:39] because that's the only thing that can
[1:23:40] make us ready. The word that the the
[1:23:43] church can't, my wife
[1:23:46] can't, my husband can't. Not that I have
[1:23:50] a husband, but you understand what I'm
[1:23:54] saying. It's the word.
[1:23:57] The word is what makes us
[1:24:02] ready. Now, how we become prepared for
[1:24:06] God's
[1:24:06] coming is allowing God's word to to work
[1:24:10] inside of our heart.
[1:24:14] We come to church, we hear the word. You
[1:24:15] know, you see some people, they're
[1:24:17] they're just they're over here, they're
[1:24:19] over there.
[1:24:21] But when you come to church and you
[1:24:24] truly
[1:24:25] want all the word, that's who God is
[1:24:30] looking
[1:24:31] at. It's that desire that we have. The
[1:24:34] humble will, the humble, the humble will
[1:24:38] desire that word to come inside and God
[1:24:41] will break it to them and that when they
[1:24:44] leave, they literally care about God
[1:24:47] more than when they
[1:24:48] came.
[1:24:50] Our lives can only produce the word
[1:24:54] according to our hearts are prepared.
[1:24:57] So, let's turn to Matthew and 13 and
[1:24:59] just take a look at that and then we're
[1:25:00] going to read some quotes real quick and
[1:25:02] and and
[1:25:05] uh try to get done uh speedily here. But
[1:25:10] we understand that no matter how good
[1:25:12] the word is that's being preached, if
[1:25:14] our heart is not prepared properly, then
[1:25:18] it can't bring forth in our life. Amen.
[1:25:21] All right. So, starting with verse 13 of
[1:25:23] Matthew 13. And he spake to them many
[1:25:27] things unto them in parables, saying,
[1:25:28] Behold, a sword went forth to sow, and
[1:25:30] when he sowed, some seeds fell by the
[1:25:32] wayside, and the fowls of uh came and
[1:25:36] devoured them, and some fell on stony
[1:25:38] places.
[1:25:39] And they that uh where there had not
[1:25:42] much earth, and for with they sprung up,
[1:25:44] and because there was no depthness of
[1:25:46] earth, and when the sun was up, they
[1:25:48] were scorched. And because they had no
[1:25:51] root, they withered away, and some fell
[1:25:52] among thorns, thorns sprung up, and
[1:25:55] choked them. Now others fell on good
[1:25:57] ground, brought forth fruit, and some a
[1:25:59] 100fold, 60fold, and some 30fold. Who
[1:26:02] have ears to hear, let him hear. So here
[1:26:03] it is. The same word, the same seed word
[1:26:06] fell on four different types of
[1:26:09] hearts, heart
[1:26:12] conditions. And obviously by this
[1:26:15] parable that Jesus is giving, it's not
[1:26:18] important that you're just hearing the
[1:26:20] pure
[1:26:22] word. It's not good enough. It's not
[1:26:25] good enough to come in church and have
[1:26:26] confidence that you're hearing the pure
[1:26:28] word.
[1:26:30] It's more important, I'm going to tell
[1:26:32] you this. It's more important that your
[1:26:34] heart is prepared
[1:26:37] because God knows how to get the word to
[1:26:39] his bride.
[1:26:43] He knows how to do that.
[1:26:46] But he
[1:26:47] cannot take your heart and give you
[1:26:52] preparation if you don't care enough to
[1:26:56] want only God's word in your heart.
[1:26:59] Can you say amen? Amen. So you'll never
[1:27:03] never never make bride if you stay a
[1:27:05] stony heart. If your heart is always
[1:27:07] hard,
[1:27:09] always bothered about things, can't just
[1:27:13] let go of things, hardness, things
[1:27:15] towards
[1:27:18] others, you'll never be able to fit the
[1:27:21] bride. Somewhere down the road, that
[1:27:24] heart has to be
[1:27:25] changed. You have to soften your heart.
[1:27:30] You'll never make bride if your heart is
[1:27:33] full of thorns, full of the things of
[1:27:36] the world, the cares of this life. So
[1:27:38] focused on life that the only thing you
[1:27:40] could do is focus on work, focus on the
[1:27:42] cares of life, focus on the things of
[1:27:45] the world.
[1:27:48] How can we become bride? We'll never
[1:27:51] bring forth 30, 60, 100fold.
[1:27:54] We've got to get to the place where we
[1:27:56] change that up.
[1:27:59] We just don't come in and sit down and
[1:28:00] let the word whatever is preached. Just
[1:28:02] see what happens.
[1:28:04] Got to get away from that attitude. Get
[1:28:06] get serious with God. Get mature with
[1:28:08] God. I'm I'm here to to meet my God. If
[1:28:13] you learn to meet God at church, you'll
[1:28:15] be able to meet him in the air.
[1:28:18] You just can't come here half-hearted
[1:28:20] expect. Well, yeah, you're coming. I'm
[1:28:22] getting you.
[1:28:27] All right, let's drop down to verse
[1:28:32] 18. Either hear ye therefore the parable
[1:28:36] of the swer. When one when anyone
[1:28:39] heareth the word of the kingdom, and
[1:28:41] understandeth it
[1:28:43] not, then cometh the wicked one, and
[1:28:45] catcheth away that which was sown in his
[1:28:48] heart. This is he that receiveth seed by
[1:28:50] the wayside. But he that receiveth seed
[1:28:53] into stony places, the same is he that
[1:28:55] heareth the word and and a nonan with
[1:28:59] joy receive it. Yet he's not a very deep
[1:29:04] Christian.
[1:29:06] Does not have root in himself.
[1:29:08] But
[1:29:10] he but he endureth for a while. There's
[1:29:12] just a season that he's able to rejoice
[1:29:16] and be happy and and and be on fire as
[1:29:19] it were. But then when trials come for
[1:29:23] when tribulation and
[1:29:26] persecution even in the home our homes
[1:29:30] ariseth because of the word by and by he
[1:29:34] is
[1:29:36] offended. I shouldn't have to go through
[1:29:38] this. I shouldn't have to put up with
[1:29:39] this. I shouldn't have to deal with
[1:29:40] this. This shouldn't happen in our
[1:29:42] church. This shouldn't happen in our
[1:29:44] home. This shouldn't happen in my
[1:29:46] job. This should not happen.
[1:29:49] I can't take it. It's not right. I quit.
[1:29:59] No root.
[1:30:02] We need to stay with the word. The word
[1:30:04] says, "I will not put anything on you
[1:30:05] that you can't bear." That's the word.
[1:30:09] Amen.
[1:30:12] The problem is instead of just trusting
[1:30:15] the word, we want to rewrite the Bible.
[1:30:19] We're going to do it my way. We're going
[1:30:20] to do it the Frank Sinatra way.
[1:30:25] He also that receiveth seed among thorns
[1:30:27] is he that heareth the word and the
[1:30:28] cares of this world, and the
[1:30:29] deceitfulness of riches choke the word,
[1:30:32] and he becometh unfruitful. So, we'll
[1:30:35] never be able to
[1:30:37] come to the bride that we need to be
[1:30:40] with those things in our life. Look at
[1:30:42] the rich young ruler. He had everything
[1:30:43] going for him, but one of these things
[1:30:45] stood in the way
[1:30:49] and he said no to
[1:30:51] Jesus. But he that receiveth seed into
[1:30:54] the good ground is he that heareth the
[1:30:55] word. He understands
[1:30:58] it. He also bears fruit and he brings
[1:31:01] forth some 100fold, some 60 and some 30.
[1:31:05] Praise God. I believe that the gospel
[1:31:07] should be changing our lives every time
[1:31:09] we hear it from glory onto glory. We
[1:31:12] should not be battling whether we want
[1:31:14] to listen to the word. We should not be
[1:31:16] going to church just because it's
[1:31:18] church.
[1:31:21] We should be going to church because we
[1:31:22] can't wait to get in God's presence.
[1:31:24] That is the truth. I got some some
[1:31:27] quotes here. If I could just end with
[1:31:30] these. Believe our number one
[1:31:32] responsibility of getting ready is to
[1:31:36] get the very life of God in us.
[1:31:39] Without that, we're never going to get
[1:31:40] ready. That is the first and most
[1:31:41] important thing. In the message, the
[1:31:43] token, brother Bam says, see many people
[1:31:46] wants to be Christians and they like to
[1:31:49] do it secretly so nobody would know that
[1:31:52] they were Christians. Amen. Want to be a
[1:31:55] Christian, but I don't want so and so to
[1:31:57] know about it. See? Well, now you see
[1:31:59] that's not Christianity.
[1:32:02] Christianity has to be displayed its
[1:32:06] token.
[1:32:08] See publicly almost I would say almost
[1:32:11] like baptism in public life at the
[1:32:14] office on the streets when trouble is
[1:32:17] around anything in church everywhere
[1:32:20] else. The blood is the token and the
[1:32:23] token must be applied. See even he said
[1:32:26] if it's not even the covenant is not in
[1:32:30] effect.
[1:32:32] The blood was a token or an
[1:32:35] identification identifying that this
[1:32:37] person has been redeemed. So without the
[1:32:40] life of Christ on display, that this is
[1:32:42] what we're really going to live in our
[1:32:44] home, in our church, this is how we're
[1:32:46] going to
[1:32:51] be. We won't we won't be able to be
[1:32:55] prepared for his
[1:32:58] coming. The token, I believe, is the
[1:33:01] most important thing. We need to have
[1:33:03] the life of Christ applied to us. Yes.
[1:33:07] He also went on to say in that same
[1:33:09] message, that's what you must do, Pastor
[1:33:13] Neville, and to this congregation and to
[1:33:16] the trustees and to the deacons and to
[1:33:18] you, brethren. It's time that we laid
[1:33:20] aside all the foolishness of the world,
[1:33:23] Jesus. Time we laid aside everything
[1:33:25] else. We've seen enough now to we're all
[1:33:30] positive, sure, and that the token must
[1:33:33] be applied. That without it, you're
[1:33:35] going to perish. You must perish. That's
[1:33:37] the only thing.
[1:33:39] I love that he was speaking to brother
[1:33:41] Neville to the trustees, to the deacons.
[1:33:46] In other words, this was a message to
[1:33:48] the world.
[1:33:53] We must have the token.
[1:33:55] That's part of being ready. We must get
[1:33:58] serious about getting more of the Holy
[1:34:00] Ghost.
[1:34:02] More Holy Ghost means more life. Amen.
[1:34:06] In another message, the token, brother
[1:34:09] Brandon says, if the token or the blood
[1:34:11] in the time of Egypt coming out of their
[1:34:13] Exodus, if the token was so supreme sign
[1:34:17] that it was not good unless the token
[1:34:19] was displayed, the token had to be on
[1:34:22] display, not a
[1:34:25] sympathizer with the token,
[1:34:29] but the token must be applied. Not just
[1:34:31] saying, "Oh, yeah, I believe in the
[1:34:33] token." Yeah.
[1:34:35] It must be
[1:34:40] applied. In order for the life of Christ
[1:34:42] to come forth and manifest the token, we
[1:34:45] must die daily. Jesus said in the me in
[1:34:49] the message Christ is revealed in his
[1:34:51] own word. I think we got this one up
[1:34:52] here. I don't put many quotes up here
[1:34:54] because I just I don't get thinking
[1:34:56] about doing it, but we got this one up
[1:34:58] here. The thing that's the matter with
[1:35:00] the message today is those who obtain it
[1:35:04] in their hearts must lay in the presence
[1:35:08] of the sun
[1:35:10] to get ripened.
[1:35:13] So you you you take the message, you lay
[1:35:14] it in your heart, and then you spend
[1:35:16] time in prayer. You let the word you let
[1:35:20] the presence of the Holy Spirit in
[1:35:22] church, in your home, in your room begin
[1:35:24] to soften you. You know what happens to
[1:35:27] fruit that's real hard, right? A banana
[1:35:29] car apple, orange, um a pear, you if you
[1:35:35] eat it hard, it's not even really ready,
[1:35:37] right? So the fruit has to get ready.
[1:35:40] And brother Brandham saying you got to
[1:35:42] lay in the presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:46] and get ripened. See, you can pick up
[1:35:49] the message and then let the sun bake
[1:35:53] all all the greenness out of you. see
[1:35:56] making mature Christians. In other
[1:35:59] words, you're not a mature Christian as
[1:36:02] long as the world just keeps coming out
[1:36:04] of you. Every time there's a problem,
[1:36:07] there's a maturity to it. See, it's not
[1:36:09] just saying, "I'm in the message. I've
[1:36:10] been baptized." See what I mean? God is
[1:36:13] coming
[1:36:14] soon to receive his church. And we must
[1:36:18] have that type of Christians for him to
[1:36:21] receive. The wheat has got to get ripe.
[1:36:24] All right. Isn't that a good quote?
[1:36:29] In the message of man running from the
[1:36:30] presence of the Lord, we're just talking
[1:36:32] about the responsibility of what we need
[1:36:35] to make sure we're ready for the coming
[1:36:37] of the
[1:36:38] Lord. Part of it is number one, getting
[1:36:42] the token applied, getting God applied
[1:36:44] to your life.
[1:36:46] But then you can't just have God in your
[1:36:49] life and then go live your life. Lord,
[1:36:53] you literally now have to start working
[1:36:55] for Jesus Christ.
[1:36:58] And brother Rand says in the message, a
[1:36:59] man running from the president's Lord
[1:37:01] and and the responsibility that God has
[1:37:03] given to us today, given to us in this
[1:37:06] day is to bring this
[1:37:09] message. So we got to get this message
[1:37:11] to other people. When's the last time
[1:37:13] you told somebody about the message?
[1:37:16] As I get older and I know my days are
[1:37:19] shortening up, I feel the responsibility
[1:37:22] greater than I've ever felt
[1:37:25] pressing on. We must do it. We must get
[1:37:28] down to it everywhere we go and tell the
[1:37:30] message and tell the people that Jesus
[1:37:33] is
[1:37:34] coming and he's God and he's coming
[1:37:37] soon.
[1:37:40] There's not a hope left in the world but
[1:37:42] the coming of the Lord. I believe that
[1:37:44] this is part of the preparation that we
[1:37:47] need to be doing. We need to be on the
[1:37:48] same page that God is.
[1:37:50] Right? If God is telling me to get
[1:37:53] ready, then if I receive God, I'm going
[1:37:55] to be sharing with others to get ready.
[1:37:58] And the message convinced and
[1:38:01] concerned. Brother Brandon says, "I
[1:38:03] don't know who they are. Only he does.
[1:38:06] My business is to sew the seeds. I don't
[1:38:08] know where they're falling, but I just
[1:38:11] sow it." God's confirming wherever it
[1:38:14] hits and it strikes like that quickly.
[1:38:17] It comes to life. It's in good soil. If
[1:38:21] it's on the rock, I can't help it. Some
[1:38:24] denominational foundation, I can't help
[1:38:26] that. The only thing I just keep sewing
[1:38:29] seeds. I know he's coming. I believe it.
[1:38:34] And I want to live for that. I'm
[1:38:35] convinced that he's coming. I'm
[1:38:37] convinced that he's coming soon. I am.
[1:38:40] Brother Brandon was convinced he's
[1:38:42] coming soon. You know, that happened how
[1:38:44] many years ago that he preached that.
[1:38:47] But I believe what he preached was right
[1:38:50] because we look at coming soon is you
[1:38:52] know um service is going to be over very
[1:38:55] soon.
[1:38:58] And we got it must be almost nine
[1:39:01] o'clock. He's coming soon. Service is
[1:39:04] over. But you know I I I feel we need to
[1:39:08] have a spirit. He's coming soon.
[1:39:13] Not not be some sort of um DDL or some
[1:39:18] very intellectual person in the message
[1:39:20] that's going to put together a few
[1:39:22] things, some quotes, some things that
[1:39:24] are happening in the world and tell you
[1:39:25] when you think he tell you when he
[1:39:27] thinks God is coming.
[1:39:30] I don't think that's what God is
[1:39:32] wanting. God is wanting us to have a
[1:39:34] spirit that we know he's coming soon. We
[1:39:36] don't got much time. Let's put
[1:39:38] everything we got into this. Tell others
[1:39:41] about it.
[1:39:44] Last quote. Remember one time I had a
[1:39:49] meeting. Another time he preached
[1:39:52] convinced and concerned. There was a a
[1:39:54] farmer that got saved and filled with
[1:39:56] the Holy Ghost. And he only had nothing
[1:40:00] but his experience in a truck.
[1:40:03] And he hauled so many to the meeting, he
[1:40:06] got 30 more filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:08] Why? He was convinced.
[1:40:12] And when he was convinced, he was
[1:40:14] concerned. A little daughter got healed.
[1:40:18] He had sick people every night, a truck
[1:40:20] full of them, bringing them in from
[1:40:21] everywhere. 30 got the Holy Ghost. See,
[1:40:24] he was convinced that it was right. So,
[1:40:28] he was concerned about somebody else.
[1:40:31] And if we're concerned that Jesus is
[1:40:33] coming soon, we'll be concerned about
[1:40:36] our lost loved ones.
[1:40:40] We'll be doing all we can to get the
[1:40:42] gospel out. End of quote. We need a
[1:40:46] vision.
[1:40:47] We need a vision that Jesus is coming
[1:40:49] soon.
[1:40:51] No one's No one wants you to to pick a
[1:40:53] date, but everybody wants you to see
[1:40:55] you. Everybody wants to see one another
[1:40:58] with this spirit of he's coming soon.
[1:41:00] Let's get get all we can. Let's get
[1:41:02] serious about this thing. Let let's pray
[1:41:04] for one another. You're witnessing to
[1:41:06] somebody. Tell somebody so they they can
[1:41:08] begin to pray with you about this soul
[1:41:10] and begin to generate something more
[1:41:13] than just living selfish life.
[1:41:17] Jesus is coming soon. Yes. I got three
[1:41:21] four verses I want to read if we put
[1:41:23] them up. Revelations 22:7 and then we're
[1:41:25] closing.
[1:41:27] Behold, I come
[1:41:29] quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the
[1:41:31] sayings of the prophecy of this
[1:41:34] book. Verse 18, for I testify unto every
[1:41:38] man that heareth the words of the
[1:41:39] prophecy of this book. If any man shall
[1:41:41] add unto these things, God shall add to
[1:41:43] him the plagues that are written in this
[1:41:44] book. And if any man shall take away the
[1:41:46] words of the book of this prophecy, God
[1:41:48] shall take away as part of the book of
[1:41:50] life. Now the holy city, and from the
[1:41:52] things which are written in this book,
[1:41:54] he that testifith these things saith,
[1:41:56] surely, I come
[1:41:59] quickly. Even so, come Lord Jesus. Now,
[1:42:03] we know God don't
[1:42:05] lie. I believe that every person that's
[1:42:09] been born, God has wanted them to have a
[1:42:11] spirit that that says Jesus is coming
[1:42:14] quickly and we need to get ready.
[1:42:19] That's right. That's what that'll do.
[1:42:20] That'll get us concerned about other
[1:42:22] people's souls rather than about our own
[1:42:25] natural life.
[1:42:27] Let's stand
[1:42:33] together. How many believe Jesus is
[1:42:36] coming?
[1:42:41] Amen. Let's let's bow and just go before
[1:42:45] the Lord in prayer. just unite our our
[1:42:47] heart and our faith. Our heavenly
[1:42:50] father, today we stand
[1:42:53] here completely by your
[1:42:57] grace. It is your grace that that we're
[1:43:01] even connected to you,
[1:43:06] Lord. We think about the many people
[1:43:08] that we know of that we've shared the
[1:43:11] gospel with and they're out in the
[1:43:14] world. They said, "No, they're not
[1:43:17] serving you,
[1:43:18] Lord." And we think, "How how could
[1:43:22] we be here
[1:43:27] chosen? It's all your grace,
[1:43:30] Lord. Completely your
[1:43:33] grace." And now, Lord, we're asking that
[1:43:36] you would take this little body
[1:43:43] here, Lord, and that you would instill
[1:43:45] within us an
[1:43:49] urgency of your of your coming,
[1:43:52] Lord, not to be waiting for some great
[1:43:57] external thing to be happening for us to
[1:44:01] be thinking about getting
[1:44:05] ready. Lord, we remember the the wave
[1:44:09] that went
[1:44:10] over America and perhaps other parts of
[1:44:13] the world when the Twin Towers went down
[1:44:15] and many were praying more than they
[1:44:18] ever did before and rightly
[1:44:21] so. But Lord, we're asking that you
[1:44:25] would just put within our heart a
[1:44:27] greater love for you,
[1:44:32] Lord. that we would want to just lay in
[1:44:35] your presence and become more
[1:44:39] ripened, become more
[1:44:43] mature. That Lord, if there's only one
[1:44:45] in the city, it'll be us. If there's
[1:44:47] only one in our town, it' be us. If
[1:44:49] there be only one in our home, it'd be
[1:44:50] us. If it be only one in the church, it'
[1:44:52] be
[1:44:53] us. Not that we want anyone to miss it,
[1:44:55] but Lord, what we do want is we want to
[1:44:57] be a shining light with the things of
[1:44:59] the world. We've made up our minds.
[1:45:01] We're standing with
[1:45:04] you and Lord that by your grace we're
[1:45:09] we're being molded into your image
[1:45:11] service after
[1:45:13] service. God I pray that you bless your
[1:45:16] bride here. Each brother, each sister,
[1:45:19] each home, each young
[1:45:22] person. Oh mighty God, raise us up.
[1:45:27] Raise us up. Lord, may this though this
[1:45:30] service will be over soon, may this
[1:45:33] message continually be spoken to our
[1:45:36] heart in the days to come that you're
[1:45:39] coming soon, Lord. You're coming soon
[1:45:42] and you're wanting us to get ready.
[1:45:45] You're wanting us to be ready. You want
[1:45:46] us to watch. You want us to
[1:45:49] pray. You want us to be
[1:45:51] aware. And Lord, when we do
[1:45:55] feel comfortably that we are ready to
[1:45:59] meet you, I pray that you would use us
[1:46:02] to get the word out to other
[1:46:04] people because there's others that are
[1:46:06] not as fortunate as that are not ready
[1:46:08] to meet you. And I pray that you would
[1:46:11] use our heart, use our mind, use our
[1:46:14] lips, use our hands, use our feet. Yes.
[1:46:17] use us to to to reach others and let
[1:46:21] them know that you're coming soon.
[1:46:25] Lord, please bless us. Please bless this
[1:46:28] church, Lord. God, we pray. We commit
[1:46:32] oursel to you. We give you our lives. We
[1:46:34] give you ourselves. We give you
[1:46:36] ourselves as a
[1:46:37] body. Hold us
[1:46:40] up. Bless our homes. Meet the needs in
[1:46:43] our homes, Lord. Oh, God. and meet the
[1:46:46] needs in our home that we may be a
[1:46:49] better church when we come together.
[1:46:51] Bless our young people. Put a hedge of
[1:46:53] protection around them all in the
[1:46:55] schools and in the yards and the where
[1:46:57] they live in the stores, wherever they
[1:46:59] might be, Lord, in the phones. God, we
[1:47:02] just need the Holy Ghost protection.
[1:47:06] Looking to you, Lord. We're looking to
[1:47:08] you.
[1:47:10] be with the with the many Lord that are
[1:47:13] not here
[1:47:15] tonight
[1:47:17] watching praying right now
[1:47:20] Lord grant them the desires of their
[1:47:23] heart Lord
[1:47:24] Jesus bless them meet every need
[1:47:28] heavenly father those Lord that are not
[1:47:32] watching those Lord that haven't been to
[1:47:34] church in a while those that have
[1:47:35] visited and left God we pray be merciful
[1:47:38] to them and call them. Yes,
[1:47:43] Lord. In this late dangerous hour that
[1:47:46] we're living in,
[1:47:48] may you remind them to prepare
[1:47:51] themselves to meet their God. Yes.
[1:47:54] Granted, Father, we thank you for these
[1:47:57] things now. We pray them in Jesus
[1:47:59] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:06] Without him, I could do
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:14] nothing.
[1:48:17] Without him, I'd
[1:48:19] surely fail.
[1:48:24] Without him, I would be
[1:48:31] drifting like a
[1:48:34] ship.
[1:48:35] Without a sail. One more
[1:48:40] time.
[1:48:42] Without him, I could do nothing.
[1:48:51] Without him, I'd surely
[1:48:55] [Applause]
[1:48:57] fail. Without him, I would be
[1:49:06] drifting like a
[1:49:08] ship
[1:49:10] without a sand.
[1:49:18] out. Oh
[1:49:21] Jesus, do you know him today? Please
[1:49:27] don't turn him
[1:49:30] away.
[1:49:33] Jesus. Oh
[1:49:37] Jesus. Without
[1:49:41] him I would be here.
[1:49:46] Amen. He's all I need today. He's all I
[1:49:58] need. He's
[1:50:01] all I

[1:50:38] He's all I

[1:53:14] Amen. Are you depending on him?
[1:53:19] Totally. Completely depending on him.
[1:53:23] And did you know that Jesus uses other
[1:53:26] people?
[1:53:29] Amen. So, we must remember to see Jesus
[1:53:33] in one another. Amen. Let's sing one
[1:53:36] more uh song here before we leave the
[1:53:41] sanctuary today. Let's leave with the
[1:53:45] love of
