we're just going to read one verse of scripture there this is our our last service preaching service this year amen it's been quite a year isn't it amen let's just look to the Lord in prayer and ask His blessings at this time Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence we thank you Lord that you have come to visit us we thank you for this opportunity to worship you to praise you and Lord we want to give you the praise that you're worthy of for you've been so good to us been so gracious so merciful Lord as we approach you we know that we're we're just mere Sinners that have been saved by your grace and from the day that you saved us even though we know it was from the foundation of the world the day that we recognized you and repented of our sins we have fallen so many times and Lord it seems the closer we get into your presence the more that we recognize we are just people of unclean lips we lord well amongst the others that are unclean and we're not worthy to come into thy holy presence we ask that you'd take the blood today the co off the fire touch our lips our heart sanctify us Lord prepare us for such a perfect holy word to come and dwell in our hearts that we may become the word manifested in flesh once again in this time Lord you know as we stand here praying Lord you've asked us to forgive Lord we at this time forgive those Lord that have trespassed against us Lord we stand here in needy people needy of more of view we're helpless with without you lord we can do nothing we're certainly like a a ship without a sail we we become so confused and uh don't know which way to turn and what to do but Lord You're the Peace of of our soul you're the Peace of our mind you are the answer to all of our needs and we ask that you'd come in the furtherance of this service Lord bless your word to a heart pray a special blessing for those that are live streaming today Lord that they may feel your presence in such a a special way today Lord they need you heavenly father they need to feel your presence they need to feel the the presence as Lord being gathered together with brothers and and sisters let them feel it today Lord your presence just makes up the difference Lord we ask that as your word comes forth that you direct our lives that you encourage us and strengthen us Lord and help us along this journey bless this word to each heart now as we commit this service in your hands we humbly pray in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen Isaiah chapter 43 just one verse verse number 18 remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old amen God bless you may be seated remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old this thought came on our heart when we were up north and uh last night we were sitting at the table and as I was sitting there brother Mark was to my left as he is today and he says I wonder what things will remember what things we'll forget when we're in heaven and when we get on the other side little did he know our message this morning was learning to forget want to entitled this message learning to forget there are things that we need to learn to forget and there are things that we need to learn to remember Malachi 3:6 says then they then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it in a book of remance was written for before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name so God wants us to remember everyone that fears God and that talks about the good things of the Lord Isaiah 49: vers 15 can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet will I not forget thee amen behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hand amen God wants us to remember certain things we'll call them important things things like Proverbs 3:1 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments he doesn't want us to forget the law verse number three let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the tables of thy heart he wants Mercy to be inside of us around us and Truth amen Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse5 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently not just once in a while not just at church right that's right Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou wst by the way and when thou liest down when thou riseth up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes can't miss them and thou shalt write them upon the pulse of the house and on thy Gates God does not want us to forget the importance that we should love the Lord with everything that we have and teach it to our family our wives teach it to our husband teach it to our children our children teach it to our parents just keep it going amen amen 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1 just laying a a a Long Foundation as you have have learned by now moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand today by the which you are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you had believed in vain so it's important not to just come to church and for the moment understand what is being said to kind of agree with what's being said but what's important when you come to church is to take the word with you you know the parable about the bird that came by and he took what was swn in the person's heart the word that was actually sown in the heart and we we got to take it we got to we got we got to eat the word we got to become the word and we we cannot just you know forget the things of God God doesn't want us to forget about calvary or all the things that he has done for us personally he certainly doesn't want us to forget his word the word that is preached to us James chapter 1 verse 22 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourself for for man be hear of the word not a doer is like unto a man beholding his natural face in the glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgiveth that's right what manner of man he was so God does not want us to just forget when we get conviction and God speaks to us and we feel that we need to start praying more or reaching out more or spending more time uh washing somebody's feet or whatever it is that God's dealing with we need to remember to put those things and not forget those things amen that's right 1 Timothy 4:6 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and Doctrine where to thou has attained so God wants us to put these things in remembrance one with another the body washing the body helping one another get keeping things going on the right track God has certain things that he wants us to remember amen I believe God does never wants us to forget who we are amen that we belong to God and that he is calling us and transforming us into the image of Jesus Christ there are things that God wants us to learn how to forget that's right for a subject today I want to take the first step in moving forward is forgetting the past as far as our last service for 2020 I would like to say this I'm glad 2020 is over it's been a very discouraging year it started out with a pandemic that quickly escalated into a world of panic and fear it's rippled even into next year and maybe for the years to come it rocked our nation's economy with multiple shutdowns for the first time in my 60 years I was commanded to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of an unknown virus for the first time time in 60 years I was commanded to stay away from other human life and they call it social distancing it has brought distress upon Nations as Jesus taught as a snare It Came Upon the face of the Earth anxiety Rose drastically it has caused depression to increase divorce to increase suicide to increase a Madness of hate has increased leing this world in a greater state of fear and uncertainty Luke 21: 26 Jesus said men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and I I you could just tell everybody's wondering what else is going to happen what's coming next how bad is this going to happen men's hearts are failing for fear it's caused many churches to not be able to meet worship together I want to say I'm glad 2020 is over we all could come up with a list of reasons why we want to put this year behind us but it's really hard for anyone to move forward when there's such an uncertainty about the future now this is what we're all facing and it's even harder to move forward when our present state is exactly the same as our past it's no different with our spiritual walk with the Lord the first step in moving forward with Christ is to leave your past in the past you cannot move forward in faith when you're hanging on to your past in our opening scripture in Isaiah remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old there are four things I want to focus on this morning that we need to learn to forget one is your sins second is your brother's sins third is your achievements that's good and the fourth is your sufferings your past sins if there's one important thing that you must practice is learning to forget is your past your past sins your transgressions your iniquities your shortcomings if we've repented if and we believe then Jesus can't even remember them if you don't put them behind you they're always next to you they're always standing in the way Ephesians 4:31 just pulling some scriptures here we're going to kind of move a little fast if it's okay let all bitterness and wrath and anger and Glamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice so put it away don't keep it with you get it away Colossians chapter 3 verse 8 Colossians chapter 3:8 but now he also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth get it in the past put it away from you put it behind you get it away from your life get it out of your mind away from your thoughts amen that's good if you allow Satan to keep your mistakes in the Forefront of your mind they will most definitely keep you from moving for forward in God they will lead you away from Victory they will lead you away from Joy from peace you won't feel strong enough to move forward into the things that God has for you so don't allow Satan to keep you stuck in your past his job is he wants to keep you there Jonah was stuck in his past he made a decision to do his own will instead of following through with what God had asked him to do which was be a witness for him that's right and no matter what he did where he went or how hard he tried he really couldn't move forward he was stuck in his mind because of a wrong decision that haunted him every single day right so with a a last ditch effort to try to get rid of this thing he he went down to and found a ship going to tarus and we all know the story of Jonah he could not Escape his past sin that he made and I don't think God wanted him to praise God he was finally thrown overboard you know the story Satan had tormented Jonah about the sin to his Bitter End Jonah got selfish with his his personal will he got angry and rebellious against God and he ran from God and from doing his will now that's what happened to Jonah and that thing kept him from being able to move forward no matter where he went what he did what he tried to do he couldn't escape that in his mind so what did Jonah do he forgot about his former decision that he made of his own will he repented and he turned around by changing his decision he remembered not the former thing he considered not that dumb decision that he made of old amen the Bible says that Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God and out of the fish's belly he cried by the reason of his Affliction unto the Lord so I'll say no matter how stuck you are in your situation how much seaweeds is wrapped around your head you're not [Music] stuck I don't care how many times you blown up got upset said something you said you shouldn't have said you're not stuck they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercies let the past be the past if you allow the devil to sit there and say this is really who you are you're nothing but a no download good you're no Christian you're just a sit or faking it as long as you stay there you're forsaken the mercies that God has for you you can't expect to be perfect right we don't uh we're not acting like we're perfect people we serve a perfect God who perfectly forgives us that's the only thing that's perfect [Music] am the blood makes us perfect don't allow Satan to keep you stuck in your past no matter what sin you have sinned come on don't even go there it will keep you from the victory of moving forward in Christ which is what God's will is for your life he doesn't sit up there in a book and write down what degree of a sinner you are this weeken or what degree of a of a Christian you are this week it's simple you're covered with the blood or you're not you're forgiven or you're not there is nothing in between the whole church could get into a a a situation where they're just uh caught up in in in in a spot that they can't move forward because look alls we are in this church is a combination of what we are in our homes we ain't anything different than that so you bring your problems here we just got more problems in the church you bring your doubts here we got more doubts in the church but if you bring more expectation hey God can move We Are Who We Are this church is what we are and it's okay how you are but you must come with an expectation that this hospital has a doctor amen that can meet every need that we have and it comes through faith it does not come through feeling it does not come through emotion it's by faith Lord especially after this year we could get stuck in a in in and be tormented with just doubts and fears by the Devils every single time we come to church anybody ever been bombarded with well it's just going to be the same old same old that little gentle thought tell me is that the expectation that is anti only belief so we can sing only believe or we can only believe I'd rather only believe than sing only believe now we can't do both but we create an atmosphere amen I don't want to get stuck stuck in that state the devil saying oh you can't get the Holy Ghost you can't overcome that you can't get healed you can't be delivered you've gone too far you've already got upset today before you got to church oh you'll never walk in the spirit right we all have our own goliaths in the land that we got to take out or never possess it we got to slay them the Bible says that Goliath of gath was a champion from the camp of the Philistines who drew near the camp every morning and every evening for 40 days and he stood and he cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together I want you to think about being tormented every day for 40 days now forget 40 days because some of us it's been you know 40 months but I'm gonna yeah yeah that's right brother but this is why I say that word 40 it just all it's doing at this point is representing tribulation not a certain amount of time but it's the same thing over and over haunting you you're stuck in a situation that you just can't seem to break through from and everyone in the church camp was paralyzed by the giant demon tormenting their minds every single day I defy you being a Believer and trusting in the promises of God I defy you being an overcomer trusting God to overcome your situation I defy you being able to withstand the doubts in flares that that flood our minds Now That's what Satan does every single time and we get scared we just sit there we're afraid to say Amen afraid to say I believe this word with all my heart I believe this message I'll live for it I'll die for it I'll stand for I will manifest it so we just sit there and we just okay if you say so as long as their mind was stayed on their former problem it paralyzed them they couldn't do anything they just stood there they had no plan day after day and as long as our minds are kept considering the them things of old in our lives we'll never be able to move forward in Christ we've got to free oursel from the past before we can move forward free oursel from the past amen don't allow the devil to keep fear in your mind keeping you from freedom God wants to set us free I'll tell you I've been set free but I've also been called in bondage by the snare of the devil and he's he's just walking around seeking who may devour wants to put a snare on somebody it's his job and I don't see anywhere in the Bible where God has ever asked you to be perfect from the day that you gave your heart to the day you leave here I see a whole book just trying to tell us which way to go what to do in our present situations and to let us know that we have an expected End Amen so we need to learn to forget the former things the things of old and move forward in godall David would not allow his mind to be suppressed by the thoughts of bondage that were coming from all the people that were around him just that negativity he had the correct mindset as brother Bram said the right mental attitude and you know what he had what he needed to take care of their paralyzed problem he said who is this unbeliever that he should defy the armies of the Living God David said let no man's heart fail because of this Spirit God has not given us the spirit of fear amen but of power and of love and of a sound mind and I believe David had a sound mind he said I will go and fight this ly Spirit we need to stand up and say I will go and fight don't stay in the back of the army don't stay in the back seat don't mean anything by that get in the front David got in the front now I thing you know David didn't say come on you guys come let's get 10 of us let's go right come on give me the top 10 Generals let's go he didn't do that he didn't consider anybody else don't consider anybody this is an individual walk between you and God [Music] he said you come to me with a sword the law of the word to condemn me amen Paul said in Romans chapter 8 verse number one there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen said you come to me with a spear to kill my influence that's good but the Bible says no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise up against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn you come to me with science and reasoning and Imagination and fear but I come to you in the name of the Lord of host right the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are safe 2 Corinthians chap 10 verse number three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the Ping down of strongholds the strongholds of fears in our mind that's trying to keep us what does a stronghold do it's trying to keep you in a condition to keep you in place the devil wants you in a state of fear in a state of unknown of uncertainty of I can't move forward but you you you got to cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bring it into captivity amen every thought to The Obedience of Christ what does the spirit of fear do it opens the door wide for all sorts of imaginations you just got to cast them down you can't expect your feelings to do it it's good to put on a song it's good to put on a tape it's good to quote that it's good to get some encouragement but I'm telling you sooner or later you're going to have to take a stand yes sir in your mind you got to cast it down because he's going to come in when you're feeling down I mean if you're gonna you know try to hit somebody like I don't know Schwarzenegger you're you're not going to want himit he says come on boy not ready yet you you're going to try the old delilo wait till he's sleeping amen he's a weasel got to cast him down say get behind me Satan and having in a Readiness so there's something inside of you a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience think about job now not job so sorry Jonah to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled that's he got to a place to he put his past behind him and he move forward in obedience he says do we look on the things after the outward appearance If any man trust to himself that he is Christ let him not uh let him of himself think this again that as he is Christ even so are we Christ amen I think that's an important scripture to remember with your brothers and sisters in Christ amen David was a great man he was a great leader he was a believer in God but he was just a man with faults and failures just like you and I he took a national census to compare how great a number of people they were he failed to discipline his children children he committed adultery and then plotted in his heart to have a man murdered he was just a man but he was a man after God's Own Heart he was just a man but he was a god-called man but his heart had deceived him Jeremiah chapter 17:9 says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it amen right but how often we feel we know it tell me the times that you thought man I don't even know my own heart I'm concerned right now that's the humble way I could be wrong where would we be today if we had not been for the Lord's Mercies in our life amen the Bible says God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us God is rich in Mercy Rich Lamentations chapter 3 verse 22 I love this scripture it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed why because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness I'm thankful today for the mercies of God today that should be enough to make us want to go to church and praise him with everything that we got right there we don't need anything else we don't need to feel good we just need to recognize God's mercies in our Liv right David like you and I battled many problems in his life he had many many many many he had many many many many problems that's what I was going to say he had many problems many enemies he carried many burdens he had many shortcomings yet he repented many times he sought the Lord many times he cried many times the devil threw his past sins in his face but David made a choice to put his past in the past to remember not his former things neither consider the things of old Psalms 51: vers one have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions notice there's an S there amen Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee and only thee have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold now look at this look at this he was he just said it like he was he's not just this terrible thing that I did here or these things that uh that I did last week or last month or last year he went all the way back from when he was uh uh conceived behold I was shap in iniquity in sin my mother conceive me he could recognize that his whole life was nothing without God Psalms 25:18 look upon my Affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins now I'm just showing some scriptures here that he was turning away from the former things he didn't allow his past iniquities to hold him in a place to keep him from moving forward God had called him to be a leader we are not the tail the bride is the head amen amen the mind of Christ is in the bride Psalms 121:1 I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth so when you're thinking about your situation look where your help comes from don't keep looking down look up look up David chose to put his past in the past in order to keep moving forward he said in Psalms 57:7 my heart is fixed now when your car is broke you can't move but when you fix it you can move forward David said my heart is fixed I'm moving forward amen oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise that's what we can do when we're moving forward is praising the Lord and when they looked at the those uh the walls of Jericho and they were Mighty and they were tall and there were giants and oh my can you imagine them just standing still full of fear what are we going to do they moved forward with praise when you're feeling down praise the Lord it is your duty it is your responsibility we don't serve a God by feelings that's belittling the God who he is amen he's worthy of all praise amen David described how blessed he was in Romans chapter 4:7 records that blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin oh how beautiful how beautiful is there someone here today that would like their sins uncovered can I see your hands let me reword that is there anyone here today that would like to display on the internet your sins so we would like to keep them covered Would we not you're blessed today because the blood of Jesus Christ covers them you're in iniquities are forgiven your transgressions are blotted out we are a blessed people because of the blood of Jesus Christ because of Calvary because of what he's done for us we are a blessed people and he's worthy to be praised for what God has done for us why do we ever get to the place where we're thinking well we're good because we're not doing this or we're not doing that or we haven't done this or we haven't done that so what I never so what I never robbed a bank I sto we've all sto we've all lied we've all come short of the glory of God in many ways if we took the time to be honest with ourselves but we're blessed today one important thing we must do is learn to forget our past sins another thing we must learn to do is forget our brother's sins his trespasses and all those that have hurt us and offended us if you keep holding some trespass over your brother and sister's head you'll never be able to move forward with God when Jesus was teaching his disciples how to pray he taught them the importance of forgiving others it's very critical in your prayer that his children can't move forward in the father's Kingdom unless they forgive others Matthew chapter 6 verse 12 I want to just read that I want to put these these four verses 12 through 15 together as a theme to help us catch the importance of forgiveness he starts out in verse 12 he says and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors now I want you to notice I want you to think about today when you asked the Lord to forgive you of your sins today did you go back to the time that you prayed today this morning whenever it was and you asked God to forgive you of your sins did you even think about your brothers and sisters that have trespassed against you but look at the correlation here and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors in other words they come in simultaneously they come in continuity they come parallel one to another we we seek the Forgiveness of God as we must be forgiven yeah but God says look I don't want you seeking it above you being able to forgive those who trespass against you don't don't don't look at me as a one-sided God don't look at me as a a personal as a respect of persons or I I I got favorites with you and and you don't have to with [Music] others and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not to Temptation This is not different it's all continuity I'll get back to it here in a second but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever he said amen he said amen to his own word I love that for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will forgive will also forgive you you wants to make this real clear here but if you forgive not men the trespass neither will your father forgive your trespasses you see the continuity forgive us our debts as we forgive our our debtors yes lead us not into temptation the devil wants to leave you into an evil Temptation that you don't have to forgive somebody as if you've got power to judge them but Jesus said for thine is the power the Kingdom and The Glory the power is God to forgive to judge he is the judge it is our only responsibility to forgive I know it's a hard pill to swallow but you got to learn to forget what people do to you now I just I'm just going to say this we I've heard this a number of times times brother John I will forgive but I won't never forget and we as humans it it it it is we don't have the ability the god-given ability to put it in the sea of forgetfulness and I'll take I'll give it to you that far but the the attitude that you have that I will not ever forget you are opening the door to the devil who won't really let you forgive he don't want you to forgive you need to learn how to forget in other words when the Devil comes to your mind you remember what he did to you back 15 years ago that's really good remember what he what what she did to you last week remember what they said it's at that point you need to resist those thoughts because if not you're going to be battling some sort of tension inside of you when you forgive somebody I'm going to be honest with you when you forgive somebody the way that Jesus forgives you he does not want to remember it it's not in him to be strategically smart and to remember and to watch out for the future and make sure this that's like a worldly wisdom good think about it you could be a person with only one million 800,000 sins that you committed in your life and miss it because you would not forgive somebody who had 10 million 500,000 sins in their life and if that person forgave everybody that sinned against him he could make it so it's not about what we think is worth or not worth it's learning how to forgive and forget you know the thing is think about this every time you think about what somebody's done to you the things they said the things they they cut behind your back and trying to hurt you in so many ways if you think every time you have those thoughts doesn't it make you feel hurt doesn't it make you feel like oh I just want to I wish it gets to the point where you like to just take care of it your way you understand what I'm saying but here's the blessing that you get if you learn to forget it's not in your mind you don't have to battle that anymore it's still happen yes and it may happen again but God don't want you walking in a state of of torment and in a state of uh viciousness and revenge and and hurt so just don't worry about whether you think it's right to forget or not forget you just you just need to learn to forget it practice it practice it don't only just want to forget about your sins forget about your brother's sins that's what Jesus is teaching us here well brother John you seem to be the expert here tell me how long do I have to do this for I'm so glad you asked that question turn with me if you would to Matthew 18 verse 21 how many times you know it wouldn't be strange for you to ask that question because Peter asked that question then came Peter to him and said Lord how often shall my brother sin against me not against you but against me as a person and I forgive him come on most people can't even do it once but you know you're you're Jesus and you're teaching us and the beatitude and you You' shown us the way is it seven times to make it complete it's human nature to put a limit on forgiving others but it's a God's nature to not to Bear all things to endure all things and I'll say it like this to forgive all things he stood on the cross and he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what do you mean they don't know what they're doing they're just saying these things they're they're they were deceived they were absolutely 100% deceived the the the I'm the he the there was two thiefs on the cross next to him one was not deceived and one was deceived now every Jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing but they didn't say Lord father I'm sorry for doing this they kept doing it right so it's not the action it's how you react to what they're doing to you there there's a God reaction and then there's an ungod [Music] reaction Jesus said in verse 22 I say not unto thee until seven times but if you must know if you for your comprehension to see the end of forgiveness I say until 70 times seven you know what humanly I can't do that and I know when I'm bad on that I'm In the Flesh yes I know no matter what I'm thinking here it ain't right because the nature of God is seven * 70 now that's a lot of times to forgive somebody you might as well forget counting forget keeping tabs and you might as well just get the spirit of forgiveness on get the nature of forgiveness say God fill me with the same holy spirit that said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing because they keep doing it we must learn to forget our past sins and we must learn to forget our brother's past sins and we must learn to forget our works and our achievements Paul was another man that was guilty of murder and many other sins by the way he was a man full of Pride he was taught by the best he had many accomplishments before he came to Christ and also after he came to Christ yet he learned to forget about his works and his achievements Philippians chapter 3:12 a very familiar scripture he says not as though I've already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have gotten somewhere but this one thing I do I'm forgetting those things which are behind they're in the past they're behind me but I'm forgetting about it not just your past sins not just those that hurt you but all your achievements all those things that that you could look back and say Well they're real Milestones I'm keeping them back there why so I can move forward Ward I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus now it's okay to Remember The Lion and the bear victory that you got that you slain by faith it's okay to remember that if it's going to give you faith for this hard trial that you're going to but it's never okay to look at that as some achievement that you've attained to something you've already got something under your your Bel and you don't need to press into anything harder see the difference Matthew chapter 6:3 but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth now friends this is not just ties and offerings but the new King James version says it like this but when you do a charitable deed do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing if you keep what you're doing between you and God your reward is going to be greater in heaven God doesn't even want us to remember these things that we're doing for him you know he doesn't want us to go out there and let another human know about it because usually the motive of doing that is usually a motive of recognition and anything that we do for human recognition we want others to know about something Jesus said it plainly he said they have their reward it's simple we either want humans to know about it or we want to keep it between us and God that's the beauty that's why we need to learn to forget our works and our achievements forget about just keep moving forward we don't got time to stop in the parade and get you know people clapping at us it's it's a real thing it's seen all the time just people don't recognize it it's not just offerings and ties it's anything that you're doing for for God's kingdom keep it between you and the Lord I'm telling you that's the way to go think about this brother brand at the end of his serving the lord he said if I'm gonna do anything I better do it now you talk about God hid in humility here was a man that didn't feel like he did anything or did enough the way he said it if I'm going to do anything it's like what do you mean you're GNA do anything you've done all this he didn't say well if I if I need to do some if I'm going to do some more I better do now he didn't say it like that Paul said that many ministers I could just say it like this he said ministers but I say it like this many people glory after their flesh now that's what he said but when Paul spoke of his achievements he listed all the failures the punishments and sufferings that followed his ministry in other words they didn't look like achievements they they didn't look like well these are how many I baptized this is how many meetings I had this is what I did for the Lord there's nothing like that he said in 2 Corinthians chapter 11:3 if I must needs Glory I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities what does that word infirmities mean it means feebleness moral Frailty weakness here is a was another man where God was hid in humility some people take pleasure in glorying in their flesh but Paul said in 2 Corinthians chapter 12:1 he said therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities and persecutions and distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I'm strong he put his glory in the Lord he gloried in the cross of Calvary he kept his glory with Jesus Christ he tried to keep people from looking at him and what he had done another important thing that we need to learn to forget is our sufferings and how we feel and I'm going to try to make this as quick as I can Paul must have had a very short memory of suffering how many times was he stoned and he went right back whipped all the perils that he went through he just got out of his head had a short memory of the suffering that he went through and we need a short memory of suffering if we're going to move forward in Christ it's the past well I don't want to suffer anymore the that's what a Christian Life is it's a life of suffering your Victory isn't free from suffering your Victory is the joy and peace in the Holy Ghost that you have inside of you that's your Victory we don't want to live a life that's uh strenous or away from being hurt we just want the power to be to move forward when we do get hurt there's a difference turn with me if you were to ask chap 20 keeping this last one in mind as we're getting near to close starting with verse number 20 of Acts chapter 20 and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you and I just want to say this you as parents there are things that you have done wrong in your life you're not proud of you're not happy of but you certainly don't want to set your kids down and start telling them all about it but it's important that what you do tell your children is profitable for them are you catching what I'm saying Paul didn't say all the negative things that he did but he didn't keep anything profitable from the people I love that showing the balance here and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house testifying both to the Jews and also the Greeks repentance towards God in faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy spirit is is saying everywhere I go that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things moveed me he had a short memory of sufferings he wasn't moved neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I may finish my course with joy and the ministry amen we all got a Ministry sitting here today it's we need to recognize it if we don't feel it if we don't see it we need to come to grips God has given you Ministry not this church not your pastor but God has given you a Ministry amen which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify of the Gospel of the grace of God and now behold all right all right now so here it is I just want to stop there and I want to I want to go to uh Acts chapter 21 and let's just start here with verse number 11 just a few verses showing that he did he had a very short memory of sufferings because he just kept moving forward he didn't count his life so dear that he wasn't willing to suffer and he didn't let things move him he didn't let his sufferings and his persecutions and being knifed in the back and things said about him and whatever it might be it didn't keep from moving forward in the things of God and when he was come uh unto us he took Paul's girdle this Prophet now and he bound it with his own hands and feet and said thus sayith the Holy Ghost now it wasn't the prophet was saying it was God that was saying it so shall the Jews of at Jerusalem bind the man that onth this Giro and shall deliver him to the hands of the Gentiles now if God told you you're going to suffer wouldn't it give you like a holy ghost boldness well God has told every one of you they that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so go boldly and me live the life of a Christian stand up whatever he's told you to do Act Right dress right talk right live right amen it doesn't matter the persecutions that will follow you it's the Holy Ghost has told you well brother John I don't feel like God's told me well you need to come to church listening to God because I'm telling you I can't help you I'm might about to get you to feel better I might be able to help with some natural thing in your life but I'm telling you I can't do what God could do for you that's let God speak to you today verse 12 and when he had heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go to a place that you're going to get persecuted and Paul answered what meth ye to cry and to actually break my heart my heart you're telling me not to do what I want to do for Jesus says for I am ready not to be bound only but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus what in honor to stand in the face of adversity and say I'm a Christian I love Jesus Christ I it may hurt you may offend you it may make you want to disown me but I love Jesus and I want you to love Jesus he never went out there with a sword and said come on he was pleading that they would love the Lord that they would give their heart to Christ Christ was in Paul he had a short memory for sufferings Peter the first P persecution That Came Upon Peter and the apostles and they were thrown in prison for for preaching the truth the answer from Heaven came go and stand in the temple and tell them of all all the words of this life the only way to be a true witness for Jesus is get serious about getting the Holy Ghost if you're you're going to try to make it without seeking the Holy Ghost you're not going to make it you've got to seek the Holy Ghost because it's that Holy Ghost that causes you to go right back love forgive be the example of a Christian before others no matter what persecution comes God has called us to be in His image not what we image we want to be in in His image Romans chapter 8 ver1 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us the first step to move forward in your life is to forgive your past your sins your brother's sins your great victories and whatever sufferings you have to go through just put it behind you remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old let not only 2020 be done but take this message for your life and let your past be the past no matter what's happened about matter what anybody's done I don't care what you've done I don't care what you haven't done put it behind you and move forward move forward we've got to put our past behind us it's G to just get in the way of the Rapture I'll tell you in Rapture morning is anything going to matter what anybody said about you but the spirit of Christ inside you doesn't want does not want you to see them miss it so this is the hour to forgive this is the hour to move forward this is the hour to let the past be the past in every situation of your life one scripture we can stand together Revelations chapter 21 verse number four and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away we might also start learning today how to put the former things behind us just develop that ability just to quickly forgive and move forward amen let's Stand Together We There is a a part of us that would like America to move forward the cony and things to be more hopeful and better we all want that but we're not resting in our Christianity for that in fact um the more that we recognize things going down the tubes the more serious we're becoming with our walk with the Lord I believe that's a true true statement and though the the world is is honestly it's like going over Niger Falls and it's heading into tribulation it's falling into tribulation but it doesn't affect the bride it's affecting lukewarm church members make Believers halfway it's affecting but the bride she gets her instructions from from God and I believe that the Lord has has instructed us today with a word of encouragement to put the past behind you he knows that you're going to make a mistake tomorrow he knows you're going to get upset he knows you're going to blunder and at that moment he's going to want you to put the past behind you not hold it over your head he wants us to forget the former things and move forward we have something better than a great nation we're A peculiar people uh we're from a different Nation we're a different nation and it's it's up to us to to take what God has given us and move forward amen let's if we could just bow our heads a moment and we're going to pray before we sing a couple songs maybe there would be someone here today I'm sure we all want to move forward I'm sure of that praise the Lord but maybe there's someone here today that's is struggling and they they're just requesting prayer that God would shine a a little more grace into their heart that they could put the past in the past to move forward God sees your hands God sees God sees Humanity standing here looking and pointing up to deity amen it's beautiful God is touched by the feelings of our infirmities I believe that God's grace is sufficient today that's all we need and let's believe that wonderful course that brother Ron sung at the beginning of the ministry of this word the very message that came from an angel show that said that I like that song that's the song that I like Let It Be the theme behind our prayer as we go to him and let's just unite I don't want us all to pray together for this grace to come Heavenly Father we just unite in prayer at this time lord for one another Lord that thy Grace would come into our lives in such a supernatural way Lord that we would have the victory that we're longing for to be able to put those things that have haunted us that have bothered us that have have kept a bondage in our lives to keep us from moving forward Lord we believe this message didn't come Lord from Brother John but we believe that it came directly from Heaven Lord that you want us to move forward oh God thy grace is sufficient Lord you said you giveth more grace to the humble we have humbled ourselves we've bowed our head we've lifted up our hands to ask you for your Amazing Grace Lord today I pray that you would give Victory Lord to every heart father that Lord uh that wouldn't be uh uh that you would just supernaturally at this very moment Lord that you take away anything that's that's uh put a bondage and put chains upon the minds of thy children today Lord that they could be set free from anything that would be holding them back from moving forward Lord for Lord we are a people that Lord You' have called to to forget the former things to forget the things of of the past and not to remember them anymore and may From This Moment forward Lord may they be forgotten Lord and when Satan would try to bring bring them up in our mind may we quickly resist it and put a song of Praise in our heart a song of Thanksgiving Lord to re to remind that we are forgetting those things we're putting them behind us and we're moving forward oh Grant this Supernatural experience
