[4:34] and then we pray amen
[4:37] if we can just open our Bibles to John
[4:40] chapter 15 and read verses 15-21.
[4:45] John chapter 15. verses 15 through 21
[4:49] and then we'll have you seated after
[4:50] that
[4:53] [Music]
[4:55] say Amen when you get there please
[4:59] I'll hear one
[5:02] I hear too
[5:04] three
[5:07] so we'll start with verse 15.
[5:10] henceforth I call you not servants for
[5:13] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[5:15] doeth but have called you friends I love
[5:19] that
[5:21] for all things that I have heard of my
[5:23] father I have made known unto you
[5:26] ye have not chosen me but I have chosen
[5:29] you so the title of this little service
[5:31] sermon is God chose you
[5:34] so you have not chosen me but I have
[5:37] chosen you so you didn't choose God but
[5:40] God has chosen you notice that then from
[5:44] him choosing you then you can choose to
[5:46] serve him
[5:48] and ordained you that you should go and
[5:51] bring forth fruit so notice why he chose
[5:53] you to bring forth fruit
[5:57] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[5:59] that your fruit should remain amen that
[6:03] who whatsoever he shall ask of the
[6:05] father in my name he may give it to you
[6:08] these things I command you that you love
[6:12] one another notice that's a commandment
[6:14] if the world hate you you know that it
[6:17] hated me before it hated you
[6:19] if you were of the world the world would
[6:22] love his own but because you are not of
[6:24] the world but I have chosen you out of
[6:29] the world
[6:30] therefore the world hateth you
[6:32] remember the word that I've said unto
[6:35] you the servant is not greater than his
[6:38] Lord
[6:39] if you have they have persecuted me they
[6:41] will also persecute you if you have kept
[6:44] my sayings they will keep yours also but
[6:48] all these things will they do unto you
[6:50] for my name's sake
[6:52] because they have not known him that
[6:54] sent me he may be seated so we notice
[6:57] that God has chosen us
[7:00] to live in this world of sin
[7:03] he's chosen you not just to say you
[7:06] believe in him but to Bear fruits in
[7:09] your life
[7:10] and we'll read a quote before so in uh
[7:14] Christ The Mystery of God revealed a
[7:17] brother Branham says these three things
[7:18] why
[7:20] Jesus was revealed and we'll get into
[7:22] these things right now the first thing
[7:24] was that God wanted to reveal himself to
[7:27] the people so God had a longing to be
[7:30] revealed to his people
[7:32] and he couldn't do that as a great
[7:34] Jehovah God who covered all space-time
[7:37] and Eternity he could not he's too great
[7:40] to ever be revealed to the people
[7:41] because it would be too mysterious
[7:45] how could that great being that never
[7:47] did begin then after you went beyond the
[7:50] circle of hundreds of billions and
[7:52] trillions of years of light space and on
[7:55] out into the infinite into the eternity
[7:57] and a great creature that was all that
[8:00] and still is but what he wanted to do he
[8:03] loved fatherhood think about that for he
[8:05] was a father and the only way that he
[8:07] could express it was to become a son of
[8:10] man
[8:11] that's the reason Jesus kept saying the
[8:14] son of man see they didn't know what he
[8:17] was talking about many of them but now
[8:19] you get it congregation says amen
[8:21] see he wanted to express himself think
[8:24] about that that was his one of his great
[8:27] threefold purposes was to express
[8:29] himself identify himself with the human
[8:32] beings to reveal himself in Christ so he
[8:36] wanted to reveal himself to you guys
[8:39] that's why he chose you to reveal
[8:41] himself to you
[8:43] he knew that there was something inside
[8:45] of you that no one else could see but
[8:48] himself and that's why he chose you to
[8:51] to to redeem you
[8:54] and when he chose you he had expect and
[8:57] expected sorry expectation out of you
[8:59] and we're to be word bearers if God is
[9:03] living inside you we're to the bear that
[9:05] word we're to prophesy that word if we
[9:08] could say it that way
[9:09] so secondly so the first is preeminence
[9:12] was to express himself to identify
[9:15] himself to us so secondly to have
[9:18] preeminence in his bodies of Believers
[9:20] his bride that he might live in the
[9:23] people so a second purpose was to have
[9:25] preeminence in his sons and daughters
[9:29] and now he could he could do that in
[9:31] Adam and Eve but sin separated them
[9:34] so now there had to be some way to get
[9:37] it back so that's why he chose Jesus
[9:39] Christ because that was the only perfect
[9:40] way that he could get us redeemed that
[9:44] he could show us the right way was
[9:45] through Jesus Christ
[9:48] oh my oh we're not this Rich to me even
[9:51] to think of it see think God created
[9:53] this whole plan just for you and I think
[9:56] about that that's how much he loved you
[9:57] he was willing to sacrifice humiliation
[10:01] pain torture he was willing to live as a
[10:04] man for 33 and a half years just because
[10:07] he loved you that much and he knew that
[10:09] was the only way that we could be here
[10:11] right now and be in Heavenly places with
[10:13] him so think about that that's what love
[10:15] is when I think of love that's the
[10:18] definition of love right there love that
[10:20] Drew salvation's plan
[10:22] see what God's purpose was now why
[10:25] didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like
[10:26] that then he would never be able to
[10:28] express his fullness see God had these
[10:31] attributes that he wanted to express to
[10:34] mankind but if mankind never fell he
[10:37] could never express being a savior he
[10:39] can never express being a deliverer he
[10:42] can only stay in that fatherhood because
[10:45] if Adam and Eve never fell then he could
[10:48] never express all the attributes that
[10:50] were inside of him
[10:52] he would never be able to express his
[10:54] fullness his full attributes because he
[10:56] would have been a father there that's
[10:57] true but also he's a savior
[11:00] you say how do you know he's a saver
[11:03] he is because I've had that experience
[11:05] yes and we all have to experience Jesus
[11:09] as a savior you got to experience him as
[11:11] your Lord you got to experience him as
[11:13] your healer as your deliverer I love how
[11:16] uh David in the Book of Psalms said my
[11:19] deliverer my Fortress my strong tower he
[11:23] said he's my rock but we can't ride off
[11:26] the coattails of David you have to
[11:28] experience Jesus Christ in the same way
[11:31] as all those attributes as well because
[11:33] he still is all those attributes to all
[11:36] of us
[11:39] amen and how could he do it only through
[11:42] Jesus Christ how could he be a son only
[11:45] through Jesus Christ how can he be a
[11:48] Healer only through Jesus Christ see all
[11:52] things are wound up in that one person
[11:54] Jesus Christ oh my when I
[11:57] and so just to go back to that in John
[12:00] notice why he chose you and ordained you
[12:02] that you should bring forth fruit and
[12:05] that your fruit should remain and if you
[12:07] notice a tree when a tree is grown and
[12:10] produces fruit the fruit is for others
[12:13] so as we mature as Believers we we begin
[12:16] to produce fruit and that fruit is for
[12:18] others long suffering
[12:20] is for others because I you have to be
[12:23] long suffering yourself but when others
[12:25] come against you you get to be long
[12:26] suffering you have to be patient all
[12:28] these things are fruits that people need
[12:30] to see in our lives and it's okay if we
[12:33] don't have it this very moment but as we
[12:35] mature God expects to see those things
[12:37] in our life
[12:39] and that's why God has chosen Us in this
[12:41] day and age think about all the people
[12:43] in the world who don't know about the
[12:45] message of the hour or don't even care
[12:48] about the message of the hour who've
[12:49] heard it but God knew that at a certain
[12:51] point in your life you would come to
[12:53] receive this message of the hour and the
[12:55] message of the hour what the message
[12:56] hour is is the revealed word the four
[12:59] reveal word revealed to you yes it's not
[13:02] some some cult it's not something this
[13:04] but it's the revealed word God chose a
[13:07] prophet for a reason to reveal this word
[13:10] that's God's order God has an order how
[13:13] he does things and it's for a reason
[13:15] amen
[13:18] and uh number three and thirdly to
[13:20] restore the kingdom to his rightly
[13:23] position that fell by sin the first Adam
[13:25] knows the kingdom of God's inside of you
[13:27] notice that
[13:29] he walked in the cool of the evening so
[13:31] Adam and Eve
[13:33] before the fall they used to what they
[13:35] could walk with God in the cool of the
[13:37] evening they had Fellowship
[13:39] and when when Jesus Christ died on that
[13:41] cross He restored the fellowship that
[13:44] they once had now we have it back so now
[13:47] when we go into prayer you can have
[13:49] precious communion and fellowship with
[13:51] God you don't have to wait till
[13:53] communion service to do that but every
[13:54] day can be communion with God in your
[13:57] homes in your cars whatever you're at so
[14:00] so God loved us so much she wanted to
[14:02] restore back that communication line
[14:04] that was tainted by sin and when Christ
[14:08] died upon that tree every sin that you
[14:11] would commit that you had committed he
[14:14] he felt that and he bore it so we could
[14:16] be clean and so when God sees us he
[14:18] doesn't see sin but he sees Jesus Christ
[14:22] as
[14:23] amen he walked in the cool of the
[14:25] evening with his people talked with them
[14:27] fellowship with them and now sin and
[14:29] death had separate them from his
[14:31] presence and his entire expression did
[14:33] you read that before the foundation of
[14:35] the world to express all of his
[14:37] attributes that what he was let's go to
[14:41] Colossians 2 9 I'm sorry sister Amanda I
[14:43] didn't put that on there
[14:49] so we see God chose us for a specific
[14:51] purpose
[14:53] he just didn't give us he does this
[14:55] doesn't give the Holy Ghost just to give
[14:57] it but he gives a specific purpose so
[15:00] you can continue the works that he could
[15:02] not do at that time because you and I
[15:04] weren't born yet there are certain
[15:06] people that you can reach that I can't
[15:08] and God chose you to bear that word in
[15:12] your community your work Community your
[15:14] home community and that's why he chose
[15:17] us for that purpose he revealed himself
[15:19] to you so you can so he can reveal
[15:21] himself to others through you that's
[15:24] right amen to go to Colossians chapter 2
[15:32] for in him dwelth all the fullness of
[15:34] the godhead bodily and ye are complete
[15:37] in him amen which is the head of all
[15:40] principality and Power
[15:42] in whom also you are circumcised with
[15:44] the circumcision made without hands
[15:48] so we notice that circumcision in the
[15:50] Old Testament was a type of the Holy
[15:52] Ghost
[15:53] that circumcision now the circumcision
[15:55] of the heart
[15:56] in whom also you're circumcised with the
[15:59] circumcision made without hands in
[16:00] putting off the body of the sins of the
[16:03] flesh by the circumcision of Christ
[16:06] buried with him in baptism notice that
[16:11] when also your Arisen with him through
[16:14] the faith of the operation of God who
[16:16] hath raised him up from the dead and you
[16:19] being dead in your sins
[16:21] in the uncircumcision of your flesh he
[16:25] hath quickened together with him
[16:27] having forgiven you all trespasses so so
[16:30] that that's why he did that for so he
[16:33] could use us in a special way that he
[16:35] that only the only way he can use us
[16:38] so go to John 15 and we'll read verses 1
[16:40] through 14.
[16:46] so is Christ in you
[16:48] the hope of glory think about that
[16:57] so reverse one in John 15.
[17:00] I am the True Vine and my father is the
[17:02] husbandman
[17:03] every branch in me that beareth not
[17:06] fruit he taketh away
[17:08] and every branch that bearth fruit he
[17:10] perseth it so notice why he does that
[17:12] purging so more fruit can be brought
[17:15] forth in your life
[17:17] so trials and tribulations they either
[17:20] can uh can stop the fruit from growing
[17:23] if you let it or it's an opportunity for
[17:25] more fruits are growing your life
[17:27] because those trials and tribulations
[17:28] come so more growth can be in your life
[17:31] so more of Christ can be preeminent in
[17:34] your life
[17:35] now it says that it may bring forth more
[17:39] fruit now you are clean through the word
[17:42] which I have spoken on to you so when
[17:44] the words being preached it's a it
[17:46] should cleanse us yes if we have the
[17:49] right attitude if our heart is right
[17:51] that word is going to cleanse you see
[17:54] the flesh is going to hate it but the
[17:57] soul the spirit man is going to love it
[17:59] because it's transforming him is
[18:01] transforming his nature into more of a
[18:03] christ-like nature
[18:06] and that's why Christ died so he could
[18:10] be preeminent in his bride not in the
[18:13] nominal church but in his bride see he
[18:15] knows the nominal church is not going to
[18:18] receive him all the way they may take
[18:19] bits and pieces but he knows his bride
[18:22] The Chosen elect is going to receive all
[18:25] that he has for them he knows that the
[18:27] bride is going to be obedient that when
[18:30] the master says something she's going to
[18:33] follow no matter what no matter if it if
[18:36] it goes against what our plans are
[18:37] because the bride says I want what the
[18:40] Lord wants for my life I want to be on
[18:41] this Earth what you want me to be
[18:45] amen this uh verse verse 4 abide in me
[18:49] and I in you as the branch cannot bear
[18:52] fruit of itself so we can't we can
[18:54] produce
[18:56] fruits
[18:57] but the kind of fruit God wants us to
[19:00] produce we can only produce it in him
[19:02] because the tree of knowledge the good
[19:04] and evil it had fruit but it's rotten
[19:06] fruit so we got to be feeding off the
[19:09] tree of life in order to feed off the
[19:11] tree of life we have to abide in him
[19:13] that's the kind of fruit he's talking
[19:14] about he doesn't want any old kind of
[19:16] fruit because the devil has fruit that's
[19:18] rotten fruit that's what he gave to Eve
[19:20] and that's why all of mankind uh we had
[19:23] to die because of that the wrong tree
[19:25] that was partook of
[19:28] says abide in me and I in you as a
[19:31] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[19:33] except it abide in the vine no more can
[19:37] ye except ye abide in me notice that I
[19:41] am the vine ye are the branches he that
[19:43] abideth in me and I in him the same
[19:46] bringeth forth much fruit notice that so
[19:50] we abide in Christ we're praying daily
[19:54] we're reading the word daily listen to
[19:56] the message of the hour daily for
[19:58] constantly if our life's engulfed in
[20:00] Christ then we're going to be able we're
[20:02] going to be producing much fruit because
[20:04] he told us if we're abiding in him then
[20:07] we're going to be producing much fruit
[20:09] for without me you can do nothing
[20:12] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[20:15] forth as a branch in his withered and
[20:18] Men gather them and cast them into the
[20:20] fire and they are burned
[20:21] notice if you abide in me in my words
[20:24] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[20:27] and it shall be done unto you amen
[20:31] hearing is my father glorified that ye
[20:34] bear much fruit I believe that's a
[20:37] commandment he's commanding us that we
[20:39] should be bearing much fruit and he's
[20:41] given us the formula how to do it you
[20:45] have to abide in Christ to produce much
[20:47] fruit no matter what you're going
[20:49] through what situation hardship you have
[20:52] to abide in him because you want to
[20:55] produce fruit in the deepest and darkest
[20:57] trials because others are going to
[21:00] recognize you in the trial this this
[21:02] individual all these bad things are
[21:05] happening to him but he's still able to
[21:07] worship God he's still able to keep keep
[21:10] a smile on his face he's still able to
[21:12] conduct itself in a way that's because
[21:14] you're letting go and submitting
[21:16] yourself unto God saying Lord this trial
[21:18] I know is here for a purpose for a
[21:21] specific reason and I want to make sure
[21:23] I'm producing the right kind of fruit
[21:27] that you want me to produce in this
[21:28] trial amen because you don't want to
[21:30] produce fruit of complaining because
[21:32] it's so easy to produce that kind of
[21:34] fruit that kind of fruit only leads to
[21:36] death because the more you complain we
[21:39] see the children of Israel they complain
[21:41] complain complaining but yet God will
[21:44] still bless him he was getting them
[21:45] through things but they still found
[21:47] something to complain about
[21:49] and I believe we should always be
[21:51] thankful no matter what we're going
[21:53] through
[21:54] because we're going to be a lot worse
[21:55] situation than what we think
[21:58] amen I forgot where we're at uh let's go
[22:01] to verse eight hearing is my father
[22:02] glorified that ye bear much fruit he's
[22:05] speaking to us personally
[22:07] so shall you be my disciples and the
[22:10] father have loved me so I have loved you
[22:13] he's given us uh kind of like a a hand
[22:17] he says continue ye in my love and look
[22:20] at verse 10 brother Jonathan says if you
[22:21] keep my Commandments ye shall abide in
[22:24] my love notice that so we have to be
[22:27] obedient see like brother Jonathan said
[22:30] it's not just the Ten Commandments that
[22:31] we keep but Christ when he's speaking to
[22:34] us those are Commandments you can't just
[22:36] take or leave those things he said if
[22:38] you keep my Commandments you shall abide
[22:40] in my love we want that that christ-like
[22:43] love we have to keep his Commandments
[22:46] even as I've kept my father's
[22:48] Commandments and abide in his love see
[22:50] God has given us a formula
[22:53] to live a life above sin but if you're
[22:56] not obedient to God then you can't live
[22:58] a life above sin it's impossible
[23:01] go to verse 11. these things have I
[23:04] spoken unto you that my joy might remain
[23:07] in you see we're looking for joy in all
[23:09] the wrong places he told us how to have
[23:12] joy you got to keep his Commandments
[23:15] that you can abide in his love and that
[23:17] Joy will remain that Joy will remain
[23:19] when your family turns your back against
[23:22] you when you lose your job
[23:25] when
[23:26] you filling the blank whatever it is
[23:28] that Joy will remain because you're
[23:30] because happiness is based upon
[23:32] circumstances in your life but joy
[23:35] doesn't look at circumstances Joy looks
[23:37] in God's word Joy looks to Jesus Christ
[23:39] because Jesus Christ in order one so Joy
[23:42] looks to the word and says
[23:44] my God's going to provide all my needs
[23:46] it's going to say but seek ye first the
[23:48] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[23:50] all these things shall be added unto you
[23:52] amen these things have I spoken unto you
[23:56] that my joy might remain in you and that
[23:59] your joy might be full
[24:02] look at verse 13 says Greater Love verse
[24:06] 12. this is my commandment he's speaking
[24:08] to us again that you love one another as
[24:11] I have loved you he doesn't say uh take
[24:14] up this person uh deserves a I don't
[24:17] have to love this person he's done so
[24:18] many so many rotten things to me I I
[24:21] don't have to be nice to this person I
[24:23] have to love this person no he says this
[24:25] is my commandment that you love one
[24:26] another as I have loved you so you've
[24:29] given us commitment to love it says 13
[24:32] greater love hath no man than this that
[24:35] a man laid down his life for his friends
[24:38] and Jesus showed us what love is Father
[24:41] forgive them they know not what they do
[24:45] verse 14 Year my friend notice you are
[24:49] my friends if
[24:50] you do whatsoever I command you so if
[24:54] you want to be a friend of God you have
[24:57] to be obedient to God as we heard a
[24:59] wonderful men's meaning obedience ties
[25:01] the whole thing together because you can
[25:03] worship you can pray and all these
[25:05] things
[25:06] but if you're not be obedient to the
[25:08] voice of God all those other things
[25:10] aren't going to matter because obedience
[25:12] is better than sacrifice
[25:15] always God is looking for a Believer who
[25:18] will take him at his word
[25:21] amen
[25:22] so like we said before we cannot bring
[25:24] forth fruit unless we are abiding in
[25:27] Jesus Christ
[25:30] what is fruit
[25:31] so we are liking the trees so whatever
[25:34] whatsoever things we're feeding on is
[25:37] going to be what we're going to produce
[25:39] in our life whatever time whatever
[25:40] you're spending your free time on is
[25:43] going to be what you're going to produce
[25:44] in your life so if I'm just watching
[25:46] movies all day and all night uh soap
[25:49] operas and TV shows and reading romance
[25:51] novels that's what's going to happen I'm
[25:53] going to start producing those things
[25:55] but if I'm reading the word every day if
[25:58] I'm saying Lord reveal yourself to me
[26:00] your word I want to see you in every
[26:02] line every phrase every scripture point
[26:04] me to the scripture you want me to read
[26:05] let the word that I'm reading become
[26:08] life in me so I can live it out and not
[26:11] just know it here but live it out in my
[26:13] life
[26:14] and if I'm listening to the message of
[26:15] the hour say Lord speak to me through
[26:17] your Prophet I don't want to just hear
[26:19] something I don't want to hear but I
[26:20] want to hear something that's directly
[26:21] from you speaking to me and I want to
[26:23] live that out guess what you're going to
[26:25] start producing Jesus Christ in your
[26:27] life because because that's the formula
[26:29] literally whatever you that's a black
[26:32] dog and a white dog inside of you the
[26:34] white dog's the spirit man the black dog
[26:35] is your flesh if you're feeding the
[26:37] white dog the white dog is going to be
[26:38] the one who's going to be on top every
[26:40] time but you got to be
[26:42] feeding that white dog
[26:44] amen so wherever fruit we're bearing is
[26:47] gonna it so whatever's on the inside of
[26:49] us is what's going the fruit's gonna
[26:51] bear on the outside that's a
[26:52] manifestation of what's on the inside of
[26:54] you
[26:55] amen notice what Jesus said though he
[26:58] said much fruit not a tiny bit of fruit
[27:00] but much fruit if we're truly abiding
[27:03] him our life will produce much fruit
[27:09] amen so I looked the word what
[27:10] commandment is it's a command a mandate
[27:13] or an order or injunction given by
[27:16] Authority charge or precepts so so like
[27:19] paying your taxes that could be
[27:22] considered a commandment because if you
[27:23] don't pay your taxes eventually you're
[27:25] going to be thrown in jail and owe a lot
[27:27] of money to IRS
[27:29] or with anything uh speeding the speed
[27:32] limit says 75 and you're going 105 down
[27:35] the highway eventually you will be
[27:37] caught and thrown in jail and maybe even
[27:38] lose your license so those things are
[27:41] Commandments but we're the commands
[27:43] we're talking about is the Commandments
[27:45] of what Jesus is telling us to do what
[27:47] the word of God is telling us to do
[27:48] because look through all throughout the
[27:50] Bible God is speaking to us and those
[27:53] are Commandments
[27:55] so let's go to First John 5 2-3 first
[27:58] John 5 2-3
[28:08] like I said before God chose you think
[28:11] about that out everybody in this world
[28:13] he chose us to be here he's placed it in
[28:16] your heart to to be sitting in these
[28:18] seats to hear from him
[28:20] now the word that he speaks to us
[28:21] tonight we either choose to leave it
[28:24] here or we choose to bring it with us
[28:27] out in the mission field so wherever we
[28:28] go outside these doors I believe is
[28:30] considered the mission field we're all
[28:32] missionaries in a sense we're all word
[28:35] bearers so so that when we go back to
[28:38] our communities to our jobs we have a uh
[28:42] obligation we have a opportunity to be
[28:45] ambassadors as he's called us to be he's
[28:48] given us the ministry of reconciliation
[28:51] so if you've been reconciled go help
[28:54] reconcile somebody else I believe that's
[28:57] what the Holy Ghost was sent for it
[28:58] wasn't just sent for to supply all our
[29:01] our physical needs but the Holy Ghost
[29:04] was sent to win souls to him because we
[29:09] don't know who's bride who's not bride
[29:10] out in our communities we don't that's
[29:13] why you got to cast your bread upon the
[29:14] Water give everybody brother bran said
[29:17] this statement
[29:18] uh
[29:20] it's not I'm paraphrasing it
[29:22] if somebody started the gospel twice
[29:24] somebody should be able to hear the
[29:26] gospel at least once I'm paraphrasing
[29:28] but you know what I mean so if somebody
[29:29] hasn't heard the gospel they should at
[29:32] least have an opportunity here at one
[29:33] time that other person's heard it five
[29:34] times already because
[29:38] every person is gonna have a choice
[29:40] either they they either receive the
[29:43] Gospel or they reject it you can't get
[29:45] them by Revelation I can't give him by
[29:46] Revelation but what I can do is I can
[29:49] give my this lay my life down because
[29:53] Jesus that's how he taught us to live
[29:55] that example to lay our life down to
[29:57] edify somebody Paul said I became all
[29:59] things to all men that I might win some
[30:01] so Paul knew he wouldn't win everybody
[30:03] but he still gave his heart into trying
[30:06] to win that soul to Christ
[30:09] so I said first John 2 and verses two
[30:11] through three first time first John
[30:13] chapter 5 verses two through three
[30:18] so it says whosoever by this we know
[30:22] that we love the children of God when we
[30:24] love God and keep his Commandments
[30:26] notice that if we truly love God we're
[30:29] going to be obedient to his words
[30:33] for this is the love of God
[30:35] look at that he's giving us for this is
[30:37] the love of God that's the giving us the
[30:39] definition right here that we keep his
[30:41] Commandments notice that that's how
[30:44] important it is to God
[30:46] and his Commandments are not Grievous
[30:48] see they're Grievous if we start
[30:50] complaining why we have to do this
[30:52] but what does a lamb do a lamb submits
[30:55] it it submits itself to share so like
[30:59] that song says share all my rights away
[31:01] in this world of sin I am so needy so a
[31:04] lamb knows it has rights but it's
[31:06] willing to lay itself down to the
[31:09] Master's shears willing to let go of his
[31:11] plans and hopes and dreams and follow
[31:14] the Commandments even the Commandments
[31:15] don't agree with uh his plans he he he's
[31:19] willing to slide those planes away and
[31:22] throw him away to be obedient to Christ
[31:26] for whosoever is born of God overcometh
[31:29] the world that's why it's so important
[31:31] to receive the new birth because if we
[31:34] receive that new birth that the Sea of
[31:37] the Holy Ghost
[31:39] that's the overcoming power we need
[31:41] this is the victory that overcometh the
[31:44] world even our faith and we're gonna go
[31:48] let's go to um
[31:50] second John 1 6.
[31:59] so it says and this is love so notice
[32:02] that again this chapter is talking about
[32:04] this is love what love is it's really
[32:06] defining What Love Is
[32:09] that we walk after his Commandments this
[32:11] is the Commandment that you've heard
[32:14] from the beginning you shall walk in it
[32:17] so we're not preaching new gospel this
[32:19] gospel is Jesus Christ the same
[32:21] yesterday today and forever
[32:23] and from the beginning it started with
[32:25] obedience and at the end it's obedience
[32:27] Adam and Eve have a chance had a chance
[32:29] to be obedient and they chose not to be
[32:31] obedient so we should learn from that
[32:33] example to When God Says something just
[32:36] do it just do it because you'll save
[32:38] yourself a lot of heart heartache and
[32:40] trouble
[32:41] just doing that and we see through the
[32:43] prophet's testimony of his uh of his
[32:45] life that he he told us the ways of a
[32:48] transgressor or a heart
[32:50] so he told he said when God says
[32:52] something just do it no matter if your
[32:53] mom doesn't agree with it or your wife
[32:55] doesn't agree with it or whoever if it's
[32:57] from God it will always line up with the
[33:00] word it always dovetail
[33:01] so let's go to um
[33:05] I'm gonna read this so John 14 21 he
[33:08] that hath my Commandments in keepeth
[33:10] them he it is that loveth me so notice
[33:13] that if if we say we love God and we're
[33:16] not obedient to God then we don't really
[33:18] don't love God
[33:19] you know it's as simple as like for
[33:22] instance example if uh if somebody's
[33:24] married a man's married and he keeps
[33:26] cheating on his wife and says he loves
[33:28] them say he loves her he's a liar
[33:31] because he's not being faithful that's
[33:33] the same scenario in that you may not be
[33:35] doing that uh you know in the natural
[33:38] but not being true
[33:41] to Jesus Christ by not being obedient to
[33:44] him it's like you're cheating on him
[33:45] it really is because it's telling us
[33:48] what love is right here he that has my
[33:50] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[33:52] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[33:55] shall be loved of my father and I will
[33:58] love him and will manifest myself to him
[34:00] so the more obedient we can be to him
[34:03] the more God is going to be willing to
[34:05] just pour himself out and reveal himself
[34:07] to you
[34:12] so Jesus told us how to become friends
[34:14] with him let's go to jail I'm just going
[34:16] to read this James 2 23 if you want to
[34:18] turn there and the scripture was
[34:19] fulfilled with saith Abraham believed
[34:22] God
[34:23] and it was imputed unto him for
[34:25] righteousness and he was called the
[34:27] friend of God
[34:28] so Abraham just took God at his word
[34:31] that's why the scripture says he
[34:33] staggered not at the promise of God
[34:35] through unbelief so we he's the father
[34:37] of our faith for a reason so we're to
[34:40] follow after his footsteps to take God
[34:42] at his word and think about Abraham's
[34:44] life he never had a bible to read he
[34:48] never had brothers and sisters like we
[34:50] have but he was still willing to take
[34:52] God at his word
[34:54] and God blessed them for that and God
[34:57] will bless you if you're obedient to him
[35:00] if you're willing to follow what he's
[35:01] speaking to you brother Bram said this
[35:04] statement God is not obligated to give
[35:06] you any more light if you're not
[35:08] following the light that he's giving you
[35:10] right now
[35:11] so think about that maybe some things in
[35:13] our lives that God has told us to do but
[35:15] we kind of brushed underneath the carpet
[35:18] that's why it's so important to unturn
[35:20] every stone to make sure say Lord
[35:22] there's anything that you told me to do
[35:24] that I forgot please make it known to me
[35:26] I want to do I want to be pleasing unto
[35:28] you I want to be I want you to call me
[35:31] friend
[35:33] let's go to Matthew 7.
[35:36] foreign
[35:41] so God just didn't choose us just to sit
[35:45] and and church and just hear the word
[35:47] and not do anything with it but God
[35:48] chose us to go out and win souls to his
[35:52] kingdom God chose us to
[35:55] have our nature changed every day
[35:57] because if you want to win somebody to
[35:59] Christ Our nature is going to have to
[36:01] change because they can't see us they
[36:04] must see Jesus Christ in us that's how
[36:06] you win somebody over to Christ they got
[36:08] to see that love like brother Mike said
[36:11] organically radiating out of you see a
[36:14] sheep doesn't manufacture a wool but
[36:16] what does a sheep do it Bears wool and
[36:18] we have to bear the fruits of God so the
[36:20] tree does it Bears apples it doesn't
[36:23] have to force itself but it comes
[36:25] natural
[36:27] so go to Matthew 7 16.
[36:31] I think Matthew 7 16. or is it Matt I'm
[36:33] sorry maybe Matthew 6.
[36:37] no no I'm sorry it's Matthew 7 17.
[36:40] so it says even so every good tree
[36:44] bringeth forth good fruits but a corrupt
[36:47] tree bringeth forth evil fruits a good
[36:50] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[36:53] neither can it corrupt tree bring forth
[36:55] good fruit so a tree
[36:58] So it's talking to us so we can't be bad
[37:00] and good at the same time
[37:02] you just can't it's like you can't be
[37:05] drunk and sober at the same time either
[37:06] so if I'm if I drink alcohol even a
[37:10] little bit tiny a bit and I'm driving I
[37:12] get pulled over
[37:13] and they breathalyzed me and there's
[37:14] that in my system I'm gonna go to jail
[37:17] and have to pay ten thousand dollars
[37:18] whether I like it or not even though
[37:20] it's a little bit but the thing is
[37:22] you're still
[37:23] uh drunk is drunk
[37:26] black is black white is white simple as
[37:28] that no matter if it's a little bit of
[37:30] sin or a lot of bit of sin sin sin you
[37:32] can't say well I'm sinning a little bit
[37:33] I'm okay God doesn't see it that way
[37:36] either you're sinning or you're not
[37:37] sinning it's cut and dry either you're
[37:39] serving God or you're not serving God
[37:41] cut and dry
[37:43] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[37:45] fruit neither can a crop tree bring
[37:47] forth good fruit every tree that
[37:49] bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
[37:52] down and cast into the fire no it says
[37:55] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[37:57] them
[38:00] and then we'll hop over to James three
[38:02] eleven
[38:09] man time just flies huh
[38:15] so James 3
[38:17] and we'll start with verse 11.
[38:19] so it says
[38:24] death a fountain send forth at the same
[38:26] place Sweet Water and bitter water I
[38:29] read on the board verse 12.
[38:31] can the Fig Tree my brother and bear
[38:33] Olive berries either a Vine fig so can
[38:37] no Fountain both yield salt water and
[38:40] fresh water
[38:41] verse 13.
[38:44] who was a wise man and endued with
[38:46] knowledge among you let him shoot out of
[38:49] a good conversation his works with
[38:51] meekness and wisdom think about those
[38:53] are fruits right there let him show out
[38:55] of a good conversation his works with
[38:57] meekness of wisdom verse 14 please
[39:01] but if you have bitter and envying and
[39:03] strife in your hearts Glory not and lie
[39:06] not against the truth verse 15 please
[39:08] the wisdom that descendeth not from
[39:10] above but is Earthly
[39:13] sensual devilish verse 16. for where
[39:17] envying and strife is there is confusion
[39:19] and error evil work those are the fruits
[39:21] of the devil that's the kind of that's
[39:23] the kind of fruits that he produces the
[39:26] kind of fruits that we're produced in
[39:27] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[39:29] verse 17 please but the wisdom that is
[39:32] from above is first what
[39:34] you're here then Peaceable
[39:38] gentle and easy to be entreated look I
[39:41] love this full of mercy and look at that
[39:45] and good fruits without partiality and
[39:49] without hypocrisy so those are the kind
[39:52] of fruits that we need to producing in
[39:54] our life and if we're not producing
[39:56] right now God has given us opportunity
[39:58] to be able to produce those fruits if
[40:00] and only if we abide in him daily
[40:04] and we'll go to verse 18. notice and the
[40:07] fruits of righteousness is sown in peace
[40:11] of them that make peace so you know you
[40:16] know God has called us to be peacemakers
[40:18] right
[40:19] so think about that
[40:22] we can make peace in a situation we can
[40:25] make joy in a situation God has placed
[40:28] himself inside of us so he's given us
[40:30] the authority and power to be able to
[40:33] produce those things in a situation but
[40:36] you have to be inviting in him to use it
[40:38] properly you don't want to misuse The
[40:40] Authority that God has given you
[40:43] so for a bearing the fruit of God in our
[40:46] life we'll be laying our life down for
[40:49] others we'll be reaching out for lost
[40:51] souls
[40:52] second Corinthians 5 11 says knowing
[40:55] therefore the terror of the lord we
[40:58] persuade men
[41:00] but we are made manifest unto God and I
[41:03] trust also May manifest in your
[41:06] consciousness
[41:07] so I got this quote right here from the
[41:09] hidden Life of Christ I'm going to read
[41:11] says the world is so dead and empty to
[41:13] you anymore till you simply can't have
[41:16] any pleasure here
[41:17] nothing but just winning souls to Christ
[41:20] is all you can get pleasure out of I
[41:22] love that Lord help me to get there
[41:24] did you know the marking of the angel
[41:26] that was sent forth to seal with the
[41:28] Holy Ghost only seal those who sighed
[41:30] and cried for the Abominations done in
[41:33] the city Ezekiel 9. did you ever read it
[41:35] not those who shouted and danced those
[41:39] who sighed and cried for the
[41:41] Abominations did in the city only ones
[41:44] that were sealed
[41:46] so God has has called each one as for a
[41:49] special mission
[41:50] you can choose to accept it or not
[41:52] so then God shows you for a special
[41:54] Mission he placed you in this age
[41:57] because this is the only age he knew
[42:00] that he wanted you in think about that
[42:03] that he chose you to go out and bear his
[42:06] word he chose to use you to go win his
[42:09] soul that's how much he loved you that
[42:11] he he wanted to place you in the most
[42:12] hardest age to overcome but we can
[42:15] overcome this age through him through
[42:18] his blood as we'll read a little bit
[42:19] later
[42:20] so just to think about that that God
[42:22] chose you for this special assignment
[42:25] and we got to accept our responsibility
[42:27] because he promised to be with you and
[42:30] in you I know this was the scripture
[42:32] wasn't here but this came into my heart
[42:34] let me go to Joshua Joshua 1.
[42:38] if you put that in a boar sister Amanda
[42:40] please Joshua 1.
[42:45] and so what do you like the 47 verses
[42:47] Joshua one sorry
[42:49] so Joshua I just love Joshua chapter one
[42:52] because it's just
[42:54] it's just so beautiful I will read it
[42:56] here I just I just love it so in Joshua
[42:58] chapter one it says
[43:00] now after the death of Moses the servant
[43:03] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[43:05] Lord spake unto Joshua with the son of
[43:08] none Moses Minister saying verse two
[43:11] please
[43:12] Moses my servant is dead brother Branham
[43:15] has gone off the scene but his voice is
[43:18] still here the message that he brought
[43:20] to us Jesus Christ is still here he says
[43:23] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[43:26] thou and all this people into the land
[43:29] in which I have given to them even to
[43:30] the children of Israel verse 3 please
[43:32] every place that the soil of your foot
[43:35] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[43:38] you as I said unto Moses verse 4 please
[43:41] so we just love that from from the
[43:44] Wilderness and this Lebanon even to the
[43:46] Great River and the river Euphrates all
[43:48] the land the High Tides unto the great
[43:50] sea toward the going down of the sun
[43:51] shall be your Coast so we shouldn't let
[43:54] any Giant
[43:56] stay in our land God has given us the
[43:59] possession we got to go and possess that
[44:01] land don't let the dead Don't Let The
[44:03] Devil stay in your land we we have the
[44:06] power
[44:07] through God to like David did hit that
[44:10] giant right in the eye knocked him down
[44:12] and cut his head off don't let any devil
[44:14] let you live below the privilege God is
[44:17] calling you to verse 5 please
[44:20] so we I just there shall not be any man
[44:23] and be able to stand before thee all the
[44:25] days of thy life as I was with Moses so
[44:29] I'll be with thee amen so he's speaking
[44:31] to you too right now as I was with Moses
[44:33] Saul be with you greater is in you than
[44:36] he that is in the world he said I'll be
[44:37] with you until the end of the world
[44:39] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[44:43] God cannot fail
[44:44] that's the only thing he cannot do is
[44:46] fail he can't fail you let's go to verse
[44:48] six please
[44:51] be strong and of good courage For unto
[44:54] this people shall I divide for
[44:56] inheritance
[44:57] the land which I swear unto them by
[44:59] their fathers to give them verse 7
[45:01] please
[45:03] amen
[45:05] so it's telling us to be strong and of
[45:07] good courage I love that so no matter
[45:10] what you're going through be strong and
[45:12] of good courage because the gods you
[45:13] serve is overall
[45:15] only be thou strong and very courageous
[45:18] that thou mayest observe oh look at that
[45:21] to do according to all the law which
[45:24] Moses my servant commanded me notice
[45:27] it's talking about obedience again turn
[45:29] not from it to the right hand to the
[45:31] left that thou mayest Prosper that thou
[45:35] mayest Prosper whatsoever thou goest so
[45:39] obedience is so important is even
[45:41] talking about the Old Testament right
[45:43] now if you want to prosper be obedient
[45:46] to God
[45:47] follow his Commandments whatsoever thou
[45:50] goest let's go to verse 8.
[45:55] this book of the law shall not depart
[45:58] out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate
[46:01] therein day and night that thou mayest
[46:06] observe to do according to all that is
[46:10] written therein now you yourself cannot
[46:14] do all this law in the natural
[46:16] God has to write the laws upon your
[46:19] heart and upon your mind so it becomes
[46:21] organic and that's why it's so important
[46:25] to spend time with God because his
[46:28] Commandments are not Grievous if you're
[46:30] connected
[46:32] in him just like if I if I'm vacuuming
[46:34] and I unplug it it's not going to have
[46:36] any power source but if I'm connected to
[46:39] the power source I can vacuum all day
[46:40] and all night so if we're connected to
[46:43] the power source which is Jesus Christ
[46:44] we can live a life above sin that that's
[46:48] the ticket that's the key
[46:50] let's go to verse nine this is thou
[46:52] shall have good success verse 9 and
[46:53] we'll think we'll stop after verse 9.
[46:55] heaven and I commanded thee be strong
[46:58] and of good courage Be not Afraid
[47:01] neither be thou dismayed don't don't be
[47:04] afraid if you can't pay the bill this
[47:06] month don't be afraid if everything uh
[47:09] is going wrong
[47:11] it says of good courage Be not Afraid
[47:13] neither be thou dismayed let God be God
[47:17] in your life stop trying to be God let
[47:20] God be God in your life submit to him
[47:23] draw an eye to God and he'll draw an eye
[47:25] to you
[47:26] see neither be thou dismayed for the
[47:28] Lord thy God look at that is with thee
[47:32] with you brother Bruce with you sister
[47:34] Gabriel with you brother Roger he's with
[47:37] thee whatsoever thou goest
[47:41] amen
[47:43] amen so why did God choose us I'm gonna
[47:47] read verse John 16 33 again these things
[47:49] have outspoken unto you that in me you
[47:51] might have peace
[47:53] notice that in the world you should have
[47:55] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[47:59] overcome the world so God chose us to be
[48:02] Overcomers in this dark sinful world
[48:06] we can be Overcomers I don't care how
[48:09] dark the government's getting I don't
[48:10] care X Y and Z is if God is for us who
[48:14] can be against us
[48:19] Revelations 3 to him that overcometh
[48:23] well I grant to sit with me in my throne
[48:26] even as I also overcame
[48:31] so if Jesus said this statement I
[48:33] believe in I forgot where he said I
[48:34] think in Matthew
[48:35] all power is given to me in heaven and
[48:39] in Earth so there is no devil that can
[48:42] stop you as long as you're
[48:45] in the Christ in the Fortress because
[48:48] he's your Fortress but if you go outside
[48:50] the Fortress you have no more protection
[48:53] but if I stay inside the Fortress no
[48:55] matter what Dark Storm what Devil comes
[48:57] before me I know I can March through him
[48:59] I could go right through it because God
[49:01] is with me
[49:06] amen first John 5 4 for whatsoever for
[49:09] whatsoever is born of God
[49:11] overcometh the world
[49:14] and this is the victory that overcometh
[49:17] the world even our faith you overcome by
[49:21] the blood of the lamb and your testimony
[49:24] that's how you overcome that's from the
[49:26] resurrection of last let's go to
[49:27] Revelations chapter 12 verse 11.
[49:30] so we're going to find out how we
[49:32] overcome this evil sinful age
[49:36] brother Brahm says the hardest age to
[49:39] live in but it's not impossible to live
[49:42] in I'll tell you that because With God
[49:44] all things are possible
[49:47] so Revelations 12 11 and we'll read that
[49:49] let me get there to myself
[49:52] so it says and they overcame him by what
[49:55] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[50:00] of their testimony so for meeting with
[50:03] Jesus we should have a testimony God
[50:06] should be moving in our life every day
[50:08] we should have a testimony we should be
[50:09] able to testify if we're truly a body in
[50:12] Christ then we should have a testimony
[50:14] of our nature being changed a little bit
[50:16] each and every day
[50:17] because that's what happens fruit begins
[50:19] to Bear more and more and more as a tree
[50:21] matures fruit begins to be more
[50:24] prevalent
[50:25] and somebody begins they could take that
[50:27] tree take a bite of it and say um this
[50:29] is good where are you getting this fruit
[50:31] from anybody would Point them right to
[50:32] Jesus Christ right there and right there
[50:36] so it says and they overcame him by the
[50:38] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[50:41] their testimony look at right here this
[50:43] is the key and they love not their lives
[50:45] unto death see it's okay to have nice
[50:48] things in life it's okay to have a nice
[50:51] car a nice house but don't let those
[50:53] things take the place of Jesus Christ
[50:56] because anything you put before God is
[50:59] an idol I don't care what it is if it's
[51:01] your kids your spouse it's an idol
[51:03] so we got to make sure that we're
[51:05] putting things in the right priority
[51:07] Christ needs to be the number one
[51:09] priority every single day and if he's
[51:13] the number one priority all things will
[51:15] begin to fall in place those bills that
[51:17] need to be played are going to fall into
[51:18] place the health you need is going to
[51:19] fall into place the house you need the
[51:22] car you need is going to fall into the
[51:23] place but God has to be first say God I
[51:26] need more of your Holy Ghost than me I I
[51:28] can't be the person you want me to be
[51:30] unless more of you is living inside of
[51:32] me and I'm willing to do whatever it
[51:34] takes I'm willing to give up whatever I
[51:36] have to give up I'm desperate to have
[51:38] you in the center of my life at all
[51:39] times
[51:41] Jesus gave us the example how to do it
[51:43] now we want to know how to overcome
[51:46] Jesus told us how to do it see humility
[51:49] that's the key he gird himself he took a
[51:53] towel and washed the disciples feet and
[51:55] wiped him I think we're afraid to get
[51:57] dirty and watch somebody's feet
[51:59] spiritually if you want to overcome if
[52:01] you want to help somebody you got to be
[52:03] willing to wash somebody's feet and be
[52:05] willing to help somebody
[52:07] well no matter what it takes and Jesus
[52:09] was willing to help no matter what it
[52:11] took he was willing to be a to humiliate
[52:14] himself he didn't care what he had he's
[52:16] a blood Brown said a foot wash uh flunky
[52:20] as they would say he girded himself took
[52:23] a towel and watched his disciples feet
[52:25] the very God Of Heaven humiliated
[52:28] himself think about that we don't want
[52:30] to be humiliated that's the reason women
[52:32] don't want their hair to go out that's
[52:33] the reason they don't want to dress like
[52:34] ladies should dress like men don't want
[52:37] to see it's the same thing they don't
[52:39] get humiliated but Jesus constantly
[52:41] looked who he was greatness I'm gonna
[52:45] say something greatness humiliates
[52:47] itself great humbles itself greatness
[52:52] that's why John the Baptist could say I
[52:54] must decrease so Christ can increase the
[52:57] more we can humble ourselves the more
[52:59] Christ can be exalted in each one of our
[53:01] personal lives and that's why he chose
[53:04] us so he can be exalted in our life so
[53:06] he can be manifested in our life that's
[53:09] the that's what fruit is
[53:12] now back there before the foundation of
[53:14] the world check this out God chose you
[53:17] in Christ Jesus to appear holy at the
[53:21] end time I don't care
[53:23] if all that we got women have dressing
[53:26] men half naked I don't care but he chose
[53:29] you in Christ to appear holy at the end
[53:31] time not disadressing but inwardly
[53:34] because if inwardly it works going on
[53:36] then you're going to address right
[53:37] you're gonna talk right You're Gonna Act
[53:39] Right but it's so important to focus on
[53:42] the inside the soul
[53:44] because anybody can can throw a skirt on
[53:46] and say they're Christian but you want
[53:48] to see the life behind the skirt you
[53:50] want to see that light that's inside
[53:51] that the the person who's wearing a suit
[53:54] and tie you want to see behind what's in
[53:57] there that's the fruit that's so
[53:58] important I'm read that again now back
[54:00] before the foundation of the world God
[54:02] chose you
[54:03] in Christ to appear holy at the end time
[54:07] all the way from the foundation of the
[54:09] world do you see it
[54:11] God chose you to live a life above sin
[54:13] to live an overcoming life every day
[54:16] don't let the devil beat you down for
[54:19] what you did in the past or what you
[54:21] didn't do you got to look forward
[54:24] press towards the mark don't look at all
[54:27] those things that you didn't do or or I
[54:29] was a bad man that's not you anymore God
[54:32] is calling you to a nature change God is
[54:35] calling you to win souls God is calling
[54:38] you
[54:39] to be like him he became you that you
[54:42] could become like we could become him
[54:44] that's why he did that for
[54:47] second Corinthians chapter six
[55:06] we then as workers together with him
[55:10] beseech you also that you receive not
[55:13] the grace of God in vain
[55:17] verse 2 for he saith I have heard thee
[55:20] in a Time accepted and in the day of
[55:22] salvation I have secured thee behold now
[55:25] is the accepted time behold now is the
[55:29] day of salvation
[55:33] verse 3 giving no offense in anything
[55:36] that the ministry be not blamed so when
[55:40] we go outside we're representing Christ
[55:42] don't bring a bad reproach to it
[55:46] so it's so important the way we live our
[55:49] life if we go fly off the handle
[55:52] somebody's gonna see that yes we can
[55:55] apologize for it but if we were aware of
[55:59] the situation at the time we wouldn't
[56:00] have flew off the handle and I'm guilty
[56:02] of it too put myself right in the
[56:04] chopping block
[56:05] says but all things are proving
[56:07] ourselves as the Ministers of God in
[56:10] much patience as fruits afflictions in
[56:15] Necessities in distresses in Stripes
[56:20] notice all these things are sufferings
[56:23] and you can't you can't Reign unless you
[56:25] suffer so if you want more to Christ you
[56:28] have to suffer to get it and when I say
[56:30] that suffering is your flesh your flesh
[56:32] is going to be one that's suffering
[56:34] so in stripes imprisonments and tumults
[56:37] and labors in watchings and fastings
[56:40] fasting I believe is very important uh
[56:43] because you're crucifying your flesh
[56:45] fasting and praying is a very good calm
[56:47] I'm not saying that fast seven days a
[56:49] week but even even one day a week I
[56:51] believe would do some some mighty good
[56:54] because fasting is is such an important
[56:57] you just you know brother Ferguson did a
[56:59] study on fasting and I believe something
[57:01] like a sister Beckman said we should be
[57:02] doing this is something that really gets
[57:04] you closer helps you get closer to God
[57:07] so let's keep going verse verse uh six
[57:11] by pureness by knowledge by
[57:15] long-suffering by kindness by the Holy
[57:18] Ghost by unfeigned Love by the word of
[57:21] Truth by the power of God by the armor
[57:23] of righteousness on the right hand and
[57:25] on the left
[57:26] by Honor and dishonor by evil report in
[57:29] goodport as deceivers and yet true as
[57:32] unknown and yet well known as dying and
[57:34] behold we live as chasten and not killed
[57:37] as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as
[57:41] poor yet making many Rich notice that
[57:45] as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as
[57:49] poor yet making many Rich so you have
[57:53] you have a you have a rich you have
[57:55] something rich inside of you which is
[57:57] Jesus Christ and we gotta be given that
[57:59] to people
[58:00] that that's the you can give somebody a
[58:02] million dollars but that will do them no
[58:03] good that's the greatest riches you can
[58:06] ever have is Jesus Christ as having
[58:08] nothing yet we have all things because
[58:10] we have Jesus Christ inside of us amen
[58:12] we may not have as much money as we want
[58:14] in a bank account we may not have have
[58:16] much young age as we want or or less
[58:19] aching and pains but what you have is
[58:21] greater than all that because he didn't
[58:23] come to redeem these bodies he came to
[58:25] redeem what's inside of here and we got
[58:27] to reach somebody
[58:29] what's inside of here don't look at the
[58:31] outward appearance of somebody but the
[58:33] inward appearance is so much more
[58:34] important because that's what God he
[58:36] came to redeem and brother Braham said
[58:38] this statement one soul is worth more
[58:40] than ten thousand World think about that
[58:42] you were worth more than ten thousand
[58:44] worlds to God
[58:46] think about that
[58:48] as uh as many things have nothing yet
[58:51] possessing all things
[58:54] amen
[58:56] now I want you to notice
[58:59] this is the beginning of Christianity of
[59:01] the church and I want you to notice this
[59:03] is from Israel in the church the first
[59:05] one I want you to notice it wasn't
[59:06] because Abraham was a good man he didn't
[59:09] choose you because you were good and all
[59:12] these things
[59:13] because God elected and chose Abraham it
[59:16] wasn't Abraham's choosing God it was God
[59:18] choosing Abraham you can see it in our
[59:20] watch so he knew that Abraham would make
[59:23] that decision to follow him obediently
[59:26] but but once again it's still your
[59:28] choice that Brother Bruce said it's not
[59:30] just some some path that is created like
[59:32] some Greek mythology it's a path that
[59:34] you have to choose you have to walk of
[59:36] your own choosing
[59:38] now it was it was then so is today it
[59:41] isn't you choosing God is God choosing
[59:43] you think about that will be Revelations
[59:46] 21 6-8 and then we'll read a quote no
[59:49] close so Revelations 21 6-8
[1:00:01] and he said unto me it is done I am the
[1:00:04] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:00:07] end I will give unto him that is the
[1:00:10] thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life
[1:00:12] freely so whoever is thirsty
[1:00:15] drink on it we sing that song There's a
[1:00:17] we're saying that song there's a
[1:00:19] fountain if you're thirsty come and
[1:00:21] drink we need to be drinking at that
[1:00:22] Fountain more than we have been we have
[1:00:25] to
[1:00:26] verse 7 says
[1:00:29] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:00:32] things so God is calling us to be
[1:00:34] Overcomers and if we overcome
[1:00:37] all things will inherit will inherit all
[1:00:40] things it says and I will be his God and
[1:00:42] he shall be my son God has given you the
[1:00:45] overcoming power you need and it's in
[1:00:48] the Holy Ghost
[1:00:49] and you can't get any overcoming power
[1:00:51] outside of that
[1:00:53] help classes won't help motivational
[1:00:55] books won't help but the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:57] going to give you all the overcoming
[1:00:59] power that you need to overcome any and
[1:01:01] everything
[1:01:02] but you have to be willing to submit
[1:01:04] yourself to the Holy Ghost
[1:01:06] you have to
[1:01:08] but the fearful and unbelieving and the
[1:01:11] Abominable and the murderers and the
[1:01:12] whoremongers and the sorcerers and
[1:01:13] adulterers and the Liars shall all have
[1:01:15] their part in the lake which burns with
[1:01:17] fire
[1:01:18] in Brimstone which is the second death
[1:01:21] so I believe I believe we're none of
[1:01:23] those things I believe that we're
[1:01:25] Overcomers
[1:01:27] and you got to believe whatever
[1:01:28] situation that you're in that the god
[1:01:30] inside you can give you the strength you
[1:01:31] need to overcome it no matter if you've
[1:01:33] been there doing it for years months
[1:01:35] weeks God can give you the overcoming
[1:01:38] strength but you have to believe
[1:01:41] that you can do that you got to let go
[1:01:43] of the thing that's taking you away from
[1:01:46] God and brother Brahm said the same
[1:01:48] we're living a million miles below our
[1:01:50] privilege
[1:01:51] God has called us not to be Paupers not
[1:01:54] to be Sinners but he called us to be
[1:01:57] Sons and Daughters of God he calls us to
[1:01:59] be Kings and Priests he's calling us to
[1:02:02] be all these things but if we're not
[1:02:04] feeding on him and abiding in him and
[1:02:06] working on our personal relationship
[1:02:07] with God then we're not going to be able
[1:02:10] to recognize who we are because what are
[1:02:12] our idea what's our identity really is
[1:02:13] we'll go to Galatians 2 20.
[1:02:19] because our identity isn't described by
[1:02:22] some personality type but our identity
[1:02:24] is in Christ
[1:02:26] so Galatians 2 20. I am crucified with
[1:02:28] Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but
[1:02:32] Christ liveth in me that's your identity
[1:02:35] right there
[1:02:37] and the life which I now live in the
[1:02:39] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:02:41] God who loved me and gave himself
[1:02:43] fullness by Paul could say I know
[1:02:45] nothing but Christ and him crucified
[1:02:46] that's your identity as Jesus Christ
[1:02:48] your Miss Jesus Christ you're not X Y
[1:02:52] and Z about this personality over here
[1:02:54] but you're the word is going to identify
[1:02:56] who you are every single day every
[1:02:57] single night
[1:02:59] what makes what makes the people cry and
[1:03:01] shout and go on what's the matter it's
[1:03:03] the holy ghost moving in them if they
[1:03:06] could only realize and embrace him
[1:03:08] embrace the Holy Ghost believe him hug
[1:03:12] him to your bosom live right do nothing
[1:03:15] that would hinder him say oh Lord Jesus
[1:03:18] I want you I want you to stand by me I'm
[1:03:22] going to stand by you father and as you
[1:03:24] do he is just pressing to get into you
[1:03:28] he wants sitting there he is wooing you
[1:03:30] to him all the time
[1:03:32] now friends I know that to be the truth
[1:03:35] I know people realize who you are every
[1:03:38] person in here can live life above sin
[1:03:40] notice that every person in here can
[1:03:44] live
[1:03:45] life above sin
[1:03:48] I believe we all can do that
[1:03:52] can't live without sin Living God you'll
[1:03:55] make mistakes but the blood of Christ
[1:03:57] will forgive you that's why the
[1:03:58] scripture says be zealous therefore and
[1:04:00] repent you're going to make mistakes
[1:04:02] you're human
[1:04:03] but don't let those mistakes Define your
[1:04:06] future
[1:04:07] is going to be learn from those mistakes
[1:04:10] take take take take some time to
[1:04:13] recognize what led up to those mistakes
[1:04:15] because you want to make the same
[1:04:16] mistake again and ask for the same thing
[1:04:18] again repentance over the same exact
[1:04:20] thing be zealous therefore repent return
[1:04:23] away from that and just keep moving
[1:04:25] forward don't make the same mistake
[1:04:26] again
[1:04:29] mistakes but the blood of Christ will
[1:04:30] forgive you father forgive them for they
[1:04:33] know not what they do
[1:04:34] is that right that same power of Christ
[1:04:37] that was hung on calvary's cross the
[1:04:41] same God that raised him up on the day
[1:04:42] of the Resurrection is in you now
[1:04:45] you that's got the Holy Ghost oh don't
[1:04:47] you love him so that same power
[1:04:51] that was that was a hung on calvary's
[1:04:54] Cross
[1:04:55] is waiting for you to tap into it
[1:04:57] you have to be willing to tap into it
[1:05:01] it's like for instance I have all these
[1:05:04] I have all these nice to have a bank
[1:05:05] account I have all this money
[1:05:07] and if I can't tap into it's going to do
[1:05:09] me no good
[1:05:10] so that's like the riches of Christ he's
[1:05:11] given us a check
[1:05:13] sign his name and and like that but if
[1:05:16] we're not if we can't tap into it what
[1:05:17] good is it going to do us we got to tap
[1:05:19] into the things that God has given us
[1:05:21] and that's through worship through
[1:05:25] prayer through Revelation through
[1:05:27] obedience that's how it gets tapped into
[1:05:29] all those things get tapped into just
[1:05:31] like that
[1:05:34] man we get to stand
[1:05:40] so God chose us for a special assignment
[1:05:43] how many is willing to
[1:05:46] do that assignment how many is willing
[1:05:47] to accept that their mission
[1:05:50] this is bow our heads
