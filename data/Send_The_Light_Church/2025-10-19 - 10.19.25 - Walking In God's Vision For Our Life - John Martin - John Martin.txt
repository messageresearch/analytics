TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] I I just want to say thank you to everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because everybody like participated and working through everything and the I just appreciate everybody working together to give us the very very best that we have. &gt;&gt; Just a great appreciation I have and that ending with that course. Actually, the last two courses just really ties in with our message today. We were on the mind of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. even before the foundation of the world and Calvary was just a part where he still had us on his mind when he was suffering. &gt;&gt; And this morning, uh, we are on his mind. &gt;&gt; And it's all part of a vision that God has for us to see us through the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I really appreciate Brother Gordy doing that. He's uh just, you know, never practicing with us, never working with us, but uh just a willingness there, you know, I I just think that's a that's the body of Christ working together to help one another. We don't have to have things perfect. We just got to have a heart of love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would uh for our opening scripture. We're just going to read one verse today, and it's in Jeremiah 29:1. We want to entitle this walking in God's vision for our lives. Walking in God's vision for our lives. Before I read, I just want to let you know that brother Jose from um let me see why did I forget where he's from. Where is he from? Um what Kitchen Kitchen uh had sent his greetings today. Hopefully he's not watching me mess up this morning. Um, and uh, appreciate um, it's so good to see brother Charlie Neyma here, &gt;&gt; and I'm not sure, but I think this is the first time I've seen him look so good and and uh, just good to have him with us today. He's been gone a while. Amen. Amen. Before we begin reading, let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, thank you for your presence, Lord. Thank you for your people that brought you here today um to uh join together to make more of you in our midst. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just could not have you in this amount without one another. We just thank you for your grace in our lives. And as we come together, Lord, we have worshiped you. We have praised you in song and chorus in testimony and through through trusting you in prayer. &gt;&gt; Now Lord, as we enter into the uh word, we want to worship you in the the unveiling of the word of God. And &gt;&gt; pray Lord that you would fill the hungry &gt;&gt; this this morning, Lord, and draw us all closer to you. Let us leave here with uh more of you than when we came. Lord, as that one song, let our hearts burn within us. &gt;&gt; Lord, as you talk with us along the way, &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you and ask you to bless the reading of your word and the furtherance of this message. May you take these lips of clay, Lord, forgive me of my trespasses and sins, anything that would stand in the way that you just use this vessel to minister to your bride today. And God will give you the glory for it all. in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jeremiah chapter 29 verse number 11. For I know the thoughts I think toward you, sayeth the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not of evil. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. We were on his mind. Amen. We were on his mind not just at Calvary, but before the foundation of the world. And and God does have an expected end for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God's thoughts towards us are not the same thoughts that we have towards oursel our ourselves. Uh number one, God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts. Our thoughts are lower about our ourselves. Um our carnal mind, the Bible says, is emnity with the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that there is separating the two minds. And this is why we need to seek the mind of Christ uh which is the word of God for our lives. The mind of Christ is this word in in in process. &gt;&gt; It it's we don't have to like well I wonder what the mind of God is. No, we know what the mind of God is right here. &gt;&gt; We may not know where our next job is or what we're uh what we're going to be eating. Uh but we know how to conduct ourselves. We know how to act. We know the boundaries of our lives. We know what God wants for us. We know what we're to become. And that's all written in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Philippians 2:5 tells us, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; So just it's about the process of letting it happen. How do we how do we let it happen? How is the temperature for everybody today? &gt;&gt; Good. It feels a little bit, you know, a little bit chippery, but what we can do is um, you know, just um, get excited about the word and kind of warm things up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, let the same thoughts that God thinks, let them be in you. &gt;&gt; With the mind of Christ, we can know our expected end. We can know God's vision for our lives. Brother Brandham said, "Nothing but perfect love will enter in there." Now we're talking about the end here. &gt;&gt; Nothing but but perfect love can enter in that place. It was so perfect, so pure that brother Brandham said that there was no words in the English language or no language at all that could describe how that love really was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the expected end I mean God God has thoughts of us of an expected end. And I understand that I'm just going to take a portion of this this the this scripture today and I'm going to apply it to what God has for us for the end. And he wants us to walk in that vision for our lives today. Not just try to wait hopefully that we make it or we wing it, we get there. But no, God wants us walking in that. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 2:9 says, "But as it is written, I have not seen nor ear heard, neither have it entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him." &gt;&gt; Notice the criteria is loving God. &gt;&gt; If that's not there, everything is off the books. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything is off the books. Love has to be there. But God hath revealed them unto us how by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, say the spirit of man which is in him, even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; See, we have to have the mind of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we can't we can't wing it on our natural intellect and our ability to kind of figure out things. &gt;&gt; It's with the mind of Christ that we can know our expected end. &gt;&gt; And it's when we receive revelation of God's word. I'll just say it like this. When you literally receive revelation of God's word that now becomes the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's the mind of Christ that speaks to you. It's the mind of Christ that reveals himself to you. And as you receive revelation, that becomes the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's how we can have the mind of Christ. We can't have the mind of Christ by just the knowledge of the Bible, &gt;&gt; by just the knowledge of the scriptures &gt;&gt; by by uh John 3:16. No, that is that he hid it from the wise and prudent. I mean, scholars can know the Bible inside and out uh as far as knowing the scriptures and really never know God. &gt;&gt; So, it it's this word has to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that we've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's our expected end that we're going to be in the same image of God. The Bible teaches us that the world is being conformed more and more, right? &gt;&gt; We can see Satan's image is being more and more manifested out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bible says that Satan deceiveth the whole world. Uh and he he's he's getting them to take he's getting them to compromise. &gt;&gt; That's right. You you see the world the church world compromise compromise compromise more and more become let more things into the uh let more things into the government let more things into the church let more things into the home compromise compromise &gt;&gt; the world is becoming more into the image of Satan &gt;&gt; Jesus said that that he wasn't of the world he says we're not of the world and he prayed that we would be kept from the world &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:16 says, "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the world." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; "And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof." Verse 15, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. For if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how can we love God and have those things prepared for us if we're loving the world? There is a separation with a believer. He does not love the world, all the things of the world. He has a love for God inside of him. &gt;&gt; Paul taught the the Roman church to to to actively uh be working with uh changing their mind. And he said it here in Romans 12:E 2, speaking from the world to God, staying in the same vein. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed. Oh, I love that word. &gt;&gt; Be not conformed to the things of happening in this world, but be transformed by the renewing of the way that you think &gt;&gt; that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, that is to every person in this church, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, &gt;&gt; but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith. &gt;&gt; So pride has a way of lifting you up and say, "I'm just going to do what I want to do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is not soberly. That's that's high. That's the same thing Satan had. Well, you know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to leave God's authority and I'm going to go build my own kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that he offered that to Eve and he offers that to the to the really he's offering that to the church world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they still feel that that uh security, but it's a false sense of security. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There there really when you leave the word, you leave God. &gt;&gt; And you leave God, there is nothing for you. Nothing can save you. Nothing's going to save you out there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the God has come to save us from the worldly nature. &gt;&gt; Most believers don't think very soberly. But they don't think it's a sober thing to suffer. But we have to suffer to become like Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to there is no way that we can sit in a comfortable life and through intellect uh get character &gt;&gt; because brother Bam said character is only b only built in the fiery furnace of trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That isn't part way you can get it and the other part way you can get it is is on a comfortable lazy boy. &gt;&gt; Right. So you have to be willing to suffer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're you decide that in your mind, I am going to be transformed by renewing the way I think. In other words, I'm not going to think anymore the way the world thinks. Just kind of wing it, do what you want. Uh fake it, whatever it might be. But I'm actually going to subject myself to the word. Well, when you subject yourself to the word, your flesh is suffering &gt;&gt; because your flesh don't want to do that. Your flesh don't want to come under subjection to the word and and come under obedience to the word. So, there is a suffering that takes place in us in order to be transformed. &gt;&gt; But God has not given us the spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But of power and of love and of a sound mind. That's a sober mind. &gt;&gt; God wants us to think soberly. The only way we can think soberly is yield to the spirit of God because the spirit of the devil is confusion. The Bible says that Satan is the author of confusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and God is the author of sound mind. &gt;&gt; A sound mind is the way that God thinks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts I think towards you. They're sound thoughts. They're not wishy-washy. One day I want you, one day I don't. No. God wants us. He died for us. He did everything he can. Now he's given us his word that we may dress oursel and become like the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's sober mind, a sober mind is the way that God thinks. It's full of of humility. That's why the Bible says that that that we should not think more highly than we ought to think. Brother Rand one place says if you lift your eyes above the dust, you're lifting yourself above what God made you from. &gt;&gt; Always remember who you really are. &gt;&gt; It is by the grace of God that we are his bride. &gt;&gt; I just want to read verse one of Romans 12:1. This is a sobering thinking of God here. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your body, a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. Now, we all know what sacrifices are. We've all heard of the Mayans and the different people who've offered sacrifices, and we've probably even heard of it today. people offering things as sacrifices and they can be animals and they can Hey, there's people that even done human beings. &gt;&gt; And we we think of a sacrifice as something you just you just cut it, you dye it, it's done, and it's over with. But Paul is saying that that's not how Christians are. Christians die daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christians present themselves to the Lord daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um Paul is saying this is the reasonable service of a Christian. &gt;&gt; This this this may not be the the denominational belief of all I got to do is repent, get baptized, and okay, I'm saved. No. No. God, you give your life to God. Your life belongs to God. That's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; And now you give yourself to be used by God on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we present our mind to think God's thoughts. We present our body to live out God's thoughts. We just present ourselves a complete living sacrifice. Have thy own way, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the full mind of Christ will lead us to the vision that Christ has for our lives. And that's God's expected end. And we just need to follow this sacrificial life to get there. In other words, you're not going to get to the end your way. &gt;&gt; There's two ways. One is straight and narrow and the other is broad. You do not get to the expected end, the broad way. You do not. It leads to destruction. It's the straight and narrow path that leads you onto life. &gt;&gt; Accepting the word of God into your lives will produce the mind of Christ, which is a sacrificial life. You have to accept the word of God. You can't come to church, read your Bible, listen to the tapes, hear what the prophet said, and say, you know, I don't feel like doing that today. You might as well just I don't feel like expected to end today. But see, what Satan wants to do, he wants to tell you, you don't have to do that, and you can still make it. I'm telling you, that's a lie from hell. &gt;&gt; That is a lie from hell. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; We have to follow a sacrificial life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that is what's leading us to the expected end. Turn with me if you would to first Peter chapter 2 verse 21. How many believes the word today? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This word is what are it gives us strength right to to to follow God with all of our heart. First Peter chapter 2 vers 21 says for even here unto were we all called. We were called &gt;&gt; because Christ also suffered for us at Calvary. Right? That's our last chorus there. Leaving us an example that we should follow his steps. His his steps. His steps. His his steps. He's willing to suffer to see God's family come back together. We've got to be willing to suffer to see us come into the image of Jesus Christ. Now, the Bible says that who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth. Who when he was vowed, he vowed not again. When he suffered, he threatened not, but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. So, here it is. He's the he's he's perfect. He's sinless. He's done no wrong. Pilate says, "I find no fault in him. He's an absolute lamb of God, peerless, without any blemishes. He's done nothing to ever hurt anybody. And yet, he's willing to suffer that you and I might be saved. &gt;&gt; A and Peter's saying, "This is the example that you got to follow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to go to a cross, but you have a cross to bear. &gt;&gt; You have to suffer. You have to die out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because one is there's no other way that you will become in the image of Jesus Christ unless you're willing to die out. That's number one. Number two is that God wants to use your life to spread the gospel to somebody else that needs salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter chapter 2:13, that same chapter. We're just going to come down and we're going to see in this chapter that that that God wants us to be willing to suffer and come under subjection to to all authority. &gt;&gt; And I start with verse number 13. I'm going to read through this kind of quickly. Submit yourself to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the king or the supreme or unto governors as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers. For or and for the praise of them that do well for in so for so is the will of God that with welloing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men. So God wants us to submit ourselves. You know most Christians don't want to be H God is calling. God is a God of order. &gt;&gt; God is not a God of free-for-all. &gt;&gt; You know, you go do what you want to do. No, there's with God, there's headship. &gt;&gt; And when you stay under that headship, then you're under the protection of God. &gt;&gt; But you get out of that headship and then you start doing what you want to do, you are outside of God's boundaries. Amen. &gt;&gt; And under God's umbrella now, he's just telling us that we need to be under subjection to every ordinance of man. Why? For the Lord's sake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a Christian wanting to, you know, go against the government and go against the police and go against this and and let's even blow up the abortion clinics and let's do this. But we're going to stand there and say, "Yeah, I'm a Christian. This is not representing who Christ is. &gt;&gt; That's not what Christ did. &gt;&gt; So, we have a word that we come under subjection to. We stay under subjection to that. And then when people look at your life, they say, "Yes, you're a Christian." &gt;&gt; That's how they're going to know. &gt;&gt; Okay. And in verse 16, as free. As free. We're free. Not using our liberty to kind of go do whatever we want to do for a cloak of maliciousness, but as servants of God. In other words, take your life and serve somebody. Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king. Servants. Be subject to your masters with all fear. Not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraward. For this is thankw worthy of a man for conscience towards God. He endures grief. He suffers wrongfully. For what glory is it? For when you're buffeted for your faults and you take it patiently, but excuse me, but if when you do well and suffer for it and you take it patiently, this is what is acceptable with God. Because this is exactly what Jesus Christ did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He suffered. He didn't have to suffer, but he suffered that he might help others. And a lot of times, people don't want to suffer to help others. &gt;&gt; To me, it shows that the spirit of Christ isn't there. I'm I'm sorry, but if Christ is in you, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he will live for others. That's what brother Brandham said. Eternal life is living for others. Sometimes people don't even want to die out to become like Christ. How are you going to die out to live for somebody? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the mind of Christ. This is the vision of God for our lives. And it will lead us to what? Our predestination. Something's got to lead us there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, come imagine if I was still in the world today, right? God tugged on my heart when I was 16, 17 years old. And what if I just decided I'm going to stay in the world because somebody gave me the scripture. I'm predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And every time the devil comes or every time a Christian comes and says, you know, you got to start following the word and say, "No, I don't. No, I don't. I'm predestinated." That's what the devil does with the word predestinated. &gt;&gt; He makes you think that you don't have to get in line with the word and you're still okay. It's a false sense of security. &gt;&gt; We need to continue following Christ's example for our lives. Philippians chapter 2 verse one. Philippians chapter 2 verse one. If there be any consolation, we're going to touch on that word at the end of the service, God willing. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if there be any comfort of love, if there be any fellowship of the spirit, if there be any bowels of mercy, fulfill ye my joy, that you be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord and one mind. God wants us to be like him. He wants us to be in his image. He wants us to be willing to suffer, crucify the flesh, that we can actually be in one mind, that we can be in one core, that we can be like-minded, that we can have fellowship under the umbrella of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let nothing nothing be done through drama through I'm going to prove a point. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to control you. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory. Amen. Everybody say amen to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in loneliness, see, no man ought to think himself more highly than he ought to. But in loneliness of mind, let each person esteem the other person better than themselves. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean find somebody who's a little bit better than you and esteem them. When Jesus taught us to wash one another's feet, he taught us to find someone that was lower than us and esteem them better than ourselves. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're so caught up in in in thinking that we're something that we don't got time to esteem somebody. &gt;&gt; You know what that is? That is the mind of Satan. &gt;&gt; That's being conformed to the world. And the Bible is teaching me right now. Teaching me, John Martin, to be transformed by the renewing of my mind. Do what the word says. Just do what the word says. It will lead you to your desired haven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just sitting in the church for so many years and and never manifesting the character of Christ. &gt;&gt; That doesn't get you in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let nothing be done through strife and vain glory, but loneliness of mind. Let each esteem other better. I'm going to tell you something today. When you leave church today, find somebody in this church that you're going to esteem better than yourself. &gt;&gt; I think, you know, sometimes we don't even know how to do that. &gt;&gt; You know, we're so full of pride that we actually don't know how to esteem somebody. We're actually wanting somebody to come to us and say something to us. &gt;&gt; Just do what the gospel says and you will become the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you when you do the gospel, you get the mind of Christ, it will lead you to the expected end. Because I'm going to tell you, there's going to be a lot of people that come to me in that day and say, "Lord, Lord, didn't I prophesy? Didn't I speak in tongues? Did I do many wonderful works?" And then what I profess unto them, I never knew you. &gt;&gt; But you notice, Brother Brandham said, character is the only thing you're taking with you when you leave. character. And what character did he describe when he was over on the other side? What character did he describe? Perfect love. Now, you tell me. It doesn't take a scientist to figure out where we need to be going. &gt;&gt; It we don't have the pyramid in here, but the p, you know, it's perfect love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon said rapturing faith is in the tapes. It's in those tapes that we get perfect faith. And brother Bren says it takes perfect faith &gt;&gt; to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; And we need perfect love for perfect faith to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So fall in love. We got to fall in love with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So let nothing be done the wrong way, but have a humble heart and think about others. Verse four says, "Look not every uh look not every man on his own things." Hey, look at me. Look at me. Look at me, but every man also on the things of others. Okay, I want everyone to say amen to that one. We're taught this is the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let this mind, this mind that I've just described, be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God because he was God manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't he didn't look at it as robbery. &gt;&gt; Didn't he say, "I don't you know I could call for 12 legions of angels right now. He was equal with God. He was God manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could do anything he wanted to do. But what did he chose to do? He chose to have the mind of Christ, humility. But he made himself verse seven of no reputation. He made himself of no reputation. It wasn't look at me. And he took upon him the form of a servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he he actually humbled himself more and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the example that Christ is telling us to follow, that Paul's telling us, that Peter's telling us, that the word tells us to follow, that we, the way that we get to our expected end is to humble ourselves onto dying out to our own flesh. &gt;&gt; That the character of Christ might be manifested. Because if we don't got that mentality about humility and dying out, I'm telling you, when you go into a trial, you're not going to humble yourself and you're not going to see God there and you're not going to get the character that you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to be set before a trial comes. &gt;&gt; Tell me what lawyer, what attorneys, what lawyers going to court and they're not prepared, &gt;&gt; right? Tell me what World Series is going to get together or what Super Bowl or whatever it might be, two teams coming together if they're not prepared. &gt;&gt; Even Jesus said to two two two armies going out to war. Uh if if they're not prepared, what's going to happen? If we're not prepared that I'm going to surrender my life to Jesus Christ when you go into a trial, I'm telling you, you're going to flip like a you're going to be like a fish out of water. you're going to be just crazy going, you know, emotions and all this uh uh confusion going on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You got to know, you got to be like, you got to know that you're going to meet God in that fiery furnace. That he's going to be there when you get there. &gt;&gt; He's going to lead you through. &gt;&gt; The mind of Christ is to surrender &gt;&gt; to the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the mind of Christ. To surrender to the will of God. If any man come after me, let him deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me. And And where is God leading his bride? To an expected end. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To perfection, &gt;&gt; to the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the beginning, God wanted man in his own image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "Let us make man in our own image." Today, God has that same desire. He hasn't changed his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There he spoke the word and it happened and man chose his way and it caused this fall. And brother Brandon says it put every one of us in the same position that he did with Adam and Eve. We have a choice to make. We're either going to choose to become in the image of Christ or we're going to choose to put peacock feathers and just feel like we're the, you know, we're a decent guy or decent Christian. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Th this this word you ought to ought to love this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is just the word of God. Romans chapter 8 29 says for whom he did forno &gt;&gt; he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. This is the end. The end is to be like him. The end isn't to make it to heaven. What good would heaven be if we're like carnal, selfish? Hey Joe, remember what you did to me the other day? &gt;&gt; You know what? I'm going to get back at you at that. Can you imagine heaven being filled with, "Hey, look at me. I'm better than you." &gt;&gt; Or, "You know what? I remember when that person lied to me. I'm just going to like not be friends with him. So you see, we've got to get our character to be like Jesus Christ. And our focus needs to be in having a vision &gt;&gt; in this this process, this journey that God is taking us through right now to get us to where we need to be &gt;&gt; because now is the time for our character to be built. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll be honest with you, today, today, every one of us has gone through a trial. Amen. &gt;&gt; Today, everybody's gone everybody's gone through a trial to some degree &gt;&gt; and and and and and we could say that number of us could probably number a number of things that was a trial to us. &gt;&gt; But it was in those trials that if you you go in there with the mindset, God, I am willing to just die out and to become like you because I know all things are working for the good. I I know I'm supposed to count it all joy in these trials. Something good is going to happen in my character. may not be for my flesh. I may not, you know, get a fanf fair. I may not get more money. I I may not get everything I want to eat, but I know that I'm going to become more like Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, we're not conformed to this world, but we're being conformed to the image of the son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's why the world's becoming the carnal believer is becoming more like the world &gt;&gt; and the bride is becoming more like Christ. &gt;&gt; And it's happening right in the church. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. It's happening right in the home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it isn't like, oh, the Democrats and Republicans. I'm sorry. That ain't it. It's the it it's the bride and it's the makeel believers. &gt;&gt; And here's the thing. It don't matter if we can prove to one another what we think we are. &gt;&gt; It matters what we're living. &gt;&gt; Because by this shall all men know you're my disciples. &gt;&gt; When you have the same image of Christ in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you have love one for another, that is the same image of Christ. We're being transformed when our minds think according to the word. So, we come to church, we hear the word, we listen to taste, we hear the word. We read the Bible, we hear the word. We're praying, we hear the word, and the word tells us to do something. There should be a hunger inside of us that says, "Yes, Lord, I'm going to do it." That is showing that you're on the track to your expected end. &gt;&gt; But to go ahead and not do nothing about your character and expect somehow to get there, there's going to be a whole lot of people like that. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, you talk about God in real time. You talk about um recognizing God at the service. &gt;&gt; You talk about, "Oh, I saw God there and this happened and that happened." I'm telling you, God is more with you than you realize through the course of the day. &gt;&gt; He just waiting for you to step in that and believe that &gt;&gt; and and and don't try to be looking for other ways to get character. &gt;&gt; It's just not going to come. God's going to place a trial in front of you and you either you're going to walk in it with faith or you're going to say, "Oh, I'm scared. I'm not going to do that. &gt;&gt; I wish it wasn't happening to me." Now look, I'm on your side. Don't get mad at me. &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm trying to build your faith muscles. &gt;&gt; God is not going to put you through something and not be there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God not going to put anything on you that you can't bear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look, we're in the manifesting times right now. &gt;&gt; And everybody's making their choice which way they're going. &gt;&gt; But for me in my house, I will serve the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Though none go with me still, I'll follow his example of suffering. &gt;&gt; Verse 30. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and them he called, them he also justified, and to whom he justified, them he also glorified. What shall we say to these things? What shall we then say to these things? If this is a true statement, if God be before us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; That's the testimony that God is wanting us to really have. Not something that we quote, but then we go through a trial, we wonder where God's at. What we wanted to be doing is in the middle of our trial when our when our baby's dead or our son's dead, all is well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To be able to look death in the eye and still say, "All is well." &gt;&gt; That's the kind of faith I want. And this word is what builds our faith. getting in sync with God, getting in sync with the mind of Christ, nothing shall be able to separate us from God's vision for our lives. If God before us, who can be against us? No tribulation, no distress, no persecution, no famine, no nakedness, no peril, no sword. None of these things are going to distract us from our walk in our walk with God's vision for our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, I know this stuff's going on. It ain't good. I understand that. But you know what? God's still building character in me, and I'm not going to get distracted by this. I'm not going to wait till this trial is over. I'm not gonna wait till this thing is done so I can have more confidence. &gt;&gt; We are more than conquerors through Christ. That's what the Bible says. We're more than conquerors. We are persuaded this morning that nothing can separate us from God's vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing. No demonic angels, no principalities, no powers, no things present, things to come, not in this life, not even death. We're going to make it because we have accepted the word of God for our lives. This is the only thing. This is the only thing. A love for the truth, a love for the word, a love to become it. We're going to go through trials. That's all there is to it. We're going to have to suffer in order to get character that we need. 1 Peter 4:19 says, "Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God," notice, "commit the keeping of their souls to him in welloing as unto a faithful creator." So here's our God that loves us. He He's a God of all comfort, but he also he doesn't stop us from suffering. It it pleased the father to bruise Christ. God is when we go through a trial, you know, I I just I can just see God saying, "Oh, I have a care. There's a chance for character to be built right now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when they're, you know, they're at they're on their lazy boy, the feet's up and they're watching the football game and, you know, everything is rosy. Time is being wasted for character to be built. I think God, the mind of Christ is different than than our minds. &gt;&gt; Paul said in 2 Timothy 1:12, "For which cause I also suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. What did he what did he commit to God? What did Paul commit to God? Jesus said in Matthew 16:26, "For what is a man profited if he would gain the whole world and lose his soul?" &gt;&gt; Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? &gt;&gt; Paul committed his soul to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he did that by submitting his life to the word. That is how you know you you you give your soul to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You don't just say, "Here, Lord, I give you my soul, but but you don't submit to the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, you give your soul to Christ as you're as you're submitting to the word. You're putting your your soul under the protection of the word of God because that's the only thing that can save your soul. &gt;&gt; That's why the word has to become more important to you because your soul is hid in that word. Paul was persuaded that God was not going to throw away his soul &gt;&gt; because he committed it to to the word of God. Paul had a a revelation of God's image and he knew that he hadn't attained it yet. He knew that he hadn't apprehended it yet. And after 30 something years, he said, "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." We can find this in Philippians 3:15. Now it says, "Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded." &gt;&gt; Have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if anything be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. In other words, if you've got the mind of Christ, you're going to pre pressing in. &gt;&gt; What are you pressing into? What What are you pressing into? &gt;&gt; You're you're pressing into the character of Christ. &gt;&gt; Not the knowledge of it, but to be able to walk like he walked. &gt;&gt; To be able to get slapped in the face and turn your cheek. to to be able to go the second and the third mile, to be able to lay down your life for one another. And so, as we're evaluating ourselves this morning with the word of God, ask yourself, do do you have all the mind of Christ that you need? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there more that you're wanting? &gt;&gt; Because it is the mind of Christ that will lead you to the expected end. God says, "I know the thoughts I think toward you, sayeth the Lord." They're thoughts of peace. They're the right thoughts. But understand, the father had the right thoughts about Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But think about what he had to go through to get the expected end. &gt;&gt; I mean, he had to be he had to suffer. He he was bruised for our transgressions. the the chastisement of our peace was upon him. He he took away our our our iniquities. He he suffered for us. He had to go through that process. And then on Calvary for the joy that was set before them, I he endured the cross because the end our thoughts of peace. He is our peace. But just because we have an expected end, it doesn't mean we don't have to suffer to get there. &gt;&gt; It's through suffering that we get there. &gt;&gt; It's through suffering, through dying out that we come in the image of Christ that we can literally literally live the life of loving for others. &gt;&gt; You know, it's easy to give money when you got it. &gt;&gt; And did you know it's easy to not give money when you don't got it? But just try living for others &gt;&gt; because God is calling us to his image. And Paul said, "I got the mind of Christ. I'm pressing towards that. I have an apprehended there. I wrote 14 books of the Bible. I'm one called out of a due season." And um Jesus said, "I I called him and he's going to have to suffer many things for me." Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; And he's called us. We're predestinated. He's called us. He's chosen us. But we're going to have to suffer for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think this is a bad thing. &gt;&gt; I don't think there's anything to be discouraged about. &gt;&gt; That's right. I &gt;&gt; I think what we got to do is sink our our heart into the plan of God for our lives and accept that this is the way to become into his image. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you don't believe me, just wait till later next week and see the trial you go through &gt;&gt; and may this word come to your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this is the truth that's being ministered today. &gt;&gt; We need the mind of Christ. We need the higher thoughts of God, which is the word of God to reach the expected end, which is the image of Christ in our life. That's what we've been predestinated to. So let us therefore as as be uh let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded. &gt;&gt; So it it's the perfect is just if I could just say it like this is that you have the complete mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that you don't you don't make any mistakes. It's just you got the complete mind of Christ. you're you're willing to walk the way that the Bible has taught us to walk to to be transformed every time we you know, brother Brandon says you never leave the church the same way you came. &gt;&gt; You're either drawn closer or further away. So you're you're either going to be transformed by the renewing of your mind when the word comes and you really mean business with God. You really mean amen from your heart or you're just going to walk away and quietly reject it. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Same when you listen to tapes. So it takes a willingness to suffer, to die out to the flesh, to become more like Christ. Romans 8:18 says, "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us." &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for us to be manifested. &gt;&gt; It's waiting on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to just say it's waiting on them. I want to be part of them. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of the sons of God that are are manifested. And it's not just for them to manifest and for me to say, "Oh, yeah. I'm a part." But let the redeemed of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let those that are are are are his child stand up and say, "I I I'm I'm I'm manifesting Christ today. I'm going to get up and I'm going to manifest Christ today. &gt;&gt; I can't wait to do it, too. &gt;&gt; I'm excited. I'm excited to be able to turn my cheek. &gt;&gt; I'm excited to forgive somebody. To love mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. To bind it around my neck. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To love truth. To let let Christ come forth out of me. &gt;&gt; It isn't at the pulpit that we just see Christ. We all have a pulpit every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're written epistles read of all men. So the prophet said that character is not a gift, but it's a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what is it? A victory over our flesh. It's a victory over our flesh. It's not it's it's not brother it's not me having victory over brother Ben's flesh. You don't put him in his place, tell him what he needs to do. No, character is a victory over my nature, my carnal nature, and I've got to be willing to suffer, die out to what I want that the love of Christ might be manifested in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Character is literally created in the furnace. And when you're willing to walk in your trial without fear, without murmuring, without complaining, trusting that you're going to meet the son of God in your trial. &gt;&gt; And there his love. You know what's going to protect you from the flames? His love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What protected the three Hebrew children when they went in? &gt;&gt; It was God's love that kept the flames off of them. But notice those flames actually burned those that threw them in. &gt;&gt; That's right. They did. &gt;&gt; They didn't love God. They didn't love the word. But the three Hebrews, they did. Every day we we we go through trials. You got to step in there without murmuring, without complaining, without saying, "Oh Lord, why me?" You got to go in there and you got to you got to believe. I love you, God. I I don't want to go through this trial, but I love you, God. I'm going to walk in there. I'm gonna trust in you and your love is going to protect me. &gt;&gt; I I'm not looking to anybody to change my circumstances. I'm looking to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're the one that orchestrated it. You're the one that has allowed it. That's why Jesus said, "Come buy of me gold tried in the fire. It can handle the fire." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't sit there and and and and revile back and say, "No, you shouldn't do this. I, you know, don't put that crown of thorns on me. Don't Don't whip me. Uh don't chastise me. Uh don't tell me I I I know who's doing everything. Even though he was blindfolded, he knew everything. But he stood there as a lamb. &gt;&gt; Lord, not my will but thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God wants to use you the same way. Jesus is our example &gt;&gt; to follow his example. Now this choice that you are making is a willingness when you walk in that trial is a willingness to die out to your fleshly nature that doesn't want to suffer only so you can manifest perfect love because what good does it do to be able to be real nice and kind when everything's going good &gt;&gt; that you know even the publicans do the same. But I'm telling you, when you are willing to walk in every trial for the purpose, I'm going to manifest Christ. I'm going to tell you, you're going to grow like gang busters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the what is our natural thing to think about when we go into a trial? Our first nature is I want out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you want out of there. You you want out of character. That's why some people go through life trial after trial after trial and they have no more character than they did 20 years ago &gt;&gt; because they never walked in God's vision for their life. See, this is the thing about this message. This this is giving us a sight of God for our lives. &gt;&gt; This is God showing us how to become more like him &gt;&gt; where in the world you don't get that. You just, you know, you go through trials and you become more hard. You become more bitter. It was the same son that made uh Pharaoh hard soften Moses's heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 13:34 says, "I new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another as I have loved you, that you also love one another." Now, I'm going to be honest with you. If you are going to love me the way that Christ loves me, you're going to have to be dead to your flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't be able to put peacock feathers in and love me. You can't get warm by a painted fire. &gt;&gt; You can't fake it. You can't have a form of godliness. If I am going to love you the way that Christ loved me, then I am going to have to die out to my flesh. Now, this is the commandment that we love one another as Christ loved us. And when we can do that, I'm going to tell you, we're ready. &gt;&gt; I just I hate to say it. Brother Brandon said, this is how important it is. lay aside everything else in life until you can get to the place that you can love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even your enemy, he said &gt;&gt; he said that should be your priority in life. That is the image. We don't got time. I'm we don't got time to go through everything, but this I want to say the image of Christ. The Bible says God is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to know the image of God is love. &gt;&gt; And perfect love cast out all fear &gt;&gt; that you can have boldness on the day of judgment. &gt;&gt; This is God's vision for our life. &gt;&gt; This is what we've been predestined to. &gt;&gt; This is what we're supposed to be walking into. &gt;&gt; But we don't like we don't get in a car and just get there. What we do is we go through our daily trials to get there &gt;&gt; because it's through the trial that we is it it's through the day that we go through a trial and through that trial we we have a chance to get character and we build a little bit little bit little bit little bit little bit before you know it we can look back and we can overcome a lot more in our lives than we used to. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And you know what that is? It's a perfect love for the word of God. It's a perfect love for the word of God because perfect love is I am willing to die out. For instance, if somebody if brother Stan I if he slapped me in the face and he said, "Look, I've been wanting to do this for about three years and he wales off and he hits me." I would probably say, "Brother Stan, I had that coming. Why'd you wait so long? Now, the Now, the thing is, the devil is going to tell me a lot of things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's not fair. That wasn't right. That that Christians don't do that. &gt;&gt; Remember David said when he got spit on, the Lord told him to. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The devil's going to give you a lot of things to reason about that situation, but in reality, what God gave me is a gift to be able to go through that trial and love him regardless. &gt;&gt; Now, do you think I would trade anything in this world for the character of God to be able to love those that hate me? I wouldn't trade it for anything. There ain't enough money. There ain't enough popularity. There ain't enough anything to be able to love from my heart. I look at trials a little bit different. And here's the biggest thing with a trial. When a trial comes, the first thing that happens in our life is fear floats. Fear. Fear comes. Oh, the what are we going to do? We don't have to know what we're going to do. We don't have to answer the devil's questions. &gt;&gt; Alls we need to do is trust in God. &gt;&gt; And when you trust in God, his love becomes your shield. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Becomes your peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Becomes even your joy. &gt;&gt; You can have joy in the middle of your suffering. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I would rather take this word and the message that God sent in this hour to open the word to me to really let me know who Jesus Christ is than all the things that anybody could ever tell me. God has a vision for us saints. Let's stand together. God has a vision for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's wanting us to walk in that vision today. Not to wait, but to know what it is and to walk in it. To become just like him. And this this vision is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; Remember, there were 70 that walked away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I just I just want to say I I I only got literally through half of the sermon. Through half of the sermon, God I I I I trust that God will reveal this to us because if he wanted it to be different, it would be different. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Make me more like thee, Jesus. Make me more like thee. Give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee. Oh, make me more like thee, Jesus. Make me more like thee. Be a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee. [Applause] Oh, make me more. Amen. Lord, we want to be like you, Jesus. Make me more like thee. Oh, give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee. [Applause] Create in me a clean heart, oh God. and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from thee. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. Come and renew a right spirit within me. [Music] Create in me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Create in me a clean heart, oh God. [Music] I'll renew a right spirit within me. me. Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right spirit within me. Amen. As they continue to play that quietly, if we could just all bow our hearts, bow our heads if you can. Close your eyes if just want to invite you to just give this time over to God. Let him reverently speak to his children oneon-one without anyone looking. I wonder if there'd be anyone here today that would want to be remembered in prayer. Maybe there's some things that you haven't been willing to give up. Maybe there's some things that you didn't think it was that big a deal. Maybe maybe just the mere fact that getting caught up in Leodysa and having a lukewarmness of just not pressing into the fullness of his character. Maybe you're here today and you know that you ought to be pressing in more than you than you have been. Maybe you just you want to mean more business with the Lord Jesus today. Maybe you're here today. There's just something inside says, "I don't want to miss it, Lord. I want to be there. Maybe you just want to be remembered in prayer today. Believe God is here to do exceedingly above all that we could ask or think. And I could just say it like this. I know that his presence is here and he wants to give us our heart's desire. If your heart's desire is that expected end that he has for you, I want you to believe with all your heart as we go to him in prayer. Just believe. Believe. For Jesus said, "Only believe. All things are possible." Lord, we come to you this day knowing that the gates of hell are trying to prevail against us. That every demon of doubt and discouragement and dismay is fighting against your bride. is trying to get us from taking all that you have given us, Lord, your word as a as a shield for of our protection to keep us from all the tactics of the enemy. And you've told us to put on the whole armor of God. today. Lord, we thank thee that you've given us thy word. Thy words our spirit and their life. And God, we embrace your word today. We embrace your word. We embrace the vision that you have for our lives, Lord. God, you see our our hearts, Lord. You saw our hands. You saw the hands lifted in our heart. just see the the sincerity and the the realness, Lord, that that there is inside of us, God. And Father, we pray that you would take each one of our situations, each one of our desires, each one of our prayers, each one of our our cares, and we're casting them upon you today, knowing that you care for us. Lord, you told us, Lord, to that you would bear you'd bear our burden, Lord. Lord, we thank you, Lord Jesus. You just told us to take your yoke and put it upon us. And Lord, we willingly take this yoke and put it upon us, Lord. Lord, whatever you would have us to do, whatever pain it may cause, Lord, we know that you are leading us by your spirit to the expected end, Lord, into all truth. The truth, Lord, that you are you're the God of not just love, but you are love. And Lord, that we are going to be in your image, and we're going to love just like you love. for you. Said, "By this shall all men know that that you're my disciples when you have the same love one for another that I've had for you, God. We embrace it today. We accept it today, oh God, and we trust you, Lord, for these uh these things that we've laid at your feet at the altar today, Lord. We believe that you are going to bring to pass, Lord, for our lives. Such a victory, God. A victory. This is your victory that overcometh the world, even your faith. And we're trusting in you, Lord, over this victory, over this worldly nature that has tried to keep us down and keep us from fighting the good fight of faith. and and some of us were just laying hold of eternal life and and pressing in the way we should, Lord. But today, God, we're just believing in you today to bring us up. Bring us closer and we're we're trusting you for it today, Lord. We love you. We love you. We love you with all of our heart. We give you the praise. We give you the honor, Lord. Bless your bride. Bless your people. Bless them. I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We thank you. We thank you now for it, Lord.
