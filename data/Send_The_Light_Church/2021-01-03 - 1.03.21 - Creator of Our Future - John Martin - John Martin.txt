in the fields and the the trees it just I just really really enjoyed it of course it's not as enjoyable driving in it you just got to drive slow and cautious but uh I I certainly en enjoyed seeing it amen let's just look to the Lord in in prayer before we read here in God's precious word father We Stand absolutely helpless Without You Today We Know Thy word is true we know it's forever settled we know it'll be there on the day of judgment it'll be there through eternity it's never ever going to change but Lord in our human ability to understand exactly what you meant uh we don't have that within us only you have the words of eternal life only you can Quicken Thy word to our hearts and father we pray at this time that you would uh take all thoughts of the world of of the things that we have gone through the things of the past week all the problems all the pressures all the doubts and fears just take them all away and help us just to be so closed in in your word today we just hear nothing but your still small voice speaking to us uh showing us Lord the things that you would have for us today through your word Quicken Us by the Holy Spirit today Lord we pray that you'd bind up every Spirit of Doubt every spirit of fear of confusion of question of any anxiety oh God we know it's on a rampage but we ask that you just bind it up and rebuke it today and Lord let the love and peace and mercy and grace of God be amongst us bless Thy word Lord we commit this service with every need that there would be represented today into your hands trusting you that you'll just meet that need now for we ask these things and give you the praise for them now in Jesus precious name amen amen Isaiah chapter 43 Verse number 18 and 19 remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert amen God bless you you may be seated well before we get going in this message I just want to say Happy New Year to everybody God bless you and God grant to each of you a a happy and prosperous year as you as you trust the Lord the world has very little uh to be happy about and there's very little things that actually make them happy uh we have uh had an unpredictable deadly virus that has caused the economy to uh be crippled as you know numerous shutdowns separations from our family and our friends unwanted mask and really unknown vaccines what's going to happen evil people are taking advantage to the situation uh trying to destroy our democracy and our freedom just not caring about people the world is wanting a better year a happier year they're constantly feeding on bad news which makes it impossible to be happy but to the bride I want to say God bless you and keep pressing into God's presence keep pressing in keep feeding on the word keep praying it'll make you happy despite everything that's happening around you in the world happiness isn't depending on the world's situation the world's condition our our happiness is in the Lord amen Proverbs 16 verse2 says who so trusteth in the Lord happy is he just from trusting in the Lord when the Queen of Sheba finally got to the presence of King Solomon she said in First Kings chapter 10:8 happy are thy men happy are thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom so I say stay in the presence of your king and listen to the word it will keep you happy amen it will Pros ER you amen third John verse one uh chapter 1 uh and and verse two says beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul prosperous so God bless us with a prosperous and new year but we're not looking at it as the world says happy New Year amen we're looking in it in in in God's world in God's economy in God's word amen because that's that's all that matters last Sunday we learned about the necessity of forgetting our past remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old and though there are things that God always wants us to remember there are four things that we talked about that we need to practice forgiv we need to remember not our former sins nor the sins of our brothers and sisters God doesn't want us talking about The Malt that's in our brother's eye amen neither does God want us to consider our old achievements as as something special we need to share Luke 17:10 Jesus said so likewise ye when you have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unpr profitable servants we have done that which is our duty to do so that's God's attitude that that uh uh how he views our achievements right right and finally if we don't learn to have a short memory with our sufferings we're not going to be able to do very much for the Lord we're not going to be able to uh lay down our lives for the Brethren when Timothy feared being a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel of Christ Paul made it real clear that all of us that live Godly in Christ Jesus are going to suffer persecutions and it'll be the same for you and I so we need to have a a short memory like Paul did of our sufferings Paul told Timothy I suffer trouble as an evildoer and in 2 Timothy chapter 2:10 he says therefore I Endure All Things Not For my sake but for the elect sake that they may also obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal Glory so practice maintaining a short memory about sufferings that you have to go through for the cause of Christ Our adversary has many snares waiting us when our minds are dwelling in the past the first step to move forward in Christ is forgetting the past amen Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do so we want to practice this forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth unto those things which are before us Brethren I count not my S to have apprehended so I don't know where you feel you're at with your in your walk with Christ but I'm not there I don't have the the mindset I'm there well brother John didn't you get baptized didn't you didn't you receive the Holy Spirit didn't I have not attained I don't know your view of me but it better not be more than what it is I just know I'm not there I got a revelation I'm not there I got a revelation I got a ways to go I got a revelation I got a long ways to go and these thoughts help me to press in I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded so this is the perfect mindset to have when you realize you're not there and you got to press in and if and if in anything you be otherwise minded God's going to show you what you need to do I just love that remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old God wants us focusing on our future behold I will do a new thing God said I not the government that's right not the doctors right God is going to do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert I'd like to entitle the message this morning the creator of our future and for a subject aligning ourself up with God's expectation because it's a must if we're going to go anywhere with God a lot of the times our minds end up on a dead Ed Street thinking that things are never going to change in our situation right but God said I would do a new thing so we've got to line ourselves up with God's expectation we may not all know what God has in store for us but we do know that all things are going to work together for the good amen to them that love God and to them that are called to the same purpose that God has amen the purpose of God that's what's important if those two things are transpiring in your life you can anchor that all things are going to work together for the good so we need to align ourselves up with that expectation and all the wonderful things that God has ahead for his bride and we are his bride amen Jeremiah CH 29:1 well-known scripture for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil Jes when I think about this virus and what is done to the world I think it's evil to the core but God's thoughts are thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end when we think about what's going on in the world it just drags us down the world has nothing to offer us but when we think of another kingdom when we when we realize that we need to set our affections on things above amen that we need to be seated our thoughts need to be seated in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus we need to align our thoughts with the thoughts of Peace not of evil we need to align our thoughts with an expected end not a a a dead end rolled that's right amen he promised to do a new thing to make a way where there seems to be no way he is the creator of our future amen Isaiah 58:8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts in other words our thoughts are limited to human reasoning they're affected by what we see going around in the world that's around us and as soon as we depend on our thoughts we limit our future with God that's right where is God's thoughts are not limited by human reasoning by intellect by by Common Sense or by what's going on in the world God's thoughts are merely the are are not thoughts of just hope I hope something happens God's thoughts are not filled with question God's thoughts are yay and amen God's thoughts have an expected in God's word does not return void it will accomplish that which it set out to do Prophet taught us that a word is simply a thought expressed God's thoughts became expressed through his word so that the things which are seen were really made by things which do not appear the Bible tells us so I want when I think when you think about your future changing you must realize that it's going to happen from something that's unseen not from what you see not from what you hear that's right naturally we don't care what's going to happen to the world we don't care when the thing is going to blow up well brother John I want to do this and I I did too but how can you compare that with what God has for you anyways Isa Isaiah 5511 so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void it but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in a thing where to i s I say today that God's word is being ministered yes there are words being spoken out of a human mouth and so it is for the five-fold ministry but if you can believe that God is speaking from his mouth to your heart that word will prosper the place that he sends it and he's sending his word into our hearts today God's thoughts are expressed from his mouth and it creates our future they have never failed one time our Fate's final resting place is not in World Peace it's not in the economy it's not in a a a world vaccine that is right our Faith's final resting place is in the word of God that it will come to pass and that's why we need to come to church with a higher expectation you know we get so excited about what the what the new news is going to be saying people are searching for hope that's why they look to the news the truth brother we need to get in the good news it's all that matters you ever wonder why the prophet never talked about this and this and this and this and this you know what I'm talking about that's right we want to know about it but we don't need to know about it we need to focus on what God wants us to focus on Heaven and Earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away the thoughts that the devil has towards us are evil tormenting thoughts filled with fear true leaving us with anxiety and hopelessness that's right there's no use of pressing in you know too many people are waiting for something to change before they start trying harder to press into Christ amen that is the saddest thing you need a vision if we listen to those thoughts we'll begin to believe them and then act like we believe them but God's thoughts towards us are beautiful they're lovely they're pure they're just they're holy the thoughts that God has towards us are a good report amen there are powerful creative thoughts there merciful thoughts they're gracious thoughts they're patient thoughts amen these thoughts create new life in US New Hope in us a a new nature in us a better life a a better nature am for I know the thoughts I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end the question today is do you know the thoughts that God has toward you today God has plans to car out his thoughts toward you for your future but you need to know the thoughts that God has toward you so you can have the expectation that God wants you to have because without faith it's impossible to please the Lord amen so just ask God to show you your future right that's good amen take some time to get involved with the thoughts that he has towards you the Ed and that he has for you God is in the creation business he loves to create remember the first oh like first six days he created everything right and the last two days he created uh the life in animals and I did not realize how many things God created when you read Genesis you're just kind of like okay so he created animals creeping things things in the water fishes that's a that's done so I got some information about how many things things that we have to identify today which we know all creation came from God there are 5,500 different mammals yeah and of course the many many that have probably gone extinct you know through the years there are over 10,000 different species of birds wow 10,000 oh keep in mind Adam is the one that named them all there are over 10,000 different species of reptiles 15 different 15,000 different an phibians and brother Mike will like this one there's over 40,000 different fish amen 40,000 I I know the Sunfish I know the Blu Gill the the pike there's a tuna a shark a whale you know about after 20 I am speechless there's still another 39,9 75 that I don't know think about our our creator now we want to talk about the invertebrate animals there are over five million different insects and then there's things I've never heard of archin muus crans enums I really need Cheryl or brother Marty or somebody to read this but you add all those up and there's over 6 million 7,000 different species now the plants oh my there's nearly 400 thousand different plants kind of what caught my attention for this is when I was looking on the Weather Channel one of the you know they got different little videos that come up on the Weather Channel there and one of them happened to be a plant that there was only one in existence anywhere in the world only one it was on a island of Hawaii so you've seen that thought wow and how many more were there before but to think that our creator his character his makeup to go ahead and create all these different flowers and all this different type of life he is awesome amen How Great Is Our God his ability to create things amen he's worthy amen he's [Applause] worthy over 7 million species of plants and animals live live on planet Earth according to the best estimates made by biologists 7 million species now that's not a total of seven million of one that's seven million different things if I asked you to come up with uh a a a plan to to do something and I want you to come up with seven you know million different ways you may be able to come up with three or four our God has got creative abilities he said if you add in the world's species that aren't plants or animals such as uh leeons mushrooms and bacteria the total number of species leap much higher telling the estimate of all living things bringing the number to 11.3 million different species I think God has some good things in store for us God is in the creation business and he loves to create we know that when God created everything he created them perfectly he he said that at the end of everything that he created all the different forms and the animals and the lights and everything that he did the Bible says that God saw that it was good so what he does is good am now it's no different about Lucifer when he created Lucifer it was good the Bible says that he was perfect in all his ways he was beautiful until right until Freemore agency went the wrong direction now I want to say this about you because we've all been given the same same thing free more agency the same thing Lucifer had the free more agency is a beautiful power that God has given to all of us but that power without the character to use it only for God is satanic it will lead us to destruction Lucifer took that awesome power of free moral agency and he began to pervert the other things that God had created just because God has given you free more agency that doesn't mean that God's going to okay you no matter what decision you do every time we use our free more Agency for our will we will pervert something but every time we use it to carry out God's will it will create a better life because that's what it's for a good example of that is when uh God has given us the the chance to live for oursel or to live for somebody and he told us if you you seek to save yourself and your life's going to be always consumed about you you're going to lose but if you lay down your life for the Brethren you're going to be blessed Peter asked Jesus why are you washing my feet you're my Lord You're my master and Jesus answered and said in John 13:7 what I do thou knowest not but Thou shalt know Hereafter Jesus was showing them not only how he was going to create a better future a better life a better nature but he was also teaching them that one day they're going to get filled with the Holy Ghost and they're going to be part of this creation process of helping bring life to others because that's what Jesus was really doing when you get cleaned up when you ask God to forgive you of your sins to wash you to cleanse you to S what are you doing God is creating a healthier you he's sanctifying your life and if we backslide then we need to be cleansed and washed every day to bring forth New Life John 13:3 John 13:13 Jesus said you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you now look at this statement verily verely I say to you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is he that greater uh neither is he sent greater than he that sent sent him in other words just because God has blessed you washed you Sanctified you filled you with the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you're too good true that you don't have to go help somebody that's what that means we need to do our job for I've given you an example that you should do as I've done to you verse 17 if you know these things happy are ye if you do them so I say Happy New Year you want a happy New Year right here do this wash somebody's feet well brother John I'm just you know I'm not doing anything like that until this Co is done we're not talking about literally washing somebody's feet now we're talking about having a burden for somebody to see their soul saved that's right that's it somehow getting sin washed out of their life amen Jesus what was he doing here he's wanting to realign his disciples Thoughts with eternal Thoughts with an expected end Jesus wanted his disciples to learn how to serve one another because their own thoughts was they wanted to be served and if we're not careful we know this no matter how much Holy Ghost you got that's right right that old nature wants to keep creeping in and wants to make sure that it's doing everything it can to get served a little bit more John Chapter 13 dropping down to verse 34 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another he was wanting to Reign his disciples Thoughts with thinking the way that God thinks and by this shall all men know that your my disciples if you have love one for another now we know this before we became Christians all we had to do was look at our family and we saw that somebody was not loving everybody that's normal that's called normality where everybody just picks and chooses who they're going to love and when you come to Christ when you really really really really come to Christ all men will know you're a different breed when you don't love like you used to love you love unconditionally everyone all the time Nelson Millard said no I don't know who he is so don't ask but he said you'll never influence the World by being like it well I I love with respect to persons but I'm gonna try to influence this person Greg Grell said if you're willing to do what others won't do you'll have influence that others don't have so you want to be to influence somebody a little bit more learn to lay down your life right because most people aren't willing to do that Jesus was wanting them to take their old way of thinking that they would never be able to influence the world with that's why he said you just wait till you be ued with power from on high then you'll be a proper witness he was wanting to realign their thoughts their way of thinking so they would be able to help create new life in people amen don't miss what I'm saying it was the creator inside those disciples bringing the words of Life Peter said where can we go thou alone has the words of eternal life but Jesus said whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven in other words they were holding the words of life Amen to create a better future God is in the creating business and he likes taking things that are perverted without form and and void of understanding he likes to take these things and bring a beautiful life to create a beautiful life if you just look every one of us you know we we know we're not perfect right now but I'll tell you what we were a lot wor shap before we came to the Lord every one of us could stand and testify by the grace of God I'm not what I used to be amen I'd rather be here with all my problems brother Larry with all my mistakes with all my shortcomings to be than to be back there God loves creating a perfect creation from imperfect people or perverted situations he's okay with that don't be bothered by that it should give us hope we see God recreating things in the way that he wanted to from the beginning and what I mean by that is he he's he wants to recreate things that have been perverted good example of this is in Genesis 1 verse number one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the the Earth in Isaiah chapter 65 Isaiah 65:1 17 for behold I create a new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall be re not be remembered nor come into mind I love that let's get rid of this foral negative thinking that's in our mind God wants to create our minds the way that it should be amen God not only has the ability to take an earth that is without form and void and create things that are good like we learned in Genesis but he also has the power to take a human life that's with a perverted nature and without a form of godliness and void of spiritual life and create Sons and Daughters out of it that's the ability that God has with his creating power amen to be in His image we just need to align our thoughts up with God's higher expectations of us he doesn't want us to wallow around down here in some doomsday mentality with our economy he wants us pressing towards the mark of Christ realigning our thoughts with what God really has in store for us Romans 8: 29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of this his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren now we know this is a promise of God but how many uh have this expectation in their heart through the course of the week or do we just think that this is something that happens after we die now we need to be pressing in to this Mark and I'll say you'll do a lot better job if you stay out of the world news you'll just do a better job how does it all start how do we start this process brother John it doesn't matter if you just came to the Lord or if you've been serving the lord for a long time it all starts with aligning your thoughts back up with the word of God the word is our lamp amen it shows us who we are who God is what he thinks it's all in the word if I listen to somebody who tries to interpr this word you know what most of the time it confuses me well this is what God show me this is what god well that's good for you right and every one of us need confidence that God can speak to us that God can reveal it is God that builds this church amen there's no other man between God and man no other mediator no one sitting there in between now we God give us a five-fold Ministry and God uses those vessels but it still takes God to reveal what's being spoken too often we get caral we look to certain people in the five-fold ministry and we begin to think of who we like more than others and how they deliver the word and how we can accept this from them but not this from them because of and we miss what it really means that's not how God perfects we have to come out of the way that we think the way the world thinks and enter into the mind of Christ Romans 12:2 says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that's the only way you can prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God so you have to come out of the way o of the worldly way of thinking into the mind of Christ just give you an example hum's been in a fight the last week an argument okay now if I get naturally if we get in in an argument with somebody the the person that is always right is you regardless of the of the situation you're right worse comes to worse you're right with your intentions but you're right and so what you're going to do is you're going to defend your right and you're going to prove your right and you're going to come from so many different angles and as a last resort uh anger a red face you're going to prove it but God's way of thinking is a soft answer turns away right a soft answer it's a different way of thinking to create life to create peace to create Harmony we got to come out of one way of thinking into another brother bandam said in the message Divine love he says because you have to come out of the atmosphere you're in into this other atmosphere when you do that God lifts you right up from the world and you live in a Heavenly atmosphere see and then to the world you're just contrary to what that is see and this is contrary to that world see now what you want to do is be lifted up by Christ into an atmosphere to where you're happy doesn't sound you know I I think like this when you say Happy New Year you want to be thinking Lord pick them up in your atmosphere pick them up in your atmosphere because that's truly the only happiness that's going to last he says to be lifted to lift up by Christ into an atmosphere to where you're happy and peaceful and then in there you create a situation we're talking about Christ he is the creator of our future but now we're many creators amen and that we can create situations that don't exist right brother Bram T us that the atmosphere we create will change the things that are around us in the message jerus and Divine Healing brother Bram said now we ought to get ourselves in that kind of atmosphere create every one of you is a Creator did you know that each one of you people that's born again is a Creator we must create an atmosphere as I said the other night now this is really really important to understand he emphasizes the word here and he says born again we're creators so we don't want to we can't like do this in our flesh basically in the message I will restore sayith the Lord Brother Bram says do you realize that your sons that your sons of God the atmosphere and the air that you live in you create a situation around you it'll either draw or push away always remember the new things that God wants you to do are created from the atmosphere of your expectation that's why if you constantly are reading the bad news you know what you're going to do you're G to publish the bad news and if you keep feeding on the good news you're going to publish the good news brother brandham taught us that we need a vision if we're going to create a different better atmosphere in other words a vision is something that is really only seen by you nobody else sees it it's invisible but it's something that you believe in you you see in your heart it don't exist right now you're in a total uh atmosphere of Anger of fighting of Strife of hatred but you have this visualization inside of you of Love of peace and with that Vision you begin to create amen an atmosphere that brings about peace and love now that's is just as real as real can be brother brandom talking about an experience that he had in the message expectations where his wife was all tore out because brother brandom wasn't home enough take care of the needs you all know the story and brother Braham said in this message he said he says now don't fuss with her see no he said he said say that's right honey see it's very bad but you see we're serving the lord brother brandom couldn't couldn't go against what God's will was for his life but he was trying to change the atmosphere see what I'm doing all the time in my heart I'm trying to create a different atmosphere they're all nervous and tore up see so brother Brandon wasn't trying to shove the truth he was creating the atmosphere here in his heart because if it's here it will come out here it will change out here if it's here well he was a prophet didn't he have that wasn't he having a that's like you saying I can quote the word that's good that you can quote the word but can you live the word can the word be lived can it be manifested in the flesh he says now I was thinking in my heart oh Lord now send your presence and your love to my poor little tore up wife and I say Yes dear that's right in his heart he was praying he was believing in God manifesting right there in his presence God is real he's the same yesterday today and forever he has power to work through your life and create a better future you know being positive in a negative situation isn't naive it's called leadership right somebody has to be the bigger person brother Ram says it takes a big man to get underneath another man brother bam said in the message do you now believe he says see that's the way it is you just kept believing you just keep believing create the atmosphere never let doubt come around you believe all the time don't accompany any of that doubt at all no sir no matter what the circumstance s it says push away do walk right on through it just refuse it yes sir don't give no grounds at all to it in the message a hidden life in Christ brother bam refers to Satan was stirring up a bad atmosphere in one of his meetings he says remember the the night the Maniac Run to the platform to kill me up there up here at Portland Oregon he says you read the story no doubt my it's everywhere what happened well that poor fellow he said I didn't get angry with him I loved him now I'm telling you he didn't say I had to try to show love inside brother Rah said inside I'm working on the atmosphere inside he said I loved him if you love in here it'll come out here but if it's just a a picture a painting you can't get warmed by a pictured fire they say it's okay to say it's missing you got a chance to say Lord fill me with you fill me with your love fill me with your life fill me with your Holy Spirit now you have a chance but without it and man is very best is all vanity right he says in the same message here just continuing to read he says and I think that's what's the matter with the church tonight when people say yes I'm born again you know what it is he said it's a stillborn dead baby it needs a little gospel spanking once in a while to wake it up and get it to whining and crying and get some life into it that's what we need tonight that's what the church needs and then getting set on the right path that's right so I love that the prophet said that because if I said that there wouldn't be as many amens I'm just going to be honest with you there wouldn't be but the prophet said it and God is is always wanting to stir us up to get us closer to him he says notice now the refreshing from the presence of the Lord something about them something about a real Christian that you love to be around don't you and there's a power there you create your own atmosphere around you do you believe that you sure do amen now you know you could go out in the world and you could sit in a place uh an auditorium where there would be somebody on the platform and they would would be uh telling the funniest jokes and making you laugh and making you feel good they could be telling you that you're something special and that you need to believe in yourself and then you need to realize that you can you can really make a difference if you just believe it and you could walk out of there feeling better feeling like you have a a a some sort of power that you didn't have before you went in there it's the same power that you had a month ago that you thought you had that you lost that you and then you keep going you you keep listening to that you keep referring back look we need the god inside of us the real power is the Holy Ghost you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you that's God's word then that's God's word today nothing else will give us lasting power brother brand said in the message love he shares that love is the greatest Force to change any atmosphere Divine love is one of the most powerful forces it's one of the greatest forces in the world brother brand says and when Divine love has been projected and come to its end then Sovereign Grace will take its place now a lot of times we use our love and when it gets to the end we say I'm done I'm done with this I I'm it's God's going to have to come now because I well that's what we needed at the beginning was God's love and when we project God's love all of the love that he has us to project not just what we think we all we have to do is this but when we project all the love that God wants us to project when that comes to an end then God's grace takes over now when Divine love has pro has been projected and come to it to its end till it can't go no further then Sovereign Grace will come in and take its place can't go any further now do you realize being a son or daughter of God he says that you are minor you are a minor Creator do you know you create an atmosphere that you live in so if you're unhappy think about the atmosphere you're creating yes yes you create the atmosphere you don't you blame it on me right don't you blame it on your spouse don't you blame it on your boss don't you blame it on your bank account don't you blame it on anything amen amen did you know you create the atmosphere that you live in do you realize that the atmosphere that you dwell in you influence somebody else so if you're sad all the time you're probably going to make others sad if you're Gloom and doom you're going to make others gloom and doom if you're happy you're going to make others happy amen now God loves us he loves us and he has a vision for us he has a a an expectation for us when we were in sin before the foundation of the world he had a vision for us and that Vision was Calvary he he manifested that love through Calvary and that brought about a life for us God loves us today right every one of us in this building he loves us the way we are but he does not love our carnal fleshly nature he's against it Romans 8 vers seven because the carnal mind is enity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God so we must understand that there's a part of us that God doesn't like hard to come to grips with it I'm thankful for the part that he does like but that part that he does like is needs to get surrounded by the Holy Ghost it needs to be protected and sealed by the Holy Ghost because if not our carnal fleshly nature will try to take over that's why Jesus said hey the remedy to this is Die daily so God loves us the way we are he just simply refuses to spend heaven with a selfish nature if God wasn't willing to spend eternity with Lucifer's selfish nature why would he be willing to spend eternity with our selfish nature I'm just trying to get us a good understanding that God loves us but he doesn't love our selfish nature no matter how good a man thinks he is he isn't good enough for God right Jesus said there is none good but one that is God Jesus told the religious teacher Nicodemus one time at John 3:3 verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he can't enter the kingdom of God without a nature change amen all things in our nature are being if I could say it like this recreated into God's nature another way of saying it is regenerated back to what God had at the beginning 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 17 well-known scripture therefore If any man being in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ so God took upon the responsibility to make new creatures out of us and he notice here he's not just talking talking about salvation at Calvary he's talking about taking our nature that selfish that didn't want anything to do with God that finally when we said yes Lord I want to be saved he has something more in in in uh in mind for us that he wants our whole life to become like all of God's life am so that's where his expectation is and that's where we need to realign our expectation we need to be this needs to be our goal that all things need to become God in our life now we are all stuck somewhere in this scripture if I was to ask every one of you I want you to write a list of the things that is not God in your life you might say to me brother John that's offensive you might say that's not why I come to church you might say that's none of your business it it's truly none of my business but you need to be interested in your business with God because this scripture is for you somewhere all things need to become God don't be satisfied where you're at with God that's the worst thing be thankful be grateful so much that you're in debt to press on to changing the other things in your life God took his creative power went to Calvary for you came back left the Holy Ghost for you and it's just here for us I I love that because you can't have too much Holy Ghost what's needed is a greater hunger a greater desire not well I'll get it when I get home I'll spend some time later this week and missing what God is really speaking to you right now when God could be trying to alter get you to alter your thinking right now to more of his thinking maybe this is the minute of visitation why would we gamble amen that's right amen I want us to be encouraged today my uh daughter made mention of something I said years ago that um of course I hardly can't remember remember what I said last week but every time you come to church you have an opportunity to receive more of God as long as you get out of your mind it's got to come this way it's got to be this it's got to be that this is what I've been praying about this is get all that out of your mind yes and be neutral that's what brother B say get neutral and let God speak to you amen line upon line word upon word here a little there a little amen when you simply turn your heart towards the Lord and give him Liberty the Bible says we are changed from uh changed into the same image of God from Glory onto Glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so that's what we're looking for when we when we come to church amen so hold your confidence steadfast in the Lord be confident this this very thing that what God is started in you he's going to finish it he's going to perform it onto the day of Jesus Christ can you bear with me a little bit since we don't got two Services God wants to change our nature and he starts with our hearts so we see that he created an earth then he's going to create a new Earth he created heaven but he's going to create a new new heaven he created our heart and our spirit and he's going to create a new heart and a new spirit amen Ezekiel 36 Ezekiel 36: 26 a new heart also will I give you a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you I love that don't look don't look for yourself to have to do it just seek the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will cause you to walk in God's statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them the emphasis needs to be seeking the Holy Ghost amen that way we don't have to figure anything out we don't have to try to do this that or the other or how am I going to get rid of this I'm I going to stop doing that it just doesn't matter let God's God's job he's the great physician he's the deliverer there's nothing in the Bible says John John you're a great deliverer you delivered yourself right right you know we don't need to do anything except seek God because he's all we need if we just do our part amen you know here's the thing you could put forth tons of effort eort to to to overcome something and good for you good for you but God is not interested in sharing his glory with you right right amen you could give your body to be burned what what it profit God is interested in you saying lord I can't do anything without you fill me with the Holy Ghost that's what God's looking for that mindset that heart of hunger and thirst after the Holy Ghost Ezekiel 11: 19 and I will give them I love this one heart in other words the heart that God puts in you is his heart to where you begin to love the things of God and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of Flesh sometimes we can hinder the progress of God after the work that he's begun in us we we can become a little cold indifferent hard hold grudges or be judgmental but we've got to align ourselves up with the thoughts that God has for us and the expectations that God has for us like David when he prayed in Psalms 51:10 create in me a clean heart and renew a right Spirit within me see he had been serving the lord he was a child of God he's chosen of God but he he needed to realign his thoughts in his heart with God's expectations amen every time we sing the the song from my heart change my heart oh God you know what you're doing you're realigning your thoughts with the thoughts of God that's what you're doing right there you're getting ready for God to create a future for you now each and every time we come to a church we have a chance to be changed for God to change us it's a time where God places a vision before us and a lot of times it's something that we're not even looking for he says something who where that I wasn't praying about that I wasn't thinking about that but what God's doing with you he's placing a vision before you you have a chance to pick that up and say amen that's for me or you have a chance to say nope nope nope NOP no I'm a picky eater nope nope NOP NOP NOP I I come to church for this this is what I I'm okay if you want to do that once in a while hey you got something don't don't let that be your habit that's not what church is for church is go it's what you come to church to find out where you're at with God in other words you don't know where you're at with God and you you you you're trusting that God would reveal that to you through the preaching of the word that's what church is for we don't want to disect remember when we were in school we had a disect of the frogs and stuff like Psalms 23:3 he restoreth my soul so there is a a process of recreation we don't believe in Two Souls but we do believe in God restor ing our soul he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake so that's what happens when we come to church he is leading Us in Paths of righteousness he's showing us clearly the path the attitude the thoughts the things that we need to be doing Isaiah chapter 42:9 behold the former things are come to pass and new things I do declare before they spring forth I tell you of them to me it shows the thought process we should have when we come to church that God wants to show us something God wants to tell us something why because he wants your expectation to be right where his is at this isn't a God is not meant to be a mystery for his bride brother Brandon preached that Christ is the mystery of God revealed to his bride amen we're just not church goers we don't come to church just to go to church to learn about God we come to develop our relationship closer to God the creator of our future is continually working on our future are we recognizing the new things that he's trying to speak to us even though all the hardships that we've gone through in 2020 God is still creating strength and power in our lives I want you to think about that we've just had a terrible year and it seems to be you know not stopping at December 31st but God is still creating he's creating strength and power in every one of us if we do what we need to do Isaiah 40: 28 has thou not known has thou not heard the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth Feth not neither is he weary in other words it just he's got so much power he doesn't get tired there's no searching of his understanding and he you know what he gives that power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint be wearing the young man shall only fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint so God is Not lacking creating power and strength in your life that you don't have today am we just have to do our job that when we get on our knees and wait on them what we're doing is we're realigning our thoughts with God and have the expectation of an expected end 1 Peter chapter 4: 19 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as what as unto a faithful Creator in other words God is still creating did you ever wonder if God is still creating animals or plants or stuff out there he's God he can do what he wants to do I know that he's he's constantly creating new mercies for me New Opportunities new new Faith New Hope Paul said I live by the faith of the son of God God is a living God and we we we need to have a relationship with them in such a way that it's continuously living con live uh it's like you get in the car and if everybody's quiet there's no sound and you turn the radio on and music comes on there's a difference our walk needs to be not off with the voice of God but on amen amen and and and we we we have to we have to do our part with that have to wait on the Lord have to seek him keep feeding on the message of the hour amen keep feeding on the message of the hour that's why God sent it he he did not send a message for those ministers who walked before us 20 40 years ago that message is for us today and for those that you need to share it with when's the last time you shared the message with somebody that's never heard remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing a new thing how many wants God to do a new thing Hosea chapter 6 verse one we're winding down Come and Let Us return unto the Lord for he have torn and he will heal us he have smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now that's an expectation right there that we need to have then shall we know if here's our part listen if we follow on to know the Lord there's the job we have to do come to church with an expectation to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come as the rain and the latter and the former Reign onto the Earth you know Satan has got some people so Twisted in their head that they don't think they need to come to church Faithfully and they're still going to be okay now if that's true if that's true why would I if I don't come to church Faithfully why would I get the same reward as you who comes to church Faithfully why would I get the same Revelation why would I get the same preparation for a Rapture why should I hear the same words well done though good faithful it's not right but see Satan is always trying to tell us you're good enough you're good enough you're doing good enough you don't need and all that is is a lukewarm Spirit trying to get on you you just shake it off say get behind me Satan I'm pressing towards that Mark pressing towards there's a prize that Waits amen without a vision we're going to perish align yourself up with God's expectation visualize yourself as a servant of Christ and help others to the Cross visualize yourself with the armor of God on overcoming everything visualize yourself as a manifested Son of God you been predestinated to it the Bible says that that uh we're going to manif be a manifested Son of God it's promised for us today the whole world the whole earth is groaning waiting there might be 11.3 species out there that God has created but I'm telling you there's one species that the whole world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of and that's you and I amen amen I don't think there's going to be any more transformation from Monkey to human right but we've been promised to become in the image of Jesus Christ so we need to visualize ourself and start pressing towards that start pressing towards that visualization if you come to to church and you leave church with just well I I I heard something I mean you know what I really never realized there that many species before if that's all we're going to get we miles are just hey look I'll send all encyclopedias to your house but we're coming here for life let's stand together this is the last scripture Revelations 21 verse number four Revelations CH 21 verse number four may you be encouraged by this scripture and God shall wipe away all tears from your eyes and there shall be no more

deserves more praise just a little bit that's right just a little bit more and I just believe that's a sacrifice that he's pleased with amen amen may the Lord be with you bless your day today keep you safe and um we're looking forward to service this Wednesday um and our our men's meeting uh we appreciate uh all of our men at our church and um uh we're going to try to uh maybe spend a few services on Wednesday talking about church order and uh if it be the will of the Lord uh in that manner I know it's the will of the Lord for us to talk about church order um and then maybe on Sundays uh have our regular services but um and I'll probably get into a little bit more but I've been guilty of not um teaching and uh not only establishing but reaffirming and bringing to remembrance um Church order for our church and I am the one responsible for that and I I I just need to do a better job it's obviously one of those subjects that like tithes and offerings justum not talk about it just uh but it's just part of part of uh part of God Church order is really part of God he has an order to things we're and so God willing we're going to begin to get into that this Wednesday I I do covet not only your prayers but I I need every one of us to be here for the church order Services it's the if you can make it do everything you can to make it because I need you to not only keep better order because this is really this is for every one of us every one of us in some some fashion form or way is out of order and I'm I'm the first I'm the first by not teaching the order I'm a order um but not only that but so that you can help disciple others you know so please please come amen and uh God God bless you let's be dismissed now and the word of prayers continue to pray for everybody on the
