many on everybody's hearts amen amen if you know if anybody's lacking anything to pray pray for me you know amen that we can just all enter into his worship amen and that we can all grow higher in christ amen that's my desire amen well let's just remember all those that aren't here this morning amen for sister kathleen brother marty amen for sister don brother bruce amen for uh sister joyce sister kelly amen for anybody else that's for our additional family men as i believe they're so quarantined and still grieving amen so um you know grieving never really leaves you you know we can all we've all lost loved ones and but you know time has a way of of kind of smoothing the rough edges you might call it you know but uh you just lift them up this morning that dad would uh be all their portions amen as as us amen for all our loved ones that aren't here amen for all the for all the loved ones that are on the other side amen you know never really thought of it this way but there must be an anticipation on their part of our coming and what a great thing that is to know that uh you know somebody's looking out for you and just praying for you amen so we just pray that through this holidays that we can just draw close closer to christ that we can express to others was bottled up inside of us that you know they don't know christ and especially in the era we're living with this confusion and everything you know there's definitely needs you know i i see a lot more it seems like this year we me and my wife are just talking seems like we got a lot more you see a lot more christmas lights up and you know people want to express you know so let us express christ to them this morning amen just remember just tides and offerings and all the missions throughout the world amen brother john and the uh the other church amen as it moves forward and brother stan and just working at it and all that and our anybody else that's that's sick here you know like keep lifting up our sister cheryl and anybody else that has a affliction amen um so if there's any other needs let's just remain seated amen i i know probably i know it's good to see our brother ron and i think he had some things that he wanted to express to the church is that right brother did you want to do that now okay you want to come up here okay greetings brothers and sisters i just wanted to take a few minutes because i've been a little sporadic as far as my attendance and the things that i like to do i haven't been able to do and i just want you to know that whether i'm here or whether i'm gone you're still in my hearts you're in my prayers i pray for each one of you daily it's hard for me to express myself because i'm a pretty quiet person but i want you to know that i love every one of us and i know that you love me and it helps me to know when i can't be here that you're still praying for me i just wanted to just want to take a few minutes here and like i say i'm not very good at this i just don't do this very much but i have a little something i want to share with you that that has helped me out many times and we're in a time that prayer is so important and if we don't pray we're not going to get anything done and so if i can get through this forgive me it says prayer is not only a calling upon god but also a conflict with satan delayed answers to prayer are not only trials of faith but they give us opportunities of honoring god do not pray for the easy lives pray to be stronger men do not pray for tasks equal to your powers pray for powers equal to your tasks groanings which cannot be uttered are often prayers which cannot be refused we pray for patience and god sends us those who tax us to the utmost we pray for submission and god sends us suffering we pray for quietness and every nerve is strong to the utmost tension we pray for love and god sends peculiar sufferings and puts us apparently with unloving people the way to peace in victory is to accept every circumstance every trial straight from the hand of a loving god i just want to thank god for his presence in my life for what he's done for me and through quietness whether i'm here or whether i'm gone i want you to know that i love every one of you thank you so much hey man i just uh you know it's scripturally speaking it says that man ought to always be praying without seasoning if you have a you know a quiet time in your mind pray you know because it keeps your mind stated in the lord so as our brother said you know we don't understand our trials but you know he comes to us and he says that count them more blessed than you know gold and silver i think um you know he says you know we look in the scripture that says every man's right in his own eyes right but we need the minds of christ we need the eyes of christ right not to look at our trials as being something that we can't carry because he told us we could we just need to have more faith like our brothers said to be able to see beyond everything else especially in the day we're living amen so let's just stand we'll go brother mike can you just take these needs before the church already through our the lives getting closer with all the deceptions yes yes bless the little ones lord of allah the future belongs to you lord no matter what it is amen we may be seated amen let's just sing fill my way with love amen hallelujah hallelujah let me walk blessed lord in the way thou has gone leading straight to the land [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] fill my way every day with love as i walk with the heavenly dog let me go all the while [Applause] [Music] keep me close to the side of my savior god let me never in darkness keep my path free from wrath and my soul satisfied fill my way every day with love fill my way every day with love as i walk with the heavenly doll let me go all the [Applause] [Music] no more [Music] fill my way every day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me go all the while with a song and a smile fill my way every day with love hallelujah amen is that your desire amen hallelujah he fills our day with love amen hallelujah and he expects us amen as his children to fill others others day with love amen amen let us just stand as we get ready to change order of the services a brother comes and sings sanctuary amen how many wants to be sanctuary for the word this morning amen lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true thanksgiving i'll be your living [Music] sanctuary for you just for you lord lord prepare me to be a sanctuary tried and true with thanksgiving i'll be a living sanctuary for you amen let's just sing it one more acapella amen lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with thanksgiving i'll be a living sanctuary for you amen let's look to the lord in prayer heavenly father we thank you lord that you've called vessels out of this world that you could make sanctuaries that you could dwell in them and represent yourself in a law to a lost and dying world lord in this dark dark hour lord it's so good to know that you're alive inside your people lord we thank you for calling us to this calling to walk with you lord may we be worthy lord to be used of you lord to walk the walk that you have called us to walk lord if we're getting out of step lord just get our attention lord use this message the message that you sent in this hour through the prophet to get us back in line lord we want to be in sync with you we want to be in harmony with you we want to walk lord to the to the beat of this precious word that you've revealed to us in this age lord father as we enter into this part of the service we thank you lord that we could come this morning and worship you in spirit and truth lord that you've given us lord as it was spoken in prayer the liberty in this hour lord to meet together lord as a body of believers and worship you and father we just ask that you take the remainder of the service today minister to our hearts lord may there cause us to arise in faith and lord to believe for the needs that we have in our life and in the body one with another lord we thank you for everything that's been said and done lord we pray and trust that you continue to minister to each and every one lord now as we commit this service in your hand ask his blessings in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you let's turn in our bibles to the book of luke chapter 18 for opening scripture and then we'll have you be seated it is simply amazing how god is in control and we are totally clueless of what he's doing and god does not need to tell us what he is doing but it is vitally important that we catch the message of what he speaks to us directly because that's the part that we have to play amen luke chapter 18 starting with verse number one and he spake a parable unto this end that men ought always to pray and not faint saying there wasn't a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me my adversary and we would and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubles me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them i say unto you that i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen god bless you may be seated last service we're learning um how to live a crucified life and learning to live a crucified life is just learning how to surrender your life learning how to completely live a surrendered life to the lord i believe it was john said i must decrease so he can increase i believe paul said when i'm weak then i'm strong and jesus said my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness and so we can see that it's through us becoming very very nothing that he can become very very everything amen we don't want to view perfect weaknesses a feeling of being all beat up and discouraged we want to view perfect weakness as completely dependent upon god completely surrendered to god that we may gain all that god has the more that we learn to live a crucified life or a surrender life the more that god can have his way in our life and that surrendered life will never ever be gifted to us and this is important it'll never be gifted to us just because we're bride we will have to fight to lay down our lives and learn the habit of surrendering it daily to god this morning we want to talk a bit about prayer and choosing to thrive in god's economy through prayer i like to entitle this message a symphony of prayer brother ron husker made mention this morning if you don't pray if we don't pray we're not going to get anything done and uh i believe he was in sync with the holy ghost and perhaps didn't even know it and maybe he did know it d.l moody said every great move of god can be traced back to a kneeling figure prayer is extremely important here in our opening scripture jesus brings up the power of prayer in the end time whether there would be faith enough to execute god's will or not in some way it seems like the whole world is crying out for help most of the crying is without faith and we have to have faith mixed with our prayers or it's not going to it's not going to benefit us and i'm going to say it like this we're going to spiritually faint faint from being in the position of a christian that's thriving in god's economy we're all feeling stuck in some way some are stuck in in a quarantine many are not here with us today some are stuck in fear some are stuck inside of a community that's locked down can't go to the bank unless you have an appointment now waiting periods are much longer for all of our appointments try to make appointment it's it's sometimes months out things are becoming more virtual stay put stay at home if we're not allowed to go to the restaurants then we're feeling too cautious and afraid to go anyways we can't be with our friends and family like the way we want to you just can't get in your car and go somewhere without being inhibited some way in our minds it's a feeling stuck and this feeling stuck is it's problematic it causes people to go insane people are fighting depression and a whole host of problems just because of the feeling of stuck this stuckness feeling has affected the church body as well they're fighting the same spirits of depression and hopelessness it's a reality we can't be with one another the way that we like to and feel totally comfortable we just can't go up to one another and shake one another's hand and hug one another without some thought going through our head we may feel okay with it but then we're wondering how the other person is going to be feeling about it we feel less liberty to just go up to people and talk to people about jesus because we're wondering about social distancing reaching out for souls has been quite hindered helping one another in the body has been dampered and believers are becoming more inclusive it's really opened the door wide for being stuck in laodicea and if you're stuck with yourself it's a lot easier to fall more in love with yourself but we don't have to choose to accept this feeling of hopelessness and stuckness because god hasn't changed his plans haven't changed his purpose hasn't changed his power hasn't changed for our god is still the same yesterday today and forever we can choose to live in god's economy we're not stuck in this world jesus said we're in this world but we're not of this world we're from another kingdom we're we're born in a different community he prayed in saint john chapter 17 verse 15 i pray not that thou should have take them out of the world that thou thou should has keep them from the evil so it's okay for us to be here in this situation god's prayer is to be kept from it amen hallelujah from the evil that's in the world that's where god is is his mind and his prayer for us was that we would be cut from it and i'll say we need to agree with that amen we need to have the mindset of that now we can choose to live in god's economy god's a community safe from evil safe from being stuck in the mindset of i i can't do anything anyway so why should i try come on it's a real situation we can not only choose to live in god's economy but we can choose to thrive in god's economy right in the middle of what's this pandemic it is full of life there's nothing shut down in god's economy there's nothing hindered everything is open there's still joy in the camp amen there's still peace in the valley there's still an eternal love amen god is still answering prayer he may not change the world's ideas but he's still answering prayer god's economy is open for business friends and it's thriving prayer is our communication with god it's truly our fellowship with the lord and the more you communicate with god the closer we get to god your communication with god through prayer is what helps move the economy of god god is we like to think that god is is is going to do something no matter what so there's no no need to pray and that is just a lie from the devil as you communicate to god through prayer the words of your heart being expressed to god through prayer something begins to transpire inside of you and god uses that faith amen to to perform what it is that the need is now sometimes it's in your life and sometimes it's in the life of others god communicates to you to the word you communicate to god to prayer and god communicates to you through his word now that word that he communicates to you may be while you're praying and it may be while the word is being preached to you brother branham said we come to church to find out where we're standing where we're at with god he didn't say that's why we we pray to find out where we're at with god this is important because so often when we pray our own thoughts can be mixed our own ideas and if we don't get into the spirit then things can get mixed up so we don't get a clear precise decision but that word is a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart and that word can speak directly to us amen so god does speak in prayer but he also communicates to us through his word prayer is what really prepares us we may get in prayer to let our requests be made known to god because we have certain needs and that god wants us to pray about them and he wants us to to believe that god will meet them but remember oftentimes god ordains needs in our life for one purpose to get us to pray because we're not praying think about that god is more interested in you praying than your knees being met that's right he's more interested in you communicating with him than you getting your need met he wants the fellowship just because we come to church and we sit down it does not necessarily mean we're fellowshipping with god it just means we're in church you've got to enter into the spirit you've got to introduce to communion with him amen sometimes our prayers can become selfish and it behooves us to step back and and take a look at our prayer life and ask yourself the question if god were to answer all of our prayers would it change the world or just ours would it help us naturally or spiritually would it conform to what we want or would it transform us into the character that god wants oftentimes god uses our needs to get us to pray and then god uses our prayers to prepare us for his word his word is this communication it's a it's a still small voice it may be through prayer but it also may be through the preaching of the word that's why we must be anticipating god speaking to us directly when we come to church why didn't god just speak his voice to everyone why does god choose the foolishness of preaching of his word to other sinners you know a preacher is just a sinner saved by grace but he's still a sinner he still falls every time there's not a there's not a man that does not fall if i could say it like this on a regular basis to the point to where we can look at any man and see fall on the planet the difference is are we going to look at that man through the blood of christ because that is exactly how god looks at us today he's not looking at us and saying well your faults and failures are just a little bit lower than everybody else's so you're in no it's the blood that makes the difference praise god for the blood he chose the foolishness of preaching to save men why didn't he just go to a bunch of sinners and speak to them without somebody going to them think about this because it's the network of god that he's chosen to use the body to save the body and he uses prayer to help the body amen prayer is vital amen god used his prayer to prepare us to get us in sync with him and to get us in harmony with him without prayer we won't go very far with god without continuous communication of prayer we will actually halt our relationship with god we'll limit it it's no different with our our natural relationships i got some facts off the internet last night it is little surprise that the lack of communication in marriage leads to divorce or separation in many incidences in a study conducted last year communication problems were the most common factor that led to divorce at 65 communication this was followed by couples inability to resolve issues at 43 percent the majority of arguments happen because of communication breakdown now i want you i hope your your spiritual minds are on because this is exactly what happens between a believer and god when he gets out of prayer now notice a couple naturally they have desires but the way that they think about getting those needs met or or seen or worked with is so selfish that there's no time to really enter in a right spirit to deal with them so what happens if we don't get what we want when we say it then there's a problem that's how believers get i don't got time to wait on the lord this is what i want if that's it i'm just i'm going to do my own thing anyways the causes of communication breakdown in a marriage involve blaming nagging complaining was a complaint of seventy percent followed by the lack of sufficient appreciation from their spouse at 65 percent this is the reason i think we should worship god more we need to appreciate him more we you cannot show god how much he's worthy of your praise sometimes we just we murmur and complain about how hard life is i'm telling you this uh this this breakdown is going to help hurt our relationship with the lord this communication breakdown the lack of validation for feelings and opinions were number one at 83 percent followed by 56 who said their spouses talk about themselves too much how does god feel when we come when we come to him and it's all about us what is our spouse thinking what about his will what about his desires what about what he would like to see happen our wires can often get crossed with god assuming certain things or certain desires outside of god's will and and and really not even recognize but just because we feel it we want it you know it's got to be god communicating with god through prayer is what helps us connect those lawyers it's what gets us back in harmony of god now of course you know the devil is telling us that everything's okay between us and god brother john how do you know that because it's the same exact thing he's telling all the denominations you're fine you're good what you believe where you're going to church where you stand you don't have to do anything more that is what he's telling laodicea and they're stuck having need of nothing because they're listening to that so of course he'd be saying that same thing to the denominator to the message believers our lack of communication with god through prayer will eventually cause us to get disconnected from god and and we may not even realize it we've heard the old story you go one day without prayer and your wife knows about it you go two days and your kids know about it you go three days without prayer and your dog knows about it because you get mad at the dog and you want to kick the dog prayer gets us away from being christ-like john chapter 15 verse 4 jesus said abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine and no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing we need to pray to stay connected with god if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned we must stay connected with god amen we've got to stay in continuous prayer with the lord it's not only our spiritual lifeline but it's our spiritual lifeline to the entire body it's not just about us we're a part of the body and the body is a part of us and there's no big eyes or little hues and we can't make it without one another 99.9 of the body could be ready for the rapture but if that one little part is not ready the rapture is not happening god is not god is not leaving anybody behind so we need one another god not only uses our prayers to prepare us for his word but he uses them to help the rest of the body he'll lay burdens on your heart one for another a god that truly lives for other he also puts burdens on our hearts for one another because that's the type of god he is so when our prayers are all about ourselves and all about god is looking for us to enter into his network of prayer for one another it's a network of prayer one for another at home i was just praying lord what can we do in this situation i mean so many things are changing the hindrances and how it's affecting the church and many families are not here today but it's not just here it's many churches are in this same situation and people wanting to believers our our loving brothers and sisters in christ are feeling they want to feel the wise and safe thing to do is is to stay safe and i one thousand percent uh support that but it puts us in a position of what do we do but let this be the time that we enter into prayer as we've never prayed before because god works through prayer [Music] and we can thrive in god's economy god operates all sorts of three all sorts of things through the to the network of prayer he meets needs through prayer he will never we will never be able to thrive as a christian without prayer we can be so on fire for god even though we're not in church because here's the thing to whom much is given much is required and if everything is fine and these doors are open god expects us to be here but in this situation where there's certain convictions certain immune systems that don't feel safe god sees that god understands that but that does not should not separate us from thriving in god's economy through prayer i'll tell you it should open the door for us to enter into prayer more now god can do anything without us he's god but he has made some choices one of those choices that god has made is that he uses our prayers to carry out his will amen for his body in other words we don't pray his will is not going to be done things are going to suffer if you've got a need in your physical body and you don't tend to that need that is going to turn into something worse so you try to take care of that need it's the same thing when there's a need in the body if you don't pray that need is not going to get met we're so used to god just doing everything without you we're missing out on thriving in god's economy god needs us to pray for one another to pray for his body that it'll be healed amen we've got many many needs that that will function normally that it wouldn't be inhibited by fear that we would be free to move around in the spirit amen god wants to see the whole body in harmony in unity healthy thriving in god's economy amen ephesians chapter 4 verse 16. paul speaking to ephesians church from whom the whole body the whole body is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplier there is a function with every joint in your physical body if it does not give the lubricant that it needs there you're going to wake up stiffer than a board according to the effectual working in every measure of most of the parts no every part we have a part to play making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now i i couldn't help but to watch uh this doctor as he kept taking this hand and putting it on his other shoulder because the pain that he was suffering from in his back was affecting and that's how it is when there there is a need in your body another part of your body wants to help that need because you're feeling the effect of that body and just because you are maybe going through something god's still feeling the effect of somebody in the body and when you're in connection with god god will lay on your heart how to pray for that person and with so many needs we shouldn't be lacking for anything to pray about amen i got the same verse from another version the asv version i just want to read it to you from whom all the body fitly framed and knitted together all that word knitted you know anybody that knits you know you're sewing in and out around and you're connecting everything we're connected through that which every joint supplieth according to the working in due measure of several parts making the increase of the body unto the building of itself in love in other words the purpose that you're praying for somebody is that you're in love with the body if you don't care about your body you're not going to take care of yourself but when you love your body you want to take care of it the eye doesn't say to the hand or to the ear or to the nose was talking to my daughter she wanted to my daughter elizabeth wanted to thank everybody for their prayers for her the church up there as you are aware requests have have come forth that they had battled some covid and she told me last night on the phone that she still hasn't regained her smell now can you imagine her being having the attitude well i can't smell i'm okay with that as long as i can walk no we want our smell we want our taste we want to see we want everybody here we want the whole body and we need love for the body love for one another to pray one for another we need to get involved in love with one another so we can pray the way that god wants us to pray and thrive in his economy turn with me if you would to the book of ephesians chapter four god is one and he has one body and he doesn't want there to be any isms or schisms or you know just because i'm not this it doesn't matter it's our it's our job it is our job to make sure there's no isms no problems it isn't somebody else's it's our job ephesians chapter 4 verse 1. i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the calling wherewith you've been called with all lowliness and meekness and long suffering for bearing one another in love now this is what is required for the body notice it's a total different mindset than just a haughtiness arrogancy judgment no patience that is not needed what we need for the body is to be long suffering to be patient to be kind and loving because there's a need did you ever get a cut in your body or something in your body i i'm dealing with some tennis elbow right now been dealing with it for about a little over uh probably a month and i'll tell you yeah i want that thing taken care of if anybody's ever had that the pain that's associated that when you're using your your arms and trying to function right and you you want that need just taken care of right away but it don't happen that way because of the inflammation it takes time so you're going to be long suffering got to be pain you got to perform bear sometimes it needs i put a brace on the body is no different we need to be praying one for another they that are strong and bear the affirmatives of the weak giving diligence to keep the unity of the spirit in the bone of peace now he says there is one body one spirit even as you're called into one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who's overall through all and in all god is teaching us about him being one and he doesn't have two bodies we're all part of god so when your flesh wants to separate yourself because of something you're going against god's will for your life well it's between me and god your walk is between you and god but you need to be interested in the body if not something is wrong something is wrong prayer is what brings oneness with god and we have to have oneness with god before we can ever have oneness with the body i'll just say it like this if we are not one with the body i question that we're one with god i question it i'll never forget brother rowal telling me in my living room he said we must be have our communion and our fellowship vertical first before we can have it horizontal we've got to be one with god in order to be one with the body now you've got all the the churches and the the denominations of the world and they don't understand what it means to live a surrendered life and they they still pray for one another and they still have that contact with one another but they don't understand oneness god has blessed us with a message to teach us how to be one remember jesus prayed to the father in john chapter 17 verse 20. neither pray i for these alone but for them that will be sitting in cinderlight church sunday december 13th he prayed for us what was on his heart at that time that he prayed that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us and that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou has given me i give them that they may be one excuse me even as we are one so it's about a oneness that god's looking for here i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou sent me and i have loved them and as thou has loved me wow i don't think there's any room for isms and schisms in the body there's no room for a little you and big me we're all one i'm not going to put myself up above you but don't you dare try to put yourself up above anybody don't don't you dare put somebody underneath you there is no room we're all one in christ prayer is what brings oneness in unity and jesus himself used the weapon of prayer for oneness and if he could do it we need to do it pray the same prayer for oneness amongst us hallelujah colossians chapter 1 verse 17 paul is speaking to the church he said and he is before all things and in him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn of the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence god wants the preeminence if god wants oneness we need to yield ourself to god all one all one i can take a big chunk of ice one chunk of ice pure water and i hit that thing with a hammer and it falls into many pieces in one sense it's separated but in another sense it's part of what it was a one chunk to begin with that chunk may go into your cup of water that chunk may go into your cup of pop but it's all the same chunk we're all one in christ those who leave everything in god's hands will eventually see god's hands in everything we need to let god be preeminent we don't want to take charge i think if there's anything you want to take charge of it's that flesh that you deal with take charge of that thing but don't take charge of how you think things should go put it in god's hands learn through prayer to put things in god's hands proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to i don't understand i was listening to a part of the brother branham's tape last night and he called it lean not to thy own understanding trust in the lord with all thy heart lean not to their own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths but i hope that you're praying for me because i want god to direct my path and i need your prayers need to make sure that when i'm up here i'm not preaching about uh some uh great revelation that i think i got when god wants me to be speaking on prayer are you catching what i'm saying i know that i know that i know god is in this today and we need to depend we need to depend on god to bring the word for us not that john's up there doing his best to help some people it's not that it's god almighty helping his spiritual body i'll be the first to tell you i have no idea what god is doing and he's not obligated to tell me and i don't even ask him to tell me i just ask him to tell me lord what does your people need what do you want for your people because that's all that matters to me god wants preeminence and he needs preeminence and it must be done through free more agency in other words you must give yourself over to you must surrender yourself over to it god uses your prayers to bring about what is truly needed for his body those prayers it what brings harmony with god to move in other words god will refuse to meet that need until somebody prays for that need that's just the way god operates now he can do anything he's god but he refuses unless you pray now god died for our sins and we can pray god forgive me of those sins but if we choose not to forgive our brother god chooses not to forgive us so god has choices too and god chooses to use your prayers that's why we need to pray it's a way for us to get involved in god's economy instead of just i don't i don't i i don't have nothing to do with it it's just so far out there it doesn't matter what i do how many times i pray nothing ever happens that is just a lie from the devil come on say amen to the word amen it is the factual fervent prayer of a righteous man that availeth much god uses prayer we need to keep praying when one part of the body begins to have a need your headship or your intelligence tells you oh ow there's a sliver i got to get that sliver out your intelligence tells you you better take care of it and it uses another part of the body to take care of that need it's the same thing in prayer the intelligence of almighty god through the power of the holy spirit lays the burden on your heart pray for that one that person's got a spiritual sliver of their eye amen god lays burdens on her heart one choice god has made is that often he cannot operate his will outside of your prayers that's you know even jesus when his disciples came to him and they asked him lord would you teach us how to pray well how what the fundamentals and how do you just pray and in that fundamentals he said lord thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven there's a will in heaven for us today and when we learn to pray lord that your will be done here in this local body as it is in heaven hallelujah he uses prayers to carry out his will for the body another choice that god has made is that prayer alone is not enough you've got to have faith when you pray without faith we can't even please god how is god going to answer a murmuring complaining prayer think about what i'm saying here prayer is important but if we don't have the right attitude in our prayer then it's not going to get the job done we must get into the spirit of prayer willing to wait on the lord will eventually get us in the spirit of prayer i received a quote this morning from my daughter ann she said if you don't pray often you won't gain a love for praying prayer is work and therefore it is not very appealing to our natural sensibilities but the simple rule of prayer is this begin praying and your taste for prayer will increase the more you pray the more you acquire the desire for prayer the energy for prayer and the sense of purpose in prayer this is important for our message praying always ephesians chapter 6 verse 18 ephesians 6 chapter chapter 6 verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplications for your favorite friends for your enemies to those you don't get along with for those you don't seem to care much for the way that we view prayer is different than the way god views prayer he wants us praying for everybody without respect to persons there's many needs enter into the spirit of prayer supplicating caring about everybody just get in prayer and start calling out people's names one after another after another and before you know it there'll come a burden on your heart for certain people and when you enter into that you you've made connection with the holy ghost and god uses that network your prayer in that network to meet that need well brother john when i talked to them they they didn't they weren't totally deliberate of that you maybe they weren't but your prayer was needed to help them get through that we can't sit here and and and use our imagination and how we think things should go if you feel weak in prayer just just start with getting on your knees just wait there he'll draw nigh to you isaiah chapter 40 verse 28 has thou not known has thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is he weary remember opening scripture now men ought always to pray and not faint doesn't faint there's no searching of his understanding he giveth power to those of us when we're fainting i've been in this category many times and i would not be here today unless god gave me some power and the power that he gives you you may need more power tomorrow and more power the next day the key though is wait on the lord why doesn't he just give you power no matter what because he wants a relationship with you he wants you to spend time with you he's more interested in that communion with you than you just getting what you want he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the you shall faint and be weary we're living in that hour and the young men shall hardly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint god has power for every one of us he has strength for every one of us but we've got to be willing to enter in to that network of prayer with him as you begin to strengthen yourself from prayer god uses you more and more for the body i mean a lot of times we get so weak in prayer that we can hardly pray ourselves our own needs but after you you gain strength and you you begin to increase in strength then you you can enter now into prayer one for another it's true and i'll just say like this sometimes i've started out praying for one another when i haven't seen to get where i want to get to with god in my prayers i just feel like lord where am i missing you and then i began to just pray for others and god is so pleased with that he is so faithful for his presence to come when you start praying for somebody it's as sure as anything because god is one that lives for others and all of a sudden faith begins to rise in your heart and then you can pray for yourself the way you should unselfishly amen praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there and to with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints now there's a whole lot in there but basically you need to be paying attention to the rest of the body you need to be paying attention this church is more than just you i'm not belittling you i'm just saying there's more than to you you need to be thinking about others if we thought about prayed about others more did you know you'd be happier we'd be stronger we'd be thriving in god's economy it wouldn't matter what's happening with colvin james chapter 5 verse 13 it's through prayer that needs are met is any among you afflicted of course what's the answer let him pray well brother john i'm afflicted why don't you pray from me what does the scripture say is any afflicted let him pray now i understand when you're not doing well it's really hard to enter in i understand that but you've got to try to do your part and the more you pray the more god's heart will begin to work in others to pray for you is any mary let him sing psalms is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him amen anointing him with oil in the name of the lord his name is a high tower the righteous run into it and they're safe amen and the prayer of what faith not the prayer of complaining of murmuring of why me lord why do i gotta pray why am i going through this that does not avail the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him so don't be thinking well i have sinned too much i have it does not matter the promise is if he has sinned they shall be forgiven keep praying keep believing confess your faults one to another pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man gets the job done it availeth much elias was a man subject to light passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit now this may seem kind of weird that god had asked someone not to pray and didn't pray and then god wanted to pray again to reign did i say that right no say it again i'll say it again it may seem weird that god would ask somebody to pray for that it would not rain for three and a half years and then after the three and a half years he would put on his heart to pray again that it would rain now i don't think elijah would say look we got to sit down and talk about this you know it's going to hurt the economy the the crops it's going to really hurt these families we're not in the business of telling god what to do or rearranging his thinking about certain situations god just wants us to do what he wants us to do and pray if he puts on your heart pray for them pray for that person you get so locked in the spirit you won't even realize why you're saying what you're saying but it's god using your body your vessel to meet that need whatever god is wanting of that need it may seem contrary to your thinking but god wasn't off when he told elisha to do that god's not off when he tells you how to pray but we've got to get into the network of prayer see the purpose of prayer god operates through prayer we can thrive in god's economy through prayer it becomes a great symphony of prayer when all of us are praying i'm sure you've either all been to a symphony or you have seen a symphony and all these uh musicians uh are there in some sort of order and uh they're all facing one way some are sitting some are standing but they're there for a purpose to play their part in this theme that they're going to be given this music on and they're not facing different directions you don't see some guitarist or some guy over on the side look at me look at me some guy in the drums doing no they're there in sync paying attention to the conductor god is the great conductor and they have been trained to get in harmony with the conductor and that conductor he stands in front of them and every one of them are looking at him they're paying attention and i've often wondered why does that man stand up there and go don't they know the song by now but he's speaking to them he's reminded them he said i'll bring all things to your remembrance i'll lay burns on your heart and when a song is being played you've got so many different instruments when the flutes are supposed to be playing you definitely don't want the drums and the trombones and the the banjo coming in it's not the time for it so we all have a part to play how many times you just you want to go up to somebody you just want to say something but it didn't work out it just wasn't time you wait your time stay in prayer god will open the door he opens the door that no man closes amen and he closes the door when it's time to close the door now this is what happens in prayer we're part of the orchestra of god we are part of god's orchestra and the holy spirit is trying to conduct a song pleasing to his ears amen there's no greater song than when you're praying for a soul to come to jesus heaven rejoices over that song that's where his heart is at we get so stuck on ourselves we don't hardly think of others that's why we need to be paying attention to the conductor because he's going to lay on your heart to pray for somebody somebody that needs a job somebody that needs a place to live there's a sister that needs to be baptized there's a sister who's who's struggling who's fainting and the conductor he's wanting you this is the time for you to come in and pray because he's touched he's speaking to your heart he's looking directly this is a time to play your instrument get on your knees and pray there's some young mother that's learning how to bring a child into the world and does it never done it before pray for that one there's someone that's struggling with colvin pray for that one there's dan bezzakowski he is leaving the pride on it it's time i want you to pray for him well what does it matter god knows just pray for him what about this this this sister that hasn't come for a while don't talk about it pray it's your turn to pray look at the conductor he's laying down your heart there's a there's a symphony going on look at our poor sister cheryl i personally never seen anything quite like how you can have a good day in the next days like the bomb fell out we need to pray one for another not just because she's my wife she's part of the body vital part of the body a part of the body that we're all affected by when she's having a bad day we're having a bad day here when she's happy playing we're all happy singing are you with me what about when you think about those that are not in church that's god telling you it's your turn it's your turn to pray i need you to pray right now for that part of the body but look at the re it doesn't matter pray pray god knows what he's doing just i need you to pray for the body it's how it functions you take any organ in your body don't talk about the appendix right now but you think about any organ in your body and if there is a need you give it help look at the boy who who ate those erasers all the time something inside of there was a deep calling inside of him for sulfur he didn't know what he was doing he just needed it we need to get in prayer and get into a harmony with the symphony of prayer god wants to use us together as one body praying one for another not some little group the percussion's out to the side just oh it's all about me god's not pleased with that attitude no matter what church you'd be and he wouldn't be pleased with that ed well i wouldn't have that attitude if i was in another church i don't believe that i i don't believe that god don't believe that you are who you are a symphony a prayer god conducting the symphony a lot of times we don't want to show up for practice and when it comes time to perform i'm so busy i got other things on my heart i don't even hear the symphony going we're just so far away god is here conducting his music of his will he just needs you to pray you don't got to know what to say just pray when you get in the spirit god will use your vessel he will use your heart he will use your words he will use your your your spirit and if you don't needs aren't going to be met but brother john i have a need god hasn't met it yet well i want to ask you a question did you seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness god's not a liar god is more interested in you spending time with him than your need being met you may be interested in your need being met god is calling us to a sympathy of prayer at home spend more time in prayer i've been challenged with this myself i'm not in a different spot than you but i don't want you to listen to that devil that says well we're just kind of like in a waiting period there's not a whole lot you can do souls can be won if you got in the spirit god can use your prayers to win a soul somewhere on a foreign field how many is praying for brother mark's bible studies here's a man who's reaching out maybe we got behind it a little bit more maybe we see a soul come from it amen we need to get in in sync with the lord amen let's stand together may god bless you as you labor to enter in to prayer like never ever before god will use your prayers a lot more than the devil is going to tell you just believe only believe all things are possible to him that believeth i have a list of a lot of needs in our church because you know honestly every one of us has needs and there's just something about when you care about somebody else's need that god moves in behalf of those needs i've witnessed it so many times when people are praying for somebody else god meets their need they didn't even ask for it i've seen that that's the way god operates and to know that we can be in harmony with the lord not just you know here there but there's a i'm in sync i've been praying and you know you don't have to tell anybody you're praying for them what you have to do is pray for them god is the one that meets the need now it's encouraging to know that we're praying one for another it is it is and we really all appreciate that but what is needed greater is that we pray one for another in the spirit because it's the effectual fervent prayer that gets the job done and god is looking to us his body to pray one for another more than we've ever prayed before we're living in an hour amen let's bow our hearts in prayer before i ask the lord is there someone here today that says brother john would you remember me i want to pray like i should be praying amen like god wants me to pray like every hand is just raised every hand what a beautiful thing god's orchestra right here wanting to sing and play in harmony with the conductor our heavenly father we come to you with thanksgiving in our heart that you use the prayer of someone to save us to bring us to you you use the prayer of someone that we got healed that we got delivered that we got strengthened that we got encouraged lord you're still using the prayers of others to help us we're so grateful to you for that lord [Music] today lord i want to be the first [Music] i should be the first to ask you to forgive me where i've come short of praying the way that you have ordained us to pray one for another i pray that your blood will cover us today that just wash us but lord that that blood would remain there that life there that we could apply it to our lives sin that we could have a time of prayer set aside every day interceding for all saints in the spirit may take us a little bit to get strength to get out of the flesh to enter in but oh god it's worth it because you'll use every single one of us [Music] when we effectually fervently pray for one another that those needs that we pray for will be met that our prayers would avail much that they would accomplish much because they met the purpose bless every heart here bless every heart that's watching in right now in their homes praying oh god use me use me the prayer of every heart granted today we ask lord and ask lord that when you look down upon us that you could see a harmony amongst this little body a symphony of prayer one for another so closely drawn together lord that it's edifying it's one another in love and supplying every need through the great god who supplies all of our needs according to thy great riches and glory oh granite today lord we love you we thank you for these things use our vessels lord use these vessels we humbly pray these things and give you all the glory for it now in advance for we ask these things in jesus christ's precious name amen thank you for it lord thank you lord jesus amen let's sing that little course she's playing but his strength is perfect when our strength is gone he'll carry us when we can't carry on become strong his strength is perfect his strength is perfect his strength is perfect when our strength is gone he'll carry us when we can't carry on raised in his power the weak becomes strong his strength is perfect his strength is perfect amen amen they that wait upon the lord amen teach me lord to way down on my knees till in your own good time answer my plea teach me not to rely on what do but to wait in prayer for an answer from you they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as egos

another amen god bless you ben mike george said some things about prayer he was on the battlefield he got shot a bunch of times but all the bullets went through you know the bible says that you know when you seek god and pray that he'll even make his enemies your enemies and he had the testimony with them and they're asking you know how did how did you know the indians were asking how'd you not get shot all the bullets you know and when we shot at you we saw the bullets go go at you he said well if i have anything to crank to my life he says because i've got a praying mother amen praise god and i want to give a short testimony when i was working with young about 19 i didn't really know anything about that amen that's right remember she had been praying that i would call her and at the very moment that she had been praying that i would call her i called her the first thing she said to me was i've just been praying and i had a voice to sit there said why don't you call that's right
