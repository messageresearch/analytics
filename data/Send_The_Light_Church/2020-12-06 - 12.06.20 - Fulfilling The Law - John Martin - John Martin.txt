may his presence just reveal himself to each of you amen it's also an honor to have brother ike his family with us again today may god bless you and just meet every need that you would have amen turn with me if you would to the book of saint matthew for opening scriptures this morning and then i'll have you be seated have a few things to say before we get into the message but i wanted as we're standing to read our opening scripture amen matthew chapter 5 starting with verse number 17 we'll read just a few verses there but let's look to the author amen heavenly father we come to you today lord depending on you depending on the author of this word that we're going to read to help inspire it to us reveal it to us open it to us shine more light on it for our lives god come and take control of the service not just in these four walls or lord in our homes where we're at today but inside of our vessels lord reveal your word down deep inside and build your church in each one of us father today lord you know the needs that we have you know our dependency is on you we're looking to you we lord we know lord you're the one that started this work inside of us and lord we're looking to you to finish this work so lord we just pray that lord as you look down upon our needs lord that you'd come and meet them according to your great riches and glory father we love you for this we thank you for this opportunity lord that the doors are open that we could be here you've given us health and strength to be here we praise you for that we just ask that lord you be with those that are less fortunate than us today lord that needs would be met in their lives that you'd heal the sick the afflicted lord that you'd strengthen the feeble uh the feeble-minded lord and lord that you just lift up thy people wherever they would be we thank you for these things now lord we committed all into your hands today in the name of jesus christ and we give you the praise and honor for it amen and amen amen thank you lord amen starting here in matthew chapter 5 verse 17 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i say unto you till heaven earth past one jot or one title shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them and shall be shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven for i say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the pharisees ye shall in no wise or no case enter into the kingdom of heaven and god bless you may be seated this morning we received a call about 10 minutes after brother from brother boaz uh just before his dad or just after his dad had passed away so we want to pray for uh the family of brother prakash as they are going through a very hard time his daddy had passed away and he they labored together in the gospel and it's a hard thing as as the chanult family and the mead family and that the children are are suffering and will be suffering for a period of time and and perhaps to some degree with thoughts for until the lord comes but god is is able to bring a comfort and a sustaining power and let's just pray for the the family that god will be with him i appreciate your prayers for brother dan basicowski his liver is failing and he is not a candidate for a liver transplant so we're definitely in trying times and the hour is late we just need to we need one another we need to pray for one another hold one another up in prayer we need god in this hour amen before we get into the message i just had some thoughts on my heart this morning that i wanted to share and there's been a big uh spike in the colvit virus and it's again as this thing escalates fear seems to find its way with this virus as we're all aware that this virus is real it's unpredictable and it has monstrous capabilities the virus has also been a perfect betting ground for fear it is like this virus has opened the door for fear to capitalize on in the situation the bible teaches us that fear is a spirit of evil torment as we know god has not given us the spirit of fear but a power and love and of a sound mind it's two different spirits yet the spirit of fear is all around us fear wants us to believe in something that is not for us now think about that fear wants us to believe in something that's not for us the virus is real it's a sickness and the prophet taught us that uh sicknesses cancer is a spirit and the devil is using the effects of this virus to get people to believe in something that's not for them fear is a manipulator job is a good example of this he had uh or i should say jonah jonah i don't know why i wrote job but i'm sure job went through a lot of fear once something when he started losing his family i mean i think the devil came and said you're going down the tube but jonah is is a good example of this also he lacked oxygen because he was wearing a mask of seaweed and vomit and his stomach fluids were all around him it was a real situation to jonah and if anyone could identify with it it would have been jonah the spirit of fear was telling jonah that he had gone too far it was over for him this was going to be the end of him there was no more light at the end of the tunnel you reach the end so it was a real situation but he chose not to allow the spirit of fear to direct his life he called the spirit of fear a lying vanity and to observe it or to listen to it would mean forsaking his own personal mercies god has mercy for every one of us god is rich in mercies and i want each of you to keep focused on the lord the lord is with us regardless of the situation he promised never to leave us never to forsake us that he would be with us in every situation right to the end david said in psalms 23 3 he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake so the holy spirit is leading us in paths of righteousness but look at this next verse in this path that he's leading you in you're going to walk through a valley of shadow of death and yea though i walk through the valley of shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me and thy rod and thy staff they are the ones that comfort me so like jonah david clearly made a choice not to enter entertain a spirit of fear if you know god is with you you are his child you know god's with you right here if the spirit of god is with you why fear if the spirit of power and love and of a sound mind is with you why fear see fear is a manipulator and it wants you to believe in something that's not for you because when you fear you can't have faith now we all have a choice as we're walking through this valley of the virus choose not to fear choose not to fear you remember as the devil speaks to you and says all types of things to you make a choice not to fear you can't stop the devil from flying but you can stop them from coming and painting a big old nest in your head telling you this big story this is for you this is for you no it's not for me choose to keep your mind focused on the lord i'm not saying it's mind over matter but keeping your mind on christ will keep your mind in peace verse 5 thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runeth over god is still going to take care of us right in the middle of this fearful virus he's still going to take care of us he's still going to feed us he's still going to anoint us he's still going to make our cup to run over right in the presence of our enemy keep focused on the lord that's the message we have a rock moment by moment make a conscious decision you're not allowed to take an hour and give it to fear and expect your mind to be at peace after that hour you can't allow your mind to wander in the enemy's camp you can't allow any old thoughts in your mind you've got to keep it stayed on the lord isaiah 26 3 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth thee the more you think on god the more you'll be able to trust the lord and the greater your trust will grow but you have to make the decision i'm going to stay here with the lord you just can't allow your mind to go anywhere and then expect to be kept in peace it's a battle we're in a battle and we're not denying what's out there we're just taking sides we're taking sides in our mind where we're going to be where we're going to stand how we're going to view this i believe there's mercies for me i believe there's grace for me i'm going to stay here i don't got the answers out there for everything in every situation friends i don't got it but i'm just going to do what the lord wants me to do make the choice to keep your thoughts on the lord he is your rock all other thoughts are sinking sin amen well this morning we want to talk on fulfilling the law many people don't want the law they're against the law they view the laws do's and don'ts it was what put them in prison and grace is what set them free therefore many people think that the law was done away with or it was destroyed when jesus came but jesus said one jot or one title shall in no wise pass away till all be fulfilled none of the commandments shall be done away with amen all the law has to be fulfilled so we don't want to think that it's okay to break to break even the least of god's commandments we don't want to think like that we don't want to teach or express it it's not a big deal because we've got grace come on jesus said that the law is so important that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven the law is important jesus came to fulfill the law now how did he do it in one way he fulfilled the law that was given to adam in genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the guard thou shalt freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat serve thou shall surely die so he was speaking to adam when he spoke these words and god was a part of adam amen and when man partook of the tree death was the sentence surely death was what god required because god spoke it and when jesus died at calvary he fulfilled that part of the law that was required death god never did away with the law when jesus came mercy wasn't going uh uh going to to replace the law mercy is when he took our place but the law was still fulfilled when jesus laid down his life on mount calvary he not only fulfilled adam's death sentence but he tasted death for every man for every one of us because we were not born by the will of god if we were we would never have to be born again we were born with the wrong nature satan lied to eve in the beginning simply because he was just jealous and he wanted to be like the most high similar to the time when all the presidents and governors were jealous over daniel and he tricked king darius into signing a degree which could not be altered that whoever would pray to another god than to the king for 30 days would have to be thrown into the lion's den these jealous men knew that the law of the mesh and the persians could not be altered they knew it just like satan lucifer he knew that god would have to keep his word daniel chapter 6 verse 14 then the king when he heard these words were sword is pleased with himself and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and he labored till the going down of the son to deliver him now this is the heart of god that he had in mind when adam fell he didn't want to lose but he had already spoke the word he couldn't take it back that's exactly what god did for adam when he fell he loved him he made him uh cults to cover him and in genesis chapter 3 verse 15 he said i will put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and mercy and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel god had already provided away at that moment because he loved adam god provided a way to the seed of adam when god would come himself to the body of jesus and pay the penalty of that death sentence that could not be altered for adam because what god speaks it has to come to pass it was calvary where god delivered us god had faith in his power of deliverance and i'll say it like this king darius had faith in the power that daniel served he said he said thy god shall protect thee shall deliver thee god had faith in his ability to deliver us hallelujah daniel chapter 6 verse 16 the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him to the lion's den and the king spake and said unto him thy god whom thou serve us continually he will deliver thee that's faith going against his word didn't want this to happen but his faith was in the god that daniel served daniel 6 verse 23 then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel out of the den so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found on him because he believed in his god i don't care what's going on it's all about you being focused on your god god believes in his power to help us and when we believe no hurt will come to our souls jesus said think not that i come to destroy the law or the prophets i come not to destroy but to fulfill for the law john chapter 1 verse 17 the bible says for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ grace and truth was the fulfillment of the law there's other parts of the law jesus said i am the way to the father he was the way to the father i am the truth of god that sets men free that gives them a new nature when they're born again i am the life my words are spirit and they are life jesus was the fulfillment of the law he brought grace he brought truth now not only grace was part of the law but mercy was part of the law matthew chapter 23 verse 13 20 verse 23 i'm laying a foundation about fulfilling the law this morning please stay with me woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithes of mint and anise and come in and have omitted the weightier matters of the law and what are they judgment not on others but self-judgment mercy we all want mercy but we're talking about being merciful to others and faith these all ye have done and not to leave the other undone so there is a fulfillment of mercy that god wants us to to fulfill god is looking for us to fulfill that part of the law now we may have thought that the law was done away with when jesus came on the scene but it's not true at all jesus never came to do away with it but to fulfill it this is important to understand if we're going to fulfill god's will in our life john chapter 1 verse 1 and the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god verse 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us when we behold his glory the glory is the only begotten son full of grace hallelujah and truth and if i could say it like this he was full of mercy full of mercy look at the woman caught in adultery full of mercy he fulfilled the law he fulfilled many parts of the law but i want to bring your attention to the part of the law that hasn't been completely fulfilled yet because jesus said one jot or one tittle shall no wise pass away till all be fulfilled there is more of the law to be fulfilled this is exciting first of all the law must be carried out through the bride for she will be the only one that will be able to fulfill the law god made a covenant with man and man could not keep his covenant because he could not keep the law it only put man in jail he was sold under the law the bible tells us the flesh is weak and he could not keep the law so what did god do he made another covenant because the law could not be fulfilled in hebrews chapter 8 verse 7 for if the first covenant had been faultless then should no place had been sought for the second for finding fault with them he saith behold the days cometh saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah there wasn't a problem with the law there was really a problem with the covenant between god and man and that is that man did not have the ability to keep it man lacked the ability to love the law with all of his heart his heart had evil in it and though he wanted to do the right thing there was something inside of him that didn't want to do the right thing jeremiah 17 verse 9 says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it so a man that's always talking about where he knows where his heart is at you better be careful you're speaking contrary to what the bible says it takes the holy ghost to show us where we're at today there would be no need to come to church and find out where we're at with god if we always walked around thinking we knew where we're at man's nature was corrupted with selfishness under that first covenant and anytime we're under that first covenant oh i guess i gotta go to church well i guess i gotta go the second mile if i have to the nature under the first covenant it was corrupted it was a judgmental nature it was an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth it was corrupted with a lustful nature just like lucifer and i'm going to do my own thing so god sets out to make another covenant with man praise god for that where would we be without it hebrews chapter 8 verse 9 not according to the covenant i made with their fathers and the day when i took them by the hand i led them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my first covenant and regarded them not saith the lord so what does god do he makes another covenant he sent his son to pay the price for our fallen nature and makes a way for the law to come and live back inside of a human being he sends back the holy ghost amen to live inside of man and when the holy ghost comes and lives inside of us the author he comes and lives inside you god can keep his own word hebrews chapter 10 verse 15 whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and into their minds will i write them and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more so he's not doing away with the law he's taking it off the book and placing it in our heart and only he can do that only the holy ghost can do that man can't do that the holy ghost is speaking and bearing witness of this new covenant with man that god would place in to man's heart and into their minds amen the new covenant is to bring about a proper relationship between man and god god will not accept man's half-hearted efforts it's not good enough he wants a relationship with his word so he places the word inside of his people through the holy ghost and they become the word the living word they become the written epistles read of all men it's just written there in their heart and they become one with the word hebrews chapter 8 verse 10 for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their minds and write them into their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest and that's how the first covenant was here's the ten commandments i want to read them to you this is what you need to do you better go obey them but when god places into your heart his word a love for his word you have a desire to know him a desire to seek him and as you do he will reveal himself to you it's a different covenant that's why having a relationship with god outside the holy ghost is totally miserable incapable of fulfilling we need god on the inside we need to seek the holy ghost on the inside we need more of god on the inside first john chapter 2 verse 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you all things is truth and there's no lie and even have taught you ye shall abide in him so you and the lord become one you no longer go to church to learn about god you go to church to learn where you're at with god you want to learn about god read your bible pray every day it's about where you're at and your intentions and your desires and and where you want to be it's your relationship is the time that you spend with god outside of church this you're coming you're subjecting yourself to god to speak to your conscience you're giving god preeminence that's why everybody don't stand up and everybody talks at one time we all got something to say but we're subjecting ourself to god to an office that he's provided a five-fold ministry and we don't take it lightly we don't we don't take it as a smorgasbord i'll take this and throw that away and you know dissect and be your own scientist no we're believers we believe god is in it hebrews chapter 8 verse 12 for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities while i remember no more isn't that beautiful what a beautiful covenant with god he doesn't hold anything over you when he goes under the blood it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness you might remember it but he made an agreement he's forgiven you he justifies you he puts you on the same plane but we still have to fulfill the law don't lose track of that in that he saith a new covenant he have made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away so we learn here in hebrews chapter 8 and 10 that god promises to write his law in his people by the holy ghost and through the process man would truly know who god is and what he likes and dislikes and his nature and his character that it would be a personal one-on-one don't aren't you glad of that that that you don't need any man between you and god god didn't want to put any man between you and him there's no mediator between god and man than the man christ jesus amen god desires to reveal himself personally to you and when you desire to know god personally you'll spend time with him and say lord here i am have your way reveal yourself to me i believe in the realness of god just like david the bride will be a people after god's own heart they'll be the only ones that will fulfill the law the reason that it's hard for a lot of people to serve the lord completely is because they haven't received enough holy ghost you can receive just enough of god to get miserable god has never been a halfway he never caught you to a halfway relationship the battle is us learning to give our all to him but i'll say it like this if you try to do that without the holy ghost all the time you're going to be miserable and you're not you're going to just fail miserably you need god's help ask for the holy ghost ask for him to fill you forget about where you're at how much your problems are how unworthy you feel has nothing to do with it you're focusing on what you want with god and that is i want a relationship that's pleasing to god don't wait to get pleasing to have a pleasing relationship with god spend time asking for help i need you i need more of you inside of me that will give you your heart's desire there's nothing that i can do what house will i build him what am i going to do for god god's desire is to fill the heart of his people he wants to live in his people but he can't do it if there's a will that's stopping him from coming in so the wall that has to be broken down is the wall of self-will and that happens when you say into my heart and you want him to come in and you just i desire to desire it i want it keep yielding to it become a good yielder because god's a good filler the holy ghost inside every christian makes it easy for him to serve god to serve his word to serve the commandments to fulfill the law but that's why it's hard for some believers to be happy in serving the lord because they're trying they can't do it in themselves and they become unhappy and miserable they're not fulfilling the law unless you fulfill the law you will not be happy until you fulfill the law it's hard to remain happy it's the reason paul said i die daily let me just say this it's not just having the holy ghost but without yielding to the holy ghost a believer will eventually find himself miserably unhappy and without a purpose paul said i am crucified with christ i mortify the deeds of the flesh if we don't deny ourselves daily we can never fulfill god's will our will will stand in the way of god's progress for our lives god is capable to destroy any of us at any moment one day he's going to destroy the earth there's going to even be a new heaven god has power he created everything the thing is he has a respect not to go against our will that's how powerful he respects you even when you're wrong he respects you that's why i'll say it like this respect is something you can't have too much of god can only write his law in our hearts as we allow him to free more agency and only by obeying them through free more agency will you fulfill them and will give you joy and peace in the things that you really desire god put something inside a man to hunger if there's a deep calling god does not want his people to be unhappy miserable full of fear wandering in the wilderness he doesn't want that his desire is there's jordan cross over there's the promised land go we're the ones that say i don't know if i want to do that there's giants over there that's a hard to it's really hard just to give your all that's what they had to do they had to go in there and face death walk through the valley of shadow of death and trust that god was going to be with them and it was better to say you know what i think i'll serve god over here instead of going through that experience but i'll tell you if you want the holy ghost you're going to have to trust the lord i want more holy ghost i need more trust i need to spend more time with the lord too often we take our liberty that god gives us children that have been set free born again and you know what we do with it we please herself i'm saved liberty is not for our will it's not for our desires it's not for our plans it's not for our pleasures it's not to please ourselves galatians chapter 5 verse number 13 for brethren you have not been called unto liberty i'm sorry for brethren you have been called unto liberty how come nobody you know said anything on that you better be paying attention we've been called on to liberty god has given us liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but use your liberty by love to serve one another it's awful quiet we got one amen on that we all we all have a lot of amens on that because that's the word of god so a question to ask ourselves is what are you doing with the liberty that god has placed in your life god has given you liberty what have you what have you done with the liberty that he's placed in your life are you loving others with that liberty are you loving yourself are you serving others are you serving yourself a lot of people enjoy the freedom and liberty that our nation has but they don't want to humble themselves to give any kind of allegiance for what is done so they could have the liberty kind of spirit is that it's like a lot of believers today they love the liberty that christ gives them but they don't love god enough to serve others the law of god still needs to be fulfilled we still need to respect the word amen god's given us liberty for a purpose verse 14 for all the law is fulfilled in just one word even this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself think about just the whole law that we're talking about to be fulfilled in just one word love if we would always love one another we would be able to fulfill the word of god the law of god just like jesus did he fulfilled the law when he loved the world so much that he gave himself amen you have a chance to fulfill the law if you take that liberty that god gives you and love one another i love this word now i know it's a kind of crazy heart with this a virus going around and it kind of keeps you from distancing and all this stuff but i'll say it like this it has nothing to do about outwardness it's all about what's in your heart if you're so in love with god you will find a way to get it out and love others it may be through a phone call it may be through a text it may be through a card but you have an opportunity to forgive somebody you have an opportunity to show mercy to show love to show grace to be long-suffering to make god manifested in your life in your spirit or you can take that liberty and say it's all about what's happening in these four walls right here it's all about me that's not you're not fulfilling the law what you're saying is the law stopped with you that's what you're saying the law needs to be fulfilled through you there's a responsibility that comes with the law just love one another we have to do our part today to fulfill the law today the law is still in motion jesus told us to love one another the same way that he loved us in other words keep fulfilling the law in one word he covered our sins he forgave us he put things behind he put them in the sea of forgetfulness now what are you doing with that love inside of you whose sins are your covering who are you being merciful to what are you forgetting and putting behind you see you have a chance to fulfill the law you know the law that most people want to use is how come you're not wearing a tie today if you're a christian how come you're not giving me more you know it's judgmental the only time some christians think about the other side of the law is god giving to them god loving them god being merciful to them god being gracious to them but god has called us to fulfill the law to lay down our lives for one another to be merciful to one another blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy it's not out of our reach only the bride will fulfill the law his mercies when you think about it his mercies since calvary have been new every morning for us it wasn't just at calvary those mercies are real today and they're in action today all we got to do is ask god to forgive and he doesn't say well you know let's just have a little talk about this are you going to do it again no he knows we're frail he knows we're human but he's there to be merciful to us what about us who are we going to be merciful to well brother john you don't know what they did to me you don't know how it hurt me so what you're telling me is you can't fulfill the law of christ he's still being long-suffering with you god is still still fulfilling the law with you he's still not making you die he's still not giving you the death sentence i understand that he forgave you at calvary but he's not going to calvary again that means he's still forgiving you today for what you did yesterday and don't you tell me your sins are less than mine don't you do that don't you look at somebody and think that their sins are worse than yours that's unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the pharisees you shall no wise enter in and don't you say your sins are too great that god cannot forgive you don't you belittle the power of almighty god [Music] god is greater than any sin one day there will be no remembrance of what that devil did to us we don't know how long he's going to suffer billions and billions of years for all we know in hell but god said i know the thoughts i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace he wants to give us an expected end but what is the end that you expect of somebody else he's going to fulfill the law but what about you what about christ in you reaching out to somebody else do you have an expected end for them or if you cut them off god give us time to get through these beautiful scriptures we have today god does not want these laws written in our minds and our hearts to have some sort of collection of facts or some encyclopedia so we can describe what the law is he put them in our hearts and our minds so we can fulfill them james chapter 2 verse number 8 james chapter 2 verse number 8 if ye fulfill the royal law according to the scriptures now thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well let me just say this if you do not fulfill the law of christ you're not doing well if you do not love your neighbor just like you love yourself you are not doing well well brother john i think i'm doing just fine thank you you're not doing well on the side of god now i'm just reading the scriptures you can disagree with me but i really don't care because i'm just stating what the scriptures say now if i start saying something different than the scripture says that might bother me but if you stay with the word it doesn't matter if the whole world's against you look at verse 9 but if ye have respect to persons you commit sin and are convinced of the law you are a transgressor if you're going to respect who you're going to love and when you're going to love them ye are committing sin you're a sinner you're sinning i don't say you're sinner but you're sinning so you're a christian sinning so what kind of category is that not a good category right because when you think of a christian you think of christ like but the scripture is just telling us here that if we have respect to persons if you're going to choose well i like you i'm going to love you but i don't like you and i'm not gonna like you you're a transgressor you're not fulfilling the law of christ you're fulfilling your own law this is my law i like him i don't like him i'll do it this time because he's only done it once but if he does it you know seven times got a peter spirit on you we need a jesus spirit 7 times 70. we don't want to have respect to persons instead of fulfilling we become a transgressor of the law god has called us to fulfill the law that means you've got to love everybody the same come to grips with it sooner or later don't be a judge of who's worthy and who's not worthy having respect to pus persons puts you on the side the same side with all the transgressors don't view people as worthy or unworthy view people in one way love one word love that's it forget about what they've done forget about how many times they've done it forget about how it makes it does not matter view them one way love well brother john i'm just not going to become their friend and i'm not going to let them use me love get a revelation of love don't tell me what you're going to do and not going to do fulfill the law love we have no problem given our opinions on what the gospel is for our lives but by this one word all men shall know you're my disciples one when we manifest love to everybody the same you know what people will never ever know how true you are to god until you allow somebody to slap you on the face to pull your beard to use you to betray you they will never know the love of god in your life until you allow them to misuse you because the power of love is seen when god is forgiving you when it came personal to you and you know god forgave you know despite the what the sins you've done and how are people going to see the love of god in you if you no you're not worthy of that i don't like you because you how are you going to fulfill the law of god you've got to fulfill the law well we just read it we just read it brother john you don't know how bad that person is you have not had the experience that i've had with that person you don't know how they made me feel you don't know what they said behind my back you don't know how they tried to destroy me what does that have anything to do with the word of god does your word supersede the word of god don't make an excuse of why you can't love your neighbor as god has loved you there is no excuse god will not give you in fact he put you on the side of the transgressor because you decided sometime in your life to be a respecter persons god came to fulfill the law and you tell me which one of us on the planet that was worthy of calvary so why are you going to decide who's worthy of god's love in your life you know i can tell you this i could sit here and say well i think you know bob is not worthy of my love but you know tom uh you know he is that's my love that may be true because my love is limited but not god god's love is worthy to be loved by everybody how do i know that calvary calvary if it did it at calvary it'll do it inside of me that's why paul said i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i'm dead right i'm crucified but nevertheless i live because christ liveth in me christ is living the love of god through my life that's why he could uh why he could lay down his life and be a servant become all things to all men that he might win some to christ he showed us how to fulfill the law of christ he laid down his life for us for the brethren john lay down his life for the brethren if you think about it paul was not a respecter persons if he would have been a respecter persons i think he could avoided a lot of persecution he said well you know i'm kind of stretching the boundaries here i can see somebody's getting bothered about what i'm saying look i i'm sure there is spirits that are not happy with the word that's being preached right now but you know those spirits that might be bothering you are not of god the holy ghost is in unity with the word the word of god amen so be it may it be done in my life may the law of god be fulfilled in me may the world see that i'm laying down my life for everybody galatians chapter six verse number one brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault now this is for you who sometimes feel you just this situation is so bad with this person i just want to take my hands off the situation i just don't want to deal with it anymore brother and if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit in the spirit i love that in the spirit of meekness considering yourself lest you also be tempted what are you doing when you're doing this what are you really doing when you're doing this you are bearing one another's burden and when you bear one another's burden you're fulfilling the law of christ that's what jesus did when he said i didn't come to do away with the law but i come to fulfill it the fulfillment was when he bore your burdens but christ is still alive and if he's living in us we will bear one another's burden and when you do you fulfill the law i think it's awesome amen it's awesome brother i love it i love the word i love it i love it i love it i love that the word can challenge me and show me where i'm coming short of laying down my life for somebody you know satan is always telling us you're there you're there you're in the message you're in the truth you know what the same spirit laodicea has need of nothing i need him i see selfishness in my nature i need him i see me not want to lay down my life for somebody i need him i need to fulfill the law of christ and i can't do it on my own i need the holy ghost i need god living inside of me god is not coming to find out who could be the best person in their flesh he's coming for those who've been washed in the blood who's covered with the blood who's filled with the holy ghost who's got god on the inside of them they are one another's burden you know a lot of people think that people are so below them that they don't want to bear their burden this is the to me the saddest thing they view somebody else's problem as their problem they refuse to carry any of that burden to get underneath and help lift up and make sure that things are going good you've got to have a heart and a mind of god's laws to restore because that's what christ did he restored there's got to be somebody here today that's excited about this word if not i want you to know i'm excited about it today i'm excited about this word today for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he's deceiving himself in other words i don't have to i'm above the law i don't have to bear i don't have to do that but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoiced in himself alone and not in another be the one to fulfill the law you be the one it doesn't matter who else in this church doesn't want to go all the way with christ god is coming for those who are going all the way be the one to fulfill it don't be the one to say well i'm fulfilling it a little bit more than bob i think i'm fulfilling it more than anybody in this church no they that compare themselves with themselves is unwise compare with jesus compare with paul there's a reason paul's in there he laid down his life he followed the example that jesus did amen and god wants us to to do our part to fulfill the law to finish the work that he gave you and i to do in our age paul is not living in this age paul can't do it for you peter can't do it for you brother branham's not here to do it for you but you are here to do it to do the work of the lord to lay down your life for somebody that needs you that needs the lord that needs the lord let the love of god come out of you to where people don't see you anymore you can't go to somebody and say hey my name is john martin i love you so much i'm going to do this for you and i'm going to make you so good i'm going to take care of your problems and you know when you get done you're gonna be thinking of john martin it's not about john martin it's about getting out of the way and letting people see jesus that's fulfilling his law so help somebody in the name of the lord don't help somebody in your name amen god has called us to get grace and mercy to others that's how you fulfill the law of the lord paul showed us how to do it he took the liberty that god gave him that set him free from being a murderer from accusing the wrong things he had this liberty you know what he did with it he didn't go around just testifying i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved he took that liberty and he didn't make an occasion for the flesh but he became a servant he actually became all things to all men knowing that there was just a few of them they was going to get to save that's what he did with his liberty he died to himself that god could use his vessel and he laid down his life to fulfill the law didn't do away with the law don't let the law be done away with in your life don't say i'm done with the law now i'm not serving i'm not helping i'm not laying down my life i'm not bending over i'm not bearing anybody's no don't do that be the vessel that god can use to fulfill the law it's still being fulfilled it will be fulfilled that law when we get to heaven there ain't going to be something different than what there is now god is god he remains the same his people will have his word in their heart do you believe that amen second corinthians chapter 5 or second corinthians chapter 5 i just got a few scriptures god gave paul a ministry of reconciliation for what purpose to fulfill the law verse 18 all things are of god who have reconciled himself by jesus christ and given to us the ministry of reconciliation to restore others back to god to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself not putting their trespasses unto him and what not a period and is committed unto us the word of reconciliation so it didn't stop with jesus in other words jesus is still doing it but he's doing it through vessels that will take on the responsibility of fulfilling the law now then we are ambassadors for christ we're not christ we didn't become a new god we're just an ambassador for god as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ said be ye reconciled to god he didn't use his liberty for himself oh i'm free i'm saved i'm a christian it's all about me no he had a vision for souls he fulfilled the law of christ when you stop with yourself you're not fulfilling the law i know that's hard but there ought to be something inside of you with every heart you come in contact with be reconciled to god be reconciled back to god have a relationship with him that's all that matters everything's going to perish i'll tell you this virus is nothing compared to what's coming on the planet [Music] there's such destruction men are going to seek to destroy themselves that's how horrible it's going to be why we have a chance let god use you as an ambassador to reconcile others to christ for it made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might become the righteousness of god in him so that is our purpose with others he took the liberty that god gave him as a treasure and i want to close in this scripture in second corinthians chapter four paul took the liberty that god gave him as a treasure of power that laid down in his heart he lived for others and as he did he fulfilled the law of christ and we see here in chapter 4 verse number 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness have shined in our hearts remember he'd write the law in our minds and our hearts to give the light of the knowledge that he wrote inside of us of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of ourselves what are you doing when god gives you the word and you talk it in here and you do not share it with others what you're saying is it's yours i'm in debt today for what god did for me it's not all for me i got to give it to somebody amen that's what these scriptures god's given you a treasure this is what you're supposed to do with the treasure he's given you remember the person who went buried his treasure he just you wrapped himself in it he says it's all about me what happened to him god called him a wicked servant because a wicked servant stops fulfilling the law of christ it's all about them but a wise servant takes the word that treasure that god's given him and shares the love of god fulfills the word in just one word fulfills the law with just one word loving everybody and you can show love in a so many it's a countless ways that love can be shown amen so we have this treasure in our vessels we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken we were cast down but not destroyed what's really going on in our life always bearing about in our body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be manifest in our bodies what's happening the fulfilling of the law for we which live are always delivered unto the death uh for uh unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be man manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have a chance for the law to be fulfilled if we deny yourself and let christ love through us to others what a blessed opportunity we have to be used by god let's stand together may god bless you with this word may god fulfill the law in your life may he use your vessel to carry out this ministry that he's giving every one of us to love one another let it be said of you people could not tell who your enemies were let it be said of you that all that people ever saw was you loving everybody now i know it's a tall order but it's the fulfillment it's the fulfillment of the word i'll tell you there's not jesus died for the whole world there was not one sin that he wouldn't that he could not pay the price for that means if that same god is living in me he'll have the same attitude no matter what they do to me no matter what they do to me it's not about me i deserve everything that everybody's ever done to me let me say that again i deserve every evil thing that everybody has done to me because i know i'm a filthy creature but it's not for me to judge them but if christ died for me christ died for them if god's still forgiven me god wants to forgive them amen that's about our hearts and a word of prayer i just want to say every heart is about you those that are in your homes if you just feel loud with your own family maybe to put your hands hold hands or hands one another and just pray together i believe that god answers prayer don't you i believe god wants to do exceedingly above father as we stand here today in your presence in the presence of a living word that word that has been not only spoken to our hearts but is bore witness through the holy ghost lord that there's still a law that needs to be fulfilled in every one of us lord we don't want to be one where the law stops but we want to be the one that that law is carried out to the very end to those around us to those in our

we're praying thinking about those who've double crossed us those that have heard us god at this moment lord we lay it aside by the grace of god we want to fulfill the law and love them forgive them put it behind us just like you forgave us put it behind us lord let there be such a unity between us and you that we could freely forgive them as you forgave us lord if there's someone that we that you want us to restore god may we just start out with prayer get in prayer that we may come with a spirit of meekness be willing to wash your feet god for you've called us unto liberty but you said don't use that liberty for yourself but my love serve one another today this is our prayer father that you'd help us to love one another fill us with the power of the holy ghost to be able to do that
