situation no matter what you're going to no matter what you will go through you can have confidence that God is with you because his word said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he didn't just say that if you were doing good and if you did good that day no he promised to be with you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he knows we fail Amen I just wonder as we look to Ian and just asked her if she had a song amen praise or a little bit longer of a worship service today's being a special service I hope that's okay with you god bless you god bless and amen god bless everyone amen god bless you happy Mother's Day to all the moms my voice is a little bit scratchy this morning so please forgive me you for me with your holy hands before my birth you planned a perfect purpose for me on this earth I want to be all you've created me to be cuz for all you've done you deserve the glory so here's my everything I give you every part of me I surrender my plans my hopes my dreams you're so amazing makes me wish I had more to bring a little bit if he'll take it here's my everything they yeah I've been learning more about your love and finding for my every need it is enough though I never been more aware of my own and worthiness then when I come and bow before your holiness so here's my everything I give you every part of me I surrender my plans my hopes my dreams you're so amazing makes me wish I had more to bring but if you'll take it here's my everything makes me wish I had more to breathe but if you'll take it here's my everything [Music] amen I just love that we don't have to have a certain criteria just whatever you have give it to the Lord offer it to the Lord if he wanted you to have more anybody gave you more he didn't mess up when he made you just what you do have offer it back to him because that's what he created you for the Bible says that we were created all things were created by him and for him and he wants to use us amen praise the Lord amen before we have you stand for the reading of the word we just want to talk about a little an announcement as we're approaching going back to our churches I'd like to ask each and every one of you to share your your heart in and pray about how you feel about it a one you would like to start because I just want to say this if anybody feels uncomfortable about gathering together in in a room then especially the size of our little church there then I do not want you to feel pressured in any way of course and if you want to come and and wear a mask that's that's so much in order it's what however you feel but we are going to have to make a decision and you are the flock and we're not going about to meet everybody's need there are some they're itching to get back and there may be some that are not the one thing I will say is we're going to be gathering back in the old church it will not be the new church it's by far not ready I mean everything kind of got put on hold and plus we found that there's more red tape and permits and things that we have to get so it's going to take a little bit of time so we will be gathering in the old church and I don't know for how long honestly it could be three four months I really don't know but as soon as we can get an occupancy to the new building even if it's not finished and we can get occupancy and get in there that's going to be a better much bigger area to gather and so that's a good thing now the bad news is as once we start gathering together inside the church there at Leroy Street we're not going to be able to do the live-streaming like we're doing now it just there's not enough bandwidth and we're not going to be there for a long time and it takes a while just to get things extended so we might be able to do more of a of audio the other thing we can do is is perhaps tape that someone had made mention about taping the service and then putting it on on the on the website to go ahead and be able to watch it maybe a couple hours later so that's an option if you didn't want to go to the church but you wanted to be part of the service it wouldn't be like that would be the only thing it'd be just a couple hours delay so I just want to give you time to think about it pray about it and then if you could just you know contact us you know it's up to you if you want to do to the church app that's fine it certainly doesn't matter if everybody knows your opinion if you don't want your opinion to be made known by everybody but you you're you're concerned about then you just you know text us direct and then we'll go from there praise the Lord we're anxious about getting back to church or anxious about getting our country back going again and at the same time we want to do it in a very safe way and we certainly don't want to start any more any more problems so the Lord give us grace wisdom and leadership amen as we pray together let's stand together for the reading of the word this morning we're very grateful for our mothers and what I what a blessing they've been through to us through life and as we're gonna have a little little reading here as well see in the reading that I know like I grew up Maine in a single-parent home and my dad kind of played the role of mothers and fathers so you know brother branham talked about that one lady who just when she had her baby she just kind of threw it over the bridge or something like that to the water and brother Brandon said that the possum was more of a mother than that one lady or that child and just kind of disposed of her child and so we see that a mother isn't just you know in in in people it can be in animals and then also it can also be in in in in in men and in brothers and sisters you know so we all have can play the a role in being a mother a man let's just before we begin reading here in st. John chapter 19 if you want to find out that spots st. John chapter 19 and we're gonna begin reading with verse number 25 amen Matthew 119 verse 25 Amen if you got your spots there just hold them we're gonna just ask the Lord to bless this Ministry of the word this time Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this wonderful book it's the only book that we could that we can open and know of assuredly that there's no mistakes in it there's not a book that we should ever question we may not understand it and all the doctrine but it's something that we can read and always feel comfortable Lord we're blessed just about to read it lore but today we're asking for the deep things of God that you would come and bring us revelation today through the service pray that you would bless the reading of the word Lord all the scriptures all the things that would be said that would be around the truth of this hour may you come and bless each and every one Lord as we commit this service now into your hands in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen Saint John chapter 19 verse number 25 now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister Mary the wife of Cleophas and Mary Magdalene and when Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then say if he to his disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home amen god bless you may be seated Amen with just a simple title today of happy Mother's Day 2020 you know it's very difficult to preach on the same topic year after year and we just don't have that in us to preach the same thing and well you know many times we've we've looked at proverbs 31 and it is a tremendous tremendous chapter about the role model of a mother and we got a couple young mothers in her church who are just starting out and I think that is a tremendous chapter to read proverbs 31 because you just can't make any own kind of decisions in life and expect to get the results of what you get from being devoted to the calling of being a mother in the way that the gospel teaches us to be we also have in our church mothers that have children that are not babies but they're not quite teenagers yet and that would be a very good chapter for them to read I want to just encourage your mothers to read that chapter and to pursue in glean the things that we could from that we also got some mothers in our church that have children that are you know in their 20s and I want to encourage our sisters or mothers to to read that chapter if you have children in their 20s and I just want to say that when I look at Mary the who was at the cross of Jesus at this time she wasn't - - olds as she probably was probably you know she's probably about 50 I would think somewhere right around there and she's watching her son die on the cross and she wasn't too old to be a mother in fact the words that Jesus spoke there that we just read was he was he was giving her a job to do when he really looked at his mother says woman behold thy son and the disciple took her home and and yeah John had his part to do - to take care of her but also she had a part to play as a mother and it was to the disciple so you can see that no matter what age we are we can be a blessing to mother and to help other people and it we should look at it in a in a negative way you know sometimes we've heard we've heard in Shaymin on the on the men and that I've said well I just don't want to be mothered by you you know I just I think that we we need to respect a man our mothers and it's a role that I I I hope that none ever do away with I know obviously you can raise kids and be done there over but you know there's so much more to it and and before we get into this message I just wanted to read a little tribute to the mothers today amen and it goes like this a mother can be at one and at the same time both love lore and counselor to a heart sick daughter and the and a head football coach to an athletic son she's got the ability to meet both needs phrase God a mother can soul the tiniest stitch in the material for a dainty prom dress and she equally can experience threading to the heaviest traffic with a large station wagon a mother is the only creature on earth who can cry when she's happy laugh when she's heartbroken and work when she's sick a mother is as gentle as a lamb as strong as a giant only a mother can appear so weak and help us and yet at the same time can put the fruit jar cover on so tightly that even dad can't get it off a mother is a picture of helplessness when dad's around but a marvel of resourcefulness when she's all alone a mother has the angelic voice of a member of the celestial crier as she sings the Brahms Lullaby to a baby how tightly in her arms and yet the same voice Kendra dwarfed the sound of an amplifier when she calls her boys in for supper a mother has the fascinating ability to be almost everywhere at once and she's alone and she alone can somehow squeeze an enormous amount of living into the average day a mother is in old fashion to her teenager she's just mom to the 3rd grader and she's mama to a little two-year-old there's no greater thrill in life to point to that wonderful woman and be able to say to all the world that's my mother amen well we want to say God bless all of our mothers for all their hard work they certainly have to have had and have to put up with a lot at whatever age we are as mothers Amen god bless our mothers this morning well let's back to her our scriptures now and getting into this message there were three Mary's at the front of the cross and it was a very human moment for Mary the mother of Jesus and really for Jesus too on the cross he died as a human sacrifice he died as a human sacrifice Mary had heard the crowds just chanting I want you to go with me if you would to this moment just try to picture yourself there if you would Mary had heard the the crowds chanting all away with him away with and give us Barabbas just mocking to save him and to save himself but he couldn't she heard all that she must have been tore up to see them nail her son to the cross to a piece of wood it must have tore her up inside hearing them never caring about her son they had no love for him at all when all that her son ever did was love everyone without respect a person's Bible says when he saw the multitude he was filled with compassion must have been hard for Mary to see them scold him when guile was never ever found in his mouth to watch her son be disrespected when he never mistreated another human being people spoke out abuse Lee and reviled him when he never ever revolved against anyone else he was so precious in the sight of Mary and it must have been so hard for Mary to stand there while all this was happening and to see her son die and at the same time having people at the funeral that were celebrating and mocking making a holiday of rejoicing out of her own son's death she watched her son suffer as a man and never threaten people back he committed himself to the father's hand what an example of Jesus was for us brother Brad said in questions and answers in 1854 he said he was a man when he was attacked at the cross as a sacrifice to take away her sin he was a man with nails drove into his hand he was a man with thorns over his head he was a man with Mackey mocking soldiers as they spit on him he was a man that was bruised and striped and wounded he was a man he was a man when he cried my God why is they'll forsaken me he was a man crying for help but on Easter morning when the seals of death broke loose there at the tomb that was more than a man he proved he was God but Mary remember Mary was a human mother just like all of us and as a mother this must have been the hardest time for Mary in her life not just to lose her son but to watch him suffer outside the gate the reproach persecution everything that she went through I mean can you imagine having anybody at your funeral that was rejoicing that they were dead I mean it's no respectful funeral no respectful time of death there's a tragedy to Mary and yet to the world it was a time of celebration she watched her son suffer and not be able to do anything about it I can see the devil taking advantage of the situation and through every unworthy thought into her mind I'm sure the devil must have told her that she did something wrong somehow in raising her son to cause this end of tragedy in her life I know we're going somewhere this is not a normal but I just want you to go with me I wonder Satan reminded her at that time when she went a day's journey without noticing that Jesus was even with the family one time when we went to funeral what our one daughter wasn't with us and we didn't realize she was not with us until we were driving away from the funeral home going to a house and it was rosemary most of you have heard the story and we had thought that well somebody must Alice got her cuz she's not with us well nobody else got her she was left at the funeral home and all locked up so we had to go back and get her but I can relate to you know even the Bible says a mother can forget her suckling child but God can never forget his children amen praise the Lord Luke chapter 2 verse 41 now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover and when he was twelve years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as the return to the Child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of a twelve years old and did not know where he was at I want to say we could be doing the will of God because they were he went up there for the Passover we could be doing the will of God and never realized that Jesus isn't with us but supposing him to have been with the company went a day's journey and they sought him among their kinfolks and their acquaintance don't assume that Jews that Jesus is always following you he's supposed to be leading and guiding you don't assume you're gonna go do your your thing in it he's just gonna be following somewhere behind in the company of your of your friends or family he has a purpose he has a will amen we follow him amen and when they followed and when they found him not they turned back to Jerusalem seeking Him that's a great thing to do when you realize that Jesus just as an in your situation it's time to turn back and and start seeking Him again and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors and not and both hearing them and asking them questions if you want to find Jesus you got to come where the Word of God is at they found him in the temple amen because he is the word of God amen and they came and they were seeking the truth they're asking questions this is what church is all about it's what the Word of God is all about Psalms 27 verse 2 read it with me Psalms 27 verse 2 when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat at my flesh they stumbled and fell though a hole should a camp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise up against me in this will I be confident one thing if I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple we go there to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire how can I be more like you Jesus how can I live the life that you want me to live show me open my eyes I had a minister call me and he had been it's tell me some of the things that he had been you know ministering on and trying to show the people just how to get ready for the rapture and it just made this little simple statement to him I said if people don't really have a clear vision a clear understanding of who Jesus is they will never know what they're to become this way if the people in the world they look at Jesus as some Daniel grandpa or some Santy Claus as brother branham put it then they view that's all that we need to be but if they realize properly who he is then she'll know properly who she is and that's why we need to see Jesus clearly so we know who who to become and we go to the house of the Lord to find out where we're really out with God and most of the time we're not advanced we're not advanced you know it isn't like you know you know in class in school you know there were some teachers that were in advanced classes you know they they they kind of knew more than the teachers and what you're not going to go to to to church and be more advanced than God you know I'm saying you're just not gonna do that so we go there with the humble humble spirit a humble attitude amen back to Luke chapter 2 verse 47 and all that heard with were astonished at his understanding and answers and when you come to church I'll tell you the word of God's got a word and answer for you it should establish you if you got the right spirit and the right attitude and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why has thou doubt with us why isn't thou thus dealt with us behold a father and thy mother have sought thee sorrowing do you ever try to do something for the kingdom of God and somebody else gets offended because that's what Jesus was doing he was doing he was about his father's business but somebody was getting offended and that's gonna happen you tried to do something for the Lord and they're gonna feel second and there you're gonna you're gonna offend something it's just part of life and and when Jesus and he Jesus said unto them how is it that you saw me she not that I must be about my father's business and look at verse forty fifty and they understood not that the sane which he spake unto them I can imagine many experiences in in Mary's past life just rushing to her mind and the devil taking advantage of her lack of understanding now trying to stir up thoughts that to make her feel that she was maybe disrespected as a mother at times er or dishonored and and the devil just trying to twist things up make her feel not much like a mother like a failure I can see Satan taking advantage of the situation and bringing all kinds of negative thoughts to her mind you can see the devil reminding her of the time that one of the sisters in the church was trying to encourage Mary and reminding her how blessed she was and then Jesus spoke up some words and just took the attention right away from her it's in Luke chapter 11 verse 27 I wonder if the devil was beating her up and making her feel so bad and so unworthy what torment and when it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted her voice and said unto Him blessed is the woman that bear thee and the paps that now has such and he said ëi rather blessed are they that hear the word of God II keep it I can imagine the devil playing with her mind it's a mother a human mother feeling disrespected at times I wonder how many times Mary must have been persecuted for having Jesus without being married it was well-known among the religious people of that day they referred to Jesus as born of fornication it's what the scripture says can you imagine all her life now she had her her she and Elizabeth she had her mom too she had those on her inner circle that really knew the truth okay but then there's all those other people where the devil is able to get in their mind and begin to think things and say things that they had really no revelation of and then Mary hearing about here the backbiting hearing things that were spoken I can see at this this time the devil was just tormenting her at the foot of the cross with just so many things rushing to her and here these people after mocking Jesus looking at Mary said there's your your son that look what it came of him guess God really wasn't with him yeah I could see the devil hammering her over and over the religious people wagging there hasn't not only at Jesus but at her because she was the mother of Jesus it wasn't a beautiful Mother's Day for her Mary bore such a reproach as money looked up looked upon her in shame and disapproval of of her son thinking about all the things that Jesus said that she didn't quite understand when he said him when they were walking when he walked and he tried to teach it he just had different ways I mean the Bible teaches us that no man knows the things of God save the the Spirit of God that's in man and worker or part natural or part spiritual and there are so many things that that Mary honestly didn't understand I mean her whole thing it wasn't from the beginning doesn't very beginning didn't understand the ponder of the things in her heart what an awful time it must have been an awful time of separation for Mary there was so much division among the people the majority of the people were so relieved that Jesus was dying and yet her Mary was crying for her son as she suffers I wonder if this was the hour that the devil reminded her of her son's own words in Luke chapter 12 verse 51 suppose she that I come to give peace on earth I tell you nay but rather division for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against the two and two against the three the father shall be divided against the Son and the son against the father and the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother and the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law I can see the devil telling her that this was happening was the result of the type of attitude that her son projected in his teaching that he was just getting the result of certain things that he spoke that they did not know what he meant when he spoke him sure the devil was telling her that she was a failure as a mother that she didn't do things or say things or act the right way that she should have at the time and because of that she couldn't have stood she could have stopped the situation if she would have made different choices the devil was just pounding her head now there's no time to make it out to talk about those ways because the devil was making her feel so bad I hardly know a death that somebody has where the devil don't come by and blame that person that they could have changed it I'll remember that remember the day that my brother died is clear as anything I remember his anger was just so high the anger drove him to do something that he should have done and I remember whereas he sat in the car the door was open not was kneeling in the dirt and I was pleading for him to stop - don't go away like this no it wasn't a pretty scene it wasn't beautiful at all and I just remember spending time with my dad afterwards the devil beaten him up over the head beat me up over the head the devil likes to take advantage of a situation that is out of our control and so often he takes and he wants to torment us and and make us feel so bad so hopeless it wasn't a pretty Mother's Day for Mary the devil taken advantage in our opening Scripture and when Jesus therefore saw his mother and his disciples standing by excuse me whom he loved I love that he saw his disciple he saw Mary of course there was other Mary's but he was focusing on his mother and he loved them here he was suffering Harry was dying here he was with a greater purpose set to follow to bring salvation to pay the price to bring salvation to every lost soul and yet the natural park was looking at the suffering of his mother the suffering of his son and he gave expensive instructions what to do from the cross he didn't say hey look I got things going so racket in my life you just figured out yourself you know a lot of times people are just clueless how to help anybody when it becomes a difficult situation but he said to his mother woman behold thy son don't don't look here anymore you know the scripture says we know Jesus we knew Jesus as the flesh but we don't know Jesus anymore after the flesh but we know him as God amen as the spirit of the Living God then say if he to his disciple behold thy mother you've got a responsibility we spoke on that just a little bit and from that hour mm-hmm the disciple took her into his own home in the midst of Jesus suffering he took the necessary time and the leadership to help his mother and to help his disciple I just believe that is beautiful but what a horrible time for this mother and the devil tormenting their mind with so many thoughts what did she do she went back to the beginning what would you do what do you do bride of Jesus Christ when the devil is tormenting you or your son you mothers and your son looks at you wish he wasn't part of the family said things he shouldn't have said acted in certain ways that he should acted you feel about this big you go back to the beginning that's right to the time that you suffer for him you gave birth you how are you saying and you remember the time says he appreciated you helping him get dressed get fed the clothes on with the homework and fix the fix and make away like we read in that that paper at the beginning you go back to the beginning all the set marries I believe she went back to the beginning turn with me if you would to Luke chapter one read it with me she went back to her original calling from being a mother Luke chapter 1 verse 28 in d angel came in unto her and said hail not highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women hey man it didn't matter what the crowd was saying and when she saw him she was troubled at the saying she cast heard my what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not for thou has found favor with God praise the Lord she found favor with God she was highly favored of the Lord she was blessed among all the women it really didn't matter what she went through because she had a revelation of who she was amen praise the Lord she didn't know everything she was in the flesh and she said in verse 34 she talked to the angel said how shall this be seen I know not a man I've never had a relationship with a man and the angel said I'm said answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost she'll come up on D brother John how do I help this situation that I'm in the Holy Ghost she'll come upon you stop looking to yourself for answers for problems look to the Holy Ghost he's got the answer he's got it worked out the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she's also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with God nothing shall be impossible to notice that God was interested in stirring faith now he could have just gave that faith to Mary that ain't the way God works he wants you to seek after him he is a rewarder to them that diligently seek Him we come and we hear the word of God it should give us faith to believe for the impossible hey man can't expect God just to hand it to you do nothing so he reminded her of Elizabeth who was called barren in her own age and got a son probably reminded her of Abraham amen nothing is impossible with God praise God and look what Mary said and verse 38 her faith rose to the place where she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word hey men you that the job of the angel was done God was done with the message and when you're done hearing the message it's done it's up to you now to take a hold of that word and march forward with it and say be it unto me Lord according to that word let it be done that may be the Christian you want me to be let me be the bride of that you called me to be praise the Lord I'll tell you Saints when when the devil is tormenting you sometimes we just have to go to the foundation of when God called us to the very beginning when God first called your heart to be the birthplace of His Son Jesus Christ just like Mary and he told you you were highly favored of the Lord Amen that you were chosen by God Amen that you are blessed among Christians a man that you were elected from the foundation of the world that's where you go back when Saint begins to work on you and begins to try to twist you and take you down bunny trails and say that your situation is unconceivable it is unmanageable is unworkable it looks hopeless you go back to the beginning where God calls you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the very end and it won't be always easy Saints but he's with us yes God so loved the world but he chose us he called the whole world he died for the whole world but you know the world didn't respond to him John 1 verse 11 he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will man son of God think about it God chose to bring light into your life and then the gospel into you to bring you out of darkness into his marvelous like you've been chosen you were once aliens from God separated from God without God having no hope but God brought you out of darkness and he made you the children of light we've been chosen of the Lord highly favored today Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 6 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God have chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you he chose you God knew God knew when he called Mary at the beginning before the Holy Ghost overshadowed her God knew there was something in Mary that would be able to stand the test and go through what she had to at Calvary to go through the hardships to go through all the times of misunderstandings and not knowing why her son or children do the things that they do there was something inside of Mary she had character Psalms 91 verse 14 because he have set his love upon me therefore well I deliver him you want God to deliver you from your situation set your love upon him he's already proved he set his love upon you he's already chosen you he's already proved it something in your heart says Amen is too I feel it now such your love upon him and he will deliver you Amen we all need deliverance or something in our life that we need to be delivered from and when God delivers us from that there'll be something more than God wants to deliver us from because God is calling us to be a bride without spot without Waco praise the Lord he's chosen us because he loved us he chose us because he saw there was a seed of him lying inside of us he chose us because he saw a seed hidden in us Romans chapter 9 verse 29 and as Isaiah said before except the lord of sabbath had left us a seed we had been a Sodom and had been like unto Gomorrha think about that for a moment if there not been the seed of God inside of us we wouldn't be here in church today we would be out playing golf or doing something not thinking about God we'd still be aliens from God we'd still be hopeless without God but you know there was a seed inside of you and then and because that sees there it's gonna come forth amen praise God we're gonna be the birth place of the manifestation of Jesus Christ in her life we are miss Jesus hallelujah God is taking a bride out of the Gentiles for his name's sake think about it for his namesake what does that mean that means that she is taking the name of Jesus now tell you you just can't take it on your own he's got to give it to you it starts out by taking the name of Jesus Christ in Baptism amen it's taking the the you no longer take his name in vain Amen but you begin to honor it you worship it you praise it you do everything that you do in the name of Jesus Christ you pray over your food in that name your whole life you dedicate things to God in that name that name becomes your you're identified with that name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and someday every knee will bow every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of lords and King of Kings the Bible says that he gave him a name above every name that seed of God that sin you came from God it's a seed of God and every seed must bring forth of its own kind one just a couple of couraging scriptures along this line for you to remember that see that's inside of you Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 most everyone knows this for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord their thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen there's an expectant end I'm telling you it wasn't pretty what Mary had to go through but there is such a reward waiting for her on the other side she was still blessed of the Lord to think of all the women what woman could go through what she went through what woman could stand there and say that's my son I love him I love him he's never done any wrong I may not understand I'm an thoughts going in my mind but that's still my son I love him praise the Lord Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 being confident of this very thing and then that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ praise the Lord this is God in sea formed you are God in sea form be confident it will be manifest in everything that God is you will be a mint because it can't lie the seat of God can't lie well brother Johnny certainly don't feel that what you know I understand that this is what we do with that we don't let the devil take it and make us feel so rotten that we don't feel like trying or that we don't believe it we don't take it over here and say yeah I'm see you done predestined I'm gonna I'm gonna bring forth the manifestation out and no matter what you do brother sister it is right in the middle of the road sure the devil's will attack you make you feel bad that's his job that's what this is this is about that's why we're talking like this but it's our job to go back to the beginning to pay attention to what we are and to press forth into that mark t'k to come to the statue of a perfect man that's what God's called us to be now when we think about that seed the seed of God the Bible says that God is love and then so when we think about God we think about a God that is not just loving but he Islam a man he is the definition of love his seed is also love he didn't pull love out of his seed and say oh yeah you you just you don't have to act like your loving you could just a kid and the other way no no it's a you can't separate love from God the bride is full of compassion she's laying down her life for others the same kind of agape love not only capable of loving his enemies but it produces it you know if we don't want to say well I'm capable loving my enemy but then you're gonna pick and choose when you're gonna do it it should be an automatic thing with God there's no respecter persons with his seed there's no respecter persons he that his seed loves without dissimulation we just talked about this seed of love is maturing with Christ amen this love of God thinks no evil it speaks no evil it does no evil it does no ill to his neighbor Amen it is the love of God shut up in the hearts of his bride by the Holy Ghost she's highly favored to bring forth the love of God who praise God Mary was so full of courage and inner strength to weather the storm and to stand the test she had character as I was with Moses so shall I be with you as I was with Mary so shall I be with you bride amen she will have the same characteristics that her husband has courage virtue to face the mocking the reproach the persecutions the back by thee whatever you're going through it can and the test amen love bears all things endures all things amen it believes all things it blesses and it doesn't curse on again si bless and curse not she's a peacemaker hallelujah just like her husband Jesus was a peacemaker yes he yes he was a peacemaker I know somebody is thinking I remember a time he wasn't I remember how things he spoke yes he turned the money changers tables over he got the whip out now he's allowed to do that because he's God vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord I will repay God is the one that straightens things out and he has a fivefold ministry that beareth not the sword in vain the Bible says for he is a minister of God a revenger to execute the wrath upon them that doeth evil but the life that Jesus lived in the way that he conducted himself just like the fivefold ministry is in peace for peace nabob Oh tells us is a fruit of the Holy Ghost Jesus was a peacemaker at times he could judge everyone he was still a peacemaker when it came to politics he said give two Caesars with Caesars gift it to God what's God's in other words in the natural you go pay your taxes in the spiritual you get your ties when it comes to sin there's a woman caught in the very act of adultery he could have judged them but he brought peace to the whole situation and he did it with such wisdom he didn't start accusing everybody of all the sins that they did yeah we it's very possible he wrote him in the sands but you know what he didn't go blab him out so everybody else to hear he had respect he handled everything decently in an order and he was left just with the woman that was caught in the very sim he says where's your accusers where are those that run into stone you and kill you just now just like a lot of people do with their mouths he said they're all gone why are they gone because Jesus stepped in he produced peace where there was no peace and Jesus just said I don't condemn you either you go and sin no more start walking in the right direction Amen now he brought peace even amongst believers remember his disciples they were fighting about who was better who was the greater who had more authority who was gonna sit closer to God in heaven and expressing that they would never do something he'll to the Lord they would never cross him when we've all crossed him Luke chapter 22 verse 25 hope you're getting something out of this and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles they exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors benefactors and ye shall not and ye shall not be sold but he that is greatest among you let him be like the younger and he that his chief is he does serve and I looked at that word benefactors and it means a feed lamp pitous feel and purchase and this is where we need brother Marty brother Marty also if you were here I would be giving you my tie it is just too long for me but that word means a philanthropist means a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others especially by the generosity a generous donation of money to good causes so we're in a benefactor he wants to do good and Jesus says we're not gonna we're not going to be like them that exercised authority in that measure you know like well we're just gonna have a little get-together and we're gonna have a thousand dollar plate if you want to come to this dinner we're going to promote this politician we're gonna do this thing we're not gonna you know look at this situation is just I'm going to throw a lot of money at this situation and because I threw this much money I'm kind of like they had honcho those are our benefactors and Jesus was telling he disciples that's how the gentiles exercise authority over one another and what we might call a good way in life human humanity he says but in our kingdom it's not going to be like that e you don't have to have money I love that song love that song the end sang didn't say nothing about her but I appreciate her bringing that song it's definitely the Lord felt the presence of the Lord but whatever God gave you whatever you are you've got the ability to serve just as much as any other human being on the planet it's just a willingness to be great in God's kingdom lay down your life for all it's all about laying down your life to help someone praise God Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace and he knows how to make peace the Bible says he is our peace and he has broken down the middle wall of perdition in other words he knows how to break down walls of debt divide people and he said peace I leave with you not as the world not as the world peace he gives us peace he leaves but not as the way the world has peace no it's different and now the bride of Jesus Christ possesses that same peace their peacemakers they know how to make peace when peace doesn't exist and Jesus said in the Beatitudes Matthew 5 verse 9 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God amen so sorry chapter 5 verse number 9 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God Ramachari god no matter no matter what I'm a child of God I'll fight to the veteran you know there's been many wars fought over religion anything else so many people have died over religion about believing in something and will fight to the better end with somebody proving that we're a child of God but God will identify you as a child of God when you're a peacemaker it's by all men shall know you're my disciple when you have a love that's one for another it's not us testifying who we are it's God inside of us justifying who we are that's why I said search the Scriptures you'll know it's why we come to church to find out we're not because we just listen to the devil all through the course of the day we think or something lord help me most people don't know how to bring peace into a situation of termina I'm just speaking the truth right now they have human peace and they have human love but we know it's not enough they end up getting upset and angry they fail in attempting to bring real peace I want to say number one piece is generated from a heart of peace we must possess peace in order to be able to make it to be a peacemaker to generate it you've got to have something to start with and nothing less than peace of God will do it peace is simply a fruit of the Spirit it is a fruit of God it is you cannot separate peace from God it's a part of him now what is peace for is peace just for you or is it for your family well then you need to know how to make peace in your family it's peace just for your family or for your neighbors what you need to know how to make peace among your neighbors is peace just for you and your neighbors or is it for those you're trying to bring to Christ the ability to be a peacemaker second making peace is completely and entirely sacrificial if you want to be a peacemaker you've got to be completely and entirely sacrificial it's all about laying down your life if you have failed time and time over and over in your life of trying to bring peace to a situation to a family member to something and things aren't working you need to look at it in a way of laying down your life it's sacrificial it's not about being right a person must sacrifice their know-it-all attitude there I know that I'm right there are self righteous indignation to straighten something up and be left with a spirit of I'm here to help you I want to lay down my life to help you a peacemaker has more to do with the right spirit than a right doctrine galatians chapter 6 verse 1 tells us brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault nor will we we know that we see that everyday problems people with with problems and and and in certain certain people who have repetitious the same problem over and over and if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual notice spiritual not he's right if you're spiritual you will be right ye which are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit oh my my a spirit of meekness not about how wrong the other person is I hope you're listening I hope you're just not saying Amen I agree but I hope you take this word and you begin to apply it to your life if you want to be a peacemaker you're gonna have to learn to do this a spirit of meekness considering thyself the same thing can happen to you and I'll tell you if you just think about it the things that you've judged other people have probably already come upon you since then first to bear ye one another's burden and so fulfill the law crisis if you want to to be a peacemaker bear your brothers burden amen true peace is generated from a heart of peace and true love true peace comes from true love a a natural humanistic peace a worldly peace like there'll be peace between us as long as you do what I tell you to do is generated from a heart of human love and it has its limits Amen whirly peace is generated from a heart of worldly love which we know has this limits it it can't suffer very long it vaunteth itself it's all puffed up it doesn't bear hardly anything it doesn't endure hardly anything it's before long it'll blow up its top and you'll see really what's behind it just a selfish self-righteous mold of that thinks it's right even the Bible talks about they that correct their children fathers Paul was talking about in Hebrews in chapter 12 that their fathers would correct their children for a season out of their own pleasure just to get pleasure on it notice they're so mad and what their kids did to them that they're gonna punish them they're gonna prove to them but when God does it it's wrong good yeah amen and I'll tell you if you want to you want to be like your your groom you want to be like your heavenly father you want to be like God you want to be Jesus seed of God is a peacemaker man those are the ones they're gonna be called the children of God the bride is a peacemaker just like her husband hey man hallelujah she can handle the problems hey man death doesn't separate problems doesn't stop her she's got the goods and if she doesn't got the goods she doesn't have an I don't care attitude amen she spends more time to let that seed of God your brother Graham says we need to lay in the presence of the Sun and write out and let the seed life of God come forth you'll have it it's inside of you but we gotta just get away with this this outside put it on this outside picture of a Christian and be a Christian from the inside yeah be a real bride of Jesus Christ from the inside out you know come out you'll have an opportunity you need a fake it hey men Romans chapter ages we're closing here Oh soon not with this first we have one more one more short one after this but it's encouraging it's encouraging you know how I can't stop us Saints the seeds have to come forth Romans chapter 8 verse 35 who can separate us from the love of Christ all right who's gonna separate us you put Christ in the middle of your relationship nothing's gonna separate it you put Christ in the middle of your problem that you got that nobody knows about nothing's gonna separate you from Christ shall tribulation show distress shall persecution famine nakedness peril or this watching my son died at Calvary be mocked at not many people looked at what Mary had to go through in this light as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter yeah that's gonna happen that's the life that we go through on a daily basis but nay and all these things were not moved we're more than conquerors pursue him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death hallelujah death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord nothing nothing shall separate us we need to have that spirit I'll tell you the beautiful thing I loved about Jesus he must needs go by Samaria there was a woman that was just so caught up in the things of the world but you know that's there was a seed in there and then there was a seed of God in there that had to come far and if he didn't go there and and and and and bring the life of the gospel the Holy Spirit over that seed it would never come far just like the woman taught the dog free just like the people you talk to every day there's people out there that need Jesus Christ you can't let some sort of things separate you from having a relationship they'll bring them to Jesus Christ and bring them to the new birth you're ambassadors for Jesus Christ it's a purpose in all this I'll tell you when the doubts are flying the battles are raging and peace and love seem to be just an illusion and imagination so far away go back to the beginning or God first spoke to you spoke to your heart called you to bring forth his son inside of you to manifest Jesus Christ once again to this world the Bible says that the Word of God will not return void his seed will bring forth of its kind amen we're gonna close with this verse now Hebrews chapter 13 verse number 5 we quoted it in the middle of the sermon amen amen by inspiration praise God let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he have said I will never leave thee nor for safety you know what you're not getting everything you want but if you get that everything's gonna be okay so that we can we may boldly say we can boldly say this now the Lord is my helper amen the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me praise the Lord let your life birth not just the kind of life that helps with temporal things but let your life birth eternal life Jesus Christ once again living for others Amen let's stand together for we are the seed of the Most High God highly favored of the Lord praise the Lord amen let's sing that little course emmanuel email it's just worship the Lord right
