I will love you Lord and I lift my voice to worship you oh my soul rejoice take joy thy king in what you May it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ears. Amen. Let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, may when you look down upon our hearts at this moment that you be pleased. May the thoughts of our heart be a sweet sound in your ears. &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's anything inside of us, &gt;&gt; Lord, that would separate us from a perfect communion with you, we ask that you would cleanse us at this very moment. &gt;&gt; That you would wash us of those things. &gt;&gt; For Lord, it's our heart's desire to go deeper in in with you, Lord, &gt;&gt; through the message today. Lord, we want to personally hear your voice speak to our heart. And Lord, we want you to build your church in us a little bit more. We want to come up a little bit higher. We want to uh dig a little deeper. We want to fall in love with you a little bit more. &gt;&gt; May nothing hinder that today, Lord. So, we're trusting in the blood of Calvary today. And Lord, may you prepare our hearts now. May the anointing of your spirit be Lord upon our ears, the ears of our heart and upon uh these unworthy lips, Lord, as they speak, Lord, we trust not our thoughts. Lord, we don't want our thoughts. We don't want our pins, our minds, but Lord, you we pray that you'd help us to get out of the way, Lord, that you may uh speak through uh this unworthy vessel, the thoughts of God, the mind of God to your people, Lord, that the connection may be made and Lord, that the word would get across and that your people would be strengthened, Father, that they would leave here fortified and uh putting into practice, Lord, the things that you've spoken today. And Father, we will give you the praise and honor not only now in advance, Lord, not only after the service, but Lord, we're going to remember we're going to remember the word, Lord, that you've given us this week, Lord. And we're going to praise you for it this week. In the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we commit the furtherance of this service into your hands now for your honor and glory. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And turn with me if you would to the book of Hebrews, chapter 10. Amen. Amen. Just looking around. Is our sister Donna here or No, she didn't make it. Okay. I know it was her heart's desire to make it and um we we believe she's with us online. Um and we want to continue to pray for our sister. Amen. Amen. I would like us here uh today to imagine that you are the only person in the church and God is speaking directly to you &gt;&gt; because that's how this service is for. I believe it's to call everyone of us a little bit higher and give us a greater victory. We want to uh speak on uh speaking our confession. speaking our confession and just we want to learn to deal with fear a little bit better. So let's just have that in mind as we read here in Hebrews chapter 10 verse starting with verse number 19. Having therefore, brethren, boldness, to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having a high priest over us, the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. &gt;&gt; And let us consider one another. In other words, let's care about one another &gt;&gt; to provoke um unto love and to good works, &gt;&gt; not forsaking going to church as the manner of some is, but exhorting those and so much the more as we see the day approaching. God bless you. You may be seated today. We want to talk here about everybody um has a faith and and assurance but I like how the scripture tells us here let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith and I feel feel there's like always room to get full to get a little bit more faith to get a little bit more assurance and uh there's a way I believe to get there um and I we we can't really draw nigh to God when there's fear in our life. &gt;&gt; And we need to draw near with full assurance of faith. The Bible says, "For without faith, it's impossible to please him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we need to uh we need to deal with fear. &gt;&gt; A lot of people don't deal with fear. They just kind of leave it in their life, kind of uh ignore it. But we need need to deal with it. God is not attracted to our doubts and our fears. &gt;&gt; So, we must learn to exercise and to build confidence to to to exercise and build assurance. There's things that we can do that they're not gifts. They're not gifts. So, we got to build and we're living in perilous times. We know that the Bible tells us that God is shaking heaven and earth. and everything that's been uh holding on to God through emotion or through feelings or just through human intellect is being shaken off now. We're seeing people they're just leaving &gt;&gt; and and and only that which is held on by revelation is going to stay. &gt;&gt; And and this is why church needs to be serious to us. The word of God needs to be serious to us. our relationship uh with God needs to be more serious. Now, we've all felt fear before &gt;&gt; and we've all had to deal with fear at one time or another. I would venture to say that many people who are listening harbor fear, actually harbor fear inside. Fear often cripples people right in their tracks. It freezes them unexpectedly. and its message that it sends. It startles you when it first appears and it leaves you in a state of panic. Fear's intention is always to manipulate you. Whether it's a thought in your head or the devil's using another human being, &gt;&gt; but fear's intention is always to manipulate you. And it opens the door for waves of negative thoughts to rush in all at one time. And it it causes confusion in our minds, building anxiety, leaving us with we don't know what to do with the situation. And and having no confidence or no peace about what to do. And this is what fear is. And I don't care what you know what we're talking about. That is pretty much what fear is. &gt;&gt; Fear is a horrible thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it shows up, it manipulates us and it keeps us from doing what we would rather be doing. It just kind of it it goes in there and it says, "I don't care about your free more agency. I'm going to just take control." &gt;&gt; That's really what's going on. We know that fear is 100% completely of the devil. That's right. &gt;&gt; Satan is the master manipulator and he knows how to get people to do things unlawfully. In other words, the devil can't come to you and say, "Hey, I'm the devil. I I this is the wrong thing that I'm telling you. Uh would you would you want to consider it?" You don't do that. &gt;&gt; When fear comes, you feel off guard. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a there's a scare. there's a what do I do and and you got to make a decision quick and that I think this this subject if we can really dive into it be honest with ourselves it can really really help us Satan knows how to accomplish things outside of using our free moral agency he knows how to bypass that thing and get us to do things that we don't want to do and if you think about it those of you that have children at an early age. Your children learn how to do things to manipulate you. &gt;&gt; Fear is real. John said fear has the substance of torment. Fear has a substance of torment. So when we get scared, we get afraid, we know there's a a a a torment there. So God in God does not torment. &gt;&gt; Torment comes from the devil. &gt;&gt; And torment is simply when you torture someone's mind. &gt;&gt; So if the devil ever uses you to torment your your spouse, understand what you're doing. You're tormenting their mind. So, we've been we've touched on these things before that some human beings are so infected by fear themselves that they have the same mindset the devils have and they use manipulation on other people. They bring a fear there to get them to do what they want them to do. And it's unlawful. And um you know we hate when we're when fear comes to us, right? We hate it. We don't want to deal with it. But sometimes we end up using it on others. You know, a little threat, a little this, a little that. &gt;&gt; Yes. And so we understand that when we use it, it just is it's actually worse than when it attacks us. But we want to take a look at fear. We got to we want to realize it's not as big as the devil makes it. &gt;&gt; Fear is truly a horrible disease that has infected countless of minds around the world. And people use fear to manipulate their spouses, their bosses, their family members, their so-called friends. I mean even nation nation manipulating other nations. We can say with confidence that fear is power without character. &gt;&gt; In Luke 21:16 Jesus said, "And ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends. And some of you shall they cause to be put to death, and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake. It it's that's not enough to make a man uh to to reconsider about being sold out to Christ. I mean, if you're going to give your heart to Christ, this is what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; You're going to be alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't expect your whole family to be on board with you. Dropping down to verse 26. And men's hearts failing them for what? Fear. Fear is a very powerful thing &gt;&gt; for looking after those things which are coming upon the earth. For the powers of heaven shall be shaken and and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When you see these things come to pass, look up. and lift up your heads for your redemption drawth nigh. In verse 35 says, for as a snare shall this fear come on all them that dwell upon the face of the whole earth. I think it's a I think it's a good thing this morning that we could take a look at fear as in a globe. You know what I mean? like not like wow I can't deal with it but in a globe that I can see it and and I can conquer this and and this cannot have its dominion over me &gt;&gt; now through manipulation of the devil the world has been taught to accept fear in their lives and they have this they they there's a common theme I would probably say in every in every town of every city of every state of this nation and that would be well I can't do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; That's how fear is presented to us. You're stuck. You can't do nothing about this situation. Most people do not face fear headon. They don't call it out. They don't stand against it. but rather they are succumbed by it. They end up being reactive by its manipulation. Instead of taking control and and creating a better outcome through a confidence um or or being prepared or proactive against repeat offenders, they fail to resist the pressure and they end up yielding to a superior force, an overpowering appeal or a destructive influence. And that is what the devil is. giving way to the pressure that they can no longer resist and they end up surrendering against their own will. And this is how powerful fear is and this is how evil fear is. I think one of the hardest things to do is to face fear with a right spirit. Because most people who who get fed up about it, you know, they come back with a with a wrong spirit against it. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; And and you you don't want to face fear with a with fear. &gt;&gt; You want to face fear at God. &gt;&gt; Amen. with with a right spirit to be able to look fear right in the face and just say, "I am not going to be moved by you. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're presenting. I'm standing on the word of God. &gt;&gt; There's many examples in the Bible. The three Hebrew childrens, they faced uh a fearful situation. and Daniel in the lion's den. Elijah when he faced those 450 prophets, you you saw them all stand there in the face of fear and said, "I will not be moved." But you take Elijah after that happened, he ran away from one woman, Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so fear can attack anybody. &gt;&gt; It's something that we deal with. And you notice when Elijah stood on the word of God, hearing God's voice, he was able to stand against 400 religious prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he didn't hear from God or didn't yield to God concerning this wicked Jezebel, he got scared. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God wants us to be able to stand no matter what the devil does to us. A young Christian named Timothy, he dealt with fear. He feared being persecuted, afflicted, and being left alone as a Christian. Anybody ever dealt with feeling left alone as a Christian? Yes. &gt;&gt; For standing in what he believed in. He didn't want to end up like like Paul did in prison. Basically, Paul was in prison and he says, "You know what? I don't know if I want to go through this. I think I'm going to find maybe another church. You know, where it's a little bit easier." And a lot of times the reason people are succumb to fear is that they don't want to feel alone. Truly, &gt;&gt; you don't want to stand up against something because you know you're not going to be liked by that person that you're standing up against. &gt;&gt; Personally, I'd rather be alone with God than to be together with others that that fear the Lord &gt;&gt; or or that that others that that that continually fear. And I I'm sorry. Let me just say that one more time. I'd rather stand alone with God, be alone with God, than to be with others who operate through a spirit of fear. because I don't I don't need I don't really need anybody to make it. &gt;&gt; I don't need to be friends with anybody to make it. &gt;&gt; But I do need to be a friend with Jesus. &gt;&gt; I got to have that. Amen. &gt;&gt; David said in Psalms 84:10, "For a day in thy courts is better than three years without being in church." Now, that's exactly what that is saying. For a day in in God's house is better than a thousand not being in God's house. Think about that. That's how important it is to be in church. And I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 15:16 says, "Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasures with trouble therewith." And in verse 17, better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. &gt;&gt; So you see, I'd rather be alone with God and have nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That have everything that I could possibly want. &gt;&gt; Did you know that the disciples actually feared being alone? And Jesus told him, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." So Jesus is dealing with it and he uses this word let. In other words, they had a choice. We have a choice about fear. &gt;&gt; Always remember fear is a choice that we make alone. &gt;&gt; A lot of times the devil leaves us with, well, you know, what was I gonna do? What can I do? This is the way it is. No, you you made the wrong choice. You got to stand up against fear. We cannot blame anyone for the choice that we make to feel fear. That's all on us. &gt;&gt; Now, the devil will try and influence us, but the choice is never made for us. &gt;&gt; We make the choice. Now we may become startled but we are never forced to fear anything. Jesus said let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid. Let means not prevent or forbid. So Jesus is saying um forbid it for forbid your heart to be troubled for forbid your heart to be afraid. Take a stand against it. Don't wait for circumstances to have to be perfect for you to say, "Okay, yeah, you know what? I don't fear." No. Look fear in the face and say, "No, I'm not going to be moved by you." &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus is telling us that you're in the driver's seat. You're in complete control of how you're going to feel about this situation. Now there's two things that's going to happen. There's always two things that are going on. One is the situation that's being presented to you. Like you may absolutely hate it, may be absolutely evil. It shouldn't be happening. And we can say amen to that and you may not have control of that, but you have control of how you're going to be affected by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you can protect yourself, fear will not have dominion over you. &gt;&gt; And you can't have fear and peace at the same time. &gt;&gt; So if you want peace, you got to learn to deal with fear. Fear is something we must overcome. Revelations 21:7 says, "He that overthmeth shall inherit all things." And if you could put this up on the board, I don't know if it's there. Uh, Revelation 21:7, he that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. Now look at verse eight. But the fearful and the unbelieving, they end up in the same place. So fear to be fearful is a is just as bad as being unbelieving. It's the abominable murders, hormongers, sorcerers, idolattors, liars shall have their part in the lake of fire which burnth fire and brimstone which is the second death. So I'm just saying, you know, to be, you know, fearful is a terrible thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you got to face it. You say, I'm not going to be fearful. I'm not going to be unbelieving. Just like you would say, I'm not going to be a murderer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be a liar. I'm also not going to be fearful. When you look at Joshua, fear attacked Joshua when they first spied out the promised land with 108 uh 1.8 million uh of his congregation said, "We're not able to take this giant problem out of our life. We're not able to deal with it. We're not only grasshoppers in our sight, but we're also grasshoppers in their sight. He was left alone with Moses and Caleb and the younger ones who really weren't even able to vote basically. So, he's left alone facing fear. So, Joshua dealt with fear. He didn't have the majority of the congregation with him. He's still alone. It'd be like me standing up here and everybody said &gt;&gt; and sometimes we're afraid to face one person. &gt;&gt; That's how come easy we get succumbed by fear. &gt;&gt; Joshua had to deal with fear 40 years later. And this is how we deal with fear. Joshua chapter 1, God said, "As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee. I will not forsake thee." He said, "Be of good courage and uh be strong and be of good courage. Only be thou strong and and very courageous." And in verse 9, "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and and of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with you whethersoever thou goest." So when a situation happens in your life and oh did you hear about this God is with me wherever I go &gt;&gt; you don't forget that when fear pops up when fear pops up that's the time you need to be courageous there's a time you need to be strong it it's a time to stand there and say I'm facing fear and I will not be moved &gt;&gt; I don't care what age we are we deal with fear Even children are afraid that they're not going to get their own will. &gt;&gt; And you you think of of a child, it wants something so bad that if it doesn't get it, what does it usually do? What? Throws a fit. It It cries. It It It whines. It says it it gets angry. It It goes off in the bedroom. It it it it it feels like it can't handle the situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it can't accept that I'm going to be without this thing that I'm wanting so much. So fear is all around us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is our job as parents to teach our children to fear not. &gt;&gt; That God is with us in our home. &gt;&gt; That there's nothing to be afraid about, but we have to deal with it. We deal with fear the way that God tells us to deal with fear. And that's the way the word instructs us to deal with fear. And the Bible says that the scriptures are given by the inspiration of God and are profitable for instruction and how to deal with fear. That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. God does not want us to be stunned or paralyzed with fear &gt;&gt; because fear is nothing more than a lie from the pit of hell. And what I mean by that is we take this this man, this great man. and I don't don't know his name, but they just shot him. And of course, when it happened, you know, fear just kind of struck and it and it was a terrible thing. And we can't deny the situation, but the devil wants to take that situation and say something worse. You you understand what I'm saying? So, I'm trying to separate the the real actual problem and what the devil's trying to make about it. &gt;&gt; Fear is nothing but a lie from the pit of hell. &gt;&gt; So, we don't have to be afraid. It isn't like God coming to tell us to get, you know, tormented. It's the devil that's trying to scare us and manipulate us. So God wants us to stand up to fear and say, "Get behind me, Satan. &gt;&gt; Cast it out." If we could put this on the board. First John chapter 4. 1 John chapter 4:8. I'm sorry this wasn't my notes. Let's Okay. The Bible says, "There is no fear in love, &gt;&gt; but perfect love, it cast it out." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because fear has torment. And he that is he that fearth is not made perfect in love. So the key somehow the key in dealing with fear is to have the love of God inside you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when you got the love of God, you trust God. But without the love of God, what are you trusting in? &gt;&gt; Your own ability to figure out how to fix the thing. &gt;&gt; Your own ability how to to cope with the situation. It ain't going to cast out all fear. &gt;&gt; It may it may dilute it and put it aside for a moment, but what really gives you the peace of God is the love of God. &gt;&gt; Don't try to face fear alone. Face fear with the love of God. Face fear with trusting in his word. Psalms 91:14 says, "Because he has set his love upon me, therefore I will deliver him." See, you've got all of heaven behind you. When you're all for heaven, [Laughter] when you're all for God, you got all of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you're not not all for God, how are you going to get the benefits? Jeremiah 17:7, "Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." &gt;&gt; You're a blessed man when you trust in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:20, "He that handle a a matter wisely shall find good, and who so trusteth in the Lord, happy is he." Tell me a man that is full of fear and is happy at the same time. Happy is the man who trusts in the Lord. Sad, scared, whatever is the man who doesn't trust in the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's on his own. &gt;&gt; A and and when you're trusting in the Lord, you can handle a matter wisely. But when you're not trusted in the Lord just &gt;&gt; and it's like crazy situation, you got to step back. God is with me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to wait on the Lord. I'm going to give a a a soft answer. I'm going to be real. I'm going to be I'm going to be honest. I I'm going to love God. I'm going to I'm going to trust in him. And we're going to get into some powerful things that is so easy to do that will really build your faith. We're either going to fear the unknown or we're going to trust in the Lord when we when we don't know. It's still unknown. But either we're going to fear the unknown or we're going to trust God with the unknown. &gt;&gt; It's still unknown. We don't need to know to be okay with it. But we either got to look we gota we got to learn to trust the Lord when we don't know something. &gt;&gt; Either be scared of the unknown or be happy because God is under control. God has everything under control with the unknown that we don't know nothing about. You know if we just take for instance um I'll just you know for myself when my brother had passed away my mother had passed away my father had passed away even my other brother when he had passed away I am still left with why did that happen and why did that happen then why couldn't it been down the God doesn't tell us those things. He don't tell us a lot of things. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean we can't trust him. &gt;&gt; So, so we don't need to know to trust. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Peace I leave with you, not as the world give I give you peace as I give it to you. Peace I leave with you, not as the world gives you. God gives us a peace that when we're in the middle of a trial, every peace is still there. The peace that the world gives you is everything's okay right now, but as soon as the trial starts, there's, you know, problems. &gt;&gt; And in other words, peace only is remains there as long as you got, you know, you see everything and everything's under control and you got all understanding and all that. So, But we're believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're we're believers that believe in a higher power than our own understanding. &gt;&gt; Peace I leave with you. Peace I give you. Not as the world giveth give I you. Isaiah 26:3 says, "Thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trustth in thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's peace can keep you through trials, can keep you through the boo, watch out. Whenever the devil appears before you and comes with this thing that you never saw coming, that's usually when it happens, right? This just kind of came out of left field. Didn't even know it was going to happen. Boom. It's there. You can still have peace. That's why it's more valuable than anything. All the you gota have all the money in the world or have peace. What would what would you take? It's valuable. Fear is a powerful manipulative tool of the devil that must be recognized when it appears. And if you don't recognize it, what will happen? It will manipulate you because fear, if I'll say it like this, it's the it's stronger than anything but God. It's stronger than anything but God. And you need God to not let it affect you. Some of you might remember the story I told when this um mother went to go get some groceries down uh the road and she left the the kids there in the house and by the time she got back uh um she didn't hear any noise at all. Like what is going on? I mean when you got kids you got noise &gt;&gt; and there was no noise. they weren't running around. So, she's like wondering what's going on. So, she, you know, gets inside the door and she notices there's like seven of the kids there in a circle and they're all holding a baby skunk. There's a family of skunks and they're all holding just putting. Now, the kids have no idea what's going on, but the mother does. So she walks in there and she just panics. Oh no. And she screams like that and all a sudden they all sprayed. &gt;&gt; She got succumbed by the fear instead of just that's there. Now let's handle the the matter wisely. &gt;&gt; What Lord? What should I do here? Because if you think about it, one minute before she walked in the door, there was not that going on. &gt;&gt; When she came in, started dealing with it, she dealt with it wrong. So, we have to face fear with trust &gt;&gt; in God, not our own our own wisdom. Like, we're going to teach the kids right now, and we're going to we're going to show we're upset right now. We're going to teach the kids right now. We're going to just do it all at one time. They better get it straightened out. It's not going to happen. Fear is of the devil. Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 1:7, "For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and love and of a sound mind." If I can just say this, this this woman's driving home with her groceries right now. She don't know it, but the devil has something lined up for her. She's just driving home, got the groceries, probably happy that she's got something for dinner, but the devil had something lined up for her. And when she saw the skunks, that is when the spirit of fear appeared. in the most time that it could come in. Now, of course, if she's driving home and uh she gets the thought, you know, what would I do if there was, you know, skunks in the house and the kids were holding them? What would be the best? Would she have time to think about it? Right? But fear don't do that to you. &gt;&gt; Fear doesn't give you a warning. &gt;&gt; It just appears &gt;&gt; and you've got to be instant in season, out of season. You got to be ready to deal with that thing. So when we feel fear or the spirit of fear, we're actually feeling the effect of the devil. It starts in our mind, our thoughts, our feelings, our emotions, and our bodies actually become infected by it. Have you ever been so full of fear that you actually you had to use the bathroom more? &gt;&gt; If I could just say it like that. Fear affects your body. &gt;&gt; Did you know stress, worry, fear, anxiety can weaken your heart? &gt;&gt; It can even cause cancer. &gt;&gt; And think about it. Fear is nothing but a lie. &gt;&gt; It's nothing but the spirit of the devil. Jonathan Wensley often quotes this. Proverbs 18:21, "Death and life are in the power of the tongue. They that love it shall eat the fruit thereof." Death and life are in the power of the sun. I just wanted to just take a second on this. Now, it's not it's not just what comes out of your mouth. That's powerful because Jesus said, "With their lips they do worship me, but their heart is far from me." Now, if you just don't think about what you're saying and you say something negative about somebody, it's going to have a negative effect on them. But it's not just speaking where the power is against the devil. Now, I'm just speaking of against fear. It's learning to speak what's in your heart. God is wanting you wanting your heart to speak. Uh you God is wanting your mouth to speak what you're what's in your heart. If I can say it like that. You can't just you know what's in your mind. It's got to be in your heart. In other words, there has to be the the seed comes from the heart. Isaiah 55:11 says, "So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing wherein I sent it. There is power when you speak from your heart. Good or bad, righteous or evil, there is power when you speak from your heart. Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. That doesn't mean everything you say is from your heart. It will either build or it will destroy. If you speak negative, something negative to somebody, you're actually going to feel yucky inside. You will, whether you address it or not, you're going to walk away and you're going to feel yucky. But if you esteem somebody better than yourself, you're literally going to be building yourself up and you weren't even trying. That's how it works, &gt;&gt; right? And so God, he wants us to be little gods. &gt;&gt; He speaks the word and it's not going to come back void. God says to my children, I want you to start speaking the word. &gt;&gt; Speak it. Speak to that situation. Speak to fear. So I need your cooperation. We're going to minister a little bit together this morning. So, I want you to say this with me. &gt;&gt; Fear is of the devil. &gt;&gt; And I want you to think about the words as you're saying them. Ready? Believe it. Remember, have it come from the heart. God has not given me the spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; I do not have fear. &gt;&gt; I do not have fear. I choose not to fear. &gt;&gt; I choose not to fear. &gt;&gt; I will not fear. &gt;&gt; I will not fear. &gt;&gt; Fear shall not reside in me. &gt;&gt; Fear shall not rule inside of me. &gt;&gt; And don't make this, you know, just a regular Catholic church here. I really, really want you to believe in what you're saying. &gt;&gt; All right, we're gonna have a few more. If God be for us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; And that's what he told Josh, I'll be with you wherever you go. &gt;&gt; God has given me the power of love and a sound mind. Fear shall not be able to separate me from the love of God. &gt;&gt; God's perfect love inside of me casteth out all fear. &gt;&gt; How does it feel to minister with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this is not weird or silly or strange to say these things. The devil comes to our mind and he speaks negatively all the time. &gt;&gt; We don't give him we're not asking him to come. He just comes. &gt;&gt; We We should come to the that battleground in our mind and we need to confess where we stand with him. &gt;&gt; We don't let him just stay there and and talk to us. We need to we need to say no fear shall not be a part of my life. &gt;&gt; On this date in September on Sunday, I made a decision. I am not having fear part of my life anymore. &gt;&gt; And it needs to start with a a heart of belief and a confession out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Don't try to do it without a confession. It just doesn't work. You need to speak it. Hebrews chapter 3:1 says, "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, I want you to consider the apostle and the high priest of what? &gt;&gt; Our profession." &gt;&gt; Our profession. We need to speak it. You ever just, you know, go in the room and and you you you you're having a hard time and you you you you want to go pray, but your mind wanders and it bounces all thoughts just bounce all over the place. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you just got to this is enough nonsense and you start praying out loud &gt;&gt; and before you know it, you're actually in tune to what you're saying. But it was hard at the beginning &gt;&gt; and and it took you speaking it out loud to have it happen even though your heart was there &gt;&gt; because there's a battle going on in your mind. &gt;&gt; So you need to speak it. I can't express this enough. We don't we need to just tell the devil where we're standing. &gt;&gt; Who was faithful to him that appointed him. So, so who was faithful to him who appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house. So God was faithful. The father was faithful to Jesus. Amen. Now that word profession, the high priest of our profession, it means acknowledgment or confession. So when you acknowledge God in your situation that God is with me and I I will not fear. You're confessing it. Then God says, "Okay, I'm going to make sure this happens." &gt;&gt; But if you just like, "Well, I know I'm not supposed to fear. Why is this thing happening to me? This shouldn't be here." No. Go to battle. Go to battle. God is with me. This is where I'm standing. verse uh uh Hebrews chapter 13 verse number five. Let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he have said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. So, do you think God ever gets scared when the devil comes and he taunts him? No, he's not afraid. And when God when we yield to the word of God, when we have the spirit of God in us, when we're full of God's love, we're not going to be succumbed by the fear that attacks us in our minds. Verse six, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. Now that word boldly, it means to exercise courage and confidence. That's what we just did when we were saying those things that we said together. We were exercising, courage, confidence. We were building assurance. Sometimes we just have to say it out loud to get going and to get a greater faith, a greater belief to to get it to the place that we can look uh fear in the face and say, "I will not be moved." &gt;&gt; Because the devil wants to put us in a corner. &gt;&gt; Don't know what to do. No hope. What's going to happen? I trust in my God. So we need to exercise. We need to put spiritual effort to improve our courage and our confidence by strengthening our mind and just we at one time I brought a a a picture in and it was about this little kitty who was looking in the mirror. You all seen that? And in the mirror was a picture of this great big lion. &gt;&gt; And and and sometimes we don't recognize that God is really with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we need to put into practice every day. I will not let fear in my life. &gt;&gt; Just get up and speak it. If if if you if you feel you you you you you uh can't accomplish something, just say, "I am not fearing. I believe that God is with me." &gt;&gt; You don't got to have all the answers, but it needs to start out with faith &gt;&gt; with a confidence. You need to exercise. You can't wait till your situation is all taken care of to say, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I knew it was going to work out." No. God wants to show you off in the middle of your problem. &gt;&gt; He He wants you. He wants you. There's my daughter. There's my son. Look at the way they're standing right now in the face of the devil. &gt;&gt; That we may boldly say, "The Lord is my helper. I will not fear what man shall do unto me." Psalms 921 or 92 verse2 says I look at this I will say of the Lord that's what we were doing by the way we were saying it we were saying I will not let fear in my life I choose not to have fear we're saying it and here David says I will say of the Lord he is my refuge he and my fortress my God in him will I trust &gt;&gt; God is looking for our personal confession. He knows what what he can do. He's waiting on us to say my God can do it. &gt;&gt; So we just we're going to be like Paul. I'm going to give you some or or like David. He I'm give some examples that he actually uses the words of speaking. It's not odd. It's not weird. We just need to practice it more. &gt;&gt; I, John Martin, will say of the Lord, he is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. He is my refuge. He is my rock. He is my strength. He is my confession. Surely, he shall deliver me from the snare of the follower and from the noise and pestilence. You know what to me what noise and pestilence is. &gt;&gt; That's that fear buzzing around in your head. &gt;&gt; Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. Always telling you about the problem. But the Bible says that he will deliver us. You know, we've heard you can't stop a bird from flying over your head, but you can keep them from making a nest in your hair. Surely shall deliver thee from the snare of the follower and from the noise and pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings thou shalt trust. His trust shall be thy shield and a buckler. I I don't want It's hard to trust God when you're away from him. &gt;&gt; But it's easy to trust when he's with you. &gt;&gt; Like I don't care what problem you've ever faced. That was the the hardest fearful thing. If you could literally see Jesus standing next to you, &gt;&gt; that's why the disciples were so afraid when he was leaving. &gt;&gt; Like what's going to go on? What's going to happen? Let you know let your let not your heart be troubled. either be afraid. I'm going to send back the comforter. He's going to be with you. He's actually going to be in you now. And you're it's going to be just like um it's actually be better than me standing here next to you. I'm going to be inside of you. And because I am with you, I'm never going to leave you. I'm never going to forsake you. You can boldly say, "The Lord is my helper." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I shall not be moved. I will dwell in the secret place of the most high. I shall abide under the shadow of the most of the almighty. Jesus said in Matthew 18:18, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, who whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, &gt;&gt; and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again, I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven. You have power to bind a situation. &gt;&gt; Say, get out of my life. &gt;&gt; That may exist over there, but not here. I am not going to be affected by that. I choose peace. I choose to trust God. Sometimes we're not taking the word that's been given to us and using it against the devil. David boldly exercised courage and confidence. He said in Psalms 27:1, "The Lord is my is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat of my flesh, and they stumbled and fall fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear." &gt;&gt; Amen. And we got to say the same thing. Though I got this huge problem in my life, I am not going to fear. &gt;&gt; The war should rise up against me. In this will I be confident. Psalms 56:3. What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. Right there, you have a choice. That's telling you you got a choice. When fear appears to me, I'm going to trust. I just love that. In in God, I will praise his word. In God, I put my trust. I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. So, don't let fear paralyze you anymore. &gt;&gt; I mean, if you can get serious with this, you know how happy a person you're going to be. &gt;&gt; Because this is a real thing. Take a stand. take a stand and and make a positive confession in your heart and and God will God will move on the behalf of your profession. &gt;&gt; If you confess that I'm an overcomer, you will start to be an overcomer. I &gt;&gt; if you if you confess I I am not going to have fear part of my life anymore, you'll see a as time goes on, you will grow and fear will be less a part of your life. Now it may not happen overnight &gt;&gt; because you know character is not a gift. &gt;&gt; It's a victory &gt;&gt; and you have to learn to deal with fear. Don't become by it. Don't say, "I don't want to deal with it." Don't put it off. Just say, "It's there, but it ain't touching me. &gt;&gt; I've taken a stand. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? I If I This is what I want you to do. I want you to look forward to the next time you the devil tries to scare you. And I want you to take this word that you heard today and just say, "I'm not going to be afraid because God is with me. He's my shield. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my strength. What time I'm afraid, I'm going to trust him. I will not fear." And I want you to practice saying this every day. You know, I actually I started going to therapy. I'm kind of off right now till I get it straightened back out, but I'm going to be going. And what they do is you you have to practice exercising your muscles, right? I I think we have to start practicing spiritually exercising our muscles &gt;&gt; because look, the the devil is not going to stop ta taunting you. &gt;&gt; He's not going to just leave you alone. He's not going to say, "Okay, you've had enough now, John. You're you're you're you're 50 years old. You got enough now." He don't stop. So what you have to do is stop him. &gt;&gt; And you stop him by exercising your faith, your confidence, your trust, and not just some um imagination. &gt;&gt; Like I'm I'm some some um some Christian that that knows the Bible. But when you come and face the devil, you you get all upset, you get angry, and you start yelling at at people. It doesn't matter what you know. &gt;&gt; It matters what you possess. &gt;&gt; And and and we need to really possess the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Psalms 118:6, the Lord is on my side. I will not fear what man can do unto me. Last verse here in Mark 11:22. And Jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in God. Have faith in God. Faith, this word faith means persuasion and confidence. So if we don't have faith, the faith that we desire, then we need to humbly start exercising courage and confidence. Just start saying it. Even though you don't maybe feel it, say it. And before long, you're you're going to believe it more. And you say it more and then you believe it more. And before you know it, you begin to grow in your confidence. And this is what pleases God. Doubts, fears, you know, waiting for God to come and and and and just um you know, give you something. That ain't the way he works. That's why when he stood on the earth, he said, "If thou cast believe, all things are possible." Do you believe me? I can do this. He's always What was the theme of of brother Brandham's ministry? Only believe, trying to get the people to believe. when when there would be somebody coming through the the the prayer line and they didn't quite have the faith, he would stop and he would go out there into the audience, something would happen, to increase their faith. God is always pulling us to trust him more, to believe more, to grow because the devil through fear shrinks our faith, shrinks us. And people are falling away. Apostasies everywhere. Just a a a great falling away. And it's those that are going to fall in love with the word of God. Stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Those are the ones that are going to be here. &gt;&gt; Had a chance to talk to Sister Levantine and she was sharing these these same things. People just don't love the word like they used to. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Have faith in God. Start confessing it out loud. Start speaking it out loud. Start testifying out loud. This is who you are. This is what you believe. &gt;&gt; And don't wait till you have a good day to do it. &gt;&gt; And don't be afraid that you're going to fall after you after you say it. &gt;&gt; Get up again and say it. Get up again and say it. Because if you don't save yourself, nobody else will. &gt;&gt; Verse 23. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, I'm going to say this, fear, it doesn't matter what it is, this mountain of fear, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith, notice, which he saith, I love that, not what he he thinks in his head, but what he saith shall come to pass. He shall have whatsoever what he saith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to confess it. &gt;&gt; You got to speak it. You can't just You can't let the preacher do it. &gt;&gt; You can't let brother Brandham do it. You can't let somebody else do it. &gt;&gt; The devil is not going to somebody else to get permission to come to you with fear. He's coming directly to you. &gt;&gt; So, you got to be able to be equipped to tell the devil, "Get behind me. Therefore, I say unto you, what what things soever you desire when you pray, believe that you will receive them, and ye shall have them. Amen. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; You want to exercise faith, confess it. I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; Fear is not a part of my life. I gave that up a long time ago. How many's How many's given up a habit that you used to have? Like you used to have a habit. You knew you had it and you don't have it anymore. Let me see your hands. Okay. And that was the power of God, right? &gt;&gt; And I don't care if it's smoking, drinking, cussing. I don't care what the habit was. You had it. You gave it up. &gt;&gt; You can give up fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can give that habit up of that habit of listening and and and and listening to what the devil says. &gt;&gt; Like your whole life can change &gt;&gt; because fear is a manipulator and it has no part with a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen.
