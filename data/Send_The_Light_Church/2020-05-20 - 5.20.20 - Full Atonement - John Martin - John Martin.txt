well we're coming down to the last mile of the way before the rapture amen let's sing that the last mile away if I walk in the pathway of duty if I were till the close of the day I shall see break evening his beauty where I've gone the last mile way when I've gone the last mile of the way I will rest at the close of the day and I know there are joys that await me when I've gone the last mile of the way for crisis I proclaimed of that story if I see four has she gone astray I am sure he would show me his glory when I brought the last mile [Music] the way I will rest at the close of the and I know there are toys that await me when I'm gone the last mile of my way here the dearest of ties we must sever tears of sorrow are seen every day but no sig is no sign forever when I'm gone the last mile of the way [Applause] we have gone the last mile of I will close and I know there are joys that await me when I've gone the last mile of and if here I have earnest speech driven and if try all his will to obey to enhance the rapture of heavy when I'm gone we have all the last mile of the way I will rest that the clothes on and I know there are joys that await me wait up on the last mile of [Music] amen there are joys that await us outside of seeing the Lord what what greatest joy can we have to see someone there because of you you better spend time fellowship you with them that's a joy that awaits us the those that you are to bring in those that you have brought in and those that you will bring in that's that's what we're looking forward to that's what we need to Ernest Lee striven to do all he's called us to obey and that is one of the things that was like that was the last Commission it was the Great Commission to go e out and so as we're in this last mile the way we're looking for that seed and just pray that God would use you to bring if it's not the last one it bring one in before the last one comes in amen I believe it's all possible when God has his way in our life and I just want to sing let the Holy Ghost come in because that's letting God have his way amen would [Music] [Music] [Music] you have this in your heart to cheer relief from every doubt and fear make the consecration trusting out and big we go scummy trusting my baby girl is coming do you want the fire of God to fill your soul burn up all the drawers and sanctify me holes make the consecration trusting God and in the Holy Ghost coming [Music] trusting God and [Music] the Holy Ghost do you back the power to make you true and pray so that you can rescue those hair Christ would say make the consecration trusting God and the Holy Ghost coming trusting God and the Holy Ghost come pay more time the Holy Ghost I think concentration testing on in pain the holy ghost come here hey men that's what we want tonight is to let the Holy Ghost come inside and reveal to us himself so his church can be built more inside of us and that we could walk more in truth the truth that he has for us to walk in that if I could say it like this all of us have more truth to be walk-in and yes we're walking into the message but the message is still being revealed he's given us a fivefold ministry to bring us to that if I could say it like this a perfect walk Amen a perfect lie even when Abraham was walking with a with God God still told him to walk before me and be perfect and Enoch kept walking with the Lord and his walk kept getting closer and closer brother Brandon said till one day he was just closer to heaven then he was here and God just took him so we're here today that we might draw closer to the Lord and know him in a greater measure and be able to walk closer to him than we did when we came he then now I got to before we be open to scriptures they got thinking about this this thought and I'm sure you would agree with me it is much harder to get in to the service or to the word when we're live-streaming it's it's very hard I mean if you think about it sometimes we listen to a tape a message tape kind of like background trying to maybe do two things at one time and sometimes we were just maybe looking for an answer about something and we we begin to use it in such a way of not as full potential and we're used to you know when we come to church this is it this is where God's going to speak to me and I'll say it like anyone that's desiring to receive more of the Lord to the live streaming so much of it I'll just say a hundred percent of it for you depends on your preparation if you're in the spirit I'm telling you God is gonna pour out his blessing but if you're not and you're expecting that the ministry or somehow through it that you're going to just maybe grab something here or there I think we're gonna come up short of the valuable enough that's in front of us because you know brother Branham gave us the message or God did give us the message to the Prophet enrapturing faith lies in those tapes now if we listen those tastes with just a nonchalant we're not gonna probably receive as much from God as if we put our whole heart and our attitude our love and our desire hunger nor thirst and so it is a lot of times when we're watching things on the internet watching things on TV or watching things on our cell phone and we're we're hearing so many different things so many different views about the opening and the closing and the coronavirus and the start and the finish there's are so many things out there that work we get in this habit of what we're listening to everything with a grain of salt because we don't know what to believe well we kind of end up carrying that same type of mentality into the church and what we need to be coming is with a completely different mindset a mindset of this is you and me Lord this is I know you've got something for me because I've been praying about I've been seek and I've been hunger and I've been desiring this and I think the more that we can adapt our attitude to just perfectly pleasing to you I believe the more that will bow to benefit so that's just for those that are desiring something more than what they've been able to really get may the Lord bless each of you in those efforts now before I forget we want to set a date to go back and have service together again and it's going to be the last Sunday of this month that's going to be may 31st the band should be lifted then but we don't know for sure because anything could happen but we're going to do everything that we can to to come together and create an atmosphere that we trust will be a blessing for those that can gather together we're going to provide masks we're going to practice social distancing and but we're not asking anybody to wear a mask we're not telling anybody to wear a mask but if you wear a mask we're so happy that you're wearing a mask if you don't wear masks were we're happy that you're not wearing a mask you're there to worship the Lord now if there's any underlying issues any kind of sicknesses or things like that just at this time you know before the corner virus you know a little sniffle was you know kind of okay and then you know when you got a fever we'd say you know stay back but now what does coronavirus if there's any sense of any sickness just in respect to others would be good to stay home until that's you know gone so there will be some sitter Cathleen wanted us to make mention of this and I really appreciate her sister helping us to do things right she wanted us to make mention make it clear that some will have some people probably wear masks and some people won't and if you know that some people are not going to be a mask maybe you would feel uncomfortable being there and you wouldn't want to be there and so we want to tell you that ahead of time but I believe with our respect for one another respect for the word respect for this virus as it were we want to do everything we can and we'll do everything we can to to protect I mean I think people get a will get closer in grocery stores is going through aisles and things like that and then then at church but we're just we won't do hugging and shaking hands and things like that we're just going to come and create an an atmosphere that we could be lifted up in his presence and so we're setting that date and we pray that you'll be praying about that and the Lord would just have his way amen well if we could just stand for the reading of the word turn with me if you would to the book of Matthew chapter 25 Matthew the book chapter 25 maybe Anne could put on we got a little picture that we got from brother Marty today and he wasn't expecting us to do this but we want to put it up on the screen right now kind of give everybody a look at this picture he sent it and he said take a look at the road signs I don't know if you could see the Sun what you're looking at but on the left-hand side there's the road signs that say a one-way and then underneath it a yellow one that says dead-end and it's pointing to a graveyard and and the Bible says it's once unto man to die and then to judgment and the reason I wanted to do this is this ultimately this is where we all go unless unless we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord we will have a rapture so there is another way to bypass death that's through a rapture Amen so turn with me Saint Matthew chapter 25 before we begin reading there let's just ask God to bless this word before we read it father God we thank you for the opportunity to be gathered together in your house Lord for there's a many many houses that we have are in right now and we've made you the king of that house we've made you the Lord of that house and we honor you in our homes and Lord we're inviting to you in to this service in their homes and I pray Lord that your revelation and the anointing of your word would be upon every life every heart that they could take this so personal Lord that everything that is transpired today would just be secondary lore we commit this into your hands and we trust you for the revelation of your word now for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen starting with verse number one this is about the ten virgins then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet UNO we know that's the message of the hour amen then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answer is saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in into the marriage and a door was shut and afterwards came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us and he answered and said verily I sang to you I know you not watch therefore for ye know not the day nor the hour when the Son of man cometh amen god bless you may be seated we want to continue in our little series being ready and in kind of entitled part 2 here fall atonement the full atonement we want to get into that we just kind of ended part 1 with a quote there and we're gonna touch base on that again but for our subject rejecting the atonement in its fullness rejecting the atonement in its fullness and we're taking those words rape from the message we always want to be in a state of being ready I think brother Mike's head what's at me and so that would be a good title for your the part one a state of being ready versus getting ready and it's such a good point and that's what our goal is to be in a state of being ready so we don't want to be looking at the rapture as a singular culminating event that lies somewhere ahead of us down the road remember what brother Branham said in God hiding himself in simplicity he says you know these things the time is at hand Church the time is at hand don't don't don't wait any longer how do you know the rapture is not going on all the time that's right so we're in that process so there there is a a readiness to get ready and in the message perseverant brother band said four months later after he that last quote I just read you he said let me repeat it they had the very elected describes in the Apostles called of the Lord were looking for the Messiah to come but Isaiah's to come to forerun is coming and he cometh and did it in such humility till they didn't even recognize him and I may and may I say this as my own thoughts one of these days you're looking for a lot to happen and that's happening and you don't know it you're gonna say before the rapture of the church so there are things happening right cuz the tendency that brother Brent says that man has is he's always looking at what God did in the passing and and seeing the marvel and and praising him for what he did the better he's also looking at the future of how great he's going to come and what he's gonna do and they don't catch they're missing what he's doing because they're not actively thinking that he is and I am God and he is preparing us right now for a rapture and we can say that with full assurance now all 10 believers in going to our pair of our opening Scripture now all 10 believers were excited about going to meet Jesus in the rapture because they all went they all went out right so they were excited they were believers now we do know at the end there there were half of them now he said I don't know you they their testimony as we know God but Jesus is testimony of them as I don't know you so in our relationship with God it's two ways it's our thoughts about God but then it's God's thoughts about us too so it's important so they were excited to meet Jesus in a rapture in other words they were not ashamed of the life they lived they were proud to be a believer and they took their lamps their hearts and went out to meet Jesus now half of the believers brother Branham said they were virgins they were clean living so they were proud in the life they live now half of the believers realize that if Jesus wasn't Lord of everything then he wasn't Lord at all and that the only way that they that he could be lord over them was by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit ruling in their life he had to take rule in their life 1st Corinthians chapter 12 verse 3 says we're I give you to understand that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost it's got to be the holy ghost or else there's there's just no revelation of it to see many will say Lord Lord right Manuel come to me and say Lord Lord and even here these five of these the foolish versions were saying Lord Lord open to us but but we can only really say Lord by the Holy Ghost that's why it's important it's the anointing of God speaking it and not just our carnal flesh with that knowledge now they understood half of these believers they understood the whys that the oil of the Holy Ghost was the only way that God could gain full more chip in their life that is the seal of the Holy Ghost residing in them which is the full atonement I want you to catch this this is the full atonement it's the Holy Ghost God Himself ruling in your light no justification is a portion of the Holy Ghost sanctification is a portion alloys but I'm talking about lordship now the full ruling going beyond sanctification here Matthew 25 or Matthew 24 verse 45 and we talked about this in part one I just kind of want to bring this together who then is a faithful and wise servant okay they're wise virgins now who then is a faithful wise servant whom his Lord have made ruler over his household do you see what made them wise virgin is they allowed the Lord Jesus Christ to take rulership in their lives amen and nothing short of that will make us a wise version amen praise the Lord now Jesus identified this half of the believers as wise because they took oil in their vessels with their lamps they took the Holy Ghost the full Holy Ghost with them and this oil was the proof that God had accepted their faith now remember brother Brennan makes this statement he says when you get baptized that you accepting Christ but when Jesus Christ fills you with the Holy Ghost that's not accepting your faith and the oil is the proof that God has accepted your faith because he said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and that promises unto you and to your children so we got to keep keep telling their children the Holy Ghost is for them even though they heard it and I don't mean you know drowning them out or you know get him discouraged away from you but look we're running out of time now the other half of the believers they took only a portion of the atonement that was provided very important they believe that Jesus died for their sins on the cross and they received that part of atonement they believed all all that was needed was to live a good sincere clean Christian life the best that they could in other words they had convinced themselves that they had enough of God to be ready for a rapture their lamps were burning amen they were burning they were burning with fire and no matter how many times the preacher would say we need to get more oil we need to get more Holy Spirit they personally felt that they had all that they needed to make it now remember the attitude of the Spirit in the end time was in need of nothing that was the the attitude in this age they had of God but they were blind to that part she Satan wants us to feel we have enough of God wants us to feel we got enough Holy Spirit because of what we know or what we've done or how long we've been but I'll just say like this press said to get more of God press said you're not gonna you're not gonna ever ever feel you made a mistake doing that now Jesus identified these virgin believers as foolish they were merchants they were claimed they live good lives but they were foolish because they took their sincere hearts and refused to take the oil that was required with them in other words they had rejected the atonement in its fullness right there it is I just want to soak in you can see why Saint would want them to think they got all they need Matthew 25 verse 8 the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out so at one time their lamp was burning they had enough oil in their lamp to burn it right but they didn't have enough it's a sobering thought it seems like the foolish are always demanding from the wise help isn't that funny they ought to have been living for others the foolish virgins they ought to be living for others and here they are they're caught at the end and they're asking the wise for something that only God can give they all have been living for others all along and giving of themselves but now they find themselves once again asking others instead of trusting God to supply what they need Oh praise the Lord you know in my mind brother mark I'm just I'm hearing all these amens you know before I'm going on to the next thing and not that you know I'm not saying everybody saying Amen but the word is real and and to me it's I don't say Amen to my own preaching but this word this is what this studies for is were really digging in to that fine line cuz we want to be ready in them now notice the wise said to the foolish in verse number 9 they said not so lest there be not enough for us and you now I just want you to think about that you do not have enough Holy Ghost inside of you to be giving half of it to somebody else we've got to encourage one another to get more of the Holy Ghost on their own I love their advice I love the advice of these wise virgins to the borderline believers they said but go ye rather to them that sell and buy it for yourself that's the only way you can get it they realized they knew that you couldn't make it in on knowledge and understanding in church attendance and tithe pay in you really had to go to the go get the Holy Ghost God promised to give the Holy Ghost if we seek him we'll find him knock and the door shall be open it's a promise if you've repented you've gotten baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost well brother John I didn't I haven't received it yet what spend some more time repenting get zealous about repenting because that's what seems to turn the heart of God when you're more zealous to get more of God and less of yourself because he wants to give you give us all more holy ghost of what we want now in order to get the Holy Ghost you have to buy it that's what the wise virgins said you have to buy it and why didn't they already buy the oil before then why didn't the foolish virgin already buy the oil before then they had time because the price was too high think about it if gas or the grocery say a toilet paper was $500 a roll and it was going to be $500 a roll until Saturday and then it was going down to 50 cents a roll would you want to buy the toilet paper now no because it's too outrageous nobody's gonna spend that kind of money you're gonna wait so why didn't the foolish virgin go by the oil they didn't buy it because the price was too high they had to buy the oil with their life come by without money and without price they had to give themselves they had to give up their will and give it over to God in order to buy it remember our last service jesus said if any man will come after me let him deny himself or whoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life surrender his real for my sake the same shall save it it's giving of yourself and to a lot of people the price is too high it reminds me of the story of the pig and the chicken they were walking down the road together they were trying to work out the relationship and at one point the chicken he tried to take advantage of the pig and he said let's eat something I'll supply the eggs and you you supply the ham well the pig said that's nothing for you that's just a normal effort but for me it's gonna cost him everything I got and that's how a lot of Christians are they're more like a chicken who only wants to give the egg and God is calling for a full commitment amen jesus said all that time before me all that ever came before me were thieves and robbers they didn't want to give what was what was right what was what was a good exchange they they wanted to steal up rather than Jesus is that door and then he's the door and we got to come through that door we got to come his way amen now these borderline believers did not want to give up all their lives they were convinced that they had already given enough of their life to God in other words Calvary paid it off for me Jesus did it all and there was nothing more that they needed to give up they never receive the fullness of the Tollman these borderline believers they never did but they didn't realize that it was too late when they admitted that there were certain things in their life that was missing and those things are in there in Galatians 5:22 love joy peace longsuffering it's the fruit of the Holy Ghost so when those things are missing in our lives we need to realize we need more oil amen we need more oil and then the fruit of the oil comes amen our opening scripture here Matthew 25 verse number 10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut just like God shut the door on the ark God shutting the door of time when we can enter in for the rapture now why would any of us want to wait - that day - that very very last culminating day to really get serious and think about do I have enough of God now no Saints the political way of being a message believer in preaching as a - a message people is that we are all all saved we're all going into rapture and let's just look that's fine and dandy but we know that's not the truth and I am NOT trying to take or D Christianize or debride anybody but I'm also not wanting to give the devil anything to stand on to make people foolishly think that they're ready when they're not and so there's a balance here and we don't want to wait and afterwards verse 11 came also the other virgins and they're saying Lord Lord open to us they're still in this mindset they have a relationship with the Lord but he answered and said verily verily I say unto you I know you not so part of the atonement they took and they had a certain relationship with the Lord that the Lord knew them saw that he saw them because they were virgins they were believers but when it came to being bride - who's going to sit with him on the throne he did not feel comfortable having somebody by him who didn't want to give all their heart to him so he addresses them you know for this for the marriage suffer when it comes to the marriage supper now I don't know you when it comes to salvation yeah they're saved I mean if they if they followed I mean that's up to God under the great white throne judgment they're gonna sleep a thousand years and wake up to that but but part of the Thousand Year reign and being with the prize that's not going to happen and I or no one can tell you that you know all the foolish virgins are going to be saved or not to me the only the only guarantee is get the the Holy Ghost because God would have never promised it if it wasn't necessary so to just get it and then we don't have to worry about it and then watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh so if I was to ask you today is the Lord coming tomorrow we would probably all say I don't think so I mean we don't got the krona voice virus is taken care of yet and we're not back to work or we're not back in the church and I haven't done this yet my life that I want to do we would feel that he's not coming tomorrow but that's the very spirit in which he's trying to tell us to be aware of that he's coming in our when you're not thinking that he's coming so that's a very dangerous thought to have I remember part one in part one when they asked brother Branham he said after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgins be saved or will they be lost I just want to say this after the bride is raptured the days of the Gentiles are finished so if they're finished how are any of them going to be saved so at that point if they were saved prior to those days then that's the way the tree falls they will be saved afterwards there will be no more Gentiles foolish or wise saved the days of the Gentiles are done foolish or wise as you know there's a there's attorney to the Jews no this is their time brother Ram said the foolish virgins will have to go through the tribulation period and the reason is because they rejected the atonement in its fullness she is a believer I professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period amen end a quote so she's a believer and God saying I don't know you're not well when it comes to being the bride there's a special relationship there that God is looking for it's no longer he paid for my sins at Calvary it goes deeper than that it's a walking relationship that he's he's continuing giving us information and given us his word and showing us things to come that he wants us to walk in now the foolish virgin is a believer a professed believer a borderline believer a borderline believer she believes up to the border it's a good way of saying it she believed to a point but rejected walking into the fullness of the promise and I want you to catch when I'm staying here she believed to a point but she rejected walking into the fullness of the promised land she came up to the promise and and she rejected walking over it it was too hard for them to believe in a nature change in a full nature change she just couldn't believe the Giants were too great in their life to reject the atonement in its fullness now this may shock you means to reject Calvary in his fullness but it is the truth and I'm going to tell you why Calvary was meant to take us far beyond salvation it was to take us beyond the coming out of the bondage of the world it was meant to take us over into the promised land of a nature changed that's what Calvary was for a complete nature change now the word atonement is mentioned only a few places in the New Testament believe it or not their first one is in Romans chapter 5 verse 10 his brother Brandon we got to get into this word now they rejected the atonement in its fullness for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement the bride receives all the atonement praise God we're gonna get into what that means to Paul telling the Roman Church that we have now received the atonement but the foolish virgin rejected the torment in his fullness so the atonement for the bride is presented and she receives it the fullness of the Tollman is presented to the foolish virgin but she does she rejects it she says I really don't have to get real serious and gets so full the Holy Ghost I can still make it with how much I meant see I'm burning my lamps burning look I'm on fire them I'm excited I'm going to church and this has happened friend there's a time coming Jesus said work while you can because the night cometh when no man worketh we need a lot more oil than what we have right now and this is what this is for is for us to dig in and to seek God and to get more of the oil now what does the word atonement really mean this is what it means the Greek tells us it means to exchange exchange this fits right in we're the only way that you can get the oil is you exchange your will to get it is to exchange that is restoration to the divine favor so what God's calling the shots whatever he says it has to happen it means reconciliation atonement means reconciliation the atonement was ordained to take us all the way beyond just accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Savior to a divine nature change to a restoration of our soul he restoreth my soul amen now the rest of the atonement can be more easily identified in first Corinthians chapter 5 they use a different word but it's the same exact meaning in other words I think the word atonement you'll see it only two times in the New Testament but the exact same mean that comes from the Greek is actually mentioned a third time and you'll find it here in 1st Corinthians chapter 5 let's just start with verse 17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature there's the the restoration there's there's been a change all things are passed away behold all things have become new see the exchange right there is the atonement look at this as an unconditional surrender to God's will the old nature's passed away the new nature is beginning to manifest and materialize and we're gonna try to get into that office that next next thing we get part three but but part four look at verse 18 now and all things are of God that's what the atonement takes you to it doesn't take you just a salvation oh he saved me I pretty much do what I want to do now but it takes you to where all things are of God now brothers sister I'll be the first to stand in line because if I'm to help us if I am to help us if I can say it like that into a rapture I need to have all things in my life be of God and all things are of God who have reconciled us now that word reconciled that means the same thing as atonement all things are of God who have atoned us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the Ministry of reconciliation so first of all the foolish virgins rejected the ministry of being fully reconciled to God that's the first thing they did they rejected all things becoming of God they only took part of it just like the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt they took they wanted the salvation from the devil from Satan but they didn't take all the Tollman going to the promised land well so does this foolish version they accept Calvary they accept what Jesus died they accept this their sins being covered but they do not go on to receive all the toment and his fullness to where all things are of God in their life right they're very happy which is powerful it takes the Holy Ghost nothing short of it that's number one number two because they felt no need to go further with God themselves they didn't feel any greater burden for others so they never so they rejected the Ministry of reconciliation for others think about it if they themselves don't feel they need to really give their all to God why would they have a burden for somebody else to give their all to God so they first rejected the ministry for themselves to be totally reconciled to God all things are of God the atonement everything for them second they reject the Ministry of reconciliation of helping others get to that same place that God's calling us to I hope you can see it we need a greater burden than just we want everything to be of God amen verse 19 now to wit that God was in Christ and he was reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation so now we can't go dying across like Christ did but we're carrying the word of reconciliation and that is to give your life to Jesus Christ God committed the ministry on to them but they rejected the atonement in its fullness and now we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God now that's the Ministry of reconciliation we're all called to be missionaries to get reconciled to God and it goes beyond confess with your mouth believe with your hour Jesus died for you and get baptized it goes beyond that people need to get an expectation to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is something that people don't want talked a lot about you know they don't mind the anointing of God on them that makes them feel good but we're talking about power for service amen power to go out and to reconcile other people that is much harder because there is rejection there's persecution there's hurt there's pain but jesus told his disciples don't you go out there a witness without it don't be taking your tea parties and and and and just you know inviting somebody to - to a good time and in the church he says you stay there and you wait to you and do a power from on high because you're going to be persecuted you're gonna be stoned you're gonna be rejected people are gonna hate you and throw you out of their house you have the Holy Ghost you'll love them anyways you'll pray for your enemies you'll love them you have a bird for them and you'll keep going it's what the ministry is we're ambassadors we're ambassadors for Christ I just want to ask you today have we accepted that part of the totalement that's part of it don't reject it told me in his fullness the children of Israel rejected the atonement in its fullness Hebrews 3 tells us that the borderline believers did not enter the promised land because of what unbelief so what does that really mean unbelief because we believe the message we believe the Bible what they believed in Jehovah they saw the the anointing the pillar fire the cloud by day they saw miracles that rock followed then that was Christ the water they it was bitter and then it turned sweet and the manna came down and there was healing their shoes and we're out yes they had relationship with God they knew God to a point amen to a point so what does it mean that they didn't receive the fullness in the toilet what does it mean that they didn't enter in because of their unbelief the Bible says they hardened their hearts from walking in the full Tolman when the word is presented to us and we decide you know what I don't feel I should have to do that what is really happening there's a hardness that begins to work on your heart it's an unbelievable Eve is I don't think I have to do that unbelief they just wanted to be saved from the devil of the world which was feral at that time and that was it they said we'll serve God on this side they were happy to do that they were going to reject God they weren't saying I'm walking away from God and I'm gonna go out back into the world even though some of them talked about it you know I've been better if we were to stay back there at least meet our needs would be met we wouldn't have to have so much faith in God but in reality when they finally came up to it after 40 years they just said you know what we'll serve God over here but they disbelieve to walk in further truth right so if the rapture is taking place right now and God has has a particular relationship with his bride that he doesn't have with the foolish virgins don't compare yourself with others if they don't want to go to church if they don't want to love their brother if they don't want to if they don't want to give their all if they don't want to reach out for souls if they're happy on this side of Jordan if they're just bubbling on this side hey let him be the thing is God is calling his bride to a particular special relationship that he wants to share his throne with and that's what we need to be focusing on because there's many voices out there that's trying to trap trying to get us lukewarm to lay back and not to worry everything's still gonna be ok because you still believe the message well I'm telling you they were all following the messenger of that hour which was Moses and and then then and and then Joshua you know they they did so we can't go by that Amen they thought all they had to do was still do what they have been doing just do what you have been doing you don't need anything else in other words they had all they needed Hebrews chapter 3 verse 10 makes it clear that they did not know the Lord's way and we had a service on that the difference between knowing his acts and knowing his ways and God testifies here that they did not know the Lord's ways in other words Paul said the Lord's ways are stated here in verse 14 the writer of the book of Hebrews we are made partakers of a rapture only if we hold our beginning confidence steadfast to the end now this is the Lord's way he that endureth to the end he that keeps walking in truth not he that just walks in so much truth and says that's good enough I can just you know what I'm just gonna hang it up and I'm gonna do do what I want to do now I got the main as I always loved how brother Marty would say he says an insurance policy dis insurance policy hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear fear for the rod brought that up in her or brother larry the men's mean it was brought up to fear let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it in other words we could miss part of the atonement right they missed the very promise they were just saying they thought the promise was that God was going their whole cry when they were were in Egypt was Lord deliver us from this taskmaster this evil of devil that's messing up my whole life deliver us and he said I've heard the cry of my people I've come down to deliver them but see God had more for them because he made a promise to Abraham four hundred years for 40 years forty years earlier to give you a promised land that floweth with milk and honey but they came short of that promise so they came short of the full at Oak default token the full atonement so what they did is they came up to the border and they rejected the fullness of the atonement that's why we have to understand we have to go spy out the land I'm telling you we need to find out what this Holy Ghost really is it is a joy in the midst of terrible situations it's a it's a joy unspeakable it's a peace that passeth all understanding it's a love where you can love your enemies and we need to spy out the land to see that is the land that flows with milk and honey so when we come up to the border and the preacher tells us we need to get more of the Holy Ghost we don't want to make some excuse and just let that promise being left us we need to fear fear lest a promise being left us Hebrews chapter four verse number nine therefore there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God Amen there's something for the bride there's something for the wise virgin that's not for the foolish think about that now I know in the in the world when we go to funerals and you know this in the majority of the churches they preach you into heaven no matter what life you lived and that same spirit can kind of culminate into the message to where we're just all bright because white because we're in the message when brother Branham he didn't just teach us there are three types of believers in the message he said there are three types of believers in every Church so we can't go by you know just collectively being a part of any one Church anywhere what we do need collectively is to endeavor to keep the right spirit right endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit to be pressing towards these things that were ministry and that the fivefold ministry ministers to yes to believe for one another but you don't just automatically check their bride because if you do that how are you gonna help reconcile your brother how are you gonna disciple somebody if you're always thinking that they're a bride and while God or just have to show them well what's the use of even preach and if God's going to show us everything I mean were you going to take that too so we need one another we need two to help one a burden for one another and to believe that we got to do everything we can to help everyone get in not just those that are that are going to church those that are not going to church I tell you every one of you I'll tell you the bride of Jesus Christ you have brothers and sisters outside of this message they got to come in yet and we need to care about those just as much as we care about the ones that are in amen all right verse number 11 let us know did we do 10 so sorry let's do 10 for he for he that it is entered into his rest he also have seized from his own word as God did from his I just on this little verse I want to share this with you the foolish virgin relied on themselves because they didn't need the Holy Ghost they relied on their that what they had was enough and yes they had some oil but if the oil had its way it would be telling them to get more oil so they relied on their works but to the bride they ceased from their works they're totally in rest with God it's God in them manifesting his life in every situation I love that verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into the rest if we're a laborer for anything let's enter to enter into the rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief in other words I don't think I have to do what that preacher said I don't think I need to do that I'll still be fine if between me and God don't do that that scares me because you're not rejecting the preacher you're rejecting God who sent the preacher - yeah Amen we may not like how he Luxor or certain things but if he's bringing the Word of God that that should be precious to us Amen and to be on it to be honest with you God want you to honor the man amen amen praise the Lord alright well I don't have time to do as much as I wanted to do today but I want to reach you at least a little quote from brother Branham and then it kind of get us ready for perhaps our next service and I don't know if it's going to be this this Sunday if we're just going to try to keep these on on a on a Wednesday no remember next Wednesday's prayer meeting so we won't be having a worships on asking you I'm asking one of you in in your homes to get a tambourine some instrument and to make ready for a worship service to get ready for prayer amen for our prayer means their homes brother Branham said in the message questions and answers number one says please explain fully about the Gentiles that don't go on the rapture brother and says seed the Gentile bride is in heaven and the sleeping virgin the Gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride and she only goes through tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected Christ the word for her purification this is this is really rich and this is what we want to try to get into next time she's rejected Christ the word for her purification there was part of Christ that she was rejecting she accepted part of it but when accept the part where she had to purify herself then she has to suffer for her deeds but the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of Christ because he is the word the body was rendered and when the body was rendered the bride was in that body because it's the word so if I could say it like this the bride she suffers willingly before tribulation before the rapture the foolish version who didn't want to suffer to purify themselves God says you still have to go through it here oh you're not only going to go through it in tribulation but you lose out on being the bride so to two terrible things happen one is through free more agency the other is your you're going to be forced through tribulation to get purified one way or the other it's going to happen it's just it's required so you know there's a lot of people out there a lot of churches that believe that the bride goes through tribulation for purification they have to go through purification but not through tribulation Christ already paid the price form at Calvary when the bride was in there and when he rent her she came out but still she's living in a body of flesh that doesn't want to submit has to die out daily has to deny itself has to crucify has to unconditionally surrender as God points to her this is what you need to do to enter into the promised land you got to kill this giant you got to kill that giant you got to kill these things in your life and enter into more of the Holy Ghost hmm I want to encourage you today to press in to receive more of the Holy Ghost to receive the full the fullness of the atonement that God has for us it'll take us places that we can't go with what we have right now that's why we're in that process right now getting ready and we need more of His Holy Spirit as we spend that time seeking the Lord he will reveal himself in his will for to each of us individually what he wants us to do amen we are the bride and we're just here getting instructions as it were to get ready amen so we can be prepared prepared and we can honestly say we're ready Lord come Lord Jesus amen god bless you let's stand together amen Heavenly Father we thank you once again for your grace and your mercy in our lives for the mercy that rewrote our life that continues over
