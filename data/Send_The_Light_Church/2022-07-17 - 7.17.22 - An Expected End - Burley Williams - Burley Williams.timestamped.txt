[30:52] like the most important things for
[30:54] making this the type of service that god
[30:56] wants us to have
[30:57] i believe he's here you brought him here
[30:59] you could tell in your worship you could
[31:01] tell in your praise
[31:02] that he's here today and i'm expecting
[31:05] him to do great things amen amen uh

[34:50] it's been a long time since we've been
[34:52] up this way
[34:54] and uh
[34:55] thank you
[34:57] but we uh appreciate the opportunity
[35:11] tabernacle
[35:17] so tell them brother battle i can't
[35:18] remember the message
[35:20] uh i think it's uh what is the traction
[35:22] of the mountain
[35:23] you begin to
[35:25] talk about the each one on the radio
[35:26] hookup
[35:28] those involvement and those in a certain
[35:30] place
[35:31] they always say waiting on the coming of
[35:33] the little one amen so that's where we
[35:35] are in south carolina waiting on the
[35:37] covenant of the lord
[35:39] so we know god has a universal bride
[35:47] so we just thank god for his grace and
[35:49] mercy if you will let's turn into our
[35:51] bibles to
[35:52] romans chapter eight
[35:56] and uh we appreciate that john for
[35:58] allowing us to come
[35:59] romans chapter 8 we want to go to verse
[36:01] 35.
[36:10] and
[36:10] uh the scripture says
[36:14] who shall separate us from the love of
[36:16] christ
[36:18] tribulation
[36:20] or distress
[36:21] or persecution
[36:23] of famine
[36:24] our nakedness a pearl
[36:27] a sword
[36:29] as it is written
[36:32] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[36:33] long
[36:34] we are counted as sheep for the
[36:37] slaughter
[36:38] laying all things we are more than
[36:40] conquerors
[36:42] through him that loved us
[36:44] for i am persuaded
[36:46] that neither death
[36:48] nor life
[36:49] nor angels nor principalities
[36:52] nor powers no things present no things
[36:56] to come
[36:57] no height nor death
[36:59] no any other creature
[37:01] shall be able to separate us
[37:03] from the love of god
[37:05] which is in christ jesus so regardless
[37:09] of whatever we go through
[37:11] in daily life
[37:12] thrown down through the years
[37:14] whatever it is it's going to be in the
[37:16] scriptures right there amen amen
[37:20] paul named every one of them amen famine
[37:23] persecution distress
[37:25] pearl he named everything so whatever we
[37:28] go through you can find it
[37:29] right here in the scripture amen let us
[37:32] pray father we just want to thank you
[37:33] for the reading of your word
[37:35] we come before you in harmonies in our
[37:37] heart we ask you to pray to god jesus
[37:39] come and speak to the heart of your
[37:41] children we ask these things father in
[37:43] the name of jesus christ we pray
[37:46] amen you may be seated i also like to
[37:48] turn to the book of jeremiah
[37:52] chapter 29.
[38:06] and uh
[38:19] i think it's jeremiah 29 11.
[38:36] oh got the wrong yeah jeremiah 29
[38:41] let's go to verse 11.
[38:44] for i know the thoughts
[38:46] that i think for toward you
[38:49] says the lord
[38:50] thoughts of peace
[38:52] and not of evil to give you
[38:55] an expected end
[38:57] amen i would like to just uh take a
[39:00] subject from that verse of scripture
[39:02] to give you an unexpected
[39:06] end amen to give you
[39:08] and expect it
[39:10] amen
[39:11] amen
[39:12] i actually uh
[39:14] left my notes on that desk back but
[39:17] we'll just
[39:18] we okay
[39:20] to give you
[39:21] an expected end
[39:23] um
[39:24] the word expected
[39:26] uh is a real interesting word
[39:29] it's a word that means
[39:31] uh something to look forward to
[39:34] amen and it also means uh
[39:37] uh to uh regard the occurrence of
[39:40] something
[39:41] something other word you anticipating
[39:44] looking forward to
[39:46] so god telling the children of israel
[39:48] here
[39:49] that i know the thoughts that i think
[39:51] toward you saith the lord thoughts of
[39:53] peace
[39:54] and not of evil to give you
[39:57] an unexpected end
[40:00] reading the scripture here
[40:03] uh about an expected end
[40:06] we got to look and build up on the
[40:08] situation
[40:09] that is taking place here to see why god
[40:12] is telling them this
[40:15] but we're going to go backwards for a
[40:16] moment and see how it comes up here
[40:19] in jeremiah 29 while the lord is saying
[40:22] this because right here in the scripture
[40:25] that we're reading
[40:26] this is a depressing time
[40:29] for the children of israel
[40:31] they're actually when god is using
[40:34] jeremiah through another servant to tell
[40:37] them this they're actually now there in
[40:39] babylon
[40:41] so that's what we want to uh
[40:43] just kind of build upon this so
[40:47] even though they're in such a depressing
[40:48] time
[40:50] god still to give them an expected end
[40:54] and i can be honest with you uh if you
[40:56] don't have no expectation in life
[40:59] you don't have an expectation in the
[41:00] things of god you will be a depressed
[41:03] person
[41:04] because so the things that is happening
[41:06] you see so many people falling away from
[41:08] the words of life it can get very
[41:10] discouraging and then if you yourself is
[41:14] not looking and having expectations
[41:16] you're going to be depressed
[41:18] and paul said i have no pleasure in
[41:21] people when they fall back paul didn't
[41:22] have no pleasure in those things me
[41:24] myself i hear these things all the time
[41:27] one thing you got to understand about
[41:29] the devil he makes sure negativity be
[41:32] displayed
[41:33] he makes sure negativity be heard and
[41:36] it's for the purpose to discourage the
[41:38] people that hear it but we're in the
[41:40] time brothers and sisters we got to
[41:42] understand prophecy a lot of negative
[41:45] things are happening gonna happen and
[41:48] gonna continue to happen but that has
[41:50] nothing to do with us
[41:52] the bible tells us we need to look up
[41:54] our redemption draw is not
[41:56] so when we're looking at the wrong
[41:57] things amen it'll pull your faith down
[42:00] it'll pull you down so we have to look
[42:02] at the right things
[42:03] because we got to understand the nature
[42:06] and the character of god let me tell you
[42:08] something friend god got no problem
[42:11] putting his children in prison
[42:14] god god don't have a problem having his
[42:17] children go to jail
[42:19] he got no problem putting them in fire
[42:22] he got no problem putting them in line
[42:24] and then that's that's the god we serve
[42:26] he got no problem doing it because the
[42:28] thing of it is he know that's a believer
[42:30] he know they're going to overcome
[42:32] they're going to come out of it
[42:34] can we say man because when god allowed
[42:36] daniel them to go into the lion then the
[42:39] the hebrew boy they go into a fire uh
[42:42] that god wasn't nervous god wasn't
[42:44] biting his fingernails wondering what
[42:45] they was going to do he wasn't wondering
[42:47] what was going to happen to job is joe
[42:49] going to overcome a matter of fact he
[42:51] was bragging on job amen he was telling
[42:54] satan when god told satan do you desire
[42:56] my servant job you got to understand the
[42:59] context of scripture actually what god
[43:01] was telling satan are you sure you want
[43:03] to mess with that one
[43:06] that's what god was telling because you
[43:07] remember god gave satan jokes
[43:09] credentials he said he switched evil
[43:12] he's a perfect ain't nobody like him so
[43:14] he was actually giving the devil a
[43:16] warning do you really want to mess with
[43:18] death you might want to go pick somebody
[43:20] maybe weak in faith but this one is not
[43:22] can we say praise the lord see you have
[43:25] to understand something brother and
[43:26] sisters uh god blacks on his bride
[43:30] god is not nervous wondering are you
[43:32] gonna fall or not
[43:34] that don't bother god because the
[43:35] prophet of god said god in this day and
[43:37] this time is to prove to the devil that
[43:40] the bride is not going to fall like eve
[43:42] have fallen so that is already a
[43:45] prophecy that's been spoken on the bride
[43:47] that she will not fall but people can
[43:50] look around and say but what is going on
[43:52] remember bride won't fall so it's people
[43:54] falling they're not bright
[43:57] come on
[43:58] see what the problem we got around the
[44:00] message you know people don't want to
[44:01] just tell it like it is
[44:03] but i'm just one of the preachers i just
[44:05] tell it like it is i don't worry about
[44:07] who get offended and so forth like that
[44:09] because the word is the word
[44:11] can we say praise the lord many people
[44:13] want to make excuses why people don't
[44:15] left the words of life i don't care what
[44:17] excuse that a person can try to bring me
[44:19] is just only one thing they were never
[44:21] born again because when you were born
[44:23] again you would never walk away from
[44:25] truth
[44:27] can we say ma'am and one thing i'm
[44:28] thankful brother sister i don't
[44:30] understand everything been preached
[44:32] i don't understand everything the
[44:33] prophet said but i believe it
[44:36] can be say amen i might can't explain it
[44:38] but i believe it can we say praise the
[44:40] lord amen that's why we say in this song
[44:43] only believe only believe we don't sing
[44:46] a song only understand only understand
[44:49] it's only believe only believe all
[44:51] things are possible because by us
[44:53] believing in having the right attitude
[44:55] god will give the revelation in the time
[44:58] and season that we need it do you
[44:59] believe that praise the lord let me tell
[45:02] you something brother sister i'm so
[45:03] confident
[45:04] of the things that god is doing today
[45:06] with the bride of jesus christ yeah we
[45:09] are human beings we go through things in
[45:11] life we go through ups and downs we go
[45:13] through trials but you got to realize
[45:15] something that's going to always be
[45:17] because we could never be perfected if
[45:19] we don't go through trial if we don't
[45:21] have trials
[45:22] can we say man trials is not designed to
[45:24] bring us down trials are designed to
[45:27] bring us up when we overcome those
[45:29] things can we say praise the lord now if
[45:32] you think about something you got to
[45:34] remember something brothers and sisters
[45:36] when the devil
[45:38] came to god
[45:39] uh i can't remember exactly the word the
[45:42] prophet used but it was more like uh
[45:46] it was i'm just kind of paraphrasing it
[45:48] was more like god and the devil matter
[45:50] of fact he called it make a deal it was
[45:52] a deal god and satan was making the deal
[45:56] the devil was trying to make a deal with
[45:58] god
[45:59] saying if you do this and do this i
[46:01] could cause joke to fall
[46:03] how job walking around on earth minding
[46:06] his business
[46:08] he don't have a clue
[46:10] god in the devil is talking about him
[46:13] he's just minding his business
[46:15] right but then when satan came you got
[46:18] to remember he asked the devil you know
[46:20] where you come from he said i come to
[46:23] and fro going up and down in the earth
[46:25] what we think the devil was doing
[46:27] walking around seeking who he can devour
[46:30] but the scripture says the devil does
[46:32] not amen uh you know the scripture in
[46:34] peter he only comes but to kill steal
[46:38] and destroy look at the scripture that's
[46:40] the only thing satan got in mind
[46:43] kill steal and destroy he ain't got
[46:45] nothing else in mind but dead
[46:47] because he knows his time is short
[46:51] man that's why the demons when they come
[46:53] up to jesus christ they said come in to
[46:55] torment us before the time and i like
[46:58] and i like how the prophet put it is you
[47:00] come to the uh term before the time
[47:03] because we know that day is coming they
[47:05] know it's an appointed time they are
[47:08] going to be tormented so they want to do
[47:10] all they can do now to try to take
[47:13] people to where they're going amen but
[47:15] you notice uh when when it comes to job
[47:18] and the lord having that conversation
[47:20] what's so interesting now you know the
[47:23] devil and we think we got trials
[47:28] whenever you think you're really going
[47:29] through something just go read the book
[47:30] of job
[47:32] the things that happened in job life it
[47:34] wasn't one once something happened this
[47:37] week and then five months past something
[47:39] that's happened no it all happened in
[47:41] one day
[47:42] back to back joel couldn't even couldn't
[47:45] even never come and tell him your
[47:47] children dead he didn't even get enough
[47:49] chance to even think what happened in
[47:51] this then i'll say another one called
[47:53] message after message after message but
[47:56] in all of that
[47:57] job did not blame god
[48:00] i get nervous when people blame god that
[48:04] that scares me because let me tell you
[48:06] something you can't blame god for
[48:08] nothing because god don't make mistakes
[48:11] everything he do is perfect everything
[48:13] he say is perfect god does not make
[48:16] mistakes we do can we say amen and it's
[48:19] a saying that i always use myself i
[48:21] never ask god why right
[48:24] right this me
[48:25] i never asked god why you doing this to
[48:28] me i don't do things like that whenever
[48:30] i go through something i ask the lord
[48:32] what are you trying to show me because
[48:34] evidently he's trying to show me
[48:36] something because sometimes people be
[48:38] asking why why why you get to a place
[48:40] you start doubting god
[48:44] can we say praise the lord
[48:46] now job i'm so thankful how that uh job
[48:49] remember the devil coming back and forth
[48:51] back and forth to job and then all of a
[48:53] sudden
[48:54] satan seemed that he couldn't shake him
[48:57] but he said but what would a man do for
[48:58] his own life skin for skin now he had to
[49:01] go attack joe's boy they were getting
[49:03] more and more intense couldn't get him
[49:05] through his wife couldn't get him
[49:06] through death of his children and so
[49:08] forth like that but now he said what
[49:10] would a man do for his own life
[49:12] but here's the thing brother and sister
[49:14] satan is so smart
[49:16] he told god i i can't do nothing
[49:21] to this man cause you got a hedge around
[49:23] him
[49:26] satan was so aware of that i cannot
[49:28] touch this man as long as that hedge is
[49:31] there
[49:32] that's why we know the devil can't do
[49:34] nothing to none of us unless god permits
[49:36] it
[49:37] but you got to remember something the
[49:39] devil still got to go he'll still try to
[49:41] go past permission
[49:43] because he's the devil
[49:44] god told him not to take joe's life but
[49:46] he still tried it
[49:48] can we say amen so but this is what i
[49:50] want you to catch
[49:53] god move the hedges
[49:55] say all right satan there he goes
[49:58] sometimes i think we overlook what's
[50:00] taking place in that situation
[50:02] the hedges the devil knew he couldn't go
[50:05] over them so god moved him when god
[50:08] moved him it gave satan the open season
[50:11] can we say man to do whatever he wanted
[50:13] to do to job but this is what you need
[50:15] to catch job still never cursed god when
[50:19] god satan knew those hedges was
[50:22] protection so when they was moved he
[50:24] went right in let me tell you something
[50:26] friends god has now in this day and time
[50:30] removed the hedges from the bride and
[50:32] i'm going to explain what i mean about
[50:34] that because as long as the hedges is
[50:36] there the devil couldn't get to him but
[50:39] job was able to whip the devil without
[50:42] god's help
[50:45] come on now
[50:46] i hope y'all catching what i'm saying
[50:48] when god moved the hedges the devil had
[50:50] could do whatever he wanted to do to job
[50:52] but it didn't make joke fall he joe
[50:55] literally whipped the devil without
[50:57] god's help
[51:00] can we say man and that ought to be the
[51:02] same thing see you and me our hedge is
[51:05] our comfort zones long is everything's
[51:07] going right the way we think it's
[51:09] supposed to be we feel so strong and so
[51:12] protected that we're just really just on
[51:14] our mountain high that's protect that's
[51:16] hedges
[51:17] when everything is going right can we
[51:19] say man but then when things start going
[51:21] wrong what's going on what's going on no
[51:23] i'm here to tell you we by the grace of
[51:26] god by knowing the word is in you
[51:29] knowing what to do with the world you
[51:31] still either with the devil even if
[51:34] you're not anointed
[51:37] you don't have to be anointed to whip
[51:39] the devil
[51:40] you just got to know what the word says
[51:42] to whip the devil
[51:43] can we say praise the lord like the
[51:45] prophet of god amen he said one time he
[51:48] dropped the children off at school amen
[51:50] and when he dropped them off the devil
[51:52] came right to his conscience
[51:54] the devil came to his conscience and
[51:56] said this jesus he's nobody no different
[51:59] than billy ground or r robinson he said
[52:02] he's like a man in their day he was a
[52:05] people began to know him he had some
[52:07] kind of great following he said this
[52:08] jesus is no different than oral robinson
[52:12] and then the prophet said you that is
[52:14] speaking to my conscience
[52:17] he said well who is it that the prophets
[52:19] talked about way back thousands and
[52:21] hundreds of years ago and it came to
[52:23] pass he began to just tell him the word
[52:25] who was it then he said now who he
[52:28] promised that he was going to give me
[52:30] the people of the holy ghost in this day
[52:32] and the prophet said and i got it
[52:34] he said and i got it and he said when he
[52:36] began to tell the devil those things he
[52:38] said then he left
[52:40] he wasn't anointed but he whipped the
[52:42] devil in a conscious battle and that's
[52:44] what so many people follow is the
[52:46] greatest battles fought in the mind
[52:48] they're falling in their mind
[52:51] amen he wasn't even anointed
[52:54] a conscience battle battle in the
[52:56] conscience and he said satan he said
[52:58] then he left
[53:01] amen that's why i make the statement
[53:03] that i made when you know what the word
[53:05] says whether you are anointed or not you
[53:07] can still whip the devil can we say amen
[53:10] go back to the message to be certain of
[53:11] god that's why when you're going through
[53:13] something in life he said the prophet
[53:15] will you don't turn over every stone in
[53:17] your life and god still don't move
[53:22] he said that's when you got to be
[53:24] certain of god and ain't got nothing to
[53:27] do with feelings emotion in sight it got
[53:29] nothing to do with that it got to do
[53:31] where is your faith in your faith in the
[53:33] promises of god what he had promised
[53:35] that he was going to do that's where our
[53:37] faith would be amen let me tell you if
[53:40] we was anointed every day
[53:42] if we felt god presence every day we
[53:45] would be a bunch of lazy christians
[53:51] you would be a bunch of we will because
[53:53] you'll be so used to it used to just
[53:55] relax and lay back god don't do it like
[53:58] that that's why sometimes you go you can
[54:00] go months
[54:01] you can go several months seven months
[54:04] feel no anointing
[54:06] huh but what keeps you going is faith
[54:10] because faith has no feelings or
[54:11] emotions
[54:12] what keeps you going i love the lord i
[54:15] know i love the lord i know he's with me
[54:17] because he said he would never leave me
[54:19] nor forsake me even though you might
[54:21] feel forsaken the devil tried to get you
[54:23] to think that but your faith in the word
[54:26] no god promised he would never leave you
[54:30] that's exactly right
[54:32] can we say praise the lord
[54:34] god is still here amen god is still
[54:36] doing the same thing that he already
[54:38] done but we get our eyes on the wrong
[54:41] things so many times
[54:43] amen i want you to do do me a favor
[54:46] let's turn back i want to show you
[54:47] something we're going to build up to
[54:49] jeremiah chapter 29.
[54:52] let's go to jeremiah chapter 21.
[55:06] i hope you ain't saying why this fella
[55:08] coming out pretty hard no i preach like
[55:09] this all the time
[55:12] i've been sending the lord 35 years
[55:14] and i love him
[55:16] and i got no desire
[55:18] to go back into the things of this world
[55:20] it ain't even there
[55:22] came and said praise the lord i was
[55:24] talking to a guy
[55:25] and uh he some guy had used profanity
[55:28] and i said brother i said listen friend
[55:30] i said i don't use that type of language
[55:32] i said it's been 30 over 30 something
[55:34] years for stuff like that come out of my
[55:35] mouth people get shocked at you what i
[55:38] don't believe
[55:39] based on what you believe
[55:41] it's what i believe
[55:43] it's not based on what somebody else
[55:44] believes about me or think about me is
[55:46] what i believe
[55:47] can we say man people don't people see
[55:50] you got sometimes people because they
[55:53] can't live a certain level in their life
[55:56] they they want to make you think you got
[55:57] to stay down and where they are no you
[55:59] don't have to i believe in a god that
[56:02] brings total deliverance
[56:04] can we say amen that's what i believe in
[56:07] but you go like the prophet said some
[56:09] people want to be halfway christians
[56:11] he's the god i don't want you to be a
[56:12] halfway christian but some people do
[56:15] but i i want to be a all the way
[56:17] christian
[56:18] can we say praise the lord let me tell
[56:20] you something friends the devil uh
[56:22] there's something very interesting i've
[56:24] just been reading and i have to keep
[56:26] going over it's a question announces how
[56:28] the prophet began to talk about how the
[56:30] devil tried to trap a person
[56:32] he said one thing about satan
[56:34] amen if he can plant something in your
[56:37] life if you ain't got the holy ghost but
[56:40] if he can plant something in your life
[56:42] that is wrong but then keep you in
[56:45] church keep you going to church but
[56:47] still with no holy ghost he said that's
[56:49] what the devil will try to hold you
[56:51] until you die
[56:53] because he said he know you're not born
[56:55] again he still got you but he'll still
[56:58] let you be religious until you die
[57:02] see a lot of things people don't
[57:03] understand about satan too now when it
[57:06] comes to somebody in this message i'm
[57:08] just gonna be flat honest with you when
[57:10] it comes to somebody in this message the
[57:13] devil is more interested
[57:15] than you backsliding then killing you
[57:17] yeah all right
[57:20] that's true
[57:21] well let me explain it to you
[57:24] satan
[57:25] they did why then all of the problems
[57:28] sampson called them
[57:31] samson calls them
[57:32] why did they just immediately kill them
[57:34] when they got him
[57:38] they could've
[57:40] but they just put his eyes out
[57:43] he wasn't more victory
[57:46] to them
[57:47] walking around defeated
[57:50] than them just killing them
[57:54] devil is the same way the devil get more
[57:56] glory out of a backslider
[57:59] than just killing somebody he would
[58:01] rather have somebody that don't left the
[58:03] words of life still walking around in a
[58:06] defeated life so he can punt his finger
[58:08] to make sport just like they did samson
[58:11] say look at them they was in the message
[58:12] so many years they failed so the message
[58:14] must be wrong the devil get more glory
[58:16] out of that
[58:19] can we say praise the lord
[58:21] i'm just trying to be honest with you
[58:22] friends all this negativity the devil
[58:25] got a bunch of trophies walking around
[58:27] amen they thought oh since i left this
[58:30] message and the bible don't come a new
[58:32] book to me i said that's a lie when you
[58:34] left this message the bible become
[58:36] veiled to you
[58:38] this message would open our eyes to the
[58:40] bible
[58:42] but the devil got people so deceived now
[58:46] my goodness but you know god's gonna
[58:49] have a bride
[58:51] yes sir it's going to be a rapture it's
[58:54] going to be a bride and it's going to be
[58:55] a very few
[58:58] are you with me amen praise the lord now
[59:01] jeremiah 21
[59:05] let's go to verse 1.
[59:07] now i want to explain some things
[59:10] about god
[59:13] first of all
[59:14] we know
[59:18] is not going to compromise
[59:20] with his word
[59:22] for nobody
[59:24] amen
[59:25] it just it ain't going to happen
[59:27] he ain't going to change his word
[59:29] for nobody make no difference how much
[59:31] he loves us he ain't going to change his
[59:32] word
[59:34] amen
[59:35] but if you i want to show you
[59:39] god is so merciful
[59:42] that even when people fall
[59:44] but yet they steal his elect they're
[59:46] going to pay for what they've done
[59:48] but god is so merciful he's going to
[59:51] bring him back some kind of way
[59:53] but they got to go through things he
[59:55] will bring them back
[59:57] we know the pattern of scripture how
[59:59] that the children of israel natural
[1:00:01] journey is our spiritual journey that's
[1:00:04] why it's the types and shadows we always
[1:00:06] go back and we follow types and shadows
[1:00:09] to see how god done things then we have
[1:00:11] an understanding of what he's doing
[1:00:13] today and i'm so thankful like the
[1:00:15] prophet said if god saved one man one
[1:00:17] way the next man that come up on the
[1:00:20] same basis god have to do it again
[1:00:22] i'm thankful that he does that now the
[1:00:24] children of israel
[1:00:26] they constantly in the time of jeremiah
[1:00:29] jeremiah
[1:00:31] i know why they didn't like jeremiah
[1:00:34] because jeremiah always rebuked them
[1:00:38] but he couldn't he had no choice
[1:00:41] but to keep rebuking them
[1:00:43] how many of you know how old jeremiah
[1:00:45] was in jeremiah chapter one
[1:00:47] jeremiah was around when god called
[1:00:50] jeremiah if you do your research on
[1:00:52] chapter jeremiah chapter one jeremiah
[1:00:56] actually was the son was around the same
[1:00:58] time with josiah
[1:01:00] that was on the scene at the same time
[1:01:03] jeremiah josiah daniel and the hebrew
[1:01:07] boy when god dealt with them they was
[1:01:09] just children
[1:01:11] they were not old men
[1:01:16] daniel chapter one
[1:01:17] uh meshach wrapped in the bishop which
[1:01:19] is not their real name
[1:01:21] that's the name babylon gave them right
[1:01:24] daniel that was brother branham said in
[1:01:26] the message daniel 70 weeks he said they
[1:01:29] was around the age of 14.
[1:01:32] now you go back and read daniel chapter
[1:01:34] one it said uh the king asked for
[1:01:38] certain children of the children of
[1:01:40] israel that goes to show you they were
[1:01:41] just children a lot of time we read
[1:01:43] daniel we think that oh daniel oh no
[1:01:46] when you get up in daniel chapter 8 and
[1:01:48] chapter 9 daniel is an old man but in
[1:01:50] the beginning he was a child
[1:01:52] no more than 14 years old
[1:01:55] josiah he become a king eight years old
[1:01:58] his eyes become open when he was 26
[1:02:00] years old all of these things god
[1:02:02] showing god was dealing with children
[1:02:05] it wasn't old he got them while they
[1:02:07] were young but as they grew up they gave
[1:02:09] they gained wisdom amen now jeremiah was
[1:02:12] just a child that's why he uh god would
[1:02:15] tell jeremiah don't be afraid of their
[1:02:17] faces because he was just a child
[1:02:19] timothy was a young man paul said don't
[1:02:21] let them despise your youth i try to
[1:02:23] preach these things and let young people
[1:02:25] go i got something for you you ain't got
[1:02:27] to be old waiting to get old to be used
[1:02:29] by god god can use you when you're young
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:33] so jeremiah all he can do is rebuke
[1:02:38] because why the children of israel had
[1:02:41] went away from the word of god start
[1:02:44] serving other gods jeremiah had no
[1:02:46] choice but to rebuke them because that
[1:02:48] was god wanted to tell them amen
[1:02:51] are you with me
[1:02:53] now when god does something
[1:02:57] and don't
[1:02:58] spoke something prophesied something
[1:03:00] can't nothing change it
[1:03:02] they knew out of all of this uh
[1:03:05] preaching that jeremiah was doing they
[1:03:07] knew the king of babylon was coming
[1:03:10] amen but i want to read something to you
[1:03:12] let's go to jeremiah 21 and
[1:03:15] the word came unto jeremiah from the
[1:03:17] lord
[1:03:19] with king zedekiah sent unto him pastor
[1:03:22] the son of melchio and zephaniah the son
[1:03:25] of messiah the priest saying
[1:03:29] inquire pray thee
[1:03:31] of the lord for us see now they want
[1:03:34] jeremiah to pray for them
[1:03:38] he said
[1:03:39] for nebuchadnezzar king of babylon make
[1:03:42] his war against us it shall be that the
[1:03:45] lord would deal with us
[1:03:47] according to all his wonderful wondrous
[1:03:50] works that he may go up from us but now
[1:03:54] they wanted jeremiah to pray for them
[1:03:57] but they've been rejected in the word
[1:03:59] now they want mercy but they've been
[1:04:01] rejecting the word
[1:04:03] now watch this verse three
[1:04:05] then said jeremiah unto them
[1:04:08] dust shall you say to
[1:04:10] zedekiah thus says the lord god of
[1:04:13] israel
[1:04:15] behold
[1:04:16] i will turn my back the weapons of war
[1:04:19] that are in your hands
[1:04:21] wherewith you fight against the king of
[1:04:23] babylon against the child thens which
[1:04:26] besiege you without the walls and i will
[1:04:29] assemble them in the midst of this city
[1:04:32] now i know what god is telling them
[1:04:34] yo that nebuchadnezzar is coming
[1:04:37] but your weapons won't work against
[1:04:39] nebuchadnezzar because i'll make sure
[1:04:41] your weapons don't work
[1:04:45] praise the lord look out america
[1:04:48] bragging on that military right right
[1:04:51] i talked to a military guy one time
[1:04:54] he's uh
[1:04:56] the guy with the these apache
[1:04:58] helicopters and stuff
[1:04:59] and i talked to him i said i said i said
[1:05:02] who do we fear
[1:05:04] they said
[1:05:05] america we fear nobody they shared it
[1:05:07] with pride
[1:05:09] he said the only country that we might
[1:05:11] be a
[1:05:12] afraid of he said but not firepower he
[1:05:16] said manpower i said who is that he's in
[1:05:18] china
[1:05:19] he's because they got more and they
[1:05:20] armor than we do he said it'd be
[1:05:22] manpower and i was just sitting back to
[1:05:24] myself you just don't realize
[1:05:26] what's coming to america
[1:05:29] out of all her bragging she do on her
[1:05:31] weapons when god anoint russia to do
[1:05:34] what she's going to do it's going to be
[1:05:36] just like here in jeremiah time america
[1:05:39] weapons won't work
[1:05:41] when god anoints something to happen
[1:05:43] he's the one that stops it he's the one
[1:05:45] that starts it god is the one that does
[1:05:48] those things right because you got to
[1:05:50] remember they rejected the word of god
[1:05:52] god put it in nebuchadnezzar's heart to
[1:05:55] go down there and bring them captivity
[1:05:57] and the same thing going to happen today
[1:05:59] god's going to put it in russia hard to
[1:06:01] come over here and bomb america nobody
[1:06:04] can stop this it's gonna happen
[1:06:07] can we say amen remember russia putin
[1:06:10] them they just that symbol of a bear
[1:06:12] what does a bear do it hibernates but
[1:06:14] when it comes out of hibernation it
[1:06:16] devours and this barrier is coming out
[1:06:18] of hibernation starting to devour
[1:06:21] america gots it coming she got it coming
[1:06:23] and ain't nothing going to be able to
[1:06:25] stop her i don't care what kind of new
[1:06:27] weapons they get it does not matter the
[1:06:30] same thing happened to nebuchadnezzar
[1:06:31] the prophet said they built those big
[1:06:33] old walls then you could have chariot
[1:06:35] races go around and there was so much
[1:06:37] pride in their security but they didn't
[1:06:39] realize the needs of person went under
[1:06:41] the wall
[1:06:43] can we say man when god put something in
[1:06:46] somebody's heart it's going to take
[1:06:47] place let me tell you something friend
[1:06:49] sometimes god allow somebody to dislike
[1:06:53] you
[1:06:56] you could ask yourself i've never done
[1:06:58] unto this person why did they treat me
[1:07:00] like that why did they talk to me like
[1:07:02] that i don't understand what did i do
[1:07:04] you could even go try to talk to them
[1:07:06] please with you they still don't like
[1:07:08] you god allowed that to happen for a
[1:07:11] purpose
[1:07:12] and i guarantee you it is to get to you
[1:07:14] not them
[1:07:17] amen
[1:07:18] yes
[1:07:19] sir praise the lord
[1:07:21] it's exactly right remember in
[1:07:24] revelation he gonna put it in them
[1:07:26] hearts to hate the
[1:07:29] they'll agree with her a while but when
[1:07:31] god put it in the heart to hate them you
[1:07:33] can't change it
[1:07:35] exactly right said your weapons
[1:07:39] i would turn back the weapons of war
[1:07:42] that are in your hands
[1:07:44] in other words your weapons will not
[1:07:46] work when nebuchadnezzar come down there
[1:07:49] you think they now they told jeremiah to
[1:07:51] pray
[1:07:52] but look what jeremiah telling them
[1:07:54] they what they wanted to hear
[1:07:57] he said verse five
[1:07:59] listen what god telling israel
[1:08:01] and
[1:08:02] i
[1:08:04] myself
[1:08:05] will fight against you
[1:08:08] with an outstretched hand and with a
[1:08:11] strong arm even in anger and in fear and
[1:08:15] in great wrath
[1:08:17] now jeremiah telling the children of
[1:08:19] israel that like
[1:08:21] whoo
[1:08:22] i don't know about you fred i don't want
[1:08:23] god fighting against me
[1:08:26] i don't want his wrath
[1:08:28] i want his mercy
[1:08:30] that's what i want his mercy
[1:08:33] amen
[1:08:34] now jeremiah telling them that
[1:08:36] they asked the brother for a prayer but
[1:08:38] they get a rebuke
[1:08:41] hey being a pastor that happens
[1:08:42] sometimes sometimes people say will you
[1:08:44] pray for me pastor i say what's the
[1:08:45] problem and then when they start telling
[1:08:47] me the problem i rebuke them because
[1:08:49] there's something that they don't done
[1:08:50] now you want me to pray for something
[1:08:51] you don't done that's why the bible say
[1:08:53] lay hands on the one suddenly
[1:08:55] because sometimes people want you to
[1:08:56] bless something that they doing wrong
[1:08:58] but they want you to pray and bless them
[1:09:00] right
[1:09:00] that's why i ask questions
[1:09:04] amen that's right
[1:09:06] i was in a situation when timing
[1:09:08] i was preaching overseas a lady come up
[1:09:11] to the altar
[1:09:12] and uh she said uh
[1:09:15] would you pray for me
[1:09:16] i said hmm what's the problem
[1:09:21] see i need you to pray for me and my
[1:09:22] friend
[1:09:24] it's okay
[1:09:26] what's the problem she said things just
[1:09:28] not right and i just need you to pray
[1:09:31] i said i felt funny i said uh
[1:09:35] what's wrong with her
[1:09:36] she oh it's him
[1:09:39] she asked her
[1:09:41] to get her to respond back
[1:09:43] she said him
[1:09:44] that's okay
[1:09:46] what's the what's the deal and then all
[1:09:48] of a sudden
[1:09:49] i just felt so funny
[1:09:52] and here i am this woman is standing in
[1:09:54] front of me
[1:09:56] we're standing in front of the pool pit
[1:09:58] and a pastor was behind the pulpit
[1:10:01] singing while we were having prayer
[1:10:03] and then all of a sudden
[1:10:06] she pointed at the pastor
[1:10:08] she said i hate him
[1:10:11] i said you hate who
[1:10:14] pastors that had his eyes closed and
[1:10:16] sang his heart out and didn't know he
[1:10:18] had a sheep he hated them
[1:10:21] i said sister you do need prayer
[1:10:23] i said you need a lot of prayer
[1:10:25] cause you got a problem
[1:10:27] then i found out later on
[1:10:29] oh i didn't pray for her friend because
[1:10:32] what it was god is god is good
[1:10:36] she was trying to get me to pray for her
[1:10:38] friend that is already married and them
[1:10:40] two trying to get married she was trying
[1:10:41] to get me to pray over an adulterous
[1:10:43] situation
[1:10:46] god is good
[1:10:48] so i pray for her soul
[1:10:51] not for her friend
[1:10:53] so i found out later i talked to the
[1:10:55] pastor i
[1:10:56] said i saw her
[1:10:59] he said what you mean
[1:11:01] she got a problem he's old brother she
[1:11:03] just mad at me she tried she said this
[1:11:05] man he's married and she's just trying
[1:11:08] to get me to marry them and i won't do
[1:11:10] it that's why she hated him
[1:11:13] the bible said lay hands on new ones
[1:11:15] suddenly
[1:11:17] that's why sometimes when people want
[1:11:18] you to pray for them you feel that
[1:11:19] little check
[1:11:20] it's best to ask questions
[1:11:23] because sometimes god can put you
[1:11:25] remember the prophet of god says this
[1:11:27] sometimes god can put something on
[1:11:29] somebody and because of you praying you
[1:11:31] can take it off of him he said then
[1:11:33] you'll have to answer for it
[1:11:35] that's right
[1:11:37] i just believe what he said
[1:11:39] can we say amen praise the lord so you
[1:11:42] pray for me i said what's the problem i
[1:11:43] want to see let's go into detail what we
[1:11:45] need to pray about what's going on let
[1:11:48] me tell you sometimes people are just
[1:11:49] like children
[1:11:51] adults
[1:11:53] you know when you got children in the
[1:11:55] home let's say you got three or five
[1:11:58] and uh
[1:11:59] when one of the children
[1:12:00] gets out of fellowship
[1:12:02] with mom and dad
[1:12:04] they don't done something wrong their
[1:12:05] conscience is guilty they know their
[1:12:07] conscience is guilty but then all of a
[1:12:09] sudden they want something from mom or
[1:12:11] dad
[1:12:12] that child will not approach mom and dad
[1:12:15] themselves
[1:12:16] they will find out which sibling still
[1:12:19] has a relationship ain't done nothing
[1:12:20] with mom and dad they'll go to the
[1:12:22] sibling and say would you go ask mom and
[1:12:25] dad can we go here and do this
[1:12:27] they'll take the child that got a
[1:12:28] fellowship with mom and dad
[1:12:30] and then they'll go ask him
[1:12:33] because they got no
[1:12:34] fellowship you got people just like that
[1:12:37] when they know they backslid and got no
[1:12:38] fellowship with god they'll look for
[1:12:40] somebody they know they can talk to god
[1:12:42] got fellowship with god they say will
[1:12:44] you pray for me
[1:12:46] because they got no relationship with
[1:12:47] them
[1:12:48] when we all ourselves personally ought
[1:12:50] to have a relationship with him we can
[1:12:52] go straight through the throne ourselves
[1:12:55] without condemnation that's the way it's
[1:12:57] supposed to be
[1:13:00] praise the lord amen
[1:13:03] man my daughter my younger one she used
[1:13:05] to give him she used to give her
[1:13:06] brothers away it's just the way she'll
[1:13:08] just say she just said daddy they told
[1:13:10] me to ask you
[1:13:16] somewhere praise the lord
[1:13:19] let's keep going
[1:13:24] verse six
[1:13:26] he said i will smite the inhabitants of
[1:13:28] the city
[1:13:30] man and beast they shall die
[1:13:33] of a great pestilence
[1:13:35] and after what says the lord
[1:13:37] i will deliver zedekiah king of judah
[1:13:40] and his servants and the people and such
[1:13:43] as are left in the city from the
[1:13:46] pestilence from the sword and from the
[1:13:48] famine into the hands of nebuchadnezzar
[1:13:51] king of babylon and into the hand of
[1:13:53] their enemies and unto the hands of
[1:13:55] those that seek their life he shall
[1:13:57] smite them with the edge of the sword he
[1:13:59] shall not spare them neither have pity
[1:14:03] nor have mercy
[1:14:06] and in this people thus shall thou say
[1:14:08] thus says the lord
[1:14:10] listen what god is telling them behold i
[1:14:13] set before you the way of life
[1:14:16] and the way of death notice god telling
[1:14:19] them everything he's going to do to them
[1:14:22] but it's their fault
[1:14:24] because they kept rejecting the word but
[1:14:27] listen what he tells them what he's
[1:14:29] going to do listen now he says this
[1:14:32] verse 8 again
[1:14:34] say this to this people thus says the
[1:14:36] lord behold i set before you the way of
[1:14:39] life
[1:14:40] and the way of death
[1:14:43] now god gonna tell them how they can
[1:14:45] live or how they're gonna die right he
[1:14:47] says
[1:14:48] he that abideth in the city
[1:14:51] shall die by the sword
[1:14:53] by the famine and by the passionate but
[1:14:56] he that goeth out and falls to the child
[1:14:58] deadens
[1:14:59] that beseech you he shall live and his
[1:15:02] life shall be on him to him for a prayer
[1:15:05] so now god said if you want to live you
[1:15:07] got to be in the hands of the enemy
[1:15:12] but if you stay here you're going to die
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:14] i'm going to show you something
[1:15:17] sometimes
[1:15:18] god will leave you
[1:15:20] in a bad situation
[1:15:23] to keep you alive
[1:15:26] amen
[1:15:27] amen i just let the scripture prove
[1:15:30] some of you like
[1:15:34] oh no about that one well the bible's
[1:15:36] full of those i could name the new
[1:15:38] testament within the old testament the
[1:15:40] bible's full of god got ways to keep you
[1:15:42] humble
[1:15:45] he got ways of doing it sometimes you
[1:15:47] might be something in your life you just
[1:15:49] can't get out of it it could be simply
[1:15:51] because god keeping it there to keep you
[1:15:53] humble
[1:15:54] the same as he done paul paul you
[1:15:56] remember paul i prayed to god three
[1:15:58] times he would not remove this from me
[1:16:01] and then he said paul my grace is
[1:16:03] sufficient for you so other words god
[1:16:05] kept that thorn in paul flesh he sent us
[1:16:08] enemy from the devil to buffet me in my
[1:16:11] flesh god son of devil to keep bothering
[1:16:14] paul in his flesh for what purpose to
[1:16:17] keep paul humble
[1:16:20] so god can put you in bad situations
[1:16:23] leave you there to keep you humble
[1:16:25] you can pray all you want you to try to
[1:16:27] get out of it god said no until i get
[1:16:29] what i want out of you i will not
[1:16:30] release this problem
[1:16:34] can we say amen even paul even though
[1:16:37] god keeps him humble you keep reading
[1:16:39] paul's teachings
[1:16:41] paul knew amen at one time paul
[1:16:44] everything was going good paul even said
[1:16:47] himself though i desire
[1:16:50] to glory
[1:16:52] i won't be a fool
[1:16:54] otherwise paul says i'm feeling pretty
[1:16:56] good about myself i want to lift myself
[1:16:58] up a little bit he said i desired that
[1:16:59] but let me humble myself because i ain't
[1:17:01] going to be a fool
[1:17:03] oh i wish preachers in the message would
[1:17:04] catch that revelation they want to walk
[1:17:06] around some pride everybody love them
[1:17:08] want to tell them how good they preach
[1:17:10] walk around where their chest all stuck
[1:17:12] out that preacher's on his way down
[1:17:17] god's supposed to get the glory
[1:17:19] and you can't hide it i don't care who
[1:17:21] the preacher is you can't hide it when
[1:17:22] you got them prior spirits on you you
[1:17:24] cannot hide pride
[1:17:26] you know one thing people can't hide
[1:17:28] pride for me
[1:17:30] i'm gonna tell you why cause i used to
[1:17:32] have pride real bad
[1:17:37] oh i did i used to have it real bad
[1:17:39] that's why it's hard to hide it for me i
[1:17:41] can look at some most of the preachers i
[1:17:43] look at him sometimes
[1:17:45] i know what's gonna happen to you god
[1:17:47] gonna bring you down that servant of god
[1:17:50] cause he did it to me
[1:17:55] you gotta humble
[1:17:56] yourself god does some things to me did
[1:17:59] i like it no
[1:18:01] i sure didn't but i loved him i always
[1:18:04] one of my favorite saying people said
[1:18:05] how do you know god love you i said man
[1:18:07] the way he beats me you know i know he
[1:18:09] loved me
[1:18:11] he corrects me the things he do i said
[1:18:13] no he loves me
[1:18:15] because if he didn't love me he wouldn't
[1:18:16] even care to correct me
[1:18:21] that's right
[1:18:22] listen what he says
[1:18:27] verse 10
[1:18:29] for i have set my face against the city
[1:18:31] for evil
[1:18:33] not for good says the lord
[1:18:35] it shall be given into the hand of the
[1:18:36] king of babylon and he shall burn it
[1:18:40] with fire
[1:18:42] and touching the house of the king of
[1:18:43] judah says
[1:18:44] hear you the word of the lord o house of
[1:18:47] david thus says the lord execute
[1:18:49] judgment in the morning deliver him that
[1:18:51] is fall out of the hand of the oppressor
[1:18:54] let my fury go out like fire and burn
[1:18:55] that nun can quench it because of the
[1:18:58] evil
[1:18:59] of your doings
[1:19:01] god said i'm doing this it's because of
[1:19:04] the evils of your doings
[1:19:06] this is why this is happening
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:10] all of this is leading up
[1:19:12] to jeremiah chapter 29.
[1:19:15] i'm trying to show you i got i'm going
[1:19:17] to show you in a moment why god is
[1:19:19] turning for you could have an unexpected
[1:19:21] end
[1:19:22] so now let's just flip to that
[1:19:25] let's go back to
[1:19:26] jeremiah chapter 29.
[1:19:30] you remember jeremiah went through a lot
[1:19:33] one came down and told them we're not
[1:19:35] going to be in there in those 70 years
[1:19:37] we'll be down there so many years and
[1:19:39] then uh like how the prophet said
[1:19:40] jeremiah didn't even argue jeremiah just
[1:19:42] said amen
[1:19:43] because he knew what god told him was
[1:19:45] true i like that if you know what god
[1:19:48] tells you is true why argue with
[1:19:49] somebody
[1:19:51] i don't even argue about the message
[1:19:53] right i don't especially the ones that
[1:19:55] don't laugh it they want to well do they
[1:19:57] do that that's it
[1:20:00] what are you talking to me for
[1:20:04] oh i get some i get a i got a nasty
[1:20:06] email they want them to tell me what
[1:20:07] they name i get these little emails i
[1:20:09] don't even know how to get my email
[1:20:10] address
[1:20:12] they be texting emailing me you
[1:20:13] preaching this false william browning
[1:20:15] stuff and blah blah blah yadda i just
[1:20:18] text them back
[1:20:19] and uh i text them back and i emailed
[1:20:22] them back you know i just returned the
[1:20:23] email they said you need to repent of
[1:20:25] the thing that you're preaching i just
[1:20:26] said uh well
[1:20:27] all right i just got in
[1:20:29] i just took the scripture in the book of
[1:20:31] acts and when it says uh when gamalia
[1:20:34] said you may be refrained from touching
[1:20:35] these men
[1:20:37] he said if this is of god it'll come to
[1:20:38] knock he said but if it's of god you're
[1:20:40] gonna find yourself fighting against god
[1:20:42] so i i paste that scripture to them and
[1:20:45] i said won't you have a little bit of
[1:20:46] gamalia sense
[1:20:50] amen i said you ain't even got to mail
[1:20:52] your sense
[1:20:53] i said this message is not of god it
[1:20:56] will fall
[1:20:57] but it happened
[1:20:59] and it won't
[1:21:01] so they're fighting against god
[1:21:03] have a little camellia since and i told
[1:21:05] them i don't know who you are i don't
[1:21:07] care to know who you are i said but i
[1:21:09] ain't got no time for you going back and
[1:21:11] forth this message is real to me if it
[1:21:13] ain't real to you fine go right on and
[1:21:16] the question i asked them i said you
[1:21:18] don't left the message why you keep
[1:21:19] following my sermons
[1:21:22] you must like what i'm preaching come on
[1:21:25] won't you just go you're gonna go go
[1:21:32] i refuse to debate with somebody about
[1:21:34] the message
[1:21:36] i refuse it's different
[1:21:39] if they question me wanting to know
[1:21:41] something maybe confused
[1:21:44] i i'll sit and i'll go back and forth
[1:21:46] with them but once i see that little
[1:21:48] spirit they really just want to debate
[1:21:50] don't really want to learn nothing i
[1:21:52] have no time for it i just don't have no
[1:21:54] time for it i go right back what paul
[1:21:56] said if they want to be ignorant let
[1:21:57] them be ignorant and i'll move right
[1:21:58] apart move on
[1:22:03] praise the lord you know some of us
[1:22:05] become superheroes say
[1:22:07] oh
[1:22:09] maybe that pastor that it was on to hurt
[1:22:11] them
[1:22:12] i think i can help him
[1:22:14] let him come to me
[1:22:15] oh go right over here hero
[1:22:20] go right on the head
[1:22:22] and when you get there and try to be the
[1:22:23] hero then you're going to find out you
[1:22:25] play with fire you get burnt
[1:22:28] i don't try to be no superhero
[1:22:30] no
[1:22:31] praise the lord that's just i'm just as
[1:22:33] honest the person you probably ever with
[1:22:35] me
[1:22:35] that's why when people try to come to my
[1:22:37] church i let them come three times after
[1:22:40] that third time i said
[1:22:42] who you
[1:22:44] where you from
[1:22:46] who who you pastor where you come from
[1:22:48] oh why do you leave that church
[1:22:50] huh did you leave right
[1:22:52] are you in good standing no no bad blood
[1:22:55] huh i asked questions
[1:22:58] they'd be getting mad too that let me
[1:23:00] know they wrong when they get mad
[1:23:02] but i just came on i just wanted to come
[1:23:03] and hear the word of god and no no
[1:23:05] that's fine but i'm asking you some
[1:23:07] questions you ain't doing it wrong
[1:23:08] you've got no problem answering the
[1:23:09] question
[1:23:12] that's the fail that's the same way i
[1:23:13] feel about boys when they want like a
[1:23:15] man daughter if they want to like a man
[1:23:17] daughter they got no problem they may
[1:23:18] ask some questions right right if they
[1:23:20] got problem the man asking questions
[1:23:22] he's up to no good he need to go
[1:23:24] because one thing about christianity
[1:23:26] when you got nothing to hide you ain't
[1:23:27] got no problem nobody asking you
[1:23:28] questions
[1:23:30] they don't bother you say what do you
[1:23:31] want to
[1:23:32] know huh but now sometimes people get
[1:23:35] too personal to them nosy people
[1:23:38] you have to reboot those
[1:23:42] that's exactly right
[1:23:44] let me get back to this
[1:23:47] and in jeremiah chapter 29
[1:23:52] you got to catch this
[1:23:54] now they are in babylon
[1:23:58] they've been carried away
[1:24:00] they are down there in babylon
[1:24:05] if i could paint a picture to you
[1:24:09] if you could just think about a sad
[1:24:11] moment
[1:24:12] that you don't had in your own life
[1:24:15] of depression
[1:24:18] distress don't just can't even find a
[1:24:20] way out
[1:24:23] if you can just think of that
[1:24:25] and magnify that a thousand times
[1:24:28] it'll put you here in babylon now
[1:24:32] they've been taking the tablet the
[1:24:34] temple has been burnt down
[1:24:37] they've been taken out of jerusalem
[1:24:40] they've been taken away from their homes
[1:24:42] now
[1:24:43] they
[1:24:44] in babylon
[1:24:46] think of the misery
[1:24:48] the
[1:24:49] everybody walking around now
[1:24:52] sad
[1:24:54] then you can hear some in the crowd
[1:24:56] jeremiah tried to warn us
[1:24:59] jeremiah tried to warn us
[1:25:01] but then some
[1:25:02] yeah yeah yeah we should have listened
[1:25:05] and the children mama
[1:25:07] daddy
[1:25:08] why are we here
[1:25:10] why are we here
[1:25:11] did the parents need to look at each
[1:25:12] other we should have listened to the
[1:25:14] prophet
[1:25:16] we should have listened to the prophet
[1:25:19] daniel right there in that group
[1:25:21] his family
[1:25:22] all of them
[1:25:24] now in babylon
[1:25:26] now the regrets
[1:25:30] listen to the prophet it's going to be
[1:25:31] the exact same thing today
[1:25:33] those that don't left this message
[1:25:36] if they don't no change in their life
[1:25:38] somewhere around when things start going
[1:25:40] next we should have
[1:25:42] listened
[1:25:43] to the prophet
[1:25:45] the biggest problem i find around the
[1:25:47] message myself
[1:25:49] is many don't have a revelation where
[1:25:50] the prophet is
[1:25:54] brother branham is not the message
[1:25:57] he's the messenger
[1:26:00] oh i know the quotes well
[1:26:03] the
[1:26:04] messenger and his message is one that's
[1:26:06] exactly right
[1:26:07] but the message is still christ
[1:26:10] christ
[1:26:11] is the message
[1:26:13] amen he's a messenger
[1:26:15] so what song you don't really got messed
[1:26:18] up
[1:26:20] uh i didn't come here to preach you
[1:26:22] brother branham
[1:26:24] i come to preach you what god gave him
[1:26:26] and i preached that
[1:26:29] that's what i preached
[1:26:30] because now
[1:26:32] let me tell you it's a shame
[1:26:35] son can tell you more about brother
[1:26:37] branham personal life
[1:26:39] what he liked didn't like where he went
[1:26:41] and then go they can tell you more about
[1:26:43] that than what he preached
[1:26:46] that's bad
[1:26:49] that is really really bad
[1:26:52] me knowing brother brandon's personal
[1:26:54] life is not going to get me to heaven
[1:26:57] but me knowing having a revelation why
[1:26:59] god sent him and the message god sent
[1:27:01] him that's going to get me there
[1:27:05] but it's so mixed up today
[1:27:08] and it don't got so bad to some places
[1:27:11] you go
[1:27:12] if you don't say the prophet say a
[1:27:13] thousand times you're really not
[1:27:15] preaching the message it should not be
[1:27:17] that way
[1:27:18] if we study this message you'll know if
[1:27:21] a preacher is preaching if you study
[1:27:23] this message what did he say the prophet
[1:27:24] said and the prophet didn't say you will
[1:27:26] know because you studied it yourself
[1:27:29] amen that's right
[1:27:30] can we say amen but it's so mixed up
[1:27:33] today to them become in many places
[1:27:35] idolatry
[1:27:37] they idolize the prophet i don't idolize
[1:27:40] brother branham i love brother branham i
[1:27:42] believe everything i enjoy i it's any
[1:27:45] personal thing i enjoy it all but i know
[1:27:47] where my balance is at
[1:27:52] i know what he preached i know god's son
[1:27:54] him but i do know this the prophet even
[1:27:57] told us now the bride has a ministry
[1:27:59] today
[1:28:00] and that does not mean we're going to
[1:28:02] say something different than what he
[1:28:03] said no we're going to say the exact
[1:28:05] same thing that's been said
[1:28:07] can we say praise the lord
[1:28:09] but it's so scooped up today
[1:28:12] but now we're in the age in a time of
[1:28:14] balancing and i'm not saying i'm gonna
[1:28:16] i'm the great hero to try to balance
[1:28:18] things that is not i'm not nowhere
[1:28:20] saying that but what i'm saying is i
[1:28:22] believe all mature ministries that god
[1:28:24] has in this message gonna catch that
[1:28:26] balance and that's what they're bringing
[1:28:27] to the congregation that's what i
[1:28:29] believe
[1:28:31] can we say amen
[1:28:32] praise the lord amen but he said
[1:28:35] i wish i just would listen to that
[1:28:37] prophet
[1:28:38] but look where it got
[1:28:42] you know when you
[1:28:44] really depressed
[1:28:46] distressed
[1:28:48] just to hear a little bit of good news
[1:28:51] excites you
[1:28:53] just a little bit
[1:28:55] so now they're in a situation
[1:28:58] and jeremiah is in jail
[1:29:00] and they in babylon
[1:29:03] but something efficient that happened
[1:29:06] let's go to verse 1.
[1:29:10] now these are the words
[1:29:12] of the letter
[1:29:13] that jeremiah the prophet
[1:29:15] sent from jerusalem
[1:29:18] to the residue of the elders
[1:29:21] which was carried
[1:29:23] away captive
[1:29:25] and to the priests
[1:29:26] and to the prophets and to all the
[1:29:28] people who nebuchadnezzar had carried
[1:29:30] away captain from jerusalem to babylon
[1:29:34] now jeremiah is going to write a letter
[1:29:36] to send to them
[1:29:38] while they in babylon
[1:29:41] of course jeremiah couldn't take it he
[1:29:43] gonna give that letter to somebody
[1:29:46] to send it to him
[1:29:47] then he said after that jihad came the
[1:29:49] king and the queen and the eunuch and
[1:29:51] the princes of judah in jerusalem and
[1:29:54] the carpenters and the smith were
[1:29:55] departed from jerusalem now verse two it
[1:29:58] just threw it in there they're showing
[1:29:59] you who all else went on down to babylon
[1:30:02] but now it's gonna jump back
[1:30:04] to say
[1:30:06] amen
[1:30:08] i'm sorry
[1:30:10] verse 3.
[1:30:11] now if you
[1:30:13] i put it to you like the one thing the
[1:30:14] way the scripture is put verse 2
[1:30:17] was thrown in there to show you how the
[1:30:19] rest of them went down but if you jump
[1:30:21] from one
[1:30:22] cha verse 1 to chapter 3 you'll catch
[1:30:25] the whole thing let's just go to verse 1
[1:30:26] again
[1:30:27] now these are the words of the letter
[1:30:29] that jeremiah the prophet sent from
[1:30:31] jerusalem or to the residue of the
[1:30:33] elders which was carried away captive to
[1:30:35] the priests to the prophets and to all
[1:30:38] the people whom nebuchadnezzar carried
[1:30:40] away captain from jerusalem to babylon
[1:30:43] now you read verse three
[1:30:44] by the hand of elisha so it's showing
[1:30:47] you who he gave the letter to the
[1:30:50] takedown to babylon
[1:30:53] the son of shaphan the sean of gemara
[1:30:54] the son of helicopter whom zelda king of
[1:30:57] judah sent unto babylon to
[1:31:00] nebuchadnezzar saying now
[1:31:03] verse 4
[1:31:05] the people now and depressed
[1:31:07] distressed
[1:31:09] but now the word comes
[1:31:12] gather around
[1:31:15] jeremiah

[1:32:00] the god of israel
[1:32:01] and to all that are carried away captive
[1:32:05] whom i caused to be carried away from
[1:32:07] jerusalem unto babylon
[1:32:10] now that i can see him yeah yeah come on
[1:32:13] come on come on verse 5.
[1:32:16] build your houses
[1:32:18] hey like
[1:32:21] re read
[1:32:24] it
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:30] in captivity
[1:32:32] but go build a house
[1:32:34] that ain't good news
[1:32:36] that is not the news
[1:32:39] they wanted to hear
[1:32:41] that's the same thing like you and me
[1:32:43] sometimes god got you going through
[1:32:45] something it's certain news you want to
[1:32:47] hear
[1:32:48] and if it don't come the way you want it
[1:32:49] you don't want to hear it
[1:32:51] and we always want to hear something
[1:32:52] good
[1:32:55] i don't want no no
[1:32:57] i need to give some good but if god got
[1:32:58] something on your life or you don't
[1:33:00] cause god to bring something on your
[1:33:02] life
[1:33:03] you might want to get ready to hit
[1:33:04] rebuke because that's where it's going
[1:33:05] to be
[1:33:10] do y'all know why people sit in church
[1:33:12] tents
[1:33:15] let me tell you why
[1:33:18] sometimes people in in church
[1:33:21] tense
[1:33:24] let me tell you why you're doing that
[1:33:26] the reason why people do that when they
[1:33:28] tense in church
[1:33:30] the devil is battling them making them
[1:33:33] think he's talking to you about you
[1:33:35] he's playing this thing at you
[1:33:37] pastor i'm told in something
[1:33:39] that's what they
[1:33:41] yeah yeah yeah yeah they tense
[1:33:44] let me show you how to break that
[1:33:45] tension
[1:33:47] when you just can really realize wait a
[1:33:49] minute this brother don't know me
[1:33:52] i'm sure because i ain't even talked
[1:33:53] about john
[1:33:55] no more through text than a couple times
[1:33:57] on the phone just telling when i
[1:33:58] couldn't make it
[1:34:01] so when a person can really just accept
[1:34:04] wait a minute
[1:34:06] lord you talking to me
[1:34:09] yes you are
[1:34:11] then attention to leave
[1:34:13] then they bother to relax
[1:34:16] because they're no longer fighting
[1:34:18] they're receiving
[1:34:24] build you houses
[1:34:26] and dwell in them
[1:34:28] plant gardens
[1:34:30] and eat the fruit of them in captivity
[1:34:34] building the houses and planting gardens
[1:34:37] and fruit and fruits
[1:34:40] they get even more interesting
[1:34:42] verse six take your wives
[1:34:45] begat sons
[1:34:47] and daughters
[1:34:48] take wives for your sons
[1:34:50] give your daughters to husbands
[1:34:52] that they may bear sons and daughters
[1:34:55] that you may be increased there and not
[1:34:57] diminish they were so depressed
[1:35:01] they didn't even care for family
[1:35:02] relations
[1:35:04] but look what god is saying
[1:35:07] now i can take a sermon and preach on
[1:35:09] family affairs with that one scripture
[1:35:11] right there
[1:35:13] how do things happen through families
[1:35:14] and stuff i can take that one scripture
[1:35:16] right there by god's grace
[1:35:18] but look what god said god knew they
[1:35:20] were so depressed in this situation but
[1:35:23] he told them let the children marry
[1:35:26] but notice what he said so there'll be
[1:35:28] an increase there and not diminished the
[1:35:31] reason why god told him if you
[1:35:34] stop having relationships
[1:35:37] when the 70 years is old and you quit i
[1:35:40] ain't gonna have nobody to bring back to
[1:35:41] jerusalem
[1:35:45] so you gotta continue
[1:35:49] in captivity
[1:35:52] it gets even worse
[1:35:55] jeremiah they reading the letters of
[1:35:56] jeremiah they don't want to hear this
[1:35:59] listen what it says verse 7
[1:36:01] seek the peace
[1:36:03] of the city
[1:36:05] whether i have caused you to be carried
[1:36:06] away kept it
[1:36:08] notice and pray unto the lord for it now
[1:36:11] god telling them to pray for babylon
[1:36:16] huh
[1:36:17] jeremiah you want me to pray for these
[1:36:20] people they got academy yep
[1:36:23] that's what jesus said
[1:36:24] bless them that curse you
[1:36:27] feed your enemy
[1:36:29] pray for them that's right for the usual
[1:36:31] it's the old testament it's all together
[1:36:33] it's working with our character
[1:36:37] you want me to pray for babylon pray for
[1:36:39] it
[1:36:40] amen
[1:36:42] sometimes you say do you pray for trump
[1:36:44] i have to scripture says it
[1:36:46] did you pray for obama yep i pray for
[1:36:49] scripture saying pray for your rule
[1:36:52] that's what you do what the scripture
[1:36:53] says you do whatever you want to do
[1:36:58] i pray for the man's soul
[1:37:00] i like when brother brandon pray for uh
[1:37:03] president uh
[1:37:04] is it the white
[1:37:06] one of them he prayed he wasn't kidding
[1:37:08] well it was another one he prayed for
[1:37:09] and i like how the prophet put it he
[1:37:11] said lord this one was a godly man he
[1:37:13] said but i pray for him to help him with
[1:37:15] his decision he's cause his decision
[1:37:17] affects us
[1:37:21] but what you got to understand about
[1:37:22] presidents they make no difference who
[1:37:24] gets in the office god knew who's going
[1:37:26] to be there before the foundation of the
[1:37:28] world and whoever he put there is to
[1:37:30] help fulfill prophecy
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:34] oh down south boy i'll tell you know
[1:37:36] south is right it's pretty rough and
[1:37:38] south i couldn't write where the hard
[1:37:40] the heaviness of slavery was it's pretty
[1:37:42] rough still is
[1:37:44] oh yeah when obama come into office
[1:37:46] black people walking around with the
[1:37:48] chest stuck out
[1:37:52] huh
[1:37:53] but dude he was in office a little while
[1:37:55] you know that old crazy obama man look
[1:37:56] what he doing man look come on man i
[1:37:58] said well you just voted for him cause
[1:38:00] he was black
[1:38:02] you didn't study his life you didn't
[1:38:04] really study you just did it because he
[1:38:06] was black i said then you got what you
[1:38:07] voted for
[1:38:12] oh people don't like it did you get well
[1:38:16] the one thing you got to understand
[1:38:17] about politics
[1:38:19] they would tell you anything you want to
[1:38:21] hear to get you to vote for
[1:38:23] but once they get you vote for them they
[1:38:25] do whatever is in the agendas in their
[1:38:27] heart they just use you to get them in
[1:38:29] the office
[1:38:30] that's politics
[1:38:35] so who do you vote for none of them
[1:38:38] not a one of them
[1:38:40] they said what is your your
[1:38:42] your rights divorce that is my right
[1:38:44] that's one i don't even want i said i
[1:38:45] voted one time for jesus christ and i
[1:38:48] never lost
[1:38:50] because according to what the prophet of
[1:38:51] god said when they used a crooked
[1:38:53] machine to get candidates in an office
[1:38:55] you don't think they'll do the same
[1:38:56] thing today the machines is not the one
[1:38:58] that doing the voting anyway
[1:39:01] it's who god wants to put in the office
[1:39:02] he says in the book of daniel he can put
[1:39:04] up kings he set them down god does it
[1:39:07] all
[1:39:12] praise the lord
[1:39:14] yeah you come down south you want to
[1:39:16] hear some racism there's plenty of it
[1:39:18] down there still is
[1:39:20] you got just as much black people just
[1:39:21] as prejudiced white people it is bad
[1:39:25] oh yes it is in some areas it's pretty
[1:39:27] bad
[1:39:30] i was talking to a guy one time
[1:39:33] his prejudice
[1:39:35] i said why you don't like black peop
[1:39:41] i said uh i said i should hate you
[1:39:45] yeah
[1:39:46] but i don't i start trying to get along
[1:39:48] with you i said we didn't put you in
[1:39:50] change we didn't beat you we didn't sell
[1:39:52] you like cal i said you done all that to
[1:39:54] me
[1:39:55] and i'm trying to like you
[1:39:57] i said well i should hate you
[1:39:59] and he just said
[1:40:02] i never thought of that
[1:40:05] it's a
[1:40:06] spirit he said i never
[1:40:09] thought of that
[1:40:15] huh
[1:40:17] then i talked to the blacks people
[1:40:20] i said well
[1:40:23] that's a slavery ain't nothing new
[1:40:25] huh so yeah
[1:40:28] children is here with slaves
[1:40:30] that's it
[1:40:33] oh
[1:40:34] yeah ain't nothing
[1:40:35] what's up knew about that slave is all
[1:40:37] in the bible bro
[1:40:39] oh
[1:40:40] yeah it isn't oh ain't never thank you
[1:40:42] yeah i'm sure you did
[1:40:45] i said tell you something
[1:40:46] i said you didn't ask to come over here
[1:40:48] i didn't actually come over here
[1:40:50] but we're here
[1:40:54] i said everything is for a reason
[1:40:56] everything is for a purpose
[1:40:58] it's in god's hand amen
[1:41:01] because when you talk about a prophet
[1:41:04] first thing they say is he black so no
[1:41:06] he's a white prophet
[1:41:09] i said listen
[1:41:11] when it comes to the end of the day if
[1:41:13] he was the black prophet you still
[1:41:14] wouldn't believe
[1:41:15] because it's the word we believe not the
[1:41:17] skin amen
[1:41:19] it's the vessel that god wants to use
[1:41:21] for the word to come out of as you still
[1:41:23] wouldn't even believe
[1:41:29] you know you get all kind of questions
[1:41:30] now in young generation it's just
[1:41:33] distractions
[1:41:34] and uh
[1:41:35] uh i had one come at me said what color
[1:41:38] was jesus
[1:41:41] i knew it was coming i said well
[1:41:44] i said can you show me in the bible
[1:41:47] show me anywhere in the bible where god
[1:41:49] is interested for us to know what his
[1:41:51] color is
[1:41:54] listen give me one scripture that's you
[1:41:56] won't find nowhere in the bible he's
[1:41:58] interested for us to know what his color
[1:42:00] is he's interesting for us to know who
[1:42:03] he is
[1:42:04] i said he is the word
[1:42:08] i said but now if you really want to
[1:42:09] know what color god is
[1:42:11] i said whenever you run across a
[1:42:13] born-again believer whether it's spanish
[1:42:15] mexican italian african caucasian i said
[1:42:18] that's god's color
[1:42:22] that's because there's god dwelling in
[1:42:24] them if you want to know this colors
[1:42:31] praise the lord
[1:42:32] there's just so much nonsense you know
[1:42:35] it's all distractions they try to get
[1:42:37] you to lose your focus
[1:42:39] that's what all this stuff is
[1:42:42] but listen what he says
[1:42:46] verse eight
[1:42:48] god's just gonna just hammer it all
[1:42:51] he said but thus saith the lord of hosts
[1:42:53] the god of israel let not your prophets
[1:42:58] and your diviners that be in the midst
[1:43:00] of you deceive you
[1:43:02] neither hearken to their dreams with you
[1:43:05] cause to be dreamed you see
[1:43:08] it was prophets down there that came to
[1:43:10] jerusalem god knew they were gonna still
[1:43:12] tell the people lives
[1:43:13] right
[1:43:14] it ain't gonna be no 70 years y'all just
[1:43:16] hold on a little bit longer maybe five
[1:43:18] years and four we'll be leaving out here
[1:43:21] trying to give people false hope
[1:43:23] but did you catch what he said don't
[1:43:24] even listen to the dreams you caused the
[1:43:26] dream
[1:43:27] you can get so depressed they have a
[1:43:29] dream of victory but that dream do not
[1:43:31] be of god but because you wanted it so
[1:43:33] bad the devil give you a dream that
[1:43:35] everything gonna be okay
[1:43:37] that's a dream you caused the dream
[1:43:42] that's what pressure depression can
[1:43:45] cause you to actually do
[1:43:48] but god has not given us a spirit of
[1:43:49] fear
[1:43:52] but all of this pressure could cause
[1:43:55] these reactions god knew that
[1:43:57] he knew that look how he deals with it
[1:44:01] verse 9 for they prophesy falsely unto
[1:44:04] you in my name i have not sent them
[1:44:07] said
[1:44:08] the lord
[1:44:11] verse 10.
[1:44:13] now really when you look at verse 10
[1:44:16] you'll see
[1:44:17] why he told them not to listen to the
[1:44:19] prophecies prophets because they were
[1:44:21] going to try to let them know it ain't
[1:44:22] going to be no 70 years we're going to
[1:44:24] be out here before that because that's
[1:44:25] why i'm going to go back to it in verse
[1:44:27] 10 he said for thus saith the lord
[1:44:30] that after 70 years
[1:44:33] be accomplished
[1:44:36] at babylon i will visit you
[1:44:39] and perform my good work toward you and
[1:44:42] causing you to return to this place
[1:44:46] notice now look what god is doing
[1:44:48] letting them know i'm not going to
[1:44:50] change my word
[1:44:52] you're going to be down in 70 years it
[1:44:53] just ain't going to happen you you
[1:44:54] brought this evil on yourself but notice
[1:44:58] he telling them stay there have children
[1:45:01] have families why now let's go to verse
[1:45:03] 11.
[1:45:05] for i know the thoughts that i have
[1:45:07] towards you
[1:45:08] says the lord thoughts of peace
[1:45:10] not an evil to give you an expected end
[1:45:14] the expected end is she telling them you
[1:45:17] got to keep moving on it's going to be
[1:45:19] hard you caused this but at least i want
[1:45:22] to let you know you're going to come out
[1:45:24] something that you can look forward to
[1:45:26] and i'm here to tell you out of all the
[1:45:28] things that are happening today this
[1:45:30] message is our expected end
[1:45:33] it let us know all this time is going to
[1:45:35] come people are going to fall away
[1:45:37] you're going to fall find liars you're
[1:45:39] going to find false prophets you know
[1:45:40] all of this got to happen around the
[1:45:42] message but god said i'm giving you an
[1:45:45] expected end there's going to be a
[1:45:47] rapture look up your redemption jaws now
[1:45:50] these things must be but you got to stay
[1:45:52] in your place and press on
[1:45:55] that's our
[1:45:57] in
[1:45:59] that's what god would tell us this
[1:46:00] morning you haven't i'm giving you an
[1:46:03] expected end yeah that's a lot of
[1:46:04] negative but don't look at it
[1:46:06] you got to press on
[1:46:12] don't know what time it is i do know
[1:46:13] what town i don't know what time it
[1:46:14] started
[1:46:16] what it was
[1:46:21] one more thing
[1:46:26] let me read something to you
[1:46:31] it comes from the message the ever
[1:46:32] present
[1:46:33] water from the rock
[1:46:35] i'm sure this is a familiar quote
[1:46:40] the prophet said
[1:46:42] when we die our souls would go under the
[1:46:44] altar of god
[1:46:46] where i was privileged to see
[1:46:48] a few mornings ago
[1:46:50] as you know in division
[1:46:52] where the bible speaks of our spirits
[1:46:55] will go to god who give it
[1:46:58] and our bodies shall return to the dust
[1:47:00] of the earth
[1:47:02] but someday
[1:47:03] when the scripture is fulfilled
[1:47:06] our spirits will be released from god
[1:47:10] we'll pick up the soul
[1:47:12] and the soul to the body
[1:47:15] and the power that will raise us up is
[1:47:18] right in us now
[1:47:20] we are now in heavenly places
[1:47:23] we are now in the power of the
[1:47:25] resurrection
[1:47:28] he said if there wasn't a law
[1:47:30] to that
[1:47:33] sons and daughters of god would create
[1:47:35] them a world
[1:47:37] out here
[1:47:38] go live a private life on it
[1:47:42] you have the power in you to do it
[1:47:45] if you've got a shadow of the power of
[1:47:47] god in you
[1:47:49] you've got power to do it god is
[1:47:51] omnipotent you just see what i mean
[1:47:54] the power that's in you will make you
[1:47:57] could speak a world into existence
[1:48:00] go live on it hallelujah
[1:48:02] there you are listen now
[1:48:05] that's what power is in the church now
[1:48:08] he said but
[1:48:09] it is controlled
[1:48:11] by a law
[1:48:13] and that law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:48:15] commandments it's a law of faith jesus
[1:48:18] said all things are possible to them
[1:48:20] that believe
[1:48:21] and if you can believe it
[1:48:23] whatever god will lead your soul to
[1:48:25] believe
[1:48:27] that is yours every place of the souls
[1:48:29] your feet can set upon by faith god
[1:48:32] gives it to you amen it's yours you
[1:48:34] possess it
[1:48:36] if you can find the key to this law of
[1:48:38] faith that opens it to you you see what
[1:48:41] i mean
[1:48:42] that power is controlled if you are a
[1:48:45] son of god you are a daughter of god
[1:48:47] that never leaves you it's with you all
[1:48:49] the time but your faith gets away from
[1:48:52] it but it's still there now notice he
[1:48:54] said the power is in you
[1:48:58] the a world a private i like how he said
[1:49:01] a private one
[1:49:02] and go live on it
[1:49:05] his body's controlled by a law
[1:49:07] so
[1:49:08] god is controlling that faith in us
[1:49:11] where we can go create that word because
[1:49:13] the time is not now
[1:49:16] so god that's all control that's what he
[1:49:18] said the faith whatever god will call
[1:49:20] you to believe
[1:49:21] but he said that power is actually in
[1:49:24] you
[1:49:28] i want to say something to you
[1:49:31] the power in you
[1:49:33] to create that world like the prophet
[1:49:35] said is in you
[1:49:37] but there's also
[1:49:39] a power in you
[1:49:41] to create the wrong world
[1:49:48] if you go to the message i want you to
[1:49:50] type in a quote
[1:49:53] i know johnny loves me
[1:49:55] just type that in i know johnny loves me
[1:49:59] it's a quote gonna come up
[1:50:02] and the court gonna come up of a little
[1:50:04] girl
[1:50:06] he gonna begin to talk about her
[1:50:09] he said that when she was a
[1:50:11] real young girl she had a heart
[1:50:12] condition he prayed for
[1:50:14] and god touched her
[1:50:16] but now she's older now he said now she
[1:50:19] got a different type of heart condition
[1:50:21] it was about a
[1:50:22] boy
[1:50:24] this girl got this boy left her
[1:50:28] and she and it was so devastating only
[1:50:31] thing she could say i know johnny loves
[1:50:33] me i know johnny loves me
[1:50:35] but this boy took off and went and
[1:50:36] married another girl
[1:50:39] and he said that he blamed it on his
[1:50:40] father that his father said
[1:50:43] but he told that girl he's just nonsense
[1:50:45] his dad is not saying he said the reason
[1:50:47] why that really that boy would never
[1:50:49] love you right he's cause if he'd love
[1:50:51] you right he wouldn't do such a thing as
[1:50:53] that
[1:50:54] but then he began to say he said what
[1:50:56] that girl did
[1:50:59] because of what happened
[1:51:01] she built the world around it
[1:51:05] she created a world
[1:51:07] a journey with another woman but she's
[1:51:09] still saying i know johnny loves me
[1:51:12] she created a world
[1:51:15] then he says
[1:51:17] as he began to talk to her
[1:51:21] he said some transaction
[1:51:23] happened between her and that boy
[1:51:25] only
[1:51:27] him and her would know
[1:51:29] god showed him i'm sure it was a vision
[1:51:32] he told him what it was
[1:51:33] but when he told her what they did he
[1:51:35] don't say what it was
[1:51:37] but when he told her it sparked her
[1:51:39] made her wake up because she know how
[1:51:41] could he have known that
[1:51:44] but he told her
[1:51:47] since you out of that world now
[1:51:50] he's i need you to look toward calvary
[1:51:53] so it took something supernatural to
[1:51:56] take place to say to her to make her
[1:51:58] break from that world
[1:52:00] now she could come out
[1:52:03] we create worlds
[1:52:06] and it'll take something supernatural
[1:52:09] god to strike us to get us to come out
[1:52:10] of them
[1:52:12] and there's all kind of worlds we create
[1:52:15] many times and we don't realize we did
[1:52:17] it
[1:52:21] let me name some of those worlds
[1:52:25] some worlds a woman can create
[1:52:28] against her husband
[1:52:31] and she could live in it
[1:52:33] and the husband don't have a clue
[1:52:35] because when you create worlds yourself
[1:52:36] you live in it all by yourself
[1:52:39] and far as you know
[1:52:40] everybody is wrong can't see what's
[1:52:42] going on in your life because it's your
[1:52:45] world
[1:52:46] like that little girl i know johnny
[1:52:48] loved it she couldn't see nothing else
[1:52:50] regardless you just couldn't see nothing
[1:52:52] else that was her world you could do the
[1:52:54] exact same thing
[1:52:55] so a lot of times people especially
[1:52:58] housewife can create a world
[1:53:01] especially always in the house seeing
[1:53:03] them walls and they can create a world
[1:53:05] then the devil can get them to create a
[1:53:07] world nobody appreciates me
[1:53:13] nobody know what i go on and what
[1:53:15] happened to me
[1:53:16] while i'm here in this house
[1:53:18] all they want to do is come home and eat
[1:53:21] and eat and do this and do this but they
[1:53:23] don't know what i go through daily they
[1:53:26] just don't know you keep thinking like
[1:53:28] that you begin to create a world
[1:53:31] amen amen
[1:53:33] that's right but then when that world is
[1:53:34] created then
[1:53:36] more things adds to that were
[1:53:38] unappreciated
[1:53:40] the devils start coming in they don't
[1:53:42] appreciate you look what you do look
[1:53:43] what you do and a lot of times the devil
[1:53:45] says look what you do and a lot of times
[1:53:46] you really
[1:53:47] i ain't trying to be funny everything
[1:53:49] you're doing is in zombie mode
[1:53:53] how many y'all know what zombie mode is
[1:53:55] i call it zombie mode you get around the
[1:53:57] hound
[1:53:58] you're moving
[1:54:00] function and just
[1:54:07] it's a zombie mode you don't create it
[1:54:09] that
[1:54:10] world
[1:54:13] and then when somebody try to talk to
[1:54:14] you while they talk to you you okay
[1:54:17] yes
[1:54:19] i'm fine
[1:54:20] because you don't got so satisfied in
[1:54:22] your little world you say you okay
[1:54:25] when you're not okay
[1:54:27] let me tell you something friends
[1:54:28] sometimes and there's gonna be a little
[1:54:30] strong statement but i'm just gonna have
[1:54:31] to be honest with you sometimes i think
[1:54:33] especially in marriage life if you ain't
[1:54:35] careful you can be telling lies
[1:54:38] when something is really really wrong
[1:54:40] with you your husband or your wife asks
[1:54:42] you are you okay and you say yes
[1:54:45] and you know you're not okay
[1:54:51] the best thing to say
[1:54:53] now if you're going through something
[1:54:55] but by faith you can see your way out of
[1:54:57] it it's all right to say i'm fine
[1:55:00] all is well it's okay but you know you
[1:55:02] just defeated
[1:55:04] you can't see no father then your hand
[1:55:07] and just tore up inside
[1:55:09] do not say you're okay
[1:55:12] don't don't do it
[1:55:14] just say no i'm not okay
[1:55:16] let's talk
[1:55:20] cause sometimes you say you okay i'm
[1:55:21] fine
[1:55:24] you sure
[1:55:26] yes
[1:55:28] okay
[1:55:31] are you ready do it look like something
[1:55:32] wrong with me i told you i'm fine
[1:55:35] okay
[1:55:38] then when you walk off
[1:55:40] the devil come back they didn't even
[1:55:42] keep talking to you to make sure you
[1:55:43] fine didn't get mad
[1:55:50] these are worlds
[1:55:53] you can create
[1:55:54] and you're mad because nobody want to
[1:55:56] come in your world
[1:55:59] because that's what you created
[1:56:02] that's why it's good to tell your wife i
[1:56:04] love you
[1:56:06] i appreciate you
[1:56:08] you might think i don't see what you do
[1:56:09] but i see what you do
[1:56:11] see when you're telling them that they
[1:56:12] don't create a world you're crushing it
[1:56:16] say i appreciate you especially so you
[1:56:18] know something you did the other week i
[1:56:20] forgot to tell you but i really
[1:56:21] appreciate you doing there they go
[1:56:24] oh you remember that they come out of
[1:56:25] that world
[1:56:27] oh
[1:56:30] how he is paying some attention then the
[1:56:32] devil goes what about that though
[1:56:34] yeah
[1:56:36] he ain't saying nothing about that
[1:56:38] and worlds
[1:56:42] a man can do the same thing
[1:56:45] come home
[1:56:46] all i do is work
[1:56:48] pay bills
[1:56:49] come in this house nobody appreciate me
[1:56:52] don't ask me how my day was
[1:56:53] nothing
[1:56:54] nothing they don't realize these lights
[1:56:56] are on
[1:56:58] water running
[1:57:00] they ain't even seeing none of that they
[1:57:01] don't know it you don't create it that
[1:57:03] world
[1:57:04] i'll show you how to break them worlds
[1:57:06] you say i thank god lord you were there
[1:57:07] to give me work and keep the lights on
[1:57:09] water i thank you for the work father
[1:57:11] lord i thank you
[1:57:18] amen
[1:57:20] because when pressure comes in the house
[1:57:21] everything comes out especially when
[1:57:23] it's financial
[1:57:25] children be taken about why are you in
[1:57:27] that shower so long
[1:57:30] you don't need all that water
[1:57:31] why you leave that light on see this
[1:57:33] expression pressure
[1:57:36] you ain't got to pay for it see you
[1:57:37] don't you don't got in that world now
[1:57:42] demorals we build them
[1:57:44] right and it's not good
[1:57:47] children be a world nobody i got no
[1:57:49] friends
[1:57:51] nobody don't want to be my friend
[1:57:54] well i'll be my own friend
[1:57:58] then i start getting into finding the
[1:57:59] wrong friends
[1:58:02] because they don't build that world
[1:58:06] i see it a lot on campgrounds youth
[1:58:08] camps
[1:58:10] warriors
[1:58:11] you see little groups of worlds
[1:58:14] all you got to do is account last five
[1:58:16] days just about two days you'll be able
[1:58:18] to see the worlds
[1:58:19] because whoever's supposed to be the
[1:58:20] superstar in the campground they'll all
[1:58:22] start wearing their hair the same huh
[1:58:27] cause they're looking up to somebody in
[1:58:29] the group they want to fit in with the
[1:58:30] group said they want to act like and
[1:58:32] just talk just like
[1:58:34] little worlds just walking around the
[1:58:35] campground i just shake my head
[1:58:37] sometimes
[1:58:40] it's called influence
[1:58:43] i didn't want to be like that one and
[1:58:45] you see so many young people and a lot
[1:58:47] of times those ones that walk around
[1:58:49] like that they're the worst ones they
[1:58:50] don't care nothing about god they're
[1:58:52] there for the wrong reasons how many
[1:58:53] girls numbers they can get or how many
[1:58:55] bars numbers they can talk to it's the
[1:58:56] wrong reason and then the other will be
[1:58:58] attracted to it
[1:59:00] it's warriors and we can create those
[1:59:03] things
[1:59:04] very very easily
[1:59:07] praise the lord
[1:59:10] my wife
[1:59:12] bless her heart
[1:59:14] i use a lot of
[1:59:17] examples with my wife me and my wife
[1:59:18] sometimes because sometimes when you do
[1:59:20] things like do people be sitting there
[1:59:21] getting mad at you they think you're
[1:59:23] pointing at them but i don't know
[1:59:24] nothing about y'all lives
[1:59:26] so i just use my me and my wife to try
[1:59:28] to break the ice
[1:59:31] you know my wife just recently
[1:59:35] bless her heart
[1:59:39] my daughter
[1:59:41] them told me they were gonna throw her a
[1:59:42] surprise birthday party
[1:59:45] she never had a birthday party
[1:59:48] she said daddy we want to give mom a
[1:59:50] birthday party
[1:59:52] and say you're going to play a key role
[1:59:53] in it so you're going to have to make
[1:59:55] sure you get her there
[1:59:58] it's okay
[1:59:59] this is this in three months in the
[2:00:01] making
[2:00:02] and uh
[2:00:04] say we're gonna have it at the
[2:00:05] fellowship hall at the church and you
[2:00:06] gotta somehow get her at the church
[2:00:09] i don't know how you're gonna do it
[2:00:11] that's all right i can do it
[2:00:13] that's okay
[2:00:15] so
[2:00:16] they told me that her birthday was in
[2:00:18] april
[2:00:19] so they told me that in february
[2:00:21] see i know my wife
[2:00:25] i told i said i see you know when your
[2:00:27] birthday come in april
[2:00:29] i don't make no plans with nobody
[2:00:32] i said cause i got something planned for
[2:00:34] us
[2:00:35] and uh
[2:00:37] you
[2:00:37] no sisters don't care who it is did you
[2:00:40] tell them
[2:00:42] no you i got something planned she said
[2:00:46] wow
[2:00:48] she ain't never done that
[2:00:50] so now
[2:00:51] she's like
[2:00:54] and it was funny some sisters had asked
[2:00:56] her about some
[2:00:58] she barely already got plans
[2:01:00] for us
[2:01:02] because i'm not that type of person
[2:01:04] i'm a
[2:01:06] bless her heart i'm a spur of a moment
[2:01:08] person
[2:01:09] i could just be riding down the road
[2:01:11] something popping my mind hey you want
[2:01:12] to go go cold she
[2:01:14] yep should take off and go
[2:01:16] brother why you didn't tell me i just
[2:01:18] thought of it that's just me
[2:01:20] that's burley williams
[2:01:22] i didn't know but a lot of times
[2:01:25] i thank god some things work out for me
[2:01:28] because sometimes i don't know one way
[2:01:29] or the other what god wants me to do i
[2:01:32] just don't know but i do know the
[2:01:34] scripture says the footsteps of the
[2:01:35] righteous is the order of the lord
[2:01:37] that's what i do know
[2:01:39] and i do believe when god leads
[2:01:41] everything works together
[2:01:44] i do believe that because like i had
[2:01:46] every intention being on here last
[2:01:47] sunday
[2:01:48] every intention
[2:01:50] and i'll give you a testimony about that
[2:01:52] later brother but i just knew i couldn't
[2:01:53] be
[2:01:54] something just ain't lining up
[2:01:56] i don't know what it is but i cannot go
[2:01:58] and then so i called but john
[2:02:02] so time go by
[2:02:05] and her birthday was uh
[2:02:08] on a saturday
[2:02:12] so again close to her birthday i noticed
[2:02:14] she was getting sad
[2:02:16] cause nobody said anything about

[2:05:52] smart
[2:05:54] i knew she was gonna try to calculate
[2:05:56] every turn
[2:05:58] i knew that
[2:05:59] so i circled around the motel a couple
[2:06:01] of times
[2:06:02] i just i just did all kinds of stuff
[2:06:04] just that threw a mine all off
[2:06:08] and we just driving

[2:06:16] i get a text message
[2:06:18] we ain't ready yet you got to do
[2:06:20] something
[2:06:22] so i took a longer route
[2:06:25] then then i said man then all of a
[2:06:27] sudden
[2:06:28] i'm getting close to the church
[2:06:30] then i passed my son he ain't him there
[2:06:33] i'm like
[2:06:34] oh come on
[2:06:37] so then my daughter called me and said
[2:06:39] something wrong and then i said what
[2:06:42] she said what happened what happened i
[2:06:44] said
[2:06:46] i said she didn't want some money
[2:06:48] and i said lord
[2:06:50] cause we had to tell some
[2:06:53] only way i could justify my
[2:06:55] little fields
[2:06:57] i knew i was going to repent
[2:06:59] i said lord i'm trying to trick this
[2:07:00] woman that's the only thing i can think
[2:07:02] of
[2:07:03] is rahab she said she didn't know what
[2:07:05] the spies were but she knew exactly what
[2:07:07] they were
[2:07:10] i said so you have to forgive me this is
[2:07:11] all i can think of
[2:07:14] so she then we pulled up at the church
[2:07:18] you know we got gravely
[2:07:20] she heard the gravel come she said
[2:07:22] did this gravel
[2:07:24] i it's a long line
[2:07:26] people getting to this restaurant
[2:07:28] because she's thinking it's a big old
[2:07:29] fancy restaurant that's just a long line
[2:07:32] and we just in line we're gonna get
[2:07:33] there she said oh
[2:07:36] then they they reached up
[2:07:37] i pulled up got him again i said all
[2:07:40] right time to get out then when she got
[2:07:42] out she put her foot she said
[2:07:44] the grass burley
[2:07:48] i said yeah she said
[2:07:50] what motel got grass
[2:07:53] i said well we got a part you know we
[2:07:54] got to walk up to it i said you just
[2:07:56] let's listen this please just come on
[2:08:00] i said i got your hand i got your hand
[2:08:03] so i grabbed about a hand we walking up
[2:08:05] to the door
[2:08:07] then we open the door and full of people
[2:08:09] she walks in
[2:08:11] she just stands there
[2:08:13] it's all right
[2:08:14] and then i take that blindfold off
[2:08:17] and
[2:08:18] surprise you
[2:08:22] oh she could say she said
[2:08:24] all these people
[2:08:26] no she said all of these beautiful
[2:08:28] people
[2:08:29] and then she just thought walking like a
[2:08:30] zombie
[2:08:33] she went to the table
[2:08:36] she said bernie
[2:08:38] i feel so bad i said you should
[2:08:43] i said look how you acted
[2:08:45] look at all those things you said
[2:08:48] now you got to repent i said you got to
[2:08:50] repent for all that they've done all of
[2:08:52] this for you but you built that world
[2:08:54] you don't build that world that's not
[2:08:56] look what you've done
[2:08:59] we built worlds
[2:09:01] and they become real to us
[2:09:03] it ain't what you seems it seems
[2:09:05] sometimes
[2:09:07] that's all we need to stay in the world
[2:09:08] of faith
[2:09:10] trusting in the promise of god
[2:09:12] and just like the shooting night one
[2:09:13] when he told her
[2:09:15] she said
[2:09:17] when her husband remember that she went
[2:09:19] to her husband
[2:09:20] she said i need a chariot
[2:09:23] he said why
[2:09:25] there's neither new moon or a sabbath
[2:09:27] her son was dead
[2:09:29] but she said all as well
[2:09:31] look at the character of that woman
[2:09:33] her child was dead
[2:09:36] but she told her husband
[2:09:38] all as well
[2:09:40] there's no way in scripture recorded
[2:09:41] that he even knew his son was dead
[2:09:44] her character was
[2:09:46] he's at work
[2:09:48] he already got enough pressure
[2:09:50] i'll deal with it i'll deal with this
[2:09:52] situation
[2:09:53] when he came home her and the son eaten
[2:09:56] and she don't know her son he don't even
[2:09:58] know his son was dead but she noticed
[2:10:00] her character when she left her husband
[2:10:02] she told the driver drive
[2:10:05] don't you stop driving
[2:10:07] but she didn't express none of that
[2:10:08] character
[2:10:09] to her husband
[2:10:12] that's character that's why sometimes
[2:10:15] my wife deals with situations i don't
[2:10:17] even know about it
[2:10:18] because if i knew about it i probably
[2:10:20] got a kid come here
[2:10:23] but she'll deal with it sometimes right
[2:10:26] then later on she'll probably tell him
[2:10:27] it does such and such
[2:10:29] what she did
[2:10:31] i dealt with it all right it's okay
[2:10:34] okay
[2:10:35] that's what sometimes it takes it takes
[2:10:37] a little time to ask questions
[2:10:40] why do you do this why what happened
[2:10:42] what's going on
[2:10:43] instead of just jumping to conclusions
[2:10:47] because you can build a world and jump
[2:10:48] into a conclusion you can build a world
[2:10:50] of always assuming right
[2:10:53] then that'd be your
[2:10:54] world and it comes out wrong
[2:10:58] can we get a lot of hand god bless you
[2:11:02] [Applause]
[2:11:03] let us pray
[2:11:07] heavenly father we just thank you for
[2:11:08] your word this evening this morning
[2:11:10] father and i trust and pray
[2:11:16] i believe oh god it was received
[2:11:19] i only just preached father this i felt
[2:11:21] led
[2:11:23] and expect it in
[2:11:26] sometimes oh lord things can just seem
[2:11:28] to be
[2:11:30] so messed up and it's not
[2:11:34] sometimes we even build church worlds
[2:11:38] we feel like we're the only one
[2:11:40] the only church going through problems
[2:11:44] look at us we're isolated and what's
[2:11:46] going on here ain't nothing seem to be
[2:11:48] happening
[2:11:49] but then we build a world around that
[2:11:51] not realizing
[2:11:52] that we're here by your grace
[2:11:56] every church every assembly has a
[2:11:58] different anointing on it father
[2:12:00] but let us not fail to realize
[2:12:03] wherever you place us to be that's why
[2:12:06] we should put our heart
[2:12:07] we should put our energy
[2:12:10] there
[2:12:11] it's a shame father what internet has
[2:12:13] done oh god and internet churches
[2:12:16] those things are okay lord
[2:12:19] but when we can't appreciate what we
[2:12:20] have we can only just keep screaming and
[2:12:23] looking at this one this one got this
[2:12:24] one guy that grass always looked green
[2:12:26] on the other side
[2:12:28] but we got to recognize lord jesus where
[2:12:30] you put us where you placed us
[2:12:33] that's where the power is and effective
[2:12:35] effectiveness will be
[2:12:36] when we know our place
[2:12:38] and our position
[2:12:40] i pray for brother john it is similar
[2:12:42] here
[2:12:43] and we just thank you for your grace and
[2:12:44] mercy father and lord we just commit
[2:12:46] everything into your hands
[2:12:48] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[2:12:51] amen
[2:12:52] may the lord bless you bye john
[2:12:55] god bless
[2:13:01] thank you for taking your liberty
[2:13:04] amen
[2:13:05] how many appreciated that word
[2:13:07] amen
[2:13:08] praise the lord
[2:13:09] [Applause]
[2:13:12] somebody wants brother burly to come
[2:13:14] back

[2:13:19] yeah maybe in the in the fall or the
[2:13:21] winter

[2:13:24] led to
[2:13:26] amen let's stand together

[2:13:51] and
[2:13:52] i appreciate someone that knows their
[2:13:55] position
[2:13:57] we we are in a position that we know
[2:14:00] that we're going to go into a rapture
[2:14:03] we have an expected end amen and we've
[2:14:06] got to keep on keeping on until it
[2:14:08] happens no matter what happens to this
[2:14:11] person that group this family i mean we

[2:24:54] functioning with the body
[2:24:56] now
[2:24:57] if we were
[2:24:58] all doctors that could
[2:25:01] actually do something to make a
[2:25:03] difference in her life we would do it
[2:25:05] but we're not doctors
[2:25:08] but we're the children of the living god
[2:25:12] and
[2:25:13] god hears your prayers
[2:25:17] and if we could just
[2:25:19] take time to fast
[2:25:22] and to pray for our sister
[2:25:25] now i'm not going to just
[2:25:27] call meals
[2:25:28] in days and a sign but what i would like
[2:25:32] is us just to be as serious as we could
[2:25:34] about this subject yes
[2:25:37] and whatever you
[2:25:39] can
[2:25:40] can do to to sacrifice to crucify the
[2:25:43] flesh
[2:25:44] and to spend time calling out to god for
[2:25:47] our sister because she needs the
[2:25:49] intervention of the holy ghost for her
[2:25:52] body
[2:25:56] will you do that with me yes
[2:25:58] just pray lord what would you have me to
[2:26:00] do if it's only a meal it's the only
[2:26:02] meal if it's a day if it's two days
[2:26:04] whatever it is just
[2:26:07] call out call upon god and i i want us
[2:26:10] to have what our brother read today and
[2:26:14] expect it and for our sister
[2:26:17] and may the lord be with us and grant
[2:26:20] healing for our sister
[2:26:23] oh
[2:26:25] i just i just prayed that her sister
[2:26:27] could be able to use her muscles enough
[2:26:30] to cough up the things that are that
[2:26:32] mucus and things that are staying in
[2:26:34] there just to be able to function
[2:26:36] normally we have the ability to cough up
[2:26:39] and and it it it becomes extremely
[2:26:42] difficult for our sister
[2:26:44] and uh she needs our prayers and her
[2:26:46] that fasting just i'm serious god
