[27:33] A heartache
[27:36] here is but a stepping
[27:42] stone along the
[27:46] trail that's winding always
[27:50] [Music]
[27:52] upward. This trbled
[27:55] world is not my final home.

[28:21] on. Until the
[28:24] day mine I behold that
[28:30] city until the
[28:34] day God
[28:36] calls me home.
[28:41] The things of
[28:44] earth will dim and lose their
[28:48] [Music]
[28:50] luster. If we
[28:53] recall, they're borrowed for a
[28:59] while. And things of
[29:03] earth that cause a heart to
[29:09] tremble.
[29:11] Remember
[29:13] there will only bring a
[29:19] smile. Until

[29:37] on. Until the
[29:41] day my eyes behold that
[29:47] city. Until the

[29:53] calls me home.
[29:58] This weery
[30:01] world with all its toil and
[30:06] struggle may take its
[30:10] toll of
[30:13] misery and strife.
[30:17] The soul of
[30:20] man is like a waiting
[30:25] eagle. When it's
[30:29] released, it's destined for the
[30:36] sky. Until
[30:38] then, my heart will go on
[30:45] singing. Until
[30:48] then, with joy I'll carry
[30:54] on until the
[30:57] day mine eyes behold that
[31:03] city. Until the
[31:07] day, God

[39:36] should enter into your gates with
[39:37] thanksgiving in our hearts. That's
[39:39] right. Amen. Said that you live in the
[39:41] praise of your children. Thank you for
[39:44] giving it the strength to come and
[39:46] praise you Lord. Father, we are about to
[39:49] feed on your word and we ask your
[39:51] mercies to come down. Oh Lord, I commit
[39:55] myself again into your mighty hands.
[39:58] Father, without you, I am nothing and
[40:00] any able man can turn the pages of the
[40:03] scriptures and read them. But it takes
[40:06] you oh God to bring the meaning into the
[40:09] heart of your children. That is what we
[40:11] ask you this morning father to do that
[40:13] our faith will not rely upon any man's
[40:17] idea but rather the revelation of your
[40:20] word. Help us this morning oh God to
[40:23] come close to thee in the name of Jesus
[40:26] Christ. And father any unspoken request
[40:29] that is upon the heart of your children
[40:31] I commit all into your mighty hands.
[40:34] Lord, see and do all for them that in
[40:36] their joy they will glorify your mighty
[40:39] name. Thank you in Jesus Christ's name

[40:47] sisters. God bless you all. Um thank you
[40:51] again, brother John,
[40:54] for bringing me back to the pulpit. Um I
[40:58] really appreciate
[41:00] uh you and the entire family.
[41:04] Well, um, some few weeks back I was here
[41:07] and I went round to visit some of the
[41:09] breeding. Uh, it's time for me to go
[41:11] home and that's why I'm here back back
[41:13] here to finish with you and then uh we
[41:17] will set off. So, we need to

[41:43] Yeah. So the rest we will dedicate
[41:48] it unto the Lord by um feeding upon his
[41:53] word. If there is anything that I
[41:55] forgotten to put across, maybe in the
[41:58] course of the preaching I'll bring it
[42:00] out. Okay. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[42:02] brother M. I'm happy to see you here
[42:04] today. Okay. God bless you. The Lord is
[42:06] in control.
[42:08] Amen. So, beloved, uh without wasting
[42:12] much time, let's uh just be on our feet
[42:15] again and turn our scriptures to
[42:19] uh
[42:21] Psalms
[42:25] 91.
[42:29] Psalm 91 is
[42:36] reading verse 1
[42:42] to8. Psalm 91 verse1 to 8.
[42:49] He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[42:52] the most high shall abide under the
[42:56] shadow of the
[42:57] almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is
[43:01] my refuge and my fortress, my God. In
[43:06] him will I
[43:08] trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from
[43:12] the snare of the fowler and from the
[43:16] noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee
[43:19] with his feathers, and under his wings
[43:22] shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy
[43:26] shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be
[43:30] afraid for the terror by night, nor for
[43:34] the arrow that flyth by
[43:37] day, nor for the pestilence that walketh
[43:41] in darkness, nor for the destruction
[43:44] that wasted at noonday. A thousand shall
[43:47] fall at thy sight, and 10,000 at thy
[43:51] right hand, but it shall not come nigh
[43:54] thee. Only with thy eyes shalt thou
[43:58] behold the sea and see the reward of the
[44:03] wicked. Let's read also Leviticus.
[44:11] Leviticus chapter
[44:15] 25 and verse
[44:17] [Music]
[44:18] 18 and 19. Leviticus
[44:24] 25 verse 18. Wherefore ye shall do my
[44:28] statutus, and keep my judgment, and do
[44:31] them, and ye shall dwell in the land in
[44:35] safety, and the land shall yield her
[44:38] fruit, and ye shall eat your field, and
[44:41] dwell there rain in safety. Amen. The
[44:44] Lord add his blessing to the reading of
[44:46] his word. Amen. Please, let's take our
[44:48] seats.
[44:54] But beloved, this this morning uh we
[44:56] want
[44:57] to speak on um a subject or a topic
[45:02] being sure of your safety.
[45:08] Well, we know
[45:11] that every man, every woman, every
[45:17] child don't
[45:19] joke with safety.
[45:24] We all of
[45:28] us at all
[45:32] point we want to be
[45:36] safe and you will agree with
[45:40] me that when we talking about
[45:46] safety then we are talking about a
[45:51] condition of you being sure of your
[45:55] security.
[45:56] Amen. And you know fear started working
[46:01] in man immediately after the fall
[46:04] when man fell in the garden of Eden. If
[46:06] you remember carefully, the Bible
[46:08] say when their eyes were open and they
[46:11] realized that they were
[46:13] naked, then they pluck some kind of
[46:16] thick leaves and try to cover the
[46:18] themselves
[46:20] and they hid themselves from God. And
[46:22] when God came into the garden, they were
[46:24] nowhere to be found. And God have to
[46:26] call Adam,
[46:28] Adam. Amen. He said, "Where are you?" He
[46:31] said, "I'm hiding somewhere
[46:32] here because I'm
[46:35] afraid." Hallelujah. And you know the
[46:37] story already. I don't want to go into
[46:39] those ones for now. But what it entail
[46:43] is that that fall put fear into man.
[46:48] Amen. And from that day, man has lived
[46:51] with fear. We are always afraid of
[46:53] something.
[46:55] In fact, when you are walking by the
[46:57] roadside and even a driver, you know,
[47:01] blow a horn on you, you see the way you
[47:03] jump, you you are jumping to safety. You
[47:06] go, you don't want to be hit by the
[47:07] vehicle.
[47:09] Hallelujah. And it has been so in the
[47:12] life of every man, every woman, every
[47:16] child. We always want to be
[47:19] protected. Hallelujah.
[47:22] Even the animals. Look at the
[47:24] animals. When the deer is here right now
[47:27] and uh grazing on the grass, the moment
[47:30] he see any object approaching, he has to
[47:32] take it flight because Amen. He's afraid
[47:35] of death.
[47:38] Hallelujah. Amen. Sometimes when when we
[47:42] are our bodies are aching I mean the
[47:46] moment man go into the condition of
[47:49] illness or sickness or whatever the only
[47:51] thing that come into your mind is death
[47:53] is that and you'll be praying Lord heal
[47:56] me. Amen. I want to see the doctor. Yes.
[48:00] Because there is kind of fear in us.
[48:04] Until
[48:05] today man want to protect himself. Amen.
[48:10] Man does everything to protect himself.
[48:12] And in fact, people go even to spend
[48:16] money, okay? To put certain gadgets in
[48:19] their buildings and in so that they'll
[48:22] be protected. Right. Amen.
[48:25] Amen. Others go out without guns because
[48:29] they want to secure them their sec their
[48:31] safety. Some put on uh what do we call
[48:35] um
[48:38] what? Body
[48:40] hammer. Oh, okay. Well, I don't know
[48:43] about
[48:44] that. Bulletproof. Bulletproof. That's
[48:46] what I'm Oh, that's what we are saying.
[48:48] Body hammer. Oh, I never I never know
[48:50] about that. Thank you for teaching me
[48:52] this morning. Hallelujah. They put
[48:55] bulletproof to I mean to they want to be
[48:58] in safety
[49:00] because they are afraid.
[49:03] But eventually what happened with all
[49:05] their bulletproof sometime they are
[49:07] killed.
[49:09] Amen. Hallelujah.
[49:11] But if the child of God needs
[49:15] security, it is not in those things.
[49:18] Hallelujah. There is only one source of
[49:20] security for the child of God. Amen. And
[49:22] in fact, that source is not for all the
[49:25] people.
[49:27] Is that clear? That source of security
[49:30] is not for all the people, but it is for
[49:32] the people that God have chosen. Amen.
[49:37] You must accept it.
[49:40] Hallelujah. So we agree with David. He
[49:43] said, "He that dwelleth in the secret
[49:45] place of the most high shall abide under
[49:48] the shadow of the almighty."
[49:52] And so long as you are under that shadow
[49:55] of the almighty, you are secured.
[49:59] In fact, the prophet said, "Wherever God
[50:01] leaves you, there is no danger." Right?
[50:04] So if God is standing here and you are
[50:06] standing by God or God is standing by
[50:09] you, you are forever saved.
[50:12] But how do you come into that condition?
[50:16] Hallelujah. There is a condition. There
[50:19] is a way. I mean in the in the olden
[50:22] days when God brought the Israelites
[50:25] from Egypt, you know that they went
[50:28] through so many
[50:30] obstacles until nations started fighting
[50:32] them and they also fought. But God
[50:36] didn't leave Israel to fight the
[50:37] battles.
[50:39] In fact, if you remember one time when
[50:41] Joshua was going to battle and he met a
[50:45] man standing in the way with the son
[50:47] drawn
[50:49] and the courage Joshua filled the Holy
[50:51] Ghost was not afraid of
[50:54] anything. He said, "Are you for us or
[50:56] you are against us?"
[50:58] And then the Most High said, "I am the
[51:00] captain of the host of Israel." Amen.
[51:03] Then Joshua bow down and worship. Amen.
[51:06] God doesn't leave his people to fight
[51:09] the battles. God always fight our
[51:12] battles for us.
[51:14] Hallelujah. So therefore, we know very
[51:18] well that in the olden days when he
[51:21] brought the Israelites from Egypt and he
[51:24] set the army in
[51:26] array, he he divided them into four
[51:30] groups. I would say first battalion,
[51:33] second battalion, uh third battalion and
[51:35] the fourth
[51:37] battalion and in all these groups of
[51:40] armies, they were to protect Israel.
[51:42] They were to fight for Israel because of
[51:44] the safety of Israel.
[51:47] He made Simeon um uh uh Reuben to to be
[51:50] a leader of one group, Judah one group,
[51:54] Dan one group, and Ephraim one
[51:57] group. And in the midst of these four
[51:59] groups, that was what I love. And I want
[52:02] to catch you. I want you to catch
[52:03] something here. In the midst of these
[52:05] four groups of army, the the Levites
[52:09] were there. Amen. The Levites who were
[52:12] handling the operations of God's, you
[52:15] know, duties in the temple, they were in
[52:18] the midst with the ark.
[52:21] So when Israel is moving to battle with
[52:25] the ark of God in their midst, who is
[52:28] the
[52:29] enemy and it give some kind of boldness
[52:33] to Israel? Because of the covenant,
[52:35] because of the ark. And today we are
[52:38] also bold because of the word of God
[52:40] that God have given to us. Praise be the
[52:43] name of our God. Are you with me this
[52:46] morning? Are you with me this morning?
[52:49] Are you alive? Amen. Then let me hear
[52:51] you say amen. Amen.
[52:55] Brother brother Roger, God bless you, my
[52:57] brother. Amen. You see when you came
[53:01] when when we came came back to the book
[53:03] of
[53:04] revelation, you
[53:06] know the devil always want to go
[53:11] unrecognized. That is what the prophet
[53:12] told us.
[53:15] But what the devil didn't know was that
[53:18] God have already
[53:20] provided security for his people.
[53:25] So even around the throne of God we have
[53:29] four living creatures.
[53:32] Somewhere the Bible say there are four
[53:34] beasts.
[53:35] And the prophet said that the beast
[53:37] means power.
[53:40] He say one have a face like a
[53:42] lion. Another have the face like a a a
[53:46] an
[53:47] ox, another have a face like a man,
[53:51] another have a face like a flying eagle.
[53:56] And the prophet called them the throne
[53:57] guard. They guide the throne of God
[54:00] because of the bride.
[54:03] Because of the antichrist for the sake
[54:05] of the bride. Amen. So when the
[54:08] antichrist came in a form to deceive the
[54:13] people in a color of
[54:17] white, one of those power alerted the
[54:21] bride
[54:23] said look at that guy going
[54:27] don't take him to be Jesus Christ. Amen
[54:30] because he's using a white color.
[54:32] No, but others took it to be
[54:35] Jesus. But those two were under the
[54:38] shadow of the Almighty. They caught the
[54:40] revelation that no, we can't worship
[54:43] that one because it's an impersonator.
[54:49] He went back and came with the color red
[54:52] and that was when they were killing the,
[54:54] you know, the believers because they
[54:55] were standing for God. That's right.
[54:59] But at the same time, God made a
[55:02] way by using that spirit, the face like
[55:06] an ox. You all these is a sacrificial
[55:10] lamp.
[55:12] They spilled the blood of the believers
[55:14] at that time. Amen.
[55:18] The devil did not succeed. He came back
[55:20] with dark black and that was the time
[55:23] that they took the truth of God away
[55:25] from the church.
[55:28] when Constantine or Constantine that's
[55:31] how you pronounce it but we pronounce
[55:33] Constantine Hallelujah when he merge id
[55:37] adidoly and Christianity
[55:40] together and it took completely the word
[55:44] of God
[55:46] away and people started feeding on dogma
[55:50] instead of the word they started
[55:53] worshiping
[55:55] images they started teaching the people
[55:58] to pay even for their sins.
[56:01] They introduce something they call
[56:02] penance, pagotry and all that which is
[56:06] not found in the Bible.
[56:09] And at that point, God used the spirit
[56:12] that have the face of a man and he used
[56:15] people like Martin Luther and the rest
[56:17] to bring the truth back to the church.
[56:19] Amen. So the the just shall live by
[56:22] faith
[56:24] because brother without this security
[56:26] all the people will get lost but for the
[56:30] sake of the elect God put this security
[56:33] for us. Hallelujah. And when the devils
[56:36] realize that the battle he has lost it
[56:39] then he went back and mixed all the
[56:41] colors and now he came with a pale color
[56:44] still trying to deceive. But thank God
[56:47] that was the time that the face of the
[56:51] flying eagle was also in operation.
[56:55] And you know as high as the eagle flies
[56:58] the clearer is it sees on the ground.
[57:01] Satan don't want to be recognized but
[57:03] thank God for the eagle spirit. And
[57:06] thank God that you are living in that
[57:08] age now and the spirit that is working
[57:11] around you is the eagle spirit. That is
[57:14] why by his grace today we open our eyes
[57:17] into the word of God and we know what
[57:20] the truth is.
[57:23] Today we turn the pages of the
[57:26] scriptures and we know how to baptize a
[57:29] believer. Amen. Today we turn the pages
[57:32] of the scriptures and we know how to
[57:34] live as Christians. Amen. Today we turn
[57:37] the pages of the Bible and we know that
[57:39] we don't need to bow down to any graven
[57:41] image.
[57:44] because we are under the shadow of the
[57:48] almighty.
[57:50] Praise be the name of our
[57:52] God. Brother, sister,
[57:55] today I know you have already have the
[57:59] information that uh there is there is a
[58:03] leader of the most popular church in the
[58:06] world uh who has come from the United
[58:09] States. Amen.
[58:12] And they say the pope from America. The
[58:13] pope from America. Well, the prophet
[58:15] said the pope from the United
[58:19] States. And today, brother, when you
[58:22] when you listen to the news from Africa,
[58:25] Pentecostal pastors, Pentecarismatic
[58:28] ministers who who preach not believing
[58:31] even the message, they are all preaching
[58:32] about this
[58:34] prophecy. Ah, I said, "Wow, they are
[58:37] preaching then they should preach it
[58:38] well."
[58:40] After all, they have come to believe
[58:42] that God sent a man called William
[58:44] Abraham and he prophesied down and and
[58:47] they are fulfilling day by day and night
[58:49] by then they should preach it well.
[58:53] Hallelujah. They should declare to their
[58:54] people that yes, there was a man called
[58:56] William Mariam Brown.
[58:59] With a message from God, it was not
[59:02] Miriam Bra's message, but it's a message
[59:06] of Jesus Christ. But he used him as a
[59:08] prophet.
[59:10] Oh, praise the name of our God. I
[59:12] remember when uh Moses told the people
[59:15] that uh uh the Lord your God will raise
[59:17] a prophet like unto
[59:21] me and if you don't listen to him,
[59:24] you'll be cut off from among your
[59:26] people.
[59:28] And today I don't care how people claim
[59:30] they are Christians. There is only one
[59:33] source of Christianity. There is only
[59:35] one place where you can have your
[59:37] security. Amen.
[59:40] Oh brother, sister, I I wish that their
[59:43] eyes will be opened and believe the
[59:46] message. Amen. So brother, whether we
[59:49] like it or
[59:50] not, it's here with us, we've got a pope
[59:54] from the United
[59:55] States. And what that mean to the
[59:59] bride? What does that mean to the
[1:00:01] believer? It means that we should be
[1:00:04] ready. We should be alert.
[1:00:08] There is no time for jokes any longer.
[1:00:10] Because sometimes we we think that we
[1:00:13] have enough time ahead.
[1:00:16] No. That is why he said whatever we are
[1:00:19] doing we should continue to
[1:00:21] do but we should be ready.
[1:00:27] The reason why he said we should look
[1:00:29] for this happening is that the moment
[1:00:34] this thing come to be or pass things are
[1:00:38] going to go
[1:00:39] fast. That was the reason why the
[1:00:41] prophet said that that's why he said we
[1:00:44] should wait for the United States
[1:00:46] Pope. And this man came in the name of a
[1:00:50] lion.
[1:00:54] Then you know what a lion can do. A lion
[1:00:57] destroy, a lion
[1:00:59] divorce. Hallelujah. A lion is terrible.
[1:01:03] When a lion roar, every other creature
[1:01:07] stand
[1:01:08] still. So a lion is going to roar in the
[1:01:11] world soon and very soon. And the world
[1:01:14] is going to see what is going to
[1:01:16] happen, brother, sister. But I thank God
[1:01:19] for my life and I thank God for your
[1:01:21] life
[1:01:23] because there is no state of fear in
[1:01:27] us. We are standing firm on the word of
[1:01:30] God.
[1:01:32] We will not be shaken to the left or to
[1:01:35] the right.
[1:01:38] Where Jesus established the church and
[1:01:41] he said the gate of hell cannot prevail
[1:01:43] against it. That is where we are
[1:01:45] standing. Amen.
[1:01:47] Malachi 4 is in operation.
[1:01:51] Luke 17:30 is still in operation.
[1:01:54] Revelation 10 is still in operation. So
[1:01:57] where is the
[1:01:58] fear? The Lord have taken off from us
[1:02:02] because we are under his protective
[1:02:05] wings.
[1:02:06] Amen. We are under his protective wings.
[1:02:10] My brother and sister, you see a time is
[1:02:12] coming
[1:02:13] soon and this is the
[1:02:17] time that the foolish virgins will go
[1:02:21] and take
[1:02:23] oil. And they have started
[1:02:26] going. But when they came back, the door
[1:02:30] was shut.
[1:02:36] But the question I always ask myself is
[1:02:41] that did they get the
[1:02:45] oil when they went to
[1:02:47] buy? Did they get
[1:02:50] it? And even if they got it, what was
[1:02:55] the
[1:02:56] use? Because the bridegroom has come
[1:03:00] already. And the wise virgins who had
[1:03:03] oil in their lamps which is the message
[1:03:06] of this hour we are preaching. They have
[1:03:09] already entered with the bridegroom.
[1:03:14] They will soon start going for the
[1:03:17] oil. Brother the message that we are
[1:03:21] believing by God's grace the moment we
[1:03:24] enter into the rapture we are taking
[1:03:26] every power of it away.
[1:03:29] We are not going to leave any arms of
[1:03:31] the Holy Ghost on this
[1:03:34] earth. Hallelujah. It's because of you.
[1:03:38] That is why the Holy Ghost is here. So
[1:03:41] the moment the rapture take place, where
[1:03:42] is the Holy Ghost operation again on
[1:03:44] earth? No. That is why the world will be
[1:03:47] plunged into destruction, tribulation
[1:03:50] here and there. But you have a good time
[1:03:53] with the Lord. Hallelujah. Over there at
[1:03:56] the marish supper.
[1:03:58] Amen. So we thank God that he has placed
[1:04:01] us under the shadow of the
[1:04:05] Almighty. It is not your
[1:04:08] choice but it must always be the choice
[1:04:10] of God. Can I hear amen from you?
[1:04:14] Amen. It's a hard statement but that is
[1:04:16] it. I say it is not your choice. It is
[1:04:19] always the choice of God. Amen.
[1:04:22] Uh yesterday I was uh I was
[1:04:26] uh having a good time with my brother uh
[1:04:29] Ron
[1:04:30] and with my sister and my
[1:04:34] niece and brother Ron made a statement.
[1:04:36] I said brother Ron this statement I love
[1:04:40] it
[1:04:42] mine. He said God don't need to explain
[1:04:46] anything to you brother John. He said
[1:04:48] whatever we go through whether good or
[1:04:51] bad whether sweet or sour he said God
[1:04:54] don't need to explain anything
[1:05:01] and I saluted my brother Ron I said
[1:05:04] brother Ron you have blessed my
[1:05:06] soul because sometime we got to a point
[1:05:08] we go why is this so why is it so there
[1:05:12] is no answer to that
[1:05:16] hallelujah I I mean just just imagine
[1:05:19] beloved when God was going to take
[1:05:22] Israel from Egypt okay after he struck
[1:05:26] Egypt with you know those so many
[1:05:28] plagues and and all that and it left
[1:05:31] with the only one's plague which was
[1:05:32] going to be the death of the
[1:05:35] firstborns. I mean, why will God tell
[1:05:38] prophet Moses that? Tell Israel, tell
[1:05:42] them to kill lambs. Tell them to apply
[1:05:46] the blood at the lentils of the door for
[1:05:49] I'm going to send a death angel tonight.
[1:05:52] Why will God do that?
[1:05:54] He is all powerful.
[1:05:57] God could have just said Moses, let the
[1:06:00] people come out. But God didn't do that
[1:06:02] way.
[1:06:04] He said let them kill lamb and let them
[1:06:08] apply the blood at the lentils
[1:06:12] and that when I see the blood I will
[1:06:15] pass over them. Amen. That was the
[1:06:19] condition. Nobody can ask God a
[1:06:22] question. The only thing he was looking
[1:06:24] for is to obey the instruction.
[1:06:29] Obey thou sayeth the Lord. Amen. And
[1:06:33] what I love was that he said when they
[1:06:35] kill the animal also they should not put
[1:06:38] they should not put the flesh in in you
[1:06:40] know in water or whatever to to boil it
[1:06:43] but they should put the flesh directly
[1:06:45] on the fire
[1:06:50] on the fire. And while they are roasting
[1:06:52] it they should they should eat it in
[1:06:53] haste with bitter herbs
[1:06:56] with their loins gathered because it was
[1:06:58] the Lord's Passover. Amen.
[1:07:01] Beloved, we have reached a point that we
[1:07:06] should not we should not think we should
[1:07:09] not think that we should be pumped. We
[1:07:12] should we should we should always try to
[1:07:14] be rugged as the prophet said it. We we
[1:07:18] don't need to be
[1:07:19] pumped. We don't pump Christians.
[1:07:24] Hallelujah. We don't pump Christians
[1:07:27] because we are placed directly on the
[1:07:28] firemen. The word of God being the fire,
[1:07:31] the Holy Ghost. It must burn every fat
[1:07:34] of sin from us. Amen. It must burn every
[1:07:38] fat of unbelief from us. Hallelujah. But
[1:07:42] God said when I see the blood, I will
[1:07:45] pass over you. That is all I want to to
[1:07:47] to
[1:07:48] see. Brother, sister, you can never tell
[1:07:51] me that, oh, you are you are Israeli.
[1:07:53] You are you are an Israelite. you are a
[1:07:55] descendant of uh of Mos I'm sorry uh uh
[1:07:58] Jacob, Abraham and whoever. So because
[1:08:02] of that you you are secured. No, you'll
[1:08:04] be deceiving yourself.
[1:08:07] Hallelujah. God knew that you were you
[1:08:09] are you are a descendant of Abraham. You
[1:08:12] were descendant of Isaac, Jacob and
[1:08:14] whosoever. But he said apply the blood.
[1:08:19] Hallelujah.
[1:08:21] In fact the death angel person Excuse
[1:08:26] me. I'm getting warm now.
[1:08:30] The death angel
[1:08:33] passing. It is not the duty of the
[1:08:36] angel to
[1:08:38] knock at the
[1:08:41] door and
[1:08:43] inquire who are those in this
[1:08:47] house. How many Israelis are
[1:08:51] there? H is there any Egyptian here? No,
[1:08:55] that is not the duty of the of the
[1:08:56] angel.
[1:08:58] The duty of the angel is to only see to
[1:09:01] the blood application.
[1:09:04] So the moment they see the blood they
[1:09:08] pass over.
[1:09:10] Hallelujah. That was all the
[1:09:13] requirement and that was the safety zone
[1:09:16] that God gave to his
[1:09:18] people under the blood
[1:09:20] application. And today we are also under
[1:09:23] a similar
[1:09:25] zone which is the revealed word of God
[1:09:29] by God's own
[1:09:31] prophet. That is where our security is.
[1:09:34] It is in the word but not in the man.
[1:09:38] Amen. the word of God revealed. Amen.
[1:09:42] Hallelujah. The angel don't have any
[1:09:45] business at all. Sometime I used to ask
[1:09:47] myself a question. He says, "So if it
[1:09:50] was so and
[1:09:52] perhaps perhaps I'm I'm using the word
[1:09:55] perhaps if an Egyptian got that
[1:09:59] information, okay, and rush to any
[1:10:03] Israeli brother
[1:10:04] Orlando and perhaps saying, "Oh, brother
[1:10:07] Orlando, you know that I am your friend
[1:10:11] even though I'm Egyptian, but I have got
[1:10:14] a secret. I've got a hint that God is
[1:10:17] going to destroy. We the Egyptians are
[1:10:19] firstborns. But then he have given you
[1:10:21] some blood application. Will you let me
[1:10:24] come under your chef? Will you let me
[1:10:26] come under your roof?
[1:10:29] And perhaps if brother Orlando give that
[1:10:31] Egyptians chance to enter into his
[1:10:33] house, this is my mind because of the
[1:10:36] blood application
[1:10:38] that
[1:10:39] Egyptians will be saved.
[1:10:42] Amen. Because I said the angel was not
[1:10:45] you know given the order to inquire how
[1:10:48] many people are there. The only thing
[1:10:51] was to see the blood application.
[1:10:54] But
[1:10:56] unfortunately when the instructions also
[1:10:59] come they always come to the children of
[1:11:04] God and not to the
[1:11:07] unbelievers. I are you understand what I
[1:11:09] mean?
[1:11:11] When God want to give any you know
[1:11:14] guidance to his people, he does it
[1:11:18] secretly. It is not
[1:11:21] openly. You you may think that this
[1:11:23] message is so popular. It's not popular.
[1:11:26] This
[1:11:27] message is not popular.
[1:11:30] It's a secret message. Yes, it is. Well,
[1:11:33] it's unfortunate that today all over the
[1:11:35] internet the message is there. The
[1:11:37] pictures of the prophet is there. Well,
[1:11:39] people are praising him, some others are
[1:11:40] condemning him and here and there. But
[1:11:43] yet still the message that I've given
[1:11:45] you is
[1:11:47] salvation is a secret message.
[1:11:52] Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] Because covenant with covenant between
[1:11:58] God and his children, it is always done
[1:12:01] in secrecy.
[1:12:03] It's always done in secrecy. Is not
[1:12:06] open. Hallelujah.
[1:12:09] You remember the woman called
[1:12:13] Rahab? This woman
[1:12:16] uh everybody knows what her business
[1:12:20] used to be.
[1:12:23] And uh
[1:12:25] nobody
[1:12:27] nobody in those times will give respect
[1:12:31] to that
[1:12:32] woman because she was a prostitute. That
[1:12:35] was a trade. that was a business.
[1:12:39] And for that matter, she she built her
[1:12:42] house on the edge of the walls of
[1:12:45] Jericho because when um the the
[1:12:48] merchants are coming in, she'll be the
[1:12:51] first to see them and you will transact
[1:12:54] transaction with them. Come to my house
[1:12:56] and come and make yourself
[1:12:59] happy. But deep down in the heart of
[1:13:02] this woman, there was something that
[1:13:05] called revelation.
[1:13:10] One
[1:13:14] day she received two men into her
[1:13:18] house.
[1:13:20] H and that day was a different
[1:13:24] day. Normally when she see the men like
[1:13:27] that she know that they are coming for a
[1:13:29] business. But these two men oh no
[1:13:34] something fell on the woman.
[1:13:36] And she recognized that no, these are
[1:13:38] not ordinary men. These are men, God's
[1:13:41] own messengers. So the Bible said that
[1:13:44] she treated them very well until even
[1:13:47] she hid this man in her roof. And the
[1:13:51] soldiers came looking for them and they
[1:13:53] were nowhere to be found. Amen. And
[1:13:55] after she treated this man very well,
[1:13:58] before the men will leave her house,
[1:14:01] Rahab said, "Men of God, we know that
[1:14:05] God have given you this land and you are
[1:14:07] coming to take the land, but I want you
[1:14:10] to give me an assurance that I will not
[1:14:12] be destroyed with the people." Can we
[1:14:14] imagine a
[1:14:15] prostitute? He said, "I want you to give
[1:14:18] me a true token. Give me a I know, we
[1:14:21] know, we have heard that God gave you a
[1:14:24] token.
[1:14:25] and you were saved from those
[1:14:27] destruction in Egypt. So that token, if
[1:14:30] you still have it with you, I want it.
[1:14:33] Give it to me because I've done good to
[1:14:36] you. My what a request. But Salmon and
[1:14:41] the other man have no option but to
[1:14:44] listen to the woman and give her her
[1:14:47] desire because after all, she did good
[1:14:50] to them.
[1:14:53] Huh. Then they look at the woman. They
[1:14:56] say,
[1:14:59] "Woman, this
[1:15:01] thread that we are going to desert
[1:15:05] by when you hear that we are coming, tie
[1:15:09] it, tie it at your window and let it
[1:15:14] fly and that will be your token."
[1:15:18] You see what I
[1:15:19] love about God and his people is that
[1:15:22] whenever God
[1:15:23] give a a a
[1:15:25] token, okay, to his children, he does it
[1:15:29] in secret.
[1:15:32] But when they are applying it, they have
[1:15:34] to apply it openly.
[1:15:38] Hallelujah. And so Rahab accepted it and
[1:15:41] they asked Rahab, "Go and call your
[1:15:44] father, go and call your mother, go and
[1:15:46] call all your
[1:15:48] siblings. If they want salvation, if
[1:15:51] they want to be saved, they should come
[1:15:54] to your house."
[1:15:57] We don't care how polluted that place
[1:16:01] is. They should come to your
[1:16:03] house and they will be saved.
[1:16:06] And the moment the men left Rahab, in
[1:16:10] fact, Rahab did not wait to hear that
[1:16:13] they were
[1:16:14] coming, immediately she tied that
[1:16:18] scarlet thread rope at the window and it
[1:16:21] started flying. The token was displayed.
[1:16:24] Or if you have the Holy Ghost in you,
[1:16:26] what are you waiting for?
[1:16:28] What are you waiting for? Before you
[1:16:31] tell people about the gospel of Jesus
[1:16:33] Christ, if the talking is you, if the
[1:16:35] Holy Ghost is in you, what are you
[1:16:37] waiting for? For you to let unbelievers
[1:16:39] see your
[1:16:41] Christianity. Sometime people get to a
[1:16:44] place and they are they are even
[1:16:46] shy to correct
[1:16:48] situations. Sometime people get to a
[1:16:50] place and they are shy to open their
[1:16:52] mouth and correct people when they are
[1:16:55] even
[1:16:56] blaspheing on the word of
[1:16:58] God. No.
[1:17:01] demonstrate the Holy Ghost. Demonstrate
[1:17:03] the talking because Rahab did it and it
[1:17:06] served for a good purpose. And brother,
[1:17:10] I love it. The Bible say that Rahab went
[1:17:13] out and Rahab tried started testifying
[1:17:16] about the gospel of Jesus Christ, about
[1:17:18] the token of Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ. Well, I used to demonstrate it
[1:17:24] this way.
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:25] baby while she is telling the people
[1:17:29] about the token about the safety zone in
[1:17:32] her own house. Ah
[1:17:35] Rahab I should come to your
[1:17:38] house for
[1:17:40] safety, your polluted
[1:17:42] house. Oh your house that you have have
[1:17:46] thousands and thousands and millions of
[1:17:48] men defiling that place. I should come
[1:17:51] there.
[1:17:53] Well, perhaps you are making a
[1:17:56] mistake. Once upon a time, it was a
[1:18:00] polluted
[1:18:01] house, but now is a house of the Holy
[1:18:05] Ghost. Amen.
[1:18:07] Hallelujah. If God is to look to the the
[1:18:11] kind of the kind of character and
[1:18:14] behavior that we used to be
[1:18:17] in, who will even be fit
[1:18:22] to mention the name of Jesus Christ?
[1:18:26] Once I was a sinner,
[1:18:29] but now I am saved by grace.
[1:18:33] And that is why Rahab was so bold to
[1:18:36] tell the folks that hey the Rahab you
[1:18:41] knew is not the same today. This is a
[1:18:45] new Rahab. Hallelujah. I was a
[1:18:49] prostitute at that time and I was doing
[1:18:51] the double a service but today I am
[1:18:53] evangelist Rahab. Amen. And I'm working
[1:18:56] for Jesus Christ. If you want salvation
[1:18:59] come to my house.
[1:19:03] and they will look down upon her and
[1:19:05] they will scold her and they laughed
[1:19:07] her. I mean a whole lot of
[1:19:10] things but that did not discourage
[1:19:14] Rahab. Rahab went on. In fact the Bible
[1:19:17] say the Bible say when uh uh Jericho was
[1:19:24] destroyed the house of Rahab was
[1:19:27] situated on the walls. All the walls of
[1:19:30] Jericho got broken. People died. But the
[1:19:33] house of Rahab stood. You know why? The
[1:19:37] reason was that the Holy Ghost was in
[1:19:39] that house. Amen.
[1:19:41] Was that house? Amen. Amen. And so for
[1:19:44] that matter, Rahab was saved and all his
[1:19:48] siblings, the Bible said that his
[1:19:50] father, his mother, and everyone that
[1:19:51] listened to Rahab's instruction came
[1:19:54] under that shadow of the Almighty and
[1:19:57] they were saved.
[1:19:58] Oh brother, my sister, thank God that
[1:20:01] today we have the message of the hour
[1:20:05] which is our salvation point is our
[1:20:08] salvation zone. Brother, there is
[1:20:09] nothing like the message.
[1:20:13] I said there is nothing like the
[1:20:15] message. Amen.
[1:20:18] When the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:20:20] didn't agree on the same
[1:20:23] doctrine, but when they wanted to kill
[1:20:26] the word, which is Jesus Christ, they
[1:20:29] came together.
[1:20:31] And when they killed Jesus, remember the
[1:20:33] moment the Bible said the moment Jesus
[1:20:35] gave up the ghost on the cross, the
[1:20:38] whole world became
[1:20:41] dark because he was the source of life.
[1:20:44] He said whether you believe it or not so
[1:20:47] long as I am in the world I am the light
[1:20:49] of the world.
[1:20:52] Hallelujah. So the moment they kill him
[1:20:55] everything went on its way
[1:20:59] and brother the same thing is going to
[1:21:00] happen today in this our time. Amen. The
[1:21:05] world is coming together.
[1:21:08] Nations are coming together
[1:21:11] and they are trying to going to squeeze
[1:21:12] with the bride of Christ. You know why?
[1:21:15] Because we have the power of God. We
[1:21:17] have the word of God. We have the
[1:21:18] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:21] This is the only place the truth of God
[1:21:23] is.
[1:21:26] But the prophet
[1:21:28] said we are the last brideg group.
[1:21:33] And for that matter, Jesus will not
[1:21:36] allow them to kill us. like how they
[1:21:39] killed Andrew, how they killed Peter,
[1:21:42] how they killed I mean all the rest. He
[1:21:45] said when they start the
[1:21:47] squeeze, the rapture will take place. So
[1:21:50] rest assured on that take fear from you.
[1:21:55] Don't be afraid. Don't entertain any
[1:21:57] fear. That's right. Because there has
[1:21:59] been an United States Pope. Yes. We pray
[1:22:02] that the prophecies will
[1:22:05] fulfill you know
[1:22:07] rapidly because we I mean look look at
[1:22:12] the situation look at the condition of
[1:22:13] man
[1:22:15] today. Where is man going? Where is man
[1:22:19] taking this world to?
[1:22:23] But the great landlord,
[1:22:26] the one that created the universe, he
[1:22:28] has to come and take his possession.
[1:22:33] Hallelujah. Let's remain under that
[1:22:36] safety zone. Let us remain in the
[1:22:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ. Let us
[1:22:43] remain in the revelation of the word of
[1:22:45] God. Let us remain by the token that God
[1:22:48] have given to us. Amen.
[1:22:51] Praise be the name of our God.
[1:22:53] The last time I was here, I think I gave
[1:22:54] a testimony about the police officer in
[1:22:57] my church.
[1:23:00] You know why the didn't kill
[1:23:03] him?
[1:23:05] Because she took he took his refuge in
[1:23:09] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:23:12] Which is the
[1:23:13] message. He told the people that I
[1:23:16] believe the message. There is a message
[1:23:18] that I believe
[1:23:20] the wicked doctor wouldn't manipulate
[1:23:23] his powers to kill him because he has
[1:23:27] Jesus in him.
[1:23:31] Oh hallelujah.
[1:23:33] The wicked doctor said I have tried and
[1:23:35] tried and tried and that is the way I
[1:23:38] have used to kill a lot of people. He
[1:23:41] said, "I inherited this from my
[1:23:43] father, but on you I've tried and tried
[1:23:47] and tried but I'm not able to get you."
[1:23:51] That is why I want to find out what kind
[1:23:54] of idol are you
[1:23:56] worshiping. The brother said, "No, I
[1:23:58] don't worship any idol. I worship Jesus
[1:24:01] Christ."
[1:24:04] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:06] Brother, we have testimonies.
[1:24:11] We have testimony not because we want to
[1:24:14] have but it because of what Jesus Christ
[1:24:18] is doing in our life daily.
[1:24:24] Hallelujah. As a child of God, believing
[1:24:27] the word of
[1:24:29] God, you are secured.
[1:24:33] I say you are secured. Amen.
[1:24:37] There is a there is another testimony
[1:24:39] about uh uh uh uh David
[1:24:43] Livingston when
[1:24:46] uh when he came to Africa in those in
[1:24:49] those
[1:24:50] years. Uh but then
[1:24:54] um a
[1:24:56] missionary earlier on went to Africa in
[1:24:59] those years you know did missionary
[1:25:02] work and the story says that the
[1:25:06] missionary real like Jesus said he say
[1:25:09] the harvest is plenty but the laborers
[1:25:11] are few.
[1:25:13] So he went back to his ascending country
[1:25:18] which is Scotland and uh proclaimed that
[1:25:22] hey
[1:25:23] beloved there is a lot of work to be
[1:25:26] done in Africa because in those days is
[1:25:29] nothing but idol worshiping killings
[1:25:31] here and there people kill human being
[1:25:33] to sacrifice to their idols in real no
[1:25:36] the mission must be severe there so they
[1:25:39] need more people on the
[1:25:41] field. So when he went there and did
[1:25:43] this proclamation said that day even a
[1:25:46] lot of people didn't come to church that
[1:25:47] day but he was not
[1:25:49] discouraged but he said it
[1:25:52] anyhow and then that time the living was
[1:25:54] a small boy on the organ somewhere and
[1:25:57] he said the man said who will go for us
[1:26:00] who will go for us three times and this
[1:26:02] young lad got up and said I will go I
[1:26:05] will go I will
[1:26:08] go said
[1:26:09] well then I'll pray
[1:26:13] heart you grow and then uh you be a
[1:26:17] doctor in the
[1:26:19] future. So when you go there you are not
[1:26:21] going only to preach the word but you I
[1:26:23] mean attend to the sick and all that and
[1:26:26] eventually it happened the same as the
[1:26:27] man said. So David Livingston grew
[1:26:30] according to the story he grew and he
[1:26:33] came to Africa as a
[1:26:37] missionary and then
[1:26:40] uh started his mission work preaching
[1:26:43] here and there and there was a native
[1:26:46] man I mean king who didn't like the idea
[1:26:50] because they they went to him trying to
[1:26:53] you know evangelize to bring him to
[1:26:55] Jesus and they didn't like it because it
[1:26:57] will take their idol worshiing And
[1:26:59] that's what they hated.
[1:27:01] So they decided to go one particular
[1:27:04] night, okay, to go and kill David
[1:27:06] Livingston and kill all the
[1:27:10] members.
[1:27:14] Ah, they sent a message to David that
[1:27:18] they were
[1:27:19] coming. So David also had no option but
[1:27:22] to pray.
[1:27:24] And he prayed to the Lord said,
[1:27:27] "Lord, please I am here to do your work.
[1:27:32] Save me and save my people. Save the
[1:27:35] compound people from all this, you know,
[1:27:38] determination by the king." And he said,
[1:27:41] "Amen." A very short prayer.
[1:27:45] So what happened was that the king
[1:27:48] didn't show
[1:27:50] up but it was not quite
[1:27:54] long. Then by God's own grace the king
[1:27:57] now believe the word and accepted Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ
[1:28:02] with almost all you know his his uh
[1:28:07] Yeah.
[1:28:09] So they started attending
[1:28:11] church and then one day David asked the
[1:28:14] king, "King, I remember some time ago
[1:28:17] you sent an you sent me a message that
[1:28:21] you were coming to kill me and kill all
[1:28:22] the people in the compound. Why didn't
[1:28:24] you
[1:28:25] come?" He said, "We
[1:28:29] came." Amen. The king said, "We came
[1:28:34] but before we
[1:28:37] struck, we saw 39
[1:28:40] giants standing all over
[1:28:42] you. They have surrounded you because we
[1:28:45] were afraid. That is why we couldn't
[1:28:47] strike and we went back." Amen.
[1:28:51] Hallelujah.
[1:28:53] My David said, "Praise God." Amen. So it
[1:28:56] means you came to destroy us really but
[1:28:59] because you came to see a giant as you
[1:29:02] are saying you left. Praise God.
[1:29:07] Then a time came and David have to go
[1:29:09] back to
[1:29:10] Scotland to report on the mission as we
[1:29:14] come and report our mission work. Right?
[1:29:17] So he gave this testimony.
[1:29:20] Then the secretary of the church asked
[1:29:24] him, "Do you remember that particular
[1:29:27] day?" He said, "Yes, I have it on my my
[1:29:29] diary." And he gave him the
[1:29:31] date. When the secretary opened the
[1:29:34] church diary
[1:29:36] also he she realized that that
[1:29:39] particular day there were 39 church
[1:29:42] members attend church and that night
[1:29:45] they were praying soly for David and the
[1:29:48] work that he was doing down there.
[1:29:53] 39 people in Scotland praying and God
[1:29:56] sent 39 angels to go and surround David
[1:29:59] and his church.
[1:30:02] Hallelujah. So David said, "He that
[1:30:05] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[1:30:07] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:30:09] almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is
[1:30:12] my refuge and my fortress, my God, in
[1:30:15] him will I trust."
[1:30:21] Beloved, don't get
[1:30:24] worried. Don't get tired. Amen. Continue
[1:30:28] with this message. Amen. For there's
[1:30:30] nothing like
[1:30:32] this. The best thing God have give in
[1:30:36] this life is the word of God. Amen. In
[1:30:40] fact, the word of God revealed.
[1:30:43] That is the best thing.
[1:30:46] Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] Amen. Let me touch the verse 9 of uh
[1:30:55] what do we call it? Psalm 91. He said,
[1:30:57] "Because thou hast made the Lord, which
[1:31:00] is my refuge, even the most high thy
[1:31:05] habitation, there shall no evil before
[1:31:08] thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
[1:31:11] thy dwelling."
[1:31:13] Amen. Hallelujah. Nothing will come
[1:31:16] around you, brother, sister. For he
[1:31:18] shall give his angels charge over thee,
[1:31:22] and he gave angels charge over David
[1:31:25] Livingston.
[1:31:29] Because believers were praying,
[1:31:33] brother, pray for us.
[1:31:36] And we are also praying for you.
[1:31:42] For he shall give his angels charge over
[1:31:44] thee, to keep thee in all thy
[1:31:47] ways. They shall bear thee up in thy
[1:31:50] hands in their hands, lest thou dash thy
[1:31:53] foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread
[1:31:56] upon the lion and other the young lions
[1:31:59] and the dragon shalt thou trample under
[1:32:02] feet because he has set his love upon
[1:32:05] me. Therefore will I deliver him. I will
[1:32:09] set him on high because he had known my
[1:32:13] name. The name of the Lord is a strong
[1:32:16] tower and the righteous like you run
[1:32:19] into it and they are saved. Amen. We
[1:32:22] have our security in the name of Jesus
[1:32:24] Christ. He said at the mention of that
[1:32:26] name, every knee must bow. So if you
[1:32:30] have that name in your possession, what
[1:32:32] should you be afraid of?
[1:32:35] Nothing. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
[1:32:39] Because the name Jesus take fear from
[1:32:41] us. It give us boldness and sound mind.
[1:32:46] It make us prepare for the journey.
[1:32:49] because without him there's no way. Say
[1:32:53] I am the way, the truth and the life. I
[1:32:57] want the believer to say amen here.
[1:33:01] He said he shall call upon me and I will
[1:33:04] answer him. I will be with him in
[1:33:07] trouble. I will deliver him and honor
[1:33:10] him with long life will I satisfy him
[1:33:14] and show him my salvation.
[1:33:17] Praise the name of our God. And
[1:33:19] Leviticus, as we read, he said,
[1:33:21] "Wherefore ye shall do my status, and
[1:33:23] keep my judgment, and do them, and ye
[1:33:26] shall dwell in the land in safety, and
[1:33:29] the land shall yield her fruit, and ye
[1:33:31] shall eat your field, and dwell therein
[1:33:34] in safety." Amen. Amen.
[1:33:40] Let me let me read this quote from the
[1:33:42] prophet. Okay? Amen.
[1:33:45] He
[1:33:47] said the waves can
[1:33:51] beat and baffle and sickness can
[1:33:56] come,
[1:33:57] death can come. Anything
[1:34:01] else, but you are safe ever more.
[1:34:05] Thank you for saying amen,
[1:34:07] brothers. He said Christ our
[1:34:10] refuge, God's provided place of safety.
[1:34:15] So I want you to understand here beloved
[1:34:17] that your safety is not in anything.
[1:34:22] Your safety is not in the security of
[1:34:25] any man.
[1:34:27] It's not in the wealth of America.
[1:34:30] It's not in the wealth of Europe or
[1:34:33] anywhere.
[1:34:35] But your safety is only in the name of
[1:34:38] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:34:42] Well, some say they are going to make
[1:34:43] America great again. Well, we are
[1:34:45] looking, we are
[1:34:47] watching. Yes,
[1:34:49] sir. The prophet got to your place say
[1:34:52] I'm not praying for America again.
[1:34:55] Because he have seen where America have
[1:34:57] reached.
[1:35:00] If somebody say we are making, praise
[1:35:02] God for that. Let's make America again.
[1:35:04] But let's watch the word of God.
[1:35:09] Hallelujah. Amen. He said the only
[1:35:11] provided place of safety is in Jesus
[1:35:14] Christ.
[1:35:15] Christ is the only place of safety for
[1:35:18] those who want to live.
[1:35:21] You see the condition here for those who
[1:35:24] want to live. Amen.
[1:35:28] I preach here and I said it is when you
[1:35:32] accept what God have introduced to
[1:35:37] you, then it will work for you.
[1:35:41] When you accept it, it will work for
[1:35:44] you. Mary said, "Let it be unto me
[1:35:48] according to your word." Amen. I am a
[1:35:51] virgin and you are telling me that I am
[1:35:53] going to conceive mysteriously
[1:35:56] supernaturally. Well, I accept it
[1:36:00] according to your word.
[1:36:05] Today we have to say the same thing.
[1:36:07] Lord, let it be done unto me according
[1:36:10] to your word. You don't need any
[1:36:12] explanation to give to me. Amen.
[1:36:17] Oh, praise God.
[1:36:21] Hallelujah. He said the only one that
[1:36:24] has eternal life, there is no church, no
[1:36:28] denomination, no president, no king, no
[1:36:31] pope, no bishop, no minister, no
[1:36:35] anything can give you safety but Jesus
[1:36:38] Christ.
[1:36:40] That's right.
[1:36:43] Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] Oh, last when uh you you look to the
[1:36:48] news when people were crying, people
[1:36:51] were so happy because there has been a
[1:36:54] new pope. They were sharing tears, tears
[1:36:57] of joy. Oh, amen.
[1:37:01] And after the tears of joy, you go and
[1:37:03] bow down to the image of Mary.
[1:37:10] Hallelujah.
[1:37:12] After the tears, you go and believe that
[1:37:15] if you have money, you can pay for your
[1:37:19] sins. Oh God have mercy.
[1:37:24] You see, the devil is a shoot person. I
[1:37:27] was telling a brother, I said, "The
[1:37:28] devil is an old
[1:37:30] player. He knew he knows how to play the
[1:37:35] game." Until
[1:37:37] today, the devil has made people even to
[1:37:40] forget their own English.
[1:37:44] When the Bible say that thou shalt not
[1:37:47] bow down to any graven image,
[1:37:51] it's in every
[1:37:53] language. It's in English, it's in my
[1:37:56] language, it's in it's in uh uh uh what
[1:37:59] do we call any other language, German
[1:38:01] and
[1:38:02] anything that same
[1:38:05] word but Satan have made people to
[1:38:07] forget
[1:38:08] it and they bow down to grav images.
[1:38:12] Amen. Learned
[1:38:14] people learned people. People who knows
[1:38:19] something in
[1:38:21] society, they forget their own language.
[1:38:26] But we thank God for the Holy Spirit.
[1:38:29] Amen.
[1:38:33] Hallelujah. He said he is the only place
[1:38:36] that can give you safety and he is God's
[1:38:39] provided safety. Oh, we can provide this
[1:38:43] and provide that and it all fall.
[1:38:48] Uh-huh. Our bulletproof will fall.
[1:38:53] Hallelujah. Our bulletproof will fall.
[1:38:57] Amen. Our education will fall. Our
[1:39:00] poverty will fall. Everything will fall.
[1:39:04] But the only thing that is standing is
[1:39:05] that Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:39:09] Oh my. He said, "But when God provides
[1:39:13] anything, it is eternal and that is
[1:39:16] God's provided way for our safety in
[1:39:19] Christ." The prophet said, "I love it."
[1:39:22] Amen. And I also love it. And I think
[1:39:25] you also love it, my sister. Hallelujah.
[1:39:30] Amen.
[1:39:32] Oh, brother. There's nothing like Jesus
[1:39:34] Christ in your life.
[1:39:37] That's why the prophet said we should
[1:39:39] pity them.
[1:39:41] We should not condemn them, but we
[1:39:42] should pity them because they need to
[1:39:45] know the
[1:39:46] joy that is in the Lord.
[1:39:54] He said when you are in
[1:39:57] him, when trouble come like
[1:40:01] sickness or worry
[1:40:04] disappear, he bore our sorrows with his
[1:40:08] stripes. We were healed. Everything that
[1:40:12] we have need of for the rest of the
[1:40:14] journey is right here in the refuge.
[1:40:17] Amen.
[1:40:20] How do we get in this refuge? By one
[1:40:23] spirit. We are all baptized into this
[1:40:26] refuge. by one spirit which is the
[1:40:30] spirit of Jesus Christ. We are all
[1:40:33] all believers in America, all believers
[1:40:36] in Europe, all believers in Africa, all
[1:40:38] believers in Asia.
[1:40:41] We are
[1:40:42] all baptized into that refuge.
[1:40:50] Amen. He said, "How do we get in this
[1:40:55] refuge?" By one spirit. We are baptized
[1:40:58] into this refuge and we become a member
[1:41:02] of this refuge.
[1:41:04] We are a citizen of this kingdom with
[1:41:07] our great provider with us that provides
[1:41:11] all we have need
[1:41:12] of. Just trust his word. And we while we
[1:41:17] are in here, we are in his presence.
[1:41:20] Amen. I like
[1:41:23] that we are in his presence.
[1:41:26] Whatever brethren have gathered also in
[1:41:28] the name of Jesus Christ, he is also
[1:41:30] with
[1:41:32] them. He said
[1:41:34] now but you are
[1:41:36] tried put to the test to be proven.
[1:41:40] Amen.
[1:41:42] And Noah after the days of his preaching
[1:41:45] when he stood at the door of his ark and
[1:41:49] gave the very last call. Amen. And God
[1:41:52] told him, "I am through with them."
[1:41:55] Noah, get into the safety that have been
[1:41:59] provided. I think that's where we
[1:42:03] stand.
[1:42:05] Amen. I think that is where we stand.
[1:42:08] Noah entered into the ark after the last
[1:42:12] call and very soon there is going to be
[1:42:15] a last call. Amen.
[1:42:18] The prophet said that when the last
[1:42:19] bride member believed the message which
[1:42:22] is going to be the last call, he said
[1:42:23] the rapture has to take place.
[1:42:27] And we are eagerly waiting for that. I
[1:42:30] don't know where it's coming from. I'm
[1:42:32] always praying to the Lord. Lord,
[1:42:34] produce the last bride member because
[1:42:37] the Bible say that if you don't call the
[1:42:39] people, they cannot come. Produce. Maybe
[1:42:42] he's hiding somewhere in
[1:42:44] Fenton or Lynon.
[1:42:46] or perhaps Ghana.
[1:42:51] But whatever it takes, that last call
[1:42:56] will one day be announced.
[1:43:06] Amen. He said, I think that is where we
[1:43:10] stand. Get into that spot of safety
[1:43:14] zone.
[1:43:15] He said the traffic of sin is getting
[1:43:18] terrific,
[1:43:20] but God gives us a safety zone. Amen.
[1:43:25] Look on the street. You bear witness.
[1:43:29] Things that you don't see some time ago,
[1:43:33] you see all.
[1:43:35] And thing that you saw some time ago,
[1:43:38] you are seeing all on the streets.
[1:43:41] Everywhere is not only America,
[1:43:43] everywhere in the world. Any place that
[1:43:45] we go, we see everything the same.
[1:43:51] Praise the name of our God. By God's
[1:43:52] grace, wherever we are gone, we have
[1:43:54] been to in this mission work, we see the
[1:43:56] the same spirit, the same thing working
[1:43:58] all over upon the
[1:44:00] people. Hallelujah.
[1:44:03] Sometime you ask yourself, huh, what is
[1:44:05] going
[1:44:06] on? What is going on? You asking me or
[1:44:10] you asking God? H what is going on is
[1:44:13] what God have said that it will come.
[1:44:15] That's right. It's just
[1:44:18] manifesting until until sin that made
[1:44:22] God to destroy a nation. Yes. Today it
[1:44:25] been projected.
[1:44:27] It been supported. Oh God have mercy.
[1:44:30] Amen. The prophet said sin is like a
[1:44:33] traffic. It has
[1:44:35] jumped on a
[1:44:37] freeway. Nobody goes, nobody comes
[1:44:40] because of sin.
[1:44:43] Young boys and young girls living pro
[1:44:45] promiscuous life. No control. You can't
[1:44:49] control your child any longer. Oh God
[1:44:52] have mercy, brother. We must go back to
[1:44:54] the Bible.
[1:44:57] I don't want to listen to any
[1:44:59] constitution whatsoever. I want to
[1:45:00] listen to the Bible. The Bible is my
[1:45:02] constitution. He said, "Train up the
[1:45:04] child the way he should go and when they
[1:45:06] grow, they will not depart from it."
[1:45:08] That is my constitution.
[1:45:11] Oh, brother Daniel, be careful. I will
[1:45:13] not be careful. It is the word of God.
[1:45:19] So you be punished by I don't care who
[1:45:20] punish me.
[1:45:23] Hallelujah. If Jesus is standing by me,
[1:45:26] who is the enemy? He said they will fall
[1:45:29] at your right side and they'll fall at
[1:45:31] your left side.
[1:45:33] Oh brother, I'm so happy this morning
[1:45:36] that we are in the safety zone.
[1:45:42] Sometimes I see some of the people on
[1:45:44] the
[1:45:46] street.
[1:45:51] Hallelujah. Brother
[1:45:53] Bruce, it's
[1:45:55] serious that especially this young
[1:46:00] kids there are they pierce their nose
[1:46:03] and and and and so many rings.
[1:46:09] Oh, but I thought they say it's a mad
[1:46:12] cow that put they put a no ring in their
[1:46:16] nose to to temp them.
[1:46:19] Are they telling her that they are mad?
[1:46:24] Oh, God have mercy. Amen.
[1:46:27] The prophet said that sin is like a
[1:46:29] traffic jam on the streets even in his
[1:46:33] time. What can we say in this time?
[1:46:39] Hallelujah.
[1:46:41] Amen. Who is in
[1:46:44] control? Sin is controlling the people
[1:46:48] today. But I thank God for your life and
[1:46:51] I thank God for my life.
[1:46:54] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:58] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:47:01] Notice the king that
[1:47:04] knew the notice the king that new king
[1:47:07] that raised up that didn't know
[1:47:10] Joseph what was his first scheme to
[1:47:14] destroy the power of
[1:47:16] Israel with
[1:47:18] his was their children. That's right. He
[1:47:22] tried to destroy their children. Now
[1:47:25] listen close. The same devil in a
[1:47:28] different form of a kingship tried to
[1:47:32] destroy God's only
[1:47:33] son get rid of the children first before
[1:47:37] they get start. The devil is a real
[1:47:41] smart
[1:47:43] shed. He knows how to hit the thing
[1:47:46] before it gets
[1:47:48] started. He knows
[1:47:50] it. And the only thing that can that you
[1:47:54] can ever do to beat him is is to rely on
[1:47:59] Christ
[1:48:01] and humble yourself and let him lead
[1:48:05] you.
[1:48:07] You don't lead Christ, but let Christ
[1:48:10] lead you. You don't lead the word. Let
[1:48:13] the word lead you.
[1:48:16] You see, you will never do it any other
[1:48:19] way.
[1:48:20] You will never do it any other way.
[1:48:23] There is no other
[1:48:25] way. Hallelujah. But the way of Jesus
[1:48:28] Christ.
[1:48:30] Trust and
[1:48:32] obey. For there is no other way to be
[1:48:36] happy in Jesus. But to trust and obey
[1:48:40] him. That is the only way. That is the
[1:48:43] only salvation. That is the only safety
[1:48:45] zone. Trust in Jesus.
[1:48:50] And who Jesus today? The word
[1:48:54] revealed.
[1:48:58] Your intellectual powers will never do
[1:49:01] it.
[1:49:04] Your intellectual will never do it.
[1:49:08] You've got to believe it. Just rely on
[1:49:11] him.
[1:49:14] You see the reason I used to put it this
[1:49:17] way that the revealed word is that some
[1:49:20] also claim they have the word.
[1:49:25] But but what type of word?
[1:49:28] We have the word and we have the
[1:49:30] revealed word.
[1:49:34] H he said your intellectual powers would
[1:49:37] never do it. You've got to believe it.
[1:49:40] Just rely on him. He is the
[1:49:43] shepherd. Huh? He is the shepherd, bro.
[1:49:48] He is my shepherd and he is your
[1:49:51] shepherd. He said it a sheep's business
[1:49:54] to keep the wolf away.
[1:49:56] It is the shepherd's business.
[1:50:01] I am only a
[1:50:03] sheep. I am following my
[1:50:06] shepherd. Where he leads me, there I go.
[1:50:09] Amen. If there is any danger on the way,
[1:50:13] it is not my business. It's the business
[1:50:15] of the shepherd to make sure he clears
[1:50:17] the way.
[1:50:21] The only thing I have to do is to keep
[1:50:23] following him.
[1:50:26] He said, "Well, my sheep, you have to
[1:50:28] feed here. I have no option. I have to
[1:50:31] listen to him and feed there." He said,
[1:50:34] "Okay, it's enough. Let's go back home.
[1:50:36] What do I do? I keep quiet and follow
[1:50:38] him. Another day he said let us go to
[1:50:41] grace. I follow him. I mean where he
[1:50:43] leads there I go.
[1:50:48] Hallelujah. It's not your duty at all to
[1:50:52] fight here and there. Lift the fight for
[1:50:54] Jesus Christ. Only rely your faith on
[1:50:58] him. Amen.
[1:51:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:05] But the sheep must stay with the
[1:51:06] shepherd in order to stay
[1:51:09] safe. That is my safety zone is Christ.
[1:51:15] And Christ is the word. That is the
[1:51:18] safety
[1:51:20] zone. Let me see the
[1:51:25] time.
[1:51:28] Amen.
[1:51:30] Believe for safety.
[1:51:34] Then
[1:51:37] apply belief for safety then apply. This
[1:51:41] is the two condition I'm giving to you
[1:51:43] before I close. Believe for safety then
[1:51:49] apply. Here is what you want to believe
[1:51:53] for. See you want your own safety.
[1:51:58] You believe for your safety and then
[1:52:01] apply the token for the whole
[1:52:05] family. You say how can I do
[1:52:08] that? Claim
[1:52:13] it. If it work on you then you and the
[1:52:18] word becomes
[1:52:20] one. Amen.
[1:52:22] Amen. You see it works for both of you.
[1:52:27] You and the word are one. Then apply it
[1:52:31] to your
[1:52:33] children. Apply it to your loved ones.
[1:52:37] You know why he was saying that? He said
[1:52:39] like Rahab did. She applied the token to
[1:52:42] her father. She applied it to her
[1:52:44] mother. She applied it to her brothers
[1:52:46] and sisters and got them all in.
[1:52:52] So let us apply it to all our folks, our
[1:52:56] our father, our mothers, our children,
[1:52:59] our brothers and our sisters.
[1:53:01] Oh, they are stubborn. I've spoken to
[1:53:03] them and they for so many years. Oh, you
[1:53:06] just continue to claim them and pray for
[1:53:08] them. One
[1:53:11] day when they get to the junction that
[1:53:14] God have provided, they will not cross
[1:53:17] but God will pick them. God will bring
[1:53:20] them in. Hallelujah. Just proclaim, just
[1:53:24] claim and just pray. Continue to pray.
[1:53:26] Just love them and God will take care of
[1:53:28] the rest.
[1:53:30] Don't be discouraged that they are not
[1:53:33] in for now. That is not your business.
[1:53:36] Your business is to continue to believe
[1:53:38] for them that one day God will bring
[1:53:40] them in. They prophesy claim them and we
[1:53:44] are claiming them. Oh my goodness. We
[1:53:46] are claiming them and will continue to
[1:53:47] claim them.
[1:53:50] You apply it. You say, "Lord, I am going
[1:53:53] after my son. I'm going after my
[1:53:56] daughter. I claim her." Satan, you turn
[1:54:00] her loose. I am coming after her. I
[1:54:02] apply my token, the Holy Spirit.
[1:54:05] Oh, Holy Spirit that lives within me,
[1:54:08] catch my daughter there,
[1:54:11] catch my son there, catch my father
[1:54:14] there, catch my mother there, and catch
[1:54:17] all my siblings also there.
[1:54:23] and bring them under the safety zone,
[1:54:28] the shadow of the Almighty
[1:54:31] with your anointing upon me.
[1:54:35] And the prophet said he will do it.
[1:54:40] Amen.
[1:54:42] He will do it. Brother, sister, God will
[1:54:44] never fail you.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah. Praise God. God will never
[1:54:51] fail you. Amen. He has never failed
[1:54:53] before. Amen.
[1:54:57] We have a song say never fail me yet.
[1:55:00] Never fail me yet. Jesus Christ never
[1:55:05] fail me yet.
[1:55:07] Ah something something something
[1:55:09] something. I forgotten the song.
[1:55:13] Hallelujah. He will never fail. Amen. We
[1:55:17] have to stand by the word. Yes. If only
[1:55:20] we know and
[1:55:22] we can
[1:55:24] believe that he is our
[1:55:28] safety. Don't worry about United States
[1:55:32] Pope. Don't worry about the crumbling of
[1:55:35] America. Don't worry about h e h uh the
[1:55:38] invasion of Russia and all that. Don't
[1:55:41] worry about that. Hallelujah. Don't
[1:55:44] worry. But just look up for your
[1:55:47] redemption drawth nigh. He said people's
[1:55:49] heart are failing for
[1:55:52] fear. But look
[1:55:54] up. Look up for your redemption draw
[1:55:58] nigh.
[1:56:00] Be
[1:56:01] sure. Be sure that you are in that
[1:56:04] safety zone. That is all that God is
[1:56:07] requiring from you. Right.
[1:56:10] Be
[1:56:12] sure one time when uh when
[1:56:16] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:56:18] erected the
[1:56:20] image and instructed that the whole
[1:56:23] province, the whole kingdom, everybody
[1:56:24] must bow down to the
[1:56:26] image. They did it. But the three Hebrew
[1:56:30] children, the Bible said they didn't bow
[1:56:33] because they knew their God. Amen. They
[1:56:37] knew the God that they believed in him
[1:56:42] and they told to the face of King
[1:56:44] Nebuchadnezzar he said king we are not
[1:56:47] going to bow down to your graven image.
[1:56:50] It is not that we don't respect you king
[1:56:52] we respect you but we will not break our
[1:56:57] commandment.
[1:56:59] Our first commandment say we should not
[1:57:01] bow down to any graven image. We should
[1:57:04] not worship
[1:57:05] them. We are not going to bow
[1:57:08] down. Then King said, well, there is
[1:57:12] only one condition for any
[1:57:14] disobedience in this area. If you refuse
[1:57:18] to bow down, we are going to burn you
[1:57:21] anyhow in a ferifas. It's a
[1:57:25] law. They said, king, we are not careful
[1:57:27] to answer you. But the God that we
[1:57:30] worship, our God will save us from your
[1:57:34] hand. But let us even tell you, even if
[1:57:38] he refused to come and save us, our law
[1:57:42] say we should not bow down to any graven
[1:57:45] image. So we are not going to bow down.
[1:57:48] Wow. I see your stubbornness
[1:57:52] now. You think you're stubborn, but I'll
[1:57:55] prove you wrong in the furry furnace.
[1:57:58] He said,
[1:57:59] "Soldiers, no set the
[1:58:02] oven." And the Bible said that they
[1:58:05] heated the oven seven
[1:58:09] times. They didn't have any revelation
[1:58:11] because the normal seven is always God.
[1:58:15] So when they heated the oven seventh
[1:58:17] one, then God dropped into the very
[1:58:19] furnace.
[1:58:21] Hallelujah. He took his seat and he was
[1:58:24] waiting to see what what was going to go
[1:58:26] on.
[1:58:28] Then they bound this brothers their foot
[1:58:31] and their hands and the soldiers threw
[1:58:34] them into the furry furnace. The Bible
[1:58:36] says that the flame that came out passed
[1:58:40] on the soldiers and it killed them. But
[1:58:43] the three Hebrew
[1:58:45] children, they were singing and they
[1:58:48] were dancing in the fairy furnace. They
[1:58:51] were singing and they were dancing. They
[1:58:52] were rejoicing. They were praising God.
[1:58:55] Amen. Hallelujah. because they found
[1:58:57] their safety in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:59:02] People were taken back say what what is
[1:59:05] going
[1:59:06] on? We've been we've been doing this
[1:59:09] thing all along but what is going on?
[1:59:12] The people are not dead and they are
[1:59:14] rather singing and dancing in the fire.
[1:59:17] My let's go and fetch the king. They
[1:59:19] went and called the king. King
[1:59:21] Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:59:24] king, something extraordinary is
[1:59:26] happening
[1:59:27] today. Please, the men that you
[1:59:31] commanded us to throw into the furry
[1:59:33] furnace, they are not
[1:59:35] dead. They are having a revival in the
[1:59:37] fire.
[1:59:39] They are singing their old songs and
[1:59:40] they are dancing and they are jumping.
[1:59:44] What is that? So, he said, "Yes, sir.
[1:59:46] again and it pulled him from his throne
[1:59:49] and he went to the ferry
[1:59:51] furnace and bowed himself and looked
[1:59:54] through the
[1:59:55] fire. He said, "Men and brethren, how
[1:59:59] many men did we throw into the
[2:00:01] fire?" They said, "Three men." He said,
[2:00:05] "But I see a fourth man and he's like
[2:00:08] the son of God."
[2:00:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So God himself
[2:00:16] descended to wait for these believers in
[2:00:20] the fire and he turned himself as a song
[2:00:23] leader and he was leading a song and
[2:00:25] they were having service and worship in
[2:00:27] the furry furnace. Amen. Amen. Wherever
[2:00:30] he calls me I will go.
[2:00:35] Amen.
[2:00:37] Nebuchadnezzar didn't have any
[2:00:40] option. And he said, "Shadrach, Mezak,
[2:00:43] and Abednego, the servant of the most
[2:00:46] high God, come out."
[2:00:49] And they came out from the fire. The
[2:00:51] Bible said that not even a hair on their
[2:00:54] skin got bent. Amen.
[2:00:57] The atmosphere,
[2:01:00] the power of God descended from heaven,
[2:01:03] entered into the very furnace and
[2:01:05] changed the condition. Amen.
[2:01:08] Not even a smoke on their body. Not even
[2:01:11] their shed got bent.
[2:01:15] And the
[2:01:16] book had no option as to put this man at
[2:01:20] a strategic point because he knew that
[2:01:24] they were indeed worshiping a true
[2:01:29] God. Brother, I'm closing with
[2:01:32] this. Let us remain
[2:01:35] focused. We shouldn't allow anything to
[2:01:37] scare us.
[2:01:39] So long as our Christian journey is
[2:01:41] concerned, brother, many things will
[2:01:43] rise on our way. We don't know how many
[2:01:47] temptations that are ahead of us. We
[2:01:49] don't know how many, you know,
[2:01:51] frustrations that are ahead of us. We
[2:01:53] don't know how many joy that are ahead
[2:01:54] of us. But in all the situation and
[2:01:56] condition, let us remain focused and let
[2:01:59] us be like Shadrach, Mesach and Abednego
[2:02:02] when they knew the God that they were
[2:02:04] worshiping and they were serving that
[2:02:06] there is nowhere safe but only in him.
[2:02:11] Amen. And today there is nowhere safe
[2:02:15] only in the message of this hour
[2:02:19] which is Jesus Christ revealed.
[2:02:23] Let us hold on to it. Amen. Let us make
[2:02:26] sure that our position is not taken from
[2:02:28] us. And let us press forward. Amen. Paul
[2:02:32] said, I forget the things of old.
[2:02:35] I cast them as dunk, but now I'm
[2:02:38] pressing on to the price of the high
[2:02:41] callings of God. Let that be our concern
[2:02:44] and let that be our faith. God bless all
[2:02:47] of us. Hallelujah.
[2:02:51] Amen.
[2:02:55] Let's bow our heads for a word of
[2:02:57] prayer. Father, we thank you Lord. We
[2:03:00] bless your name. We give you glory and
[2:03:04] adoration.
[2:03:05] Indeed, the happenings of this
[2:03:09] world,
[2:03:12] circumstances and
[2:03:14] all, Father is clearly showing to us
[2:03:20] that you are always with us.
[2:03:23] We thank
[2:03:24] you for the provided
[2:03:27] word which have given us power and
[2:03:31] assurance which has given us security
[2:03:35] that indeed we are in a safety
[2:03:38] zone. Lord may that thing never be taken
[2:03:41] from
[2:03:42] us by any happiness by any
[2:03:46] circumstance
[2:03:48] whatsoever. Help us to remain
[2:03:51] focused and believe on your
[2:03:54] word, accept your word and live under
[2:03:58] that
[2:04:00] protection. Father, we don't
[2:04:03] know whenever it's going to
[2:04:06] happen. But any day, any
[2:04:10] time as the prophet prayed, we praise
[2:04:14] him this morning. May there never be any
[2:04:17] feeble person amongst us.
[2:04:20] Strengthen us Lord. If our faith is
[2:04:22] weak, Lord, lift us
[2:04:24] up. Help us, oh God, to condemn any sin
[2:04:28] that is around us. May we squeeze it out
[2:04:32] from
[2:04:33] ours and let us walk in thy
[2:04:37] word. I thank you for the church. I
[2:04:41] thank you for my good brother, Pastor
[2:04:44] John, his family, and the entire church.
[2:04:47] Lord, Father, any other
[2:04:50] thing that you have in your hand to give
[2:04:53] to them, Father, I pray as your servant,
[2:04:57] grant it and let their joy be made full
[2:05:00] in thee. Bless them, oh God, for their
[2:05:02] support of the missions
[2:05:04] also. Lord, give them what it takes to
[2:05:07] continue to do thy work. Help us to
[2:05:10] prepare ourselves, oh Lord, at all
[2:05:12] times.
[2:05:14] May we never live in complacency, Father
[2:05:17] as we see prophecies of this message
[2:05:21] fulfilling. Help us, help us again,
[2:05:24] Lord, that we may remain faithful on
[2:05:26] today. We thank you and we bless you in
[2:05:30] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:05:34] Bless you, brother John.
[2:05:43] saying, "He is here." Amen. How many
[2:05:46] appreciate that message?
[2:05:48] Amen. Our safety is here.
[2:05:53] He's a present help in a time of
[2:05:55] trouble.
[2:06:03] He is
[2:06:05] here.
[2:06:08] Hallelujah. He is
[2:06:11] here.
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:14] Amen. He is
[2:06:16] here. Holy,
[2:06:19] holy. I will bless his name again.
[2:06:26] He is here. Listen
[2:06:31] closely. Hear him calling out your name.
[2:06:37] He is here. You can touch him and you'll
[2:06:44] never be the
[2:06:50] same. He is
[2:06:52] here. Hope.
[2:06:55] Halleluah. He is here.
[2:07:00] A He is here. Holy, holy. I will bless
[2:07:09] his
[2:07:10] name. And he is here listening closely.
[2:07:18] Hear him calling out your name.
[2:07:23] He is here. You can touch him and you'll
[2:07:30] never be the
[2:07:34] same. Amen. He's calling out our name to
[2:07:39] come to his name. blessing his
