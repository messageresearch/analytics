[20:37] anticipation on their part of our coming

[20:47] great thing that is to know
[20:50] that uh you know somebody's
[20:54] looking out for you and just praying for

[20:57] amen so we just pray that
[21:01] through this holidays that we can just
[21:03] draw close closer to christ that
[21:06] we can express to others was bottled up
[21:10] inside of
[21:11] us that you know they don't know christ
[21:15] and especially in the era we're living
[21:18] with this confusion and everything
[21:20] you know there's definitely needs you
[21:22] know i i see a lot more
[21:24] it seems like this year we me and my
[21:25] wife are just talking seems like we got
[21:27] a lot more
[21:28] you see a lot more christmas lights up
[21:30] and you know people want to
[21:32] express you know so
[21:36] let us express christ to them this
[21:38] morning amen
[21:39] just remember just tides and offerings
[21:42] and
[21:42] all the missions throughout the world
[21:44] amen brother john
[21:46] and the uh the other church amen as it
[21:49] moves forward and
[21:50] brother stan and just working at it and
[21:54] all that
[21:55] and our anybody else that's that's sick
[21:57] here you know
[21:58] like keep lifting up our sister cheryl
[22:00] and anybody else that has a
[22:02] affliction amen um
[22:06] so if there's any other needs let's just
[22:09] remain seated amen i i know probably
[22:14] i know it's good to see our brother ron
[22:16] and i think he had
[22:17] some things that he wanted to express to
[22:19] the church is that right brother
[22:21] did you want to do that now okay
[22:24] you want to come up here okay
[22:42] greetings brothers and sisters
[22:46] i just wanted to take a few minutes
[22:48] because
[22:49] i've been a little sporadic as far as my
[22:53] attendance and the things that i like to
[22:55] do
[22:56] i haven't been able to do and i just
[22:59] want you to know that whether i'm here
[23:01] or whether i'm gone you're still in my
[23:04] hearts
[23:06] you're in my prayers
[23:12] i pray for each one of you daily
[23:19] it's hard for me to express myself
[23:21] because i'm a pretty quiet person
[23:24] but i want you to know that i love every
[23:26] one of us
[23:32] and i know that you love me and it helps
[23:36] me to know when i can't be here
[23:39] that you're still praying for me
[23:43] i just wanted to just want to take a few
[23:46] minutes here
[23:48] and like i say i'm not very good at this
[23:50] i just don't do this very much
[23:52] but i have a little something i want to
[23:56] share with you that
[23:57] that has helped me out many times and
[24:00] we're in a time that prayer is so
[24:03] important
[24:05] and if we don't pray we're not going to
[24:07] get anything done
[24:12] and so if i can get through this forgive
[24:14] me
[24:17] it says prayer is not only a calling
[24:19] upon god
[24:20] but also a conflict with satan
[24:24] delayed answers to prayer are not only
[24:27] trials of faith
[24:30] but they give us opportunities of
[24:32] honoring god
[24:34] do not pray for the easy lives pray to
[24:38] be stronger men
[24:40] do not pray for tasks equal to your
[24:43] powers
[24:45] pray for powers equal to your tasks
[24:50] groanings which cannot be uttered are
[24:52] often prayers which cannot be
[24:54] refused we pray for patience
[24:59] and god sends us those who tax us
[25:02] to the utmost we pray for submission
[25:06] and god sends us suffering we pray for
[25:09] quietness
[25:10] and every nerve is strong to the utmost
[25:13] tension we pray for love and god sends
[25:17] peculiar sufferings and puts us
[25:20] apparently with
[25:22] unloving people
[25:25] the way to peace in victory is to accept
[25:29] every circumstance
[25:30] every trial straight from the hand of a
[25:34] loving god
[25:36] i just want to thank god for his
[25:39] presence in my life
[25:42] for what he's done for me and
[25:45] through quietness whether i'm here or
[25:46] whether i'm gone
[25:48] i want you to know that i love every one
[25:49] of you
[25:51] thank you so much
[26:02] hey man i just uh
[26:09] you know it's scripturally speaking it
[26:11] says that man ought to always be praying
[26:13] without seasoning
[26:16] if you have a you know a quiet
[26:19] time in your mind pray you know because
[26:24] it keeps your mind stated in the lord
[26:26] so as our brother said you know we don't
[26:30] understand our trials
[26:32] but you know he comes to us and he says
[26:35] that count them
[26:36] more blessed than you know gold and
[26:38] silver
[26:42] i think um you know
[26:45] he says you know we look in the
[26:47] scripture that says every man's right in
[26:49] his own eyes
[26:50] right but we need the minds of christ we
[26:54] need the
[26:55] eyes of christ right not to look at our
[26:58] trials as being something that
[27:00] we can't carry because
[27:04] he told us we could we just need to have
[27:07] more faith like our brothers said
[27:09] to be able to see beyond everything else
[27:13] especially in the day we're living amen
[27:16] so let's just stand we'll go
[27:18] brother mike can you just take these
[27:20] needs before the church
[27:46] already

[28:01] the lives getting closer with all the

[35:58] turn in our bibles to the book of luke

[36:10] it is simply
[36:14] amazing how
[36:17] god is in control
[36:21] and we are totally clueless of what he's
[36:24] doing
[36:30] and god does not need to tell us what he
[36:32] is doing
[36:35] but it is vitally important that we
[36:37] catch the message
[36:38] of what he speaks to us directly
[36:41] because that's the part that we have to
[36:43] play
[36:45] amen luke chapter 18 starting with verse
[36:48] number one
[36:50] and he spake a parable unto this end
[36:53] that men ought always to pray
[36:56] and not faint saying there wasn't a city
[37:00] a judge
[37:01] which feared not god neither regarded
[37:03] man and there was a widow
[37:05] in that city and she came unto him
[37:09] saying avenge me my adversary and we
[37:11] would
[37:12] and he would not for a while but
[37:14] afterwards he said within himself though
[37:16] i
[37:17] fear not god nor regard man yet because
[37:20] this widow troubles me i
[37:22] will avenge her lest by her continual
[37:24] coming
[37:25] she weary me the lord said
[37:29] hear what the unjust judge saith
[37:32] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[37:34] which
[37:35] cry day and night unto him though he
[37:38] bear long
[37:38] with them i say unto you that
[37:42] i tell you that he will avenge them
[37:45] speedily
[37:47] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[37:49] shall he find
[37:50] faith on the earth amen god bless you
[37:53] may be seated
[37:59] last service
[38:02] we're learning um
[38:08] how to live a crucified life and
[38:11] learning to live a crucified life is
[38:13] just learning how to surrender your life
[38:16] learning how to
[38:17] completely live a surrendered life to
[38:19] the lord
[38:21] i believe it was john said i must
[38:23] decrease so he can
[38:24] increase i believe paul said
[38:28] when i'm weak then i'm strong
[38:31] and jesus said my grace is sufficient
[38:33] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[38:36] in weakness and so we can see that it's
[38:39] through
[38:39] us becoming very very nothing
[38:43] that he can become very very everything
[38:45] amen
[38:47] we don't want to view perfect weaknesses
[38:49] a feeling of being all beat up and
[38:50] discouraged
[38:52] we want to view perfect weakness as
[38:54] completely dependent
[38:55] upon god completely surrendered to god
[38:58] that we may
[38:58] gain all that god has
[39:02] the more that we learn to live a
[39:03] crucified life
[39:05] or a surrender life the more that god
[39:07] can have his way in our life
[39:10] and that surrendered life will never
[39:12] ever be gifted to us and this is
[39:14] important
[39:15] it'll never be gifted to us just because
[39:17] we're bride
[39:19] we will have to fight to lay down our
[39:21] lives
[39:23] and learn the habit of surrendering it
[39:26] daily to god
[39:29] this morning we want to talk a bit about
[39:31] prayer
[39:33] and choosing to thrive in god's economy
[39:35] through prayer
[39:36] i like to entitle this message a
[39:38] symphony of prayer
[39:42] brother ron husker
[39:46] made mention this morning if you don't
[39:49] pray
[39:50] if we don't pray we're not going to get
[39:52] anything
[39:54] done and uh
[39:58] i believe he was in sync with the holy
[39:59] ghost and perhaps didn't even know it
[40:03] and maybe he did know it
[40:08] d.l moody said every great move of god
[40:10] can be traced back
[40:12] to a kneeling figure
[40:15] prayer is extremely important
[40:19] here in our opening scripture jesus
[40:20] brings up the power of prayer in the end
[40:23] time
[40:25] whether there would be faith enough to
[40:26] execute god's will or not
[40:29] in some way it seems like the whole
[40:31] world is crying out for help
[40:35] most of the crying is without faith and
[40:39] we have to have faith mixed with our
[40:40] prayers
[40:42] or it's not going to it's not going to
[40:44] benefit us and i'm going to say it like
[40:45] this
[40:46] we're going to spiritually faint
[40:50] faint from being in the position
[40:53] of a christian that's thriving
[40:56] in god's economy
[41:00] we're all feeling stuck in some way
[41:03] some are stuck in in a quarantine
[41:06] many are not here with us today
[41:10] some are stuck in fear
[41:13] some are stuck inside of a community
[41:17] that's locked down
[41:20] can't go to the bank unless you have an
[41:22] appointment now
[41:24] waiting periods are much longer for all
[41:26] of our appointments
[41:27] try to make appointment it's it's
[41:30] sometimes months out
[41:34] things are becoming more virtual stay
[41:37] put stay at home
[41:39] if we're not allowed to go to the
[41:40] restaurants then
[41:42] we're feeling too cautious and afraid to
[41:44] go anyways
[41:47] we can't be with our friends and family
[41:48] like the way we want to
[41:52] you just can't get in your car and go
[41:53] somewhere without being inhibited
[41:55] some way in our minds
[41:59] it's a feeling stuck
[42:02] and this feeling stuck is it's
[42:04] problematic
[42:05] it causes people to go insane people are
[42:08] fighting depression and a whole host of
[42:10] problems
[42:11] just because of the feeling of stuck
[42:15] this stuckness feeling has affected the
[42:18] church body
[42:19] as well they're fighting the same
[42:22] spirits of depression
[42:24] and hopelessness it's a reality
[42:30] we can't be with one another the way
[42:32] that we like to and feel totally
[42:34] comfortable
[42:36] we just can't go up to one another and
[42:38] shake one another's hand and hug
[42:40] one another without some thought going
[42:41] through our head we may feel okay with
[42:43] it but then we're wondering how the
[42:45] other person is going to be feeling
[42:46] about it
[42:53] we feel less liberty to just go up to
[42:56] people and talk to people about jesus
[42:59] because
[43:00] we're wondering about social distancing
[43:06] reaching out for souls has been quite
[43:08] hindered
[43:10] helping one another in the body has been
[43:12] dampered and believers are becoming more
[43:14] inclusive
[43:18] it's really opened the door wide for
[43:20] being stuck in laodicea
[43:25] and if you're stuck with yourself it's a
[43:27] lot easier to fall more in love
[43:29] with yourself
[43:32] but we don't have to choose to accept
[43:34] this feeling of hopelessness
[43:36] and stuckness because god
[43:39] hasn't changed his plans haven't changed
[43:43] his purpose hasn't changed
[43:46] his power hasn't changed for our god is
[43:48] still the same
[43:49] yesterday today and forever
[43:52] we can choose to live in god's economy
[43:56] we're not
[43:56] stuck in this world
[44:00] jesus said we're in this world but we're
[44:02] not of this world
[44:03] we're from another kingdom we're we're
[44:05] born in a different community
[44:08] he prayed in saint john chapter 17 verse
[44:11] 15
[44:11] i pray not that thou should have take
[44:14] them out of the world
[44:15] that thou thou should has keep them from
[44:18] the
[44:19] evil so it's okay for us to be here in
[44:23] this situation
[44:27] god's prayer is to be kept from it
[44:31] amen hallelujah from the evil that's in
[44:35] the world that's where god is
[44:37] is his mind and his prayer for us was
[44:40] that
[44:40] we would be cut from it and i'll say we
[44:43] need to
[44:44] agree with that amen we need to have the
[44:46] mindset of that
[44:49] now we can choose to live in god's
[44:51] economy
[44:53] god's a community safe from evil
[44:56] safe from being stuck in the mindset of
[44:59] i i can't do anything anyway so why
[45:01] should i try
[45:02] come on it's a real situation
[45:07] we can not only choose to live in god's
[45:09] economy but we can choose to thrive
[45:12] in god's economy right in the middle of
[45:14] what's
[45:15] this pandemic
[45:18] it is full of life there's nothing shut
[45:21] down in god's
[45:22] economy there's nothing hindered
[45:24] everything is
[45:25] open there's still joy in the camp amen
[45:28] there's still peace in the valley
[45:30] there's still an eternal love amen god
[45:32] is still answering prayer
[45:35] he may not change the world's ideas but
[45:38] he's still answering prayer
[45:41] god's economy is open for business
[45:44] friends
[45:45] and it's thriving prayer is our
[45:49] communication with god
[45:51] it's truly our fellowship with the lord
[45:55] and the more you communicate with god
[45:57] the closer
[45:58] we get to god
[46:01] your communication with god through
[46:04] prayer
[46:04] is what helps move the economy of god
[46:10] god is we like to think that god is
[46:13] is is going to do something no matter
[46:15] what so there's no
[46:16] no need to pray and that is just a lie
[46:18] from the devil
[46:22] as you communicate to god through prayer
[46:24] the words of your heart being expressed
[46:26] to god through prayer
[46:27] something begins to transpire inside of
[46:30] you
[46:31] and god uses that faith
[46:35] amen to to perform what it is that the
[46:39] need is now sometimes it's in your life
[46:41] and sometimes it's in the life of others
[46:45] god communicates to you
[46:49] to the word you communicate to
[46:52] god to prayer and god communicates
[46:56] to you through his word now that word
[46:59] that he communicates to you may be while
[47:02] you're praying
[47:04] and it may be while the word is being
[47:06] preached to you
[47:11] brother branham said we come to church
[47:13] to find out where we're standing where
[47:15] we're at with god
[47:17] he didn't say that's why we we pray to
[47:19] find out where we're at with god
[47:21] this is important because so often when
[47:25] we pray
[47:26] our own thoughts can be mixed our own
[47:29] ideas and
[47:30] if we don't get into the spirit then
[47:32] things can get mixed up
[47:35] so we don't get a clear precise decision
[47:38] but that word is a discerner of the
[47:40] thoughts and tense of the heart
[47:42] and that word can speak directly to us
[47:45] amen
[47:48] so god does speak in prayer
[47:52] but he also communicates to us through
[47:54] his word
[47:56] prayer is what really prepares us
[47:59] we may get in prayer to let our requests
[48:01] be made known to god because
[48:03] we have certain needs and that god wants
[48:05] us to pray about them and he wants us to
[48:08] to believe that god will meet them but
[48:10] remember oftentimes god ordains
[48:12] needs in our life for one purpose to get
[48:14] us to pray because we're not praying
[48:18] think about that god is more interested
[48:22] in you praying than your knees being met
[48:24] that's right he's more interested in you
[48:28] communicating with him
[48:30] than you getting your need met
[48:34] he wants the fellowship just because we
[48:36] come to church and we sit down
[48:38] it does not necessarily mean we're
[48:40] fellowshipping with god it just means
[48:42] we're in church
[48:45] you've got to enter into the spirit
[48:47] you've got to introduce to communion
[48:48] with him amen
[48:51] sometimes our prayers can become selfish
[48:56] and it behooves us to step back and and
[48:58] take a look at our prayer life
[49:00] and ask yourself the question if god
[49:03] were to answer all of our prayers would
[49:05] it change the world or just ours
[49:09] would it help us naturally or
[49:10] spiritually
[49:12] would it conform to what we want or
[49:15] would it transform
[49:16] us into the character that god wants
[49:20] oftentimes god uses our needs to get us
[49:23] to pray
[49:25] and then god uses our prayers to prepare
[49:27] us for his word
[49:30] his word is this communication it's a
[49:32] it's a still small voice
[49:34] it may be through prayer but it also may
[49:36] be through the preaching of the word
[49:39] that's why we must be anticipating god
[49:42] speaking to us directly when we
[49:44] come to church
[49:49] why didn't god just speak his voice to
[49:51] everyone
[49:54] why does god choose the foolishness of
[49:57] preaching of his
[49:58] word to other sinners
[50:03] you know a preacher is just a sinner
[50:06] saved by grace but he's still a sinner
[50:10] he still falls every time there's not a
[50:12] there's not a man
[50:13] that does not fall
[50:17] if i could say it like this on a regular
[50:19] basis
[50:20] to the point to where we can look at any
[50:22] man and see fall
[50:24] on the planet
[50:27] the difference is are we going to look
[50:29] at that man through the blood of christ
[50:31] because that is exactly how god looks at
[50:33] us today
[50:34] he's not looking at us and saying well
[50:36] your faults and failures are just a
[50:38] little bit
[50:38] lower than everybody else's so you're in
[50:42] no it's the blood that makes the
[50:43] difference
[50:46] praise god for the blood he chose
[50:50] the foolishness of preaching to save men
[50:53] why didn't he just go to
[50:54] a bunch of sinners and speak to them
[50:56] without somebody
[50:58] going to them think about this
[51:02] because it's the network of god that
[51:04] he's chosen to use the body to save the
[51:07] body
[51:09] and he uses prayer to help the body amen
[51:13] prayer is vital amen
[51:18] god used his prayer to prepare us to get
[51:20] us in sync
[51:21] with him and to get us in harmony with
[51:24] him
[51:26] without prayer we won't go very far
[51:30] with god without continuous
[51:33] communication
[51:34] of prayer we will actually halt our
[51:37] relationship with god
[51:40] we'll limit it it's no different with
[51:43] our
[51:44] our natural relationships i got some
[51:46] facts off the internet last night it is
[51:50] little surprise that the lack of
[51:52] communication in marriage
[51:54] leads to divorce or separation in many
[51:57] incidences
[51:59] in a study conducted last year
[52:02] communication
[52:03] problems were the most common factor
[52:05] that led to divorce at 65
[52:09] communication this was followed by
[52:13] couples inability to resolve
[52:14] issues at 43 percent
[52:18] the majority of arguments happen because
[52:21] of communication
[52:23] breakdown now i want you i hope your
[52:26] your spiritual minds are on because this
[52:28] is exactly
[52:29] what happens between a believer and god
[52:31] when he gets out of prayer
[52:35] now notice a couple naturally they have
[52:38] desires
[52:42] but the way that they think about
[52:45] getting those needs met or
[52:48] or seen or worked with is
[52:51] so selfish that there's no time
[52:55] to really enter in a right spirit to
[52:58] deal with them
[52:59] so what happens if we don't get what we
[53:02] want when we say it then there's a
[53:03] problem
[53:05] that's how believers get i don't got
[53:08] time to wait on the lord
[53:10] this is what i want if that's it i'm
[53:12] just i'm going to do my own thing
[53:13] anyways
[53:19] the causes of communication breakdown in
[53:21] a marriage involve
[53:23] blaming nagging complaining
[53:26] was a complaint of seventy percent
[53:29] followed by the lack of sufficient
[53:32] appreciation
[53:33] from their spouse at 65 percent
[53:37] this is the reason i think we should
[53:39] worship god more
[53:42] we need to appreciate him more
[53:46] we you cannot show god how much
[53:50] he's worthy of your praise
[53:54] sometimes we just we murmur and complain
[53:57] about how hard life is
[53:59] i'm telling you this uh this this
[54:02] breakdown is going to help hurt our
[54:03] relationship
[54:05] with the lord this communication
[54:08] breakdown the lack of validation for
[54:11] feelings
[54:12] and opinions were number one at 83
[54:16] percent followed by 56
[54:18] who said their spouses talk about
[54:20] themselves too much
[54:25] how does god feel when we come when we
[54:27] come to him and it's all about us
[54:32] what is our spouse thinking
[54:36] what about his will what about his
[54:39] desires
[54:40] what about what he would like to see
[54:42] happen
[54:45] our wires can often get crossed with god
[54:48] assuming certain things or certain
[54:49] desires
[54:51] outside of god's will and and and really
[54:54] not even recognize
[54:56] but just because we feel it we want it
[54:58] you know it's got to be god
[55:02] communicating with god through prayer is
[55:04] what helps us connect those lawyers
[55:07] it's what gets us back in harmony of god
[55:10] now of course
[55:11] you know the devil is telling us that
[55:14] everything's okay between
[55:15] us and god
[55:18] brother john how do you know that
[55:20] because it's the same exact
[55:22] thing he's telling all the denominations
[55:26] you're fine you're good what you believe
[55:29] where you're going to church where you
[55:31] stand you don't have to do anything more
[55:34] that is what he's telling laodicea and
[55:36] they're stuck
[55:38] having need of nothing because they're
[55:40] listening to that
[55:43] so of course he'd be saying that same
[55:44] thing to the denominator to the message
[55:47] believers
[55:51] our lack of communication with god
[55:53] through prayer will eventually
[55:55] cause us to get disconnected from god
[55:57] and
[55:58] and we may not even realize it we've
[56:00] heard the old
[56:01] story you go one day without prayer
[56:04] and your wife knows about it
[56:08] you go two days and your kids know about
[56:11] it
[56:12] you go three days without prayer and
[56:14] your dog knows about
[56:16] it because you get mad at the dog and
[56:19] you want to kick the dog
[56:23] prayer gets us away from being
[56:28] christ-like john chapter 15 verse 4
[56:32] jesus said abide in me
[56:35] and i in you as the branch cannot bear
[56:38] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[56:40] vine and no more can ye except you abide
[56:43] in me
[56:44] i am the vine ye are the branches he
[56:47] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[56:49] bringing forth much fruit
[56:50] for without me you can do
[56:54] nothing we need to pray to stay
[56:57] connected with god
[57:00] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[57:03] forth as a branch and withered
[57:08] and men gather them and cast them into
[57:10] the fire and they are burned
[57:13] we must stay connected with god amen
[57:16] we've got to stay in continuous prayer
[57:18] with the lord
[57:21] it's not only our spiritual lifeline
[57:26] but it's our spiritual lifeline to the
[57:28] entire body
[57:31] it's not just about us we're a part of
[57:34] the body
[57:36] and the body is a part of us and there's
[57:39] no big
[57:39] eyes or little hues and we can't make it
[57:42] without one another
[57:44] 99.9 of the body could be ready for the
[57:47] rapture but if that one
[57:49] little part is not ready the rapture is
[57:51] not happening god is not
[57:53] god is not leaving anybody behind
[57:57] so we need one another
[58:02] god not only uses our prayers to prepare
[58:04] us for his word but he uses them to help
[58:06] the rest of the body
[58:08] he'll lay burdens on your heart one for
[58:11] another
[58:12] a god that truly lives for other he also
[58:15] puts
[58:16] burdens on our hearts for one another
[58:18] because that's the type of god he is
[58:21] so when our prayers are all about
[58:22] ourselves and all about
[58:36] god is looking for us
[58:39] to enter into his network of prayer
[58:42] for one another
[58:45] it's a network of prayer one for another
[58:48] at home i was just praying lord what can
[58:52] we do in this situation
[58:54] i mean so many things are changing
[58:58] the hindrances and how it's affecting
[59:01] the church and
[59:02] many families are not here today
[59:06] but it's not just here it's many
[59:08] churches
[59:09] are in this same situation
[59:13] and people wanting to believers our
[59:17] our loving brothers and sisters in
[59:19] christ are
[59:21] feeling they want to feel
[59:25] the wise and safe thing to do is
[59:28] is to stay safe
[59:31] and i one thousand percent
[59:34] uh support that
[59:38] but it puts us in a position
[59:42] of what do we do but
[59:45] let this be the time that we enter into
[59:48] prayer as we've never
[59:49] prayed before because
[59:52] god works through prayer
[59:56] [Music]
[59:58] and we can thrive in god's economy god
[1:00:01] operates all sorts of three all sorts of
[1:00:04] things through the
[1:00:05] to the network of prayer he meets
[1:00:08] needs through prayer
[1:00:14] he will never we
[1:00:18] will never be able to thrive as a
[1:00:20] christian without
[1:00:22] prayer we can be so on fire
[1:00:26] for god even though we're not in church
[1:00:29] because here's the thing to whom much is
[1:00:30] given much is required
[1:00:34] and if everything is fine and these
[1:00:36] doors are open
[1:00:37] god expects us to be here but in this
[1:00:40] situation
[1:00:42] where there's certain convictions
[1:00:45] certain immune systems that don't feel
[1:00:48] safe
[1:00:49] god sees that god understands that
[1:00:53] but that does not should not separate us
[1:00:56] from thriving
[1:00:57] in god's economy through prayer
[1:01:02] i'll tell you it should open the door
[1:01:04] for us to enter into prayer more
[1:01:12] now god can do anything without us he's
[1:01:14] god
[1:01:18] but he has made some choices one of
[1:01:21] those choices that god
[1:01:22] has made is that he uses our prayers
[1:01:26] to carry out his will
[1:01:31] amen for his body
[1:01:36] in other words we don't pray his will is
[1:01:39] not going to be done
[1:01:41] things are going to suffer if you've got
[1:01:43] a need
[1:01:44] in your physical body
[1:01:48] and you don't tend to that need
[1:01:52] that is going to turn into something
[1:01:54] worse
[1:01:58] so you try to take care of that need
[1:02:04] it's the same thing when there's a need
[1:02:06] in the body
[1:02:08] if you don't pray that need is not going
[1:02:11] to get met
[1:02:13] we're so used to god just doing
[1:02:15] everything without you
[1:02:19] we're missing out on thriving in god's
[1:02:21] economy
[1:02:24] god needs us to pray for one another
[1:02:27] to pray for his body that it'll be
[1:02:29] healed amen we've got many
[1:02:31] many needs that that will function
[1:02:33] normally
[1:02:34] that it wouldn't be inhibited by fear
[1:02:37] that we would be
[1:02:38] free to move around in the spirit
[1:02:41] amen god wants to see the whole body
[1:02:45] in harmony in unity healthy
[1:02:48] thriving in god's economy amen ephesians
[1:02:52] chapter 4 verse 16.
[1:02:55] paul speaking to ephesians church from
[1:02:58] whom the whole body
[1:03:00] the whole body is fitly joined together
[1:03:06] and compacted by that which
[1:03:09] every joint supplier
[1:03:12] there is a function with every
[1:03:16] joint in your physical body
[1:03:19] if it does not give the lubricant that
[1:03:22] it needs there
[1:03:24] you're going to wake up stiffer than a
[1:03:28] board
[1:03:31] according to the effectual working in
[1:03:33] every measure
[1:03:35] of most of the parts
[1:03:38] no every part we have a part to play
[1:03:43] making
[1:03:44] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:03:48] of itself in love
[1:03:53] now i
[1:03:59] i couldn't help but to watch uh this
[1:04:02] doctor
[1:04:03] as he kept
[1:04:06] taking this hand and putting it on his
[1:04:08] other shoulder
[1:04:11] because the pain that he was suffering
[1:04:14] from in his back was affecting
[1:04:16] and that's how it is when there there is
[1:04:19] a need
[1:04:20] in your body another part of your body
[1:04:22] wants to help that need
[1:04:25] because you're feeling the effect of
[1:04:27] that body
[1:04:28] and just because you are maybe going
[1:04:31] through something
[1:04:32] god's still feeling the effect of
[1:04:35] somebody in the body
[1:04:38] and when you're in connection with god
[1:04:40] god will lay on your heart
[1:04:41] how to pray for that person and with so
[1:04:45] many needs
[1:04:46] we shouldn't be lacking for anything to
[1:04:48] pray about amen
[1:04:52] i got the same verse from another
[1:04:55] version
[1:04:56] the asv version i just want to read it
[1:05:00] to you
[1:05:01] from whom all the body fitly framed
[1:05:05] and knitted together all that word
[1:05:09] knitted you know anybody that knits
[1:05:12] you know you're sewing in and out around
[1:05:14] and you're
[1:05:15] connecting everything we're connected
[1:05:19] through that which every joint supplieth
[1:05:22] according to the working
[1:05:24] in due measure of several parts making
[1:05:27] the increase of the body
[1:05:28] unto the building of itself
[1:05:31] in love in other words the purpose that
[1:05:34] you're praying for somebody
[1:05:36] is that you're in love with the body
[1:05:42] if you don't care about your body you're
[1:05:44] not going to take care of yourself
[1:05:48] but when you love your body you want to
[1:05:52] take care of it
[1:05:56] the eye doesn't say to the hand
[1:06:00] or to the ear or to the nose
[1:06:04] was talking to my daughter she wanted to
[1:06:06] my daughter elizabeth
[1:06:08] wanted to thank everybody for their
[1:06:10] prayers for her
[1:06:12] the church up there as
[1:06:15] you are aware requests have
[1:06:18] have come forth that they had battled
[1:06:21] some covid
[1:06:26] and she told me last night on the phone
[1:06:28] that she still hasn't regained
[1:06:30] her smell
[1:06:34] now can you imagine her being having the
[1:06:36] attitude well
[1:06:37] i can't smell i'm okay with that as long
[1:06:40] as i can
[1:06:41] walk
[1:06:45] no we want our smell we want our taste
[1:06:49] we want to see we want everybody here we
[1:06:52] want the whole body
[1:06:55] and we need love for the body
[1:06:59] love for one another to pray one for
[1:07:02] another
[1:07:03] we need to get involved in love with one
[1:07:06] another
[1:07:07] so we can pray the way that god wants us
[1:07:10] to pray and thrive in his economy
[1:07:16] turn with me if you would to the book of
[1:07:18] ephesians chapter four
[1:07:21] god is one and he has one body and he
[1:07:24] doesn't want there to be any
[1:07:25] isms or schisms or you know just because
[1:07:28] i'm not this it doesn't matter
[1:07:32] it's our it's our job it is our job to
[1:07:34] make sure
[1:07:35] there's no isms no problems it isn't
[1:07:38] somebody else's
[1:07:39] it's our job
[1:07:44] ephesians chapter 4 verse 1. i therefore
[1:07:46] the prisoner of the lord beseech you
[1:07:47] that you walk worthy
[1:07:48] of the calling wherewith you've been
[1:07:50] called with all
[1:07:52] lowliness and meekness and long
[1:07:54] suffering for bearing one another
[1:07:57] in love now this is what is required
[1:08:00] for the body notice it's a total
[1:08:03] different
[1:08:04] mindset than just a haughtiness
[1:08:07] arrogancy judgment no patience
[1:08:13] that is not needed what we need
[1:08:17] for the body is to be long suffering
[1:08:21] to be patient to be kind and loving
[1:08:25] because there's a need
[1:08:29] did you ever get a cut in your body or
[1:08:32] something in your body i
[1:08:33] i'm dealing with some tennis elbow right
[1:08:35] now been dealing with it for about
[1:08:37] a little over uh probably a month
[1:08:41] and i'll tell you yeah i want that thing
[1:08:43] taken care of
[1:08:45] if anybody's ever had that the pain
[1:08:47] that's associated that when you're using
[1:08:48] your
[1:08:49] your arms and trying to function right
[1:08:52] and you you want that need just taken
[1:08:54] care of right away
[1:08:58] but it don't happen that way
[1:09:01] because of the inflammation it takes
[1:09:03] time so you're going to be long
[1:09:05] suffering
[1:09:06] got to be pain you got to perform bear
[1:09:08] sometimes it needs
[1:09:09] i put a brace on
[1:09:14] the body is no different
[1:09:17] we need to be praying one for another
[1:09:19] they that are strong and bear the
[1:09:21] affirmatives of the weak
[1:09:24] giving diligence
[1:09:27] to keep the unity of the spirit in the
[1:09:30] bone of peace
[1:09:31] now he says there is one body one spirit
[1:09:33] even as you're called into
[1:09:34] one hope of your calling one lord one
[1:09:37] faith one baptism one god
[1:09:39] and father of all who's overall through
[1:09:41] all and in all
[1:09:43] god is teaching us about him being
[1:09:46] one and
[1:09:49] he doesn't have two bodies
[1:09:53] we're all part of god so
[1:09:56] when your flesh wants to separate
[1:09:58] yourself
[1:09:59] because of something you're going
[1:10:02] against
[1:10:03] god's will for your life
[1:10:08] well it's between me and god your walk
[1:10:11] is between you and god
[1:10:14] but you need to be interested in the
[1:10:15] body
[1:10:17] if not something is wrong
[1:10:22] something is wrong prayer
[1:10:25] is what brings oneness
[1:10:28] with god and we have to have oneness
[1:10:32] with god
[1:10:33] before we can ever have oneness with the
[1:10:35] body
[1:10:37] i'll just say it like this if we are not
[1:10:39] one with the body
[1:10:40] i question that we're one with god
[1:10:45] i question it i'll never forget
[1:10:48] brother rowal telling me in my living
[1:10:50] room
[1:10:51] he said we must be
[1:10:55] have our communion and our fellowship
[1:10:58] vertical first before we can have it
[1:11:02] horizontal we've got to be one with god
[1:11:06] in order to be one with the body
[1:11:10] now you've got all the the churches and
[1:11:12] the the denominations of the world and
[1:11:15] they don't understand
[1:11:16] what it means to live a surrendered life
[1:11:18] and they they
[1:11:19] still pray for one another and they
[1:11:21] still have that contact with one another
[1:11:24] but they don't understand oneness
[1:11:30] god has blessed us with a message
[1:11:34] to teach us how to be one
[1:11:44] remember jesus prayed to the father in
[1:11:46] john chapter 17
[1:11:48] verse 20.
[1:11:52] neither pray i for these alone but for
[1:11:55] them
[1:11:57] that will be sitting in cinderlight
[1:11:59] church
[1:12:01] sunday december 13th he prayed for us
[1:12:10] what was on his heart at that time that
[1:12:12] he prayed
[1:12:16] that they all may be one
[1:12:19] as thou father art in me and i in thee
[1:12:22] that they also may be one in us
[1:12:26] and that the world may believe that thou
[1:12:27] has sent me and the glory which thou has
[1:12:30] given
[1:12:30] me i give them that they may be one
[1:12:34] excuse me even as we are one so it's
[1:12:37] about a oneness that god's looking for
[1:12:39] here
[1:12:41] i in them thou in me that they may be
[1:12:44] made perfect in one
[1:12:49] and that the world may know that thou
[1:12:50] sent me and i have loved them and
[1:12:52] as thou has loved me
[1:12:57] wow i don't think there's any room for
[1:13:01] isms and schisms in the body
[1:13:04] there's no room for a little you and big
[1:13:06] me
[1:13:08] we're all one
[1:13:12] i'm not going to put myself up above you
[1:13:16] but don't you dare try to put yourself
[1:13:18] up above anybody
[1:13:20] don't don't you dare put somebody
[1:13:22] underneath you
[1:13:23] there is no room we're all one in christ
[1:13:29] prayer is what brings oneness in unity
[1:13:33] and jesus himself used the weapon of
[1:13:36] prayer
[1:13:36] for oneness and if he could do it
[1:13:40] we need to do it pray the same prayer
[1:13:44] for oneness amongst us hallelujah
[1:13:50] colossians chapter 1 verse 17
[1:13:53] paul is speaking to the church he said
[1:13:57] and he is before all things and in him
[1:13:59] all things consist
[1:14:01] and he is the head of the body the
[1:14:03] church who is the beginning the
[1:14:05] firstborn of the dead
[1:14:07] that in all things he might have the
[1:14:10] preeminence
[1:14:13] god wants the preeminence if god wants
[1:14:16] oneness
[1:14:19] we need to yield ourself to god
[1:14:24] all one all one
[1:14:27] i can take a big chunk of ice
[1:14:30] one chunk of ice pure
[1:14:34] water
[1:14:37] and i hit that thing with a hammer and
[1:14:38] it falls into many pieces
[1:14:42] in one sense it's separated but in
[1:14:44] another sense it's part of
[1:14:46] what it was a one chunk to begin with
[1:14:52] that chunk may go into your cup of water
[1:14:55] that chunk may go into your cup of
[1:14:57] pop
[1:15:00] but it's all the same chunk we're all
[1:15:04] one in christ
[1:15:13] those who leave everything in god's
[1:15:16] hands
[1:15:17] will eventually see god's hands in
[1:15:22] everything
[1:15:24] we need to let god be preeminent
[1:15:27] we don't want to take charge
[1:15:30] i think if there's anything you want to
[1:15:32] take charge of it's that flesh that you
[1:15:35] deal with
[1:15:36] take charge of that thing but don't
[1:15:40] take charge of how you think things
[1:15:42] should go
[1:15:45] put it in god's hands learn through
[1:15:48] prayer to put things in god's hands
[1:15:49] proverbs chapter 3 verse 5
[1:15:51] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[1:15:53] and lean not to i don't understand i was
[1:15:55] listening to a part of the
[1:15:57] brother branham's tape last night and he
[1:15:58] called it lean not to thy own
[1:15:59] understanding
[1:16:01] trust in the lord with all thy heart
[1:16:02] lean not to their own understanding in
[1:16:04] all thy ways acknowledge
[1:16:06] him and he shall direct thy paths
[1:16:11] but i hope that you're praying for me
[1:16:14] because i want god to direct my path and
[1:16:16] i need your prayers
[1:16:20] need to make sure that when i'm up here
[1:16:22] i'm not
[1:16:23] preaching about uh some uh
[1:16:26] great revelation that i think i got
[1:16:31] when god wants me to be speaking on
[1:16:33] prayer
[1:16:35] are you catching what i'm saying i know
[1:16:37] that i know that i know god
[1:16:39] is in this today
[1:16:42] and we need to depend we need to depend
[1:16:45] on god to bring the word for us
[1:16:49] not that john's up there doing his best
[1:16:51] to help some people
[1:16:52] it's not that it's god almighty helping
[1:16:56] his spiritual body
[1:17:01] i'll be the first to tell you i have no
[1:17:04] idea what god is doing
[1:17:09] and he's not obligated to tell me and i
[1:17:11] don't even ask him to tell me
[1:17:14] i just ask him to tell me lord what does
[1:17:17] your people need
[1:17:18] what do you want for your people because
[1:17:20] that's all that matters to me
[1:17:26] god wants preeminence and he needs
[1:17:28] preeminence
[1:17:29] and it must be done through free more
[1:17:32] agency in other words you must give
[1:17:34] yourself over to you must surrender
[1:17:37] yourself over to it
[1:17:39] god uses your prayers to bring about
[1:17:42] what is
[1:17:42] truly needed for his body
[1:17:45] those prayers it what brings
[1:17:49] harmony with god to move in other words
[1:17:52] god will refuse to meet that need until
[1:17:55] somebody prays for that need that's just
[1:17:57] the way god
[1:17:58] operates now he can do anything
[1:18:01] he's god
[1:18:04] but he refuses unless you pray
[1:18:09] now god died for our sins
[1:18:12] and we can pray god forgive me of those
[1:18:14] sins
[1:18:16] but if we choose not to forgive our
[1:18:18] brother god
[1:18:19] chooses not to forgive us
[1:18:22] so god has choices too
[1:18:27] and god chooses to use your prayers
[1:18:30] that's why we need to pray
[1:18:34] it's a way for us to get involved in
[1:18:36] god's economy
[1:18:39] instead of just i don't i don't i i
[1:18:42] don't have nothing to do with it it's
[1:18:43] just so far out there
[1:18:44] it doesn't matter what i do how many
[1:18:46] times i pray
[1:18:48] nothing ever happens that is just a lie
[1:18:51] from the devil come on say amen to the
[1:18:54] word
[1:18:56] amen it is the factual fervent prayer of
[1:18:59] a righteous man that availeth much
[1:19:02] god uses prayer
[1:19:06] we need to keep praying
[1:19:11] when one part of the body begins to have
[1:19:13] a need your
[1:19:14] headship or your intelligence tells you
[1:19:17] oh
[1:19:18] ow there's a sliver i got to get that
[1:19:20] sliver out
[1:19:22] your intelligence tells you
[1:19:26] you better take care of it and it uses
[1:19:29] another part of the body
[1:19:30] to take care of that need it's the same
[1:19:33] thing in prayer
[1:19:34] the intelligence of almighty god through
[1:19:36] the power of the holy spirit
[1:19:37] lays the burden on your heart pray for
[1:19:40] that one that person's got a spiritual
[1:19:42] sliver of their eye
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:49] god lays burdens on her heart
[1:19:53] one choice god has made is that often he
[1:19:56] cannot operate
[1:19:57] his will outside of your prayers
[1:20:01] that's you know even jesus when his
[1:20:04] disciples came to him
[1:20:05] and they asked him lord would you teach
[1:20:07] us how to pray well how
[1:20:09] what the fundamentals and how do you
[1:20:11] just pray and in that fundamentals he
[1:20:14] said
[1:20:14] lord thy will be done
[1:20:18] on earth as it is in heaven there's a
[1:20:20] will in heaven for us today
[1:20:25] and when we learn to pray lord that your
[1:20:27] will be done here
[1:20:30] in this local body as it is in heaven
[1:20:36] hallelujah he uses
[1:20:40] prayers to carry out his will for the
[1:20:42] body
[1:20:43] another choice that god has made is that
[1:20:45] prayer alone
[1:20:46] is not enough
[1:20:50] you've got to have faith when you pray
[1:20:53] without faith we can't even please god
[1:20:57] how is god going to answer a murmuring
[1:20:59] complaining prayer
[1:21:02] think about what i'm saying here prayer
[1:21:04] is important but if we don't have the
[1:21:06] right attitude in our prayer
[1:21:08] then it's not going to get the job done
[1:21:13] we must get into the spirit
[1:21:16] of prayer willing to wait on the lord
[1:21:20] will eventually get us in the spirit of
[1:21:22] prayer
[1:21:22] i received a quote this morning from my
[1:21:25] daughter ann
[1:21:29] she said if you don't pray often
[1:21:32] you won't gain a love for praying
[1:21:37] prayer is work and therefore
[1:21:41] it is not very appealing to our natural
[1:21:45] sensibilities but the simple rule of
[1:21:48] prayer
[1:21:49] is this begin praying and your taste for
[1:21:52] prayer will increase
[1:21:54] the more you pray the more you acquire
[1:21:57] the desire for prayer the energy for
[1:21:59] prayer
[1:22:01] and the sense of purpose
[1:22:04] in prayer this is important for our
[1:22:08] message
[1:22:09] praying always ephesians chapter 6 verse
[1:22:12] 18
[1:22:12] ephesians 6 chapter chapter 6 verse 18
[1:22:16] praying always with all
[1:22:19] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:22:23] and watching there unto with all
[1:22:25] perseverance
[1:22:26] and supplications for your favorite
[1:22:28] friends
[1:22:37] for your enemies to those you don't get
[1:22:39] along with
[1:22:41] for those you don't seem to care much
[1:22:43] for
[1:22:48] the way that we view prayer is different
[1:22:51] than the way god
[1:22:52] views prayer he wants us praying for
[1:22:55] everybody
[1:22:57] without respect to persons
[1:23:00] there's many needs enter into the spirit
[1:23:04] of prayer
[1:23:05] supplicating caring about everybody just
[1:23:08] get in prayer
[1:23:09] and start calling out people's names one
[1:23:11] after another after another
[1:23:13] and before you know it there'll come a
[1:23:15] burden on your heart for certain
[1:23:17] people and when you enter into that you
[1:23:20] you've made connection with the holy
[1:23:22] ghost
[1:23:22] and god uses that network your prayer in
[1:23:25] that network to meet that need
[1:23:28] well brother john when i talked to them
[1:23:30] they they didn't
[1:23:31] they weren't totally deliberate of that
[1:23:33] you maybe they weren't but your prayer
[1:23:35] was needed to help them get through that
[1:23:39] we can't sit here and and and use our
[1:23:42] imagination
[1:23:43] and how we think things should go
[1:23:52] if you feel weak in prayer just just
[1:23:55] start
[1:23:56] with getting on your knees just wait
[1:24:00] there
[1:24:03] he'll draw nigh to you
[1:24:06] isaiah chapter 40 verse 28
[1:24:10] has thou not known has thou not heard
[1:24:13] that the everlasting god the lord the
[1:24:15] creator
[1:24:16] of the ends of the earth fainteth not
[1:24:17] neither is he
[1:24:19] weary remember opening scripture now
[1:24:22] men ought always to pray
[1:24:26] and not faint
[1:24:30] doesn't faint there's no searching of
[1:24:32] his understanding
[1:24:33] he giveth power to those
[1:24:36] of us when we're fainting
[1:24:40] i've been in this category many times
[1:24:45] and i would not be here today unless
[1:24:48] god gave me some power
[1:24:52] and the power that he gives you you may
[1:24:55] need
[1:24:56] more power tomorrow and more power the
[1:24:59] next day
[1:25:01] the key though is wait on the lord why
[1:25:04] doesn't he just give you power no matter
[1:25:05] what
[1:25:06] because he wants a relationship with you
[1:25:09] he wants you to spend time with you
[1:25:12] he's more interested in that communion
[1:25:15] with you
[1:25:15] than you just getting what you want
[1:25:20] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[1:25:22] that have no might he
[1:25:24] increases strength even the you shall
[1:25:27] faint and be weary
[1:25:29] we're living in that hour and the young
[1:25:31] men shall hardly fall
[1:25:34] but they that wait upon the lord shall
[1:25:37] renew their strength
[1:25:39] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[1:25:41] they shall run and not be weary
[1:25:43] they shall walk and not faint
[1:25:48] god has power for every one of us
[1:25:51] he has strength for every one of us
[1:25:55] but we've got to be willing to enter in
[1:25:57] to that network of prayer with him
[1:26:01] as you begin to strengthen yourself from
[1:26:03] prayer god uses you more and more for
[1:26:05] the body
[1:26:06] i mean a lot of times we get so weak in
[1:26:08] prayer that we can hardly pray ourselves
[1:26:09] our own needs
[1:26:11] but after you you gain strength and you
[1:26:14] you begin to
[1:26:15] increase in strength
[1:26:18] then you you can enter now into prayer
[1:26:20] one for another
[1:26:22] it's true and i'll just say like this
[1:26:26] sometimes i've started out praying for
[1:26:29] one another when i haven't seen to get
[1:26:32] where i want to get to with god
[1:26:34] in my prayers i just feel like
[1:26:37] lord where am i missing you
[1:26:42] and then i began to just pray for others
[1:26:46] and god is so pleased with that he is so
[1:26:49] faithful for his presence to come when
[1:26:51] you start praying for somebody
[1:26:53] it's as sure as anything because god is
[1:26:57] one that lives for others
[1:27:01] and all of a sudden faith begins to rise
[1:27:03] in your heart
[1:27:05] and then you can pray for yourself the
[1:27:06] way you should
[1:27:10] unselfishly amen
[1:27:14] praying always with all prayer and
[1:27:16] supplication
[1:27:17] in the spirit and watching there and to
[1:27:20] with all perseverance and supplication
[1:27:22] for all the saints now there's a whole
[1:27:24] lot in there but basically you need to
[1:27:26] be paying attention to the rest of the
[1:27:27] body
[1:27:29] you need to be paying attention this
[1:27:31] church is more than just you
[1:27:34] i'm not belittling you i'm just saying
[1:27:36] there's more than to you
[1:27:38] you need to be thinking about others if
[1:27:40] we thought about prayed about others
[1:27:42] more did you know you'd be happier
[1:27:47] we'd be stronger we'd be thriving in
[1:27:51] god's economy
[1:27:52] it wouldn't matter what's happening with
[1:27:54] colvin
[1:27:59] james chapter 5 verse 13 it's through
[1:28:02] prayer that needs
[1:28:04] are met
[1:28:08] is any among you afflicted of course
[1:28:11] what's the answer let
[1:28:15] him pray
[1:28:19] well brother john i'm afflicted
[1:28:24] why don't you pray from me
[1:28:28] what does the scripture say is any
[1:28:30] afflicted
[1:28:31] let him pray
[1:28:37] now i understand when you're not doing
[1:28:40] well
[1:28:42] it's really hard to enter in i
[1:28:44] understand that
[1:28:45] but you've got to try to do your part
[1:28:49] and the more you pray the more god's
[1:28:53] heart
[1:28:54] will begin to work in others to pray for
[1:28:57] you
[1:29:01] is any mary let him sing psalms
[1:29:07] is any sick among you let him call for
[1:29:10] the elders of the church
[1:29:12] and let them pray over him amen
[1:29:16] anointing him with oil in the name of
[1:29:20] the lord
[1:29:22] his name is a high tower
[1:29:25] the righteous run into it and they're
[1:29:28] safe amen
[1:29:31] and the prayer of what faith
[1:29:34] not the prayer of complaining of
[1:29:37] murmuring
[1:29:38] of why me lord why do i gotta pray why
[1:29:40] am i going through this
[1:29:41] that does not avail
[1:29:45] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:29:48] and the lord shall raise him up and if
[1:29:51] he have committed sins
[1:29:54] they shall be forgiven him
[1:29:59] so don't be thinking well i have sinned
[1:30:02] too much
[1:30:04] i have it does not matter
[1:30:08] the promise is if he has sinned they
[1:30:11] shall be forgiven
[1:30:13] keep praying keep believing
[1:30:17] confess your faults one to another
[1:30:22] pray one for another
[1:30:26] that ye may be healed
[1:30:30] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:30:33] righteous
[1:30:34] man gets the job done
[1:30:37] it availeth much
[1:30:40] elias was a man subject to light
[1:30:42] passions as we are
[1:30:43] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[1:30:46] not rain
[1:30:46] and it rained not on the earth by the
[1:30:48] space of three years and six months and
[1:30:50] he prayed again
[1:30:52] and the heaven gave rain and the earth
[1:30:54] brought forth her fruit
[1:30:57] now this may seem kind of weird that god
[1:31:00] had asked someone not to pray and didn't
[1:31:01] pray and then
[1:31:03] god wanted to pray again to reign
[1:31:07] did i say that right no say it again
[1:31:11] i'll say it again it may seem weird that
[1:31:14] god would ask somebody to pray for
[1:31:16] that it would not rain for three and a
[1:31:20] half years
[1:31:21] and then after the three and a half
[1:31:22] years he would put on his heart to pray
[1:31:24] again that it would rain
[1:31:29] now i don't think elijah
[1:31:32] would say look we got to sit down and
[1:31:34] talk about this you know it's going to
[1:31:36] hurt the economy
[1:31:37] the the crops it's going to really hurt
[1:31:39] these families
[1:31:42] we're not in the business of telling god
[1:31:44] what to do
[1:31:46] or rearranging his thinking about
[1:31:48] certain situations
[1:31:51] god just wants us to do what he wants us
[1:31:54] to do
[1:31:55] and pray if he puts on your heart pray
[1:31:57] for them pray for that person
[1:31:59] you get so locked in the spirit you
[1:32:01] won't even realize why you're saying
[1:32:03] what you're saying
[1:32:04] but it's god using your body your vessel
[1:32:07] to meet that need whatever god is
[1:32:10] wanting of that need
[1:32:13] it may seem contrary to your thinking
[1:32:16] but god wasn't off when he told elisha
[1:32:18] to do that
[1:32:22] god's not off when he tells you how to
[1:32:24] pray
[1:32:26] but we've got to get into the network of
[1:32:28] prayer
[1:32:31] see the purpose of prayer god operates
[1:32:33] through prayer
[1:32:34] we can thrive in god's economy through
[1:32:37] prayer it becomes a great
[1:32:40] symphony of prayer when all of us are
[1:32:43] praying
[1:32:45] i'm sure you've either all been to a
[1:32:47] symphony
[1:32:49] or you have seen a symphony
[1:32:54] and all these uh musicians
[1:32:57] uh are there in some sort of
[1:33:00] order and uh
[1:33:04] they're all facing one way
[1:33:08] some are sitting some are standing
[1:33:13] but they're there for a purpose
[1:33:17] to play their part
[1:33:21] in this theme that they're going to be
[1:33:26] given this music on
[1:33:33] and they're not facing different
[1:33:35] directions
[1:33:37] you don't see some guitarist or some
[1:33:41] guy over on the side look at me look at
[1:33:45] me
[1:33:48] some guy in the drums doing
[1:33:52] no they're there in sync
[1:33:56] paying attention to the conductor
[1:33:59] god is the great conductor
[1:34:06] and they have been trained
[1:34:10] to get in harmony
[1:34:14] with the conductor and that conductor he
[1:34:17] stands
[1:34:18] in front of them and every one of them
[1:34:20] are looking at him
[1:34:22] they're paying attention
[1:34:25] and i've often wondered why does that
[1:34:28] man
[1:34:29] stand up there and go
[1:34:40] don't they know the song by now
[1:34:46] but he's speaking to them
[1:34:52] he's reminded them he said i'll bring
[1:34:54] all things to your remembrance
[1:34:58] i'll lay burns on your heart
[1:35:03] and when a song is being played
[1:35:08] you've got so many different instruments
[1:35:13] when the flutes are supposed to be
[1:35:15] playing you definitely don't want the
[1:35:18] drums and the trombones and the
[1:35:21] the banjo coming in it's not the time
[1:35:25] for it
[1:35:30] so we all have a part to play
[1:35:34] how many times you just you want to go
[1:35:36] up to somebody you just want to
[1:35:37] say something but it didn't work out
[1:35:41] it just wasn't time
[1:35:44] you wait your time
[1:35:47] stay in prayer god will open the door he
[1:35:50] opens the door that no man closes amen
[1:35:53] and he closes the door when it's time to
[1:35:55] close the door
[1:36:00] now this is what happens in prayer
[1:36:04] we're part of the orchestra of god we
[1:36:07] are
[1:36:08] part of god's orchestra
[1:36:12] and the holy spirit is trying to conduct
[1:36:17] a song pleasing to his ears
[1:36:23] amen there's no greater song than when
[1:36:26] you're praying for a soul to come to
[1:36:28] jesus
[1:36:31] heaven rejoices over that song
[1:36:36] that's where his heart is at
[1:36:41] we get so stuck on ourselves we don't
[1:36:43] hardly think of others
[1:36:46] that's why we need to be paying
[1:36:47] attention to the conductor
[1:36:50] because he's going to lay on your heart
[1:36:55] to pray for somebody
[1:36:58] somebody that needs a job
[1:37:04] somebody that needs a place to live
[1:37:07] there's a sister
[1:37:08] that needs to be baptized
[1:37:14] there's a sister who's who's struggling
[1:37:16] who's fainting
[1:37:20] and the conductor he's wanting you this
[1:37:23] is the time for you to come in and pray
[1:37:25] because he's touched he's speaking to
[1:37:27] your heart he's looking directly this is
[1:37:29] a time to play your instrument
[1:37:32] get on your knees and pray
[1:37:36] there's some young mother that's
[1:37:39] learning
[1:37:40] how to bring a child into the world and
[1:37:42] does it never done it before
[1:37:44] pray for that one there's someone that's
[1:37:47] struggling with colvin pray for that one
[1:37:50] there's dan bezzakowski he is leaving
[1:37:52] the pride on it
[1:37:56] it's time i want you to pray for him
[1:38:00] well what does it matter god knows just
[1:38:02] pray for him
[1:38:06] what about this this this sister that
[1:38:08] hasn't come for a while don't talk about
[1:38:10] it
[1:38:10] pray it's your turn to pray look at the
[1:38:13] conductor he's laying down your heart
[1:38:15] there's a there's a symphony going on
[1:38:22] look at our poor sister cheryl
[1:38:26] i personally never seen anything quite
[1:38:29] like how
[1:38:30] you can have a good day in the next days
[1:38:31] like the bomb fell out
[1:38:40] we need to pray one for another not just
[1:38:43] because she's my wife
[1:38:46] she's part of the body vital part of the
[1:38:49] body
[1:38:51] a part of the body that we're all
[1:38:52] affected by
[1:38:54] when she's having a bad day we're having
[1:38:56] a bad day here
[1:38:59] when she's happy playing we're all happy
[1:39:01] singing
[1:39:03] are you with me
[1:39:06] what about when you think about those
[1:39:09] that are not in church
[1:39:11] that's god telling you it's your turn
[1:39:13] it's your turn to pray
[1:39:14] i need you to pray right now for that
[1:39:16] part of the body
[1:39:20] but look at the re it doesn't matter
[1:39:21] pray pray
[1:39:23] god knows what he's doing just i need
[1:39:25] you to pray for the body
[1:39:28] it's how it functions
[1:39:33] you take any organ in your body don't
[1:39:36] talk about the appendix right now
[1:39:37] but you think about any organ in your
[1:39:39] body and if there is a need
[1:39:43] you give it help look at the boy who
[1:39:46] who ate those erasers all the time
[1:39:50] something inside of there was a deep
[1:39:51] calling inside of him
[1:39:53] for sulfur
[1:39:58] he didn't know what he was doing he just
[1:40:01] needed it
[1:40:04] we need to get in prayer and get into a
[1:40:08] harmony with the symphony
[1:40:10] of prayer god wants to use us
[1:40:13] together as one body praying
[1:40:17] one for another not some little group
[1:40:21] the percussion's out to the side just
[1:40:23] oh it's all about me
[1:40:26] god's not pleased with that attitude
[1:40:30] no matter what church you'd be and he
[1:40:32] wouldn't be pleased with that ed
[1:40:33] well i wouldn't have that attitude if i
[1:40:34] was in another church i don't believe
[1:40:36] that
[1:40:37] i i don't believe that god don't believe
[1:40:40] that you are who you are
[1:40:47] a symphony a prayer
[1:40:50] god conducting the symphony
[1:40:54] a lot of times we don't want to show up
[1:40:55] for practice
[1:41:00] and when it comes time to perform i'm so
[1:41:03] busy i got other things on my heart i
[1:41:04] don't even hear the
[1:41:06] symphony going
[1:41:16] we're just so far away
[1:41:21] god is here conducting
[1:41:25] his music of his will
[1:41:29] he just needs you to pray you don't got
[1:41:32] to know what to say
[1:41:34] just pray when you get in the spirit god
[1:41:37] will use your vessel
[1:41:38] he will use your heart he will use your
[1:41:41] words
[1:41:42] he will use your your your spirit
[1:41:47] and if you don't needs aren't going to
[1:41:49] be met
[1:41:51] but brother john i have a need god
[1:41:53] hasn't met it yet well i want to ask you
[1:41:55] a question
[1:41:55] did you seek first the kingdom of god
[1:41:58] and his righteousness
[1:42:00] god's not a liar
[1:42:03] god is more interested in you spending
[1:42:05] time with him than your need being met
[1:42:07] you may be interested
[1:42:08] in your need being met god is calling us
[1:42:15] to a sympathy of prayer
[1:42:18] at home spend more time in prayer
[1:42:24] i've been challenged with this myself
[1:42:26] i'm not in a different spot than you
[1:42:30] but i don't want you to listen to that
[1:42:31] devil that says well we're just kind of
[1:42:33] like
[1:42:33] in a waiting period
[1:42:39] there's not a whole lot you can do souls
[1:42:42] can be won
[1:42:42] if you got in the spirit god can use
[1:42:45] your prayers to win a soul
[1:42:47] somewhere on a foreign field
[1:42:53] how many is praying for brother mark's
[1:42:55] bible studies
[1:42:57] here's a man who's reaching out
[1:43:04] maybe we got behind it a little bit more
[1:43:08] maybe we see a soul come from it amen
[1:43:14] we need to get in in sync
[1:43:17] with the lord amen let's stand together
[1:43:21] may god bless you as you labor to enter
[1:43:24] in
[1:43:26] to prayer like never ever before
[1:43:29] god will use your prayers a lot more
[1:43:32] than the devil is going to tell you
[1:43:35] just believe only believe all
[1:43:38] things are possible to him that
[1:43:39] believeth
[1:43:45] i have a list of a lot of needs in our
[1:43:49] church
[1:43:51] because you know honestly every one of
[1:43:53] us has needs
[1:43:58] and there's just something about when
[1:43:59] you care about somebody else's need
[1:44:04] that god moves in behalf of those needs
[1:44:11] i've witnessed it so many times when
[1:44:13] people are praying for somebody else god
[1:44:15] meets their need
[1:44:16] they didn't even ask for it i've seen
[1:44:19] that
[1:44:20] that's the way god operates
[1:44:24] and to know that we can
[1:44:27] be in harmony with the lord
[1:44:30] not just you know here there but there's
[1:44:32] a
[1:44:33] i'm in sync i've been praying
[1:44:37] and you know you don't have to
[1:44:41] tell anybody you're praying for them
[1:44:50] what you have to do is pray for them
[1:44:54] god is the one that meets the need
[1:44:58] now it's encouraging to know that we're
[1:45:00] praying one for another
[1:45:01] it is it is and we really all appreciate
[1:45:05] that
[1:45:05] but what is needed greater is that we
[1:45:08] pray
[1:45:09] one for another in the spirit
[1:45:14] because it's the effectual fervent
[1:45:15] prayer that gets the job done
[1:45:18] and god is looking to us his body to
[1:45:20] pray one for another
[1:45:23] more than we've ever prayed before we're
[1:45:25] living in an hour
[1:45:28] amen let's bow our hearts in prayer
[1:45:30] before i
[1:45:31] ask the lord is there someone here today

[1:46:10] that you use the prayer
[1:46:14] of someone to save us
[1:46:18] to bring us to you
[1:46:21] you use the prayer of someone
[1:46:26] that we got healed that we got delivered
[1:46:29] that we got strengthened that we got
[1:46:31] encouraged

[1:47:04] of praying the way that you
[1:47:08] have ordained us to pray one for another
[1:47:13] i pray that your blood
[1:47:18] will cover us today that just wash us
[1:47:22] but lord that that blood would remain
[1:47:25] there that life there that we could
[1:47:27] apply it to our lives sin that we could
[1:47:31] have a time of prayer
[1:47:35] set aside every day
[1:47:40] interceding for all saints
[1:47:43] in the spirit may take us a little bit
[1:47:47] to get strength to get out of the flesh
[1:47:49] to enter in
[1:47:52] but oh god it's worth it
[1:47:57] because you'll use every single one of
[1:48:00] us
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] when we effectually fervently pray
[1:48:06] for one another that those
[1:48:10] needs that we pray for will be met
[1:48:13] that our prayers would avail much that
[1:48:16] they would accomplish much
[1:48:17] because they met the purpose
[1:48:22] bless every heart here bless every
[1:48:25] heart that's watching in right now

[2:26:25] seek god and pray that he'll even make
[2:26:27] his enemies
[2:26:28] your enemies and he had the testimony
[2:26:32] with them
[2:26:34] and they're asking you know how did how

[2:27:59] examples in the bible and just personal
[2:28:01] testimonies of god answering prayer

[2:28:10] of prayer to get his
[2:28:12] will accomplished and i'll just say this
[2:28:14] in the aspect of
[2:28:15] you mothers and fathers
