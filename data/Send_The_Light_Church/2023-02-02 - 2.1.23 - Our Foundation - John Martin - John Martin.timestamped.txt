[0:01] Jesus [music and singing]
[0:03] is here. God bless you.
[0:06] Jesus is here.
[0:09] Jesus is here. [singing and music]
[0:13] All things are possible.
[0:17] Jesus
[0:18] is here. [music]
[0:21] Amen. By faith, we believe that.
[0:24] Amen.
[0:26] That means we don't we don't have to
[0:27] feel it. Amen.
[0:29] Um, we didn't have to get any special
[0:33] direction on the on the way here. No
[0:36] dreams.
[0:37] Amen.
[0:37] We just know he's here because his word
[0:41] declares that he will be here.
[0:43] Just two or three are gathered in his
[0:46] name. And
[0:47] we should never get discouraged.
[0:49] Amen.
[0:49] If there's two of us,
[0:50] Amen.
[0:51] He's here.
[0:52] Amen.
[0:52] And he's here just for us.
[0:55] Amen. Well, praise the Lord. We
[0:57] certainly appreciated that testimony
[0:59] that brother Mark gave. I didn't know
[1:01] that. Uh just to think the joy of the
[1:05] Lord returning after
[1:08] four months.
[1:09] I that that is a beautiful testimony
[1:14] that
[1:16] God's joy is still here for his
[1:18] children.
[1:20] And I'm sure there's others that need
[1:22] the joy of the Lord. And that's what I
[1:25] like about that testimony is that if
[1:27] brother Mark could have it, I could have
[1:28] it.
[1:29] Amen.
[1:29] Amen.
[1:30] And uh we just need more testimonies.
[1:34] More testimonies. Amen. Also, uh brother
[1:37] Joseph, Dad Jack Ben uh Bambi
[1:43] uh wanted to send his greetings to all
[1:46] of us. One day we'll get to meet him,
[1:48] but he's very
[1:51] uh
[1:52] loves his son, very proud of his son,
[1:55] wants to make sure that uh his son is
[1:59] well taken care of. Amen. He said he's
[2:02] he's amongst some beautiful brothers and
[2:04] sisters. You know, brother Brandham did
[2:06] say this. He says that the beauty of the
[2:09] Lord is the character of his people.
[2:12] Amen. And that's that's the one beauty
[2:15] that we want to have in our church. And
[2:18] uh I talked to brother Daryl and brother
[2:20] Daryl wanted to uh let us know that his
[2:24] wife is doing better.
[2:26] And uh so thank you for all your
[2:28] prayers. I know some of you have been
[2:29] praying for her. Amen. Turn with me if
[2:32] you would to the book of uh second
[2:35] Timothy.
[2:38] Um
[2:40] often, um,
[2:44] Brother Ferguson leads, uh, a lot of our
[2:47] our our men's meetings now with some
[2:50] some good Bible studies. And we were
[2:54] just sitting there listening to him and
[2:57] as he was speaking the same scriptures
[3:01] that we are going to be reading at least
[3:04] one of them and it was just good to hear
[3:07] that. Second Timothy chapter 2 verse 19.
[3:11] We're just going to read one verse verse
[3:13] 19 and maybe go back and read the others
[3:16] if we have time. Um verse 19 reads,
[3:21] "Nevertheless, the foundation of God
[3:23] standeth sure having this seal. The Lord
[3:25] knoweth them that are his, and let every
[3:28] one that nameth the name of Christ,
[3:30] depart from iniquity." Amen. Let's bow
[3:33] in a word of prayer and look to the
[3:35] author of this book. Heavenly Father,
[3:37] Lord, you've given us all the ability to
[3:39] be able to read the word, but Lord,
[3:42] unless you come and quicken it to us,
[3:44] Lord, we know that it'll come short in
[3:47] our lives of all that you'd have for us.
[3:50] We ask today, Lord, that you'd take the
[3:51] bread of life and break it to each of
[3:53] us.
[3:55] give us a heart to uh receive
[3:59] and to to take this engrafted word into
[4:04] our lives that it may our lives may
[4:07] become better and more pleasing. Lord,
[4:09] we thank you for this day that you've
[4:12] given us and this opportunity, Lord, as
[4:14] it's been said to be here in your house.
[4:17] We thank you for the desire you placed
[4:19] in our heart to be here. We thank you
[4:21] for the saints that you've given
[4:23] strength to be here. We also pray that
[4:25] you'd be with those Lord that are unable
[4:28] to be here, but Lord are uh watching in
[4:31] at this moment. Just pray a special
[4:34] blessing upon them and those Lord that
[4:37] would be watching. Father, we just
[4:39] commit the service now to you and ask
[4:41] you to just move in our lives and meet
[4:43] the needs that we would have for your
[4:45] honor and glory. We pray in Jesus
[4:47] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[4:50] you. You may be seated.
[4:53] We'd like to talk about our foundation.
[4:57] Our foundation.
[4:59] But um we might think of our foundation
[5:02] as the time that we gave our heart to
[5:04] God and that's where it all started. He
[5:07] dealt with us and we yielded our vessel.
[5:12] We repented and that was the beginning.
[5:14] That was our foundation. And in one
[5:17] sense that is absolutely correct. Uh uh
[5:23] but I really want us to look at our
[5:27] foundation in core in in connection with
[5:29] God's foundation.
[5:30] Amen.
[5:31] Today
[5:33] that God has a foundation as as we had
[5:36] read here in the scriptures. The Bible
[5:39] says nevertheless the foundation of God
[5:41] standeth sure. Having this seal, the
[5:45] Lord knoweth them that are his. Notice
[5:49] the foundation is tied with a seal
[5:55] that the Lord knows them that are his.
[5:58] Amen.
[5:59] Yes, sir.
[6:00] Sealed by an omnisient God, an all-
[6:03] knowing God who knows each and every one
[6:07] of his sons and daughters.
[6:08] Amen. Yes, sir. The all- knowing God has
[6:11] an infinite awareness and understanding
[6:14] and insight.
[6:16] I believe the book of Hebrews tells us
[6:18] that all things are naked and open
[6:20] before him. He He just knows everything,
[6:23] sees everything.
[6:24] Amen. Yes, sir. Revelations 13:8 says,
[6:27] "And all that dwell upon the earth,
[6:30] shall worship the beast, whose names are
[6:33] not written in the book of the lamb,
[6:36] slain from the foundation of the world."
[6:41] Amen. It's true. Amen.
[6:42] So there is a group of people,
[6:46] the majority of the people are going to
[6:48] worship the beast,
[6:50] right? It's true. But there is a very
[6:53] small group who will not worship the
[6:55] beast
[6:57] and and a book uh the lamb's book of
[7:00] life was written with their names in
[7:02] them. They cannot be deceived.
[7:05] So God made a plan right from the
[7:07] beginning. He would allow man to fall in
[7:11] sin, wander in the wilderness as it
[7:13] were, not even knowing really who he is
[7:17] or who God is until God would knock on
[7:20] their heart and God would speak to him
[7:22] and reveal himself. And those who are
[7:26] predestinated, who God predestinated, he
[7:30] wrote their names in the lamb's book of
[7:32] life.
[7:32] Amen. Yes, sir.
[7:34] He had already provided a sacrifice for
[7:38] them to be able to come back to him.
[7:41] Just imagine um
[7:45] you know when babies are born,
[7:49] they really don't know exactly who mom
[7:52] and dad is.
[7:53] Right. It's true.
[7:55] Right. I mean, you walk up to him and I
[7:58] remember brother Bill Bailey used to
[7:59] tell the story that he would go and he'd
[8:01] put his hand by uh uh one of his
[8:06] children when they were born and and and
[8:08] they would just he would just they would
[8:09] just grab a hold of his thumb and his
[8:11] finger.
[8:13] But he would the baby would just be
[8:14] grabbing around anybody's thumb or
[8:17] finger that that that reflex. Do you
[8:19] understand what I'm saying? So
[8:22] even though we were predestinated, we
[8:25] still didn't know God.
[8:26] We had to come through that process of
[8:29] getting to know who God really is.
[8:32] And so Romans 8:29 tells us from whom he
[8:36] did forno,
[8:37] he also did predestinate.
[8:41] So remember it's they got that seal on
[8:43] now. And the Lord knoweth them that are
[8:45] his, for whom he did forno.
[8:48] He also did predestinate to be conformed
[8:52] to the same image, the image of his son,
[8:54] that he might be the firstborn among
[8:57] many brethren. So he's has an
[8:58] expectation that his other sons and
[9:00] daughters are going to be just like
[9:02] Jesus Christ. Moreover, whom he did
[9:04] predestinate, them he also called, and
[9:07] whom he called, them he justified, and
[9:09] whom he justified, he them he also
[9:13] glorified. So just notice that this
[9:15] foundation now is steadfast and sure.
[9:21] Ephesians 1 vers4 tells us he have
[9:25] chosen us in him before the foundation
[9:29] of the world.
[9:31] So he chose us in him before the
[9:35] foundation of the world. But it wasn't
[9:38] really uh after we were born,
[9:43] a after we started coming to church,
[9:45] after we started doing better, after we
[9:48] met a certain criteria.
[9:50] No, he chose us from before there was
[9:53] anything.
[9:55] Praise God. Amen.
[9:56] That is amazing to me. Amongst all the
[10:00] millions of people that he did not
[10:02] choose, he chose us. And it was so long
[10:06] ago that it didn't really have anything
[10:08] to do with our ups and downs.
[10:10] Amen.
[10:11] It had to do with the choice he made.
[10:15] And I'm so thankful that that foundation
[10:17] of God's tennis sure today
[10:20] is that the things that are going to be
[10:21] happening to us and they're going to try
[10:23] to ruffle our feathers and we've got to
[10:25] stand firm on the word of God.
[10:28] Amen.
[10:32] God set some parameters. He laid the
[10:34] foundation for what he was going to
[10:35] build. And he's in the process today of
[10:38] building his church. That's what the
[10:41] foundation was for, right? It was to
[10:43] build something on top. That's why you
[10:46] lay a foundation.
[10:47] Amen. That's right.
[10:48] And and he's he's building a church
[10:51] today without spot or without wrinkle.
[10:54] Amen. Yes, sir.
[10:55] And the Bible tells us that nothing can
[10:58] move God's foundation. It stands sure.
[11:01] Nothing can move it. That means when you
[11:03] build upon the foundation, it will not
[11:06] move.
[11:06] That's right. Amen.
[11:08] Right.
[11:08] Amen.
[11:10] He said Jesus said the gates of hell
[11:12] cannot prevail against it. No matter how
[11:15] much Satan would try to come at us, if
[11:17] we're if we're standing on the
[11:19] foundation, right? And and and if we
[11:22] have a revelation that God's word is the
[11:24] final amen and you stand upon it no
[11:27] matter what's happening in your life
[11:29] that that that the gates of hell will
[11:32] not prevail against you.
[11:33] Amen.
[11:34] Now the problem is that often we don't
[11:37] have a rock solid revelation. We have an
[11:40] intellectual understanding and we we're
[11:42] faithful to the word and then we get off
[11:45] the word and we become unfaithful to the
[11:48] word and we're then we're on and then
[11:50] we're off and before you know it we're
[11:52] just shaken like the wind. But that is
[11:55] not the way that God's bride is. Amen.
[11:58] That God's bride is solid on the word,
[12:01] solid on the foundation. Once they get
[12:04] there, they stay there.
[12:06] Amen. Amen.
[12:09] I'm talking to the bride today. Amen.
[12:11] Yes, sir. Amen.
[12:12] Jesus Christ is the foundation.
[12:15] Yes.
[12:16] He's He's the capstone as well.
[12:19] Amen.
[12:20] He's the chief cornerstone.
[12:21] Amen. Yes, sir.
[12:22] He's the beginning. He's the end. He's
[12:24] the alpha and he's the omega.
[12:26] Yes, sir.
[12:27] Christ is the word and the word has
[12:30] already been spoken. Referring to the
[12:33] foundation. Now, it's already been
[12:35] spoken. And that word, as brother
[12:38] Ferguson said, uh, in our men's meeting,
[12:42] it will not return void. Amen. It will
[12:46] not return empty. It will not, uh, come
[12:48] up different than what he's spoken. His
[12:51] word is forever settled in heaven. Jesus
[12:54] said, "Heaven and earth will pass away,
[12:56] but my word shall never pass away."
[13:00] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[13:04] God has spoken his word. The foundation
[13:07] has been laid and now he's building on
[13:10] top of his foundation. We are the
[13:13] building.
[13:14] Amen.
[13:14] We are the building. 1 Corinthians
[13:16] chapter 3:9.
[13:19] We are the building.
[13:22] It's exciting.
[13:23] Amen. Yes, it is.
[13:26] 1 Corinthians chapter 3:9. For we are
[13:29] laborers together with God.
[13:33] Ye are God's husbandry. Ye are God's
[13:37] building.
[13:40] According to the grace of God which is
[13:42] given unto me as a wise master build. I
[13:44] have laid the foundation and another
[13:47] buildeth thereon. But let every man take
[13:50] heed how he buildth thereon. So this
[13:52] really this service is about how we're
[13:55] how we're building. I mean, are we
[13:57] building on God's foundation? Are we
[14:00] joined with God's foundation? Or are we
[14:02] off doing our own thing?
[14:04] For other foundation can no man lay than
[14:08] that is I say it is already laid which
[14:13] is Jesus Christ.
[14:14] Amen.
[14:16] So here here here Paul is saying I have
[14:20] laid the foundation and another build on
[14:24] and then he says there's no other
[14:25] foundation that can be laid which is
[14:28] Jesus Christ.
[14:29] Right?
[14:30] So if we were going to build a building
[14:33] and we over here we got some blocks on
[14:36] that wall. [clears throat] Before you
[14:38] can lay a block that's 4 foot off the
[14:42] ground, you've got to lay the block
[14:44] that's on the bottom, right? You start
[14:46] at the bottom. The foundation is is dug
[14:49] out. You pour the concrete and you start
[14:51] laying a block and that block uh that
[14:56] bottom row is now uh gives way for the
[15:00] next row to be put on and then the next
[15:02] row. So, so our the we build upon the
[15:07] foundation that God has already laid,
[15:11] right? Amen.
[15:12] And uh we understand that that Paul
[15:15] wrote 14 books in the Bible and he spoke
[15:19] things, but we must understand that what
[15:21] Paul spoke was exactly God's word.
[15:27] So, so the scriptures don't countd one
[15:30] another at all. They're not confusing.
[15:33] They're just they're just relaying that
[15:35] that uh God used Paul. God moved on men
[15:41] of old as they were they were moved on
[15:43] by the Holy Ghost and they spoke the
[15:45] word of God and that become our
[15:48] foundation in which our life is based
[15:50] on. You know, if we can just get back to
[15:53] the word.
[15:54] Amen. get back to the word and get away
[15:57] from this this personal private you know
[16:00] God is speaking to me about all these
[16:02] other things that stuff I don't mean it
[16:05] wrong but we capitalize on all that
[16:09] stuff and we put less emphasis on the
[16:11] word and and and and that stuff we don't
[16:14] know until God brings it to pass but the
[16:17] word now has already been written we
[16:20] don't need an interpretation of that
[16:22] right
[16:23] the prophet has come and given us
[16:25] interpretation. We the word is yay and
[16:28] amen and that's what we should be
[16:30] building our life on is on this and not
[16:32] well because here's how so many people
[16:35] get tripped up
[16:36] right
[16:37] is on this personal this is what I feel
[16:39] God wants me to do
[16:43] and we you know and here the Bible says
[16:45] they that are sons of God led by the
[16:47] spirit of God and and and and this is
[16:50] what I God wants me to do and I'm going
[16:51] to go do it and and and we get off of
[16:54] the foundation and we don't realize that
[16:57] if it was truly God that was leading us,
[17:00] it wouldn't stop, it wouldn't interfere
[17:03] us from keeping the word.
[17:07] All of a sudden, people uh lay out a
[17:11] church
[17:14] and they're supposedly
[17:17] doing the will of God,
[17:20] but God is not going to lead you to do
[17:22] something to make you unfaithful doing
[17:24] something else. That is not God. God
[17:27] cannot be in that no matter what you
[17:29] say.
[17:32] And this is why I'm saying I'm okay with
[17:34] everything that God tells us to do. I'm
[17:36] okay with it. But don't get away from
[17:38] the word. Stay on the right foundation
[17:42] because this is the thing that stands
[17:44] sure.
[17:45] Yes, sir.
[17:46] God knoweth them that are his.
[17:49] Amen.
[17:52] All right. For other foundations can no
[17:55] man lay than that which is laid, which
[17:57] is Jesus Christ. Now, if any man build
[18:01] upon this foundation,
[18:04] speaking of
[18:07] natural things here, gold, silver,
[18:09] precious stone, wood, hay, stubble. Now,
[18:13] we got some that'll burn and some that
[18:15] won't burn, right?
[18:17] [snorts]
[18:17] Every man's work shall be made manifest,
[18:21] for the day shall declare it, because it
[18:24] shall be revealed by fire, and fire
[18:28] shall try every man's work of what sort
[18:31] it is.
[18:33] Notice that every man's work. God tried
[18:36] the children of Israel,
[18:39] right? Amen.
[18:40] Right.
[18:42] To see what kind of work it was,
[18:44] right?
[18:45] And each time
[18:49] they failed to stay faithful with what
[18:51] God told them to do, right?
[18:55] Yet their testimony was that God was
[18:57] with them. The pillar of fire was there.
[18:59] Their shoes didn't wear out. The cloud
[19:01] was there. They all ate the same
[19:03] spiritual meat. They all drank the same
[19:05] spiritual drink, which was Christ.
[19:08] And they their testimony was that God
[19:10] was with him. But the word of God said
[19:13] that they couldn't enter in because of
[19:15] unbelief.
[19:16] Amen. That's right.
[19:19] And the unbelief was shown because they
[19:22] weren't faithful to what God told them
[19:24] to do.
[19:25] Right.
[19:25] And the word tried them.
[19:31] It was revealed by fire. And the fire is
[19:33] the test we go through. The things that
[19:35] that that come into our lives that that
[19:38] we use as excuses that keep us out
[19:40] [screaming] of church. Yes.
[19:44] God's bride is going to stay faithful no
[19:47] matter what.
[19:48] No matter what. Everybody is not going
[19:51] to be a job.
[19:54] Everybody's not going to be an Enoch.
[19:56] True.
[19:58] I mean, we've got to line up to the word
[20:01] and not just, you know, try to get
[20:03] everything to line up to us.
[20:05] Amen. Amen.
[20:06] We got to line up to the word.
[20:08] Amen. Right.
[20:10] Verse 14. If any man's work abide which
[20:14] he had built thereupon,
[20:17] he shall receive a reward.
[20:21] If any man's work shall be burned, he
[20:24] shall suffer loss, but he himself shall
[20:26] be saved, yet so as by fire.
[20:31] So, we see here that if we're not
[20:33] building on the right foundation,
[20:36] it's just not going to work out.
[20:38] Amen.
[20:42] We are God's building and we've got to
[20:45] build on the right foundation.
[20:48] Amen. Yes, sir.
[20:49] And we've got to be building what he
[20:52] tells us to do. Amen.
[20:55] And we don't we don't need to wait to
[20:58] hear something personal about our
[21:02] personal lives.
[21:04] Amen.
[21:05] All we need to do is hear God speak to
[21:08] us from the word of God.
[21:13] Because it, you know, it wouldn't matter
[21:15] honestly if God spoke to all of us
[21:19] everything that's going to happen next
[21:20] week,
[21:21] right?
[21:22] And next month in our life, who we're
[21:24] going to speak to, where we're going to
[21:26] end up, who's going to offer us
[21:28] something to eat, the whole nine yards,
[21:30] right?
[21:31] That we could just say it the way it is.
[21:34] And it happened week after week after
[21:36] week. That would not matter one thing.
[21:40] We still got to build our lives on the
[21:43] foundation of the word.
[21:48] Amen.
[21:49] And there's not enough emphasis being
[21:50] put in our lives about the word of God.
[21:54] Amen.
[21:54] We've got to stay with the word.
[21:56] Amen.
[21:59] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 19.
[22:02] So we are God's building, right? That's
[22:06] what we just read. Now ver verse 19
[22:09] says, "Now therefore, you're no more
[22:12] strangers and foreigners,
[22:14] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[22:18] the and of the household of God." We're
[22:21] a family. There's one thing I really
[22:23] love about uh brother Mark when he's up
[22:26] here. He's talking about the unity. A
[22:29] family needs unity.
[22:32] God's house needs unity. I believe that
[22:35] there's too much individualities there.
[22:38] Too much uh too much place for isms and
[22:41] sisms and things like that to be respect
[22:44] of persons.
[22:46] We are of the household of God. Amen.
[22:50] And are built upon the foundation of the
[22:55] apostles and the prophets where Jesus
[22:58] Christ himself being the chief
[23:00] cornerstone.
[23:02] That's what we're built upon. In whom
[23:04] the whole in whom all the building fitly
[23:10] framed together
[23:13] groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord,
[23:17] in whom ye also are builded together for
[23:20] a habitation through the spirit. Now, is
[23:25] this scripture referring to us as
[23:28] individuals or is it referring to us as
[23:32] a body of believers?
[23:35] Amen.
[23:37] What was the one thing that the prophet
[23:39] I'll tell you when I first started
[23:40] listening to the prophet, you know, why
[23:42] is he against the denominations? Why why
[23:44] is it so he's against all the
[23:46] denominations? He wasn't against the
[23:49] people,
[23:49] but he was against the system that
[23:51] separated the people. And just because
[23:53] we're not just because we're in a
[23:55] message church, it doesn't mean we don't
[23:58] can't get that same spirit upon us.
[24:00] Right. It's true.
[24:02] God hates anything that separates
[24:05] brotherhood.
[24:06] Amen.
[24:06] Right.
[24:07] Seven things God hates or six things God
[24:10] hates. The seventh is an abomination. He
[24:12] that sweth discord.
[24:14] Amen. That's right.
[24:17] We got to stand on the right foundation.
[24:20] Not about proving who's right and who's
[24:21] wrong. Amen.
[24:24] So in this building process with God,
[24:27] the devil will present many
[24:29] opportunities to build our ideas or our
[24:34] will, our desire, our goals on God's
[24:37] foundation. Notice we become a
[24:40] Christian. We're going to say, "I'm not
[24:42] just going to repent, be baptized, uh,
[24:45] but take this message and and and and
[24:47] start dressing right and start acting
[24:50] right and and and reading the message
[24:52] and and starting to do things." Now,
[24:54] what's going to happen is the devil is
[24:58] going to present to us uh opportunities
[25:02] to start building our own ideas and what
[25:06] we want to do on the foundation,
[25:09] right?
[25:11] And that's where he makes it look like
[25:13] it's so
[25:15] like it's going to work,
[25:17] right? I'm still going to go to church.
[25:19] I'm still going to read. I'm still going
[25:20] to but I'm going to do my will.
[25:24] Very dangerous.
[25:26] It won't stand.
[25:27] Amen.
[25:28] It'll either be shaken or it'll be
[25:30] burnt.
[25:30] Amen. It's true.
[25:32] Jesus calls this type of thinking
[25:36] sinking sand, right? A sand foundation.
[25:38] Amen.
[25:39] And if the devil can get us to get off
[25:42] of God's foundation,
[25:46] then he'll present to us an idea to
[25:49] build upon God's foundation.
[25:53] So, we know that the the the devil's
[25:57] first goal is to try to get us away from
[26:01] God, get us away from church, get us
[26:03] away from the right foundation. That's
[26:05] right. just to, you know, many start in
[26:08] the race but they don't finish. Now, if
[26:10] he can't get us to just get away
[26:12] because, you know, we just know that
[26:14] that's wrong, right?
[26:16] Then he'll try us to he'll try to get us
[26:18] to build our ideas
[26:21] upon upon God. Use the word of God for
[26:25] to get what you want, right? He said he
[26:27] give you the desires of your heart and
[26:29] before you know it, everything that
[26:31] you're planning, it's you planning it.
[26:36] And then things don't happen and then
[26:38] you start blaming God and where is God?
[26:40] This isn't right. This ain't fair. This
[26:42] shouldn't be happening.
[26:45] Because we allow the devil's temptation
[26:49] to get us to get our wants upon the
[26:52] foundation. And the foundation is God's
[26:55] wants.
[26:57] Amen.
[26:57] Amen.
[26:59] Matthew chapter 7 verse 21. We've read
[27:01] this many times.
[27:04] Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
[27:06] Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven,
[27:08] but he that doeth the will of my father
[27:09] which is in heaven. So we see the
[27:11] foundation here is the will of the
[27:15] father.
[27:16] It's not our will because not everybody
[27:19] that's saying Lord Lord is entering in,
[27:21] right? It's not the professors that make
[27:24] it. It's the doers of God's will right
[27:27] here.
[27:28] Amen.
[27:29] The doers of God's will. And there's so
[27:31] I'll tell you there's a lot.
[27:33] Yes.
[27:34] Like um if you were to come to our to
[27:37] our shop, there is a lot of
[27:41] responsibilities there. A lot of things
[27:43] that are accomplished there. There's
[27:45] there's a lot of things that you you
[27:48] have to learn to do and there are things
[27:50] that you cannot do that is not allowed
[27:53] there. I mean there's just a lot of
[27:55] stuff.
[27:58] Well, God's word is a lot of stuff.
[28:02] And it it's not just, you know, coming
[28:05] to church or or dressing right or
[28:07] praying your tithes.
[28:09] It's about how you think.
[28:10] Amen.
[28:11] How you talk, what you say, what is your
[28:14] motive behind what you're doing. There
[28:16] is so much to God's will
[28:19] that not all that say Lord, Lord, are
[28:21] going to enter in. Verse 22 says, "Many
[28:24] will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
[28:28] have we not prophesied thy name and thy
[28:30] name cast out devils and thy name done
[28:32] many wonderful works?" So we see here
[28:36] doing just a part of God's will is not
[28:39] good enough.
[28:40] Amen. That's right.
[28:43] And this is scary because we all can
[28:46] testify, I do a part of God's will.
[28:51] But to be honest,
[28:54] am I am I striving to do all of God's
[28:57] will, or am I just saying, "This is the
[28:59] most important thing right now. I got my
[29:00] other stuff going."
[29:05] Jesus calls these believers
[29:08] laborers that also work iniquity. Right?
[29:13] They're they're they're they're
[29:15] believers. They're laborers. They're
[29:17] laborers for the kingdom of God. But
[29:19] they also have a work of iniquity. Now,
[29:22] what is that? That's that they have
[29:24] certain things in their life that they
[29:27] know God wants them to do, but they're
[29:30] not doing it.
[29:31] Right?
[29:32] So, it's kind of mixed together, right?
[29:35] And then I will profess to them, I never
[29:37] knew you. Depart from me, ye that work
[29:39] iniquity. So, the foundation of God's
[29:41] stand sure this year. The Lord knoweth
[29:44] them that are his. Amen.
[29:47] And let everyone that nameth the name of
[29:49] Christ depart from iniquity. So this
[29:51] relationship that that God is building
[29:54] his church today uh which he's building
[29:57] us is upon a relationship. It's a
[30:00] relationship in which we are trying to
[30:03] please God in every aspect that he's
[30:06] wanting us to do.
[30:07] Amen. Yes sir. and not just, you know,
[30:10] always professing, professing,
[30:12] professing on bride on bride on bride
[30:14] and we're not even interested in in
[30:16] taking care of the things that we're not
[30:18] doing
[30:18] right.
[30:23] The bride isn't trying some to pull some
[30:27] fast one on God.
[30:31] Obviously, these believers were
[30:35] there's going to be many. Jesus said,
[30:37] "Many will say to me," I'm not really
[30:41] referring to the many that are in this
[30:43] church. There's not very many people in
[30:44] this church.
[30:46] But when when you talk about professing
[30:48] believers out there, there interested in
[30:52] relationships, they're interested in
[30:53] this and that, and there's no interest
[30:56] in becoming the word.
[30:59] There's no interest in it. it that they
[31:02] they only want to become the part they
[31:04] want to become. But there's but they
[31:06] they don't mind professing it outwardly.
[31:09] But I believe that the bride is making
[31:12] herself ready.
[31:13] Amen.
[31:13] Yes.
[31:14] She is building her life, [screaming]
[31:17] her church on the foundation, which is
[31:19] the word of God.
[31:23] God knows who that bride is.
[31:26] Yes.
[31:27] She knew. He knew from the foundation
[31:29] the world.
[31:30] I believe she is separating from
[31:34] everything that cannot be built on the
[31:36] foundation.
[31:39] And we all got it.
[31:41] It just who's who's interested,
[31:44] you know, who's interested in getting
[31:46] back to the building, getting back to
[31:48] the foundation, the right foundation in
[31:50] which we started. Remember when we
[31:52] started, we repented from our sins.
[31:56] I'm going to serve you, Lord. I'm going
[31:58] to follow you. And then as soon as we're
[32:02] out and we got these tests and trials
[32:05] that we begin to make all these excuses
[32:07] of why we can't be faithful to the word
[32:09] of God,
[32:14] God would never put anything on us that
[32:16] we couldn't bear.
[32:16] That's right.
[32:18] But with
[32:20] this tre, this pressure, this trial,
[32:23] this test, he promised to make a way of
[32:27] escape.
[32:28] We serve a God that's not overbearing.
[32:33] If we feel overbeared,
[32:35] it's because we haven't ever came under
[32:38] subjection to his yoke. Because his yoke
[32:41] is easy.
[32:43] His burden is light.
[32:44] Yes, sir. If we're feeling things are
[32:46] too heavy, maybe we're yolked up to the
[32:49] wrong thing.
[32:51] Maybe we got to break oursel from those
[32:53] shackles and just humble ourselves and
[32:55] get right to the word of God. Amen.
[32:57] Amen.
[32:58] All right. Back to Matthew 7:4.
[33:00] Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[33:03] sayings of mine
[33:06] and doeth them, I will liken him unto a
[33:10] wise man which built his house upon a
[33:14] rock. You know, we have a uh
[33:19] a foundation company here in Fenton
[33:22] called Rock Foundation.
[33:28] so strong that the rain descended, the
[33:31] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[33:33] upon that house and it fell not for it
[33:37] was founded upon a rock.
[33:41] This is what I'm saying. I'm okay with
[33:43] anything that you got going in your
[33:45] life. You can't show it to me in the
[33:47] word. I I just say amen to it. The thing
[33:50] is we need to get back to the word
[33:53] because we know that we know that we we
[33:55] know that that will stand.
[33:58] That will stand if you and there's so
[34:01] many things here that we need to be
[34:03] doing. Why are we so interested in all
[34:05] the other things,
[34:05] right? It's true.
[34:07] Why? Why?
[34:12] We ought to be saving souls.
[34:14] Amen.
[34:14] Amen.
[34:15] We ought to be about the father's
[34:17] business.
[34:22] We're we're making things different than
[34:25] what the foundation was laid for.
[34:32] And everyone that heareth these sayings
[34:35] of mine, and doeth them not shall be
[34:39] likened unto a foolish man, which built
[34:42] his house upon the sand. and the rains
[34:46] descend, the floods came, the winds blew
[34:48] and beat upon the house, and it fell,
[34:50] and great was the fall of it.
[34:55] How many times, now notice, these are
[34:58] believers.
[34:59] These are believers
[35:02] who went to church and heard the word
[35:05] but decided
[35:07] not to get serious with the word.
[35:09] True.
[35:09] That's who these people were,
[35:11] right?
[35:13] They wanted to build their Christianity
[35:16] or their relationship with God on their
[35:19] own ideas. Right?
[35:23] Now, here's the thing.
[35:25] How many times does the devil come
[35:29] and tell us something
[35:32] as if it is God speaking to us?
[35:37] I mean, even when he appeared to to
[35:39] Martin,
[35:40] right,
[35:41] St. Martin, don't you know who I am of
[35:43] Jesus? Bow down in words. I think the
[35:46] devil comes to us a lot.
[35:49] He sits on the throne as if he's God,
[35:53] and we don't recognize him. We don't
[35:55] call him out,
[35:57] right?
[35:58] Because he appeals to our flesh. When
[36:01] when Jesus was talking to the devil, he
[36:04] says, "Thou
[36:05] um you you you you speak the things that
[36:10] appeal to the flesh." And I'm so I'm
[36:13] going to have to read it now because I
[36:14] butchered that one too much. Matthew 16.
[36:17] [laughter]
[36:18] Don't like butchering the scriptures.
[36:20] Amen. Verse 23, he says, "And he turned
[36:24] and he said unto Peter, get thee behind
[36:26] me, Satan, for thou an offense unto me,
[36:29] for thou savorest not the things that be
[36:32] of God, but the those that be of men."
[36:34] So Satan, when he comes to us, he he
[36:37] wants to speak those things that that
[36:39] savor us, that that make us feel good,
[36:43] that give us what we want. He wants us
[36:46] to want things,
[36:47] right?
[36:48] Satan wants us to want things. Wow.
[36:51] True.
[36:53] But the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not
[36:55] want. And and and this is the greatest
[36:58] battle that we're in. And I believe that
[37:01] we just need to get back to to the altar
[37:04] to where it's nothing but this word.
[37:07] Nothing but the word. That's all I want.
[37:09] Amen. Yes, sir. Amen.
[37:10] And not just making church a part of our
[37:13] lives.
[37:13] Right.
[37:13] Right.
[37:14] Just coming because it's Wednesday or
[37:16] just becoming because it's Sunday. We
[37:18] need to get back to the word and and
[37:21] start building our lives on the right
[37:22] foundation.
[37:23] Yes, sir.
[37:25] All right. Hebrews 12 verse 26. Hebrews
[37:29] 12 26. Nothing will remain that isn't
[37:34] built upon God's foundation.
[37:40] If it's not on God's if it's not on the
[37:42] right foundation,
[37:46] I'm saying you you're going to go ahead
[37:49] instead of putting a block there, you're
[37:51] going to put a a a a cloth there. Well,
[37:55] what's that going to do? Everything that
[37:57] you build on top of that, you you put
[38:01] some cardboard there and it'll hold the
[38:03] block up for a little bit,
[38:05] right?
[38:05] But eventually it's going to cave in and
[38:09] Your building is going to be
[38:10] deteriorated.
[38:12] Hebrews 12:26, whose voice then shook
[38:16] the earth, but now he have promised,
[38:19] saying, yet once more I shake not the
[38:23] earth only, but also heaven. Now God, he
[38:28] created heaven. That's where God is at.
[38:30] Why is he shaking heaven?
[38:33] Hm. And this word yet once more
[38:37] signifying the removing of those things
[38:40] that can be shaken
[38:43] as of the things that are made
[38:47] and those things which cannot be shaken
[38:50] that the things that those things which
[38:52] cannot be shaken may remain.
[38:56] Well, it's it's so easy. It's so easy
[39:00] because
[39:02] what God has spoken will remain.
[39:06] Amen.
[39:07] And what we have spoken will not remain.
[39:11] Right?
[39:12] Now, if we speak God's word, it will
[39:15] remain.
[39:17] Because that's all the apostles did that
[39:19] they built on the foundation. God gave
[39:21] them the word, they spoke it, and if we
[39:25] follow it, we're on the right
[39:26] foundation.
[39:27] Yes, sir. Amen.
[39:29] Now, if we don't try the spirits that
[39:31] come to us and we just start, well, I
[39:34] don't need to do this and I don't need
[39:36] to do that and that ain't very important
[39:38] and this is then before you know it, our
[39:41] life will be shaken.
[39:45] Something's going to happen to shake us
[39:48] because God has promised a shaking.
[39:53] Wherefore receiving Wherefore we
[39:56] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[40:00] moved,
[40:02] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[40:04] God acceptably
[40:07] and I say acceptably with reverence and
[40:12] godly fear. For our God is a consuming
[40:14] fire. You know, that's the only way to
[40:16] really serve God.
[40:17] Amen.
[40:18] You really can't stick your finger or
[40:20] your nose up or your your, you know,
[40:22] look down on somebody or act like you're
[40:25] something. That is not serving God
[40:27] acceptably with reverence or godly fear.
[40:30] For our God is a consuming fire. Now, if
[40:34] you've received a kingdom that cannot be
[40:36] removed, then you receive this word.
[40:39] Amen.
[40:44] Did you know that I had received a word
[40:47] from God that we were going to have
[40:49] trusted tool?
[40:51] There's a word from God.
[40:53] But did you know trusted tool is going
[40:56] to burn?
[40:59] It's going to burn.
[41:03] It's a temporary thing. It's going to
[41:06] burn.
[41:07] This word is not going to burn.
[41:10] [laughter]
[41:10] Yes, sir.
[41:12] Our it's a burning word is a our God's a
[41:14] consuming fire.
[41:16] Amen.
[41:17] But every brother and sister in Christ
[41:20] will have to come through the blood.
[41:22] Will have to come through the word.
[41:24] They don't have to come through trusted
[41:26] tool.
[41:27] Right.
[41:27] Right.
[41:28] You understand what I'm saying?
[41:33] You know, I would love for God to come
[41:35] to me every day and tell me what's going
[41:37] to be happening. Right?
[41:39] But you know what?
[41:41] Or or or or or this is what he wants me
[41:43] to do or do, you know, but the thing is
[41:45] I can't hardly keep up with what I got
[41:46] to do now.
[41:50] There's so much word that I'm coming
[41:53] short of.
[41:54] Are you with me?
[41:58] I I we just need to get back to the
[42:01] priority. Amen.
[42:05] Amen.
[42:06] So just because God has given us
[42:09] liberty,
[42:10] it doesn't mean we can do what we want
[42:12] or build whatever we want.
[42:16] True liberty is being set free from the
[42:20] devil and our ungodly selfish nature
[42:25] where we just want to serve oursel to
[42:28] serve Jesus Christ. That's what true
[42:30] liberty is. God has given us that
[42:33] liberty. That's why the Bible says where
[42:34] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[42:36] liberty.
[42:37] So true liberty is not doing what our
[42:40] flesh wants us to do.
[42:42] Amen.
[42:43] When you're pulled and you want to do
[42:45] this and you want to do that, you want
[42:47] to lash out at somebody or you don't
[42:49] want to talk to somebody for a while or
[42:50] or whatever it might be. True liberty is
[42:54] being set free from that.
[42:57] You're you're just a servant to all. You
[42:59] love everybody. That's what's that's
[43:01] what being set free is.
[43:03] Romans chapter 7 verse 19.
[43:07] For the good that I would,
[43:11] I do not. Paul's speaking of this
[43:14] ungodly nature that we have,
[43:18] but the evil which I would not, that I
[43:21] do.
[43:24] I I believe we've all
[43:27] interact with this. We can relate to
[43:30] what Paul's saying here, right?
[43:33] So verse 24, he says, "Oh wretched man
[43:35] that I am, who shall deliver me from the
[43:38] body of this death?
[43:41] Oh wretched man that I am. Who's going
[43:43] to deliver me?" Well, I love the answer
[43:46] here in Romans 8 verse one. There is
[43:49] therefore now no condemnation to them
[43:53] which are in Christ Jesus. Not just the
[43:57] professors now, but those who walk not
[44:00] after the flesh, but after the spirit.
[44:05] See, they've been set free from the
[44:07] flesh.
[44:08] Amen. Amen.
[44:09] They're walking in this. They have no
[44:11] problem living for others. They have no
[44:13] problem looking for souls. They have no
[44:15] problem doing the will of God because
[44:17] they've been set free from themselves.
[44:20] Amen.
[44:20] Yes, sir.
[44:21] For the law of the spirit of life in
[44:24] Christ Jesus have made me free from the
[44:27] law of sin and death.
[44:31] Oh, isn't that beautiful?
[44:35] We've been set free from our carnal
[44:37] nature with his carnal desires. Verse
[44:40] five says, "For they that are after the
[44:42] flesh, they do mind the things of the
[44:44] flesh,
[44:46] but they that are after the spirit, they
[44:48] mind the things of the spirit."
[44:52] You know, many people try to build
[44:55] their church,
[44:57] their their carnal church, their fleshly
[45:00] church on God's foundation.
[45:04] Oh, they'll preach prosperity. Right.
[45:07] Oh, they'll they'll tell you you can
[45:09] have whatever you want
[45:13] that that that God loves you no matter
[45:15] what.
[45:16] [laughter]
[45:17] They try taking
[45:20] their own idea.
[45:23] And build it upon the foundation and you
[45:25] can't do that. It won't stand. Amen.
[45:28] Amen.
[45:31] Now, every time God speaks to us, he
[45:34] expects us to build what he has spoken.
[45:37] Amen.
[45:39] It's like a block. You come to church,
[45:42] he gives you the word. He expects you to
[45:44] take that block and put it on the wall
[45:48] because he's building a building,
[45:50] right?
[45:51] And every time we come, we get some more
[45:54] that he wants us to build. Put in the
[45:57] window. put in the door. Put in Put in
[45:59] the the the rafters. He He's He's
[46:02] wanting us to build. So when he speaks
[46:03] to us,
[46:06] don't say, "I don't have to listen to
[46:08] that."
[46:09] Don't do that.
[46:12] What he wants us to do is lay keep
[46:16] building the building because we are the
[46:18] building.
[46:19] Amen.
[46:21] If we don't, it's just going to be
[46:23] sinking sand for us, right?
[46:25] It behooves us when we come to church to
[46:27] pay attention to every word to be to be
[46:30] ready to hear him speak to our hearts
[46:32] personally.
[46:35] My sheep hear my voice.
[46:38] They know my voice. They they hear my
[46:40] voice. They know my voice. And what do
[46:42] they do? They go lay the blocks. They
[46:45] follow me. They do exactly what I tell
[46:47] them to do. This is the scriptures that
[46:50] from going from one church to another
[46:52] church. [laughter]
[46:54] It's not. It's about building the right
[46:57] building.
[47:00] And if we're not interested in hearing
[47:02] from God,
[47:08] exactly. Exactly.
[47:13] What he's speaking to us is for our
[47:15] good.
[47:16] It's what's going to get us out of here.
[47:18] It's what's going to get us ready for a
[47:20] rapture.
[47:22] Turn with me if you would to James.
[47:25] James chapter 1.
[47:30] Now, too often we look at the word as,
[47:32] well, this isn't real important. This
[47:35] isn't what God's dealing with me. This
[47:37] is not this is not what I've been
[47:39] thinking about. And we put we don't put
[47:42] enough emphasis on the word that's being
[47:44] ministered to us,
[47:45] right?
[47:46] Or the tape we're listening to. Right.
[47:48] Right.
[47:48] I mean there there are so many things
[47:51] that the prophet has said in those tapes
[47:53] and I do not understand why we're not
[47:56] talking about all of them.
[47:59] We we seem to talk about the ones that
[48:02] are interesting to us.
[48:04] But God brought us a complete message.
[48:06] Amen. Amen.
[48:07] He brought us church order.
[48:08] Yes, sir.
[48:09] I think we need to be talking about
[48:10] church order, too.
[48:12] [laughter]
[48:14] There's so much to the message that we
[48:16] need to be following with.
[48:18] All right. James chapter 1 verse 19.
[48:20] Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let
[48:21] every man be swift to hear,
[48:25] slow to speak,
[48:28] slow to wrath.
[48:31] Slow to wrath. Slow but quick to hear.
[48:35] Quick.
[48:36] For the wrath of man workketh not the
[48:40] righteousness of God. So think about
[48:42] that statement when you want to set
[48:44] somebody straight.
[48:48] Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[48:51] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[48:55] with meekness the engrafted word which
[48:58] is able to save your souls. Well, you
[49:01] know to some people are just carnal.
[49:03] Hey, look, you know, I'm already saved,
[49:04] so that scripture doesn't mean nothing
[49:06] to me.
[49:08] You understand? And this is why it's
[49:10] important for us to understand that he
[49:12] that endure to the end, he that keeps
[49:15] building on on to whom much is given,
[49:18] much is required. And so we need to keep
[49:22] taking the engrafted word into our lives
[49:25] and building upon God's foundation, the
[49:28] word that he speaks to us every time we
[49:29] come to church and come to that statue
[49:32] of a perfect man. Verse 22, but he but
[49:36] be ye doers of the word. So there's the
[49:39] message. Be swift to hear.
[49:42] Be a doer of the word and not
[49:46] a hearer only.
[49:49] deceiving your own self. See, a lot of
[49:52] people feel satisfied because they made
[49:53] it to church.
[49:56] They made it to church. I did my duty.
[49:59] They're not paying attention. That the
[50:02] reason that they're coming to church is
[50:03] to get the word that God wants them to
[50:06] do, right? Didn't the prophet say we
[50:08] come to church to find out where we're
[50:10] at with God so we can take that word now
[50:12] and go do it.
[50:15] For if any be a hearer of the word and
[50:18] not a doer,
[50:20] he is like unto a man beholding his
[50:22] natural face in the glass. For he
[50:24] beholdeth himself and goeth his way and
[50:26] straightway he forggetth.
[50:29] What manner of man he was.
[50:33] I wonder why that is. We can come to
[50:35] church. We can hear the word and the
[50:37] word sometimes can convict us, make us
[50:40] feel like, oh man, I I'm not doing that
[50:42] and I feel bad and I I want I want the
[50:45] word to encourage me, but this word
[50:47] isn't encouraging me. And and and we
[50:50] just leave church and we just kind of
[50:51] forget it
[50:53] because we are just so discouraged by
[50:56] the word.
[50:58] That's looking into the word. Looking
[51:01] into the mirror of God's word
[51:05] and it's falling apart.
[51:08] [laughter]
[51:09] Look into the mirror of God's word and
[51:11] say, "Yes, it's true. It's true. I'm not
[51:14] doing it. This is what I should be
[51:16] doing." And walk right out and forget
[51:18] about what you heard at church.
[51:24] The reason that a man will do that is
[51:29] because his heart isn't burning with the
[51:31] love of God.
[51:35] And if you don't get the love
[51:36] relationship back, then God don't know
[51:39] you.
[51:40] Right?
[51:41] No matter what we can say, what we've
[51:43] done, we've got to get rid of the
[51:45] iniquity. And when God speaks something,
[51:47] automatically he expects us to do it. If
[51:49] we don't do what he's telling us to do,
[51:52] it becomes iniquity to us.
[51:58] It's not long after church and things
[52:00] are forgotten.
[52:04] Direction for our life forgotten.
[52:07] Wisdom for our lives forgotten.
[52:11] Leadership for our lives forgotten.
[52:13] Warnings from the Lord forgotten.
[52:17] We've got to come into the house of
[52:19] prayer with a determination to lay
[52:21] everything aside and hear what God's got
[52:24] to say to us.
[52:26] We got to be swift to hear and receive
[52:30] with meekness. The Bible says the
[52:32] engrafted word which is able to help our
[52:34] lives
[52:36] wherever we're at.
[52:38] I don't want to come at the end of the
[52:40] journey
[52:41] and find out, you know what, I should
[52:45] have pushed a little bit harder.
[52:49] I should have given a little bit more. I
[52:53] I should have been more serious about
[52:55] doing God's will instead of my own.
[53:00] Verse 25, but whosoever lookth into the
[53:02] perfect law of liberty,
[53:05] that's the word of God. Now the perfect
[53:08] law of liberty and continue therein.
[53:12] He being not a forgetful hearer, but a
[53:15] doer of the work, this man shall be
[53:17] blessed in his deed.
[53:19] There it is. So God holds the power
[53:24] between blessings and not blessings.
[53:27] Are you with me?
[53:28] Amen.
[53:29] Blessing in the deeds versus not blessed
[53:32] in the deeds.
[53:35] All not it it it goes beyond being a
[53:39] professor and a hearer to to continuing
[53:44] therein. Continue it. So you hear the
[53:47] word and you leave the door and continue
[53:48] in it. You don't continue just to come
[53:51] to church.
[53:53] You take the word that you heard and now
[53:55] you continue in that word. And that is
[53:58] where you're blessed. You're blessed in
[54:00] your deed.
[54:03] not just blessed hear and hearing it.
[54:05] Yeah, we're blessed if we hear it. We're
[54:06] blessed if we read it. But great
[54:09] blessings come if you do it.
[54:13] He He promised that
[54:16] you'd be established if you you take the
[54:19] word, you believe it to the point that
[54:21] you'll do it.
[54:22] Amen.
[54:23] And that you'll prosper.
[54:25] If you if you you come under subjection
[54:29] to the prophets and you believe the
[54:31] prophets.
[54:31] Amen. Yes, sir. Then then there's a
[54:33] greater blessing
[54:35] coming.
[54:38] I should say greater blessing but more
[54:39] of a blessing. You know what I'm trying
[54:42] to say?
[54:46] When God delivers his word, he has
[54:47] expectation that we continue in it.
[54:51] If we're looking to follow his word,
[54:52] we're going to be blessed in our deed.
[54:55] When the word is delivered, we have to
[54:58] be a doer of the work in order to be
[55:00] blessed. Too often we wonder why things
[55:03] are the way they are in our lives.
[55:07] Now
[55:11] I don't have the answer for anybody for
[55:14] anybody's life of why things are the way
[55:16] they are. I don't even have the answer
[55:19] for why things are the way they are in
[55:20] my life. [laughter]
[55:23] So I am not uh in in a in a position to
[55:26] tell anybody why things are the way they
[55:28] are in their life. But I do know this.
[55:31] The word of God cannot lie.
[55:34] And then if we follow the word, God will
[55:37] bless us.
[55:42] We need to look in the perfect law of
[55:45] liberty and follow it. We can't look
[55:48] into the perfect law of liberty and then
[55:50] pretend to be smarter than God.
[55:53] Well, I think I'm going to do this
[55:55] instead.
[55:56] I don't think that's important. and I'm
[55:58] going to do it my way.
[56:03] You know, think about this. Maybe the
[56:06] judgment that will come is maybe just
[56:09] missing out on the needed blessings that
[56:11] we have that we we're looking for. Maybe
[56:14] that's going to be the only judgment.
[56:17] You know, it's not necessarily catastic
[56:21] judgment,
[56:23] but God can withhold his blessings. He
[56:26] withheld the blessings of the promised
[56:28] land to a group of people who 10 times
[56:31] turned God down. Murmured and complained
[56:34] and disbelieved.
[56:37] And God said, "Okay,
[56:40] you had your chance. You're you had your
[56:43] chance in the wilderness." And we all
[56:44] have well, I would say we're all going
[56:47] through wilderness experiences. We're
[56:49] all going through problems and tests and
[56:52] trials and wondering where's God at?
[56:54] what's going to happen and how come he's
[56:57] not helping me and where he's at and
[56:59] we're hearing these messages, you know,
[57:01] uh
[57:03] God wants us to speak to our situation
[57:06] and and believe that he's with us.
[57:09] And and we're we're questioning, we're
[57:10] doubting, we're wondering, we're
[57:12] waiting. We're thinking how things used
[57:14] to be better when God wants us to move
[57:16] forward.
[57:18] Amen.
[57:19] Amen.
[57:23] All right.
[57:26] Verse 26. Starting with our original
[57:27] thought here.
[57:33] Sometimes we say too much, get upset,
[57:37] express the wrong spirits. Verse 26. If
[57:40] any man among you seem to be religious
[57:45] and bridles not his tongue,
[57:49] but deceiveth his own heart, this man's
[57:52] religion is in vain.
[57:56] Now we know if we went to India
[58:02] or Africa or anywhere in the world
[58:06] and they said to us believe in blah blah
[58:10] blah
[58:11] and he will give you blessings.
[58:15] you have to just bow before blah blah
[58:17] blah blah and do this blah blah blah and
[58:20] and we're going to say, you know what,
[58:22] your religion is vain.
[58:25] We're not going to do that.
[58:28] But when somebody seems to be religious,
[58:31] talks about God, knows God,
[58:34] expresses himself as God, but he can't
[58:37] keep his tongue under subjection to the
[58:39] word,
[58:43] then that's no different than blah blah
[58:44] blah.
[58:45] Right?
[58:46] It is no different.
[58:52] Lord, help us. Lord, help us. Help our
[58:55] tongue.
[58:57] We don't want any part of our life to be
[58:59] in vain. That's
[59:00] right.
[59:01] We want to bridle our tongue and
[59:04] manifest true religion. Amen. And we do
[59:06] that by coming under subjection to the
[59:08] word. Verse 27. Pure religion and
[59:11] undefiled before God. Is this to visit
[59:14] the fatherless and the widows and the
[59:17] reflection and to keep them himself
[59:20] unspotted from the world. Do you see how
[59:22] how much how hard that is?
[59:26] I mean th this is a doer. This is not a
[59:28] talker,
[59:30] right? To visit the fatherless and the
[59:33] widows in their affliction and to keep
[59:38] himself unspotted
[59:41] from the world. Now that's I'll tell you
[59:43] that's oh that's so hard to do today
[59:45] with a phone,
[59:47] right?
[59:48] With all the things that are staring
[59:50] before us, all the billboards.
[59:53] I mean, you just all of a sudden get
[59:55] attracted to to something and you know,
[59:58] you got a spot. And you know, we're all
[1:00:01] working very hard to become that bride
[1:00:03] without spot or wrinkle. Amen.
[1:00:06] Amen.
[1:00:06] So, when we heir from part of the truth,
[1:00:09] we're stepping off the foundation.
[1:00:13] When we heir from part of the truth,
[1:00:15] we're stepping off God's foundation.
[1:00:18] And when we step off God's foundation,
[1:00:21] we no longer have a foundation to stand
[1:00:24] upon. We only think we do.
[1:00:28] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:00:32] I give an example. We know the greatest
[1:00:34] commandment is to love the Lord thy God
[1:00:36] with all of our heart, with all of our
[1:00:37] soul, with all of our mind. And Jesus
[1:00:39] told us that the second commandment was
[1:00:41] likened unto the first,
[1:00:43] which was to love your neighbor as
[1:00:46] yourself. Amen.
[1:00:48] And so what do these two things have in
[1:00:50] common? One and two.
[1:00:54] What does commandment one and
[1:00:55] commandment two have perfectly in
[1:00:57] common?
[1:00:59] Love. That's good. I like that. What
[1:01:02] else? Let's go for two. Feel like we're
[1:01:05] playing a game. Who wants to double it?
[1:01:11] You're not your will and your desire
[1:01:16] isn't neither one of those.
[1:01:20] You love God first and you love
[1:01:22] everybody else.
[1:01:26] It is powerful. You're you're not in it.
[1:01:29] And those are the commandments.
[1:01:31] God first, others second.
[1:01:34] He doesn't even say what's third.
[1:01:39] I'm not going to say. All right. James
[1:01:41] chapter 2 verse8. I want to try to
[1:01:44] Wow.
[1:01:46] We're not We We will not get through
[1:01:48] everything just so we know.
[1:01:50] Oh, I don't know about Maybe. I don't
[1:01:52] know. I don't know. Hopefully, you're
[1:01:55] getting a little something out of it.
[1:01:56] Amen.
[1:01:58] All right. James chapter 2 verse 8. If
[1:02:00] you fulfill the royal law according to
[1:02:02] the scriptures, thou shalt love thy
[1:02:04] neighbor as thyself, you do well. Amen.
[1:02:09] No, in order to fulfill this royal law,
[1:02:11] it must be a daily exercise.
[1:02:15] You have to you have to practice it
[1:02:16] daily.
[1:02:18] You can't just, oh, when I go to church,
[1:02:19] I got to make sure I love everybody. I
[1:02:21] got to make sure I got to be on my best
[1:02:22] behavior and love everybody.
[1:02:25] No,
[1:02:27] it's every it's in your thoughts. You've
[1:02:29] got to love everybody in your thoughts.
[1:02:31] Amen. [laughter]
[1:02:36] It it you know it only takes a little
[1:02:38] hate once in a while to break God's
[1:02:41] royal law. A little hate once in a while
[1:02:46] to break the law.
[1:02:49] But if you have respect, verse nine, if
[1:02:52] you have respect to persons, in other
[1:02:55] words, you choose one person over
[1:02:59] another.
[1:03:02] you commit sin
[1:03:04] and are convinced of the law as a
[1:03:07] transgressor
[1:03:10] just because you choose one person over
[1:03:13] another, you become a transgressor.
[1:03:17] If you show favor or partiality with one
[1:03:20] person over another, you've gotten off
[1:03:23] of God's foundation
[1:03:28] just for showing favor or partiality.
[1:03:32] You get off the foundation. You get off
[1:03:35] the foundation and you're trying to
[1:03:37] build that you're right. You're trying
[1:03:40] to build something
[1:03:43] and having partiality, you've already
[1:03:45] gotten off the foundation. So no matter
[1:03:47] what goes on, it won't stand the test.
[1:03:54] And we know what happens when we show
[1:03:56] respect to persons, right? What happens
[1:03:58] every time you show respect to persons?
[1:04:00] If somebody else is around, well, even
[1:04:02] if they're not around, somebody's going
[1:04:03] to get offended,
[1:04:04] right?
[1:04:05] That's why God's not in it.
[1:04:08] That's why God's not in it.
[1:04:12] For whosoever shall keep the whole law
[1:04:14] and yet offend in one point, just one
[1:04:18] point,
[1:04:20] he is guilty of all. Remember the rich
[1:04:23] young ruler? All these commandments I've
[1:04:25] kept from my youth. Yes.
[1:04:28] But if you want to be perfect,
[1:04:31] you've got one thing. So now you're
[1:04:33] guilty of the whole law. That's why we
[1:04:36] can't offend in just one part of the
[1:04:38] word. We've got to keep building on the
[1:04:40] foundation because as soon as you you
[1:04:43] just let one thing go, you're off the
[1:04:45] foundation.
[1:04:49] For he that said, "Do not commit
[1:04:50] adultery," also said, "Do not kill."
[1:04:55] Now, if thou commit no adultery, yet if
[1:04:57] thou kill, thou become a transgressor of
[1:05:00] the law.
[1:05:02] So, it's not a matter of of, you know,
[1:05:05] we all could sit and we could pinpoint
[1:05:08] to every single person that we know
[1:05:10] something
[1:05:11] that they're wrong in. Yeah. We don't we
[1:05:15] don't even need to be spiritual. We just
[1:05:16] you just listen to the devil. He'll tell
[1:05:17] us. [laughter]
[1:05:21] So, we're all guilty,
[1:05:22] right? We're all guilty because we're
[1:05:24] we're guilty of one thing at least.
[1:05:27] Right?
[1:05:27] You know, I I I tend to believe the
[1:05:29] prophet because we backslide a h 100
[1:05:31] times a day.
[1:05:32] So, we're guilty of a lot more than one
[1:05:34] thing.
[1:05:35] But but it shows that we we're a
[1:05:38] transgressor by our own nature, right?
[1:05:42] So speak ye and so do as they that shall
[1:05:45] be judged by the law of liberty. Now,
[1:05:48] here it comes. For he shall judge. For
[1:05:51] he shall have judgment with Okay. For he
[1:05:54] shall have judgment without mercy that
[1:05:57] have showed no mercy. Now, here's the
[1:06:00] God of heaven. He's telling us that if
[1:06:03] we judge one another and we have a
[1:06:06] tendency and anytime you got respect to
[1:06:08] persons going on or favorites, things
[1:06:10] like that, well, you automatically are
[1:06:14] coming in without
[1:06:16] uh the mercy that's needed because
[1:06:20] proper mercy is going to put everybody
[1:06:22] on the same level, right? For mercy
[1:06:26] rewrote my life. Amen.
[1:06:28] For he shall have judgment without
[1:06:30] mercy, that have shown no mercy, and
[1:06:33] mercy rejoicth against judgment. So
[1:06:38] where's God in the situation?
[1:06:42] I'm talking about when things have been,
[1:06:45] you know, things are things have been
[1:06:47] made right. Things have been tried to
[1:06:49] make right, and then we we we're
[1:06:50] bringing up things in the past. It's
[1:06:53] it's it's not good. Amen.
[1:06:56] So, as soon as we take our eyes off the
[1:06:57] foundation, we'll end up building our
[1:07:00] lives on wrong things.
[1:07:02] So, I'm just going to leave this with
[1:07:04] you because I it's late. I want you to
[1:07:06] go home and and read for me uh where we
[1:07:10] we started in 2 Timothy chapter 2. And I
[1:07:14] would like you to start with verse 14
[1:07:16] and read through the rest of the
[1:07:17] chapter. It's verse 26
[1:07:21] because it it's talking about the things
[1:07:23] that we need to be doing to build and
[1:07:27] then it's talking about things that we
[1:07:29] need to be getting away from
[1:07:34] because our foundation for our lives
[1:07:38] what we if you repented and you got
[1:07:39] baptized it was it was on the word of
[1:07:42] God.
[1:07:44] But how many people have started in with
[1:07:46] this message and left?
[1:07:48] Started in with Jesus Christ and left.
[1:07:50] And don't think the devil doesn't speak
[1:07:52] and try. He has a motive to get us off.
[1:07:56] And and we've got to
[1:07:59] be more in love with the word. Get back
[1:08:01] to the word and be be paying attention
[1:08:04] to everything that God speaks to us. I
[1:08:06] want to encourage us to spend more time
[1:08:08] reading the Bible.
[1:08:09] Amen.
[1:08:10] Yes, sir.
[1:08:11] Spend more time reading the Bible. Allow
[1:08:13] the Holy Ghost to speak to you out of
[1:08:15] his word.
[1:08:16] Amen.
[1:08:17] And then we can grow.
[1:08:20] Got to get back to the word. Let's stand
[1:08:22] together. The word is our foundation.
[1:08:25] It's our absolute. It's forever settled
[1:08:27] in heaven.
[1:08:32] I like the old they came to brother
[1:08:34] Brandon. They said, "Well, where do you
[1:08:36] want to be when the bobs drop?
[1:08:42] Do you want to be in a a bomb shelter?
[1:08:45] Do you want to be in heaven?
[1:08:48] He said, "No,
[1:08:51] I want to be in the word.
[1:08:54] That's our foundation and it's it's
[1:08:56] everything that's being being built." If
[1:08:58] you notice there in Revelations now,
[1:09:01] when John saw the new Jerusalem coming
[1:09:04] down, the city coming down, it was us.
[1:09:08] It was us.
[1:09:11] It it is what he built. We are God's
[1:09:15] husbandry and it was built on the
[1:09:17] foundation of the word and it it the
[1:09:19] whole building was God's word. It was
[1:09:22] his is his will. And um I know I get
[1:09:26] tempted the same scenario that I'm in
[1:09:28] the message. I have the word. What more
[1:09:31] is there? Well, there's more. There is
[1:09:35] more for you. I will say this. If you
[1:09:37] take time to say, "Lord, what would you
[1:09:39] have me to do more than I'm doing now? I
[1:09:43] know that I know that I know God will
[1:09:45] show you.
[1:09:46] I believe it."
[1:09:46] But if that love isn't there, and you
[1:09:48] don't want to ask him,
[1:09:50] then you're going to miss it. You're
[1:09:52] going to miss the whole shebang that
[1:09:54] coming to church, being in the message,
[1:09:56] what are we waiting for? You know, the
[1:09:58] whole the whole thing. Why is God
[1:10:00] delaying his coming? God is in control.
[1:10:02] God knows what he's doing. He's just
[1:10:04] looking for us to get back to the
[1:10:06] foundation and and stay on that word.
[1:10:09] Amen. Let's sing. On Christ, the solid
[1:10:12] rock I stand.
[1:10:14] Amen.
[1:10:17] My hope is built on nothing less than
[1:10:22] Jesus [music and singing] blood and
[1:10:25] righteousness.
[1:10:26] I dare not trust the sweetest fame, but
[1:10:31] holy lean on Jesus [singing and music]
[1:10:34] name.
[1:10:36] On Christ the solid rock I stand. All
[1:10:41] other ground is sinking sand. All other
[1:10:46] ground is sinking sand.
[1:10:51] His oath, his coit,
[1:10:54] his blood. Support me in the whelming
[1:10:58] flood. When all around my soul gives
[1:11:03] way, he [music and singing] then is my
[1:11:06] rock and stay.
[1:11:09] On Christ's solid rock I stand. All
[1:11:14] other ground is sinking sand. All other
[1:11:18] ground is sinking [music]
[1:11:20] sand.
[1:11:23] Amen. And I'm thankful for that rock.
[1:11:26] All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:30] I know the Lord will make a way for me.
[1:11:33] Can we sing that one? I know the Lord
[1:11:35] will make a way for me.
[1:11:38] [music]

[1:11:42] I know the Lord [singing]
[1:11:46] will make a way
[1:11:48] for [music] me.
[1:11:52] I know the Lord [singing]

[1:11:57] for me.

[1:12:09] [singing]
[1:12:10] I know the Lord will make a way for me.
[1:12:15] One more time. I know the Lord will make
[1:12:17] a way for me. I know the Lord
[1:12:20] [singing and music]
[1:12:20] will make a way for me.
[1:12:27] I know the Lord [singing]
[1:12:29] will
[1:12:31] I need you to pray for me to tomorrow.
[1:12:33] Tomorrow is [music] going to be the um
[1:12:37] it's going to be my mother passed away
[1:12:41] tomorrow. Okay.
[1:12:42] And it's going to be [music] it's going
[1:12:44] to be very hard on me tomorrow. and
[1:12:47] passed away tomorrow. And I would need
[1:12:49] you to pray for my pastor's [music]
