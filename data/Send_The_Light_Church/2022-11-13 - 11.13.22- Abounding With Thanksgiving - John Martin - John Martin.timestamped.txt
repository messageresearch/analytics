[35:07] hearts might be comforted being knitted
[35:09] together in love
[35:10] and unto all Riches of the fullness of a
[35:14] a full Assurance of understanding to the
[35:18] acknowledgment of
[35:20] this mystery of God here it is again to
[35:24] the acknowledgment so this Christ in you
[35:28] amen
[35:30] and of the father and of Christ in whom
[35:33] are HID all the treasures of wisdom and
[35:37] knowledge
[35:38] and this I say lest any man should
[35:41] beguile you with enticing words for
[35:44] though I be absent in the flesh yet I am
[35:47] with you in spirit join and be holding
[35:50] your order
[35:53] and the steadfastness of your faith in
[35:57] Christ
[35:58] as ye have therefore received Jesus
[36:01] Christ the lord
[36:03] so walk ye in him
[36:07] that's a huge responsibility right there
[36:10] rooted and built up in him
[36:13] established in the faith as ye have been
[36:17] taught
[36:18] abounding therein with Thanksgiving
[36:23] amen God bless you may be said I want to
[36:25] entitle this message abounding
[36:28] with Thanksgiving
[36:35] I want to say it's good to see sister
[36:37] Jeannie back
[36:38] and amen
[36:40] you know
[36:42] um every time someone's not here
[36:45] I recognize it
[36:47] can't but help recognize it good to see
[36:51] brother Johnson back amen
[36:55] um
[36:59] I believe
[37:02] that God
[37:04] one day we're going to be together and
[37:05] we'll never ever go a day as it were and
[37:09] separate
[37:10] will be together for eternity
[37:14] a bounty with Thanksgiving or the giving
[37:17] of thanks
[37:19] sometimes it's easy to abound with
[37:22] Thanksgiving and sometimes it's hard
[37:25] things can steal away our joy and our
[37:28] gratitude
[37:30] sometimes our trials and problems
[37:33] afflictions they can steer us away from
[37:36] abounding with Thanksgiving
[37:39] but there are other things that can
[37:40] shrink wrap our gratitude in life
[37:43] we live in a world of materialism
[37:47] people are so full they're full to the
[37:50] brim of themselves
[37:52] a society that feels entitled
[37:56] to what it receives will not adequately
[37:59] Express gratitude
[38:02] there are thieves of unthankfulness that
[38:04] can slip into our lives things like
[38:06] pride and arrogancy
[38:09] vanity and envy Strife unforgiveness
[38:12] self-righteousness
[38:13] judgmentalness all these can steal away
[38:17] gratitude
[38:19] Paul warned us just before the coming of
[38:22] the Lord that the church would be going
[38:25] through perilous times and I'll tell you
[38:28] we know the world that we're living in
[38:30] is horrible
[38:32] the world's going through troubled times
[38:34] but he said the church will be as well
[38:38] members of the church would become so
[38:41] full of themselves
[38:43] in excessive sense of self-importance
[38:48] he described the church as lovers of
[38:50] their own selves
[38:52] covetist bolsters
[38:55] proud fierce
[38:58] wow
[39:00] false accusers
[39:03] Traders just
[39:06] forgetting about what they said in the
[39:08] past heady high-minded unthankful
[39:14] unthankful
[39:16] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[39:20] God
[39:22] now it's really really hard a Believer
[39:27] has to fight through a lot of spirits to
[39:30] actually be abounding
[39:32] with Thanksgiving
[39:36] but I believe that there's a bride that
[39:38] will deny her flesh
[39:42] and that opens the door to abound in
[39:44] Thanksgiving because if you don't put
[39:47] this flesh under subjection you will
[39:49] always find something to complain about
[39:53] commit and I'll tell you this this is an
[39:56] important scripture that that that we
[39:59] have something I think that we just we
[40:02] Overlook we want to be rooted we want to
[40:05] be built up we want to be established in
[40:07] the faith
[40:09] but we need to be abounding with
[40:11] Thanksgiving
[40:16] I want to turn to some scriptures
[40:19] today I want them to to dictate to us
[40:23] what our life should be
[40:27] did you know that if you really believe
[40:31] church will change your life
[40:34] but you got to really believe you can't
[40:36] believe
[40:40] carnally
[40:42] or picking and choosing
[40:45] I want you to write this scripture down
[40:46] first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13.
[40:50] first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13
[40:52] for this calls also thank we god without
[40:58] ceasing when's the last time you thank
[41:00] god without ceasing
[41:04] because when you receive the word of God
[41:08] which he heard of us you received it not
[41:12] as the word of men
[41:15] just a man saying that
[41:18] but as it is in truth the word of God
[41:22] which effectually worketh also in you
[41:26] that believe the word of God really
[41:29] works
[41:30] it's not just a religion there's power
[41:33] in believing the word things can it can
[41:37] give you Joy it can give you peace it
[41:39] can it can help you go through trials
[41:42] God never promised us sunshine
[41:45] he promised us peace
[41:49] he promised us joy
[41:51] and that's what we're after
[41:54] Psalms 100 if you turn with me I'll tell
[41:57] you if we could enter into the spirit of
[41:58] this Psalm every day would be a
[42:01] Thanksgiving Day
[42:03] Psalms 100 verse 1 says Make a Joyful
[42:07] Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands A
[42:11] Joyful Noise now how do you do that
[42:15] I mean think about it we make a lot of
[42:18] noises
[42:19] but we need to make a Joyful Noise
[42:22] and it needs to be unto the Lord
[42:25] you know sometimes we make we make
[42:27] noises for attention
[42:29] right
[42:31] but we need to make a Noise unto the
[42:33] Lord
[42:35] All Ye Lands not just America but
[42:38] everywhere
[42:39] serve the Lord with gladness serve him
[42:44] with gladness I'm so glad to be alive
[42:48] come before him what's singing
[42:53] amen song in your heart you know you
[42:55] don't have to wait for church to that
[42:57] happen you could just you know be all by
[43:00] yourself but you want to come into His
[43:02] presence start with a song
[43:04] yes just start singing before you know
[43:06] it you're going to feel better his
[43:08] presence will come near you
[43:10] I mean this is the word of God
[43:12] I tell you our minds need to be made up
[43:14] before we come into church
[43:17] you know if your mind isn't made up I'm
[43:20] I'm going to come before him with praise
[43:22] and thanksgiving
[43:24] you're not you're gonna struggle
[43:28] know ye that the Lord
[43:31] he is God
[43:33] it is he that made us
[43:36] and not we that made ourselves
[43:39] we are the his people
[43:42] and the Sheep of his Pastor you know too
[43:43] often we think we are in control of Our
[43:46] Lives
[43:48] that we call the shots that we're going
[43:50] to do what we want to do as if God did
[43:53] not make us
[43:55] but God made us we belong to him we pay
[43:59] attention to him his word is our
[44:01] absolute amen
[44:05] so we need to know that know the Lord
[44:07] know in that measure we're not a part of
[44:12] Darwin's theory
[44:14] where something special where are the
[44:17] people that God has created
[44:20] enter into his gates with Thanksgiving
[44:23] and into his courts with praise
[44:26] and and don't stop there be thankful
[44:30] unto him be thankful and bless his name
[44:34] that's a it comes from the heart
[44:38] for the Lord is good
[44:41] not sometimes but all the time
[44:44] his Mercy is Everlasting
[44:47] and his truth endureth to all
[44:50] generations
[44:52] I wonder how often we've come before is
[44:54] his Gates without the respect
[44:58] that's right a praise
[45:00] the respect of Thanksgiving
[45:03] the respect of gratitude
[45:06] that we think this is an option this is
[45:09] not an option to God
[45:12] it may be an option to us but it is not
[45:15] an option to God when we don't praise
[45:18] him when we don't come before him the
[45:19] way he says we are disrespecting God
[45:23] [Music]
[45:24] and then we sit here in church and
[45:26] wonder why we don't feel the presence of
[45:28] God come on I'll tell you the whole
[45:30] world could be blown up around you but
[45:32] if you're praising God and you're in his
[45:34] presence
[45:36] where did the prophet say he'd rather
[45:37] where would he like to be when the play
[45:39] Scrolls blows up
[45:42] he wants to be in the word the word is
[45:45] here praise the word
[45:47] amen
[45:53] God requires respect when we come before
[45:56] him
[45:57] not just making it to church
[46:00] it's a condition
[46:02] our attitude has to be right
[46:05] we have to give him praise I'll tell you
[46:09] when Isaiah was in the presence of the
[46:12] Lord
[46:12] he saw things going on
[46:17] he saw angels that were continuously
[46:19] praising God just non-stop
[46:22] it's because God expects that he demands
[46:26] it they weren't options they weren't
[46:28] over to the side talking to one Angel
[46:30] talking to the other yeah look what's
[46:32] going on over there look at that angel
[46:33] you know they're in the prayer room
[46:35] they're praying all that's crazy
[46:37] okay
[46:39] no there was an order in heaven
[46:44] and God was the creator of the beans
[46:50] and these beings were created to get
[46:53] praise and honor
[46:55] and sometimes we just forget
[46:58] I'll tell you why sometimes we don't
[47:00] praise God like we should when we come
[47:02] to church it's because we don't bring it
[47:05] with us
[47:08] there's nothing to do about what songs
[47:10] being sung or what sermons being
[47:12] preached
[47:14] it is to do with where a heart's been
[47:20] sisters know how it feels like when you
[47:22] spend hours cooking
[47:25] preparing a meal
[47:27] just to have someone plop down and start
[47:30] eating and express no gratitude
[47:34] for the time that you spent preparing
[47:39] come on anybody ever experienced that
[47:42] a little thank you would be nice
[47:45] sometimes our attitude well that's your
[47:47] job my job's at work your job is
[47:53] or I just I don't feel like I got too
[47:56] many problems today
[47:58] come on
[48:00] I want you to think about all the things
[48:03] that God does for you every day
[48:05] he gives you new mercies every day
[48:09] amen he's taking care of us
[48:12] we daily sin and we need his Mercy he
[48:14] protects us from so many things he's a
[48:17] present help in a time of trouble he's
[48:20] still Jehovah Jireh his grace is still
[48:23] sufficient to meet our needs he's
[48:25] Jehovah Rapha he's still our healer he
[48:28] still heals our hearts when they become
[48:30] broken
[48:31] he's still he's still Jehovah shalom
[48:35] Jesus is still our peace we don't find
[48:38] peace anywhere else
[48:40] he gave us his love he's still given us
[48:43] more and more and more of his love it
[48:46] was his love that said I'll never leave
[48:48] you I'll never forsake you he's doing
[48:51] that daily he's preparing Our Lives
[48:53] daily and we come into His presence and
[48:56] we forget to thank him for it
[49:00] embrace
[49:01] how does that make him feel
[49:05] well brother John I just don't feel like
[49:07] it
[49:09] hmm
[49:11] I don't believe there's one angel in
[49:13] heaven
[49:14] that feels that way
[49:20] all the other ones got kicked out
[49:26] they said we're not going to have this
[49:28] selfishness
[49:30] in heaven
[49:33] you don't let me be God over your life
[49:36] he cast him down to earth
[49:40] I'll tell you we think it's a choice but
[49:42] it's a respect
[49:44] there's a big difference
[49:48] God spends all this time taking care of
[49:50] us and we need to remember
[49:53] to respect God
[49:56] to give him what he deserves he deserves
[49:59] our Praises he deserves our Thanksgiving
[50:02] he deserves us to bless his name to make
[50:06] a Joyful Noise
[50:07] forget about how hard it is forget about
[50:10] how you feel
[50:14] Psalm 68 verse 19 said blessed be the
[50:17] Lord who daily lordeth us with benefits
[50:23] even the god of our salvation
[50:27] who daily
[50:29] sometimes we go through the day and we
[50:30] Where's God
[50:32] Where's God
[50:34] our eyes are awful what he's doing for
[50:36] us
[50:37] we're focusing on what we want instead
[50:40] of what he's doing
[50:42] come on we need to bless the Lord for
[50:45] what he's doing for us
[50:47] you know one thing I've I've in my life
[50:49] what I've noticed is the more thankful
[50:51] you are the more he gives you
[50:55] I know the scripture teaches me
[51:00] to not murmur not complain
[51:04] the children of Israel when they came
[51:06] out of Egypt the majority of them
[51:08] murmured and complained
[51:11] God wasn't pleased with it
[51:13] now
[51:15] Joshua and Caleb had to go through the
[51:17] same things
[51:19] right they had to go through the same
[51:21] muck that everybody else went through
[51:24] when they came out the same trials the
[51:27] the lacking of water when the got the
[51:29] water was bitter uh uh having to eat the
[51:33] the same Mana every day and all the
[51:36] trials that they went through
[51:38] but they went through it without
[51:39] murmuring and complaining
[51:42] they cut their eyes on what God was
[51:45] doing for them
[51:47] how can you forget the pit that he
[51:49] brought you from
[51:51] he brought us out of the Myra clay
[51:55] amen
[51:57] sometimes we forget the blessings that
[52:00] are connected to being a child of God
[52:02] Psalms 103 verse 1 bless the Lord O my
[52:07] soul
[52:09] your soul is saved
[52:11] amen bless the Lord O my soul and all
[52:14] all that's within me
[52:17] bless His holy name sometimes we can't
[52:20] even get a little peep out
[52:22] sometimes we'll sit in church and we
[52:24] won't even peep praise the Lord
[52:31] bless the Lord Almighty I hope you don't
[52:33] get mad at me I'm just going to be as
[52:37] provoking as I can
[52:41] I believe I believe the Lord wants us to
[52:45] bless his name more than we do
[52:50] verse two bless the Lord O my soul and
[52:52] forget now all his benefits
[52:55] oh sometimes we got to write things down
[52:58] because you know we get so busy
[53:01] right so many things that are happening
[53:03] all of a sudden we're we forget
[53:07] what God has done for us
[53:10] so maybe writing them down is not a bad
[53:12] idea
[53:14] go back it and look at that list
[53:16] count your blessings see what God have
[53:18] done it it will so it will surprise you
[53:21] it won't surprise you how's that go of
[53:23] the things he's done for you you know
[53:25] what I'm trying to say
[53:27] we just forget but if we can get our
[53:29] mind on it
[53:31] all right look at these benefits who
[53:34] forgiveth all thine iniquities
[53:38] oh my aren't you glad for that
[53:41] every one of them he forgiveth all thine
[53:44] iniquities
[53:48] he doesn't leave some undone
[53:50] if you're
[53:52] if you confess them
[53:54] the Bible says he is faithful and just
[53:57] to forgive us amen who forgiveth all
[54:01] thine iniquities who healeth all thy
[54:04] diseases who redeemeth thy life from
[54:07] destruction who crowneth thee with
[54:09] loving kindness and Tender Mercies who
[54:12] satisfieth thy mouth with good things
[54:16] so that the youth is renewed like the
[54:19] eagles are
[54:22] oh forget not the benefits
[54:26] I think something happens in our life
[54:29] when we forget the benefits
[54:32] I mean the the children of Israel they
[54:34] forgot them
[54:37] right and he swore they would not enter
[54:38] into the rest
[54:40] so they came out of the world
[54:43] they walked through a process of
[54:45] sanctification and never quite got
[54:48] through it
[54:52] and so through our process of of getting
[54:55] to where God is really calling us to we
[54:58] can slip away in this murmuring and
[55:01] complaining
[55:05] forget what God is really doing you know
[55:09] we don't hate our flesh enough
[55:12] that's the problem we like ourselves too
[55:14] much
[55:16] but it's our flesh that gets me in
[55:19] trouble
[55:20] it is not my brother it's not my sister
[55:22] it's me oh Lord that's standing in the
[55:24] need of prayer if this thing can be
[55:28] crucified then Christ can come alive in
[55:31] our lives
[55:33] I love the word
[55:36] Psalms 116 verse I don't want to
[55:39] encourage you this morning enter into
[55:40] the word
[55:41] amen enter into the word say Amen to the
[55:43] word it's our it's our absolute
[55:46] your flesh may not like it
[55:48] that may not that that may be why you
[55:51] don't want to say Amen
[55:53] but your soul is rejoicing
[55:57] Psalms 116 verse 12 what shall I Render
[56:00] unto the Lord for all his benefits
[56:04] towards me
[56:05] what shall I render what should I do
[56:07] well I'll just come in church and I'll
[56:08] see what God's got for me
[56:12] I will take the cup of Salvation and
[56:15] call upon the name of the Lord
[56:19] look what he says here I will pay my
[56:22] vows unto the Lord now in the presence
[56:25] of all his people
[56:30] right
[56:32] it sounds like God
[56:35] demands the respect of blessing His holy
[56:40] name
[56:41] in church
[56:45] it's not an option
[56:48] don't make it an option don't let the
[56:50] devil tell you it's an option
[56:55] if there is a failure the failure is
[56:59] here
[57:03] why don't we get to the place church
[57:05] that we're literally praising God too
[57:08] much
[57:11] see what happens
[57:15] see how he hurts the church or is is
[57:20] negative towards the church
[57:22] you know what I'm saying we sit here and
[57:24] kind of Judge whether we're I've done
[57:27] enough I've praised God enough
[57:31] well I'm coming against that spirit
[57:35] God wants more praise
[57:39] yeah and I just say it like this let
[57:42] this message be for the rest of your
[57:43] life for every time you go to church
[57:46] you and God it's not about you and
[57:48] everybody else I'll do it if everybody
[57:50] else says no you do it because you love
[57:52] God because he he he redeemed you he
[57:56] saved you
[57:57] he's blessed you this week
[58:02] a lot of times we don't realize but
[58:04] gratitude is the thing that could be
[58:06] missing
[58:08] the psalmist said that we're to enter
[58:11] his Gates
[58:13] and to be thankful
[58:16] to be thankful
[58:18] we got scriptures that talk about being
[58:21] thankful for our trials
[58:24] I mean stretching the boundary sometimes
[58:28] not that we you know really want them in
[58:31] our lives
[58:33] but we need a right attitude towards
[58:35] them
[58:36] brother Brandon says it's not the action
[58:38] that happens to you but it's how you
[58:41] react towards it that's what counts
[58:45] being thankful comes from the inside of
[58:48] a man's heart
[58:50] and honestly
[58:52] God expects it and demands it to be
[58:55] expressed outwardly
[58:57] think about that
[59:02] a noise comes aloud
[59:10] when Isaiah was in heaven he didn't see
[59:13] a
[59:19] was in silence
[59:26] foreign
[59:28] God is always long for Fellowship
[59:32] he's long for praise
[59:35] we were created to praise him
[59:39] but
[59:40] for some reason this flesh keeps us from
[59:44] giving the respect that God demands and
[59:48] I use this word because we know he
[59:53] he wants us to respect him
[59:55] all right
[59:57] we know he deserves it
[59:59] but we don't think often that he demands
[1:00:01] it
[1:00:04] but he does
[1:00:07] he demands it
[1:00:10] sometimes our own negative attitude can
[1:00:12] get in the way of abounding in
[1:00:15] Thanksgiving
[1:00:17] you know if you're going to abound you
[1:00:18] got to get the train going down the
[1:00:20] track
[1:00:21] you got to put some some coal in the
[1:00:23] engine you got to get things going you
[1:00:26] got to start off
[1:00:29] our own selfishness our own
[1:00:31] ungratefulness can get in the way
[1:00:36] we want to blame our problems and our
[1:00:38] neighbors and our jobs and our and this
[1:00:40] and that and
[1:00:45] God is
[1:00:47] God is looking for jobs
[1:00:50] that's what he's he's looking for jobs
[1:00:53] someone that's going to maintain
[1:00:56] no matter what happens to him
[1:01:00] Psalms 34 Verse 1 I Will Bless The Lord
[1:01:04] at all times
[1:01:07] at all times his praise shall
[1:01:11] continually be in my mind
[1:01:18] heart
[1:01:20] mouth
[1:01:22] he wants it to come out
[1:01:26] continually
[1:01:28] my soul shall make her boast in the Lord
[1:01:33] now the humble
[1:01:35] shall hear thereof and they're going to
[1:01:37] be glad
[1:01:39] that means those that are fighting Pride
[1:01:44] kind of want to sit there and don't be
[1:01:46] told to praise the Lord
[1:01:50] come on
[1:01:51] I look at look it is not you it is not
[1:01:55] you
[1:01:56] it's the spirits that get on you
[1:01:59] that's who I'm talking to
[1:02:02] the thing is you're the one
[1:02:05] that's got to agree with the word and
[1:02:08] say get behind me Satan I'm going to
[1:02:09] praise the Lord
[1:02:11] I'm going to bless him with all my heart
[1:02:17] oh magnify the Lord with me we sing it
[1:02:20] didn't we o magnify the Lord with me and
[1:02:23] let us exalt his name by ourselves
[1:02:33] we come together brothers and sisters of
[1:02:36] light precious faith
[1:02:39] you know you can't go in a grocery store
[1:02:42] and just run up to everybody say let's
[1:02:45] praise the Lord
[1:02:50] but when you're in his house
[1:02:53] we all come for the same purpose we
[1:02:56] ought to feel like a family of God here
[1:02:57] there ought to be such Unity here
[1:03:01] we ought to feel comfortable praising
[1:03:03] God next to our brothers and sisters
[1:03:07] I sought the Lord and he heard me and he
[1:03:10] delivered me from all my fears how many
[1:03:13] Deliverance today amen we have a God he
[1:03:17] can Deliver Us from all of our fears
[1:03:22] and we Face them
[1:03:24] we all face them
[1:03:27] you may not think you got it right this
[1:03:29] second
[1:03:30] but be honest we Face them
[1:03:34] but you just seek the Lord
[1:03:36] he promised to deliver from all our
[1:03:39] fears now perfect love would just cast
[1:03:41] it out
[1:03:42] and I'll tell you you just fall so in
[1:03:44] love with God
[1:03:45] amen you're secure in his love
[1:03:51] now the Lord notices when an invitation
[1:03:53] to exalt his name together comes and
[1:03:57] there's an unwillingness there
[1:03:59] you know what I'm talking about right
[1:04:04] let's just praise the lord well you know
[1:04:08] I'm not going to do that
[1:04:11] or how about this one God didn't tell me
[1:04:18] but the humble
[1:04:19] I'm telling you they're going to be glad
[1:04:24] sometimes we rely on our feelings
[1:04:29] more often than not people rely on their
[1:04:32] feelings to tell them when it's time to
[1:04:35] praise
[1:04:36] yeah
[1:04:38] if their feelings are telling them
[1:04:41] well they're not in the mood
[1:04:45] if they're too tired they had a hard day
[1:04:48] been through the wringer
[1:04:50] or they just don't feel like doing it
[1:04:53] their feelings become their decision
[1:04:56] maker on whether they're going to praise
[1:04:58] God or not
[1:05:01] their feelings Trump the word
[1:05:07] Oh Brother John I'm just I'm just being
[1:05:10] human
[1:05:11] hmm
[1:05:15] but this is a place to let your soul
[1:05:18] rejoice in the Lord
[1:05:21] yield
[1:05:23] your soul to the Lord
[1:05:28] if we're only going to express our
[1:05:30] Thanksgiving when we feel like it
[1:05:32] God will be missing
[1:05:35] out on a lot of the respect that he
[1:05:39] deserves
[1:05:40] that's number one
[1:05:42] and number two you're going to be
[1:05:44] missing out on a lot of Joy from being
[1:05:48] in his presence
[1:05:55] we need to learn from the scriptures
[1:05:59] they teach us
[1:06:02] we need to focus and maintain a grateful
[1:06:05] attitude in our heart for things
[1:06:09] there are always things around us to be
[1:06:11] grateful for
[1:06:13] be grateful for the seat that we're
[1:06:14] sitting in the heat that we have in the
[1:06:16] room a place that we can come together
[1:06:19] brothers and sisters that we know that
[1:06:21] pray for us
[1:06:23] we just need to to look more for them
[1:06:25] and and stay focused on them
[1:06:28] I understand things can become difficult
[1:06:30] I understand difficulties uh believe me
[1:06:34] I'm a fellow servant of difficulties and
[1:06:37] sufferings I I know about them
[1:06:43] Oh Brother John things are so bad
[1:06:47] that I can't possibly focus on anything
[1:06:50] except my problems right now
[1:06:54] you just have no idea what I'm going
[1:06:56] through do you
[1:06:58] You couldn't possibly see or understand
[1:07:00] my situation
[1:07:03] it just seems like we've always
[1:07:06] got the wrong attitude
[1:07:12] it's through these times
[1:07:14] that we give the respect that God
[1:07:16] deserves
[1:07:18] he doesn't deserve less respect because
[1:07:20] you don't feel like it
[1:07:25] it's not our feelings it's not our
[1:07:27] problems it's not our circumstances God
[1:07:29] is worthy to be praised at all times
[1:07:32] we just got to sink that get get it
[1:07:35] through I'm telling you because if you
[1:07:36] keep your mind on praising God your
[1:07:39] troubles won't seem so bad
[1:07:42] and you know I think sometimes he's just
[1:07:44] waiting for us to start praising him and
[1:07:47] giving the glory that he deserves so
[1:07:49] he'll do something for you
[1:07:52] hey man
[1:07:56] God don't want our feelings above his
[1:07:59] word
[1:08:01] think about Paul and Silas when they
[1:08:03] were thrown into prison for no wrong
[1:08:05] they did
[1:08:07] and they were persecuted for doing good
[1:08:11] Shackles on their feet
[1:08:13] germs and diseases all around them you
[1:08:16] know the things that would go into
[1:08:17] prison back then
[1:08:19] these the prisons we got now are halfway
[1:08:21] decent
[1:08:24] the government was against them
[1:08:27] there was nothing to help their feelings
[1:08:31] to want to praise God
[1:08:34] not a thing
[1:08:36] no outside support group
[1:08:39] nothing there saying come on
[1:08:44] but something inside of them
[1:08:47] I'll tell you what to stop most
[1:08:48] believers
[1:08:50] but it didn't stop Paul it didn't stop
[1:08:53] Silas
[1:08:54] no there was something inside of them
[1:08:58] called g-o-d called the Holy Ghost I'll
[1:09:03] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[1:09:05] I'll be with you to the end
[1:09:11] it's a strong belief
[1:09:14] they had Grateful Hearts I'll tell you
[1:09:17] they were abounding with Thanksgiving
[1:09:22] sometimes we think we need a better
[1:09:24] situation to be in
[1:09:28] a better set of circumstances until we
[1:09:30] feel like praising God or someone just
[1:09:32] to help us
[1:09:35] no sir
[1:09:38] if they maintained it a grateful heart
[1:09:41] a Heart of Thanksgiving Soul can I
[1:09:44] so can I
[1:09:47] tell you hubby's been in prison
[1:09:50] well excuse me hummy's been in prison
[1:09:52] with shackles on your feet
[1:09:56] humans been in that condition
[1:09:58] absolutely right
[1:10:01] and if you were in that condition
[1:10:04] how many were you praising God like Paul
[1:10:06] and Silas
[1:10:09] I'll tell you
[1:10:11] the angel of the Lord just came and took
[1:10:13] care of those chains
[1:10:15] I'll tell you A lot of times we're we're
[1:10:16] bolted down by the chains of this world
[1:10:20] change the circumstances chains of doubt
[1:10:23] problems in her life
[1:10:25] and we need to look to the author of our
[1:10:28] salvation
[1:10:30] the one who began to work in us the one
[1:10:33] who's forgiven us of our sins the one
[1:10:36] who's redeemed us the one that loves us
[1:10:38] with benefits
[1:10:46] first Thessalonians 5 16 tells us to
[1:10:49] Rejoice Evermore
[1:10:53] pray without ceasing
[1:10:55] in everything give thanks
[1:10:59] for this is the will of God in Christ
[1:11:01] Jesus and you know what my friend it's
[1:11:04] concerning you
[1:11:06] and you and you and you and you and you
[1:11:09] and you it's a personal thing from God
[1:11:11] to you
[1:11:13] it is his will for your life
[1:11:16] now that word give thanks it means to be
[1:11:18] grateful
[1:11:20] it means to actually Express
[1:11:24] gratitude
[1:11:27] that means when you're talking to
[1:11:28] somebody
[1:11:30] they're going to hear coming forth out
[1:11:32] of you
[1:11:33] how grateful you are to your lord
[1:11:38] in some fashion former way they're going
[1:11:42] to see a gratefulness that you have in
[1:11:45] your heart for what God has done in your
[1:11:48] life
[1:11:54] God has a perfect will for our lives and
[1:11:56] it's to abound with Thanksgiving
[1:11:59] don't just make it a little bit of your
[1:12:02] life but make it so that when everybody
[1:12:04] thinks about you
[1:12:07] there's someone who's abounding in
[1:12:09] Thanksgiving
[1:12:11] when they have a thought when they're
[1:12:13] reminded when something comes up the
[1:12:15] first thing that comes to them is boy
[1:12:17] you know they're just always grateful
[1:12:19] they're just always thankful they're
[1:12:21] just always abounding
[1:12:23] come on now I want our lives to change
[1:12:26] that's why we're here
[1:12:29] we're not here to get on a as it were uh
[1:12:31] just a report card
[1:12:35] we're about
[1:12:37] coming from where we're at to where he's
[1:12:39] calling us to
[1:12:44] going back to our opening scripture
[1:12:46] Colossians 2 verse 4 and this I say
[1:12:48] listening man should beguile you with
[1:12:50] enticing words for though I'd be absent
[1:12:52] in the flesh yet I'm with you in the
[1:12:54] spirit join
[1:12:56] and beholding your order and your
[1:13:01] steadfastness of your faith in Christ
[1:13:04] isn't this a beautiful thought to have
[1:13:06] of others
[1:13:08] as ye have therefore received Christ
[1:13:11] Jesus the Lord
[1:13:13] so walk
[1:13:15] in him
[1:13:18] don't put him on the Shelf don't make
[1:13:19] him a Jew boy don't make him just you
[1:13:22] know take care of all my problems
[1:13:24] walk with him
[1:13:26] walk with him
[1:13:28] make it so personal that people think
[1:13:30] they're ignoring you because he seems to
[1:13:32] be talking to Jesus all the time
[1:13:35] be an oddball
[1:13:40] now notice there's a colon afterward him
[1:13:45] and that's used to proceed a list of
[1:13:48] items or an expansion or an explanation
[1:13:52] so in other words we're going to talk
[1:13:54] about what it means
[1:13:56] to walk with them
[1:13:58] rooted
[1:14:00] and built up in them
[1:14:03] established in the faith amen believe in
[1:14:07] the Lord
[1:14:08] and you shall be established Believe In
[1:14:10] His prophets and you shall prosper
[1:14:14] rooted building him built up and
[1:14:16] established in the faith as you have
[1:14:18] been taught what have I been taught
[1:14:22] abounding therein with Thanksgiving I've
[1:14:26] been taught it Paul said I have learned
[1:14:28] that whatever state I'm in there with to
[1:14:30] be content the disciples were taught how
[1:14:33] to pray we're being taught how to abound
[1:14:36] with Thanksgiving don't make it just a
[1:14:38] little part of your life make it the
[1:14:40] major part of your life I'm bound with
[1:14:44] Thanksgiving
[1:14:47] He's Worthy
[1:14:49] He's Worthy
[1:14:52] that word a bounty with Thanksgiving it
[1:14:54] means
[1:14:55] to Super abound
[1:14:59] in quantity
[1:15:00] and quality so in other words our
[1:15:04] gratefulness and our thankfulness
[1:15:07] needs to become a greater quality
[1:15:11] not just some
[1:15:15] but make it clear
[1:15:20] that it's obvious to the people that
[1:15:23] watch your lives
[1:15:25] you're super grateful
[1:15:28] thankful for him
[1:15:33] it means to be in excess
[1:15:37] he wants me to be excessive with this
[1:15:39] Thanksgiving
[1:15:41] whoa this this doesn't this doesn't
[1:15:43] compute with my mind no it doesn't his
[1:15:45] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[1:15:49] it means to be superfluous
[1:15:52] which to the flesh may seem unnecessary
[1:15:58] or too much
[1:16:01] to cause to excel
[1:16:04] to make more abound to have more
[1:16:07] abundance to be more abundant to be the
[1:16:11] better to exceed to excel to increase to
[1:16:14] to do over and evolve that's what it
[1:16:17] means
[1:16:18] that's what this scripture means
[1:16:21] abounding therein with Thanksgiving it
[1:16:24] means a little bit more than okay John I
[1:16:26] got your point
[1:16:28] I heard it can you go on no I can't go
[1:16:30] on because this is the message today
[1:16:37] our feelings won't always be grateful
[1:16:41] but the Holy Ghost Inside of us
[1:16:44] will always respect God's word
[1:16:51] which of his word says
[1:16:54] Praise Him
[1:16:55] without ceasing
[1:16:58] be thankful always to abound with it
[1:17:01] then I'm going to do that
[1:17:06] because I'm compelled
[1:17:09] Paul says it's no longer me
[1:17:12] but it's Christ in me
[1:17:17] fulfilling
[1:17:23] fulfilling the will of God God is worthy
[1:17:26] of all of our praise at all times
[1:17:30] amen don't wait till you get to church
[1:17:33] but I'll say when you get here enter his
[1:17:36] gates with Thanksgiving
[1:17:38] and I'll say remain thankful while
[1:17:40] you're in the gates
[1:17:41] and I'll say this when you leave the
[1:17:43] gates be thankful
[1:17:45] thankfulness is the center Hub well
[1:17:47] brother John I've got this other thing
[1:17:49] on my mind and I'm trying to wrestle and
[1:17:51] deal with it
[1:17:53] well you know
[1:17:54] I understand
[1:17:56] but that attitude
[1:17:59] if you allow that it will always be
[1:18:03] Trump it'll always Trump coming the
[1:18:06] right way
[1:18:08] because if it's not one thing today
[1:18:09] it'll be another thing next service and
[1:18:12] another thing next service and then
[1:18:14] another service and before you know it
[1:18:15] you're coming to service with all this
[1:18:17] and you're missing the very thing that
[1:18:20] God wants you to be doing which is a
[1:18:22] bounding with Thanksgiving
[1:18:24] we're staring at all of our problems too
[1:18:26] much
[1:18:28] well brother John you don't understand
[1:18:29] my problem is much worse than yours I
[1:18:31] wish I had what you had no you don't
[1:18:36] I'll tell you what there's nobody here
[1:18:39] that would like the debt that I owe
[1:18:42] today
[1:18:51] don't compare
[1:18:55] God is with you
[1:18:58] God's going to see you through
[1:19:00] God wants every one of us wherever we're
[1:19:02] at to be abounding with Thanksgiving
[1:19:10] praising God
[1:19:11] it is a personal choice in one way
[1:19:14] but that doesn't mean our soul has a
[1:19:16] choice in the matter
[1:19:19] our flesh may feel like it has a choice
[1:19:21] but a genuine believer filled with the
[1:19:23] Holy Ghost he doesn't have a choice in
[1:19:25] the matter
[1:19:26] he reads this word and it becomes
[1:19:30] his absolute
[1:19:33] it's his law
[1:19:35] that God has written in his heart
[1:19:38] and he begins to manifest it outwardly
[1:19:41] you know I'm just I'm so tired of a
[1:19:44] devil that tries to get us to pick a
[1:19:47] cherry pick of what scriptures we want
[1:19:49] to go by and which ones we don't
[1:19:52] come on now I can't believe it's so
[1:19:54] quiet after I said that
[1:19:56] I mean the word is the word we come here
[1:19:59] hungering for the word now your flesh
[1:20:01] don't want all the word I understand
[1:20:02] that my flesh don't
[1:20:04] I understand that
[1:20:07] but this is a relationship between your
[1:20:09] soul and God
[1:20:12] and your soul feeds on every word of God
[1:20:16] it's the only way we'll become the bride
[1:20:19] without spot or without wrinkle
[1:20:22] so we got to take this word and say oh
[1:20:24] God let me live it let me manifest it
[1:20:27] let my light be changed let me come into
[1:20:29] your house uh the way that you want me
[1:20:33] to
[1:20:36] don't sit here and sit here as if this
[1:20:38] is some seminar that we learn stuff
[1:20:42] this is God speaking to your hearts and
[1:20:44] souls
[1:20:49] he demands respect
[1:20:52] the respect of praise
[1:20:56] Thanksgiving
[1:20:59] in fact the scripture says everything
[1:21:01] that has breath praise ye the Lord he
[1:21:03] makes the trees to clap their hands and
[1:21:04] praise Him Jesus says if they hold their
[1:21:07] peace the rocks will cry out
[1:21:12] rejoice in the lord always
[1:21:15] and again I say rejoice
[1:21:19] we can see God in nature
[1:21:21] see him in the Grand Canyon it's a
[1:21:23] different mountain ranges we talk about
[1:21:25] the Trees of the forest and the
[1:21:28] Everglades the sun sets and the Sun
[1:21:30] rises
[1:21:31] all beautiful could you say Amen
[1:21:34] we can see God in all the animals
[1:21:37] he's a god of variety just one species
[1:21:40] he has so many different shapes and
[1:21:43] sizes and colors and some you know flap
[1:21:47] their wings like this
[1:21:49] on her property and something like this
[1:21:51] so fast you can't even see it
[1:21:55] he's awesome
[1:21:57] we can see God in his creation
[1:22:02] it's much easier to look at those things
[1:22:04] and abound with Thanksgiving
[1:22:07] that's true
[1:22:10] we even find ourselves looking at the
[1:22:12] beauty of some of these things and begin
[1:22:14] to weep
[1:22:16] and to cry
[1:22:19] but sometimes we look at our own life
[1:22:23] and can't give thanks
[1:22:31] we we don't look at the one Soul that's
[1:22:36] worth ten thousand worlds of sunsets
[1:22:40] and we can't give them praise for it
[1:22:42] the saving of your soul is worth
[1:22:46] praising God for today friends
[1:22:49] you can't find anything else to praise
[1:22:51] God for praise him for saving your soul
[1:22:57] go take your eyes you're more valuable
[1:22:59] than the sparrows
[1:23:03] look at the beauty of God inside of you
[1:23:05] the beauty of changing your nature
[1:23:13] we need to spend more time humbling
[1:23:15] ourselves under the mighty hand of God
[1:23:18] God has done so much for us if he never
[1:23:21] done another thing he'd be worthy if you
[1:23:24] praise him to your dad
[1:23:27] just amazing to me how much we've been
[1:23:29] disrespecting God
[1:23:35] it's true
[1:23:37] when we listen to the the tapes
[1:23:41] sometimes we can hear brother Brandon
[1:23:42] say let's just say let's say praise the
[1:23:46] Lord
[1:23:47] and then you hear the congregation
[1:23:49] saying praise the Lord
[1:23:52] when the Holy Ghost would say in our
[1:23:54] church let's praise the Lord
[1:23:59] sometimes we bow on our heart
[1:24:03] well I don't have to
[1:24:06] that's just brother John trying to work
[1:24:08] something up
[1:24:11] I'm more spiritual than that
[1:24:14] if that was really God it would just be
[1:24:17] happening on its own
[1:24:19] come on don't tell me we don't battle
[1:24:22] thoughts like that
[1:24:24] around but you know what we wouldn't
[1:24:26] dare to think that thought when we hear
[1:24:28] Brother Branham say it
[1:24:32] what's going on
[1:24:35] what's going on it shows that we're not
[1:24:37] believing it's the Holy Ghost talking
[1:24:44] friends I don't know
[1:24:45] look
[1:24:46] I would to God that we could be in a
[1:24:49] place
[1:24:50] we all could be in a place I don't care
[1:24:52] what planet it is
[1:24:54] what church it is but you could be in a
[1:24:57] place where you could actually believe
[1:25:02] but I'll tell you I have enough faith
[1:25:04] that if I go to a Catholic church I'll
[1:25:06] hear from God
[1:25:09] but I know he he called me out of it
[1:25:14] right but I know
[1:25:19] Jonah
[1:25:20] turn to God and heard heard God
[1:25:24] I don't care what state we're in I don't
[1:25:26] care what the situation is if you don't
[1:25:29] believe that God is real to you sitting
[1:25:32] there you've got to get to the altar you
[1:25:34] got to get your heart prepared
[1:25:39] the Holy Ghost says let's praise the
[1:25:41] Lord praise the Lord don't go by your
[1:25:43] feelings don't battle those thoughts
[1:25:48] the prophet was here saying it well I
[1:25:51] believe because he's the prophet what am
[1:25:53] I doing here then
[1:25:55] foreign
[1:25:56] exactly
[1:25:58] what was the prophet's gone we just all
[1:26:01] wait to the coming of the Lord no we got
[1:26:03] a five-fold Ministry that God said he
[1:26:05] had perfect the Saints with
[1:26:09] let's stay with the word
[1:26:15] I I don't think we praise God like we
[1:26:17] ought to
[1:26:19] you
[1:26:20] it's because we're not bringing him with
[1:26:21] us to church
[1:26:23] we're looking for excuses not to praise
[1:26:26] him
[1:26:29] sometimes when we come to the house of
[1:26:31] God we're not in the spirit
[1:26:33] and I understand
[1:26:35] you don't got time to prepare sometimes
[1:26:37] sometimes but it becomes a habit
[1:26:40] and then sometimes when we're here we're
[1:26:42] not prepared we're not serious in the
[1:26:45] prayer rooms
[1:26:47] I'm going to tell you
[1:26:50] we're not even right
[1:26:55] now God told us the remedy of blessing
[1:26:58] this church
[1:27:01] that we need to come together and pray
[1:27:05] one for another where is that happening
[1:27:10] well I pray for him
[1:27:12] that's not what God Said
[1:27:15] he said come together and pray one for
[1:27:19] another
[1:27:22] well that I just do that on prayer
[1:27:24] meeting
[1:27:25] oh
[1:27:26] when you make it
[1:27:32] you know we want God to bless but we're
[1:27:34] so unwilling to work
[1:27:37] you don't work you don't eat
[1:27:41] right you don't eat
[1:27:44] come on
[1:27:46] sometimes we come to the house of God
[1:27:48] we're not in the spirit and yet we'll
[1:27:50] crucify
[1:27:52] the song leader
[1:27:54] crucify
[1:27:56] somebody playing the instrument
[1:27:57] something's not right
[1:28:00] crucify the preacher
[1:28:02] the Sunday scoochie something just not
[1:28:05] right in church
[1:28:08] well I thought the Holy Ghost in you is
[1:28:10] supposed to help
[1:28:12] well no the Holy Ghost In Me Is made me
[1:28:15] a judge I'm an administrator of judgment
[1:28:19] shame on us
[1:28:21] I want to see the Holy Ghost in action
[1:28:26] bring the Holy Ghost with you
[1:28:29] brother Brennan said the message led by
[1:28:31] the spirit of God he said it's anything
[1:28:33] I hate Is that real still silence
[1:28:36] go around some of these old morgues
[1:28:38] around here you got them in Shreveport
[1:28:40] too
[1:28:41] Put Me In Mind of an Undertaker parlor
[1:28:45] you take a dead man in there and a balm
[1:28:47] him and keep him dead
[1:28:48] that's about the way it is
[1:28:50] teach them some old theology that's just
[1:28:53] as dead as it can be back there
[1:28:56] and never tell them about the Holy Ghost
[1:28:58] feeling them
[1:28:59] and giving him new life and and new
[1:29:02] leading
[1:29:04] that
[1:29:05] ought to excite us
[1:29:08] the Bible says we're Lively stones
[1:29:11] we're living Epistles
[1:29:13] amen First Peter chapter 2 First Peter
[1:29:16] chapter 2 verse 8.
[1:29:18] now we know everybody that we bring to
[1:29:20] this message isn't going to receive it
[1:29:24] and people are going to stumble they may
[1:29:27] walk a while and they may stumble
[1:29:31] First Peter chapter 2 verse 8 says and a
[1:29:33] stumbling a stone of stumbling and a
[1:29:36] rock of offense
[1:29:37] even to them which stumble
[1:29:41] at the word see they don't stumble at
[1:29:43] you
[1:29:44] they stumble at the word
[1:29:46] the word being disobedient
[1:29:49] they pick in in choosing
[1:29:52] what they want to obey
[1:29:54] where and to also they were appointed
[1:29:59] but that's some people
[1:30:01] but you
[1:30:03] are a chosen generation
[1:30:05] God has chosen you
[1:30:09] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:30:14] peculiar people you're just an oddball
[1:30:18] you're so peculiar what makes you so
[1:30:21] peculiar that you should show forth the
[1:30:24] Praises of him who have called you out
[1:30:27] of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[1:30:31] amen
[1:30:32] That's What Makes You peculiar
[1:30:36] because you're praising him
[1:30:40] he brought me out of Darkness he's
[1:30:43] brought me until I'm going to the house
[1:30:44] Lord why because I'm going to receive
[1:30:46] more light
[1:30:47] that's why I'm going to the house of the
[1:30:48] Lord to receive more light for my life
[1:30:52] you know I'm anxious to walk in it too
[1:30:54] because I I have learned that when I
[1:30:57] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:30:58] then I can have Fellowship more
[1:31:00] fellowship with him and one another
[1:31:04] which in times past
[1:31:07] were not a people but are now the people
[1:31:10] of God which had not obtained Mercy but
[1:31:12] now have obtained Mercy
[1:31:17] how many thankful for that Mercy
[1:31:19] the mercy that re-rolled and it's still
[1:31:21] re-rolling our life
[1:31:23] let's not forget all his benefits
[1:31:26] let's not forget to communicate with God
[1:31:27] to praise him
[1:31:29] sometimes we just forget to praise him
[1:31:33] I tell you we don't we may not forget to
[1:31:35] tell them what we want
[1:31:38] right
[1:31:40] I want this Lori
[1:31:42] but we forget to praise him
[1:31:44] Hebrews 13 15 says by him therefore let
[1:31:47] us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[1:31:50] continually
[1:31:52] that is the very fruit of our lips
[1:31:55] giving thanks to his name
[1:31:58] but to do good and to communicate
[1:32:02] forget not
[1:32:04] God does not want us to forget to give
[1:32:08] thanks to his name
[1:32:10] for with such sacrifices God is well
[1:32:14] pleased
[1:32:15] how many wants to please God well
[1:32:18] amen remain grateful abound in
[1:32:22] Thanksgiving
[1:32:28] Philippians chapter 4 verse 6 I got to
[1:32:30] just skip some stuff because it's
[1:32:32] running
[1:32:33] very late God demands the respect
[1:32:38] of Praise of Thanksgiving of gratitude
[1:32:42] just a heart of gratitude
[1:32:45] you know if we're so full of gratitude
[1:32:47] just so full of it
[1:32:49] we'll be blinded to one another's
[1:32:52] hiccups
[1:32:56] we won't be staring at the problems that
[1:32:59] other people have
[1:33:03] you know if I was sitting out there and
[1:33:05] the preacher said that I'd really say
[1:33:06] Amen to that one
[1:33:09] I believe it I'm not one to say Amen to
[1:33:11] my own preaching
[1:33:14] Philippians 4 verse 6 be careful for
[1:33:17] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[1:33:19] supplication with Thanksgiving notice
[1:33:23] within everything with your prayers your
[1:33:25] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:33:29] requests be made known unto God
[1:33:33] now if you do that thing the right way
[1:33:36] here's the blessing and the peace of God
[1:33:38] which passeth all understanding shall
[1:33:40] keep your hearts and your minds through
[1:33:43] Christ Jesus
[1:33:44] stay hungry for God stay grateful for
[1:33:47] God
[1:33:48] just mix your prayers with Thanksgiving
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] There Were Ten lepers that came to Jesus
[1:33:55] only one abounded with Thanksgiving
[1:34:00] and when he came back Jesus the Bible
[1:34:03] says Jesus answered
[1:34:05] he said were there not ten cleansed
[1:34:11] were there not ten that received
[1:34:12] forgiveness
[1:34:16] he says but where are the nine
[1:34:22] there are not found that return to give
[1:34:24] glory to God Save The Stranger
[1:34:28] I just wonder sometimes
[1:34:31] where we're at
[1:34:35] I understand none of us got leprosy but
[1:34:37] leprosy is a type of sin which we all
[1:34:39] got
[1:34:41] and we all come and we we ask God to
[1:34:44] forgive us of our sins and he forgives
[1:34:46] us
[1:34:47] because he's faithful
[1:34:50] but I just wonder
[1:34:52] who's coming
[1:34:54] to abound in Thanksgiving
[1:34:58] who is that one that's coming
[1:35:01] should there not be all of us yes
[1:35:04] should we should we not be abounding you
[1:35:07] know you don't got to come to the altar
[1:35:08] just to to to to to seek him about a
[1:35:12] certain situation or to seek him about a
[1:35:15] closer walk which is important but you
[1:35:17] can come to the altar to give him thanks
[1:35:20] to abound with Thanksgiving let this be
[1:35:23] the place you meet God for everything
[1:35:27] I mean I believe God has answered a lot
[1:35:29] of prayers right here
[1:35:31] I believe God has met a lot of people
[1:35:33] right here
[1:35:34] a lot of needs
[1:35:36] but let this be the place
[1:35:38] that we can abound with Thanksgiving too
[1:35:41] When you pray abound with Thanksgiving
[1:35:46] I want to I want us to give God glory
[1:35:50] look what happened to Zacchaeus when
[1:35:53] when the real
[1:35:55] Joy Of God comes into a man's heart
[1:36:01] it'll change your very nature
[1:36:05] yes yes it will you won't just go back
[1:36:08] and say I'm sorry for the things I've
[1:36:11] done
[1:36:13] look at Zacchaeus
[1:36:15] he repaid four times I think it was for
[1:36:19] the wrongs he had done
[1:36:21] for the people he used
[1:36:24] I'm telling you
[1:36:26] he had God in his heart he was abounding
[1:36:29] in thankfulness
[1:36:31] oh my
[1:36:33] I wonder if there's any Zacchaeus is
[1:36:35] here today
[1:36:36] I wonder if there's anybody here that's
[1:36:39] been changed like Zacchaeus Was changed
[1:36:42] I'll tell you I I remember
[1:36:46] saying more than sorry
[1:36:51] you know here's the thing
[1:36:53] sometimes
[1:36:55] we're not sorry
[1:36:58] but we just say the word sorry
[1:37:02] and sometimes we just need to abound
[1:37:04] with Thanksgiving
[1:37:06] I'll tell you
[1:37:08] when you're forgiven of something
[1:37:10] aren't you grateful
[1:37:14] to express it
[1:37:16] press it express it
[1:37:20] if I if I hurt this brother here
[1:37:26] I did something to offend him
[1:37:29] just saying hey I'm sorry
[1:37:35] it just doesn't cut it with me
[1:37:39] it just doesn't cut it with me
[1:37:42] the least I could be is thankful for his
[1:37:44] forgiveness
[1:37:47] thankful that he understood that he's
[1:37:49] bearing with me praying with me being
[1:37:51] long suffering with me
[1:37:53] because that's what the scripture says
[1:37:55] forbearing one another in love
[1:37:57] that's what the Holy Ghost for the Holy
[1:37:59] Ghost is so we can get to so we can
[1:38:03] deal with one another and get along with
[1:38:05] one another better
[1:38:08] that's what the Holy Ghost is for
[1:38:10] it's not to keep your distance
[1:38:14] it's not to be standoffish
[1:38:17] to draw closer
[1:38:23] you got a pencil
[1:38:25] I just I'm going to do one but you just
[1:38:27] read the I'll say here's your homework
[1:38:29] for the next year read the book of
[1:38:31] Psalms
[1:38:32] read the book of Psalms it's just so
[1:38:35] filled with with Thanksgiving and praise
[1:38:38] and gratitude
[1:38:41] but I want to read this with you before
[1:38:42] we close because we got to eat Psalms 26
[1:38:46] verse 7. it says that I may publish
[1:38:51] with the voice of Thanksgiving
[1:38:54] publish publish you know what it means
[1:38:57] to publish yes

[1:39:14] do that
[1:39:16] but publish it
[1:39:18] publish it with the voice of
[1:39:21] Thanksgiving
[1:39:23] and tell of all thy wondrous works
[1:39:26] Lord
[1:39:28] I have loved the habitation
[1:39:30] of thy house
[1:39:32] I have loved it and the place
[1:39:36] where thine honor
[1:39:38] dwelleth
[1:39:40] that's why we've set this room right
[1:39:44] here aside
[1:39:46] for God himself
[1:39:50] to honor God himself everything that
[1:39:54] said everything that's done
[1:39:56] is all around God
[1:40:00] that's why we got church order when
[1:40:01] things get out of order we don't we take
[1:40:04] care of it we don't allow it
[1:40:06] right because God deserves to be
[1:40:09] respected

[1:40:50] that the push is pushing you to God
[1:40:55] and I hope at the time that you your
