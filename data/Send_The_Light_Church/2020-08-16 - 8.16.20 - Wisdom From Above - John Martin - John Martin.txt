that jesus promised to be here or just two or three i are gathered in his name he promised to be in the midst so we don't have to see him we don't have to feel them it's nice to have those things but just to know that jesus is with us amen amen let's look to the lord in prayer heavenly father we thank you lord that you've chosen to be with us knowing that you search the globe continuously looking for those who would be willing to worship you in spirit and in truth lord we love your truth we honor your truth here lord and we've brought you with us today and by your grace lord we can worship you we have worshipped you this morning in spirit and in truth and now lord our hearts have been prepared for your precious word lord we believe our heart is a good ground a betting place for what you have for us today lord lord if there would be any unbelief lord that would try to creep in lord that would try to hover in this room that would try to keep us from believing all your word we pray that you would rebuke it right now in the name of jesus christ send it back to the devil from whence it came lord we are your believing children and we believe your word from cover to cover lord build us up this morning in the most holy faith lord we love you we need you lord and we just commit this service in your hand and ask your blessings now on the reading of your precious word give you praise in jesus precious name amen and amen praise god turn with me if you would to the book of saint john or james chapter three james chapter three we just before we came up we got a uh a text from brother daryl wanted to to greet you all in the name of the lord he appreciated your prayers they've been released they're they're the culvert has gone from their them and and now they've been released want to continue to pray for their church there is uh there's over 60 people that are battling in their church and uh we are blessed we are blessed about it gather together today but let's continue to pray for their church amen one day they'll be able to get back together and sometimes we take for granted what we have but today we're thankful that the lord has given us this opportunity to gather together amen james chapter 3 verse number 17 and 18 before you're seated but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace and god bless you may be seated well i want to say amen to what brother uh ron had said we want to welcome all of our our our visitors and um so good to have brother marty and sister kathleen back not they've been with us every time in spirit but to have them with us it's a great blessing it's a great blessing for me they've been so faithful to pray for the ministry here for so many years and you can just count on them just and it has been an encouragement to me when i've been discouraged brother john you've been discouraged well for me to stand here and say that i am not mortal why would you even want to listen to me so we appreciate them very much well i don't know if you got the announcement but there's going to be a baptism and let me say there's going to be a number of baptisms next sunday at at least three amen but there may be more so let's pray amen that'll be at the pond at three o'clock give your time to eat praise god brother stan so good to see you amen amen that's what brother brown always says good to be seen while the one prerequisite for baptism is what repentance very important remember baptism does not put away the filth of our flesh it's an outward expression of really what's transpiring on the inside of the heart so repentance really has to do with the heart not the brain not what you think not what you're wearing but what's happening on the inside the heart tells the brain i want to start having a real relationship with god repentance is from the heart because god has been working on the heart and showing us to turn around turn our lives around so i want to say for those that are getting baptized ponder and pray about the things that are in your heart it will go a long ways in preparing the heart and that is it is so important so important because everybody that's been baptized looks back to the day that they were baptized many many many times it's like a steak and it's it's uh you know that you did it and you meant it with all your heart that's right amen our subject this morning is wisdom most all people have some wisdom but as we've learned we need more and most of us have come to church with our with our wisdom today we want to talk about a couple of different wisdoms unfortunately the wisdom that most people operate by automatically comes from an evil nature that we're born with and it's with us until we're out of here to see wisdom in action all the time people we we want to see wisdom we we we want to see it in action and from time to time we have seen people use wisdom but more often than that we've seen people not use wisdom [Music] i remember brother bruce young in the lord and we were in bible tabernacle downstairs and i i'll never forget watching brother johnson dealing with a very difficult person and uh this person was being fearful and and and uh not just the right spirit and and the wisdom of god was in demonstration before me and i don't know who seen it who didn't but i saw it and at that moment i thought to myself if i could just have 10 percent of the wisdom that this man has i will be ever grateful for it amen the wisdom of this world and the wisdom that we operate by a lot it's a natural wisdom it manipulates it's very deceptive it's crafty it's cunning it's always trying to work schemes basically the wisdom of that we're born with it lacks character people use it to get ahead in business often used on family members to to get what you want out of something we've all seen it used on tv shows this wisdom well if we do this and do this we can manipulate the situation this way that person will do that and we'll get what we want and i'll say i have seen this wisdom you so much in the church and people don't even realize it that they're using it they think it's god it's a dog eat dog mentality climb over others use them manipulate them but the end game is to get what you want that's with the wisdom that this world gives you worldly wisdom is the power to manipulate without the character to truly trust god to take care of it that's the john martin definition remember cain used worldly wisdom to get rid of abel so that god would have to accept him if you call yourself a christian then you need to serve me how many times we've seen that people know that christians are supposed to serve everybody so they come and they manipulate you that you have to do something for them to hold up to your end of the the the the deal of you being what you call yourself a christian then you need to serve me you need to give this to me you need to do things for me that is worldly wisdom instead of holding themselves accountable to the word right the word says if you just seek first the kingdom everything else will be added but since you can't trust the lord since you're not putting him first then you begin to manipulate with your worldly wisdom [Music] a lot of times people don't have a close enough relationship with god to trust them so they use others to get their knees met it's nothing but worldly wisdom often times religious leaders and lawyers in the in the scriptures would use worldly wisdom to try and manipulate jesus amen many many times never to any veil right you can't pull a fast one by god first corinthians chapter 3 verse 18. let no man deceive himself if any man among you seem to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain so the wisdom that comes from our first nature is really nothing to brag about let's take paul's advice and become a fool that we may be wise one time bailout he was the king of the moabites he was really stressed out honey has ever been stressed out before well then you can relate to bala he feared israel was going to take over and he was going to be out of control so in a desperate intent to regain control you ever been desperate to regain control of the situation he sends messengers to balaam to bail him out now balaam had a gift in his life like we all do we have all have some sort of gifts in our life like lucifer the problem with balaam was he wanted to make a market for his gift he wanted to benefit from the gift that god had given him the old nature likes using the gift that god has given them for their own fleshly benefits their own personal gain what god gave you is not to be shared with your glory it is for god's glory it's between you and god to be used for god you might also forget about all the attention being about yourself with the gift that god's given you it was never meant for that now when you've got time there's going to be about five scriptures that i'm going to give you to read because we just do not have time to go into them but you can read about this story in numbers 22 right and you may want to read a couple chapters after that but balaam he wanted the permissive will of god because god gave him a straight up answer to not go he was he could not trust the lord so his his whole ability was being able to control the situation through worldly wisdom so he offered a reward and you know you'll be my friend if you just like me a reward he offered a reward to get what he wanted which was control might be money it can be a lot of things that we can the devil would like to offer to gain control see the devil does not want god and control this church no sir laodicea they kicked out god man is in control of the worldly church today they're in need of nothing attitude but each time that balaam spoke against israel he never could speak against israel he could only bless how can you curse what god has blessed and this affiliated balak and he just all the more was angry and frustrated with the situation because he didn't have control and he's let no i'll give you everything i'll give you honor i'll let you be the main cheese so he's handed everything that he could and balaam wanted honor so bad he wanted others to look up at him so bad that he used his own worldly wisdom to get it instead of god's wisdom he taught and counseled others what to do in order to get what he wanted he taught others how to get what they want god was out of the picture completely they were both united together in scrutinizing to get what they wanted and each what they wanted was not what god wanted they were missing an important ingredient it is the fear of the lord today that's what they were missing turn with me if you would to james chapter 3 verse 13. we want to talk a little bit about the difference between natural wisdom and godly wisdom we want about to see clearly because we think wisdom is just wisdom every parent how many every every parent has said this at one time or another if they've had children of course parents have children so that was kind of silly thing to say i went by and i seen this sign the other day and the sign said estate sale by owner and i thought well i don't like those as much i like the estate sales that are not by the owners you get better deals i was also driving just two days ago i looked at my rear view mirror and everyone the family inside the car every one of them had masks on and it was so thankful that i was in my car because i wouldn't want to be in that car james chapter 3 verse 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you well we'd all want to stand up and say brother john that is me well look what you got to do to do that to claim that let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if ye have bitter envion strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly worldly central natural devilish for where envion and strife is there is confusion and every evil work any type of jealousy any type of negativity having to talk bad about someone thinking wrong thoughts about someone natural worldly wisdom is filled with drama how can i rearrange this situation to get what i'm looking for even if what you're looking for is better than what is happening you don't want to use worldly wisdom to get it you want the wisdom from above yes the wisdom that's from above is first pure then peaceable it's gentle easy to be treated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown of them that make peace the natural wisdom of this world manipulates and is often associated with confusion but godly wisdom is first pure in other words it doesn't have any mixed motives it's purely simple it's simply pure if i could say it like that i mean if you want a glass of water and you're hot and thirsty and but you don't want it mixed with something you just want pure water and if you have a chance to get pure water or something that's just kind of been sitting out for a long time what are you going to grab so you don't want to mix you don't want to have mixed motives you don't want to mix the wisdom of god with your wisdom you don't want to have both of them try to simultaneously working together because they won't god just separate from it brother branham told us to always check our motive to make sure we want to make sure it's not mixed because a lot of the times we can look at our our situation and we we look at our heart and our motives and we say well i know my my heart's right my my mother's right i can just because this is why i'm doing it but you're not being you're not being honest and careful enough to look at the rest of your heart and the rest of your motives how many times you talk to somebody is that i'm usually picking on for the mark but you go to someone and you say yeah i really you know like that shirt and you know you're doing good with this and that but you know the real reason i'm trying to talk to you is because i want to get something out of you so you see part of your motive is good i'm trying to be nice i'm i'm saying something i'm trying to make it connect but then there's something else involved there so it's not pure think about this we operate by worldly wisdom so much more than godly wisdom and what's important about this is you've got to get rid of the one amen amen godly wisdom is always peaceable it's always making peace there's no hidden agenda it's never trying to manipulate the situation it's just peaceable you don't feel attacked or uncomfortable around godly wisdom it's gentle it's easy to be entreated instead of judging others with our natural worldly wisdom godly wisdom is full of mercy full of good fruits instead of singling out somebody godly wisdom is without partiality no respect to persons no no hypocrisy godly wisdom is from heaven and you cannot mix it with your wisdom as soon as you do you pollute it worldly wisdom is not just going to get rid of your wisdom god says you got to get rid of your worldly wisdom first and then i'll fill you yes god god needs you wants you expects you to choose him first amen the only wisdom that we're born with is a sneaky conniving devilish wisdom that we use to deceive others i cannot recall the first time that i deceived my parents i was so young when it happened the strange thing is that my parents did not send me to schooling to know how to do this and they didn't set me down and say this is how i'm going to deceive you but they would say if you do your chores i'll let you stay up an extra half hour that was we used worldly wisdom to try to make it in this life it's not always pure well i'm brother mark just be for a moment pretend you're my child for a second you did wrong and i'm gonna spank you i'm so mad at you wait you shouldn't spank me be out of anger i'm not i'm spanking you because you did wrong but really i'm still mad on the inside see mixed motive mixed wisdom as it were confusion child should not be confused about correction the church should not be confused about correction [Applause] the yeah the naya's name i'll tell you what brings confusion is wrongly wisdom why is it so hard to leave here and take the word of god with you why do we sit here and debate well i don't know if i should have to do that that's just john's opinion that's confusion that's real worldly wisdom we're missing the fear of the lord amen i want to say this morning even though we were born with that wisdom the good news is that god has some godly wisdom for us this morning it's from above it's not partial about sharing with anyone there's no respect to persons the bible says annie turn with me to james chapter one verse five if any of you lack wisdom is lacking wisdom maybe see your hands if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him now there's the promise you don't have to be going to this church to get wisdom not sure many churches will teach what true wisdom is but know for sure that if you're lacking wisdom and you want it god will hand it out one important criteria about receiving godly wisdom is stated in verse six we need to stay the course of our pursuit for but let him ask in faith not wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of lord not just wisdom but anything of the lord for a double-minded man is unstable in every single thing so we've got to have confidence that god wants you to have it you can't be questioned at times whether you're going to get it or not because you failed or messed up or this thing happened or you're not good enough none of us are good enough none of us are worthy enough none of us have passed some sort of test whereby we can be acceptable to god you've got to not only ask in faith but you can't waver back and forth after you've asked for it you've got to stay the course you've got to remember your prayer remember your pursuit wisdom will come if you want it bad enough but if you don't want it bad enough or if you think you know a pretty good guy i think i can i got pretty good wisdom right now the devil will never pursue god's wisdom why are you saying that because the wisdom that's inside of us that we were born with isn't that interested in god's wisdom it thinks it can handle life good enough the devil's wisdom is proud forward arrogant and while god's wisdom is humble it's sweet it's gentle the devil's wisdom started the whole mess in the garden when he told eve what she could get out of the situation if she just followed the nature of worldly wisdom instead of god's wisdom worldly wisdom has gotten all of us here in this room in so much trouble in the past worldly wisdom tells the church world that they can make it to heaven without following all the word as long as they do this and this and this then they're saved worldly wisdom will make a man leave church critical arrogant bothered who is he to tell me look the way he made me feel he can't be a right that's worldly wisdom worldly wisdom will make a man think he's better than somebody else remember the two men that went into the prayer room together to pray one was just thanking god that he was not like the other that he could prove by his life that he was better amen but that was just a worldly wisdom the other one knew he was just unworthy without god he was nothing amen now that's the wisdom from above amen the devil's wisdom is as we've heard before prouder than a peacock the wisdom of god is so humble that most people miss it it's hidden simplicity and there's a great battle when we come to church it's the two wisdoms that are going inside of every one of us we maybe come in with oh i'm so much i want the word i'm just so geared up i'm i'm just going to praise the lord i'm so happy about church i'm going to come in and we hear the word and it kind of like deals with your heart and all sudden worldly wisdom pops its head up and says yes and then also there's that battle and one way to get rid of it is just pitch it off pitch it off on somebody else sorry christine pitch it off and somebody else mark can take my pitching the wisdom of god is always trying to get each one of us to humble ourselves to believe the word our natural wisdom can act haughty and arrogant and proud because it don't need to receive what's being said that i don't even need to be here you're blessed just because of my presence our natural wisdom has to understand it and agree with something before we'll believe it [Applause] in other words it leans to its own understanding when you get time read matthew chapter four and see these two wisdoms battled together as jesus and the devil the devil's wisdom reasons with natural feelings that's what he tried to do he tried to get jesus to to to to look at his feelings how he was feeling hungry or to reason with the word to get what he wanted while godly wisdom stays with the word it believes the word in order to get what god wants see your feelings will lean to your own understanding it will lean worldly wisdom wants you to lean towards natural feelings and understandings for what reason to get what you want and god wants you to look to the word trust him believe him to get what god wants one is what what we want and two is the other is what god wants it is the devil's wisdom versus the faith in god another place you can read is in second kings chapter five write that down with naaman naaman was using his wisdom i thought god would come and do this and do it this way and if i really have to do any why can't i go to the clean waters his own understanding but then he had a servant that was so humble he was a servant servants are humble that's why they serve and he had the wisdom that's from above wouldn't it be better just to believe the word just follow what the word says yes and when you do it'll bring the desired results wisdom will always lead you where you need to go in our pursuit for the wisdom that comes from above god requires a complete surrender get rid of it moses was filled with the wisdom of the world but god required a complete surrender before he would use him had to get rid of it put him through so much to he was nothing so i'll say it like today the wisdom that you got get rid of it make room for god's wisdom well i am not brother john you asking me to get rid of the wisdom to to to fix a flat tire no i'm talking like that i'm talking about your canadian ways of being able to figure something out when you really don't even know what you're talking about that's what i'm talking about amen a lot of times we talk as if we know something that's not the wisdom from above you can read about moses there in exodus chapter 2 and chapter 3. so brother john how does a person know they're on the right track to getting wisdom he wants to know amen we can find the answer plainly in proverbs but before we go there i want to give you a little background about solomon solomon was just a boy right around 15 years old when he became king and you know how most 15 year old boys are they are not fit to be just tied and tied to a tree and stay there till they reach a better age you know they know more than their parents they're saying things like i can't wait to mold enough i'm out of here he was sure lacking wisdom and god appeared to the boy in a dream and asked what will i give thee god appeared to solomon just ask the question what will i give thee and i'm sure he had crossed his mind more than once that he was going to become king and he was going to be in charge and be able to tell people what to do and maybe get rich and get all his video games and pursue his boy dreams most young boys would probably waste everything that's given to them but he took this situation serious amen the hour that he was living in the task that god gave him to be king he took it seriously and the boy solomon realized that he didn't have what got what he needed to do what god asked him to do think about this god called him to be king but he didn't have what it took to be king that's just the way god is he calls you to be a parent when you've never been a parent before he calls you to drive a car when you've never driven a car before and so what it is is you have to learn along the way so solomon he was concerned about not having what he needed to do what god wanted to do a lot of times we try to do something for god and we think we got it all right i'm so good i'm so you know what i can't wait till they hear me you know when i go i'm gonna i'm gonna talk to them and i'm gonna just win them to the lord and and they don't like me anymore that is the truth he didn't arguably think he could just handle with his own ability the same when being called to be a deacon you certainly don't want to choose somebody who's just anxious at the idea of being a deacon when you don't have the right spirit has nothing to do with age has to do with maturity of spirit even the bible tells us you don't want to choose a novice because he can get caught up in thinking that he's something and take advantage of the opportunity when he gets behind the pulpit to express himself instead of leaving this an honor to help people get to christ to look to jesus and not to look to self so what did solomon do in his predicament he asked god for wisdom that he might know how to go in and out so great of people i wonder how many times that we ask for wisdom to help one another in the church instead of i'm just gonna you know what i'm just gonna being a king he could have asked god for anything but he only asked god for what he needed to carry out what god called him to do as a right spear turn with me to first kings chapter 3. first kings chapter 3 verse 6 and solomon said thou has showed unto thy servant david so he's responding back to the question now my father great mercy according as he has walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and a brightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness and thou has given him a son to sit on the throne as it is this day and now o lord my god thou has made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am a little child and i know not how to go out or to come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen are great people that cannot be numbered nor accounted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people an understanding heart yes amen now it's not the judgment that you're thinking not the judgment where i'm going to put you in your place not that judgment that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people and i love this verse and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing you want you want to find favor you want to please the lord think of the last thing that god asked you to do and then ask him for what you need to accomplish it amen and you'll find favor with the lord amen and god said unto him because thou has asked this thing and has not asked for thyself long life neither has asked riches for thyself nor has asked life of thine enemies that's the worldly wisdom [Applause] i'm going to show him i'm going to show her but has asked for thy self-understanding to discern judgment that is so beautiful behold i have done according to thy words oh my once you want god to do something according to your words well you have not because you ask not right but when you do ask make sure you ask what he's wanting you to ask of course it could be a mess and lo i have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there is none like the before thee neither after thee shall they arise like unto thee and i have also given thee that which does not ask seek ye first the kingdom and all other things shall be added unto you amen both riches and honor so that they shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days and if thou will walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father did then i will lengthen thy days now keep this in mind he god spoke the word but he still left the door open for solomon's choices along the way we just think it's a done deal well i'm pretty sure the son of god i'm going you know that that spirit will get you into trouble that is not the spirit that is not the true spirit of predestination that's the wisdom that comes from down here it's a it's a earthly mindset of a spiritual thing proverbs chapter 1 verse 1 the proverb of solomon the son of david king of israel all right what are proverbs to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom justice judgment and equity to give subpility to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion a wise man will hear praise god and will increase in learning amen and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels how many times have you tried talking to somebody you told me exactly this is it and they said yeah i'll leave it go with that you don't understand brother john that might have worked for you but that won't work for me my situation is different i tried the lord before it didn't work i watched some christian they were a hypocrite well who isn't right who hasn't failed who can say i have not sinned i have not yelled i have not got upset i have not just wanted to quit we've all tried to help somebody and they didn't want to listen they didn't want to learn but a wise man will hear and increase learning a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels to understand a proverb in the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark saiyans the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction and we thought it was just our kids who didn't want to listen to us but in reality since we got kids and we're how many times when you were trying to help your kid something bro came back to your memory you used to be the same way when when you were younger what is just so you have a clear understanding of this our old nature is still there amen and it can pop up anytime and act the same way amen it may not do it so much to our earthly fathers anymore but it can act that way towards our heavenly father when he tries to give us his word [Applause] and we begin to get a little rebellious or i want to do it my way so there's a great battle that goes on not only in our church but in our lives proverbs chapter 9 verse 10 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding for by me that is by wisdom thy day shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increased and that's the same thing that he told solomon you asked for the right thing i'm going to give you wisdom and you know what's going to come length of days yes the fear of the lord when we are in pursuit for wisdom head directly for the fear of the lord do not look at the fear of the lord as an object as a thing as a person as a place as some sort of thing that is tangent that you're going after the fear of the lord is simply the condition of your heart and editor it's awful quiet the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom so the condition of your heart is what is necessary to get what you're looking for don't be looking out here and hoping to get some wisdom when we go to church or when we read this this bible or we we listen to a tape or we talk to this counselor the fear of the lord is the condition of your heart yes so it's about pursuing a proper condition here it's a choice that you make to humble yourself to choose the harder way that you really don't know amen that you really don't know or well if it be the will of the lord and you mean it from your heart not well i'm going there the lord willing and you go no matter what i'm just going to use these words because they're message words spiritual they're my christian front but it's we're talking about a condition of a heart yes brother says i could be wrong about this that's what fear of the lord is right well i better not lean to my own understanding it looks like this but i better not lean towards it that's the fear of the lord that is the condition of your heart it's a humble heart now after you've chosen to believe that you're going to receive wisdom right that's what we read at the we got to first believe well after we've chosen to believe then we simply have to humble ourself if that don't happen you won't get it first peter i believe it's peter first peter chapter 5 verse 5 and be clothed with humility just put to be close with it now we're all clothed on the outside but you don't clothe the outside of yourself with humility the pharisees tried they act a certain way but inside they were so proud no one could tell them anything they weren't clothed with humility for god resist the wisdom of this world yes proud but he gives grace to the humble yes humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may show you the way yes that's why we want wisdom isn't it to know what to do to know how to handle a situation to take care of something is that not what the wisdom of god is for james said the same thing god resists the proud and giveth more grace to the humble james chapter 4 verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil right amen resist the devil and he will flee from you resist the devil in other words feeding your mind with i already know what to do i mean some people have so much pride the armor is so thick it is so shiny it is so glittery you can see it a mile away you know what i like about this message today is that i have not made mention of any names but every one of us battle it and also today i just want to expose worldly wisdom and if we could just pursue a condition in our heart then we'll receive from the lord the direction that we're supposed to go because remember the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom in other words wisdom will not come without the right condition of your heart amen amen verse 8 draw an eye to god and he'll draw an eye to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts what ye double-minded remember a double-minded man is not going to receive anything of the lord no wisdom so you got to get rid of this double-mindedness sometimes pursuing and leaning on your own wisdom sometimes saying oh again i gotta lean on god no you've got to make a decision i'm staying with the word i'm believing the word i'm forsaking my own understanding you've got to make clear-cut decisions about the the spirit inside of you is it humble and don't really know or is it proud and thinks it knows be afflicted and mourn weep let your laughter return into mourning and your joy into heaviness in other words this is the way to condition your heart to get wisdom to find favor with god amen brother john i'll say amendment i believe somebody else is saying i'd be saying amen to it you know i'm not a mentor to my own word but i do amen the word humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up no god loves me he's still going to lift me up anyways i'm his speak not evil one of another brother he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law for if thou judge the law thou are not a jew or the law but a judge in other words god will never lift you up when you're pointing a finger [Applause] amen when you say something to hurt somebody's influence a little bit that's worldly wisdom god will leave you right there in a time of need well i thought you had it figured out back then when you were acting like that what do you need me for now we've got to humble ourselves in the sight of the lord well how do i do that now i can't just humble myself in in in in in the sight of brother stan i gotta do it this side of the lord well he's the only one that sees my heart but i'll say this when you're clothed with humility everyone sees it because it's christ he dwells with the humble with the lowly with the contrite you know what he's there for to revive to lift up to strengthen to give us what wisdom is supposed to do for us proverbs chapter 8 verse 13 the fear of the lord is to hate evil not the evil that's in your brother and sister the evil that's inside of you because that's where the fear of the lord is it's easy for me to hate all those people that are killing and you know all these people making me do these things and quarantine me out but to hate the evil that's inside of me amen that's the fear of the lord there's no fear of the lord looking at this brother and saying you know every single time you do the same thing to me and make me look bad in front of everybody it's easy to hate that but to hate when my flesh tries to rise up amen oh no we protect that we think that's okay that's just normal that's just uh you know i live with that and that's okay that is not okay that's really wisdom for the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy the evil way and the fallen mouth do i hate wisdom hates that the wisdom of god hates that proverbs chapter 15 verse 33 for the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility yes i'm just going to say it like this before wisdom can be executed there needs to be a spirit of i could be wrong amen the wisdom of the lord is simply walking around believing you don't know what to do it's walking around with that spirit it's possessing this it's not just once in a while you know i'm gonna let show that little badge right yeah i'll just stand i don't know put it back in my pocket and act like i know well i'm just going to be honest right now in front of everybody you know i really don't know what to do but 90 of the time walking around with the spirit of i know what to do i know how to handle life and you call that the wisdom of god number one the wisdom of god don't act like that amen amen it's a condition of your heart that you don't just get it and say well i got it and i'll pull it out when i need it it's something that you walk around with so every time somebody sees you they're not seeing some know it all right some person that thinks they look god told me this and not doing this and this is this and that and you know what i don't even listen to that scripture the lord willing because i already know the joy of the lord what do you know worldly wisdom knows everything the wisdom of god knows nothing except i fear the lord i trust him he's going to work out this situation he's going to put words in my mouth he's going to tell me what to say he's going to show me what to do it's going to bring the results he wants and not what i want because i believe in the wisdom of god a different spirit where natural carnal worldly wisdom is walking around believing you're right 90 of the time where did you read that brother john i didn't i got it this morning ninety percent of the time i know hi this is what i know that's worldly wisdom that's why it's associated with debate drama envy because you're believing you're always right and you're going to prove you're right you're going to do this to prove you're right it's worldly wisdom you respect your persons we're acting hypocritically with godly wisdom there's no drama there's no strife because you know you could be wrong the way you're looking at the situation therefore you're sowing peace it's full you're full of mercy and you're full of good fruits because you really don't know not like i know you catch what i'm saying it's a spirit it's a spirit that you have and not about knowledge about what's right or wrong it's about how you act true spirit of god inside of a human being doesn't walk around knowing how did god let the prophet walk around so long believing certain things when it didn't happen believing the seals meant this that i should go here didn't it why wouldn't god tell him that why he's walking down the street don't even know where he's going same thing abraham happened go leave didn't even know where he was going he just followed the lord we god doesn't tell us everything why do we act like we know everything you got to get rid of that get rid of it get rid of it don't think that nobody sees it it's been seen for a long time walk around i really don't know brother i'm just trusting the lord the lord's going to work that situation out amen lord's going to just deal with those hearts god's going to move by his spirit i'm trusting in the almighty amen i'm not leading to my own understanding god shall prevail that's the wisdom of the lord it's the beginning of what will come about when the condition of your heart is i could be wrong you're fearing the lord you're respecting not hey god me and you're on the same page man we got this thing all figured out god even if god did tell you right he would you would never act like that you'd probably just just praying with your brother just praying with your sister choose stand with me choose to seek after the wisdom from above i said stand with me didn't you hear that are you listening to me you're listening anything i'm saying i mean i i got some other scriptures if you want to go through them you have to make a choice to seek after the wisdom from above choose to walk around with the spirit that you could be wrong you may not be used to it and i'm not saying anything negative by that if you feel uncomfortable in that nature god will bless you for it amen but you got to take that first step forward into get rid of your wisdom walk around with that spirit just don't show it once in a while walk with it it is the beginning of wisdom it is the beginning of where wisdom wants to take us a lot of times when we're praying for wisdom is how to talk to somebody how to deal with a certain situation how to work this little thing out that's what we're all praying for wisdom about lord show me we want that end result god says don't worry about that end result you worry about fearing me humble yourself walk in humility that's trust in the lord by the way and god would just put words in your mouth he'll lead you what to do we've all seen the wisdom of god in our life just happened we stand back you think oh you didn't even have anything to do with it it was all god and then we've all stepped back to something that we try to do in our foots in our mouth and this didn't happen and it caused this separation confusion strife come on look at there's a difference we got to pursue it two scriptures proverbs chapter 22 verse 4 by humility and the fear of the lord our riches in honor and life amen and i love proverbs 14 verse 27 for the fear of the lord is a fountain of life we're all looking for the fountain of life aren't we want to be young again the fear of the lord praise the lord bow your hearts with me amen with every heart bowed maybe there's someone today that's willing to let your wisdom go the way that you've been looking at handling situations with your own abilities you want to let that go praise god bless these hands these hearts wow god sees sees that humble heart that's so beautiful i'm believing with you god does not bring a word to fall to the ground god brings a word to fall in the hearts of his people heavenly father we come to you lord one thing that we all could save assuredly that we need more wisdom from above but lord we know that though you are willing to give it to everyone that would ask you've reserved it for those who will humble themselves before you and i pray for every hand that was lifted lord as we leave here as we go our ways as we travel on our jobs and do the things that we're going to be doing in our homes and lord we know that we're going to face situations that we really don't know how to handle we

frustrated they are how bothered how angry how hopeless it may seem to just trust you lord that you'll work everything out lord when we're tempted to lean to our own conniving devilish worldly wisdom
