and may you just come and walk amongst us in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen if you'll turn with me this morning to Isaiah chapter 9 amen praise the Lord Isaiah chapter 9:6 it says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen amen amen amen you may be seated you know the scriptures are alive amen and and they're always unfolding so it's always kind of difficult though it's it's good around the holidays and that that we look at scriptures and things that we normally don't look at during the year you don't really preach about the wise men in the middle of July or August people are scratching their heads so being that this Wednesday is Christmas and brother John so graciously ran away so why Bethlehem that's the question why God you know he knows all things so he's omnip omnipotent which means he's all powerful F he's omnipresent which means he exists everywhere he's not omniscient and he knows all things even when the world before there ever was a star in the heavens you think about it even before God created light and before he created everything and he was alone with his thoughts and he looked at all the things that he all the attributes that he wanted to express to to his family amen and his family was just a thought he wanted to express himself to them he wanted to show them he was a savior but he couldn't show them he was a savior unless something fell and then he he wanted to show that he was a Healer but somebody had to be sick before he could do that and because he knows all things and he has everything God before he even the Bible tells us plainly it says before the foundation of the world Christ was even slain he was slain before the world ever even came into existence and here was God already knowing that he was going to make this promise unto us a child is born he already had made the idea he knew that man could not experience him as a spirit we couldn't if we were just a cloud or a spirit you know when God created Adam he created him in a spirit form but that wasn't what God wanted God wanted flesh and blood that he could that he could fellowship with so he knew that when man fell that he would have to become the kinsman redeemer he knew he would have to come down and step into a robe of Flesh and he had to he had to come down and become Kinsmen with man and experience the things that man did experience so because God knows all these things why would he choose Bethlehem why would he choose that of all the places that are in Palestine and in their there's many great cities many locations cities that are seemingly much more known in the lore of history and better foretold bigger cities so why should God choose little Bethlehem to be the birthplace of his son why would he choose Bethlehem to be the place where he would come down and step into flesh amen there are many places that are greater for instance there's the historical lore of Jerusalem the proud Jerusalem the capital of it all and it's one of the largest cities in Palestine and then we wonder why God would pick some little tiny insignificant town like Bethlehem instead of Jerusalem if the temple was in Jerusalem and he put his name there and and the pillar of fire came down there that would be a great place that if you were going to come down in fellowship with man why wouldn't you choose Jerusalem but as the scriptures has said what God has determined to do it will be done amen so I like that God has already pre-planned everything that's going to happen to us tomorrow next week next year everything God has all otherwise he's otherwise he's not all knowing and if you can't have confidence that God is is leading you then you miss the whole concept of what he's trying to do amen you miss the whole concept so what God has determined to do it'll be done and there it is so God foreordained it to be that way and or it never would have been that way and that's what the scripture says in the 15th chapter of Acts it says there is nothing by chance God knowed everything it just didn't happen to happen that way God made it that way and then we see with our little finite Minds we begin to think over then why would the great king of Heaven choose a little place like that instead of the capital of Judea why why would he look at such a little place and there are many places that have a greater spiritual background than what Bethlehem has for instance some of the places like Shiloh Shiloh was an ancient worship place of Israel where they came year by year so if you go back and you look at what happened in Joshua 18 there's the first mention of the city of Shiloh and when the children of Israel if you go and look at the map and it's always good to look at the map because it Moses talked about this side of Jordan and that side of Jordan well this side of Jordan actually is the country of Jordan so they came up on the east side of the Jordan River and crossed Westerly they went Westerly into the land of Canaan across Jordan River and when they first came across you all know the story and and I could have given lots of scriptures to Amanda she'd have been she'd have had miles but when they came across the priests they took the Ark of the Covenant and when they stepped into the water the water jelled up and they walked across from east to west into um into Canaan and then they went up and they in the northern part of the the country and the northern part of the country they made this place called um did I get are we talking about Shiloh good cuz that's gilgal so anyways when they that when they went across when they came across the very first thing they had to do is they had to go up in the northern part of Israel and set a place up for the Tabernacle a resting place for the Tabernacle and that was Shiloh and it's mentioned in Joshua 18 and it's a located about 19 miles north of Jerusalem on in the West Bank and the Tabernacle was first set up there as a place for worship and the thing that's interesting about that is that Israel came to Shiloh for over 1300 or over 300 years during the Book of Judges and that was a place of worship it was God's first place of worship for Israel why wouldn't God just choose Shiloh then amen when you go over and you look in 1st Samuel 1 you find out that that was the place where Hannah went up to Shiloh when she went up there and she prayed earnestly before God because God had caused her to be Barren and God gave her a promise of one of the greatest prophets in the Old Testament Samuel came to to Hannah and Hannah went back to Shilo she didn't go to Jerusalem she went up to Shiloh and she went up there and she and she dedicated Samuel back to God at Shiloh and sha and Samuel ends up being actually the last of the great judges the prophet judges that watched over Israel before Israel gave it all up for King Samuel was the last one amen so why wouldn't God just pick a place like Shiloh a place where the Tabernacle first appeared and then there's gilgal which is another spiritual place of worship why wouldn't he let him be born in gilgal so we find out that when the children of Israel will go back now when they crossed over the Jordan River when they crossed over the very first place the very first thing that God had Joshua do when they crossed over the Jordan River he took one Prince out of each of the 12 tribes and they picked up a stone out of the river and they went and they made a memorial to show that God had separated them they were now coming out of the world and they were now going into the promised land and he said let this be a place of a memorial for you it's a place they called it gilgal and it's also the place where God in reintroduced the children of Israel to circumcision they could not they couldn't become into the abrahamic Covenant without being circumcised because that was a covenant that God had made with them and neither can the believer the believer's got to come out of the world he's got to come across to gilgal and he's got to sacrifice his flesh he's got to sacrifice his life or he can't even move on into the promised land amen it was east of Jericho it's before the very first battle the biggest battle that Israel had the very first big battle before that they had to come to gilgal what a place of significance why wouldn't God just choose gilgal amen it's on the eastern border of Jericho it's between Jericho and the Jordan River and God renewed The Covenant the Covenant of circum circumcision there before the children of Israel could proceed into the land of Canaan amen amen amen so God could have done any of those things he could have chosen Sho he could have ch chosen gilgal he could have chosen another place Zion amen there was another place Zion and Zion was on the Mountaintop and he says you wonder why Jesus would not be born there then in Zion because it's a great historical Mark for the Lord had blessed his people in the ages amen we don't sing it much around here but where we used in Detroit we sing this on the top of Mount Zion is a city and the Earth with its Glory it doth fill I shall look on its beauty in the morning when I I reach that City on the hill Oh that City on Mount Zion though a pilgrim yet I love thee still I'll not leave thee Through the Ages when I reach that City on the hill why wouldn't God choose Zion why wouldn't he choose Zion well I don't know if you knew this Zion was a fortified stronghold of the jebusites and it was on a Mountaintop and when we get over in a second and that's first identified in Joshua 15 but in 2 Samuel 5 David he went up to the jebusites he got up there and he said hey I want this mountain I want this place called Zion he says I want it and he took it from the jebusites and the Mount Zion then became renamed as Jerusalem the city of David praise the Lord amen so why wouldn't God want that place to come you know he even prophesied he said suddenly the Lord himself shall appear at the temple why wouldn't God be born in Jerusalem amen praise the Lord amen amen it looks like he would have chosen Zion or gilgal or Shiloh or one of these other great places where there had been great blessings and great teachings and there's other great cities in Israel amen such as heon which is a place of Refuge for a man wanting a City of Refuge a place of safety and there was six of those Moses God told Moses in numbers 35 he says I need you to make a place of Refuge but when you make a mistake and the devil's coming after you and God himself is standing in your way to bring judgment upon you there's a place of Refuge where you can go there was three Cities of Refuge on the east side of Jordan where Gad and Reuben settled because they were they were Cattlemen and they said the land is good for us this is where we want to have it amen so there was three cities on the east side of Jordan and then there were three cities on the west side of Jordan amen in Hebrew heam was one of those cities amen it was a place of Refuge it was a place of safety it was a place where you could go and no matter how mad somebody was at you no matter how much they didn't like you they couldn't come in and avenge they could not enter that City of Refuge and as long as you stayed there God's mercy if you look at the at the um at the Ten Commandments and all the laws that are written out in the Book of Leviticus there isn't much Mercy in there you make a mistake you're finished and I'm glad that God had a place of Mercy for the believer amen amen so brother brandom said he says so he said why couldn't God have chosen heon why couldn't he have caused so in Joshua 20 on the east side in the North where we now call the Golan Heights it was the Golan back then there was a city it was called Golan it was in Bashan of GAD and then rth Gilead was in the center of the city or in the center of the land and then beaser which was in the South was in the wilderness of Reuben and those three were all on that side of Jordan a place of Mercy a place of Mercy if you crossed over Jordan and you were in the in canaan's land and you found yourself that by accident you killed somebody and they were to die and the the law said uh eye for an eye a tooth for tooth arm for an arm leg for a leg you knew you're in trouble there was a there was three places in Canaan amen there was cadesh which was in the north part in Galilee there was sesim which was in the area where that Ephraim settled down in and then there was heam in the South and that was in the land that was given away to Judah Amen in any one of those cities Jesus Christ is the only one that came and brought us Mercy look at the Pharisees and the Sadducees oh they didn't have no mercy they didn't have any Mercy on anybody you either belong to us or we kick you out of the church if you believe in this Jesus Christ guy we're going to excomm you at you you can't you have no more sacrificial lamb they were there was no place of Refuge but Jesus Christ could have been born in heam he could have been born in rth Gilead he could have been born in beaser he could have been born in any of these places that showed Mercy Amen brother Bram said so maybe if I'd have been thinking I would have brought him over to cadesh Baria I'd have brought him over there for there was the Judgment seat a place of Refuge amen he says perhaps I would have brought him over into that country for his birthplace or maybe would have chosen some of these other cities but you know I'm so glad that even just little insignificant things in the Bible mean so much I want you to think about that you know brother John he talks about got the vision going beyond the curtain of time and there's thousands and thousands and thousands running up to brother brandom and you a little insignificant but yet God has picked you up out of Flint or out of Fenton or out of the it's the surrounding City just look at how much God puts in the value of you am amen he could have picked better places but he picked you there's better people to pick than us right people that are much more righteous they didn't have as much baggage they don't have as many problems but God look down on you amen amen I want you to look at Genesis 49 if before we go further Genesis 49 Jacob is giving a blessing to all of his sons and here in verse eight it says Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise and thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies and thy father's children shall bow down before thee so Judah had a very important position to play Judah is a lion's welp from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he crouched as a lion as an old lion who shall raise him up and the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and until him shall be the Gathering of the people be so God chose when when Joshua came across and he he divided the land and he gave everybody a place Judah was a very important Place judah's inheritance was very important and we need to realize that in um Joseph's or Jacob's prophecy that his prophecy is actually talking about a lion of the tribe of Judah he's he's actually telling that that will be a place of leadership somebody will raise up out of Judah amen and Joshua dividing up divided up judah's portion and if you notice on the map it's geographically just west of the plain sea that's what brother bam called it but it's actually the sultan sea a few miles south of Jerusalem the capital and when Judah was getting her part or his part rather in the land his Province we would call it it's strange but the little city was not even mentioned Bethlehem yet it was there because at Abraham I believe it was Rebecca was buried in that place and I looked and it was actually um Rachel was buried in Bethlehem it wasn't called Bethlehem at that time but he says Rebecca was buried in that place and it must have been just a little village of some sort because if you read Joshua 5 you'll find out there was 115 major cities under the domain of Judah besides the villages and little towns 115 cities were mentioned and perhaps when it was divided up Bethlehem was so little maybe just a little house or two it wasn't even mentioned in the inheritance and then we find out that it never actually came to even be known think about it the spiritual significance of you sitting here this morning people read the Bible and they have no idea what they're looking at but God a little insignificant you little insignificant me God looked down and picked you amen picked you up how many people today are going to watch a live nativity scene oh look at the Cow oh look at all this look at everything and they're not even seeing that God wants to be alive in your heart amen what a great thing why Bethlehem a little insignificant Place amen and brother Brenham said he said in the beginning in Joshua 5 he says it was never even he it didn't even in before it was of many many years before it became known as that place and the one that founded it was Caleb son Caleb's son whose name was Solomon and if you go and and you do a study you'll find out in the scriptures that in some places it's interpreted Salon in other places it's PMA and he founded it the Bible said he was the father of it that's found in 1 Chronicles 2: 50 and 51 he said he was the founder of Bethlehem so in other words he must have moved in there and started some sort of business and Commercial and trading and so forth and then it grew up and later we'll find out that the real reason of it the whole lands was jealous of that little place of land which lays just to the north and east and slopes a little bit to the south on the spur it was the most fertile part of all of Palestine it was a Corn Belt it was a wheat belt and there were great Olive orchids there and it was in that part of Bethlehem or in Palestine at the end of judah's Province and if you go and you look at a map that shows where all the 12 tribes was Bethlehem lays right on the edge of the Border amen so we found out it it became the home of the Harlot Rahab we find out that Rahab it's it's important to know that Bethlehem was founded by Joshua's son or Caleb's son and Caleb's son was a general in the army of Israel and Rahab was a gentile she was a harlot she was a harlot she but she believed the message when it was presented to her she believed it an insignificant harlot in a city of wickedness she believed the message when it was presented to her and God gave her a promise if you put a Scarlet thread out the window he said when we come in in judgment strikes when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen we're a little insignificant we think oh my I pray all the time and and it just doesn't seem like anything's going my way brother sister just make sure the bloodline is shown if the bloodline is showing God will pass over you when judgment strikes it's a promise it was a promise to to Rahab the Harley and after the city fell Solomon he took a liking to Rahab and he married her and they moved to Bethlehem amen praise the Lord amen somebody who the promise belongs to and somebody that has no claim yet he took brother God took notice of you this morning amen can't say that enough that God took notice of you an insignificant Harlot not believ in the word of God being raised up with idols and and fallowing whatever you were taught but one day God looked down and took notice of you and picked you up amen amen and took you to Bethlehem a place where there's plenty to eat there's plenty to drink amen praise the Lord amen amen we find out it was because it became the home of Rahab which is the stories in Joshua chapter 2 when Israel passed over the borderline of the Jordan River into Palestine we are acquainted with the story of Rahab amen and God looked down when the Wrath fell and the trumpets began to blow God seen that scarlet cord hanging there as a memorial it always pleased him to pass over the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you he saw it and when the shaking and the Holy Spirit rumbles the Earth and shook Down the Walls 20 feet thick not one rock fell where that cord was hanging oh brother get the blood applied amen apply the blood apply the token to your house amen amen and she fell in love with this man was a captain and Prince of Judah and he was a captain of Israelite armies his name was Solomon just like the King Solomon and he was a captain and she become a great romance with him and he was a prince of Judah why wasn't he a prince of Ephraim or Reuben but see God before the fation in the world God saw it all and planned it all out so it could be an encouragement to you you am so that when you think about oh my this nothing's going right everything else you can look back in the scriptures and say but here God fulfilled his word and I'm believing that word I'm hiding it in my heart I'm saying Lord if you can do it for RAB you can do it for me amen amen praise the Lord amen she married him and when the estate was settled up for the Israelites she in her beloved husband they lived in Bethlehem amen and we find out it would become a great place and how beautiful it is to think of the great wheat country there and it would be the bread place of the world and it is true no wonder Jesus had to be born there because he was the bread of life amen and there's where the nation came for their wheat all the nations came there for their corn for it was in Bethlehem that had the fertile lands and you see this little bitty thing just saying oh it was a province of wheat yet that meant meant something it meant something amen we find out later in the Old Testament we find out that Rahab um she had a son and his name was Boaz God has not left us here to die sorry just tell that devil he he didn't bring me out of the world to destroy me that's what the children of Israel believed they believed they said oh God you brought us out of Egypt was really great we had McDonald's on every corner 71s everything was going good for us and now we got to pray for our food okay what's the problem God brought you out of the things of the world he can take care of you so if you have to pray for your food you have to pray for your health you have to pray for your job you have to pray for God will take care of us amen he and bring us out here to destroy us no matter how much you like the onions and the leaks and you want to go back don't go back amen amen so we find out later on so Rahab and Salma they had a son his name was Boaz and we're all acquainted with another great story and there's a Boaz was born in Bethlehem amen and the story of Ruth is a great story we find out that Ruth she she had two sons and she raised she and her husband they they they were they were Believers and they followed the word of God and they raised their children in the word of God but when it got tough when things got wrong and it didn't look like things were going well they left Bethlehem they said oh it's a famine if things aren't going right and they left they went down into Moab they went down with the compromisers and they hung out there for a while but we find out that God will only bless you when you stay with the word only when you stay with the message of the hour but you can he's not going to keep you here you yeah you can go off into Moab go ahead see how it works out for you and Naomi her husband died and then her two sons died and we know that under the law a woman had no rights none whatsoever no claim on the country only if she had a man that could vouch for her and she took Ruth who was a moabitas in Oprah and they came up out of Moab and they went back to Bethlehem why Bethlehem they went back to Bethlehem because they heard there was there was a harvest there they heard there was a Revival there and when when Ruth's sister counted the cause she said I I can't live this life I can't do it but Ruth told Naomi she said Naomi whatever it says to do I will do it I will go wherever you go your God will be my God I'm not interested in the things of the world I'm not interested in going back that way and she went up into Bethlehem and if you go and you read the book of Ruth you find out that she appeared she came up there and it was the ending of wheat harvest in the beginning of barley Harvest and so when she got up there Boaz was there and brother brandom said Boaz represented Christ and where where was he he was at Bethlehem and where was Ruth coming to she came to Bethlehem where was she gleaning at in Bethlehem see all those spiritual significances to this place here the background to this great scene that was taking place God knowing that from the beginning amen and she began to question her mother-in-law what she must do and finally Ruth was married to Boaz a gentile married to a prince again in Judah and she settled down and she lived in Bethlehem and after being married for some time they brought forth a son which added more and his name was oid it's at the end of The Book of Ruth amen another case another time when a gentile was married to a prince right think about it this morning you have no claims you have no claims on the scriptures if Jesus Christ had never come and be crucified if he had never come you would have no way to get salvation you'd have no claim on Heaven amen only through the prince and being married to him praise the Lord amen praise the Lord and it said after they had been married for some time time Ruth she brought forth a son named OED and he brought a son named Jesse and Jesse had eight boys amen and where was Jesse at well he wasn't an Ephraim he wasn't over at gilgal he wasn't up in Jerusalem he was at Bethlehem amen and God looked at it and see people just didn't they didn't get it they they they it's just little Bethlehem so that that's where the food food banks at the wheat we can go there we can get we can get wheat we can get barley we can get we can we can survive but yet God had something hid in Bethlehem amen and when when Jesse had these eight boys it was this great prophet Samuel who was born and raised up by Shiloh which wears the Tabernacle God sent Samuel from Shiloh all the way down to Bethlehem and when when that Prophet who was a judge when he came down into Bethlehem the scripture says that everybody was afraid of Samuel because they knew if a prophet showed up it was a sign of judgment it was a sign your foolishness is done away with you better straighten up and he came down and he went to Jesse and he said Jesse said I have not come down to do this but to S sacrifice unto the Lord amen and Jesse when he got all of his boys together all eight of them and the first seven of them we don't know they could have been Carpenters some of them could have been great Farmers other men they could have been mathematicians and everything else but the one that God chose was a Shepherd was a shepherd and where was he at Bethlehem God didn't it was all exact God was trying to show the world what a great thing he was going to do but because people were blinded by the Pharisees and the Sadducees and and what they thought God was showing them all the time what he was going to do amen amen Samuel came with a cruise of oil and the great prophet he was sent to Jesse and he said God has chosen one of your boys to rule and serve my people and it was out on the back side of the field a little Shepherd there was a little Ruddy scrawny looking boy was brought David the old to the youngest and Samuel poured the anointing on him in the presence of his brothers and them who stood about and proved that a God had anointed him King where was it at Bethlehem glory to God in the highest no wonder Bethlehem where he was anointed king it was in Bethlehem where David was born and his greater son Jesus the son of David amen also had to be born and Bethlehem because there's such a close knit between the two the father and son and Not only was this great son only the son he was the root and The Offspring of David where Bethlehem he was even before David and he'll be after David he is for Everlasting from Everlasting but according to the Flesh and all the things to be fulfilled he was the son of David he was to be born years later in the same Bethlehem this little forsaken City amen amen I asked sister Donna the other day I said I said ever listen to why little Bethlehem she said oh yeah I said and why did brother brandom say Jesus was born there she goes uh Bethlehem it's House of God's bread I said okay do you know about all this other stuff and then I told her I said I can't tell you I don't tell her what the Lord is showing me and most of us when we think of Bethlehem that's what we think of the House of God's bread but it was more than that it was where God was revealing that God himself was going to be a shepherd He was going to be a Shepherd when he came the son of David was going to look for the he was going to leave the 99 and look for the one the little insignificant one the little insignificant you yeah think about it out of all your family out of all however whether you got two siblings or four siblings and whatever your lineage is God came looking for you that's right in Bethlehem and he left it there so that you'd be encouraged in this hour they you know that God has poured his oil of anointing on you and brought you to a place where there's plenty to eat amen praise the Lord amen amen The House of the bread of God the house of God's bread Elohim he could have been born anywhere else where could he have been born anywhere else but that and it was hid to everybody but that Prophet out of Bethlehem shall come him and they was looking in Jerusalem they were looking in all the big Shiloh you think about it now you see when the three wise men came from the East and they went to Jerusalem looking for the king that's why they went there they went to Jerusalem because it made sense that the King of Kings would be where the king should be amen but if they'd have known what God had hid in the scriptures they would have gone because they had to go and look they had to go and look they said well this isn't working out Herod doesn't know where these guys are they ask the scribes and the Pharisees they said well where's the king supposed to be born at and they had to go look amen praise the Lord amen out of Bethlehem shall he come they were looking in Jerusalem they were looking for him in the big Shiloh they were looking everywhere but he come from Bethlehem cuz it was the house of God's bread it was God's Bread Basket to the world amen amen and there he was born in Bethlehem he could not be born anywhere else and brother renom said another great event that I shouldn't ever forget to call he says when David was anointed King then everybody turned against him when he was anointed king he his brothers rejected him and then he was called up you know because he went and he killed Goliath and then that caused more problems and then he was called up and he'd sit in Saul's in the chamber in in Saul's Palace and Saul was the king and sometimes anger would get on Saul he get all upset and everything else and David would come in and he'd start to play and sing praises unto the Lord and the evil spirit would leave Saul but even Saul turned against David amen and when David fled the face of Saul and all of his Brethren and he was out in the wilderness the Philistines were looking for him Israel was looking for him there was they were all against him and David sitting in a in a cave the king the guy who had been anointed to be king hiding in a cave and he sat there and he said oh he said it's so hot here things are so bad here I wish I could have a drink of cold water from the well that's by the gate where's it at in Bethlehem yes not gilgal not Shiloh not Jerusalem the well the water was in at Bethlehem brother Ram said he said so David at his worst time he was a fugitive it's in 1 Chronicles 11 and he'd been anointed and he know what he was going to be he was to be king God said so yet he was hated he was standing in between two great deep fires just as the church stands today the true Living Church of God without a denomination or anything else no organization nothing standing behind us everything else we're just out here by ourself little insignificant send the light yeah you think oh God has forsaken us maybe we need to go back to Bethlehem maybe we need to get a drink from The Well of Grace by the gate amen Amen brother Brenham said he says you know his mind started to go back way down there by the gates of Bethlehem there was a well and there was no water like there was at that water you know Brothers this I'm when I got saved and the Bible says it would be like a well of water bubbling up from inside of you brother it was like water I I mean I've been high and I've been drunk but it was nothing like that water that came from Bethlehem amen Amen brother Brenham said you know he says Palestine has some bad water they got some evil water they even have blackwat fever and stuff in them and a lot of it is alkaline and it would kill you but Bethlehem is the water seep of the province there is no water like Bethlehem and David used to think when I take my sheep and start out in the morning i' go by that old well and drink and it was cool and sweet and how it quenched The Thirst what we just don't respect what God has given to us when we get discouraged and down and out and everything else we sit down and we go whoa why whoa who me just that's and then you have a nice pity party and everything else and you're still going whoo is oh brother we need some Mighty Men we need some Mighty Men three Mighty Men hope faith and love amen to go down and get us a drink of water to cut through all the unbelief to cut through all the Philistines take us down there to that well amen get a Cool Drink From that well amen amen it'll ref fres you amen and that's why Jesus had to be born there that's because not only he is the bread of life but he also said If any man thirst let him come and drink of me cuz I am the well that's at Bethlehem praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen that's why he was born in Bethlehem amen that's why he had to come because he was the it was the bread Center he was the bread of life it was the Water Center what is it the Waters of life and in Jesus is both the bread of life the Waters of life therefore he had to come and to be born in Bethlehem amen amen praise the lord it's all right I like it amen there's a little book a minor Prophet is named Micah and um he's so small I had to write the page number down some of those books are small and Micah 5 verse two there's a prophecy it says but thou Bethlehem AA and that that uh Hebrew word it means fruitfulness I like that fruitfulness though thou be little among the thousands of Judah see it's important to know out of the thousands of the Lion of the tribe of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in Israel David first but then also H The King The King of Kings the son of David secondly amen whom whose going forth have been from old and from Everlasting praise the God praise the Lord amen amen why Bethlehem hopefully you see it that's why he was born in Bethlehem it cradled him brother the place he wants to be cradled today is in your heart that he might display from you the Waters of life to a perishing people when you go out in the stores and you're walking along you need to be the Water of Life you need to be the bread of life to somebody people today all they want to be is oh look at me I'm a Baptist or I'm a a Pentecostal or I'm a Catholic or I'm I'm Jehovah Witness or whatever just be that well be that well of Life The Water of Life to a Dying World amen why Bethlehem because God saw that he could hide so many things in Bethlehem and keep them for us that we' see that the word of God is it's a living breathing thing it's always unfolding when the word gets dead and you can no longer see it unfolding brother you better get back to the well cuz you're you're getting ready to pass out amen praise God Amen so let's go to Luke Chapter 2 amen and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made from Sirius who was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone to to his own City think about it what if you had to go pay your income taxes but you got to do it at the federal courthouse in the city where you were born now where else in the city where you were born and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth because Joseph Mary they were lineage and their lineage went back to Bethlehem and God was not going to allow them to have Christ anywhere else but where God had pre-planned it before the foundation of the world so no matter what you think no matter what you got planned out if you're part of the word of God he will take you by the nose and drag you right to where you need to be that his word will not fall to the ground amen amen and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth unto Judea under the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child it seemed like seemed like you know brother Bram talked about Moses coming across he says Moses showed all these great signs and wonders and miracles and the children of Israel the Pharaoh and they they get said get out of here take take your cattle your sheep your children go go get out out and then as soon as they got out it changed his mind and then when they went across it seemed like they would look for a fairy or a good way but God took them right to the Red Sea and he took them to a particular place where there was a city to the north and a city to the South and there was no way to go back there was only one way to go and that was forward brother sister I'm telling you if the word of God did that for Moses God will do the same thing for us amen took them right to the edge of the Red Sea and they said oh L this isn't working out and they just looked in the word and God said Moses he said' what are you crying about I look I did this for you I did this for you I did this for you did this for you did this for you this for you you got the point now count your blessings name them one by one count your many blessings see what God hath done because let me tell you we can't do anything we can't every gift we have God gave every house he gave we have God gave our jobs our food our health everything we have is it's in his hands amen amen praise the Lord amen so it looked like the worst time of the year it looked it looked terrible Joseph probably came home from work from the carpenter shop and said what I got to go pay the to taxes where I was born and about that time Mary goes oh you know I don't know if I know most of us are parents you know what Braxton Hicks is that's false labor pains and she had a p fa uh labor pain and she said Joseph she said I don't think this is the time to go but you know you can't kick against the Pricks you can't so God made a way for them they got a donkey got his wife who was large with child he took her down they traveled from Nazareth all the way down to the city of David Bethlehem they got down there now you would think that God in his great wisdom because W this is the king of kings he should be born in a palace maybe the Sheridan F star man and the be the best Hilton and when they got to Bethlehem the city was in an uproar and all the hotels were booked and it looked crazy it looked horrible but they finally found somebody who would listen to say look I got to have a place to stay my wife is praying it and they said well guess what we got this little stable over here and we got this feed trough that we normally feed the sheep out of you can use that as a c ad and then because he's the Lamb of God and also the red bulock an ox you can take swaddling cloth off of the Y the yolk of a ox and put that in the Sheep trough and there you can put your baby and hopefully everything will work out for you and when the baby was born the Shepherds went or the the angel angels went nuts and started singing Glory to God in the highest and where were they at they weren't down at the church they were up on the Mountaintop over here where the Shepherds were and they told the Shepherds guess what the Lamb of God is on the face of the Earth and they said this is where you find him amen the god of Heaven in Bethlehem why Bethlehem because it was God's plan was God's choice and it was so that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the End Amen and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flocks by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord showed round about them and they were soore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good to Tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior a savior praise God which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in SW swaddling cloth lying in a manger and suddenly there with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will toward men amen and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one unto another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known known unto us I don't know maybe there was two or 300,000 people there but God revealed himself to probably six Shepherds I don't know if you've been to a football game lately big crowds think of that six guys in that whole stadium know that God just came on the face of the Earth everybody else is all worried about paying taxes cuz that's why they were there they were there to pay their taxes and all the hustle and bustle and the noise and everything else but these sick Shepherds came down and they came in the world didn't care about them because they were insignificant but God sent angels to them you're insignificant but God has sent angels to you God has sent angels to you amen and they came with haste and they found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which had been told them concerning the child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds now why didn't they go look and see if it was true or not because they weren't called they weren't called you don't know how blessed you are say oh you know God sent a prophet H I'll think about it you know God is doing this that's something to think about maybe I'll think about that too but see the Shepherds God sent an angel to them God picked us up out of the myy clay he picked us up because he saw a value in you that the world doesn't even see the world doesn't see any value in US amen but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them praise the Lord amen amen amen for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful the counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and he's being born in Bethlehem amen let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus we are so grateful that you sent a prophet Lord that could expound these things to us that could show us these things and Lord we're grateful that you took notice of us insignificant little in our own eyes Lord but you took notice of us you picked us up and you placed us heavenly father I pray as we go and visit our families and come in contact with this Lost World Lord that we can be the water of life and the bread of life and just give hope to somebody that we can just give peace to somebody in the midst of the storm heavenly father I pray you just take this simple message and Lord that you'll burn it deep in our hearts Lord Heavenly Father may we not forget what you've done for us in Bethlehem we're thankful for all things in Jesus Christ's
