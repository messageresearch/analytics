[41:39] Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[41:42] Earth and gross Darkness the
[41:45] people but the Lord shall rise upon thee
[41:49] and His glory shall be seen upon thee
[41:53] amen God bless you may be
[41:56] seated well well I don't I don't believe
[41:59] in coincidences but we just had an
[42:05] eclipse
[42:07] and some of us some of us had the
[42:10] privilege of seeing it totally get
[42:13] dark and and and just the Bible says
[42:17] that Darkness has covered the
[42:21] Earth Jesus said in the last days that
[42:25] that there would be a term o Nation
[42:27] would rise against
[42:29] Nation we see
[42:31] Israel and Iran Iran rising up against
[42:35] Israel Russia against Ukraine China
[42:39] against Taiwan North Korea is just
[42:43] threatening Christians are being
[42:45] persecuted and displaced read this
[42:47] morning and killed in 28 of Africa's 54
[42:54] countries and Nigeria is one country
[42:57] that has seen a massive rise in attacks
[43:01] against who the faithful the they say
[43:03] the
[43:05] faithful the Bible says that Satan has
[43:08] weakened the
[43:10] Nations once we were a great
[43:14] nation and now literally we are the
[43:16] laughing stock of the
[43:19] world terrorism from within our own
[43:24] borders immorality and Corruption is
[43:28] rampid I believe the lid has been lifted
[43:31] off hell and it's affected the Earth
[43:34] Darkness has covered the earth now it's
[43:37] a spiritual Darkness we see naturally
[43:40] what's happened but it is a spiritual
[43:43] darkness and the Bible says we read this
[43:46] morning that gross Darkness the
[43:50] people can we really trust anyone
[43:54] anymore I remember a day that I I was
[43:58] just young and I I I made a a a a a
[44:02] $35,000 deal on a handshake uh I
[44:05] wouldn't think about doing that
[44:09] anymore people are are lying they're
[44:12] manipulating they're they're they're
[44:14] stealing they're
[44:16] killing confusion about people's own
[44:20] identity not because God made a
[44:24] mistake but because their own lustful
[44:26] flesh and Satan's ability to C confuse
[44:29] especially young people's
[44:32] minds there's a massive decline in in
[44:35] Christianity and the Bible tells us that
[44:38] this is the day where the apostasy the
[44:42] final apostasy has set in now we know it
[44:44] already started I in the first church
[44:47] age but we're at the climax and there's
[44:50] a great Falling Away evil spirits are
[44:53] getting inside of Christian homes and
[44:57] beginning to deteriorate and tear apart
[44:59] from the inside
[45:01] out selfishness and hatred iniquity has
[45:06] become the new
[45:08] Norm Jesus said in Matthew 24 that many
[45:11] shall be offended and shall betray one
[45:14] another and shall hate one another and
[45:16] and many people shall be deceived gross
[45:19] Darkness upon the people and he said
[45:22] because iniquity shall abound the love
[45:26] of many shall wax cold
[45:30] am the church
[45:32] world is full of Darkness as
[45:35] well can you say Amen it was just be
[45:38] honest Jesus looked at the church in
[45:41] this age and said it's
[45:43] lukewarm miserable people he said
[45:47] they're
[45:48] miserable spiritually
[45:50] blind walking in darkness and on top of
[45:53] it they don't know
[45:54] it they they they don't know their
[45:58] condition their spiritual condition in
[46:00] fact they think they're doing so good
[46:02] that it's okay to come in church and
[46:03] just be
[46:06] entertained just you know this is what
[46:08] we want to feel like when we leave
[46:10] here and we they don't want the word
[46:16] anymore we're told there's coming a time
[46:18] that people will not endure sound
[46:21] Doctrine they just they don't want
[46:22] anything that's going to challenge them
[46:24] that's going to hurt them that's going
[46:26] to make them have to give up
[46:29] something they want a Ministry to fit
[46:32] their appetite you know you go to going
[46:34] to go eat today right and if we go out
[46:36] to a restaurant even if we go home we're
[46:39] probably going to look for something
[46:41] that we want to eat nobody's going to
[46:42] like I'm gonna let's cook this I hate it
[46:45] nobody's going to do that you're looking
[46:46] for something you want right and
[46:49] unfortunately there's only one word
[46:51] there's only one word there is no choice
[46:56] but people want to rip out part of
[47:00] it we need to eat the whole word right
[47:04] that's the only way it's hard to find a
[47:07] preacher who's willing to forsake money
[47:10] popularity reputation to preach the full
[47:13] truth and I'll say it like this with a
[47:16] balanced
[47:17] message not just on one
[47:21] side gross Darkness has covered the
[47:24] church amen amen Paul told Timothy this
[47:29] know also that in the last days perilous
[47:31] time shall come now this is this is
[47:34] what's happening in the church for the
[47:36] men of the church shall be lovers of
[47:38] their own
[47:39] self Covetous bolsters
[47:43] proud blasphemers right in
[47:46] church disobedient to
[47:50] parents
[47:52] unthankful
[47:54] Unholy in a holy church there's Unholy
[47:57] people unthankful people having a hard
[48:01] time to
[48:02] worship come on it should be the easiest
[48:05] thing to do is to Worship the
[48:08] Lord without natural affection truth
[48:10] Breakers false
[48:12] accusers you know the devil's just
[48:14] looking for somebody he can use to
[48:16] accuse somebody incontinent fears
[48:19] despisers of those that are
[48:21] good traitors Petty high-minded lovers
[48:27] of pleasure more than lovers of God so
[48:29] see there church people they love God
[48:32] but they have a love for other
[48:35] things having a form of godliness as
[48:37] long as I got a form long as I go to
[48:39] church long as I do this I should be
[48:41] okay but Paul told him he says get away
[48:44] from them turn
[48:47] away sir because God has called us to be
[48:52] all
[48:53] his you know we got to make that
[48:55] decision all in I'm all in for God
[48:59] praise the Lord on top of this grow
[49:02] Darkness God has also hid his word from
[49:06] the wise and The
[49:08] Prudent think about this darkness in the
[49:10] church they're blind but then God has
[49:13] also hid it from the wise and prudent it
[49:16] makes it difficult to hear from God do
[49:19] you believe that amen Amos 8:1 says
[49:23] behold the days come sayeth the Lord
[49:25] that I will send a a famine in the land
[49:29] not a famine of bread not a thirst of
[49:31] for water but of hearing the words of
[49:36] the Lord
[49:37] amen and they shall Wander from sea to
[49:40] Sea from from the north even to the East
[49:43] and they shall run to and fro and seek
[49:45] the Lord seek the word of the Lord and
[49:48] shall not find it
[49:52] amen look the word is
[49:55] here it has been given given to
[49:58] us but what we're missing is hearing
[50:02] it come on am the word is the word but
[50:07] we're missing the
[50:13] hearing people are struggling with
[50:15] hearing from God personally in their
[50:19] lives they don't want to take the
[50:22] time to make it real and coming to
[50:25] church and expecting God to just unfold
[50:28] everything that we want to
[50:31] unfold is not God's nature that he's
[50:34] just going to do that that's why he's
[50:35] he's calling us to seek
[50:38] him to spend time with him people don't
[50:42] want to take the time to wait on the
[50:43] Lord they don't want to pay the price
[50:46] and this is the the gross Darkness
[50:48] that's covered the church
[50:51] today I don't want to be part of those
[50:55] that just
[50:59] are satisfied with not hearing the voice
[51:01] of God and coming to church and hearing
[51:02] the word preach hearing the word preach
[51:04] is not hearing the voice of
[51:06] God
[51:09] personally what we have to do to hear
[51:11] the word of God personally is when the
[51:13] gospel is preached that it hits here and
[51:15] says that that that I see the Lord in
[51:18] that that is for
[51:20] me God is speaking to me right there
[51:24] this isn't just coming and fulfilling
[51:25] some some obligation that's right but
[51:28] there's something happening now because
[51:30] I heard and God said he' sent a famine
[51:33] in other words that one time there was a
[51:35] zuza street at one time you know it it
[51:38] just fell
[51:40] everywhere but now you got to pay the
[51:43] price got to pay the
[51:45] price second Timothy 3:13 says but evil
[51:49] men and seducers shall wax worse and
[51:52] worse deceiving and being
[51:55] deceived but look at this but continue
[51:58] thou in the things which thou has
[52:02] learned has been assured of knowing of
[52:04] whom thou has learned them if we
[52:07] continue to press into the Living Word
[52:09] of God then God will see you through
[52:12] amen if you step away from the Living
[52:14] Word and oh yeah just another service
[52:17] again yeah we're hearing the you know
[52:18] the gospel you know brother John is's
[52:20] saying the same old thing you're not
[52:22] you're
[52:23] not you're there you're not going to be
[52:26] protect
[52:27] protected God is sending a Living
[52:31] Word and it's it's got to be alive to us
[52:35] amen now Satan is keeping people in
[52:40] spiritual
[52:41] Darkness there's
[52:44] chains and it's through their unbelief
[52:46] he's deceiving them Revelations 12:9
[52:48] says and the Great Dragon was cast out
[52:52] the old serpent called the devil and
[52:54] Satan which deceiveth the the
[52:57] whole world Amen he deceiveth the whole
[53:05] world he was cast into the Earth and his
[53:08] angels were cast out with him well when
[53:11] he was cast out of
[53:16] Heaven he didn't stop
[53:20] deceiving he's in every he's got his
[53:23] fingers in everything
[53:27] and his goal is dece to deceive man from
[53:32] what to keep man from giving their whole
[53:36] heart to Jesus Christ that is
[53:39] it because if they get serious about a
[53:42] relationship he knows he's going to lose
[53:44] them if I could just keep them
[53:48] religious keep them distracted in the
[53:51] things of the
[53:52] world let them think that family is more
[53:55] important than God God business is more
[53:58] important than God hobbies are more
[54:01] important than
[54:04] God that's
[54:08] deception there's nothing more important
[54:12] than
[54:13] God Satan is also called the accuser of
[54:16] the
[54:17] Brethren anytime you go accusing
[54:20] somebody you're walking in spiritual
[54:22] darkness and you don't even know it just
[54:24] the mere fact that you're
[54:27] accusing now it's not whether the person
[54:30] that you're accusing is
[54:34] wrong wrong or right it doesn't matter
[54:36] what matters is don't accuse
[54:40] them it's the accusing that makes you
[54:44] guilty it doesn't matter how much they
[54:46] do
[54:47] wrong you don't want that Darkness on
[54:51] you 2 Corinthians 4:3 2 Corinthians 4:3
[54:55] there's a lot of scripture today but
[54:56] that's that's just the I hope that's
[54:59] okay that the the the gospel is what
[55:03] helps me to know who Jesus Christ
[55:05] is but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[55:11] them that are
[55:14] lost in other words Our Gospel is not
[55:17] hid to those that are saved that's right
[55:19] amen it's hid to them that are lost in
[55:23] whom the God of this world
[55:26] right the god who's deceiveth the whole
[55:28] world in whom the God of this world have
[55:30] blinded the minds of them which believe
[55:36] not so it's real easy who
[55:40] he's
[55:42] blinding he's blinding those who choose
[55:45] not to believe the truth that's how
[55:48] scary it is to come to church and really
[55:51] not believe the word because now you
[55:53] just opened your door for BL
[55:57] kindness it starts with our choice amen
[56:00] lest the light of the Glorious gospel of
[56:03] Christ who's in who is in the image of
[56:06] God should shine on to them unbelief
[56:10] keeps the light of God from opening up
[56:14] and helping us to see greater
[56:16] things so you know if we if if God shows
[56:21] us a a a a scripture let's just say this
[56:24] God shows you the the scripture
[56:27] that
[56:28] um that uh you need to be baptized the
[56:32] correct
[56:34] way okay say you've been baptized but it
[56:36] was incorrect and God shows you the
[56:38] correct way to be
[56:40] baptized now it's not good enough just
[56:43] to know it that's a light but you got to
[56:47] walk in that amen now once you walk in
[56:50] that light what that does is now that
[56:52] just opens the the door o that more
[56:55] light shines in your p pathway so you
[56:56] can see more amen but if you don't walk
[57:00] in the light that God speaks to your
[57:02] heart because I'll say it like this
[57:03] standing here is as surely as anything
[57:06] this I know God speaks to every person
[57:09] amen there is no doubt and no
[57:13] question now do we
[57:16] hear do we hear are we sensitive are we
[57:20] are we we we we catching what he's
[57:22] saying that's that's that's what why we
[57:26] should come prepared that's why we
[57:28] should come more prepared and not you
[57:30] know not just show up to
[57:32] church show up the right way imagine for
[57:35] a moment that when that tomorrow you're
[57:38] literally going to die and you're going
[57:41] to meet
[57:43] God are you just going to go home and
[57:46] just show
[57:48] up no you're literally going to go home
[57:50] and you're going to think about that
[57:51] you're going to meet your maker amen
[57:55] amen and you will begin
[57:57] to think about is there anything that
[58:01] needs to be taken care
[58:07] of because it now becomes the most
[58:10] important thing look if we really
[58:12] believe God is here and God is we're
[58:15] going to have a meeting with God God's
[58:17] going to speak to us we're going to do
[58:19] the same thing amen we're going to
[58:21] prepare we're going to say Lord I don't
[58:23] want to miss what you have for me
[58:25] because it is too easy to come to church
[58:28] and just kind of like we're lay back and
[58:30] just you know listen to the word being
[58:32] preached but you know it's not just the
[58:34] word being preached the enjoyment or or
[58:37] or whatever we our our our natural man
[58:39] can get out of it but you know it's it's
[58:41] a fearful thing to fall in the hands of
[58:43] a living God and I'm sure God has
[58:45] something for me that he wants me to do
[58:48] have I done all that he's asked me to do
[58:50] or have I brushed something out of the
[58:51] rung have I forgot about it have other
[58:53] things become uh more important to me
[58:57] amen just things begin to
[59:00] slip we don't want
[59:04] that I
[59:06] believe that we are a chosen people
[59:09] here we're a little different than
[59:12] anybody
[59:14] else Jesus said you have not chosen me
[59:18] but I have chosen
[59:19] you and I ordained you he chose us above
[59:24] all other people on the Earth the Bible
[59:27] says and he did it because he loved us
[59:30] and you know I just can't WRA my hand
[59:32] around
[59:33] that I just I I I don't I don't know if
[59:36] I'll ever comprehend
[59:39] that we've been predestinated to be just
[59:42] like
[59:43] Jesus and Jesus gave us a Commandment
[59:46] that we're to love one another just like
[59:49] he loved us which is I can't comprehend
[59:52] how much he loves
[59:54] me I still fail him every day and he's
[59:57] loving me and then he gives me this big
[1:00:00] Commandment that I don't know if I could
[1:00:02] fulfill these shoes that I actually got
[1:00:04] to love you the way that he loved
[1:00:06] me and not just you but out there in the
[1:00:11] world because you know the love of God
[1:00:14] is without respect to
[1:00:16] persons he loves every he loves those
[1:00:18] out there just like he loves
[1:00:23] me but not only did it give us a
[1:00:25] commandment to to to love us to love one
[1:00:29] another like he loved us he he said I
[1:00:31] want you to be perfect Jesus said I want
[1:00:33] you to be perfect like my Father in
[1:00:36] Heaven is
[1:00:38] perfect I want you to love your enemies
[1:00:41] now well you know that takes work you
[1:00:45] know what kind of work that takes that
[1:00:47] takes you dying out so much the only
[1:00:50] thing you want to do is please God
[1:00:53] that's the work is getting yourself out
[1:00:55] of the way so God could come inside and
[1:00:58] actually do the
[1:00:59] job he's the only one that can do it his
[1:01:02] love is the greatest love on the planet
[1:01:04] it endures all things right it believes
[1:01:09] all things it it doesn't vauth itself it
[1:01:12] there's nothing about it about itself it
[1:01:14] lives for
[1:01:16] others now the Bible calls us a special
[1:01:21] people calls us
[1:01:23] precious we're the apple of God's eye
[1:01:26] amen amen we are his
[1:01:30] bride 1 Peter 2:9 says that we are a
[1:01:34] chosen generation if you want to write
[1:01:36] that down we are different we're a
[1:01:40] chosen generation he chose us a royal
[1:01:45] priesthood a holy nation yes A peculiar
[1:01:49] people a holy nation now we're not
[1:01:51] talking about the
[1:01:54] USA we're not talking about that Nation
[1:01:57] we're talking about individuals yes
[1:02:00] right amen his chosen they are a holy
[1:02:04] nation amen be ye holy even as I am Holy
[1:02:07] amen without Holiness no man shall see
[1:02:10] the Lord Holiness is a part of God's
[1:02:13] special people
[1:02:14] yes now we are 100% different than the
[1:02:19] people that are in the
[1:02:22] world come on you going to help me or am
[1:02:24] I you know we want the we don't want to
[1:02:26] have a three-hour service
[1:02:30] here we are 100% different than the
[1:02:33] people in the world now we're flesh and
[1:02:37] blood and everybody will have a chance
[1:02:39] to hear the
[1:02:44] gospel but what makes us different is we
[1:02:47] believe the
[1:02:48] gospel we believe what God said that's
[1:02:51] what makes us different and we it's not
[1:02:53] a mental belief it's not some religion
[1:02:56] it's not some covering is it but it is
[1:03:00] it's something inside of us Bears
[1:03:02] witness with this word that it is it is
[1:03:06] 100% true not just for everybody but
[1:03:09] it's 100% true for
[1:03:14] me that if my brother or my sister
[1:03:17] choose not to live by every word that
[1:03:20] proceedeth out of the mouth of God I
[1:03:22] have made my choice I will live by every
[1:03:24] word that proceedeth of the mouth of God
[1:03:28] well what about them that's not between
[1:03:30] me and them that's between them and
[1:03:34] their
[1:03:36] creator but the bride is 100%
[1:03:41] different than the
[1:03:45] world while Every Nation on Earth is
[1:03:49] decaying
[1:03:50] morally we have been called to be a holy
[1:03:54] nation right we are part of a group that
[1:03:58] goes around the world now part of this
[1:04:01] nation part of this nation has already
[1:04:04] gone on to the
[1:04:06] reward
[1:04:08] amen but there is still a living bride
[1:04:12] here and they're going to be caught up
[1:04:14] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:04:15] there's going to be a
[1:04:18] Rapture and there's going to be a few
[1:04:20] here and a few there all over the
[1:04:23] world they make up a holy nation
[1:04:28] now we're
[1:04:30] strange we're we're
[1:04:34] strange Bible says we're pilgrims and
[1:04:36] strangers that's right but you know
[1:04:39] we're really strange to
[1:04:44] people brother Dennis is always telling
[1:04:47] us little
[1:04:51] testimonies that always always bringing
[1:04:54] out the facts how different he is than
[1:04:57] the people of the world
[1:04:58] Amen we're supposed to be we're we're
[1:05:03] odd we're
[1:05:05] unique we're unusual we're different
[1:05:08] we're distinct but we're set apart just
[1:05:11] for God and what makes us different is
[1:05:14] that people do not love God the way we
[1:05:19] do the bride of Christ is a peculiar
[1:05:22] people a chosen Generations
[1:05:26] to show forth the Praises of him who
[1:05:29] called us out of Darkness Into His
[1:05:31] Marvelous Light amen now to me coming to
[1:05:35] church and not
[1:05:37] worshiping that's the
[1:05:39] norm that's the worldly
[1:05:44] way but for
[1:05:47] us we've been
[1:05:49] chosen to show forth the Praises of him
[1:05:52] that called us out of Darkness into his
[1:05:55] Mar Marvelous
[1:05:57] Light this is the hour to praise him
[1:06:00] well I don't want you to feel bad maybe
[1:06:02] that you didn't praise him the way that
[1:06:03] you should have when Brother Bruce gave
[1:06:04] you
[1:06:05] opportunity I don't want you to do that
[1:06:08] but what I want you to do is start
[1:06:10] praising him right
[1:06:12] now that's
[1:06:14] right give glory to his
[1:06:19] word let him know you're you're uniting
[1:06:23] with the word and you're thankful for
[1:06:25] the word
[1:06:27] you know a lot of people say well you
[1:06:29] know I'm thank I'm
[1:06:30] thankful but they don't show
[1:06:34] it or I love you but they don't show
[1:06:40] it what good is having anything if it's
[1:06:43] not
[1:06:45] shown right all the people that have
[1:06:49] gone by the way of the grave and they're
[1:06:50] not here today have no opportunity to
[1:06:54] show anything
[1:06:56] it's a it's just a
[1:06:59] memory but we have an opportunity to
[1:07:03] manifest
[1:07:10] love manifest I Praise You
[1:07:15] Lord and there's so many ways to do
[1:07:19] it but if you read the Bible in the Book
[1:07:22] of
[1:07:24] Psalms and in the New Testament you will
[1:07:27] find that praise yes it does originate
[1:07:31] from the heart but it's not supposed to
[1:07:34] be just there in the heart it needs to
[1:07:38] come through the body through the
[1:07:41] lips through the
[1:07:43] hands it's a
[1:07:46] sacrifice of
[1:07:48] praise and the thing
[1:07:51] is um the world the world knows how
[1:07:58] praise just go to any sports game or or
[1:08:02] so many different things out there I
[1:08:04] mean I was at Applebee's yesterday and
[1:08:07] you know they got the old TVs up there
[1:08:08] and they're just like playing golf and
[1:08:12] you know they hit it and everybody
[1:08:13] there's watching it's
[1:08:15] going good job good
[1:08:19] job that they're giving praise to that
[1:08:22] person that shot a good shot right
[1:08:27] you know God blessed us today with
[1:08:29] mercies new
[1:08:31] mercies that's a great
[1:08:33] shot no man can shoot like that no God
[1:08:37] can shoot like he can shoot no one can
[1:08:39] forgive like he can
[1:08:42] forgive and I tell you there ought to be
[1:08:44] so many reasons that I can't wait to get
[1:08:46] to church I'm going to praise him I'm
[1:08:48] going to worship him like I've never
[1:08:50] done it
[1:08:51] before you know today I'll say today I
[1:08:53] am more debt today to God than I was 20
[1:08:57] years
[1:08:59] ago 20 years ago I had sinned
[1:09:04] less I've sinned more in the last 20
[1:09:07] years I haven't been
[1:09:09] perfect I praised him back there 20
[1:09:12] years ago I would be praising him more
[1:09:13] now
[1:09:14] today he's revealed more of his word to
[1:09:17] me I've got more light to walk I I I got
[1:09:21] a lot of reasons to praise him he gave
[1:09:23] me breath today he put a desire in my
[1:09:26] heart to put him first above all the
[1:09:29] things of this world he's worthy to be
[1:09:32] praised amen I got to get back to my
[1:09:36] message God has called his people out of
[1:09:40] gross
[1:09:41] Darkness he's called have you heard his
[1:09:47] call
[1:09:49] amen now if you want to know the very
[1:09:53] nature of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:55] is to lead and guide you into all
[1:09:58] truth he is not satisfied that you're in
[1:10:01] a message
[1:10:07] Church job said I'll not be satisfied to
[1:10:10] awaken his
[1:10:12] likness John said I have no Greater Joy
[1:10:15] than to hear that my children Walk In
[1:10:19] Truth The Very nature of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:23] is when he the spirit of Truth truth is
[1:10:26] come he will lead and guide you into all
[1:10:28] truth amen now we in this flesh are
[1:10:32] always wanting to just stop wherever
[1:10:35] we're
[1:10:37] at like I I'm I I'm paying my ties now I
[1:10:41] you know I wasn't doing that for for 20
[1:10:44] years I'm paying it now and you know
[1:10:46] what that should be good
[1:10:50] enough it should be in our carnal mind
[1:10:53] but in the mind of God he has a he wants
[1:10:56] to see us in His image with his
[1:11:03] character so that means he wants us to
[1:11:06] walk in more light so when I ask the
[1:11:08] question have you heard his call yet
[1:11:11] what was the last thing that God asked
[1:11:15] you to
[1:11:18] do what was the last
[1:11:21] thing because that whatever he asked you
[1:11:23] to do whatever he asked you not to do
[1:11:27] anymore that was
[1:11:30] light that was
[1:11:32] light that he's saying here see this I
[1:11:35] want you to walk in this and look our
[1:11:40] flesh just wants to go to a church and
[1:11:42] hear somebody say your bride you're
[1:11:46] there you're
[1:11:48] in don't
[1:11:53] change and that that is what they say is
[1:11:57] encouraging I'm just speaking of the
[1:11:59] world now not speaking the
[1:12:03] message look I'm so glad God God has a
[1:12:07] vision for me greater than where I'm at
[1:12:09] today I'm glad that my God thinks more
[1:12:11] of me than what I am today because I
[1:12:14] know I'm not there
[1:12:17] yet I don't want to be satisfied with
[1:12:21] this what is this all you got to do is
[1:12:24] take
[1:12:25] five minutes and look at the things
[1:12:27] you're thinking about the things you're
[1:12:28] Desiring and and where you're
[1:12:33] going the bride is different than the
[1:12:37] church it's different than the foolish
[1:12:41] virgin it's different than waiting a
[1:12:44] thousand years and
[1:12:45] hoping you make it through
[1:12:50] judgment the bride has been
[1:12:53] chosen she's chosen
[1:12:56] to follow the whole
[1:12:58] word amen 2 Corinthians 6 2 Corinthians
[1:13:03] chapter 6 verse1 17
[1:13:05] wherefore come out from among
[1:13:09] them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord
[1:13:13] and touch not the unclean thing and I
[1:13:15] will receive you
[1:13:17] notice before God ever saved us we had
[1:13:20] to do
[1:13:21] something we had to make a decision to
[1:13:24] separate oursel from the world we had to
[1:13:25] say okay I'm not going to live the way I
[1:13:28] want to live
[1:13:29] anymore and I had to separate myself
[1:13:32] before God would receive
[1:13:34] me and he says in verse 18 and will be a
[1:13:38] father unto you and you shall be my sons
[1:13:40] and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty
[1:13:42] amen today God is still
[1:13:46] separating he's still calling for a
[1:13:48] separation can we identify now look I
[1:13:52] I'm just going to be honest with you
[1:13:53] every one of us is very good at
[1:13:56] identifying and sorry for moving around
[1:13:58] so much God is we all we are very good
[1:14:02] at identifying of what other people need
[1:14:04] to separate
[1:14:07] from right you know we didn't even go to
[1:14:10] college for
[1:14:12] that and and we don't even go to you
[1:14:15] know a place to learn
[1:14:17] that but you know we have a hard
[1:14:20] time recognizing what we are being
[1:14:24] called by God to separate
[1:14:28] from now
[1:14:31] remember if God was through with you
[1:14:40] now I believe as long as we got breath
[1:14:43] we ought to be pressing towards that
[1:14:45] Mark and I mean
[1:14:47] pressing not not just you know on a
[1:14:50] skateboard and somebody's has to push us
[1:14:53] that we actually got to do the work
[1:14:56] press
[1:14:57] in all right 1 John Chapter 2 ver verse
[1:15:01] 15 love not the
[1:15:04] world neither the things that are in the
[1:15:08] world if any man love the world the love
[1:15:12] of the father's not in them Bo that's
[1:15:14] pretty pretty cut and dry there isn't it
[1:15:17] amen for all that is in the
[1:15:20] world now we're we're not talking about
[1:15:23] Earth we're talking about world nature
[1:15:26] here is the lust of the
[1:15:29] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of
[1:15:34] life is not of the
[1:15:37] father it's of the world so he's trying
[1:15:40] he said that there so we could see if
[1:15:42] that we're we're Desiring something that
[1:15:44] isn't God to recognize that's not of God
[1:15:47] right no matter what it
[1:15:49] is if God's not in it stay away from it
[1:15:54] it'll bring it'll bring
[1:15:56] damage and the world passeth away and
[1:15:59] the lust thereof but he that doeth the
[1:16:02] will of God abideth forever amen
[1:16:07] ever second Timothy 2:4 no man that
[1:16:11] worth entangleth himself with the
[1:16:13] Affairs of this life that he may please
[1:16:17] him who have chosen him to be a
[1:16:21] soldier a soldier uh of what
[1:16:25] the the gospel of the of the light that
[1:16:28] he has brought to
[1:16:30] us now when Jesus said he taught us
[1:16:34] there and I believe uh well I know he
[1:16:38] taught us this I was just trying to
[1:16:39] figure out which book it was in but it's
[1:16:42] in the book of the Bible that's where he
[1:16:44] taught us and he said uh he told us to
[1:16:48] go out and and and baptize
[1:16:51] all and um uh and to teach them all
[1:16:55] things whatsoever I command you
[1:17:02] amen so now he give us light we've got
[1:17:07] to help somebody in the same light he's
[1:17:08] given us now we can't force it we can't
[1:17:11] push it we can't make them but we can
[1:17:14] teach it we can teach them to observe
[1:17:17] the same light that God showed
[1:17:19] us because you know God's no respector
[1:17:22] persons God doesn't want me walking in
[1:17:25] more light than you and God doesn't want
[1:17:27] you walking in more light than
[1:17:29] me his desire is that we all walk in all
[1:17:32] the light all the light what's different
[1:17:35] between me and you it's our callings and
[1:17:38] it's a time that God reveals himself to
[1:17:41] us I can't give you Revelation you can't
[1:17:44] give me
[1:17:46] Revelation but we can pray together that
[1:17:49] God gives us
[1:17:51] Revelation now God has given us a
[1:17:53] Marvelous Light
[1:17:56] we ought to be the most grateful people
[1:17:58] on the
[1:18:01] planet look we're all born in homes we
[1:18:04] had family members and not all of them
[1:18:07] are walking in the
[1:18:09] light we know people that had the same
[1:18:12] opportuni sat in the same church they're
[1:18:14] not even here now right that right there
[1:18:18] that thought process ought to make us so
[1:18:20] grateful for the
[1:18:22] light we ought to be the most happy
[1:18:25] grateful people on the planet amen it
[1:18:28] should be easy for us to come into
[1:18:29] church and just worship
[1:18:33] freely now God didn't just give us a
[1:18:35] little bit of
[1:18:36] light but God gave us a Marvelous
[1:18:40] Light a marvelous
[1:18:42] light now before I knew about this
[1:18:46] light I went to
[1:18:48] church in fact I went to a number of
[1:18:51] churches before I came into the the
[1:18:54] truth of this
[1:18:55] glorious
[1:18:58] light and we read the Bible in the
[1:19:00] churches I went
[1:19:03] to in fact I read the Bible at
[1:19:06] home and although I could tell
[1:19:09] you uh the the words that I was reading
[1:19:12] I really couldn't tell you what it meant
[1:19:15] what it really really
[1:19:17] meant now you would think for me going
[1:19:20] to church me reading the Bible that I
[1:19:23] had light
[1:19:25] but just because I go to church and I
[1:19:26] read the Bible doesn't mean I have the
[1:19:29] light are you with
[1:19:35] me unless God speaks to our hearts and
[1:19:39] he opens our eyes to what the word says
[1:19:42] we're still in spiritual
[1:19:45] Darkness so that's why I never want you
[1:19:47] to get comfortable with just being in
[1:19:49] church and saying okay we did our duty
[1:19:50] for the day no I want to hear his voice
[1:19:54] I I want to make sure I'm connected I
[1:19:55] want to make sure that it's opening to
[1:19:58] me Matthew
[1:20:00] 13:10 please read follow along with us
[1:20:03] on this and the disciples came and said
[1:20:07] unto Jesus why speak thou unto these
[1:20:11] people in
[1:20:13] Parables and he answered and said unto
[1:20:15] them because it is given unto you to you
[1:20:20] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:20:22] heaven but unto these other people it is
[1:20:25] not given that's right now here's a God
[1:20:27] that's saying look I want some people to
[1:20:30] know the truth and some people not now
[1:20:32] why would he say that because they don't
[1:20:35] love
[1:20:39] him now look the real answer to hearing
[1:20:42] from God is fall more in love with him
[1:20:45] fall in love with him make it real it's
[1:20:48] not
[1:20:48] about doing things for the church it's
[1:20:52] not about giving more money right amen
[1:20:55] it's about love I love the word now how
[1:20:58] do you know you love God is when you
[1:20:59] love the word you can't love God and and
[1:21:03] and not love his word even Jesus said
[1:21:06] you call us me Lord Lord and do not the
[1:21:08] things I say if you love me keep my
[1:21:11] Commandments There's A Love Affair
[1:21:15] there verse 124
[1:21:18] whosoever have to him it shall be
[1:21:22] given and he shall have more abundance
[1:21:26] but whosoever have not from him shall be
[1:21:29] taken away even that which he haveth now
[1:21:31] what what is that mean it's like he's
[1:21:34] talking in Parables to his own disciples
[1:21:35] let me just throw a word in there for a
[1:21:37] second for whosoever have the love of
[1:21:42] God to him shall it the word be
[1:21:47] given and he shall have more abundance
[1:21:50] amen but whosoever have not the love of
[1:21:53] God from him shall be taken away even
[1:21:56] that which he already has
[1:22:01] amen therefore speak I to them in
[1:22:04] Parables because they seen they don't
[1:22:07] see and hearing they don't hear neither
[1:22:11] do they understand and in them is the is
[1:22:14] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which
[1:22:17] saith by hearing you shall hear and
[1:22:18] shall not understand and seen you shall
[1:22:20] see and shall not perceive for this
[1:22:23] people's heart is whacks gross their
[1:22:25] ears are dull of hearing their eyes have
[1:22:28] been closed they just like sit in church
[1:22:30] and they go yeah
[1:22:35] whatever L at any time they should see
[1:22:39] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[1:22:42] and should understand with their hearts
[1:22:44] and should be converted and I should
[1:22:48] heal
[1:22:49] them you know it takes the word the
[1:22:53] believing of the word to bring forth a
[1:22:57] conversion you can't just say I oh yeah
[1:23:00] I go to church I'm born again I I I I I
[1:23:04] I I believe the message that doesn't do
[1:23:07] it the word has to become open to you
[1:23:11] when I say the word I don't mean you got
[1:23:13] to um know from cover to cover that is
[1:23:16] not what I'm saying what I am saying is
[1:23:18] when God speaks to you something in this
[1:23:21] word you've got to start doing it
[1:23:23] because by you following the word that
[1:23:25] he tells you to do what you're doing is
[1:23:27] you're opening your your character your
[1:23:30] your nature to become completely born
[1:23:32] again completely converted if you notice
[1:23:36] there are people who go to church but
[1:23:37] they go out there they live like The
[1:23:41] World God is looking for a full
[1:23:43] conversion now I'm not saying it didn't
[1:23:46] start right but you know what we got to
[1:23:49] we got to finish this
[1:23:50] race it's it's not he that starts the
[1:23:53] race we got to to finish the race
[1:23:56] am and it what it takes to finish the
[1:23:59] race is the same thing that took the
[1:24:01] started your heart your love amen now
[1:24:05] look what he says here about us but
[1:24:08] blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:24:12] there's light that's com into you that
[1:24:14] you see and your ears for they
[1:24:17] hear I'm thankful for the eyes that God
[1:24:20] has given me the ears that God has given
[1:24:23] me now
[1:24:25] I'm not saying that you're going to walk
[1:24:28] out of here completely different and if
[1:24:30] you don't you know something was wrong
[1:24:33] no no this this message goes out and it
[1:24:38] just covers the thing is if you're
[1:24:41] willing to start putting forth more
[1:24:43] effort to walk in the things that God
[1:24:45] has shown you God is going to bless
[1:24:49] you but look the the spirit of this age
[1:24:52] this lukewarmness
[1:24:54] yeah it's not hot it's not
[1:24:58] cold it ain't where you just stay home
[1:25:01] all day and it ain't where you're just
[1:25:03] you know you're you leave here and you
[1:25:05] never go home and you're on the mission
[1:25:07] field it's
[1:25:10] lukewarm it it it's it's it's a
[1:25:13] knowledge of the truth but it's it's an
[1:25:15] unwillingness to put it into practice
[1:25:18] praise the lord it's exactly what it is
[1:25:20] it's it's it's a it's a it's a it's a
[1:25:22] form
[1:25:24] but I want the life I want the life for
[1:25:28] verily I say to you that many
[1:25:30] prophets and many righteous men have
[1:25:33] desired to see the things that you see
[1:25:35] today and have not seen them and to hear
[1:25:37] the things which you hear and have not
[1:25:39] heard them right I go back to all the
[1:25:42] churches that I used to go to before I
[1:25:44] came into this message and I'll tell you
[1:25:47] to to think about that they don't have
[1:25:51] what we have today you have been blessed
[1:25:53] somehow God has chosen you above
[1:25:55] everybody of all the people on the
[1:25:57] planet to give you this truth and I I
[1:26:00] say as Jesus said blessed are your eyes
[1:26:03] they see blessed are your ears for they
[1:26:05] hear we ought to be so happy what God
[1:26:08] has done for us in our lives I'll tell
[1:26:10] you you know brother B say all make a
[1:26:12] Methodist shout it all make us get in
[1:26:14] our seats and just be so thankful for
[1:26:16] the Lord we get so comfortable we just
[1:26:19] want you know when's the service over
[1:26:21] he's getting kind of excited today wish
[1:26:23] you would just stay by in the whole and
[1:26:24] just you
[1:26:25] know you know to be honest with you I
[1:26:27] wish I stayed behind the pulit
[1:26:30] too
[1:26:32] actually God
[1:26:34] knows I just
[1:26:38] just alls I can says I don't want to
[1:26:41] face the Lord not preaching other than
[1:26:43] that if he wasn't involved I certainly
[1:26:45] would never be
[1:26:47] here God has given his eyes to
[1:26:51] see God has sent a Bible profit in this
[1:26:55] generation
[1:26:59] am that's why we're a chosen
[1:27:05] generation a chosen generation most
[1:27:07] people don't know but Amos 3:7 says
[1:27:09] surely the Lord God will do
[1:27:12] nothing but he revealeth his Secrets
[1:27:15] unto his servants the
[1:27:19] prophets you know so people that think
[1:27:21] they don't need to go to church they
[1:27:23] don't need a
[1:27:26] prophet to make it are so
[1:27:29] deceived because it is the way that God
[1:27:34] chose and we've got to follow God's
[1:27:38] pattern Malachi chapter 4 verse
[1:27:41] 5 behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:27:47] before the coming of the great and
[1:27:50] Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:27:54] you know there's not a week that goes by
[1:27:56] that I'm not dealing with somebody
[1:27:59] that's talking about the end time that
[1:28:02] we're at the end and when you look at
[1:28:05] some of these people there's a dread on
[1:28:07] their
[1:28:08] face it's like a I I don't want the end
[1:28:11] to be here there's just more stuff that
[1:28:12] I want to do I want to I want to see
[1:28:15] things we are approaching the great and
[1:28:18] Dreadful day of the Lord it's it's about
[1:28:21] us it's going to happen but praise God
[1:28:24] that he sent us a Marvelous Light when
[1:28:25] he sent us Elijah
[1:28:27] 45 in the in the form in the office of a
[1:28:31] prophet now he was just a man like you
[1:28:34] and
[1:28:35] I but he held an office that was higher
[1:28:39] than
[1:28:40] ours and God forgive me I don't want to
[1:28:42] do this I don't want to stand on that
[1:28:44] place where we give our our heart but he
[1:28:47] he could stand up a little bit higher
[1:28:50] and see from God things that we could
[1:28:53] not see
[1:28:55] and then he came down here and he he
[1:28:59] started giving it to the
[1:29:01] people now I never I was never fortunate
[1:29:04] enough to be in one of his meetings
[1:29:06] brother Dennis but you know what God
[1:29:10] preserved the
[1:29:13] word and he sent somebody by my way to
[1:29:17] tell me about this
[1:29:21] messag and when I read it
[1:29:24] something clicked on the
[1:29:28] inside I can't explain
[1:29:30] it but there was a connection there amen
[1:29:34] I felt like I was a part of this that I
[1:29:36] was chosen for this amen and it was a
[1:29:41] greater light than I ever seen in all
[1:29:43] the churches I was
[1:29:45] in I'll say it's a marvelous light that
[1:29:49] God has chosen us to be a part of and
[1:29:52] you know what the purpose of this
[1:29:54] message or or what brother abam was
[1:29:58] supposed to do he was to to get us
[1:30:03] turned completely to the
[1:30:07] Lord that's
[1:30:09] it not another church not another
[1:30:13] religion but completely to him to love
[1:30:16] the Lord thy God with all thy heart with
[1:30:18] all thy soul with all thy might
[1:30:22] Amen to give him
[1:30:25] everything that to that the word of God
[1:30:28] is is never changed and that Jesus
[1:30:31] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:30:33] forever he turned us to the truth he re
[1:30:37] turned us
[1:30:40] back and you know if it wasn't needed
[1:30:43] God would have never
[1:30:45] said but it was
[1:30:47] needed it was needed Matthew chapter
[1:30:51] 17:9 are you with me amen
[1:30:54] Matthew 17:9 after Jesus was
[1:30:57] transfigured uh before his disciples
[1:30:59] they came down from the mountain and
[1:31:01] Jesus charged him he said tell the
[1:31:03] vision to no man until the son of man be
[1:31:09] risen again from the dead and all of a
[1:31:12] sudden that just sparked something
[1:31:15] inside of them and said whoa whoa whoa
[1:31:17] whoa wait a minute wait a minute the
[1:31:19] disciples asked him saying why then say
[1:31:21] the scribes that Elias must first come
[1:31:25] before this all happens why why do why
[1:31:28] do the disciples say uh or why do the
[1:31:31] scribes uh why then the scribes say uh
[1:31:35] that that Elias must first come they had
[1:31:37] this question they wanted it answered
[1:31:39] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:31:43] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:31:48] all
[1:31:51] things now
[1:32:00] because of Malachi 4
[1:32:03] six which is a due
[1:32:07] prophecy Jesus is talking about two
[1:32:10] comings of Elijah because God uses the
[1:32:12] coming of Elijah five times and I know
[1:32:14] this this can get kind of deep for for
[1:32:16] some of us that don't know these things
[1:32:18] but just try to take the words that are
[1:32:20] spoken here
[1:32:22] okay he's saying why why say the scribes
[1:32:25] that Elias must first come and Jesus
[1:32:28] answered Elias shall truly first come
[1:32:31] and restore all things so Jesus is
[1:32:35] talking about something in the future
[1:32:39] amen the spirit of Elijah will
[1:32:42] bring a Marvelous Light because it takes
[1:32:45] a Marvelous Light to restore all things
[1:32:48] does it
[1:32:50] not but this could not have been the
[1:32:53] prophet John the
[1:32:55] Baptist John the Baptist did not restore
[1:32:58] all things the Bible says that John did
[1:33:01] no
[1:33:02] Miracles he was just the voice of one
[1:33:05] crying in the wilderness prepare ye the
[1:33:07] way of the Lord first
[1:33:11] coming at this time this is Matthew 17
[1:33:14] in Matthew chapter 4 John the Baptist
[1:33:17] was in
[1:33:19] prison and they did well let's just
[1:33:22] let's just just read this why then say
[1:33:25] the scribes that Elias must first come
[1:33:28] Jesus is referring to a future tense
[1:33:32] right so it's not about John the Baptist
[1:33:35] but then he goes right back to what they
[1:33:39] were talking about in verse 12 but I say
[1:33:42] un to you that Elias is come already
[1:33:45] past tense and they have done and they
[1:33:49] knew him not see that's why they were
[1:33:52] asking why you say that that this why
[1:33:54] say the scribes that El was first come
[1:33:55] they didn't recognize it and they knew
[1:33:58] him not but have done unto him
[1:34:01] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[1:34:03] also the son of man suffer of them and
[1:34:06] the disciples understood that he spake
[1:34:09] unto them of John the Baptist so here
[1:34:11] Jesus in his ministry he's referring now
[1:34:14] to Elijah Ministry that's going to come
[1:34:16] in our
[1:34:19] age he was taking us back to the word he
[1:34:21] was taking us back to Malachi 4 amen
[1:34:24] Jesus said search the scriptures and God
[1:34:27] will always take you back to the word
[1:34:30] always after Jesus died he resurrected
[1:34:33] and he went back into heaven in Acts 3:
[1:34:36] 21 the Bible says that the heavens must
[1:34:39] receive uh the heavens must receive
[1:34:41] Jesus until the times of restitution of
[1:34:46] all things which God have spoken by the
[1:34:49] mouth of all his holy prophets since the
[1:34:53] world began amen so this is just spoken
[1:34:56] by one man by all the all the holy
[1:34:59] prophets since the world began it wasn't
[1:35:03] time for restoration yet but God
[1:35:06] promised in this age I will restore
[1:35:09] sayeth the Lord all that Satan had
[1:35:12] deteriorated God was going to restore it
[1:35:14] back to the church Revelations 10:7
[1:35:17] we're talking about The Marvelous Light
[1:35:19] in our
[1:35:20] age but in the days of the voice of the
[1:35:23] seventh Angel this is the seventh Church
[1:35:26] age messenger now when he shall begin to
[1:35:30] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:35:34] finished as he have declared to his
[1:35:37] servants the
[1:35:39] prophets right that means this message
[1:35:43] is going to clear up every question
[1:35:46] you're going to have
[1:35:48] amen if you're wondering about
[1:35:52] something it the answer is in that
[1:35:55] message there's no doubt about it it's a
[1:35:58] glorious light a marvelous
[1:36:01] light and you know time has slipped away
[1:36:05] to where I can't even get to where all I
[1:36:08] want to get to so we're going to be
[1:36:11] skipping some stuff turn with me to
[1:36:13] First John chapter 1 this glorious
[1:36:17] message was sent to
[1:36:20] us and God wants us to walk in this
[1:36:23] truth 1 John 1 verse 5 this then is the
[1:36:29] message which we have heard of him and
[1:36:32] now we're declaring unto you that God is
[1:36:37] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:36:42] not even a little bit
[1:36:45] none now the problem is we all got
[1:36:51] Darkness but who cares enough about that
[1:36:55] Darkness who cares enough to start
[1:36:59] getting it
[1:37:01] out because what we need to do is
[1:37:04] arise our light has come we need to
[1:37:07] arise out of our Darkness amen amen if
[1:37:11] we say that we have fellowship with God
[1:37:14] and walk in darkness we actually lie and
[1:37:17] we do not the truth amen but if we walk
[1:37:20] in the light that God has shown us as he
[1:37:24] is in the light that's what that means
[1:37:26] he will we have Fellowship one with
[1:37:29] another and then the blood of Jesus
[1:37:32] Christ his son cleanses us from all
[1:37:37] sins my how how happy we ought to be
[1:37:42] right if we say that we have no sin I
[1:37:46] don't need to come to the altar I don't
[1:37:48] need to pray I don't need to seek the I
[1:37:50] don't need to say sorry I don't need to
[1:37:54] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:37:57] not in
[1:37:59] us but if we confess our sins he is
[1:38:02] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[1:38:04] sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:38:08] unrighteousness praise the Lord such a
[1:38:12] simple thing we got to do you don't have
[1:38:14] to worry about doing cartwheels back
[1:38:17] flips stand on your head hold your
[1:38:20] breath for three
[1:38:22] minutes just be honest with God it's it
[1:38:25] in order to in order to just confess
[1:38:27] your sin it takes
[1:38:29] love because it's not our nature to want
[1:38:32] to say yeah it was
[1:38:33] wrong in fact if if I do something wrong
[1:38:36] to Jonathan I it would Pro My Flesh
[1:38:39] would probably say well the only reason
[1:38:40] I did it because blah blah blah
[1:38:42] blah right that's what my flesh wants to
[1:38:46] say so you go against nature but if I
[1:38:50] love God and I know it displeases God to
[1:38:53] have something between me and
[1:38:55] Jonathan I'm just going to confess it I
[1:38:59] confess I'm just getting it out there
[1:39:01] amen and then I can approach god with
[1:39:04] boldness God I am sorry cover me with
[1:39:06] your blood amen cover me with the blood
[1:39:09] from Calvary and it's that simple that's
[1:39:11] what a love affair is with God it's not
[1:39:14] nothing special where you know all the
[1:39:15] Bible it's living what you do
[1:39:18] know praise the Lord Matthew Chapter 5
[1:39:21] verse1 14
[1:39:23] and is this has this been good enough to
[1:39:26] where I can hold you just a couple
[1:39:28] minutes okay because we you know we had
[1:39:31] a we had a special and we had extra
[1:39:33] things going on they got started late
[1:39:36] and all right Matthew chapter 5:14 Jesus
[1:39:39] speaking to us he said you are the light
[1:39:41] of the
[1:39:43] world a city that is set on a hill
[1:39:47] cannot be hid how many has you know gone
[1:39:50] over maybe like uh
[1:39:53] in in that Hill there in can
[1:39:58] Cincinnati and that at night you come
[1:40:01] over that hill and it just opens up and
[1:40:03] all the lights are
[1:40:05] on oh you we've we've seen pictures at
[1:40:08] night we've been in a plane at night
[1:40:09] you're coming down you see the
[1:40:12] city
[1:40:14] the if all the lights are off you can't
[1:40:17] see but when the lights are on you can
[1:40:19] see and here Jesus is saying this saying
[1:40:22] to us a city that's set on a hill cannot
[1:40:26] be hid neither do men light a candle and
[1:40:29] put it under a bushel but on a
[1:40:32] Candlestick that it giveth light into
[1:40:34] all that are in the house the gospel is
[1:40:38] not something to be hid from
[1:40:44] others let your light so shine before
[1:40:49] men that they may see your good works
[1:40:53] and glorify your father which is in
[1:40:55] heaven am now I know if there were some
[1:40:58] people they would have probably wrote
[1:41:00] the word like this let your light so
[1:41:02] shine before men that they may see your
[1:41:05] good works and glorify you on
[1:41:10] Earth but
[1:41:12] God deserves all the
[1:41:15] glory if you've got any light inside you
[1:41:19] that is the grace of
[1:41:21] God why would you want to steal Glory
[1:41:23] from
[1:41:25] God now that word shine when Jesus said
[1:41:28] let your light so shine shine means to
[1:41:31] give
[1:41:32] light not to say I've got light to give
[1:41:37] it it means to beam it amen in other
[1:41:42] words you got your low beams in the car
[1:41:45] and your high
[1:41:46] beams you beam
[1:41:49] it it means with radiant brilliancy
[1:41:54] God wants to see all of us beaming in
[1:41:56] the
[1:41:57] light beam
[1:41:59] it not just beam it to people that don't
[1:42:04] know the
[1:42:06] Lord but beam it to
[1:42:09] me Paul told Timothy to be an example
[1:42:13] unto the believer right be it one to
[1:42:16] another I need
[1:42:18] you that's right you need one another I
[1:42:20] was I was going to say you need me but
[1:42:22] I'm not going to say that we need one
[1:42:23] another we need one another we need to
[1:42:26] beam and help one another am and you
[1:42:29] know part of that light is Love part of
[1:42:32] it is forgiveness part of is I
[1:42:34] unconditionally accept you without
[1:42:36] respect to
[1:42:38] persons part of it is given a helping
[1:42:40] hand part of it is when somebody knocks
[1:42:42] on the door and says something you're
[1:42:46] there but you've got Light Beam
[1:42:50] it now it's hard to beam the light if
[1:42:53] you're filled with
[1:42:56] self
[1:42:57] selfishness Strife anger hatred wrath
[1:43:00] anxiety it it's it's hard to Shine the
[1:43:04] Light if you're filled with
[1:43:09] Darkness all right 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:43:12] 4 now believe me I'm going to go
[1:43:16] through I'm going to bypass a lot of
[1:43:18] this
[1:43:20] but we got some good word word here in 2
[1:43:24] Corinthians CH 4:6 about this light that
[1:43:27] God wants us to shine for God who
[1:43:30] commanded the light to shine now notice
[1:43:32] it's a commandment to shine out of
[1:43:34] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:43:38] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:43:40] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:43:42] Christ but but we have this light or
[1:43:46] this treasure in earn
[1:43:49] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:43:51] may be of God
[1:43:53] and not of
[1:43:55] us now look this is how you shine it
[1:43:58] we're troubled on every side but we're
[1:44:00] not distressed
[1:44:03] right we're perplexed about what's going
[1:44:06] on but we're not
[1:44:09] despair we're persecuted all around
[1:44:12] we're getting
[1:44:14] persecuted but we're not forsaken God's
[1:44:16] still with us we're cast down people
[1:44:21] cast us down but we're not
[1:44:23] destroyed always bearing about in the
[1:44:28] body our body the dying of the Lord
[1:44:31] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[1:44:33] be made manifest in our body for we
[1:44:36] which live are always delivered to the
[1:44:38] death of Jesus sake for jesus' sake that
[1:44:41] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:44:43] manifest in our mortal flesh so then
[1:44:45] death worketh in us but life in you amen
[1:44:50] I say today it's time for us to arise
[1:44:54] out of the darkness that we're
[1:44:57] in now remember if we say we have no
[1:45:00] Darkness we lie think about what God has
[1:45:04] been speaking to you what just take a
[1:45:05] look at your life what are some of the
[1:45:07] things that you know has not been
[1:45:10] pleasing it's time to rise out of
[1:45:13] ourselves out of the darkness out of the
[1:45:14] out of the flesh the selfishness or out
[1:45:16] of our will out of our anger our Strife
[1:45:19] our our our our hopelessness our our
[1:45:22] anxiety are are getting upset it's time
[1:45:25] for us to rise out of that because the
[1:45:28] light of God has come to our hearts now
[1:45:30] we got to take the step and it's arise
[1:45:33] and get and move away from that amen you
[1:45:35] can't wait for your circumstances to be
[1:45:39] better before you choose to walk in the
[1:45:43] light that's not
[1:45:45] love that's not love that mean you know
[1:45:47] take all the demons away take all my
[1:45:49] Temptations away surround me with such
[1:45:51] loving people and I'll be a good
[1:45:53] Christian
[1:45:56] no put me in the worst condition and Let
[1:45:59] Me Shine for
[1:46:01] Jesus put me in the greatest Temptation
[1:46:03] Let Me Shine for
[1:46:05] Jesus it's time to
[1:46:08] arise to rise oh rise like we're sitting
[1:46:11] down eventually we're going to rise up
[1:46:13] right you're probably hoping brother
[1:46:14] John I wish we would have rise I've been
[1:46:16] sitting here a
[1:46:19] while uh just write this down Romans
[1:46:22] chapter 3 13:
[1:46:26] 11-14 it's the the night is far spent
[1:46:29] the day is at hand it's time to cast off
[1:46:31] the works of darkness and put on the
[1:46:33] armor of
[1:46:35] light Colossians 3:8 through1
[1:46:39] 15 we're supposed to put off anger wrath
[1:46:42] malice blasphemy filthy communication
[1:46:44] out of our mouth lie not one to another
[1:46:46] see you put off the old man as he take
[1:46:48] those things off and put on as the elect
[1:46:50] of God bows of Mercy
[1:46:54] yes you know hatred is of the devil amen
[1:46:58] put it off it's a work of
[1:47:00] Darkness the spirit of hatred literally
[1:47:03] binds people from seeing
[1:47:07] straight and if you you just you read
