[41:27] you you build your way up and we are a
[41:31] spiritual
[41:33] house for the Lord but we're called
[41:38] living or Lively stones and it it I it
[41:42] isn't just by coincidence that Peter was
[41:45] chosen to get the Revelation who Jesus
[41:49] was because his
[41:51] name meaning Stone and of course the
[41:55] only thing that can be a rock or or a
[41:57] stone is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:00] when he reveals something to us it is
[42:03] it's
[42:04] solid and we are Lively stones in other
[42:07] words we're living we've got a
[42:09] revelation of Jesus Christ of what he
[42:11] wants us to do and how we need to build
[42:15] for him to live in us right amen so
[42:19] following the Bible it's hard today it's
[42:22] getting harder to follow the Bible
[42:24] people have lost respect for the Bible
[42:27] we know that they even mocked it at the
[42:30] at at the at at these uh Olympics at the
[42:36] ceremony at the
[42:37] beginning uh people are just not
[42:40] interested in the guidance of the Bible
[42:42] amen amen Abraham Lincoln said our 16th
[42:46] president he he only had two Bibles or
[42:49] two two books that he read brother BR
[42:51] Tau us that one of them was the Bible
[42:53] and one of them was the uh uh Pilgrim's
[42:56] Progress and that was what guided and
[42:59] developed his whole life those two
[43:04] books I'm thankful for every brother and
[43:07] sister that's ever helped me or my
[43:10] family or my
[43:12] children uh I just appreciate good
[43:17] guidance and we just can't get enough of
[43:19] that we just can't get enough of it
[43:22] Martin Luther King Jr said our
[43:24] scientific power has outrun our
[43:28] spiritual power we have guided missiles
[43:32] and misguided
[43:35] men people are more interested in what
[43:39] they can do rather than what they should
[43:42] be
[43:43] doing you lsis S Grant he's our 18th
[43:47] president he said this he said hold fast
[43:50] to the
[43:51] Bible to the influence of this book we
[43:55] Are indebted for all the progress made
[43:58] in true
[44:00] civilization and he said and to this we
[44:03] must look as our guide to the Future
[44:07] amen our guide to the Future right we
[44:10] want to be guided by the Bible amen if
[44:14] anybody wants to know the future or
[44:16] their future all you got to do is look
[44:19] at the Bible amen and that'll tell you
[44:22] according to a University of Illinois
[44:25] study the Farmer's
[44:28] Alik alic is only 52% accurate at
[44:33] weather forecasting which is similar to
[44:36] a random
[44:38] chance but the
[44:40] Publishers claim that many longtime alic
[44:45] followers claimed that their forecasts
[44:48] are 80% to 85% accurate on their
[44:52] website we know how accurate the weather
[44:55] can be whatever they say that day it it
[44:58] may change in i' I've honestly it's not
[45:01] supposed to rain and it's raining on me
[45:04] but I say we have one book that is 100%
[45:08] accurate till we can know what the
[45:09] future is
[45:11] am last week we we read where Jesus said
[45:15] in John 14 in my father's house are many
[45:18] mansions if it were not so I would have
[45:19] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[45:23] this is like the
[45:25] beginning of the the preparation cuz
[45:28] he's on Earth he said I'm leaving and
[45:32] what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
[45:34] prepare a place for you and if I go to
[45:37] prepare a place for you I will come
[45:38] again and receive you to myself that
[45:40] where I am there you may be also right
[45:43] in God's in God's house his kingdom it's
[45:48] it's a it's like a resident where he
[45:50] lives but inside that there's small
[45:53] dwellings and we that's us amen that's
[45:57] us those are our our homes inside of his
[46:01] home so Jesus is preparing each one of
[46:04] these dwellings right now as we're
[46:08] speaking this very moment he's preparing
[46:11] those places for us I want you to think
[46:12] about that I mean he created everything
[46:16] and he could just he could
[46:19] create um um flies and frogs he can
[46:24] create anything just instantly why can't
[46:26] he just create our our home for us over
[46:29] there amen because it's going through
[46:32] free
[46:34] agency amen you have to be the one
[46:37] that's working with him we are workers
[46:39] together with Christ this building is
[46:42] transpiring together because he's not
[46:44] going to have
[46:45] robots
[46:48] amen and by the time this house gets all
[46:51] done this dwelling gets all done we find
[46:53] out in Revelations 21 if you want to
[46:55] turn there Revelations
[46:58] 21:1 this is when our dwelling is all
[47:01] prepared it's all
[47:03] done right starts to verse one and I saw
[47:06] a new Heaven and a new Earth for the
[47:09] first Heaven and Earth were were passed
[47:11] away and there was no more SE and I John
[47:15] saw the holy city the New Jerusalem and
[47:18] it was coming down from God out of
[47:22] heaven right amen prepared as a bride a
[47:26] Dorn for her
[47:29] husband now this word prepared is the
[47:31] same word that Jesus used I go to
[47:34] prepare a place it's the exact same word
[47:38] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[47:40] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[47:44] with men that's right and he will dwell
[47:48] with them and they shall be his people
[47:50] and God himself shall be with them and
[47:51] be their God remember Jesus said in that
[47:54] day you'll know that I'm in the father
[47:56] you and me and I and you and God shall
[47:59] wipe away all the tears from their eyes
[48:00] and there shall be no more death nor
[48:02] sorrow or crying neither shall there be
[48:04] any more pain for the former things are
[48:06] passed away and he that sat upon the
[48:08] throne said behold I make all things new
[48:13] amen I I I when I look at this statement
[48:17] it's not separate from I'm looking at it
[48:19] is that he makes me new
[48:22] amen because he can't
[48:24] dwell in the old worldly
[48:28] nature and he said right for these words
[48:32] are true and they're faithful and he
[48:35] said it is done I am the Alpha and Omega
[48:37] the beginning the end I will give unto
[48:39] him that is a thirst of the Fountain of
[48:42] the Water of Life freely so who does he
[48:44] give it
[48:46] to Amen to those who are thirsty he's
[48:49] not given it to anybody that just says
[48:52] well I'm a Child of
[48:53] God no it don't work like that you have
[48:56] to get in a condition to
[49:00] thirst right blessed are they that
[49:02] hunger and thirst for they shall be
[49:07] filled I've never seen anybody too
[49:10] hungry too
[49:12] thirsty for the
[49:15] Lord God is good he that overcometh
[49:18] shall inherit all things and I will be
[49:21] his God and he shall be my
[49:24] son prise isn't that beautiful
[49:27] Jesus goes he he goes to prepare a a
[49:30] residence an abodes homes for us and and
[49:34] it they all sit in his gated if I could
[49:37] say it like that his gated residence and
[49:40] there's a a new Heaven A New Earth and
[49:43] this very Tabernacle is US amen it's us
[49:48] amen and this is why it's really really
[49:52] important to to get actively involved in
[49:57] getting prepared for God to live in US
[50:00] amen you know there is such a a a
[50:04] demonic um a demonic Doctrine you know
[50:10] once you get baptized you're
[50:14] saved and you don't have to do anything
[50:18] anymore
[50:21] right and that you you might be able to
[50:24] find one or two scriptures three four
[50:27] five you know believe on the Lord
[50:29] confess with your mouth and you're
[50:31] saved okay but it don't dovetail with
[50:33] the rest of the Bible so that's why I
[50:35] say that that understanding isn't
[50:37] correct so God wants us to move with him
[50:43] in this preparation amen so God's given
[50:47] us a
[50:48] responsibility with a promise and that's
[50:52] what we must overcome we must prevail
[50:56] conquer we must subdue and what is that
[50:59] we must Prevail over our nature that
[51:02] wants everything for ourself to we
[51:05] everything becomes for God yes brother
[51:08] Bram said that man is always looking at
[51:11] the
[51:13] past about what he's accomplished or
[51:15] what has happened in his life or he's
[51:17] looking to the future of what's going to
[51:19] happen and he misses what God is trying
[51:22] to do at that very
[51:24] moment and God is in renovating he's
[51:27] trying to renovate us amen he's working
[51:31] on us amen and this uh this really puts
[51:35] the fear of God in Me because I believe
[51:38] there's one thing that we should be
[51:40] focused on above everything one thing
[51:43] laser focused and that is God preparing
[51:47] us for eternity
[51:49] am instead of this thing well I'm going
[51:52] to heaven what is there to prepare for
[51:55] you understand it's we're Lively Stones
[51:57] amen we're not something that's in the
[51:59] past it's it we're alive
[52:03] amen the shedding of blood alone doesn't
[52:06] prepare
[52:08] us the blood alone does not make us
[52:13] Overcomers it's not a onesided
[52:16] relationship it's
[52:18] two-sided the life of that blood has to
[52:21] come upon the believer and that believer
[52:25] has to start
[52:27] keeping the
[52:31] word we are the one that have to subdue
[52:35] that ugly nature inside of us that just
[52:37] says no I don't want to serve God no I
[52:39] don't want to pray no I don't want to
[52:41] listen to No I don't want to make
[52:42] sacrifices no I don't that thing needs
[52:45] to be overcomed amen because that is not
[52:48] a home prepared for God am that's why I
[52:51] say it's not a one-sided relationship
[52:53] it's what God did for me no the effect
[52:56] of what God did for you has to come
[52:58] inside of you and begin to mold
[53:02] you Revelations 12 111 says and they
[53:05] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by
[53:07] the word of their testimony and they
[53:09] love not their lives unto death see you
[53:12] just can't take the
[53:14] blood you can you can take the blood and
[53:17] love your
[53:18] life right I claim the blood go do
[53:21] whatever you want to
[53:22] do that's you're not going to overcome
[53:24] with that this is a three-part
[53:26] ingredient that you got to have amen and
[53:29] we need all three to get
[53:31] prepared he that overcometh shall
[53:33] inherit all things what are all
[53:37] things
[53:39] wow it's got to be good right if God's
[53:42] we're going to hear it all things that's
[53:45] so exciting to me amen I mean I I can't
[53:49] wait but let's just tap in just a little
[53:50] bit of of what I I feel the Lord has
[53:53] showed us here in 1 Corinthians chapter
[53:54] 2:9
[53:56] 1 Corinthians chapter 2:9 says but as it
[53:59] is written I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[54:05] neither have it entered into the heart
[54:08] of man the things which God have there
[54:13] it is again prepared for them that love
[54:17] him right notice which God has prepared
[54:22] for them that love him now obviously if
[54:26] you know it isn't about go uh God loving
[54:29] us because God proved his love for God
[54:31] so loved the world that he gave you know
[54:33] he proved his love to everybody so but
[54:36] not everybody loves God so he's not
[54:39] preparing this for the world right he's
[54:41] preparing this for those who love him
[54:44] now how do I know if I love him I feel
[54:47] it no Jesus said if if I do love him I
[54:51] got to keep the Commandment that's the
[54:52] only way I can know amen
[54:57] It's A Love Affair
[54:59] amen we just can't go to the library
[55:02] watch some documentary and see what God
[55:04] has prepared for us it just hasn't
[55:08] entered into I'll say it like this the
[55:11] natural part of man to see what God has
[55:15] but I love verse 10 but God have
[55:18] revealed them unto us by his
[55:22] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[55:25] things y even the Deep things of God
[55:29] Amen God has revealed them to us as
[55:35] we're getting prepared amen I hope you
[55:38] can catch this when God by his holy
[55:41] spirit speaks to you and says this is
[55:44] what we're working on in the renovation
[55:46] this is what we're working on as we're
[55:48] redoing your house as we're preparing
[55:51] this is what we're going to work on
[55:52] first this is what we're going to do
[55:54] today this is how how we're going to
[55:56] move this out and move this in
[56:00] yes because you know what when God
[56:02] speaks to you his will that's all you're
[56:05] going to find in
[56:06] heaven
[56:09] amen you're going to find his will in
[56:13] fact he didn't like Satan doing his will
[56:15] so he got kicked
[56:17] out see it hasn't entered into natural
[56:21] man the things that God has prepared the
[56:23] Bible says that man cannot cannot even
[56:27] understand those things right they're
[56:29] spiritually discerned so God by his Holy
[56:32] Spirit unveils what this really means
[56:35] Amen to our personal heart and it means
[56:38] so much to us that he would even speak
[56:41] to
[56:42] us that we take that word and we say yes
[56:46] Lord I want to dress myself with that I
[56:48] want to become more like you I want to
[56:50] get ready for you to dwell in me for
[56:53] eternity and so as he reveals
[56:56] by his Spirit we're actually getting
[56:58] prepared that's the preparation process
[57:02] amen he reveals to us what he wants us
[57:04] to do what virtue he wants us to work on
[57:07] what characteristic of Christ we need to
[57:09] be what fruit we need to be bearing what
[57:12] part of the character and nature of God
[57:14] that he wants us to be yes I mean we've
[57:17] all we've all renovated some room before
[57:21] right or or watched it uh if we haven't
[57:24] done it we've we've kind of watched it
[57:28] uh on Bob's build this house or This Old
[57:32] House or something like that you can see
[57:35] uh YouTube videos
[57:40] and you you certainly aren't going to be
[57:42] painting the room if you got to redo the
[57:45] plumbing and move the
[57:48] electric right so there's certain things
[57:51] that God wants you to work on Amen first
[57:54] now we don't know what they are but God
[57:56] does
[57:58] Amen so Paul is telling the Philippian
[58:01] Church wherefore my beloved we're going
[58:04] to go back to the the scriptures every
[58:05] but I just want to read this as ye have
[58:07] always obeyed not in my presence only
[58:09] but now much more in my absence work out
[58:11] your own salvation with fear and
[58:14] trembling in other words this is a
[58:16] reality of what's Happening amen you
[58:18] know there's people that go in and out
[58:19] of the church and they're just clueless
[58:21] of what's Happening they don't see God
[58:24] they don't hear God's voice they just
[58:26] for some reason they go to church and
[58:28] they somehow get something uh from just
[58:32] doing that but but God is really working
[58:35] we are the Church of God inside us God
[58:37] is working and he says for it is God
[58:39] which worketh in you both to Will and to
[58:41] do of what his good
[58:43] pleasure it is his pleasure that's
[58:46] working on my character amen it's it's
[58:50] it's preparing me for him to live in me
[58:52] for
[58:53] eternity I have not seen is not heard
[58:56] neither is it entered into the heart of
[58:57] the man which uh the things which God
[59:01] have
[59:03] prepared for them that love him but God
[59:07] have revealed them unto us by his
[59:12] Spirit oh this is so beautiful we're
[59:15] seeing God in the spiritual realm
[59:19] amen the natural man thinks like this
[59:22] well when I get to heaven I think I'm
[59:24] going to be floating on the cloud and
[59:26] going by Brother Neville and saying Hey
[59:28] Brother Neville remember brother Ram
[59:31] talking about that that's how the
[59:33] natural man thinks Heaven
[59:36] is but then when he went on to the other
[59:38] side he said it'll be nothing but
[59:41] perfect love amen big difference between
[59:45] naturally seeing or what what heaven's
[59:48] going to be to
[59:49] spiritually knowing what have nothing
[59:52] but perfect love can enter in there I
[59:56] just love that 1 John 4:16 says and we
[59:59] have known and believe that the love of
[1:00:01] God uh uh the love that God have to us
[1:00:05] God is love and he that dwelleth in Love
[1:00:08] Actually dwells in God and God in him I
[1:00:12] believe this is what God is showing
[1:00:15] those that love
[1:00:17] him so when God speaks to our heart this
[1:00:20] is what I want you to do love them just
[1:00:23] do it sir
[1:00:26] God is beginning to reveal to us what
[1:00:30] eternity is going to be all about you
[1:00:33] know we can look come to church and hear
[1:00:34] these things like dos and don'ts and
[1:00:36] laws and things like that but I'll tell
[1:00:38] you what God promised that he'd put the
[1:00:40] laws in my heart amen It's A Love Affair
[1:00:44] and if we if we want to to be a
[1:00:47] tabernacle for God we got to start the
[1:00:49] renovation process we're in control can
[1:00:52] you imagine going up to the job where
[1:00:54] you're supposed to be working and saying
[1:00:56] no I ain't going to work tear that wall
[1:00:59] upm not going to do it I'm just here to
[1:01:02] get paid I'm just here to get blessed
[1:01:05] I'm just here to receive the blessings
[1:01:06] of
[1:01:07] God look the down here we could receive
[1:01:11] all kinds of blessings but this message
[1:01:14] is about how to get ready how to how to
[1:01:16] follow the guide and get ready for
[1:01:20] eternity so he says do all things
[1:01:22] without
[1:01:23] murmuring and disputing
[1:01:26] do you ever be working with somebody and
[1:01:28] they just
[1:01:29] murmured uhuh they maybe wouldn't do it
[1:01:31] in front of the bosss but they just you
[1:01:33] know you know what I'm talking about
[1:01:35] right we don't want to murmur with what
[1:01:37] the word is telling us to do that you
[1:01:39] may be blameless and harmless as sons of
[1:01:42] God without rebuke in the midst of a
[1:01:43] crooked and perverse nation which we are
[1:01:45] in among whom you shine as lights in the
[1:01:49] world all right back to 1 Corinthians
[1:01:51] 2:11 now for what man knoweth the things
[1:01:54] of a man say the spirit of man with is
[1:01:56] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[1:01:58] no man no man but the spirit of God we
[1:02:03] can't expect a an ant or an antalope to
[1:02:08] to know how to build a car uh build a
[1:02:11] rocket build a missile build a
[1:02:14] skyscraper it's just not even in him to
[1:02:17] even understand that neither is it
[1:02:20] inside of a man to understand how to get
[1:02:23] to heaven we need the Holy Ghost app
[1:02:26] point us we need him to show us what
[1:02:28] this word really is
[1:02:31] saying because eternity is God's it's
[1:02:34] not ours
[1:02:36] right and we can't rely on man we can't
[1:02:39] rely on our own understanding we can't
[1:02:41] lean to our own understanding we got to
[1:02:44] trust God we got to trust his word yes
[1:02:48] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:02:50] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:02:54] that you might know the things that are
[1:02:55] freely given to us of God which things
[1:02:59] also we speak not in The Words which
[1:03:01] man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things
[1:03:06] with spiritual but the natural man
[1:03:08] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:03:10] of God for they are foolishness onto him
[1:03:12] neither can he know them because they
[1:03:13] are spiritually discerned
[1:03:16] right we're Lively Stones amen we're
[1:03:21] built up a spiritual house amen that
[1:03:24] means everything that we really truly
[1:03:27] are is through Revelation from God it's
[1:03:31] in the spirit realm now the the world is
[1:03:33] full of churches that have people in
[1:03:35] them that are
[1:03:37] trying humanly to just put peacock
[1:03:41] feathers as it were
[1:03:43] inside on the outside of them and saying
[1:03:46] yes I'm a Christian I believe
[1:03:50] God but they refuse to humble thems and
[1:03:53] say God I want to empty out and be
[1:03:55] filled with the Holy
[1:03:58] Ghost now that's a
[1:04:01] copycat God's not going to dwell in that
[1:04:04] for
[1:04:05] eternity the inside has to be filled
[1:04:08] with him amen all right Ephesians
[1:04:11] 2:19 we
[1:04:12] we I like to say we need to hurry but I
[1:04:15] I just know by Revelation I'll never
[1:04:17] finish my
[1:04:19] notes got a bad bad track record
[1:04:23] Ephesians 2:19 says now there therefore
[1:04:26] you are no more
[1:04:29] strangers and
[1:04:30] foreigners but your fellow citizens with
[1:04:33] the Saints and of the household of God
[1:04:37] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:04:41] Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ
[1:04:43] himself being the Chief Cornerstone in
[1:04:46] whom all the building fitly joined
[1:04:51] together groweth unto a holy Temple in
[1:04:55] the Lord
[1:04:56] right I love that it's growing you
[1:05:00] notice it wasn't when we gave our heart
[1:05:02] to the Lord it wasn't when our sins got
[1:05:06] covered it wasn't when he took them away
[1:05:09] as far as the East is from the
[1:05:11] west but it's in that he gives us
[1:05:13] another day of life he shows us what he
[1:05:15] wants to do and we fit in the word amen
[1:05:19] we're fitly joined together and what's
[1:05:21] it for we're growing into a holy Temple
[1:05:26] that that's being that was revealed in
[1:05:28] Revelations 21 for God to live in us
[1:05:31] through eternity in whom ye also are
[1:05:35] builded together for a habitation of God
[1:05:38] through the
[1:05:40] spirit you know this is so rich am it
[1:05:43] it's it's so deep but yet it's so simple
[1:05:46] right amen we must follow our guide as
[1:05:50] he's leading us to be fitly joined
[1:05:53] together for a h for a habitation for
[1:05:55] him now he's renovating our current
[1:06:00] house he doesn't kill us and say I'm
[1:06:03] done with you I'm going to create a new
[1:06:05] body he takes your life and he says he
[1:06:07] knocks on your door and he says would
[1:06:09] you like to come to
[1:06:11] Heaven you said you know I do Lord okay
[1:06:14] this is what you need to do repent get
[1:06:17] baptized and then you start following
[1:06:20] what I tell you to do one day at a time
[1:06:22] amen do not try to live the whole word
[1:06:24] at one day don't don't put yourself up
[1:06:27] for
[1:06:29] failure but when you you truly hear
[1:06:32] something God speak in your heart just
[1:06:34] go do that you'll see how God blesses
[1:06:36] you it may have nothing to do with what
[1:06:39] you think it is but it is exactly what
[1:06:41] God wants you to
[1:06:42] do he's the only one that knows how he
[1:06:46] wants his dwelling to be remember
[1:06:49] because God is sending him down coming
[1:06:51] down with him to to to the new to the
[1:06:54] new Earth
[1:06:56] and he knows what he wants to dwell in
[1:06:58] right I can
[1:07:00] guarantee if if I never talked to
[1:07:04] brother
[1:07:05] Stan and I said brother Stan I want you
[1:07:08] to work on the church but don't ever
[1:07:09] talk to me it better be exactly the way
[1:07:11] I want it to
[1:07:13] be you know it would have never got done
[1:07:16] the way that it is it takes some sort of
[1:07:20] communication some kind of unveiling
[1:07:22] this is what I think we should do right
[1:07:26] to try to be so proud to think that I
[1:07:30] don't need to come to church I don't
[1:07:31] need to listen to word I don't need to
[1:07:32] read I don't need to listen to taste I
[1:07:34] can make it on my own how can you ever
[1:07:36] be prepared for God with a spirit like
[1:07:39] that we need to work out our Salvation
[1:07:41] what Fe we need to mean business when we
[1:07:44] come to
[1:07:45] church because it's a real thing and
[1:07:48] I'll just say it like this we don't want
[1:07:49] to miss our time of visitation
[1:07:53] amen we need to pay attention to the
[1:07:55] word God gives us in instructions of how
[1:07:58] we need to renovate it what we what he
[1:08:01] wants to see in this area of our
[1:08:04] life we've all
[1:08:07] remodeled
[1:08:12] renovated you don't throw away
[1:08:16] everything he didn't throw your soul
[1:08:20] away he's just converting
[1:08:23] it he's taking something old and making
[1:08:26] all things new
[1:08:29] amen renovate means to restore to a good
[1:08:35] State he's
[1:08:37] renovating and this is how we follow our
[1:08:39] guide to a good State Romans 12:1 tells
[1:08:43] us Romans 12 vers1 I beseech you
[1:08:46] therefore if you like if you're serious
[1:08:48] and you I really mean business with God
[1:08:50] okay here it is I beseech you therefore
[1:08:52] Brethren by the mercies of God that that
[1:08:55] you present
[1:08:57] yourself present your body a Living
[1:09:00] Sacrifice amen Lord here I am let's go
[1:09:04] to work what do you want me to
[1:09:05] do holy and acceptable unto God which is
[1:09:09] what your reasonable service it is the
[1:09:12] least thing you don't make me chase you
[1:09:16] around don't make me bring so many
[1:09:18] things into your life make it chaotic
[1:09:20] because I can't get you to that's what
[1:09:22] the prophet said he couldn't get the
[1:09:24] bride to sit still long enough to get
[1:09:26] her
[1:09:27] dressed to get her ready for the
[1:09:32] wedding the reasonable or rational thing
[1:09:35] for us to do is to follow our guide as
[1:09:39] he speaks to
[1:09:41] us so get alone enough to mean business
[1:09:44] God don't sit around waiting for God to
[1:09:46] bless
[1:09:47] you take a take a moment and say God I'm
[1:09:50] here
[1:09:51] because I really want to build my
[1:09:54] relationship ship with you I want to get
[1:09:57] ready for you to live in me and I know
[1:09:59] I'm not ready yet I just want to take
[1:10:01] this time I I don't got a lot of money I
[1:10:04] don't even have a lot of time but you
[1:10:06] know what I got my heart and I'm giving
[1:10:07] it to you Lord am verse two and be not
[1:10:11] conformed to this
[1:10:13] world so how does this transformation
[1:10:16] happen but ye are transformed by the
[1:10:19] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:10:22] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:10:24] perfect will of God
[1:10:27] come subject to the word right so you're
[1:10:30] you're hearing the gospel you come to
[1:10:31] church you hear the gospel preached it
[1:10:33] is no longer brother John it is no
[1:10:35] longer Brother
[1:10:37] Bruce it's not it is God
[1:10:42] speaking you know what I feel uh I I
[1:10:45] feel like I need to say that again for
[1:10:47] some reason I don't know why but I I I
[1:10:50] believe it with all my heart amen you
[1:10:53] know did you know God can use us and we
[1:10:55] don't even know how many's ever had that
[1:10:56] happen some me said something you said
[1:10:59] to me oh it just blessed me I knew it
[1:11:01] came right from God said what I didn't
[1:11:03] even know it right amen look God knows
[1:11:07] what he's doing amen we we just we got
[1:11:11] to renew our mind to the way God thinks
[1:11:14] yes we get away from God we get away
[1:11:16] from the word we get away from his
[1:11:18] presence and we get doing our own thing
[1:11:20] over here and before you know it we're
[1:11:22] just thinking without God
[1:11:25] I mean we may think about God but we're
[1:11:28] thinking about God on our terms and now
[1:11:31] we come and we subject oursel to the
[1:11:32] word brother we come to church to find
[1:11:34] out where we're at with God then we hear
[1:11:37] what what God speaks and then we say yes
[1:11:39] Lord amen right and if you truly truly
[1:11:45] want
[1:11:46] this it happens amen your life changes
[1:11:50] from Glory unto Glory it's that real we
[1:11:54] are changed
[1:11:57] so we need to give God Liberty in our
[1:11:59] Temple give him
[1:12:01] Liberty if Calvary purchased our
[1:12:04] Salvation then it also purchased our
[1:12:07] life can you say Amen to that amen I I I
[1:12:10] mean our life
[1:12:12] here so you're not your own you're
[1:12:14] bought with the price therefore glorify
[1:12:16] glorify God in your body your spirit
[1:12:18] which are
[1:12:20] Gods so give God
[1:12:22] Liberty Second Corinthians 3:17 I just
[1:12:25] love this scripture now the Lord is that
[1:12:28] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:12:29] is there's liberty right you say God's
[1:12:32] in your
[1:12:33] heart you say you're filled with the
[1:12:35] Holy Ghost you say you're walking in the
[1:12:38] spirit you say God's with
[1:12:41] you but God can't even have Liberty to
[1:12:45] follow his word in your
[1:12:47] life come on right amen where the spirit
[1:12:53] of the Lord is there's liberty
[1:12:55] so if God's there let him have his way
[1:12:57] in your life am and if you if you feel
[1:13:01] that well he's he's he's he's kind of
[1:13:03] there but not as much as I want well
[1:13:05] that's fine I'm I'm with you there but
[1:13:07] the thing that we need to do is start
[1:13:09] Ying right start Ying to the Lord I I
[1:13:12] want more of you Lord I I want to come
[1:13:14] to church I want to be in the spirit
[1:13:16] before I get there amen because I know
[1:13:19] if I am I'll get a lot more cuz remember
[1:13:22] he's revealing through the spirit the
[1:13:24] natural man can't figure out what the
[1:13:25] preacher is
[1:13:27] saying he he's just going to get
[1:13:29] critical at the preaching the natural
[1:13:32] man but the spiritual man is going to
[1:13:33] catch it but we all with open face in a
[1:13:38] glass beholding as in a glass the glory
[1:13:42] of the Lord we're changed into what the
[1:13:45] same image uh from glory to glory even
[1:13:49] by the spirit of God so we see that this
[1:13:51] scripture is talking about a constantly
[1:13:54] being renovated or regenerated or or
[1:13:58] remodeled to fit God's Tabernacle to
[1:14:01] live in amen it happens it's a continual
[1:14:06] change it's you know we don't come to
[1:14:08] church and you know well we're going to
[1:14:09] put on we're going to put on Jesus today
[1:14:11] we're going to church we're going to put
[1:14:12] on our our Sunday clothes and then then
[1:14:15] we're going to go home and we're just
[1:14:16] kind of got to do whatever we want to
[1:14:18] do that is not the
[1:14:21] Tabernacle that God is preparing for
[1:14:24] heaven amen
[1:14:26] we do need to come serious with God
[1:14:29] because God is a serious
[1:14:31] person he's not all
[1:14:35] jokey
[1:14:36] amen I I I I I understand that God has
[1:14:40] asence in human I understand that but if
[1:14:43] you read the scriptures you see way too
[1:14:45] much seriousness than you ever do about
[1:14:48] God being
[1:14:49] joky you understand what I mean it's a
[1:14:51] fearful thing to fall in the hands of a
[1:14:53] living God it's not what God you know
[1:14:55] let's just talk sit down and play play
[1:14:57] you know play a game of cards it's just
[1:14:59] not like
[1:15:01] that all right Psalm 328 says I will
[1:15:04] instruct thee and I will teach thee in
[1:15:06] the way which Thou shalt go I will guide
[1:15:10] thee with mine eye yes we have a promise
[1:15:13] that God is going to take us
[1:15:16] through God is looking to fitly frame
[1:15:20] his character together in our lives so
[1:15:23] we need to pay attention to the details
[1:15:25] of God's word we've heard this story I
[1:15:29] think I first heard this story uh
[1:15:32] brother Johnson I think sharing this
[1:15:34] story oh those were the good old days
[1:15:38] and I never had to preach I never had to
[1:15:40] think about it I could sit where you're
[1:15:43] sitting and i' just brother johnon would
[1:15:45] be preaching and I'd eat the word and
[1:15:48] I'd go home and then I'd have my life
[1:15:50] you know and that was it it's much
[1:15:53] different when you got to preach but
[1:15:54] anyway anyways but brother Johnson he
[1:15:56] would he tell the story he said um there
[1:15:59] were these U men and they were applying
[1:16:02] for a job and I may get this a little
[1:16:04] mixed up but um this was like in a a
[1:16:08] city like a New York City and there were
[1:16:10] skyscrapers there and so they were they
[1:16:13] they they answered an ad in the paper
[1:16:16] and they were looking for a
[1:16:18] Salesman and so they they go in there
[1:16:20] and they they go in up the elevator they
[1:16:22] go to this room and and the the they
[1:16:25] walk into the room for the the interview
[1:16:28] and um they're sitting down taking the
[1:16:31] interview and after just a few questions
[1:16:33] he says okay this is what I want you to
[1:16:34] do I want you to take this a pile of
[1:16:37] bricks right
[1:16:39] here and I just I want you to take him
[1:16:41] and I want you to move them over here to
[1:16:43] the side of the
[1:16:44] room
[1:16:46] okay and uh he said this is kind of
[1:16:49] crazy for a Salesman job but I need I
[1:16:52] yeah I got to do it so he goes and he
[1:16:54] takes the break
[1:16:55] and he moves him over there and as he's
[1:16:57] moving him he
[1:17:02] say you know what I'm talking about like
[1:17:04] I can't have any reasoning why I should
[1:17:06] have to do this it just doesn't make
[1:17:09] sense and more and more that he's doing
[1:17:11] it he's thinking I I kind of don't want
[1:17:14] to work for this guy he finally gets all
[1:17:17] the bricks moved over here
[1:17:22] and he comes back and he reports okay I
[1:17:24] took care of that
[1:17:26] now what do you
[1:17:28] think okay well what I'd like you to do
[1:17:30] now is I'd like you to take these same
[1:17:31] bricks and i' like you to move them
[1:17:34] back right here to where they
[1:17:37] were and the guy
[1:17:39] said you know this is crazy I'm out of
[1:17:41] here and he
[1:17:43] leaves well the next guy comes in for
[1:17:46] the
[1:17:47] interview and when the bricks got over
[1:17:49] here the the first time and he asked to
[1:17:52] move him back over there he said gladly
[1:17:53] will I do that
[1:17:56] gladly and he moves the bricks back over
[1:17:59] here God is just looking for somebody
[1:18:03] that will do what he asked to do amen
[1:18:05] not to understand it not to agree with
[1:18:08] it am not to you know I'm on the same
[1:18:11] page the same page is obedience you want
[1:18:13] to know how you know you're being Guided
[1:18:15] by the Holy Ghost it's so simple if
[1:18:18] you're obedient to the word then you
[1:18:21] know you're being Guided by the Holy
[1:18:23] Ghost amen you don't need no dream you
[1:18:27] don't need no prophecy you don't need
[1:18:29] anybody to tell you
[1:18:32] right because when the word is spoken to
[1:18:35] you you say amen and you do it whether
[1:18:38] you understand it or not he never said
[1:18:41] Can thou understand he said Can thou
[1:18:44] believe
[1:18:45] right we just got to believe the word
[1:18:50] amen take the word in our heart turn
[1:18:53] with me to Matthew 19
[1:18:59] 27 you know we we don't even
[1:19:02] know what's in our heart a lot of
[1:19:06] times and and we can't even figure
[1:19:08] there's only one thing that can really
[1:19:10] tell us what's in our heart and that's
[1:19:12] the word of God it is a discerner of the
[1:19:14] thoughts and intents of our heart right
[1:19:17] that's how much we got to depend upon
[1:19:19] the word we can't depend upon us because
[1:19:21] look we don't even have to go to church
[1:19:23] and I can guarantee every man man is
[1:19:25] right in his own eyes
[1:19:27] amen this that's the the nature that
[1:19:30] we're born with when you when you can
[1:19:32] honestly say you know I don't know I
[1:19:34] could be wrong you got the right Spirit
[1:19:37] now God can show you Matthew 1927 then
[1:19:41] answered Peter and said unto him behold
[1:19:44] we have forsaken everything and followed
[1:19:47] thee what is there left for us to
[1:19:51] do in other words I've forsaken the
[1:19:53] denominations I've accepted the message
[1:19:56] of the hour I I'm I'm I'm following uh
[1:20:00] I'm following you to church I I'm I'm I
[1:20:03] I said okay so what more do you want me
[1:20:06] to
[1:20:07] do that that mindset that there is
[1:20:11] nothing more for me to
[1:20:13] do and Jesus said unto them verily I say
[1:20:17] unto you that ye which have followed me
[1:20:21] in the
[1:20:23] Regeneration when the son a man shall
[1:20:25] sit in the Throne of his glory ye shall
[1:20:27] sit with sit upon the 12 tribes judging
[1:20:30] the 12 uh tribes of Israel sitting on
[1:20:32] the 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[1:20:34] Israel and everyone that have forsaken
[1:20:36] houses or Brethren or sisters father or
[1:20:39] mother or wife or children or lands for
[1:20:42] my name's sake shall receive a h
[1:20:43] hundredfold and shall inherit
[1:20:45] everlasting life amen and many that are
[1:20:50] first shall be last and the last shall
[1:20:53] be first
[1:20:55] the subject here is forsaking everything
[1:20:58] to follow God into what a complete
[1:21:01] nature
[1:21:03] change so that's why we have to be
[1:21:06] interested in our
[1:21:07] nature because if we don't follow him
[1:21:10] into the complete nature change that
[1:21:13] means we haven't forsaken everything
[1:21:15] amen it's that simple that means there's
[1:21:18] something in our life that's holding us
[1:21:20] from getting our nature changed there
[1:21:23] are many that will put their own will
[1:21:27] first and they'll receive the nature
[1:21:30] change the the the last they'll be the
[1:21:33] last to receive it because they're the
[1:21:35] the last to to give God their life and
[1:21:39] there'll be those that lay down their
[1:21:40] life
[1:21:42] first they'll give up their will they'll
[1:21:46] put their will last that they might
[1:21:49] receive first a complete nature change
[1:21:56] God has to be first in our
[1:21:58] life if we don't the nature change is
[1:22:01] never going to come because you know the
[1:22:02] part of the ingredient to overcoming all
[1:22:04] things is you you have to hate your life
[1:22:06] un
[1:22:07] death you you just you just have to
[1:22:10] without that ingredient the nature
[1:22:12] change doesn't come ye which have
[1:22:14] followed me in the Regeneration now that
[1:22:16] word regeneration if you look at up in
[1:22:19] the Greek it means rebirth or spiritual
[1:22:22] renovation Now Catch this
[1:22:26] specifically
[1:22:28] messic
[1:22:30] restoration
[1:22:32] wow but we know God don't have to be
[1:22:38] restored but he said all that was lost I
[1:22:41] will
[1:22:43] restore we are a part of
[1:22:45] him so we are part of that
[1:22:49] restoration we have to follow him
[1:22:52] because he's guiding us to get rest
[1:22:54] restored he don't need to be restored
[1:22:56] amen we do amen but if we don't follow
[1:22:59] him in the Regeneration process if we
[1:23:02] just you know I'm born again I'm born
[1:23:04] again I mean how many people have we
[1:23:05] heard how many presidents have we heard
[1:23:07] I'm born again whether their life is
[1:23:09] just just in shambles as it was before
[1:23:12] right amen so we're we're we're not
[1:23:15] trying to prove who's who who's born
[1:23:17] again and who's not we're just trying to
[1:23:19] say a a person that's born again
[1:23:21] everything is of God that's why we need
[1:23:24] to keep pressing towards what we don't
[1:23:26] have amen maybe we're missing some
[1:23:30] things amen turn with me if you would to
[1:23:32] 2 Corinthians chapter 15 well I'll just
[1:23:35] quote it you know this wherefore
[1:23:36] henceforth know we know man after the
[1:23:38] flesh though you have known Christ after
[1:23:40] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[1:23:43] no more in other words it is impossible
[1:23:47] to know
[1:23:49] God even by the Corporal
[1:23:53] body of of of of of Jesus Christ
[1:23:55] remember Philip and Peter both said show
[1:23:59] us the father and it'll suffice us and
[1:24:02] Jesus says have I been so long with you
[1:24:04] hey when you've seen me you've seen the
[1:24:06] father right but see you can't know that
[1:24:09] until you see the spirit inside of
[1:24:12] Jesus therefore If any man you want to
[1:24:16] know
[1:24:17] somebody know their Spirit
[1:24:20] right you want to know somebody know
[1:24:23] their spirit amen you can know somebody
[1:24:25] after the Flesh and never know them but
[1:24:28] you know the spirit right that Spirit
[1:24:32] tells who they are you know we've heard
[1:24:34] brother BR could just you know stay in
[1:24:36] the presence of somebody just a little
[1:24:38] bit and just know what Spirit
[1:24:42] right because the spirit tells it all
[1:24:46] right and so we can't we if we're going
[1:24:49] to know God we have to get in the spirit
[1:24:51] God is the spirit they that worship me
[1:24:52] must worship me in the spirit to we need
[1:24:54] to get in the spirit we need to make
[1:24:57] this word real inside our hearts
[1:24:59] therefore If any man be in Christ he's a
[1:25:00] new creature old things are passed away
[1:25:03] behold all things are become new and all
[1:25:05] things are of God who have reconciled us
[1:25:08] to himself by Jesus Christ and has given
[1:25:10] us that same Ministry Amen to carry on
[1:25:14] all right second Corinthians chapter 6 I
[1:25:17] just I just love this here this we we
[1:25:20] play a part in building this Tabernacle
[1:25:24] right
[1:25:25] 2 Corinthians 61 says we then as workers
[1:25:28] together with him beseech you that you
[1:25:31] receive not the grace of God in vain
[1:25:33] what does that mean a lot of people when
[1:25:35] they get saved they say I'm saved that's
[1:25:39] it and they don't they don't have a
[1:25:42] heart of pushing in it's okay if they
[1:25:43] let other things in their life it's okay
[1:25:45] if they miss church it's okay if it
[1:25:49] because they they have that umbrella of
[1:25:51] I'm saved right well how how are we
[1:25:55] going to approach God when he says did
[1:25:59] you give your all and we say I gave what
[1:26:03] you
[1:26:05] said I repented I got baptized I went to
[1:26:08] church when I could I I gave when I
[1:26:12] could are you think we're going to like
[1:26:14] phony baloney P God we're not we're not
[1:26:18] going to do it we're not going to be to
[1:26:19] pull a fast one on him amen right so
[1:26:25] there's more to Salvation than the day
[1:26:27] we gave our heart to Christ and it's
[1:26:30] revealed here in verse two for he saith
[1:26:32] I have heard thee in accepted in in a
[1:26:34] Time accepted okay that was at the
[1:26:37] beginning right yes and in a day of
[1:26:40] salvation when I helped you when I
[1:26:43] helped
[1:26:44] you behold now is the accepted time is
[1:26:48] well behold now is the day of salvation
[1:26:51] now is the time to keep building the
[1:26:53] Tabernacle EO amen look only the bride
[1:26:58] is going in the
[1:27:00] Rapture right that the bride is adorned
[1:27:04] for the her husband it is everyone is

[1:27:09] outside that City amen come

[1:27:16] bride

[1:27:25] I want to make it by the grace of God
[1:27:28] but I you understand we the bride has a
[1:27:32] different a
[1:27:35] set they have a a different thought
[1:27:38] process about the word than than the
[1:27:41] typical
[1:27:42] churchgoer same
[1:27:45] word but one loves the whole thing the
[1:27:47] other says well hey as long as I'm saved

[1:27:52] matters okay

[1:29:26] given unto us exceeding great and
[1:29:30] precious promises amen that by these ye
[1:29:33] might be partakers of the Divine of the
[1:29:36] divine nature catch this having escaped

[1:29:56] to become the complete Tabernacle of god
[1:30:00] let's say you
[1:30:06] had let's say you had uh 500 $500,000
[1:30:11] and you were going to buy a house and
[1:30:13] you saw the pictures there in another
[1:30:15] state you couldn't get there but you

[1:30:42] money or or let's say you just go out
[1:30:45] there and you got the money you're going
[1:30:46] to pay but when you walk inside it's not
[1:30:48] even
[1:30:49] finished the Plumbing's not there the

[1:30:56] on but the outside looks like so
[1:30:59] beautiful you're going to say wait a
[1:31:01] minute no way I'm not buying
[1:31:03] it God has the final say so who he's
[1:31:06] going to dwell in amen we've got to be
[1:31:11] so serious about getting our nature
[1:31:14] changed and begin to add these virtues
[1:31:17] to our life so that when God looks at us
[1:31:20] we're just like him we're changed from
[1:31:22] Glory onto Glory see you know we get in
[1:31:24] this habit we come to church and this is
[1:31:26] how we feel like you know when we come
[1:31:28] to church if I'm blessed I got something
[1:31:30] out of
[1:31:32] it if I feel his Spirit if I feel good
[1:31:35] when I leave I got something out of
[1:31:39] it I I I'm talking
[1:31:42] about building a house for
[1:31:45] God if you've ever built anything it
[1:31:48] ain't all easy
[1:31:50] peasy you sweat you you you get
[1:31:56] Cuts it's not
[1:31:58] easy but you work amen you you go
[1:32:01] through what you got to go through
[1:32:03] because you got a vision at the end I'm
[1:32:05] going to be prepared I'm going to be one
[1:32:07] of those residents inside God's Great
[1:32:10] residence
[1:32:11] amen so add these
[1:32:15] virtues verse seven and to Godliness
[1:32:17] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[1:32:19] kindness charity that is the
[1:32:22] Capstone the Capstone we don't have a
[1:32:24] picture of the pyramid in here we got to
[1:32:27] keep adding until we get
[1:32:30] charity and for if these things be in
[1:32:32] you and abound they make you that you
[1:32:34] shall neither be Barren nor
[1:32:37] unfruitful right in demonstrating the
[1:32:40] knowledge of Jesus Christ in your body
[1:32:42] amen they got to be in you and they got
[1:32:44] to be
[1:32:47] abounding you know what a boundy means
[1:32:49] right that means if you take a a pop
[1:32:54] and you go like
[1:32:56] this and then you open
[1:32:58] it it's abounding it's coming out
[1:33:03] amen is joy unspeakable full of Glory
[1:33:06] yes but he that lacks these
[1:33:13] virtues you know God is labeling him as
[1:33:16] being
[1:33:19] blind and cannot see a far
[1:33:22] off in fact he's
[1:33:25] forgotten what Calvary did in his own
[1:33:29] life right and I'll tell you Believers
[1:33:32] can get so caught up in their present
[1:33:35] life that they they forgot the original
[1:33:39] fact that happen to them because that
[1:33:42] needs to continually be
[1:33:43] happening come
[1:33:45] on when it's not happening you're you're
[1:33:48] dealing with the spirit of I'm in need

[1:37:44] that had builded the house have more
[1:37:46] honor than the house right for every
[1:37:48] house is buil by some man but he that
[1:37:50] built all things is God right that we're
[1:37:53] talking about being built and Moses
[1:37:56] verily was faithful in all his house as
[1:37:58] a servant for a testimony of those
[1:38:00] things which uh were to be spoken after
[1:38:04] but Christ as a son over his house his
[1:38:07] own house whose house are we right

[1:38:28] and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto
[1:38:31] the End
[1:38:33] Amen verse 14 for we are partakers of
[1:38:37] Christ it just kind of amens this if we

[1:38:41] steadfast to the end now when we came to
[1:38:43] Jesus Christ and we got saved you know
[1:38:46] you just couldn't shut
[1:38:48] up you had to tell
[1:38:50] somebody you you you couldn't wait to go
[1:38:53] back to to church to be around those
[1:38:55] that it had happened to amen because
