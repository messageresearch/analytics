in your presence and to be with those of like precious faith god we know that so much really rests upon us to just let go and let you have your way lord we don't want to stand in the way of the working of the holy spirit in our hearts and lives we pray lord that you'd help us to to let go of all unbelief all the the wrong thoughts and i pray that you would just put a hedge around our mind that we could just stay in the very vein of the holy spirit today that we could leave here uh stronger uh in the holy spirit stronger in your word we pray that you would give us revelation lord of the things that you would speak to our heart give us a receiving heart lord and father we pray for those lord that are are not able they weren't able to make it today lord for one reason or another we just pray that lord you would be with them in the places that they are at today live streaming lord we just ask you to meet that little room and that the power of the holy spirit lord calls them to be in the spirit lord as they're hearing the word today lord may it be so real to him father lord we as we stand here we're a needy people lord there's needs in our heart things we've been praying for lord for our families for our lives and we just ask that through the through the word the lord you'd come and meet every need granted lord we commit this service to you that's your blessings now in the reading of the word for we praise you in jesus precious name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to saint john chapter 14 for just one verse of reading before we have you be seated i want to say it it's a beautiful day outside the sun in the spring we've been looking forward to spraying all winter and we've had some hot days and today it's just just good day good day and i heard brother mark make mention of brother larry well we just praise the lord for brother larry amen so good to see him amen good to see each and every one of you amen amen just one verse here uh saint john chapter 14 verse number 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you god bless you maybe seated may the lord add the blessings to this just one scripture we want to entitle this message forgetting and stirring we may read a lot of things that god has spoken and not really quite understand what we're reading it we ever do that read the bible read something what does that mean or what is god saying to us but it is the purpose of the holy ghost to lead each and every one of us and guide each and every one of us into all truth he shall teach us all things and bring all things to our remembrance whatsoever he has said now just because we have heard the truth and we've said amen and we said i believe it doesn't mean that we're really established in the word this is an important important thing there are many who know the truth but they don't obey it and if you don't obey it you're not established and if you're not established you won't obey it if you're established you'll not only be faithful to come to church but you'll be faithful to the word of god in your homes in your lives on your jobs oftentimes the holy ghost has to bring things to our remembrance and the reason why is because he's trying to establish us not just hear it not just amen not just that we agree but to establish this in what he's trying to say now we know the bible says believe in the lord you shall be established but the problem is our definition of belief in god's is different the devils believe but they're not established a lot of people say they believe but they're not established and the proof of being established is a faithfulness to the word of god and i believe he's calling us all higher and higher because each time we come to church each time we listen to a tape each time we're we're we're getting down on our knees god is speaking things to us there's a there's a relationship there and god is wanting to establish this in them and to become faithful with them good to see brother stay in here amen sometimes we have a a tendency to just forget things god help us and there are things that that god wants us to forget and there's things that god wants us to remember and at the same time that the devil is trying to accomplish the direct opposite that serpent he's he he he wants to keep reminding us of things that god wants us to forget and he wants to distract us from the things that god wants us to remember so there's a a battle that's continuously transpiring in our minds in certain things that the devil wants to keep reminding us we just need to forget right and and the certain things that the devil wants us to forget god wants to stir our minds up and to bring it to our remember so we don't forget so we're humans and we need to be reminded amen i'm grateful for the way that god has provided us to know where we're really at with god the prophet taught us that we come here to the house of the lord to find out where we're really at because see if we believe in the word jesus christ is the word the realness of the word it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart how many times we've been to church we heard something said and we have this thought come into our head who told him how did he know how did he catch a we got to give confidence to the word if we don't focus on the word and if we put we allow man to inject there then every time we come to church we're going to be questioning now we all have personal lives and walks where we believe god is leading us i'll just say perfectly but the only true way for us to know is to come to church and if we really want to know god will confirm he'll he'll lead us this is the vehicle that god has chosen for the local body the prophet never said your leadership will be confirmed by listening to the tapes don't stay home and listen to the tapes or our favorite songs or our ministers our friends or our dreams now it's not that god won't use those things because he can and he will but god sent his mouthpiece to confirm the channel in which god would choose to tell us where we're standing with him and if we really get a revelation of this that we can come to find out where we're standing with god we would have a greater hunger to get to church it would no longer be i'm coming to church just to get what i want you know how it feels when your children come to you and the majority time they come to you is always about what they want i know the difference i have some children that would never ask me for a thing i don't care how old they get and i've got some as soon as you're talking to them you know it's about to come and there's a difference in the feeling and when we come to church and all we want to do is please the lord that touches the heart of god i just want to find out if i'm pleasing you if i'm in the right channel here lord i remember many times sitting in church and feeling like am i the only one that's getting this message just things were quiet not saying amen trying to send a message right now and i would be sitting in the back and i would just be weeping tears would be coming and i would just be wondering what is going on it wasn't that god was there just for me i was there just for god it wasn't like i was just special to god it was i was that god was special to me it was my attitude it was where i was at it is what would it was my attitude it wasn't that the original manner didn't get uh common i just didn't let it get common to me see it's your attitude that really makes a difference no wonder david could say one thing i've desired of the lord and that why i seek after all the days of my life because there's something more there to it a lot of people are going to church and somebody coming to our are are building the other day and they were just telling me to go into a certain church and it's a church with a lot of lights and a lot of entertainment and sure i introduced them to the to our church but i said if if the word is not what's important to you in your relationship above entertainment the church is not really a good fit for you but the people are looking for for so much for themselves and are not interested in their souls prospering how many like that message last service psalms 27 verse 3 let's read that though a host should a camp against me ever feel that way you're all alone my heart shall not fear though war should rise up against me in this will i be confident one thing i've had desired of the lord that why seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret place of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i was saying yeah i will sing praises unto the lord we are in the will of the lord praising him in this place so we need to be faithful to not only being at church but when we're here to be listening to the word personally imagine for a moment of course we like as many people as we could be in church it kind of helps the atmosphere but for a moment imagine you are the only person sitting in the church and you're hearing the word do you have enough faith to believe god is speaking to you because that's what god's looking at that's how personal it needs to be and if we all we can all have that we can all have that did you know we could all be praying at the same time and yet being one mind and one accord with the holy ghost it's us focusing in the lord amen i believe that we miss him more times than we realize these stirring up and reminders are really the working of the holy ghost there's a lot of important things in god's word that we we need to be reminded of jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god turn with me if you would to juke juke it's really not in the bible it's jude jude and even if i didn't say anything you would just probably think i was listening as a foreign minister or something like that you would know what it meant jude 1 verse 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints i just imagine i was a visiting minister today and i came to church here and i was ministering on this verse of scriptures and i said it is needful for me to write about you just about the common salvation well you would think that you're much beyond this right that you've already got common salvation that you're interested in hearing some new things that's why you come to church that you have some other interest but it wasn't just jude sharing his thoughts now for the sunday's message it was really the holy ghost in jude that saw a need it was an important message it wasn't a mystery or new revelation or some exciting message but yet it was the holy ghost bringing to the remembrance of something that was very important jude saw a need to contend for the original faith and why that was is because satan was concocting new faiths new beliefs and he could see that there was a spirit that was starting a new faith to arise and this simply wasn't we're going to prove it in the scripture to come where believers could do their own will now they could do what they want to do and still claim their salvation and it grieved you to the point that he found it needful that he would write and exhort and i'll tell you this this this is to us this word is for me to bring the original faith back to our remembrance verse 4 for there are certain men crept in unawares we could just say they were spirits but the crept are not aware who uh but but men gravitate to spirits who were before ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of god into lascivious and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ now we think whoa i've never seen nothing like that all my life brother john right wrong wrong wrong wrong turning grace of our lord god into lascivious now that word lascivious means wantonness turning grace into wantonness when you turn grace into wanton you're denying he is the only lord of your life because if he isn't lord of everything that he's not lord at all so it's not denying that there wasn't jesus christ that he was the lord of glory but is he your lord and that grace of god needs to stay the grace of god not turning into i want see that the attitude that the devil wants to to bring about the the bride of christ is i'm saved i've been set free i can do what i want to do now because i'm saved and that's not the right attitude see that's not the original faith the original faith causes the saved to sell out lock stock and barrel that's what it'll do to make jesus the lord of all your life that's what the original faith will do remember that most subtle beast brought a different faith to eve the original was stay with the word but satan came along crept in unawares and offered you can still do what you want to do and be accepted believers love talking about god's saving grace and we should can you say amen but what should follow the grace of god from common salvation or what should the grace of god turn us into a scripture here in first corinthians 6 19 it should turn us into servants i believe first corinthians 6 19 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and look you are not your own anymore for your bought with the price therefore glorify god in your body and your spirit which are god's how many has ever bought a new car or used car how many has ever taken your old car into the dealer at the same time okay so you that have done that when you drive your car away whether it's new or used that's your car now you don't call the dealer up a week later and say that's my car i want it back and a lot of times that's what the devil wants believers to think that you're saved now the most important thing is all done now you just go on and do what you want to do in life but that's only going to bring about a great disappointment grace should turn every believer into a servant of god an ambassador for his kingdom second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of god now i'll tell you when i look at my life i can honestly say that all things are not of god if i'm being honest of course i could be here be deceptive and tell you all things in my life are of god and i'd be lying to my teeth and that and if i ever said that i expect you to stand up and walk out of here but i'm a sinner saved by grace growing in the grace the knowledge of our lord jesus christ all things are of god who's reconciled us to what himself himself you go buy a car it's for you the dealer can't come and if you paid for your car the dealer can't come and get the car back from you it's paid for you've got the deed well god paid for our salvation he's got the deed we can't go back in there and steal it and say well i'm going to kind of do what i want to do we belong to god so he's reconciled to himself and he's also given us a responsibility a ministry let's get back to jude here verse four and there are uh for there are certain crep certain men crept in unawares who before ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having saved the people of the land of egypt afterwards he destroyed them that believe not now their own testimony would be that they believe that god delivered them they rejoiced they they saw the water come out of the rock the manifold they they looked to the the uh the pole and they were healed they were had many testimonies like my shoes never wore out they believed but god said they didn't believe because the moment we stop believing in all the word then we don't believe amen that's why we need to continue to believe all the word you cannot start doing what you want to do after you've been saved and i'm exhorting you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints now the original faith was we're more than able to take the lamb the original faith for us is to go on and receive the power of god in our life to go on to perfection amen to lay everything else aside until we get perfect love amen lay everything aside and get perfect love now brother brandon wasn't just giving us an option here nor was this just brother branham's opinion it was the word of god being spoken to us and sometimes we can have an attitude of what i call selective hearing only wanting to hear about selective things so we can develop an automatic turn off valve inside of our conscious when we don't quite hear what we want to hear because we don't want to follow through with what god says hebrews 13 17. we must remember this hebrews 13 17 obey them that have the rule over you nobody likes to be rude right how many times have we said you ain't gonna tell me what to do huh how many times have we given this silent treatment not just to our husbands but to our wives or to our friends to our neighbors to our brother and sister because of something obey them that have the rule for you and submit yourselves for they watch over your souls as they must give an account that they may do it with joy not with grief for it is unprofitable for you i read this quote not because i'm your pastor but i want you to remember our prophet in the message respects brother branson says you say well maybe they were the unconverted type well maybe they were they were a mixed multitude went with them that's true so speaking of that the egyptians when they or the children of israel when they came out of egypt he says but i want to bring another thing into your remembrance if god sent the messenger and vindicated by the signs that he was the messenger sent from god then it was up to them to obey the messenger exactly they must obey the messenger and have respect to that messenger he said look at joshua and caleb they stayed right by his side yes sir whatever moses was in they ran it to whether moses was right or wrong they stayed right with him didn't matter see because they know that was god's messenger just because some we know somebody's god's messenger doesn't make them perfect doesn't make them sinless it doesn't no no we're any time we put somebody above being a human say by grace all you're doing is setting up to not follow or obey the word when it's spoken through that person that's all you're doing see satan wants you to kind of lift somebody up and then god's gonna let you know that that man's gonna fall so it isn't important that we know everything's perfect that that happened in the ministry of fourth malachi 4 5 and 6. but you've got to have a revelation of the messenger of this hour and you as joshua like joshua and caleb you got to stay with that word amen stay right with that word right or wrong you stay with it amen we understand that there was a mixed multitude that came out of egypt and the majority of god's people in the church were only interested now catch this in salvation they wanted freedom from slavery freedom from pharaoh freedom from their taskmasters and being in bondage they were not interested in their god-given responsibility to move forward can you say amen god god's promise wasn't just to come out of egypt god's promise was to take a land that's flowing with milk and honey they were not as interested in a relationship with god they just wanted to to to make sure that they were saved if this is what they had to do to get saved they repent and get baptized they were saved and that's the main thing now that's i'm going to say the majority that came out of egypt was like that i want to say that if we as believers remain only interested in salvation we're going to come short of a rapture you go on claiming all you want to claim that you're the elect but if you don't move forward how can that be the elect why did god end up destroying the people of egypt after he saved them their main concern was being saved from their current situation how many times we want to be saved from our current situation and we get more desperate and we we try harder and then after uh we we get relief it seems like we let our foot off the gas are you with me they weren't concerned about building a relationship where they could trust god for the entire promise now the entire promise for us is that we will be in his image and until we let go god can't have his way we can't come in this no matter just sitting around waiting for god to do it the answer the answer is us believing that god will do it and we got a part to play between now and then they neglected to remember their responsibility to keep moving forward they didn't like coming to church and being stirred up over and over they didn't like hearing about the original promise that there's still a land that floweth with milk and honey that they're still a love to where you can love your enemies truly love them that there is a a peace that passeth all understanding when you're in the middle of test and child there is a joy when you lay down your life for others they they weren't interested in hearing that all the time they were just interested in what they were interested in second peter chapter one second peter chapter one verse one there's a reason that god is reminding us of his word he wants us to stay right with the word don't deviate from it simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained light precious faith so this is to you and i in this room and those that are live streaming and those that are into they're christians but i'm just saying don't count yourself out of this then you will miss the whole thing while we're talking with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you now how does it happen to the knowledge of god grace and peace be multiplied how many wants more grace how many wants more peace just multiply it well it's through the knowledge of god so when we're coming to church we're we're hearing the truth this is to help multiply grace and peace in our life and of jesus christ our lord according to his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth on to life and godliness and here it goes again through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given un to us exceeding great precious promises that by these we that he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now we came out of egypt with precious promises we came out of the world with precious promises and he has called us unto virtue and glory so even though we're saved to light precious faith we've been called to something higher are you with me there's something more god never saved us in order just to get us to escape from hell and continue to just do our own will in life are you with me salvation is just the first step now we need to go on to perfection and god has called us to this perfect love but if we come short of it like i said we're going to miss the rapture i presently i kind of i'm a jealous type of a guy i am and the very thought that i'm sleeping for a thousand years while the bride is up with him having a honeymoon i just get so jealous of that thought are you with me i don't want to be caught down i don't want to be a foolish virgin i want to be so filled with god these uh virtues all that god has for me i want every bit of it so here's the the steps that we must take as what we're being called to what we're elected to and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brother kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and that's a lot of adding you remember how it was in school and two plus two was four and when you got that right you felt good then when you get a little bit they start giving you six numbers to add together so these six numbers plus and it became harder well when we look in god's word there's a lot of things that need to be added to our life but it's up to us to get interested in them to know that's what we've been called to for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shouldn't either be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus now notice here it is again speaking of that knowledge so this knowledge is not head knowledge because head knowledge doesn't give me patience it doesn't give me uh a joy or godliness or virtue not that knowledge up here it's here it's when i want to die out so much let go of my life so much that i'm interested in pursuing and adding something to my life that's not there we got a part to play but he that lack these things is blind cannot see it far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins hmm that's a terrible state to be in don't you think the very fact that a believer remains concerned uh that a believer's main concern is just salvation without growing in these things will not only make them barren and unfruitful but the bible says here that he's blind he cannot see afar off and he's forgotten that he was even purged from his sins he's forgotten about calvary i want you to think about this when you forget about calvary you forget about who owned you who bought you that you're a servant that's why you just can't just stay focused i'm saved and say that's the main thing no the main thing is you're adding you're adding you're adding you're growing that it's on your heart it's on your mind there's an increase in your life don't let the the devil hoodwink us into thinking that everything's okay just because we're saved we as the bride have been called to a higher calling it's to spend that thousand years with him it's to ruin reign with him it's to be sitting next to him it's it's it's to a place where he'll say this is my beloved wife this is my wife remember there was the other church that was claiming to be his wife they were dancing to the wrong music they were interested in things that were appealing to their flesh and not the prosperity of their souls verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for soul and entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior oh here we go wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye once though ye know them and be established in the present truth so we might think this is like you know why are we hearing this why are we hearing this we we already know that we need to go on to the statue of a perfect man but we need it so much in the forefront of our memory that we're actually working about we're concerned about we spend time praying about it we're pressing in we want what was lacking in our life i don't even i don't this is the truth i don't want to be a hundred percent on all of them except one thing and say god look look at these hundred look i'm so 100 over here because i need to be complete it'd be it'd be better if you were 80 on all of them you catch what i'm saying and you're pressing towards it it's it's a spirit and it's an attitude you don't see it in this world because the world is lukewarm the the church members in the church they're they're fine where they're at they have no vision they they they they're blind they cannot see afar off they can't see that god has called them to be just like him [Music] god help us amen i will put you always in remembrance of these things he was i'll tell you he was a good pastor under the direct leadership of the holy ghost verse 13 yay i think it meet as long as i'm alive as long as my soul is in this body to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that any time i could die put off this my tabernacle of course we don't die the soul don't die but these bodies even as our lord jesus christ have showed me moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance this must have been important this this this mindset of adding and adding and adding and growing and growing until you come to the statue of a perfect man and not just be swallowed up in unsaved or that i'm bride but to be adding don't be satisfied with just being saved god is stirring our minds to keep adding what are we adding god's nature to our lives now that was the original calling in the original election for us to be the bride that have made herself ready not just say bride eventually she has to get to the place where she has made herself ready so to claim to be bride is good for old kid for the start but after a while there needs to be fruit that we're ready i was like what brother marty said that you know jesus said be ready be ready but to remain ready to remain ready that means you got to war off the the the distractions and the temptations and everything that the devil is throwing at us to get us off track salvation doesn't make you ready for a rapture but what will god's divine nature that's why we need to keep adding we've got to stay in the word stay in the message of the hour stay in church keep reading keep listening keep yourself stirred up keep yourself in the love of god keep in the spirit walk in the spirit live in the spirit we've got to keep the word of god in our hearts and our minds david said in psalms 119 verse 11 thy word have i hid in my heart that i may not sin against thee and you can see what happened to david you could see what happened to abraham you can see what happened to you and why and how does it happen how did it happen to me is when i didn't hide god's word in my heart it's how important to keep that word there in your mind in your thoughts just keep it up here we know we understand we can always say it is there but we need to keep it up here right as a man thinketh in his heart so busy amen not just the knowledge of the truth but the the the activeness of the brain functioning we don't want to be satisfied with just hearing it but we want to move forward into the manifestation of it i believe there's a lot of baptized believers that have deceived himself by just hearing the word by just commenting and hearing just hearing will deceive you and you no nobody likes a deceiver nobody wants to be talking to somebody that's trying to trick him do you ever have somebody try to trick you into something buy something i mean we just want to cut them off but the devil pulled fast one by the believer to the one that is okay with hearing the word but not doing it the bible says he deceives himself not the devil deceives you but he deceives himself in other words the devil's got us to think that we're going to be okay as long as we know first corinthians 15 verse 1. it wasn't too long ago i was coming out of church and i don't know what it was but brother johnson said something so i just quoted this this verse to him moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also you've received and wherein you stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what i preached unto you unless you believed in vain moreover brethren there's more to the gospel then what meets the eye if we can say it like this these brethren they heard the gospel preached they had received it they were standing in it and this gospel is salvation but we've got to keep in memory all the word because that's what the children of israel who came out of egypt did not do they didn't keep in their memory everything that was preached so even though they could say we're standing out look at my shoes they could like here's the wealth revival type thing the holy spirit was amongst them but they did not continue to move forward and i'll say it like this where you know we're talking about churches we're talking about history we're talking about things that have happened in the bible but really what we're talking about is our relationship with god that's what we're really talking about here you can see why the holy ghost wants to stir our minds and bring all things to our remembrance if the devil sees an open door to get us lifted up in pride you know what he'll do he'll remind us of all of our victories as if we're kind of special you know the devil loves reminding us of how perfect we are how great we seem to act what we've achieved or what we've attained or how much god has used us or how much truth we have or or that we're in the message of the hour we know the mysteries but remember those things remembering those things all the time only opens a door for the devil to distract the believer you know what do i need to pay attention to what he's trying to show me when i've got this sold up in my bag i've got all this history of of of all these great things i'm just gonna focus on this hmm it can keep the believer from doing what he presently should be doing what he's called to do i mean let's face it god uses some people everybody wasn't a moses everybody wasn't a brother branham everybody wasn't a timothy everybody wasn't a jude you know we're not all supposed to be somebody else we're supposed to be who we are but what we need to be doing is growing in the calling where he's called us to now here's the apostle paul with i'll say like this a a perfect attitude in in philippians chapter 3 verse 12. and this is something we all can have it's not a gift it's a victory god is not going to give how many times you ever had a bad attitude just can't seem to snap out of it and you try to put a song on try to somebody give you some encouragement david had to encourage himself in the lord sometimes it's not a gift philippians chapter 3 verse 12 not as though i've already attained either already perfect but i follow after if that i might apprehend that which also i am apprehended of jesus christ brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do i'm forgetting those things which are behind we we just let him go it doesn't matter it really doesn't matter what i've done in my life it just doesn't the past is past god never said i was that i was he said i am that i am i'm a present help in a time of need god is the same yesterday today and forever so paul having this revelation he says forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark i'm not there yet you know when you're pressing that's telling me you're not there yet for the prize of the high calling of of god in christ jesus that nature of god living inside of him he could still see that there was things missing oh i just love that a humble servant of god wroting wrote 14 books of the bible could say he had revelations more than others but he he didn't talk about his greatness he forgot about him he says i'm going to glory i'm going to glory and how many times i was whipped and killed and stoned and shipwrecked and been used and abused by believers if i'm going to glory i'm going to glory in that but i'm going to forget all this because if there's anything good in us it's of god and who are we to break about something god did through us god could have used anybody but he chose to use you so give him the glory amen there let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus what minded it's a way that you think and if any of you don't think like this god shall reveal even this unto you i'm so glad god has power to speak to our hearts today there are certain things that god wants us to forget don't hold on to things that will entice you to be lifted up i want you to forget them husband just between you and god i know they're they're really neat to think about when you think about that special thing you did it's like that's so that's so neat i just want to tell everybody why not share jesus with somebody amen why not just get down on your knees get your hands dirty and help somebody we need to maintain a perfect attitude of humility and that attitude will keep you pressing for more of the nature of jesus christ you know when we're not pressing you know what we're we could be doing just going to try to say this graceful i've attained i wouldn't say it with our mouth but just our actions now if the devil can't get us lifted up in pride he'll try to bring us down with condemnation the devil also loves reminding us of all of our failures of all of our mistakes of all of our shortcomings our unfaithfulness we want to kick him out don't we so whether or not we're lifted up with pride or we've been beat down with condemnation either way the devil knows that when we're in that condition either one we won't press forward if you're so beat down you don't feel like trying you won't press if you're lifted up in pride and look at me look at me you won't press either way that's why we got to know what's happening in their mind your mind just can't sit there and think whatever it wants to think of and it's going to be okay there's healthy things and unhealthy things something's been on my heart for oh probably two months now about uh and they started studying a little bit about it but a message on how to think just the simplicity of how we should think because we don't know how to think feeling proud doesn't mean you have faith and feeling condemned doesn't mean you have humility and even if you if we try when we're lifted up with pride let's say we're just lifted up with pride and oh yeah we got a following with us and we're going to try you know to attain tomorrow god even if that does happen see satan knows that god resists the proud he won't give you grace and and even if if somehow you get down so beat and you're so negative about your situation and you try satan knows that god won't honor it because there is no faith it's just a murmuring and a complaining without faith it's impossible to please them so i'm just telling you either way you've got to get rid of negative attitudes in your life you cannot grow to the statue of a perfect man if you're carrying with you an attitude that that's selfish or that's that's negative or this that's proud you've got to have the spirit of christ with you a humble contrite spirit are not despised let's forget about anything in our past that will lift us up or condemn us and be stirred in our minds to press towards what god has for each and every one of us jesus said be ready that he's come in an hour we think not let's focus on getting ready how about that or brother john you don't know i feel like i'm ready by faith i feel like i'm ready well praise the lord i can't say that you're not but have the attitude that god wants to see more of himself in you amen how's that how's that it's not about whether we're we're officially ready or not it's about if we officially have the right attitudes can i just take a a few minutes about mind control we've heard a lot of bad things about mind control right how bad it is well god wants to control our minds that's not a bad thing he wants to control our minds and the way that we think amen he wants certain things forgotten and he wants certain things stirred up he just wants control of that situation one time jesus said remember lot's wife what was he doing stirring up the mind of something in the past and he wanted to control the way the person was thinking so remember lot's wife and i'll tell you when we read that scripture it made us to think about sodom it may not be something that we want to think about it may not be something we want to remember but it is something that god wants us to remember and there's a purpose in it he wants to control our minds he will bring all things the bible says not just some things but he'll bring all things to our remembrance whatsoever he has spoken remember the time that the the two disciples were on the road to emmaus and they had gone through a tremendous trial you ever go through a tremendous trial so you should better relate to this one and what does trials usually do for us that they take us down they really do when we look at job we think oh wow how did he do it right how did he do how did how did jonah in the middle of all that seaweed and vomit look towards jerusalem and pray so trials have a way of bringing us down and these disciples of god they were they were they were negative their attitude was down about the the current situation they were in and i'll tell you what happens a lot of times when we get negative and we we stay in that negative state that we don't recognize the very presence of god can be amongst us and here jesus came amongst them and they didn't even recognize it how many times you've been so negative and somebody said hey but what about this and they reminded you about something you think oh yeah why didn't i think about that because a negative mindset will bring you down and jesus he doesn't flirt with that thing he doesn't baby that thing he doesn't say oh no he said oh fools fools his own disciples he's calling fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things so he's bringing to the remembrance something they already knew i wonder how many times the lord's called me a fool come on if we're disciples go and put it past him it's okay that we hear things over and over and over it's okay we need it because the enemy is coming in and he's trying to get us off track and trying to to to get us distracted from the path that we need to be on so whatever you do lay aside everything you got going on in your life and get perfect love now the best way for god to control is to allow his mind inside of us let this mind that was in christ be in you the way he thinks the bible says that his thoughts are higher than our thoughts how can i attain to them you know we're so used to getting watching something on tv sometimes it's for entertainment and sometimes there are documentaries but i'm just going to say in the middle of everything his thoughts are so much higher and even though we come to church and we're hearing the word preached and we say well yeah that's the word of god that's kind of prophet we believe that but are we touching his thoughts are we catching this thought are we trying to interpret his thought are we trying to say i unders i i by knowledge understand his thought no we've got to catch his thought we have to have that thought come into our minds and pray nate that word that thought that because a a word is a thought spoken right or a thought is a word spoken and we need that that thought to come inside plant that seed and hide it hold it in this great battle that goes on in our mind too often we don't want the devil out when the devil is trying to get you to tell you that you can do what you want to do we don't want him out but now there's certain times we want him out because he's plaguing us and tormenting us the word devil means a tormentor and he keeps us up at night and we just we we just are so battled with these thoughts that we don't know where they're coming from so there's this this time that we want the devil out and then there's this time that we really want the devil there we don't want to hear be stirred up at church about something we need to be doing when we don't want to be doing it it's a reality wants to hear about laying down our lives to serve others anyways just giving up your time like why do we want to hear about praying in this spirit all the time when why did i kind of just pray when i get when i want to how about giving up our time to win a soul amen do we hunger for those thoughts we hunger for that in our minds god wants control of our minds so we'll follow his word god wants to be able to manifest his life of unconditional love he wants to show compassion long-suffering and all those great attributes that brother branham told us about at the very very beginning of what he wanted to do now he just didn't show it through jesus christ but he's showing it through his bride and just because i claim to be bride doesn't mean i'm showing it i still gotta die out i still gotta hunger for it but i know that is god's very heart to manifest himself through me the bible says the whole earth is groaning and waiting and travailing waiting for the sons of god to be manifested our minds are carnal the bible says they're not even subject to god so we need the mind of christ we need him to control our minds i mean there are times we looked at others and we've said you're not gonna control me you're just trying to control me you're just trying to manipulate me right come on this has happened to us a lot you're just being nice because of you're just saying that because of what we heard about belial messages right backwards music all that stuff previews about french fries and popcorn all of a sudden you're hungry god wants to place his mind inside of us that's where real peace comes from the mind of christ he wants to control our mind so we'll esteem others better than herself he gives more grace to the humble and with a humble mind we'll give more grace to others we won't be so judgmental we won't be so critical we won't put them on the chopping block and then make excuses for us while we do what we do i don't want one more scripture if i could before we dismiss it's the second peter chapter three it is the job of the holy ghost to stir us up to remind us of his word second peter chapter 3 verse 1 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by a way of remembrance pure minds by way of remembrance so we can have a pure mind and still need to be reminded that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of our lord and savior amen let's say it together may god continue to remind us of his will for our life stir us up enter into the word just because we hear the word doesn't mean it comes in but when your attitude says i want it i want it i hunger i thirst it comes in he comes where he's welcomed that's right i want to encourage you to be to welcome that word into your heart amen amen let's sing jesus be the lord of all or we can maybe uh he is lord either one jesus the lord of all jesus the lord of all [Music] the lord of all the kingdoms of [Music] jesus i surrender all jesus [Music] jesus i surrender all the kingdoms of my heart oh jesus be the lord of all jesus speak the lord of all jesus be the lord of all the kingdom of my heart oh jesus i surrendered amen yielded does i surrender all jesus i surrender all the kingdoms my heart she continues to play that slowly [Music] we don't know how much time we're gonna have we don't know when the lord is coming we don't know when it's going to be our last day even when god had warned paul that soon he was going to have to put off this old tabernacle there was something inside of paul to want to be his very best from that that moment forward didn't didn't want to didn't want to be half-hearted with god and and peter when he met jesus when he was walking out of jerusalem and he knew that it was his time to give his life there was something in peter that wanted to give his best and he felt it wasn't even worthy to be crucified but crucify me upside down and i'll just say to you we don't know how much time we have but let this moment as you move forward give your very best to god amen give them your very best amen it doesn't matter if you can hardly walk you can hardly think you can hardly eat give them your best that's something you can't do that's inside of you [Music] you don't have to do great things it's great to give them all your heart maybe we've been holding back some things in our life just holding on to our life maybe just satisfied with just i'm saved god is calling us press towards that mark a little bit more amen to you to life let the to let his holy spirit stir our minds up i'll just say surrender to him as we sing this again surrender to him amen it's like it's nothing we can force one another to do it's something that we're just encouraging one another to do amen jesus surrender all
