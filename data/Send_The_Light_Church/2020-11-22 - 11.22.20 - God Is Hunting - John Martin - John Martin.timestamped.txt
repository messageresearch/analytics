[31:53] amen
[31:54] amen god bless you let's i'll turn in
[31:56] the scriptures to saint john chapter 4
[32:00] saint john chapter 4.
[32:14] this is a familiar scripture that
[32:16] brother branham often referred
[32:18] back to when talking about the the woman
[32:22] at the well
[32:23] and how the discernment came about and
[32:26] he would often use that right before
[32:30] he would have his prayer lines
[32:33] and this would uh help
[32:35] show the sign and and increase
[32:38] faith and
[32:40] we just want to pick up
[32:41] a thought from it starting here in verse
[32:43] number 20
[32:45] uh 22
[32:49] jesus is
[32:51] making mention to the the woman he says
[32:53] ye
[32:54] worship ye know not what
[32:59] so he just come out and just made it
[33:01] clear ye
[33:02] worship ye know not what
[33:04] we know what we worship
[33:08] for salvation is of the jews but the
[33:10] hour cometh and now is when the true
[33:12] worshipers shall worship the father in
[33:15] spirit
[33:16] and in truth
[33:17] for the father seek as such to worship
[33:19] him
[33:21] god is a spirit and they that worship
[33:23] him must worship him
[33:25] in spirit and in truth
[33:27] and the woman said saith unto him i know
[33:30] the that the messiah cometh which is
[33:33] called christ when he has come
[33:36] he will tell us all
[33:40] things
[33:41] jesus saith unto her i that speak
[33:45] unto thee
[33:47] am he amen god bless you may be seated i
[33:51] want to say it's a a great
[33:53] uh blessing to see travis
[33:56] brother travis with us today
[33:59] it's been a long time
[34:01] and
[34:02] i know in in great part it's
[34:05] been because our brother has been
[34:08] them
[34:09] on demand to work i don't know how many
[34:11] i don't know if it's been a month solid
[34:13] work on all many days you've worked
[34:15] non-stop but
[34:17] when you're working that much just to to
[34:19] get a breather you're trying to recover
[34:21] and we want to continue to pray for our
[34:24] brother that god would give him a good
[34:26] job
[34:27] a job that wouldn't be over taxing and a
[34:30] job that would be rewarding
[34:32] and
[34:35] we do have a promise in the scriptures
[34:37] that if we seek first the kingdom
[34:39] that all other things will be added and
[34:43] let's just pray that god bless us our
[34:45] brother
[34:46] and our brother's wife amen
[34:49] well i would appreciate your prayers for
[34:51] next sunday we want to speak on the
[34:53] subject of god's condition if it would
[34:55] be the will of the lord
[34:58] um
[34:58] but this morning we want to take a
[35:01] little
[35:02] uh thanksgiving message because we're
[35:04] cancelling wednesday service and then
[35:07] title this god
[35:09] is hunting
[35:10] god is hunting and for a subject
[35:13] worshiping god
[35:17] i
[35:21] i so much appreciate the rest of the
[35:23] church that's not here
[35:25] my my heart is is there with you praying
[35:28] for you thinking about you wishing that
[35:30] you would be able to be with us
[35:32] and pray that god would just meet you in
[35:34] your homes and one day be able to
[35:37] to join together
[35:39] amen
[35:41] i believe that everyone is a hunter
[35:45] you may not like going out into the
[35:47] woods with a gun and and looking uh for
[35:50] a a a deer or some game but we're all in
[35:54] pursuit of something
[35:57] you're hunting something for your lives
[35:59] maybe you're in pursuit of more love and
[36:02] more peace or or joy or happiness
[36:05] this holiday season
[36:08] maybe you're seeking a closer walk with
[36:09] god
[36:12] maybe some some health
[36:15] or or just a deliverance for your life
[36:17] maybe you would like to
[36:19] like a better life a little extra money
[36:23] maybe a more dependable car a job with
[36:26] benefits and advancements a nicer house
[36:28] or just a safer area to live but we're
[36:32] all hunting something
[36:35] people have been consumed by the fear
[36:37] of this culvert 19 virus
[36:41] and people are are looking for hope
[36:44] they're hunting hope i mean i've seen
[36:47] some
[36:48] some pla some homes literally have put
[36:51] out their christmas lights before
[36:53] october was over
[36:58] i mean just looking for something to
[37:00] cheer about and the christmas song come
[37:02] on and just help give you a little bit
[37:04] of cheer
[37:06] the world has been hunting or seeking a
[37:09] vaccine
[37:12] a horrible virus that has caused a lot
[37:15] of damage to the world
[37:17] it has taken lives it is crippled
[37:20] economies
[37:21] so many people are unemployed
[37:24] it's caused lockdowns even happening
[37:27] again if i heard correct leaving canada
[37:30] had just closed down
[37:33] which further
[37:34] causes other social problems in life and
[37:37] depression and and mental illnesses and
[37:40] social problems
[37:43] one of the
[37:44] greatest problems to escalate in 2020
[37:48] is fear
[37:51] jesus warned us that in the last days
[37:54] men's hearts would be failing for fear
[37:57] it has been building and building like a
[37:59] snowball just getting worse and worse
[38:01] and worse
[38:03] they haven't been able to control the
[38:05] virus it is mutated almost a dozen times
[38:11] nations have
[38:13] looked
[38:14] to the world health organizations
[38:18] we have looked for the united states
[38:20] says has looked to the health leaders
[38:22] and our cdc for guidance
[38:25] but they keep changing things
[38:29] they've said some contradictory things
[38:31] about wear and mask
[38:34] they've changed their
[38:36] advice
[38:38] on
[38:39] whether they need to get a negative test
[38:41] before they go back to work before you
[38:43] had to have it now you don't they've
[38:46] changed the quarantine time between from
[38:48] 14 days to 10 days and now i heard it's
[38:51] seven days
[38:54] so many things are confusing the people
[38:56] and i suppose that the c d d c cdc is
[39:00] doing their best job to try to guide us
[39:04] and help us there's there's no question
[39:05] about it but you cannot put your trust
[39:09] in something that's ever evolving
[39:13] we need to look more to god
[39:15] i have more confidence in god speaking
[39:17] to his people than some something else
[39:20] now i know the world don't have anything
[39:22] else but we have something else
[39:28] we should look to the lord for guidance
[39:31] the bride does have the lord on her side
[39:36] i don't know what the world has
[39:39] but i know what the bride has
[39:44] we've been told that
[39:47] they have a couple vaccines out now
[39:50] claiming better than 90 percent success
[39:54] and they want the world to take it
[39:59] now i am not here speaking
[40:03] as
[40:04] an anointed person
[40:07] with
[40:08] health issues i want to make that clear
[40:10] but i am bringing a point about these
[40:12] things that i'm saying
[40:16] i read on the cdc website
[40:18] that while vaccine effectiveness i'm
[40:21] just quoting can vary recent studies
[40:24] show that flu vaccines reduce the risk
[40:27] of flu illnesses by between 40
[40:30] and 60 percent
[40:32] among the overall population during the
[40:34] seasons when most
[40:36] circulating flu viruses are well matched
[40:39] to the flu vaccines
[40:41] and that's i mean with the best
[40:43] connections that you're gonna get it's
[40:45] only gonna be forty to sixty that means
[40:47] forty to sixty percent of the people who
[40:50] do take it it doesn't do anything for
[40:52] them
[40:55] i wonder i'm just wondering what
[40:59] to what
[41:00] per to what kind of people's
[41:03] immune system doesn't help
[41:06] do you understand because this this
[41:08] coven 19 attacks a people whose whose
[41:11] immune system is not good
[41:15] so if that's the case in 40 to 60
[41:18] percent it it it doesn't do anything for
[41:22] i'm just saying we need to be looking
[41:24] more to the lord for our help
[41:28] i want to send that message
[41:31] to the church
[41:37] the world has been hunting answers for
[41:40] a new pandemic
[41:42] just like all of us have been seeking
[41:44] out answers for the things of our
[41:46] personal lives
[41:48] now why would
[41:50] they or us be seeking anything else
[41:54] in simplicity
[41:56] it's we're lacking it
[41:59] just trying to stay simple we're we're
[42:01] we're lacking and that's why we're
[42:02] seeking out our brother travis he's he's
[42:05] seeking out a better job
[42:08] he's needing it it's lacking in his home
[42:11] his home needs it
[42:14] it's no different with god
[42:16] while the world is desiring a vaccine
[42:18] and hunting to solve all its problems
[42:20] god is searching for true
[42:23] worshipers
[42:26] it's lacking
[42:31] if it wasn't lacking for him he wouldn't
[42:33] be searching it out
[42:35] our may our minds may not be subject
[42:40] with everything that's going
[42:42] on but
[42:45] god's mind
[42:47] is looking for true worshipers
[42:50] he is not distracted
[42:52] by this world situation
[42:58] i know two main things that god is after
[43:01] one
[43:02] he's seeking his lost children
[43:05] the sheep that have gone astray
[43:08] luke 15 7 says i say unto you that
[43:10] likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
[43:12] sinner that repenteth more than over 99
[43:15] just persons which have no repentance
[43:18] now there's been a lot of pandemics
[43:20] through the years
[43:25] but one thing they've come and gone but
[43:28] this scripture
[43:29] i believe there's been a lot of
[43:31] rejoicing in heaven through the years
[43:37] i don't think they're they're sitting in
[43:39] heaven
[43:42] i turned the heat up to 70 just so you
[43:44] know
[43:46] but we can turn it up more if somebody
[43:48] somebody wants it up more because
[43:51] okay i got to keep that one under the
[43:53] lid
[43:55] i have to sneak under there like
[44:00] camouflage
[44:01] [Laughter]
[44:02] um
[44:05] but they're not psycho they're not
[44:08] social distancing in heaven
[44:14] but they are rejoicing this morning over
[44:17] every sinner that repents
[44:22] that's one the other thing is god is
[44:25] seeking true worshipers
[44:28] not just worship now not just any kind
[44:30] of worship but a true
[44:32] worshiper
[44:36] the bible says the hour cometh he speak
[44:39] and then said the hour cometh
[44:42] i wonder if this is the hour that was
[44:44] supposed to come
[44:45] and he says and now is when the true
[44:48] worshipers shall worship the father in
[44:51] spirit and in truth for the father
[44:54] seeketh such to worship him
[44:58] god is in pursuit today
[45:01] he's searching for something he wants
[45:04] because he's he's missing it
[45:08] all things were created for his pleasure
[45:10] and it pleases god to receive true
[45:13] worship from
[45:14] true worshipers
[45:17] notice he just doesn't use the word
[45:19] worshipper and the old kind of worshiper
[45:22] it's a true worshiper
[45:26] now when it comes to praise and worship
[45:28] there's no switzerland
[45:31] there's no neutral thoughts excuse me
[45:33] thoughts about praise
[45:35] we are either believers who believe in
[45:37] worshiping and praising
[45:39] god who's worthy of it
[45:42] or
[45:43] we don't worship and praise the lord
[45:48] people are either seeking to praise god
[45:51] or they're seeking
[45:52] to be praised
[45:55] they're either looking to make sure that
[45:57] god is praised or they're taking it away
[46:01] from god
[46:03] there are only two spirits
[46:05] one is to worship god
[46:07] and the other
[46:09] is to want to receive it
[46:13] satan wanted to be like the most high
[46:17] in the aspects of being exalted
[46:20] so one spirit is to exalt god in his
[46:24] proper place and the other spirit is not
[46:26] to exalt him it's just the two spirits
[46:30] and our reason
[46:32] would be the same in this aspect as
[46:34] satan
[46:35] we want to do our own thing
[46:38] we want to do our own thing
[46:42] so we were created to worship the lord
[46:44] and to bring god glory so when we're not
[46:47] doing that what are we doing we're doing
[46:49] our own thing
[46:52] so that's why i wanted to say there's no
[46:54] switzerland
[46:56] in this
[46:58] the reason that some people feel so
[46:59] uncomfortable around true praise and
[47:02] worship is because they're not used to
[47:05] worshiping god themselves
[47:08] it's odd to them it's it's more of a
[47:10] foreign feeling to them
[47:14] i had one person tell me
[47:17] just the other day he says well i can't
[47:19] do that whole church thing
[47:23] but god is still searching for those
[47:26] that will worship him in spirit and in
[47:28] truth
[47:30] it's a choice
[47:34] i'm not going to downplay those that
[47:36] don't want to
[47:38] i just know what god's after
[47:42] before we get into
[47:44] what god is hunting for i would like to
[47:46] read some things to help us understand
[47:49] there's a big difference between praise
[47:51] and worship
[47:52] it's kind of going to be a little bit of
[47:54] a of a study
[47:56] and
[47:58] i believe it will help us to understand
[48:00] true worship that's the reason i want to
[48:02] get into this
[48:04] even though god desires praise the bible
[48:07] says let all that have breath praise ye
[48:09] the lord
[48:10] the lord is still seeking after a
[48:12] particular quality of worship
[48:16] i want to understand the difference
[48:18] between praise and worship can bring a
[48:20] new
[48:21] depth to the way we honor the lord
[48:23] throughout the bible
[48:25] the commands to praise the lord are too
[48:28] numerous to mention there's so many of
[48:30] them
[48:31] the angels
[48:33] and heavenly hosts are commanded to
[48:35] praise the lord
[48:37] all inhabitants of the earth are
[48:38] instructed to praise the lord
[48:41] and we can praise him with singing with
[48:43] shouting with dancing
[48:45] with musical instruments and there's
[48:47] scriptures for all these
[48:51] christian praise can be defined as an
[48:54] expression of gratitude and thanksgiving
[48:59] that's how praises it's expressed
[49:04] with
[49:05] a gratitude inside
[49:07] what god has perhaps done for us
[49:09] a thanksgiving
[49:11] first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18
[49:13] says
[49:14] in everything
[49:16] give thanks
[49:18] for this is the will of god in christ
[49:20] jesus concerning you
[49:22] now you can just put your name in there
[49:26] it is the will of god concerning john
[49:28] martin
[49:30] or you can say that's not for me
[49:34] it's it's totally up to you
[49:37] in our test in our trials
[49:40] we can give thanks and count it all joy
[49:43] in our persecutions and afflictions we
[49:45] can rejoice and give god an expression
[49:48] of gratitude
[49:50] only as believers we can do this because
[49:54] we know
[49:57] we know that we love god we know that
[49:59] we're called according to his purpose we
[50:02] know everything is going to work out for
[50:04] our good
[50:07] we can give thanks
[50:09] but people go through things and they
[50:11] have a hard time being thankful and
[50:13] grateful
[50:14] and the the reason is is they don't
[50:16] really know who they are
[50:20] they've lost that vision
[50:22] of who they belong to
[50:24] who they're in love with and who holds
[50:26] them in the palm of their hand
[50:28] and that god doesn't let things happen
[50:30] to us because he's just too busy
[50:35] in everything give thanks
[50:37] for this is the will of god in christ
[50:39] jesus constraining you
[50:41] praise is the joyful recounting
[50:46] of all
[50:47] god has done for us
[50:51] it is closely interweaned
[50:55] with thanksgiving
[50:57] as we offer back to god appreciation
[51:00] for his mighty works on our behalf
[51:04] praise is universal and can be applied
[51:08] to other relationships as well just got
[51:10] this off the internets really makes
[51:12] sense
[51:13] we can praise our family
[51:16] our friends
[51:18] our boss
[51:19] or the paper boy
[51:22] praise does not require anything of us
[51:27] it is merely the truthful
[51:29] acknowledgement of the righteous acts of
[51:32] another
[51:34] and since god has done so many wonderful
[51:36] deeds he is worthy to be praised
[51:40] psalms chapter 18 verse 1
[51:45] a psalm of david
[51:48] the servant of the lord who spake unto
[51:51] the lord the words of this song in the
[51:53] day that the lord delivered him from the
[51:56] hand of all his enemies
[51:59] and from the hand of saul
[52:00] and he said i will love thee
[52:05] oh lord my strength verse 2 the lord is
[52:08] my rock and my fortress and my deliverer
[52:11] my god my strength in whom i will trust
[52:15] my buckler
[52:16] and the horn of my salvation
[52:19] and my high tower and i will call upon
[52:21] the lord who is worthy to be
[52:25] praised so just remembering what god has
[52:28] done for us we can offer up a praise to
[52:31] him
[52:33] god has done so much for us saints it
[52:35] should be easy for us to praise him
[52:41] another thing about praise is that
[52:43] praise can actually be perfected
[52:46] if we're extremely young in the lord
[52:50] you don't have to be serving the lord
[52:52] very long matthew chapter 21 verse 12
[52:55] let's look at these scriptures
[53:00] i just don't want us to get praised and
[53:02] worship mixed up because we can kind of
[53:04] blend them together
[53:06] matthew 21 verse 12 12 and jesus went to
[53:10] the temple of god and cast out all then
[53:12] that sold and bought in the temple and
[53:14] overthrew the tables of the money
[53:15] changers and the seats of them that sold
[53:19] doves and he said unto them as written
[53:21] my house shall be called a house of
[53:23] prayer but you have made it something
[53:25] different
[53:28] you made it something different no we
[53:29] don't sell things in here
[53:32] but that doesn't mean we can do other
[53:33] things here
[53:36] it's still a house of prayer we need to
[53:37] keep it a house of prayer amen
[53:41] and the blind and the lame came into the
[53:43] temple and he healed them
[53:46] notice he didn't kick them out
[53:48] and when the chief priest and the scribe
[53:50] saw the wonderful things he did
[53:53] and the children
[53:55] crying in the temple and saying hosanna
[53:58] to the son of david
[54:00] they were sore displeased
[54:04] and he said unto him hearst thou what
[54:07] thee say
[54:08] and jesus saith unto them
[54:11] yea
[54:12] have you never read
[54:14] out of the mouth of babes and suckling
[54:18] thou has perfected
[54:20] praise
[54:25] because praise has so much to do with
[54:27] gratitude and and thankfulness
[54:31] and when you're focusing sincerely on
[54:33] your heart for what god has done for you
[54:36] it's quite easy to bring a perfect
[54:40] praise
[54:41] to god
[54:43] but true worship on the other hand takes
[54:46] so much more
[54:51] so much more
[54:56] from
[54:56] a believer that uh that a young believer
[54:59] doesn't even know how to worship
[55:04] worship is different
[55:06] than praise
[55:09] worship comes from a different place
[55:10] within our spirits
[55:13] worship should be reserved for god alone
[55:19] it's no longer about
[55:22] praising the boss on boss's day
[55:26] right
[55:27] or one another
[55:30] worship is reserved for god alone there
[55:32] came a time when lucifer wanted to be
[55:35] exalted and worshipped just like god was
[55:39] and when he finally got his opportunity
[55:41] we can go to luke chapter four
[55:45] he got jesus alone and got jesus was in
[55:48] a very weak time he had fasted for 40
[55:50] days and 40 nights
[55:54] and
[55:55] satan was trying to get
[55:57] jesus to worship him
[55:59] and he responded in verse 8 here of luke
[56:01] chapter 4 get thee behind me satan for
[56:04] it is written thou shall worship the
[56:06] lord thy god and him only shall thou
[56:10] serve
[56:14] worship
[56:15] is an art of losing yourself
[56:20] in their adoration of god the only thing
[56:23] that's there is god
[56:26] praise can be a part of worship but
[56:28] worship goes way beyond praise
[56:31] praise is easy and worship is hard
[56:36] worship gets to the heart of who we
[56:39] really are
[56:42] to truly worship god we must let go of
[56:45] our self-worship
[56:48] we must be willing to humble ourselves
[56:50] before god surrender every part of our
[56:53] lives to his control and adore him
[56:57] adore him
[56:58] for who he is
[57:00] not just what he's done for us
[57:03] a man for who he is
[57:05] the person not the acts
[57:09] worship
[57:10] is a lifestyle
[57:12] not just an occasional activity we're
[57:15] going to church to worship the lord
[57:23] in the scripture praise is usually
[57:25] presented as a boisterous
[57:28] joyful
[57:29] uninhibited
[57:32] expression to god
[57:34] god invites praise of all kinds from his
[57:37] creation
[57:39] jesus said if the people don't praise
[57:41] them even the stones will cry out
[57:46] when the bible mentions worship however
[57:49] the tone changes
[57:52] we read verses like worship the lord
[57:55] in the beauty of holiness
[57:59] come let us worship and bow down
[58:03] see often worship is coupled with the
[58:06] act of bowing and kneeling which shows
[58:09] humility and contriteness
[58:12] it is through true worship that we
[58:15] invite the holy spirit to speak to us
[58:16] now this is important because when we're
[58:19] not really hearing from god the way we
[58:20] want to i mean it's just been a while
[58:23] and i really i just want to hear from
[58:25] god
[58:27] true worship
[58:29] opens the door for hearing from god
[58:36] through worship we realign our
[58:38] priorities
[58:40] with god
[58:43] it's through true worship we invite the
[58:45] holy spirit to speak to us to convict us
[58:49] to comfort us
[58:51] whatever we might need
[58:53] but we need
[58:55] to realign our priorities with god
[58:58] and acknowledge him once more in the
[59:00] rightful position that he belongs in
[59:06] praise can be perfected in a young
[59:09] believer who doesn't hardly know god but
[59:11] worship true worship the more that you
[59:14] know the more god expects
[59:18] your worship becomes higher
[59:21] more real
[59:24] just as praise interwines with gratitude
[59:26] and thankfulness worship intertwines
[59:29] with surrender a surrendered life
[59:32] when you worship god you give yourself
[59:36] to him you ever get just locked away
[59:39] michael w smith i'm coming back
[59:41] to the center
[59:43] the center of
[59:44] worship we're
[59:47] what's really important
[59:49] he says it's it's all about you
[59:52] it's all about you
[59:55] i mean i can put on a song
[59:58] and i feel so good
[1:00:00] one of my favorites it just gets me in
[1:00:02] the mood and gets me happy
[1:00:05] gets me tapping my feet
[1:00:07] and then i can put another song on and
[1:00:09] i'm just
[1:00:11] dripping with tears
[1:00:15] because it gets down there deep inside
[1:00:18] of my spirit and it makes me want to
[1:00:21] surrender my life to god i'm i'm so
[1:00:25] ashamed of my sins and how i failed him
[1:00:29] but when i'm hearing that happy praise
[1:00:31] song
[1:00:34] i ain't thinking about how bad i am
[1:00:37] he's thinking about how good he's been
[1:00:39] to
[1:00:40] me different praise and worship is
[1:00:43] different
[1:00:45] god is looking for true worshipers
[1:00:48] praise is perfected in babes
[1:00:51] but he's looking for something greater
[1:00:54] are you with me
[1:00:58] it is impossible to worship god
[1:01:02] and anything else at the same time
[1:01:08] the physical acts often associated with
[1:01:10] worship bowing kneeling lifting hands
[1:01:13] helps to create the necessary attitude
[1:01:16] of humility
[1:01:18] which is what is required for real
[1:01:20] worship
[1:01:22] it's an attitude i was gonna put this
[1:01:24] one in here because this is all these
[1:01:27] these thoughts that i'm reading had come
[1:01:29] off the internet and i just it was just
[1:01:32] too good not to use
[1:01:35] this is for brother ron though it was
[1:01:37] this is right after i was debating
[1:01:38] whether i was going to read it but
[1:01:40] it says
[1:01:42] wise worship leaders
[1:01:44] know how to structure a worship service
[1:01:46] to allow the participants to both praise
[1:01:49] and worship the lord
[1:01:51] often surfaces begin with the joyful
[1:01:54] praise songs
[1:01:55] and transition to a quieter more
[1:01:58] introspective
[1:02:00] opportunity for worship and i like the
[1:02:02] way that it says that is giving way
[1:02:06] for
[1:02:08] us
[1:02:09] to have an opportunity to enter into a
[1:02:11] deeper worship
[1:02:17] but i i don't know how many times i've
[1:02:19] felt what brother ron is is felt
[1:02:22] he's up here trying to get us to worship
[1:02:25] the lord to praise the lord
[1:02:27] and we're having a hard time entering in
[1:02:30] but you know what sister and i can
[1:02:32] really see in the scriptures real well
[1:02:34] while god is actually searching
[1:02:37] seeking for true worshipers because it's
[1:02:39] not easy
[1:02:41] people are so involved in the natural
[1:02:45] life that they're living in they come
[1:02:46] into this spiritual house of prayer and
[1:02:49] they're not they're not where they need
[1:02:51] to be
[1:02:53] you you can't come into god's house have
[1:02:55] the word pump you up and then you know
[1:02:59] no we're supposed to enter into his
[1:03:01] gates with thanksgiving and there is
[1:03:03] courts with praise
[1:03:05] amen lord help us
[1:03:11] worship is an attitude of the heart
[1:03:14] if a person is only going through the
[1:03:16] outward emotions
[1:03:18] without the attitude of surrendering all
[1:03:21] he is really not
[1:03:23] worshipping
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:27] god sees our heart
[1:03:30] he desires and deserves sincere
[1:03:34] heartfelt
[1:03:35] worship
[1:03:38] god is a hunter
[1:03:41] and he's hunting this hour for true
[1:03:42] worshipers
[1:03:44] one of the definitions of hunt is one
[1:03:47] that searches after something
[1:03:52] he's seeking such to worship him that
[1:03:54] word seek means to search after to
[1:03:56] inquire and it also means to hunt and
[1:03:59] that's why that right there is why
[1:04:01] entitled this
[1:04:03] god is a hunter
[1:04:05] and god is hunting
[1:04:07] if someone is seeking after something
[1:04:09] that simply means they don't have it and
[1:04:11] and and god is is lacking
[1:04:15] true worshipers now you would think with
[1:04:17] all of heaven available and all those
[1:04:19] that are are worshiping in heaven that
[1:04:21] god would just simply be content with
[1:04:23] what he's got why is he searching for
[1:04:25] more
[1:04:28] because he created us for a purpose
[1:04:32] and until that purpose is fulfilled
[1:04:37] now he knows
[1:04:39] he's not going to get true worship from
[1:04:41] the devil
[1:04:43] and he's not going to get it from the
[1:04:45] world
[1:04:48] but he expects it from his children
[1:04:52] this is time for us to step up
[1:04:55] step up our worship
[1:04:57] amen don't just kind of blend it all
[1:05:01] together but
[1:05:03] learn how to worship the lord
[1:05:06] now a seeker is someone who always wants
[1:05:10] to know more
[1:05:12] and just think about god as i'm reading
[1:05:14] this to point where their minds become
[1:05:18] restless
[1:05:19] if you're seeking you're not just
[1:05:21] curious
[1:05:23] you are defined by your curiosity
[1:05:27] and god is defined by his restless
[1:05:30] desire for hearts that will surrender to
[1:05:32] him
[1:05:34] and worship him in spirit in truth
[1:05:36] that's what god is looking for
[1:05:39] remember if god is not lord of
[1:05:41] everything
[1:05:43] he's reading that lord at all
[1:05:46] so he is dealing with every one of our
[1:05:48] hearts in trying to get us to a place
[1:05:52] where
[1:05:52] he's
[1:05:53] lord of all of our lives because we all
[1:05:55] can stand and testify and say right here
[1:05:58] you know i gave this
[1:06:00] um
[1:06:01] this this liquor and this marijuana and
[1:06:04] and this to god so many years ago and i
[1:06:07] i've made him lord of that particular
[1:06:09] part of my life
[1:06:11] but god is not just interested in my
[1:06:14] drink liquor and drugs and in in my
[1:06:18] gambling
[1:06:19] he's interested in all aspects of my
[1:06:22] life and he's looking for a a complete
[1:06:26] true worshiper
[1:06:28] and that's why i say this this message
[1:06:30] is for us
[1:06:32] but it is just up to us to find out
[1:06:34] where we're missing in our worship
[1:06:38] this is not about offending somebody
[1:06:40] it's never it's never about that
[1:06:43] it's about god calling us to the place
[1:06:45] that he wants us to be
[1:06:49] when lucifer was a part of heaven he
[1:06:51] took advantage of god
[1:06:55] he clearly understands that he cannot
[1:06:57] create anything
[1:06:59] but he does
[1:07:00] have the ability
[1:07:02] he can't create life but he does have
[1:07:03] the ability to create an atmosphere
[1:07:06] and he did create one
[1:07:10] he created an atmosphere
[1:07:12] that actually
[1:07:14] took away
[1:07:16] worship
[1:07:17] from god
[1:07:20] because before lucifer there wasn't that
[1:07:22] there
[1:07:26] so he created an atmosphere that
[1:07:28] actually stole
[1:07:30] worship from god
[1:07:33] and took it upon himself because he did
[1:07:35] not have the ability to create something
[1:07:37] so it would worship him
[1:07:40] so he stole something that god created
[1:07:45] created an atmosphere to make them you
[1:07:48] know what
[1:07:50] i could simply
[1:07:52] do my own thing
[1:07:54] i don't have to worship god anymore
[1:07:57] and that was appealing
[1:07:59] obviously to a third of heaven
[1:08:04] and they may have not said oh lucifer oh
[1:08:06] lucifer maybe they did who knows
[1:08:10] they were just probably happy they could
[1:08:11] do their own thing
[1:08:15] he perverted the atmosphere
[1:08:18] that god had created
[1:08:21] and we all have the ability
[1:08:24] to create an atmosphere around us
[1:08:29] either that will bring god praise and
[1:08:31] glory
[1:08:33] or
[1:08:34] it will actually take praise away from
[1:08:37] god
[1:08:44] all things
[1:08:45] were created
[1:08:47] for god
[1:08:50] that those things would bring praise and
[1:08:53] worship and honor and glory to god
[1:08:56] but that doesn't mean the whole creation
[1:09:00] worships god
[1:09:01] he came to his own but his own received
[1:09:03] him not
[1:09:05] jesus said in john chapter 10 verse 8
[1:09:08] all things that he said all that ever
[1:09:10] came before me are thieves
[1:09:13] and robbers
[1:09:16] wow
[1:09:17] now this is the identification that
[1:09:20] jesus has
[1:09:22] what does that mean
[1:09:25] people are still
[1:09:27] trying to take advantage of god if i
[1:09:31] was going to rob something or steal
[1:09:34] something from somebody
[1:09:36] one way that i could do it
[1:09:38] is i could say to brother mark brother
[1:09:41] mark
[1:09:42] can i borrow this pen
[1:09:44] and i know brother mark he would say you
[1:09:47] certainly can i think it's yours anyways
[1:09:49] no
[1:09:50] but he would say sure
[1:09:52] and i'd take this pin i'd say thank you
[1:09:54] and i'd give it back
[1:09:56] and i just simply would not give it back
[1:10:01] i wouldn't be fair about the exchange
[1:10:07] and jesus is looking at many people that
[1:10:09] come to him as thieves and robbers just
[1:10:12] like the angel stole from him he was the
[1:10:15] creator
[1:10:17] and they left their first estate
[1:10:20] but people are still trying to take
[1:10:23] advantage of god they're they're
[1:10:24] stealing praise
[1:10:26] away from god
[1:10:30] instead of humbling themselves and say
[1:10:32] let's praise god
[1:10:34] they don't do it
[1:10:39] they're taking advantage of god
[1:10:40] withholding true worship from god
[1:10:46] because that's what he deserves
[1:10:50] and when we don't truly worship him
[1:10:52] we're stealing from god
[1:10:55] there's people that are trying to steal
[1:10:58] eternal life from god without giving
[1:11:01] them their lives
[1:11:08] well brother john that's
[1:11:10] not how i see it
[1:11:13] anytime you're holding back your life
[1:11:16] from god
[1:11:17] but you're still expecting him to give
[1:11:20] you eternal life
[1:11:22] god is not looking at you
[1:11:24] like a fair trade
[1:11:28] i don't want to offend you and say
[1:11:29] you're a thief and a robber but we just
[1:11:30] need a more revelation more
[1:11:34] understanding of what the free gift
[1:11:36] really is
[1:11:39] the free gift is not you get eternal
[1:11:41] life and you go do what you want to do
[1:11:44] it's not a christmas gift
[1:11:48] i wish we had time to get into it he
[1:11:50] says you want to follow me you got to
[1:11:52] deny yourself you've got to give up your
[1:11:54] will
[1:11:56] it's an exchange
[1:12:00] he gave his life for you you give your
[1:12:02] life for him
[1:12:04] it is that simple that's truly the
[1:12:06] greatest revelation if we could get that
[1:12:09] we would learn how to surrender our
[1:12:10] lives we would learn how to worship
[1:12:13] and not be satisfied with just having a
[1:12:16] praise service
[1:12:20] we'd do a praise service walk out and do
[1:12:21] what we want to do
[1:12:24] but have a worship service and you walk
[1:12:26] out you want to do his will
[1:12:28] come on now
[1:12:31] god is hunting for those
[1:12:33] who will know him as lord a true
[1:12:36] worshiper who are
[1:12:38] walking in the light that god is showing
[1:12:40] them
[1:12:40] who are learning how to surrender more
[1:12:43] of their will
[1:12:44] who are laying down their lives honestly
[1:12:47] for the brethren the scriptures that we
[1:12:49] hear about all the time this is a true
[1:12:52] worshiper
[1:12:56] and if this is you
[1:12:59] you are who god is looking for
[1:13:03] a true worshiper knows that all things
[1:13:06] work together for the good
[1:13:08] he just knows
[1:13:11] he knows he can count all things joy
[1:13:13] when he falls into diverse temptation
[1:13:16] he knows how to rejoice in his trials he
[1:13:18] knows that they're more precious than
[1:13:20] gold he knows how to take pleasures in
[1:13:22] his infirmities and afflictions why
[1:13:24] because he has a revelation that
[1:13:27] everything that's happening to him is
[1:13:29] going to work out for the good he is a
[1:13:31] true
[1:13:32] worshiper
[1:13:39] worship
[1:13:41] is not just going to church and
[1:13:45] kind of blending everything together and
[1:13:47] having a good worship service
[1:13:55] a lot of those
[1:13:58] places have what they call praise and
[1:14:00] worship bands
[1:14:02] when it comes to true worship
[1:14:05] it ain't with you in a band
[1:14:08] it's between you and god
[1:14:11] and it makes you true worship when you
[1:14:14] enter into god's presence
[1:14:17] you just feel like who am i i'm a man of
[1:14:19] unclean lips
[1:14:23] you're willing to go where god
[1:14:25] surrenders you like isaiah
[1:14:27] that's what true worship is
[1:14:29] praise
[1:14:31] is is different
[1:14:34] i don't say it shallow or shallow but it
[1:14:37] is
[1:14:39] praise comes from the depths of the
[1:14:41] heart
[1:14:44] and he's not looking for true worship
[1:14:48] the scripture said he's looking for true
[1:14:50] worshipers
[1:14:52] he's looking for the quality of the
[1:14:54] person
[1:14:57] it's a lifestyle
[1:15:00] it's something in all that we say and do
[1:15:03] let it be pleasing to you lord
[1:15:06] the hour
[1:15:09] cometh and now is when the true
[1:15:10] worshipers shall worship the father
[1:15:13] in spirit
[1:15:15] and in truth for the father seeketh such
[1:15:18] to worship him now that word worship if
[1:15:20] you look it up it means prostate oneself
[1:15:25] so you're presenting yourself in a very
[1:15:29] humble low
[1:15:31] reverent state
[1:15:35] god is a
[1:15:37] spirit
[1:15:38] and they that worship him must worship
[1:15:41] him in spirit and in truth
[1:15:46] never forget that what god is hunting
[1:15:48] for
[1:15:50] he's not looking just for church

[1:15:55] church
[1:15:57] amen

[1:16:27] this right now if you don't give
[1:16:30] god what's due
[1:16:32] unto his name i would say that we're
[1:16:35] robbing him
[1:16:38] now
[1:16:42] i'm just going to take this pin that you
[1:16:44] let me have or let me borrow
[1:16:48] now right now i can say sitting in this
[1:16:50] church
[1:16:51] i do not owe
[1:16:53] anybody
[1:16:54] here a pen
[1:16:57] you are not due a pen from me

[1:17:30] the glory
[1:17:32] if i didn't give him that pen back
[1:17:35] would not i be considered a robber
[1:17:39] and a thief
[1:17:42] in a very openly way
[1:17:45] you know what i'm saying or a sneaky way
[1:17:47] however you want to say that
[1:17:50] god deserves glory he deserves worship
[1:17:53] and it's due it's due
[1:17:55] unto his name
[1:17:58] and we're commanded to worship the lord
[1:18:01] in the beauty
[1:18:03] of holiness
[1:18:06] wow
[1:18:08] well when i look into his holiness
[1:18:11] i'm just a man of unclean lips i'm so
[1:18:14] far from where i need to be
[1:18:16] but it
[1:18:17] it points me to what i need to be
[1:18:20] that's why i need to worship him he is a
[1:18:23] holy god he's worthy of the of a proper
[1:18:26] worship and a proper praise

[1:19:04] if you will hear his voice
[1:19:06] and harden not your heart
[1:19:09] there is the choice
[1:19:14] we're either going to humble ourselves
[1:19:16] bow down our
[1:19:17] our pride and say lord i give you myself
[1:19:22] or we're going to keep our hearts hard
[1:19:25] and say well i've done my job i came to
[1:19:27] church
[1:19:28] this is all i should have to do
[1:19:32] psalms 99 verse 5
[1:19:35] exalt ye the lord our god and worship
[1:19:40] at his footstool
[1:19:42] for he is holy
[1:19:44] and his footstool

[1:19:51] the car when the song's gone i feel real
[1:19:54] good i just shouted out and i sing and i
[1:19:56] just feel real good those are my times
[1:20:01] are you sure you're not praising him
[1:20:08] worship at his footstool that's kind of
[1:20:11] a humbling thought doesn't say you know
[1:20:15] stand on stage
[1:20:19] it doesn't say
[1:20:21] next to him
[1:20:23] at his foot still

[1:20:31] psalms 138
[1:20:33] verse
[1:20:34] oh no let's go to psalms 132 verse 7.
[1:20:39] psalms 132 verse 7 we'll go to psalms
[1:20:41] 138 in a second we will go into his
[1:20:44] tabernacle
[1:20:46] and we will worship at his footstool
[1:20:50] you talk about purpose
[1:20:52] purpose in going into church
[1:20:56] is to get to a place in your worship
[1:20:59] that you're at his footstool
[1:21:01] you're not sitting there well i expect
[1:21:04] you know brother john better make me
[1:21:06] feel good
[1:21:09] you're here for the wrong reason
[1:21:12] this is not about brother john
[1:21:15] it it's about the message that god has
[1:21:19] to your heart
[1:21:22] psalms 138 verse 2
[1:21:25] i will worship
[1:21:26] toward the holy temple
[1:21:28] so this is what you can
[1:21:30] can do when you're away from church
[1:21:32] i will worship toward thy holy temple
[1:21:35] and praise thy name
[1:21:38] for thy loving kindness
[1:21:41] and for thy truth
[1:21:43] for thou has magnified thy word
[1:21:47] above all thy
[1:21:50] name
[1:21:51] that is powerful
[1:21:54] they that worship me must worship me in
[1:21:58] spirit
[1:21:59] and in truth
[1:22:03] now
[1:22:04] if
[1:22:05] brother roger
[1:22:08] i'm calling on you next you just wait
[1:22:11] if brother roger has a a revelation
[1:22:16] a great revelation that i don't have
[1:22:20] god does not require me
[1:22:23] to worship him in that revelation
[1:22:27] because i don't have it
[1:22:30] but he does expect brother roger to
[1:22:34] you can only walk in the light as god
[1:22:37] has given it to you
[1:22:41] now you come to church
[1:22:42] and you're not involved the word just
[1:22:45] falls by the wayside or
[1:22:47] it's on a hard ground or mixed with
[1:22:50] thorns or something like that you know
[1:22:52] god will require that of you or yours
[1:22:54] you should be at church and you don't
[1:22:56] come god will require that of you
[1:23:01] but what's important here when you're
[1:23:03] thinking about the truth it's not why
[1:23:05] i'm in the message
[1:23:09] it's about are you walking in the things
[1:23:10] that god has shown you
[1:23:12] it's personal worship is between you and
[1:23:14] god it's important that you don't just
[1:23:17] you'll leave things on the shelf all the
[1:23:19] time
[1:23:21] it's important that you you you say
[1:23:24] you're yeah and your nay is nay this is
[1:23:26] what i believe this is where i stand
[1:23:28] this is what i'm going to do you you
[1:23:29] don't just
[1:23:32] play with god
[1:23:34] because god is
[1:23:36] god is looking for true worshipers
[1:23:43] the bible tells us that the earth is
[1:23:45] going to burn
[1:23:46] like an oven
[1:23:49] and god is going to make a new heaven
[1:23:51] and new earth i want to close with the
[1:23:52] scripture
[1:23:53] in isaiah chapter 66 verse 22
[1:23:57] for as
[1:23:58] the new heavens
[1:24:01] and the new earth
[1:24:02] which i
[1:24:04] will make
[1:24:06] shall remain before me saith the lord
[1:24:10] shall shall your seed
[1:24:12] in your name
[1:24:14] remain
[1:24:15] and it shall come to pass
[1:24:17] that from
[1:24:18] one new moon to another and from one
[1:24:21] sabbath to another shall all flesh come
[1:24:25] to worship before me saith the lord
[1:24:33] god desires worship
[1:24:36] he's going to desire when this whole
[1:24:38] thing's over he's going to want to be
[1:24:39] worshipped
[1:24:40] why would we not want to get involved
[1:24:43] today
[1:24:45] look the more we let the world
[1:24:47] bother us the less we feel like
[1:24:49] worshipping
[1:24:52] yet we may get sick of the world we may
[1:24:54] get an attitude towards the world
[1:24:57] but it doesn't mean we're more in love
[1:24:58] with god
[1:25:02] it's different spirits
[1:25:05] it would be better if we just had these
[1:25:09] these things on
[1:25:12] now i know we need to watch and pray
[1:25:15] but i don't want to watch that stuff
[1:25:22] how many times have you said or heard
[1:25:27] i don't want to watch the news or hear
[1:25:29] the news anymore
[1:25:32] we've all been there
[1:25:34] all been there all i wonder why
[1:25:37] because
[1:25:38] enough's enough
[1:25:42] we and we're rock solid believe that
[1:25:45] it's so confusing so discouraging
[1:25:49] but
[1:25:51] how many has ever said i am not going to
[1:25:53] worship the lord anymore
[1:25:58] see the devil is sucking us
[1:26:02] into the world
[1:26:04] and we got to take a stand
[1:26:08] we come together as brothers and sisters
[1:26:10] of like precious faith with a purpose
[1:26:14] to worship the lord
[1:26:16] to give him
[1:26:18] what he is due to his name
[1:26:22] and you can't expect the worship leader
[1:26:26] to do it for you
[1:26:28] you cannot expect the preacher to preach
[1:26:32] it just right for you
[1:26:36] get get critical with yourself
[1:26:40] come to church with a spirit of worship
[1:26:44] to worship true praise
[1:26:47] i can't wait till the doors are open
[1:26:50] to behold the beauty of the lord to
[1:26:53] inquire in his temple because i'm
[1:26:55] seeking to know god and god is seeking
[1:26:57] to the truth to know the true worshiper
[1:27:00] to have praise he can go out and get any
[1:27:03] you know me different praise and worship
[1:27:06] groups are out there
[1:27:08] you know what i'm saying
[1:27:10] it's all about entertainment
[1:27:15] and even if you dedicate yourself
[1:27:20] to
[1:27:21] i'm only
[1:27:22] we're only going to do this for the lord
[1:27:25] you can start out that way and be just
[1:27:27] as sincere and true but the devil will
[1:27:30] try to get into it and he'll try to
[1:27:32] bring some sort of entertainment
[1:27:37] so we've gotta we've gotta press in
[1:27:40] so you know maybe this message would be
[1:27:42] a a message of
[1:27:44] of
[1:27:44] we got to like take the the uh
[1:27:48] foot off the the the gas of just letting
[1:27:50] anything happen
[1:27:52] going in the old place and just coming
[1:27:54] into here with just some some some
[1:27:57] thought process of learning something
[1:28:00] but i'm coming here to meet the lord to
[1:28:02] worship him
[1:28:04] and not just be satisfied with just a
[1:28:06] happy praise
[1:28:09] but let god come into the heart deal
[1:28:11] with the heart and worship him from the
[1:28:13] depths because you're not a babe no more
[1:28:16] amen you're not a babe no more
[1:28:19] you're his bride
[1:28:22] the bride will be worshiping there are
[1:28:24] true worshipers amen

[1:28:34] after make it easy for him to find you
[1:28:40] because you're always
[1:28:42] in the spirit
[1:28:44] always giving praise
[1:28:46] always worshiping him
[1:28:49] from the depths of your heart
