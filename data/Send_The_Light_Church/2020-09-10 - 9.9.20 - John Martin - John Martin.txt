TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and god bless you tonight turn with me if you would to the book of first john chapter one verse one we got a chance to talk to brother andrew from india he called and sends his greetings to everybody um the covet is still bad there in india and um well you know they're real real poor there they can't they're not able to gather but they're using a phone they call in on their cell phones and they get to hear it's been about um six or nine months for them doing it like this but he's doing well he seems happy and he his visa expired so but when he went to go ahead and try to get his visa they had closed down the government building so we want to just continue praying how the enemy would like to use us and has used this to really hurt christians and we know there's so squeeze coming in some fashion former way we just as brother ron said we just want to really appreciate times that we do have to gather together we know it's sacrificing and hard for all of us um but it'll be worth it all when we get on the other side amen let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer heavenly father we do thank you for the opportunity that we have together together with brothers and sisters of light precious faith the family of god that believed the revealed word of the hour lord we have that in common we thank you for that lord we do ask that you remember those that are not with us tonight that would much rather be with us tonight but affliction is has come their way tonight we just ask that you touch their bodies lord that you bring healing to each of them and father that you'd restore their your health and pray that you'd bless them at this time lord as their perhaps watching lord the livestream may your presence come into the room where they're at lord just lift them up lord father we pray that you meet with us here lord in a very special way in the way of the revealing of your word to us lord the way that our lives could could be changed our natures could be more like you lord bless each heart father we commit the service to you and ask your blessings on the reading of the word now in jesus precious amen amen first john chapter 1 starting with verse number one that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon with our hands and handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you eternal life which was with the father and was manifested into us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with the son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full god bless you may be seated um well brother marty did a a marvelous men's meeting and laid a good foundation for the service tonight he talked about living for others and loving others and he made a statement he says there's always a manifestation and i want us to to focus on that tonight we can see this in in our opening scriptures here we want to entitle this message show and tell and for a subject showing others eternal life john here speaking that we've we've seen with our eyes we've handled with our hands the word of life and it the life was manifested we've seen it we bear witness and now john is saying we show unto you eternal life actually showing something that's invisible which was with the father and was manifested in us that which we have seen and heard now we declare it on to you notice the manifestation you show it and then you declare it or you announce it the reason that you do this or that we do this as christians is that the people that we're talking to can actually have fellowship with us that they can go to heaven amen and that they may receive joy in their heart that's what john is saying here now many of us remember as young children in school we used to have what's called show-and-tell it was a special day we look forward to it show and tell was a time that we could uh actually learn more about others uh what their favorite uh uh thing was and they would they would talk about it and and often they would bring in maybe a favorite toy a stuffed animal or or a uh a car or something like that and maybe they would bring a game or they would show a magic trick or maybe bring a baseball that they got autographed to a game they went to uh maybe some artifact from a trip they went on or they showed a picture of them standing by the grand canyon they would they would talk about it sometimes they would bring in a live pet a dog a cat a guinea pig or a bunny and sometimes uh friends would bring in a favorite snack talk about the snack and share it with everybody and it was an exciting time and the thing that everyone looked forward to was actually seeing what they brought in that kind of like grabbed their attention the show always comes before the towel this show was what made your friends eyes get bigger and put a smile on their face and then after we seen it we wanted to hear all about it we wanted to hear more about it tell me about it you sleep with that where did you get that that was from the civil war you got that for your birthday i mean then the excitement came about everything that they were saying what grabs your attention comes to your eyes and then your ears want to hear all about it and it's really no different when you're sharing the gospel of jesus christ brother brother branham said in the mark of the beast he says the gate of your soul is our eyes it was always disappointing when someone came it was their turn to do the show and tell and they didn't bring anything did everybody remember seeing that experiencing that and i'll tell you that was always disappointing it was just it was it wasn't as interesting it was it was more boring and even children want to see a demonstration they want to see it and not just hear about it it's important so what is the attraction i was never attracted to someone who just wanted to talk about the gospel whose faith didn't follow it was a life that i saw personally demonstrated to me that got my attention i seen something i never seen anywhere else and our goal should want to be to live a life that nobody has seen before which takes a lot of work it takes a lot of effort it takes a lot of trying how can i live in this situation differently than the person i'm with that has never seen it before when you seen that person demonstrating got your attention it made you want to look deeper into the situation and then learn about it where did you learn to live like that what nicodemus say about jesus we know that thou art man of god no man can do these things except he be of god then he wanted to hear more by this show and tell by this demonstration shall all men know you're my disciples when you demonstrate loving others the same way that i have loved you god bless you sister we we will at the end okay just that we can keep the cotton continuity going but we definitely want to hear from you jesus never said by this talk shall all men know it's a demonstration of love you can't talk love it has to be demonstrated love is a verb it's alive no greater show-and-tell no greater demonstration than this than a man lay down his life for his friends so here jesus is saying this is how you show the world you lay down your life for the need don't tell somebody what they need to do the the greatest love that can be shown is when you give up all that you are to help a soul get where they need to get to demonstrate it and then tell them all about the love that changed your nature that made you so willingly eagerly to lay down your life because if you just you just go around you talk to everybody everybody's into themself it's all about what they do what they've done what they're going to do and if they're talking about others it's usually something negative it's the same thing there you either build yourself up or you cut somebody else down to make you it's all about you and when you see someone that's generally interested in somebody else's soul now this is important we talked about this in our men we can't be interested just in the shirt they're wearing the tie they're wearing the car they're driving the natural needs it has to be about something to do with changing their nature that's what the soul is the nature has to be changed when you i i i love brother marty for so many reasons i can't count them and brother barney is just he's always he's always teaching and helping and i just love him but he was always trying to instruct our girls to make sure they they checked their tire pressure in their cars before they leave make sure everything is right and i just think man he's doing a better job than i am they're my children so i love them for many reasons and this is a natural love that we have for one another but there's no greater love that when you show a spiritual love now a spiritual love is when you lay down your life for somebody's soul you're willing to get your hands dirty to talk about things and you don't want to walk into show and tell and just talk because they want to kick you i've heard this so many times but when they see that you care about their life you're showing them eternal life amen you're showing them different than this life yeah we're short and it's time for us to start showing eternal life to others show them the gospel don't just tell them about it show them first and then declare or announce for the life of christ was manifested and we seen it and bear witness and show unto you eternal life amen showing it isn't an awesome thought you can actually show somebody eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us has has eternal life been manifested to you amen that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that we can have fellowship together and that we can have joy what a wonderful scriptures there now when brother branham got back from visiting eternal life i like to make mention of some things that he said and just try to get the continuity because this is what we need to be showing others he said there are no words in the vocabulary to describe it but we can show it if you have it he said it was a pure love there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness there was no selfishness mix in it why because all we heard was everybody was saying oh my precious brother it was about the other person and anytime they talked about themselves they said well i wouldn't have been here if it wasn't been for you it was always esteeming the other better than yourself he said this is something entirely different entirely different than human love he said it was a perfect love and he he says only supreme beauty and joy was what he was feeling there that's something we should be feeling inside he said a voice spoke to me this is what you preached that the holy ghost is this is perfect love nothing can nothing can enter here without it you cannot separate the holy ghost from perfect love you know we want to make it two different things but the voice spoke to him when he was feeling all this he says well what is all this he said the voice said this is what you preach what was the holy ghost you know we want to claim the holy ghost and it don't matter what kind of love we show you know we'll stand up i'm filled i'm sealed i got it no one's gonna talk me out of it and then you don't you're acting like to me a good evidence of the holy ghost is you have genuine perfect love not just being nice to people but you you're perfect love with the word you take the word you you love that word great peace have they that love thy law and nothing shall offend them that's why jesus said by this shall all men know you're my disciples or that you have the holy ghost when you can have perfect love one towards another even your enemies to me that's a mature disciple of a christian what good would it do to claim that you got the holy ghost and live a selfish life people look at having the holy ghost like let me see i got this card this card this i got oh here it is right here what good would it do that to to claim you got the holy ghost and live a selfish life what good would you claim to have a holy ghost and can't show others eternal life if all we can do is tell somebody but you can't show it don't tell me you have it you need to be seeking it get to a place where it's bubbling it's babbling jesus said it'd be like a a well sprang it up within the eye brother bran says i am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter into that place so he's convinced before but when he went over he said i'm more convinced than ever he said press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful joyful place beyond the curtain of time now this is what our messenger said i guess you know here's my my take on this i'm not gonna preach justification gets me there that ain't what my messenger told me i guess if i lived under luther's message i could go for it but we've got more truth and god expects more out of us the first thing he said to god when he came back he says oh god help me never let me compromise with the word let me stay straight on the word i don't care what anyone else does lord let me press on to that beautiful joyful place he said that one visit there to me has made me a different man he visited eternal life and it made him different he says i could never never never three nevers i think we were talking in our men's meaning about threes really brings the point across i can never never never be the same brother brandon that i was whether the planes are rocking whether the lightning is flashing whether the spy has a gun on me whatever it is it doesn't matter i'm going to press the battle and by the grace of god for i preach the gospel to every creature and every person i can persuading them to that beautiful place yonder notice how coming in contact with eternal life made him he was not interested in anything else it was just the opposite he was more interested in getting as many people to this place as possible he wasn't just amen now i'm going to go and live my life down here on the planet no if you really have it you want others to be here i questioned the believer claiming to have something so powerful that will make you love everyone including your enemies it'll make you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord and yet live a selfish life i question that because i've got to stay with the word i've got to stay with the mess or what he said it's not about us just having a beautiful funeral service no matter what it's about coming in line with what the word wants us to be if i have eternal life how could it be living for myself the definition of the prophet gave it was living for others and spiritually speaking now you've got a whole bunch of people naturally they got all sorts of programs living for one another naturally but that's no more eternal life it seems like no matter whatever was going to befall brother branham's life he was more determined than ever to get souls to christ he went on to say the sons of kish may rise now to give you a little background king saul was the son of kish first samuel chapter 9 verse 2 tells that saul was a choice young man a goodly and there was not another uh there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders upward he was higher than any of the people so he was a choice goodly person sounds like the one we want to go with doesn't it the israelites came to samuel and demanded a king and they focused on having a king that modeled after the kings of other nations i mean did you ever wish that your pastor was like another pastor that's kind of what they were doing brother graham said the sons of kish may rise all the goodly things they do now he's i'm quoting him he says i have nothing evil to say against it giving to the poor and the charity and remember why why samuel told saul you're also going to prophesy and many of those men are great mighty preachers and can preach the word like archangels but still it wasn't god's will god was to be their king if the holy spirit is leading you he will always lead you to make jesus your king the king of your life the king of your will he's got to say so of your will let's look at the advice or the counsel of the seventh age messenger to us for the bride to make herself ready he says all my precious friends my beloved my darlings of the gospel my begotten children of god listen to me your pastor he says whatever you do now lay aside everything else until you get perfect love now that's really good advice he didn't say you better get into those seals [Music] you better get those trumpets lined up seventh grade education got revelation that was so high i'll just say it like this he got revelation that nobody else got and yet he pointed us to perfect love after he went and visited eternal life and came back nothing was spoken there about the mighty revelations but somehow we get thrilled with them i'll say i'm okay about getting through with revelation but if it don't produce a life if it don't make you want to lay down your life for a soul what good is it you know the prophet said we should better see jesus christ in every scripture in other words when you read it and you don't see jesus what's the use of reading it so if the revelation isn't going to lead us to become more like him and what was he he gave himself for us that's what he was oh i got it brother john i got it i got perfect brother bram says get to the place that you can actually manifest love to everyone even your enemies get to that place one place he said get to a spot that you can love everybody even your enemies and everything else i asked you today are you at that spot have you laid everything else aside to get to that spot no we just want to say i'm saved i'm going to heaven i've got eternal life and i don't i don't need to deal with that stuff why why do you not need to deal with that so that's in the message it's the responsibility that our seventh messenger gave us that came from him after he got back why do we want to put that just like a that doesn't mean very much put it aside if we're not at this spot then why aren't we pressing into that spot loving everyone including your enemies is perfect love it's a complete love what that word perfect means it means complete you can completely love everybody and not loving everyone the same all the time no matter what is an in complete love don't identify that as the love of god don't belittle god don't put them down here because you can't go up there just get serious and say god i need more holy ghost i need more holy ghost the more holy ghost the more love of god god ain't struggling loving frank brother god is love what brother branham was saying here was get to a place where you can have something to show the world because anybody can just love who they want to love and be standoffish towards other people they want to be standing anybody can do that there's no show-and-tell in that but when you can show a love to somebody that they talk behind your back brother branham said they come to brother branham and they told him they loved him and he knew they didn't he turned right back around and say i love you and he meant it he was manifesting eternal life he was showing them eternal life look at all the ways that paul showed that perfect love he showed he had eternal life we we talked about it all his journeys and his perils and his beatings and he got stoned in his prisons and his shipwrecks he was used by false brother and he took care of all the churches he was manifesting eternal life because prior to the nature change it was all about him what a marvelous opportunity to me paul had to show eternal life we want to show eternal life without suffering and i'll say friends it is impossible but yet we'll still struggle to do it are you saying brother john i don't got eternal life that's not what i'm saying jesus didn't stand in heaven and say i love you hope somehow you make it you know he came down for god so loved the world that he gave and you're going to tell me you for so loved that you're not going to give and you're gonna tell me you got the holy ghost and you're not gonna lay down your life that you got perfect love no you you need to take the definition that the prophet got he's a seer he came back from from beyond the curtain of time from eternal life he saw eternal life and he came back and he told us what it was i believe that many could bear witness that the life of jesus christ was manifested was seen bore witness and paul showed unto many people eternal life with his life you know when you read the letters you don't see him suffering see him instructing and and and he says he would say things like oh yeah i had persecutions in this place in this place and that place and you'd hear well um the holy ghost is telling me that uh bad things are gonna happen the places i'm gonna go you would hear little things like that but you never saw a life of suffering he never complained he never murmured he never squealed he never said it's unfair there was no reason for you to believe that he was being treated unfairly and i just say when you're so filled with the holy ghost you're so full of the love of god there's nothing but love that comes out no matter what jesus never complained on the cross are you to that point are you manifesting eternal life i know if i was to ask everybody's hand who's got your life boom the hands would go up but if i come over here and i said who's manifesting it well we would probably have our own little idea out where man i come to church i pay my tithe right we'd all fill in the blank how we're i i want us to take the words of the prophet i know it's not the mystery that you wanted here christ is hidden in simplicity you know he told paul told the same church that this love that he manifested in all those times was just a simple agape love when he laid down his life for everybody when he got torched and got back up remember stephen got stoned lord forgive him that was eternal life he was possessing eternal life and he was he was manifesting it and i'll tell you most people you throw stones at and they're calling you names and everything under the book now why didn't this man do it because he was manifesting something different than what other men had and paul described it to the to this church the same church that he had all he described all these things happened to he described it this love as totally selfless perfect love is not puffed up it doesn't envy or vaunteth itself it doesn't seeketh its own it doesn't think evil and it doesn't behave unseemly it's totally selfless he described it as the nature the same as the nature of an artesian well when you think of martijn well what do you think that thing just doesn't stop pouring out water it bears every situation that you're in it believes all things it's always optimus optimistic it keeps hoping in every situation amen brother larry is that what you said in our men's meeting it doesn't give up it keeps enduring and enduring every difficult it faces it simply never fails it's an artesian well the love of god it just it keeps bubbling this kind of love is something you can show and people will want to listen you know how gossip works right you know how bad how fast bad news travels it seems like everyone likes saying something negative about somebody i'll just say it like this it's their nature it's human love human love is a lesser love just like the prophet taught us hate is just a lesser law you know we look to the more the extremes the hate crimes and the killings but but when you don't go to the extremes it starts out with just in seed form a selfish nature it's a selfish nature and pretty soon you want to be on top and gossip has a way to get you on top because whoever you're gossiping to see you're going to look good in front of them it's like bragging now come on let the let let god speak don't turn this off why turn god off when he's trying to deal with changing your nature he's not wanting to feel bad just one the nature change proverbs 10 verse 12 says hatred stirth up strife but love covereth all sins perfect love covers a multitude of sin because you're caring more about the other person's soul than you are about their mistakes are you with me but hatred or a lesser love kind of wants to stir things up try to get you ever want to get a reaction out of somebody come on now i want to kind of ruffle their father want to see where they go with this but perfect love or just cover you know they came to jesus many times they wanted to trip him find him in a fault stir up some strife they were telling the people they were always trying to get the people against jesus but the love of god will cover a multitude of sins proverbs 17 verse 9 he that covereth a transgression seeketh love now i'm not talking about your own transgression but if you seek to cover somebody else's transgression you are seeking the love of god that's what the bible says but he that repeateth the matter separated very friends you want to talk about something what are you doing you're separating somebody from somebody tell me where god is in that tell me where the holy ghost is in that we have a way to show eternal life and you can't show eternal life when you're talking about others when you're talking about something they did wrong james chapter 5 verse 19 brethren if any of you be if any of you do air from the truth and one converteth him now this this means somebody that was in the truth and they aired from the truth it's not something that wasn't in the truth yet let him know that he which convert the sinner from the air of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins that's what the blood of jesus christ can do and i'll tell you without the blood of christ where would any of us be nobody in this room would want to talk to anybody in this room we would go try to find a church that we'd feel better when and the only way you'd feel better in that church is because you wouldn't know what they did as soon as they found out what you did you understand i'm saying we ought to be rejoicing in the blood of jesus christ that we stand here pure spotless sinness under the blood of jesus christ we should give him glory and we're being taught in the scriptures leave it under the blood don't be talking about your brother don't be talking about your sister say good things if you're having a hard time get the holy ghost i resent that brother john i'm sorry you resent that the holy ghost don't do that for you i say get more of the holy ghost i'm not trying to decipher who has it who doesn't but look god doesn't struggle if we're struggling get more god let's just keep it simple i'm not trying to devalue demoralized make anybody feel like they haven't got it i'm about pointing us to what we can have we can show people we got eternal life you're going to show them you got each other you're just going to show them you're religious when you do that you're not going to show them you got your life you may prove you're right you may prove that somebody else is wrong but you're not proving eternal life you're not showing them eternal life by this show and tell shall all men know you're my disciples showing them how to cover amen what good is love if you can't show it this by far was not supposed to be two services i can't believe the time that has trinkled on by already what good is love if you can't show it what good is love if you can't choose to demonstrate it in front of somebody what good was to say that you have it we've all heard that you can't get warm by a pain of fire you can't feel the warmth of perfect love if it's just quoted if it's just in somebody's head but if perfect love won't be projected then it won't do any good the prophet said when perfect love is projected then sovereign grace takes over not one perfect love is quoted when it's projected when it's lived out when it's demonstrated when it's shown amen it gets the job done and i'll tell you the if you think about the greatest things where god has expressed his love to us is when he has forgiven us of our all of our mess-ups that's it it hasn't been in you know the the the car i got the house i have you know what i mean you want more work more that's all you do you want more work more you don't want to work for you don't get it that's what bible says you don't work you don't eat let's take a look at faith for a second i don't got time to get in to all these scriptures but turn with me to james chapter 2 verse 14. we have to skip some that's my foundation for faith because we talked about living by faith but james believed in show-and-tell with faith and he gives five examples here about showing that telling wasn't good enough james chapter 2 verse 14 what does it profit my brother and do a man say that he have faith and have not works can faith save him that's a good question mark because we would say yes i'm saved by faith the bible says i'm saved by grace through faith if you don't have faith you cannot be saved you've got to believe the gospel but what would it profit if a man says i've got faith but he doesn't have anything to show no show just autel you know it's going to be another boring show and tell if a brother or sister be naked and destitute it gives an example here of of daily food and one of you said to them depart in peace and be warm and filled not withstanding you give them not those things which are needful for the body what does it profit marty brought this out the very last thing in his men's meeting that we need we need to show our love in the natural realm as well and one of you saying to them be part in peace be warm and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things where's your need for the right what does it profit even so now he goes right back to the spiritual even so faith if it have not works is dead being alone so he's not saying in those top two things up there is really examples of faith but it's a natural example but he said even so faith if it doesn't have works is dead being alone so if we can only tell somebody that jesus christ is eternal life but we have no life behind it we have nothing to show no different nature change no living for others no laying down your life no giving of yourself yea a man may say that was faith and have and i have worked he said show me thy faith without thy works you can't and i will show thee my faith by my works brother branham showed us eternal life he showed us what the perfect love was all about thou believers that there is one god thou does well the devils are in the same wavelength as you and they tremble about the situation because they know they're lost they got head knowledge will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead he's bringing that again he's really driving it and he goes to another example was not abraham our father justified by works when it offered up isaac upon the altar remember that god said now i know well he knew before no i want to see it manifested i want to see it manifested show thou how faith wrought his works and by works was faith made perfect love is made complete when you live and the scripture was fulfilled would say if abraham believed god it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god see then how that by works a man is justified not see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only works is required likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she was when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also brother bran said in the message the mark of the beast he says you think you have faith many times when you don't he says you just have hope in other words hope don't have any works faith does faith does james chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of nuts and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls be ye doers of the word and not hearers only what happens if you come to church and you just hear the word and nothing changes that bible says you're deceiving yourself but if any be i hear of the word i say if any maybe you hear the word and not a doer he is like unto a man be holding his natural face in the glass for he beholdeth himself real well when he's looking but then he goes away and he forgets exactly what he looked like when he went to church the conviction that he felt when he was in church you know because i mean let me just say it like this i've had pimples on my face before in fact i'll never forget this you i know y'all had it better than i did when i got married yeah the preacher looked at me and he says can't you do something about that big pimple right between your eyes just before we're going to get married no honestly i didn't mean that in a negative way he met well but how could that be comforting but he meant well i i love it i'll never forget it how many times you look in the mirror and you saw something you didn't like oh man that you just you get away and you forget about it well it wasn't bothering me because i couldn't see it but everybody looking at me could and sometimes we just get out of church because we want to stop looking at the reality of what's happening inside but whosoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty and what continue in other words i'm going to think about what was being preached done i'm going to let it soak in i'm going to let become a part of my life i'm going to let it change me from glory onto glory i'm going to become more in his image i'm getting ready for a rapture because i'm not ready yet that's the perfect law of liberty that's continuing therein being not forgetful here but a doer of the word this man is the man that's going to be blessed in his deed if any man seem to be religious and bridal is not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain now there is a lot of scriptures i've got to bypass and i'm sorry that just the way it is because i got to get to some important stuff but i want to ask you this question today do you have eternal life are you able to manifest it are you of those that have it that don't manifest that don't show it that don't live for others it's a sobering question and more wars have been fought over religion than anything else people will fight defending what they believe in and i'm not here to step on tolls i'm just asking the question are you able to show the eternal life that you have if you have eternal life you must be able to show it to others you can't put in your suitcase put in your wallet take the picture off the wall take the ten commandments out no it's got it's a life how can you hide something that's lived you just can't do it how can you shut up a detection well you just can't do it so if we have eternal life it's our job to manifest it to make sure that it's being demonstrated that you're looking for ways to show it amen find ways to show eternal life without this with a life being lived and it's real easy you don't live for yourself people will see it like crazy give up living for yourself and live for others and then you'll come in continuity what was taught to us turn with me to second corinthians chapter four paul said it like this as you're turning there in first timothy chapter six verse twelve he said fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life they hold i already have it but why is he saying lay hold on it you know if if we took our philosophy as gospel we'd have to throw out scriptures like he that endure to the end throw that one out i got it that's right lay hold on work out your own salvation fear and trembling already got it don't need to work it out second corinthians chapter four verse three but if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not notice who got blinded those that believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who's in the image of god should shine on them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus our lord and ourselves your servants praise god how many wants to be a servant to everybody for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in where are hearts to give the light and knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ now who is he giving this light to that's right the light in you is for others and we're going to see that right here we're going to see eternal life in these scriptures right here but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of ourselves now how do we see this eternal life we are troubled on every side but we're not distressed we are perplexed but we're not in despair we're persecuted but we're not forsaken we're cast down but we're not destroyed so what's really happening here always bearing about in our body eternal life the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body this is how we can declare eternal life this is how eternal life can be manifested in our body if we're willing to die out to our flesh always bearing in our body the dying of the lord i mean jesus was he was dying out in the flesh he prayed i mean he learned obedience by the things he suffered he said father let this be possible that this cup passed for me he was tempted in all measures like we were he battled temptations he battled uh uh being the center of attention his reputation he did when he went on that mountain satan wanted offer him everything this is the way to show eternal life i know if it ain't exciting to me it's like we got a denominational belief of eternal life like no matter what you do down here you're still going there it's not about learning to do your best here it's learning to be so full of the holy ghost that you're actually living for others that you're actually demonstrating getting them to christ a heart a mind a will spending your time doing it forget about the pitfalls forget about how many times you fell just get up and start living for others we'll never make it on well i'm making it to eternal life because i only got these many things wrong it's not all these no we all got they're off we're off the chart man we're off the chart with our things so that has nothing to do with it what has everything to do with it is that you see in the scriptures tonight you see in the message tonight that it is our responsibility to show other people what eternal life is and if that's a struggle get into the message a little bit more start reading this book a little bit differently called the bible all right let's finish two more verses here and then we'll stand for we have lived for we which live are always delivered unto the death for jesus sake why why does that have to happen that the life also of jesus might be manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you you're dying out to your will so other people can can as as as brother branham said to have this or as john said in our opening scripture that they may have fellowship with us and that they may have joy we may have this joy together that's the reason you show eternal life to somebody not to show you've got something they don't to bring them to jesus to bring them to the love of god because if you're gonna if you really are gonna show people you've got something you will be nothing in the showing you will be nothing because all people are going to see is jesus when you get done demonstrating they're not going to say oh wow john that was amazing no they're going to say oh that's jesus that's jesus there's god there's something i've never seen before they're not going to be saying all this johnny god no he's not going to share his glory with anybody so you got to get me out of the picture the eye out of the picture and get christ only always living in
