[0:00] you that
[0:03] we also may have fellowship with us
[0:07] and truly our fellowship is with the
[0:08] father and with the son his son jesus
[0:11] christ
[0:12] and these things we write unto you that
[0:16] your joy may be
[0:17] full amen amen just gonna ask
[0:22] brother ron if he would ask the
[0:23] blessings on the reading of the word
[0:28] today
[0:56] lord
[1:04] amen god bless you may be seated we
[1:07] certainly appreciated
[1:09] um brother ron's
[1:13] great efforts in the worship service
[1:15] today
[1:16] i mean you could just see him doing
[1:19] the job that the holy spirit would
[1:22] lead us to do and to help us all
[1:26] try to get into the spirit because god
[1:28] is a spirit and we need to contact him
[1:30] in the spirit
[1:32] um of course we've all been
[1:36] through tests and trials of some sort
[1:38] and uh if we haven't we're
[1:41] probably are tired i mean there's always
[1:44] something
[1:45] to get us away from entering into the
[1:48] spirit
[1:50] but we must press him
[1:54] and we must get a good ground in order
[1:57] for that word to do us any good amen
[1:59] we know the word's good no matter where
[2:01] it comes from
[2:04] i mean you could just get the bible open
[2:06] it up and read it that word is good
[2:08] but it's got to fall on a good ground
[2:10] amen
[2:12] amen we want to title this showing
[2:14] others eternal life
[2:18] we've been so used to telling people
[2:20] about jesus
[2:24] telling them perhaps about the message
[2:27] but actually showing them it just is
[2:29] kind of opens up a new avenue
[2:32] for us much more challenging
[2:36] but the purpose that we want to share
[2:38] the message with somebody the truth of
[2:40] this
[2:41] word with somebody is that we could
[2:44] spend eternity with them
[2:46] that we could have fellowship with them
[2:48] through eternity
[2:49] that is our purpose and when we do that
[2:53] their joy will become full
[2:57] because in the presence of the lord is
[3:00] the fullness of joy
[3:02] outside of the lord there is no joy
[3:05] there's happiness and it's short-lived
[3:20] brother branham said i would rather
[3:23] someone live
[3:24] me a sermon than to preach me one
[3:28] that was his desire is to see
[3:31] someone live the gospel in front of him
[3:35] and of course when the word is preached
[3:38] we say amen so when we see
[3:40] somebody living the life we should say
[3:42] amen
[3:45] amen to that word and
[3:48] and and shall we say and even in a
[3:50] greater measure
[3:54] because it's harder to live the word
[3:58] showing eternal life or showing the
[4:01] fruit
[4:01] of eternal life is far easier
[4:04] said than done
[4:08] now i'd rather have someone show me
[4:10] eternal life than just tell me about it
[4:16] it is now we've got to find other
[4:18] avenues
[4:20] it forces us our life to become one with
[4:23] the word
[4:25] that we believe just want to say it's
[4:27] come to me like eight times i'm going to
[4:29] say it
[4:29] brother ron's so good to see i want to
[4:31] say amen to what brother
[4:33] ron was saying we certainly miss you
[4:35] when
[4:36] you're not here you're uh
[4:39] a permanent fixture amen
[4:43] amen
[4:46] brother brahm never said eternal life
[4:48] was believing
[4:50] that you have it
[4:53] he never said eternal life was claiming
[4:56] that you have it
[4:58] or even telling other people that they
[5:01] should give their heart to jesus he
[5:02] never said that's what eternal life was
[5:06] he said it's when you're actually living
[5:08] your life for another person's soul
[5:12] he made it real clear but a lot of times
[5:15] we want to make eternal
[5:19] life or our belief of eternal life
[5:21] personal
[5:23] personal definition our personal belief
[5:26] but the scripture is of no private
[5:28] interpretation amen
[5:29] that's why we need the entire bible to
[5:31] understand what
[5:33] perhaps sometimes what one scripture
[5:35] really
[5:37] right means living for
[5:40] others is the result of completely
[5:43] believing
[5:44] christ and following his steps
[5:49] it's a result
[5:53] because eternal life is a free gift most
[5:56] believers feel that it's associated
[5:59] without any kind of responsibility
[6:01] nothing's a nothing you have to do for
[6:04] it because it's free you can't work for
[6:06] it
[6:07] so kind of responsibility goes out the
[6:09] window
[6:12] yet people will fight a war but they
[6:15] won't even think about
[6:17] loving who they're fighting with
[6:22] they will fight to defend their personal
[6:24] belief but they won't fight to lay down
[6:26] their life
[6:29] they're like peter without the holy
[6:30] ghost willing to draw a sword
[6:33] to fight for what they stand for i
[6:34] believe in jesus
[6:37] but jesus said whoa whoa don't do that
[6:39] put the sword up
[6:40] you you you live with the sword you die
[6:43] with the sword
[6:44] we're not of this kingdom here this is
[6:46] not how we do things we're
[6:48] of a different kingdom the kingdom we
[6:50] are live the way we win the war
[6:52] is we lay down our lives for our friends
[6:58] people feel a responsibility to defend
[7:01] their belief
[7:03] and not to win their enemy's soul
[7:07] and we when we're in our flesh we can
[7:08] end up doing the same thing
[7:12] about five years after brother branham
[7:14] went beyond the curtain of time
[7:16] and visited eternity he described
[7:19] what true christianity was and i've read
[7:21] this quote before but
[7:23] again i've decided i want to just take
[7:26] my time
[7:29] i feel if we just say one word that'll
[7:32] help us
[7:34] we've gained something
[7:37] brother branham said in the message a
[7:38] man running from the presence of the
[7:40] lord now
[7:40] brother branham is speaking on a
[7:42] believer's responsibility here
[7:45] he said christianity is an everyday
[7:47] rugged life
[7:49] every day rugged life
[7:53] it's not the end living for god
[7:58] we all have a everyday rugged life
[8:02] but it's usually not living for god it's
[8:05] all the trials we're going through all
[8:06] the
[8:07] things we're we got trying to accomplish
[8:11] but he said it's a a rugged life living
[8:14] for god
[8:15] in this present world
[8:19] so christianity isn't over on the other
[8:21] side it's right here today
[8:25] it's a constant burning of the fire
[8:29] and the love of god in the heart
[8:32] so number one we got to ask the question
[8:35] do we feel
[8:36] a fire burning is it constantly burning
[8:41] that love for that love of god
[8:44] not just love for god but love of god
[8:47] now this is what it'll do
[8:49] it sets you a fire and puts you out
[8:52] yonder with people making converts
[8:56] for christ
[9:00] now i remember selling xango
[9:07] my interest was not to win converts
[9:13] my interest was to get people signed up
[9:16] on xangel
[9:19] sure we want to slide a little bit of
[9:22] the lord in when the opportunity arises
[9:24] but my motive
[9:26] my fire my com my passion was angle
[9:33] and it can be anything right it can be
[9:36] anything
[9:37] we wake up with our goals in life
[9:42] but we ought to be waking up with a fire
[9:44] for converts
[9:47] a love for converts for someone that's
[9:50] not in yet
[9:53] to get to get somebody's nature changed
[9:57] now that's what true christianity is but
[9:59] that is not worldly christianity
[10:02] worldly christianities i'm a methodist
[10:04] i'm a lutheran i'm in the message i'm
[10:06] this
[10:06] i'm that yes i've associated myself with
[10:10] this
[10:11] label it doesn't matter if anything
[10:14] isn't burning in here
[10:16] i love god okay you love god but do you
[10:18] have the love of god
[10:20] amen because we can love god every day
[10:24] and miss it but if you
[10:25] if you have the love of god inside of
[10:27] you it's a burning for converts
[10:32] god didn't say well since i got john
[10:34] martin saved i'm wash my hand i'm all
[10:36] done now i'm not interested no more
[10:38] souls i got john in
[10:43] that's right and sometimes we can have
[10:45] the mentality while we're in we're safe
[10:49] and we miss out on the responsibility
[10:52] that the holy spirit is still moving
[10:57] still moving to get the rest of
[11:01] his family converted
[11:04] the rest of his seed converted they're
[11:06] not in yet
[11:08] that means there's got to be somebody
[11:12] and to go ahead and say well that's
[11:14] really for somebody else to take care of
[11:16] what are you saying to god that you
[11:18] would never go to work and tell your
[11:20] boss i'm not going to do what you tell
[11:21] me to do
[11:24] but i still expect a paycheck from you
[11:28] why would we come to church and hear the
[11:29] word and say that's for somebody else
[11:32] because we're really not taking on the
[11:34] responsibility of christianity
[11:40] so brother branham says responsibilities
[11:46] remember when brother branham says you
[11:47] got to get to the place
[11:49] where you can love everybody even your
[11:52] enemy
[11:54] get to that place get to that spot
[11:59] i think if that we get to that spot
[12:01] we'll automatically care about a soul
[12:06] you won't about to get rid of it
[12:09] that's what true christianity is
[12:13] how many times did we judge somebody
[12:14] because they didn't love us
[12:17] and and they were like a confessed
[12:20] christian
[12:21] they consider themselves a christian and
[12:24] they
[12:25] they didn't love at a certain time and
[12:28] inside you just
[12:29] you just you just judged them that
[12:32] wasn't
[12:33] that's not a christian christians don't
[12:35] do that they don't act like that
[12:40] so we learn not to judge you
[12:47] i might just have the love of god you
[12:49] won't judge
[12:51] it's automatic you don't have to try in
[12:54] fact you lay down your life for the
[12:55] person that's
[12:56] being mean to you
[13:02] and then he shows the contrast of a
[13:05] worldly
[13:06] self-proclaimed christian believer in
[13:09] the rest
[13:09] in this quote here he says but it's easy
[13:13] to go the way the world goes
[13:16] it's easy to flow down the stream just
[13:19] floating with the world
[13:21] easy the way it goes you don't want to
[13:23] do that no sir he says but you must
[13:25] accept your responsibility now
[13:28] of course you got people that won't step
[13:31] foot in the church
[13:34] and i'm not talking about them being
[13:37] the world when god dresses laodicea
[13:40] she's about as worldly as she can be
[13:43] she's so much full of the world that she
[13:46] kicked jesus out of the church and said
[13:48] we'll have church oh we'll have a good
[13:49] time worshiping the lights will go
[13:51] we'll have entertainment we'll have a
[13:53] stage we'll have everything and we don't
[13:55] even need the word
[13:59] so i'm talking about a worldly way of
[14:02] thinking
[14:05] it's easy to be a christian all you have
[14:08] to do is believe
[14:13] isn't it amazing how the angel of the
[14:16] lord told brother brown
[14:17] i like that only belief but yet satan
[14:20] takes that
[14:21] that same word only believe that's all
[14:24] you got to do
[14:30] a christian i only i believe
[14:33] he says no sir but you must accept
[14:37] your responsibility so there comes a
[14:39] responsibility
[14:41] with being a christian with being a
[14:44] believer there's a responsibility
[14:46] everybody you marry there's a
[14:48] responsibility every house
[14:49] you buy there's a responsibility you pay
[14:52] the taxes you cut the grass
[14:54] every job you work there's a
[14:56] responsibility
[14:58] to every believer there's a
[14:59] responsibility
[15:01] the only time there's no responsibility
[15:03] in a person's life is the spirit
[15:06] of i'm going to do what i want to do and
[15:07] that's the nature that you're born with
[15:09] i'm not going to listen to my parents
[15:10] i'm not going to when i get older i'm
[15:12] not going to do that i'm just going to
[15:14] i want to go live off the grid
[15:17] right i don't want to be accountable to
[15:20] anybody
[15:21] the whole world's just a crazy mess
[15:27] so satan has taught us to be our own god
[15:29] because there's no responsibility in
[15:31] that
[15:35] brother branham is describing the
[15:37] worldly view of christianity is easy
[15:39] it's without responsibility to make
[15:41] converts
[15:42] there simply isn't enough love burning
[15:45] inside their heart enough holy ghost to
[15:49] put them out yonder
[15:50] their heart is not set on fire for the
[15:53] lost
[15:55] and i'm i'm just going to say this here
[15:57] saying says you're sitting here
[15:58] i know that you know these quotes and i
[16:00] know that you believe the quotes
[16:02] but i need you to take the next step
[16:04] take inventory
[16:06] because unless inventory is taken you're
[16:08] not going to say lord i want that fire
[16:12] and this is not just something that we
[16:13] want to go home and say lord
[16:15] you know give me add to our prayer
[16:17] request lord give me some more fire
[16:20] we're talking about a whole change we're
[16:23] talking about an everyday rugged life
[16:26] i mean this challenge is so much it
[16:28] challenges me
[16:30] i'm far from where i need to be with
[16:32] this word
[16:36] the man says now you believe it you
[16:38] think it's the truth
[16:40] and the responsibility that god has
[16:42] given us in this day
[16:45] is to bring this message
[16:53] so when's the last time you brought the
[16:55] message to somebody
[17:01] when's the last time you felt that love
[17:03] of god burning
[17:06] you know this message is actually about
[17:08] a quarter of everything that i had
[17:10] written down and i don't think i'm going
[17:11] to get through this quarter because i
[17:12] have decided to take my time
[17:19] that burning is really not you
[17:22] or your thoughts
[17:26] it's something that's been invited
[17:28] inside of your heart
[17:30] in it controls your vessel
[17:33] brother branham taught us if the spirit
[17:35] of beethoven lived in you
[17:38] then you would begin to play
[17:41] like beethoven
[17:45] and then if the spirit of rembrandt was
[17:47] in you begin to
[17:49] to paint like rembrandt so if the
[17:52] spirit of christ is inside of
[17:55] us it will have a burning
[18:00] when jesus looked upon the multitudes
[18:03] he was moved with compassion because he
[18:06] saw them as
[18:07] sheep having no shepherd
[18:11] there was a burning the love of god in
[18:13] his heart that's what compassion
[18:15] is he said as i get older
[18:20] and i know my days are shortening up he
[18:23] says i feel
[18:25] the responsibility greater than i've
[18:28] ever felt and i want you to think about
[18:29] this
[18:30] the older you get the more responsible
[18:36] how do we think in the world the older
[18:38] we get the quicker we retire
[18:42] how many is that like want to retire
[18:43] from this christianity thing
[18:49] it's supposed to take us out of here
[18:53] pressing on he said we must do it
[18:57] we must get down to it everywhere we go
[18:59] tell the message and tell the people
[19:01] that jesus christ is coming amen
[19:05] and that he's god and he's coming soon
[19:09] and there's not a hope left in the world
[19:11] but the coming
[19:12] of the lord
[19:17] so does it really matter
[19:20] who gets in the office
[19:26] i'm not inviting the wrong person in the
[19:28] office and we need to pray for the right
[19:31] people in the office but our hope is in
[19:34] the coming of the lord
[19:38] i just i don't know what it was i think
[19:39] his brother mike he sent me a
[19:41] video and wanted me to watch and i began
[19:43] to to watch it and
[19:44] i don't know maybe it wasn't you no but
[19:47] i was watching the video and this
[19:49] man was just preaching at all the the
[19:52] the the things that the world is doing
[19:54] in the political realms
[19:55] and it was wrong and it's bad and we see
[19:58] satan is in it
[20:03] and we couldn't have all that knowledge
[20:06] of the right
[20:07] and wrong but we need
[20:10] christ on the inside saving souls
[20:14] we need that
[20:17] and any time that you
[20:21] you kind of push it off on the person
[20:23] next to you
[20:27] what are you telling god you're pushing
[20:29] off the responsibility that god
[20:32] is speaking to you
[20:36] when brother branham said eternal life
[20:38] was living for others he never meant
[20:39] doing things for others or just simply
[20:41] being kind to others
[20:44] he meant that when you actually are
[20:46] possessed of it
[20:48] then god gives you a responsibility
[20:51] and your duty bound by god to carry it
[20:53] out
[20:55] paul talked about it in second
[20:56] corinthians chapter five about a
[20:58] ministry a reconciliation that he gives
[21:00] us
[21:01] and it isn't just to restore our own
[21:03] life
[21:04] got this minister i'm going to restore
[21:06] my own life i'm going to make it a great
[21:07] life
[21:11] i'm going to have so much when i'm done
[21:13] with my life
[21:15] it's not about our life brother said the
[21:18] gift is for the other person
[21:20] it's not for ourselves it's for others
[21:25] possessing eternal life ought to make
[21:28] every believer feel
[21:30] so grateful and so unworthy of it
[21:34] that it's easy for god to move us out
[21:37] yonder winning souls for christ
[21:41] but if you don't feel grateful enough
[21:43] you don't feel
[21:44] unworthy then you'll just
[21:48] give to god what's god
[21:52] caesar's with caesar's and i'll take the
[21:55] rest of it
[21:59] i'll give god my time on sunday i'll
[22:01] give him my ties
[22:03] i'll give caesar my taxes
[22:07] my life's my life yes sir
[22:11] is it i thought he bought it at calvary
[22:17] no john he just bought my soul not my
[22:20] body
[22:24] where do you get that scripture
[22:28] know ye not that your temple is the
[22:31] temple of the holy ghost
[22:35] you're bought with a price
[22:39] are we letting god use it
[22:46] god gives the converted believer
[22:49] the responsibility in his own
[22:53] ministry to get the rest of the family
[22:55] together now notice it's not our
[22:57] ministry it's god's
[23:00] he just puts us in his ministry
[23:04] we're just doing what he is doing
[23:07] we're letting him use our vessel kind of
[23:09] like the most
[23:10] uh subtle beast lent himself over to the
[23:14] devil said yeah you can use me
[23:17] we let lend ourself over to god and let
[23:20] him use us
[23:22] beyond our understanding beyond our
[23:24] thinking beyond our feelings our wants
[23:28] and it cannot be accomplished and unless
[23:30] there's a true
[23:31] dying out learning how to die out to the
[23:33] flesh because the flesh ain't going to
[23:34] want to do he's never going to want to
[23:36] do it
[23:42] if you're only willing to fight someone
[23:44] about your belief
[23:46] and not show them eternal life i think
[23:49] it's time to get back
[23:51] to the altar
[23:54] say god fill me with love for others
[23:58] it's you know it's so easy to fight for
[24:00] something you believe
[24:02] just let somebody cross you one time
[24:09] but it's hard when they cross you to
[24:11] love them
[24:14] but how else are we going to show
[24:15] eternal life to somebody
[24:20] anybody can love them that love you

[24:25] i mean i love brother jason gave me a
[24:27] hat love brother
[24:31] but mark love the person talking about
[24:33] me
[24:35] i mean really love them not just endure
[24:38] their presence but i mean
[24:42] really love them really care about them
[24:46] that's a responsibility to the christian
[24:54] receiving the truth of eternal life will
[24:56] always be accompanied with the
[24:58] responsibility of
[24:59] showing others eternal life
[25:03] to me light shines the greatest during
[25:05] the darkness
[25:08] and if somebody's being completely dark
[25:09] to you completely bad completely mean
[25:12] completely turn offish
[25:14] completely selfish that's the time
[25:17] to really show forth the greatest light
[25:19] because there's so much darkness
[25:23] but that's the time that's the hardest
[25:25] for the flesh
[25:29] because the flesh is just wanting a war
[25:30] against that one to prove the wrong you
[25:32] shouldn't be at
[25:32] you shouldn't you know what don't you
[25:34] know the scripture
[25:37] and before you know it all you're doing
[25:39] is
[25:40] telling them eternal life
[25:45] instead of showing them because remember
[25:47] the letter's gonna kill somebody
[25:50] it's the spirit it's the life that will
[25:53] bring forth life
[25:54] right see the devil uses the word
[25:58] what's he do with it does the same thing
[26:00] to me as he does to all of you which i
[26:02] know he condemns me he must condemn you
[26:05] and he uses the word he doesn't use his
[26:08] own
[26:09] thinking
[26:19] it's hard to receive all the truth
[26:22] that's why jesus said if you can receive
[26:25] it
[26:25] remember he said those words if you can
[26:27] receive it
[26:29] because most people cannot receive all
[26:30] of god's word it's strong
[26:33] jesus said i have many things to say and
[26:35] you but you can't
[26:37] bear it now you've got to wait to there
[26:39] i'm inside of you
[26:42] kind of controlling all the towers right
[26:46] because after the spirit's inside then
[26:48] he can continue to lead and guide you
[26:50] into all truth
[26:51] now if you think about this we know that
[26:54] jesus christ
[26:55] is the way the truth and the life so
[26:56] what else is there to know
[27:00] we know the message of the hour is true
[27:02] and william branham was the messenger of
[27:03] the seventh so what else whether the
[27:04] truth is there
[27:10] think about that
[27:14] our vessels are not totally
[27:18] operating by god
[27:22] and we need all the truth you shall know
[27:25] the truth and the true shall make you
[27:27] free
[27:30] well i've received it i received it i
[27:32] accepted jesus
[27:33] as my savior no he was talking to the
[27:36] jews that believed on him
[27:39] he said if you continue in my word then
[27:42] are you my disciples indeed
[27:44] so there's a continuation
[27:50] there's a continued unfolding of the of
[27:52] the revelation of this word
[27:56] we know the mind of of god is wanting us
[27:58] to move forward
[28:00] into more truth and the devil is
[28:02] continuously trying to convince us
[28:05] that we have enough
[28:08] we have enough responsibility is that
[28:11] true
[28:13] so we we don't mind more of god as long
[28:16] as it's up here
[28:18] knowledge give it to me
[28:22] i want to get dizzy
[28:25] about my head spinning i want to look at
[28:28] things i've never looked at before
[28:31] but where's the life that i want to live
[28:33] that i've never lived before
[28:35] where's that where's that love of god
[28:38] inside
[28:39] see it's always associated with
[28:41] responsibility and the devil is
[28:43] constantly
[28:44] trying to convince us that you have
[28:46] enough responsibility
[28:51] that's why most believers are interested
[28:53] in hearing the word
[28:54] without responsibility
[28:57] they don't mind saying amen to the word
[29:00] where they don't have to do anything
[29:04] jesus says amen
[29:09] jesus not for you amen
[29:14] you ought to lay down your life for one
[29:15] another
[29:17] he always preaches that
[29:20] when's he going to get off the ash heap
[29:27] because it's associated with
[29:28] responsibility
[29:30] and it's easy to sit and hear the word
[29:34] that seems like it doesn't have a
[29:38] responsibility
[29:42] but god inside of us
[29:48] will carry out the work of god
[29:55] so what is the work we should be doing
[30:01] well brother john that's why we come
[30:02] here we come here to find out well
[30:04] eternal life is living for others
[30:12] the fact remains that truth that god
[30:15] wants us to share
[30:17] with others takes responsibility
[30:23] and we can't leave it up
[30:27] to just our mind knowing but our life
[30:31] doing amen if our flesh has
[30:35] anything to do with making the decision
[30:36] we want the easy peasy way
[30:38] smith's wigglesworth said this statement
[30:40] he said that with every
[30:42] revelation comes a responsibility
[30:47] now i love this quote because it forces
[30:50] us to do something with every word that
[30:53] we hear
[30:56] we got to do something with it amen
[31:01] did you ever like know that you
[31:05] you were going to have to do something
[31:06] but you figured well if i don't know
[31:09] about that i'm not responsible for it
[31:12] come on you know what i'm talking about
[31:14] and so you kind of avoid certain things
[31:17] because you know there's a
[31:18] responsibility with knowing something
[31:22] and every time god speaks something to
[31:24] us
[31:25] god expects us to take responsibility
[31:29] with what he told us
[31:31] just like you said in the great
[31:32] commission whatsoever
[31:34] i've commanded you teach it to others
[31:38] there's a responsibility that comes with
[31:40] that
[31:41] amen the knowledge of truth comes
[31:48] without responsibility but the
[31:51] revelation of truth
[31:52] comes with responsibility see the
[31:55] difference there
[31:56] jesus said in the last sermon before he
[32:00] left
[32:00] his chosen disciples he they carried out
[32:03] his commission he said
[32:05] go ye therefore that's matthew 28 19 if
[32:08] you want to write down go ye therefore
[32:10] and teach
[32:11] all nations baptizing them in the
[32:14] only name that's given among men whereby
[32:18] we must be saved
[32:20] the name of jesus christ is the name of
[32:22] the father it's the name of the son and
[32:24] it's the name of the holy ghost
[32:29] a man once said and i don't know him as
[32:32] i tell you his name
[32:33] but he said preach the gospel always
[32:37] and when absolutely necessary use words
[32:45] in other words you can preach the gospel
[32:47] with your life
[32:49] you can display eternal life to others
[32:52] how do you do it you become the word
[32:56] you can't get warm by a pain to fire you
[32:58] can't
[33:01] play with it you have to become it
[33:05] and then it's just natural then you're
[33:07] just instant in season out of season
[33:12] you show them with your life you teach
[33:14] them eternal
[33:16] life verse 20 teaching them to observe
[33:19] all things whatsoever i've commanded you
[33:21] law
[33:21] and with you always even to the end of
[33:24] the world
[33:26] god commanded us to lay down our lives
[33:29] for others
[33:32] so we must be about the father's
[33:33] business
[33:35] saving as many souls as possible because
[33:37] that's what he said here
[33:39] teaching them to observe all things
[33:41] whatsoever
[33:42] i've commanded you
[33:46] you ought to better write a list of
[33:49] x what 100 things that god commands you
[33:52] to do
[33:53] that be safe that's what you should be
[33:58] teaching others well they don't want to
[34:01] hear it
[34:02] is that what he said
[34:06] i'll tell you when the gospel was
[34:07] preached to me i wasn't standing on the
[34:09] front line saying
[34:10] i want here
[34:13] i didn't want somebody telling me i
[34:15] couldn't smoke my dope and drink my beer
[34:21] telling me i had i had to give up
[34:24] my my music i wasn't sitting there
[34:28] waiting for that i wanted to do what i
[34:30] wanted to do but the gospel was preached
[34:33] to me
[34:36] so don't wait for somebody that wants to
[34:38] hear it don't wait for the open door
[34:40] you've got the commission
[34:42] what do you need the open door for when
[34:43] you got the commission
[34:46] well you know they're going to get mad
[34:48] at me if i just do that
[34:51] you mean the same thing's going to
[34:53] happen to you that happened to paul
[34:55] and peter and the persecutions of all
[34:58] the
[34:58] apostles in the book of acts
[35:02] you mean you might lose their friendship
[35:06] stay friends with them all your life and
[35:07] find out where that gets you at the end
[35:12] your friendship is not more powerful
[35:14] than the gospel they need the gospel
[35:17] hey i i'm they're not all going to come
[35:25] but we got to do it to every creature
[35:28] whether he comes or
[35:29] it come amen
[35:33] as you lay down your life for someone
[35:35] else's life you're actually displaying
[35:37] eternal life think about that statement
[35:42] you're willing to give up friendship
[35:46] you're willing to give up your image and
[35:48] your
[35:49] how you look in front of somebody to get
[35:52] christ to them you're actually
[35:54] displaying eternal life
[36:00] when the spirit of truth shall come he
[36:02] will lead and guide you into all truth
[36:06] the bible says they that are sons of god
[36:08] are led by the spirit of god so we
[36:09] believe in the leadership of the holy
[36:11] spirit
[36:13] if the jesus the holy ghost
[36:17] inside of us
[36:20] is leading us he's leading us
[36:23] to teach all things
[36:27] that god has commanded us to observe
[36:30] all things he's leading us to teach that
[36:35] to others
[36:36] because that's what he commissioned them
[36:38] to do and it wasn't just for another age
[36:41] that's just as bad as
[36:42] people believing that jesus doesn't heal
[36:47] that jesus isn't as miraculous as he
[36:49] once was
[36:51] he is the same yesterday to him well his
[36:53] word is the same
[36:54] yesterday today and forever and he's
[36:57] still
[36:57] he's still calling us he's still leading
[37:00] us today
[37:01] in this church right now i believe
[37:04] what's on the mind of god
[37:05] is that he wants us to get out there and
[37:07] tell others about jesus
[37:11] display it with your life
[37:14] find a way to lay down your life when
[37:16] somebody looks at you they go wow
[37:18] that was not a normal thing
[37:24] you know there used to be some shows i
[37:26] don't know if they're still on tv but
[37:27] you know
[37:28] like odd things weird things like
[37:32] i don't know just i can't remember where
[37:34] they're just eating eyeballs or
[37:36] something
[37:39] just like weird stuff
[37:43] and it's weird when somebody don't care
[37:45] about themselves they just care about
[37:47] yourself
[37:47] somebody else's soul
[37:50] that's not the norm
[37:56] brother smith remember brother smith
[37:59] with every revelation comes a
[38:01] responsibility
[38:02] i say with every true revelation of
[38:04] eternal life comes
[38:06] a responsibility a false conception a
[38:09] false understanding
[38:15] always comes without responsibility
[38:17] because the devil doesn't want you to do
[38:19] anything
[38:20] and that's why i say if you can receive
[38:22] it that's why jesus said he that has
[38:24] ears
[38:25] to hear let him hear what the spirit is
[38:27] saying
[38:28] now we hear brother john martin up here
[38:31] talking
[38:32] he's bringing some some points i mean
[38:34] from everything that i'm hearing
[38:36] people in the church are saying amen to
[38:37] the word it's probably the truth that
[38:39] i'm hearing
[38:41] is that a good way of saying that but
[38:44] are you hearing what the spirit is
[38:45] saying
[38:46] to your heart that something dealing
[38:49] inside here the realness
[38:52] that's god with you on an individual
[38:55] basis
[38:56] and that's so by far more important than
[38:59] the words that you're hearing out of my
[39:00] mouth falling in your ears
[39:03] i want to talk a little bit about
[39:05] eternal life last wednesday night i
[39:07] asked the question do you have eternal
[39:09] life
[39:12] and i know most of us felt
[39:17] so offended by that statement
[39:19] [Laughter]
[39:24] and i am not questioning whether you
[39:27] have eternal life
[39:37] jesus never did say the words
[39:40] eternal life is living for others he
[39:42] never said those words
[39:47] or did he
[39:50] or did he let's see here let's turn to
[39:53] john chapter 5 verse 39 we're talking
[39:56] about eternal life for just
[39:57] a little bit here
[40:01] john 5 39 search
[40:05] the scriptures for in them
[40:09] you think you have eternal life
[40:13] but they are they which testify of me
[40:19] so is there a part of eternal life that
[40:21] i'm not living or maybe i'm just
[40:22] missing missing something in my walk
[40:27] that's what i'm trying to get to with
[40:28] this this statement
[40:32] in other words many people think they
[40:33] have it a good trick that
[40:35] satan has placed on many believers is
[40:39] that he convinces them that they have it
[40:42] what happens if if you have your your
[40:45] keys
[40:45] to your car in your pocket
[40:49] there is no need to go searching for
[40:51] them because you have them
[40:54] but what happens brother mark if you
[40:56] lose your keys at our house
[41:00] you go looking for it satan don't want
[41:03] you looking for god
[41:04] doesn't want you looking for eternal
[41:06] life he wants you sitting in that seat
[41:09] so strongly religiously willing to fight
[41:14] to that you have eternal life that you
[41:17] won't go looking for
[41:20] that there's things that are associated
[41:22] with eternal life a responsibility that
[41:25] comes with it
[41:28] the scripture tells us a certain truth
[41:32] about eternal life
[41:34] but yet there's a mystery in this
[41:36] because he said he hid it from the wise
[41:38] and prudent
[41:39] but reveals these truths to who
[41:43] is interested in a real relationship
[41:46] with him
[41:47] there's the difference if you just want
[41:50] eternal life you're in trouble
[41:54] but if you want a relationship with god
[41:57] god's all ears
[42:00] seek and you shall find knock and it
[42:02] shall be open
[42:04] god is here for those that want him
[42:08] but just eternal life without the
[42:12] relationship
[42:14] god doesn't look favorably on that and i
[42:17] know we all start like that and i did
[42:19] i honestly did not want to go to hell
[42:25] but that changes
[42:32] he will lead you to see
[42:36] that he loves you amen
[42:40] that he actually lived for you and died
[42:43] for you
[42:45] and if that same god is inside of us
[42:47] we'll
[42:48] show calvary to somebody else
[42:52] a crucified life
[42:55] is that what paul said i'm crucified
[42:58] with christ
[42:59] i die daily that other people can see
[43:02] the true life of christ in me
[43:06] wow i love the word
[43:10] probably by far the most quoted
[43:13] scripture in the bible probably by far
[43:16] the most
[43:17] mis interpreted as well john
[43:20] 3 15 and 16 that whosoever believeth in
[43:24] him should not perish but have
[43:26] eternal life for god so loved the world
[43:29] that he gave his only begotten son
[43:31] that whosoever believeth in him should
[43:33] not perish but have
[43:35] everlasting life
[43:39] worldly believers or self-proclaimed
[43:41] christians
[43:42] say they believe
[43:46] they'll take that scripture and they'll
[43:47] say it right there i believe
[43:50] i'm saved
[43:54] but does that give them eternal life
[43:58] just because they say believe then why
[44:01] does it
[44:02] seem to give us the right to think we
[44:05] have eternal life because we say we
[44:07] believe
[44:10] the devils believe in tremble
[44:13] because they know they're accurate in
[44:15] their understanding of truth
[44:18] but yet it's not enough to give them
[44:20] eternal life
[44:21] or else should be no need to tremble
[44:24] right perfect love we stand on the day
[44:27] of judgment
[44:28] without fear
[44:32] because that perfect love cast out all
[44:34] fear they do not perfectly love god
[44:36] yet they believe
[44:42] i believe the reason that this is the
[44:44] most
[44:45] misunderstood or misinterpreted is
[44:48] because people usually stop
[44:49] right here when they're searching the
[44:52] scriptures to know whether they got
[44:53] eternal life
[44:54] they stop right here they they're
[44:56] shallow
[45:01] but you know jesus never said
[45:05] search john 3 16.
[45:10] he says he didn't say search the
[45:12] scripture
[45:14] he said search the scriptures
[45:19] they're told to believe and it's easy to
[45:21] believe
[45:22] but what people really need is to be
[45:25] taught
[45:26] how to believe how to believe
[45:31] it's simple to only believe but it needs
[45:33] to be a complete
[45:35] belief and they're making it a partial
[45:38] belief
[45:39] we actually need all the scriptures to
[45:42] get a true
[45:42] clear understanding of what it means
[45:48] really of all of all of all subjects
[45:52] but we need the entire bible to
[45:54] understand
[45:56] the full complete meaning of eternal
[45:59] life and what it means to be saved
[46:02] now i'll say like this if you only got a
[46:05] few minutes before you
[46:06] are going to die and you accept jesus
[46:09] christ as your savior and you mean it
[46:11] from the bottom of your heart
[46:12] you're saved
[46:16] but god gives you another day he expects
[46:19] you to walk in that word
[46:24] that's just the relationship part
[46:28] all right john 7 38
[46:32] and we're going to just get a little bit
[46:33] more in the scriptures about this
[46:37] he that believeth on me
[46:40] as the scriptures have said out of his
[46:42] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[46:46] now the devils don't have living water
[46:48] flowing out of them
[46:51] and yet they believe so they must not be
[46:54] believing
[46:54] as the scriptures have taught
[47:00] how many times have we talked to someone
[47:02] that believes they say they believe
[47:04] and yet we see something else flowing
[47:06] out of them
[47:08] like you want to you know what i got to
[47:10] get up this i feel uncomfortable i got
[47:11] to get out of this conversation
[47:13] you know what i'm saying but yep they're
[47:15] a believer
[47:19] i mean god jesus the one that told us
[47:24] that he died for us said if we believe
[47:27] properly
[47:28] there's something going to be flowing
[47:29] out of our life
[47:32] it's true
[47:35] james chapter 3 verse 11 doth
[47:39] a fountain sent forth at the same place
[47:41] sweet water and bitter
[47:46] all right i want to answer
[47:50] you're wasting my time up here
[47:54] amen therewith
[47:59] bless we god even the father and
[48:01] therewith curse we men
[48:04] which are made after the similitude of
[48:06] god made in his image
[48:09] out of the same mouth proceed blessings
[48:12] and cursing my brethren
[48:14] these things ought not to be
[48:22] so out of his belly is going to flow
[48:24] rivers of living water
[48:26] not a dead system
[48:30] a living water the scriptures give us
[48:33] understanding of how to believe
[48:36] without the scriptures we don't know how
[48:39] to believe
[48:40] we know to believe the word but we don't
[48:42] know how to believe it
[48:44] we don't know really what it means
[48:46] without those scriptures we don't know
[48:47] how to worship
[48:50] jesus said you don't even know what you
[48:53] worship
[48:53] you don't even know what you're
[48:55] worshiping you don't know how to worship
[49:00] but yet people are worshiping all over
[49:01] the world
[49:08] golf golf
[49:12] worshiping everything in anything
[49:15] worshipping the bottle
[49:19] going to church sitting down
[49:23] and hearing
[49:27] the same old thing over and over and
[49:29] over
[49:36] and they think they're work i'm going to
[49:38] the house of worship
[49:42] but they don't know what they're
[49:43] worshiping god is a spirit
[49:47] they that worship him must get out of
[49:49] the flesh
[49:52] get out of the carnality get out of the
[49:55] i don't feel like
[49:57] and get into the spirit get into the
[50:00] presence of jehovah
[50:03] get into where isaiah was feeling
[50:06] unworthy to be in his house
[50:08] unworthy to hear his word
[50:12] unworthy that he would come down and
[50:15] share his heart with me
[50:19] that's the spirit we need to be in to
[50:21] properly worship
[50:25] and the correct belief is the same way
[50:28] when we believe according to the true
[50:29] scriptures
[50:30] then out of our personal life will flow
[50:32] rivers
[50:33] of love joy
[50:36] peace long suffering gentleness his
[50:39] temperance faith
[50:41] that's what flows out of our life
[50:47] rivers of living water
[50:51] you know who drinks the thirsty
[50:55] you know somebody's acting like a devil
[50:58] acting bad i mean you know just being
[51:02] mean to you
[51:04] you know they're thirsty
[51:08] they're thirsty if they had what you had
[51:12] they would never be doing it
[51:17] but if you don't show them love at that
[51:20] moment
[51:23] you're not going to be long-suffering
[51:24] with them at that moment they're not
[51:26] going to know you got anything
[51:31] he that believeth on me as the
[51:33] scriptures have said out of his belly
[51:36] shall flow rivers
[51:38] so we got to do more than believe like
[51:39] the devils believe
[51:41] we've got to have that life flowing from
[51:43] us amen
[51:46] what else does the bible say about
[51:48] eternal life
[51:49] saint john chapter 6 verse 54
[51:53] whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh
[51:56] my blood
[51:57] have eternal life and i will raise them
[52:00] up
[52:00] at the last i think in our bible study
[52:02] last week someone had
[52:04] asked maybe either asked about or
[52:06] somehow we read that scripture
[52:09] and this is a this is a real hard one
[52:12] this is
[52:12] this is no saint john 3 16 scripture who
[52:18] so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[52:21] have eternal life and i will raise them
[52:23] up at the last day
[52:24] brother john is it possible that jesus
[52:26] was kind of giving us an either or
[52:28] you know you either believe and you're
[52:30] saved or you know eat my flesh and drink
[52:33] my blood you're saved
[52:34] no it's the same thing
[52:37] we're just understanding what it means
[52:39] how to believe
[52:41] how to believe we got to eat something
[52:44] got to eat his flesh he's going to drink
[52:47] his blood
[52:50] wow that's crazy how do we do that he
[52:54] died a long time ago
[52:58] it's a whole lot more than just
[53:00] believing
[53:02] oh jesus said in saint john chapter 6
[53:04] verse 51
[53:05] he said i am the living bread
[53:10] which came down from heaven if any man
[53:12] eat this bread
[53:14] he shall live forever and the bread that
[53:17] i
[53:17] give him is my flesh
[53:21] which i give for the life of the world
[53:26] so now we've got to eat his
[53:29] flesh
[53:32] brother john you better break this down
[53:35] because currently
[53:36] i ain't getting it
[53:40] well during jesus day they weren't
[53:42] getting it either
[53:45] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23
[53:47] for i have received of the lord
[53:49] that which also i delivered unto you
[53:51] that the lord the same night
[53:53] in which he was betrayed he took bread
[53:57] and when he gave fakes he'd break it and
[53:59] said take eat
[54:00] this is my body which is broken for you
[54:04] do this in remembrance of me
[54:10] wow was he was he meaning communion
[54:13] just take communion there are churches
[54:15] out there that believe
[54:17] when you take communion you're actually
[54:19] taking the body of christ did you know
[54:20] that
[54:22] it's a very very carnal understanding
[54:25] of what jesus is asking us
[54:31] in the prayer that jesus taught his
[54:33] disciples in matthew chapter 6 verse 11
[54:35] he uses these words how we ought to pray
[54:37] give us this day
[54:39] our daily bread but we know it can't be
[54:42] natural bread
[54:43] because he he told us take no thought of
[54:45] what you eat
[54:49] so this is a spiritual bread and his
[54:52] and the bread of god is his flesh and we
[54:55] can eat it every day
[54:57] we need to eat it every day man shall
[55:00] not live by bread alone
[55:01] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[55:03] the mouth of god
[55:06] whosoever eateth my flesh is actually
[55:09] eating the bible
[55:11] the word of god the bread of life you're
[55:14] eating
[55:15] when you take this word into your life
[55:18] and say
[55:19] i want to live this word
[55:23] you're actually eating jesus christ
[55:29] now if you think you're completely in
[55:30] the image of god
[55:33] then you don't need to read the bible
[55:34] anymore
[55:40] and if you're not reading this awful
[55:42] quiet if you're not reading the bible
[55:45] because you want to become him
[55:48] then we need to put the bible down and
[55:50] pray until we feel that way
[55:52] and then pick it up and read it because
[55:54] we should always be at a place of i need
[55:57] more
[55:57] i need to press in it's a spirit
[56:02] you know we've made it all intellectual
[56:04] and all knowledge and
[56:06] and and we can know all mysteries and
[56:08] know everything the prophet had to say
[56:12] and still not have charity which is
[56:16] i want to be what christ is i want to be
[56:19] what christ
[56:20] is
[56:23] i want to live eternal life
[56:29] you know we see through a glass darkly
[56:30] but we're coming to church so we can see
[56:32] more clearly
[56:34] that's why we come to know how to
[56:36] believe
[56:37] to find out where we're at
[56:45] the entire word of god must be consumed
[56:49] remember the token
[56:52] god told moses don't leave anything for
[56:54] the morning
[56:56] there is no hour after this hour the
[56:59] token
[57:00] for this hour is the complete word of
[57:02] god we are not living in justification
[57:04] we're not living
[57:05] in the age of sanctification we're
[57:09] living in the hour that
[57:10] the bride will become the manifested
[57:13] sons
[57:13] and daughters of god
[57:17] and i'll be honest with you that was the
[57:20] scripture that i started with last week
[57:22] for today's message and it is so far
[57:26] from that i had to just like
[57:30] take it off this whole thing that the
[57:33] whole earth is groaning
[57:34] is waiting for that hour that will
[57:36] become manifested we're living in that
[57:38] hour
[57:39] hour is not for another time
[57:42] the word has come to restore us
[57:46] and it's it's not waiting for us to
[57:49] become scholars
[57:51] with degrees full understandings of of
[57:56] of what we say the message is but
[57:58] it's a manifestation that they're
[57:59] looking for
[58:08] we're not only to eat this bread but
[58:11] ecclesiastes chapter 11 verse 1 says
[58:13] cast thy bread
[58:15] upon the water for thou shall find it
[58:18] after many days give a portion to
[58:22] seven and also to eight for thou knowest
[58:24] not
[58:25] what evil shall be upon the earth so
[58:28] when's the last time you went out
[58:30] and gave the word to eight people
[58:35] well brother john i didn't come to
[58:38] church
[58:39] to have you preach that to me
[58:44] and if you stay in the scripture very
[58:46] long i'm going to go out of here
[58:48] with my countenance sad
[58:54] thinking it was another bad service
[59:01] come on you've got to fight the flesh
[59:05] when you're challenged with the word the
[59:08] flesh isn't ever going to be
[59:09] you know so good that it did it
[59:12] so you don't listen to the flesh you
[59:15] just say lord i just heard from you
[59:17] you want me to go out you're reminding
[59:19] me you're bringing things to my
[59:20] remembrance of what you want me to do
[59:22] you're stirring my mind up by a way of
[59:24] remembering
[59:24] i've got to give this word out to eight
[59:26] people give it to seven and then to
[59:28] eight
[59:31] this is showing eternal life
[59:36] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[59:38] blood
[59:39] have eternal life the words that i speak
[59:41] unto you they are spirit
[59:43] in their life the bible left alone
[59:46] in word form is of no prophet the bible
[59:49] says the letter killeth
[59:51] but the spirit of the word is the holy
[59:54] ghost which gives us life
[59:57] and we as as we believe the word of god
[1:00:01] and it becomes real to us it will become
[1:00:04] manifested
[1:00:05] inside of us i'll say it like this
[1:00:08] we're here getting more than information
[1:00:12] we could be here just getting
[1:00:13] information but we could be here
[1:00:16] desiring the word to come real to us and
[1:00:18] come inside which is the holy ghost
[1:00:21] in spirit form it's the word of god in
[1:00:23] spirit form
[1:00:26] did you know that jesus had a split in
[1:00:28] his church
[1:00:31] when he was when he walked he had a
[1:00:32] church and believe it or not
[1:00:35] jesus had a split in his church and the
[1:00:38] majority of the people
[1:00:40] left it wasn't split down the middle
[1:00:44] but the majority left and you could read
[1:00:46] all about it in st john chapter six
[1:00:51] so he and they all left he turned
[1:00:54] towards his
[1:00:56] his 12 chosen disciples and he said
[1:01:00] are you going to leave too now why did
[1:01:04] they leave why was there a split in the
[1:01:05] church
[1:01:07] because he began preaching what it means
[1:01:11] to believe
[1:01:17] what it means to have eternal life
[1:01:21] and it became harder and stronger and
[1:01:23] they didn't want to hear it
[1:01:25] and they left and he was he was just
[1:01:28] like
[1:01:30] he turns he says are you going to leave
[1:01:32] also
[1:01:34] and then peter said to whom shall we go
[1:01:39] thou alone has the words of eternal life
[1:01:47] people don't mind going to church if
[1:01:49] they're getting what they want
[1:01:54] how many times you talk to somebody you
[1:01:55] ask them why they go to the church they
[1:01:58] go to
[1:02:00] what they like about the church and they
[1:02:03] will
[1:02:03] never tell you because the word of god
[1:02:07] the revelation of the word of god is
[1:02:09] setting me free they'll never say that
[1:02:13] it's all about how appealing it is to
[1:02:15] their flesh
[1:02:16] how they enjoy the music how they enjoy
[1:02:21] the laughing yeah some of them like the
[1:02:24] casuality that you can bring your coffee
[1:02:26] right into the sanctuary
[1:02:28] yeah right you know it just everybody
[1:02:31] just
[1:02:31] they just everybody just kind of like
[1:02:34] talks to everybody in the sanctuary this
[1:02:35] is a really good time
[1:02:38] it's nothing about a nature change
[1:02:42] because a nature change requires dying
[1:02:44] out it hurts
[1:02:49] and eternal life it's the opposite
[1:02:54] when we receive eternal life we lose our
[1:02:57] life
[1:02:58] our nature our nature our old nature our
[1:03:02] selfishness
[1:03:03] and we literally live for others amen
[1:03:07] can you bear with me just a couple more
[1:03:09] minutes yes
[1:03:11] thank you saint john chapter 10 verse 27
[1:03:15] my sheep hear my voice i know them
[1:03:18] and they follow me and i give unto them
[1:03:23] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:03:26] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:03:28] my hand
[1:03:30] so jesus never said
[1:03:34] the words eternal life is living for
[1:03:38] others
[1:03:40] but he did say eat all my word
[1:03:43] teach others to do the same whatsoever
[1:03:45] i've commanded you
[1:03:47] he did say feed my sheep he did say wash
[1:03:51] the dirt off of other people's feet
[1:03:56] he did say love one another exactly the
[1:04:00] same way
[1:04:00] that i have loved you and how do you
[1:04:02] love us when we think about it
[1:04:04] he died for us he forgave us
[1:04:07] and now we got to go love somebody else
[1:04:09] the same way
[1:04:12] he did say no greater love
[1:04:16] that we could have than when a man lays
[1:04:18] down his life for his friends
[1:04:22] so he didn't say those
[1:04:25] words quote as the prophet said
[1:04:29] but when brother branham makes the quote
[1:04:32] eternal life is living for others
[1:04:34] he's summing up
[1:04:39] what jesus said in the bible
[1:04:44] show others eternal life
[1:04:47] show others eternal life live for them
[1:04:50] and not their body
[1:04:55] don't live for them naturally don't give
[1:04:58] them
[1:04:58] something that makes them happier
[1:05:02] makes life easier for them
[1:05:08] i mean these are good gestures
[1:05:12] and christians should do those things
[1:05:14] right but don't misinterpret
[1:05:18] live for the person soul you're talking
[1:05:20] to
[1:05:21] when you're talking to somebody think
[1:05:23] about their soul
[1:05:25] think about where it's at and where it
[1:05:27] needs to be
[1:05:29] it's not about friendship that's right
[1:05:33] anybody that knows me knows if you spend
[1:05:36] any time with me
[1:05:37] it ain't very much long before i'm
[1:05:40] dealing
[1:05:41] with their soul
[1:05:49] because anything else is going to pass
[1:05:55] i know that you know there are there are
[1:05:58] times that
[1:05:59] that either people have needs or people
[1:06:01] need to vent or the people
[1:06:04] things happen but our goal needs to be
[1:06:08] help their soul
[1:06:12] and you all have the ability to do that
[1:06:15] all of you here every single person in
[1:06:18] this church
[1:06:19] has the ability to do that
[1:06:24] amen i say today that if you're not
[1:06:26] living for others the same as the
[1:06:28] scriptures that taught us
[1:06:31] then i'm sure that the shepherd's voice
[1:06:34] is speaking
[1:06:35] to you today to follow that
[1:06:39] to follow him he's leading you
[1:06:42] to do this because my sheep hear my
[1:06:45] voice and they
[1:06:46] follow me
[1:06:50] if we had one week to live
[1:06:59] would you be that interested in making
[1:07:02] sure your grass got cut
[1:07:08] you got your car paid off
[1:07:14] finally got your room clean that was to
[1:07:18] me
[1:07:21] no we'd be thinking about those that
[1:07:25] would
[1:07:26] possibly be out of america's safety
[1:07:29] one week that's right
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:34] so is jesus coming soon to you
[1:07:37] see i believe the spirit is leading us
[1:07:41] to go display eternal life to others
[1:07:47] now we that have the holy ghost we
[1:07:50] that have the seed of god in us today we
[1:07:53] that have the
[1:07:54] treasure in our earthen vessels jesus
[1:07:57] the good shepherd
[1:07:58] inside of us is leading us to do his
[1:08:01] perfect will
[1:08:02] so i'll say hear him this morning as
[1:08:04] he's leading you
[1:08:07] to live for others for the souls of
[1:08:10] others
[1:08:12] henry ford and i'm closing henry iv
[1:08:16] said the true measure of a successful
[1:08:19] leader
[1:08:21] is their ability to discover the hidden
[1:08:24] talent
[1:08:25] in those that lead
[1:08:28] and challenge them to achieve greatness
[1:08:33] now i want you to think about our good
[1:08:35] shepherd jesus
[1:08:38] he's a good leader he knows
[1:08:41] there's a treasure inside of us we have
[1:08:45] him
[1:08:47] and he is leading us to achieve
[1:08:50] greatness saints i say as your pastor
[1:08:54] i see hidden treasure in you
[1:08:59] a treasure
[1:09:02] that it doesn't matter what persecution
[1:09:04] that you
[1:09:05] can help others without the fear of
[1:09:08] losing your own life
[1:09:09] losing your what you want to do
[1:09:13] without the fear of a persecution or
[1:09:16] affliction or
[1:09:18] or being so much in despair
[1:09:22] that you have this treasure in you
[1:09:25] and that you do have the ability of
[1:09:28] greatness and i have no other knowledge
[1:09:31] of greatness than for you to save one
[1:09:34] soul that's worth ten thousand worlds
[1:09:36] what greater thing could that be there
[1:09:38] is nothing greater
[1:09:43] we've just got to be willing to yield to
[1:09:45] what's inside of us
[1:09:48] it's there we believe it
[1:09:52] you to it to whom you yield yourself
[1:09:54] servants
[1:09:58] now i'll tell you i i'm so sick of the
[1:10:01] devil
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:05] he tricks me does he trick you
[1:10:10] he can't get us to say hey come on over
[1:10:12] here i'm the devil
[1:10:15] he lies to us he tricks us
[1:10:19] to live for herself to live a selfish
[1:10:22] life
[1:10:23] to have everything be about me myself
[1:10:25] and i
[1:10:27] i hate it i hate him
[1:10:30] hey man let's stand to
