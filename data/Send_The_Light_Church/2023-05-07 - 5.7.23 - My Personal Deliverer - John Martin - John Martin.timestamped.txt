[38:03] just the first eight verses we've read
[38:05] these before we're going to take just a
[38:07] little
[38:08] different thought and these want to
[38:11] invite our guests today in the back here
[38:15] this man in the brown i i i Terry is his
[38:21] name and this man has been very gracious
[38:24] to us he's the one that introduced us to
[38:27] more than probably three quarters of the
[38:29] machines that we have in her shop he's
[38:32] just been a really good
[38:35] friend to us and has helped us out in
[38:38] the business and he's looking for the

[38:56] um thank you for coming may the Lord
[38:58] bless each of you so good to see sister
[38:59] Linda Helms amongst us amens
[39:06] the Bible says and he spake a parable
[39:08] unto them to this and now notice the
[39:11] purpose of the parable that men
[39:14] ought always to pray and not to faint
[39:18] saying there wasn't a city a judge which
[39:21] feared not God neither regarded man and
[39:24] there was a widow in that City and she
[39:27] came unto him saying avenge me
[39:30] of my adversary
[39:32] and he would not for a while but
[39:35] afterwards he said within himself though
[39:37] I fear not God nor regard man yet
[39:41] because this Widow troubleth me I will
[39:44] avenge lest by her continual coming to
[39:47] me she weary me and the Lord said pay
[39:51] attention
[39:52] hear what the unjust judge saith
[39:57] and now and shall not God avenge his own
[40:01] elect which cry day and night unto him
[40:06] though he bear long with them I tell you
[40:09] that he will avenge them speedily
[40:12] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[40:15] shall he find faith on the earth amen
[40:19] God bless you may be seated
[40:23] we uh I believe that Brother Bruce did a
[40:27] really good job
[40:29] on Wednesday and we just appreciate him
[40:34] very very much last Sunday we ministered
[40:38] on ready or not here I come
[40:43] and here the question is asked by Jesus
[40:48] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[40:50] shall he find
[40:51] faith
[40:52] on the earth so
[40:55] God is coming whether we have faith or
[40:57] don't have faith
[40:59] right
[41:00] the end is going to happen we can't do
[41:03] anything to stop it
[41:05] the thing that we can do today
[41:08] is be ready
[41:10] like to entitle this my personal
[41:12] deliverer
[41:14] and for a subject calling on God brother
[41:16] Brandon said in the message Abraham he
[41:19] said wake up
[41:21] won't you bite your conscience won't you
[41:23] pinch your soul amen and we need to
[41:26] remember Jesus is still on the boat in
[41:29] our life
[41:30] we just got to get serious the
[41:33] illustration has come a number of times
[41:35] you'll wake him up I say we got to wake
[41:37] him up in our boat in our life
[41:40] because it seems sometimes that God is
[41:43] distant from us and he's not hearing our
[41:45] prayers the way we want to
[41:48] but he's amongst us
[41:50] amen you see this woman she cried out
[41:53] Cried Out cried out
[41:57] so when we want to be Avenged
[42:00] we want someone to vindicate us do you
[42:04] ever want somebody to go to bat for you
[42:05] and help you with your situation yes
[42:08] vindicate me of my adversary this
[42:12] helpless riddle had some serious
[42:15] problems that she needed attention with
[42:17] and she was in a desperate State and no
[42:20] one was able to help her except this uh
[42:24] unjust judge he was he was a worldly man
[42:27] and he didn't care about anything except
[42:31] himself
[42:32] he didn't fear God he didn't respect God
[42:35] he didn't even possess the beginning of
[42:38] wisdom
[42:39] it was just all him all about him he
[42:42] didn't care about being right or wrong
[42:44] his conscience had been seared
[42:48] and on top of that he didn't care about
[42:50] anybody else he didn't regard people
[42:53] you know what do we often talked about
[42:55] corrupt judges in our nation
[42:58] and how they get paid off and how they
[43:00] get Personal Agenda I can see this judge
[43:04] it was all about him what he could get
[43:09] this judge had power to help her
[43:11] situation
[43:12] but was completely selfish and
[43:15] self-centered in his thinking yet
[43:17] because of his selfish motive he had a
[43:20] selfish motive which was to get her off
[43:22] her back she he decided to do something
[43:24] amen
[43:26] and this judge he simply didn't want to
[43:29] be bothered anymore
[43:32] he didn't want to be wore out fatigued
[43:34] and drained and spent over this
[43:36] situation anymore he was becoming
[43:39] uncapable in functioning
[43:42] right
[43:44] so he took care of the problem
[43:47] now if that could happen in the world
[43:49] how much more is God going to take care
[43:52] of us
[43:53] we are the apple of his eye
[43:56] we're in the palm of his hand no man can
[43:59] pluck us out in fact Jesus said fear not
[44:01] little flock it's the father's good
[44:03] pleasure to give you the kingdom
[44:05] he has chosen us from the foundation of
[44:08] the world and he's going to see us
[44:10] through the Bible says he which had
[44:12] begun a good work in you is going to
[44:13] finish it how much more shall God take
[44:17] care of his own elect
[44:21] we've been predestinated
[44:25] and Jesus said shall not God Avenged his
[44:28] own elect
[44:31] Romans 8 tells us who shall lay anything
[44:34] to the charge of God's elect
[44:38] think about it think of all the times
[44:40] that you've been accused
[44:43] now I just want to say this right or
[44:45] wrong
[44:47] right or wrong
[44:49] Vengeance belongs to God
[44:54] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[44:56] God's elect God has become our judge
[45:00] when we surrender our life to God God
[45:02] now is our judge God is our protection
[45:05] we have to go through God he is our he's
[45:08] our jury he's our our defense he's our
[45:12] personal deliverer amen right
[45:16] it is God that justifieth
[45:20] and by faith we're Justified
[45:24] by faith in what Christ has already done
[45:27] for us we're Justified now just that
[45:29] that's for our sins and there's the
[45:31] greatest thing that we could do that
[45:32] could happen to our life is be saved
[45:34] from our sins
[45:36] and God Justified us as if we never
[45:38] sinned
[45:40] now how much more is he going to take
[45:42] care of our situations in her life
[45:45] amen God's got this
[45:48] he's got this if God be for you who can
[45:50] be against you everything is going to
[45:53] work out
[45:54] so what can we say to these things we
[45:56] need to say Glory Glory Glory to God
[45:58] that's what we need to say
[46:00] amen God who did not spare his own son
[46:04] but delivered him up for us all how
[46:06] shall he not with him also freely give
[46:09] us all things how many has a need
[46:14] of God in your life
[46:16] amen so all things all things
[46:21] Philippians 4 19 says my God shall
[46:25] supply all your need according to his
[46:28] riches in Glory by Christ Jesus now I'd
[46:31] like to read it like this my personal
[46:33] God
[46:35] my personal God it's got to be personal
[46:37] to you
[46:39] every need is going to be met all of
[46:41] them right
[46:43] why are we hovering over certain ones
[46:47] what's happening is our faith is being
[46:49] attacked
[46:51] what do we have to worry about
[46:54] brother John you don't understand
[46:58] you don't get my situation
[47:02] it's not the same
[47:04] it's different
[47:08] and I am put in a pickle I'm put in a
[47:11] box and this pressure is so great in my
[47:15] life that
[47:17] it's just different and you don't
[47:20] understand
[47:21] Now isn't that how the devil plants his
[47:24] seed
[47:27] in fact my Situation's getting worse
[47:33] I don't see the deliverer
[47:36] I see
[47:37] the problem becoming magnified and it's
[47:41] causing other problems
[47:45] we need to watch our testimony
[47:48] remember often what we say is what
[47:50] happens
[47:51] he is the high priest of our profession
[47:54] if we profess God isn't going to help us
[47:57] there's a good chance he's not going to
[47:59] help us
[48:01] but if we profess that God is going to
[48:04] help us he's Duty bound to stand for our
[48:07] profession in him our confession in him
[48:10] done
[48:13] so we need to watch your testimony not
[48:15] just in our words but our thoughts
[48:18] because they speak louder in heaven
[48:21] we don't have a lot of time but you can
[48:23] write this down Revelations chapter 12
[48:26] verses 7 through 17 we don't have time
[48:28] to read it but I want to pull one verse
[48:30] out of there and it's verse 11 and they
[48:31] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by
[48:33] the word of their testimony and they
[48:35] love not their lives unto death
[48:40] it isn't just the blood
[48:43] it's your testimony in that blood
[48:47] it's the word of your testimony we need
[48:49] our testimony to be right to overcome
[48:53] this is the ingredients to overcoming we
[48:56] can't just say
[48:58] Jesus died for me and you're not going
[49:00] to testify he died for you
[49:04] because we're going to be tested we're
[49:06] going to be tried we're going to be put
[49:07] right there to the fiery furnace and see
[49:10] if we really are going to believe what
[49:12] we say
[49:15] and we need our Our Testimony to be
[49:18] exactly what the Bible says exactly what
[49:21] the word says you need to believe what
[49:23] the word says about you more than what
[49:24] you feel about yourself
[49:27] we are Overcomers greater is he that's
[49:30] in me than he that's in the world we
[49:32] need to believe that word what it's
[49:33] saying about us and that is how we
[49:35] overcome that is what God is looking for
[49:37] in our lives
[49:40] we need to start calling those things
[49:41] which be not as though they were
[49:48] I say like this woman this little woman
[49:51] we need to be constantly
[49:55] constantly calling on God
[49:57] and we need to let the devil know all
[49:59] the time
[50:00] where we're standing
[50:02] [Music]
[50:03] because he sees
[50:06] how his negative thoughts begin to
[50:09] infilter in our lives and calls us to
[50:12] think on things and say things and all
[50:14] of a sudden we're starting to talk about
[50:16] our not only our problems but other
[50:18] people's problems more than same with
[50:21] the word is saying for victory for us
[50:24] yeah
[50:25] we need to stop considering our
[50:27] circumstances as unmanageable for God
[50:31] we need to stop staggering around at
[50:33] God's promises for our lives and just
[50:35] take that word and believe it for you
[50:37] personally you
[50:40] need to build ourselves up in the Most
[50:43] Holy Faith testify of what the word says
[50:48] yeah the devil's going to come and he's
[50:49] going to taunt you he's going to say you
[50:52] don't really mean that doesn't matter
[50:54] what he says you don't have to feel it
[50:56] you don't have to have electricity
[50:58] coming out of your body you just have to
[51:00] believe the word the right mental
[51:02] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[51:04] God will bring it to pass
[51:09] turn with me if you would to Second
[51:11] Kings chapter 13.
[51:14] we just need to be fully persuaded that
[51:16] what God has promised he will perform
[51:19] second Kings chapter 13.
[51:32] now here's
[51:37] a story that we a few verses is going to
[51:41] tell us a story where we can learn
[51:43] that God has an answer for our situation
[51:46] and that we play a part in that
[51:50] you remember when God called the
[51:51] children of Israel out of Egypt he did
[51:55] it
[51:56] the by himself I mean yes he used Moses
[51:59] but he did it himself
[52:02] and then God put it
[52:06] this commandment out there that you need
[52:09] to believe that there is a promised land
[52:11] for you
[52:13] and they failed to fight that faith
[52:16] Joshua and Caleb said we're more than
[52:18] able to make it and the other ones they
[52:20] just murmured and complained
[52:22] and we can learn from these set of
[52:24] scriptures here that we have a part to
[52:26] play
[52:28] amen verse starting with verse number 14
[52:31] and Elisha was Fallen sick of his
[52:34] sickness wherever he died and joash the
[52:37] king of Israel came down unto him and
[52:39] wept over his face and said oh father my
[52:42] father the Chariots of Israel and the
[52:44] horsemen thereof
[52:45] and Elisha said unto him take bow and
[52:49] arrows notice he didn't tell him how
[52:51] many did it take
[52:52] bowl and arrows and he took unto him
[52:56] bowl and arrows and he said to the king
[52:59] of Israel
[53:01] put thy hand upon the ball and he put
[53:03] his hand upon the ball and Elisha put
[53:05] his hands upon the king's hands and he
[53:08] said open the window Eastward and he
[53:10] opened it and then Elisha said shoot
[53:14] and he shot and he said the arrow of the
[53:18] Lord's Deliverance
[53:20] and the arrow of Deliverance for Syria
[53:23] for thou shall Smite the syrians in Apec
[53:26] till thou has consumed them
[53:30] and he said take the arrows and he took
[53:33] them
[53:34] and he said unto the king of Israel
[53:37] Smite upon the ground
[53:41] and he smote three
[53:43] I'm sorry he smoked twice Thrice which
[53:46] means three and stayed he just shot
[53:49] three and then he stayed
[53:51] didn't do anything else
[53:53] now you would think he followed the
[53:55] instructions right
[53:59] in other words I I praise God I asked
[54:02] God I cried out to God three times
[54:07] and the man of God was Wrath
[54:10] with him and said thou should have
[54:12] smitten five or six times
[54:15] then as thou Smit in Syria till thou had
[54:19] consumed it whereas now Thou shalt Smite
[54:21] Syria but Thrice you know a lot of times
[54:26] we go to God because things are just
[54:29] really bothering us we cry out to him as
[54:31] soon as we get to help with that thing
[54:33] we just stop
[54:37] we get a little Victory we just stop
[54:39] and then this things start happening
[54:41] again and what we can learn from this is
[54:44] that God has an arrow of Deliverance for
[54:47] every one of our situations
[54:49] but we need to get serious and not just
[54:51] do a little bit but we need to do fiber
[54:53] so we need to keep calling on God
[54:57] because God will see you through
[55:00] you have to do your part
[55:02] you can't just well God you know my
[55:04] heart
[55:06] you know what I'm being bothered by you
[55:09] know what's needed
[55:11] no God is looking for some
[55:13] you know how would you like to go out
[55:15] with somebody that didn't really put
[55:17] their heart
[55:19] into you
[55:23] nobody wants to marry some computer
[55:26] right
[55:28] I mean when we read a book we get
[55:29] inspired
[55:31] we see two people kissing or loving we
[55:34] say wow I wish that must be sweet that's
[55:38] that's wonderful it's the way it should
[55:39] be we see two people just cold
[55:44] God wants a relationship
[55:46] he wants us to call upon him
[55:49] not just say God if you're
[55:52] you're supposed to take care of all this
[55:53] stuff
[55:55] no
[55:56] we still have to reverence the Lord amen
[55:58] you have to plead with them
[56:00] now one purpose that God intended this
[56:03] Parable for was to keep us praying in
[56:06] desperation
[56:08] to our situation gets taken care of
[56:13] and we're not going to overcome if our
[56:15] prayers are not overcoming
[56:18] you understand what I'm saying if we go
[56:20] to God and complain we go to God and
[56:22] murmur we go to God and just say this is
[56:24] everything that's he knows what's
[56:26] happening he's looking for us to start
[56:29] having faith in what's going on in our
[56:31] heart
[56:32] that we're trusting him we're trusting
[56:35] in the word of God
[56:36] that he has provided a way of excitement
[56:39] we don't know what it is
[56:41] we don't need to know what it is
[56:43] we just need to believe that he's going
[56:45] to do it
[56:46] now we're living in the hour where we're
[56:48] all being buffeted by our adversary
[56:50] right right on every side
[56:54] many things I want to talk about one
[56:57] thing that's really strong
[56:59] there's a strong Spirit trying to get us
[57:03] to slow down
[57:06] to give up
[57:07] to turn around
[57:10] to just kind of
[57:13] yeah
[57:16] what's the use
[57:18] nothing makes it different nothing
[57:20] changes
[57:22] I can't see the light of the end of the
[57:23] tunnel has anybody dealt with that
[57:26] spirit let me just see
[57:28] who am I talking to
[57:30] amen it's a real real spirit in this age
[57:35] Jesus said nevertheless when the son of
[57:37] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[57:40] Earth
[57:44] the question is
[57:46] the question we should ask is Jesus
[57:49] going to find faith in us
[57:52] when he returns
[57:54] or is he going to see us falling away
[57:57] from the faith
[58:01] we're told at the hour of his return
[58:05] that it would be just the opposite of
[58:07] faith
[58:09] second Thessalonians 2 3 if you write it
[58:12] want to write it down let no man deceive
[58:14] you by any means for that day shall not
[58:16] come except there come a falling away
[58:20] first
[58:23] Christians are falling away from the
[58:25] faith that was once delivered to them
[58:28] people are leaving the messages in the
[58:30] in the world people are leaving
[58:33] modern Christianity more than they ever
[58:36] have
[58:38] evil is prevailing
[58:41] that's why we need to be earnestly
[58:42] contending for the faith
[58:48] more I read this that more and more
[58:50] people are describing their religious
[58:52] identity as atheist atheists
[58:56] agnostic
[58:58] or really nothing in particular
[59:00] they stopped believing in God now that's
[59:04] the spirit in this age that we're
[59:07] fighting I'm not saying we're doing that
[59:10] I'm saying that spirit is fighting us
[59:13] and it wears us down
[59:16] churches are having to compromise just
[59:19] to keep people in the churches
[59:21] you preach the word anymore people go
[59:23] somewhere else to find
[59:27] Satan gives them some good ideas
[59:31] all you got to do is compromise with the
[59:32] word a little bit lower your standard
[59:35] Don't Preach about holiness
[59:37] in other words they let the goats in
[59:40] true just enter just entertain them and
[59:43] they'll come to church
[59:44] [Music]
[59:46] just have a concert
[59:48] a comedian
[59:50] short little message God loves you
[59:52] everything's okay
[59:55] Paul being a prophet
[59:57] turn with me to Second Timothy chapter 3
[59:59] verse one Paul being a prophet God
[1:00:01] showed him what kind of spirit there
[1:00:03] would be inside of the church
[1:00:05] when he comes
[1:00:08] that's how bad it's getting
[1:00:11] and this is you we all know this
[1:00:13] scripture but it just Bears repeating
[1:00:15] this know also that in the last days
[1:00:17] perilous times shall come
[1:00:21] now just I want you to look at this as
[1:00:23] not
[1:00:27] I don't want you to I so much identify
[1:00:29] this as somebody that you think in the
[1:00:33] church has one of these
[1:00:35] I I don't want you to do that
[1:00:37] but how I want you to look at that is
[1:00:39] this spirit
[1:00:42] trying to get you
[1:00:44] and then just ask which one of these
[1:00:46] Spirits are trying to get you
[1:00:48] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:00:49] self
[1:00:52] covetous
[1:00:53] bolsters
[1:00:55] proud
[1:00:57] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:01:00] unthankful
[1:01:03] uh sure appreciate that Psalm this
[1:01:05] morning amen
[1:01:07] Unholy
[1:01:09] without natural affection
[1:01:12] truth Breakers
[1:01:16] false accusers
[1:01:19] you know I'll tell you what we got
[1:01:21] enough Satan accusing us what do we need
[1:01:23] others to accuse us
[1:01:25] we are leading to somebody to help us
[1:01:29] incontinent in other words without
[1:01:31] self-control
[1:01:33] Fierce despisers of those that are
[1:01:37] trying to do good
[1:01:39] Traders
[1:01:44] saying you're going to do something and
[1:01:45] then months later you don't do it
[1:01:48] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:01:52] more than lovers of God having a form of
[1:01:54] godliness but denying the power of verse
[1:01:57] 7 ever learning but never able to come
[1:01:59] to the knowledge of the truth now is
[1:02:01] James Janice and James withstood Moses
[1:02:04] so do these also resist the truth
[1:02:09] they're men of corrupt Minds reprobates
[1:02:11] worthless Haster ways concerning what
[1:02:14] the faith when the son of man comes
[1:02:17] shall he find faith
[1:02:20] and you see these spirits that get on us
[1:02:23] and and trying to get us just to
[1:02:26] to not
[1:02:27] give ourselves totally to God
[1:02:31] will cause us to fit in to these things
[1:02:34] right while we're in the church
[1:02:40] the spirit of this age is to withstand
[1:02:43] God's truth that's what the spirit of
[1:02:46] air is that's what the spirit of Satan
[1:02:47] is that's what the spirit of the devil
[1:02:49] is he don't want you here at church
[1:02:51] right
[1:02:52] and he certainly don't want you in a
[1:02:54] church that preaches the truth
[1:02:59] and I don't care what Spirits are
[1:03:01] attacking you have attacked you there is
[1:03:04] a deliverer and he can personally
[1:03:06] deliver you if you just confess it to
[1:03:09] God's tell God what's going on Amen
[1:03:12] if we baby it
[1:03:21] Church men of corrupt Minds
[1:03:25] the laodicean age has turned into the
[1:03:29] age of apostasy
[1:03:32] a great Falling Away there are scoffers
[1:03:35] that people are getting worse and worse
[1:03:37] the love of many is waxing cold now I
[1:03:40] just I just want to say something that I
[1:03:42] have seen in the last 15 years now I
[1:03:46] watch people I've been that way since I
[1:03:48] was a kid
[1:03:49] I'll work with people I have friends I
[1:03:52] have family I have precious brothers and
[1:03:54] sisters and if there's one thing that
[1:03:56] I've seen change is the love of many
[1:04:00] waxing more cold
[1:04:05] now they'll have an excuse
[1:04:07] they all blame somebody
[1:04:11] they all blame someone
[1:04:13] but they won't listen to Jesus
[1:04:17] because Jesus said because iniquity
[1:04:18] abounds because iniquity abounds in your
[1:04:22] life
[1:04:23] Your Love Will wax code right but if you
[1:04:27] stay on fire you be faithful you keep
[1:04:29] reading your Bible you keep praying you
[1:04:31] keep calling on God you keep crying out
[1:04:34] to him and our God is faithful he will
[1:04:36] fill you with the love of God
[1:04:39] I'll tell you what I love about Joshua
[1:04:42] and Caleb for 45 years they've stood in
[1:04:45] a congregation that just didn't want to
[1:04:48] submit to God but you know they were so
[1:04:50] faithful they loved everyone they kept
[1:04:53] the same attitude we can make it out of
[1:04:55] here just change your attitude and God
[1:04:58] will see you through
[1:05:03] that's what we need we need Joshua and
[1:05:04] Caleb's
[1:05:07] the sibo spirit is constantly working
[1:05:09] against us buffiness on every side
[1:05:13] trying to get us to give up
[1:05:16] on our own steadfastness remember the
[1:05:18] time she said oh yeah I'm going to be
[1:05:20] faithful and then after a while it was
[1:05:22] doesn't matter if I come
[1:05:27] it's trying to get us to lose hope
[1:05:29] lose our beginning confidence that we
[1:05:32] had
[1:05:33] right not holding it firm to the end
[1:05:41] Satan I remember one time brother Mark
[1:05:44] was preaching he said that
[1:05:47] Satan is always trying to get us to lay
[1:05:50] down our our Christian armor
[1:05:53] because as soon as you just relax
[1:05:56] that's when the enemy can get in there
[1:06:00] and this is the spirit that we're
[1:06:01] fighting
[1:06:03] Hebrews 12 3 12 says take heed brethren
[1:06:07] lest there be and any of you an evil
[1:06:09] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[1:06:11] Living God
[1:06:13] we need to fight the good fight of faith
[1:06:15] we need to keep pressing you can't look
[1:06:17] at your feelings how many times have
[1:06:19] your feelings lied to you
[1:06:22] I mean it happens all the time yet for
[1:06:25] some reason we're just so stuck on
[1:06:27] believing the next one we have
[1:06:29] we never just okay this could be wrong
[1:06:31] what does the word say no we go by our
[1:06:33] feelings
[1:06:40] I tell you what we're needing is we need
[1:06:41] to get a re-energizing
[1:06:45] in our walk with God
[1:06:47] and just forget about our problems
[1:06:50] I don't mean it wrong
[1:06:51] but look God will put every single human
[1:06:54] being on the planet in the spot that
[1:06:57] they can't do nothing about something
[1:06:58] they can only trust God
[1:07:02] and that's where we're going to make the
[1:07:04] choice I trust you in my situation it
[1:07:07] isn't just what you're going through the
[1:07:09] person next to you has gone through it
[1:07:11] if they're not going through it now and
[1:07:13] here's the one thing
[1:07:15] we're always going through something
[1:07:18] I was in the room and just I just feel
[1:07:21] like God has just been really
[1:07:24] crushing me
[1:07:28] and God you know why God puts you in
[1:07:30] pain
[1:07:32] he puts you in pain so you are forced to
[1:07:35] look to him
[1:07:39] trials fulfill a purpose
[1:07:43] and our attitude towards them should be
[1:07:47] counted all joy to be grateful that God
[1:07:52] is in control of your life and that what
[1:07:54] he put in your life is causing you
[1:07:58] to look to him oh glory to God because
[1:08:01] we're not doing it enough
[1:08:04] we need to be like this woman and cry
[1:08:06] out till more
[1:08:08] our walks sometimes get so starchy
[1:08:12] I think we just need to get more
[1:08:14] desperate about this adversary that's
[1:08:17] trying to take us down trying to take
[1:08:19] our family down we need to get more
[1:08:20] desperate
[1:08:22] keep getting desperate keep fighting
[1:08:24] like this woman was fighting she was a
[1:08:27] good example for the elect
[1:08:31] Jesus thought so
[1:08:35] amen we just can't I'll tell you this is
[1:08:36] why I could see now the wisdom that
[1:08:39] brother Branham had when he said that
[1:08:40] you ministers you need to stay away from
[1:08:42] predestination it'll confuse the people
[1:08:46] you tell some of their predestined and
[1:08:48] chosen so much they don't think they
[1:08:50] need to cry out anymore
[1:08:56] I'll tell you if we are the elect we
[1:08:59] will be crying out that's what this
[1:09:01] message is for
[1:09:03] is to get us calling on God more
[1:09:06] don't wait till you feel like it we got
[1:09:07] a good concert everybody in the church
[1:09:09] is telling you you're the best
[1:09:10] you're the best person in the church
[1:09:14] that ain't gonna happen
[1:09:18] we need God on the inside
[1:09:25] keep digging
[1:09:27] keep digging
[1:09:29] so the question is when God comes
[1:09:33] is he going to see you
[1:09:35] in the faith
[1:09:37] not intellectual now
[1:09:39] in the faith that is producing a life
[1:09:41] and a testimony with your words
[1:09:43] in the things that you're doing
[1:09:46] or is he going to see that you are
[1:09:48] falling away
[1:09:50] from the original
[1:09:53] it ain't going to just happen
[1:09:55] we've got to fight for it
[1:09:57] we need to be fighting for this Faith
[1:09:59] now what is the faith
[1:10:00] think about you when you first God first
[1:10:03] called you
[1:10:06] it was all about salvation
[1:10:11] when Christ came into your life it was
[1:10:13] the greatest thing that happened on
[1:10:15] Earth
[1:10:16] I'm going to tell you that's still the
[1:10:18] greatest thing on the planet
[1:10:20] that's still the cause of Christ
[1:10:23] that's what we should be doing today
[1:10:26] when he looked at Peter he said
[1:10:30] follow me and I'll make you Fishers of
[1:10:32] Men
[1:10:34] I want to save you
[1:10:37] I want to pray for you that your faith
[1:10:39] fail not and I want to use you to win
[1:10:42] souls now what was the Great Commission
[1:10:44] before he left go out
[1:10:47] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:10:51] baptizing them teaching them to do
[1:10:53] whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I
[1:10:56] am with you to the end
[1:10:58] so in the end when he returns is he
[1:11:01] going to find you doing that
[1:11:03] or is he going to find you while I'm in
[1:11:05] and that's all that really matters
[1:11:08] come on now
[1:11:10] don't tell me you're not called we're
[1:11:12] all called
[1:11:14] we're all called to share Jesus and I'll
[1:11:16] tell you this when God came into my life
[1:11:18] I just couldn't help but tell somebody
[1:11:21] you remember that you were bubbling it's
[1:11:23] a bubbling it's a bubbling but what's
[1:11:25] happening the Devil comes in her life
[1:11:27] and he pollutes it with a lot of
[1:11:29] worldliness and carnality and and
[1:11:31] they're they're we become negative and
[1:11:34] the only thing we do is we start to see
[1:11:35] problems and everything else and
[1:11:37] everybody else that's right
[1:11:39] and that's the spirit that we're
[1:11:40] fighting well how do you fight against
[1:11:42] it start calling on God
[1:11:45] call out to God
[1:11:47] do what Jesus said
[1:11:50] he gave us this Parable for a reason
[1:11:53] don't let the devil rock you to sleep
[1:11:56] our Salvation is nearer than when we
[1:11:59] first believed
[1:12:00] do you believe that it's a high time to
[1:12:02] to wake up to rise up we don't want to
[1:12:05] sleep like the the modern church is
[1:12:08] sleeping if I could say it like this
[1:12:10] we're the elect we need to act like it
[1:12:13] we need to get desperate stay desperate
[1:12:16] have our testimony of our mouth always
[1:12:19] being positive
[1:12:23] there's needs in our life
[1:12:25] there's needs in our family there's
[1:12:26] needs in her church I wonder
[1:12:30] who wants to be so close to God that you
[1:12:32] intervene
[1:12:34] you see we have a job to do but Satan's
[1:12:39] job is to get you thinking about all
[1:12:41] that not just your problems but all your
[1:12:43] your desires all your goals all the
[1:12:46] things that you want to do get so
[1:12:47] involved
[1:12:49] that you forget about Christ and but you
[1:12:51] spend more time in prayer you'll get
[1:12:54] more balance more connected and you'll
[1:12:56] be doing the right things
[1:12:58] we can't get lazy
[1:13:00] we can't
[1:13:02] shall not God avenge his own elect which
[1:13:07] cry day and night not just that woman
[1:13:11] not just that little woman
[1:13:14] but his own elect need to cry out day
[1:13:16] and night
[1:13:18] though he bear long with them
[1:13:22] if you want to see God move more in your
[1:13:24] lives you need to move more with God
[1:13:28] need to cry out more
[1:13:35] now the modern Church isn't going to be
[1:13:36] crying out
[1:13:40] they're lukewarm
[1:13:43] they're cold
[1:13:45] in the sense of uh well they're lukewarm
[1:13:48] but they're they're they're not sold out
[1:13:53] they're not really sold out so they're
[1:13:55] part of the group that sometimes is
[1:13:57] praising God and sometimes they're not
[1:14:01] but they're miserable
[1:14:03] they're blind
[1:14:05] they become in a lukewarm state to where
[1:14:09] they have this attitude
[1:14:12] I need nothing
[1:14:16] I don't need you to tell me what to do I
[1:14:19] don't need to come under subjection God
[1:14:21] has already saved me this is between me
[1:14:24] and God and I don't need any man telling
[1:14:26] me what I need to do
[1:14:29] that's the spirit
[1:14:32] and unless we go to God we cry out we're
[1:14:34] zealous to repent we're zealous I'll
[1:14:38] tell you this is for the Church of the
[1:14:40] Living God we've got to overcome the
[1:14:42] spirit we can't have the attitude I've
[1:14:44] already overcame it and I'm in the
[1:14:46] message now friends that ain't it that
[1:14:48] spirit is just as real today it's trying
[1:14:50] to bring you down you know how many
[1:14:52] people are in this message that are in
[1:14:53] laodicea
[1:14:56] yes
[1:14:57] excuse me for bobbing back and forth I
[1:15:00] need like this cage right here a little
[1:15:01] thing to keep me right here
[1:15:05] foreign
[1:15:07] we can't
[1:15:09] get comfortable because we know we're
[1:15:12] sitting in a church that preaches all
[1:15:14] the truth
[1:15:15] it don't work
[1:15:17] we need that Living Truth in us when God
[1:15:21] speaks to our heart something inside of
[1:15:23] our hearts says yes to the word that was
[1:15:26] preached to us is bearing witness the
[1:15:29] spirit and it says bearing witness with
[1:15:31] his spirit that we are the children of
[1:15:33] God we are the elect of God and that
[1:15:35] word spoken is for me not for somebody
[1:15:37] else
[1:15:38] that's what I hate about this Spirit
[1:15:40] about coming to church about just I got
[1:15:42] all I just want you to speak about this
[1:15:45] and just you know just this one thing
[1:15:46] I'll tell you the things where God is
[1:15:48] coming he has did things in my life and
[1:15:51] has crushed me and things that have
[1:15:52] happened I'll tell you I don't I don't
[1:15:54] see it coming from the left-hander to
[1:15:56] the right
[1:15:57] God don't need my okay
[1:16:02] we need to come to this house and say
[1:16:05] God where am I with you
[1:16:07] speak to me
[1:16:09] I need to hear what you want me to do
[1:16:14] because that's all that matters
[1:16:17] we need to run to God In Prayer
[1:16:21] Proverbs 18 10 says the name of the Lord
[1:16:24] is a strong tower and the righteous run
[1:16:26] into it and they're safe
[1:16:28] we know where to go
[1:16:30] righteous man falls down what does he do
[1:16:36] he doesn't say well everybody falls I'm
[1:16:38] just going to stay down here
[1:16:40] this he gets back up gets in the race
[1:16:47] the Bible says some trust in chariots
[1:16:49] some trust in horses
[1:16:52] I'll say some trust in themselves
[1:16:55] but we will remember the name of our
[1:16:58] Lord our God
[1:17:01] Psalms 18 verse 2 the Lord is my rock my
[1:17:05] Fortress my deliverer my God my strength
[1:17:09] in whom I will trust my buckler my horn
[1:17:11] of my salvation and my high tower
[1:17:14] you talk about a personal belief
[1:17:18] David said my
[1:17:21] can you say my
[1:17:23] we don't want to look at God is just a
[1:17:26] deliverer he's got to be your personal
[1:17:28] deliverer
[1:17:31] verse 3 says I will call upon the Lord
[1:17:33] who is worthy to be praised so shall I
[1:17:38] be saved from my enemies
[1:17:42] amen that's without what a woman was
[1:17:43] doing she was calling upon the Lord
[1:17:46] yeah you might get a little discouraged
[1:17:48] but you need to keep doing it
[1:17:51] I don't care if the word rebukes you
[1:17:56] look we've got to remember
[1:17:58] no man should ever
[1:18:01] be rebuking another person if there's
[1:18:05] rebuking that has to be done you better
[1:18:07] make sure that's the Holy Ghost In You
[1:18:12] and God is he's the one that sets the
[1:18:15] order in the church
[1:18:16] man he's the one that sets the order in
[1:18:19] our life
[1:18:23] there was a woman
[1:18:25] she just wanted help
[1:18:27] from Jesus to heal her daughter
[1:18:31] and the word
[1:18:33] just came out and said you're not worthy
[1:18:35] for what you're asking for
[1:18:41] but her attitude was that is the truth
[1:18:44] Lord I am not worthy
[1:18:47] her attitude is what brought the results
[1:18:53] I don't believe this little woman felt
[1:18:55] she was worthy when she was going to the
[1:19:00] uh uh going to the judge
[1:19:04] because she kept coming pleading over
[1:19:06] and over and over
[1:19:10] we just got to come in that right spirit
[1:19:12] that right attitude
[1:19:14] God will take care of the situations
[1:19:16] I'll say when you get personal with God
[1:19:19] that's when God gets personal with you
[1:19:22] when you can start to put your name in
[1:19:24] the scriptures draw an eye to God and
[1:19:26] he'll draw an eye to you
[1:19:27] brother Brandon said in the message to
[1:19:29] reproach for the cause of the word
[1:19:32] he talked about
[1:19:34] an old Captain his name was John quartz
[1:19:37] he got sick near and to death on the
[1:19:39] ship and God had ordained a boy
[1:19:43] who read his Bible
[1:19:45] and his mom read the Bible to him and he
[1:19:47] was
[1:19:48] on this particular voyage and the boys
[1:19:51] said
[1:19:52] to the captain let me tell you Captain
[1:19:54] how that my mother used to read it said
[1:19:57] here's the way she wrote it he was
[1:20:00] wounded for Willie Pruitt's iniquity and
[1:20:04] he was chastised for Willie Pruitt and
[1:20:06] all things that he'd done was for Willie
[1:20:09] Pruitt that was his name you know Willie
[1:20:11] Pruitt and the old Captain said I like
[1:20:14] that I like that could you read my name
[1:20:16] in it
[1:20:17] and the little boy said I'll try and he
[1:20:20] said he was wounded for John quartz's
[1:20:22] transgressions
[1:20:24] he was bruised for John quartz's
[1:20:26] iniquity
[1:20:27] and with his stripe John courts was
[1:20:30] healed
[1:20:31] and the old Captain said I see it I see
[1:20:34] it the Lord healed him
[1:20:37] because he put his name in the book
[1:20:40] it became personal to him
[1:20:43] he said Brother Brad says read your name
[1:20:45] in it
[1:20:46] he was wounded for William bradham's
[1:20:49] transgressions he was bruised for
[1:20:50] William bradham's iniquities he did that
[1:20:53] for me and he did that for you just read
[1:20:55] your name in it can you say Amen the
[1:20:58] gospel was for the whole world
[1:21:01] but only you can accept it for you
[1:21:04] you can't accept it for anybody
[1:21:07] and we certainly don't want to say it's
[1:21:08] true but you know many times we heard
[1:21:10] this I know I know it's true but it's
[1:21:12] not for me
[1:21:14] a lot of times Christians who come to
[1:21:16] church feel the same way
[1:21:18] oh yeah I know you know God loves me but
[1:21:22] I'm an overcomer I don't know I don't
[1:21:24] feel like it what I've been going
[1:21:26] through
[1:21:28] you got to put your name in the book you
[1:21:31] got to get serious with the devil that
[1:21:32] taunts you that lies to you that tells
[1:21:34] you you can't overcome
[1:21:37] you believe that
[1:21:39] there was a woman she was in dire need
[1:21:41] she had a blood issue for 12 years
[1:21:45] and you talk about Hope being against
[1:21:47] her
[1:21:49] she had tried so many things for 12
[1:21:52] years
[1:21:53] but she didn't give up
[1:21:56] when she came to service that day
[1:22:00] Jesus was going to be preaching
[1:22:04] and she came with this intent she was
[1:22:07] desperate
[1:22:09] if I could just Touch the Hem of His
[1:22:11] Garment
[1:22:12] and she pressed through the crowd she
[1:22:15] pressed through the people she did what
[1:22:17] she had to do to touch him
[1:22:20] now you touch Jesus with your faith
[1:22:24] if you can believe for your situation
[1:22:26] God can give it to you
[1:22:29] do not say I'm believing and it don't ha
[1:22:32] and it didn't happen don't you say that
[1:22:35] you just keep believing
[1:22:37] I'm not saying you're doubting I'm just
[1:22:40] saying keep believing
[1:22:42] there's a difference
[1:22:46] if there's something wrong with your
[1:22:47] faith God will straighten that out
[1:22:49] but you just need to keep confessing you
[1:22:51] need to keep believing all right Matthew
[1:22:53] 20 verse 29.
[1:22:56] Matthew 20 verse 29 here's a little uh
[1:23:01] example in the Bible
[1:23:03] of what we need to be doing I believe
[1:23:06] today
[1:23:08] there's a couple Blind Men that had a
[1:23:11] need and as they Departed
[1:23:14] uh
[1:23:15] uh as they departed from Jericho a great
[1:23:19] multitude followed him so this must be
[1:23:21] Jesus and his disciples when they
[1:23:23] departed from Jericho a great multitude
[1:23:25] followed him and behold two blind men
[1:23:28] sitting by the wayside when they heard
[1:23:32] that Jesus had passed by cried out
[1:23:34] saying have mercy on us O Lord thou son
[1:23:39] of David
[1:23:41] and the multitude noticed everybody in
[1:23:45] church rebuked them
[1:23:48] said you need to be quiet
[1:23:50] you need to hold your peace
[1:23:53] but you know what they did
[1:23:55] the Bible says they cried the more
[1:23:58] saying have mercy on this O Lord thou
[1:24:00] son of David I'll tell you there is
[1:24:02] nobody here that can help you but Jesus
[1:24:12] if you're here for help don't you let
[1:24:14] anything discourage you
[1:24:16] don't you let anything that said
[1:24:19] anything any talk behind your back
[1:24:21] anything that's happened discourage you
[1:24:23] you are here for Jesus
[1:24:27] have mercy on us O Lord thou son of
[1:24:30] David and Jesus Stood Still and called
[1:24:33] them and said what will you have what
[1:24:37] will ye that I shall do unto you
[1:24:42] and they said unto him Lord
[1:24:44] that her eyes may be open
[1:24:47] so Jesus had compassion on them and
[1:24:50] touched their eyes and immediately their
[1:24:52] eyes received sight and they followed
[1:24:54] him
[1:24:55] now don't you think Jesus has the same
[1:24:58] compassion on you
[1:25:00] as he did them I don't care what the
[1:25:03] situation is I don't care what the
[1:25:04] request is
[1:25:08] Jesus cares about us he cares for you
[1:25:12] Pastor cares upon Him He cares for you
[1:25:16] but you have a part to play if you were
[1:25:19] to just sat on the wall you
[1:25:21] probably would watch Jesus go by
[1:25:26] or if you cried out once and you said
[1:25:29] God I need you in church
[1:25:30] and everybody kind of looked at you at
[1:25:32] the long necks
[1:25:35] maybe Jesus would have went by
[1:25:38] but they kept calling until Jesus said
[1:25:41] what would you have me to do
[1:25:43] sometimes it takes a little bit not that
[1:25:46] God doesn't see us cry out the first
[1:25:48] time he wants us to give a little bit
[1:25:50] more
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:53] now we have our own personal deliver
[1:25:55] here in 2023
[1:25:59] amen we don't have to go back and wish I
[1:26:02] was back then with Jesus because Jesus
[1:26:04] is here
[1:26:06] it's purposeful that he doesn't appear
[1:26:09] In the Flesh like he did before
[1:26:12] and Paul said we we don't uh we knew
[1:26:16] Jesus in the flesh but we don't know
[1:26:18] Jesus Anymore in the flesh
[1:26:20] they that know Christ they know him in
[1:26:24] the spirit amen right
[1:26:26] and and and and
[1:26:30] we need to look for God in the spirit
[1:26:33] now it's not here well this invisible
[1:26:35] thing it's right here
[1:26:37] this is Jesus is knocking on the door of
[1:26:41] your heart and that's where he'll meet
[1:26:43] us every one of us well brother John
[1:26:45] Jesus is in my heart yes he's in your
[1:26:47] heart but I just want to ask you a
[1:26:49] question brother sister
[1:26:51] is he got full control of your heart
[1:26:54] is he in every door of your heart
[1:26:57] I think he's knocking at the door he
[1:27:00] wants to have more preeminence I believe
[1:27:03] that with all my heart
[1:27:05] Psalms 86 3 Psalms 86 verse 3 be
[1:27:08] merciful unto me O Lord for I cry unto
[1:27:12] thee daily
[1:27:18] it's okay
[1:27:20] you don't have to look like oh yeah you
[1:27:22] got the power of God and everything's
[1:27:23] with you and you're just everything's
[1:27:25] going great your life and look up to me
[1:27:26] no you can just be the real you
[1:27:30] be merciful to me o God I need you
[1:27:34] I need some Deliverance
[1:27:36] I cry unto thee daily
[1:27:38] that's the same thing this woman was
[1:27:40] doing Rejoice for the soul of thy
[1:27:43] servant For unto thee O Lord do I lift
[1:27:46] up my soul
[1:27:48] you know we're not looking for an
[1:27:51] outward body
[1:27:53] we got to lift up our hearts and our
[1:27:54] soul to the Lord amen for thou Lord art
[1:27:57] good and ready to forgive aren't you
[1:27:59] grateful for that
[1:28:01] all we have to do is say Lord I am sorry
[1:28:04] I am sorry I don't if I I'll tell you I
[1:28:08] believe I have said I'm sorry and more
[1:28:11] in the last three days I could say at
[1:28:13] least a hundred times
[1:28:17] well that's a lot just think about how
[1:28:18] many times you said sorry in the last
[1:28:20] three days see how that compares
[1:28:22] we need to be zealous about it
[1:28:25] I am just sorry of how rotten I am
[1:28:29] I'm just rotten
[1:28:32] I can't look at myself in the mirror and
[1:28:34] say you're a pretty good chap
[1:28:37] I just can't do it
[1:28:40] and and I believe we need to maintain
[1:28:45] that Spirit don't you
[1:28:48] for thou Lord art good and ready to
[1:28:51] forgive and plenteous and mercy unto all
[1:28:54] them that call
[1:28:55] upon thee now notice he didn't say unto
[1:28:59] the righteous
[1:29:00] he said to them that call we have a job
[1:29:03] to do give your O Lord unto my prayer
[1:29:04] and attend to the voice of my
[1:29:06] supplications in the day of trouble why
[1:29:08] call upon thee for thou will answer me
[1:29:13] you know we sing a song in his time I
[1:29:16] know a lot of times we pray and nothing
[1:29:17] happens
[1:29:18] but you're just in the process
[1:29:21] you're just in the process it doesn't
[1:29:24] change anything yes we want it to be
[1:29:26] changed right now yes we want what we
[1:29:28] want right now but God is the one that
[1:29:31] decides
[1:29:32] and we should respect that
[1:29:35] Psalms 55 16 as for me I will call upon
[1:29:38] God and the Lord shall save me look at
[1:29:41] these beautiful scriptures evening
[1:29:43] morning and at noon will I pray and cry
[1:29:49] aloud brother John we're in church
[1:29:53] you know
[1:29:55] shhh
[1:29:58] you know if there's any activity in the
[1:30:01] church
[1:30:02] that's praising God
[1:30:05] is quite in order
[1:30:12] even the scripture says aloud
[1:30:15] I will cry aloud don't be afraid to call
[1:30:19] on God you are sitting next to brothers
[1:30:21] and sisters who have the same need
[1:30:24] that's Jesus Christ in your life
[1:30:27] just be yourself
[1:30:30] Hallelujah
[1:30:32] I love this word he
[1:30:34] Verse 18 he have delivered my soul in
[1:30:37] peace from the battle that was against
[1:30:40] me
[1:30:41] for there were many
[1:30:43] with me God will give us peace in our
[1:30:46] situations
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:49] now we need to call upon the Lord more
[1:30:50] we need to cry out to him we need to get
[1:30:52] desperate if I as I've said sometimes
[1:30:55] we're a little too sheepish
[1:30:57] am I saying that right cheapest
[1:31:02] we're we're a little bit
[1:31:04] um I don't know
[1:31:07] kind of like
[1:31:09] like we're too embarrassed to cry out to
[1:31:11] God
[1:31:12] maybe a little too dignified sometimes
[1:31:15] some guys we go to church and we see
[1:31:17] others and we think that that they're
[1:31:19] going to extremes
[1:31:21] like in our mind we've kind of judged
[1:31:23] the situation that this is not proper
[1:31:26] this is not etiquette this is not order
[1:31:31] but maybe they really really are getting
[1:31:35] serious with God
[1:31:37] and it kind of makes us feel uneasy
[1:31:43] there was a group of people in the Bible
[1:31:44] who thought Jesus as followers
[1:31:47] were going to an extreme and we could
[1:31:49] read about it Luke 19 verse 37 if you
[1:31:52] want to they were spreading out even
[1:31:54] their clothes for and and Palms in front
[1:31:57] of Jesus so a donkey and him could write
[1:32:00] on it it looked like a little bit of
[1:32:02] extreme can you imagine
[1:32:06] it's raining somebody runs out there and
[1:32:09] grabs the coat their coat and they put
[1:32:11] it down just so you could walk into
[1:32:12] church that would seem like an extreme
[1:32:14] well this is what was happening
[1:32:17] in Luke 19 verse 37 and when he was come
[1:32:19] nigh even Into The Descent of the Mount
[1:32:21] of Olives the whole multitude of
[1:32:23] disciples began to rejoice and praise
[1:32:25] God with a loud voice
[1:32:28] for all the mighty works that they had
[1:32:31] seen
[1:32:34] the problem is when you stop looking at
[1:32:36] him you stop praising keep looking at
[1:32:39] them saying blessed be the king that
[1:32:43] cometh in the name of the Lord peace in
[1:32:45] heaven and glory in the highest
[1:32:49] and some of the religious Pharisees from
[1:32:53] among the multitude
[1:32:55] said unto Jesus
[1:32:57] master
[1:33:00] review thy disciples
[1:33:02] they're out of order
[1:33:05] rebuke them
[1:33:07] and he answered and said unto them I
[1:33:09] tell you if they should hold their peace
[1:33:12] the stones would immediately cry out
[1:33:16] now this scripture tells me how much God
[1:33:19] wants me to praise him
[1:33:21] that's what this scripture tells me
[1:33:24] and then if I don't do it he's going to
[1:33:26] get it from somebody else
[1:33:29] God wants to be praised
[1:33:31] personally
[1:33:32] in spirit and Truth the Bible says
[1:33:34] that's what he's looking for
[1:33:37] it might seem
[1:33:39] that God's taken a long time to help us
[1:33:43] but he's
[1:33:45] in the process of helping us he's he may
[1:33:47] be looking for us to get in our proper
[1:33:49] place of just calling on them
[1:33:52] that's between you and God I just know
[1:33:54] that God's faithful
[1:33:56] I know we entertain a lot of thoughts
[1:33:58] that God's not with us and God's not
[1:33:59] going to do this and I wonder what's
[1:34:00] going to happen with this but I'll tell
[1:34:02] you God is faithful
[1:34:05] and that's all that matters
[1:34:07] we go up and down
[1:34:09] but God Remains the Same
[1:34:12] now
[1:34:14] who is our adversary
[1:34:18] can I want to shoot that clock for until
[1:34:21] I'm done
[1:34:22] laughs
[1:34:24] who is our adversary
[1:34:28] it's good we got two good answers we
[1:34:30] have two adversaries
[1:34:31] the first the Bible says that that old
[1:34:34] serpent called the devil and Satan who
[1:34:36] deceiveth the whole world
[1:34:41] and
[1:34:43] Peter brings them out just like this in
[1:34:46] in First Peter chapter 5 verse 7 and you
[1:34:49] just you know this scripture
[1:34:52] just like the widdle woman who pleaded
[1:34:54] with the unjust judge
[1:34:56] he tells us to cast all of our cares
[1:34:58] upon free careth for us so I say keep
[1:35:01] asking keep pleading keep knocking keep
[1:35:05] crying out spend more time in the prayer
[1:35:08] closet
[1:35:09] yes spend more come to church early and
[1:35:12] pray
[1:35:17] be sober now look at this verse eight
[1:35:19] that's what I want to get to
[1:35:20] be sober he wants every one of us to be
[1:35:23] on alert be vigilant because your
[1:35:26] adversary the devil as a wrong line he's
[1:35:29] walking about seeking whom he can get
[1:35:32] right
[1:35:33] and he wants to devour you
[1:35:36] now we know he's a lion without teeth we
[1:35:39] do know that
[1:35:41] but we see his purpose he still wants to
[1:35:44] devour us
[1:35:45] now he can't come and
[1:35:48] on his own will
[1:35:50] and chop us
[1:35:54] but he can get you in a weak State he
[1:35:56] can keep gnawing at you get it none on
[1:35:59] you without teeth
[1:36:01] to get you in a weak state to where you
[1:36:03] just don't feel like trying
[1:36:06] you've got a reason not to praise God
[1:36:08] you've got a reason not to call on God
[1:36:11] and you know what you never get stronger
[1:36:13] in that state did anybody ever do that
[1:36:16] and say well I did the right thing I
[1:36:18] feel so strong in the Lord right now
[1:36:20] no the devil brings you down more
[1:36:23] and that's why we need to be
[1:36:26] sober
[1:36:27] because our our adversary the Devil he's
[1:36:30] walking around waiting to catch somebody
[1:36:32] in that condition
[1:36:35] he even told Peter Jesus told Peter that
[1:36:37] Satan has desired to sift you like wheat
[1:36:39] but I prayed for you what was the answer
[1:36:41] prayer
[1:36:43] prayer was the answer that our faith
[1:36:46] failed not when he comes shall he find
[1:36:49] faith in the earth we need to pray
[1:36:51] amen men ought to pray and not faint men
[1:36:55] ought always to pray and not faint
[1:36:59] prayer was the answer to Faith not
[1:37:03] failing
[1:37:04] so look at verse 9 who resists steadfast
[1:37:07] in what the faith
[1:37:09] resist him in the faith that isn't like
[1:37:12] this big powerful thing coming on you
[1:37:14] Jesus I rebuke you in Jesus name
[1:37:18] no you just simply
[1:37:20] no I'm not entertaining that
[1:37:24] resist him in the faith I'm staying with
[1:37:26] the what the word says about me not how
[1:37:28] I feel not my sickness
[1:37:32] not what's going on I am staying with
[1:37:34] the word whom resists steadfast and
[1:37:37] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[1:37:41] don't tell me yours is worse the same
[1:37:44] afflictions are accomplished in your
[1:37:46] brethren that are in the world
[1:37:50] we're going through things we need to be
[1:37:51] praying for one another
[1:37:54] but the grace of God which have called
[1:37:56] us unto his eternal glory by Christ
[1:37:58] Jesus after you have what
[1:38:00] suffered a while
[1:38:03] what was that woman doing going to the
[1:38:04] judge suffering a while
[1:38:06] make you perfect strengthen I'm sorry
[1:38:10] establish strengthen and settle you
[1:38:12] that's that's God's desire for our lives
[1:38:15] but there's a purpose in our suffering
[1:38:17] we don't know always what it is but
[1:38:19] there's a purpose he's just looking for
[1:38:21] us to stay connected to him
[1:38:24] do you believe that
[1:38:27] now we have adversaries
[1:38:34] and neither of them
[1:38:36] we have two adversaries and neither of
[1:38:38] them
[1:38:39] are your brother and your sister amen
[1:38:42] how many times do we spend time thinking
[1:38:47] about a human being when we're thinking
[1:38:50] about our enemy
[1:38:56] that is not the Holy Ghost
[1:38:59] a bit
[1:39:01] that's the enemy trying to
[1:39:04] start something and then he just steps
[1:39:06] on the way and he just lets him go at it
[1:39:11] then we become a tool
[1:39:13] we become a tool in the devil's hands
[1:39:19] then it starts
[1:39:25] now
[1:39:27] the devil has most people trained to
[1:39:29] recognize
[1:39:30] the devil in other people's lives
[1:39:34] while not even recognizing the devil in
[1:39:37] their own mind
[1:39:43] but we have another adversary and that's
[1:39:45] us
[1:39:46] brother Brandon said that you are your
[1:39:49] greatest enemy so if you take between
[1:39:51] the devil and yourself
[1:39:53] you're the greatest enemy
[1:39:57] because brother random taught us that
[1:39:59] the devil can't do nothing unless he's
[1:40:01] got someone to work through
[1:40:03] and when you lend your mind over to the
[1:40:06] devil just like Eve lent her mind over
[1:40:09] to the most subtle Beast
[1:40:13] and the most subtle Beast lent his self
[1:40:15] over to the devil
[1:40:17] as soon as you lend yourself over to the
[1:40:20] devil's way of thinking
[1:40:22] you now have become your greatest enemy
[1:40:28] but if you keep the devil out of you
[1:40:31] be filled with the Holy Ghost burning on
[1:40:34] fire for God bubbling with the joy of
[1:40:37] the Lord the love of God just springing
[1:40:39] out of you
[1:40:40] man but you know the devil just looks at
[1:40:44] you as a 5 000 watt voltage and just
[1:40:47] or 25 000. you know what I'm trying to
[1:40:49] say he just wants to stay away from you
[1:40:54] because he's no match
[1:40:56] for God
[1:40:58] but the devil's a match for every one of
[1:41:00] us
[1:41:01] that's why we have to be filled with the
[1:41:04] Holy Ghost
[1:41:05] we have to be filled now look at here's
[1:41:07] what Jesus told us how to take care the
[1:41:11] over of the adversary and our life in
[1:41:13] Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and I'm I am
[1:41:15] like so close to closing here so you
[1:41:18] please bear with me Luke 9 verse 23 and
[1:41:20] he said unto them all if any man will
[1:41:22] come after me let him deny himself
[1:41:26] take up his cross and follow me
[1:41:30] if you don't deny yourself in your
[1:41:32] situation
[1:41:33] the devil is going to get in there and
[1:41:36] he's going to cause you to think
[1:41:37] negatively that's true amen I mean I
[1:41:40] believe we should be hearing a lot more
[1:41:41] amens
[1:41:43] I I know this is not maybe I want to
[1:41:46] really feel good but I'm telling you
[1:41:48] it's the truth
[1:41:50] deny yourself daily Paul said I Die
[1:41:54] daily
[1:41:55] make it your personal habit
[1:42:02] um
[1:42:02] to make God your personal deliverer
[1:42:06] if you stay alive and I'm going to take
[1:42:08] care of this and I'm going to do this
[1:42:09] and I'm going to show them and I'm going
[1:42:11] to not shake their hand and I'm gonna
[1:42:14] how is God going to be your personal
[1:42:16] deliverer amen
[1:42:19] you can't you we got to call on God with
[1:42:22] the same
[1:42:24] the right spirit
[1:42:27] and God will see us through we gotta
[1:42:29] not lean to our own understanding it not
[1:42:32] be wise in our own eyes not just I'm
[1:42:34] gonna I'm gonna do it my way no deny
[1:42:37] yourself trust in the Lord believe in
[1:42:40] the power of prayer that when you pray
[1:42:42] it that prayer is set towards heaven and
[1:42:45] God will answer that prayer no matter
[1:42:47] how you feel no matter what it looks
[1:42:49] like no matter if it hasn't rained for
[1:42:51] 120 years no matter if the fire is seven
[1:42:53] times hotter no matter if the lions are
[1:42:55] growling in the in the in the den
[1:43:00] you just got to believe it's all about
[1:43:03] believing
[1:43:05] God will see us through let's Stand
[1:43:06] Together
[1:43:14] we are our greatest enemy for one reason
[1:43:19] we I always used to say and I believe
[1:43:21] this it's our nature right our first
[1:43:24] nature I'd like to say it like this I
[1:43:27] don't want to blame
[1:43:28] it just kind of takes the responsibility
[1:43:30] off my hands but my greatest sentence me
[1:43:32] is myself because I lend myself over to
[1:43:35] the devil
[1:43:36] and if I can control that that means the
[1:43:40] devil can't control me
[1:43:43] we need to understand that God is here
[1:43:46] to fill us with more of himself
[1:43:50] to be a personal deliverer in our lives
[1:43:52] with any situation that we have
[1:43:56] and I'll say it like this do not wait
[1:43:58] for God to come by and kind of give you
[1:44:01] a little Ray of Hope that it looks like
[1:44:04] it's almost over
[1:44:07] what I want you to do is believe that
[1:44:10] it's almost over
[1:44:13] and praise him for it
[1:44:15] thank him for it
[1:44:17] and when you start to feel this
[1:44:19] overwhelming power to try to subdue you
[1:44:22] into a depression call on God
[1:44:25] call on them and I want you to thank him
[1:44:28] for remembering you thank him for being
[1:44:31] your personal deliverer
[1:44:34] because that's what he come to be
