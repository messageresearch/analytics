here to receive of the lord this morning so good to see everyone's shining faces it's been a while since we've been able to preach for you and uh we're so glad to be able to assist brother john as he's enjoying i'm sure what's some much needed and well-deserved rest so we're happy to be here with you it's uh i think last time we were here we weren't here but we were in the old building and so now we see what the lord has blessed you with we've heard of it being the work in progress for so long and now we can see what the people of the lord have done for their god and for one another and it's just such a beautiful place so we were so disappointed that when the call came out for the dedication services came we had already committed ourselves for that date and another way so we're happy to be here and this is our first service in the new tabernacle with you so i hope that that same kind of sense when you had the first service we could have again together today and you just pull on the word and we'll have a good time together all right let's go ahead and go before the lord dear precious heavenly father we just come before you lord just desiring to be faithful to what you've given us lord and your word father me to preach it lord and all of us to receive it as we open your book lord i pray that you would open your heart to your people lord and may they open their hearts to you father grant it lord we pray and may you rule and reign the day into our hearts in jesus christ's name praise the lord if you would go ahead and turn over with me and we'll go straight into the word uh we'll go to um start in james chapter 1 and also on song of solomon chapter 2. and when you've got james one there you just go ahead and say amen if you would praise the lord just uh i wanted to approach the scripture in a little bit of a different way than i have in the past just on the plane flight last sunday and we just felt the lord dropped this thought into our heart we want to be faithful to what the lord's given us ever everyone have james 1. all right in james 1 it says every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and when that lust has conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it's finished brings forth death over in song of psalm solomon chapter 2 verse 15 we have a much different picture where this ends on death song of solomon's picks up in life and we'll actually take it back to verse 10 for some context here song of solomon verse 10. i'm just enjoying the spring weather here today i think this song beckons to that time he says i'm sorry song two uh verse 10. and the bride and the bridegum are singing back and forth to each other here and she says my beloved spay can said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for lol the winter is past and the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth and the time of the singing of the birds has come i i just walked outside my house this morning i heard those birds singing we're in that time aren't we we can kind of feel sympathetic towards these two lovers here the flowers appear the sign the time of the sing of the birds come in the voice the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree put forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away o my dove thou art in the clefs the rock and the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance is that your desire this morning amen let me see thy countenance oh lord let me hear thy voice so for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely take us the foxes here's the verse i'd like to focus on take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes may the lord bless the reading of his word he may be seated i like to preach on little foxes and tender grapes this morning little foxes and tender grapes now just to give a little bit of context what foxes have to do with grapes because you're probably thinking when you read this first like i was that you know foxes they they eat live things don't they eat meat and they're predators what are they doing with little grapes but it turns out that foxes like to mess around with things they'd like to get in things they shouldn't and mess with things they shouldn't and they they gnaw on the little um great barbers and it causes the life of the grapes to fall out and they they dig little holes all around they dig up their roots with their little paws and all those naughty things that little foxes ought not to be doing they have a terrible detrimental impact to those tender grapes that the bridegroom and the bride are looking to share together in this season of life she says over here rise up look these tender grapes are giving forth a good smell arise my love my fair one come away so they're looking forward to enjoying these tender grapes between themselves but if they're not careful these little foxes are going to come in so i i think that the the heart of the bride today would be the same lord i want to enjoy your tender grapes i want to enjoy your sweet mercies i want to enjoy your sweet countenance i want to sit down and have as it wore a picnic with my god can you imagine a picnic with the creator of heaven and earth that's what he's placing himself in why else would song of solomon be there except it's to show us the type of a relationship between christ and his bride paul said later on i speak to you a great mystery that the church is like a type of the bride to christ and so here we see that god and christ and his bridegroom as it were are looking to enjoy a picnic together they've been working to bring forth all these grapes and no doubt there was a lot of work in the fall to clean out all the leaves and all the garbage and get it ready for the spring sunshine so that when that came they could enjoy the fruit of their labor and sit down and have rest together oh i believe that's what the holy ghost is calling us to is a rest in the holy ghost with christ amen oh that's what i want but then there's something that wants to come along and disturb the rest because it's it's really hard to rest when you're hungry it's really hard to rest when the thing that you wanted to eat together you don't get to enjoy and so there's tender grapes between christ and his bridegroom that he wants us to be able to enjoy think of the fruits of the spirit love and gentleness and gooliness and kindness and longsuffering long-suffering something that he's looking to bring out a character within us a character that levels us up to his character so that we can enjoy true fellowship one with another but then we have these little foxes and i love it that they call them little foxes because it seems like the thing that man thinks is the littlest is oftentimes the thing that causes the most destruction we look over here in the scripture and coming back to to james that he says that every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and then that lust conceives and it brings forth sin and sin conceives and it brings forth finally death so what we thought was just maybe a little lost maybe just a little sin finally ends in death now i want to be very careful here because i believe that the believer who has received the gift of the holy ghost who's been baptized into the body of christ by receiving the divine nature of christ he has passed from death unto life that he comes no longer into the judgment amen but yet our actions are such that if we allow sin to reign in our mortal bodies there's still a law of sin and death which must be complete you look at david and even though he was the anointed of god yet when he sinned with bathsheba not only did he cause the death of of bathsheba's husband but when judgment was visited upon his house it was his own son that death came upon though he was god's anointed though he deserved to be the one that was slain god passed over him but death still had to have its way because there's a law of sin that has to end in death we look out for the scripture and i think we can begin to instruct ourselves that when we approach this this sin question this temptation always it seems it starts with just a small step it's just a little fox maybe we can just let it run around a little bit it's got it's so cute and it's got these cute little kits that it's little babies and i i think it won't do too much harm i kind of enjoy seeing the nature of the little animal and we just kind of let it run its course for a while i wonder if that's maybe what eve thought when she was watching this serpent he's he's he's not such a bad guy he's just a little fox he's just a little foxy he's he's a little naughty and he ought not to do some of the things that he does and he ought not to speak to me about eating that fruit and eating that tree like he does but you know god gave me all these trees in the garden i'm eating 999 trees maybe what's one more what's what's one more tree is it really that bad and then you see that she was began to be drawn away of her own lust right when he began to reason with her and he said well now wait a second you could if you eat of this tree you could be as gods oh you mean god's withholding something from me there's something more that i can have there there's something that god hasn't provided to me yet and i could provide it to myself oh my now it's just a little fox it's just one tree i haven't eaten of why don't i just go ahead and grab a hold of that fruit and you see that from that sin came every death came every death from a child every every war that's ravaging the world right now and has ravaged the world through time every every every wrong sin every ever everything that's ever gone wrong every drug addict every drunkard has come from that one decision of eve because she thought it was a little sin sin has consequences and it starts with a lust it starts with something that i want and i don't have it yet i wonder if nathan and coral when they began to talk about moses and the camp of the israelites if they thought perhaps speaking against moses was that big of a deal when they grabbed 250 some odd princes among the house of israel and approached moses and said moses you're not so holy we're all holy in this camp and why do you set yourself up above all of us and make us as a god or make yourself as a god to us and he began to speak against god's man and he no doubt said well it's just another man it's not a big deal i'm i'm just going to give myself permissions because i want maybe his lust was that he wanted some position or some power he did he was jealous perhaps of of moses but what came of that his whole family his little children all of his tents his wife his his nephews his cousins all of his family his extended relatives all of it was swallowed up within the ground and their ground closed back on him again because he started with a little fox and let it carry his whole family over the precipice of death he didn't think the first time that he sat down in his tent this little conversation between him and his wife was gonna grow to such a place that bitterness would arise in her heart and she'd speak back to him and he'd speak back to her and they'd start squabbling about how moses was doing things that they didn't like and then they had to go and talk to their neighbor about it and before they knew it they had this whole emotion that was now out of control right it was just something that he wanted to maybe share with his wife to start with but now it grows in this whole whirlwind of emotion this whole whirlwind of actions that finally takes all of their lives but it was just a little fox it was just a little decision he spoke against god's man maybe just between him and his wife to start with but he allowed it to grow allowed it to carry him over i wonder what about those little children that when they met elisha on the way and they they said go on up thou bald head they they teased him about being bald and they showed disrespect to god's prophet i wonder about their parents what was it in those children's hearts that would disrespect the man of god so much were there some decisions at home that led to the death of those children as a she-bear came out and swallowed them all up right was there a decision on the part of the parents i'm speaking to you mom i'm speaking to you dad was there a decision at home somewhere around the dinner table they heard what mom and dad said about the prophet criticized him maybe tore down what the preacher said that day at church said i think he's just kind of making a little bit too much of himself getting up on his soapbox a little bit today or maybe it wasn't what they heard at a dinner table maybe it was what they saw around the family movie screen or whatever they had back then that that showed what the hearts of their parents really were they went to church every day but when they came home and saw what the parents watched on the movies they realized that their parents really didn't believe all this maybe they believed a part of it they believed in the healings the miracles of elisha but they didn't believe obviously they didn't believe what elisha taught because their life didn't line up to the teachings of the prophet and so when they finally met that prophet on a road they didn't have any problem showing him disrespect because the lives their parents had already displayed that disrespect on their behalf and they just being kids well you know you know what kids do if you say it at home or you live it at home they kind of what you say in the in your bed chambers they call out on the streets embarrass you sometimes but it's more than just little childless embarrassments here they lost their lives the curse was on the parents because their parents had done something at home that caused this disrespect i don't think that they had ever imagined that whatever that decision at the home front was would carry itself all the way until conceived itself in the death of their children but it did i wonder about ananias and sapphira in the new testament they thought it was just a little thing to lie to paul they didn't discern the lord's body they didn't discern they weren't just lying to the apostle paul but they were lying to the holy ghost and and i asked that they didn't think he wouldn't see his wife again didn't think that she would join him in death later that afternoon but death is what came of that decision so there's an effect to sin it's not just that our sin is just little and tiny but it leads somewhere i think about the the sermon from that time that brother branham preaches he he talks about this man that's a a chronic liar and he sits down with a man and says you know nobody believes your stories why do you do that why do you tell all these stories like you do and the man could go back and say well i remember back when i was a little boy and i was smoking some corn silk cigarettes behind the barn and i wouldn't let my mom know about it so to hide it i would i would eat on some some coffee grounds my mom caught me one day he said and she smelled the coffee on my breath and said you've been trying to hide something what have been you've been doing you've been smoking cigarettes she asked him point blank and he said there was something in me at that time that said tell the truth tell the truth and he overrode his consciousness he said i chose to tell a lie i looked at my mom straight in the face he said i said no ma'am i did not smoke those cigarettes he said from that time and what it began as a perversion of his character until now he was in the side streets and the highways and the byways not even being able to hold down a job from that time so there's there's an effect to our sin friends there's effect to our decisions there's an effect to these little foxes and i think the greatest effect for the believer is that it affects our relationship with jesus christ but the moment we choose to indulge these little lusts the pride of life the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye these little lusts cause us to break fellowship with christ because light can have no fellowship of darkness and holiness can have no fellowship with that which is defiled amen that's why god calls his people to be holy because he wants her to be made of the same fabric that he's made of of the same character of the same nature that's why he gives us his holy spirit so it's not just that we grieve the holy ghost it's that we lose fellowship with god when we indulge the lusts of the flesh now i want to separate this because this is not the lust of of a born-again believer this is not the lust of the soul this is the lust of your flesh it's unredeemed it's you're only going to shake it off you when you leave this flesh when this blessed goes into the earth it will fulfill the law of sin and death this flesh was born in sin shaped in iniquity and it cannot escape death but but if you're born in christ this morning where it whereas the flesh was born in sin and it goes back to sin it goes back and fulfills the law of sin and death he who is born in christ must go back to god there's no way around it but in the meantime are you going to let sin reign within your mortal members or are you going to allow god to baptize you and keep you in his presence keep you in his holy spirit and shoo out all those little foxes well i i want to do a little bit of fox hunting this this morning yeah you ever watch a fox hunt you kind of circle around the horses and everybody gets on with the red coats and it's it's quite an event to do a fox hunt everybody gets out their dogs and they they all go howling and they they blow the big bugle horn well let's just go ahead and blow the bugle horn of god's word a little while let's pick up god's word and and shoot at some fox this morning let's let's get a little bit more specific because we have if if there's sin that's reigning in our lives if there's something that's bringing forth death in our families i don't want that to continue do you if there's something where i look at my family life and i'm saying it's not what it ought to be there's there should be more life happening there there should be more growth happening there should be some continuation of christ that's as i look into christ i'm changed from glory into glory and if i'm not seeing that in my family if i'm not seeing that in my children there's something wrong and i want to find out what it is and then maybe it's not totally off the rails but i want i want my vineyard to be a hundred percent free of the foxes i don't want any sin within me having rain or dominion so let's the first step then is before we get to sin let's recognize what it is that takes us there right it's the lust that's within our bodies within our members the lust of the eye the lust the flesh the pride of life what is that you've got to recognize what it is the lust of the flesh is it's not just clicking around on the internet there is that but the lust of the flesh is anything that has to do with the sensual the the taste the touch the feel the the things that i i just want to have these experiences i i i want that nice maybe that nice car thank you brother i appreciate it maybe i want that nice car because that that would just gratify me that's what i need and we set it up as the end-all and the be-all it becomes a lust to us see so many times we think about lust is as as um as binary it's either forbidden or it's not forbidden that's how we've been taught right that lust is the desire for the forbidden it's either forbidden or it's not forbidden but lust isn't just binary like that lust is about are you going to such an extent that you're going past god's providence for you so for example you can take food we'll take for example god provides our food david said in the psalms i've not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging for bread god provides that food for us but yet we could extend it so much be that it becomes a lust to us that becomes as the sin of gluttony that it's our only satisfaction it's the only thing that we care about or maybe not the only i'll cut you a little bit of slack but maybe it's the principle thing it's the thing that we set our affections on that when we've got a little bit of down time and we're tired or we're maybe a little bit down and depressed it's it's the thing that we turn to i'm going to use gluttony in here as a placeholder for maybe what your lust is but i'm just going to ask that the holy spirit deals with each one this morning and fills in that placeholder and deals with your heart specifically but whereas there are some things that are a necessity like food god provides it but it becomes a lust to us when we exceed god's bounds for it and now we're beginning to forsake what was the natural appetite for food what was the natural appetite for what god had provided to us and now we make it the end-all and the be-all so that now it becomes to even become a perversion to us for example if you have a lust for food now the only thing that you care about eventually is maybe just your sugar foods and you go so far that now the natural appetite is not only exceeded but it's become twisted so that now you're only desiring that sugary sweet thing that gives you that instant high you're not filling your belly like god meant for you to be filled and if you're discerning you can see where this principle that i'm preaching through food can touch many different kinds of lusts and i want the adults in the room to be discerning so there's the natural appetites but we major then on what a minor is by making it our focus in our lives men we can even do this with our own wives you can major on a minor until the only time your focus with your wife isn't the beautiful relationship that god had for you but now it's focused on the evenings and the nights whereas god had this beautiful idea of a marital union this 24 7 and had beautiful grapes of tenderness and care and and and loving relationship to one another and holding each other's hands through life and building one another up and encouraging one another and being a faithful co-partner in life yet if we take one component of god's providence within that and they in in major on that minor now it becomes a lust to us even within the marriage union and pursuing that to its end it becomes a perversion right just like food would be right it's true where you had maybe you started out just really enjoying your steak but as you enjoyed your food more and more and made that your end-all be-all now the only food that you like is maybe your sweet treats and you keep pursuing this to your own detriment until what happens begin to fill out our hearts begin to corrode over because we're not eating the right kind of foods we're taking in the sweets and the fats and and going with an imbalanced diet that's what lust will do to you so lust is not binary it's not satisfied with just convincing you to grab a hold of that which is forbidden at the outset but lust is perfectly pleased to get you to take that which god provides and focus on it so much until it goes beyond what god's providence would be for it you can take this with many different types of loss we talked about the lust the flesh and but what about the lust of the eye right what about the things that we like to place our eyes upon that which brings us joy and entertainment the eye is the the window to the soul they say it's it's it you would say well the lust the eye why is why is it not a subset of the lust of the flesh well because the eye is its own special thing because what the eyes see ignites the imagination and it goes straight into the spirit of man so now we we can talk about the lust of the eye and not only maybe the loss of the flesh but what do we enjoy watching what kind of movies are we watching at home is it within the bounds of god's providence or is it going beyond what god would provide is it going into the perverted side of things where now we're allowing ourselves to let in little foxes through our movie entertainment like horror movies and night of the living dead and swear words and man's ideas of what life looks like right through their portrayal of life through the eyes of hollywood and that comes down on our on not only us but it comes down upon our kids and our families and the subtleties that we don't pick up in the disney movies maybe or in the cartoons our kids are picking up and so the question i have for you is your choice of entertainment within god's providence or is it exceeding it such that lust is being enjoined where now this is what your family is defaulting to that it's no longer the family altar that that's been replaced somehow and your family has gone out of balance and that what you default to when you don't have any plans in the evening is just grab a hold of the remote i'm warning you friends this is what we want to steer away from amen i'm not saying that you're not christians because my wife and i have the same conversation in our home is there too many movies are are we watching the right kind of movies do we need to make a course correction it's the world that we live in it's the world that our children live in the world that our grandchildren live in as we're talking with brother keith this is the world that we're growing up in this is the world that our family is growing up in we have to have a little checkpoint sometimes and say you know what i've really been enjoying the grapes in my garden but is there another part of my garden that's not thriving how about how about we just walk around our garden in our hearts this morning and let the holy ghost grab a hold of your hand and maybe walk you through the different rooms in your family and the different times of day that your family would have and what your family practices and habits are and ask yourselves is everything okay here i mean we're waiting for the coming of the lord i i i don't want to be found out of fellowship with him i don't want to be found that i let some of the tender grapes that he prepared for me in this end time message i i let them rot on the vine i let them get spoiled is there something that i need to address because i want to have that relationship with christ amen i i want to have a picnic with my lord and i i i don't want to offer up fruits in that picnic that say well this is all i could find on my great barber this morning everything else was spoiled i'm sorry we'll have to have our our picnic together our our quiet time together another time because i still feel bad about the movie that my family watched last night i just feel so grieved in my spirit i'm not i'm not feeling in oneness with you lord and or or or maybe it's gone so long that you you can't you can say i i just feel like something's off and i can't quite put my finger on it but i just can't seem to have confidence towards my lord like i used to have you ever come to that kind of place i'm just offering up the word to you this morning that you can go back to that place maybe where you left off from the presence of god and pick it back up again friends the lust of the eyes that excite the imagination what we allow ourselves to see what we through entertainment and movies and what we allow ourselves to hear through that right about what we allow ourselves to see on our phones the instagram and the facebook and the twitter and the now they've got the uh all the movie thing that they do help me out here honey yeah the youtubes is another one and the ones where they make the tick tock thank you brother these guys know it i'll tell you what some of the dirtiest things are right on there on tick-tock you just start clicking around enough and you think your kid was watching something cute and they were but all of a sudden something else comes up be careful friends be careful what we allow in our homes in this last day amen because the enemy is foxy he is wily he is he is conniving and he wants to seek kill and destroy if he can't get at you he'll get under you if you're the fence he's going to find a way to dig under that fence if he can't break down the fence and you say i'm strong watch your back because if you're that strong that's fine he's going to find a way to dig under you try to get at your children try to get out those olive plants as the bible says that are trying to grow up around our table be careful amen stay circumspect in this age amen it's your job it's your duty as a parent to be their holy ghost for them until they receive the holy ghost so when we're done watching our own lives make sure that we're watching what's happening with our families amen so we look at the lust of the eyes and what we're looking at but then as as you look at instagram one thing that that amazes me about that is it doesn't just stop with what our eyes set upon it it begins to go into the pride of life right we see what the joneses have and we see their cool car that they've just gotten their nice vacation they just have and if we're not careful what we're setting our eyes upon plays with our imagination until the pride of life starts to enter in well i i want that my they they seem like they're being held in esteem in the church or they're everybody kind of respects them i i want that that's what dathan wanted when he started talking to his wife well that moses he makes himself so holy and so pious and so pontius and i i i think i could be like that too be careful friends i believe it was uh john wesley when he was writing his notes on the pride of life he said that it pertains to that which in the world is held in honor or esteem and that's the same thing that the that was the original sin of satan he got himself lifted up in pride he he wanted to be as the most high be careful what you desire to be be careful what you desire to become be careful what you desire others to see you as our desire should become to be simply become christ not the greatest preacher not the greatest deacon we should want to exercise our jobs well but if our desire starts to become well i want them to hold me in esteem this is where i feel like paul's sentiment oh wretched man that i am who shall save me from this sin condition because i i'll be honest with you i can't hardly buy something nice and let somebody else see it it's just here's what god blessed me with but there's a little trigger in my heart that says i just got this really nice truck i just got this really nice book or this really nice thing and and they're seeing what and how nice it is and there's just something that comes in there this is teaching now that's your flesh that's all right you're not going to get away from it until you bury this thing in the earth and go into the next dimension so don't feel wrong about that paul was saying wretched man that i am who shall save me i thank god through jesus christ his son so we have christ we're born anew so that now there's a law that's now working within our members a law of sin but there's another law the law of christ and eternal life what we have to be careful of with the pride of life is that when that little lust comes up we don't grab it and pet that little fox we don't entertain that pride of life we don't start switching our focus from just enjoying god's blessings to trying to prop ourselves up you see where the difference is you're given an opportunity and a choice at each stage am i going to choose lust and follow it or am i going to just stay humble and meek before god and keep following him as a christian amen another thing about lust is when we think about how that it takes us beyond our natural desires beyond god's providence i want to i want to focus on that just a little bit more because if we go back to the original sin that happened in the garden you have to ask yourself what was eve's deal like what was her problem she had all the trees in the garden that she could eat from she had all the fruits that she could eat from those trees she she she had a husband she had a perfect life she had had she had the garden of eden that we're trying to get back to god's providence was enough lust entered in the picture only when she was convinced otherwise so friends i want to give you a key that if you see lost in your life it's a sign that somewhere along the way you've been hoodwinked that somewhere along the way satan has convinced you in a lie and the greatest freedom that i can provide to you from the word is to show you the lie i could pray over you today and sometimes god will supernaturally deliver a person from their lust if they're trapped in that but oftentimes god wants to lead us out of lust it's a journey back to god and the best way to start that journey is by recognizing the lie that you're in a man that set up his entire life and has to look back and said yes i've set up my entire life trying to acquire riches and lands and wealth and because it's the pride of life he would have to be honest with himself no matter how old he is and look back and said yes my life decisions up to this point have been directed by a pride of life and i am wrong and i repent of it and god help me to make all of my decisions such that i can turn away from that and be humble before you again amen he would have to recognize that all those years of his life were a lie demand is trapped in sexual sin has to recognize that some point that satan's fed a lie to him that there's no satisfaction in that right the man that that that is trapped in and wanting the next big thing the next toy the next the next truck that comes out i'm i'm talking about a truck because my wife's smiling back there because i'm i'm getting a truck we've been i've worked for nine nine years on a toyota truck project and we finally released it and i'm getting it sometime as soon as they can build it for me but if if we make that let's say our end-all deal some some lust of the flesh some desire for acquisition of things because it makes our life nicer and more comfortable and that's what we think we need just a nicer house and a nicer that or a nicer list and maybe you don't have it yet so you can't say well brother jose i'm poor as dirt i don't know what you're talking about but if you're as poor as dirt but your mind is still focused on those things you're poorer than dirt friends god wants to give you his riches and his tender grapes but if you're so focused on what everybody else has on your and you're trying to connive ways to get a hold of it so your life can be that much better if i can just get the new big screen tv and the new big truck and the new big house and the big this and the big vat like our american lifestyle wants us to get you've been fed a lie if there's any lust in your life if there's any little fox that's allowed to run rampant in your life it's a symbol that there's a lie if your family is consuming more entertainment than the word of god you've been fed a lie that that entertainment is more interesting than god's word and no doubt you've reinforced the lie because we try to sit down with a family altar and it doesn't work or it's boring or we fall asleep and we're like well that didn't work i'm telling you yes in the flesh it is more boring but let not lust reign in your mortal members give yourself time to re-learn how to lean back on the spirit man and walk with christ until you relearn those steps with god you might be able to say this morning i i remember the time where i had deep devotion with god and deep times of consecration and prayer and i i remember his spirit but that's long gone and in its place is all the entertainments and perversions of this world and it just and and i'm so busy there's another lie i'm so busy right friends just drop it all believe the word of the lord that you're called for this he's saying to you this morning come away my love my fair one my dove you're hidden in the cliff and the rocks and in the in the secret place the stairs come out come out and enjoy my presence this morning lusts makes a pursuit after that which cannot be satisfied that's what lust does you achieve one thing you get there and it was just a mirage it was just a a carrot on a stick in front of a donkey and you let yourself be the donkey don't be the donkey friends be a child of god this morning god doesn't put carrots on a stick for his people he puts promises in his word which he is faithful and just to fulfill i'm looking at testimonies of god's fulfilling his promise of those that would repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ would receive the gift of the holy ghost where you started in earnest don't continue in vain friends grab a hold of god trust that he which began a good work in you is faithful and just to complete it he who who gave you that great holy ghost experience has more experiences to share that he would satisfy your heart at one time can satisfy it again and maybe you say oh brother josiah my heart is so polluted you don't understand god says confess your faults to him and he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins god wants to have fellowship with you friends and god is a professional cleaner upper of all hearts my god has an amazing track record i can show you the dirtiest man some of the dirtiest men that you're you're singing the songs today of some of the dirtiest man that ever lived amazing grace a slave trader where they would stack human beings five crates high and they would ship them over this seas and they would just have their slot fall out to each other one down the other along the crate stack until they got to the bottom they'd slap it off the side and he treated humans that way and sold them into slavery in shackles and yet god came to him and said i'll deliver you from your shackles until that man could write a song amazing grace how sweet the song if god could do that for an old slave trader don't you think that god can still save you from your lusts and your your your blindness amen you might be able to turn your life on your your eyes on your life and say yes brother josiah i've been blind but i don't know how to get out of it you don't have to get out of it this morning god wants to slay those foxes for you he's just asking you stop petting the fox stop feeding the fox let's take us the foxes the scripture says not take you the foxes not take you the foxes he says god almighty god is present here this morning he says let's take us the foxes he's enjoining himself with you he's saying let me step down the creator of all life and let's take us to foxes let's throw them out together i wonder if you're hearing god's voice to your heart this morning if you would just say to them yes lord yes lord let's let's take us to foxes let's get it out of our lives let's restore the family altar in our home let's restore the quiet place in the mornings where i just have sweet communion with you lord and whatever has to get thrown out that's keeping me from that sweet communion that's keeping my family from that family altar let's deal with it let us take the foxes lord amen the bible says this beautifully and god's desire to satisfy his people in first timothy it says godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and arraignment let us therewith be content let us not divulge into gluttony i i think we could put the scripture this way having god's providence let us therewith be content knowing that god has given us exactly what we need he is jehovah jireh he is the great provider let's not look for anything else but let's say lord let me just come down and enjoy your picnic with you this morning having food in raiment be content says they that fall until be rich fall into temptations snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition says the love of money is the root of all evil and reading in an amplified way i believe you could say that the love of money is the root of many evils but you could say the love of other things as food as many evils our lives do the love of food the love of man's esteem the the love of sensual experiences is the root of many evils which while having some coveted after they've aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of god maybe you're maybe you're here maybe you're maybe you're one of those maybe you're one that's pierced through with many sorrows by your own hurtful loss this morning what does the apostle paul offer up he says thou man of god flee these things he doesn't say get prayed for and anointed with oil and just say hold on all night prayer meeting an altar if that's what it takes for you to flee these things then go ahead and do that but he says flee them flee is not one step it's many steps it's an urgent succession of steps fleeing it says follow after here's what here's your instructions if you're wanting to hunt down any foxes in your life here's your instructions from not from brother josiah from from apostle paul it's worked for believers throughout the ages flee and then follow after righteousness godliness faith patience meekness he says fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life what is your earnest of eternal life this morning it's the holy ghost lay hold on the eternal the eternal life of the holy ghost lay hold on his presence lay hold on his promises for you flee the youthful lost flee the little foxes don't let them have their way in your garden but follow after righteousness recognize the lies of what lust is and to pursue truth in christ that his providence is enough for you this morning that within god's providence he has many beautiful things for you you know that's where lost really breaks down is when we buy the idea that lust can carry us to a place that gets us something that's better than what god has not that what god has wasn't enough maybe i had enough food but this food over here tasted better so i was yes god is the great satisfier but i just think that maybe i can satisfy myself a little bit more if i just step over here and so i eat from this plate but what we find is that when you're eating from lust's provisions it never fills the belly it tastes good in the mouth but it's empty in the belly and you have to go from one plate to another plate to another plate when if you had just stayed over here and cultivated the vineyard of god cultivated what god gave to you cultivated the home that god gave to you the family that god gave to you the wife that god gave to you the time that god gave to you and made the most of what god gave to you it would have bore forth the fruit that you were looking for the whole time amen it would have bore forth the sweet and tender grapes beyond your wildest imaginations god's way takes a little bit of vine dressing it's true you have to work at it you have to tend to the vineyard but the promise is that at the end of the day it bears a fruit it's more than just satisfying they're tender grapes they're delightful to enjoy and what's more is they don't leave you barren forsaken and feeling like you're a prisoner to something prisoner to your phone prisoner to your computer screen prisoner to some trashy novel that your time is wasted in prison but you're left with a sense of wholeness and that's what god wants for his people i'll leave with this scripture as we would stand this morning god offers you you and your family friends his tender grapes and the scripture says that the kingdom of god is this it's not meat it's not drink amen it's not in gluttony it's not in lust amen but it's in righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost he that have these things serve with christ and he's an acceptable unto god and approved of men let us therefore follow after and that's what i'll leave you with this morning if you could make a decision follow after the things that make for peace and edify one another you can't say that of your life right now that it makes for peace that leaves you feeling whole and that peace with god in man that your life edifies your family that edifies yourself that edifies your church the things that you're doing don't meet that qualification then that's not part of god's kingdom and you need to shuck it off and follow god into his kingdom into eternal life and believe believe god's truth over satan's lie that he has enough for you let's pray dear lord jesus we just come before you this morning lord i will admit lord that this world in all of its perversions and its many voices have a way to confuse the mind of even the believer what we look at what we search for and what we seek after but i thank you lord that though this world tends towards a confused mind there's still power within your word to renew our minds in christ jesus i pray that your word would go to each heart this morning lord and begin that renewal process lord they would walk out of this building and if they could recognize some lusts running rampant foxes spoiling their tender grapes at first they would be desirous of those tender graves see them as something that's worth protecting lord and recognize that if they would allow this to continue on it only ends in sin and death and lord may they just have that desire within them lord to reach out and speak to you lord say let us take the foxes today lord let me turn away from sin flee youthful lusts and follow after joy and righteousness and peace in the holy ghost and i'll trust you lord that those vendors those tender grapes will come back granted lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen bless you saints it was such a beautiful word this morning there's any foxes like your brother said in your in your vineyard don't let them run rampant the little things little 11 11 the whole lump so let's do an inventory check today and just measure yourself with god's word not with one another but god's word that's what he's called us to it's a walk between your biggest
