that we could give him amen and I think sometimes about seeing that list of all that I came short to give them I I I don't want to see I don't want to see long things on that list I want to give him what he's worthy of amen amen I believe that your desire today as well um just a couple couple things we did get a report back from sister Sue Bailey um today yesterday she had an appointment to have things uh uh had appointment and during this appointment the doctor said that they feel they can get all the the cancer and it's just going to be an outpatient surgery so that's really you know really good news but the serious situation is for for husband brother Bill that's a very intense uh uh very intense situation um and we got to really hold up uh brother Bill especially amen amen want to say I really appreciate Brother Bruce going and visiting brother Johnson yesterday um that's just that's just what Christians do that's just scripture and uh we really appreciate him doing that uh brother brother um Marty's not with us uh today um today is one year since sister Kathleen had passed away and he is with his um daughter and and Son the family and um we we just love sister Kathleen I telling brother uh Mary uh earlier today that this morning when I was praying for brother Marty and the the children there I just I started praying for sister Kathleen I said Lord would you bless sister Kathleen up in heaven it just it just came out that that desire I I uh I'll say it like this if Sister Kathleen was here let's just uh get into the word and and receive the word of God and and know that our sister is waiting for us to run the race am and get to the other side and as this race comes down to an end there's going to be fewer and fewer people amen amen well turn with me if you would to the book of First Corinthians chapter 15 and we'll have our opening scripture there we're going to start with verse number 50 and read eight or nine verses there 1 Corinthians chapter 15 amen and we'll have a word of prayer starting starting with verse number 50 now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed amen for this corruption must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immoral immortality then shall it be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave Wars th Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ can you say Amen now with this victory that we have therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen and let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we SE Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this this new year that we're starting off 2024 Lord we just need your grace more than we've ever needed it before and we pray father that you would so fill us with your Holy Spirit Lord let it let our cups like like David said that it would just overflow that'd be so much of your Holy Spirit in us that we could we could fulfill your will in our lives father as we look into the scriptures today we ask that you would come and help us as Brother Bruce said to look Beyond the Veil and see you speaking directly to our hearts Lord may your word become revealed to us and may you help us in this year to come may we get the instructions that we need Lord for this year in front of us God we thank you for this we're trusting you now as we wait further upon thee in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen God bless you you may be seated there's a a scripture in the Bible and I would like to read it it's it's uh I'm just going to read it we're not going to put it up on the board you all know it all scripture is given by the inspiration of God Amen and it is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works I believe that this service today is for each and every one of us amen it's not just for a few people it's for each and every one of us and I believe that God wants us to be thoroughly furnished unto all good works do you believe that now we read in our opening scripture that that we're to be steadfast unmovable and always abounding in the work of the Lord for as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord in the book of Hebrews I'm just going to read it uh the writer in the book of he Hebrews said for God is Not unrighteous to forgive get your work and labor of love that you have showed towards his name in that ye have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the End Amen so we can't stop that ye be not slothful this is Hebrews 6:12 that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inher the promises now I want to uh en title this wasting God's time and for a subject being faithful with God's time so as we get into that you'll see why I'm titling this wasting God's time we are let me let me just say it like this the life that we're living is the time that God is has given us amen we didn't make the time up we didn't make our lives up it it's God he made us our lives are bought by God that means our time belongs to God second Peter 38 says but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years amen and a thousand years is one day it's all just one to the lord it's hard to Define eternity am if one day with the Lord is a thousand years for a man then an hour and 55 minutes is equal to an 80y old person now the life expectancy is going down and uh if if you live if we live to 80 we're literally a the average in America a person's life is a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanish away that's right is that what the scripture tells us amen James says go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we're going to go in such a city and continue there and buy and sell and get gain and this is what we're going to do whereas you know not what shall be of tomorrow for what is your life it's even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanished way you ought to say if the Lord will why should we ought to say that because it's not our life to make the decision what we're going to do tomorrow it's God's decision he says but you but now you're rejoicing in your boasting for all such rejoicing he's defines as being evil you're going to take the time that I've given you and then you're going to tell me what you're going to do with it our life is a vapor of Vapor of smoke the whole life 80 years is but a vapor God looks at our life as such a small amount of time it's such a small amount of time our whole life you think about all the things we've done but he looks at it as such a small amount of time the reason I want to bring out this point is if if God expects God has an expectation with the small amount of time that he's given us that we should be able to live it for him amen and that this 80 years or whatever time that he's given us since we've known the Lord that that time needs to be given to him and if we give it to him and we do what he calls us to do to be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord then we'll be called faithful right amen and if we don't then we're literally wasting God's time that he given us have you ever experienced giving someone your time to try to help them or to uh try to teach them or try to get them to do something that you wanted them to do and when you got all done with it you just said well that was a waste of my time absolutely yeah well that's what God is trying to do with us God gives us all his time none of it is ours it's his our life belongs to him our time belongs to him amen and we're all living on the time that God has given to us those that never become fully Born Again truly completely Born Again actually use the time that God's given them for their own life and those that become born again they use the time that God has given him to do God's will is it is that simple turn with me if you would to Matthew 25 I hope you got your Bibles Matthew 25 we got some some b a lot of Bible reading today and I hope that's okay I believe that's what the scriptures are for to to to to make us complete Matthew 25 start with verse 14 Jesus speaking here he says for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country not a close country but a far who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents and to another two and to another one to every man according notice to his several ability and straight way he took his journey then he that had received the five talents went and traded notice traded with the same and made them five other talents now this word traded if you look it up it means to toil to labor to work or to minister about so this ser went and toiled and labored and worked and ministered and we might say is the our opening scripture to be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord amen for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord now he traded with what God had given him with someone the same now notice that he traded with the same now if I have five talents and I trade with you five talents you give me five talents and I trade with you five talents I'm still going to have five talents when I'm done I'm not going to have 10 and the only way I'm going to get five talents from you or a a talent from you is to give you something that you want or else you wouldn't trade right I I mean if I have a a a shoe with a hole in it my toll sticks out I can't trade that to you for your card you're going to say I'm not trading you're crazy so this servant had to give something to somebody that was worth getting the talent back from are you with me and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two but he that received one so there was one out of the three Believers that went and died in the earth and hid his Lord's money it was never his to begin with now no this is a type of Our Lives it's not you know God gave us $1,000 Dollar in the bank and let's go see how we can get another thousand it's not what this is about this money never belonged to him in the first place he hid his Lord's money he had he with the money that God gave him with the talent that God gave him with the time that God G with the life that God gave him he had a responsibility to do something with it amen he couldn't get away with just well I didn't do nothing with it I went and hid you know I went and HIIT it now notice verse 19 after a long time another indication is talking about our life after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckon with them he wanted to get account of what happened with what he gave them so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou deliver unto me five talents behold I gain beside them five Talent once more his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a a few things and I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord now you he's speaking at the end when we when we're we have to give an account well we know entering into the joy of the Lord is heaven and we understand that if we over overcome all things that he'll will he'll make us ruler with him we'll sit on the throne so this is referring to the end now so this this good and faithful servant he had to be good with what God gave him in his whole life now remember you got such a short time to live and in God's sight it's just a vapor right it ain't like well I've got 80 years I can put it off and I can you know start working for the no you're going to see we've we've wasted a some of us have wasted a lot of time now he also that received two talents came and said Lord thou deliver unto me two talents behold I have gained two other talents besides them and his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things and I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord and then he would which had received one Talent came and said Lord I knew that thou w a hard man reaping where thou has not swn and gather where thou has not straw and I was afraid and went and hid thy town in the earth and lo thou has that um there thou has that is thine we don't hide our light under a bushel amen and we don't don't seek to save our life because we're going to lose it and this this man the very fact that he said I was afraid he knew he had a responsibility but he made a choice not to use his life for God and His Lord answered in verse 26 and said unto him notice his Lord the one that he professed thou Wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that I reap where I sold not and gather where I have not strawed God did not view this servant as good or faithful amen God viewed this servant as wicked wi and slothful I looked at that word wi Wicked and it means hurtful or evil influence in other words the attitude that he had of just I I don't need to work for the Lord was a hurtful and evil influence to be around and that word slothful simply means lazy or wanting to avoid activity this servant didn't want to work and God God used strong words you know he still went to church he still called him Lord but God viewed him as wicked and slothful there was no like switzeland in between it was you're on one side or the other amen thou all us therefore to have put my money notice he says my money what I gave you to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received my own with Usery in other words you could have given your life you could have work with somebody who was working for the Lord you could have did something to just work with them help them do what they ask you to do at least I would have got something from your life take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him that has 10 talents for unto everyone that have shall it be given and and shall have abundance but from him that have not shall be taken away even that which he have now look at this statement and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth unprofitable didn't do God any good just wasted what God gave him gave him this and he wasted it amen became identified as an unprofitable servant and was ordered to cast him into outer Darkness well the Weeping and nashing of teeth this refers or represents the time of the Great Tribulation this is called the parable of the talents but I would like to call it a parable of faithfulness God sees two types of servants here one is faithful and the other is wickedly slothful summed up as unprofitable amen Jesus never used the word Unfaithful servant in fact the word Unfaithful is only used one time in the Bible one time in the whole Bible it's in Proverbs 25:19 if you want to write it down and I'll tell you what it means it means faithlessness faithlessness so there was two types of servants one was full of Faith faithfulness and the other was missing Faith amen he he was he didn't have faith to make a decision I'm going to do what God wants me to do I was afraid afraid to give up my life and an Unfaithful servant is usually lazy or avoids activity we've heard the old story uh would you do something for me well it depends what it is tell me first now this man he knew thou knewest I'm going to tell you this faithfulness is a choice unfaithfulness if we could say that is a choice it's nothing more than a choice he that is faithful and little is faithful and much why is that why can I if if God looks at somebody and says well they're faithful at this little thing well they're going to be faithful in much how is that faith fness is simply a choice that we make yes or no I'm going to do it or I'm not going to do it there's nothing more to it than that if we can do little things in our life then we can do big things as well so whether you have one or two talents or God is giving you 10 or 20 faithfulness is simply a choice and nothing more than a choice am now the devil has tricked a lot of people into making excuses about things for some everything becomes an ox in the ditch but it's really not a ditch the Bible says it's a pit because an ox can get in a ditch and get out but if he goes into a pit he can't get out and those pits were used for for holding water and things like that sometimes the covers got off so when people that don't make it to church or they don't pray before service or they don't want to give an offering they're excuses and they think that these excuses makes them exempt from the responsibility that God gave them I know this is strong but I believe in 2024 God wants us to move forward we got to move forward because the things that are attacking us are spirits that are trying to get us to withdraw always remember no matter what excuse we use we made a choice to make that excuse don't make everything about your Ox falling into the pit if you have problems being faithful then make better choices make better choices and don't wait till the till it's too late look ahead if you believe that you're a child of God I believe we do you believe the Bible says that they that are sons of God are L by the spirit of God then you ought to be allowed to stop making excuses and make a better plan amen make better choices for your life we need to learn from the Holy Spirit how to be faithful in just small things start really small don't worry about all these things that are are before you just pick one thing and I'll say that one thing be faithful with prayer be faithful with prayer be faithful to get into the presence of God because if you don't get into the presence of God there's not going to be change in your life am God's presence got to be real to you amen remember this faithfulness you look at somebody that's faithful I'm going to tell you this faithfulness is nothing more than a choice that we make amen I wonder how God feels about our excuses you ever wonder let's read about it Luke chapter 14 let's start with verse 12 Luke Chapter 14 verse number 12 then said he also to him that baade him when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends and thy Brethren neither thy Kinsmen nor thy Rich neighbors lest thou also lest also lest they also bid thee again and recompense be made thee you know a lot of times we want to have a get together you know who we call our friends our Brethren our Kinsmen or somebody that we can profit from and and hoping you know that it's going to be returned to us he says but when you make a feast you call the poor you call the man you call the lame you call the Blind and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for Thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just so in other words we receive a reward on the other side I'm G tell you the devil has shcked me on that one oh yeah you know because God wants us to prosper in this life and you know get all these blessings but I'll tell you you get a blessing on this side you're missing 10 times a what it could be on the other side that's all there is to it just be patient let God reward you on the other side and when one of them sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto to Jesus blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God and then said he unto him a certain man b a great supper and and he B many and sent his servant at supper time to say unto them that we're bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent they began to make excuse for the first said I bought a piece of ground and I must go and I must go and see it I pray have me excuse now notice in their prayer God forgive me I can't make it to church God I'm sorry I got here light I I don't I don't I I I I I don't have time to go on the I you know I just I don't have any more money this week I can't give an offering please have me excused and another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come in other words I don't even need to pray to get excused on this one because this is you know no matter what I married a wife and I am I just can't come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things this is what's happening then the master of the house being angry notice he was angry about the excuses he was angry about the excuses now this is what God thinks about our excuses we think we're okay because we've laid out an excuse look you may never tell me and I may never ask you but to God the excuses makes him angry you have one life it belongs to God you ought to live it for God am that's all there is to it then the master of the house being angry said to his servants go out quickly into the streets into the lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the main and the Halt and the blind even though the Lord was angry about those that made excuses his first attention went to The Obedience of those to go get others focus on getting others to Christ focus on getting others saved God will deal with the slothful and the excuses at the end and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there's room and the Lord said unto the servant go onto the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall even taste of my supper the ones that made excuses are the ones that didn't get to taste of the marriage supper of the Lamb I'll say like this let's start looking at our excuses and call them out for what they are I'm going to tell you they're not oxes in the ditch all the time or oxes in the pit they're not hey if you're if you can't start your car and there's no way to get to work and you've called somebody to ask or you called somebody not to get to work but to come to church and you called somebody they ask for a ride and you can't get there you know I think God understands but you start taking that and you start using that as an example why you just can't be faithful in your life you know what you're doing you're taking the one thing that God has given you and not being faithful to him with you know you you may think you've got tons of years to get start getting faithful but you don't in God sight he looks at you as an hour and 50 m 55 minutes it's a vapor he didn't give you 300 years down here to live faithful he only gave you a short time and he expects you to live faithful to him amen I want to say this you can't get faithfulness back write that down you cannot get faithfulness back you can be forgiven you can get justification back but you can't get faithfulness back you have just One Life to prove to God you're faithful and you got to prove it with your life amen you can sin for a while and when you're done sinning you can ask God to forgive you and if you're sincere the Bible says if you confess your sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so we can become justified in the sight of God just as if we never did it to begin with but we cannot ever become faithful when we haven't been faithful I want that to sink in it's a strong comment but look you when it when it came down at the end Jesus looked at their life and they had to give an account what they did with their life amen this is what I got to give you this is what I'm showing you there's no excuse that yeah I was afraid no I don't care if you're afraid and I don't care that time that God gives us is for his kingdom you can't get it back you can't get time back that means you can't get a a an opportunity to be faithful when you already wasted it we only have one life to use the time that God has given each of us if we end up using on ourselves we'll end up wasting God's time it's God's time and I want us you know the Bible says teach us to number our days you know there's wisdom in in numbering our days there's wisdom in realizing that the time that you're using right now don't belong you it belongs to God are you going to use it for him or you going to use it for you now look there is a difference between look we all have to work we all have to cut the grass we all have to shovel the snow when we get it today I walked out of the steps and I tell you see I I hit that steps and I just went I landed Brother Bruce I I was there for a while the pain was so great that I could not move it was so great so sometimes we have to Salt the steps but you know there is nothing that we should ever put before the work of the Lord nothing it must come first Colossians 1:16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones dominions principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and notice for him right that means I and you were created for him I was was not created for trust a to I was not created for the customers that trusted two serves I was created for God Amen so whether I work at McDonald's or I work at trusted two I belong to God my time belongs to God so I wonder what is the purpose that he created us for so when I walked into church tonight I looked at the little calendar over there Ephesians 2:10 was on there so I'm going to write that down for we are his workmanship right created in Christ Jesus unto good works now I love this part which God have before ordained that we should walk in them that's right this was his plan that he could take our lives and use it for his glory right so the more filled we are with the whole Holy Spirit I believe the more that we'll be using the time that God has given us for his purpose if we end up using his time or the time he has given us for our lives then we will lose the only chance that we have to be considered faithful by God look when it comes down to it is he going to just say I I'm faithful and I was good because I was covered by the blood because I ask for forgiveness no he's going to look at my life and the decisions I made every day with my time he's looking at the whole the whole thing which to us is a big thing but to him it's a vapor right amen it's it's nothing to him how can you compare our lives with eternity you we could live to 120 but it's a vapor it's nothing and he has this expectation that your time is his time your life is his life and we need to live it for him I'll tell you I I want him to say faithful to me I want to hear thou faithful I know there's nothing good in me outside of what is God but I have a choice to make whether I'm going to be faithful to the word of God or I'm not going to be brother brandom said in the message I know my redeemer liveth he says and we come on such a morning to gather hopes some new hopes of what we are here for and what is the purpose and I think that this is a wonderful time to think on the hopes that God has given us now we want to draw this first into our minds that there is not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who has created us has been fulfilled I love that quote there could be nothing we are made for a purpose this church was built here for a purpose this Foundation was not dug or the Cornerstone laid or the blocks laid into the building in the roof and the interior was not put there just to see if it could be done it was put there for a purpose for a purpose now in the world hey they don't even know why they're born they don't even know why they're alive but we know God chose us one out of a million that we got a purpose that's right and that purpose is to fulfill his will we got to get serious about it we got to spend some time about it Lord help me to be faithful with the few things you've given me in my life right now everyone has a distinct role to play No Doubt God has equipped all of us with what we need to carry out a role amen 1 Corinthians 12:11 says God has divided up gifts to every man severally as he will so he just gives us some two some 10 some one he's given us what we need so God has given us all of us he's given us one time we've all got time and he's given us different abilities and different gifts but he's given us all one time amen and that's what we got to be faithful to well I'll say it like this if you give your time to God you will give your gifts to God you will give your talents to God yes you will be let God use you in any way he sees fit I always like what the god a minister said one time uh I think some Minister said it I don't know but I know I've said it God don't want your wallet he wants your heart if he gets your heart he'll get your wallet he'll get everything with you amen now no one can take our place no man can do the job that God has ordained you to do now we will either be found faithful or Unfaithful in what he has purposed in our lives now that's just the bottom line the blood is not going to cover it the blood is not going to say okay well uh you you were uh you're all faithful if we're faithful then let's be faithful amen come on if we're faithful then let's just be faithful amen let's not be unfaithful and then say we're faithful let's be a Christian let's be real about it right now I don't know what God has ordained you to do but I do know it's something God would never ordain us to sit around spiritually idle God has expressed in his word that he wants us to occupy until he comes so therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding not in your work but the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord but I tell you if the Lord ain't in it in other words you make the wrong choice don't expect God to bless it I mean don't work Sundays and say don't work Sundays if you're not told you have to work Sundays and if you are told to work Sundays then you need to check to see if God doesn't have something better for you because he don't want you to work Sundays the thing is sometimes we have to but you know what some of us begin to make excuses of what we're going to do on the Sabbath be faithful be faithful the word encourages us to be faithful to the word now we only have one chance at life to fulfill his purpose to be found faithful now we believe that we've been called to live a life of service for the Lord the brother Ram says that eternal life is living for others amen now God doesn't want us to just do things for God he wants a service to him a life to him there's a big difference between I'm going to do this for God I'm going to do that for God then I'm going to go live my life that is not a faithful servant I want God to deal with our hearts of course there's many that are not here and I hope that there's people listening this sermon that has never been in this church before because I believe it's the truth God doesn't want us to occupy with our own things he want us to occupy with the things of God we were created for his glory his purpose and to do the things that he wants us to do you know we hardly have time to fit God in our lives especially around the holidays right you know I wish there was you know more people here that just say Amen but you know what we could what we could do is we could just say Amen a little bit more than it would help you know the Bible says look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others amen that's what I liked about you know brother Bruce going to see brother Johnson he was looking on another man's things Paul said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus we need the mind of Christ we need to see things the way the scriptures are teaching us to see them if we stay occupied with our own life or doing our own things in our life what's going to happen is we're going to miss what God has for us we're going to miss the very purpose that he ordained us for 1 Corinthians 1:7 says so that ye come behind in no gift that's right I love this scripture so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus he don't want you to come behind in any gift that he's given you he wants you to use what he's given you amen who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord amen turn with me to Luke Chapter 191 we got some more scriptures to get through and I just I want the Lord to give us timed about to get through them that means I need to go through them quicker and I'll go through quicker if you say Amen quicker all right Luke 19 vers1 and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to Jerusalem because they thought the kingdom of God should immediately appear and he said unto them a certain noble man went into again a far country to re receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his 10 servants and delivered them 10 pounds that's one pound per servant not five two and one but each one got one this time and said unto them I want you to occupy till I get back but now notice but the citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to rule over us so this this message here is really indicating that these servants who had to go and occupy were really dwelling in a city of of great selfishness that people did not want the Lord Jesus to Reign Over their hearts so it wasn't an easy task for them to do are you with me and it came to pass as they went uh and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by here it is again trading so God is expecting these 10 servants to trade what was delivered unto them for something more now there's no way that God was expecting these t servants to be to learn how to be stock Brokers to to to know how to to to to take money and get money I'm sorry we're not all called to do that some of us are just just simple Carpenters we don't know anything about money we don't know how to be a stock broker or to go into trading so this is not what he's talking about he's talking about time time occupy till I come and that word occupy to means to busy oneself or to trade oneself not money Amen to trade oneself will you keep your time for yourself or will you trade it to spiritually build the kingdom of God just think about it what one thing can you give to someone that you'll get back you give your life to present Christ to somebody and if they accept Christ then you win them that is a Jew in your crown that is what God looks at as a faithful servant then came the first saying Lord thy pound have gained 10 pounds and he said unto them wow thou good ser vant now notice this because thou has been faithful here is the whole reason that God is calling him a good servant is because he was faithful he was faithful in a little have thou authority over 10 cities amen and the second came saying Lord thy pound have gained five pounds this one life G gained five the other one that one life gained 10 and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities Jesus says behold I come quickly my reward is with me to give every man according to his work and another came saying Lord behold here is thy bound I've kept it light up in a napkin for I feared because Thou Art in Austria man thou take us up where thou layest not down and rapest where thou this not s and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will I judge thee notice out of his own mouth and he says Thou Wicked servant now he didn't take this one thing and go kill himself he didn't just put it in the dumpster and it was destroyed he took it and he wrapped his own will in his life he did what he wanted to do and God viewed that as a wicked servant thou knewest what I expected that I was an Austra a man make taking up that I laid not down reaping that I did not sow wherefore thou gavest wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming I might have required my own with Usery why don't we just give we don't know what to do ask somebody who's working for the Lord what you can do because honestly God can lead every one of us to go to a soul we don't really need to be told by anybody what to do we just need to go do it we can't be afraid of of of being turned down we can't be afraid that we're going to get rejected we can't be afraid well I'm not going to be able to watch my favorite TV show we just need to be faithful amen amen to God it's his life it ain't mine these are not my words these are God's words amen and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that had 10 pounds and they said unto him Lord we don't understand he already has 10 PB for I say unto you that unto everyone which have shall be given and for him that have not even that he have shall be taken away from him but those mine enemies which would not that I should Reign Over them bring hither and I bring hither and slay them before me can you believe that this God of love is going to actually slay the ones that would not let him rule in their heart one day every knee is going to Bow every tongue's going to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord at that time it's too late but he'll still expect it you notice that he'll raise them up in that day and at that day they have to do it but it won't you know because his word cannot return void amen amen it cannot return void but now look we have a chance to serve god with our lives it it it's it's it's just not Church attendance it's just not giving ties it's it's it's your whole life and God is wanting you to take the talents the time the ability everything that God has placed in your heart and in your life to use it for a for to go win a soul for him that's it is that's all that matters and I'll tell you when you do it you'll get all heaven rejoicing amen all heaven will be rejoicing because of what you did now we know who the enemy is right the enemy is our carnality I say let's not waste any time that God has given us let's not waste the time that God's given we don't even have a promise of tomorrow so I want us to consider have we used the time that God has given us wisely are we waiting for something I'm going to tell you what's happened to me I was waiting for something to happen don't wait use the time that God's given you and give it all to him amen he made you for a purpose to use you not 10 years down the road not next year not after you get over this hump today is the day today is the day right now is the time it's your attitude see now look here's the thing I want you to fear I want you to fear that your life is being wrot right now is he going to say by what you're doing right now every day that you're a good and a faithful servant or is it to say you're Wicked because it's a reality I think about it I think about it I I don't I don't look at my who am I to say I'm faithful I'm sorry that's not my job that's really good that's God's [Laughter] job and I don't want your approval I don't want man's approval I don't want to hear from a thousand people that I'm faithful I don't want to hear from anybody I want to hear from God that's all I want to K that's all that matters so don't waste the time that God has given you amen let's remember we only have One Life to Live and only one life to be found faithful God is not going to judge us on a on a scale well you were faithful you know 50% of the time it's our life take inventory the time that God has given us to live for his service we need to take seriously the responsibility with our time it's not just us to do what we want to do with fear God lord what would you want me to do with your time I I'm be honest with you we have gotten to a place where we just we got here's God's time I'll give them this here's God's 10% here's God's time and here's my time here's my money here's what I'm going to do well maybe God wants you to do more ask him take time to say Lord do you want me to do anymore do you want any more of my time what would you have me to do do not say I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna go there and I'm gonna do don't do that that's sin he calls that sin say Lord what would you have amen what would you have Lord they that win souls is what wise they that win souls is wise Daniel 122 says and Men many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall wake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt in other words some are faithful some Unfaithful amen and they that be wise amen shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever brother Bram says if you your hand was involved in the one that brought salvation to somebody you will forever be attached to them even look let me just say it like this let's say that you were actively involved and you got Bob saved and Bob went and got Kathy saved and Kathy went and got uh Judith saved well I'm telling you you're attached to every one of them you're attached to them because it was through you that it came James 5:20 says let him now let's stand together let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the heir of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins I want to get in the converting business it's the best business to be in amen you got to go through a lot to convert somebody I'll say it like this the the more that we can pray Lord lead me Lord use me I think the more will be in his footsteps being directed by him but until that happens just occupy occupy he notice when he he went to a far country he says occupy till I come he didn't give him a lineup every day what to do now there there's an there's an expectation God looks at us is mature enough to set time aside to go work for the Lord and if we do our life will be faithful and if we don't do that we won't be faithful and those are the choices that we have I I hope that this word has spoke to our hearts amen amen this is not a calling out of who's faithful and who's not what this is a is a calling out for God wanting us to be faithful that's what this word is and showing in the scriptures that we have to give an account for our lives amen let's bow our hearts in in a word of prayer before we begin to to sing just say wherever your your your heart is uh concerning this message that you heard today whatever God has spoken to you if you don't feel you've even heard from from God like you didn't feel a conviction you didn't feel a leadership you didn't feel anything that I I want you to just pray God speak to me because his his word was sent for a purpose I believe this is for each and every one of us today I I I I tell you I really appreciate all your faithfulness in the Lord just knowing that if you weren't even here there there would be no one to preach to so you're your faithfulness to the house of the Lord I appreciate it how much more does the Lord appreciate a life live for him so whatever the Lord has has spoke to you just hold it before him as we go to him in in prayer and and let's believe that that God will give us the grace that we that he's Desiring us to have to fulfill our purpose that he's he's ordained us to to to have in while we're here and in the short Vapor Heavenly Father Lord we we're very grateful for your grace Lord we're grateful for your blood and we thank you for cleansing us washing us forgiving us of all of our sins Lord and getting us to a place that we could have fellowship with you we could be uh in your presence and be one with you and father often times in the busyness of life and we forget that our time really belongs to you and Lord for that we're sorry we're for that we repent for that we ask God would you help us would you remind us every day that our life and our time belongs to you and Lord I believe that if you Lord as we desire to be found faithful multiplying uh Souls nting souls and winning souls for your kingdom in this this next year I believe Lord that you'll make a way for us to do that I pray that you take our desire Lord that we're placing before you Lord would you help us to fulfill the part of the will Lord that perhaps might be slipping Lord in any one of our lives in any ways Lord we want you to look down upon each one of us Lord when we get on the other side we want to hear those words well done thou good and faithful servant Lord we're I know that I'm not wanting to uh rule over anything on the other side I know there's just that desire just to please you on this side because I know that I have fallen so short in that department Lord I I I've fallen so short of of doing all that you've asked me to do that Lord I just I just want to be faithful to you now pray for every heart here Lord that desires to walk in this path Lord of all that you're that you would have us to do father bless each one as they they pray and they say Lord would you lead me to a soul would you lead me would you use me to win a soul for you father I pray Lord that you would hear their sincere prayers I pray that you would use them Father to build thy kingdom Lord take these words and Lord would you continue to break them and and reveal them and and and open up the scriptures to each and every one of us as this year uh as this year uh
