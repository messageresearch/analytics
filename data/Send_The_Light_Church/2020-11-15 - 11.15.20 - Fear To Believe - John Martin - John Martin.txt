glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on hallelujah hallelujah you know i love that song because it doesn't matter how you feel it doesn't matter what exists doesn't matter what epidemic's going on his truth will march huh hallelujah to we're out of here amen well i just like to change your order of service amen there's no prayer request but i know there's many things on everybody's hearts whether it be just a few of us where people are under a cloak of uh concern for their health and for spreading this um you know just it just it just came to me you know that sometimes we are more concerned about covid and the things of it than we are about spreading the word of god and it's really a shame that we're concerned about ourselves and not others we there is a truth to all that but it's in it's in prayer that you find the answer you men don't know i said that but uh it's truth so i see the baptismal here is our is our sistine baptized she wants to be here she apologizes again she was dealing with things with her last weekend and she said she is still playing okay well that's that that's fine you know i mean the one thing that we all have to do is press forward and i see that in our sister you know she's not letting a a lot of people especially early in their faith would stop and and to say you know this this can't be right because there's so many obstacles coming against me but uh i believe that she has the spirit of lord that just wants her to keep pushing forward into baptism and on with christ so that's really what it is the world wants to stop us from pursuing christ you know but he is greater hallelujah so we thank you for that sister um let's just uh keep uh obviously everybody that's not here in prayer uh keep my son in prayer he's going for an operation i believe uh in a week um kind of being kind of secretive of what's going on but we just pray that the lord will be with the doctors and in the outcome um also for the bailouts i think dennis just went into the hospital um and so i we pray that he gets the treatment that he needs and that his wife is comforted by that crystal and um also for anybody else that's suffering any kind of affliction uh whether it be a spiritual affliction or or a natural affliction amen god is greater than anything we could i mean he created all things what a glorious service last wednesday to get a grasp of who he really is shows you that we shouldn't have no fear if we're in christ amen so let's just rise and just remember our tithes and offerings amen let's just thankful to see our brother staying here this morning and his desire to push in amen uh let's also remember all the missionaries throughout the world um it's getting darker let your light be shining brighter that's all i can say let's go on one accord dear heavenly father lord as we look to you this morning lord as lord maybe there'll just be a few of us lord god we know that numbers don't really matter to you lord you'll have who you have lord god and we know that lord jesus we just pray for all those that aren't here this morning lord that your mercy and your grace and your spirit which just move amongst the waves lord god and it would just reach them wherever they are lord god that you would just give them revelation as the word would come lord god they would hate they have faith to believe it lord god for we know lord that some didn't receive because it wasn't mixed with faith lord so we send the faith forth for god it's only the thing we can do is believe lord you said lord lord with without faith we can't please you lord so we believe lord and we pray that your spirit just move upon that faith this morning lord that we might receive the eternal words of life lord god lord reach us pray lord god for lord our sister hope this morning lord that has a determination to get baptized and move forward in you lord god that lord the devil would be upon upon all the things in her life to stop her lord by but we just love her testimony lord and we just pray that we will just be with our sister lord once again in in the baptismal waters lord and that you just baptize your lord in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah we just thank you again this service lord to wait onto you in the running remainder of this service in jesus name amen hallelujah let's just stay standing as we just get rid of his eyes our brother comes and just sing uh let's just turn our eyes upon jesus amen turn your eyes upon jesus look his forward face and the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace turn your eyes upon jesus and the things of earth will grow strangely down in the light of his glory and grace amen hallelujah let's sing oh i want to know him more amen hallelujah if you want to know more this morning just believe his word oh i want to know you more deep within my soul i want to know you oh i want to know you to feel your heart and know your mind a king in your eyes up within me guys that say i want to know you oh i want to know you more oh i want to know you more deep within my soul i want to know you oh i want to know you and i would give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection oh i want to know you more lord oh i want to know you more amen hallelujah amen amen like no matter what the devil throws at us there's still something inside of us just wants to get closer to god know more know him how to how to please him you know the more that you know someone the more you know what they they like they want you know just like anybody else um you know what to get somebody for their birthday for christmas when you know them real well yeah and you don't quite don't know them you don't know what to get them so we can never go wrong knowing more of the lord amen and i believe without that hunger it's hard to get to know the lord more and we can't known through knowledge brother branham said that we could go to school for many many years and learn all about them and still really never know him and so we we know him by faith amen amen well god bless you today we're just going to let's go ahead and pray we got kind of a lengthy reading but let's just look to the lord in prayer our dear heavenly father we want to thank you lord that you placed within us your holy spirit lord where would we without you we'd be lost in this world we'd be like a ship without a sail we we would be in the wilderness without a compass we'd be looking up at the skies without knowing where the north star is at lord how we thank you today for being in our lives and we thank you that these doors are still open lord that we could come and we could gather together father though there'd be just a few of us here though we know there's many others lord that are live streaming today and we just ask that the holy ghost would be in every home be in every room be in every heart lord would you knock on their hearts and and and move in their lives just the same as they would be right here today father we ask that your healing power would go out to each one lord that's bad on some sort of sickness today father you're a mighty god you you're the god that he with all of our diseases and you can do it right where they're at lord i just ask that faith would come into every heart lord as they hear your word today they would dare to believe father lord recommit this service in your hands and give you the praise and honor for it today and we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of mark saint mark chapter nine and uh i don't know if a request got in to pray for uh sister hope's daughter raymona who had uh tried to commit suicide i get i would say again right and uh literally she cut her wrist real bad and was taken to the hospital so this is what kept our sister hope from being baptized and we know the evil forces of darkness are behind this in a number of different ways so let's just pray for that family let's just pray for the soul that's worth ten thousand worlds amen let's remember to continue to pray for uh brother dennis and also crystal balak i believe they're depending on their prayers and let's just continue to pray for them and i just want to thank all those who who feel to stay home because you would be some sort of uh dangering others to keep our church uh safe and clean healthy um my daughter was telling me that she had uh not her every other church that she know of has gotten to covet and i'm just so thankful that here our church has been protected and she also has told me uh a a number of times now that she spends four hours cleaning the church between services i don't know if that's what everybody's doing but i i know that uh uh they're doing a good job and we're thankful for each and every one that's cleaned the church and going to extremes to make it safe to make it a place where we can come and feel safe when we come and i'm just speaking in the natural i know our safety is in christ um but we're we're grateful and i just want to say thank you to each of you who are conscious and thinking about us uh here and keeping our church safe may the lord jesus bless you amen uh let's start with verse uh number nine of mark chapter nine verse number 11 i believe verse number 11 of mark chapter 9 and they asked him is saying why say the scribes that elias must first come and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things how was it written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at naught but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have done whatsoever whatsoever they have listed it as it is written of him so notice that question that came about the prophet that was to come and jesus talked answered the question with two different prophets at two different times and actually doing two different things and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them and straight way all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him and he asked the scribes what question ye with them and one of the multitude answered and said master i brought unto thee my son which have a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh he taketh him he teareth him and he filmeth and gnashes with his teeth and pineth away i spake to thy disciples and they they that they should cast him out and they could not notice they could not and he answered him and saith all faithless generation how long shall i be with you and how long will i suffer you bring him unto me notice the answer was faith that was needed to take care of the problem and they brought him unto him and when he saw him he straightway and saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground wallowed uh wallowed foaming so notice this the demon inside of him was recognizing um jesus right there knew what was going to happen just trying to take a hold and he asked his father how long is it a goal since this came unto him and he said of a child and oftentimes it casteth him into the fire and into the water to destroy him notice the motive of the devil and if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth straightway the father of the child cried out and said in said with tears lord i believe help thou my unbelief and when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cried and wret him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand lifted him up and he arose and when he was come hit the house notice here his disciples asked him privately privately why could not we cast him out and he said unto them because you lacked faith he never said those words and it's important that you understand this the faith that was needed was on that father he said unto them this kind cometh forth by nothing but prayer and fasting something more was needed if those disciples were going to do it and it wasn't more faith that he told him he said just pray and fast but to the father he said oh faithless generation sometimes we need to pray and fast that our faith increases that god hears the earnest of our yearning that this need would be met amen god bless you may be seated you cannot go wrong praying fasting and believing amen but i just like that that that jesus didn't rebuke the disciples she said this kind this type of spirit that we're dealing with we need to fast and we need to pray and if there's ever an hour we need to spend more time with the lord this is the hour because demons are becoming more and more wicked this morning we'd like to take a subject here of choosing to live or to doubt choosing to live in doubt or to live in fear and so i want to entitle this fear to believe fear to believe and we're going to get back into this opening scripture here a little bit down the road but in one way fear opposes faith it's the opposite of faith the bible says that fear has torment fear is when demons torment your mind they prescribe a confinement to your mind now that's what that means confinement it takes your mind and puts you in a spot of hopelessness you're just confined to a situation that you can't seem to get out of and they prescribe it like a doctor prescribing a cure to you they prescribe an in caring punishment to your mind and if you take the prescription you'll stay right there fear grips the mind and confuses its ability to believe for anything better than what's going on fear has literally gripped the world since the beginning of 2020 when this corona virus had arrived i remember we had worked a while as you know working on our waterfall and uh we had put the pumps into the the pond and i remember before the pumps ever went into the pond there's like four pumps that we use i literally feared the day that i would have to pull them out in the fall before they went in i feared that thought oh i ain't going to want to do this i knew how much it was to put them in there and they're very heavy and getting everything just right and settled right and hitting the connections and i just remember brother mark just thinking about this throughout the summer throughout the fall and just kind of fearing the day i'd have to take them out well we took them out this week and it took me uh uh less than two hours i spent all this time thinking about what i don't want to do in the fall for a lousy two hours i spent more time cleaning them after i got it out then i spent taking them out fear has a way of manipulating us my secretary had to unlock the door and come in uh one day this week because she was the first one there and it wasn't really taught to her exactly all the things to look out for when when you unset the alarm so she came in and she hit the buttons but it didn't work and the alarm went off and she was so scared so so afraid and so she she called me and i said well no problem just just relax go sit in the car i'll be right there and i was on my way so when i got there she started telling me about all the police are gonna come and what am i gonna do and and fear had took a hold in that situation this week the police didn't come there was no need to think about it what was going to happen the fire trucks were going to get don't have to worry about it but fear has a way of getting in there and trapping us into a situation that seems hopeless so after it was over minutes over she was still i just need to calm down it i had already done something it reminds me of the time that uh this woman came home this mother came home uh from getting groceries and she saw her children there uh and in the in the and their children's friends were over and they were in this circle in the living room and and she just noticed they were there sitting in a circle and you know kids what are you doing and and uh they didn't respond too much because they were paying attention to what was in the middle of them and and when she got over there she noticed that there were some baby skunks just sitting in the middle of these kids and they were just enjoying in them as soon as she went there she just got so scared and afraid frantically the kids were just enjoying the skunks she got so scared wound up the kids so much that the skunks start spraying so how many times we heard what job feared fell upon him fear can take a situation and make it worse it cannot make it better faith is what makes it better the world's frantically scrambling into a frenzy panic trying to gain control of an unknown germ and this fear has manipulated the way the world even thinks it has thrown hope into a prison cell and given a normal life a death sentence no more normal fear is called such a confusion that the world just doesn't even know what to believe anymore what is really happening when fear is trying to attack us fear is forcing us to predict the future without taking into account the sovereignty of a good god who's always in control friends god is still in control in the the fact that there's nothing that that that ever can happen without god okay god's got a great plan he's got a purpose ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 says that god works all things to the counsel of his own will do you think god's going to allow anything to happen that that he's gonna lose control that fear will prescribe your mind with an incurring punishment that there's no answer to your situation no answer satan is trying to get you to predict your future with thinking that you are absolutely stuck in confinement of your situation no hope nothing to do what do we do fear is a choice who and what you fear is a choice paul told timothy in second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for god have not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind that's the spirit that god's given us god's spirit has not given us the spirit of fear fear comes from the devil the spirit of fear can come to us often and try to confuse our minds try to get us in a spot of i just don't know what to do but that spirit doesn't come from heaven above but that torment comes from the pit of hell now you know there's not a lot of us here so we need to up the amens we need to up them up them did you know that god admonishes his people over 300 times in the bible to not fear god provides all of us with a choice not an excuse not an incurring punishment in our minds that seems to paralyze us when demons come with a prescription to torment your mind always remember that you have a choice in the situation to take the prescription or not to that's why we gotta try the spirit well brother john i don't know how to do that i'm not sure we'll learn get serious about it because they're here to stay i'm telling you those demons are gonna do everything they can to get us off track you don't have to take their prescription you don't have to go get it filled out that those tormenting thoughts that you get can you imagine getting a prescription from the devil every six hours just take these negative thoughts it'll help you feel so rotten so down so depressed you just keep taking these every six hours okay as i prescribe no sir god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind it's okay that you're not in control god is though that's all that matters if if if you gotta if if you got to be in control of the situation to have peace something's wrong trust that the sovereignty of our good god is in control today david not only knew that the spirit of fear came from hell but he also knew that it was a choice whether he was going to listen to it or not in psalms 23 the great psalms 23 verse 4 yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil well brother john you don't know i'm going through stuff he never went through for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff well they take all the fear away why do i need to worry when i got jesus do you think jesus says angels come here you humble around me i'm getting scared right now we need jesus that's it that's all we need we need more of him not up here not on the walls not carrying it we need them right here jesus on the inside there's a place in god where there's peace proverbs 18 verse number 10 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is safe now you have a choice you can sit around in fear or you can run to christ it's a strong tower nothing can get in there nothing can penetrate christ and when you're in him there is no fear because you've got perfect love and perfect love casteth out off here praise the lord fear is being stuck in your own minds i understand that we can't change or control anything that's happened in the past we can't change something that's happened in the past we can't uh we can't change what's happening right now we can't even change what's going to be happening david said in proverbs chapter 30 verse 5 he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him so it doesn't matter what happened back then it doesn't matter what's happening now it doesn't matter what's going to happen in the future the the thought that you have a choice to trust the god is going to be your shield that's all that matters that's all that matters i i who was it that i was talking to i think it was brother roger yesterday was talking to me on the phone and he he brought up a quote that brother branham said when they asked brother branham where do you want to be when the bombs are going to fly when when the the big one's going to happen where do you where where's the best place to be where do you want to be brother brandon that's that's what i want to be he says i want to be in the word because they all thought well i thought for sure he'd want to be in heaven no because heaven and earth is going to pass away but my word shall never pass away he is our shield but it's got to be a reality to a saints it can't be something that we just know about amen it's got to be so real that when you go through the test you can stand there knowing there's a shield of faith around you amen brother sister it's an individual affair it's not a world affair i don't care how bad it is out there it's not even a country affair not about who's going to be the president it's an individual fair if most people choose to be in laodicea that nonchalant lukewarm about being in church it's not a church affair it's an individual affair we choose to fear the lord we choose to say amen to the word we we choose to hunger and thirst for the revelation of god's word we choose to believe you know there's a lot of people who walk into church already manipulated by fear before they even get here that they'll have to give up their will even more than they already have oh i don't want to give up my will to a sovereign god that isn't going to let me do what i want to do anymore they're manipulated by fear it's just the devil manipulating us it's a fear and god has not given us that spirit of fear so you know what they'll do they'll put up a wall and i've seen it many times as a minister a strong wall a strong will a hard heart a wall so strong that nothing can squeeze it and make it cry you know what's happening their mind is in confinement they've made up their mind don't accept that incurring punishment into your mind don't let the demons prescribe some torment to your mind that you're you're stuck always remember you have a choice to what the devil is trying to prescribe to you he that the son has set free is free indeed praise the lord and such an unstable and confusing hour that we're living in always remember peace is available to us how do you know that brother john because jesus himself said in saint john chapter 14 verse 27 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth well everything got to have the right president coleman's got to be gone the economy has got to be good the stocks got to be up my future's got to be bright that's the kind of peace the world gives you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid it's a choice it's a choice you've got the fear to believe when your mind becomes flooded with fearful faults i say get on your knees don't sit there and say like i don't know what to do i can't say this i'm being really bothered get on your knees do something about it psalms 34 verse 4 says i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears there's the key right there god wants you to actually do something in this battle if people would just humble themselves more and fear the lord instead of fearing the devil when fear is bothering you just humble yourself psalms 118 verse 5 i called on i called upon the lord in distress the lord answered me and he set me in a large place the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me who's on your side today well i don't feel like he is no number one we don't go by feelings but if you actually get on your knees and pray long enough you will feel his presence and he will not lie he will tell you you're in the palm of my hands i know the thoughts i think towards you he that have begun a good work in you is going to finish it but you can't stay there in the flesh and just expect god to cater to you god don't have spoiled children today i like the question that paul asked the church in rome in romans chapter 8 verse 31 he said what shall we say what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us who when you sink your teeth into that your mind cannot be a playground for the devil when fear tries to paralyze you remember who you belong to isaiah 43 verse 1 but now thus saith the lord the that created you o jacob and he that formed you o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee my name thou art mine that's troubles that nothing else matters the message from god to his people is a continual theme throughout the bible deuteronomy chapter 31 verse 6 be strong and be of good cure courage fear not nor be afraid of them amen greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world amen be not afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doeth uh doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee it's an individual affair some do not have faith to believe and that's why jesus said if thou canst believe all things are possible choose to believe god is the keeper do you believe that isaiah chapter 26 verse 3 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee why because he trusteth in thee you're trusting in something well i don't feel like i trust the lord brother john and i certainly don't trust the devil you know what you're doing you're trusting you you don't realize it but you are and when you trust in you you're trusting in the devil because you're leaning to the arm of flesh there's only two spirits he will keep the imperfect peace whose mind is stayed on the lord because you trust in the lord amen if uh if you keep your thoughts on the world and the troubles of the world and the news of the world and how a people are changing you know what's happening you know this virus has mutated i think at least 10 times from what i understand do you know this corona fear virus has mutated ten times too if it can't get you here it'll come over here if it can't get you here it'll mutate over here and somehow it's trying to attack the church trying to attack us keep your mind stayed on the lord remember who's holding you the world's falling apart but god's holding on to his bride john chapter 10 verse 29 my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand hallelujah isaiah chapter 41 verse 13 for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee now it's a promise now god can't do it unless you believe you got to believe what is he doing what what do you what did you do with your children mark you don't understand this yet but you will do this you and sister anne when you have children you teach them to believe in you to listen to you to follow your instructions we were at the brother uh other stands brother's funeral on was that thursday that was thursday and uh before the funeral i was watching brother stan and there were stratrina's boys were there and brother stan was teaching them how to throw the frisbee got around them and holding them and trying to show them how to do it well god's putting his arms around us and he's trying to teach us to trust him just do it like this put your trust in the lord he's with us he's not going to fail us but if we keep i don't know like a little child i don't want to do it like that i'm going to be like thomas i got a before i believe it you'll be blessed but you'll be more blessed if you can take god at his word amen just just do what he says to do tell you if we were in charge of things all of us we would make major decisions major changes we would not have things the way they are in any aspect of your life your your marriage your home your church your work your neighborhood the city the state the country you would make changes but we don't need to make changes all we need to do is trust the lord that's all we need to do and everything will be okay hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content what how can i be content with what's going on right now be content with such things as you have if we just exercise this for he have said i will never leave thee nor for safety so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me we're always going to fear something one will be reverencing god almighty through the choice of free more agency the other one will be through a torment of manipulation by an incurring punishment to the mind over and over again just like goliath did when he came out to the armies of god and he defiled them for a month or two or whatever it was just coming out there day after day with this in caring punishment of torment come on see if you can beat me and it just put them such in a a mind of just hopelessness but david chose not to fear those other ones had choice but you know they probably did not want to spend enough time with the lord because they were that was israel that was the people of god they knew jehovah you've got to spend time with god faith cometh by hearing and hearing by god god's got to speak it to you that's why i say it's an individual affair luke chapter 12 verse 4 luke chapter 12 verse 4 it's a choice jesus said and i say unto you my friends and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do don't be afraid of the person that can kill your body but i will forewarn you whom you shall fear fear him which after he have killed have power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him amen there is the choice that we have every single time we come into church in other words you're going to pay attention to one another because there's only two spirits god has not given us the spear of torment god has given us the spirit to reverence him i want you to catch this to reverence him when you believe you reverence you don't walk around oh yeah i got this great revelation nothing can bother me there's no humility in that god's not in that type of a spirit it's a reverence it's an unworthiness it's a humbleness that's right matthew chapter 10 verse 28 matthew says the same thing but just in a little bit different way and i want you to catch it and fear not them jesus said which killed the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell again god telling us to make a choice to fear him to reverence him not out of scared in torment now before i knew god i didn't want to go to hell and i was so scared of god but that ain't the fear that god's talking about he saw i believe so strong in you lord it's a quiet confidence faith i reverence you lord i believe your word lord knowing the terror of the lord we persuade men amen oh death where is i sting oh grave where is thy victory praise the lord we don't have to worry about death i'd like to go back to our opening scripture at least just to in starting with verse number 22 but you can see this father's desperation for his child the devil is trying to destroy him and the father was was being manipulated by the situation himself over and over again in this incurring punishment to his mind in verse 22 let's pick it up and oftentimes it casteth him into the fire into the waters to destroy him now notice this but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us now notice the father was putting some drastic measures on jesus if thou canst do anything what do you mean if thou can't do anything he can do anything except fail and he said have compassion jesus is full of compassion but notice how this man was approaching and help us i want you to notice jesus didn't get manipulated by him jesus put it right back unto the father i'm not moving on this situation until you reverence me i'm not going to help until you fear me that i am able to do this for you look into the word jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth he put it right back on him god puts it right back on us wherever we're at whatever we want however we want to grow in christ whatever we're facing he puts it right back on us you know we can look at god sometimes like this man looked at god bringing our strong reasonings to jesus showing forth our just cause god have compassion on us like questioning his ability when all we got to do is learn to spend time with him get into his spirit get into his presence let that voice speak to our heart and then we'll have faith now look at the answer after jesus spoke to him he just came to the right the right mental attitude here and straightway the father of the child he cried out he just broke out with tears and he said lord i believe but help thou my unbelief he was just honest with god that's where we get somewhere with god is when we can become honest it's an individual affair it doesn't matter what happens to the person next to you it matters what happens to you brother says if there's only going to be one in the city of fenton make sure you're that one well brother john i as far as i know i'm the only one from clarkston i'm the only one from flint you just have to have that kind of faith right we want more from flint we want more from clarkson we want more from fenton but we want every one of them to have the attitude if i'm the only one i'm going because i believe i believe we've got to reverence to believe that's what this man did he reverenced to believe we've got to fear to believe are you with me god wants us to reverence him more and not all of our lives issues or what's going on in the world reverence him not give all of our our time and our energy and our thoughts all the problems that's going out in the world i got this and i got this and i got that reverence him reverence him god wants more reverence you know some of us need a lesson or two in reverence god has not given us the okay to walk into his house in our flesh that's right jesus sees jesus said he that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth that's just all there is so when we walk in to church in our flesh we're not reverencing the lord now someone that don't know the lord is totally understandable but we that do know to come into church in the flesh and expect the music or the preaching to get you in the spirit is absolutely a slap in the face of god to come into this live stream and not be prepared for the word god is a spirit you want god to meet you get in the spirit this is god's house it's a house of prayer it's not a place that we come to fellowship with one another it's a place that we should come and pray for one another pray with one another i see some people that go in the prayer room they're here for a half hour they go in the prayer room for about six minutes well i did my duty come on what did the prophet say why did god send a prophet god has not given us the right to use his house for our flesh for our negativity maybe for a reputation to be heard to be seen god doesn't want us to talk in church he wants us to praise him to worship him to adore him to bow before him to pray unto him to love him to be more ready to hear the word of god to come into his house prepared every one of you if you were going to somebody's house you would be thinking about some sort of preparation and a lot of times you want to bring something coming over you want to bring something some people they come to churches they as long as they get here they feel they did their duty now i'm not knocking where your revelation is at but i'm telling you there's more to reverencing god than where you're at don't make this a worldly church with colonel thinking if you want god to accept you get into the spirit before you enter in don't sit there come in and expect somebody to make you feel good to make you feel like worshiping to make you feel like praying to make you feel like loving somebody friend that's your walk with god this is where you come to find out where you're at with god don't make this a worldly church no the reverent to god god wants more reverence come to him already reverent enter his house prepared say amen to the word like you mean it like you're determined to leave here and do something about it there's nothing more sad to me that sometimes we come to church we hear the word and we go service after service after service and we never say anything about the message we just heard amen can you imagine going to god's house god speaking and you the only thing you got to say is nothing or something negative think about it this is god's house psalms 89 verse 5 and the heavens shall praise thy wonders oh lord thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints that's where we're at right now for who is in heaven can be compared unto the lord and among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him so what does this mean to your revelation what does this mean to you how much does this place that you call church how do you view what god wants you to do well i like what the scriptures tell me it's it's simple what god god i don't feel we can be reverent enough i play we we should probably put forth some effort every time we come into god's house to make it real to come into this sanctuary in the spirit filled with the holy ghost ready to receive the word of god it's a choice we're out there we left the news we let the people we let the neighbors we left the fall we let the internet we let everything dictate to us all the fear in our minds but we can't come in here with reverence and godliness and saying oh god i love you and i want you more what's happening fear is a choice yes who you're gonna fear this is a place where you can know god is here you pull that internet up you google this you'll find 10 different answers about the same question that you have but god's word is forever settled in heaven it is the same yesterday today it doesn't change he doesn't lie you can depend on the word of god if god wants to be reverent today he'll want to be reverent tomorrow you can depend on it when you come to church on wednesday [Music] it ain't going to change your thoughts may change your day may change you may feel out of it but god is still here he still wants to be reverent by all those that are around him well brother john how do you know that go in heaven go in heaven and see the angels they reverence him they fear him they choose it you know who does it they that left their first habitation in fact the bible tells me that the angels of god are and can't round about them to fear the lord they'll come and be with us if we're in agreement with that same spirit of god he inhabits that he dwells with those that have a humble contrite spirit who know that god expects them to get in their spirit before they get into church that's someone that god is after he's seeking looking for someone that will worship him in spirit and truth i don't know how many times we heard brother ron say if we could come into church with the spirit that we have now at the end of the service at the beginning where could god take us why wait to the end he's worthy of our best at the beginning and i'm so glad the few of us that are here i'm not taking any of this in a personal way this message goes to the church i want this message this message to be heard a year from now it'll be the same as it is today i believe in spiritual food due season but this is one with the evil is so much imposing in our lives we need to combat it with faith in god choose to believe in god did you realize that no matter how much you believe that you're predestinated if you're not prepared to reverence god you're going to miss out what god really wants for you to do without the reverence of faith it is impossible to please god hearing the word with these ears are not the ears that jesus was talking about when he said he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear god give me grace to get this message done let us therefore fear last a promised being left us of entering into his wrath and if you should seem to come short of it well how many times we enter into church and think well i'm not going to miss anything god i'm so predestined god loves me so much i'm going to get it all i don't have to worry about i don't have to fear nothing let us therefore reverence him humble ourselves more believe the word more because it's god speaking and believe that he's speaking to you personally it just doesn't matter to brother ron what god is saying to brother mark or what our brother stan or sister linda if god our precious brother larry god larry is interested our brother larry is interested in what god is speaking to him because it's an individual chur affair not a church affair the only place that god is looking at us at the church is that he wants us to be in one mind and one accord about what he wants to do here and he wants all of us to be focused on them remember being in class and the teacher the professor would stand up and say now you listen to me focus hey johnny boy pay attention to me how many times we watch something kids are playing around and the teacher would call them out oh yeah you weren't listening were you well god is here and he's speaking to each one of us the same message but it's an individual fear who's going to receive it you catching it reverence him do not be the one that lets a promise slip from you we must be reverent when we come to god's house of prayer let us therefore fear last a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it that's a very potent words we want to leave church with a determination to walk in what we heard how many times have you left church and never said anything about the word that god gave you if you leave church you don't say nothing there's probably a good possibility you're thinking that was brother john that was just brother john you know trying to admonish this tell us what to do [Laughter] again when god speaks it's important you know when god speaks you just want to tell everybody because god almighty took time to speak to you now i'll tell you a real big pitfall here's a big pitfall some of us are so satisfied with god speaking to us we're content come on because it's been so long since god spoke that we're just happy that he spoke come on now i've been there but god wants to take what he spoke to us he wants us to take that word and go out there with it do what he told us to do whatever it is and i'll tell you that's what i'll bring the word to you again see it's a relationship you're not going to hand the keys to somebody to the car to one of your children to drive your car if they can't seem to listen to you but i'm we all want to drive a car yeah i'll tell you that's freedom 16 years old you drive your own car you're free that's the greatest freedom that you feel right you're driving away from home saying bye to the parents i'm free i'm going over my friends fear lest a promise be left us every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line is yours you gotta want it you got a hunger you got a thirst and you gotta claim it second peter chapter one verse four here where here uh whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises exceeding great they're so great they exceed greatness they're they're so precious these promises that by these you might be partakers of his divine nature acts chapter 1 verse 4 and being assembled together with them he commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father saith which saith he ye have heard of me you have heard of me when god comes and he speaks to you personally you've heard of me you've heard of jesus personally and you come in the church prepared that he'll speak to you personally you wait on him until he speaks until he comes i have heard from jesus that promise now becomes yours personally because he spoke to you firstly until then it's just in a book that you know it's true but faith has to unlock it and you can't just hear with these ears you just can't see with these eyes it's got to go beyond the natural to the spiritual amen romans chapter 10 verse 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god if you want faith god's got to speak it to you man can't give you faith i can't give you faith brother branham can't give you faith the five-fold ministry can't give you faith only the word and who is the word jesus is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and that's what gives man faith the word of god spoken by god not by man god can anoint men to speak his word and all the mysteries have been finished god sent a prophet the mysteries are done but god's got to speak it to you personally amen hebrews chapter 4 verse 2 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them they came to church but they didn't mix it with faith they left church thinking it wasn't for them you know they brought a pitchfork or that they already had it because they got the knowledge knowledge is not what god is looking for he's looking for faith can you imagine for a moment every time that you asked your child to do something i want you to do this and every time they came to you and they said daddy i just wanted butter fingers i just want to dial i just want this this this car so much that they're not paying attention to what you want them to do i remember when we were there and the boys were being told this is not a playground don't play but something in a child you know they just want to play we all have wants from god but when our wants get connected in line exactly with what god wants for us oh my the promises of god are yea and amen fear last a promise being left behind at church don't leave don't come to church be satisfied with church you might have left a promise behind come prepared come in the spirit come hungry and come thirsty come believing god will meet you verse number three for we which have believed do enter into rest as he saith i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world this is what i like about this god has already paid the price of everything that you could possibly desire out of god the work is already done all you have to do is get connected with him and hear that voice from him personally so it just it really doesn't matter about anybody else it's an individual affair it's not them that here it's them that believe them who are willing to mix the word with faith them who are willing to prepare themselves with faith i don't want to enter into church without faith i do not want to enter into church in intellectualism with my own mindset with my own little church with my own little carnality god is a spirit and he speaks his word he said my words are not carnal they're not intellectual my words are spirit and they're truth they're life amen hebrews chapter 6 verse 10 we're winding down for god has for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have shown towards his name in that you have ministered to the saints and do minister it may feel like there's things that you do that are just seem like in vain like i had prepared this tank here to to get to baptize their sister hope oh that old devil came and he said you know what that was in vain but you know what it's not vain well then baptizer that's not it god wants to see if you're willing to follow him everything he tells you to do and it may seem to the carnal mind that what you do for the people of god for the kingdom of god can sometimes see in vain because people don't appreciate it because it doesn't seem to make a big difference spiritually in somebody's life but i want you to know something god is not forgetful god is not forgetful he's not going to forget your work your labor of love which you have showed towards the name of jesus christ if you do it in the name of the lord it can never be in vain it's only when you do it in your name i can see why you'd be discouraged you didn't get it out of it what you wanted maybe you didn't get the recognition popularity the pat on the back the parade the money the whatever god is going to forget you nor your labors verse 11 and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end whoa this just isn't for the fivefold ministry every one of you do show the same diligence not half as much not 75 amen full assurance of hope unto the end hallelujah verse 12 that ye be not slaughterful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises we're all following somebody you may not believe that but you are you're following some body you're following some example you're listening to someone and it could be a combination of a number of different people but you are make sure that the person you're following has exercised faith and patience to get the promise because anything else you're gambling well brother john in my life i don't know anybody i don't see anybody i don't have anybody well you got a prophet god sent a prophet you got paul you got the book of acts make sure you're following them make sure you're following them make sure that you're following the spirit that's leading you to become more like jesus [Music] don't be following the spirit that says that's okay you don't have to do that don't worry about that let that go it's a wrong spirit make sure you're following a spirit that's fulfilling the plan of redemption amen like we just spoke last service make sure you're you're following the spirit that has compassion for souls that's interested in soul winning be a follower of them who's who's that god is leading know who you're following amen let's stand together we don't want to doubt we don't want to fear we don't want to fear to doubt we want to fear to believe reverence to believe i'm just going to read this last one as you're getting as a musician come and that's in psalms 46 verse 1 god is our refuge our strength a very present help in trouble can you say praise god therefore we therefore will not we fear amen fear of the lord amen

drink this water you'll never thirst again there is a river float holes from deep within there is a fountain that frees the soul from sin [Music] come to this water there is a vast supply there is a river that never shall run dry amen we don't have to worry about god running out amen there as much of the lord as there is in the deep desire of your heart where there's a deep desire there is a deep
