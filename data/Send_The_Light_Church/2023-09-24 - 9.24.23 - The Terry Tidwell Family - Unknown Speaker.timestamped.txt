[27:35] yesterday and kind of in a hurry trying
[27:37] to get up here and
[27:39] when you take off out of a plane
[27:42] you're on the ground you're grounded it
[27:45] might be raining maybe storming maybe
[27:48] snowing sleeting but once you Crest
[27:51] through that that cloud and you get just

[28:09] storms are hitting you from every angle
[28:12] that you turn you get up in the morning
[28:14] job's not going right maybe there's
[28:16] something going on with family and you

[28:25] a little sunshine that sun is always
[28:27] there it never changes it's the same
[28:30] yesterday today and forever it's always
[28:33] going to be there Through Your Storm

[33:41] social going to church if you move the
[33:44] blood out of the church and he moved
[33:45] across out of the church that's right
[33:47] and what kind of church do you have
[33:49] because it's by his blood as we've been
[33:51] saved but without the shedding of blood
[33:54] there is no remission of sin I'm glad he
[33:57] died for me I'm glad he hung on across
[33:59] from me I'm glad the blood's still alive
[34:00] today listen
[34:02] [Music]

[34:19] more determined to finish it
[34:24] the world saw a man
[34:27] with a tree on his back

[34:57] he didn't just count the car
[35:02] but he counted me
[35:04] [Applause]
[35:09] so much has been said what happened to
[35:13] Calvary

[36:49] he didn't just carry the cross
[36:54] he carried me
[37:01] praise God praise God
[37:04] well you folks just sung it out of me
[37:06] last night
[37:08] and so I'm just trying to you know I'm
[37:10] making you some ugly faces so I'm not
[37:12] making ugly faces at you I'm just trying
[37:13] to get them high notes that keep me up
[37:15] in the air I tell them I'm too old this
[37:18] ain't that high anymore
[37:19] let's let this just sing this song here
[37:22] I want him to leave this song you know
[37:24] when you go through something and you
[37:27] want to Lord why am I going through this
[37:29] I suffered depression for almost 20
[37:32] years
[37:33] and uh you know it was just a it was a
[37:35] terrible time there were days it was
[37:37] hard to get up
[37:40] just to get the shave and get just get
[37:42] up and go to the sink and shave it was
[37:43] hard for me to do that it was a it was a
[37:46] nightmare and everybody said well what's
[37:49] wrong with you well you really don't
[37:50] know you really can't say you're not you
[37:52] don't have a heart attack it's not
[37:53] cancer it's not a headache it's not the
[37:55] answer to that but when the devil can
[37:57] can compress his darkness and Gloom
[38:00] around your life and cause you to go
[38:02] into depression I tell you what it takes
[38:05] the real hand of God to move you out
[38:06] that's right but I'm living proof he
[38:08] does that
[38:10] I walked into a little church in Calhoun
[38:12] Georgia
[38:13] and I was broken as a Brokenness a man
[38:15] can get I don't remember much of the
[38:17] sermon I just stopped there on the way
[38:19] back from Atlanta and I just said I know
[38:20] there's a message church here walked in
[38:22] and said on the back row
[38:24] and at the end of The Sermon Just a
[38:27] church like this not not even this many
[38:29] people here I ran down the aisle I meant
[38:32] I make business with God when I the
[38:34] pastor just come stepped up from the
[38:35] pulpit and I just fell in his arms when
[38:38] I walked back to my seat I was a free
[38:39] man no more depression if God done that
[38:42] for me he can do it for years
[38:45] but you wonder why you go through these
[38:47] things you wonder why and this is why
[38:49] because somebody here may be facing
[38:52] depression and knock you look here in
[38:54] the eye and say I know because I've been
[38:56] there just such this time it is
[38:58] [Music]
[39:04] why did I walk through the valley
[39:10] why was I forced to my knees
[39:17] why did the sun part
[39:20] and drive me
[39:22] as I walk through the desert
[39:26] a defeat
[39:30] and then came the clouds and the rain
[39:34] fell I thought I'd never make it through
[39:39] the night
[39:41] but God gave me the answer when I prayed
[39:46] with you he helped me see the dawn
[39:50] behold the light
[39:53] I can
[39:55] with the brother
[40:00] say I know just what you're going
[40:04] through I can pray with the sister in
[40:09] the midst of her sorrows and say I know
[40:13] because I've been there too I can put my
[40:19] arms around
[40:21] someone who is down and tell them to
[40:25] have faith and confidence
[40:29] what in pain I could not see I now fully
[40:34] believe God prepared me for such a time
[40:40] as it is foreign
[40:51] [Music]

[40:57] struggles are endlessly pressing
[41:03] but your purpose is Somewhere In God's
[41:07] Time right here but just keep on walking
[41:12] that good good road for night leads to a
[41:17] stronger wiser day
[41:21] and when they ask the reason for the
[41:25] path you have tried you know without a
[41:29] doubt

[44:17] through bloodables and coats and Rams
[44:23] Christ himself became the lamb

[51:54] comfortable I'll try I'll try not to
[51:56] speak three hours
[51:58] I will speak over 35 40 minutes
[52:03] so uh but I don't want to read a
[52:05] scripture because you know the brother
[52:06] Branham said if you want to get close to
[52:08] the Lord read your Bible and pray every
[52:11] day and so I don't think it would be
[52:13] appropriate if I didn't do this uh and
[52:16] this is some of my favorite scriptures
[52:17] Jeremiah 29 11
[52:19] through 13 for I know the thoughts that
[52:22] I have toward you saith the Lord
[52:25] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[52:28] give you an expected end then shall you
[52:31] call upon me and he shall go and pray
[52:33] unto me and I will hearken unto you and
[52:36] you shall seek me and find me when you
[52:38] search me with your whole heart amen
[52:41] then over in Ephesians I want to read a
[52:43] little portion there Ephesians chapter 2
[52:47] 1-5 it says and you happy quickened who
[52:50] were dead and transpasses and sins well
[52:52] that's all that was me for sure we're in
[52:55] in times past you walked according to
[52:57] the course of this world according to
[52:59] the prince of the power of the air the
[53:02] spirit that now worketh in the children
[53:03] of Disobedience among whom also we all
[53:07] had our conversation in times past the
[53:09] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[53:12] of the Flesh and of the mind and we're
[53:14] by Nature the children of rap even as
[53:17] others here's what I want to speak today
[53:19] but God
[53:21] who is rich in Mercy
[53:23] for his great love we're with he loved
[53:25] us even when we were dead in our sins
[53:28] has quickened us and to get together
[53:30] with Christ by grace are you saved can
[53:34] we just say a big Amen to that
[53:42] I want to start with a
[53:47] H I asked the Lord two things and I told
[53:49] Brother John I said I've asked the Lord
[53:51] for two things
[53:52] I don't cry
[53:55] because I'm so ugly when I cry
[53:57] and you don't want to see that and I
[54:00] said Lord please don't let me be boring
[54:02] so if I look around and you're picking
[54:04] Lynn off your clothes looking down the
[54:06] floor I won't think man I'm boring damn
[54:07] damn so if I'm bored you just smile and
[54:10] act like I'm not
[54:12] my birthplace began my existence here on
[54:15] this Earth began in 1959 I was born and
[54:19] now the hospitals back then they didn't
[54:22] have the all their fine amenities and
[54:24] you know all the equipment they have
[54:25] today and you know sometimes I know
[54:27] there's some people here my senior and
[54:30] sometimes they would there would be
[54:32] three or four women in one room they
[54:34] just have a curtain anybody ever seen a
[54:36] hospital like that just have a curtain
[54:37] separating the patients
[54:39] well when I was born and I'm told I
[54:42] wasn't I wasn't planned my dad had five
[54:45] kids mom had five kids he was having a
[54:47] hard enough time feeding them and so he
[54:50] didn't really want me along the way so
[54:52] but I came anyway because your name's on
[54:54] the lounge Book of Life you got to come
[54:55] to Earth
[54:57] but my mom was in the hospital we were
[54:59] they were so poor and I I was born into
[55:02] a real poor family and uh we you know
[55:05] we're not talking about uh we're talking
[55:06] about two room houses and in the middle
[55:09] of the room was a big old light bulb he
[55:11] had a long cord you pulled down the
[55:13] young people have no clue what I'm
[55:15] talking about anybody ever pulled a long
[55:17] stream cord turned the light on yeah did
[55:20] that every all the time that's you know
[55:21] and I was such a small fellow I was in
[55:23] the dark list somebody was brown taller
[55:24] than me
[55:25] but there was six kids but when I was in
[55:28] the hospital
[55:29] my mother loved chocolates and I don't
[55:32] know why but Tim mccale and Vicki I
[55:35] don't have to say Amen but I'll eat
[55:36] chocolate
[55:37] lunch dinner I ate chocolate all the
[55:40] time I love chocolate anybody like
[55:42] chocolates
[55:44] I do too
[55:46] but while she's in the hospital there
[55:48] was a curtain that separated her from
[55:49] another woman
[55:50] and they had a baby and so uh they were
[55:53] just sitting there you know sometimes
[55:54] you pull the curtain back and just talk
[55:56] and they were sitting there and uh the
[55:59] nurse walked in and said Miss Terry that
[56:01] was a lady sitting inside my mom and she
[56:03] said I got a gift for you and she walked
[56:06] in she watched my mother watch her
[56:08] unwrap this beautiful box of chocolates
[56:11] immediately instead of the woman saying
[56:13] oh that's wonderful she said what was he
[56:16] thinking he knows I'm a diabetic and I
[56:19] can't eat chocolate why in the world was
[56:21] he thinking and my mom was laying there
[56:24] she was just like craving that box of
[56:26] chocolates
[56:27] but she didn't say nothing in that
[56:29] afternoon when my dad came in they
[56:30] talked a few minutes and he said well
[56:31] didn't you get the gift
[56:33] she said why gifts and he said you know
[56:35] the chocolates the lady pulled the
[56:37] curtain back said oh no oh no that was
[56:39] for you and not me see my name's Terry
[56:41] and then dropped the other part of the
[56:43] note and just said Miss Terry and they
[56:45] give it to her
[56:46] so from that point things got started
[56:48] off kind of kind of complicated in my
[56:50] life early
[56:51] but that was the most innocent one
[56:54] but anyway I came home and there was
[56:56] five kids and like I said we were real
[56:58] poor and anybody here now you're not
[57:00] going to believe this but we were I'm
[57:01] telling you how poor we were do you ever
[57:02] draw water from a whale anybody here
[57:05] I'm right at home
[57:08] anyway there were six kids and we lived
[57:10] on a there was a black top can I run it
[57:12] was just a gravel road really just
[57:14] blacktop really really raw country and
[57:17] you turn off this blacktop onto this uh
[57:19] dirt road wouldn't the gravel just dirt
[57:21] road and you go so far and you make a
[57:23] big U and we lived in a little two-room
[57:25] Shack
[57:27] and our heat was a big old pot belly
[57:29] stove right about the middle
[57:31] right out in the middle of the floor and
[57:33] you know you got hot on one side and you
[57:35] froze on the other
[57:37] but those are good days and uh you know
[57:40] this is a little house here that only
[57:42] had two rooms and you know in living
[57:44] rooms anybody ever had a bed in your
[57:46] living room
[57:48] we had beds in our living room because
[57:49] we had there was two rooms and there was
[57:51] six kids
[57:53] but when Mama get up in the mornings and
[57:56] I didn't want to get up I was the
[57:57] smallest one it should say get up Terry
[58:00] we gotta walk the kids to the to the bus
[58:02] stop so we'll get up I'd get up and
[58:04] would walk the kids to the bus stop and
[58:06] on the way home Mom would stop and and
[58:09] should get a if the well was about 500
[58:11] feet from us and she would she would dip
[58:13] that big old bucket down in the well and
[58:15] pull it out and I'd have to carry that
[58:16] one pail back it was almost all I could
[58:18] do but that was the kind of that's how I
[58:20] started out
[58:21] and I didn't know we're poor because
[58:24] everybody in our hauler was poor
[58:26] but you know what the first time I ever
[58:28] had an encounter with God was it five
[58:31] years old in that little house
[58:33] we were out playing now there are six
[58:35] kids and it's on a beautiful sunny day
[58:37] summer and we we made up our toys we
[58:40] didn't I hear kids today I'm so bored I
[58:43] don't have nothing to do and they got
[58:45] all these Electronics they've got all
[58:46] these gidgets not we've made our toys
[58:49] with sticks
[58:50] and we went through the woods a piece of
[58:52] stick riding that car but we had nothing
[58:55] to do uh because mama called a sin she's
[58:58] because everybody heard her say it's
[59:00] coming to Cloud it's coming up the cloud
[59:01] that's why they said back where I was
[59:02] from that only means it's fixing the
[59:04] rain
[59:04] so it was a beautiful day we were all
[59:06] out playing it started to rain and mama
[59:08] called all of us kids in
[59:09] and we were sitting there
[59:11] six kids in a two bedroom a two-room
[59:14] house after a while we got on Mama's
[59:16] nerves really bad and so she said why we
[59:19] said mom we don't have nothing to do she
[59:21] said why don't y'all just go in the
[59:22] living room which was where we're at and
[59:25] say why don't y'all just gather around
[59:26] and y'all pray
[59:28] because my brother Kenny and Sandra
[59:30] didn't have any and said why don't y'all
[59:33] pray that the Lord will send them some
[59:35] shoes and so you know we were just kids
[59:37] we all gathered around in the middle of
[59:39] the floor and we began to pray
[59:42] we just said a simple prayer I was just
[59:44] listening because I was so young but we
[59:46] prayed Lord would you please send my
[59:48] brother and sister pair of shoes you
[59:49] quit raining we went on outside and
[59:51] started playing
[59:52] somewhere around almost dark mama called
[59:55] hollered to call of his kids in and we
[59:57] were just came in the house
[59:59] when there was a car
[1:00:01] coming down coming off pulled off off
[1:00:03] the blacktop it was coming down our road
[1:00:05] well we knew if it passed this one house
[1:00:08] it was come on down to us it was coming
[1:00:10] to see us so my mama waited until it
[1:00:13] passed that house she's oh they're
[1:00:14] coming here they're coming here now we
[1:00:15] didn't have no cell phone no telephones
[1:00:17] uh old timey washer you know you get
[1:00:19] your hand called in it and I'd see my
[1:00:21] mama cry but you know we didn't have
[1:00:23] anything and so
[1:00:24] when she opened the door a few minutes
[1:00:26] later there stood Brother Gibson now
[1:00:29] Brother Gibson was a man who had
[1:00:31] converted my data from the Nazarene
[1:00:33] Church he was um he was a precious saint
[1:00:38] of God and Harry sit at the door and
[1:00:40] when my mom opened the door she noticed
[1:00:42] she had three or four big boxes in his
[1:00:44] hands and she said well come on in
[1:00:47] and he said no sister Tim I can't I
[1:00:49] can't come in he said you know it's
[1:00:51] already late and he's not gonna get back
[1:00:53] he lived about an hour and a half away
[1:00:55] he said but today while I was praying
[1:00:58] the Holy Ghost spoke to me and said go
[1:01:01] buy the table kids shoes
[1:01:04] my mother began to cry
[1:01:06] and not only were there two pair of
[1:01:08] shoes but all six kids Got a Brand New
[1:01:10] Pair of Shoes
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:17] now that was the first that was the
[1:01:19] first miracle that I've seen as a boy
[1:01:21] and it hooked something down in my soul
[1:01:23] because I know we just prayed for it I
[1:01:25] knew we had no telephone he had no idea
[1:01:27] of our situation but I'll tell you God
[1:01:29] still speaks like that
[1:01:31] things got a little better and we moved
[1:01:34] it to a a little bigger house it had a
[1:01:36] it had a rayon heat in the wall and it
[1:01:39] had water and man we were Uptown it was
[1:01:41] even brick now I'll go back now and look
[1:01:44] at that huge house and it shrunk so much
[1:01:46] it's such a little house but to us it
[1:01:49] was a big house and you know people talk
[1:01:52] about they were raised in the you know
[1:01:54] four four kids in the four broom house
[1:01:57] in the bath we were raising two two
[1:01:59] rooms in the path anybody know what that
[1:02:01] is and so uh but uh but times got better
[1:02:04] and and Diddy built his house and then
[1:02:07] he started to build a church right
[1:02:08] beside of our house
[1:02:10] and there's a big old Brickell block
[1:02:12] Church similar to this not as big but
[1:02:14] similar to this and then one day uh
[1:02:17] I was out playing and uh my dad was
[1:02:20] preaching a Revival in Nashville which
[1:02:22] was about an hour and a half away he was
[1:02:25] preaching and uh I I was just playing
[1:02:28] around he was putting the shingles on
[1:02:30] the church you know and I I was out
[1:02:31] playing my brothers and sisters
[1:02:33] and uh my mama came out and she said uh
[1:02:36] Doris that's my dad's name said
[1:02:38] I have we have nothing left to eat
[1:02:41] another six kids and mama daddy she said
[1:02:43] I cooked the last cornmeal I fried the
[1:02:46] last potatoes she said we have no oil
[1:02:49] she started naming all this stuff and
[1:02:50] she started crying and I just looked up
[1:02:53] looked up at my dad I thought what is he
[1:02:55] going to say he said her name's Dorothy
[1:02:58] said Dorothy the Lord will provide
[1:03:01] and that's all he said is she said well
[1:03:03] Doris we don't have anything what she
[1:03:05] said he said the Lord will provide and
[1:03:07] he just kept on him and the nail and
[1:03:09] nailing the shingles
[1:03:11] that night we went to church it's the
[1:03:14] Pentecostal church we were Pentecostal
[1:03:15] went to the Pentecostal church and now
[1:03:18] back in that day at the end of the
[1:03:19] revivals you know sometimes I didn't get
[1:03:21] a whole lot of money so what they did is
[1:03:23] that everybody ever heard of a pounding
[1:03:26] okay you guys got to come South a
[1:03:29] pounding is when they get together and
[1:03:31] they just everybody brings groceries
[1:03:34] oh they bring tons of groceries and so
[1:03:36] at the end of the close of the Revival
[1:03:40] I just heard what my mom had said to my
[1:03:42] dad that day we went on to churches I
[1:03:44] mean it was you know I was a kid it's
[1:03:45] like nothing but
[1:03:46] at the end of the service the preacher
[1:03:47] says all mine's clear
[1:03:50] but nobody said that and so he said well
[1:03:52] brother table the offerings were kind of
[1:03:54] will kind of support this wig wouldn't
[1:03:56] very much he said but I want you to know
[1:03:58] here we took you all up a pound and
[1:04:00] opened a Sunday school door and I've
[1:04:02] never seen as much food in my life it
[1:04:05] looked like three Kroger stuck in
[1:04:07] one room it was summertime so there was
[1:04:10] bushels of beans corns potatoes onions
[1:04:12] and they bought all kind of good stuff
[1:04:14] you know from the cookies and stuff we
[1:04:17] had a station wagon we sit on food
[1:04:20] we held food and we tied food to the top
[1:04:23] of the house
[1:04:25] at top of the car brother and when we
[1:04:27] got home we started loading it all off
[1:04:29] off the other car into the table we had
[1:04:32] a little table with just a wooden
[1:04:34] four-legged table and we kept loading
[1:04:37] groceries and all at once that table
[1:04:38] went to come fell flat to the ground I'd
[1:04:41] hear my daddy preach a few years after
[1:04:43] it he'd say didn't the Lord say he would
[1:04:46] give you a blessing he just wouldn't be
[1:04:47] able to receive that's what happened
[1:04:49] that day and I you know it just kind of
[1:04:51] it made me
[1:04:54] it made me realize man this God that my
[1:04:57] daddy's preaching about it it's that
[1:04:58] this is real this is a real stuff we had
[1:05:01] a lady
[1:05:02] and I'll move on this from this we had a
[1:05:05] lady that came to the church she was a
[1:05:07] regularly rather large lady she always
[1:05:10] wore a hat and uh we never she never
[1:05:13] seen him without her hat now my wife
[1:05:14] wears that I see her sometimes she likes
[1:05:16] hats but this lady was about well she
[1:05:19] was large and she was short
[1:05:22] and it should come to church and I'm
[1:05:24] gonna go with my mom I would go with my
[1:05:25] mom to pick her up because she had no
[1:05:27] way to church her husband was an atheist
[1:05:29] and he was very mean and hit her and you
[1:05:33] know just just was a terrible person
[1:05:35] but she'd get in the car and would pick
[1:05:37] her up and one one morning we went to
[1:05:40] pick her up I said Mama who's that man
[1:05:41] there and she said that's that's uh I'll
[1:05:44] just change the name because I know
[1:05:46] you're going on YouTube he said I'll
[1:05:48] just say sister Smith said that's a
[1:05:50] sister Smith's husband and I said well
[1:05:53] why don't he come to church she said
[1:05:54] she's Sister Sister someone told her
[1:05:56] name sister Smith was fixing to get in
[1:05:58] the car and Mom said no no I'll tell you
[1:06:00] later
[1:06:01] but this lady would come to church
[1:06:04] If he if she had no way she'd start out
[1:06:06] walking
[1:06:07] and we live three or four miles from
[1:06:09] church
[1:06:10] and she didn't miss church sometimes
[1:06:13] she'll come in that'd be raining her
[1:06:15] face
[1:06:16] you could see with the snow would hit
[1:06:18] her face
[1:06:19] and should sit down and my daddy would
[1:06:21] begin to sing a song called oh Lord
[1:06:23] you've been so good to me
[1:06:26] and he would start singing and I noticed
[1:06:28] she would she was a large lady so she
[1:06:30] should take her hands and she'll just
[1:06:31] cut patent the seat
[1:06:33] and then a few minutes later she started
[1:06:35] doing this and she was so such a large
[1:06:38] lady pretty soon the tears were flowing
[1:06:40] and she was going like this she was just
[1:06:41] and I always wondered and you know the
[1:06:44] spirit was all over the church and I
[1:06:45] always wondered how because somebody
[1:06:48] whose husband beat her who uh wouldn't
[1:06:51] wouldn't would cuss her out every time
[1:06:54] she walked out the door to go to church
[1:06:55] how could she be so faithful and how
[1:06:58] could she cry when Daddy saying oh Lord
[1:07:00] you've been so good to me it took a few
[1:07:03] years later but I found out what what
[1:07:06] made her cry because she was in love
[1:07:08] with God more than she was in love with
[1:07:10] anything else praise God
[1:07:15] the solo church we had a and this is it
[1:07:19] was just small and we didn't have very
[1:07:21] many people come by Brother John we was
[1:07:24] too far out off the track for them to
[1:07:25] come but every now and then there'd be a
[1:07:27] preacher that'd come by
[1:07:28] and this part is important now because
[1:07:30] it's amoeba you'll understand a little
[1:07:32] bit later on I went up to get prayer at
[1:07:34] the end of the end of the service and uh
[1:07:36] I remember the preacher he was he was a
[1:07:39] young guy he was from out west you know
[1:07:41] that was really big to us it was like
[1:07:42] millions of miles away
[1:07:44] but when he prayed for me I started to
[1:07:47] turn around and walk off and then he
[1:07:49] said little boy
[1:07:50] and I stopped
[1:07:52] he said are you be a good little boy
[1:07:54] and you obey your mom and daddy
[1:07:56] he said because when you get older the
[1:07:58] Lord's going to use you and I thought
[1:08:00] I'd never been out of the County uh how
[1:08:03] is it going to use me of course I
[1:08:04] couldn't really understand what he's
[1:08:05] saying he said you have a Ministry that
[1:08:09] will affect many nations and so my mom
[1:08:11] and daddy thought I was going to be a
[1:08:12] preacher oh they just Terry's gonna
[1:08:14] preach and I'd get in trouble and get
[1:08:15] mean or get revised I said Son you
[1:08:17] better you better buy that calling you
[1:08:19] know you know you better do what God's
[1:08:21] told you to do but instead of making me
[1:08:23] uh
[1:08:24] instead of making me want to do I
[1:08:26] started running from that and I just I
[1:08:29] didn't we we sung and I'd go sing and
[1:08:32] then about 12 or 13. I became real
[1:08:34] rebellious
[1:08:35] young boys always over by your mom and
[1:08:37] daddy always do what they say
[1:08:40] but I become real rebellious
[1:08:43] and the more the more that the Lord
[1:08:45] would speak to me that son you know you
[1:08:47] remember that little Sunday night our
[1:08:49] Sunday morning you remember that you
[1:08:51] know that preacher and I would just turn
[1:08:53] to rock music up louder just I just
[1:08:55] tried to drown it out
[1:08:56] and I got I got to the point where I got
[1:09:00] so disobedient one day I ran away from
[1:09:01] home
[1:09:02] and stayed gone for two or three days
[1:09:05] and finally came back
[1:09:07] just just just do it Opposite from what
[1:09:11] God did
[1:09:12] asked me to do
[1:09:14] and that's why I could say God's rich
[1:09:16] and mercy one night and I want to say
[1:09:18] this for the young people one night
[1:09:21] I was working in a fast food restaurant
[1:09:24] and the manager said
[1:09:26] uh Terry when we get through working
[1:09:29] tonight we're closing the store so we'll
[1:09:30] get through working he said we're having
[1:09:33] a party in my house and so I said okay
[1:09:35] that's that's good I'll come over he
[1:09:37] said we won't have a party he said so
[1:09:39] we're gonna have the good stuff
[1:09:42] I didn't know what good stuff meant I
[1:09:44] just was going to the party
[1:09:49] but when uh when I got to the party
[1:09:52] we were sitting around the table
[1:09:54] and somebody brought out joints
[1:09:58] and uh you know I never been high or
[1:10:00] anything like that I know there's people
[1:10:02] here may have experienced that
[1:10:05] but uh I'm sitting at the table
[1:10:07] and they passed the joint in the God
[1:10:10] said we passed it around I just take a
[1:10:12] pool take a pull and I knew better I
[1:10:13] knew something inside was said boy
[1:10:15] you're in the wrong place doing the
[1:10:16] wrong thing
[1:10:18] and I was there
[1:10:20] and all at once they brought the snoo
[1:10:21] joint out
[1:10:22] and they said now everybody just take a
[1:10:24] real small pull on this one but I was
[1:10:27] going to be cool because I I didn't feel
[1:10:30] anything brother John it's just just
[1:10:31] sitting there so I started to smoke this
[1:10:34] joint and when I I took a big draw off
[1:10:37] of it handed it to the person beside me
[1:10:39] and would come back around to me I took
[1:10:41] another big draw off of it well when I
[1:10:43] started to hand it to the next person I
[1:10:45] blacked out I didn't know where I was at
[1:10:48] I didn't know what was going on and all
[1:10:52] I could see was commotion I could see
[1:10:54] people saying that the rock music was
[1:10:56] blaring they said turn it turn turn the
[1:10:58] music now turn the music down they
[1:10:59] turned the music down and I could see
[1:11:01] him
[1:11:03] I it was this most horrible feeling what
[1:11:06] they didn't tell me what I didn't know
[1:11:08] at the time is it they had they would
[1:11:10] sprinkle it with angel dust and I didn't
[1:11:13] know I was my parents were out of town

[1:11:25] trip I couldn't say anything I just
[1:11:28] seemed emotion I just seen what was
[1:11:29] going on and I was begging everything in
[1:11:33] my heart and my mind because I couldn't
[1:11:35] say anything I was saying Lord please
[1:11:36] please don't let me die like this please
[1:11:39] don't let me die like this because I
[1:11:41] knew that uh it'd be a horrible thing
[1:11:43] for my parents to have to deal with and
[1:11:45] I and I didn't want to go to hell and I
[1:11:47] said please God hours and hours went and

[1:11:55] me they did everything they could to try
[1:11:56] to bring me down make me drink coffee I
[1:11:58] got up to go to go out the door I was
[1:12:01] going trying to go through the wall
[1:12:03] never ever ever get messed up with the
[1:12:06] account of drugs
[1:12:08] and I told the Lord I said Lord if you
[1:12:10] would deliver me and let me come back in
[1:12:12] my right mind I promise you I will never
[1:12:16] ever touch drugs again
[1:12:18] so I I couldn't I couldn't go home so
[1:12:21] they carried me to my sister's house
[1:12:23] and they just put me to bed and I slept
[1:12:26] I slept for slipping off for up to three
[1:12:29] days but for the next seven or eight
[1:12:31] months I could be standing talking to
[1:12:33] you and I'd have a I like going to start
[1:12:36] to go on a trip and I would like not see

[1:12:42] and that's are you okay you okay but I
[1:12:45] said God if you'll just give me back my
[1:12:47] mind and I got so depressed after that

[1:12:53] I was going to be what I was going to be
[1:12:54] doing I could be all at once just
[1:12:55] talking like we are now my mind would

[1:14:45] off the phone I didn't feel much
[1:14:47] different I still felt suicidal I felt
[1:14:50] like giving up but the very next day I
[1:14:53] woke up things were lighter I didn't
[1:14:55] have that suicide feeling or that down
[1:14:58] feeling like I wanted to hurt myself
[1:15:00] within a week I was back to me
[1:15:03] and I promised the Lord I said now
[1:15:05] that's one promise I never I broke a lot
[1:15:08] of promises that's one promise you know
[1:15:10] folks I never ever ever went back home
[1:15:14] never touched drugs again
[1:15:17] we were we at the little church uh we
[1:15:20] had I I kind of let this out and I want
[1:15:22] to bring this in and my sister Kay she
[1:15:26] was 12 years old she would had a bad ear
[1:15:29] infection in her ears and she and she
[1:15:31] got sicker and sicker and sicker and
[1:15:33] sicker not only the doctors told her my
[1:15:36] parents that we don't know what's wrong
[1:15:37] with your your daughter
[1:15:38] uh but we know this that her ear drum
[1:15:42] one ear drum is almost completely gone
[1:15:44] the other's now starting to disappear
[1:15:46] and she's having migraines in and out of
[1:15:48] the hospital throwing up running high
[1:15:50] fevers and they spent all they could do
[1:15:52] trying to get her well
[1:15:55] one day my uncle came over
[1:15:58] and he said I tell you what he said it
[1:16:01] and that's my I told my mom it's his
[1:16:02] sister brother Branham is going to be in
[1:16:05] Birmingham Alabama
[1:16:07] I believe if you'll take Kay down there
[1:16:09] I believe God will heal her
[1:16:11] and so uh daddy that that had all of all
[1:16:15] the Pentecostal preachers had already
[1:16:16] prayed for and she couldn't she hadn't
[1:16:18] gotten no better
[1:16:21] so um
[1:16:23] they decided to take her decorated here
[1:16:25] see brother Branham and so my mom my dad
[1:16:28] my uncle and aunt and took my little
[1:16:30] sister our big sister took her
[1:16:32] to uh Birmingham
[1:16:34] brother Brandon preached in the Armory
[1:16:36] there and my dad said when uh now he had
[1:16:40] heard of brother Branham he had heard it
[1:16:41] now he was a Pentecostal preacher but he
[1:16:43] heard brother Brandon was a good man and
[1:16:45] had great Miracles and you know that's
[1:16:47] that's just that was the extent of what
[1:16:48] he knew of brother Branham
[1:16:50] but he said that when I walked in the
[1:16:53] arena there armored there armor building
[1:16:56] he said it was just like regular service
[1:16:58] and everybody trying to get in everybody
[1:17:00] and said when they finally got in they
[1:17:02] said uh the service was just normal
[1:17:04] nothing different it said then uh
[1:17:06] brother Branham walked out
[1:17:09] and said good evening friends my dad
[1:17:12] said I began to cry
[1:17:13] he said I looked over at my Mama she's
[1:17:15] crying he said I started looking around
[1:17:17] and everybody in the audience was crying
[1:17:20] he said the very presence of that man
[1:17:22] who walked on the platform was different
[1:17:24] from any man that I'd ever ever seen
[1:17:27] and he said he just simply said good
[1:17:29] evening friends
[1:17:30] and and he preached a sermon a powerful
[1:17:34] sermon the next night he preached the
[1:17:36] next day Sunday at two he preached again
[1:17:37] and my sister got a prayer card
[1:17:40] and so she was at the end of the service
[1:17:42] as brother Branham as you know did he
[1:17:45] called for the prayer cards to come up
[1:17:46] they called out the numbers my sister
[1:17:49] got called
[1:17:50] and she was standing there in the line
[1:17:52] and she's only 12 years old she's just a
[1:17:55] little girl and I've asked her so many
[1:17:56] times I'd say
[1:17:58] how did that feel coming up to brother
[1:18:01] Brown to pray for you she said all I
[1:18:04] know is you know then had preachers pray
[1:18:06] for her and that and and this is this is
[1:18:09] fine I mean that would just holler real
[1:18:11] loud and that shout and screaming that's
[1:18:13] fun I mean I'm I'm hyper myself but
[1:18:17] brother Putnam didn't do that
[1:18:19] he just he said come here young lady she
[1:18:22] walked up to him he didn't even didn't
[1:18:23] even lay his hand on her head he just
[1:18:25] pulled her up to his side and said
[1:18:28] I adjure you in the name of the Lord
[1:18:30] Jesus Christ to take your hands off of
[1:18:32] this little girl Satan
[1:18:34] she walked back to her seat
[1:18:36] went back to the doctor
[1:18:38] oh he she said okay how are you here now
[1:18:41] that ear she said I hear you just fine
[1:18:44] he stopped up the other so how are you
[1:18:46] here now this year you can't hear said
[1:18:48] your eardrum's gone and you only have
[1:18:49] part of one she said I here's just fine
[1:18:52] from that time on she'd never had
[1:18:54] another problem she never had another
[1:18:56] fever never was put in
[1:18:59] never went back to the hospital
[1:19:03] so that's how we first started brother
[1:19:05] random and so his voice became very
[1:19:07] familiar at our house
[1:19:09] but uh I've often wondered I said okay
[1:19:13] what did you think would you when he you
[1:19:15] walked up to him she said all I know
[1:19:17] Terry is I was going to get healed
[1:19:20] and she lives about 20 20 minutes from
[1:19:23] us right now she's all she's just as
[1:19:25] good as never had no more problems with
[1:19:26] that I tell you God is a wonderful God
[1:19:30] well I repented after I got on the drugs
[1:19:32] I said Lord you know I can't I just
[1:19:34] can't live this life and I repented and
[1:19:36] we started back singing and uh came in
[1:19:39] one afternoon and I sat down and I wrote
[1:19:41] a song
[1:19:42] and it was called
[1:19:44] in the in the Garden of Eden the human
[1:19:47] race began when God took the dust from
[1:19:51] the earth and made a man he told him to
[1:19:53] multiply on Earth to complete his plan
[1:19:56] can you imagine just how he felt when
[1:19:58] the nails went through his hands so I
[1:20:01] wrote that and finished the song my dad
[1:20:03] came in I said dad I wrote a song today
[1:20:05] so that was the first song I ever wrote
[1:20:07] in my dad said son that's a good song
[1:20:09] there and so we started singing that
[1:20:11] song
[1:20:12] and we continue to sing and then uh I
[1:20:15] went down to Georgia now like I said
[1:20:17] last night I went down to Georgia and I
[1:20:19] got her and she didn't ask me to marry I
[1:20:22] asked her to marry me
[1:20:23] and we got married
[1:20:25] and uh
[1:20:27] it wasn't maybe two years to three years
[1:20:30] after we were married I
[1:20:32] I came home one day we came out from
[1:20:34] work one day and think he was sick now
[1:20:36] she's she's one of those people have
[1:20:38] never threw up
[1:20:39] that's just you just don't get sick like
[1:20:41] that and so she was about to throw up
[1:20:44] and I said honey what's wrong with you
[1:20:45] she said I don't know I don't know I'm
[1:20:48] just sick well we found out she's gonna
[1:20:50] have another a little baby and we were
[1:20:53] so excited and we uh she carried the
[1:20:56] baby up she started getting the toxemia
[1:21:00] about six seven months and then she
[1:21:02] swelled up her hand swelled her face
[1:21:05] fell swelled her feet swelled
[1:21:07] and we went and sung one weekend on the
[1:21:10] way back she started she started having
[1:21:13] more issues
[1:21:15] I got up and went on to work the next
[1:21:16] morning we were just young and we're
[1:21:18] happy and excited
[1:21:20] and I got a phone call about the middle
[1:21:22] of the day and it was my sister said
[1:21:23] Terry you need to come to the hospital
[1:21:25] right now
[1:21:26] he said you're having your baby today
[1:21:28] that's all she said so I told my boss I
[1:21:31] said okay we're having a baby and I was
[1:21:32] high-fiving on the way out and
[1:21:34] when I walked through a corridor and I
[1:21:36] walked into the room
[1:21:38] she wasn't there was no doctors there
[1:21:41] was no nurses there there's the room and
[1:21:42] she was laying there on the bed and she
[1:21:44] was kind of curled up and she was facing
[1:21:46] the wall
[1:21:48] and I said hey I'm here honey where's
[1:21:50] the baby I'm here and she didn't move
[1:21:53] I said
[1:21:54] where what's wrong and she slowly turned
[1:21:57] around
[1:21:58] and her she had cried so hard her eyes
[1:22:01] were kind of matted together just
[1:22:05] the baby didn't make it and so that
[1:22:09] really shook my life and I don't know if
[1:22:11] you've experienced Tim my son here it's
[1:22:13] we lost his baby two years ago it was
[1:22:17] like living it all over again
[1:22:19] but that shook my life that man I
[1:22:21] thought man why did that happen you know
[1:22:24] am I reaping what I saw do you know how
[1:22:26] the devil will come to you and just
[1:22:27] torment your mind and so I continued to
[1:22:30] write songs and we continue to sing and
[1:22:32] one day at church one night at church
[1:22:36] Vicki had went to church and I had to
[1:22:38] work and she's sitting way in the back
[1:22:40] of the building anybody ever heard of
[1:22:41] brother Billy Andrews
[1:22:44] brother Billy at the end of the service
[1:22:46] said sister Vicki and that was probably
[1:22:48] about 300 people there 250 300 sister
[1:22:50] Vicki would you stand up
[1:22:53] and she stood up and he said
[1:22:56] the Holy Spirit told me to tell you he's
[1:22:59] going to give you the desire of your
[1:23:01] heart anything you want stand up now
[1:23:04] look we already lost one baby seven
[1:23:06] eight eight months she got pregnant
[1:23:08] again we lost that one she got pregnant
[1:23:10] again we lost that one and it just it
[1:23:12] was like was ever going to have kids so
[1:23:14] she said Lord I just left in my hand and
[1:23:16] said you know I want a baby I want to be
[1:23:18] a mother nine months later that big tall
[1:23:21] thing came along right there
[1:23:24] wasn't long
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:30] wouldn't long after that that thing came
[1:23:33] and then they got another book that came
[1:23:35] and I went back to brother Andrew and
[1:23:37] said stop praying stop praying we have
[1:23:38] enough kids right now
[1:23:41] but we had one more girl into so that
[1:23:43] just goes to show you that God he's
[1:23:46] concerned about you no matter what he's
[1:23:48] concerned
[1:23:50] I uh my mom and dad were were the kind
[1:23:53] of Christians that um we trusted God I
[1:23:57] guess you know nothing wrong with going
[1:23:59] to doctors and Fields but they just just
[1:24:01] trusted God and just if we had a problem
[1:24:03] you know we just prayed and uh one one
[1:24:07] night the most unfortunate thing
[1:24:09] happened
[1:24:11] are y'all bored
[1:24:14] one of the most unfortunate thing
[1:24:15] happened I got a call with my mom and
[1:24:18] she said Terry I've got the doctor says
[1:24:20] I have cancer
[1:24:21] well that shook me to the core because
[1:24:23] you know my dad was a fake preaching uh
[1:24:26] believed in Miracles and not seen I've
[1:24:28] seen them myself
[1:24:30] and I thought well Mama it should be
[1:24:33] fine I mean you just don't you know it's
[1:24:34] gonna be fine well she got sicker they
[1:24:37] had to go in and do surgery on her and
[1:24:39] while she was in surgery my dad had a
[1:24:42] heart attack
[1:24:43] so she was on the third floor as I said
[1:24:45] he was on the seventh floor so we'd go
[1:24:48] in and see Dad and then we'll go in and
[1:24:50] go back down and see Mom and it was just
[1:24:52] a horrible time I thought man why is
[1:24:55] this happening
[1:24:57] then a good friend of mine brother Billy
[1:24:59] Andrews fell out of a tree and almost
[1:25:02] died so Vicky and I went to the hospital
[1:25:04] to see him and when we went
[1:25:07] uh I found a little plaque in the gift
[1:25:09] shop that said he will make this trial a
[1:25:13] blessing and I told Vic I said let's
[1:25:15] just get this for brother Andrews so we
[1:25:17] got it for him and he's going on and the
[1:25:19] family was so gracious not long ago to
[1:25:21] give the plaque back to us that would
[1:25:23] give him but he willed uh he wouldn't he
[1:25:27] came home he got okay but on uh one day
[1:25:30] I got to give it to him on a Saturday
[1:25:32] and on Monday all all weekend long he
[1:25:34] will make this child blessing we're just
[1:25:35] stuck in my head and I just couldn't get
[1:25:37] it out so I went to work and I started
[1:25:40] down and now driving no for forklift you
[1:25:43] all know what those are I jumped off
[1:25:45] that thing and I grabbed me a piece of
[1:25:47] paper off a slat and I wrote I'll just
[1:25:50] come into a valley like I've never been
[1:25:52] before I keep searching for a way out
[1:25:55] seems like padlocks are on the door oh
[1:25:58] there must be another Sunrise another
[1:25:59] Sunset that I'll see God will make this
[1:26:02] child a blessing that's the love he has
[1:26:04] for me it came as fast as I could write
[1:26:06] it
[1:26:07] and I wrote the course and I wrote the
[1:26:09] second verse and I thought man this is
[1:26:12] really going to be a good song because
[1:26:13] you know it just really touched me
[1:26:15] so we sung at several places but it
[1:26:18] never felt like it was finished if
[1:26:20] you're an author you know what I'm
[1:26:21] talking about if you're writing a book
[1:26:22] you you don't have that that it's just
[1:26:25] don't it's not finished we call it green
[1:26:27] if you're a writer but I wrote that song
[1:26:29] and we sang it and never felt like a had
[1:26:31] it finished but when I was standing in
[1:26:34] the hospital and mama was on the third
[1:26:36] floor daddy is on the seventh floor
[1:26:38] I was questioning God I said God why why
[1:26:40] would you let this happen to my parents
[1:26:42] I mean it's just hard for me to
[1:26:44] understand
[1:26:45] then
[1:26:47] my dad got out but my mom after several
[1:26:50] months and she began sicker and sicker
[1:26:52] and sicker
[1:26:55] finally I went up to the hospital and
[1:26:57] I'd still I stayed with her and I'd been
[1:26:59] there with her and we uh spent the hot
[1:27:02] spent the whole day with her I just went
[1:27:03] home I got a phone call about
[1:27:06] just about an hour after I got it in bed
[1:27:09] my sister said uh Terry Mama's blood
[1:27:12] pressure has dropped twice
[1:27:14] she said I'm scared I said well call me
[1:27:16] back if it drops again that wasn't five
[1:27:18] minutes you called me back said just
[1:27:20] drop it again
[1:27:21] so I jumped in the car and I raced to
[1:27:23] the hospital
[1:27:25] I remember walking up going up the
[1:27:27] stairs or the elevator and getting going
[1:27:29] down that long haul dreading walking in
[1:27:32] the drawer opened the door there was
[1:27:34] those big blue eyes looking at me that
[1:27:36] that picked me up that I remember that
[1:27:39] said y'all go in there and pray that the
[1:27:41] Lord is and give your Brothers sister
[1:27:44] shoes
[1:27:45] I just so many members was going through
[1:27:48] my mind and there she laid
[1:27:50] and uh
[1:27:51] I I just supporting long after the
[1:27:53] doctor came and said y'all need to call
[1:27:55] the family and
[1:27:57] one of the most hardest darkest times
[1:27:59] that I've ever been in in my life
[1:28:02] I don't know I don't mind telling you I
[1:28:03] was a mama's boy I got three Mama's Boys
[1:28:06] they're all Mama's Boys but I was real
[1:28:09] close to Mom I'd call her every day from
[1:28:11] work because it was long distance from
[1:28:13] my house I'd call and say hey how are
[1:28:14] you daddy doing well I was just sitting
[1:28:17] there
[1:28:18] she got worse and worse and finally all
[1:28:21] the family came in and the doctor come
[1:28:23] knocked on the door and he said
[1:28:25] hey if
[1:28:28] if y'all want to we'll put it on life
[1:28:29] support
[1:28:30] he said it may keep her
[1:28:33] another half a day or so well she was so
[1:28:36] weak she could hardly even move they
[1:28:37] already put oxygen on her but she
[1:28:39] motioned with her head for my sister to
[1:28:42] come back
[1:28:43] and my sister came back over and my mom
[1:28:45] she lifted up for oxygen got down my mom
[1:28:47] said I don't want that I want y'all to
[1:28:50] sing Amazing Grace
[1:28:52] and so we all walked back into
[1:28:54] the gathered around her bed there
[1:28:57] and my daddy began singing through many
[1:28:59] dangers told the snares
[1:29:02] I have already come
[1:29:04] was faith that brought me safe this far
[1:29:07] it is gracefully Beyond we sit around
[1:29:10] her bedside that night and I tell you
[1:29:13] what if I live to be a hundred I'd never
[1:29:15] forget that feeling at this presence of
[1:29:18] the Lord just swept in the room
[1:29:20] each one of us dealt down and told her
[1:29:23] by she told us bye
[1:29:25] and then she settled back in the bed and
[1:29:28] started raised her hands and start
[1:29:30] praising the Lord
[1:29:32] and then
[1:29:34] somewhere around two or three that
[1:29:38] morning
[1:29:38] maybe four because the sun was just
[1:29:41] starting to come up over the horizon I
[1:29:42] walked over
[1:29:43] looked out the window
[1:29:45] and there she'd pass you they let her
[1:29:47] stay in the room with us and I started
[1:29:49] thinking now I'm standing on the
[1:29:52] mountain
[1:29:53] I wasn't there yet but by faith I will
[1:29:56] get there looking back I can see
[1:29:58] when I was in the slowest Valley his
[1:30:01] strong hand was leading me
[1:30:03] oh it's good to see the sunshine and the
[1:30:06] face Sweet Victory
[1:30:08] God has made this child a blessing
[1:30:10] that's the love he has free
[1:30:13] I wrote that in
[1:30:16] about two months before Mama passed
[1:30:20] we went over to her house and she was
[1:30:21] she was up walking there she just went
[1:30:24] down fast so she was up walking and
[1:30:26] and we're just visiting that afternoon
[1:30:28] and she said let's get ready to leave
[1:30:30] and she said my brother and his wife and
[1:30:32] the kids were all there she said Terry
[1:30:36] if you if you'll you'll play I'll sing
[1:30:38] Oh that tore the heart out of me I said
[1:30:42] sure Mom I'll play and so she came over
[1:30:45] and sit right down on the piano right
[1:30:46] beside me
[1:30:48] and she picked up the book and I said
[1:30:50] what do you want to sing mama
[1:30:54] and she said she picked up the old hymn
[1:30:57] book she flipped she said let's sing
[1:30:58] this one let's just sing this song I
[1:31:00] love this song she started singing
[1:31:03] I care not today what tomorrow may bring
[1:31:05] it's Shadow or sunshine or rain for the
[1:31:09] Lord I know ruleth over everything and
[1:31:11] All My worry is vain I'm living by faith
[1:31:15] it was all I could do to sit on the
[1:31:17] piano with her
[1:31:18] and she flipped so let's think this one
[1:31:21] and then she started singing I can
[1:31:23] almost see the lights of home
[1:31:25] I thought my heart would break I thought
[1:31:27] Mom I can't do this no more she's not
[1:31:29] getting a clear voice and she's let's
[1:31:31] sing one more let's sing one more
[1:31:33] and the last song I ever heard my mama
[1:31:36] sing
[1:31:37] he started singing
[1:31:39] we read of a place that's called heaven
[1:31:42] it's made for the pure and the free
[1:31:44] these truths and God's word he has given
[1:31:47] how beautiful Heaven Must Be
[1:31:50] and it wasn't long after that she got to
[1:31:52] view heaven and all this splendor
[1:31:56] well you kept singing it was so hard for
[1:31:58] me to even focus on anything
[1:32:01] thank you it was hard for me to focus on
[1:32:03] anything because I was just tore to
[1:32:05] pieces
[1:32:07] and
[1:32:08] I just I told Vicky one day I said I'm
[1:32:11] gonna I'm gonna go riding I went to work
[1:32:14] and I just couldn't work I I went out
[1:32:17] and I sat in a car and said eat with all
[1:32:18] the other guys I'd go sit in my car
[1:32:21] and one day I was just really frustrated
[1:32:24] I was just thinking you know you know
[1:32:26] how you get some time you know we think
[1:32:28] well God owes us something or you know
[1:32:30] we at least tell me why you did this and
[1:32:33] but uh I went in the car and I sat down
[1:32:36] in my car and I was just really torn up
[1:32:38] and as soon as I sit down in my car I re
[1:32:41] turned the radio on
[1:32:43] and a choir was singing
[1:32:45] and I felt some presence and I know we
[1:32:49] all have to answer for what we say on
[1:32:50] that day and God knows this is the truth
[1:32:52] I felt the presence come in my truck and
[1:32:55] I felt somebody sit down beside me
[1:32:57] I didn't see nobody but the song started
[1:33:00] singing by and by when the morning comes
[1:33:02] when all God sinks we'll gather down the
[1:33:05] throne we'll tell the story we'll
[1:33:07] understand it better by and by and that
[1:33:09] was like God was speaking to me son just
[1:33:12] wait a few just a little longer I'll
[1:33:14] tell you
[1:33:15] and so I uh I just couldn't get over it
[1:33:20] and so one day I took off work and one
[1:33:22] day I told Vicky I'm gonna go riding
[1:33:24] and I don't know how y'all do but we
[1:33:26] didn't have we didn't have CDs back in
[1:33:28] we just had cassettes and so I started
[1:33:31] riding I pushed the cassette in the
[1:33:32] brother Brandon said
[1:33:33] he said I go out to Tucson he said and
[1:33:36] I'm not at home he said I come back to
[1:33:38] Jeffersonville I'm not at home
[1:33:40] I grabbed my pen I wrote there is the
[1:33:43] land I'm homesick for it though I've
[1:33:46] never seen it before I've got loved ones
[1:33:49] on the other Shore there is the land
[1:33:50] that's how I wrote that song
[1:33:52] not long ago maybe it's been two times
[1:33:56] every month every six or six months
[1:33:58] where the writers get a check you know
[1:34:01] it's not much but you get a little check
[1:34:03] for the songs that you wrote
[1:34:05] that other groups have recorded it and
[1:34:08] uh
[1:34:09] I just want to tell you guys here let
[1:34:12] you listen to this because you don't
[1:34:14] know what God's got in store for you
[1:34:16] I I went to the mailbox one day and I
[1:34:19] opened up the check from BMI broadcast
[1:34:21] music Incorporated
[1:34:23] and it was different than the other
[1:34:25] chicks had a paper staple to it it said
[1:34:28] International
[1:34:30] and then it said here's a list of the
[1:34:33] countries who've played your song and it
[1:34:34] listed 32 countries that had played my
[1:34:37] song I will make this child a blessing
[1:34:40] and I heard that little preacher said
[1:34:43] little boy
[1:34:45] you be good you obey your parents
[1:34:47] because you have a Ministry that'll
[1:34:49] speak to many nations and that that I
[1:34:53] that prophecy was fulfilled It Ever Was
[1:34:55] to preach but it was to sing and write
[1:34:57] the songs
[1:34:59] so God if God can use me
[1:35:02] he can use you
[1:35:04] his grace is good for me it's good for
[1:35:07] you and I want the family to come back
[1:35:09] we want to sing a I want to sing a
[1:35:11] couple more songs but that's that's how
[1:35:13] I started writing some folks say
[1:35:15] I wish you'd write another God will make
[1:35:17] this child a blessing well you go
[1:35:19] through the trial and I'll write it for
[1:35:21] you
[1:35:22] because you know it's easy it's easy to
[1:35:25] sing them but it sometimes it's very
[1:35:27] hard to uh to write him can we just give
[1:35:30] the Lord a big campus of Grace
