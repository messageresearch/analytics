[39:13] be in service with y'all but uh but here
[39:16] we are so I do appreciate the
[39:17] opportunity to be ministering I pray

[39:31] bread and blessed it and break it and
[39:34] gave it to the disciples and said take
[39:36] eat this is my body and he took the cup
[39:40] and gave thanks and gave it to them
[39:42] saying drink ye all of it for this is my
[39:45] blood of the new testament which is shed
[39:47] for many for the remission of sins are
[39:50] you thankful for that can we bow our
[39:52] heads this morning dear gracious
[39:54] Heavenly Father Lord how honored we are
[39:57] father to to come into your house Lord
[39:59] and thank you for the opportunity for to
[40:02] have a place God that we can come and
[40:04] feel your presence draw near us God God
[40:07] I know there's there's new faces father
[40:09] I'm I'm new to the people lord they're
[40:10] new to me but I ask that you help us to
[40:13] all just get comfortable Lord may we
[40:15] rely on your spirit God and as the word
[40:17] would come forth God I ask that you
[40:19] would speak to the needs Lord speak to
[40:21] the hearts God where we're a needy
[40:24] people Lord all of us have decisions
[40:26] that need to be made made Lord all of us
[40:28] have problems we're facing Lord battles
[40:30] we're going through I ask that you would
[40:32] come in a in a sweet way this morning
[40:34] God may your spirit walk the aisles Lord
[40:37] and touch needs and circumstances like
[40:39] only you can father Lord I lay myself
[40:42] aside Lord and surrender to you I ask
[40:44] that you would speak this morning we lay
[40:46] this service into your hands in Jesus
[40:49] name amen you may be seated this morning
[40:53] uh my subject is going to be a positive
[40:55] token and brother would tell us that we
[40:58] live off of dead substance right he says
[41:01] whatever we eat something had to die in
[41:03] order for us to live he says if you eat
[41:05] a hamburger the cow had to die if you
[41:08] eat bacon in the morning the pig had to
[41:10] die he says even for the vegetarians if
[41:13] you eat vegetables or fruit it had to
[41:15] Die the if you drink milk the bacteria
[41:18] had to die and so naturally to live we
[41:22] have to live off of dead substance and
[41:23] brother Brandon would tell us that's the
[41:25] same thing uh spirit as well we have we
[41:28] live off of dead substance something had
[41:31] to die in order for us to live and we
[41:34] would see through the Old Testament that
[41:36] they would come to the Tabernacle and
[41:38] would slay a lamb and that lamb was
[41:40] taking the punishment for their sins and
[41:42] the blood would pour upon them and would
[41:45] cover their sins that they would commit
[41:47] or would have committed already but you
[41:49] would notice that there would be
[41:51] forgiveness under the blood of bulls and
[41:53] goats but there was no separation there
[41:56] was no remission the Bible would tell us
[41:59] in Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a
[42:02] shadow of good things to come not the
[42:04] very image of those things can never
[42:07] with those sacrifices which they offered
[42:10] year by year continually make the comers
[42:13] there unto perfect in other words it was
[42:16] a shadow of a good thing to come but not
[42:19] the image but when the image would come
[42:22] it would be the Perfection that it was
[42:24] pointing to you know so when the blood
[42:27] of Christ would come it would not just
[42:29] forgive the sins but it would bring a
[42:31] remission because there in the in the
[42:33] Old Testament if you would come for
[42:36] telling a lie and say Lord I'm sorry for
[42:38] telling a lie the blood would pour upon
[42:40] you you know and you would be forgiven
[42:42] but you would live with the you would
[42:43] leave with a sin nature right then you
[42:45] would come back the next year I'm sorry
[42:47] for telling a lie the next year I'm
[42:49] sorry for telling a lie it would be a
[42:52] cycle because it was only a shadow of
[42:55] the thing to come but when the blood of
[42:57] Christ come it wasn't a cycle it wasn't
[43:00] a shadow but it was the very image to
[43:03] bring a separation and the word
[43:05] remission means separated released from
[43:08] prison or bondage so the blood of Christ
[43:11] would not just forgive you but it would
[43:14] separate you that whenever you would
[43:16] leave you would leave a different person
[43:19] so I don't believe we got to we have to
[43:20] be in a cycle you come this morning
[43:22] saying God I'm sorry for doing this next
[43:25] Sunday God I'm sorry for doing doing
[43:27] this next Sunday I'm sorry for doing
[43:29] this and it's a cycle but the blood of
[43:32] Christ has come to break the cycle that
[43:34] you can live in a remission a separation
[43:38] and I think it's pretty incredible that
[43:40] it was sin that would separate man from
[43:43] God but sin separated from man brings
[43:46] you back to God and I believe that's
[43:48] what the what the blood of Christ has
[43:50] done and I like how the Bible would put
[43:52] it that under the blood of bulls and
[43:53] goats there's a remembrance made for sin
[43:57] every year but under the blood of Christ
[43:59] the Bible would say this because that
[44:01] the worshipper once purged should have
[44:04] no more conscience of sins in other
[44:07] words under the Old Testament blood
[44:09] there's a remembrance you remember
[44:11] there's there's still a nature of it but
[44:13] under the blood of Christ there's no
[44:15] more conscience so the very desire that
[44:18] would be there to sin is now gone but we
[44:22] would see that it wasn't the literal
[44:24] blood of Jesus but it was the life of
[44:27] the blood because if all you see is the
[44:29] chemical the blood of Jesus you're going
[44:31] to remain in the cycle but if you see
[44:34] the life of it which is the token the
[44:37] Holy Ghost and that brings you out of a
[44:39] cycle out of a tradition out of an idea
[44:42] to a life that the very life that was
[44:45] inside of Jesus Christ can come back
[44:48] upon the believer you know brother
[44:51] Brandon going talk about what would I do
[44:53] if I had two drops of the blood of Jesus
[44:55] y'all remember him talking about about
[44:57] that he says if I had it in a charger or
[44:59] in a cup he said I would walk so
[45:02] reverently I would walk so humbly
[45:04] because I didn't want to spill it
[45:06] because it was the blood of Jesus and
[45:08] but he says there's somebody something
[45:10] in front of me that is more important
[45:12] than the blood of Jesus it's the
[45:14] purchase of the blood of Jesus we might
[45:17] not have the literal blood today but
[45:19] we've got the purchase of what the blood
[45:22] has bought the blood has bought our
[45:24] forgiveness our freedom our separation
[45:27] and we're setting here today not with
[45:29] the lital blood but with the life that
[45:31] has purchased it and that's what I love
[45:33] about this message it has brought us out
[45:35] of a form into the life of it because
[45:38] we're thankful for the cross but what
[45:40] has it done for me you know I was
[45:41] listening to the rising of the Sun and
[45:44] brother brandom says we we all celebrate
[45:46] Easter but what has it done what does
[45:48] Easter mean to me you know and so the
[45:50] cross is more than just a crucifix but
[45:54] it has done something for us the blood
[45:56] is more more than just a story or a song
[45:59] but it has done something for us and
[46:01] brother Brandon would tell us that it
[46:02] was God releasing his life whenever he
[46:05] was upon the cross and the blood cell
[46:07] was broken it was God releasing himself
[46:11] to come back into a body again and so
[46:14] the cross is more than a crucifix it is
[46:16] the life of God being released to bring
[46:19] a separation from the very desires of
[46:23] sin and the Bible would tell us in
[46:25] Hebrews 10:1 17 and their sins and
[46:28] iniquities will I remember no more like
[46:31] I said earlier it's not just a
[46:33] forgiveness it's a separation so when
[46:36] God looks at you he don't see sins he
[46:38] sees the blood when God looks at you he
[46:41] don't see faults and mistakes a and
[46:43] generational curses but whenever he
[46:45] looks at you he sees something that was
[46:48] a part of him to bring you back to him
[46:51] you know brother Brandon would say when
[46:52] he looks at you he don't see you he sees
[46:55] your representation which is the blood
[46:58] he says he hears your voice but he sees
[47:00] the blood and I'm so thankful that we
[47:03] had a blood that was a perfect blood to
[47:06] bring a perfect loosening you see men
[47:08] have been trying to live good lives
[47:10] they've been trying to be good
[47:11] Christians but there was no possible way
[47:14] in a human nature to do it but the blood
[47:17] of Christ the life of the blood the Holy
[47:20] Ghost has brought us something that we
[47:22] don't have we're not just Christians on
[47:24] Sundays or on Wednesdays but it's the
[47:27] token that has brought the positive into
[47:30] the negative to bring to bring forth the
[47:32] Life of Christ oh brother Brandon would
[47:35] say this and since it is the blood of
[47:37] God it is a perfect blood and if the
[47:40] perfect blood is loosening us from the
[47:42] power and and bondage and defilement of
[47:45] sin then the loosening is perfect and
[47:48] complete there was now therefore no
[47:51] condemnation who shall lay anything to
[47:53] the charge of God's elect is a God that
[47:56] justifies declares us righteous who is
[47:59] he that condemneth and there it is his
[48:01] death gave us the blood the blood has
[48:04] loosed us there was now no condemnation
[48:07] how can it be there was nothing to be
[48:10] condemned for because the blood has
[48:12] loosed us we are free we're Guiltless
[48:15] don't listen to the man listen to the
[48:17] word you were loosed by the blood and I
[48:20] say Amen to that we're not listening to
[48:22] a man we're listening to the word that
[48:25] has said we are loosed by the blood and
[48:28] I don't I I don't know any of you this
[48:29] morning maybe you've got marital
[48:31] problems or or addictions or or failures
[48:34] you're are loosed by the blood don't
[48:36] listen to condemnation don't listen to
[48:38] failures don't listen to past mistakes
[48:41] there is something that is brought a
[48:43] brought a separation a remission from
[48:46] the very desire of sin oh my and I like
[48:50] how we how he puts that don't listen to
[48:52] the man listen to the word you were
[48:55] loosed thank you brother you were loosed
[48:57] by the blood and so the blood a perfect
[49:00] blood would give us a perfect loosening
[49:02] and so now I'm no longer known by my own
[49:04] nature but a new man that's taking place
[49:07] on the inside something that's taken
[49:09] place and I like how brother Brandon
[49:11] would put it he would say I'll never be
[49:13] perfect in your sight and you'll never
[49:15] be perfect in my sight but what about
[49:18] God's sight and that really done
[49:19] something for me because if you ever get
[49:21] the revelation of that you'll look at
[49:23] each other in a different way you won't
[49:25] be looking at the mistakes you be
[49:26] looking up the problems you won't be
[49:28] looking up the failures cuz all of us
[49:30] have mistakes all of us have failures
[49:33] but what is God looking at God ain't
[49:35] looking at your mistakes God ain't
[49:37] looking at your failures he looks at
[49:38] your representation the blood of Jesus
[49:42] Oh Hallelujah and brother brandom he
[49:45] would preach multiple messages called
[49:46] the token and he would say that God he
[49:49] would he would uh show his longsuffering
[49:51] and kindness to pharaoh and all of his
[49:54] people he would send them a prophet he
[49:56] would send them signs he and behind
[49:58] those signs was a message and he says he
[50:01] sent the pillar of fire and he says the
[50:03] message was let my people go right let
[50:06] my people go and now Pharaoh would not
[50:08] listen to the message that God had given
[50:11] him so now brother Brandon would say
[50:13] that now God is making a
[50:15] separation he says God got fed up with
[50:18] him because they were not listening to
[50:20] the message that he had sent them so now
[50:22] we know the Bible would tell us that the
[50:24] death angel was going to come through
[50:26] the land
[50:27] right and what was to separate the
[50:29] Israelites from the Judgment that was
[50:31] coming upon the land was the token right
[50:34] and the blood was to separate them from
[50:36] the Judgment that was coming upon the
[50:39] land and I don't believe that the
[50:41] Judgment was for the Israelites it was
[50:43] for the Egyptians right and I don't
[50:46] believe the judgments that are upon the
[50:48] Earth today is not for you it's for the
[50:51] world the Bible would tell us that we're
[50:53] living in the time where scripture is
[50:55] being fulfilled the Bible has told us
[50:57] that there were 200,000,000 demons that
[51:00] has been released out of the river
[51:02] Euphrates the Bible would tell us that
[51:04] there's going to be signs in the Suns
[51:06] there's going to be a distress of
[51:07] Nations men's hearts are failing them
[51:10] for fear these are plagues and judgments
[51:13] that are upon the Earth but I don't
[51:15] believe we have to be pled with fear
[51:17] we're living in the day of nervousness
[51:19] we're living in the day of fear but the
[51:21] Brandon would say the number one illness
[51:23] is fear it's nervousness it creat to
[51:26] depression and anxiety we're living in
[51:29] the day where that judgment is upon the
[51:32] Earth but it's not for you you don't
[51:34] pertain to the judgments that is for the
[51:37] earth that is for the world but what
[51:39] separates me brother Josh is there's a
[51:41] positive token there is something that
[51:44] can separate you from what is upon the
[51:46] Earth cuz we know the Bible would tell
[51:48] us that they were to slay the lamb there
[51:50] in Egypt they were to slay the lamb they
[51:52] would take the blood of that Lamb with
[51:54] hisp they would apply the blood and put
[51:56] it over the doorpost of their door right
[51:59] and then whenever the death angel would
[52:01] be striking he would come to that door
[52:04] and could not enter Because the token
[52:07] was applied and I say this is the time
[52:10] not to throw away the Holy Ghost this
[52:12] ain't the time to cancel the Holy Ghost
[52:14] this is the time to accept it for my
[52:17] family for my home for my church for my
[52:20] marriage whatever it is the death angel
[52:23] is striking the land it's not a natural
[52:25] death it's a spirit spiritual death
[52:27] right you can be sitting in a church the
[52:29] Bible would tell us that Jesus would say
[52:31] that there's the woman that is dead
[52:33] while she liveth where how's that
[52:35] possible she's alive naturally but she's
[52:38] dead spiritually and that that is the
[52:40] place today we're living in a Christian
[52:42] Nation you know I'm from Oklahoma
[52:44] they're in the Bible Belt we got
[52:45] churches on every corner you know
[52:48] everybody's Christians but where is the
[52:50] life they're dead why they live it's
[52:53] judgment that is upon the Earth but
[52:55] there is a Life by the baptism of the
[52:58] Holy Ghost that is separating you from
[53:01] the spiritual death that has overtaken
[53:03] the land today oh Hallelujah but you
[53:06] would notice that they were to apply the
[53:08] blood with hisp and brother Brandon
[53:10] would tell us that hisp wasn't anything
[53:13] special it was just a common weed that
[53:15] was among Palestine right and it was
[53:18] something so common that I'm sure phoh
[53:20] would have overlooked him could you
[53:22] imagine being Pharaoh sitting there and
[53:25] hearing seeing the Jud judgement coming
[53:27] through the land and he knew the
[53:28] Judgment was coming the messenger told
[53:30] him that the the death angel was going
[53:33] to strike the firstborn you know and
[53:35] here he was sitting maybe he would see
[53:37] the neighbor son die or maybe he would
[53:39] look across and had a had a his sister
[53:42] or or brother maybe they had a family
[53:44] member died and he is wishing and maybe
[53:46] his mind is thinking and turning how can
[53:48] I escape the Judgment that is coming
[53:51] through the land but it at the same time
[53:54] that this was taking place over in Goan
[53:57] there was a separation that was taking
[54:00] place Pharaoh did not have the secret
[54:04] ingredient it was the common Faith
[54:06] inside of the token because brother
[54:08] Brandon would tell us that hisp is the
[54:10] type of common Faith something so simple
[54:14] that it is overlooked but that the the
[54:17] common Faith applying the token is
[54:19] separating you from the Judgment that is
[54:22] upon the earth oh man we're living in a
[54:25] in a society where it's all out chaos
[54:28] right it's so chaotic nowadays and
[54:30] they're thinking maybe a new president
[54:32] will help maybe more money will help
[54:34] maybe maybe a new politician will help
[54:37] maybe this here is going to help and
[54:39] they fa to realize the right among them
[54:42] is the common faith that has been
[54:44] restored or what did Malachi 4 and5 say
[54:47] I'm going to send you Malachi the
[54:49] Prophet Elijah the prophet that is going
[54:51] to turn your faith by your hearts back
[54:53] to the fathers right it's something that
[54:55] has taken back to the original that is
[54:58] going to produce the same life oh
[55:01] Hallelujah in the midst of death in the
[55:04] midst of chaos there is a life inside of
[55:07] this token Oh Glory to God it's the
[55:10] world is looking for something big to
[55:12] bring certainty but right among them is
[55:14] something so common oh Hallelujah that's
[55:17] why we don't look the politicians for
[55:19] certainty oh come on we don't look for a
[55:22] big bank account to bring certainty we
[55:24] don't look for a new house to bring
[55:26] certainty we don't look for a new car to
[55:28] bring certainty or a girlfriend or a
[55:30] boyfriend but we look to one thing that
[55:33] is what the blood has purchased you know
[55:35] the blood has purchased your sound of
[55:37] Mind where you don't got to live in
[55:40] anxiety the Devil comes and Whispers
[55:42] that you got to be got to be anxious you
[55:45] got to be nervous but that's a curse
[55:47] that the devil has put upon the human
[55:50] race but the blood has purchased a sound
[55:53] of Mind where you don't got to live in a
[55:55] nervous condition
[55:56] there's a token that can separate you
[55:59] from the Judgment that is upon the earth
[56:02] oh Hallelujah but you see the token is
[56:05] is the evidence of what has already been
[56:08] purchased right how many's ever flown
[56:10] before you know and you and the first
[56:12] thing you do is you make sure your
[56:13] ticket is purchased right then you go
[56:16] and you go to the counter but you don't
[56:18] give them your money at the airport you
[56:20] say I need the token right I need the
[56:22] ticket you can't buy the token at the
[56:25] counter the token has got to be
[56:27] purchased for way ahead of time the only
[56:30] thing that takes place at the airport is
[56:32] you got to apply what the money is
[56:35] already paid for oh Hallelujah so when
[56:38] you get to the airport you don't go to
[56:40] security you don't go check in your back
[56:42] first you don't go to your gate you're
[56:44] not eligible for any of those things yet
[56:47] until you apply yourself with the token
[56:50] then once you get in and you know I I
[56:52] just got back from chech Republic about
[56:54] a month or so ago and so when whenever I
[56:56] got to the airport I told them my
[56:58] confirmation number I told them where I
[57:00] was going my my stops you know and then
[57:02] they would identify me with my schedule
[57:06] that was going to take place then once I
[57:08] was identified with the schedule then I
[57:11] could check in my bag then I could go
[57:13] through security I could find my gate it
[57:16] didn't matter the hiccups I was checked
[57:18] in with what my money had already
[57:20] purchased and oh my the Supernatural is
[57:23] not eligible to you until you identified
[57:27] with what the blood has paid for oh
[57:29] Hallelujah that's why we don't got to
[57:31] live in a nervousness a nervousness
[57:34] because if you got the Holy Ghost your
[57:36] sound of mind has already been paid for
[57:38] and the Holy Ghost identifies you with
[57:41] what was already paid for oh Hallelujah
[57:44] no brother brother Brandon would talk
[57:46] about uh he would talk about if I was
[57:48] hungry and somebody noticed if I was
[57:50] hungry and he they would come up and say
[57:52] what do you need brother Brandon he says
[57:54] well I need five cents and I can go get
[57:57] me some bread he says if somebody gave
[57:59] me 5 cents he says now I can Rejoice all
[58:03] the more now because I've got the
[58:05] purchase of that bread I might not have
[58:08] it yet but I've got the purchasing power
[58:10] so now I can Rejoice cuz all I got to do
[58:13] is go claim what the 5 cents is already
[58:16] paid for oh Hallelujah that's why you
[58:19] can rejoice in the midst of the trial in
[58:21] the midst of the circumstance in the
[58:23] midst of the negativity there's a token
[58:26] that has identified you you might not
[58:28] see the results yet but the results is
[58:30] right around the corner you remember
[58:32] Daniel he would pray for three weeks
[58:34] trying to get an answer from God but he
[58:37] kept on persisting he kept on fighting
[58:39] he kept on pressing and this ain't the
[58:41] time to give up this ain't the time to
[58:43] lay down this is the time to press this
[58:46] is the time to fight this is the time to
[58:48] take up the word of God and say by your
[58:50] stripes I'm Healed I claim my my my
[58:53] sound mind I claim my children I claim
[58:56] my marriage whatever it is I claim it
[58:59] cuz what happened after Daniel pressed
[59:01] for 21 days then the angel of the Lord
[59:04] come down it says I was coming the first
[59:06] day but the prince of the power of the
[59:08] air withstood me but I had to fight
[59:10] through it oh Hallelujah maybe your
[59:13] Miracle is right around the corner but
[59:15] you got to press for it oh come on now
[59:18] maybe your answer is right around the
[59:20] corner but you've got to press for it
[59:23] you know on the other side of the press
[59:24] is always the victory you remember uh it
[59:27] was uh it was the man that had the the
[59:30] the infirmity in his body that he was
[59:32] laying in his bed and it was the four
[59:34] friends they would pick him up you
[59:36] remember pick up his bed they knew where
[59:38] Jesus was and they would pick up his bed
[59:40] and they would get to the house but the
[59:42] Bible says they couldn't get into the
[59:44] house because of the press the pressure
[59:47] was too great but they didn't give up
[59:49] you know what they done y'all know what
[59:52] he what what those four friends done
[59:53] they climbed onto the roof God give us
[59:56] some friends like that that ain't
[59:58] willing to lay down ain't willing if you
[1:00:00] see somebody that's discouraged I'm
[1:00:02] willing to fight for you the Bible says
[1:00:04] they climbed on top of the roof and they
[1:00:06] started to take the shingles apart
[1:00:08] youall remember the story they took the
[1:00:10] shingles apart and they lifted him down
[1:00:12] they lowered him down to the presence of
[1:00:14] Jesus what if they would have given up
[1:00:17] in the pressure they wouldn't have seen
[1:00:19] the miracle and if you give up in the
[1:00:21] pressure you won't see the miracle but
[1:00:24] on the other side of the press on the
[1:00:26] other side of the fight is the miracle
[1:00:29] that is coming down your road oh the
[1:00:31] Bible would tell us of the the woman
[1:00:33] with woman with the blood issue you
[1:00:35] remember that that story the Bible says
[1:00:38] that she spent all of her money on
[1:00:40] Physicians and nobody could help her but
[1:00:42] she knew Jesus was coming by a way and
[1:00:45] the Bible says she couldn't get the
[1:00:47] Jesus because of the press the Press was
[1:00:50] too great but she knew this was her
[1:00:53] Miracle this was the Supernatural and if
[1:00:55] she could just fight through the
[1:00:57] pressure then she could see the results
[1:00:59] in the Bible where the brand would tell
[1:01:00] us maybe she had to Elbow her way around
[1:01:02] maybe she had to crawl up to the ground
[1:01:04] and the Bible says all she could touch
[1:01:07] was the Hemm of His Garment but she was
[1:01:09] willing to press for it cuz she knew
[1:01:12] that was her Miracle oh and little
[1:01:14] church your Miracle is not a Million
[1:01:16] Miles Away Your Miracle your Revival
[1:01:19] whatever it is is right here among us
[1:01:22] maybe you got to fight for it maybe you
[1:01:24] got to press for it maybe you got got to
[1:01:26] lay some things down some bitterness
[1:01:28] some gossip maybe you got to throw some
[1:01:30] things out in order to see the Revival
[1:01:33] oh hallelujah it's right here Among Us
[1:01:37] oh my but the Supernatural is identified
[1:01:40] whenever the token is apply oh my so the
[1:01:43] the token applies what the Holy Ghost
[1:01:46] had what the per what the what the blood
[1:01:48] has already purchased us but the Brandon
[1:01:50] would say there you are the blood the
[1:01:52] blood the blood not the blood chemistry
[1:01:55] but the to
[1:01:56] the Holy Ghost the life of the blood
[1:01:58] that comes what does that life do it
[1:02:01] comes and confirms what the token has
[1:02:03] been purchased for the token what the
[1:02:06] blood bought for you he says the the
[1:02:09] blood purchased your Redemption but the
[1:02:11] token is the evidence of it Oh The Blood
[1:02:15] purchased your Redemption but the token
[1:02:17] is the evidence of it and he says the
[1:02:19] blood he was wounded for our
[1:02:20] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:02:22] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:02:25] was upon on him with their stripes we
[1:02:27] were healed see or blood blood blood
[1:02:30] then when the token comes it shows that
[1:02:33] what you've been identified with that
[1:02:35] sacrifice and the devil can't keep you
[1:02:38] from it oh that's a revelation that we
[1:02:40] can grab a hold of once the token is
[1:02:42] applied it it identifies you with what
[1:02:46] the blood has purchased and it's the
[1:02:48] evidence and the devil can't keep you
[1:02:50] from it oh and I say devil get out of my
[1:02:53] way I'm marching on you remember the
[1:02:55] story by the brandom tells about the
[1:02:57] king like got the messenger and says
[1:02:59] here I'm giving you a message but I'm
[1:03:00] going to give you my scepter and the
[1:03:02] scepter if anybody gets in your way show
[1:03:05] them the scepter and say you got the
[1:03:08] king's message get out of the way and
[1:03:10] brother brandom says this at the end of
[1:03:12] that story he says Satan get out of my
[1:03:14] way I've got the king's message and I
[1:03:17] say Satan we've got the king's message
[1:03:19] we don't just got a message we've got
[1:03:21] the scepter we've got the token of the
[1:03:23] Holy Ghost that identifies what the
[1:03:26] scepter is purchasing us oh I say devil
[1:03:29] get out of the way Gloom get out of the
[1:03:31] way we're living in an atmosphere of
[1:03:33] Gloom it's easy to get depressed it's
[1:03:36] easy to get in the Blues as brother
[1:03:37] Brandon would say but we're living in a
[1:03:40] time where the blood has purchased
[1:03:41] something that we can acquire that we
[1:03:44] can grab a hold of and say Satan get out
[1:03:46] of our way oh
[1:03:49] Hallelujah and brother Brandon would
[1:03:51] tell us there's a difference between the
[1:03:53] blood and the life there's a difference
[1:03:55] CU you can have the blood chemical and
[1:03:57] fail to get the life right so brother
[1:03:59] brandom says there's a difference under
[1:04:01] this Covenant there's a difference
[1:04:02] between the blood and the life he was
[1:04:04] saying how in Egypt they had to have the
[1:04:07] chemical blood because the the the the
[1:04:09] lamb didn't have a soul on it remember
[1:04:11] him talking about that he says the lamb
[1:04:13] didn't have a soul and so the life C
[1:04:15] that lamb couldn't come on them to make
[1:04:17] them perfect so they needed a sybol they
[1:04:20] had to take the blood and that was
[1:04:22] symbolizing that something had taken
[1:04:24] their judgment you know but but the
[1:04:25] brandom says but that's not the case we
[1:04:28] there's a difference between the blood
[1:04:29] and the life we don't need the chemical
[1:04:32] blood but we need the life of the blood
[1:04:34] and I like up with the brown and a put
[1:04:35] it he would say the Bible would tell us
[1:04:37] there when Mary asked how can this be I
[1:04:39] know not a man and the Bible would say
[1:04:41] the angel told her that the Holy Ghost
[1:04:44] is going to overshadow you and we know
[1:04:46] what happened the Holy Ghost would
[1:04:47] overshadow her and would create a blood
[1:04:49] cell right would create something the
[1:04:52] life of it inside of her womb and we
[1:04:54] would know them brother Brandon would
[1:04:55] tell tell us that that little blood cell
[1:04:57] would create another cell create another
[1:04:59] cell create another cell until Jesus was
[1:05:02] then made born he would come alive and
[1:05:04] then he would come forth and brother
[1:05:06] Brandon would tell us that whenever he
[1:05:08] was upon the cross he says whenever his
[1:05:10] blood was spilled the chemical blood
[1:05:13] went into the elements of the ground and
[1:05:15] it went back to the elements but the
[1:05:18] life of it the Creator the blood cell
[1:05:20] come back to the church oh Hallelujah
[1:05:23] that is what is separating us is not a
[1:05:26] chemical blood but the life of the blood
[1:05:29] that is what is separating us oh and I
[1:05:32] like how brother Brandon would say it he
[1:05:33] says every believer can be wrapped in
[1:05:36] the blood cell with him he he says and
[1:05:38] the church is wrapped into the blood
[1:05:40] cell of the life of Jesus Christ not
[1:05:44] just the blood cell but the blood cell
[1:05:46] of the life so the very life that
[1:05:48] created the blood cell that is what you
[1:05:50] are wrapped in you know if you are
[1:05:52] wrapped by something you for in order
[1:05:55] for somebody to get to you they got to
[1:05:57] go through the wrapping right so before
[1:06:00] if you're wrapped in the life of the
[1:06:02] blood cell before the enemy can get to
[1:06:04] you he's got to go through the blood oh
[1:06:07] come on now and he can't get through the
[1:06:09] blood because there's a separation
[1:06:12] remember the Death Angel and the Bible
[1:06:13] would tell us in Exodus that the Bible
[1:06:15] the uh the Lord was speaking to Moses
[1:06:18] and would say when the Destroyer comes
[1:06:20] if the blood is applied he cannot come
[1:06:22] into your house there was a separation
[1:06:25] cuz he couldn't get through the blood oh
[1:06:28] and the devil can come and torment you
[1:06:30] but he can't get to your soul oh he can
[1:06:33] get to your flesh he can get to your
[1:06:34] spirit man but he can't get to the soul
[1:06:37] that is anchored wrapped by the life of
[1:06:39] the blood oh Hallelujah you know brother
[1:06:43] Brandon would tell us that he says the
[1:06:45] devil don't make us do anything because
[1:06:47] in order for him to get inside of you
[1:06:49] he's got to he's got to repent be
[1:06:51] baptized and receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:53] then he's your brother oh Hallelujah so
[1:06:55] if you're wrapped in the life of the
[1:06:57] blood that means the devil can't get to
[1:07:00] you he can tempt you he can torment your
[1:07:03] mind but there's nothing he can do to
[1:07:05] turn you around oh what a glorious thing
[1:07:08] if we're wrapped he can't get to us you
[1:07:10] know you know speaking on flying you I I
[1:07:13] always get nervous going through
[1:07:14] security I don't know why I don't know
[1:07:16] if anybody else ever feels that if you
[1:07:18] flown every time I go to security I get
[1:07:20] nervous and I've I've even got that
[1:07:22] pre-check thing where I don't I don't
[1:07:24] even take off my shoes I don't take my
[1:07:26] belt off I don't take my computer out I
[1:07:29] all I got to do is walk straight through
[1:07:30] the scanner you know and I still get
[1:07:32] nervous it's because I think that
[1:07:35] they're going to turn me around but they
[1:07:37] can't because I've got the token oh we
[1:07:40] get nervous of the enemy of the devil of
[1:07:42] spirits cuz we think that he can turn us
[1:07:44] around but he can't turn you around if
[1:07:47] you've got the token oh but you know
[1:07:49] there are some things that security can
[1:07:51] do you know many times I I I've lost my
[1:07:54] back too many times and so I I do
[1:07:56] carry-on bags if it's somewhere local
[1:07:58] you know I do carry-on bags and
[1:08:00] sometimes I forget about my shampoo how
[1:08:02] many's ever done that you can't take the
[1:08:04] big shampoo on on the plane with you you
[1:08:07] know and so sometimes my bag is going to
[1:08:08] be going through I've already went
[1:08:10] through it I'm sitting there waiting on
[1:08:11] my bag and it's always it's depressing
[1:08:13] watching your bag it comes through the
[1:08:15] scanner and then it stops and it shoots
[1:08:17] over and you're like oh man now here's a
[1:08:20] hiccup you know they can't turn me
[1:08:22] around I've already come through but
[1:08:24] there are some things they can do they
[1:08:26] always say Okay whose bag is this it's
[1:08:28] my bag all right come over here you know
[1:08:30] the scanner is picking something up is
[1:08:32] it okay if I open it yeah you can open
[1:08:34] it they open it up oh look here's this
[1:08:36] bottle of shampoo is way too big what do
[1:08:39] you want us to do with it I'm like well
[1:08:42] do you want to take it back to your car
[1:08:43] do you want us to throw it away I said I
[1:08:45] ain't going back to my car I've come too
[1:08:47] far oh so in other words I can either
[1:08:51] return with it or they can just throw it
[1:08:53] away they can't turn me around but they
[1:08:56] can throw some things out that I am
[1:08:58] carrying on oh man the devil can't turn
[1:09:01] you around but he's just a tool in God's
[1:09:04] hand that is tripping some things off of
[1:09:06] you that he don't want on you oh
[1:09:08] bitterness ain't going to make a Rapture
[1:09:10] gossip ain't going to make a Rapture
[1:09:12] lust ain't going to make a Rapture so
[1:09:14] the devil can't turn you around but he
[1:09:16] can chip some things off of you and I
[1:09:18] say we've come too far to turn around
[1:09:21] we've come too far to let bitterness
[1:09:24] turn us around and go back we've come
[1:09:26] too far to let depression turn us around
[1:09:29] and take us back but I say it's time to
[1:09:32] go forward oh man I've got a plane in
[1:09:34] mind I've got my plane number my flight
[1:09:37] number my gate and I ain't going back
[1:09:39] I've got my destination in mind and I
[1:09:41] said just throw it away let me get on my
[1:09:44] plane throw it away and I say Lord throw
[1:09:46] some things away I had missing my plane

[1:11:01] expecting you to make the Rapture oh I'm
[1:11:03] preaching now but this ain't the time to

[1:12:12] every remodel a house that you're living
[1:12:14] in that was the worst mistake that I
[1:12:17] have ever made in my life so anyways I'm
[1:12:19] remodeling my house you know I I did an
[1:12:22] addition this was how bad this
[1:12:24] remodeling was you can walk in our
[1:12:26] kitchen and see the stars we took the
[1:12:29] whole roof off our kitchen we're
[1:12:30] expanding our kitchen you know and so
[1:12:33] anyways we're finally getting done with
[1:12:34] it we're getting close we're putting the
[1:12:36] tile down and I I don't know if
[1:12:38] anybody's ever done tile you put the
[1:12:40] tile down you know then you start to
[1:12:41] grout it and you put the grout upon it
[1:12:44] and what you have to do is when you put
[1:12:46] the grout on you go with a few square
[1:12:48] feet and then you got a sponge and a
[1:12:50] bucket of water then you go when you
[1:12:52] wipe up you wrap the tile down and it
[1:12:54] picks up the access ground okay and so
[1:12:57] then I I did I was going to town you I
[1:12:59] have my bucket of water I had two
[1:13:00] sponges I'm going at it you know and I
[1:13:03] get done I looked and the floor's still
[1:13:05] dirty and I thought oh my goodness I got
[1:13:08] it again I went and cleaned it all up I
[1:13:10] got back the floor still dirty and I was
[1:13:12] getting mad at my sponges I was ringing
[1:13:14] them out I was squeezing them out I
[1:13:16] would go and wipe it down again and I
[1:13:19] thought what is going on then I thought
[1:13:21] hit me the water's dirty it ain't the
[1:13:24] sponges fault it's the environment that
[1:13:27] I'm putting those sponges in come on
[1:13:29] parents children are sponges people are
[1:13:32] sponges and Revival happens at home you
[1:13:35] can pick up your children and put it in
[1:13:37] in an environment of Gossip in an
[1:13:39] environment of bitterness that's what
[1:13:41] they're going to soak up so when they
[1:13:43] come to church that's what they push out
[1:13:45] I couldn't be mad that my floor was
[1:13:47] dirty I was the one putting it in the
[1:13:49] environment so you know what I had to do
[1:13:51] I dump that environment out oh I'm
[1:13:54] preaching now I dumped it out got some
[1:13:56] more water but you notice it took more
[1:13:58] than just one dumping a Revival is a
[1:14:01] multiple cleansing you can throw one
[1:14:03] thing out maybe there's more things in
[1:14:04] the closet you can throw that thing out
[1:14:06] maybe there's more thing in your heart
[1:14:08] you can throw that out maybe there's
[1:14:09] something else so the floor didn't get
[1:14:11] clean after just one refilling but I had
[1:14:14] to dump the water out I'll go clean then
[1:14:17] I'll dump the water out some more then
[1:14:18] I'll go and clean some more I'll dump
[1:14:20] the water out again so it's a process a
[1:14:23] Revival don't happen overnight but it's
[1:14:25] saying Lord show me your way if I got to
[1:14:28] throw some things out I'm going to throw
[1:14:30] it out I want a
[1:14:33] separation I want a separation I'm
[1:14:36] living in the Earth but the Abraham
[1:14:38] would say I'm walking through this I'm
[1:14:39] just I'm just a Sojourner I don't this
[1:14:41] ain't my home I'm looking for a place
[1:14:44] whose Builder and maker is God I'm I'm
[1:14:46] I'm living here but I'm not a part of it
[1:14:49] we're not a part the Bible would say
[1:14:51] we're a royal priesthood A peculiar
[1:14:54] Nation a chosen people the word peculiar
[1:14:57] is strange we're not meant to fit in hey
[1:15:00] come on I know what that's what peer
[1:15:02] pressure is peer pressure want you to
[1:15:04] fit in peer pressure want you to belong
[1:15:07] but as you're trying to belong you're
[1:15:08] throwing away your morals you're
[1:15:10] throwing away you're throwing away your
[1:15:12] convictions you know no back home we're
[1:15:14] we're there in Oklahoma in the west you
[1:15:16] know the wild west and so we still got
[1:15:18] horses that come through town and things
[1:15:20] you know people ride for fun and we've
[1:15:22] got a we got rodeos that take place I
[1:15:24] don't know there's any rodeos up here
[1:15:26] and on but there's rodeos that in our
[1:15:28] town and it's always funny because
[1:15:31] everybody's a cowboy at rodo time right
[1:15:34] every the guy that normally wear shorts
[1:15:37] that has his flipflops now he's got his
[1:15:39] boot cut jeans on he's got his his boots
[1:15:42] on he got his cowboy hat and boy howdy
[1:15:44] now he's a cowboy but inside he's a city
[1:15:47] slicker so what he done he he threw his
[1:15:50] identity away to fit in with the
[1:15:53] identity that he is coping with oh and
[1:15:56] that's what peer pressure does as a Son
[1:15:58] of God God places an identity on the
[1:16:01] inside that belongs to him but when you
[1:16:03] go to school you go to work you start to
[1:16:06] you try to cope with the identity and so
[1:16:08] you're throwing away morals you throw
[1:16:10] away convictions and you're just like
[1:16:12] the city slicker throwing off your
[1:16:14] flipflops you know taking off your
[1:16:16] shorts and putting on your boot cut
[1:16:18] jeans there's nothing inside of him that
[1:16:20] is a cowboy and let me say young boys
[1:16:23] you can run you can try see in but if
[1:16:25] you're a Son of God you can try to run
[1:16:28] but there's always a part of God on the
[1:16:30] inside that you can't do away with the
[1:16:33] devil might throw Addictions on them the
[1:16:35] devil might throw Temptations on them
[1:16:37] but if you're a Son of God God's got you
[1:16:39] and I see that's for anybody in here you
[1:16:42] may try to run and hide but if go if
[1:16:44] you're a part of the Jin seed of God God
[1:16:46] is always going to have you oh
[1:16:49] Hallelujah and so what happens after the
[1:16:51] rodeo they go back to the shorts they go
[1:16:54] back to the flip flops and oh man if you
[1:16:57] you can try to run but if you're a jean
[1:16:59] seed of God the soul the seed on the
[1:17:02] inside is going to Blossom it may take
[1:17:04] time it may take scars it may take some
[1:17:07] circumstances you know but God's going
[1:17:10] to get you amen so it's the token that
[1:17:13] connects you with the purchase of the
[1:17:15] blood brother brandom says listen close
[1:17:17] while I make these closing remarks if
[1:17:20] Satan tries to hand you some of this
[1:17:22] stuff like sickness you know what to do
[1:17:24] just show him the token I'm a purchased
[1:17:27] product my healing has been paid for I'm
[1:17:30] a product of God because I have the
[1:17:32] token of the Holy Ghost you cannot keep
[1:17:36] me off of this highway you cannot keep
[1:17:38] me from my health I present the token
[1:17:41] and show you that by his stripes I was
[1:17:44] healed here is the resurrection of Jesus
[1:17:46] Christ right in me now to prove it to
[1:17:49] you oh there is a real thing there is
[1:17:53] the token ain't that powerful here in me
[1:17:56] now is the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:17:59] in me now you remember Elisha the Bible
[1:18:02] would tell us of when Elijah he got on
[1:18:04] the Chariot of fire and his mantel fell
[1:18:06] down girl remember that remember that in
[1:18:08] the Bible and and Elisha would pick up
[1:18:10] the Manel and would say where is the god
[1:18:12] of Elijah right and the same signs
[1:18:14] remember because it was Elijah that
[1:18:16] would split the Jordan River then Elisha
[1:18:18] now was doing the same things and so the
[1:18:21] same Authority that Elijah would had now
[1:18:23] Elisha has and now the Bible would tell
[1:18:26] us that it was years later Elisha was
[1:18:28] dead and his bones were in a cave youall
[1:18:30] remember that story and there was a
[1:18:31] battle that was taking place and there
[1:18:33] was a somebody that had died in the
[1:18:35] Battle and then there was two comrades
[1:18:37] they were picking him up y remember and
[1:18:39] were taking him back to their back to
[1:18:41] their lines I think and they and the
[1:18:43] enemy was coming so they picked up the
[1:18:45] dead body and just threw them in the
[1:18:47] cave yall remember that and as soon as
[1:18:49] the body got in the cave it had touched
[1:18:52] the bones of Elijah of Elisha and he
[1:18:54] came back to life and come running out
[1:18:56] could you imagine being those two guys
[1:18:59] that throws him in there he's dead they
[1:19:02] watched him die and they turn around and
[1:19:04] here he comes running out I would be
[1:19:05] running with them say there's no way and
[1:19:08] you know sometimes we see people that
[1:19:10] you seems like a hopeless case oh
[1:19:12] they're too bitter they're too this
[1:19:14] they're too that don't give up on them
[1:19:16] let them touch the bones of the
[1:19:17] quickening power oh what it was was
[1:19:20] inside and I like it brother the brown I
[1:19:22] put it he says death can't even kill the
[1:19:24] quick in power Elisha was dead but the
[1:19:27] quickening power was there to raise him
[1:19:30] back up after Resurrection oh if you've
[1:19:32] got the quickening power you may go to
[1:19:34] the way of the grave but that quickening
[1:19:36] power the token will rise you back up on
[1:19:39] Resurrection morning oh this ain't the
[1:19:41] time to lay down and give up there's a
[1:19:43] promise because of a
[1:19:46] token oh there is a real thing there is
[1:19:50] a real thing and I like brother Brandon
[1:19:52] how he puts that there is a real thing
[1:19:54] there is is a real Holy Ghost it's not
[1:19:56] just Sensations it's not just emotions
[1:19:59] it's not just speaking in tongues I've
[1:20:00] never spoken tongues before that that
[1:20:02] mean I don't have the token come on now
[1:20:05] too many of us try to try to you know we
[1:20:08] got to do this we got to do that and
[1:20:10] what you're doing is you organized in
[1:20:11] the Holy Ghost oh you may never dance
[1:20:14] you may never speak in tongues but if
[1:20:16] the nature of God's on the inside you
[1:20:18] might not can point back to speaking in
[1:20:20] tongues but if your life has changed
[1:20:23] that is something you can point back
[1:20:25] hallah oh Hallelujah but how come it's
[1:20:29] in the evening time that the that the
[1:20:31] Holy Ghost has come under Fire you know
[1:20:34] that we can't the Holy Ghost ain't for
[1:20:35] us today it's because that we've had a
[1:20:38] message in this generation that has
[1:20:39] opened up the book right that has loosen
[1:20:42] the seals and under the seals was your
[1:20:45] inheritance it was your Redemptive
[1:20:46] rights and it's the holy ghost that
[1:20:48] identifies you with what the book says
[1:20:51] you know the Bible would tell us that uh
[1:20:53] the blood of Abel would speak out
[1:20:55] against Cain youall remember that
[1:20:57] whenever God would come and ask Cain
[1:20:59] where was your brother am I My Brother's
[1:21:01] Keeper you remember that and the Bible
[1:21:03] says the God spoke to Cain and says
[1:21:06] you're the the blood of Abel cries out
[1:21:09] against you it cries out against so he
[1:21:12] was speaking of condemnation but then
[1:21:14] the Apostle Paul would say the blood of
[1:21:17] Jesus speaks better things than that of
[1:21:20] Abel and so the blood of Abel spoke out
[1:21:23] against Cain but the blood of Jesus
[1:21:25] speaks for you it don't speak
[1:21:27] condemnation it speaks Grace and then
[1:21:30] brother Brandon would say this he says
[1:21:32] the New Testament the blood speaks
[1:21:34] better things the blood is speaking then
[1:21:37] the blood has got a voice and the voice
[1:21:39] of the blood is his word oh then he
[1:21:42] would saying in another place that's the
[1:21:44] life that's in you speaks from the shed
[1:21:46] blood Amen brother I wish everybody
[1:21:48] could see that if you can see what it is
[1:21:51] it's the life that's in you see the
[1:21:53] blood is identifying you with it so the
[1:21:57] life that is in you identifies you with
[1:22:00] what the blood speaks so if this message
[1:22:03] speaks of a Rapture the life that is in
[1:22:06] you identifies you with it oh Hallelujah
[1:22:09] me brother Brandon would say this word
[1:22:11] is like a jigsaw puzzle right he says
[1:22:13] you can't put the pieces together
[1:22:15] without the Holy Ghost the Bible would
[1:22:17] tell us that the Holy Ghost is a spirit
[1:22:19] of truth that will guide you into all
[1:22:23] truth right so without the spirit of
[1:22:25] Truth you can't be guided into all truth
[1:22:29] you can learn truth but you can't be
[1:22:30] guided you're going to get it all mixed
[1:22:32] up but the Brandon would say it's like
[1:22:34] having a he says you without the Holy
[1:22:36] Ghost you'll have a cow inside of the
[1:22:38] tree eating apples y remember that
[1:22:40] remember how you put that so in other
[1:22:42] words that's impossible for that to
[1:22:44] happen and that's what that's what
[1:22:46] happens without the Holy Ghost it's
[1:22:48] impossible to understand it but with the
[1:22:51] spirit of Truth when truth comes it
[1:22:54] ident if I with it and says yes that is
[1:22:56] mine it's speaking of me oh Hallelujah
[1:23:00] so whatever the blood speaks the token
[1:23:02] enforces and I like that brother Brandon
[1:23:04] would put he says in in a court he says
[1:23:07] whenever a court writes out a word the
[1:23:10] the penalty is such and such he says the
[1:23:12] law of the Court enforces the word of
[1:23:14] the Court oh it ain't the judge that is
[1:23:17] enforced and get it's the law of the
[1:23:19] court that enforces it and that's the
[1:23:21] way it is with the random says when God
[1:23:23] speaks something that is the law and the
[1:23:25] Holy Spirit here enforces the law
[1:23:28] regardless of the conditions regardless
[1:23:32] of the conditions if God's word says
[1:23:34] something the token inside enforces it
[1:23:38] oh that's why it's so important to have
[1:23:39] the Holy Ghost right it enforces what
[1:23:42] the blood says no matter the cond the
[1:23:45] condition and brother Brandon would say
[1:23:47] this who are you sickness who do you
[1:23:49] think you are Satan who do you claim to
[1:23:52] be every claim that you had was
[1:23:54] cancelled at Calvary you're a bluff you
[1:23:57] have no rights we defy you in the name
[1:23:59] of Jesus Christ as a holy ghost filled
[1:24:02] body who are you Satan who do you claim
[1:24:05] to be every claim was canceled at
[1:24:08] Calvary oh every claim you know so the
[1:24:11] devil had claims on you right like in
[1:24:13] the Old Testament it was the it was the
[1:24:15] claim of the devil that made them go
[1:24:17] around in cycles and sin and sin and sin
[1:24:19] and sin the sin had a claim on their
[1:24:22] life but when the blood of Christ come
[1:24:24] with remission it canceled the claim
[1:24:26] that was upon the life and here brother
[1:24:28] brandom says Satan who do you claim to
[1:24:30] be every claim was broken so the claim
[1:24:34] can be broken but unless you're unless
[1:24:36] that that the claim of God now is
[1:24:38] enforced by the Holy Ghost the claim can
[1:24:41] be broken but you will still live under
[1:24:44] that claim that's true come on now you
[1:24:46] know if you paid something you know if
[1:24:48] if I if I uh uh if I bought my ticket to
[1:24:51] go to Czech Republic but I never went
[1:24:53] there and I claimed ticket it's just
[1:24:55] going to lay there right even though
[1:24:57] it's purchased unless they identify with
[1:25:00] it it's going to lay there unused and
[1:25:03] the claims of the devil has been broken
[1:25:05] but unless you identify with what the
[1:25:08] blood paid for the claim is going to
[1:25:10] still lay there and you're going to act
[1:25:12] under the claim that has already been
[1:25:14] broken you remember brother brandom
[1:25:16] talks about the crow he says the crow
[1:25:18] somebody tied up the crow and drove
[1:25:20] steak into the ground youall remember
[1:25:22] that he says that Crow he would see the
[1:25:24] other the crows would start to fly over
[1:25:26] and they would say come on Johnny Crow
[1:25:28] come with us and he would go and he
[1:25:30] would start to fly but then the Rope
[1:25:32] would pull him back down y'all remember
[1:25:34] that said the next day the crows would
[1:25:36] take off he would try to go with them
[1:25:38] but the Rope would bring him back and
[1:25:40] this happened year after year after year
[1:25:42] and then there was finally a man that
[1:25:44] felt sorry for the crow he would come
[1:25:46] and he would cut that rope right and so
[1:25:49] now the crow was free but he was still
[1:25:51] walking in that cycle Oh Come on he was
[1:25:55] still walking in that cycle because he
[1:25:57] thought that still had a claim on him
[1:25:59] but even though something purchased the
[1:26:02] freedom from the claim and then there
[1:26:04] would go the crows you know they would
[1:26:05] say come on Johnny Crow and he would run
[1:26:08] he would stop because he was so used to
[1:26:10] being claimed and too many of us are so
[1:26:13] used to being claimed by nervousness
[1:26:16] that whenever something happens we get
[1:26:18] nervous but the claim has been broke we
[1:26:20] get so used to being claimed by
[1:26:22] Rebellion so used to being claimed by
[1:26:25] sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or
[1:26:27] whatever it is that whenever something
[1:26:30] pops up we just surrender to the claim
[1:26:32] but the claim has been broke there's no
[1:26:35] claim that the devil hasd on us under
[1:26:38] the token oh Hallelujah because the
[1:26:41] devil had claims on our marriages he had
[1:26:44] claims on our minds he had claims on our
[1:26:46] children you know brother the Brandon
[1:26:48] would talk about the abstract and the
[1:26:49] title deed he says if you have the tital
[1:26:52] deed that don't mean you have everything
[1:26:54] thing because there can be leans on the
[1:26:56] title deed you remember I'm talking
[1:26:58] about that but he says what you need is
[1:27:00] the abstract to the title deed and that
[1:27:03] clears every lean that is against you he
[1:27:06] says then once you have the abstract he
[1:27:08] says that gives you permission to give
[1:27:11] to get everything that the title deed
[1:27:14] declares and he says the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:16] the abstract that that that it cancels
[1:27:19] every claim that is against you and you
[1:27:21] know brother the Brandon would talk
[1:27:22] about the he would say this here and it
[1:27:24] put my name in The Book of Life but was
[1:27:27] born through a man and a woman and
[1:27:29] subject to sin and guilty of it but when
[1:27:32] I believed on it I received the deed but
[1:27:34] when the Holy Ghost came it was the
[1:27:37] abstract that everything against me
[1:27:39] whether my mother done it if my father
[1:27:41] done it if my grandmother done it like
[1:27:44] the little epileptic child I prayed for
[1:27:46] a few minutes ago that come from the
[1:27:48] grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon
[1:27:51] the child but when the ab ract came it
[1:27:55] struck it off admitted
[1:27:58] everything ain't that incredible the
[1:28:00] generational curses are a real thing yes
[1:28:03] it is come on now generation this this
[1:28:05] little girl got this EP epilepsy spirit
[1:28:08] because of grandparents and it was a it
[1:28:10] was a generational curse and
[1:28:13] generational curses can go through
[1:28:14] marriages well this one your your great
[1:28:17] your great grandpa struggled with his
[1:28:19] marriage your grandpa struggled with the
[1:28:21] marriage and you think your parents now
[1:28:22] you think you have to struggle with your
[1:28:24] your marriage it's a generational curse
[1:28:26] or maybe pornography was sent down from
[1:28:29] generation to generation to generation
[1:28:31] it's a claim that the devil has on you
[1:28:34] but brother brandom says but when the
[1:28:36] abstract come it didn't matter how
[1:28:38] strong the epilepsy was when the
[1:28:40] abstract come it struck it off it
[1:28:43] separated her it didn't matter how long
[1:28:46] that generational curse was in the
[1:28:48] family when the positive token come it
[1:28:51] separated her from that generation curse
[1:28:55] and I'm here to say there's a separation
[1:28:58] that has taken place oh man there's May
[1:29:01] been something high blood pressure may
[1:29:03] have went from your great-grandfather
[1:29:04] grandfather your father to you but
[1:29:06] there's a separation that can take place
[1:29:09] this morning let the abstract come and
[1:29:11] break every claim that the devil would
[1:29:13] put upon your life oh hallelujah it's
[1:29:17] claims that have already been broken
[1:29:19] your children are yours come on now your
[1:29:22] children are yours but the devil going
[1:29:24] to put claims on them but those claims
[1:29:26] are broke your Offspring is yours you
[1:29:28] know my my my dad would always speak
[1:29:30] over us you know and he would say when
[1:29:32] Even in our rebellious years God didn't
[1:29:34] give me Serpent seed God didn't my my
[1:29:38] children are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:41] my my brother would go out and he would
[1:29:42] get in the drugs he would get in the
[1:29:44] alcohol he would get into a gang he
[1:29:46] would go out with women but in the midst
[1:29:48] of it all dad would still say I don't
[1:29:50] got serpent seed it didn't matter how
[1:29:53] what the devil claim that he had the
[1:29:55] daddy knew that the claim was
[1:30:00] Broken Hallelujah the claim was broken
[1:30:03] but random would say this then when we
[1:30:05] pray we must have the token to present
[1:30:08] with our prayers as I said now believe
[1:30:11] for ourself and apply the token to the
[1:30:13] whole family like in Egypt Jericho or in
[1:30:16] Acts 16-31 we find out but Paul told the
[1:30:19] Roman Centurion believe thou when all
[1:30:21] thy house shall be saved and apply it to
[1:30:24] your family if you got an unsaved child
[1:30:27] lay the token right on top of him and
[1:30:30] say Lord God I claim him stay right
[1:30:33] there if you got a mother or a loved one
[1:30:35] that's lost lay the token on them and
[1:30:37] say Lord God I claim them and brother
[1:30:40] bandam is making a personal he ain't
[1:30:42] saying saying God you claim them he says
[1:30:44] you claim them come on now you claim
[1:30:47] them it don't matter what the devil
[1:30:49] claims to have with the abstract the
[1:30:52] claims are off amen praise God oh the
[1:30:56] the token speaks better things amen
[1:30:59] better things so it don't matter what
[1:31:02] the evidence is against you it speaks
[1:31:03] better things you know what and I love
[1:31:06] the story of Rahab you know Rahab would
[1:31:08] start to intercede for her family
[1:31:10] because the Bible would say in Joshua
[1:31:12] 2:12 now therefore I prayed you swear
[1:31:14] unto me by the Lord God since I have
[1:31:16] showed you kindness that you also show
[1:31:19] kindness unto my father's house and give
[1:31:22] me a true token yeah oh a true token but
[1:31:26] you notice that she was saying my
[1:31:28] father's house it was just yeah sa my
[1:31:30] family you know but then the next verse
[1:31:32] the 13th verse and that ye will save
[1:31:34] aive my father my mother my brethren my
[1:31:39] sisters all that they have and deliver
[1:31:42] our lives from Death now here is
[1:31:44] something this is somebody that was
[1:31:46] getting desperate not just my family but
[1:31:49] now I'm going to intercede I've got some
[1:31:50] names on my mind oh not just family but
[1:31:53] my mother my father my sister my
[1:31:56] brothers that's the way we should be
[1:31:58] when we intercede is I'm not just you
[1:32:00] know babbling words yeah help the church
[1:32:03] but I'm going to intercede help the
[1:32:05] pastor help the deacons help the song
[1:32:07] leaders it's under the true token oh and
[1:32:11] it was Rahab saying give me something
[1:32:13] true oh that should be the hearts The
[1:32:15] Cry of our hearts give us something true
[1:32:19] give me something true for my boys give
[1:32:20] me something true for my girls I want
[1:32:22] something true that will keep them in
[1:32:24] the hard times oh we're living in the
[1:32:26] day man where where it's pornography and
[1:32:28] drugs and alcohol and smoking that is
[1:32:31] taking over the land but give me
[1:32:33] something true that will keep them in
[1:32:35] the time of pressure and I believe we've
[1:32:37] got something true we've got a
[1:32:40] separation that can keep them in the
[1:32:42] hardest times oh why did Rahab want a
[1:32:45] true token cu the Bible would tell us a
[1:32:47] few verses before that in Joshua 2:9 and
[1:32:51] she said unto the men I know the Lord
[1:32:53] God the Lord ha given you the land and
[1:32:56] that your terror is Fallen upon us and
[1:32:58] that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:33:00] faint because of you for we have heard
[1:33:03] how the Lord God how the Lord dried up
[1:33:05] the the water of the Red Sea for you and
[1:33:08] when you came out of Egypt and what you
[1:33:10] did unto the two kings of the amorites
[1:33:13] that were on the other side of Jordan
[1:33:15] sihon and OG whom you utterly
[1:33:18] destroyed and as soon as we heard these
[1:33:21] things our hearts did melt neither did
[1:33:24] there remain any more courage in any man
[1:33:27] because of you for the Lord your God he
[1:33:30] is God in heaven above and Earth beneath
[1:33:34] then it was the very next verse give me
[1:33:37] a true token she knew what God can do we
[1:33:42] know what God can do we've seen we've
[1:33:45] heard testimonies the book of Acts we've
[1:33:47] heard testimonies help God deliver from
[1:33:49] the fiery furnace and out of the the
[1:33:52] Lion's Den and out of the the the the
[1:33:54] well you know we've heard of these
[1:33:55] stories here rank was saying we heard
[1:33:58] how your God split the Red Sea we heard
[1:34:01] how your God delivered you from the
[1:34:02] amalekites and destroyed the inhabitants
[1:34:05] give me a true token amen and save my
[1:34:09] family my brother my sister my mother my
[1:34:11] father and you notice what happened she
[1:34:14] should have been a statistic cuz the
[1:34:16] Judgment was coming upon the city what
[1:34:19] did the what did God tell Joshua March
[1:34:21] around the walls seven times amen or
[1:34:24] seven days and on the seventh day March
[1:34:25] seven times and then the walls are going
[1:34:28] to come down the Walls where was rahab's
[1:34:31] house on the wall so she should have
[1:34:35] been another statistic oh I'm feeling
[1:34:37] good this morning you should be another
[1:34:39] statistic that generational curse should
[1:34:42] Ru your life like the rest of your
[1:34:44] family you should be another statistic
[1:34:47] but there's a true
[1:34:48] token that has brought a separation it's
[1:34:51] something positive in the middle of the
[1:34:54] negative oh Hallelujah and there she was
[1:34:57] standing with the token in the window
[1:34:59] and you notice that that token May
[1:35:01] brought judgment on her right cuz could
[1:35:04] you imagine people walking by and saying
[1:35:05] what is that making fun of her scoffing
[1:35:08] but the very thing that brought judgment
[1:35:10] upon her saved her from the Judgment
[1:35:12] that was coming don't be ashamed of this
[1:35:14] word don't be ashamed of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:17] it is the thing that is going to save
[1:35:19] you from the Judgment oh Hallelujah so
[1:35:22] here the walls were Fallen here she was
[1:35:25] should should have been another
[1:35:26] statistic and here she would stand and
[1:35:28] say wow here I am I'm saved than you
[1:35:31] notice that it was The Messengers that
[1:35:33] would give her a promise right and it
[1:35:35] was the token that would that would
[1:35:38] bring to pass the words of the messenger
[1:35:40] am oh and it's the token that is
[1:35:42] bringing to pass the words of our
[1:35:44] messenger am come on now what the what
[1:35:47] the blood is speaking the token is
[1:35:49] bringing to pass oh Hallelujah give me a
[1:35:53] true token token amen give me a true
[1:35:55] token give me a few more minutes and and
[1:35:57] I'll bring this down to a
[1:35:58] close but we needed something to speak
[1:36:01] better things and this is where I got my
[1:36:03] title brother Brandon must say no there
[1:36:05] is no devil who can stand before it
[1:36:07] there is nothing that can stand before
[1:36:08] it because God has accepted it you hold
[1:36:10] the token in your hand that the price is
[1:36:13] paid oh it's a positive token it's a
[1:36:16] positive token but you know we're living
[1:36:18] in the middle of negativity right you
[1:36:21] can't even go down the road you know you
[1:36:22] go down the road hey how you doing some

[1:36:43] we're living in a negative world but
[1:36:45] there's something positive it's a
[1:36:47] positive token and brother Brandon and
[1:36:49] the rising of the sun he would say now
[1:36:51] the Sun at the rising of the Sun Well
[1:36:53] there was the time when the world was
[1:36:55] laying in utter Darkness without form
[1:36:57] and void it was all covered in water and
[1:36:59] was laying there in a dark dismal gloomy
[1:37:02] atmosphere gloomy and and the spirit of
[1:37:05] God moved upon the water and said let
[1:37:07] there be light and God had a reason to
[1:37:09] do that for down beneath the water there
[1:37:11] were seeds that he had planted and it
[1:37:14] had to have the sunlight to make it live
[1:37:17] and I really like that that there was
[1:37:18] seeds that God had already planted the
[1:37:20] sun didn't bring the seeds come on the
[1:37:23] Sun just brought the life what God
[1:37:24] already put there this message didn't
[1:37:26] make you a son and daughter of God it
[1:37:28] just brought to life what was already
[1:37:30] there but there was a gloomy atmosphere
[1:37:33] that was over the seed oh Hallelujah
[1:37:36] brother brandom said there had to be
[1:37:37] light and he continues on to say and the
[1:37:39] first light that was ever given upon the
[1:37:41] Earth was God's God spoken word and he
[1:37:44] says he said let there be light and
[1:37:45] there was light that turned Darkness
[1:37:47] into light in order to bring forth the
[1:37:50] creation of Joy oh I just whenever I
[1:37:53] read that that really spoke to me it was
[1:37:55] a gloomy atmosphere that was over the
[1:37:58] Earth but he had there had to be a light
[1:38:00] to bring forth the seed to take the
[1:38:03] creation or to turn the darkness the
[1:38:06] gloominess the depression into a
[1:38:08] creation of Joy oh we're not meant to be
[1:38:11] depressed all the time we're not to
[1:38:13] meant we're not meant to be in
[1:38:14] gloominess all the time we're not meant
[1:38:17] to be under a heavy load and heaviness
[1:38:19] where all we can see is this problem and
[1:38:21] that problem this word has brought us
[1:38:24] the creation of Joy where we can have a
[1:38:27] joy unspeakable full of Glory oh
[1:38:31] Hallelujah the reason for bringing light
[1:38:34] was cause under that gloomy atmosphere
[1:38:36] was siege to bring forth the creation of
[1:38:39] Joy oh your joy is still laying there
[1:38:42] your peace is still laying there maybe
[1:38:44] it's a gloomy atmosphere that is over
[1:38:46] your life over your home over the church
[1:38:48] I don't know but there's a creation of
[1:38:50] Joy this morning oh it is the rising of
[1:38:52] the Sun brother Brandon would preach the
[1:38:55] rising of the Sun and said whenever
[1:38:57] Jesus would come forth you know the
[1:38:58] Bible says it was at the rising of the
[1:39:00] Sun that the ladies were going to the
[1:39:02] going to the supper remember that
[1:39:04] scripture and he says it was a dual
[1:39:06] Sunrise it wasn't just the Su incoming
[1:39:09] gun but it was the S and coming out of
[1:39:11] the grave and oh man we're under another
[1:39:14] Resurrection he says what a resurrection
[1:39:16] that was what a resurrection this is the
[1:39:19] word that was in denominations has been
[1:39:22] lifted up again and what is th word
[1:39:24] doing pushing past the
[1:39:26] gloominess pushing past the the the
[1:39:29] gloominess in the atmosphere of doubt
[1:39:31] and unbelief to bring forth
[1:39:34] Joy
[1:39:35] Hallelujah you see it's the Troubles of
[1:39:38] life that can bring us down the Troubles
[1:39:40] of life when that those troubles can
[1:39:42] bring this atmosphere you know it was
[1:39:44] Martha the Bible would say here in Luke
[1:39:47] 10 and 41 Jesus answered and said unto
[1:39:49] her Martha Martha thou wart careful and
[1:39:52] troubled about many things so what did
[1:39:56] this troubless do here stood Jesus right
[1:39:59] God made flesh whatever Martha had need
[1:40:02] of all she had to do was ask amen right
[1:40:05] how many's ever have man if I could just
[1:40:07] get get in front of if I was only in
[1:40:09] Jesus day I know my brother would be
[1:40:11] healed or if I was only there I know I
[1:40:13] could be healed it's something that we
[1:40:14] have on our mind you know but here
[1:40:16] Martha was in front of Jesus but because
[1:40:19] of the troubles what did she do she
[1:40:22] missed her visitation yes did oh cuz
[1:40:25] because surely if she would have really
[1:40:27] realized she would have been like Jesus
[1:40:30] I need help Jesus I need healing or
[1:40:32] Jesus I need help with this situation I
[1:40:35] need peace I need Joy but because of the
[1:40:38] troubles and man I've been here before
[1:40:41] because of the troubles we sit in church
[1:40:43] and yeah that person needs
[1:40:45] it oh I know what they said last oh that
[1:40:47] one needs this oh hdden preacher it's
[1:40:50] because of the troubles you're missing
[1:40:52] your
[1:40:54] visitation I'm preaching now and that is
[1:40:56] the way Martha was here Martha stood in
[1:40:59] the presence of deity but because of the
[1:41:02] troubles you're troubled about many
[1:41:04] things she was saying yeah Martha Mary's
[1:41:06] this Mary's that Mary's doing that and
[1:41:09] here Jesus is saying Martha you're
[1:41:11] troubled but Mary's choosing the good
[1:41:15] thing the same troubles may have been
[1:41:17] troubling Mary it was troubling Mary
[1:41:19] could you imagine being being Mary she
[1:41:22] should have been back there helping and
[1:41:23] she should have been doing this she
[1:41:24] should have been doing that but she
[1:41:26] chose the right thing so I'm not missing
[1:41:28] my visitation but oh it can be a Sunday
[1:41:31] morning or a Wednesday night kind maybe
[1:41:33] it's an evangelist or the pastor getting
[1:41:35] up don't miss your visitation because of
[1:41:38] troubles don't allow troubles to bring
[1:41:41] bring gloominess that you miss out of
[1:41:43] the creation of
[1:41:45] Joy oh cuz troubless brings on evil
[1:41:49] thoughts the Bible would tell us in Luke
[1:41:50] 24:38 and he said unto them why are you
[1:41:53] you troubled and why do thoughts arise
[1:41:56] in your heart this is on the boat
[1:41:58] remember whenever the disciples was
[1:41:59] there upon the boat and the storm came
[1:42:02] up against them youall remember that and
[1:42:04] the Bible says they went up to Jesus and
[1:42:06] says Master do you care that we perish
[1:42:09] what happened their thoughts turned to
[1:42:11] the negative and now they're thinking
[1:42:13] Jesus was against them oh come on now so
[1:42:17] many times troubles can turn us around
[1:42:20] where we think the word's against us we
[1:42:22] think the pastor against us we thank the
[1:42:24] deacons against us we thank the
[1:42:26] evangelists against us why are you
[1:42:28] troubled and why do thoughts arise in
[1:42:31] your heart here Jesus stood up and said
[1:42:34] peace be still and what did the the
[1:42:36] disciples say what manner of man is this
[1:42:39] they should have known who he was but
[1:42:41] the troubles oh I hope you hear me now
[1:42:44] the troubles persuaded them that they
[1:42:46] could not see who was really there oh
[1:42:49] when God accompanies this word brother
[1:42:51] brand will tell us the angel of the Lord
[1:42:53] accompanies this message always the
[1:42:55] Bible tells us where two or three are
[1:42:57] gathered in my name I'll be in the midst
[1:42:59] but troubles can turn us around and we
[1:43:02] say why has God left us why has God
[1:43:04] forsaken us does God even love me
[1:43:06] anymore it was job that says that says
[1:43:09] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:43:11] but Blessed Be Thy holy name David yeah
[1:43:14] the Lord slave me yet I will trust him
[1:43:17] if I make my bed in hell thou W there if
[1:43:19] I send to the heights thou W there it
[1:43:21] was somebody that wasn't isn't allowing
[1:43:23] the troubles oh Hallelujah to bring a
[1:43:26] gloomy atmosphere don't allow the
[1:43:28] troubles to bring a gloomy
[1:43:31] atmosphere troubles it can be hurts I'm
[1:43:34] sorry just give me a few more minutes it
[1:43:35] can be hurts but the brand I'm going say
[1:43:37] this you're in the need of prayer too
[1:43:38] cuz you got a heavy heart but God knows
[1:43:41] the secrets of the heart do you believe
[1:43:43] it he can tell me what is your heaviness
[1:43:45] is about it's because you want a baby I
[1:43:48] see two Dark Shadows you've had two
[1:43:50] miscarriages in your time that is
[1:43:52] correct
[1:43:53] it was two miscarriages two hurts that
[1:43:56] brought on this gloominess it can be
[1:43:58] hurts it can be scars it can be
[1:44:00] something that happened 20 years ago
[1:44:02] that can bring up an atmosphere of Gloom
[1:44:05] amen but here stood a prophet that was
[1:44:07] saying God can heal you of that and we
[1:44:10] later on brother Brandon would cast
[1:44:11] those those darknesses out you know the
[1:44:14] Bible would tell us of King Bazar y
[1:44:16] remember the Bible says he was had he
[1:44:18] was troubled and and his countenance be
[1:44:20] to change and you know that is that that
[1:44:22] really struck me that whenever he was
[1:44:24] troubled his countenance begin to change
[1:44:27] it was because of the troubless how
[1:44:29] many's ever been around like a chilled
[1:44:30] guy that never gets upset never gets mad
[1:44:33] but then you see him sometime and he he
[1:44:35] he just blows up and something L up to
[1:44:38] that right some kind of trouble started
[1:44:40] to change his countenance CU he's now
[1:44:42] he's normally not that way we had a we I
[1:44:45] worked with a guy you know like man this
[1:44:46] guy never gets mad the boom he he blew
[1:44:48] up it was something it was troubles that
[1:44:50] changed his countenance and the Bible
[1:44:52] says in Daniel King bshar he was
[1:44:54] troubled and it changed his countenance
[1:44:56] but what would happen the Bible would
[1:44:58] tell us that it was the queen that would
[1:45:00] say there's a prophet Among Us there's
[1:45:02] Daniel that is the dissolver of the
[1:45:04] doubts he can answer the hard sentences
[1:45:07] he has understanding in Revelation it
[1:45:09] was somebody there that could bring a
[1:45:12] peace in the troubless oh mother Brandon
[1:45:15] would pick that up and would say it was
[1:45:17] the prophet there and the Holy Ghost
[1:45:18] today is the prophet y'all remember that
[1:45:21] he says the Holy Ghost today and he the
