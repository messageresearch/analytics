just let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we get into the scriptures today Father we bow with Thanksgiving in our heart you're so good to us you're so faithful to us you've never ever had an evil thought towards us Lord we're asking that you'd forgive us for the times that we've had evil thoughts towards you the times we thought we were forsaken that we were left behind that we were uncared for because we serve a good god with a testimony you are amazing and yet you are faithful and Lord we're here today with this Thanksgiving inside of our heart today in your house we're recognizing you Lord in your in your glory and we're asking today Lord that you would cleanse us of our sins and our shortcomings wash us with your blood for Lord we want to come in this part of the service just as pure as if we've never ever sinned before because we know you have a word awaiting us Lord Lord we don't want anything to keep the Revelation from coming into our hearts that we might be changed a little bit more into your your image through the word Lord we just pray that you would have the preeminence in the church now bless and anoint your word to each of us may the words that be spoken Lord may they be received as the word of God today for Lord it is you that we are looking to to help us that we might be found Overcomers in this age we love you we thank you for these things and we commit ourself into your hands and the remainder of this service now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen we have two scripture readings quickly before your seated the first is in 2 Timothy chapter 1 and the second is in 1 John chapter 4 second Timothy chapter 1 second in in 1 John chapter 4 and here in 2 Timothy chter 1 verse number 7 reads for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen and then 1 John chapter 4 verse number eight 1 John 4 verse number 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear have torment and he that feareth is really not made perfect in love amen God bless you may be seated and as long as you're saying Amen to the word I I will not ask you to stand up we want to speak on the subject overcoming the spirit of fear and I want us to kind of look at this you know we all are deal with fear in all sorts of way and fear can get a hold of a man's life so strong that it actually affects his body and be began to change the chemistry of his body and can cause sicknesses and all sorts of things all because of fear amen so fear we we we're real uh re um familiar with but the spirit of fear is what I want to to kind of focus on because that is the origin right and we want to really talk about overcoming this spirit of fear now now the fear of the Lord and the spirit of fear are two completely different Spirits we're taught in the Bible that the fear that we're to fear the lord and to fear him that is able to destroy both soul and Body in Hell the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom amen the fear of the Lord is what cleans up a man's life it is the fear of the Lord that makes a man to crucify his own will it is the fear of the Lord that brings us to a closer a more harmonious relationship with God it is the fear of God that does that it is the fear of the Lord that initiates the new birth and not only initiates the new birth but it carries us through the process of the new birth into the statue of the perfect man anytime the fear of the Lord leaves then we can't grow now without the fear of the Lord in a man's life he is literally driven by his own will so we can say that the fear of the Lord is the respect that we have for God Amen that we we reverence the word we believe that what he's saying that he he really means that he's not somebody that just well he says something and it's okay if you don't do it he really wants us to do it it is a reverence that He is wanting us to exercise in his house he wants us to reverence his house but not only his house he wants us to reverence how we talk and how we act and how we conduct our lives he he wants to see the fear of the Lord uh always being projected with our lives the fear of the Lord is is something that operates only through freeor agency it only operates through self- willingness our choice our desire our will whereas the spirit of fear is something that is forced upon us against our will against what we want the two Spirits they operate by different by different channels one is I present to you my will I present to you uh uh this is the way I want you to walk ye in it amen and the other says you know what I don't want you to read the Bible I don't want you to pray and I'm going to force all sorts of things on you you don't got time to do it see it's it's a manipulation basically the spirit of fear comes to us if we like it or not it's there so we need to pay close attention to this God has allowed this fear to exist in the world that we live in the spirit of fear is like an alarm it's a a a a fright a terror and its job is to to make us to dread or worry about something to stress or be anxious about something it it causes us even to Panic or to get into a state of anxiety all because of the spirit of fear amen it may come to us as a a thought but we have a choice on where we're going to do with our thought we can say fear is an unpleasant feeling that's triggered by the perception of danger whether it is a real thing or something that's unimaginable and the job of the spirit of fear is to trigger our perception of danger through manipulation in other words this situation happens and we think oh the Bottom's going to fall out is it see it it it it wants to trick our perception we've heard people say that um well we might even said it they know how to push my button are you are are you with me okay it's it's it's that I know it's coming they act a certain way say something wrong to us and it can trigger us to say and do things that really we would be doing without the mind and the love of God God Amen remember the prophet said it's not the action that happens to us but it's how we're going to react that is really what's important to God that's what he's looking at in short when we yield to fear then it will most likely produce us to act in fear and to start using fear on other people because we're scared ourself we're afraid of something so we need to manipulate a certain situation and the Bible says to whom you yield yourself servants his servant you are no no matter what direction say someone cuts us off in traffic that ever happened to you it can trigger an unhealthy per perception of danger amen they shouldn't have done that that was rude that was mean that was careless and and and actually driving can trigger road rage anger driving somebody off the road fighting shaking your hand we even heard of shootings happening all because of road rage so you understand this this Fear Can escalate that's its job it's to trigger our perception of danger by manipulating our minds about what's going on and getting us to think that God is not in control of our situation amen because if he can do that he can get us to start trying to take a carnal control of a situation amen outside of the great thing that we should be doing which is trusting God people who have got real problems with anger actually go to anger management to help them to better cope I remember someone driving along with me when I was in the car and this has happened a number of times with me driving and someone would cut me off do something wrong and the person sitting in the car next to me and say well why didn't you just beat the horn why'd you let him do that why don't you let him know it happens all I need to do is beat my horn then then they get scared and then else happens and then we both get in an accident right God has not given us the spirit of fear amen the spirit of fear brings fear to us and then we begin to be a a servant of fear and everything we're doing is with fear and we can get to a place in our lives honestly that our life is just full of fear and not even realize it motivated by fear making most of our decisions because of the fear that's on us that we we we wouldn't make the decision the same way if we just had the peace of God Amen and in Luke 21 if you like to turn there with me or we'll put it up on the board here uh describes that there will be signs of the coming of the Lord now to to us who look for him when he appears who love his appearing it's exciting amen but for everybody else who's looking at the signs of his coming it's bringing a fear and it says in verse 25 and there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity in the sea and and waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for one reason for fear and what is this fear stemming from from them looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken in other words God is going to allow it men's Hearts failing there think about this the devil is stronger than any man's heart and if he can manipulate people who to get a a a perception that there is a danger in front of them that God is not going to handle for their life then they feel that it's okay to step out in fear and just go crazy and feel Justified about it verse 27 and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory verse verse 34 and take heed to yourselves last at any time your heart be overcharged and there's this overcharged with surfing and drunkenness and the cares of this life and so that day doesn't come upon you unaware so now he's saying all these things are going to be happening out there people are going to be looking at this and you need to be to be walking with a love for me for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth now we've all seen movies or stories where somebody's you know walking through a jungle or somewhere and all of a sudden they step on something and the the the either they fall into a hole or the Rope gets tied up and they go upside down and they're hanging it's a called a snare unawares that it was there and so many people on this planet the whole earth is everybody but the bride is going to fall into the snare so he says here watch ye therefore here's the remedy here's the remedy and pray always well I'm not really wanting to pray very I'm you're going to get in big trouble men ought to always pray and not faint watch ye therefore get used to praying get used to praying make that part of your your time until you're out of here it isn't just something that we need to do now for a couple weeks and call it quits no it needs to become part of our life watch you therefore pray always that you may be counted worthy accounted worthy to escape all these things that are come to pass and stand before the son of man in other words when God sees you praying he'll he'll take care of you he says you're worthy you're praying you're worthy I'm going to show you amen now we're not just fearing what's going to happen to our country and we know even um uh the the uh don't don't want to ever bring up politics but we know that President Trump has said look if we get one more if if if if we have one more uh thing one more what am I trying to say brother one more term that's the word I'm looking for one more term we're going under we're going down because there's this perception of we are going down everybody sees it it's weird how nobody really so many people don't care about it or so many people are blind to it but we're not just fearing what's going to happen to our country but we face every day in our personal lives fear in almost everything this spirit of fear is real and we come face to face with it all the time every day I'm wondering if they're going to mess up my order again so we got the countertops done we got the the sinks done and oh I woke up this morning I'm going to show Stan how to put these sinks in get the sink I put it on there and it's almost it's the wrong sink I didn't know it at the time but I found out it was the wrong thing they sent the wrong sink and so I'm talking to him today I said well can I ask to duplicate that order can you tell me why you sent a different sink uh no I can't that's the end of the story really doesn't matter at this point we need new sinks I wonder if they're going to mess up my order wonder if they're going to cancel on me again I made a a time to get together with them I wonder if they're going to cancel on me again I wonder if they're going to move my appointment after I went through all this beer I wonder how he or she is going to be when they walk through that door today I wonder how they're going to react when they find out about this when they have to deal with this situation when the boss finds out when Mom and Dad finds out I wonder what's what we're going to do without money without insurance without a car without without help fear Fear Can attack us even at the restaurant I'm going to say it like this before you get to the restaurant I'm unsure what what to order when we get there I'm looking at the menu and there's so many choices there is it's it's it's so hard what shall I what shall I choose for dinner tonight I don't know so I'm asking you what do I want what if I don't like it what if I have to eat something that I don't like like as kids we did it all our life when our mom and dad said it there but why we face that is such a horrible fear I don't know well to be honest with you I face fear all the time the fear of disappointing someone the fear that the shop cannot continue on successfully without me the fear that I will not be able to do everything that's in my heart to do so fear is a real thing and we face it daily and we need to remember that this spirit is not from Heaven am yet God has allowed it to purposely be there amen God has orchestrated the spirit of fear to be among us to be a part of what he wants you and I to face every day the spirit of fear is not here by some crazy mistake that God made or or Satan pulled a fast one over God God wants the spirit of fear here today as much as he allowed it in heaven and as much as he allowed it in the Garden of Eden but I'll say this to you God has confidence in his own seed they will not be succumbed by the spirit of fear amen David knew that he walked alongside of fear all the time David knew that God had allowed the spirit of fear around him but he also knew who he was and who he belonged to and the seed of God does not have to fear anything anytime anywhere for any reason because God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and love and a sound mind amen David didn't fear the bear he didn't fear the lion he didn't feel G but I'm telling you all three of these produced a fear and it was there but he did not allow what was standing in front of him to come and manipulate his mind of what is now about to happen see we have we've gotten to the point I think that we just anything that comes into our head we don't try the spirit right and see whether it be of God or not but I'm telling you you need to try the spirit every spirit because a lot of times it's a spirit of fear it ain't even real what I'm saying it isn't it it it's spirit of fear is real but it isn't real for you because God don't want you to inhabit but I just look at David's attitude here in Psalms 27:1 he said the Lord is my shepherd I'm sorry the Lord is my light my salvation Whom Shall I Fear you know if the light is really shined on your situation that this is this is all this is you remember the story about uh The Wizard of Oz and everybody thought it was some you know thing out and we find it's a little guy behind the curtain well if God is shining the light on the situation you should better have full trust amen amen he's going to save you out of this situation amen he's my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life that's right and whom shall I be afraid well brother John and I haven't felt very strong in the Lord okay it's real simple it's not difficult it's not hard the book says they that wait upon the Lord got to get back to what God wants you to do we must come to grips that God has allowed the spirit to be around us even to the end of the world but we we have a choice to be quietly confident in God we have that choice so in other words God wants you to stand up against the spirit of fear Amen to stand up against it to say no this is not part of me you may be speaking to in my mind but I don't accept it verse two when the wicked even my enemies and my foes They Came Upon me to to uh to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell in other words God takes care of your enemies when you trust in him and he said though a host should encamp against me everywhere you know what I am choosing I am choosing my heart heart shall not fear David was not saying I am some great guy all he said is I serve a great God there's the difference he had faith in the God that he served amen it wasn't some religion amen it was a it was a relationship though War should Rise Against Me In This Will I be confident you have a choice are you going to be confident in God or are you going to believe the lie of the devil because God has not given us the spirit of fear this is a choice that David had and he stood there facing the fears that came to his mind now we see in the Old Testament these were just the not just these are all natural battles going on that he had to face right now in the New Testament we're facing all the spiritual one they're like that guy's acting like a lion that girl's acting like a a a a bear a and and and that's a real that's a real giant situation happening you don't understand God allowed that there he wants that to be there he doesn't want you tormented but he wants it there because he wants you to overcome to overcome it he ain't going to take it away from you you're going to have to overcome it God never took the Giants out of the promised land he said go in there they're nothing and you got to believe it we have a choice we got to believe that God is with us in every situation all right Psalms 23:4 Psalms 23:4 says yay though I personally walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil look it's it's a choice for for thou are with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me why why aren't you going to fear why aren't you going to fear anymore because you are testified fine God is with me I'm going to testify hey you're either going to testify God is with me or you're going to say I don't know about this one I don't this is different you know you say that is different every single day it becomes different and then pretty soon every day it's all about fear you got to take a stand against the spirit of fear amen and look God wants us here he said thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup rolling so here we are sitting in church and you know what fear is all around us but God said it's okay it's allowed to stay it's allowed to stay I'm I'm even giving you the word that you can overcome fear Amen in other words I'm not going to kick Judah out of the discipleship I'm not going to do that he has a purpose the devil has a purpose fear has a purpose the thing is it's not going to come n this dwelling that's the only thing right there there's where the you put down you put your foot down that's where David put his foot down the devil is allowed to be where wherever God allows him to but he can't come inside our mind our hearts because this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost right surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever yeah fear is going to be all around me I'm going to walk through the valley shadow of deal my my enemies all this is going to happen but you know what so is goodness going to follow me amen God is with me it doesn't matter God is with me amen we've got to believe that for our lives Psalms 56:2 says my enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me oh thou most high what time I am afraid I will choose to trust in thee amen look if you don't make the right choice then you're succumb by the fear and then now you're operating by fear and you're unsure about things and fear will stay there as long as you allow it you have to cast it out you have to cast it out you have to say get behind me Satan get out of my mind get out of my thoughts I let you in too long wrong I'm taking a stand you're not going to manipulate me anymore Isaiah 12:2 Isaiah 12:2 says behold God is my salvation I will trust and I will not be afraid right now this seems to be easy on paper but it was just as hard for day or for for for Isaiah and and for David is for you and I when we trust God what we're doing is we're showing we're pleasing him without faith you it's impossible to please God so when you you take that stand and you say I'm going to trust God in the middle of this turmoil that's going on right now amen I'm going to choose to trust God Amen you know something had happened this is the truth I also say it so I'm going over the the weekly what's you know what's happening in in our finances which I do every week and and I don't even remember this until I had borrowed money we were literally and I looked at it earlier this week we were literally in the negative that just doesn't happen at trusted tool so we had money that hadn't come in yet but it was still an an un it wasn't balanced it wasn't right and I you know haven't been there all as much as I'd like because I've been I've been doing some other things for Cheryl and things like that with a greenhous and um so I in my prayer I just said this simple prayer Lord just take care of that that was it walked in today and all a sudden we got 30,000 in there but that was just only thought I had about this there was no fear but the only thought I had was just say a prayer and it was that simple there was no pleading there's no there was because there God has proved himself so much to me and if look you can stand up and testify God has done so much for you you should be able to trust him for what's going on when fear suddenly comes oh I want to finish reading that can I do that this I love this Isaiah 12 vers to behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song uh he also is become my salvation in this situation therefore well with joy shall I shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation am look salvation just wasn't for you when you got saved there is there is so much that water that we can draw from and be safe from so many situations and we're supposed to have Joy about it he's done it before he'll do it again but we need to have that confidence and we need to we need to feed that confidence and walk with that confidence and not allow the spirit of fear to have its way in our life so when fear comes suddenly comes knocking comes tormenting remember always remember you have a choice in the matter to trust God Amen now here's where the devil gets so many people what are you going to do about what's going to happen what if what if what if you know what he does he tries to give you the 20 questionnaire that's what he does because he knows you can't answer them so there is one one answer that's perfect for everyone I trust God Amen and that's all I need to do I trust God I don't need to know anything else Jesus Christ he's crucified that's all I know I have a love relationship with him he's taking care of me he never told me Midway you're going to have to start taking care of yourself again as long as we can continue to put him first God will hold up his end of the bargain the moment we stop doing what we need to do it's a conditional promise seek ye first the kingdom and all the things will be added to you am to continue on in fear remember this is a choice you can't say well yeah this happened and this and and you know it's still like you know hasn't happened yet and it still you know bother me and then this and and then that I'm telling you you have made a choice to be there yes don't tell me you haven't and you can't tell God there you cannot fear the fear the fearful go to the same place that's what that's what that's what the Bible says the fearful goes to the same place as the unbelieving so we can't just you know say it's okay to fear no it's not tell the devil where he belongs amen tell the devil where you're standing amen you know when the angel would appear to humans to to God's people they would often say fear not in other words you got a choice you're you're you're startled you're but but fear not you have a choice I am here to tell you you have a choice fear not I love it David said what time I am afraid I will trust the I will choose to trust God Isaiah said I will trust and not be afraid Isaiah had a choice and we have a choice and I know what I'm saying this is that I'm actually putting a little pressure on on you holding yourself accountable to stand up and say okay I'm not going to give into this fear but we got to do that you can't wait till everything D settles you got all your needs met you got a million dollars in the bank your health is there everything is going great okay I don't fear no more that don't work like that you're God's children God allowed fear to be here and you're an overcomer amen you're an overcomer that's it you just trust God for that the fact that God does not hand out fear yet he has even orchestrated it to remain that means he must want us to Simply overcome it right so instead just wishing it wasn't here and getting rid of it what we just do what God wants us to do right overcome amen when we're getting attacked nope not me remember you have a choice we're not going to allow fear to enter our minds and our hearts or we're going to choose to trust God fear is a tactic of the devil that he uses to actually paralyze the minds of people what what is it it just you know if you just think about this there are certain snakes out there they will they will paralyze you and we know that Satan is just some serpent right and so fear comes and he he just brings this thought this could happen and it kind of paralyzes you what does it do it causes you to lose hope like God is not big enough to take care of this God is big enough to take care of anything is anything too hard for God so we understand he's got this poison and this poison is he traps you into thinking things can't change and he does it through manipulating us manipulating us God's not with you right now you know what you're on your own these same Devils get on people and cause people to manipulate others into what they want right okay so we went from the devil speaking to us now devil is somebody else acting like the devil and if it's not we're not careful that Spirit can get on us and then we'll start manipulating others it's through fear right some of you get full of the spirit of fear because you know you didn't get dinner done on time you didn't do my laundry you didn't well you're bad it's all your fault you knew better you're dumb you're stupid you're an idiot they'll they'll swear they'll curse they'll chew them out get so mad and anger why are people acting like that one reason because a spirit of fear got on them a spirit of fear now they would never admit that but that's why because if that fear wasn't there there would be no need to manipulate there'd be it's it's time to pray honey it's time to trust it's time to take this before God oh you've never been you'll never amount to nothing throw your hands up in the air walk out you ever done that ever seen somebody do that now look I knew there would be some things in here that would kind of Sting but I'm just being honest with you if we don't want to recognize the spirit of fear on us how are we ever going to overcome it it's not just the spirit that speaks to our minds it's the spirit that gets on us and then we start projecting a manipulation towards others fear paralyzes the minds of others so they can't handle situations right they don't know how to just soberly quietly say God's got this I'm not sure how it's going to happen but God's got it what we're going to do is we're going to pray the same fear that the Devils use on us when we're alone is the same fear the devil uses through others to manipulate us into some kind of hopeless condition feeling like you don't have any power like you don't have any any strength any any Sayo and makes you feel worthless come on men's Hearts failing them for fear right amen as a snare it shall come upon all them that dwell upon the Earth watch ye therefore and pray don't try to overcome fear without God you are not stronger you are not greater you are not better you need God you need God on the inside fear is allowed to exist and it's allowed to stay around but it's not allowed to be inside of us not allowed to be in our minds we need to get back to prayer amen I always remember hearing brother Johnson say this a praying man he said would never hurt you if a man that prays or a woman that prays in the spirit will not hurt you just won't happen we're not ignorant of the devil's devices we don't fight against flesh and blood we become more acute more sensitive to what's happening in the spiritual realm when we're sober when we're Vigilant when we pray because the the devil is out there seeking whom he may devour but he cannot devour me because I choose to walk with the Lord Prayer not only opens our eyes to see others trying to manipulate us but it also opens our eyes to recognize the devil is using to manipulate us see imagine for a moment the devil could no longer speak to our minds but he was able to use everybody else to get to us he could just take his hands off and there' be confusion and problems and Chaos so it's not just the thoughts we need to recognize the enemy trying to manipulate us through other people I want to make this statement as we get into trying to wrap this up with overcoming fear just as oil and water cannot mix fear and perfect love cannot coexist fear and human love are interwoven together they mix and they can exist fear and human love coexist all the time but not fear and perfect love it's impossible Divine love trumps fear see the scripture tells us that perfect love cast out fear so the key when we're so worked up we're so bothered is not to get that situation straightened out not to put that person in their place not to not to tell them they're off and they're wrong and they shouldn't have and prove that ain't how you get rid of fear you get rid of fear by perfect love amen Divine love not just human love well I'm going to try to love this person a little bit more through this that ain't going to cast anything out but when exactly it will make it worth because it's it's confusing it'll go so far then it quits and it stops there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear has torment and he that fearth is not made perfect there's no fear in love they cannot coexist what happens love demands fear to leave love demands fear to leave its presence go and you know what love perfect love is the only thing that can cast it out now I'm not saying you can't come be prayed for and in the name of Jesus cast out a spirit for that is not what I said what I am saying is that if you want victory over fear then you must you must cast it out out of your life with perfect love because otherwise you cast out a spirit of fear it can come back but you get filled with the Divine love of God and I am telling you God is in your Tabernacle amen and fear is not allowed to be there I'm just saying God does not allow evil to be around his court what happened when Adam and Eve fell he he put cherubins there to protect them from getting to him well there's cherubin over him watching him there's archangels God does not want to pollute his throne with with fear with evil so I am telling you love God with everything that you have within you because God does not allow fear around him and I say around him it may be out there there but not in his court amen not in his court doesn't come in oh yeah let's just you know you know manipulate me no get out of here I know you what did the demon say to him have you come to torment us before our time because there is a it oil and water it don't mix either does perfect love and fear amen we don't want to say I got love and then you allow fear there don't do that love will not be in the love of God will not be intimidated it will not be tormented with hopeless thoughts it would not be used it would not be taken advantage of it would not be manipulated by fear love the love of God will not be brought under control by fear you know what it doesn't even have time to spend with it it doesn't even got time to listen it can't coexist if it comes knocking at the door Perfect love just says get off my property amen get off my property it isn't a wish list look you could have 10 people around you all worried worked up full of anxiety right inside of you perfect peace perfect loveen it shall not come nigh thy dwelling am perfect love patrols these grounds it's like you know like the police they they Patrol right make sure things are in order stay in order well the Holy Ghost patrols these grounds no fear is allowed it makes sure that it is not allowed to stay remember you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost so if you're serious about overcoming fears I say this first seek the love of God brother Bram said when he went there cross the curtain of time he said this nothing but perfect love can enter in Amen in other words when he was there and they were coming up and my precious brother my my and all this was happening and he couldn't describe what is this I've never seen this before in human love he was not being bombarded with thoughts of you know what you forgot to do that one thing that you should have done he wasn't tormented with fear because he was in this place of God's presence called perfect love and everybody that came the a everyone testifying to him perfect love no fear was there well that's up in heaven but what about down here are you going to be a believer that you can have eternal life in you or do you think you got to wait to get there to get it that's why the prophet said whatever you do get perfect love in other words get serious about having this in you if you can't believe that you can be changed what are we doing sitting here what are we doing listening to this tape God cast out fear with his own presence Satan is not allowed to be there turn with me if you would to Psalms 91 we have to try to hurry because what you know why you've been here before because there's still more to come Psalms 91:1 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty so there is a place with God yes that it he he calls it secret in other words nobody knows about it except you and him I want you to think about that we can be in church we can have a Hallelujah meeting we can dance we can all sorts of things can happen but that is not what this is talking about we're talking about dwelling dwelling I'm telling you you go up to a stoplight and you got to wait for that thing to turn green that your engine is it it's idling is dwelling there it's stopped when you go home tonight you're going home to your house where you dwell you're not going to dwell somewhere else tomorrow you're not looking for another house the next week it's your Dwelling Place if I went to your house you could tell me where you keep your slippers you know you know the secret you know the secrets in your house the secret places you you could tell me where the licorish is at where the chocolate is at there's a place in Christ that is just you and him and if you want to know more of the secrets you're going to have to get alone with him in prayer and spend a lot of time there because we don't serve a God that's some Santa Claus granny that just all you have to do is spend a couple minutes and it'll meet all your needs that is not the God we serve we serve a god of commitment I will say of the Lord I am gonna say this is going to be my testimony I'm gonna come to church and I'm gonna say he is my refuge my Fortress my God in him I will choose to trust surely he shall deliver me surely there is no question about this I do not fear surely he will deliver now let's count the odds it's way out the good the bad the pros the cons let's just think this thing through no surely he shall deliver thee he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust that's a good place to [Music] trust something about being In the Arms of Jesus his truth shall be thy Shield his truth his word this message it's our Shield not whatever you want that's not your Shield your Shield is his word and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid verse five for the Terror by night or nor the arrow that fth by day through the course of the day the devil can come with so many thoughts at us zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom I'm not going to be afraid by the terror there's no fear that's going to come into here he's allowed to do this yes but he is not allowed inside because I have taken a stand amen I think God is calling us to stand up a thousand demons verse 7even shall fall at thy side and 10,000 demons at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee why because you're in the secret Dwelling Place With God you're in this place called perfect love amen verse n so real because thou has made the Lord which is my ref Refuge even the most high thy habitation I choose to dwell in perfect love not dwelling in church not reading your Bible for an hour every day it's about dwelling in the perfect love of God you choose to dwell and live in the presence of God's Divine love in other words when somebody slaps you on the face it is no problem to turn the cheek when you're being used and abused asked to go the Second Mile you know Perfect love just steps in and says I've already been asked to be like my my husband is that what Jesus said be ye perfect even as my Father in Heaven is perfect amen because he have set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him set your love somewhere else see if God delivers you you know so many people walk away around so in this world natural carnal wanting help with this that and the other and they don't even care about setting their love on God it's like it's not in their equation they can read it they can hear it being preached but it it just doesn't it doesn't connect and I'll just say this water and oil doesn't mix but if you're having a Trouble With Fear With Your Love I'm going to say take the love you got and just start setting it upon God because all of a sudden fear is going to go bye-bye you're going to have strength to say get behind me Satan there shall no evil verse 10 says Beall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling amen God has not given us the spirit of fear amen but of power love and of a sound mind I do not have to accept what the devil's bringing to me that's what he was trying to tell Timothy in that scripture turn with me if you would to First 1 John chapter 4 opening scripture we're going to try to get through this really really quickly because time is is is getting close I I don't want you to think you know it's here yet I want you to relax and think it's like just a few minutes after we started 1 John chapter 4 verse number 16 [Music] says and we have known and believe that the love that God has to us God is love and he that dwelleth in that secret place called love is actually dwelling in God and and if we choose to dwell there that means God is in US herein is our love made perfect that we may have a boldness in the day of judgment can you imagine being as bold as on the day of judgment now we we think of judgment being a place of God have mercy on me oh no and here John is trying to tell us that we can actually have boldness on that day in fact if we understand the scriptures we take our judgment here we have our white Throne judgment here because we all stand before the white Throne right we all stand before but ours is here we just do it willingly there it's unwillingly and we're literally sitting next to God on the on that Throne is that right we're going to judge Angels it it just so we can have this boldness here is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is we decided to be the same way in this world I'm going to love just like God loves amen I'm going to give like God gives I'm going to live for others just the way that God did I'm going to let him come inside there is no fear in love but perfect love it just cast out fear because fear has torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us amen so you know what I I believe I can love God back with the same love that he loves me with If any man is going to go off what I'm saying here he's got his own little thing going and and if any man just says I love God but he actually is really inside has a hate problem well the white Throne judgment says he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother who he has seen how can he love God who is not seen and this commandment we have from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also yes makes it clear doesn't one more scripture and this is in Romans chapter 8 and really um that was at the at the end when I was in back here studying I got to thinking about this here at the end of Romans chapter 8 talking about nothing can separate us from the love of God and and and basically Paul is trying to give the Romans a a confidence that that if he says if God be for us who can be against us what what shall we say to these things who shall lay anything to the charge of of God's elect what can be placed upon the elect of God to make them fear nothing nothing think about that there is no sin there is nothing if God before you now if you're not let me just say this if you're not under the blood fear can have its way in your life yes yes if you're in the love of God God will not allow anything to come against you because that's what Calvary was all about he doesn't look at us as as having to be perfect he's looking at us to be in him Amen in the love of God so he says in verse 30 who is he that condemneth and in verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ who's going to separate us from this dwelling place is it going to be tribulation a distress persecution famine nakedness Peril sword are you fearing any of these of course maybe in our time you know our electronic you know we got other things we can put in there are are we going to is anything going to separate us absolutely not amen as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we're more than a conqueror we're more we're more we didn't conquer he already conquered yes amen we're just dwelling in his love we're more than a conqueror we're more than a conquer through him that loved us not in our own abilities for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels principalities Powers I love this can you read this part with me nor things present things present in our life nor things that are even to come I'm not going to fear things going to come I'm not going to fear the things that are present nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate me from the dwelling place of God the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord let's Stand Together God bless you amen nothing nothing real simple just believe what the word says believe it you ever been at at in your home and you heard some some scratching I mean we were one time we were in Ohio at Airbnb or something like that and so we weren't real familiar with the place and all a sudden we heard this what's that I I don't know how many times you better go outside and check what's going on but when you go out and you see that oh that was just the thing rocking back and forth it was uncovered that it wasn't what you what the devil made it sound this word is to uncover the devil in our personal life so that he canot have a hold on us and so we can stay connected to the Lord amen let's sing I've Anchored In Jesus amen upon upon Liv's boundless ocean where Mighty Billows roll I fixed my hope in

a brother brandom said character is not a gift it's a victory and honestly to better trust God is character because he's he's the only thing that can beat the devil amen there's the revelation we need
