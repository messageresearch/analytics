redemption is hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirits up your Redemption is here the day of redemption is here its hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirits [Music] amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord I I think that's a perfect song for us to get into our opening scripture in Matthew 24 I believe that the coming of the Lord is very soon amen amen we want to continue on basically a part two of a three-part series on election today and talk about the traits of the elect um you know there's I'm sure we've all wondered at one time or another whether we are elect how do you know who is elect what can the elect do what can't they not do I mean there's just questions about the elect of God um but I believe according to the scriptures that we can know what where the elect are standing with the scriptures what they are doing what they are not supposed to do according to the scripture so we can identify ourselves in the scriptures and we can identify the elect in the scriptures and if we line up with the scriptures then we know Who We Are amen because the Bible says that many will be deceived and and we don't want to be part of that group amen that's what I believe this this series is for let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer and then we'll read the scriptures Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this opportunity to be in your house and Lord what a beautiful thought it is to reflect back on our lives at the time that you called us out of the world we go back to that time lord knowing it wasn't us just interested in something but it was you calling us to get right with you and to get our lives prepared in such a way that we could be part of the elect that bride without spot or without wrinkle and God lord from that time till today we have faltered we have failed we have come short of your glory and yet Lord you're holding on to us you're keeping us Lord in your you promised to see us through and we are so grateful to you Lord as we approach this subject we just pray that you'd open our hearts our understanding that you help us to see in the scriptures that the things that were Were Meant to see we pray that you would keep us from saying anything Lord that would bring any sort of confusion or any any anything wrong but I just pray that you bless the ministry of the word today bless the hearers of the word we commit the service to you now and give you praise in advance for we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Matthew 24 starting with verse 11 of course it's talking about the end time and verse 11 says and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many didn't that we just sing that in that song and then dropping down to verse 21 through 24 for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh safe but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall rise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much as if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect amen God bless you you may be seated to think about there's a tribulation coming upon the planet that has never been or never will be and we can look back and know about all the wars and all the horrible thing dictators have done and terrible things but there's coming a tribulation that we've never experienced before I believe God is shaking is going to shake up things Hebrews 12 verse 26 says whose voice then shook the Earth but now he have promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven so God is shaking things up brother Brennan said in the message Revelation chapter 4 he said that's what he does today the Holy Spirit comes to those who God has called there's a great shaking amongst the elect great powerful things going on but the but the world knows nothing of it right remember brother Brandon preached that message the invisible Union of uh the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom and so there there is a work that's being done in the elect and I believe they're getting ready I believe God is speaking to the elect and the bride is taking what's being said seriously applying it to their lives and by doing that they're making themselves ready and at the end they can Rejoice let's rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the Lamb has come for his wife have made herself ready now in part one we laid a little Foundation the word election means selected or Chosen and God is selected or chosen us before there was ever a World so it was in the mind of God that he chose us we were a part of him now he never chose this on the basis of ourselves we didn't have really anything to do with it in part three we're going to get into the scriptures declare it was on the basis of God's love for us that he chose us God knew that his elect bride would love the same way that he loves and they would remain in that love it's like a covenant oh the Lord just opened up some beautiful things and just be praying about part three but we want to talk about some of the some of the traits of the elect there's there's a lot of different ones but we know that the elect of God are scattered throughout the world and uh many of them don't even know their elect yet just think about when God came to you amen amen you didn't know you were elect right until you started hearing the word and you started boy there's something inside of me that just that knows this to be the truth and it your spirit bore witness with his spirit that that you are the children of God you're the elect of God okay now we brought out that one parent can have both the natural seed and the spiritual seed inside of him Abraham was a natural father of many nations but he was a spiritual father of one spiritual Nation and that spiritual Nation that's the elect of God yes sir they are the Seed of Abraham through the spiritual seed of faith and I know that sounds kind of deep but it's it's really not deep it's just you have to believe without seen you have to believe Abraham wanted to be wanted Ishmael to be really God's seed in which uh the spiritual seed would come forth uh but uh Abraham he didn't know he was if I could say at for a point was deceived and not really knowing that Isaac was the one that God that God wanted but Abraham wanted Israel to be a part of God's Everlasting Covenant and he said here in Genesis 17 18 and Abraham said unto God all that Ishmael might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear be a son and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him now you've got to remember these these scriptures for part three and as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I I have blessed him and and will make him fruitful and will multiply and make CND 12 princess shall he beget and I will make him a great nation amen remember he's now the natural seed but my Covenant this has nothing to do with you Abraham but my Covenant well I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at the Set time uh in the next year so the son of the flesh was literally mocking the son of God's promise we know the story in Genesis chapter 21 and verse 10 says and Sarah said unto Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be Heir with my son even with Isaac so there was a separation here and the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son he really really had a closeness with Ishmael and God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the Bond woman and all that Sarah have said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called he had to remind Abraham again about the spiritual Covenant and also the son of the bound woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed now notice natural seed spiritual seed Abraham had two seeds one was natural one was spiritual the spiritual seed is the elect of God it's just all there is to it by faith by God's promise it's not the natural believer so a good trait a good trait is don't come into church don't read your Bible don't listen to tapes carnally right you have to you have to mean business with God I I God I am your spiritual seed not I am your natural seed I am your spiritual seed amen Abraham wanted the natural seed to be Heir but God wanted the spiritual seed to be here so we see here that there was a a point here where Abraham the father of our faith was not on the same page with God now Isaac he also had two seeds one was natural one was spiritual right the Bible tells us that uh Isaac loved Esau really wanted him to be the heir but he didn't realize God hated him God loved Jacob the supplanter he was willing to go to whatever extremes he had to get the birthright and I'll tell you I think God loves the believer who's willing to do everything he has to do to make sure he comes completely Born Again of the spirit of God he was the elect seed of God and I believe that when we become born again completely born again because there's many people who start right they get Justified they get Sanctified and they stop they don't go on to get the oil right they live good clean lives we call them good Christians but they don't go on to get the nature changed now there's no way that you and I can judge another person whether they are elect or not we want to make sure that we get that out there that's right no matter what but we can search the scriptures to clearly identify what are the traits of the elect and I believe we can do that now If Abraham would have stayed in that that place of no Ishmael is going to be the one well then see it would have proved that he wasn't elect he had to submit to the word the elect will always submit to the will of God amen you know they may fight they may walk in Disobedience or they may go down a wrong roll they may go down a pit they may do some wrong things but I am telling you if our righteous man falls seven times he'll get back up he'll keep going he'll get back on the right track because the elect cannot be deceived they can't maybe for a short season but eventually the spirit when he the spirit of Truth to come he will lead and guide you into all truth because we are just as much of God as God as he God can't be deceived amen so the natural seed is carnally minded now this is scary because we all have to operate right but we don't want to just come into church Carly minded we don't want to read the Bible currently we want to be spiritually minded so the natural seed are after the things of the flesh they mind the things of the flesh they're thinking about all the things of the flesh and the Bible says that they that are in the flesh cannot please God so the the two seeds the natural seed and the spiritual seed there's a separation remember Ishmael he was blessed naturally his mind was natural I mean they got all the oil they got the gold they had so much of the natural but the spiritual seed don't think like that they're spiritually minded they they're they remain dead to their flesh or to their will they are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh but they are led by the spirit of God to mortify the Deeds of their body amen amen now there's a difference between the spiritual seed and the natural seed God is always one other thing about the foundation we're still in the last lesser less service um God has always had a messenger to the elect for every age brother Branham shared that and William Branham was God's Vindicated messenger for this last age I feel sad about those who question and doubt and are are still looking thank God that he's revealed to us the messenger because if we don't know who the real message messenger is how are we ever going to know the real message we can't be picking and choosing God's message from 13 different people or 13 different message 13 different preachers you know God is not the author of confusion amen he doesn't even have two Major Prophets on the scene at one time so there won't be confusion brother Brandon said even true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers notice there's people that are saying this is God's truth but it's not and that information that goes out there now gets in the minds of people and then they don't misunderstand it that they don't understand they misunderstand what the prophet meant when he said certain things in the message why women got to dress like this and act like this and why the men got to do this and and what they shouldn't do it's because you've got false teachers out there that are saying it's okay it doesn't matter what you do yeah and and that this brings a greater confusion right brother Brandon said the last messenger is sent to the elect which is God's word born bride so in this age this is the only age that the actual elect of God or the Bride of God become the full manifestation of the word we have something that that the other ages didn't have that's why brother random said not that's not the reason I don't know the reason but brother Brown said this is the greatest age that he would rather live in is this age the elect are the ones who receive the true interpretation of what the message is now this is important because there's a lot of people who are in the message but have not received the right interpretation of the message but they're calling it The Message and I love this this quote right here uh brother Brandon said the word Revelation because the elect will receive the prophet the revelation of the word this word revelation brings the elect of God out of the world and into a full Union with Jesus Christ now there's too many people who stop with just coming out of the denomination coming out of the world and saying I'm in the message and that's their interpretation of the message is not to be out there in the world but you've got to come into the full Union with the word amen [Music] because that's what's missing brother Brandon said in the message God called men he says but didn't God raise up he he the Nations to straighten out Israel in the days gone by yes he did the Bible claims that Russia and communism and communism is playing right into the hands of God to absolutely rid the Earth of the people but before that can take place the Rapture comes and takes the church home before that can take place and if that so close at hand how close is the rapture well you're always reading in the news about Russia and sometimes China says if it's so close at the hand how close is the rapture that's what we should they like should be looking at closer than that it's closer than that so you see why why I'm preaching the way I do he says why I'm struggling as hard as I can why God is everything that he can do to press that into the elect to draw the seed of that woman out so the seed of the serpent can be punished that's exactly right and that's what he has promised to do so we see that there was a real purpose a real heartfelt reason that brother Branham preached the message the way he did because he was trying to get the elect out so this world can be demolished and and we can move on with God it's awful quiet in here now everybody's not here so that means I want everybody to say Amen eight times more than you normally say huh all right so if a person is elected of God there's certain criterias that will take place and I want to look at some of these traits one of the traits I want to look at is that they cannot be deceived Isaac didn't know who God had elected with his children but Rebecca did right God came to Rebecca Sarah and Abraham didn't know who was elected for a season and just because a person is elected it doesn't mean they won't go through a season of being deceived now this is why we can never judge anybody that's true but eventually the holy spirit will lead and guide a person into all truth and if it doesn't happen the truth remains that there's they're in an area of deception right right it's it's a trait that we don't want to be in we don't ever want to be deceived I'll just say it like this if I'm doing something wrong please come and help me I don't want to miss it amen and maybe I'm just been too stubborn to hear God's voice speak to me about doing something and I'm just bullheaded well God will use his he'll use my brothers and sisters he will use somebody to come and shape me up because God don't want me to miss it he has an expected end for me yes sir it's not about I'm so special that I can just do whatever I feel to do and if I'm black God or show me personally no God don't always show me personally amen sometimes he's got to use somebody else in the message Ephesian Church age brother Brahm says only the elect will really know which is the true spirit the true Spirit notice only the elect will not be deceived I I tell you I I could see why brother bran says I'd rather have the right spirit and have the wrong Doctrine than to have their white right Doctrine and be wrong in my spirit now there's a group of foolish virgins who thought they were elected until they realized that something was missing in their lives and it was too late it was too late we know what that was that was the Holy Ghost but the question comes to all of us how do I know I have enough Holy Ghost I think it's a fair question I I think it's scary just to say I've got the Holy Ghost as if that that that's you're all taken care of how many people has said I've got the Holy Ghost and they're not even in the message anymore the Holy Ghost leads you into truth that don't lead you away from truth amen I don't want to say that we got enough Holy Ghost I want to say we need to have the attitude that Paul had and let's press towards the mark keep calling on God for more Holy Ghost amen there's a group in laodicea who think they're elected to make it but the Bible tells us that they're blinded to the fact that they need to buy deity they're blinded to the fact that they need deity which we know is God counsels them come by of me deity by of me my life trade your heart by you you buy this without money without price but you you give your heart you repent you say not my will Lord but thy will be done but how do they know how do people know how do we know that we got enough of God enough of deity enough of the Holy Ghost it's not a matter of just thinking that we're elected or just intellectual believing as the prophet said that we're elected it's a matter of us humbling ourselves to search the scriptures to find out are we lining up with what the elect do man that's what this little series is about and I hope you with me take this more serious than just come to church and hearing a sermon and and but but really trying to apply this and no matter how tripped up we get with something I want to say this to the elect God will see you through the elective God will not remain tripped up God will make sure to see us through now that gives us very much comfort to me [Music] but I still have to receive correction from my brother my sister I have to receive correction when I read the Bible I have to receive correction when I'm listening to tapes I can't just listen to the message and look for something that I got to be Lord what is it that you are trying to correct in my life because that's the job of the holy ghost season the job of the Holy Ghost is not to be an Aaron boy for us that's right amen all right trait number two the elect will not be deceived in remaining in a state of iniquity right amen are you with me on this our very lives were shaping into iniquity so at a very young age we learned that we could get away with a lot of stuff without doing the right thing we know iniquity is knowing to do the right thing but simply not discipline yourself to do it in other words you have the knowledge but you just choose not to do it right and I'll say today as this lukewarm Spirit just is getting stronger and stronger and stronger it's really what makes this age the hardest age it presses on the people that they don't have to do the right thing and you're still okay you're still going to be okay and that spirit is strong now a trait of the natural seed will be they will remain in iniquity they will remain there the natural seed will they'll never get away from it it becomes a part of their life in fact they they they they can still go on with God while it's there and and Matthew 7 verse 22 many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesy in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and thy name done many wonderful works and then why profess unto them I never knew you'd depart from me ye that work iniquity so we see that this iniquity is actually in the church and if you think about it if you if we had time to go into scriptures we could see that Lucifer defiled the sanctuaries with his iniquity the actual sanctuaries of God people coming into church without the fear of God so many people are deceived away from the foundation of the word and they basically become foolish Builders they build their their house on the sand their their relationship with God on sinking saying right but look at the trait of the spiritual seed of God here in second Timothy chapter 2 verse 19. second Timothy chapter 2 verse 19 nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure having this seal can't be broken having this sealed the Lord knoweth them that are his amen praise God and so what is he telling his children now what is he telling those that are are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity so this is this is not about proving I don't have iniquity in my life or proving how good I am this is about checking your life to see if there's anything there that you should be doing that God asked you to do right that's what it means to depart from it and the elect will depart from iniquity I'll say if it doesn't bother you to lollygag around us you're shown the trait that you're not elect that's all I want to say it should mean something to you to not be an iniquity I want to show signs of election the Bible says make your calling an election sure that means you can't just lollygag around in iniquity you can't allow those things in your life [Music] second Peter chapter 1 verse 9 says but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see a fire off if you're forgotten that he was purged from his old sins I don't think God wants us to forget that he purchased from our old SIDS you wherefore the rather brother and give diligence to make your calling election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall now give diligence this is what this means give much attention use speed make effort be Earnest move forward Endeavor labor study now that's how we need to be about making sure about our calling in the leg but here's how laodicea look views this oh I know I'm elect I don't have I know I'm in need of nothing and it's it's they're not making effort they're not using speed they're not given much attention they just know and I tell you Paul knew but he still pressed towards the mark he never said I've attained he never expressed that he attained and even though he had Revelations that were so great that you you he could utter them but he never felt like he attained to the place where he was ready to go we're just dealing with spirits that want to you know get on us right now when we forget what God has done for us we tend to not feel indebted to him okay let me just just be a little bit carnal for a second let's say I did something to to brother Mark like I stepped on his foot and I come back to brother Mark and I say brother Mark I am sorry I stepped on your foot and brother Mark says well you shouldn't have done it I said will you just please forgive me brother Mark I didn't mean to step on your foot okay you need to be praying about it a little bit more Brother John and if he held that attitude all this time you know what I would feel I'm indebted to brother Mark because I'm always being reminded he hasn't forgiven me are you with me now Christ has forgiven us but he doesn't want us to forget what he's done for us amen and that's why every time we get on our knees and we say God forgive me for my sins today we should we should remember Calvary and what he's done for us and and then we feel indebted that we're going to get up and we're going to live for God that day and we're gonna we're gonna go win a soul for him today that indebtedness now when iniquity gets a hold of a person's life they begin to lose respect for the things of God true that's very true uh-huh iniquity can really bring about where our relationship is with God a person with a nickery will begin to show less and less respect for God's word necessarily do away with the word they just show less respect they just focus on the part of the word that benefits their life God this is your promise for me God you promise this God you said you'd wash your God you said you'd provide they focus on the part that just benefit them and they lose respect for doing the things that God commands but God's word is a two-edged sword it cuts down to the very intense amen of our hearts I want to get into this iniquity because I know Satan enough that he would like us to just not talk about this [Laughter] an example iniquity is present when a person starts coming to church and feeding on the word without fear and without respect they come into church and they begin to feed in the world and they don't have that reverence and respect you know iniquity is beginning to work in them and iniquity is sets in when a person will start caring less and less you know when you got saved you just loved everybody and you cared about everybody and after a while if you're not careful you can lose that Lucifer is our prime example of this he was perfect until iniquity was found in him or until he stopped caring about doing what he was supposed to be doing maybe he started getting up there and he started leading the worship but really in his heart as he was doing this he was wanting people to give him attention [Music] and he couldn't wait to after the service was over because he was going to go talk to some more Angels hey would you like to follow me I'll let you do your own will are you with me Matthew 24 verse 11 says that many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax code how many times have you had a thought when somebody didn't show you genuine love we're living in an hour I mean the whole world hates you know there's so much hate in the world it's just growing and growing and growing and growing well I know we're not in the world but the spirits are still trying to attack the church and we got to protect the church we got to protect one another Jude chapter 1 verse 10. but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beast in those things they speak evil of corrupt themselves woe unto them for they've gone the way of Cain they ran greatly after the Arab Balaam for for reward and perished in the gang saying of Korah now Jude mentions three religious believers they all believe in God religious believers but they all have something in common they're selfish they're self-centered and what they wanted they wanted for themselves all three of these and there's a lot of believers who start out right but end up going the wrong way running greedily for their flesh spiritual perishing not naturally but spiritual perishing with their dispute that word gang saying means dispute contradiction strife and disobedience it's a spirit of just disputing contradiction strife and disobedience start out right but don't end up right now God views verse 12 these three religious Believers as spots in your Feast of love your feasts of charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear so they're feeding on the word without respect to correction from the word and what stops that is the iniquity that's inside of them afraid they use the word for what benefits their flesh but ignoring the word that corrects their life and brings their character more into the image of Christ it's what it means to feed without the fear of the Lord spots these are spots in your Feast of Charity feeding themselves they are clouds they are clouds they are without water carried about the winds trees whose fruit wither without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots Raging Waves of the sea foaming out of their mouth their own shame wandering Stars just going here and there to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness forever no Foundation the elect of God will not go to church without the fear of God amen we were just talking about the traits of the elect they will depart from all iniquity because the word declares that the elect will so we're just identifying what the elect do is we talked a little bit in in part one if we remember the elect go through a process of sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ so ah when you depart from iniquity you are going through a process of sanctification of the spirit unto obedience so they will depart from a state of iniquity nevertheless the foundation of God says sure having this yield the Lord knoweth them that it is and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity we have that responsibility of not just rejoicing in Christ and using the name of Christ to cast out devils but we've got that responsibility to depart from the things that we're just allowing a disobedience in their life about something are you with me all right a third trait is the elect our faithful they are faithful Revelation 17 verse 14 says these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords he is the king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful the elect will be faithful you've got to get rid of these excuses of why we not going to read why we're not going to pray why we're not going to listen to this why we're not going to come to church why we're not going to live for others they're just excuses the elect will make excuses they are faithful brother Brennan said in the message what heareth thou Elijah he says see we're so prone to go after the gifts instead of The Giver when you see signs and wonders take place don't notice the signs so much but look what's behind it is that still Small Voice that speaks that's the reason we can't have revivals in America is because it's because people go after the gifts instead of The Giver that's what the matter with the world tonight oh we got uh we got if you want great crowds and audiences um you have to have a real classical Hollywood outfit with a lot of show American people want entertainment yes they don't want the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ so therefore the radio and the TV television will give them more entertainment than the church can do it and they stay home all that comes out I want you to be blessed with this last sentence all of that come out is the elect of God that's still hungering and thirsting and calling and crying for the real thing of God Amen oh I love that quote Hebrews 10 verse 25 says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but not the elect they're faithful but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day of protein uh-huh and then verse 38 now the just shall live by faith brother Mark but if any drawback my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them that draw back unto Perdition but we are them that believe to the saving of the Soul well brother John my soul's already saved yeah but my salvation is nearer than when I first believed today is the day of salvation so thank God that he saved us before but we we got so much more today and if we God gives us another day we'll have more to be saved from tomorrow he's building his character in us I believe today by the grace of God we are closer to God today than we were five years ago I believe that with all my heart another trait the elect will remain humble they will remain in their position they will suffer persecution but will never persecute others Lord help me to get through this now Saul persecuted the church when he was unconverted so he was the electors he didn't know and he certainly wasn't acting like elect so if you're elect and you're persecuting all I can say is you're unconverted but when he was converted he was persecuted but he never reviled back oh and if you got time you read second Corinthians chapter 11. it talks about many of his persecutions and you don't see in any of those that he fought back and he he said well I got my rights second Timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but thou has fully known my Doctrine and my manner of life my purpose my faith my long suffering my charity my patience persecutions and afflictions which came unto me not just at one place but Antioch Iconia lystra he said what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me he didn't deliver himself he didn't defend himself the Lord did it yea and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions but evil men and seducers are going to wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived now notice this the world is going down the tubes I mean I cannot believe this this stuff about transgender when I went to school there was none of that stuff but it's getting worse and worse the scripture is being fulfilled in the midst of this evil world that we're living in God has a pride that's getting Holier getting pure get him more into His Image because they're not focusing on CNN right right they're focusing on g-o-d-w-o-r-d the word of God they're focusing on the message of the hour that God sent to get us ready second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 8. we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken God is with us he will not forsake us cast down but not destroyed always bearing now this is us this is I we don't persecute back always bearing about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered into the death of for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal thrush so that means I am going to respond to persecutions the same way that Jesus did amen can you say amen I want you to say Amen to the word First Peter chapter 2 verse 19 First Peter chapter 2 verse 19 for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience towards God endure grief suffering wrongfully you know you don't got to tell everybody that you're being wronged right you don't got to do that all the time it's think Worthy if you just endure it amen for what glory is it when ye be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with God that must be that the other is not acceptable amen and he goes on to say for even here unto were you called how many feels like they're elect if okay if you're elect if you're chosen if you're pre you've been called okay so here and two were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps now here's the steps because that's a it's a uh some like you know it's a colon who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he didn't threaten but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously I believe the elect remained humble God gives more grace to the humble I believe that you like stay in their position they stay in the word this is what the word says you don't rely back you don't talk back you just endure it with patience amen how many love the word all right now Galatians 4. turn with me to Galatians 4 the elect suffer persecution but they never persecute others for it is written verse 22 Galatians 4 22 for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by the Bond woman the other by the free woman verse 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of Promise amen the elect right but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now no matter how much we suffer persecution we will never persecute back remember that the elect don't do that brother Brian said in the laodicean churches it says elect cannot persecute light elect cannot harm elect it is the reprobates that persecute and destroy the elect they hate this true seed and they would do all they can in the name of the Lord to destroy God's elected ones we just you know we just got to trust God we just got to trust God God has got the final say so Vengeance belongs to God you know we didn't create them you know I understand they shouldn't be persecuting us but look if they did it to the if they did it to the uh they did to Jesus they'll do it to us if they if they did it to the ripened tree how much more they do it to the green tree right it's going to happen we can't get if you're gonna if you're gonna live Godly Satan hates you he's going to send somebody to try to destroy you but that doesn't give you a right to ever persecute anybody amen amen if you do your mouths are just put up a sign I'm showing the trait and I'm not elect I'm just we need things to motivate Us in the in the right direction not judging not pointing fingers I'm just saying here's the target let's go towards the target now another trade is that their purpose The Lex purpose becomes the same purpose of God which is to get all his family together I mean we just got to get out of this world Jesus said I'm not of this world I don't I don't pray for them that you'll take them out of the world I just pray that you'll you'll you'll you'll you'll keep them hearing that they they'll be one with me and they will do what I call them to do which is go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature get the law seeds be Fishers of Men get this get them safe so we can get ready to get out of here the focus of the elect is the Salvation of Souls the focus of the elect is the Salvation of cells no matter how hard the trials get that is their focus they need to stay focused second Timothy chapter 2 verse 10 second Timothy chapter 2 verse 10 if you want to write it there therefore I Endure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory I Endure all things I'm willing to go through all the persecution I'm willing to do everything I got to do for the elect's sake somebody has got to see Jesus Christ in you somebody has got to see the Living Word today that he is the same yesterday today and forever and sometimes you got to go through a lot of stuff and just be as sweet just be full of Christ amen don't ever get discouraged when you're suffering this is what Jesus said about Saul in Acts 9 15 but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me the illah now to Bear my name before the Gentiles and the Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake now you ever go up to somebody and say hey can we can you do me a favor would you do something for me and they say well it depends it really depends on what it is you tell me first and then I'll tell you well if God has called you to do something it would be an honor to suffer for him you don't find any Scripture that that Paul says no I don't want to I don't want to do this you you you hear him glory in in his infirmities you you it was an honor for him when he's shown his credentials against other ministers he wasn't talking about how many people he baptized he was talking about one of the things that he suffered for the Lord and I'll tell you as the elect of God if you're willing to just suffer to help somebody I'm telling you you're showing traits of the elect today second Timothy chapter 2 verse 11. second Timothy chapter 2 verse 11 it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him and if we suffer we shall also reign with him isn't that beautiful the bride with the bridegroom if we suffer we shall reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us so the elect won't deny him but the foolish virgins he denied because they were unwilling to go get the deity the goal that was tried in the fire that was that could go through the test and still be okay with it now verse 13 if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself I'll tell you why I love this scripture No Brother Bruce loves this scripture we are part of God knows that we're frail there's a human part there's there's a development there's a we're still in the process of becoming completely born again completely manifested and there's times that we're going to deny the truth and deny him but he cannot deny himself he cannot deny the seed that's within us and he will lead and guide us out of that that deception into the truth can I talk about one more the elect are the only ones who overcome everything they're the only ones that overcome everything like Joshua and Caleb it is because they had another spirit and I'll tell you when we get enough of God's spirit will overcome everything I mean if Jesus said if somebody slaps you in a faith you turn the other one it's let me ask you to go a mile you go too well our flesh don't want to do that I ain't got time to do that I got time to you know you're not going to hit me the thing is that's our spirit now when Christ's spirit is inside of us it's a complete you don't even have a life anymore you can go two or three miles right because you already gave up your life to be married to Jesus to be his elect lady amen but the church needs to overcome all things today is faith in the word of God it's that simple you want to overcome every situation just believe the word believe the word now we've we've talked about a number of things today and I'm sure we've all had struggles with some of them but if you just have faith in that word that that's the example that you're supposed to follow you're supposed to follow his footsteps if you just have faith in that word you will overcome your situation [Music] first John chapter 5 verse 4 says and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith if you're not operating your life by faith you're most likely operating by fear the natural seed will not murmur I'm sorry the natural seed will murmur and they will complain to the cows come home and it's usually because of fear they're fearing a situation so they have to manipulate they have to get involved and they they have to get their flesh working their own ways and if I tell you nobody wants to see their flesh suffer but when you're in the flesh and you're being carnal constantly you're going to find yourself murmuring and complaining but that is not a trait of the elect believers who murmur and complain often don't realize but they're motivated by a spirit of fear now I I could say Amen a thousand times to that statement they're not trusting God the Bible says God has not given us a spirit of fear but a power love and of a sound mind we can trust God through this situation now the elect overcome everything and they would do it without murmuring complain Philippians 2 13 for it is God which worketh inside of you to both to Will and to do of his good pleasure so is God willing your heart he's telling you what he wants you to do he's working inside of you and then through three or more agency you say yes and you do his good pleasure and he says do it do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine is lights in the world Revelation 3 21. to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and sat down with my father in his throne the Overcomers of each age are the elect for that age and the elect will hold their beginning confidence steadfast to the end they are they're just going to be Overcomers and not theirselves not their ability not their wisdom not not their not themselves but they have a an undying trust in almighty God that God will make a way for them Revelations 21 verse 7 8 these are my last two scriptures here Revelations 21 verse 7 and 8 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son you got to overcome you've got to overcome but the fearful and the unbelieving and the abdominal the murders and whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the Lake of Fire which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death now according to the scriptures everyone's a liar right except God that means we have to work very hard to get every trace of it out of us I say don't stop as long as you've got strength and and breath and health you make sure you're doing everything you can to stay true blue to God because Satan's always trying to trip us up doesn't he amen let's Stand Together God bless you just some traits of the elect some things that we can always go back and just check on am I doing these things I believe I believe that's always pleasing to the Lord to do check up and you know brother random I can never forget brother Branham said that he I don't know if he used the word often but I thought it was often that he would rededicate himself to the Lord and he didn't have the attitude once is enough you know he just always doing checkup and he taught us to turn over every Rock to check her Motors check our objectives and and just make sure that we're pleasing him because the elect is the only ones that please the Lord all the way amen amen amen let's just bow in a word of Prayer father we thank you for the scriptures Lord that plainly declare uh these things for the elect Lord we know there's more things in there we pray Lord as we searching the scriptures and we read and we listen to the tapes Lord that we'll be hearing looking for that voice that still Small Voice speak to us in the things that you want us to do and Lord when you tell us what to do Lord help us help us to do it with any sort of murmuring or complaining but just with Lord you you love a cheerful Giver you you love us to just want to love doing the things believe your word declares that the Commandments of God are not Grievous Lord help us to love you Lord enough to keep all your Commandments father I pray that you blessed this group Lord those that are listening on the live stream those that will listen to The Archives Lord I pray that you would bless each and every one of your elect with just an awareness of these traits Lord that they would always be mindful father Lord we just thank you for your precious word that Lord you sent a prophet in this age to help us to see Lord that you are truly going to have a bride without spotter wrinkle Lord by your grace we want to make you happy and fulfill that in our lives granted for each one each one of us Lord we commit ourselves to you we thank you for these things we thank you Lord also for the grace that you've had in our life for all the things father that you have forgiven us for Lord we just thank you for your mercies we thank you for your grace we thank you for the blood of Calvary that you died for all of our sins God we thank you for a living relationship with you a real living relationship and God we just pray that it would continue to grow that you would speak to us on a daily basis Lord that you'd help us to see the things that you're calling us to remind us of the shortness of the hour the days that you're shortening for the purpose of us Lord and Lord teach us to number our days because we only got so much time Lord we we commit ourselves to you we thank you for these things or we humbly pray in Jesus precious name amen amen thank you Lord thank you Lord for saving my soul you [Music] you give me home thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me whole whole thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free one more time thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me whole thank you Lord forgiving to me thy great salvation
