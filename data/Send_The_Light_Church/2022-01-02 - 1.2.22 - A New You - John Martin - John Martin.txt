happy new year to everyone and amen amen so good to see that you've weathered the weather and god has kept you safe and for those that stayed home we say god bless you for being safe and i'm sure uh some had to work and we just want to pray for them i also want to say thank you for each of you that have helped our brother jonathan and sister gabrielle in helping them move in this difficult um time this uh trial they've been so good to help us i think it's good for us to help them so let's continue to pray for them that god would just provide his leadership what he wants uh for for them in their home that they could just be settled in the place that god would have for them amen turn with me if you would to the book of revelations chapter 21 we want to entitle this message the new you not the new year but to do you amen amen before we begin reading here in this precious word uh let's ask god to bless our hearts and our eyes and our understanding heavenly father lord as we come before you in prayer once again we thank you for this opportunity that you've given us to gather in this warm building to know that your presence is here lord because you promised in your word and that's lord when we don't necessarily feel you we believe you and we believe you above our feelings and we believe in your word above our sins and above the things that the enemy would tell us about our sins we thank you for that blood that we're saying about today that it is great enough to wash away all of our sin and we thank you for that blood we pray that if there be any any doubts or anything that would still be lingering at this moment we just pray that you take it from us lends us washes sanctifies set us a apart for this service today we ask lord that you would open our eyes uh of understanding give us revelation of not only your the word that we would read but the quotes and lord the very message inside the message today give us spiritual ears to hear lord bless your people be with those lord that could make it today we ask lord that you'd be with them in their homes visit them lord and grant to them the same grace that we're asking for you today we commit all things into your hands now for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen revelations chapter 21 starting with verse number one and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea nigh john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and will dwell with them and i'm sorry and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful he said unto me it is done i am the alpha and omega the beginning of the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving the unbombable and the murders and whoremongers sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake of fire which burneth uh in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death amen god bless you you may be seated it was kind of uh i should say it kind of didn't want to end on that last verse there was not a real encouraging verse but the reason i i wanted to read that is because god's going to make everything new he's going to make us new but if we're fearful we don't believe that we end up in the same place as all those who just don't care and it's important that we believe most people do not change they do continue to manifest more and more what they are in that sense they change but they never really change to a new person most people at this time what they do is they turn over a new leaf but eventually that leaf turns back again many times we try to better our lives but they don't ever quite end up being exactly what we desire them to be so i believe what we need is a spiritual vision a spiritual vision not a vision of somebody else in the church or what's going to happen in the world next but we need a spiritual vision for our lives what we are to become now without a vision the bible tells us that people will perish people around us will perish our families will perish i'll say it like this including ourselves we can perish without that vision so we all must have a vision amen we need a vision for our lives a vision for the new you and you must hold that vision in front of you don't let anything distract you from becoming the new you so for a subject today we want to take distracting from god's leadership it almost sounds like two different subjects but to me the distractions is what satan is putting in front of us so we don't become new brother brennan said the image of the beast is now being formed the bible says that the sons of god are now being manifested so we're there's there's a manifestation coming we just want to make sure we're fitting into what god wants us to be now in our opening scripture we read about a new heaven a new earth a new jerusalem heaven is going to be new earth's going to be new i believe we're going to be new jesus said i make all things new when god originally made everything he made it perfect and it was beautiful the bible says it was good but everything became perverted because of sin right just like satan he was created perfect and beautiful but then he became perverted he wasn't content right he wanted vain glory it was a real simple thing we we look at at trying to get attention and glory and look at me is not a big deal but i'm telling you that was the big deal that's caused the downfall because god is not going to share his glory with anybody so with his power he perverted the thinking of the angels his power his power wasn't like a magic wand type of a power but it was the ability to convince we all have that power to be an influence one way or the other for good or for evil can either influence our kids we're going to be doing some services on parenting one way or the other way so then after he he he perverted the thinking of the angels he did the same thing with eve he perverted her thinking and through ease fall every man woman is born now with the same self-centered nature that lucifer had in other words it's about me it's about what i want now in life it's no longer god's will that's why when we're born we don't we're not born and grown up and just you know wanting to do god's will and and share all of our toys and and go late on our lives for our brothers and sisters no there's there's fighting and arguing and i want my way because that's the very nature brother branham has has told us that satan has caused sorrow and pain and hurt and sickness and and all the tears and death in every hospital insane asylum that there ever was it all happened to eat the bible does say that satan has weakened the nations look at how our nation is becoming so weakened even other countries look at our our country and and look at it as so weak satan was behind this and is behind us and he's trying to weaken the church everything has become so godless so sinful perversion is everywhere it's a lawlessness in the land and it tries to creep in the church god has to destroy everything that's not of him there's no reconciling there's no fixing there's no restoring of this world the bible says as it was in the days of noah and we know that there is nothing but evil continually on the heart of men and so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so god is going to have to destroy everything with fire then he destroyed it with water now he's going to destroy it with with fire he's going to make all things new amen now we're at the end and god is on a mission to make all things new that's the mission that he's on the bible says the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like a bullock and the dust shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountains saith the lord isaiah 65 17 says for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into the mind let's say it like this our future is more important than our past but what do we think about all the time our past our past our past we need to be thinking about our future there are certain things that god just wants us to forget all together isaiah 43 verse 18 says remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold i would do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it of course we're going to know it because it's happening in us and i will make a way in the wilderness and the rivers in the desert jesus said i make all things new his word is not going to return void it's going to accomplish what it said so we are going to become new now despite this world's terrible condition god is ultimately in control do you believe that but did you know there's one thing that god is not in control of that's right it's our will it's that free more agency that he's placed and and what's scary about this is that some believers think that god is leading their life so much that it doesn't matter what they do where they go god is still in control of them it's almost as if the the devil can't pull one over them you know god can't lead our life and it does say the footsteps of the righteous are ordered the lord but i can tell you i don't act righteous all the time so why am i going to say that god's still going to lead me when i'm not in the spirit and where do you draw the line we're never always in the spirit but that doesn't mean god's still not leading us for what one minute five minutes five days five weeks five years you understand we just don't want to think it doesn't matter what we do god's still leading us now i'm not saying god hasn't told us what to do i'm just saying we may not be listening to it because we're too much doing what we want to do i think satan has more of a vision and a purpose than what he's trying to accomplish than a lot of believers he comes to church with a purpose to get us to question to doubt sometimes we come to church because it's church how many had this thought today be honest with me i hope they cancel church now that that i hope they cancel church now that wouldn't be our heart but that would be our flesh and so our flesh wants to do things and we just feel because it seems good seems right that god is in it but that's not necessarily true too many believers are walking around without a vision or purpose for their lives like there's no target there's no goal there's no mark they're not pressing towards one certain thing we as believers are supposed to be spiritually awake amen walking discreetly circumspectly peter said in uh chapter 5 verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your enemy your adversary the devil as a royal lion he walketh about seeking whom he may devour so we just can't take it easy whom when we meet him we resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world we're all going through this in the midst of this chaos world that we're living in everything that's happening around us god is on a mission to make everything new amen and his purpose for our life is to make a completely new creature out of us a completely new nature change a completely new image now we're not there yet i'm not saying it hasn't started of course it started that's why we're here but it hasn't completely happened yet right now the devil's purpose is is real simple it's to stop you from getting there and that's where all the distractions come from satan wants you to feel good enough all the time don't worry just relax it's all under control the devil wants to distract us from the thing that god is trying to bring us to that's why we need a vision amen that's why we got to hold that vision in front of us it's true that god will not lose one predestinated seed they're in the palm of his hand but too many believers are gamblers just like the children of israel they gambled with god that they didn't have to go all the way they were hey god's leading me look at my shoes everything is they don't wear out i we've got healing we got when we get sick we've got healing god is with us led by the pillar of fire every day but they still didn't think they had to go all the way with god into that nature change that's what the promised land is for us it's a complete nature change it isn't just saying i've got justification i've just got this part of the holy ghost it's all of it it's a land that is it's you basically you kick out every enemy out of your life every bad habit every bad nature change and it is completely of god too many believers are gamblers oh i'm pre-destined don't gamble if you are live like it press towards it press towards a mark become what the bible says you're to become god wants to make a new you and satan wants you just the way you are don't go anymore paul understood this i'll say it satan's strategy and that's why he pressed towards the mark paul always put something in front of him that god was dealing with him to press towards he was always pressing towards a higher christ in his life jesus faced a great warfare with satan we know this satan tried to stop the grand purpose of god when he said to jesus if you just bow down i'll give you whatever you want i'll give you all the kingdoms of the world whatever you could ask for i'll give it to you and he owned it that's why nobody is born with a beautiful nature when we look at the babies that are born they are beautiful looking but we're not looking at their nature but as they get older you begin to look at their nature and you see that it's not going to be like that in heaven look at the demons they cried out have you not have you come to torment us before our time even the demons knew there was a time coming for them there's a time for all things it's a time for us that we're going to be changed now think about it here are the demons since eve have been tormenting mankind from the beginning and they have this question for jesus have you come to torment us before a time like hey they're going to be being tormented so much more than they've tormented mankind i don't know how long hell's going to be but it's going to be a terrible torment for millions and millions and millions of years before they're annihilated praise god that we're saved now jesus told his disciples that he was going to have to suffer well that bothered them because that meant they were going to have to suffer so what did satan do he did what he does best he distracted the disciples at that moment from what jesus said he said well this is going to be a lot it would be painful there would be hurt this is going to be a bad situation he distracted them from god's purpose and what did jesus say in matthew 16 verse 23 but jesus turned and said unto the peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offense for me for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men it was just a distraction from god's leadership now this is so important that god's leadership isn't just we come here once a week and we hear the word of god and now we've got god's leadership no god is trying to tell us here what we need to be putting into practice the other six days of the week and you can't just oh you know what that sounds just too painful i don't want to do that don't let satan distract you you've got to be willing to say get behind me satan you're distracting me from the program of god he wants to make a new meow a new me out of me amen god is still leading us to become the new you and satan is still distracting us from god's leadership to become that new you how is god leading us to become completely new by his word there's nothing else but his word he gives us the word in the hall of satan distracting us from growing in it by everything else that's happening in our life everything else that's happening in their life is how satan is distracting us from the word from becoming the new you it isn't just certain things like or major problems no everything else and i want that to sink in because we need to learn to recognize the devil in our lives it's easy for me to recognize the devil in bob because bob did this to me but can i recognize the devil in my life who's trying to get me to point a finger at bob because see satan is accuser of the brethren bob's my brother are you with me i've said this before and i'll say it again the true bride of christ is focused on two things one is finding the seed of god that hasn't come in yet and the other is getting ready for a body change a rapture they're they're looking on to the author and the finisher of their faith see it's not just he saved me but what he's going to finish on doing in my life now how is she getting ready by continuously changing her nature into the nature of jesus christ it isn't i i've been baptized it's all set in stone now no that baptism was just saying i've started going in this direction we still got to keep moving into that nature change we're not ready by sitting still we're ready by always crucifying the old man and pressing in to all things become the character of jesus christ amen i believe a lot of people are expecting a body change because the message promises it has opened our eyes to it but you know what how can there be a body change until there's first a nature change god is not going to make a new body for an old nature not going to do it we can't do nothing about this body no man can but the nature can be changed it's been proven throughout history that's what we got control over we're faithful to that god will do a body change the bride is taking the word from the five-fold ministry and she's manifesting it she's being perfected through what his ministry his word the word is becoming more and more what real tangible it's not just do's and don'ts it you see it fit into your heart into your life more you're applying it to the things in your home hallelujah the things in your family your thoughts it becomes more real to us and it's changing our nature more into the image of jesus christ we're getting character ready for heaven amen that's what we're doing that's where we're at we're in that process we should be able to see uh such a major change from this year right now to what it was last year it should be happening she's not just manifesting justification sanctification or even the uh pentecostal powers of the holy ghost but she's manifesting the full character the full nature of christ she's and it is being seen in how she handles her life and she's feeling it with a greater burden for souls now i'm just referring to the manifestation of her becoming the word most churches and most believers they're under the spirit of laodicea but they don't know it not only they don't know it they're not need of anything you know what they're working in harmony with satan they're so distracted from becoming in god's image that no matter what they talk about they think that's all there is that's the main thing because it's the main thing of their mind but the true bride of christ is under the anointing of the holy ghost and she's working in harmony with god because god wants to make her new not a new seed but a new manifestation of the sea that's in there and those who are working in this harmony with god those who are where they need to be in christ they are in love with god they're walking in the spirit they're submitted to his will and they're growing to the statue of a perfect man and the bible says they've been called to a greater purpose to his purpose right they're hunting for the predestinated seed that's why she can say that everything that happens to her is working out for the good because she's in harmony with god's plan god can't come and destroy the world until he gets out the seed and that's where the believer puts feels that responsibility from christ something inside of i can't sit still i can't be lukewarm i can't just you know go to church and try to be a better christian there's something inside of her that gets her off the seat and starts you know even if you don't reach somebody that day if you're trying something inside of you just knows you did the will of god on a regular basis i want to ask you a question what do you use the holy ghost for what is what is your expectation of the holy ghost in your life what do you want him to do for you i believe most believers expect him to comfort them where yet my situation to supply all their needs to help them with all their problems to lead them in whatever they're doing to help them with their plans that's what they use the holy ghost for that's what they talk about the holy ghost for you listen to conversations that's what they are but i ask this question or these questions is this the purpose in what god sent the holy ghost for is this why god gave man the gift of the holy ghost is this the reason god sent back the holy ghost to the church my brother branham did say we can make god like an errand boy and he's good god he will he'll do he'll do whatever you want him to do you believe oftentimes he's good to the good to the to the un good to the evil to the unjust and to the just god is god but that is not his purpose just like brother branham said healing is just the bait we need healing we want healing who won it right but it's just debate for a greater purpose because eventually we're going to die there's nobody that was you know back in the 1800s that that god healed you know five times six times and they're still living today eventually you die so it's just debate it gets it shows the power of god but what we're looking for is a nature change i got a bunch of quotes is it okay if if uh brother brandon ministers this morning thank you all these quotes are taken from the message what was the holy ghost given for god's purpose we find here in sending the holy ghost was one purpose that god himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church wow on purpose that's why no other flesh is allowed to lead this church in any fashion former way you brothers that lead worship it's got to be god the ministers every special everything that's done it needs to be god in the church because god wants to carry out his plans to his church now that's a it's a quite a bit different concept than what we think the holy ghost is for in our lives the man says god the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of god living in his church moving through each age working out his divine will not using him for our will understand the difference i want to do this god i want you to help me with this and just as sure as you're hungering tonight for the holy spirit it's something in you poem you that a purpose of god in your life has got to be fulfilled see that's just god inside of you he's working in us to fulfill his purpose i like how brother branham simplifies it because you know we make god everything else brother man said that's the purpose of the holy ghost it's the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plan to finish his plan of redemption now look at how many times he says working through you working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the loss as he did in the garden of eden adam adam where art thou in other words that same spirit is in the bride still crying where's the adam where's adam that's what the holy spirit does to a man or woman when it strikes into their heart and it takes a bold there's a thirst and a hunger for lost souls in all honesty do you have this plan inside of you we know it's true we know it's the will of god but do you feel that burning because you can't you know to go the rest of our life and say i got the holy ghost but never feeling the bernie what are you doing what are you doing you're rewriting the word you're rewriting the message he said that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough spirit touching it to go for souls of the lost and the dying it's more to make a name look at me or to make a church or building or denomination instead of a soul-winning program how pitiful he said we could say much on that i've got a lot of scriptures and we may not make it this morning through them all but i want us to remember one thing the new you god is going to make a new you and that's why we're we're reading so much of this because we we don't want to just use god for our natural lives i'm okay with it i'm not saying don't do it what i am saying is do what he purposed it for or else we're going to miss it jesus says you can gain the whole world what would it do for us at the end we're looking for our nature to change that's a real thing character changes today there's where our testimony should be it's on character change brother brandon said the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that saved the methodists that baptized the pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the lord wow that saved the lutherans that baptized no that sanctified the mess and baptized the pentacles is now setting in order the coming of the lord jesus so we're looking at here's the purpose god is setting us in order for the rapture it's no longer i heard a message i'm going in the rapture praise god i'm in the message much deeper he said when it'll be so powerful that the body will come to this group a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave they'll be resurrected that's what the holy ghost is for without us they cannot be made perfect kind of sounds here that brother brown says we'll call them out you talk about having to have the word he said for the rest of the dead live not for the space of a thousand years that's right just holy spirit filled people was all that went into the rapture not holy spirit anointed not holy spirit used not holy spirit blessed but filled we got to keep going i mean every morning i pray god fill me with the holy ghost i know how evil i am even i just agree with jesus jesus says you evil you you know you that are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall the heavenly father give you the holy ghost of them that i just keep asking amen i want more brother john are you saying you don't got it are you saying you don't got enough i am declaring i don't got enough amen let the whole world know i never want to come across in any way to anybody that i'm something when i know i'm nothing amen amen i'd rather have to say we i well i'd rather have somebody say well you don't belong up there no problem i'll go sit down i honestly but something inside of me is not going to stop me from helping people [Music] that thing didn't that thing didn't come of of man or else we'd all be doing it before we even came to the lord right he said all my dear friends from around this country and this little city if i could only with my human voice place in your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost it would be the most wonderful revelation that you ever had in your life he said you must do it i want more revelation of the holy ghost in my life he said you're not sealed by believing on two in other words i believe i'm going to the rapture i believe in i i i'm going all the way no you're not sealed by believing on two but sealed by the holy ghost that seals you when you're found favor with god and he sealed you by the holy spirit god is good to everybody but that doesn't mean you've you found favor that everybody's fallen favor with god or else he would seal everybody god is good everybody but it doesn't mean we found favor with god how we know we found favor with god is when we get sealed and you just you're not even control of your life anymore that's true right it's the holy ghost inside you the only way that you can say that jesus is the christ brother adam says is when the holy ghost comes into you and bears record and witness itself out he is the son of god that's the only way that you know the resurrection is when the holy ghost bears record so we might as well just forget ever trying to say we're we're so we got so much holy ghost or we're so right or uh look what god did for me here no we need the holy ghost just bearing witness with our life now you know i don't have any problem i can put my hand here and smile at you but if you hit me with a hammer step on me kick me in the face it's going to be a little bit harder for me to to stay here and say i love you right right so we bear witness in her trials that's where you bear witness is when you're going through the hard times it shows who's in control brother branham said if you abide in me this is real important saints great revelation in this if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will he says because you're asking his word his word is life speak it if god said it and you're sure of it you're sure he said it the holy ghost bears record that the word is right then then there you are brother speak it there it is say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said and it will come to pass brother branham claps his hands three times but listen he said not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you he's doing the talking i'm not talking to the mountain it's the father that's in you he's speaking to the mountain it has to move all heavens and earth will pass away he said but my spirit shall not pass away my word shall not pass away certainly it cannot pass away father brother branham said it like this talking about speaking the squirrels into existence he said i didn't do that right it wasn't like you know what you know what i'm going to speak some squirrels in existence it wasn't like that god told him to do that god told adam to do what he did it isn't us becoming some some creature that has power to create things we're many creators and the first thing we should be creating is an atmosphere of a nature change that's the thing we got control over create an atmosphere in the church where he's welcome to come and live in your hearts there's a lot of believers who know the scriptures but honestly can't rightly divide them brother brandon says not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you he doeth the talking this has got to become more real to us how can i be sure that god's talking brother brandon said preaching isn't just the gospel right it's all from this message now he said making the word of god manifest is the gospel so you really can't do that in here outside of just how you worship and how you receive the word but you really go manifest it out there that's where the real gospel is being preached it's in your home it's how you handle your situations it's how you respond brother branson says it's not the action but the reaction that counts amen now he says making the word of god manifest is the god's voice says now you can't do it i just love that he says you can't do that now jesus known that that he had to live in his church in other words we can't manifest the gospel ourselves it takes the holy ghost inside of us the purpose of sending the holy ghost was for god to continue through a bunch of people to continually manifest god to the world that's exactly by making his word real not by speaking the word not by saying this is what the bible says but living that all sudden it's it's manifested by making it real just quoting the word doesn't make it real by me saying love your enemy you need to love your enemy i need to love my enemy it's not the gospel the gospel is when i actually go love my enemy when it's real that's when it's real by this you all men know you're my disciples when they see that in action now we're talking about a new you don't let the devil distract you from god's purpose make the word of god real in your life take it personally brother says the holy ghost come to give you power some of you people walking along saying well i just can't quit drinking i just can't quit this the holy ghost comes to live in you to make all these cants get away from you that's right it's to quit making you smoke and drink and want to be a big shot it'll take that rate out of you it'll humber you when you do that that's what the holy ghost is for it's for a holy life that's right it'll make you quit gossiping you say i can't do it oh i just can't do it the man said sure you can't but the holy ghost come for that purpose that's what it did it come to take it out of you and all them old habits and things that you're doing he says there's no excuses that's what it come to do that's the purpose of god send the holy ghost so you would do these things and that you would work and walk after him i don't want to hurt you but i told you i'm here with the deepest sincerity the holy ghost will follow god's word to the letter and a preacher behind the pulpit that ain't got grace enough to preach all the word he says i doubt he's got it i doubt he's got it so in other words there's preachers up there preaching part of the word brother branham doubts that they've got the holy ghost he said that's just exactly well that's what the purpose of the holy ghost is for it's to give unction to the preacher it's to give holiness to the group it's to set the church in order oh we're going to be going through church order now i love this it's to bring unity of the spirit it's to unite us together with power it's to unite us together with love brotherly love that's what the holy ghost is going to do in the church now so any preaching that doesn't culminate to those things i can't say it's the holy spirit doing it the holy ghost wants to make completely new creatures out of us he wants to make a complete new you and the unholy ghost he wants to distract us from that change it's that simple the the if you think about it we don't spend enough time thinking about our nature being changed more in fact when we get thoughts about our our certain habits or certain things that we call it out on we kind of like brush it off and go on to something different when god is trying to get a hold of our attention all the time and saying listen let's get serious about this all we got to do is pray believe wait on the lord he'll give you strength but we got to get to a place where we hold that vision in front of us we believe that we're going to become better than what we were last year we're not going to just turn over a new leaf try a little bit harder no we're going to get more serious with god so i ask the question where are you are you focused on completing your nature change going all the way or are you being easily distracted from it like you just you you can't wait for this you can't wait for that but they're all natural things how about this excitement of i can't wait to be more like jesus where would we be without god's prophet he's a seer he set things in order he helped us to see how the church should be i believe the holy ghost is here to comfort us with all of our hurts and pains and our problems or trials or difficult situations but brother branham said we can make him just an errand boy for our personal lives and it's so much more than that most of our desire for god's leadership is for the things that we want for our natural lives and not the things that he wants for our spiritual life see our characters our spiritual life amen let's take a look at the scriptures saint john chapter 16 verse 7. are you getting a little something out of this and it's okay if if you if you don't express it more i'm just saying i'm not going to you know say you're out or anything like that saint john chapter 16 verse 7 nevertheless i tell you the truth it's expedient for you that i go away jesus speak in your jewish disciples for if i don't go away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him on to you and when he has come he will reprove the world the world that's in you he will reprove the world that's in you of sin of righteousness and of judgment because the comforter is never going to come into you and start reproving the world it's not going to go blow up every abortional clinic clinic it's not going to blow up everybody that you disagree with it's it's not going to call out how rotten politics and our government is and and what's happening all over the world it's not going to reprove that that's not its purpose jesus already made it clear i am not of the world my subjects are not of the world so when he sends the holy ghost to you he's going to reprove the world part that's in you that we were all born with and it didn't get changed the day i got baptized i still wanted to hang on to my records i didn't think there's anything wrong with my long hair and on and on and on so there was a lot of world in there he was reproving and there's still a lot in my nature that he's reproving and i'm so glad he didn't give up didn't stop with me okay verse 9 of sin because they believe not on me notice he uses the word they you just i want you to think this it's so easy to see this when you when you think about the children of israel coming out of the world they're going into the promised land and they're facing these giants they're just they look like grasshoppers in their own eyes in their eyes they look you know we're just grasshoppers they're big giants they don't believe in jehovah that's what jesus is saying here they don't believe of sin because they believe not on me all those devils that anoint us with i can't excuses about moving forward with god the comforter comes in and he rebukes those demons of doubt amen and he says i can do all things through christ that strengtheneth me i can obtain the divine nature change i can be in this image that's what the holy ghost does how does it happen there's something in you that believes i believe that greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world it starts with a belief because they don't believe you can't go out there and say would you please leave me i just don't like this thing in my life no you were born with that you need to kick him out well i can't do it no but the holy ghost can you believe in god he'll do it verse 10 of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more well every demon in hell is distracting the church from manifesting all of god's divine nature god sends the holy ghost inside of a man and lives out his word through him see we can't if we can muster up any righteousness any righteousness in our life we call it self or the bible calls it self righteousness it's not the righteousness of god the righteousness of god is produced by god in you and that's what the holy ghost does it comes in you to produce a righteous life amen and god's righteousness is seen not now when you're sitting on that seat it's seeing how you handle treat others when you walk out the door that's exactly right of judgment verse 11 of judgment because the prince of this world is judged i say the comforter doesn't have any problem coming inside of you and judging what's wrong i i know we don't like to hurt people's feelings right a lot of times we don't want to go deal with somebody because we're afraid of what's going to happen to us what they're going to say what they're going to think but the holy ghost does not have a problem coming and dealing with their heart judging what's not shouldn't be there now we're all going to stand before the judgment seat of christ every soul we the bride welcome the judgment happening right now he comes and he sits on the throne of our and he judges our heart we welcome that all the others don't want that so they get judged at the end but the reward for letting god come now is we got a rapture we get to sit and rule and reign with them a thousand years it isn't for everybody it's for those who are serious about it brother branham said in the message what was the holy ghost given for he says now if you say that you got it and are guilty of these things he said i wonder what's leading you god will never lead you off the word he'll keep you with the word because that's god's own laws of his church for his people for women and men well say you say it don't hire me to do a little this or that but the man says it doesn't the word says it does and if the holy spirit is in you it'll lead you right to the word so when somebody comes to you and says brother sister child you shouldn't do this or you should be doing that don't be quick to judge them that could be the holy ghost speaking to you come on well you know what i don't need anybody to tell me i could hear from god myself you know what sometimes you can be so angry you couldn't hear anything sometimes you could be so lost in in in your own desires and going after your own will so much you couldn't hear anything we can be so caught up in the flesh that we miss god but the holy spirit when it's speaking to you it'll lead you right to the word notice it'll lead and guide you into all truth there's no excuses god don't make alterations or excuses he makes the mark and you told to it he said that's right that's what it is it's with everyone you come the same way when the holy spirit comes it gives you power over the world now i'll tell you this is the thing that shows me i need more holy ghost amen see i can sit here and i can think to myself i can sit in church and say you know what i think i got more holy spirit than this person that's person and that person which i don't even know how anybody could ever think that but there are a lot that think those thoughts but when i measure up to how i'm handling my trials do i have power to overcome the things that i'm doing wrong or the power just to re stop the resistance of temptations i mean the the proof is in the pudding but see in order to really really achieve this for our lives we have to be humble and sincere not not we got to get away from the pull-up the show the front the the making the image of what you want people to think about you you just got to be the real you if if you expect god to make a new new you got to be the real you remember the pharisees they just they they weren't honest you know they but my dad used to say you could feel some of the people some of the time but you can't through all the people all the time and the pharisees they just thought they could fool everybody even god look look satan himself got the other angels to think they could live eternally without god come i'll let you live eternally you can do your own thing with me i'll let you do what you want i won't be like this this tyrant we gotta do everything his will the devil is very persuasive this is the distractions brother or jesus said here in verse 12. i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now god has a whole lot of things to deal with about our uh about our nature about our character but you know what we can't deal with it unless we have the comforting anointing the anesthetic of the holy ghost to say yes lord i agree take this from me because we just we you know change i'm going to be like this when we're talking about a nature change it hurts it doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt god it doesn't hurt the holy spirit but it hurts our flesh because our flesh has been so long with it right nobody likes separation that's why it hurts but understanding that hurt is okay it's got to get cut off we got to circumcise our heart amen amen verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you in all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come the spirit of truth is not going to lead you to build your reputation he's not going to speak of himself in fact if he's going to do anything he's going to make himself of no reputation zippo take you out of the picture he will make you as a servant like jesus he took on the form of a servant we will become a servant just like jesus did and when the holy spirit is come he will be known as the spirit of truth right because this is just this is how jesus said he starts out by saying comforter when he comes and then he says in verse 13 the spirit of truth he will guide you into all truth now for years years and years i used to think that he was just going to give me the right doctrine the right church to be in the right understanding of the word but first of all who is you who is you we're a triune being our body spirit and we're soul but who are you which part is you brother branham did say that you you're you are your soul you are a soul that's who you are that's the part of you the real you that's why we drop these bodies we get a new body now he's leading the soul into all truth not your body not your spirit alone they're hooked together he's leading your soul into all truth brother man said in the message you must be born again a soul good or bad death doesn't change it he says i got a lot of scriptures wrote down here on this one and i want to comment on what a soul is what is the soul it's you you are a soul the part inside of you and when you die whatever shape your soul is in that's the way it goes it goes to its destination you couldn't pull it up no uh no matter how much you wanted to that soul's got to be changed here and born again the soul has to be changed here change you know when you change the furniture in your house you know when you change the color of your house you know when you you change your landscaping it's different and it takes work to do it you know when your soul changes when you're becoming constantly more into the image of god your soul is changing that's why it's so important to let the word have the effect in the soul and not just letting the flesh be satisfied with hearing it i heard the word i came to church i did my part now i'm going to spend the rest they do what i want the comforter is leading our soul into all truth now what is our soul brother ram said it's the nature of our spirit the comforter is leading our soul into all the nature of god that's what this whole thing's about this is what we come to church for every day or when we come to church this is why we read this is why we pray because his spirit the holy spirit is not just leading me what car to buy but how to get god's nature that's what's happening i hope you can see it brother braham said in the questions and answers what is what difference is there between the body soul and the spirit he says your soul is the motive of that spirit or the nature of that spirit god is trying to lead us to change our motives because that that's why brother we heard brother brandon say check your mouse check your motors check your objectives be sure and then when you're sure be sure because the devil's slick we the bible says the heart is deceptive deceptive above all things who can know it we think we know our hearts the devil can sneak in there and try to get a little bit something for himself too you know god is constantly trying to lead us to change our motives to change the nature of our spirit and to me that's the part that he's leading us into all living life living the word living the life of god that's what he's coming to do it really doesn't matter to me how many times he shows me what's going to happen at trusted to two days before it happens it just doesn't matter that doesn't help my nature doesn't help my character why can be more prepared for it so how many times have you known somebody was going to blow up but you couldn't stop it anyways you understand i'm saying the knowledge of those things don't mean anything what means everything to god is god is really trying to get us to deal with our character to to to change to use the word grow as comfortable but to change our nature now as god led the children of israel out of egypt he's led us out of the denominations he's led us in the message of the hour what is left what is left to lead us into manifestation of the word that we can't be satisfied being in the message we should just be i've got to change i've got to change i've got to see the change in me i've got to get more serious about it this is this is why this new year's message it needs to be projected out through the year this theme as we go forward is a new you i don't care how much weight you lose i don't care how much exercising you do right i i don't care if you if you become a vegetarian drink juice the rest of your life it doesn't matter what matters is that nature change the focus on the nature change can you bear with me are you sure okay it's going to be a little bit but you should you're okay with it still you don't know if if you you need to go i i completely understand not going to feel the least bit bad the bride will have the nature of christ in their despicable bodies think about that before the change happens of course the devil knows this so what's he trying to do he's trying to distract you from allowing that change to happen so i don't i don't care he uses two things to distract you here i say it's everything else in life but it can be your desires for what you want to do and it can be all the problems that you're going through in life and god knows all the problems we're going to go through the the rest of this year we're going to go through a lot but those are just to get your mind off of the nature change off of becoming more like him now we know we know of that jesus came to our home corporal body we sat down we gave him a plate at the table we gave him the best room in the house we sat in the living room and we talked with him got to ask him all the questions what do we do about this we would feel so comforted but without him being there well we're just going to get distracted by everything else that's on tv big distractions every problem in life i got this plan and they got that plan they're all distractions to take us away from the nature change we got to bring it home we got to lord increase this desire just like praying for a desire for souls well you need a desire for the nature change it's no different how how many times have you gone to church and not felt you've heard from the pulpit you know we need to have a burden for souls yeah i know we do but it just doesn't seem to be there we got to pray for it you got to invite it in it's the same way about a nature change we need to have a desire for a nature change satan will use all types of distractions who use things like god is leading me to buy this car this boat this gun this land this house this put fill in the blank they're all natural things but how often do we hear people say god is leading me to stop gossiping i cannot remember ever hearing anybody say to me god is leading me the holy ghost inside of me it's leading me to stop gossiping no but it's everything else how about god is leading me to stop being so negative god is leading me to be more faithful god is leading me to lay down my life for others i mean how often do you hear somebody say god is leading me in this direction because that is that is what the purpose of the holy ghost for is to gain control of the church to come in and do the greater works the prophet said i'm not saying that god isn't natural things the comforter will help us in natural things but you seek first the kingdom right then all other things are added but what's more important and you need to be spiritual about this you need to be thinking about spiritual things and the spiritual thing is not what god shows you about somebody else you know i don't understand this but for some reason people are always saying god shows them things about other people all the time and i don't get it because to me the bible says that god the holy ghost will lead you your soul we need to hear more about that amen i think satan gets in there through the accusing of the brethren and begins to say things we've got to understand that's that is not god god wants to lead me to become more in his image and the only way i i'm that's going to happen is i got to go through self-crucifixion i got to pick up my cross daily i got to die to my will and do his will that's the only way but that's more important than if god showed you everything gave you all faith to remove mountains and knew all mysteries and and and anything like that but to be in his image that's brother man said that's the only thing we're coming that he's coming back for so many things i've got to let go now brother branham said that there's a lot of distractions in the church in the church distractions in the church i don't know how many times i've come to church and there's so much talking before the service and all seems to be important to them but it's a distraction brother branham refers to ministering the gospel and this woman wanting to get ready fix her dress her hair and she's going to get ready to speak in tongues like like uh you know like a cowboy movie they're going out in the street and they're getting ready to draw so she gets out there and she's getting ready to speak and talk speak in tongues use her gift but it was a distraction it was a distraction from what god was doing brother branham also made mention about men when they're asked to pray in the church that they pray for everything under the sun the president and just everything that's a distraction he made mention of song leaders spending too much time talking and not enough time worshiping a distraction or children who are not kept in order in the sanctuary and then he goes on to say even after service these are all distractions distractions so it's not just in our personal lives out there you know i know we come here and sometimes we feel like there's rules and regulations as if we go home and there's none just let your children do something that you don't want to do and we'll find out how many rules and regulations you got there they're all distractions brother branham said like this that alley easier couldn't get rebecca to sit still long enough to get her dressed now god is trying to get his church in order for a rapture but he can't get her to sit still long enough to listen to what the word is saying we can't keep leaving church feeling good enough we've got to leave church i've got to put on more of christ come on now i i understand that i'm not a people's favorite preacher i understand that but personally i don't want to meet you on the other side and not be guilty of trying with everything that i have to get you to see what's the most important thing i think the holy ghost is the greatest thing that can make you happy because it is it's lasting it's up to us now how bad we want to hunger and thirst for this last scripture second peter chapter 3 verse 17. before i read the opening scripture i don't want to be a preacher that keeps saying last scripture second peter chapter 3 verse 17 ye therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest he also being led away with the heir of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen don't let the devil distract you don't get distracted continue to grow your nature you grow not knowledge up here but knowledge in here how to overcome all the things that you face that knowledge jesus the bible says and god shall wipe away our opening scripture wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed by i think the bible says in romans chapter 8 that the sufferings of this present time are worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us the sufferings yes it's it's it's hard to put away the flesh but we're the only guy who can do it we're the only one through three more agency that denies our will ourself but that pain that you go through is not worthy to be compared with the glory that's going to be revealed and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these are true and faithful these words are true and faithful let's stand together let the former things pass away in your life keep focused on the new you this year amen and hold your vision in front of you just hold it in front of you god is on a mission to make a new you amen he just wants you to be in harmony with him amen god god bless you let's just look to him in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we're grateful that you called us out of a world of sin we didn't know about you we had thoughts and imaginations but we didn't know you and your word declares that we can't even know you without you being inside of us to to really experience you and to know you you called us to being born again we thank you that inside of each and every one of us here that that new birth has begun and it's continually growing and taking place in our lives lord we're all so thankful that you you didn't just lead us into some denominational church and let us just get wrapped up behind that church to the point of saying that if this is the only church and if you don't belong in this if you're not a part of this and you're not part of god but lord when you brought us out you wanted to take us all away with you you didn't want us to stay outside the promised land he didn't want us to be satisfied with just our needs being met naturally and being led by your spirit from day to day but lord you had a vision for us a vision to take us all the way to take us in to something that no other age has experienced the full manifestation of the word and god a lot of times our visions get dimmed and we get blurred and things of this world creep in and get us off track and i pray god that that you would increase that that vision for our lives of what you're calling us to become that we would not perish lord that we would hold that vision that we could be as paul and press towards it every day and lord that the fruit of that would come that when we come to church we'd be more on fire more in love with one another more love for unity lord the very things in which you you sent the holy ghost for our church lord god we want you the head of our church the head of our lives the head of our homes all that we pursue let it be
