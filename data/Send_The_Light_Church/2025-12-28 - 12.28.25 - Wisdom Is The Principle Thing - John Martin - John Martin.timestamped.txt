[35:20] uh a special blessing. And uh it's so
[35:24] good to see Brother Dennis's wife, Ella.
[35:27] Um what a joy was to meet you this
[35:30] morning. May you may you feel home and
[35:33] and feel God. That's that's why we're
[35:36] really here
[35:37] &gt;&gt; is to meet with him and to receive from
[35:40] him. Amen.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; And I do believe that God always meets
[35:45] our expectation.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; I do believe that. Um well, if you have
[35:50] your Bible and you like to turn with us
[35:51] this morning to Proverbs, uh chapter 4,
[35:57] and we're just going to read one verse
[35:59] there,
[36:02] um and have you be uh seated
[36:06] um after we have a word of prayer. Amen.
[36:11] This morning, we want to talk about uh
[36:13] wisdom. Um, how many's ever wanted a
[36:17] little bit more wisdom or wish you had
[36:18] more wisdom?
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Um,
[36:23] well, um, this scripture is full of what
[36:27] wisdom really is. Um, how to get it, how
[36:31] to retain it, and what it can do for
[36:33] your lives. And we're going to do a lot
[36:35] of reading uh this morning, but it's all
[36:38] going to be out of the Bible.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's just read the one
[36:43] verse here and then we'll have a word of
[36:45] prayer. Proverbs chapter 4 verse number
[36:48] seven. Wisdom
[36:50] is the principle thing. Therefore, get
[36:53] wisdom
[36:55] and with all thy getting get
[36:56] understanding.
[36:58] Amen. Let's look to the Lord a word of
[37:00] prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, thank
[37:02] you for watching over us all and
[37:05] bringing us here safely.
[37:07] We just thank you for this building that
[37:09] we have here with heat in it and and a
[37:11] roof to protect us from the rain and the
[37:14] cold. Now, Lord, we just pray that you'd
[37:17] come in the furtherance of this service.
[37:19] We do thank you, Lord, for the
[37:21] opportunity that we've had to to worship
[37:23] you in song, to lift up your name. Lord,
[37:27] we want to continue to worship you as
[37:28] your word comes forth. Father, may it
[37:32] find a hiding place in our hearts. I
[37:35] pray Lord for every one of us that we
[37:36] could just catch a glimpse of the wisdom
[37:39] that's from above today. We commit the
[37:41] service in our lives in your hands. Now
[37:43] receive glory through each one of us. We
[37:46] pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it.
[37:48] Amen. God bless you. May be seated.
[37:54] If you look up uh that principle thing,
[37:57] wisdom is the principle thing.
[37:59] Therefore, get wisdom. The principal
[38:01] thing is the foundational truth
[38:04] that serves as a foundation for a belief
[38:07] behavior and for a chain of reasoning.
[38:11] So wisdom saying it's the principle
[38:14] thing the foundation the the most
[38:17] important and too often we don't think
[38:21] about wisdom
[38:23] enough
[38:25] &gt;&gt; as it being the foundation. It might be
[38:27] well one that we can grab here and there
[38:30] but um uh Solomon is saying it's the
[38:33] principal thing. Of course we know
[38:35] Solomon
[38:37] uh he was a man full of wisdom and he he
[38:41] wrote Proverbs and that's full of
[38:43] wisdom.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Um wisdom is separated from everything
[38:48] else. It stands alone as a principle
[38:52] thing. It will take you places that
[38:54] nothing else can take you. It'll help
[38:57] you like nothing else can help you.
[39:00] Um, and because of wisdom, we could say
[39:03] that, and I want to read this here if
[39:05] you want to turn with me to Matthew
[39:06] chapter 2. Because of the wisdom, the
[39:09] wise men recognized the word for their
[39:11] hour and followed the light to Christ.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; And God is still leading wise men to
[39:18] himself. And that's why we are all here
[39:20] because of [clears throat] we believe
[39:22] with all of our heart the word of God is
[39:25] what we need to get more of Christ.
[39:27] Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; So I just thought you know since last
[39:31] service we we talked about uh the birth
[39:34] of Christ and its purpose and and today
[39:36] we talk about the the wise men because
[39:38] they actually happened after the birth,
[39:41] right? It didn't happen at the same
[39:42] time. you you don't hardly find nativity
[39:45] scenes, very many of them uh that don't
[39:48] have the wise men included in them. Uh
[39:50] but we do know uh that it happened a
[39:53] couple years after. So we just kind of
[39:56] want to read this as a foundation here
[39:58] in Matthew chapter 2 verse one. It says,
[40:01] "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[40:04] Judea in the days of Herod the king,
[40:08] behold, there came wise men from the
[40:11] east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he
[40:15] that is born king of the Jews? For we
[40:18] have seen his star in the east, and come
[40:22] to worship him." Notice their motive
[40:26] was to come and worship. Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Really, we come to worship him.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; The first thing these wise men wanted to
[40:39] do after traveling through hardship for
[40:42] two years
[40:44] through their journey, through their
[40:46] suffering, they just wanted to worship.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, it's worth going
[40:52] through everything to come to the house
[40:54] of the Lord and worship.
[40:56] The Bible says that the father seeketh
[40:58] such that it will worship him in he's
[41:00] looking for those that are interested
[41:03] and I believe in that is wisdom.
[41:07] Verse three, when Herod the king had
[41:09] heard these things, he was troubled and
[41:12] all Jerusalem with him. What? What?
[41:14] There's a new king.
[41:16] And when he had gathered all the chief
[41:18] priests and the scribes of the people
[41:20] together, he demanded them where Christ
[41:22] should be born. And they said unto him,
[41:25] "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is
[41:27] written by the prophets, and thou
[41:29] Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not
[41:32] uh the least
[41:33] among the priests of Judah. Judah, but
[41:36] out of thee shall come a governor, that
[41:39] shall rule my people Israel." And then
[41:41] Herod, when he had privately called the
[41:43] wise men, he inquired of them
[41:44] diligently, notice what time the star
[41:48] should appear. I want to know the very
[41:51] first time you saw the star.
[41:54] That's important to understand
[41:58] exactly when these wise men came on the
[42:01] scene. And he sent them to Bethlehem and
[42:04] said, "Go and search diligently for the
[42:06] young child." He was no longer a baby,
[42:08] but a young child. And when he have
[42:11] found him, bring me word again that I
[42:13] may come and worship him also. That was
[42:15] the biggest lie. He didn't want to
[42:17] worship him.
[42:20] And when they had heard the king, they
[42:22] departed. And lo, the star which they
[42:25] saw in the east went before them till it
[42:28] came and stood over where the young
[42:32] child was. Now notice, every one of us
[42:36] at one time in our life did not know
[42:38] Christ.
[42:42] And there appeared to us a star. Now,
[42:45] the star wasn't in the sky as it was for
[42:50] these uh wise men,
[42:54] but somebody brought us the word.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Brought us the light because stars just
[43:00] reflect the light of the sun, do they
[43:02] not?
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Some, you know, I I guess have their own
[43:06] light as as they were. But what I'm
[43:08] saying is um God came and he showed us
[43:13] his word and that word led us to Christ.
[43:19] And when they saw the star, they
[43:20] rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And
[43:22] when they were come into the house, they
[43:25] saw the young child with Mary's mother
[43:27] and fowed down and worshiped him.
[43:31] Boy, they meant business. They really
[43:33] worshiped.
[43:35] And when they had opened their
[43:36] treasures, they presented unto him gifts
[43:38] of gold and frankincense and my Alls I
[43:40] can tell you is that these wise men
[43:42] really believed.
[43:45] They really believed. They came
[43:47] prepared. They brought their stuff. They
[43:49] didn't they didn't let a little snow
[43:51] bother them.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; They didn't little heat bother them.
[43:54] They didn't little little sickness
[43:56] bother them. They traveled for two years
[43:58] and they didn't GO BACK
[44:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WANTED to see this king.
[44:03] And when they came, they were prepared.
[44:05] THEY WORSHIPED HIM WITH ALL THEIR HEART
[44:07] AND THEY GAVE GIFTS.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Of course, when we come to the house of
[44:11] the Lord, we should offer the gift of
[44:13] our praise,
[44:14] &gt;&gt; the gift of our our gratitude and our
[44:16] thanksgiving.
[44:18] And being warned of God in a dream,
[44:23] they should not return to Herod, they
[44:25] departed into their own country another
[44:28] way.
[44:30] how they presented the gifts of gold,
[44:32] frankincense, and my mer. There's
[44:33] obviously great types in there. Now, I
[44:36] didn't have this, but if you could drop
[44:37] down to verse 16 for me, I'd appreciate
[44:39] it. Verse 16, because this is how we
[44:43] know how old
[44:46] uh Jesus or the baby h when the when the
[44:51] um wise men actually got there. And then
[44:54] Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by
[44:58] the wise men,
[45:01] was exceedingly rough and sent forth and
[45:04] slew all the children in Bethlehem. and
[45:07] all and in all the coast thereof from 2
[45:11] years old and under
[45:15] according to the time. Notice there it
[45:18] is again according to the time which he
[45:21] had diligent inquired of the wise men.
[45:24] In other words, when did you first see
[45:26] the star? Well, it was two years ago.
[45:31] So that's why we know it is impossible
[45:33] for those wise men to be in the nativity
[45:35] scene. [laughter]
[45:40] Micah 5:2 says, "But thou, Bethlehem,
[45:43] though thou be little among thousands of
[45:46] Judah, yet out of thee shall he come
[45:49] forth unto me, that is to be ruler in
[45:53] Israel, whose going forth have been of
[45:55] old and from everlasting." That's just a
[45:57] a a prophecy there. Now the wise men
[46:01] were magi
[46:03] but they were probably priests or
[46:06] astrologers of some sort from the east
[46:08] who recognized the star of Bethlehem.
[46:11] The scripture says there shall come a
[46:13] star out of Jacob. Now these men were
[46:17] learned men. They were scholars. They
[46:19] were gifted. They were signs or dreams
[46:22] interpreters. And they were considered
[46:24] to be wise men. These wise men were
[46:28] walking in the light. When the light
[46:31] shined on them, appeared unto them, they
[46:34] caught it. They recognized it in the
[46:36] scriptures. It was the word for their
[46:38] hour. And they walked in it, and it led
[46:40] them to where Christ was.
[46:44] Now, not all wise men are wise.
[46:48] There are other types of wise men.
[46:52] Consider the man that Pharaoh, king of
[46:54] Egypt, looked up to. The men that
[46:57] actually wi withtood Moses,
[47:00] they were considered wise men as well,
[47:03] &gt;&gt; but they were like magicians and
[47:05] sorcerers.
[47:07] They were gifted as well. They had the
[47:10] ability to use secret arts and they were
[47:14] considered the wise men uh the wisest
[47:18] that Pharaoh actually had. And we know
[47:21] that Egypt had had some smarts because
[47:25] they built the pyramids.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; And so these were the the as it were the
[47:30] those that stood there to to to give
[47:33] insight.
[47:34] And of course we know that um they were
[47:38] not really
[47:40] uh uh they weren't motivated by the
[47:44] wisdom of God even though they were wise
[47:46] men.
[47:48] And so there are two types of wisdom.
[47:50] And I want to talk about that today.
[47:52] We're living in the most evil age in
[47:54] history.
[47:56] It's the most hate. There's the most
[47:58] deception.
[48:00] If there was ever an age that you and I
[48:02] need wisdom, it's in this age.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 33:6 says, "And wisdom and
[48:08] knowledge shall be thy stability." Amen.
[48:13] Of thy times. I love that. Wisdom and
[48:15] knowledge shall be the stability of thy
[48:18] times and strength of salvation. And the
[48:20] fear of the Lord is his treasure.
[48:25] Now, most believers don't know there's
[48:27] two types of wisdom. And if they do,
[48:30] they really don't know the difference.
[48:34] There is the wisdom of God and then
[48:36] there is the wisdom of Satan.
[48:40] The wisdom from heaven and the wisdom of
[48:43] this world.
[48:45] The wisdom that's from heaven is simply
[48:49] peaceable. We sang that song, peace.
[48:52] It's gentle and it never wants to hurt
[48:55] you.
[48:57] That's the wisdom of God.
[49:00] Now, the wisdom of the world,
[49:03] well, there's fighting, there's wrath,
[49:05] there's anger, there's strife, and and
[49:07] it actually the wisdom of this world, it
[49:09] doesn't mind hurting somebody
[49:11] to get what it wants.
[49:15] So, let's remember that not all wise men
[49:17] are wise. As we're going through and
[49:20] we're describing these two,
[49:23] some wise men are absolutely fools.
[49:26] They're ignorant. They're agnostic.
[49:28] They're proud. They're despisers of
[49:30] those that are good. And they will use
[49:33] the wisdom of this world to get what
[49:37] they want.
[49:40] But it'll end up hurting somebody.
[49:43] So let's turn to James chapter 3 verse
[49:46] 13. Who is a wise man and endue with
[49:50] knowledge among you?
[49:54] So how many thinks that you're wise?
[49:58] How many feels you're due with
[49:59] knowledge?
[50:01] What you need to do is show out of a
[50:05] good conversation
[50:07] your works with meekness of wisdom.
[50:12] Meekness. Notice meekness is not
[50:14] fighting and proving and and got to get
[50:17] the point across.
[50:19] Verse 14. But if you have bitter envying
[50:23] and strife in your heart, glory not and
[50:27] lie not against the truth. This wisdom
[50:30] descendeth not from above. But it's
[50:33] earthly. It's central and it's devilish.
[50:40] For where envy and strife is, there is
[50:43] confusion and every evil work.
[50:49] Psalms 19:9 says that the fear of the
[50:51] Lord is clean. It's pure. In other
[50:54] words,
[50:56] it's pure from any kind of strife or
[51:00] fighting or or uncleanness.
[51:04] The wisdom well, we're going to read
[51:07] about it right here. Verse 17. But the
[51:09] wisdom that is from above is first pure.
[51:14] It's pure. In other words, it doesn't
[51:17] have strife. It doesn't have envy. It it
[51:20] it it doesn't uh it isn't bitter. It it
[51:24] doesn't try to uh hurt somebody.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; It's pure
[51:32] and peaceable
[51:34] and gentle
[51:36] and easy to be entreated. It's full of
[51:38] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[51:42] and without hypocrisy.
[51:45] You know, you would think that the
[51:47] wisdom of God was a lot more than that,
[51:49] wouldn't you? [laughter]
[51:50] But that's what it is.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; That's how it's on display. And the
[51:55] fruit of righteousness is sown in peace
[51:57] to them that make peace. All right. So,
[52:01] we got a lot of scriptures and I just
[52:02] want to encourage you say amen all the
[52:05] time and that'll help us because we just
[52:08] we didn't have service last um Wednesday
[52:11] and we're going to cancel this um this
[52:13] Wednesday service as well being uh New
[52:16] Year's Eve with um you know that's
[52:20] probably the most dangerous
[52:23] dangerous night to drive on.
[52:26] It is the most dangerous night to drive
[52:29] on. more accidents. It's just more
[52:31] drunks. It just So, what we want to do
[52:35] is try to get everything we can get out
[52:36] of this service. Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 34:9 says, "Oh, fear the
[52:43] Lord, ye saints,
[52:45] for there is no want to them that fear
[52:48] him. The young lions do lack and suffer
[52:51] hunger, but they that seek the Lord
[52:53] shall not want any good thing. Come ye
[52:55] children, hearken unto me, and I will
[52:57] teach you the fear of the Lord. What
[53:00] make he that uh what what man is he that
[53:04] desireth life, and loveth many days,
[53:08] that he should see good?
[53:11] Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips
[53:13] from speaking. Gile, depart from evil,
[53:16] and do good. Seek peace and pursuit.
[53:18] What you can see here is there's the the
[53:22] instruction here of of of David to not
[53:25] use worldly wisdom to get what you want,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; but rather fear the Lord.
[53:35] This is how you get what you need. The
[53:39] wisdom of God is always humble.
[53:44] Not at times
[53:47] Not can be but it is always humble.
[53:53] The wisdom of God.
[53:58] It's not filled with pride. The wisdom
[54:01] of the world is.
[54:03] How could the wisdom of God be ignorant
[54:07] and proud if God despises
[54:11] those that are proud? He even hates a a
[54:14] proud look.
[54:16] So there is no wisdom of God when
[54:18] there's a proud spirit.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 9:10 says, "The fear of the
[54:24] Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and the knowledge of the holy is
[54:30] understanding." The fear of the Lord,
[54:33] it's the beginning of wisdom. Now, um,
[54:37] this fear, it's it's a reverence. It's a
[54:41] deep respect, a feeling of awe and
[54:43] adoration. It's a humble recognition of
[54:46] the divine sacred presence of God's word
[54:50] being first.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you put God's words
[54:56] first in your life
[55:00] that it is when wisdom, the wisdom of
[55:03] God will begin to work in your life.
[55:07] It's hard to have the wisdom of God if
[55:12] you don't respect the word of God.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Then if if you don't respect the word of
[55:18] God, all you got to do is try to live by
[55:21] the wisdom of the world. I mean, there's
[55:24] wisdom in it,
[55:26] but it's only going to take you so far.
[55:29] And eventually, the wisdom of God will
[55:31] confound the wisdom of the world.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; That's just scriptural. So, we got a lot
[55:36] of scriptures we're going to go through.
[55:37] In Proverbs 15:33, the fear of the Lord,
[55:42] which is the beginning of the wisdom is
[55:44] the instruction
[55:46] of wisdom.
[55:48] And before honor is what? Humility.
[55:52] You're not going to get anywhere without
[55:55] humility.
[55:57] Proverbs 22:4, "By humility and the fear
[56:01] of the Lord are riches and honor and
[56:06] life." Now, how many people go after
[56:08] riches, honor, and life without humility
[56:12] and the fear of God? See, they use the
[56:15] wisdom of the world to do it.
[56:19] Brother Brandon would go on to break
[56:21] down what what the fear of the Lord was
[56:23] for us. And he would say things like, "I
[56:26] could be wrong about how I'm looking at
[56:29] this situation.
[56:30] I I could be wrong. I I I should
[56:33] reconsider the He would say, "The Bible
[56:36] is the absolute,
[56:38] &gt;&gt; not the way I look at it." He said, 'I'd
[56:40] rather have the right spirit and be
[56:42] wrong in my doctrine than to BE SO RIGHT
[56:45] WITH MY DOCTRINE, and I know it, but my
[56:47] spirit is wrong.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; The fear of the Lord is always humble. I
[56:54] could be wrong.
[56:58] Proverbs 1:7, the fear of the Lord is
[57:01] the beginning of knowledge, but fools
[57:04] despise wisdom, instruction. Notice
[57:07] there is that spirit that doesn't
[57:11] respect the word of God.
[57:14] It it it it feels that it knows more
[57:17] than what the Bible says. And the Bible
[57:20] is calling them fools.
[57:23] It's it's really much much easier to use
[57:26] the wisdom of the world to manipulate
[57:29] somebody.
[57:31] It's easier to achieve your agenda
[57:34] without reverencing God's word or the
[57:37] way that God does things. But it will
[57:40] always end up with division, isms,
[57:43] schisms, resentment, confusion, strife,
[57:47] envy. It'll finally lead you to death,
[57:50] the wisdom of the world. There is a way
[57:52] that seemth right unto man, but the end
[57:55] thereof are the ways of death.
[57:58] So it isn't about what we think. We need
[58:02] to stay with the word of God.
[58:04] Proverbs 23:17 says, "Let not thy heart
[58:09] envy sinners,
[58:11] but be thou in the fear of the Lord."
[58:15] Notice this. Well, I got this scripture
[58:18] because it says all the day long.
[58:23] It it's we if we can fear the Lord 100%
[58:27] of the time it's on the forefront well
[58:29] pride won't ever come into our life.
[58:33] But as soon as we we leave the
[58:37] reverencing of the word of God then
[58:40] pride can step in.
[58:43] Now the wisdom of God will take you
[58:45] places that the wisdom of this world
[58:48] doesn't even know how to get there.
[58:51] It'll change your life forever. That's
[58:54] what the wisdom of God will do.
[58:57] Proverbs 10:27, "For the fear of the
[59:00] Lord prolongth days."
[59:04] prolongth days,
[59:06] but the years of the wicked shall be
[59:08] shortened. There's no Look at this.
[59:11] There's no Here's the middle,
[59:15] you know? Here's the middle. It's like
[59:17] you fear the Lord, you're going to live
[59:19] longer.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You respect mom and dad, you're
[59:21] going to live longer.
[59:23] You You don't fear the Lord, your days
[59:26] are being shortened.
[59:30] Proverbs 14:26.
[59:33] In the fear of the Lord is strong
[59:36] confidence, and his children shall have
[59:40] a place of refuge. Verse 27, the fear of
[59:43] the Lord is a fountain of life to depart
[59:46] from the snare of death. So the fear of
[59:50] the Lord is a necessary thing for your
[59:53] life. Proverbs 15:16 says, "It's better
[59:56] is a little with the fear of the Lord
[59:59] than great treasures and trouble
[1:00:02] therewith." So there's, you know, the
[1:00:05] the the the thing is everybody wants to
[1:00:07] be rich, right? Everybody wants more,
[1:00:12] but nobody thinks about the fear of the
[1:00:14] Lord.
[1:00:15] And if we just get the fear of the Lord,
[1:00:18] it's the beginning of wisdom. And I'll
[1:00:19] tell you, it's going to not only get you
[1:00:21] riches, but it's going to get you a lot.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16 verse 6, by mercy and truth
[1:00:30] is iniquity purged.
[1:00:33] He's saying white as snow.
[1:00:35] And by the fear of the Lord, men depart
[1:00:40] from evil. How important it is to have
[1:00:43] the fear of the Lord.
[1:00:45] When a man's ways, verse seven, please
[1:00:47] the Lord,
[1:00:49] he maketh even his enemies to be at
[1:00:51] peace with him. What a promise.
[1:00:55] You know, you you you you see uh there
[1:00:58] are are people that seems like they got
[1:01:00] problems with everybody.
[1:01:02] And then you see you've got people that
[1:01:05] they just don't seem to have problems
[1:01:06] with everybody. Well, what what is that?
[1:01:10] I mean, to me, the wisdom of God,
[1:01:14] it's it's pure. It it's gentle. It's
[1:01:18] it's peaceable.
[1:01:20] It it it it doesn't try to take
[1:01:23] advantage. It tries to serve. It gives.
[1:01:27] And when you got the spirit of God, um
[1:01:31] you're you're going to be at peace with
[1:01:33] others.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; And I think this is a promise for for
[1:01:37] our lives. Amen. All right, Proverbs
[1:01:40] chapter 8.
[1:01:42] Now, some of you have been falling
[1:01:44] behind on the amens.
[1:01:47] I just I'm up here grading you right now
[1:01:50] and um
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; because we're I figured we'd go through
[1:01:54] like a midterm test so we can like ace
[1:01:57] it at the end.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Okay, Proverbs 8. We're going to read
[1:02:02] this entire chapter.
[1:02:04] I love this chapter. I mean, if if if
[1:02:07] wisdom is important to you, you'll
[1:02:09] you'll you'll love this word because I
[1:02:11] could tell you my thoughts, but I really
[1:02:15] love what the word of God tells me
[1:02:16] because it's the truth. It says, "Does
[1:02:19] not wisdom cry and understanding put
[1:02:22] forth her voice?" So, this whole chapter
[1:02:24] is wisdom speaking. She standeth in the
[1:02:28] top of high places,
[1:02:30] by the way, in the places of the path.
[1:02:35] She crith at the gates and at the entry
[1:02:37] of the city and the coming in at the
[1:02:38] doors. Unto you, oh men, I call, and my
[1:02:43] voice is to the sons of men. Oh ye
[1:02:46] simple,
[1:02:48] understand wisdom, and you fools, be ye
[1:02:51] of an understanding heart.
[1:02:54] Hear, for I will speak of excellent
[1:02:56] things, and the opening of my lips shall
[1:02:59] be right things. He's just speaking of
[1:03:01] what wisdom does. For my mouth shall
[1:03:03] speak truth, and wickedness is an
[1:03:06] abomination for my lips. In other words,
[1:03:08] it's not wisdom that would speak um
[1:03:11] about wrong things. Amen. All the words
[1:03:15] of my mouth are righteous. There is
[1:03:17] nothing forward. There's nothing
[1:03:19] perverse in them.
[1:03:21] They all they are all plain to him that
[1:03:25] understandeth and right to them that
[1:03:27] find knowledge. Receive my instructions,
[1:03:31] not silver, and knowledge rather than
[1:03:33] choice gold. For wisdom is better than
[1:03:37] rubies.
[1:03:39] And all the things that may be desired
[1:03:43] cannot be compared to wisdom.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; It's the principle thing.
[1:03:54] I wisdom dwell with prudence.
[1:04:00] I see some humility there, don't you?
[1:04:03] And find out knowledge of witty
[1:04:05] inventions.
[1:04:07] The fear of the Lord is to hate evil,
[1:04:12] to hate pride,
[1:04:15] to hate arrogancy.
[1:04:18] That's what the fear of the Lord is.
[1:04:20] It's to hate those things and the evil
[1:04:23] way and the froward mouth do I hate. So
[1:04:26] in other words, wisdom, the spirit of
[1:04:28] wisdom hates the spirit of pride.
[1:04:33] Hates it.
[1:04:36] So just because you can act bigger than
[1:04:39] me, it doesn't mean anything. [laughter]
[1:04:44] It would be better. You know, brother
[1:04:46] Brandon says takes a big man to get
[1:04:47] underneath another another man.
[1:04:53] So wisdom is saying counsel is mine and
[1:04:57] sound wisdom. I am understanding. I have
[1:05:01] strength. So there's understanding and
[1:05:02] wisdom. There's there's there's strength
[1:05:04] and wisdom. By me the kings reign reign
[1:05:08] and princes decree justice. By me, by
[1:05:12] wisdom, princes, ruin, nobles, even all
[1:05:14] the judges of the earth. I love them
[1:05:16] that love me, and those that seek me
[1:05:19] early shall find me. The wisdom of God
[1:05:21] loves those that love wisdom,
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; and those that seek me early shall find
[1:05:27] me. What that means is to seek
[1:05:29] earnestly. If you look it up, it means
[1:05:32] painstaking
[1:05:34] effort. That's what the rich ug uh not
[1:05:37] the rich young I'm sorry the wise men
[1:05:39] what they did is they put forth effort
[1:05:43] painstaking effort to get to to get to
[1:05:46] Jesus.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes if things aren't easy
[1:05:50] we we we just we we can't even make
[1:05:52] effort to get to church. We can't make
[1:05:54] effort to read a Bible. We can't make
[1:05:56] effort to pray.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; It's not wisdom.
[1:06:03] Riches and honor are with me, durable
[1:06:06] riches and righteousness. My fruit is
[1:06:09] better than gold, yay, than fine gold,
[1:06:12] and my revenue than choice silver.
[1:06:15] I wisdom lead in the way of
[1:06:17] righteousness in the midst of the paths
[1:06:19] of judgment, that I may cause those that
[1:06:22] love me to inherit substance, and I will
[1:06:25] fill their treasures. I just think about
[1:06:28] Solomon.
[1:06:30] The Lord possessed me in the beginning
[1:06:32] of his way before the works of M. In
[1:06:36] other words, now we're going to get into
[1:06:39] where wisdom was at the beginning when
[1:06:42] when God created everything.
[1:06:48] The Lord possessed me in the beginning
[1:06:50] of his way before the works of old. I
[1:06:51] was set up from everlasting, from the
[1:06:53] beginning orever the earth was. When
[1:06:57] there was no depths, I was brought
[1:06:59] forth. When there was no fountains
[1:07:01] abound uh uh abounding with water,
[1:07:04] before the mountains were settled,
[1:07:05] before the hills was I brought forth.
[1:07:09] While yet he had not made the earth, nor
[1:07:12] the fields, nor the highest parts of the
[1:07:14] dust of the world. When he prepared the
[1:07:16] heavens, I was there. When he set a
[1:07:19] compass upon the face of the depth, when
[1:07:21] he established the clouds above, when he
[1:07:22] strengthened the the fountains of the
[1:07:24] deep. When he gave to the sea his decree
[1:07:27] and the waters should not pass his
[1:07:30] commandment. When he appointed the
[1:07:32] foundations of the earth, then I was by
[1:07:35] him as one brought up with him. I was
[1:07:39] daily his delight, rejoicing always
[1:07:41] before him, rejoicing in the habitant
[1:07:44] parts of the earth, and my delights were
[1:07:47] with the sons of men. Now therefore
[1:07:48] hearken unto me, oh children, for
[1:07:50] blessed are they that keep my ways.
[1:07:59] Hear instruction and be wise. Hear
[1:08:02] instruction and be wise and refuse it
[1:08:04] not. Blessed is the man that heareth me,
[1:08:07] watches daily at my gates, waitth at the
[1:08:09] pulse of my doors. Who for whosoever
[1:08:12] findeth me findeth life, and shall
[1:08:14] obtain favor in the Lord.
[1:08:18] that he that sinnth against me wrong,
[1:08:21] his own soul, and all they that hate me
[1:08:24] love death.
[1:08:26] No one would ever say, "I love death."
[1:08:30] But by default, right? by default when
[1:08:34] you don't love the word of God. Amen.
[1:08:38] Proverbs 19:23 says, "For the fear of
[1:08:41] the Lord tendeth to life,
[1:08:45] and he that have it shall abide
[1:08:47] satisfied. He shall not be visited with
[1:08:52] evil."
[1:08:54] Wow. It just seems like God holds back
[1:08:57] great blessings for those who find
[1:09:01] wisdom.
[1:09:03] Amen. Now, we don't have time because we
[1:09:06] don't have time to the whole book is
[1:09:08] wisdom.
[1:09:10] But 1 Corinthians chapter 12 mentions
[1:09:12] that one of the spiritual gifts is the
[1:09:14] word of wisdom.
[1:09:17] And uh it may be described as a
[1:09:20] supernatural insight from the Holy
[1:09:22] Spirit enabling a believer to apply
[1:09:26] divine knowledge to a specific
[1:09:28] situation, solve problems, offer godly
[1:09:31] counsel, guide others toward God's will,
[1:09:35] often involving revelation about God's
[1:09:39] purpose or future events,
[1:09:42] distinct from worldly wisdom or mere
[1:09:46] knowledge.
[1:09:48] So,
[1:09:50] um, I just want to make this real clear
[1:09:54] that this morning we are not speaking of
[1:09:56] the gift of the word of wisdom
[1:10:00] because gifts and callings are without
[1:10:03] repentance and God just gives those to
[1:10:06] whoever he gives them to.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; But we're speaking of a wisdom that we
[1:10:11] all can attain.
[1:10:14] The gift of wisdom is not given to
[1:10:17] everyone. I wish it was. You know, we'd
[1:10:19] have less problems.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; But God promises wisdom to anyone.
[1:10:25] Why wouldn't he? The wisdom of God will
[1:10:27] always direct us to him.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; True north. All right. James 1:5 says,
[1:10:35] "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
[1:10:39] of God that giveth to all men liberally
[1:10:44] and upgrade not." In other words, he's
[1:10:46] no respector of persons, and it shall be
[1:10:50] given him.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; What a promise.
[1:10:55] Now, just because God is willing to give
[1:10:57] wisdom to anyone, uh that doesn't mean
[1:11:01] there's not requirements. There are
[1:11:03] there are requirements. It it it's you
[1:11:06] got to meet the requirements. When
[1:11:08] Solomon asked for wisdom, God looked at
[1:11:12] his pure motive.
[1:11:15] His motive is that he wanted to help
[1:11:19] God's people follow God.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; I I I need wisdom that I may go in and
[1:11:26] out amongst thy people. How I need to
[1:11:28] help them to you. If I'm gonna be king,
[1:11:31] I need something that's going to help
[1:11:34] your people uh follow the right way
[1:11:38] because how will I know?
[1:11:41] And that TOUCHED GOD SO MUCH.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; It touched his heart so much.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Because his motive, not because he asked
[1:11:51] for wisdom, BUT HIS MOTIVE FOR WISDOM,
[1:11:54] IT WASN'T SELFISH. IT WASN'T SO, YOU
[1:11:57] KNOW, I WANT WISDOM SO I could get
[1:11:58] riches. I want wisdom so I CAN HAVE
[1:12:00] ANOTHER HOUSE. I WANT WISDOM SO I CAN
[1:12:02] HAVE ANOTHER CAR.
[1:12:04] I want wisdom to help your people
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; that touch God. He said because you
[1:12:09] asked for that I'll give you that and so
[1:12:12] much more. Amen.
[1:12:15] So motive is important. So the number
[1:12:18] one we must reverence God in order to
[1:12:22] get I want to say this is number one.
[1:12:26] We must reverence this word of God if we
[1:12:30] want wisdom
[1:12:33] because there's no way that God is ever
[1:12:35] going to give you the wisdom of of
[1:12:39] heaven if you don't love his word.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; You you got to put the word first.
[1:12:48] For the fear of the Lord is the
[1:12:51] beginning of wisdom. In other words, you
[1:12:55] put this Bible above your whole life,
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; above your goals, above your plans,
[1:13:02] above what you want to do. You put the
[1:13:05] word above that.
[1:13:07] And that now becomes the beginning of
[1:13:10] you getting wisdom from above.
[1:13:14] So, we must respect the word of God. And
[1:13:17] I don't say just part of the word, but
[1:13:20] every word. For Jesus said, "Man shall
[1:13:22] not live by bread alone, but by every
[1:13:24] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:13:26] God." We're going to be judged by the
[1:13:28] word. Wisdom is the word of God.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; So number one, respect God's word if you
[1:13:36] want the wisdom of God. And the moment
[1:13:38] that you don't respect God's word is the
[1:13:41] moment that God will confound you.
[1:13:45] And I just I just want to go back and
[1:13:47] look. This same thing happened to
[1:13:49] Lucifer in Ezekiel chapter 28. Ezekiel
[1:13:54] 28 verse 12. It says, "Son of man, take
[1:13:58] up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus,
[1:14:01] and say unto him, thus sayeth the Lord
[1:14:04] God,
[1:14:06] um, thou sealest up the Sum, now notice
[1:14:10] this, full of wisdom
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; and perfect in beauty."
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So at one time, Lucifer
[1:14:18] was full of wisdom.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Now, he was full of the wisdom of God.
[1:14:27] And he said that thou has been in Eden,
[1:14:30] the garden of God. Well, we know that
[1:14:32] was Lucifer, the the beast. Every
[1:14:35] precious stone was thy covering. The
[1:14:37] Sardis, topz, diamond, burl, onyx,
[1:14:39] jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle,
[1:14:43] and gold. And the workmanship of thy
[1:14:45] tablets and of thy pipes were prepared
[1:14:48] in thee in the day that thou was
[1:14:50] created. Everything God does, he does
[1:14:53] good.
[1:14:55] says, "Thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:14:58] coverth, and I have set thee so. Thou
[1:15:02] was upon the holy mountain of God. Thou
[1:15:05] has walked up and down in the midst of
[1:15:07] the stones of fire, and thou was perfect
[1:15:11] in all thy ways from the day that thou
[1:15:14] was created till
[1:15:19] iniquity."
[1:15:23] Brother Brandham said iniquity was I
[1:15:26] don't need to do that.
[1:15:29] I don't need to do that
[1:15:32] until I don't need to do that was found
[1:15:34] in him.
[1:15:37] It's simple.
[1:15:39] I don't need to worship. I don't need to
[1:15:42] praise anymore.
[1:15:45] I don't need to put my heart in praising
[1:15:47] God.
[1:15:49] That's what happened to Lucifer. began
[1:15:51] to just sit back,
[1:15:54] kind of contemplate, you know what?
[1:15:57] I think I want to be my own God. I think
[1:16:00] I want to do things my way.
[1:16:04] Now, notice this in verse 16
[1:16:08] tells a big story here. By the multitude
[1:16:10] of thy merchandise,
[1:16:12] they have filled the midst of thee with
[1:16:14] violence, and thou has sinned.
[1:16:18] Therefore, I will cast thee as the prof
[1:16:21] as profane out of the mountain of God,
[1:16:23] and I will destroy thee, o covering
[1:16:25] cherubin from the midst of the stones of
[1:16:27] fire.
[1:16:29] Now notice, Satan became a salesman,
[1:16:36] a peddler, a dealer, a seller of his
[1:16:40] merchandise.
[1:16:42] by the multitude of thy merchandise.
[1:16:45] They have filled the midst of thee with
[1:16:49] violence. Notice his wisdom now was was
[1:16:53] was producing strife, anger.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; He was telling the other angels, you
[1:16:59] really don't have to listen to God.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; And I'm tell I'm telling you, uh Lucifer
[1:17:05] did not just go to a third of the angels
[1:17:07] that would follow him.
[1:17:10] He went to the other twothirds to try to
[1:17:12] get them.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; But there was a fight. There was a fight
[1:17:16] in heaven. There was that battle going
[1:17:18] on. But he was using his wisdom.
[1:17:22] His wisdom that says you don't have to
[1:17:23] go God's way. You can have your own
[1:17:26] will. You don't have to listen to him
[1:17:28] all day long. How would you like to go
[1:17:30] have a life and do what you want to do?
[1:17:35] See, he's a pedler.
[1:17:37] He was pedalling. He was he was a
[1:17:40] manipulator.
[1:17:42] He was just a salesman.
[1:17:49] And look what happened.
[1:17:52] Look what his wisdom calls to happen. He
[1:17:56] had the wisdom of God until he said, "I
[1:17:59] don't need to to do it anymore."
[1:18:02] The only thing he could live by was the
[1:18:04] wisdom of
[1:18:06] uh we call it now the wisdom of the
[1:18:09] world, but it was the wisdom of Satan.
[1:18:12] And it literally destroyed him. He got
[1:18:14] kicked out of heaven.
[1:18:18] And he's going to be annihilated one
[1:18:21] day. Verse 17, thy heart was lifted up
[1:18:26] because of thy beauty.
[1:18:30] Thou has corrupted, look thy wisdom that
[1:18:32] I gave you.
[1:18:35] Thou has corrupted thy wisdom by a
[1:18:38] reason of thy brightness.
[1:18:42] God gives me wisdom.
[1:18:45] But the moment I think I'm something, it
[1:18:48] corrupts me.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; My brightness.
[1:18:54] That's why wisdom is always humble.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Always. Not part-time. Not once in a
[1:19:00] while, not in front of others, but it's
[1:19:02] just humble all the time.
[1:19:06] I will cast thee to the ground. I will
[1:19:10] lay thee before kings that they may
[1:19:12] behold thee. Now, notice this. What
[1:19:15] happens when we decide that we don't
[1:19:18] need the wisdom of God? I'm telling you,
[1:19:20] there's coming hard things, hard things
[1:19:23] in your life. Thou has defiled thy
[1:19:27] sanctuaries by the multitude of you
[1:19:31] don't have to do this. You don't have to
[1:19:32] do that. You don't you don't you don't
[1:19:34] need this. You don't need to do that.
[1:19:38] You know, we got churches. We got so
[1:19:39] many churches out there to fit your
[1:19:42] belief.
[1:19:45] What we want is we just want a church
[1:19:47] that believes the whole word of God
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; from cover to cover. That's what we're
[1:19:51] looking for.
[1:19:53] But the churches are just full of it.
[1:19:58] And by the iniquity of thy traffic,
[1:20:00] therefore I bring forth a fire from the
[1:20:03] midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and
[1:20:04] I will bring thee to ashes upon the
[1:20:06] earth in the sight of all them that
[1:20:08] behold thee. Notice, one day they're
[1:20:09] going to look upon him and say, "Is this
[1:20:11] the man
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; who did all this to the world? Who who
[1:20:15] weakened the nations?"
[1:20:18] So the moment that we lose respect for
[1:20:20] God's word is the moment that God is
[1:20:22] going to confound us.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Colossians 2:3 says, "In Christ are hid
[1:20:29] all the treasures of wisdom and
[1:20:33] knowledge." In Christ are hid all the
[1:20:36] treasures of wisdom and knowledge. So
[1:20:39] number one, respect God's word if you
[1:20:41] want the wisdom of God and keep
[1:20:44] respecting God's word.
[1:20:47] must. Number two, when you seek wisdom,
[1:20:51] you have to believe that you're going to
[1:20:52] get it.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; You can't be wishy-washy about it. So,
[1:20:56] let's continue on in James chapter one.
[1:21:00] So, if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask
[1:21:02] of God in verse 6. But let him ask
[1:21:06] in faith,
[1:21:08] nothing wavering. For he that waverth
[1:21:12] uh waverth is like a wave of the sea
[1:21:15] driven by the wind and is tossed.
[1:21:19] For let not that man think he shall
[1:21:20] receive anything
[1:21:23] of the Lord.
[1:21:25] A double-minded man is unstable in all
[1:21:30] his ways.
[1:21:32] So God would, you know, he he's saying,
[1:21:34] "I'd rather have you hot or cold." And
[1:21:36] and if you want to be hot, you want
[1:21:38] wisdom, believe you're going to get it.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; You know, get get serious. You come to
[1:21:42] church, believe it. All right. Kind of
[1:21:45] our opening scripture here. Proverbs
[1:21:47] chapter 4 verse number five. Get wisdom,
[1:21:52] get understanding,
[1:21:54] forget it not, neither decline from the
[1:21:57] words of my mouth.
[1:22:00] Forsake her not,
[1:22:03] and she shall preserve thee.
[1:22:05] Love her and she shall keep thee.
[1:22:10] Wisdom is the principle thing. Therefore
[1:22:13] get wisdom and with all thy getting get
[1:22:16] understanding. Exalt her
[1:22:20] and she shall promote thee. She shall
[1:22:23] bring thee to honor when thou does
[1:22:26] embrace her.
[1:22:29] She shall give to thy head an ornament
[1:22:31] of grace and a crown of glory shall she
[1:22:34] deliver to thee. The wisdom of God will
[1:22:39] keep leading you to reverence more of
[1:22:42] the word of God
[1:22:44] to know God in a greater way. It will
[1:22:47] actually cause you to hunger and thirst
[1:22:50] more for God. And we have that example
[1:22:52] in Paul. After 33 years, he was still
[1:22:55] seeking to be more like God.
[1:22:59] more in his image and more in his
[1:23:02] likeness.
[1:23:04] And I I'll say to our youth, and I know
[1:23:06] that we don't have all of our youth
[1:23:07] here, but we have we have a couple youth
[1:23:09] here. And so I'm speak to the couple the
[1:23:13] youth that we do have. When Jesus was 12
[1:23:17] years old, he was in the temple with the
[1:23:20] doctors of divinity and and and
[1:23:22] theology. And when he sat there, he
[1:23:25] heard they that heard Jesus were
[1:23:28] astonished at what he did say and the
[1:23:31] answers that he gave.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And in Luke 2 verse 52 says, "And Jesus
[1:23:38] increased in wisdom and stature and
[1:23:43] found favor with God and man." So that
[1:23:46] tells me that we can have wisdom at any
[1:23:49] age. Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And I'll say, you know, try to bypass,
[1:23:54] you know, getting worldly wisdom and
[1:23:56] doing it yourself. Go after the wisdom
[1:23:58] of God. You I've never found a person
[1:24:00] that had the wisdom of God that ever
[1:24:02] said to me, "You know what? I really
[1:24:03] didn't need that. That was a waste of
[1:24:05] time."
[1:24:08] Colossians 4:5 says, "Walk in wisdom
[1:24:13] toward them that are without wisdom,
[1:24:16] redeeming the time. Let your speech be
[1:24:18] always noticed with grace,
[1:24:22] seasoned with salt, that you may know
[1:24:24] how you ought to answer every man. In
[1:24:26] other words, not with envy, not with
[1:24:29] strife, not trying to prove that
[1:24:30] somebody did something wrong, you know,
[1:24:32] trying to hang them out, try to make
[1:24:34] them look bad. That is not the wisdom of
[1:24:37] God.
[1:24:42] Colossians 3:14, "And above all these
[1:24:45] things, put on charity, which is the
[1:24:46] bond of perfectness, perfectness.
[1:24:49] And let the peace of God rule in your
[1:24:51] heart, to which also ye are called in
[1:24:54] one body, and be ye thankful, and let
[1:24:56] the word of Christ dwell in you richly
[1:24:58] in all wisdom."
[1:25:02] You ever see somebody use the word of
[1:25:04] God to cut you?
[1:25:10] They didn't speak it in love.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; If I was to speak the truth in love.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:25:18] it's like they want to use the word to
[1:25:20] hurt you. That's the same thing Satan
[1:25:21] does,
[1:25:24] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:25:26] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[1:25:28] singing with grace in your heart to the
[1:25:30] Lord.
[1:25:33] Paul speaking to the Ephesian church
[1:25:37] when he remembered to to pray for them.
[1:25:39] He would say here in Ephesians 1 chapter
[1:25:42] 1 verse1 17 that the God of our Lord
[1:25:45] Jesus Christ the father of glory may
[1:25:48] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:25:52] revelation in the knowledge of him. I
[1:25:54] think that's something that we should
[1:25:56] pray one for another for. Don't you? the
[1:25:59] the spirit of wisdom.
[1:26:02] And when God shines, I'll say this every
[1:26:07] time we come to church, God is
[1:26:09] presenting his word to us.
[1:26:14] And wisdom is to receive it.
[1:26:17] That word shines in our pathway. And if
[1:26:21] we receive it,
[1:26:23] that is wisdom.
[1:26:26] Sometimes we want wisdom. how to help us
[1:26:28] in situations, right? Well, I wish I
[1:26:31] knew how to handle this because, you
[1:26:33] know, my boss is doing this or my
[1:26:35] husband's doing this, my wife's doing
[1:26:36] this, my kids are doing this. I wish I
[1:26:38] just had wish I had wisdom to deal with
[1:26:40] this. Well, the way to get that wisdom
[1:26:43] is when you come to church and you hear
[1:26:44] the word of God that has nothing to do
[1:26:46] with your situation. YOU SAY, "LORD, I
[1:26:48] RECEIVE THAT FROM my life."
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And you grow in wisdom.
[1:26:54] And then when you need it, it's there.
[1:26:58] The word of God
[1:27:01] is the light for our lives.
[1:27:04] Psalms 119:105, we quote this
[1:27:08] periodically. The word is a lamp unto my
[1:27:11] feet and a light to my path. So, we need
[1:27:16] to take the word into our life and say,
[1:27:19] I'm going to accept that for me and my
[1:27:20] house will serve the Lord. I want to
[1:27:23] read this. Put this up there. Proverbs
[1:27:25] chapter 6 verse 23. I've never seen it
[1:27:28] quite like this because a lot of people
[1:27:31] they don't recognize
[1:27:34] uh that the commandment says for the
[1:27:37] commandment is a lamp. The word of God
[1:27:40] is a lamp. The commandment I command you
[1:27:43] to do this. That's a lamp.
[1:27:46] The law is a light
[1:27:49] and reproofs of instruction are the way
[1:27:53] of life.
[1:27:55] Wisdom is the principle thing.
[1:27:58] Therefore, get wisdom and with all thy
[1:28:00] getting, get understanding. Let's stand
[1:28:02] together. God bless you.
[1:28:06] Now, I will say this. If you would have
[1:28:08] said, "Amen." You know, more you
[1:28:11] wouldn't have been so tired.
[1:28:15] I'm saying that's just wisdom to me.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:28] Let's sing. Teach me to number our
[1:28:32] my days. Our days. That's wisdom, is it
[1:28:36] not?
[1:28:43] Teach us to number
[1:28:47] our day.
[1:28:51] Oh, teach us to number our days
[1:28:58] that
[1:29:01] I our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach
[1:29:07] us to number our days.
[1:29:14] Teach us to number our days.
[1:29:22] Teach us to number our days
[1:29:28] that we may apply
[1:29:32] our hearts on [music] to wisdom. Lord,
[1:29:36] teach us to number [singing]
[1:29:39] our days.
[1:29:42] [music]
[1:29:43] Oh, teach us to number our days.
[1:29:51] Teach us to number our days.
[1:29:57] [singing]
[1:29:58] We may apply
[1:30:01] our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us
[1:30:07] to number our days.
[1:30:12] Amen.
[1:30:14] We only got so I remember as a child
[1:30:21] I don't think I was quite serving the
[1:30:23] Lord yet, but I the Lord was probably
[1:30:25] dealing with me.
[1:30:29] And I was looking at my dad's life from
[1:30:32] just like out of the box
[1:30:35] because sometimes when you're in the
[1:30:36] box, you can't quite see everything
[1:30:38] right. I remember looking at my brother
[1:30:41] and his life out of the box
[1:30:45] and they were dealing with things that I
[1:30:48] know that they dealt with a number of
[1:30:50] times in life and then they were dealing
[1:30:53] with them again. And I just remember
[1:30:55] having this thought, I do not want to go
[1:30:59] this long in life before I learned.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And I don't know where that thought just
[1:31:04] came. And it's like my heart just made a
[1:31:07] decision.
[1:31:09] I I don't got I only got so many days to
[1:31:11] live.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; If you're going to get anywhere in life,
[1:31:14] you need to learn things and you need to
[1:31:15] grow.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; So teach us to number our days. Amen.
[1:31:22] Let's sing. Let me be a shining light.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Let me be a shining light,
[1:31:33] oh Lord.
[1:31:36] As the world around me darken,
[1:31:41] let me be a shining light.
[1:31:45] Oh Lord,
[1:31:47] give me strength for each new day.
[1:31:52] My faith is found a resting place.
[1:31:56] Oh Lord,
[1:31:59] it is in your precious word.
[1:32:04] My faith has found a resting place.
[1:32:08] Oh Lord,
[1:32:10] may that anchor always hold.
[1:32:16] Be a shining light.
[1:32:19] Oh Lord.
[1:32:22] As the world around me darken,
[1:32:27] let me be a shining light.
[1:32:31] Oh Lord,
[1:32:33] give me strength for each new day.
[1:32:37] [singing]
[1:32:38] My faith has found a resting place.
[1:32:42] Oh Lord,
[1:32:45] it is in your precious word.
[1:32:50] My faith has found a resting place,
[1:32:54] oh Lord.
[1:32:56] May that anchor always hold.
[1:33:00] [singing]
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire?
[1:33:06] Amen. Let's just look to the Lord in a
[1:33:08] word of prayer. If we just bow our our
[1:33:11] heads and close our eyes, maybe there'd
[1:33:14] be someone here today that would say,
[1:33:15] "Brother John, would you pray for me
[1:33:17] that I that I could grow in the wisdom
[1:33:20] of God?" You want to be remembered in
[1:33:22] prayer? Amen. Bless these hands. Bless
[1:33:25] these hearts. Amen. Amen. My hand is up.
[1:33:29] Remember me as I pray for you. Our
[1:33:32] heavenly father, Lord, we just bow
[1:33:34] before you in humbleness of heart,
[1:33:38] realizing that all wisdom comes from
[1:33:41] you,
[1:33:43] Lord. And we submit our lives to you,
[1:33:46] Lord. We we want to uh consecrate our
[1:33:50] life to you coming into the new year.
[1:33:52] And Lord, we all uh desire more wisdom
[1:33:58] from above. pray that you would fill us
[1:34:01] with that peaceable, gentle, loving uh
[1:34:05] wisdom that's from above and and help
[1:34:08] one another, Lord, to find you. And
[1:34:12] Lord, when we see our our brothers and
[1:34:14] our sister sisters overtaken and a
[1:34:17] fault, help us to restore them, Lord, to
[1:34:21] use use thy word to to help them to to
[1:34:25] the place that they need to be. Father,
[1:34:27] I pray that you take away uh Lord every
[1:34:31] every ounce of uh pride or uh anything
[1:34:34] that would be of the wisdom of this
[1:34:37] world. Just take it from us, Lord. We
[1:34:39] want to operate by the wisdom from
[1:34:42] above.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, bless thy people, Lord, and and
[1:34:47] give them the very desires of their
[1:34:48] heart. May they begin to see you
[1:34:51] manifested in ways in their life that
[1:34:54] they haven't seen before. And Lord,
[1:34:56] those that Lord have been walking and in
[1:34:59] the in wisdom, Lord, I pray that they
[1:35:01] would begin to see it more manifested in
[1:35:04] their life. And Lord, uh we know that
[1:35:07] your elect in this age will not be
[1:35:10] deceived.
[1:35:12] Lord, you said that it's the only group
[1:35:14] of people that won't be deceived. And I
[1:35:17] pray, Lord, that you just fill us all
[1:35:19] with wisdom. We love you. We thank you
[1:35:22] for these things today in Jesus Christ's
[1:35:24] precious name.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. Shine Jesus. Shine.
[1:35:31] You can't do it. Can't do that one.
[1:35:40] Look. Why? Why can't we do it? Why can't
[1:35:44] we do it?
[1:35:47] Let's try to do it.
[1:35:49] Let's just do our best.
[1:35:53] What do we need to do to do it?
[1:35:57] Oh, to practice. Okay, we'll give you to
[1:36:00] next service, honey.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Let's sing a Jesus, the
[1:36:06] light of the world. Amen. We want to
[1:36:08] walk in the light.
[1:36:19] Amen.
[1:36:27] All ye saints of light, proclaim
[1:36:33] Jesus, the light of the world.
[1:36:40] Life and mercy
[1:36:43] in his name.
[1:36:46] Jesus.
