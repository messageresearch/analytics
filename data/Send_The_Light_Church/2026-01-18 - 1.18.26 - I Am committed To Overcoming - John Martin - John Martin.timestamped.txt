[9:51] in the city where the lamb is light.
[9:54] Hallelujah. I'm looking forward to it.
[9:57] There's a country far beyond the starry
[10:01] sky.
[10:04] There's a city where there come night.
[10:10] If we're wait, we shall go there by and

[10:34] I've a mansion over there and we're free
[10:37] from toil and care. I am going where the
[10:41] lamb is alive.
[10:45] Here we have our days of sunshine. But
[10:48] we know
[10:51] that the sun that shines upon us now so
[10:54] bright
[10:56] will be changed to clouds and rain until
[11:00] we go
[11:02] to that city where the lamb is alive.

[11:13] In that city where there cometh no
[11:17] night.
[11:19] I have a mansion over there and we're
[11:22] free from toiling care. I am going where
[11:26] the lamb is alive.
[11:30] There the flowers bloom forever and the
[11:33] day hallelujah
[11:35] shall be one eternal day without an eye.
[11:41] and our tears shall be forever wiped
[11:44] away.
[11:46] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[11:52] In that city where the lamb is the
[11:55] light.
[11:58] In that city where there cometh no
[12:01] night.
[12:03] I have a mansion over there and we're
[12:06] free from toiling care. I am going where
[12:10] the lamb is alive.
[12:14] Here we have our disappointments all the
[12:17] while.
[12:19] And our foundest hopes might meet the
[12:22] bitter blind.
[12:25] Though by night we weep and mourning
[12:27] brings a smile.
[12:30] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[12:36] In that city where the lamb is the
[12:39] light.

[12:44] night.
[12:46] I've imagined over there and I'm free
[12:50] from care. I am going where the lamb is
[12:55] alive.
[12:57] Then let sunlight fade and let l bring
[13:00] its gloom.
[13:03] Not a shadow can my blissful soul fly.
[13:08] For I know that up in heaven there is
[13:11] room.
[13:13] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[13:19] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[13:24] In that city where there cometh no
[13:27] night.
[13:30] I've imagined over there and we're free
[13:33] from toil and care. I am going where the
[13:37] lamb is alive.

[30:44] rero my life.
[30:50] I should have fallen my soul has thou
[30:56] but mercy
[30:59] rewrote my life.
[31:04] Oh mercy
[31:06] reo my life.
[31:11] God bless you. My mercies brother
[31:14] reroll my love.
[31:19] I should have fallen. My soul cast down
[31:26] but mercy
[31:29] rero my life.
[31:35] Amen. We can sing that every day.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; His mercies are new every day and we
[31:39] need them
[31:41] &gt;&gt; as we need the mercies of God.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; We we can't survive. I believe the whole
[31:48] bride of Jesus Christ
[31:51] is a bene a benefactor of the mercies of
[31:54] God.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; And to know that we serve a good God who
[31:59] cares about us.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; And is a very merciful God. Uh it just
[32:06] makes us want to do better, doesn't it?
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. and certainly appreciated that
[32:10] song uh brother Ferguson just to a
[32:13] testimony to God of what God has done
[32:16] for you.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; I believe we all need to share in some
[32:21] way what God is doing in our life and
[32:23] and just keep um
[32:27] testifying of how great God is. Amen.
[32:30] Let's look to the Lord in a word of
[32:31] prayer before we begin to read his word.
[32:35] Amen. How many has a request on your
[32:37] heart today?
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Our heavenly father, we come
[32:43] before you. We thank you, Lord, for this
[32:46] warm building. We thank you that we
[32:48] could worship you this morning and uh
[32:53] praise you for Lord, this is why we've
[32:55] come into your house is for you to meet
[32:59] with you and to connect with you and to
[33:02] honor you Lord to give thanks for all
[33:06] that you've done for us
[33:08] &gt;&gt; now. Lord, we just pray that you would
[33:10] meet every need that were that would be
[33:13] amongst us in our midst. Lord, you see
[33:16] the hands that were raised. You see
[33:18] those, Lord, that are battling some sort
[33:21] of sickness or something. Lord, we just
[33:24] pray that you would come and be the
[33:28] unseen guest, the Jehovah Gyra, to meet
[33:30] every need that we would have.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; And Father, we humbly pray now that you
[33:35] would give us ears to hear what you have
[33:38] to speak to us, Lord. And let us be able
[33:42] to leave here, as brother Ron said, with
[33:44] a a a revelation
[33:47] uh of of of of
[33:50] what you speak to us, Lord, that we
[33:52] might be just better overcomers and to
[33:56] come into the image that you have uh
[33:59] predestined us to come to. Lord, bless
[34:01] the reading of your word now as we look
[34:04] into. Bless the preaching, bless the
[34:06] ears, Lord. Father, there be the the
[34:08] tricks of the enemy to try to have our
[34:11] minds just go on different things and be
[34:14] distracted
[34:15] and uh to walk in and out of the
[34:17] sanctuary and just the different things,
[34:20] Lord, that the enemy would try to do.
[34:22] And I just pray that you, Lord, your
[34:24] love would captivate us. Lord, your your
[34:27] word would captivate us. Though, Lord,
[34:30] we may not be an elegant speaker, but
[34:33] Lord, your word trumps every situation.
[34:36] Lord, we so commit ourselves to you in
[34:38] this time. Give you the honor in advance
[34:41] now. For we pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[34:44] Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the
[34:47] book of Revelations uh chapter 3. Um
[34:52] God speaking to um to our church,
[34:57] speaking to our church, to our
[34:59] generation,
[35:00] to the last church age. Uh here in
[35:04] chapter 3,
[35:07] we're going to read verse 21.
[35:12] To him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[35:15] sit with me in my throne, even as I also
[35:20] overcame, and am set down with my father
[35:24] in his throne.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in Revelations chapter
[35:28] 21,
[35:36] Verse number seven.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Revelations 21 verse number 7. He that
[35:43] overcomemeth
[35:46] shall inherit all things
[35:49] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[35:52] son.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[35:56] I didn't know if uh the request got in
[35:59] for Sister Linda Helms, but she had
[36:01] requested prayer for uh Davian's
[36:04] deliverance and that she had been up
[36:06] through the night and that's why they
[36:08] were not here this morning. Sorry if
[36:10] that request was supposed to get in by
[36:13] me. Let's just remember to pray for her.
[36:15] So good to see brother Orlando.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Are you
[36:21] seeing how are you seeing today?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; You're seeing pretty good.
[36:26] Yes, God's God's given us bodies, but
[36:30] then our bodies begin to
[36:33] uh but we have a new body waiting for us
[36:35] that we'll never have to have surgery.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; We'll never have to take any any pills,
[36:40] any aspirin pain pills,
[36:42] &gt;&gt; and we'll be forever
[36:44] &gt;&gt; in his presence. Amen.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; We like to entitle this message, I am
[36:49] committed to overcoming. Amen.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; And somebody had handed me this title
[36:54] and said, "We need uh if you would do a
[36:57] service, I think you should do a service
[36:59] on this." And uh
[37:02] so if you want a sermon on something,
[37:04] that is how you get it. Just turn in a
[37:06] little note. And uh
[37:10] &gt;&gt; we need a vision for our lives.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Without a vision for our lives, we're
[37:14] going nowhere.
[37:16] Without a vision for our children,
[37:19] they would not go nowhere. The Bible
[37:20] says without a vision people perish.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; And overcoming is crucial.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; It's crucial to a a nature change, a
[37:29] body change, and a rapture. Just because
[37:32] we've accepted Jesus Christ, just
[37:34] because we've been baptized, does not
[37:36] mean that we're going into a rapture.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Overcoming is imperative to sit with God
[37:43] on his throne and to inherit all things.
[37:47] Salvation is not being an overcomer.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; I know it's a it's a strong statement,
[37:55] but we have an example of that. The Lord
[37:57] save the people out of the land of
[37:59] Egypt. He heard their cry and he came
[38:01] down and he delivered them. Psalms 34:18
[38:03] says, "The Lord is nigh unto them that
[38:05] have a broken heart and saveth such of a
[38:08] contrite spirit." And that's where the
[38:10] children of Israel were. They were
[38:11] they're crying under bondage. They were
[38:13] broken their their spirit. And and so
[38:16] they were crying out and God saved them.
[38:18] He literally brought them out of Egypt,
[38:22] but you know, the Lord did not
[38:27] did not overcome for them.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; He saved them, but he did not overcome
[38:32] for them.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; They had to go through the wilderness
[38:36] and prove that they were overcomers and
[38:38] take the promised land.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So overcoming
[38:43] is is not a a gift. Okay? So salvation
[38:47] is a gift,
[38:48] &gt;&gt; right? We're saved by grace. It is the
[38:50] gift of God, not of works. But
[38:53] overcoming is not a gift. God does not
[38:56] gift overcoming.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. Right? It's a
[39:01] victory. So it's something where we have
[39:03] to do something in order to get it.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:08] Jude 1:5 says, 'I will therefore put in
[39:10] remembrance, though ye once knew this,
[39:12] how that how that the Lord having saved
[39:16] the people out of the land of Egypt,
[39:18] afterwards, destroyed them that believe
[39:21] not or destroyed them that would not
[39:24] overcome, that did not overcome.
[39:26] Overcoming is crucial.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; So what do we have to overcome?
[39:35] We must overcome the world that we were
[39:38] born into.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Now, this consists of a lot. So, we're
[39:42] going to try to,
[39:46] you know, when I thought about this
[39:47] message, this could be just a tremendous
[39:49] message for an evangelist to come in
[39:51] here and just really pump us up and, you
[39:53] know, really get us, you know, flowing
[39:55] good when we want to walk out the door.
[39:57] But I don't know how long that lasts.
[40:00] You know what I'm saying? So, it's
[40:02] important that we just really take
[40:04] serious that our life every day we have
[40:06] to be committed to overcoming
[40:10] &gt;&gt; what is the world it's the very satanic
[40:13] nature that we're born with
[40:15] &gt;&gt; that we're born into and that we're
[40:18] that's all around us. So the world is
[40:21] everywhere. It's in us. It's the people
[40:23] we talk to. It's all around us. It's
[40:26] everywhere.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; It's pride. It's self-will. is I'm going
[40:31] to do what I want to do.
[40:34] That's the world. And it's not only in
[40:37] us, but it's everywhere and it's in
[40:40] everything.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; So, you talk about something major that
[40:45] we have to overcome. 1 John chapter 2:15
[40:49] says, "Love not the world,
[40:52] neither the things that are in the
[40:54] world. If any man love the world, the
[40:57] love of the father is not in him.
[41:01] doesn't mean you can't watch a game.
[41:05] Doesn't mean you can't enjoy watching a
[41:07] game. But what it does mean is you don't
[41:10] love the satanic nature of that game.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Understand the difference.
[41:17] The word, the word world in the Greek is
[41:21] cosmos. And you've probably heard this
[41:22] before meaning the order or the
[41:25] arrangement of the world system. that
[41:29] we're going to try to go back here at
[41:31] the beginning when this all started. The
[41:33] order or the arrangement of the world
[41:35] system, what Satan became in heaven, he
[41:39] has ordered and arranged down here on
[41:42] earth.
[41:46] And what is that order exactly?
[41:49] It is
[41:51] satanic principles.
[41:54] It's selfishness, self-will, greed, and
[41:56] force.
[41:59] This is the world. So, it's not
[42:02] something you would look out there and
[42:03] say, you know, I I'm I'm never going to
[42:05] go to a carnival because that's of the
[42:07] world.
[42:09] No, it's satanic principles that could
[42:11] be right inside of a church,
[42:14] &gt;&gt; right inside of our home,
[42:16] &gt;&gt; right inside of where we work, who we
[42:18] talk to, our friends, what we're
[42:20] texting.
[42:24] Satanic principle, selfishness, thinking
[42:26] of one's own gain, profit or pleasure.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Self-will. I will exalt my will above
[42:34] God's will for my life.
[42:37] Greed. I will exalt my throne above the
[42:40] throne of God.
[42:42] Force. I will manipulate, ally, deceive,
[42:45] use all manner of force to get my will.
[42:48] These are satanic principles that he had
[42:51] in heaven where he got a third of the
[42:54] angels came down
[42:56] and everything was fine in the garden of
[42:59] Eden until Eve fell. And when she fell,
[43:05] her nature
[43:07] be her nature fell and all that she had
[43:10] also fell and it began to get mixed with
[43:13] Satan's nature.
[43:19] Satan's principles are all I I I I I.
[43:24] And when we really re real realize that,
[43:26] we'll see how close we are to the world.
[43:28] Just watch just watch your your nature
[43:30] and your motives. You'll see
[43:34] Satan's world order has become the very
[43:37] nature that we were born with. We were
[43:38] told so many times we were born in sin,
[43:40] shape, and iniquity. What does that
[43:41] mean? We were born with the very nature
[43:44] of myself. I
[43:47] but anything that God ever birthed, he
[43:50] birthed them to do God's will.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Not you have a choice to do whatever you
[43:54] want to do. Yes, he gave that privilege
[43:56] to even the angels, right?
[43:59] &gt;&gt; That's why a third could leave.
[44:02] And think about this, the angels are
[44:05] just not um
[44:09] they have a will.
[44:12] It isn't like they're robots and it's
[44:14] impossible for them.
[44:17] God entrusts his angels.
[44:21] A and and God can't trust everybody, but
[44:24] he can trust his bride.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; The very nature we were born with was
[44:31] selfishness, self-willed, selfish,
[44:33] greedy, manipulative, forceful. You
[44:35] know, you you a child does not have to
[44:37] go very far before it realizes it's not
[44:40] as cute as we thought it was,
[44:43] right? And we we know that we're dealing
[44:45] with something that we would never teach
[44:47] that child. Where did that child get it
[44:49] from? Who taught that child that?
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Nobody taught it. Was born with that.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; It was born with that worldly nature.
[44:57] That's why we must be born again. Satan
[45:00] has arranged the world to be your will
[45:03] be done, not God's.
[45:06] That's the world that we live in. It's
[45:08] the mark of the beast. It's 666. The
[45:10] Revelation 13 tells us it's the mark of
[45:13] a it's the number of a man.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us that
[45:16] vicarious filid means instead of Christ.
[45:20] This is Satan's world. It's instead of
[45:23] God.
[45:25] God's principles are his will, his word,
[45:29] and his way. That's real simple. You got
[45:30] Satan's principles and God's principles.
[45:33] Good to see you, Sister Vetman this
[45:34] morning. God's principles are his will,
[45:37] his word, and his way, which is just
[45:41] take a look at a few of these things,
[45:44] which Jesus himself taught us to love
[45:48] one another the way he loved us. Just
[45:52] talking about the principles of God to
[45:54] esteem others better than yourself
[45:56] to not look every man on his own things
[45:58] but the things of others to not make
[46:01] yourself of a reputation about I I I but
[46:03] think about somebody else's reputation
[46:06] &gt;&gt; to humble yourself to the will of God
[46:09] said that eternal life was living for
[46:12] others
[46:13] &gt;&gt; so we see the principles
[46:16] of God is to live for others where the
[46:19] principles of Satan is all about
[46:21] yourself. HOW CAN I GET AHEAD? What can
[46:23] I do? It's all about me. Let's use the
[46:25] church. Let's use one another. Let's use
[46:27] who we got to use to get what we want
[46:30] &gt;&gt; in the name of religion.
[46:35] This world is not just in us, but it's
[46:37] in everyone. This nature and it's in
[46:40] everything and it's everywhere. And
[46:42] Jesus gave us the remedy to overcome
[46:45] that.
[46:46] He just said, "Deny yourself daily.
[46:51] Deny yourself your will daily. Pick up
[46:54] your cross and follow me."
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Love not the world, neither the things
[47:04] that are in the world. St. John 2:15.
[47:08] If any man love the world, the love of
[47:10] the father is not in him. So to
[47:13] basically to love your will
[47:16] to love your will is not to have the
[47:18] love of God in you.
[47:21] Think about that. It it's not just like
[47:24] I said these outside things are out
[47:26] here. You got to think about the worldly
[47:28] nature that's in you. Look at verse 16.
[47:31] All that is in the world,
[47:35] all uh for all that is in the world, the
[47:38] lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[47:40] the pride of life is not of the father,
[47:43] but of the world. Now notice what the
[47:45] identification is of the world. He's
[47:47] identifying not the football games.
[47:51] He's identifying what's inside of man.
[47:57] And you can see how our promised land
[47:59] today is filled with giants.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; And in other words, this temple belongs
[48:06] to God.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; But we but but when it was found, we
[48:11] realized that we were really bad
[48:15] and we need to overcome those things
[48:18] &gt;&gt; and and get a new nature change. Verse
[48:21] 17. And the world passeth away, and the
[48:24] lust thereof, here it is. But he that
[48:27] doeth the will of God abideth forever.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Everything must come down to doing God's
[48:35] will.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Everything. Now, at one time, Adam was
[48:40] in the image of God. He was doing the
[48:43] will of God just like this scripture.
[48:45] And had complete dominion over the
[48:47] earth. And when Ardom Ardom Adam
[48:51] partook, that's me saying two words at
[48:53] one time.
[48:55] And when Adam partook of the tree of
[48:57] good and evil, he lost all that he had.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; And Adam's nature at that point became
[49:07] mixed with Satan's. I know this is maybe
[49:11] a little hard to grab here, but God
[49:15] said, "Because thou has eaten of the
[49:16] tree which I commanded thee, saying,
[49:19] Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed is the
[49:22] ground for thy sake, in sorrow thou
[49:25] shalt eat of it all the days of thy
[49:27] life. Thorns and thistles shall bring
[49:29] forth to thee,
[49:31] and thou shalt eat of the herb of the
[49:33] field. In the sweat of thy face shalt
[49:37] thou eat bread till thou return unto the
[49:40] ground. For out of it was thou taken for
[49:43] dust thou art. Dust thou shalt return.
[49:45] And he said unto the woman about the
[49:47] woman's nature, I will greatly multiply
[49:49] thy sorrow and thy conception and in
[49:52] sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.
[49:54] So here their whole nature was evolving
[49:58] from the image of God now to the image
[50:01] of a lower image, a li image of a beast
[50:04] or the the image of of Satan if I could
[50:07] say it like this because it was like you
[50:09] want your will fine you're going to then
[50:11] reap what your will is.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; So Adam and Le Eve lost dominion of
[50:20] their nature.
[50:22] It was now mixed with a curse. And same
[50:26] with all that was underneath Adam,
[50:29] referring to the world that he lived in.
[50:31] The he he no longer could say, you know,
[50:34] to this tree, I want you over here and
[50:36] to the animals. Everything began to
[50:38] change. Uh the animals were no longer
[50:41] just sweet and nice to one another.
[50:44] Everything changed.
[50:48] Now what happened is Satan began to use
[50:50] his influence, his ability and his
[50:53] anointing.
[50:55] He started to use his deception.
[50:58] He was able to use his cleverness and
[51:02] his wisdom to make civilizations and
[51:04] science. And finally, the wisdom of
[51:06] Satan became the wisdom that man began
[51:09] to use on earth.
[51:12] And Satan's nature began to work through
[51:14] man and slowly evolving.
[51:18] And if you notice,
[51:21] the world had to be destroyed
[51:23] &gt;&gt; by water because it became so evil.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; And it's going to get destroyed again
[51:28] because it's so evil, by fire.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; So, you know what Satan has to offer?
[51:35] It sounds good for self, right? This is
[51:38] how I can get ahead. If I do this, I'll
[51:40] get ahead. So, that sounds good for the
[51:43] moment, but the problem is it's not good
[51:46] for anybody else and it's not good long
[51:48] term. That's
[51:49] &gt;&gt; right.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; The only way eternity will ever be is
[51:52] living for others.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; That's it. It's the only way it works.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 8:23, he said, "You
[52:02] are from beneath. I am from above.
[52:07] You are of this world. I am not of this
[52:11] world.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Making it real clear that there's a
[52:14] distinction there. So your nature is
[52:19] from Satan. My nature is not. Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 4:8,
[52:30] here's part of just a little part of
[52:32] where Satan uh
[52:36] the devil was tempting Jesus. I just
[52:39] want to read one part of it in verse
[52:40] eight said the again the devil taketh
[52:43] him up to an exceeding high mountain and
[52:45] showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[52:47] world
[52:49] and the glory of them.
[52:52] Basically Satan it was Satan's he won it
[52:55] right? So he offered it to him.
[52:59] But Satan, if you notice, Satan got the
[53:01] world unlawfully.
[53:05] And this was an opportunity for Satan to
[53:08] really exalt his kingdom above the
[53:10] throne of God right here. This this this
[53:12] was it right here. This was the bait.
[53:14] And he said unto him, "All these things
[53:16] will I give you if you just fall down
[53:19] and worship me. If you just just lower
[53:23] your standard just a little bit." Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Just come down off of that that high
[53:30] standard and just compromise just a
[53:33] little bit and I'll give you all this.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus saith unto him, "Get thee,
[53:41] hence Satan, for it is written, thou
[53:42] shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
[53:44] alone shalt thou serve." See, Jesus knew
[53:47] he was going to get the world. He's
[53:49] gonna get everything backl
[53:54] &gt;&gt; by giving himself right at Calvary.
[53:57] God is not of this world and he has
[53:59] called his elect children out of the
[54:01] world.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; So he's called us out. He's called us to
[54:05] separate. How do we separate from a a
[54:07] worldly spirit and nature and everything
[54:10] that's around us?
[54:12] 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse1 17.
[54:14] Wherefore come out, he said, from among
[54:18] them, and be ye separate, sayaeth the
[54:21] Lord, and touch not the unclean thing,
[54:24] and I will receive you, and will be a
[54:27] father unto you, and you shall be my
[54:29] sons and daughters, sayaeth the Lord
[54:31] Almighty.
[54:36] So, whatever is of a worldly nature,
[54:40] you got to separate from it.
[54:42] Let's say that Bob here because there's
[54:44] no Bob's here or Ted's.
[54:47] Say Bob and Ted are complainers.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Bob and Ted have to learn to separate
[54:55] from complaining.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Come out of that. Be separate. And I
[55:04] you're going to be my sons and
[55:05] daughters. See, here's what Satan wants
[55:06] to say. You do whatever you want. You're
[55:08] still a son and daughter. Right?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Well, that only lasts so long. I mean,
[55:14] we got we got the children of Israel as
[55:16] an example of that.
[55:18] So, at some point, God says, "Show me if
[55:20] you got character. I want to see you
[55:22] overcoming." I'm going to tell you, the
[55:24] greatest thing that should be on our
[55:25] mind all the time is becoming more into
[55:27] the image of Christ.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know what it is, but Satan
[55:30] just wants us to get up and, you know,
[55:31] you go to church and and and just try to
[55:34] just go with the flow, and nothing
[55:36] matters. Like, something's just
[55:37] magically going to happen. we're going
[55:38] to make a rapture without coming into
[55:40] the image of God. It just I I can't
[55:42] believe that Satan has deceived so many
[55:44] people.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; I mean, we've got to be committed to
[55:48] OVERCOMING BECAUSE IF WE DON'T OVERCOME,
[55:50] WE DON'T GET CHARACTER. WE DON'T GET
[55:51] CHARACTER. WE'RE NOT GOING IN.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; It's that simple.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't matter if you can fool
[55:59] everybody.
[56:02] that the thing the thing is
[56:06] in our heart we just need to realize
[56:08] that God is calling us personally.
[56:11] Not everybody wants to pay the price.
[56:13] Everybody's not committed.
[56:18] That means everybody's not going to make
[56:19] it. Right? Many will come to me in that
[56:22] day, Lord, what happened? Why? I thought
[56:23] I did this and I did that.
[56:26] But they weren't committed.
[56:31] Revelations 21:7, our opening scripture,
[56:34] he that overcomemeth shall inherit all
[56:36] things, and I will be his God, and he
[56:37] shall be my son. See, it it's not just
[56:40] separating,
[56:42] but we got to separate to the point that
[56:44] we're overcoming.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; They got to put these scriptures
[56:48] together. God has called us to come out,
[56:51] to separate, and to overcome.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Not just join a church, but overcome
[56:56] what? The satanic worldly nature. that's
[56:59] all around us.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; You ever talk to somebody and you know
[57:06] they're not being real with you?
[57:11] They're trying to pull a a funny one, a
[57:14] fast one,
[57:16] trying to give, you know, a little half
[57:20] truth. You know what I'm talking about?
[57:23] Sometimes it's easy to identify in other
[57:27] people this nature.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; But can we identify in oursel?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Because I'm telling you, I don't care
[57:35] how good you are.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; You still have to die daily.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; I don't care. You just got to because
[57:42] how do I know that? Because Jesus said
[57:44] that. That's the only way I know. That's
[57:46] right.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; We must be completely born of his
[57:53] nature, a a a completely new creature in
[57:57] Christ Jesus where the old has passed
[57:59] away, the new has has become and all
[58:02] things are of God in our life. And we
[58:04] begin to think like, I care about what
[58:05] God wants me to do today.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times we this is the
[58:10] way we look at God. This is the way we
[58:12] look at God.
[58:14] Good morning, God.
[58:17] Good morning, son. Good morning,
[58:18] daughter. God bless you and have a
[58:21] wonderful day today. Whatever you do,
[58:23] have a good day today. That's the way we
[58:26] look at God. Like, it doesn't matter
[58:28] what we do that day because our God is
[58:30] such a good God. He just whatever you
[58:32] want to do.
[58:34] And we begin to to forget that God has a
[58:37] will for our life.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we've got to take time to
[58:41] say, Lord, what would you have me to do
[58:43] today?
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Not my will, but thy will be done.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; God has called his elect children out of
[58:54] the world. Everybody's not going to come
[58:55] out. Most are going to be the majority
[58:58] are going to be compromisers.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And did you know, Ann, that a
[59:02] compromiser is a complainer?
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Think about that. That's right.
[59:15] An overcomer doesn't complain.
[59:19] And brother Marty, I know you you watch
[59:21] sports. Those of you that watch sports,
[59:23] you ever watch somebody in sports and
[59:26] somebody did them wrong. They did them
[59:29] wrong, but they don't retaliate back.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; You look at them and you go, "Wow, that
[59:35] that that's that took character."
[59:37] Because somebody would did that to me, I
[59:39] would have let them know right quick,
[59:40] &gt;&gt; you were wrong.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And of course, you see somebody that
[59:44] that does retaliate and they get mad and
[59:46] they're throwing their helmet down and
[59:48] you think, "Come on.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. Is that worth it? What are you
[59:53] going to do? Do you think the rest going
[59:54] to come back and say, "Oh, I'm sorry."
[59:58] &gt;&gt; So, it it takes character to not
[1:00:00] complain. Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; To to just simply say
[1:00:06] it must please the Lord to bruise them.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; It It's not about always proving what's
[1:00:14] fair and what's right.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; It's about being able to go through
[1:00:18] things
[1:00:20] and suffer knowing that you're in the
[1:00:22] will of God.
[1:00:24] Jesus said in John 15:18, "If the world
[1:00:28] hate you, you know that it hated me
[1:00:31] before it hated you."
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And if you were of the world, the world
[1:00:36] will love his own. But because you're
[1:00:39] not of the world, but I have chosen you
[1:00:41] out of the world, therefore the world
[1:00:43] hate you. You know that is so comforting
[1:00:47] when you realize when you take a stand
[1:00:50] when you take a stand for the word
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; and you are not like for it. It's okay.
[1:00:55] It's a privilege.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; It's an honor.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; But to go and not take a stand for the
[1:01:01] word, you become ashamed
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; John 17:14, I have given them thy word
[1:01:12] and the world hates them.
[1:01:15] because they are not of the world even
[1:01:16] as I am not of the world. I pray not
[1:01:18] that thou shouldest take them out of the
[1:01:20] world
[1:01:22] the planet right but thou shouldest
[1:01:25] keepeth them from the evil the evil
[1:01:27] nature.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; So God wants us to be here and not be
[1:01:33] part of the world.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; They are not of the world even as I am
[1:01:37] not of the world. Sanctify them through
[1:01:39] thy truth. Thy word is truth. The word
[1:01:41] of God is what takes out the worldly
[1:01:43] nature. It sanctifies us.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; We come to church, we hear the word, and
[1:01:47] our heart says, "Amen. So be it to me in
[1:01:50] my life, Lord. I want to be like you."
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Sanctify the worldly nature out of them
[1:01:56] by walking in the truth or the light of
[1:01:59] the word.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth and what?
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Truth shall make you free. That's right.
[1:02:06] John 16:12 says, "I have yet many things
[1:02:08] to say unto you, but you cannot bear
[1:02:10] them now."
[1:02:12] In other words, the satanic nature that
[1:02:15] you're dealing with is a whole lot more
[1:02:16] than you can deal with.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; You're going to need the comfort of the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost to help you with
[1:02:23] this situation. You can take your mind
[1:02:25] off and say, "No, I don't need to deal
[1:02:26] with it." But you know, it's going to
[1:02:28] keep popping up.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; How be it when he, the Spirit of truth,
[1:02:32] has come, he will guide you into all
[1:02:35] truth.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; We must overcome our worldly nature.
[1:02:41] And I don't if I could say it like this.
[1:02:44] Everybody's worldly nature is exactly
[1:02:47] the same in here.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; It's got the capability of of being bad.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; And but we all have the same
[1:02:59] responsibility to keep it crucified.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:06] He that overcomemeth that worldly nature
[1:03:09] shall inherit all things and I will be
[1:03:12] his God and he shall be my son.
[1:03:16] We'll be to sit with him on the throne.
[1:03:18] What a promise to the bride. I say to
[1:03:21] the bride, I say to the overcomer, we
[1:03:24] shall inherit all things. We shall sit
[1:03:26] with Christ on the throne. That is a
[1:03:28] promise to the bride. It isn't to
[1:03:30] everybody else. It's to the overcomer.
[1:03:33] He that have ears to hear, let him hear
[1:03:35] what the spirit is saying unto the
[1:03:38] church.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; The devil, did you know the devil is
[1:03:42] committed to keeping you from getting
[1:03:46] God's complete nature?
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be satisfied with what
[1:03:50] you have.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; I'm sure we're all familiar with that
[1:03:53] spirit. He wants you so entangled with
[1:03:56] the cares of this life that you get
[1:03:59] discouraged
[1:04:01] or too busy or too distracted with
[1:04:05] pleasures or earthly plans.
[1:04:09] He wants you laying up treasures here on
[1:04:12] earth.
[1:04:13] He wants you so caught up in your life
[1:04:16] that your will is all that really
[1:04:18] matters to you.
[1:04:21] He wants to flood your life with
[1:04:22] unsolvable problems.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; You just on a squirrel cage going around
[1:04:28] with them.
[1:04:30] He wants to find anything good to do
[1:04:33] that doesn't involve the nature change.
[1:04:35] In other words, he wants you to do good
[1:04:37] things
[1:04:40] as long as it's not dealing with you
[1:04:42] changing your nature.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Because what good does it do doing good
[1:04:47] things all your life? But your your your
[1:04:49] nature never gets changed. You never
[1:04:51] overcome anything. And this is the how
[1:04:54] messed up the world is thinking I'm a
[1:04:56] good person. I'm doing good things.
[1:04:59] Like like how is that going to make you
[1:05:01] an overcomer?
[1:05:04] So the devil wants you to do good
[1:05:06] things.
[1:05:09] He does.
[1:05:11] As long as you're not dying out.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; As long as you're not suffering. As long
[1:05:18] as you're not sacrificing, it's not long
[1:05:20] as you're not presenting your body
[1:05:21] living sacrifice.
[1:05:24] If you just, you know, want to do
[1:05:25] something good to maybe, you know, have
[1:05:27] somebody look at you a little bit nicer,
[1:05:30] you know, he he's he's got a whole the
[1:05:33] devil is committed to keeping you from
[1:05:35] overcoming.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He's committed.
[1:05:38] The devil wants you so bothered about
[1:05:40] someone
[1:05:41] gossiping about them or maybe holding
[1:05:44] grudges against them that you don't want
[1:05:48] to forgive them.
[1:05:50] It's a trick of Satan. See, the the
[1:05:52] devil knows if we don't forgive others
[1:05:55] and God's not going to forgive us.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Satan knows it. So, if I can just get
[1:06:00] you so involved with a a little bit of a
[1:06:02] problem with somebody, well, then you
[1:06:04] know what? You're not going to overcome.
[1:06:06] He's got so many tr you know, you open a
[1:06:09] tackle box up and there's so many lures
[1:06:11] in there.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; The devil wants you to love your friends
[1:06:18] only.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Don't love your enemies. Don't pray from
[1:06:23] your heart for those that despitefully
[1:06:25] use you and persecute you. Don't lay
[1:06:27] aside everything and go get perfect
[1:06:29] love. You can wait till later.
[1:06:33] The devil doesn't want you to seek the
[1:06:35] kingdom of God first.
[1:06:38] Devil doesn't want you to pay your
[1:06:39] tithes first.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, the devil is committed.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; You know, we're fighting an evil evil
[1:06:47] spirit.
[1:06:50] Ephesians 6:12 says, "For we wrestle not
[1:06:53] against flesh and blood, but against
[1:06:56] principalities, against powers, against
[1:06:58] the rulers of the darkness of this
[1:07:00] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:07:03] high places." That's what we're fighting
[1:07:06] against.
[1:07:08] But the devil don't want you to know
[1:07:09] that.
[1:07:12] Romans
[1:07:13] 12:20 says,
[1:07:16] "Therefore,
[1:07:18] if thine enemy hunger, feed him.
[1:07:23] If he thirst, give him drink. For in
[1:07:26] doing so, thou shalt heap coals of fire
[1:07:28] upon his head." Now, if I could just say
[1:07:30] this,
[1:07:32] I don't want that to be your motive.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Look at verse 21. Be not overcome of
[1:07:37] evil, but overcome evil with good. Well,
[1:07:39] how do you do that?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Do good to your enemy.
[1:07:44] That's how you overcome evil with good.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; You don't set them straight
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[1:07:54] Sometimes it's the goodness of God that
[1:07:56] brings man to repentance.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; So, we overcome evil with goodness.
[1:08:04] The word overcome means to subdue, to
[1:08:07] conquer, to prevail, and to get the
[1:08:10] victory.
[1:08:12] So we have to subdue and conquer and
[1:08:16] prevail this evil nature that we're born
[1:08:18] with that we wake up every day with
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; that every chance we can, we want it to
[1:08:24] be served.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It's
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; awful quiet in here. Somebody needs to
[1:08:30] get excited about the word.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:33] Look at this. In Matthew 11:12, Jesus
[1:08:36] speaking. He says, ' And from the days
[1:08:38] of John the Baptist until now, the
[1:08:39] kingdom of God suffereth violent, and
[1:08:42] the violent taketh by forth. There's a
[1:08:45] battle.
[1:08:47] Now, it's not a physical force because
[1:08:49] we're fighting against not flesh and
[1:08:50] blood. We're fighting against spirits.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Satan is out to stop you. And we have to
[1:08:57] conquer and get the victory over the
[1:08:58] devil with faith in doing the good
[1:09:02] thing.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; You have to have faith because a lot of
[1:09:05] times when somebody's being mean to you
[1:09:08] and and you're going to be thinking,
[1:09:11] well, if I'm going to be nice, they're
[1:09:13] just going to, you know, use me.
[1:09:16] If I'm going to uh do good to them,
[1:09:19] they're just going to take advantage of
[1:09:20] me.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Or they don't deserve it because they
[1:09:23] did that to me. They need to apologize.
[1:09:25] I mean, you got so many things going on
[1:09:26] in your mind.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; So, that's why you have to be committed
[1:09:31] to overcoming.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Committed. You can't just, well, if it
[1:09:35] works out, you know, there's no snow.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE COMMITTED. YOU'RE FIGHTING
[1:09:43] DEMONS THAT DON'T WANT YOU TO GET A
[1:09:45] NATURE CHANGE.
[1:09:48] Luke 16:16,
[1:09:51] the law and the prophets were until
[1:09:53] John. Since that time, the kingdom of
[1:09:56] God is preached, and every man press
[1:10:00] into it.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; God is not just going to lay out his
[1:10:05] character.
[1:10:07] You got to press into God's character.
[1:10:11] If the devil's committed to keeping you
[1:10:13] from the complete nature change, then we
[1:10:15] need to be committed to overcoming the
[1:10:18] devil.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; You know, part of a carnal believer is
[1:10:25] him thinking that he's not even in a
[1:10:26] battle.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; A carnal mindset.
[1:10:32] Well, I I don't have any problems with
[1:10:34] any anybody. Then I everything must be
[1:10:36] good.
[1:10:38] Well, I'm telling you, we're in a battle
[1:10:40] all the time.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; You got if if you don't see I I remember
[1:10:45] brother Henkins saying one time, he
[1:10:48] says, "If you didn't come uh you didn't
[1:10:51] come against the devil somewhere, cross
[1:10:53] the devil in your path in somewhere in
[1:10:56] the course of your day, you need to back
[1:10:58] up because more than likely you're going
[1:11:00] in the same direction he went is going
[1:11:01] in." Like that devil is out to stop you
[1:11:04] from getting interested in getting in a
[1:11:06] nature change. He wants you involved and
[1:11:09] interested in everything else. And the
[1:11:11] only time you ever hear about a nature
[1:11:12] change is when you come to church.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And why are we getting anywhere? Why are
[1:11:18] we growing spiritually, right? BECAUSE
[1:11:21] WE'RE NOT TAKING GOD SERIOUSLY.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 2:11.
[1:11:29] Less Satan should get in advantage of
[1:11:32] us,
[1:11:34] for we are not ignorant of his devices.
[1:11:38] See, Satan knows what he's doing.
[1:11:41] He's trying to get advantage.
[1:11:45] If the weakest if the devil trembles at
[1:11:48] the weakest Christian on his knees
[1:11:51] because he's he's calling out to God,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; If he if if Satan can keep somebody from
[1:11:56] getting on their knees,
[1:12:00] He's got the advantage
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; because Satan can whip any one of us.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Any one of us. But he can't whip God.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; He can't whip God in us.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But we got to be yielded to God. We got
[1:12:15] to be doing God's will. We got to be
[1:12:17] letting God have his way.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Preeminent.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; All that he was all that was in God, he
[1:12:23] poured into Christ. All that was in
[1:12:25] Christ, he poured into the church. And
[1:12:27] God's desire is for him to have
[1:12:29] preeminence in the church.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; But that's us not just saying, "Yeah, I
[1:12:34] believe in the message. I believe in
[1:12:35] that scripture. I believe in God." BUT
[1:12:37] IT'S US LEAVING GOD BE PREEMINENT IN my
[1:12:40] life.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Because we are the church of God, right?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Not just here at church,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; but in our everyday.
[1:12:50] So in order to be committed to
[1:12:52] overcoming, we must have a committed
[1:12:55] attitude.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus said we must press in, take it by
[1:13:00] force. We must be violent because the
[1:13:03] devil is standing in our way. He's
[1:13:04] blocking. I remember in the world, and
[1:13:06] I' I've mentioned this before. I
[1:13:08] remember in the world before I was even
[1:13:09] a Christian, I was listening to that
[1:13:10] stairway to heaven. Satan's there
[1:13:13] blocking the way, keeping the Christian
[1:13:15] from from from getting to heaven.
[1:13:19] I mean, you talk about inspiration in
[1:13:22] the satanic world,
[1:13:24] but we must be p purposeful,
[1:13:28] persistent, determined, and committed to
[1:13:31] fighting against the devil.
[1:13:35] We must persevere through challenges,
[1:13:38] showing steady dedication. I'm I'm I'm
[1:13:41] dedicated.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Not just wait till somebody's ask, not
[1:13:44] to wait till Sunday, but just you make a
[1:13:47] decision. I want to I want to go home
[1:13:50] and I want my home to be different.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; And and and and no excuses.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; No excuses.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Excuses means you're not committed.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; We need a committed attitude. We need to
[1:14:05] be strong, courageous. Second Timothy
[1:14:07] chapter 2, Paul is is talking to
[1:14:10] Timothy. And he says there thou
[1:14:12] therefore my son
[1:14:15] be strong in the grace that is in Christ
[1:14:18] Jesus
[1:14:21] and the things that thou has heard of me
[1:14:24] among many witnesses the same commit
[1:14:27] thou to faithful men who shall be able
[1:14:31] to teach others also. Now notice,
[1:14:35] if you're not going to teach somebody
[1:14:36] who's faithful,
[1:14:39] they're never going to be able to teach
[1:14:40] others who are fa to be faithful.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; It's like you have to learn to be
[1:14:45] committed. You have to learn to be
[1:14:46] faithful first.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; And then you're a candidate to to to
[1:14:50] teach others how to be faithful.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[1:14:58] soldier of Jesus Christ. Well, we're in
[1:15:01] a soldier. We're we're we're soldiers.
[1:15:03] We're in a battle and we got to endure
[1:15:07] hard times. We can't just make them an
[1:15:09] excuse or or or or a reason why we're
[1:15:11] going to set our armor down and and not
[1:15:14] press in. Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; No man that warth that's in the battle
[1:15:20] entangleth himself with the affairs of
[1:15:24] this life
[1:15:26] that he may please him who have c chosen
[1:15:29] him to be a soldier.
[1:15:33] I love that. And if any and if a man
[1:15:35] also strive for the masteries yet he's
[1:15:37] not crowned except he strive lawfully.
[1:15:41] In other words, God's saying, "Be
[1:15:44] faithful.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Do it the right way.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't fake your way in. Be
[1:15:51] faithful. That's that's lawful.
[1:15:57] If we're committed to overcoming, then
[1:15:59] we need to be strong. We need to be
[1:16:01] courageous. We need to be strong in
[1:16:03] prayer. We need to stay under the blood.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; We need to put on the whole armor of
[1:16:07] God. And we need to maintain a positive
[1:16:11] testimony in our life.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Present our bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:16:16] If we could turn to Revelations 12, and
[1:16:18] I didn't have this written down, chapter
[1:16:21] 12.
[1:16:23] I just want to start at verse 7 if we
[1:16:25] could. If you could pull that up.
[1:16:27] Revelations 12:7. I was going to start
[1:16:29] at verse 10, but I just want to show you
[1:16:32] this war that started in heaven and how
[1:16:35] it's how it involved us. And we didn't
[1:16:37] even ask to be involved. Starting with
[1:16:40] verse 7. And there was war in heaven.
[1:16:44] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:16:47] the dragon. And the dragon fought and
[1:16:51] his angels.
[1:16:53] So if you can just imagine all these
[1:16:55] angels fighting in heaven
[1:17:00] and
[1:17:02] prevailed not
[1:17:06] neither was their place found anymore in
[1:17:09] heaven. So basically after the fight
[1:17:14] uh Satan didn't win, the dragon didn't
[1:17:16] win, angels didn't win, and they got
[1:17:18] kicked out.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; So that's where we're at right here. And
[1:17:22] the great dragon was cast out, the old
[1:17:24] serpent called the devil, and Satan,
[1:17:27] which deceiveth the whole world. He was
[1:17:30] cast out
[1:17:33] um into the earth, and his angels were
[1:17:36] cast out with him. So, he's he's coming
[1:17:40] down with his worldly nature now. He's
[1:17:43] wanting to deceive just like he deceived
[1:17:45] the angels, he's now wanting to deceive
[1:17:48] everybody on earth. And I heard a loud
[1:17:51] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:17:54] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:17:57] of our God and the power of his Christ
[1:17:59] for the accuser of the brethren. He's
[1:18:02] cast down which accused them before our
[1:18:05] God day and night.
[1:18:09] So why do we accuse anybody? Satan does
[1:18:12] that enough.
[1:18:17] We ought to be praying for one another
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; and they overcame him. Now notice moving
[1:18:26] ahead now. It's kind of like a what
[1:18:29] happened
[1:18:30] before the Garden of Eden. And now we're
[1:18:33] moving ahead. So this this is like in a
[1:18:35] few verses we see a lot like a like an
[1:18:38] capsule
[1:18:40] everything that transpired and they
[1:18:42] overcame the devil by the blood of the
[1:18:46] lamb by the word of their testimony
[1:18:51] and they love not their lives unto
[1:18:53] death.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You talk about an ingredient
[1:18:59] that is needed to overcome the devil.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] You can't just use the blood
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; because God wants you to be an
[1:19:09] overcomer.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You just can't confess it with your
[1:19:16] mouth.
[1:19:18] But your life has to follow your
[1:19:20] testimony.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And it does that by dying out.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Love not your life. Love not your will.
[1:19:29] Love not what you want to do unto the
[1:19:31] death.
[1:19:33] Therefore
[1:19:35] rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in
[1:19:37] them. Woe to the heavens of the earth
[1:19:39] and of the sea. For the devil has come
[1:19:41] down unto you having great wrath because
[1:19:44] he knoweth that he have but a short
[1:19:47] time. So you go through the course of
[1:19:49] the day and you don't think about the
[1:19:50] your enemy.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; He is definitely thinking about you.
[1:19:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; He's definitely out to get you, but he's
[1:19:59] very tricky.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, you just natural wars. When you
[1:20:03] see natural wars, you want to be tricky
[1:20:06] because you want to win the war. You
[1:20:08] don't want to see that you you don't
[1:20:09] want them to see you coming.
[1:20:12] It's no different in the spiritual war.
[1:20:14] The devil doesn't want you to realize
[1:20:16] he's the one that's trying to get you
[1:20:18] distracted from getting into the image
[1:20:21] of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] He says, "What good would it do to have
[1:20:28] nothing to do with ball games, worldly
[1:20:30] music, have nothing to do with
[1:20:32] anything?" But inside of here, this
[1:20:35] worldly nature never changed or never
[1:20:38] completely changed. Let me just say that
[1:20:40] completely changed
[1:20:43] because he's coming for a bride without
[1:20:44] spot or wrinkle, is he not?
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; If a believer isn't committed, they will
[1:20:49] never overcome. A believer must be
[1:20:53] committed no matter what. No excuses.
[1:20:57] No excuses.
[1:20:59] No excuses. And and and one more thing I
[1:21:02] WANT TO SAY. NO EXCUSES.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; It It's almost like here I'm going to
[1:21:09] give you this excuse. This is why I
[1:21:11] don't
[1:21:16] I can't pay tithe because, you know, I I
[1:21:19] I got all my bills I got to pay.
[1:21:24] Look, the reason I said that is because
[1:21:26] you got me mad.
[1:21:28] Excuses.
[1:21:30] Excuses. Excuses.
[1:21:35] If a believer is committed, nothing will
[1:21:38] stand in the way of a complete victory.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Christ, Paul said it like this, Christ
[1:21:44] in me, the hope of glory.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:49] The devil's job is to present you
[1:21:54] lacking,
[1:21:55] complacent,
[1:21:57] lukewarm.
[1:21:59] And it's the job of the five-fold
[1:22:02] ministry to present you perfect.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; A perfect bride.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Without spot or wrinkle.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; There's the battle.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; The five-fold ministry is actually there
[1:22:13] to help you, not make you feel bad.
[1:22:15] Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; It's giving you what you need to
[1:22:19] overcome the enemy.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Doesn't agree with your flesh. The
[1:22:22] five-fold ministry is not for your
[1:22:23] flesh.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; It's for your soul.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; The devil is for your flesh.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; We must be committed to overcoming. The
[1:22:34] word committed means dedicated,
[1:22:37] loyal, bound to a cause, a person or an
[1:22:40] action, showing unwavering focus. In
[1:22:45] other words, we can't be wishy-washy.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Can't be double-minded about overcoming.
[1:22:49] We can't be, well, I'm going to try.
[1:22:51] Sometimes, sometimes I'm not. Sometimes
[1:22:54] I'm here at church and sometimes I'm
[1:22:56] not. Sometimes I want to try and support
[1:22:58] and sometimes I don't want to.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You that is not a commitment.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And you're not going to overcome
[1:23:04] anything in your life.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; We will never overcome the devil
[1:23:08] wavering or being inconsistent or
[1:23:10] double-minded.
[1:23:12] We must learn to remain stable in our
[1:23:16] commitment. Stable.
[1:23:18] You know how much life our life would be
[1:23:21] if we just worked on being stable?
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; James 1:8, a doubleminded man is
[1:23:30] unstable
[1:23:32] in all of his ways.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you got a car. Your car
[1:23:40] doesn't always start.
[1:23:43] You start your car 10 times a week.
[1:23:48] Two times a week, it doesn't start.
[1:23:54] It
[1:23:55] doesn't matter where you're going. It
[1:23:58] just at that time it ain't going to
[1:23:59] start.
[1:24:02] So it's it's not reliable.
[1:24:06] A person that's not stable is not
[1:24:08] reliable.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; That's why God requires faithfulness.
[1:24:14] Number one,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; faithfulness to the word.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And God sent us a message for a reason.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Not so we could pick some, you know, a
[1:24:23] few quotes here and there out of it and
[1:24:24] say, "No, I tell you, there's no quotes
[1:24:28] in this message today." Of course, I
[1:24:30] think the last message there was a ton
[1:24:32] of quotes, but I'm telling you what,
[1:24:34] this message is what made this word
[1:24:35] alive to me.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is what made
[1:24:39] this word alive.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Open my eyes to see. Verse seven, for
[1:24:45] let not that man think that he shall
[1:24:47] receive anything of the Lord.
[1:24:50] An unstable man, God just says, forget
[1:24:52] it.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Well, think about uh Leodysia. They're
[1:24:57] not hot. They're not cold.
[1:24:59] They're lukewarm. He says, "Look, you
[1:25:02] know what? This this is unstable.
[1:25:06] I I you do what you want to do, but if
[1:25:09] you're going to be in this condition,
[1:25:10] I'd rather have you just go serve the
[1:25:12] devil."
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; It's exactly
[1:25:15] He because God is serious.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; He's not a Santa Claus.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; He's serious.
[1:25:22] We must be positive. We must think
[1:25:25] positive and we must talk positive.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's part of the attitude. Matthew
[1:25:30] chapter 12:36. But I say unto you that
[1:25:33] every idol word that man shall speak,
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; they shall give an account for thereof
[1:25:39] on the day of judgment.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; You want to know what an idol word is?
[1:25:43] It means inactive,
[1:25:46] unemployed, lazy, useless, barren.
[1:25:50] Idle word.
[1:25:53] When a car is sitting at an intersection
[1:25:56] and the light is green and they're not
[1:25:59] going,
[1:26:01] they're sitting there idle
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; and they're not going. Everybody around
[1:26:05] who's waiting for them knows something's
[1:26:08] wrong.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; When somebody just speaking idol words,
[1:26:17] something's wrong.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; We got to give an account.
[1:26:21] Verse
[1:26:24] 37.
[1:26:27] For by thy words thou shalt be
[1:26:28] justified, and by thy words thou shalt
[1:26:30] be condemned. That's scary. So if you're
[1:26:33] telling somebody you need to do this,
[1:26:35] well then you need to be doing it, too,
[1:26:37] right?
[1:26:38] Be committed to speak the word.
[1:26:41] They, the elect of God, overcame the
[1:26:44] devil by the word of their testimony. So
[1:26:47] you've got to be committed to speaking
[1:26:49] the word. We must be sure. We must be
[1:26:52] confident. Paul said, "Being confident
[1:26:54] of this very thing, he which had begun a
[1:26:56] good work in you shall perform it, he
[1:26:58] shall finish it until the day of Jesus
[1:27:00] Christ."
[1:27:03] Timothy was facing fear about
[1:27:06] being persecuted
[1:27:09] because nobody wants to be persecuted,
[1:27:11] right? You want how many wants somebody
[1:27:13] to not like them? Let me see your hands.
[1:27:16] Everybody wants to be liked,
[1:27:19] right?
[1:27:20] And sometimes we're afraid to take a
[1:27:22] stand. That's kind of where Timothy was
[1:27:26] at. In verse 8, 2 Timothy chapter 1
[1:27:29] verse 8 says, "Be not thou fear
[1:27:32] therefore ashamed of the testimony of
[1:27:35] our Lord."
[1:27:37] In other words, you're going all they
[1:27:39] that live goaly are going to suffer
[1:27:40] persecution,
[1:27:42] nor of me as a prisoner, but be thou
[1:27:46] partaker of the afflictions of the
[1:27:48] gospel according to the power of God. In
[1:27:52] other words, whatever you go through,
[1:27:53] it's okay because you got the power of
[1:27:55] God in you.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; You you can you can overcome the
[1:28:00] situation.
[1:28:01] I mean, I I thank God that I'm not one
[1:28:04] of the 68 million Protestants that were
[1:28:07] burnt at the stake.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, we still got to overcome. And
[1:28:12] this is a harder age because we're
[1:28:14] fighting invisible demons. But we just
[1:28:16] got to be positive.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Verse seven, for God hath not given us
[1:28:22] the spirit of fear,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:28:29] mind.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] And when those things aren't clicking,
[1:28:34] back up, humble yourself, bow your head,
[1:28:37] say, "God, forgive me. I am not going to
[1:28:40] fear.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to trust in what you have
[1:28:43] given me."
[1:28:45] If we're not committed, then we'll never
[1:28:47] overcome our obstacles. And we all got
[1:28:49] them. First John chapter 5 verse4 says,
[1:28:53] and we're we're winding down here. For
[1:28:55] whatsoever is born of God,
[1:28:58] he's the one that overcomemeth the
[1:29:00] world. And this is the victory that
[1:29:02] overcomemeth the world, even our faith.
[1:29:07] See, we have to believe. We have to
[1:29:10] believe.
[1:29:12] We can't stop trusting.
[1:29:14] Jesus said in John 16:33, "These things
[1:29:17] have I spoken unto you that that you
[1:29:19] might have peace. In the world you shall
[1:29:21] have tribulation, but be of good cheer.
[1:29:24] I have overcome the world.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; I have overcome the world.
[1:29:32] If God is living in you, you will
[1:29:33] overcome.
[1:29:35] And see the key here. Here's the key.
[1:29:40] This thing is almost full. This water.
[1:29:45] I mean, it's sealed, but there's a
[1:29:47] little bit of room there.
[1:29:50] I could dump everything else out and I
[1:29:53] could have this testimony. God is in my
[1:29:56] life.
[1:29:59] God is in my vessel
[1:30:01] because there'd be water in this bottle.
[1:30:04] True. Maybe only a drop or two, but it's
[1:30:07] there. But here's the thing.
[1:30:11] I'm not going to be able to overcome
[1:30:12] very much with just a drop of God.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells me to be filled with the
[1:30:18] spirit. That's right.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; To be filled.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Now, that means I got to call. I got to
[1:30:25] seek. I got to ask.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I got to keep coming to him.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; I got to keep I got to I I got to keep
[1:30:31] on getting filled up.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; And if I don't keep that going, then if
[1:30:38] Satan can just say, "Oh, you got God.
[1:30:40] You got God. You got God." And
[1:30:43] therefore, you don't press in.
[1:30:46] that that that's why Paul said, "I press
[1:30:49] towards the mark.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; I I have such a hunger to know God
[1:30:52] more." I'm gonna be honest with you. I
[1:30:54] go through the course of the day and
[1:30:56] this is what I see at the end of the
[1:30:57] day. I see John Martin. I wish I had
[1:31:00] more of God so I could be better.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; That is what I see at the end of the
[1:31:05] day. And because of that, that gives me
[1:31:07] a desire to press in.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Because if I'm satisfied with where I'm
[1:31:11] at, I'm not going to press in. If I
[1:31:13] don't think there's a need to overcome
[1:31:15] my my ill nature, if I think I'm good
[1:31:18] enough to make it in
[1:31:21] that, see, I'm battling a complacency
[1:31:23] spirit, a lukewarm spirit.
[1:31:26] But God has called us to perfection.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Let us go on to perfection.
[1:31:32] And I think perfection is being able to
[1:31:34] manifest Christ 24/7.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Caleb said, "Let us go up at once."
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're more than conquerors. We're
[1:31:44] more than able to take the land.
[1:31:47] 1 John 4:4 says, "Ye are of God, little
[1:31:50] children, and have overcome them
[1:31:54] because greater is he that's in you than
[1:31:58] he that is in the world."
[1:32:02] Once you get God in you, you got
[1:32:05] something greater in you than the
[1:32:07] worldly nature you were born with. If
[1:32:09] you just think about it, think about
[1:32:11] everybody's all the testimonies of
[1:32:13] people's lives changing,
[1:32:17] being delivered,
[1:32:19] people becoming free of certain things
[1:32:22] that they were bound with. What was
[1:32:24] that?
[1:32:26] That's God in them greater than the
[1:32:28] nature that they were.
[1:32:31] And and God has a vision for us. And
[1:32:35] that vision is to be in his image.
[1:32:38] And if we reach that, we that means
[1:32:41] we'll overcome all things and we'll get
[1:32:44] to to to literally while all the
[1:32:47] servants are out there in heaven, you
[1:32:49] are going to be sitting with God on the
[1:32:50] throne. You are his wife.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Think about that. You are the bride of
[1:32:54] Jesus Christ. We need to be committed to
[1:32:57] overcoming. Last scripture,
[1:33:00] Colossians chapter 3, verse number 12.
[1:33:05] How many loves the word? Amen.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; It ought to make us excited.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; The word of God ought to make us
[1:33:13] excited.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Colossians 3:12, "Put on therefore as
[1:33:19] the elect of God,
[1:33:21] holy and beloved, vows of mercy,
[1:33:25] kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
[1:33:29] longsuffering." Notice these things are
[1:33:33] not the world or satanic principles.
[1:33:37] These are God's principles.
[1:33:40] Forbearing one another and forgiving one
[1:33:43] another. If any man have a quarrel
[1:33:46] against any, even as Christ forgave you,
[1:33:49] so also do you. And above all these
[1:33:52] things, put on charity, which is the
[1:33:55] bond of perfectness.
[1:33:57] And let the peace of God rule.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take rulership in your
[1:34:03] heart.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; To the which also you're called in one
[1:34:08] body and be ye thankful.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Hard to be thankful and complaining at
[1:34:14] the same time.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Right? They're two different spirits.
[1:34:19] Let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:34:22] richly
[1:34:23] in all wisdom,
[1:34:25] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:34:28] the psalms and in hymns and spiritual
[1:34:32] songs,
[1:34:33] singing with grace in your heart to the
[1:34:36] Lord.
[1:34:38] And whatsoever you do in word, whatever
[1:34:42] you confess, whatever you say, or
[1:34:45] whatever you do, do it all in the name
[1:34:48] of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God
[1:34:52] and the Father by him. Amen. Let's stand
[1:34:56] together.
[1:34:58] Let's leave here confessing that we're
[1:35:00] committed to overcoming.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, really talk about it in your
[1:35:04] home.
[1:35:05] Don't just let this be a a good another
[1:35:08] good message.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Take this word and make it change your
[1:35:13] life. Be more committed. Don't stop
[1:35:14] confessing. Don't stop fighting. I
[1:35:17] believe God wants us to have a personal
[1:35:22] a personal confession. Now, everybody in
[1:35:25] your home may not have this, but you
[1:35:27] personally need to have it. I am
[1:35:29] committed to overcoming.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I personally am committed to overcoming.
[1:35:33] Let's sing. Greater is he that is in me.
[1:35:41] Amen.
[1:35:43] Oh, greater is he that is in me.
[1:35:48] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:35:53] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:36:02] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:36:06] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:36:10] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:36:15] is in the word. I'm claim it. Greater is
[1:36:20] he that is in me.
[1:36:24] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:36:28] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:36:33] is. Doesn't that sound good? I just want
[1:36:35] to sing it again. Greater is he that is
[1:36:39] in me.
[1:36:41] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:36:45] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:36:50] is in the world.
[1:36:55] Amen. I can really see like Joshua and
[1:36:59] Caleb, they were not afraid to to take
[1:37:01] the land
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; because they really believed it
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; and I really believe that God in me can
[1:37:08] overcome the giant nature inside of me.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Just believe it.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; We've got the power.
[1:37:21] We've got the power
[1:37:27] in the name of Jesus.
[1:37:31] We've got the power
[1:37:36] in the name of the Lord.
[1:37:41] Though Satan rages,
[1:37:45] we shall not be defeated.
[1:37:50] We've got the power
[1:37:55] in the name of the Lord.
[1:38:00] We've got the power
[1:38:05] in the name of Jesus.
[1:38:09] We've got the power
[1:38:14] in the name of the Lord.
[1:38:19] Though Satan raes,
[1:38:23] we shall not be defeated.
[1:38:28] We've got the power
[1:38:33] in the name of the Lord.
[1:38:38] We've got the power
[1:38:43] in the name of Jesus.
[1:38:48] We've got the power
[1:38:52] in the name of the Lord.
[1:38:58] Those saint raes
[1:39:02] we shall not be defeated.
[1:39:07] We've got the power
[1:39:11] in the name of the Lord.
[1:39:16] Amen. Amen. Praise God. Jesus on the
[1:39:20] inside.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; That's where the power's at, right?
[1:39:25] Jesus on the inside working on the
[1:39:30] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:39:36] Jesus on the inside, working on the
[1:39:41] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[1:39:59] What a
