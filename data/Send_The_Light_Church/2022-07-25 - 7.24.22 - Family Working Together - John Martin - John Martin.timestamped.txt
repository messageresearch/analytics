[31:58] kind of a service and i hope that you
[32:00] just you know bear with me but i want to
[32:03] give a a little a missionary report um
[32:07] the first one we're going to watch it
[32:08] came in about a week ago from
[32:11] costa rica
[32:12] uh
[32:14] and brother eric shacon
[32:17] where he's the pastor
[32:19] there in this area
[32:21] we had met brother eric
[32:23] in 2006 when we had gone there on a
[32:26] mission trip and at that time he was
[32:29] just uh starting
[32:32] um and we had some services in a school
[32:35] for a meeting in the school and he had
[32:37] just uh some there that he had gathered
[32:40] and then some of the brothers that came
[32:43] from
[32:44] brother
[32:45] cabias's church
[32:47] was also there
[32:48] but
[32:49] we're going to watch a video and i'm
[32:51] going to say
[32:52] as we watch this i'm so impressed
[32:57] with
[32:58] how he has
[33:01] taken off so serious for the lord i want
[33:04] our church should be like this church
[33:07] and we've been um sponsoring him for a
[33:10] number of years
[33:12] and
[33:14] you know when you when you sponsor
[33:16] people honestly we sponsor dozens of
[33:19] ministers all over the world
[33:23] and obviously
[33:24] we
[33:25] uh we don't have enough
[33:28] funds to do that in this church i
[33:30] understand but god gave us a company
[33:32] and i know god gave that company it
[33:34] doesn't belong to john martin
[33:37] it belongs to the lord
[33:40] but
[33:42] there's so many times that you're giving
[33:44] and you're supporting and you're helping
[33:46] and some
[33:47] just don't seem to see a lot of fruit to
[33:49] be honest with you that's what it is
[33:51] it's called investments
[33:53] and some
[33:55] they they're just a great investment but
[33:58] you just give you just give i've never
[34:00] regretted giving even to those who've
[34:02] used my money i've never regretted
[34:05] because it's not mine to begin with it
[34:07] won't be when it's over it's all the
[34:09] lords but i want us just to to rejoice
[34:12] in this as we watch it i was totally
[34:14] impressed i seen it this morning for the
[34:16] first time
[34:20] amen maybe we could turn it up make sure
[34:22] it's up
[34:29] god bless you richly from emmanuel
[34:32] tabernacle
[34:33] costa rica
[34:35] we wish to send you a warm greeting in
[34:37] the name of the lord jesus christ
[34:40] we want to share the advance and the
[34:42] missionary work we are doing on our
[34:44] church
[34:45] divided on three subjects but first we
[34:49] want to report the follow-up that we
[34:51] have done in the conversation of our
[34:54] sister sharianna orbando from azeri city
[34:58] whom we baptized time ago and we
[35:00] included on our last report
[35:03] she lives at 34.17
[35:06] miles from our church and since she does
[35:10] not have a car of her own
[35:12] she would have to travel from the mutton
[35:14] sides to the capital city
[35:17] and then take a bus to the church which
[35:20] will be a three-hour strip same time
[35:23] returning home we want to remind you
[35:25] that she started to follow our streaming
[35:28] services since the beginning of the
[35:30] pandemic and since then she had a job
[35:33] that requires her to work on sundays
[35:36] recently those circumstances changed and
[35:39] since she has a desire to attend to the
[35:42] church and while searching the best
[35:45] option for her to assist the services
[35:48] brother eric coordinated with vermonico
[35:50] cubiez pastor in san jose so she can
[35:55] attend to his congregation which is an
[35:58] hour and a half away from her home
[36:00] we pray that she perseveres every day
[36:03] and crowns her career now
[36:06] let's see the missionary advance of the
[36:08] church
[36:09] new missionary
[36:11] at liberia this is a city with 67 000
[36:16] inhabitants we have had two meetings
[36:18] already performed by
[36:20] our brother and minister
[36:23] erin vado
[36:24] who is also a deacon at our church
[36:28] and an ordained minister
[36:31] now together with our brother
[36:34] daniel vado
[36:36] pastor of the church bible called
[36:38] tabernacle that is located
[36:40] 49.70 miles away from liberia
[36:44] in santa cruz guanacaste
[36:46] we agreed to wait three months
[36:49] for this missionary effort where brother
[36:51] eden will be traveling every two weeks
[36:54] to have a sunday service in the house of
[36:57] his nephew
[36:59] jose
[37:00] adam canales who requested to hear the
[37:03] message preached
[37:05] now the missionary work at san ramon
[37:08] during the following three months
[37:10] we will have services in different areas
[37:13] to spread the message of the hour
[37:16] besides the services we have been doing
[37:18] every sunday at bajo te hat in the house
[37:22] of sister veronica andino we went to
[37:24] have the services in san pedro
[37:26] at the house of sister anna vargas
[37:29] inviting close friends of the community
[37:32] and measured their interests to continue
[37:34] with this model in some of the houses of
[37:37] the new commerce
[37:39] at this very moment we are preaching
[37:41] every sunday by distributing the
[37:44] services among the associated ministers
[37:47] layman suasso is a very appreciated
[37:50] minister by the brethren in san ramon as
[37:53] he was the one that initiated efforts to
[37:56] establish a church there
[37:59] also brother stephen solis who is a
[38:02] minister under training he has showed an
[38:05] excellent streak of the word and
[38:09] the pastor of the church prayer eric
[38:11] at the end of three months we will
[38:13] evaluate this way of reaching the
[38:16] community and determine
[38:18] if it is time to rent a place
[38:21] in a more convenient area of the city
[38:23] thus far we have assigned some equipment
[38:26] to perform the services
[38:29] we have a sound base two speakers and a
[38:32] pulpit ready to be used
[38:34] once we are established in a conditional
[38:37] place a brother layman is given a
[38:40] portable pulpit and we assign a budget
[38:42] to buy an electric piano and microphones
[38:46] sister veronica's daughter who is a 12
[38:48] year old young lady her name is
[38:51] christina she is playing a small piano
[38:54] for worship
[38:55] she is taking classes with one of the
[38:57] pianists from our church twice a month
[39:00] virtually and two more times on site we
[39:03] ask your prayers for this group amen
[39:06] evangelistic efforts on our city
[39:09] gracia is a city with 80 000 inhabitants
[39:13] distributed in seven districts
[39:16] during the last months we have prepared
[39:19] a message broadcasting program
[39:22] that will allow us to share through the
[39:25] four most visited and watched social
[39:28] media for better results
[39:31] with our previous door-to-door method
[39:34] we do not see a positive answer
[39:36] that is why we want to do an effort on
[39:39] sharing the goodness of the message of
[39:41] the hour in a different way
[39:43] we have called this initiative
[39:46] restore the faith
[39:47] restaurant
[39:49] and the catchword of this broadcasting
[39:52] campaign is
[39:54] turning the hearts of the children to
[39:56] the faith of the feathers
[39:58] this effort implies that during the
[40:01] following two years we've got willing
[40:04] every week we will be sharing seven
[40:07] micro videos one podcast a blog
[40:11] and as a gift of those interests an
[40:14] ebook about the topics of the message
[40:16] exposed throughout the mission media
[40:19] every three months we want to have an
[40:21] on-site event where we will be sharing
[40:24] printed material of the message with an
[40:27] exposition of the topics we covered so
[40:30] far
[40:31] we will have some time for questions and
[40:34] answers and all these posts will be
[40:36] linked to the website with the same name
[40:39] restaurant
[40:41] restore the faith
[40:43] this effort will reinforce activities in
[40:46] all districts where we perceived a
[40:48] better answer
[40:50] also starting july we are having our
[40:53] evangelistic services the last sunday of
[40:56] each month
[40:57] where our congregation will do an effort
[41:00] of inviting family and friends of their
[41:03] neighborhoods
[41:05] we have done this in the past before
[41:07] pandemic and we saw a good response
[41:10] the preaching will be focused on
[41:12] evangelism this will sum up to the other
[41:16] two sunday services where we have
[41:19] specific objectives
[41:21] to bring a solid teaching the first
[41:23] sunday of each month
[41:25] and the next friday a questions and
[41:28] answer service
[41:29] and the second sunday service we will be
[41:32] praying for the sick
[41:34] the speech of this preaching will be
[41:37] focused on divine healing and we are
[41:39] inviting from the community all patients
[41:43] from the palliative care clinic where
[41:46] several are terminal patients
[41:48] all residents of the nursing home
[41:51] besides any other sick person invited by
[41:54] a member of the church
[41:56] we have a fasting and prayer group
[41:59] formed with 10 brothers and sisters that
[42:02] will be preparing the place for these
[42:04] services in the second semester of 2022.
[42:08] praise god we ask for your prayers so
[42:12] all these initiatives can reach souls
[42:15] and the lord may touch their hearts and
[42:18] bring his children to the restored word
[42:22] god bless you
[42:24] praise the lord
[42:27] yeah
[42:28] i'm impressed
[42:30] i'm impressed
[42:32] and you know didn't have to tell them
[42:34] what to do
[42:36] just supported they had the vision
[42:39] and
[42:40] what what we need is a vision we've got
[42:44] capability we've got talents we've got
[42:46] gifts but we need a vision
[42:50] and
[42:52] my desire my prayer is that we
[42:55] could do so much more around the
[42:58] communities that we're living than what
[43:00] we're doing
[43:01] but i'll tell you what it's going to
[43:02] take
[43:03] is your heart and your time
[43:07] i don't even need your money i just need
[43:08] your heart and i need your time
[43:12] god to have that he can do a great work

[44:28] he's just
[44:29] he's part of the the missionaries that
[44:32] we support here in our church
[44:34] we don't have them often we don't talk
[44:36] about them often but they're working for
[44:38] the lord on the other side we can get
[44:40] together and we'll you know hear more
[44:42] stories but i say this is a serious
[44:45] thing here
[44:47] you know winning souls it's a serious
[44:49] thing
[44:50] and uh we have such
[44:52] a an opportunity if we could just get a
[44:55] little bit more serious that that the
[44:58] time that we have left here it's not
[45:01] about us
[45:02] it's not about us it's about the rest of
[45:04] the body that needs to get in because as
[45:07] soon as that happens we can get out of
[45:08] here
[45:10] of course we appreciate brother johnson
[45:13] uh he's
[45:16] enough will cannot be said will not be
[45:19] said down here
[45:21] and i'm will be rejoicing for years
[45:24] because
[45:25] of
[45:26] what brother johnson
[45:29] has had a heart a seriousness for the
[45:32] souls of men and women
[45:34] and we just
[45:35] appreciate them
[45:37] and not i'm not enough could be said i
[45:39] could say it every service
[45:41] but uh we're here because he's here
[45:44] he was here because he came to ann arbor
[45:46] [Laughter]
[45:48] and so we just appreciate the example
[45:50] that he's get he is he's set
[45:53] and uh you know missions
[45:55] isn't just uh
[45:58] it's just a little something of every
[46:00] church
[46:01] it ought to be the main heart of the
[46:03] church
[46:05] amen do you believe that
[46:06] i believe with all my heart
[46:09] amen let's stand together for the
[46:11] reading of the word how many uh
[46:15] i trust we're all in sync with god
[46:18] how many is looking for the holy spirit
[46:20] to give revelation amen amen i i think
[46:24] that's real good because it takes all
[46:26] the pressure off of me of having to do
[46:29] it amen if you're really really looking
[46:32] to the lord i believe you're looking to
[46:34] the right one
[46:36] may god begin this morning by his spirit
[46:40] to give us continuous life-giving
[46:43] and prevailing revelation wouldn't it be
[46:46] amazing if we could just leave here with
[46:48] something
[46:49] that we didn't have when we came
[46:51] something that can help you in your
[46:53] personal life to to believe to trust and
[46:56] to overcome and not to not to look to
[46:59] man and depend on man to help but to
[47:01] look to him
[47:04] did you know that nasa has a greater
[47:05] telescope than hubble
[47:09] they just came out with it
[47:11] i believe it's called james webb space
[47:14] telescope
[47:15] if brother martin was here he'd probably
[47:16] be able to tell us all about it but they
[47:19] learned that there's more than uh
[47:21] there's ten
[47:22] more galaxies just like the milky way
[47:26] than they previously thought
[47:28] and the milky way is pretty big right
[47:31] i'm quoting here it says we knew
[47:33] we would see things hubble didn't see
[47:36] but in this case we're seeing things
[47:39] differently
[47:41] and that's what happens when the lord
[47:43] reveals to us his word
[47:46] we see things differently he has such a
[47:50] telescope that can look in and and
[47:53] reveal to us what he really trying to
[47:56] say
[47:57] but we just got to get in tune with him
[48:00] get our eyes off our flesh amen
[48:03] amen turn with me if you would to the
[48:05] book of
[48:06] first
[48:08] corinthians chapter 12. we're going to
[48:10] read verses 12 and 13. we want to title
[48:13] this message of family working together
[48:16] and for a subject a healthy
[48:19] functioning body we're not going to take
[48:21] the whole time we're just going to take
[48:23] a little bit of time because we're
[48:25] starting a little bit late
[48:26] and then we want to
[48:28] uh we've asked
[48:31] our wife
[48:33] and our daughter
[48:34] cheryl and ann
[48:36] to
[48:38] uh
[48:40] give us some
[48:42] some thoughts that could help us
[48:45] to work together as a family i hope
[48:47] that's okay with you
[48:49] amen amen let's just bow in a word of
[48:51] prayer heavenly father before we begin
[48:54] to
[48:55] read these scriptures lord
[48:57] we're calling on you because we need you
[49:00] the great interpreter of the word
[49:03] lord we humbly pray that you forgive us
[49:06] of all of our sins
[49:08] lord
[49:09] anything that is
[49:11] brought a displeasure
[49:13] any time that you've had to turn your
[49:15] head any time that
[49:17] lord you've been ashamed of us we pray
[49:20] that the the blood of jesus christ would
[49:22] just cover us and cleanse us and wash us
[49:25] and set us all aside
[49:28] for this service today and may you come
[49:30] with the power of that prevailing
[49:33] revelation
[49:34] into our hearts and life and help us to
[49:36] see something in your word lord that we
[49:38] just haven't quite seen before through
[49:41] the the great telescope of the holy
[49:44] spirit power oh granite lord we commit
[49:47] ourself and the remainder of this
[49:49] service now into your hands for your
[49:51] honor and glory we pray in jesus
[49:53] christ's name amen amen first
[49:56] corinthians chapter 12 verse 12 and 13
[49:59] for as many for as the body is one and
[50:02] have many members and all the members of
[50:05] that one body being many
[50:08] are one body so also is christ
[50:12] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[50:15] into one body
[50:17] whether it be jew or gr gentiles whether
[50:20] we be bond or free
[50:22] and have been all
[50:24] made
[50:25] to drink
[50:26] into one
[50:28] spirit
[50:29] amen god bless you may be seated
[50:32] when we come to christ we the bible says
[50:35] that
[50:36] we been all made to drink into one
[50:40] spirit
[50:43] so right now if we all had some coffee
[50:46] we'd get some caffeine
[50:49] if we all drank a pop we'd get some
[50:52] sugar
[50:53] if we all drank some liquor god forbid
[50:55] we'd do that
[50:57] but we'd get dizzy
[51:00] and we would all
[51:01] uh feel the same thing may act a little
[51:04] bit different you know some get
[51:05] jitteries with the coffee and in some
[51:08] can drink it all day long not get the
[51:09] jitters
[51:10] but you still get the caffeine and so
[51:13] when we come to christ
[51:15] we all act like christ
[51:19] right then brother brandon said it the
[51:20] spirit of beethoven live us and we begin
[51:22] to play like beethoven
[51:24] so when we when we're baptized into the
[51:27] spirit of christ something transpires we
[51:30] can no longer just say yes i'm born
[51:32] again and it don't show it shows
[51:36] it shows
[51:37] just like when we were in the world we
[51:39] all drank of a worldly spirit
[51:42] we were born with that spirit it's a
[51:45] wrong spirit and that spirit is simply a
[51:48] spirit of unbelief
[51:50] that's what that spirit it is it's
[51:52] unbelief that jesus is lord
[52:00] in fact
[52:01] that spirit that we were with it wanted
[52:04] to it wanted to induce us to be lord of
[52:07] our life to to be in control to make our
[52:10] own decisions to choose what we're going
[52:12] to do in life
[52:14] and that spirit is antichrist that's why
[52:18] we got to be born again that's why we
[52:20] must come to the the knowledge that
[52:22] jesus is not just lord of everything
[52:25] but he's lord of our life
[52:27] that we have control of what we yield
[52:30] ourselves to
[52:34] now no matter how long we've been
[52:36] serving the lord
[52:39] our old nature still wants to rise up
[52:44] and get us to control things
[52:47] jesus's remedy for this
[52:49] was
[52:50] to deny our own will on a daily basis
[52:54] and to pick up his will that was that
[52:56] was
[52:57] his remedy for this situation because we
[53:00] can't get rid of it
[53:05] show me a man that has
[53:08] if we don't discipline ourselves to
[53:10] present our body as a living sacrifice
[53:13] we can end up becoming a lukewarm
[53:16] christian
[53:17] sometimes trying sometimes not that's
[53:20] not christ in him there's no darkness at
[53:23] all
[53:24] romans chapter 3 verse 9 says what then
[53:28] are we better than they
[53:31] no in no wise
[53:33] for we have before prove both jews and
[53:36] gentiles
[53:38] that they are all under sin as it is
[53:41] written that there is none righteous no
[53:44] not one
[53:46] and there's none that understandeth
[53:48] there's none that seeketh after god i
[53:50] remember when i was in the world
[53:53] i didn't understand i wasn't seeking for
[53:56] god now look he says they are all gone
[53:59] out of the way
[54:01] they are all together become
[54:02] unprofitable there's none that do with
[54:04] good no not one
[54:06] if you remember when we were in the
[54:07] world we were just into whatever we were
[54:10] into
[54:12] that was our life and we thought it was
[54:14] the coolest thing
[54:18] the one thing was for sure that god
[54:19] wasn't in it
[54:26] all gone out of the way
[54:29] what way god's way
[54:31] god is the only way he's the way the
[54:33] truth and the life the true fact is we
[54:36] must believe that he is lord
[54:39] he's not just a savior to those that
[54:41] want to get saved then then go do what
[54:43] you want to do he's a lord
[54:46] and that's the faith that we must have
[54:50] romans 12 tells us not to be conformed
[54:52] to the world but to be transformed by
[54:54] the renewing of our mind that we can
[54:56] prove what is that good and acceptable
[54:58] and perfect will of god for our life
[55:00] what the perfect will of god for our
[55:01] life is to let him be lord of all of our
[55:04] decisions of our plans not us saying
[55:07] well we're going to do this we're going
[55:08] to do that this is how i think we're
[55:09] going to do things it doesn't matter
[55:11] what we think
[55:14] he needs to be lord amen
[55:17] every man when he's his he's doing his
[55:20] very best he's still vanity
[55:23] he still comes short of what god truly
[55:28] is
[55:29] what god's expectations are for man
[55:33] even though we're professing christians
[55:35] if we don't crucify
[55:37] our flesh i'll say it like this our will
[55:40] daily
[55:42] we can still end up getting out of the
[55:43] way
[55:45] that's why i read that scripture i know
[55:47] that was before we came to christ but we
[55:49] can still get out of the way
[55:52] we can still revert back to our old
[55:54] nature brother john you're saying some
[55:56] strong things well just let me ask you
[55:58] has anybody ever seen that old nature
[56:00] creep out of you
[56:05] oh yeah
[56:07] all you got to say is i'm sorry
[56:10] look at all the times that you said
[56:12] sorry that's that old nature trying to
[56:14] come back out and i'm telling you to
[56:16] whom you yield yourself servants to bay
[56:18] his servant you are whichever way you
[56:20] want to go
[56:25] brother branham said the sickest body
[56:27] that he knows
[56:29] was the body of christ
[56:35] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 says and you
[56:37] have he quickened who were dead in
[56:39] trespasses and sins where in times past
[56:41] you walked according to the course of
[56:43] this world according to the prince of
[56:45] the power of the ear of the spirit now
[56:47] look that now
[56:49] worketh in the children of disobedience
[56:57] it's now working in those who still
[57:00] don't believe that jesus is lord
[57:06] i'll go to church i'll do this i'm not
[57:08] don't ask me don't tell me i'll do this
[57:11] and that's it
[57:12] that's where that spirit is working
[57:15] it's working in those that we're going
[57:17] to just
[57:18] only do what they want because they're
[57:21] still lord
[57:22] they're still carrying that spirit of
[57:25] unbelief
[57:27] that's what the devil wants
[57:31] among whom also we all had our
[57:33] conversations in the times past and the
[57:35] lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires
[57:37] of the flesh and of the mind and we're
[57:39] by nature
[57:40] the children of wrath even as others now
[57:44] let me ask you when was the last time
[57:47] that your nature got really raffy
[57:52] wasn't that long ago was it
[57:56] it still wants to creep in
[58:00] the more we learn to just simply do what
[58:03] jesus said and to deny ourselves daily
[58:06] spend time in prayer say god i need you
[58:09] i can't go through the day on my own
[58:11] with my own abilities and live the word
[58:13] i need the holy ghost living in me
[58:16] that's the realness of what every
[58:18] christian should be doing every day
[58:22] now this same nature
[58:24] can take over a lot of believers
[58:27] who do not continually press towards the
[58:29] mark
[58:30] we can get to the place that we become
[58:33] unprofitable
[58:36] the body of christ
[58:38] to become unprofitable for the body of
[58:41] christ
[58:44] you know
[58:46] no one wants to take a look at their
[58:48] life and say this is where i'm lacking i
[58:50] understand that
[58:51] this is not a
[58:53] favorable type of a ministry but
[58:56] look
[58:58] we need to get serious about where god
[59:01] is calling us to instead of just always
[59:03] making excuses
[59:06] why i'm here or i'm not doing enough or
[59:09] this is all that i i need to be doing
[59:17] verse eight now we know something at the
[59:20] beginning came into our life and changed
[59:22] us did it not where his great love were
[59:24] with he loved us verse 8 says for by
[59:26] grace are you saved through faith and
[59:29] that not of yourselves it's the actual
[59:31] gift of god amen
[59:34] not of works
[59:36] unless any of us should say hey i have
[59:37] something to do with it
[59:40] for we are
[59:42] his workmanship this is what i want to
[59:44] get to
[59:45] created in christ jesus unto good works
[59:50] which god had before ordained that we
[59:52] should
[59:52] we should walk in them
[59:55] we're just not
[59:56] you know saved from hell and now go do
[59:58] what you want to do we've actually been
[1:00:02] created god god takes our hearts and our
[1:00:04] life and he creates us unto
[1:00:08] doing good works
[1:00:12] good works
[1:00:16] god takes our old nature
[1:00:18] to the process of sanctification and
[1:00:21] obedience and brings about his nature
[1:00:25] his character inside of us
[1:00:30] and i'll say that what happens
[1:00:32] is we learn to let jesus be lord amen
[1:00:37] the reality where he
[1:00:40] he is the one that dictates to us what
[1:00:43] we're going to do
[1:00:45] it's no longer us just okay i'm going to
[1:00:47] fit church in i'm going to try to do
[1:00:49] this and i'll do that but you know after
[1:00:51] that i'm doing my own thing
[1:00:54] you know satan has whitewashed us so
[1:00:56] much
[1:00:57] to where church is just just a part of a
[1:01:00] christian
[1:01:03] or or our our duties our
[1:01:05] responsibilities it's just a little
[1:01:07] power i'll do that get that out of the
[1:01:08] way then i'm just gonna do what i want
[1:01:10] to do
[1:01:14] god desires
[1:01:16] brother brahm told us god wants to give
[1:01:17] us the holy ghost so bad he told us
[1:01:19] about all the pressure it would take
[1:01:23] with a four inch pipe that's a mile high
[1:01:25] at the bottom of that would be so much
[1:01:26] pressure and god wants to give you and i
[1:01:28] the holy ghost more than the that amount
[1:01:31] of pressure that kind of pressure that's
[1:01:32] how much he wants to give us the holy
[1:01:34] ghost and we're satisfied with just
[1:01:36] popping in the church amen
[1:01:40] god is serious with those that want to
[1:01:42] get serious with him
[1:01:44] and what he
[1:01:46] when he gives you the holy ghost i'm
[1:01:47] telling you you're no more lord of your
[1:01:49] life you're no more lord of your life he
[1:01:52] becomes your lord
[1:01:54] he's not going to give you himself and
[1:01:56] let you be lord no because at the garden
[1:01:58] of eden he put cherubians with swords
[1:02:00] there he wouldn't let anybody live like
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:04] he's not going to do it today
[1:02:07] he's looking to take over our lives
[1:02:11] first peter chapter 1 verse 2 says we're
[1:02:14] the elect
[1:02:15] according to foreknowledge of god the
[1:02:17] father
[1:02:19] through
[1:02:20] sanctification
[1:02:22] of the spirit and on be an obedience
[1:02:26] and the sprinkling of the blood of jesus
[1:02:27] christ
[1:02:30] we're elect
[1:02:32] according to foreknowledge of god the
[1:02:34] father it don't stop there that's just
[1:02:36] that's just okay we're elected
[1:02:39] but now there's a process of
[1:02:41] sanctification there's a process of
[1:02:43] obedience
[1:02:44] and that where we fall we need to be
[1:02:46] sprinkled with the blood of christ
[1:02:48] and we need to keep going through this
[1:02:50] process of sanctification that's coming
[1:02:52] to church hearing the word walking in
[1:02:54] the word becoming obedient to that word
[1:02:57] and changing your life that things
[1:02:59] happen in your life don't be satisfied
[1:03:01] with just being a christian be satisfied
[1:03:04] with coming into the image of christ
[1:03:06] that's right
[1:03:07] amen second thessalonians 2 13 says but
[1:03:10] we are bound to give thanks always to
[1:03:12] god for you brethren beloved of the lord
[1:03:15] because god hath from the beginning
[1:03:18] from the very beginning when he called
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:21] from the very beginning before he even
[1:03:23] chose you
[1:03:25] to what salvation
[1:03:27] but how does this happen not just repent
[1:03:29] be baptized i'm saved no
[1:03:31] this is much greater is he that endure
[1:03:34] to the end
[1:03:35] he'll be saved through sanctification of
[1:03:38] the spirit and what belief of the truth
[1:03:42] now if at the end every knee is going to
[1:03:44] bow and every tongue is going to confess
[1:03:46] that jesus is lord don't you think the
[1:03:48] truth today is that god wants you to
[1:03:51] believe that jesus should be lord of
[1:03:53] your life amen
[1:03:56] now we know the whole world will just
[1:03:59] has no problem confessing yeah jesus is
[1:04:01] lord
[1:04:02] he's lord of my life i gave him my life
[1:04:04] but how many wants to hold themselves
[1:04:06] accountable to the word
[1:04:10] he's calling us saints
[1:04:14] god is working through his holy spirit
[1:04:18] in our heart he's working we are the
[1:04:20] workmanship of the holy spirit in our
[1:04:23] lives amen
[1:04:25] the bible tells us to work out now our
[1:04:28] own salvation with
[1:04:31] an attitude
[1:04:34] and that attitude
[1:04:36] is fear
[1:04:37] and trembling
[1:04:41] we talked a little bit about last
[1:04:43] service about coming into church without
[1:04:44] the fear and trembling
[1:04:48] like i got it all worked out i'm just
[1:04:50] here for knowledge i'm just here to you
[1:04:52] know i'm here to
[1:04:54] what are we here for
[1:04:57] brother brian says we're here to find
[1:04:58] out where we're at with him
[1:05:01] i'm so spiritual i know where i'm at
[1:05:03] with god before i come to church that's
[1:05:04] the type of attitude we can have
[1:05:09] philippians
[1:05:11] chapter 2 verse 13 says for it is god
[1:05:13] which worketh in you both to will and to
[1:05:16] do of his good pleasure so do all things
[1:05:18] without murmurings and disputes that you
[1:05:20] may be blameless harmless the sons of
[1:05:22] god without rebuke in the midst of a
[1:05:24] crooked and perverse nation among whom
[1:05:26] you shine as lights in the world
[1:05:30] wow
[1:05:31] god
[1:05:33] is doing something in me
[1:05:35] yeah my flesh wants to rise up
[1:05:37] and say no
[1:05:39] i'm going to do what i want to do and
[1:05:40] nobody's going to tell me
[1:05:43] it's up to you
[1:05:45] to recognize that your flesh
[1:05:48] it's up to you
[1:05:49] to take a stand
[1:05:52] and say i'm going to let god have his
[1:05:53] way in my life i'm going to let him be
[1:05:56] lord of my life lord of my decisions
[1:06:00] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:06:03] christ jesus unto good works which god
[1:06:06] had before ordained that we should walk
[1:06:09] in them we're no longer
[1:06:11] selfish
[1:06:13] zombies
[1:06:16] just doing our own thing nobody's going
[1:06:18] to tell me
[1:06:19] just walking around doing our own thing
[1:06:25] i don't want to be that
[1:06:28] i don't want to be
[1:06:30] a stranger to the body of christ
[1:06:34] i want to fit
[1:06:35] into the body of christ
[1:06:38] i don't want to be distant from the body
[1:06:41] christ i want to fit right in the body
[1:06:43] of christ are you with me
[1:06:46] ephesians 2 verse 19. now therefore ye
[1:06:49] are no more strangers and foreigners but
[1:06:51] fellow citizens
[1:06:53] with the saints
[1:06:55] in the household of god
[1:06:57] i hope you don't feel like a stranger
[1:06:59] today
[1:07:00] i hope you don't feel like a foreigner
[1:07:02] god bless our visitors
[1:07:04] god bless you
[1:07:06] and are built upon the foundation
[1:07:10] of the prophets jesus christ himself
[1:07:12] being the chief cornerstone
[1:07:16] our belief system is on the word amen
[1:07:19] in whom
[1:07:20] all
[1:07:21] the building this is every one of you
[1:07:23] and i
[1:07:26] in whom all the building fitly framed
[1:07:29] together
[1:07:31] groweth
[1:07:33] unto a holy temple
[1:07:35] in the lord
[1:07:37] in whom he also are builded together for
[1:07:41] a habitation of god through the spirit
[1:07:45] now notice in both these verses it talks
[1:07:47] about together together together
[1:07:51] one spirit that i see so much
[1:07:55] is i'm going to serve god my own way
[1:07:57] without the body
[1:08:00] i'm going to do what i want to do in my
[1:08:02] way
[1:08:03] and i understand
[1:08:05] that we are just a small part of a
[1:08:08] universal body called christ
[1:08:13] but you know what what happens in
[1:08:15] another church doesn't have anything to
[1:08:17] do with happening in this church
[1:08:22] and if i'm not in that church
[1:08:25] i am not needed
[1:08:27] in that church
[1:08:30] but if i'm in this church i'm needed in
[1:08:32] this church
[1:08:34] are you with me
[1:08:37] and we need to start holding ourselves
[1:08:38] responsible for what god has called us
[1:08:41] to do in this church
[1:08:44] i i hope this is okay amen
[1:08:46] you know i sure hope there's not one
[1:08:48] individual here that's thinking
[1:08:50] this whole sermon is everything he's
[1:08:53] saying it's directed right at me
[1:08:56] i don't know why he didn't tell me and
[1:08:58] he just you know preached something else
[1:09:00] but honestly this is for all of us
[1:09:03] this is for me
[1:09:04] this this is for me this is for me
[1:09:07] just as much as anybody probably more so
[1:09:10] i'm the one that's responsible
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:16] so
[1:09:17] we need the scripture says in whom
[1:09:19] though the building fitly framed
[1:09:21] together groweth
[1:09:23] into a holy temple unto the lord in whom
[1:09:25] the whole building together for a
[1:09:26] habitation of god through the spirit so
[1:09:29] god working through the spirit
[1:09:34] we're all working together to be the
[1:09:36] house of god
[1:09:40] i just have some some
[1:09:43] some thoughts i've been thinking about i
[1:09:45] wonder who here
[1:09:47] goes to this church maybe they're not
[1:09:48] even here sitting today
[1:09:51] but who is has the capability
[1:09:54] today to functioning
[1:09:57] as a body
[1:10:00] is that a good question
[1:10:02] to function as a body
[1:10:05] you know you can compare this with your
[1:10:07] family
[1:10:08] functioning as a family brothers and
[1:10:10] sisters mom and dads children
[1:10:14] it's easy to function as long as
[1:10:16] everybody's giving you what you want
[1:10:18] you're doing exactly what you want
[1:10:20] you're hearing what you want to hear
[1:10:23] it's easy to function
[1:10:25] but try eating your asparagus when you
[1:10:27] don't like asparagus you're broccoli
[1:10:30] try doing
[1:10:32] things
[1:10:34] working with somebody that's difficult
[1:10:39] no wonder
[1:10:40] who has the capability of helping
[1:10:42] someone who's actually out of the way
[1:10:48] someone who doesn't understand as much
[1:10:50] as you do
[1:10:53] someone who's
[1:10:55] who doesn't care about seeking god all
[1:10:56] they want to do is talk
[1:10:59] i wonder who has the capability
[1:11:01] in this church
[1:11:04] to help that body be together
[1:11:09] we're very good at identifying
[1:11:10] somebody's problem somebody's issue
[1:11:13] but are we capable of helping
[1:11:15] are we capable of building
[1:11:19] oh no the pastor do that the pastor will
[1:11:21] do that the past brother john oh is it
[1:11:24] is that what we read
[1:11:27] no
[1:11:28] we're all supposed to be working
[1:11:29] together
[1:11:32] we're all supposed to be looking for
[1:11:34] someone to help build
[1:11:36] not to take sides with us
[1:11:41] oh yeah we got some very strong opinion
[1:11:43] paper people
[1:11:46] god is looking
[1:11:48] for laborers
[1:11:50] for workers
[1:11:52] who care
[1:11:54] who care enough
[1:11:56] to function the way the scripture tells
[1:11:58] us we should function
[1:12:01] no no if god placed me here in this
[1:12:04] church
[1:12:05] for one
[1:12:06] year i know god would hold me
[1:12:09] accountable for the life that i would
[1:12:11] live here and the work that i would do
[1:12:13] in this church for one year
[1:12:16] i want you to think about that
[1:12:18] we want to get comfortable
[1:12:21] we as christians should never get
[1:12:22] comfortable
[1:12:24] our peace doesn't come from our flesh
[1:12:26] being comfortable
[1:12:27] our peace comes from god in the middle
[1:12:29] child's in the middle of tests in the
[1:12:31] middle whatever he has us to do we got
[1:12:33] peace because we're in the will of god
[1:12:40] how many can bear with one another
[1:12:43] who's got an arrogant spirit who knows
[1:12:45] how to handle that situation
[1:12:49] who knows how to restore someone who's
[1:12:52] been overtaken in a fault
[1:12:55] who knows how to get their hands dirty
[1:12:58] who knows how to function like a body of
[1:13:01] christ
[1:13:04] well brother john i i didn't know this
[1:13:06] is you i didn't know i was supposed to
[1:13:08] be doing this i thought you know this
[1:13:10] was for
[1:13:11] okay
[1:13:12] i want you to understand each and every
[1:13:14] one of you
[1:13:16] are in the body
[1:13:18] we've been baptized we've drank of the
[1:13:20] same spirit we should be doing the same
[1:13:22] works
[1:13:25] there's no excuses
[1:13:27] none
[1:13:28] it's time for us to leave wanting to
[1:13:30] step up
[1:13:32] determined to step up
[1:13:35] to look for a need to help
[1:13:37] not to sit there and
[1:13:39] be judgmental
[1:13:46] you know there are as we've seen there
[1:13:48] are people who are willing to labor
[1:13:52] god says if we don't labor we don't eat
[1:13:56] think about what god wants to do for you
[1:13:58] in your life amen think about your
[1:14:00] children your grandchildren your
[1:14:03] neighbors your finances
[1:14:06] your home
[1:14:07] god wants to bless you and see you
[1:14:09] prosper above all things
[1:14:11] even as your soul prospers
[1:14:14] we've got to put our we've got to put
[1:14:16] the word first
[1:14:19] the word first
[1:14:27] i wonder sometimes when god looks at us
[1:14:29] if he sees a dysfunctional
[1:14:32] body
[1:14:34] now tell you it's not because we haven't
[1:14:35] had the word
[1:14:39] we've had the word
[1:14:40] get me out of the way we've had a
[1:14:42] five-fold ministry here that gave us the
[1:14:44] word
[1:14:47] so we'll be without excuse right
[1:14:50] but i think sometimes
[1:14:53] we're going out of
[1:14:55] god's way
[1:14:56] into our way
[1:14:58] reverting back to doing our own life
[1:15:01] our own things you know
[1:15:03] we we've got time we make time did you
[1:15:06] know
[1:15:07] we make time for what we want
[1:15:11] now of course we don't have time to do
[1:15:14] everything that we want to do
[1:15:15] but we definitely make time for things
[1:15:17] we want
[1:15:19] may not be exactly right then but you
[1:15:21] know it's hard
[1:15:23] to make time for the lord
[1:15:26] i don't understand that we can get up
[1:15:28] every day because we go to work but we
[1:15:30] have a hard time getting up early to
[1:15:32] come to church
[1:15:35] we have a hard time getting our hands
[1:15:36] dirty
[1:15:37] to help somebody
[1:15:39] because we're just
[1:15:41] they don't listen to me anyways they
[1:15:42] don't agree with me they don't they want
[1:15:44] nothing
[1:15:47] is that is that what we would do with
[1:15:49] our
[1:15:50] children is that what we do we just kind
[1:15:53] of like i don't care
[1:15:54] we're the body of christ there are the
[1:15:57] christ in you ought to be loving the
[1:15:59] worst one amongst us
[1:16:01] the neediest one amongst us
[1:16:04] something inside should have such a
[1:16:07] compassion that you can't sit still in
[1:16:09] yourself amen
[1:16:13] i don't think i can understand where
[1:16:16] brother brandon says
[1:16:17] the sickest body i know is is the body
[1:16:19] of christ
[1:16:20] it makes sense
[1:16:23] it's too easy to
[1:16:25] jump on the internet and watch some
[1:16:28] bigger church who has just it a body
[1:16:31] that just flows so much better
[1:16:35] that's great i understand and i agree
[1:16:37] with you but you know what
[1:16:40] i was telling my wife this morning
[1:16:42] every one of us
[1:16:43] is going to stand before the lord and
[1:16:45] give an account
[1:16:49] now i don't think he's going to care at
[1:16:51] all how many sermons i watched
[1:16:56] what i agreed with or what i didn't
[1:16:58] agree with
[1:16:59] he will look and he will ask me to give
[1:17:01] an account of my life my time
[1:17:05] what i did
[1:17:08] and either either
[1:17:10] i'm going to multiply
[1:17:14] either i'm going to hear well done
[1:17:20] not how many sermons i listen to
[1:17:24] not what i thought was better or worse
[1:17:26] but how many times i got my hands dirty
[1:17:27] to go increase
[1:17:32] there's so much more we could be doing
[1:17:33] if we just had one ingredient
[1:17:36] more
[1:17:37] drinking more of the spirit of god
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:42] really getting serious with saying god
[1:17:44] fill me with the holy ghost
[1:17:48] i want you to know when you actually are
[1:17:50] helping somebody
[1:17:51] and yeah it may be a natural even a
[1:17:54] carnal thing getting them through at the
[1:17:56] point but god is building character in
[1:18:00] you when you're helping them
[1:18:02] because character is built
[1:18:04] in the middle trials and when you're
[1:18:06] dealing with somebody that's got an
[1:18:07] arrogant spirit or just don't care or is
[1:18:10] out of the way or don't want to listen
[1:18:11] to you it takes character to restore and
[1:18:14] help that person
[1:18:16] and god's building himself in you when
[1:18:18] you're actually just obeying the word
[1:18:21] it's through sanctification and
[1:18:22] obedience of this holy ghost that you've
[1:18:25] been elected to
[1:18:27] to bring forth the character of christ
[1:18:29] see we the things that we're wanting to
[1:18:31] get away from are the very things
[1:18:34] that god is coming for
[1:18:36] god's coming for that
[1:18:39] ephesians chapter 4 verse 1 says
[1:18:41] therefore the prisoner of the lord
[1:18:43] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:18:45] vocation wherewith you're called
[1:18:48] so we've been called unto good works
[1:18:50] right
[1:18:51] with his workmanship
[1:18:54] so let's let's let's take a look at of
[1:18:57] how we should be walking
[1:18:59] with all lowliness
[1:19:01] and meekness
[1:19:06] longsuffering
[1:19:07] forbearing one another in love
[1:19:11] working hard to keep unity
[1:19:13] some people don't even want to work at
[1:19:14] it
[1:19:17] and it's it's not your unity
[1:19:20] it's the unity of the spirit
[1:19:23] in the bond of peace i'll tell you what
[1:19:26] when you truly have the right spirit
[1:19:30] you don't ever have to worry what a
[1:19:32] person is going to do if they've got the
[1:19:35] right spirit what they're doing
[1:19:38] you don't have to worry
[1:19:40] it's only when they got the
[1:19:43] other spirit
[1:19:45] the spirit that
[1:19:46] we're born with it's a selfish spirit if
[1:19:49] i'm gonna be lord i'm gonna do i want my
[1:19:51] own popularity my own reputation i'm
[1:19:52] trying to build myself trying to get
[1:19:54] something out of this for me but you
[1:19:56] know we've been called
[1:19:59] to function as a body of christ
[1:20:02] together there's no room for me
[1:20:06] in christ
[1:20:08] that's why i have to die out to self
[1:20:11] so he can live through me
[1:20:13] we're not going to be a bunch of
[1:20:15] individuals
[1:20:20] we're going to have
[1:20:22] the nature of christ in heaven
[1:20:24] he is marrying someone without spot or
[1:20:26] wrinkle they're going to be just like
[1:20:28] him when we see him
[1:20:30] understand we're going to have our own
[1:20:31] personalities
[1:20:33] understand that
[1:20:35] because that's the way god made us but
[1:20:37] our character
[1:20:40] it's not our character
[1:20:41] it's his
[1:20:43] okay so there is one body one spirit
[1:20:47] even as you're called into one hope if
[1:20:48] you're calling one lord
[1:20:50] one faith one baptism one god father
[1:20:53] of all who is above all and through all
[1:20:55] and in you all sounds like we should be
[1:20:58] working together as one
[1:21:01] one
[1:21:02] one
[1:21:04] so whatever you say
[1:21:06] in christ
[1:21:07] it's good for all of us
[1:21:11] that's why we the scripture says be
[1:21:13] subject one to another
[1:21:16] how do you know what somebody's trying
[1:21:18] to tell you isn't from god
[1:21:23] you know we the last thing we want to do
[1:21:25] is have things figured out
[1:21:27] that's the last thing we want to do the
[1:21:28] first thing we want to do is humble
[1:21:30] ourselves before the lord amen
[1:21:32] amen so we should be working together as
[1:21:34] the body of christ as a family
[1:21:37] ephesians chapter 4
[1:21:39] verse 14. i need to hurry
[1:21:42] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:21:46] tossed to and fro
[1:21:49] you know what children are
[1:21:51] they just they're not paying attention
[1:21:53] they're going doing their own thing you
[1:21:55] got to constantly say don't do that
[1:21:57] don't go over there don't get into that
[1:21:59] it's time for dinner you know what i
[1:22:00] told you do your chores you know how
[1:22:02] children are
[1:22:04] they're just all over the place
[1:22:07] well to me a church that's all over the
[1:22:10] place
[1:22:11] is tossed
[1:22:12] to and fro
[1:22:14] i'm going to do my own thing i'm going
[1:22:15] to come when i want to come and
[1:22:17] no that ain't what god called us to that
[1:22:19] may be how it is but that ain't the true
[1:22:21] body of christ now understand understand
[1:22:25] this that we are in a church
[1:22:29] as brother branham said there's three
[1:22:30] types of believers in every church
[1:22:35] we can't do nothing about it
[1:22:38] and and jesus never told
[1:22:42] peter james and john
[1:22:44] to get the unbelievers out to get judas
[1:22:46] out
[1:22:47] he didn't do that
[1:22:50] because
[1:22:51] they're there for a reason
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:56] but the thing is
[1:22:57] will you be the one that shines is the
[1:23:00] light of christ
[1:23:01] will you be the one
[1:23:03] to get your hands dirty and help
[1:23:05] somebody
[1:23:07] because it's not behind the pulpit
[1:23:12] the body is is how it functions when it
[1:23:15] talks to one another when it interacts
[1:23:17] with one another when it prays for one
[1:23:19] another when it fellowships with one
[1:23:21] another when they ask one another to do
[1:23:24] things
[1:23:25] that's the body that's the functioning
[1:23:27] of the body
[1:23:29] we all have that same equal opportunity
[1:23:32] to pick up the phone and care about
[1:23:34] somebody
[1:23:36] to write a letter to care about somebody
[1:23:39] to invite somebody to church
[1:23:41] to care about somebody
[1:23:43] to think about those who haven't been at
[1:23:45] church you know we have some that are
[1:23:46] backslidden
[1:23:48] can you say amen
[1:23:50] it's the truth
[1:23:52] we have some that are out of the way
[1:23:54] but do we have a body that knows how to
[1:23:56] function with the situation or is it
[1:23:58] just the pastor's job
[1:24:01] i'm just asking is it
[1:24:07] i believe god wants us to start
[1:24:10] functioning
[1:24:11] together don't you
[1:24:14] all right it's fourth we don't wear
[1:24:16] children toss to and fro and carried
[1:24:18] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:24:19] sleight of men and the cunning
[1:24:21] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:24:23] deceive you know what that is i don't
[1:24:24] have to do that it's not my job
[1:24:27] doctrine that's what i live by we don't
[1:24:30] preach it but that doesn't mean satan
[1:24:32] don't preach it to us
[1:24:35] all right but speaking the truth in love
[1:24:38] why do i got to do that what's the
[1:24:40] purpose may grow up
[1:24:42] grow up
[1:24:44] into all things not just where you're at
[1:24:48] but the things that you're not at
[1:24:50] may grow up in all things
[1:24:52] which is the head even christ in other
[1:24:55] words
[1:24:56] jesus wants to be the lord of all of our
[1:24:59] life
[1:25:00] from whom the whole body now look at
[1:25:03] this
[1:25:04] fitly
[1:25:05] joined
[1:25:07] together
[1:25:11] compacted by
[1:25:13] that which every joint
[1:25:15] supplieth
[1:25:17] according to the effectual working and
[1:25:20] the measure of every part making
[1:25:22] increase
[1:25:24] of the body unto the edifying of itself
[1:25:28] in love
[1:25:30] i just got a question who is fulfilling
[1:25:32] that
[1:25:35] who's fulfilling it it's
[1:25:37] we've been
[1:25:38] called to it
[1:25:40] this is our calling
[1:25:42] this is what god is wanting in the
[1:25:45] church
[1:25:47] if we would just come together and pray
[1:25:49] and seek the lord
[1:25:54] god could move amongst i tell you this
[1:25:57] is a big this is a big thing
[1:26:00] but he didn't place this on the ministry
[1:26:04] this is the body
[1:26:06] this is the potty
[1:26:08] we need to go home and study this you
[1:26:10] got a sermon to preach
[1:26:12] you got a sermon to live
[1:26:15] you got a body to help you got you got
[1:26:17] to get fitly joined together
[1:26:20] you got to supply every joint we got a
[1:26:22] lot of joints you ever have a joint
[1:26:24] that's out of joint
[1:26:26] or stiff
[1:26:29] had a man minister tell me the other day
[1:26:31] says you know we're getting too old
[1:26:39] do we even care about getting some
[1:26:42] lubrication to a joint over here
[1:26:47] you know we get so
[1:26:49] consume
[1:26:51] with the same spirit we had before we
[1:26:53] came to christ
[1:26:55] the spirit of self
[1:26:58] my
[1:26:59] my life
[1:27:00] my personal goals
[1:27:03] too
[1:27:04] busy
[1:27:06] to give anything more
[1:27:08] to the body
[1:27:11] brother john this sermon is not
[1:27:14] encouraging me
[1:27:17] that's okay
[1:27:20] brother john this sermon doesn't make me
[1:27:21] like you
[1:27:23] that's okay too
[1:27:30] but i hope that you love god enough that
[1:27:33] you want to become this word amen
[1:27:38] because that's really that's all it's
[1:27:40] important that on the that we get to a
[1:27:42] place that we're we're functioning like
[1:27:45] we've seen in this video
[1:27:47] with a burden
[1:27:52] don't be satisfied for what you're doing
[1:27:54] in the church right now don't be
[1:27:55] satisfied with that
[1:27:57] i'm talking about
[1:27:59] giving to where there's a lacking
[1:28:02] it is
[1:28:04] i don't mean it wrong
[1:28:05] but playing anything that's up here
[1:28:07] playing instruments preaching leading
[1:28:10] songs all this that you do in front of
[1:28:12] somebody is much more enjoyable
[1:28:16] are you with me
[1:28:18] so what i'm speaking about in the church
[1:28:20] is something that's
[1:28:22] one on one
[1:28:24] with a need
[1:28:28] that's what a mature church
[1:28:32] is trying to work at
[1:28:37] looking
[1:28:38] how to help this
[1:28:40] part of the body fit together
[1:28:43] how to supply it
[1:28:45] how to bring an increase to the body how
[1:28:48] to edify it in love
[1:28:51] that's our goal
[1:28:54] this preaching
[1:28:57] doesn't do it
[1:28:59] you know what does it
[1:29:00] you take in the word and say that's me
[1:29:03] that's me i'm the body of christ i'm
[1:29:04] part of that body that's for me that
[1:29:07] word is for me i want him to be lord of
[1:29:10] my life in that area
[1:29:15] he hasn't called us to please herself
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:18] and i want to be a halfway converted
[1:29:20] believer
[1:29:23] you know there's certain there's certain
[1:29:25] individuals the only reason
[1:29:28] they
[1:29:28] want you
[1:29:30] is so they can get something out of you
[1:29:34] otherwise they don't spend any time
[1:29:36] trying to help you
[1:29:39] i don't want to be that
[1:29:44] it's true
[1:29:45] that as a christian we should give and
[1:29:48] not expect in return
[1:29:50] that's what christians do
[1:29:53] but every one of us
[1:29:55] should be doing that
[1:29:58] right and not taking advantage
[1:30:00] of one another
[1:30:03] we're not to take advantage of one
[1:30:04] another we're actually supposed to help
[1:30:06] one another
[1:30:09] that's the right spirit
[1:30:11] it's a giving spirit
[1:30:14] you know jfk said
[1:30:16] to the country
[1:30:18] don't ask what this country can do for
[1:30:20] you in other words give us more stimulus
[1:30:22] checks
[1:30:24] he said but the question should be what
[1:30:27] can you do for the country
[1:30:30] it's not all about
[1:30:32] what this church
[1:30:34] can do for you
[1:30:36] god brought you in this church to help
[1:30:38] the church
[1:30:40] don't worry he'll take care of you
[1:30:42] the word will take care of you
[1:30:44] the word will supply what you need
[1:30:47] but you've been called in here to help a
[1:30:49] body
[1:30:50] and if that's not your attitude that's
[1:30:52] not your spirit there's something wrong
[1:31:00] i don't want to be dysfunctional
[1:31:02] i don't want to be out of the way doing
[1:31:04] my own thing
[1:31:06] only time i've got time to help somebody
[1:31:08] or do something in the church is when i
[1:31:09] can get something out of it
[1:31:14] oh god free me of that thing
[1:31:18] free me of that thing
[1:31:20] i want to give my life to christ i want
[1:31:22] him to be lord of everything
[1:31:25] i want that revelation i want it for us
[1:31:28] let's try to get through this real quick
[1:31:29] first corinthians chapter 12 where we
[1:31:31] started verse number 12 for as the body
[1:31:34] is one we're one
[1:31:36] we're one
[1:31:38] we're one
[1:31:40] when one suffers we all suffer and all
[1:31:43] uh and many members and all the members
[1:31:45] of that one body being many are one body
[1:31:49] so also as christ for by one spirit we
[1:31:52] are all baptized into one body and we've
[1:31:57] all been made to drink into one
[1:32:00] spirit
[1:32:01] so
[1:32:03] take some time to just check about yours
[1:32:06] take some time make some some self
[1:32:09] inward
[1:32:10] look
[1:32:12] because that's how we get from where
[1:32:14] we're at to where he's calling us that's
[1:32:16] the only way we get there
[1:32:18] if we keep feeling we're there we're
[1:32:20] there we're doing enough it's not me
[1:32:22] it's somebody else you know i brought
[1:32:23] the pitchfork today
[1:32:27] where are we going to go
[1:32:29] look
[1:32:30] i i told i've said this so many times
[1:32:33] when i am not preaching anymore if i get
[1:32:36] kicked out of the church i'll tell you
[1:32:38] one thing you will never ever take
[1:32:40] christ away from me you will never take
[1:32:43] get me to a place where i will not live
[1:32:45] the rest of my life trying to help
[1:32:47] people i may falter i may fall i may do
[1:32:50] a lot of bad things but i'm going to get
[1:32:52] back up and i'm going to serve god until
[1:32:55] i'm dead and it's a decision i made i'm
[1:32:57] going to live for others
[1:32:59] because nothing else is more important
[1:33:01] than that
[1:33:02] nothing
[1:33:06] for if
[1:33:07] for the body is not one member but many
[1:33:11] if the foot shall say because i am not
[1:33:12] of the hand
[1:33:14] i am not of the hand i am not of the
[1:33:16] body
[1:33:17] is it therefore
[1:33:18] not of the body
[1:33:20] so it doesn't matter
[1:33:23] how we view one another we're still part
[1:33:25] of the body
[1:33:26] and if the ears shall say because i am
[1:33:29] not the eye i am not of the body
[1:33:32] is it therefore not of the body it's
[1:33:34] still of the body no matter what you
[1:33:36] think you are
[1:33:37] no matter how great you are or how least
[1:33:40] important you think you are you're still
[1:33:42] part of the body still must function the
[1:33:44] same way
[1:33:45] think about this you may not been
[1:33:47] serving the lord as long as other people
[1:33:51] it's not how long you've been serving
[1:33:52] the lord
[1:33:54] it's how mature you are
[1:33:57] you can get ahead of somebody so fast if
[1:33:59] you just get serious and give your heart
[1:34:00] to jesus christ let him be lord of
[1:34:03] everything and begin to live this word
[1:34:06] because you know there we got a lot of
[1:34:08] formality
[1:34:10] we got a lot of form
[1:34:12] i want to see the life and i'll tell you
[1:34:14] when i see it everybody will see it it's
[1:34:16] just
[1:34:17] it's just everybody sees the life
[1:34:21] if the whole body were the eye
[1:34:23] then where were the hearing if the whole
[1:34:25] we're hearing where were the smelling
[1:34:27] but now have god set the members every
[1:34:30] one of them in the body as it has
[1:34:32] pleased him
[1:34:33] and if it were all one member where
[1:34:36] would the body
[1:34:38] if the pastor's supposed to do it all
[1:34:41] what do we need the body for
[1:34:46] saints
[1:34:47] what is your responsibility
[1:34:51] what is it and because if you don't
[1:34:53] identify it how can you know if you met
[1:34:55] it
[1:34:57] only you
[1:34:58] can get serious with the lord amen
[1:35:01] how many times have you walked out of
[1:35:03] church and just being honest how many
[1:35:04] times have you walked out of the church
[1:35:06] and just thought
[1:35:09] i wasn't no that's not me that's not for
[1:35:11] me
[1:35:13] you know what i'm saying
[1:35:16] you've got to walk out of the church
[1:35:18] and say that's for me no matter how it
[1:35:21] feels
[1:35:23] it's only the way we grow
[1:35:26] if if we're not preaching the word here
[1:35:29] this is my best advice to you find a
[1:35:31] church that's preaching all the word
[1:35:34] and go there
[1:35:39] you don't want to stay in a church
[1:35:40] that's half half
[1:35:44] or even 90 10. i remember before i came
[1:35:47] to the lord and i was searching for
[1:35:49] a church
[1:35:52] i didn't even know this message
[1:35:55] but i remember on my bed as a teenager
[1:35:59] god
[1:36:01] i want to know the truth
[1:36:03] i knew there was only one truth there
[1:36:06] couldn't be two
[1:36:08] there had to be one and there was over
[1:36:10] 400 denominations at that time
[1:36:14] and when my priest
[1:36:16] told me
[1:36:19] that the pope has the power to change
[1:36:23] the word
[1:36:24] that was one of the most confusing
[1:36:26] things i ever heard
[1:36:28] i went and i saw god god i wanted
[1:36:32] the truth he was obviously calling me
[1:36:34] because something was in there that
[1:36:36] wanted the truth
[1:36:38] and i said god i don't care what church
[1:36:41] you want me to go to i'll go to any
[1:36:43] church you tell me to go but i need you
[1:36:45] to tell me which one has the truth
[1:36:49] and that's when god led me to brother
[1:36:51] johnson's church
[1:36:53] and i'll say it like this if this church
[1:36:57] doesn't have the truth find the one that
[1:36:59] does
[1:36:59] for you for your family for your soul
[1:37:02] but if it does then get underneath it
[1:37:04] get behind it give everything you got
[1:37:07] support the church support the pastor
[1:37:09] support everything it does get behind
[1:37:11] the things they're doing to reach out
[1:37:13] get behind the mission
[1:37:15] get behind everything
[1:37:19] don't have church be just
[1:37:22] for your natural flesh
[1:37:25] get behind it for the cause of christ
[1:37:27] because one day you understand
[1:37:29] we're all going to stand before the lord
[1:37:32] if this thing was real this thing called
[1:37:34] send the light here in fent was real
[1:37:36] we're all going to answer for it i'm
[1:37:38] going to answer for it the most the most
[1:37:39] i will
[1:37:42] that's a
[1:37:43] fearful thing that's a fearful thought
[1:37:44] for me i don't know how you feel but i
[1:37:46] don't want to stand before the lord
[1:37:47] without the blood of christ
[1:37:50] i know i've failed i know i've messed up
[1:37:56] yes by the grace of god if a righteous
[1:37:58] man falls seven times seven times he'll
[1:38:00] get back up he'll keep going
[1:38:02] but we're on a mission this we can't
[1:38:04] play church anymore we can't get caught
[1:38:06] up in laodicea we've got to start moving
[1:38:08] as a body
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:13] what verse are we in verse 20.
[1:38:17] but now they
[1:38:19] but now are they many members yet but
[1:38:22] one body and the eye cannot say to the
[1:38:24] hand i have no need of thee
[1:38:27] nor again the heads say to the feet i
[1:38:30] have no need of you nay much more of
[1:38:32] those members
[1:38:33] of the body which seem to be i can't
[1:38:36] really get nothing from them so you know
[1:38:40] what attitude
[1:38:44] they're they're necessary and we're
[1:38:46] going to find out
[1:38:47] they're more necessary
[1:38:51] and those members of the body which we
[1:38:53] think
[1:38:54] to be less honorable
[1:38:57] upon these
[1:39:01] we should be taking time
[1:39:03] to honor them
[1:39:07] not forget about them not not talk to
[1:39:09] them because we don't need them but go
[1:39:12] out of your way you know one thing
[1:39:14] there's some people that hardly know how
[1:39:16] to show appreciation
[1:39:18] to one another
[1:39:21] i'll tell you i'm
[1:39:23] as a pastor
[1:39:25] you know
[1:39:26] who's takes time to go out of the way
[1:39:29] to say thank you
[1:39:31] and to those
[1:39:33] it just they can't seem to find
[1:39:36] it
[1:39:37] you know what i'm saying
[1:39:40] the body i mean i am so thankful
[1:39:45] for every part of my body
[1:39:47] honestly i'm just be honest with you i
[1:39:49] wouldn't want to come up here with part
[1:39:51] of my body missing i wouldn't
[1:39:54] i'm thankful for every part of my body
[1:39:59] we should be thankful for one another
[1:40:01] for every part of the body no matter if
[1:40:04] it's
[1:40:05] the toe
[1:40:07] neither told we don't see it but
[1:40:08] honestly try walking without a toe
[1:40:10] you need it for balance
[1:40:12] with you you need a you don't when you
[1:40:15] talk when we talk to one another we're
[1:40:16] not staring at one another's backbone
[1:40:18] but our backbone is what holds us up
[1:40:21] and there's a lot to that backbone
[1:40:24] that's the prayers of the saints right
[1:40:26] there
[1:40:27] that's the that's the prayers of the
[1:40:29] saints that's that's what really makes
[1:40:31] the ministry what it should be
[1:40:35] all right
[1:40:39] which we think to be less honorable upon
[1:40:41] them we bestow more abundant honor and
[1:40:43] uncomely parts have more abundant
[1:40:46] cleanliness
[1:40:47] for our communist parts have no need but
[1:40:50] god have tempered the body together
[1:40:52] having given more abundant honor to that
[1:40:54] which
[1:40:54] part
[1:40:55] which lacked in other words
[1:40:58] no matter what you're going through
[1:41:00] god really cares about you
[1:41:03] that there should be no what oh my is
[1:41:06] that okay if i read this
[1:41:08] is it okay that there should be no
[1:41:11] schisms
[1:41:12] in the body do you know what that is
[1:41:16] what that is is me and ben
[1:41:19] and
[1:41:20] stan
[1:41:22] and donna
[1:41:24] we
[1:41:25] agree together
[1:41:27] we see that we you know we like click
[1:41:34] no matter
[1:41:37] if sister linda
[1:41:39] citra trish or brother mark
[1:41:42] don't see it
[1:41:46] no schisms in the body
[1:41:49] we ought to love one another
[1:41:52] exactly the same and if you got a
[1:41:54] problem with somebody get on your knees
[1:41:57] until god gives you a drink of that holy
[1:41:59] spirit till you can love everybody the
[1:42:01] same and you can put your arms around
[1:42:04] your brother you your you sisters put
[1:42:06] your arms around your sisters you know
[1:42:08] what i'm trying to say
[1:42:09] we got to get to a place where we're one
[1:42:12] one body one body no no isms that there
[1:42:16] should be no schisms in the body but
[1:42:19] that
[1:42:20] the members should have the same
[1:42:23] care
[1:42:25] care
[1:42:26] i don't get along with them they don't
[1:42:28] like me they're arrogant they're always
[1:42:30] like telling me how great they are
[1:42:32] they're you know they're always out of
[1:42:34] the way they
[1:42:35] they don't they don't care about seeking
[1:42:37] the lord
[1:42:39] do you see that excuse in there
[1:42:42] i don't know why we come up with them
[1:42:45] i don't know why we don't roll up our
[1:42:46] sleeves and just find a way to make it
[1:42:49] happen
[1:42:50] i don't know what you know god is
[1:42:52] calling us
[1:42:54] to maturity
[1:42:56] to grow up to be no more children just
[1:42:58] tossed over here with this ism tossed
[1:43:00] over here with that schism
[1:43:04] find something that needs to be done in
[1:43:06] the body
[1:43:09] don't wait to be asked
[1:43:13] you get in your prayer room god will
[1:43:15] play something on your heart
[1:43:17] i'd rather see you try to do something
[1:43:19] and fail
[1:43:23] you know we've been spending i think as
[1:43:25] nine weeks now in the music
[1:43:27] have music music musician meetings we
[1:43:30] haven't had musician meetings on a
[1:43:32] regular basis
[1:43:33] the time of the whole church we tried
[1:43:36] try devil didn't want it
[1:43:40] and i'm not saying we've improved like
[1:43:42] such gang busters that they're coming
[1:43:44] from the east and the west
[1:43:46] [Laughter]
[1:43:49] but i'm so proud
[1:43:51] of our song leaders
[1:43:53] i'm so proud of them
[1:43:57] so proud of my my wife and ann
[1:44:00] i don't care how much we fail
[1:44:02] there is such improvement we're going in
[1:44:04] the right direction
[1:44:06] and that's what it takes
[1:44:08] fail but try fail but try
[1:44:11] because
[1:44:12] god's going to look at you one day and
[1:44:14] he's going to say well done
[1:44:16] well done thou good and what
[1:44:21] not perfect
[1:44:24] faithful
[1:44:26] all right let's try to finish this up
[1:44:28] that there be no schisms and and whether
[1:44:30] one member suffer all the members suffer
[1:44:33] or one member be honored all the members
[1:44:35] rejoice with it
[1:44:37] you know do you ever have that
[1:44:41] don't want to say anything
[1:44:43] because i don't want you know them to
[1:44:44] get a big head
[1:44:47] you know i just i'm gonna calm it down
[1:44:50] so i'm not gonna hey just follow the
[1:44:51] word it's not your job to stop somebody
[1:44:54] from getting a big head
[1:44:57] just honor the word
[1:44:59] honor the word obey the word
[1:45:03] now ye are the body of christ and
[1:45:05] members in particular and god has set
[1:45:07] some in the church
[1:45:09] apostles prophets teachers miracles
[1:45:12] after that miracles gifts healings helps
[1:45:15] government divers and tongues now are
[1:45:17] they all pastors they'll probably say do
[1:45:19] i teach all the working miracles no no
[1:45:21] no no
[1:45:23] but coveted earnestly the best of gifts
[1:45:28] because they're needed for the
[1:45:29] functioning of the body
[1:45:33] brother branham did say
[1:45:36] if i could only have one thing in the
[1:45:38] church i'd want to be the love of god
[1:45:40] i'd rather have that than all the gifts
[1:45:44] we got that
[1:45:45] we got access to that
[1:45:47] you you
[1:45:48] i i couldn't speak in tongues if i
[1:45:51] wanted to
[1:45:53] i couldn't prophesy if i wanted to
[1:45:56] i couldn't go to something and heal him
[1:45:57] if i wanted to
[1:46:01] but i can't yield to love
[1:46:04] i can't give my life for another that's
[1:46:06] my choice
[1:46:08] god gave me that choice
[1:46:12] let's stand together i want to read this
[1:46:14] quote
[1:46:15] and we're going to
[1:46:17] have a word of prayer
[1:46:19] amen
[1:46:21] brother branham said this
[1:46:22] it says if i do
[1:46:24] things wrong
[1:46:26] he said this in the message faith
[1:46:29] in the son of god
[1:46:30] he says i don't aim to
[1:46:32] god be merciful to me
[1:46:34] for i try to do all that i know
[1:46:38] how
[1:46:39] to help
[1:46:40] his people
[1:46:43] i love him
[1:46:44] i know that he holds
[1:46:46] all the future and whatever mind shall
[1:46:48] be
[1:46:49] it's in his hands
[1:46:51] now this is what he said so he said each
[1:46:53] day
[1:46:54] i want to live
[1:46:56] not for myself
[1:46:58] each day each day not just church days
[1:47:01] each day
[1:47:02] if i live for myself
[1:47:05] i live a selfish life
[1:47:08] i want to live for others
[1:47:11] oh
[1:47:12] i love
[1:47:14] the word i love the prophet i love what
[1:47:16] he brought
[1:47:18] i want to live for others
[1:47:20] and give what strength i have
[1:47:23] not to myself
[1:47:25] and to my own pleasure
[1:47:28] but for the benefit of others
[1:47:31] that'll build the kingdom of god
[1:47:34] is that your desire
[1:47:36] you pray with me
[1:47:37] our heavenly father we come to you at
[1:47:40] this moment hearing your word lord we
[1:47:42] heard
[1:47:43] your word
[1:47:45] and certainly lord you have challenged
[1:47:47] us
[1:47:49] to grow up
[1:47:51] and every one of us in areas perhaps
[1:47:53] that we don't think about
[1:47:56] need maturing
[1:47:59] lord i'm so grateful
[1:48:01] that you have called us
[1:48:03] to be one body
[1:48:05] not to be separate
[1:48:07] not to have certain camps or isms
[1:48:11] not to even speak things that
[1:48:15] would divide
[1:48:17] but lord you've called us
[1:48:20] to endeavor to keep the unity of the
[1:48:22] spirit
[1:48:24] and father
[1:48:26] i pray for those
[1:48:28] lord who have that willing heart
[1:48:32] that willingness to let you be lord of
[1:48:34] all their life
[1:48:37] that you would continue to unfold
[1:48:40] to each of them
[1:48:42] how they
[1:48:44] can better edify the body of christ
[1:48:50] when they're in their prayer closet when
[1:48:51] they're driving down the road
[1:48:54] lord if it's in their heart they want it
[1:48:56] i pray that you would begin to show them
[1:48:59] bless our church lord
