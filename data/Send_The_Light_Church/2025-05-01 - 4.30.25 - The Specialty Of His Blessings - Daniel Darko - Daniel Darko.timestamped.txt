[21:38] that we have our brother once again with
[21:40] us uh this
[21:42] Wednesday. Things didn't work out where
[21:44] he was going to go. So, we have the
[21:46] opportunity to uh have our brother back
[21:49] and uh so we just changed the service
[21:52] from a prayer service to a regular
[21:54] service. And um but continue to pray um
[21:58] for all those that the Lord would put on
[22:01] your heart. and
[22:04] um just receive what uh I believe this
[22:08] is a special occasion. So, let's just I
[22:10] believe God has something special for us
[22:12] if we can just believe by faith that
[22:14] he's for us. Amen. So, let's just pray
[22:17] be praying on that uh behalf. Also,
[22:21] um uh our men's meeting was a little bit
[22:25] smaller today. some of the young uh boys
[22:29] uh men that were coming uh one has a
[22:31] little bit of a
[22:34] resistance. He's I I truly believe when
[22:37] you your heart is going towards the
[22:41] Lord. Anybody that's been seeking the
[22:45] Lord knows that all hell comes against
[22:48] you. The gates of hell come against you.
[22:50] But if he's truly seeking the Lord, I I
[22:54] truly believe he'll be
[22:56] delivered. So, we just pray for uh him
[23:01] and
[23:02] um uh all the other boys that
[23:06] are trying
[23:08] to, you know, figure it out what's God
[23:11] about and all they have to do is just
[23:14] seek him. So, we just pray that they
[23:16] just seek them and God opens their eyes.
[23:19] So, let's just remember them. Also,
[23:22] Brother Marty, I don't see him tonight.
[23:24] Obviously, he's still in pain. So, let's
[23:27] just remember him in prayer. Uh, let's
[23:30] remember uh
[23:31] uh Brotherh Bruce and Sister Don as they
[23:35] travel. Uh let's remember all Let's pray
[23:38] for the uh memorial service for Friday.
[23:42] Um oh, Saturday, I'm sorry. Yeah,
[23:44] Saturday. And if there's any I I believe
[23:48] uh we're going to try to go down there.
[23:50] So if anybody's desiring to go down
[23:53] there, don't have a ride, just let me
[23:55] know. And uh I believe uh you'll be
[24:00] blessed. Fact, I would say I know you'll
[24:03] be blessed. So uh just let and the
[24:06] instructions and everything are out on
[24:08] the board in the back. So let's just
[24:10] remember that. Also, uh Keith and uh uh
[24:14] Linda have a request. Uh our son Josh is
[24:17] having a possible uh significant medical
[24:21] problem. He has been coming to the Lord
[24:25] uh the last few years. Uh we are
[24:28] thankful. So let's just remember uh him
[24:31] in prayer. That's her son. and
[24:35] um that God can use this opportunity
[24:41] um sometimes in our life when we don't
[24:44] we're scared and we don't know what to
[24:46] do um that's time to turn towards God. I
[24:49] mean you should be turning towards God
[24:51] on a daily basis but a lot of times that
[24:55] which really pushes us to turn towards
[24:57] God. So we pray that God would use this
[24:59] opportunity to uh reveal himself
[25:03] Amen.
[25:05] Um let's also Oh, and uh we've had our
[25:09] brother over was staying with us for uh
[25:12] past few days. He had a request on his
[25:15] heart. Um his dad has some property
[25:20] that's uh I don't know a little bit
[25:22] aways from him. About an hour away I
[25:24] think is some land and he wants to uh
[25:28] start trying to farm it. So it would be
[25:31] his desire to uh do that so that he
[25:36] could help you know in the people there.
[25:40] Um everybody needs help especially over
[25:44] there you know to to help uh in the

[32:33] was supposed to happen like we planned.

[32:37] and let's just get behind our brother as
[32:39] he delivers the word to us and sing only
[32:43] believe as our brother comes to give us
[32:45] the word of life
[32:47] today.

[34:03] together again this evening. Amen.
[34:05] Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads for a
[34:08] word of prayer.
[34:12] our savior and our God. We thank you
[34:14] this evening Lord
[34:16] Jesus. We bless your name father for
[34:19] being so good oh Lord to us giving us
[34:23] this day with life and strength in
[34:28] us. Father you've led us oh Lord into
[34:31] our daily
[34:32] chores and once again you've made us to
[34:35] find time to come into your presence. We
[34:38] agree with Peter. He said,
[34:41] "Oh, to where shall we go?" Amen. There
[34:46] is nowhere, oh father, that your sons
[34:49] and daughters will be happy, be free,
[34:52] will be
[34:53] delivered than to come to your presence.
[34:57] That is why we're so appreciative this
[34:59] evening that you have given us another
[35:01] time of gathering, Lord, to have
[35:04] fellowship around your word. Help us, oh
[35:07] God, and see us through safe and
[35:09] successfully. I commit myself into your
[35:11] mighty hands, oh Lord. Lord, Father, let
[35:14] something pass through me, to your
[35:16] children, oh Father, Lord, that all may
[35:19] lift their faith to a higher ground. I
[35:22] pray, oh Lord, that let your word go and
[35:24] let it be accomp let it accomplish what
[35:26] you have sent it for to the glory of thy
[35:29] name. We thank you and we bless you in
[35:32] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[35:35] God bless every one of us. Um, greetings
[35:39] from brother Gabriel Toari to every one
[35:43] of you. Amen. Uh, please before we sit,
[35:49] I want us to read our scripture for this
[35:52] evening.
[35:58] We are reading
[36:01] Habac chapter
[36:10] 2 from verse 1 to
[36:16] 4. I will stand upon my watch and set me
[36:21] upon the
[36:22] tower and will watch to see what he will
[36:27] say unto me and what I shall answer when
[36:31] I am
[36:32] reproved. And the Lord answered me and
[36:35] said, "Write the vision and make it
[36:38] plain upon the upon tables that he may
[36:42] run that readth it." For the
[36:45] vision is yet for an appointed
[36:49] time, but at the end it shall speak and
[36:53] not
[36:53] lie. Though it
[36:56] tight for it, because it will surely
[37:02] come, it will not tarry. Behold, his
[37:05] soul which is lifted up is not upright
[37:08] in him, but the just shall live by his
[37:12] faith. Hallelujah. Let's also turn to
[37:19] Jeremiah. Jeremiah chapter
[37:28] 29. Jeremiah chapter 29 and verse
[37:36] 11-4. For I know the thoughts that I
[37:39] think toward you, sayeth the Lord,
[37:42] thought of peace and not of evil, to
[37:45] give you an expected
[37:48] end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye
[37:51] shall go and pray unto me, and I will
[37:54] hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me
[37:58] and find me when ye shall search for me
[38:01] with all your hearts. and I will be
[38:03] found of you, sayeth the Lord, and I
[38:06] will turn away your captivity, and I
[38:09] will gather you from all the nations and
[38:11] from all the places whether I have
[38:13] driven you, seeth the Lord, and I will
[38:16] bring you again into the place when I
[38:19] cause you to be carried away captive.
[38:23] Let's read our last scripture.
[38:27] Ephesians Ephesians chapter
[38:29] [Music]
[38:35] 1 Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3 and 4.
[38:40] Blessed be the God and father of our
[38:42] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[38:45] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[38:47] places in Christ according as he has
[38:51] chosen us in him before the foundation
[38:53] of the world that we should be holy and
[38:56] without blame before him in love. The
[39:00] Lord adds blessing to the reading of his
[39:02] word. Amen. Let's please take our seat.
[39:08] God bless every one of us. Amen. Yes.
[39:11] When I say that, I expect you to say
[39:13] amen. Amen. If you don't say amen, it
[39:16] means you don't like God's blessings.
[39:19] You understand? So when I say God bless
[39:22] you, I want to hear amen from you. Amen.
[39:25] That's it. Hallelujah. Well, it's good
[39:29] that we are together again. Um I didn't
[39:32] know that I'll be here, but God made it,
[39:34] you know. Thank you, Lord. possible
[39:37] because I have to be with uh brother
[39:39] Gabriel but things didn't go as we
[39:42] planned but uh you know there is
[39:44] something that the Bible made us to be
[39:47] aware that God have already designed
[39:49] everything according to his own purpose
[39:52] so sometimes it is not what we think but
[39:56] it is what God deem fit. Amen.
[39:58] Hallelujah. So we are so happy that we
[40:01] are together again. Amen.
[40:04] Well, this evening my topic is
[40:07] specialtity of his
[40:10] blessings. Specialtity of his blessings.
[40:13] You know when God is going to
[40:16] bless is not ordinary.
[40:19] Amen. Yeah. His blessings are always
[40:24] special. And the specialtity of that
[40:28] blessing, we don't work for it and we
[40:32] don't plan for it.
[40:35] Like we said last Sunday about the
[40:39] introduction of the
[40:41] supernatural, you have to accept it
[40:44] before it will be made manifest in your
[40:47] life. Because without you accepting it,
[40:50] it can manifest.
[40:53] So anything that the Lord does in the
[40:57] life of his
[40:59] people, there has to be an acceptance at
[41:02] a point before God's word can be made
[41:06] manifest in the life of the believer.
[41:10] Amen.
[41:11] Now so we see that when we are talking
[41:14] about
[41:15] specialtity it means
[41:17] something
[41:19] distinguished you know something that is
[41:21] not
[41:23] ordinary that is why it is called
[41:25] special something unique.
[41:30] Hallelujah. You see something that you
[41:35] can you can look at it and
[41:38] admire and say whoa what a thing. It is
[41:44] unique in its
[41:46] form. So therefore you give a great
[41:49] value to
[41:51] that and that is what God does in the
[41:53] life of all his children. Amen.
[41:56] Many times we pray to the Lord and we we
[41:59] expect instant results.
[42:03] Oh Lord Jesus I want
[42:06] this. We looking forward that poor it
[42:08] should it should
[42:11] appear. But you see many times God don't
[42:15] work like that way. There are some some
[42:18] instances that you pray and im God will
[42:21] give the you know answer immediately.
[42:24] But there are others also it doesn't go
[42:26] that way. And as we have established it
[42:29] depend upon what God thought is about
[42:33] that particular request.
[42:37] Whatever God thought is about that
[42:39] particular request that is how he's
[42:42] going to made it
[42:44] manifest. So therefore he said our
[42:47] thoughts are not his according to what
[42:49] Jeremiah told us you know in the word of
[42:52] God.
[42:54] of which every believer wish that oh
[42:57] whatever I ask the Lord instantly it it
[43:00] should
[43:02] come. Sometimes uh you you come you know
[43:05] in confrontation with perhaps
[43:07] unbelievers or or some colleagues and uh
[43:11] you wish that something happened for
[43:13] them to see the power of God. Is that
[43:17] Yes. You you you think that something
[43:19] should happen right now like how God
[43:22] broke the earth and push all the
[43:24] unbelievers in in the presence of Moses.
[43:27] Sometimes we think that something like
[43:29] that should happen to the unbelievers on
[43:30] the street. But that that's not how God
[43:32] is thinking about
[43:33] it. Praise the name of our God. So we
[43:36] have to
[43:37] rely on God's own time. And once we rely
[43:42] on God's stone time, when that thing
[43:44] come into our life, then it becomes so
[43:48] special. It comes so special with great
[43:52] value. Hallelujah. Let's read
[43:56] up Isaiah and come back. I want to take
[44:00] a note
[44:03] there. Isaiah chapter 55.
[44:14] chapter 55 and I think verse
[44:16] 9, he said, "For as the heavens are
[44:20] higher than the earth, so are my ways
[44:24] higher than
[44:25] yours." Okay, let me take it again. For
[44:27] as the heavens are higher than the
[44:29] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[44:32] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[44:38] So our thoughts and the thought of God
[44:40] concerning our life can never be
[44:44] equal. God's thoughts are higher than
[44:47] our thoughts. That is why we should
[44:50] never live in our own
[44:53] understanding. But we should always rely
[44:56] on God's word and for that matter the
[45:00] purpose of God for our
[45:03] lives. Amen. So now in bringing it back
[45:08] to
[45:09] link with that of
[45:15] Jeremiah, let's link it again with that
[45:18] of
[45:20] Jeremiah and catch it somewhere.
[45:23] Jeremiah 29 again we are reading
[45:28] it then verse 11.
[45:37] He said, "For I know the thought that I
[45:40] think toward you, sayeth the
[45:44] Lord. I know the thought that I think
[45:47] toward you. I am very happy that God
[45:49] have a thought about me." Amen.
[45:53] He told Jeremiah, "Before you were even
[45:55] formed in the womb of your mother, I
[45:56] knew you and I ordained you a prophet."
[46:01] So it was not anything Jeremiah
[46:03] did in his own in his own strength on
[46:07] his own thoughts but it was God it was
[46:10] what God have ordained him to
[46:13] be on
[46:15] earth. Hallelujah.
[46:17] He said for I know the thought that I
[46:20] think toward you say the Lord thought of
[46:22] peace and not of evil to give you an
[46:24] expected
[46:25] end. An expected end. Then shall ye call
[46:29] upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto
[46:33] me, and I will hearken unto
[46:36] you. And ye shall seek me and find me
[46:40] when you shall search for me with all
[46:42] your
[46:44] heart. Not some part of your but all
[46:47] your heart. Total surrender. and I will
[46:50] be found of you, sayeth the Lord, and
[46:53] will turn away your captivity, and I
[46:55] will gather you from all the nations and
[46:57] from all the places whether I have
[46:58] driven you, sayeth the Lord. Whatever
[47:00] the situation will put you, God will
[47:03] bring you back, and I will bring you
[47:06] again into the place when I cause you to
[47:08] be carried away
[47:10] captive. And this is why we love the
[47:14] predestination of
[47:16] God. And no child of
[47:21] God will lose his
[47:23] position. Every child of God have his or
[47:26] her position in Christ Jesus. And no one
[47:30] will take your
[47:33] position unless you are you are not part
[47:35] to begin with. But if you are part of
[47:38] it, nobody will take your position. Now
[47:42] let us look it this way. When
[47:44] Abraham was called by God and God said
[47:47] that Abraham, I'm going to bless you.
[47:50] You are going to be a father of nations.
[47:52] And when Abraham himself knew
[47:55] that his wife was
[47:57] barren and they were stricken in
[48:01] age and so therefore there was nothing
[48:04] like
[48:05] possibility which of course was the mind
[48:08] of Abraham because if you read Genesis
[48:11] carefully there was a point when God
[48:14] told Abraham about this promise. The
[48:16] Bible say that Abraham fell down on put
[48:19] his face on the ground and he laughed
[48:21] within his
[48:22] heart. Hallelujah. And he was asking
[48:25] himself so many questions. He said my
[48:27] wife is old and I'm old. I mean how how
[48:31] can it be
[48:32] possible? But surprisingly God didn't
[48:35] rebuke Abraham. God didn't ask Abraham
[48:38] anything. It was not that God didn't
[48:41] know what Abraham was thinking within
[48:44] him.
[48:46] If you ask me why, I don't know
[48:49] why. But when
[48:52] Sarah one day also laugh by that same
[48:57] comment from God, God asks a question.
[49:01] He said, "Why did Sarah
[49:04] laugh?" Amen. So you see the way God
[49:08] thinks about us.
[49:11] the life of God. He has already shared
[49:15] it among his people. And the Lord knows
[49:18] how to go with brother John. The Lord
[49:22] knows how to go with brother Daniel. The
[49:24] Lord now has to go with sister Trish and
[49:27] everybody. Brother, everyone God knows
[49:30] the way and manner he is moving with
[49:32] you.
[49:35] Therefore, anything God have
[49:37] decided about you in
[49:40] particular, nothing can change
[49:43] it. Hallelujah. Nothing can change it.
[49:47] The only thing you have to do is to
[49:50] continue in the vision of
[49:53] God. Whatever God thought is about you,
[49:57] accept it and move with it. No matter
[50:01] any challenge that comes your way,
[50:04] sometimes you found yourself in certain
[50:07] situation and it will completely
[50:09] discourage you as a Christian. But then
[50:13] don't be
[50:14] discouraged. Just stand upon the
[50:16] promises of
[50:18] God. Habac said the vision is for an
[50:21] appointed time. Even though it's utari,
[50:25] wait for
[50:26] it for it shall surely come. Surely come
[50:31] and God words does not
[50:34] fail. How long is going to come, I don't
[50:38] know, but I'll wait for it because I
[50:41] want to walk in the vision of God. I
[50:43] want to walk in the promises of God. I
[50:46] want to take the special blessings that
[50:48] God have put on my way. Hallelujah. You
[50:53] need
[50:54] concentration. You need patience. You
[50:57] need
[50:58] love to wait on
[51:00] God. Amen. But you
[51:03] see it went that way and as if it was
[51:08] not going to happen. But Abraham had
[51:11] faith in the Lord. After all, he knew
[51:16] that the Lord called him out of
[51:19] unbelief and the Lord have led him
[51:22] throughout so many
[51:24] obstacles and always there was victory
[51:28] on his side. So surely if the Lord said
[51:31] that he's going to bring forth a son, he
[51:33] has to continue to believe
[51:36] it. But as human it came to a point then
[51:41] the wife Sarah
[51:43] wanted to go, you know, ahead of God and
[51:47] she suggested that why don't you take my
[51:50] mate and raise up children because the
[51:54] Lord have closed my
[51:58] womb. Sarah thought that he could she
[52:01] could help God. No, you can't help God.
[52:04] God don't need any help from you.
[52:06] Hallelujah. God don't need any help from
[52:08] you. Sarah thought her she was going to
[52:10] help God, but God said, "No, that is not
[52:14] the
[52:17] heir. I didn't raise
[52:19] Hagar to bring the heir into the home of
[52:23] Abraham." He said, "Your wife Sarah will
[52:26] bring forth a
[52:28] son." And we all saw what
[52:32] happened. In fact, like the prophet
[52:34] demonstrated it. He said
[52:36] Abraham will go to the shop even though
[52:39] he has not seen any sign of it coming
[52:42] but he will go to the shop because he
[52:44] took God's word. He accepted God's word.
[52:46] He will go to the shop and begin to buy
[52:49] you know the items that they will use
[52:52] for the child when he was
[52:55] born. He kept preparing himself like how
[52:58] we are preparing ourselves today to meet
[53:01] the Lord Jesus Christ. One of these days
[53:03] we are in preparation.
[53:06] Abraham prepared
[53:08] himself and he will ask he will ask
[53:11] Sarah darling how do you feel? Then he
[53:15] said
[53:17] well the old story is the same way. You
[53:21] come back and ask the same story but one
[53:23] day when Abraham asked that question
[53:27] there was a positive answer.
[53:30] He said no my husband today I feel
[53:33] different within me. I think something
[53:36] has taken place. I think the promise of
[53:39] God have started in fulfillment.
[53:42] Hallelujah. Let's wait for it now.
[53:45] Within no time everybody saw that Sarah
[53:49] was
[53:50] pregnant and that long awaited promised
[53:55] child Isaac was delivered.
[53:59] And that became a special
[54:05] blessing. So long as the faith of
[54:08] Abraham was
[54:10] concerned, Isaac became a special
[54:12] blessing. And we all know how the Lord
[54:15] dealt with
[54:16] Isaac until
[54:19] even at his youthful stage, God came
[54:22] back and said that take that son that I
[54:24] promise
[54:25] you, go and sacrifice
[54:28] him. Wow.
[54:32] Again,
[54:34] Abraham stood in his
[54:39] faith and he paid his son Isaac and he
[54:43] told the
[54:44] wife,
[54:46] "I and the
[54:48] Lord, we are going to
[54:50] sacrifice and then we'll come
[54:53] back." Hallelujah.
[54:57] I and the lad we are going to sacrifice
[55:00] and will come back. But indeed Abraham
[55:04] knew that he was going to kill the boy
[55:08] and use him as a sacrifice unto the
[55:12] Lord. But he did not tell the wife that
[55:16] this is the situation. He said I and the
[55:20] boy we are going to do a sacrifice and
[55:22] we'll come back. That was the mind of
[55:26] God because the mind of God was that
[55:30] Abraham was not going to kill
[55:34] Isaac. Okay, that was the mind of God.
[55:38] So when they got to that place and Isaac
[55:41] asked his father, "Father, I have been
[55:43] sacrificing with you for some time now
[55:46] and whenever we are going to sacrifice,
[55:48] we take the lamp, we take uh the fire
[55:52] and today I see all those item but I
[55:55] don't see any lamp. Where is the
[55:59] lamp?" That was a question Isaac asked
[56:02] his
[56:04] father. And Abraham said, "My son, God
[56:08] will provide himself a
[56:10] sacrifice." It was a prophecy. It was
[56:14] God speaking through Abraham. Because
[56:16] what was going on, it was not the mind
[56:19] of Abraham, but it was the mind of God.
[56:23] Lo and
[56:25] behold, Abraham told Isaac that the Lord
[56:27] will provide himself a lamb. But before
[56:29] Isaac realized he has been tied and
[56:33] placed upon the
[56:34] altar and Abraham reached for the knife
[56:37] and was going to strike his son
[56:39] Isaac. Then he heard a voice, "Abraham,
[56:43] Abraham, do no harm to the
[56:45] child. But now I
[56:48] know that you respect me. Now I know
[56:51] that you believe in me. Now I know that
[56:54] you fear me."
[56:56] Look around you there in the ticket
[56:59] there is a lamb. Take him and do the
[57:02] sacrifice. Hallelujah. Abraham told
[57:06] Sarah that I and a child we are going to
[57:09] do sacrifice and come
[57:12] back. And so because it was the mind of
[57:16] God that they will go and come back, God
[57:20] made sure that it will
[57:22] manifest. Hallelujah. But the ordinary
[57:25] Abraham, you see, the ordinary Abraham
[57:28] didn't think that way. The ordinary
[57:30] Abraham knew that Isaac was not going to
[57:33] come
[57:34] back. But the good Abraham knew that
[57:39] Isaac was going to come back. That is
[57:41] why Abra Abraham told Sarah that I and a
[57:46] child we are going to sacrifice and come
[57:48] back.
[57:49] And then after that we saw what God used
[57:54] Isaac to do in the house of
[57:57] Abraham. Hallelujah. Now when Isaac grew
[58:02] old and then he also find himself in a
[58:05] marriage with
[58:08] Rebecca, it was the same issues the same
[58:10] way. It took some time before Rebecca
[58:13] also got
[58:15] pregnant. And when Rebecca got
[58:18] pregnant, the Bible says that he went to
[58:21] see a man of God, a prophet, because
[58:24] there was kind of commotion in her
[58:27] womb. And then she was told that look,
[58:31] there are two nations in
[58:35] you, and the elder shall serve the
[58:41] younger. Whoa. How can it be possible?
[58:45] Well, that was a prophecy of God to
[58:48] Rebecca and was no time then Rebecca
[58:51] brought forth this boys, this Jacob and
[58:56] Esau. Can you imagine? The Bible says
[58:58] that when Esau
[59:02] came and Jacob
[59:05] followed, they saw that Jacob was
[59:07] holding the
[59:09] heel of Esau.
[59:11] In fact, he was beating him in the womb
[59:14] of the mother. He was harassing him in
[59:17] the womb of the mother because a
[59:19] prophecy has come that the
[59:21] younger shall overrule the
[59:26] elder. You see, and God's word must
[59:29] always be made manifest no matter the
[59:32] condition, no matter what who believe or
[59:35] who don't believe. Hallelujah. Because
[59:37] like we say that any unbelief cannot
[59:40] stop God in
[59:43] acting. No, no unbelief can stop God in
[59:45] acting. Whether you believe it or not,
[59:48] God don't care about that. What God know
[59:51] is to make his his power to be made
[59:54] manifest. Yours could be something else.
[59:58] But in all, God is looking at the
[1:00:00] thought and vision he has for
[1:00:03] you. Hallelujah. God is looking to the
[1:00:06] vision and thought that he has for you.
[1:00:08] So Isaac, I'm sorry, Rebecca, when he
[1:00:12] brought forth and this children
[1:00:15] grew, the one
[1:00:17] day, one day, uh, the Bible says that
[1:00:21] when Isaac was old and his eyes could
[1:00:25] not see well and and all that and he was
[1:00:30] he was someone that really
[1:00:33] loved when Esau, his son, will make a a
[1:00:38] soup Uh what do we call it? Uh broth
[1:00:40] without a venison. He enjoyed it. He
[1:00:44] like it. You understand? He like it.
[1:00:48] Like I like it. Everybody like
[1:00:51] food. Hallelujah. Oh yes. If you don't
[1:00:55] like food then you have to see the
[1:00:56] doctor. Okay. There might be something
[1:00:58] wrong with you. Are are you catching
[1:01:01] what I mean? So So
[1:01:03] Isaac love that. So the Bible say that
[1:01:07] because of that he has some kind of love
[1:01:10] for his son
[1:01:12] Esau. Look at this. I want you to check
[1:01:14] this thing. Isaac loved Esau because of
[1:01:18] the
[1:01:19] food. But Rebecca loved Jacob because of
[1:01:25] the word of
[1:01:27] God. So one day Isaac told his son Esau
[1:01:31] that my son I am old. I want to pour
[1:01:35] blessings upon you. Go therefore and do
[1:01:39] as you have been doing always. Find me a
[1:01:41] deer and prepare you know that kind of
[1:01:44] soup for me. Let me eat and let my soul
[1:01:47] rejoice and I will bless
[1:01:50] you. So Esau rushed to the
[1:01:54] bush. Then Rebecca heard all these
[1:01:56] things. Then he called she called her
[1:01:59] she called his son Jacob said Jacob
[1:02:02] come. This is what I've heard your
[1:02:04] father telling your brother. I will not
[1:02:07] let that blessing go to
[1:02:10] Esau. I will not the blessing to come
[1:02:12] onto you because that is the promise
[1:02:15] that God promised
[1:02:17] me. Come on, go and fetch me a kid. I'll
[1:02:22] dress
[1:02:23] it and I'll prepare the soup for you.
[1:02:27] Take it to your father. Let him eat and
[1:02:30] let him bless you.
[1:02:32] my Jacob said no ma but my
[1:02:37] father will notice that I'm deceiving
[1:02:42] him because my voice is different from
[1:02:45] the voice of
[1:02:46] Esau and Esau is
[1:02:49] hairy and my body is smooth. What about
[1:02:52] if I go and my father filled my body and
[1:02:54] found out
[1:02:56] that I am I am here to deceive him. What
[1:03:00] do you think will happen to
[1:03:03] me? Then Rebecca said, "My son, let that
[1:03:06] be upon me. You just go and do as I've
[1:03:09] told
[1:03:11] you."
[1:03:12] Hallelujah. But remember that before
[1:03:15] that, huh? Esau have sold his birthight
[1:03:20] to Jacob.
[1:03:23] So if Esau have sold his birthright and
[1:03:26] the oath to Jacob, why will he take the
[1:03:30] inheritance? No, the inheritance must go
[1:03:34] to the
[1:03:35] firstborn. Is that
[1:03:37] clear? So why will it be that Esau must
[1:03:42] go back and take the inheritance when he
[1:03:44] has in fact sold the birthright to his
[1:03:46] younger
[1:03:48] brother? So he went and did as the
[1:03:51] mother instructed and within no time
[1:03:54] Rebecca prepared the soup and the aroma
[1:03:57] charged the whole place. He said carry
[1:04:00] it and send it to your father. So Jacob
[1:04:03] took the soup and sent it to the father.
[1:04:07] He said father I am
[1:04:09] here your son Jacob please I prepared as
[1:04:13] you you ordered. Take it eat and bless
[1:04:17] me. Then Isaac said, "How
[1:04:21] come that within no time you've been
[1:04:24] able to get the deer and prepare the
[1:04:27] soup?" He said, "Well, the Lord was with
[1:04:31] me." Says, "Is that so?" He said, "Yes,
[1:04:34] okay, bring it." And he sent it. His
[1:04:38] father ate
[1:04:40] it. He really enjoyed it. In fact, he
[1:04:44] did it the same way as Esau used to do
[1:04:46] it. There was no difference. So Isaac
[1:04:49] couldn't
[1:04:51] dictate. But when he finished, he said,
[1:04:53] "Come, come to me, my son, Esau. Come,
[1:04:56] let me, let me, let me, let me fill
[1:04:59] you." And then, God have mercy. Jacob
[1:05:04] reached to his father
[1:05:06] Isaac and Isaac felt his body
[1:05:11] because Rebecca put you know the skin of
[1:05:16] the of the lamb some part on his son
[1:05:19] Jacob. So when Isaac felt the body he
[1:05:24] felt that it was Harry and for that
[1:05:26] matter he thought that it was
[1:05:31] Esau. So Isaac said, "Well, the body is
[1:05:37] the body of Esau, but the voice is the
[1:05:42] voice of Jacob." What a
[1:05:45] confusion.
[1:05:46] Hallelujah. He said the body is the body
[1:05:49] of Jacob, but the the the the voice the
[1:05:52] voice of Esau.
[1:05:57] There was certain you know doubt over
[1:05:59] there but Isaac didn't
[1:06:02] have no
[1:06:04] option. He called Jacob and he blessed
[1:06:08] him. He pour all his blessings upon him.
[1:06:12] Anything that was in him that supposed
[1:06:14] to have put on Esau, he pour it upon
[1:06:18] Jacob.
[1:06:20] Hallelujah. Yes. The voice was the voice
[1:06:25] of
[1:06:27] Jacob and the body was the body of
[1:06:30] Jacob. But there was a lambkin over
[1:06:34] him. That is what make the
[1:06:38] difference. Hallelujah. That was what
[1:06:40] make the difference. So after he poured
[1:06:42] the blessings upon him, then the Bible
[1:06:45] say that he was barely out from the room
[1:06:49] when Esau also came around.
[1:06:52] And when Esau came around quickly he
[1:06:55] went to the kitchen and prepared
[1:06:57] whatever he's supposed to prepare. And
[1:06:58] then he also reached to the father
[1:07:00] Isaac. He said father I have come. I
[1:07:03] have prepared what you requested. He
[1:07:05] said what? Who are you? He said I am
[1:07:09] your son Esau. He said what? No then
[1:07:13] your brother have come and take your
[1:07:16] blessing. Hallelujah. Your brother have
[1:07:19] come to take your blessing.
[1:07:22] But what will happen? It has already
[1:07:24] happened. He said, "Dad, then I want you
[1:07:27] to bless me too." He said, "No, there is
[1:07:29] no blessing again. I've already poured
[1:07:31] the blessings upon your brother." It was
[1:07:34] a special blessing. Hallelujah. If God
[1:07:39] have ordained that anything will come to
[1:07:43] you, nothing nothing will stop
[1:07:46] it. Nothing will stop it. You see,
[1:07:48] sometimes people will will talk about
[1:07:51] this and they will denigrate Rebecca for
[1:07:55] telling Jacob to go and do that. You
[1:07:57] don't have any revelation about that.
[1:08:00] Hallelujah. Rebecca didn't do any
[1:08:03] mistake. Rebecca was following that say
[1:08:06] the Lord. Rebecca was walking in the
[1:08:09] vision of God because it has already
[1:08:11] been told her that the the younger
[1:08:15] will overrule the elder. And when you
[1:08:19] come to Romans, the Bible said that God
[1:08:21] told he said, "Jacob I love, but Esau
[1:08:25] have I hated." How will God pour his
[1:08:28] blessings upon something that he hate?
[1:08:31] It's
[1:08:32] impossible. He said, "I love
[1:08:35] Jacob." And so you have to love what God
[1:08:38] love. Is that clear? That is why Rebecca
[1:08:42] didn't do any mistake but he loved Jacob
[1:08:45] because he have been told that God love
[1:08:48] Jacob. So if God love Jacob it doesn't
[1:08:51] matter whoever is in love with
[1:08:53] Esau. I will see what God see and I will
[1:08:58] love what God love. Hallelujah. And that
[1:09:01] is all what God want us to be.
[1:09:05] We have to be with God. Whatever we are,
[1:09:08] we have to be with God. We have to go by
[1:09:10] God's
[1:09:12] way. Where he lead us, that is where we
[1:09:15] have to go. We shouldn't have our own
[1:09:18] thoughts. We should have. He said, "My
[1:09:19] thoughts are higher than
[1:09:21] yours." And Rebecca tried as much as
[1:09:26] possible to be in the thought of God. He
[1:09:29] wanted to follow the vision of God.
[1:09:31] Hallelujah. That is why if somebody said
[1:09:34] that he made a mist No, Rebecca didn't
[1:09:36] make any
[1:09:37] mistake. He she was completely following
[1:09:40] God according to the vision and
[1:09:43] according to the
[1:09:45] prophecy. Amen. Let your blessing be a
[1:09:48] special blessing if only you follow what
[1:09:53] God taught is about you.
[1:09:59] Perhaps you may not
[1:10:00] understand. Oh, why is it so? Oh, why am
[1:10:04] I here? Oh, why am I doing this and I
[1:10:08] don't see my
[1:10:09] feet. Sometimes you will never
[1:10:12] understand
[1:10:14] it. But all is in the purpose of God.
[1:10:18] What I want you to understand that as a
[1:10:21] child of God, you only ought to follow
[1:10:25] the principles that God will lay upon
[1:10:27] your way. And that is where you see the
[1:10:30] mighty hand of God in your life. Not
[1:10:32] what you
[1:10:34] think. Hallelujah. Not what somebody
[1:10:36] think about
[1:10:37] you, but what you have connection with.
[1:10:41] So long as God is
[1:10:43] concerned in the life of Joseph.
[1:10:48] When God begin to deal with him, when
[1:10:49] God to begin to reveal things to him,
[1:10:52] when God begin to show him what he was
[1:10:54] going to be in the future and he told to
[1:10:57] his
[1:10:58] brothers, he became their
[1:11:01] enemy. In fact, one day his own father
[1:11:05] asked him a question. Are you telling me
[1:11:08] that I am the star? your mother is the
[1:11:11] moon and you're breathing the the stars
[1:11:15] and we are bowing down to you. Joseph
[1:11:18] said, "No, Dad. I have not I've not said
[1:11:19] that. It was just a dream that I had and
[1:11:23] I was sharing it with my
[1:11:26] brethren and he was hated." It came to a
[1:11:30] point they wanted to kill Joseph because
[1:11:32] of what God had made him to be.
[1:11:36] They plan to kill
[1:11:38] him. When Jacob asked Joseph to go to
[1:11:44] see how they were
[1:11:46] fairing whilst they were feeding the
[1:11:49] animals on the wilderness. When they saw
[1:11:53] Joseph coming, they said, "Yeah, that's
[1:11:54] the dreamer coming. It's time for us to
[1:11:57] take revenge. Let us kill him so that
[1:11:59] his visions and and his so-called dreams
[1:12:02] will come to an end."
[1:12:04] He's disturbing us with every day I have
[1:12:06] a dream, every day I have this, every
[1:12:08] day I've seen this, every day I have
[1:12:09] seen that. If you cannot see and
[1:12:12] somebody can
[1:12:13] see, why should it be your
[1:12:15] problem? Praise the name of our
[1:12:19] God. You cannot be what you are
[1:12:24] not. Is that clear? You can never be
[1:12:27] what you are
[1:12:28] not. And if God make you to be somebody,
[1:12:32] nobody also can change that destiny
[1:12:35] because it is God's own purpose for
[1:12:39] you. If God say that I have blessed you
[1:12:42] with this substance, nobody can take it
[1:12:44] from your
[1:12:46] hand because it's a special
[1:12:50] one. They try to kill Joseph. They put
[1:12:53] him in a dry well. They stone him over
[1:12:57] there.
[1:12:58] But thankful to the Lord when they saw
[1:13:01] the Medidionite traders passing by then
[1:13:04] they decided now don't let us kill our
[1:13:06] brother let us sell him. So they sold
[1:13:09] him into slavery with wicked minds. They
[1:13:12] didn't know where their brother was
[1:13:14] going to to be but they didn't care
[1:13:16] about anything. They sold him exactly as
[1:13:19] Jesus was
[1:13:20] sold. They went back home and lied to
[1:13:23] their
[1:13:25] father. They kill one of the kid and
[1:13:28] they apply the blood in the coat of many
[1:13:33] colors that Jacob so loved Joseph that
[1:13:36] he he made that quote special for him to
[1:13:40] differentiate him from his
[1:13:42] brethren. Jacob himself realized that
[1:13:46] Joseph was a special
[1:13:49] child but he was not able to stand to
[1:13:52] defend his
[1:13:54] son. And they brought that coat soaked
[1:13:57] with the blood of animal and told a lie
[1:14:00] to Jacob that this is what we found on
[1:14:02] the way. Perhaps some wild animal, some
[1:14:06] some mountain lion have cheered him and
[1:14:09] I mean and the Bible say that Jacob
[1:14:11] cried and cried and cried for his son
[1:14:15] Joseph because he thought that he was
[1:14:19] dead. So Jacob was crying for for Isaac.
[1:14:24] I'm sorry for Joseph whilst he was
[1:14:28] alive. Can you imagine your father
[1:14:31] crying for you thinking that you are
[1:14:33] dead? Your mother crying for you
[1:14:35] thinking that you are dead. But you are
[1:14:37] alive and they took Joseph far away to
[1:14:41] Egypt. Look at what God
[1:14:43] did. He found himself in a home of
[1:14:46] Potifer, a general of the Pharaoh. And
[1:14:50] we all know that story. I won't go into
[1:14:52] details of that.
[1:14:54] When the wife of Portifa tried to commit
[1:14:58] sin with
[1:14:59] Joseph, Joseph said, "No, madame, I
[1:15:01] can't do that." He said, "I cannot sin
[1:15:04] against my God." He said, "No, nobody is
[1:15:06] here. It's me and you. I mean, why?" He
[1:15:10] said, "No, if I do that, I have sinned
[1:15:13] against my God." He said, "Where is your
[1:15:15] God? Your God is far away in Kenna."
[1:15:19] He said, "Well, my God have eyes that
[1:15:22] can see every
[1:15:23] place. I cannot hide. I cannot hide from
[1:15:27] the presence of my God. His eyes are
[1:15:29] everywhere. So I am not ready to do
[1:15:32] that." And this woman implicated
[1:15:36] Joseph. And Joseph was put in the
[1:15:39] dungeon falsely, falsely
[1:15:44] accused. Nobody was there to defend him.
[1:15:47] He was a stranger and a slave. So they
[1:15:50] put him in the
[1:15:52] dungeon falsely. Brother, sister, you
[1:15:54] see sometimes things will come your
[1:15:57] way. You cannot defend
[1:16:00] yourself. But that doesn't mean that you
[1:16:03] are
[1:16:04] guilty. Hallelujah. That doesn't mean
[1:16:07] that you are
[1:16:10] guilty. God fight for his people at all
[1:16:15] given time.
[1:16:17] And God descended and started fighting
[1:16:20] for
[1:16:22] Joseph. Hallelujah. One day whilst in
[1:16:26] the
[1:16:27] dungeon,
[1:16:29] then two servants of the king, King
[1:16:32] Pharaoh were also sent
[1:16:35] there. The
[1:16:38] battler and then the
[1:16:40] baker. Both of them have
[1:16:42] kids. And so when they went to see
[1:16:45] Joseph in the dungeon, the Bible said
[1:16:47] that one night both of them had
[1:16:50] dream and they were
[1:16:53] confused. So Joseph asked them, "Now why
[1:16:56] are you so so
[1:16:59] down?" And
[1:17:01] then the battle said, "Well, this is the
[1:17:03] dream that I've had and I'm confused. I
[1:17:05] don't know the meaning of it. This,
[1:17:07] that, this, that, this, that." And
[1:17:09] Joseph said, "Well, this is the meaning
[1:17:11] of your dream that in three days Pharaoh
[1:17:16] will lift up your head again and place
[1:17:18] you back to your
[1:17:20] position." And then the Bible says that
[1:17:23] when the baker heard the good
[1:17:28] interpretation of the other man, then he
[1:17:30] also told to Joseph his dream. And
[1:17:34] Joseph said,
[1:17:35] "Well, your dream interpretation is that
[1:17:38] in three days
[1:17:40] time, Pharaoh is going to lift your head
[1:17:43] and execute you. You are going to be
[1:17:46] killed in three
[1:17:47] days." And the Bible says that it
[1:17:50] happened exactly as
[1:17:53] Joseph gave the interpretation. You see,
[1:17:56] this was what God had wanted to use
[1:17:59] Joseph to do far away in Kenna among his
[1:18:05] brethren. But because of the hatred that
[1:18:08] they had for him, they push him out to
[1:18:12] go and rather manifest it in a strange
[1:18:15] land. But before they left the dungeon,
[1:18:19] uh, Joseph told the batlad, "Please,
[1:18:22] when you go, remind me before Pharaoh
[1:18:24] because I am falsely
[1:18:27] accused and I was put here. So please
[1:18:30] tell Pharaoh about
[1:18:32] me." But
[1:18:35] unfortunately,
[1:18:36] unfortunately, when the battler was
[1:18:38] restored to his position, he forgot
[1:18:41] about Joseph completely. But there was a
[1:18:43] reason for that.
[1:18:46] There was a reason for that. Brother,
[1:18:47] sister, anything that happen in your
[1:18:49] life, the Bible said that just give
[1:18:51] glory to God. Can I hear amen here? He
[1:18:56] said anything that happened in your way,
[1:18:58] just give glory to
[1:19:00] God. Listen to this. That the butler
[1:19:03] completely forgot about
[1:19:07] Joseph. For over two years, he was still
[1:19:10] in the dungeon.
[1:19:13] Meanwhile, he told him that I have done
[1:19:18] nothing wrong for me to be brought
[1:19:21] here. I was falsely accused by
[1:19:24] Portifer's
[1:19:27] wife. But his dream and the dream of the
[1:19:31] B I'm sorry, the baker, it came
[1:19:34] perfectly as Joseph interpreted it. He
[1:19:38] said the baker must die for the butler
[1:19:43] to
[1:19:44] live. And the baker was the one that
[1:19:47] produce food. And the food represent the
[1:19:50] flesh. And the battler was the one that
[1:19:53] give wine to the pharaoh. And the wine
[1:19:56] represent, you
[1:19:58] know, spiritual things, you know,
[1:20:00] stimulation of
[1:20:02] revelation. And so the flesh must
[1:20:05] die for the spirit to
[1:20:08] live. In the life of a Christian, in the
[1:20:11] life of a child of God, take this. Any
[1:20:14] flesh must die in you for the spirit of
[1:20:17] God to live in
[1:20:20] you. The flesh must die. Anything
[1:20:23] fleshly must
[1:20:25] die. Anything laziness must die.
[1:20:30] Anything lukewarmness must
[1:20:33] die. Anything that weigh you down must
[1:20:38] die so that your spiritual life will
[1:20:43] live. And that is where God meet us. God
[1:20:48] don't meet us on our flesh. He meet us
[1:20:51] by the standard of the spirit that is in
[1:20:53] us. He speak to us by his spirit.
[1:20:59] Hallelujah. He speak to us by his spirit
[1:21:02] and he expect our soul who feed on the
[1:21:05] spiritual food which is the word of God
[1:21:08] to respond to his
[1:21:10] word. So everything fleshly must die in
[1:21:13] the life of the believer. And that is
[1:21:15] what exactly what happened. The butler
[1:21:18] died and the one that
[1:21:28] prod's blessings as always so
[1:21:32] special Pharaoh himself had a
[1:21:35] dream and the Bible says that there was
[1:21:37] nobody there to give the interpretation.
[1:21:45] Then the butler remembered
[1:21:48] Joseph. He said,
[1:21:51] "King, when you put
[1:21:54] us over there in the dungeon, I and a
[1:21:58] butler, both of us had a dream one
[1:22:02] night. And there was a young Hebrew
[1:22:05] child there, young Hebrew man who gave
[1:22:08] us the interpretation of our dreams and
[1:22:11] it manifested exactly.
[1:22:14] King permit me to go and bring him so
[1:22:16] that perhaps he will give your dream
[1:22:20] interpretation. He said what is that? He
[1:22:22] said go and bring Joseph. And they
[1:22:24] brought Joseph before
[1:22:27] Pharaoh. Brother, sister, look at this
[1:22:29] thing.
[1:22:32] If the
[1:22:34] butler
[1:22:36] remembered and spoke to Pharaoh about
[1:22:39] Joseph at that
[1:22:42] time and Joseph was brought out from the
[1:22:46] dungeon and Joseph was set
[1:22:48] free. Do you think that Joseph would
[1:22:51] have stayed there? I am sure that he
[1:22:53] wouldn't he wouldn't stay among the
[1:22:55] people. He would have tried to go back
[1:22:59] to his country where he came
[1:23:01] from. And if it happened that
[1:23:04] way, where were they going to find him
[1:23:09] to give
[1:23:10] interpretation to that of the king? That
[1:23:14] is why in God's
[1:23:16] wisdom, in God's own
[1:23:19] way, the battler forgot completely about
[1:23:23] the request of Joseph that he be made
[1:23:26] mention to the king that he was accused
[1:23:28] first and for that matter he has to be
[1:23:32] released. God made him forget about
[1:23:34] completely till Pharaoh himself had a
[1:23:37] dream. Now it was time for God to
[1:23:41] vindicate Joseph.
[1:23:44] So they pull him out from the
[1:23:46] dungeon and he stood before
[1:23:49] Pharaoh and he gave the interpretation
[1:23:52] of Pharaoh's dream and he show him
[1:23:55] exactly what was going to happen per his
[1:23:58] dream and Pharaoh said then what should
[1:24:01] we
[1:24:02] do to avoid this that you are claiming
[1:24:05] is going to
[1:24:07] come and Joseph said well Pharaoh should
[1:24:11] look among his people, a wise
[1:24:16] person, a man with
[1:24:18] wisdom, a man that fears
[1:24:21] God, hallelujah, a man that is accurate
[1:24:25] in all his
[1:24:27] doings and give him
[1:24:30] authority to manage the affairs in the
[1:24:34] first seven years that there is going to
[1:24:36] be plenty of food so that you restore
[1:24:40] it before the seven you know lean year
[1:24:45] will
[1:24:47] come and Pharaoh looked around he said
[1:24:50] well if we need any man like
[1:24:53] that I don't see
[1:24:56] anybody in this province than you Joseph
[1:25:00] yourself
[1:25:02] hallelujah so
[1:25:05] immediately Joseph was
[1:25:08] raised to be the
[1:25:12] test of
[1:25:14] Pharaoh. And the Bible said that Pharaoh
[1:25:16] then removed his ring and put on the
[1:25:20] finger of
[1:25:22] Joseph.
[1:25:23] Meaning anything that was going to be
[1:25:26] done in that land at that time without
[1:25:31] Joseph sealing it, it cannot go out.
[1:25:36] And so Pharaoh gave Joseph that
[1:25:40] authority and we see that blessing that
[1:25:43] God prepared for
[1:25:45] Joseph. It was time for it
[1:25:48] manifestation. And Joseph waited. Joseph
[1:25:51] said, "I have not sinned. I've not I've
[1:25:53] not commit even among my brethren. I
[1:25:56] didn't commit any sin and they sold me."
[1:25:59] And here in Egypt also, I didn't commit
[1:26:01] any sin, but I've been prisoned falsely.
[1:26:04] But all he was walking in the vision of
[1:26:08] God. God knew that yes my
[1:26:12] son nothing have you done wrong but look
[1:26:17] at what you are going through. It is all
[1:26:19] for a purpose. And when the glory of God
[1:26:22] was made manifest in the life of Joseph.
[1:26:26] Oh, now
[1:26:28] Pharaoh, all his men, all his household,
[1:26:32] Portifer and the rest, everyone bowed
[1:26:34] down before
[1:26:36] Joseph. The Bible says that they made
[1:26:39] him rode in the chariot of Pharaoh and
[1:26:42] everybody was bowing down. They were
[1:26:44] blowing trumpet because the prime
[1:26:46] minister Joseph was
[1:26:48] coming. Oh my, what is more blessing
[1:26:50] than this? When God will elevate you
[1:26:53] among your enemies, when God will
[1:26:56] elevate you among your co-equals, when
[1:27:00] God will elevate you in your society
[1:27:03] because that you believe in him and you
[1:27:06] respect and you love
[1:27:07] him, what is more than
[1:27:10] that? And
[1:27:12] then whilst
[1:27:15] Joseph was you know enjoying his
[1:27:18] kingship in in in uh in Pharaoh's
[1:27:21] palace the whole province after a seven
[1:27:25] year there was
[1:27:27] famine. Every place there was famine.
[1:27:30] There was trouble here and there. People
[1:27:32] were crying no food, no food, no food,
[1:27:34] no food. And it rigged the land of
[1:27:37] Canaan. My they had nothing to do. They
[1:27:41] have no choice than to write to Egypt
[1:27:44] because that was where they heard that
[1:27:47] there was
[1:27:49] food. So Jacob said, "Well, my sons, go
[1:27:52] to Egypt and buy food for us before we
[1:27:55] all
[1:27:57] die." And this brothers gathered
[1:28:01] themselves up. They rode on their
[1:28:03] animals heading towards Egypt because
[1:28:07] they have heard that there's food there.
[1:28:10] They have heard that there's a prayer
[1:28:11] minister who is taking an affair and
[1:28:13] making sure that everything goes well
[1:28:17] there and then one day they entered into
[1:28:21] the gates of Egypt and they were led
[1:28:24] into the palace of
[1:28:26] Joseph. The Bible said and when Joseph
[1:28:28] saw his brethren he recognized them
[1:28:32] immediately but they didn't see
[1:28:37] him. And that is what God is doing in
[1:28:40] your
[1:28:41] life. Those who hate you will see you
[1:28:45] but they will not recognize you because
[1:28:48] of the blessing of
[1:28:50] God. Because God will make you so
[1:28:52] special that they will not see you. They
[1:28:55] will begin to ask questions. Ah, is that
[1:28:57] him? Is that Yes, it's
[1:29:01] him. Bible said that Joseph started
[1:29:03] speaking in tongues.
[1:29:06] He spoke in Egyptian language and there
[1:29:10] was interpreter that was interpreting to
[1:29:12] his
[1:29:14] brethren. But you see what God has
[1:29:17] blessed no man can curse
[1:29:20] it. When Joseph had a dream that his
[1:29:25] brethren were bowing down to him and as
[1:29:27] a result of that they sold him over 20
[1:29:31] years. They came back to do the same
[1:29:33] thing. They bowed down before Joseph
[1:29:36] when they didn't know that it was Joseph
[1:29:37] that they were bowing out to. In fact,
[1:29:40] the account says that they bowed down
[1:29:42] three good
[1:29:45] times and that is all what God can do
[1:29:48] for his
[1:29:49] people. If God
[1:29:51] says he has blessed you, no man can
[1:29:54] curse
[1:29:55] you. If God say he has elevated you, no
[1:29:58] man can bring you down. Right from the
[1:30:01] time when Joseph started having the
[1:30:03] dreams and they hated him. What
[1:30:06] happened? God made it to be manifested.
[1:30:09] No matter what opposition that Joseph
[1:30:11] faced at that time, God's word must go
[1:30:14] forth to accomplish what he has sent it
[1:30:17] for. And that is what we have to accept
[1:30:20] into our lives. Brother,
[1:30:22] sister, we don't know what God has for
[1:30:25] us, but one thing we know that he's a
[1:30:28] faithful
[1:30:29] God. And he said that the vision is for
[1:30:32] an appointed time. Even though it will
[1:30:38] turb yourself, just wait for it and walk
[1:30:42] in the vision and wait to see what God
[1:30:46] has spoken about you in the future.
[1:30:52] Amen. Now, let's listen to what the
[1:30:54] prophet said
[1:30:55] here. I'm quoting from approach to
[1:30:59] God. He said, "Now Abraham was called
[1:31:03] for separation to S John as a pilgrim
[1:31:07] and a
[1:31:12] stranger with what? a promise that God
[1:31:16] was going to bless the world by
[1:31:19] him. Call out when he was 75 years old.
[1:31:23] Sarah being 65, 10 years difference in
[1:31:27] their
[1:31:28] age. And he set out and waited 25 years.
[1:31:32] still trusting, still believing,
[1:31:34] professing to be a stranger, coming to
[1:31:37] God through the approach and everything,
[1:31:41] still believing that he was going to
[1:31:43] have a
[1:31:44] son, he was walking in the vision. That
[1:31:48] is it. Hallelujah. And then after he was
[1:31:52] 100 years old or
[1:31:54] 99 years old, Abraham getting way up
[1:31:58] into the 25 years now, God approached
[1:32:02] Abraham. He said, "Now
[1:32:05] Lord, I am getting old, but
[1:32:09] how? I believe you are going to do
[1:32:13] it." That was Abraham. He said, "Lord, I
[1:32:16] believe you are going to do it, but I
[1:32:18] don't know just how you are going to do
[1:32:22] it."
[1:32:24] Amen. He said, "I I don't doubt it. It's
[1:32:28] going to be Lord, but could you just
[1:32:31] show me a little way that is going to
[1:32:34] be?" That was the request of Abraham
[1:32:37] according to the
[1:32:39] prophet. Will you just show me the way
[1:32:42] you are? God, will you show me how you
[1:32:44] are going to make me whom you have made
[1:32:46] me to
[1:32:47] be? Lord, will you show me how you are
[1:32:51] going to make me? Will you show me the
[1:32:54] kind of house you are going to put me
[1:32:57] in? Will you show me the kind of kind of
[1:33:00] car you want me to
[1:33:02] ride? Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] Will you show me the kind of I mean a
[1:33:08] whole lot of you know request can range
[1:33:11] in the mind of
[1:33:12] Abraham but he said Lord will you show
[1:33:15] me how I am going to have a son because
[1:33:17] I'm growing old my wife is becoming an
[1:33:20] elderly woman in fact she has passed the
[1:33:23] the time of menopause Lord how are you
[1:33:26] going to do
[1:33:27] it oh my he said that is where your
[1:33:31] little special blessings
[1:33:33] comes you See how you going to do it
[1:33:37] Lord now I am old you are going to do it
[1:33:40] but just could you just show me how you
[1:33:43] are going to do it I the prophet said I
[1:33:45] love that don't you just how you going
[1:33:49] to do it father you just show
[1:33:52] me God said come right here
[1:33:56] Abraham I want to talk to you just a
[1:33:59] moment and God is calling all of us
[1:34:02] right now he want to talk to us just a
[1:34:04] moment
[1:34:07] Amen. He said, Abraham, I am the
[1:34:10] Almighty one. I am Almighty God. Walk
[1:34:15] before me and be
[1:34:18] perfect. That is how I am going to do
[1:34:23] it. Hallelujah. You see how the prophet
[1:34:26] put it? that Abraham was
[1:34:29] requesting that God will show him how he
[1:34:33] was going to do it. And God
[1:34:35] said,"Abraham, if you want to know how
[1:34:37] I'm going to do that, if you want to
[1:34:40] know how I'm going to bless you, this is
[1:34:42] how I'm going to do it. Just walk before
[1:34:44] me and be perfect." Meaning, walk in the
[1:34:48] vision,
[1:34:49] walk in my word and be made perfect and
[1:34:53] that is the way I am going to bless you.
[1:34:57] There is no other way, brother,
[1:34:59] sister. There is no other way but just
[1:35:03] to trust and
[1:35:05] obey. How we have that song, trust and
[1:35:08] obey. But there's no other way to be
[1:35:12] happy in Jesus but to trust and
[1:35:18] oy. That is the way for the believer to
[1:35:23] take his blessing from God. That is the
[1:35:28] way for the believer to know how God is
[1:35:31] going to bless him. And when we are
[1:35:33] talking about blessing, brother,
[1:35:35] sister, there are so many ways that
[1:35:37] people think what should be a blessing
[1:35:40] in my
[1:35:41] life. So many ways, so different
[1:35:45] thoughts and different ideas.
[1:35:49] But well each and everyone have his own
[1:35:52] desire. Each and everyone have his own
[1:35:54] requests what he want God to make him to
[1:35:57] be. If only you can use that to praise
[1:36:00] your
[1:36:01] God. If only it would not be outside the
[1:36:04] word of God. God is capable and more
[1:36:08] than able to give that to you. Can I
[1:36:12] hear amen? Amen. He is able and more
[1:36:15] than able to do it for us. He did it for
[1:36:19] Isaac. He did it for Abraham. He did it
[1:36:21] for Sarah. He did it for
[1:36:23] Joseph. And he has done it for so many.
[1:36:26] And it is you and I our time. Let us
[1:36:31] walk in the vision and see what the Lord
[1:36:34] will do for us. He said, "Walk before me
[1:36:37] and be made
[1:36:38] perfect." I am quoting this one. Show us
[1:36:41] the father. He said, "God's word is a
[1:36:44] seed.
[1:36:46] God is in his
[1:36:48] word. Look at him when he makes his word
[1:36:54] manifest. His promises of what he will
[1:36:58] do. Look at 120 people taking God's
[1:37:03] word. They went up to the day of
[1:37:06] Pentecost and waited until that
[1:37:09] commission. He said, "Turry ye in the
[1:37:11] city of Jerusalem until you are endued
[1:37:14] with power from on high." God's word
[1:37:18] sunk into their hearts and they waited
[1:37:22] there. God said, "Wait in
[1:37:26] Jerusalem. Don't go to
[1:37:30] Galilee. Don't go to
[1:37:33] Kaa." Hallelujah. But in Jerusalem, wait
[1:37:38] there for the
[1:37:39] promise. In other words, walk in the
[1:37:42] vision of God. Amen. Walk in the word of
[1:37:46] God. Huh? He said the word sunk into
[1:37:49] their hearts and they waited there. What
[1:37:52] was they doing? Just sitting around
[1:37:55] saying, "Well, I'll see what will
[1:37:58] happen." You can't water it that
[1:38:02] way. Just sitting down. Oh, I'm a
[1:38:05] believer. Oh, I'm a Christian. Just
[1:38:07] sitting down. No, no, no, no. You can't
[1:38:10] water it that way. The prophet said you
[1:38:12] can't water it that way. If you say,
[1:38:15] "Well, yes, I believe in divine
[1:38:17] healing." Oh, sure. It's in the Bible.
[1:38:20] That is not the way to get
[1:38:23] healed. You might have the
[1:38:26] seed, but you got to water it.
[1:38:32] He said, "You might have the seed, but
[1:38:35] you got to water
[1:38:37] it. You have the word of God. You have
[1:38:40] the promise of God. You have to walk in
[1:38:42] the word. You have to walk in the vision
[1:38:44] of God to receive the blessings of
[1:38:47] God." Praise be the name of our God.
[1:38:51] Hallelujah. He said you you can't water
[1:38:53] it that way. Now the Bible said when
[1:38:57] they were in the upper room, they were
[1:38:59] blessing and thanking God and praising
[1:39:03] God. Why praising him? Because they knew
[1:39:06] it was coming for they had the seed in
[1:39:11] their heart. God's promised
[1:39:15] word. Hallelujah. Today you and I, we
[1:39:18] have to do the same.
[1:39:20] We cannot just sit and claim that we are
[1:39:23] Christians and for that matter God is
[1:39:26] doing this for us and no we must be in
[1:39:28] the word. We must walk in the word. We
[1:39:32] must walk in the vision. We must t and t
[1:39:36] and t. He say even though it will t but
[1:39:38] it will surely come. What will come?
[1:39:42] Your special
[1:39:45] blessing. Specialtity. What God has
[1:39:48] planned for you, brother, sister, it
[1:39:51] belongs to you. Nobody can take
[1:39:53] it. The brethren of Joseph couldn't take
[1:39:56] his
[1:39:57] blessing. Even though it tried, but it
[1:40:00] came to
[1:40:02] manifest. Hallelujah. Situation and
[1:40:05] condition couldn't take the blessing of
[1:40:07] Abraham. Even though it tried, it came
[1:40:10] to
[1:40:11] manifest. Hallelujah. And everyone that
[1:40:15] have walked with the
[1:40:16] Lord could
[1:40:19] testify that indeed when God speak it
[1:40:23] come to
[1:40:25] manifest. Amen. Why would the people in
[1:40:28] Noah's day call him a mad man? Because
[1:40:32] what he was saying was the word of God.
[1:40:35] And that was what God was was was about
[1:40:38] to do. But they look down upon it and
[1:40:41] they call Noah madman. But that did not
[1:40:44] discourage Noah. Noah continue to walk
[1:40:47] in that vision. He continue to walk in
[1:40:49] that word until after 120 years it
[1:40:56] manifested. So when God is pouring his
[1:40:58] blessings upon his people, brother, it
[1:41:01] has no
[1:41:02] hindrance. Nothing can hinder it because
[1:41:05] it is for you.
[1:41:08] Amen. Now in
[1:41:11] closing, in closing now, when
[1:41:15] Jacob came to
[1:41:17] Egypt, when his brethren, I mean, so
[1:41:20] Joseph's brethren came to Egypt and they
[1:41:22] found out that
[1:41:24] oh, that is
[1:41:26] Joseph, our brother whom we thought that
[1:41:30] was dead over 20 years ago.
[1:41:34] my
[1:41:36] Joseph the prime minister of
[1:41:39] Egypt. Then he said, "Well, is my father
[1:41:42] yet alive?" They said, "Yes, your father
[1:41:45] is alive." He said, "Go and bring him to
[1:41:49] me." And they went back. They carried
[1:41:52] Jacob, an old man, and they all went to
[1:41:56] Egypt. And that was when Israel saw John
[1:42:00] in Egypt.
[1:42:03] But the time came when Joseph Jacob
[1:42:06] realized that he was old and Joseph
[1:42:08] brought his
[1:42:10] sons to him to bless them. We all know
[1:42:14] what
[1:42:15] happened in the mind of
[1:42:18] Joseph. He knew that Ephraim was the
[1:42:21] elderly son and for that for that matter
[1:42:25] the right hand of his father Jacob must
[1:42:29] fall upon Ephraim because he was the
[1:42:32] first son and Manasseh was placed on the
[1:42:35] left. Okay. So it mean in a in a in a in
[1:42:39] a in a sense the bigger blessing must go
[1:42:43] upon Ephraim and then the lesser one
[1:42:46] must go upon
[1:42:49] Manasse. But while they closed their
[1:42:52] eyes and the prophet Jacob was about to
[1:42:56] pronounce a
[1:42:58] blessing then his hands were
[1:43:01] crossed. So instead of the right hand
[1:43:03] going upon the elder, it rather went to
[1:43:06] the
[1:43:07] younger. And Joseph said, "Oh no, no,
[1:43:10] father, that is the younger one. The one
[1:43:13] on the right is the
[1:43:15] elder." And Jacob said, "My son, it is
[1:43:19] God that have crossed my
[1:43:20] hand. If there is any special blessing
[1:43:23] in my right
[1:43:24] hand, I am not delivering it. But it is
[1:43:28] God that is delivering it."
[1:43:30] So that special blessing that Joseph
[1:43:33] thought that it will go to the elderly
[1:43:35] son, it rather went to the younger son.
[1:43:37] Manazi brother, sister, you see how God
[1:43:40] does his things. It is not what you
[1:43:43] think but it is what he think about
[1:43:47] you. It is not what someone think but it
[1:43:51] is what God think about you. And my
[1:43:54] prayer tonight for all of us is that
[1:43:57] whatever thought God have for us, let us
[1:44:01] walk in the vision. Let us wait on the
[1:44:04] Lord and nothing and I say nothing can
[1:44:08] change it.
[1:44:10] God has already bless us. Let us accept
[1:44:13] it and walk with it. Amen. God bless all
[1:44:18] of us. Let's bow our heads.
[1:44:26] Oh dear
[1:44:27] father, we thank you again this evening
[1:44:30] Lord
[1:44:31] Jesus.
[1:44:33] Father we
[1:44:35] know that what you can do is no
[1:44:40] secret for you know the thought that you
[1:44:43] have towards us.
[1:44:47] Your word has made it plain and
[1:44:50] clear that
[1:44:52] father as the heavens are higher than
[1:44:54] the
[1:44:55] earth so are your thoughts than our
[1:44:59] thoughts. Help us oh father to always
[1:45:03] wait on thee and walk according to your
[1:45:06] word. Lord
[1:45:09] Jesus as your sons and your
[1:45:12] daughters. Many at times or
[1:45:14] father our thoughts become so different
[1:45:18] from what you think about us. Situations
[1:45:22] and circumstances of this
[1:45:24] world sometime make us to think the way
[1:45:27] we shouldn't.
[1:45:30] Heavenly Father, when we find ourselves
[1:45:32] in circumstances of that
[1:45:35] nature, we ask for your
[1:45:38] forgiveness. And Lord, help us and
[1:45:41] strengthen us to walk according to your
[1:45:45] word concern our
[1:45:47] lives. And for sure we know that
[1:45:50] whatever you have taught of us, nothing
[1:45:53] can stop us. Nothing can stop it, Lord.
[1:45:57] For he said the vision is for an
[1:45:59] appointed time. Even though it will t
[1:46:03] but it should surely come. We should
[1:46:05] wait for us. Help us oh God to wait for
[1:46:07] it. And in all this Lord we give you
[1:46:11] glory, honor and adoration for making us
[1:46:14] your sons and your daughters. Help us.
[1:46:18] Help us Lord. Help us again and
[1:46:20] strengthen us in the faith as we keep
[1:46:24] waiting for your soon coming. Anything
[1:46:27] Lord Jesus that we need to know,
[1:46:30] anything of father that we need to be
[1:46:31] Lord help us oh God that we may always
[1:46:35] be in thy word. Thank you in Jesus
[1:46:40] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:46:47] Praise the
[1:46:53] Lord for us.

[1:47:23] I care not today what the tomorrow may
[1:47:28] bring if shadow or sunshine or
[1:47:33] rain. Oh Lord, I know rule for
[1:47:38] everything. And all of my worry is vain.
