[10:26] saysthe people answered him we have
[10:29] heard out of the law that Christ abideth
[10:32] forever and how sayest thou the son of
[10:35] man must be lifted up who is this son of
[10:39] man then Jesus said unto them yet a
[10:43] little while is the light with
[10:45] you walk while you have the
[10:48] light lest Darkness come upon you for he
[10:52] that walketh in darkness knoweth not
[10:54] where he goeth and while you have light
[10:57] believe in the light that you may be the
[11:00] children of
[11:01] light these things spake Jesus and
[11:04] departed and did hide himself from them
[11:07] but though he had done so many miracles
[11:10] before them yet they believed not on
[11:14] him if you turn over to St John 14 we
[11:17] just want to read one scripture

[12:18] seated praise God amen amen so I'd like
[12:22] to speak tonight and this is a it's a
[12:25] funny title
[12:27] but why are you afraid
[12:33] there's Troublesome times
[12:35] ahead lots of things are going on
[12:38] there's there's earthquakes in diverse
[12:41] places California Los Angeles just had a
[12:43] great big
[12:44] earthquake um it kind of scared
[12:47] him and there's fires there's fires up
[12:51] in San
[12:53] berino there's fires in
[12:55] Greece Greece they had an awful fire in
[12:58] Athens
[13:00] there's you know men's you know the
[13:02] stock market took a big crash just
[13:05] recently and then we have 84 days before
[13:08] the election oh who's going to be what
[13:11] are we going to do what happens if this
[13:13] happens oh the economy is a mess how am
[13:16] I going to pay my bills oh I prices are
[13:19] going up everything there's lots of
[13:21] things to worry about but the question
[13:23] is why are you
[13:26] afraid with all these things shaking and
[13:29] all these things go all these things
[13:31] happening you need to know where you
[13:35] stand not where I stand where you
[13:40] stand brother brandom said some time ago
[13:42] we were setting one of my first trips
[13:44] here to Arizona to go hunting and we
[13:47] were sitting out here near the
[13:48] Superstition Mountain and I had heard of
[13:51] it for a long time and I heard many of
[13:53] the legends that had been told about the
[13:55] Superstition so I looked it up I said
[13:58] well there is actually a place called
[14:00] Superstition Mountains and it's east of
[14:03] Phoenix and the what makes it real
[14:05] famous it's the Lost uh Dutchman's Gold
[14:09] Mine is supposed to be up
[14:11] there and brother random said so he said
[14:14] I remember looking at it the first time
[14:17] it was before day and a great ghostly
[14:20] Shadow hung at the east of me which was
[14:22] known as the Superstition and I'd heard
[14:25] about the Indians and how they would
[14:27] wouldn't go near it and how they were
[14:29] afraid and how the Spanish had
[14:30] mistreated them in the early days when
[14:32] they were hunting gold and they claimed
[14:34] that evil spirits lived in there and
[14:37] actually in Wikipedia they say that the
[14:39] one trap Indians they say that it's the
[14:43] it's the gateway to Hell is in the
[14:45] Superstition
[14:46] Mountains and they said you can go up
[14:48] there and there's winds and you can hear
[14:50] howling and people in
[14:53] hell so they're afraid of it and brother
[14:56] Brandon wanted to see this so he he went
[14:58] up there and he says so he says um they
[15:02] claimed there were evil spirits lived in
[15:04] there and this all stirred my curiosity
[15:07] but all I had was a flashlight to see
[15:09] the Superstition first and then I
[15:12] watched until after a while the Majesty
[15:14] of the sun began to move upon the
[15:16] darkness and when it did it separated
[15:18] the darkness from the light it pressed
[15:21] the darkness back and finally she raised
[15:24] in her highness up over the top of the
[15:26] mountain and it showed Superstition just
[15:28] what
[15:29] was it lit up and showed what it was and
[15:33] all the Spooks and the fears that I had
[15:36] of the
[15:37] Superstition when the Sun was shining
[15:39] and its power upon it everything fled
[15:42] away the sun is the king of all lights
[15:45] in this earth and the natural lights and
[15:47] no matter how much artificial light that
[15:49] we can have and how many great electric
[15:51] Rays we can produce when the Sun rises
[15:54] all the rest of them dim out and that's
[15:57] the same thing it is with the word of
[15:59] God when the word of God is Rises all
[16:03] superstitions denominational fasis uh
[16:06] fanaticisms and things they spread away
[16:09] and it shows it just exactly what it is
[16:13] God in the beginning said let there be
[16:15] light and the light only comes the True
[16:17] Light the king of light comes by the
[16:20] word of God God separated the light from
[16:23] the darkness in the beginning and the
[16:25] word of God made manifest always separ
[16:28] separates the light from the
[16:32] darkness why are you
[16:35] afraid
[16:37] amen so let's go back here to Exodus
[16:40] 4 we want to start here
[16:43] tonight take a look at couple
[16:47] examples so in Exodus 4 we we meet a man
[16:51] named
[16:52] Moses and Moses was he was born in a
[16:56] perilous time
[16:59] and the thing about Moses was is that
[17:02] the Jews they had all they had always
[17:06] gone to church you know they had their
[17:08] beliefs they were separated from the
[17:10] Egyptians but yet they had after 400
[17:13] years they had mingled in with the
[17:14] Egyptians that a lot of things got got
[17:18] you
[17:18] know marinated as my wife would say all
[17:22] the things got together and they they
[17:24] had they were no longer a separated
[17:26] people but they were in there and and
[17:28] they kept hearing when they went to
[17:30] synagogue and that when the priests got
[17:32] up and read that in 400 years I will
[17:35] send I will get you out of Egypt I will
[17:38] deliver you and they knew that they had
[17:40] an expectation for that but in the time
[17:43] that they had the expectation for that
[17:45] everything seemed to be going wrong
[17:48] everything was Topsy Turvy from what
[17:51] they wanted they they were they were a
[17:53] prosperous you know they they were
[17:55] having children they were multiplying
[17:57] but but they were building you know they
[17:59] felt used by the Egyptian government
[18:02] they they saw all these things and and
[18:04] the laws were written against them the
[18:07] laws were written that they said oh the
[18:10] Jews Pharaoh he saw them he says oh this
[18:13] this this slave these people these sheep
[18:16] herders which we despise they're growing
[18:19] so fast we're going to make a federal
[18:20] law that all the midwives when when the
[18:23] child's if a child is born and it's a
[18:26] male child we want to kill it right now
[18:29] kill it right now that's the law of the
[18:31] land and and in all of that in all of
[18:34] that confusion and all of that trials
[18:38] and all of those troubles there was a
[18:40] family that had a boy and that boy had a
[18:44] supernatural birth and that boy
[18:47] supernaturally was saved from the laws
[18:50] of the land and he was raised in
[18:53] Pharaoh's Kingdom he was raised as
[18:56] Pharaoh's son and he had been taught his
[18:59] whole life that that Abraham and Isaac
[19:02] and Jacob that there was a God and God
[19:05] had s Joseph and Joseph had raised up
[19:09] and they he had he had been taught all
[19:11] those things and his mom actually taught
[19:13] him said and you Moses you're the
[19:18] deliverer and when he got to a certain
[19:20] age he thought he could do it he thought
[19:23] he could bring the scriptures to
[19:26] pass he thought he could make make the
[19:29] prophecy
[19:30] work he thought he could just step right
[19:32] into his office and he could just
[19:34] deliver the children of
[19:37] Israel but he found out he
[19:41] couldn't he found out it didn't work
[19:43] that
[19:44] way God is
[19:47] Sovereign
[19:49] amen so he lost everything he just he
[19:52] just he gave up he ran away he ran away
[19:54] he got off into the desert and he was
[19:56] out there and he started you know he was
[19:58] talented and everything he he got a wife
[20:01] and a child and and he was a sheep
[20:03] herder and and he was successful in what
[20:06] he did and one
[20:09] day one day God in his Sovereign Grace
[20:15] God had a per a Time
[20:18] chosen he had a
[20:20] reason that he attracted Moses's
[20:25] attention amen so I want to pick up
[20:28] right there there he
[20:29] says so in Exodus 4:1 it says and Moses
[20:33] answered and said but behold they will
[20:35] not believe me nor hearken unto my voice
[20:39] for they will say the Lord hath not
[20:41] appeared unto thee and the Lord said
[20:44] unto him what is that in thine hand and
[20:46] he said a rod he said cast it on the
[20:49] ground and he cast it on the ground and
[20:50] it became a serpent and Moses fled from
[20:53] before it and the Lord said unto Moses
[20:56] put th forth thine hand hand and take it
[20:59] by the tail and he put forth his hand
[21:01] and he caught it and it became a rod in
[21:03] his hand that they may believe that the
[21:07] Lord God of their fathers the god of
[21:09] Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of
[21:11] Jacob hath appeared unto
[21:14] thee amen just show them the
[21:18] snake and they will believe that the
[21:21] gods of their fathers has sent you to me
[21:25] and the Lord said furthermore unto him
[21:27] put now thine hand into thy bosom and he
[21:29] put his hand into his bosom and when he
[21:32] took it out behold his hand was leprous
[21:34] as snow and he said put thine hand into
[21:37] thy bosom again and he put his hand in
[21:39] his bosom again and he plucked it out of
[21:41] his bosom and behold it was turned again
[21:43] as the other flesh and it shall come to
[21:46] pass if they will not believe thee
[21:49] neither hearken to the voice of the
[21:51] first sign that they will believe the
[21:53] voice of the latter sign amen
[21:58] find out Amen brother brandham said so
[22:00] now we find out this Exodus was at
[22:05] hand and God me Moses and told him what
[22:08] was going to take place and he gave him
[22:11] two
[22:11] signs but the first thing that God had
[22:14] to do for Moses is God had to give Moses
[22:18] a
[22:19] sign God or Moses he believed the
[22:23] prophecy he believed the scriptures but
[22:26] he needed a sign
[22:29] and when he was out watching the Sheep
[22:31] one day he saw a sign he saw a bush that
[22:35] burned and it was not consumed and when
[22:38] he looked upon it he said this a funny
[22:41] thing he probably sat down and had his
[22:43] Starbucks you know Starbucks is now $8 a
[22:46] cup we saw that on the news you they got
[22:49] a new CEO they're going to fix
[22:51] it and he sat down with his Starbucks
[22:54] and he's drinking his Starbucks and he's
[22:55] looking up there on the mountain and
[22:57] he's goes that's a funny thing that bush
[22:59] isn't even burning it caught his
[23:02] attention and when he went up and he
[23:05] went and saw the bush there was a voice
[23:09] that spoke out of the V out of the Bush
[23:12] and the voice spoke to Moses because God
[23:16] has to attract Us by
[23:19] signs but every sign has a voice behind
[23:23] it
[23:25] amen God met Moses and told him was
[23:28] going to take place and he gave him two
[23:31] signs and each sign had a voice a voice
[23:36] of the sign and every sign from God is
[23:40] followed by a voice every time God gives
[23:43] a true sign there is a voice that
[23:46] follows it and when you see some kind of
[23:49] phenomena coming along and watch it move
[23:51] and it doesn't change into something
[23:53] then it never came from God see God
[23:55] doesn't just show signs just to to show
[23:59] that he's
[24:00] God he doesn't have to show you a sign
[24:04] to prove that he's
[24:06] God there is a voice that will follow
[24:10] that sign you see signs to are are sent
[24:14] to attract attention and remember if the
[24:18] attention is attracted and it's the same
[24:20] old line it is in
[24:22] God but God was trying to attract his
[24:25] Prophet now so he gave him a sign
[24:29] he gave him a
[24:30] sign I thought about it you know we
[24:33] think about God gave Moses two signs but
[24:36] the two signs that God gave Moses was
[24:38] for the children of Israel but God gave
[24:41] Moses a
[24:42] sign God gave Moses a sign of a burning
[24:45] bush and then there was a voice that
[24:48] spoke out of
[24:50] that and that voice cannot just be any
[24:54] kind of a voice amen
[24:58] so it says God was trying to attract the
[25:00] prophet now and he gave him a sign and
[25:03] the voice that followed the sign was a
[25:06] scriptural
[25:10] voice there will be lots of signs and
[25:13] lots of things there'll be many things
[25:16] we'll see in the scriptures we'll also
[25:18] see in the message that there's lots of
[25:20] things are going to happen but brother
[25:22] sister watch for the voice and what kind
[25:26] of voice is following that
[25:30] sign
[25:32] amen
[25:36] amen praise the
[25:38] Lord I have seen the people I have heard
[25:42] their cry and I remember my
[25:46] promise God gave Abraham a promise that
[25:50] he would deliver the children of Israel
[25:52] with a mighty hand God has given us a
[25:56] promise that he will change mortal
[25:59] bodies and take us out of here right but
[26:03] we no matter how much fasting how much
[26:07] praying how sincere you are you will
[26:10] never bring that word to
[26:13] pass you cannot do
[26:16] that God has an appointed time for that
[26:20] God has an appointed time and he has
[26:23] appointed a people to fulfill that word
[26:28] word amen praise the
[26:33] Lord now God is going to speak he says
[26:37] by his promised word so his promise his
[26:40] promise to the children of Israel was
[26:42] that I will bring them out by a mighty
[26:45] hand now see I would just say well
[26:49] there'd be a great big hand come down
[26:50] out of Heaven one day and pick him up
[26:52] and take him out of there right you
[26:55] remember brother brandom said that he
[26:56] says oh he says the the the Pharisees
[26:58] and the Sadducees they said oh when God
[27:01] comes he's going to crank down the Out
[27:03] of Heaven to come a big staircase and
[27:05] Don will come Christ and he'll walk
[27:07] right up to Caiaphas the high priest and
[27:08] say here I am I'm the Messiah and the
[27:11] high places will be made low and the Low
[27:13] Places will be high and and there'll be
[27:15] Earth movers and and bulldozer and
[27:18] everything making everything he says
[27:20] that's a carnal mind he says but God
[27:23] will fulfill his word he shows a sign
[27:26] then he has a voice behind it
[27:29] amen God is going to speak by his
[27:32] promised word and he must send his
[27:35] Prophet for the word comes to the
[27:37] prophet the Bible said God said himself
[27:41] that he does nothing until he reveals it
[27:43] to his servants the prophets first see
[27:49] and then the sign is given and then the
[27:52] scripture is
[27:55] identified well CNN I'm going to tell
[27:58] you

[28:15] and I'm looking for the
[28:17] scripture
[28:20] amen first there's a sign is given and
[28:23] the scripture is
[28:25] identified and that's the voice of the
[28:29] sign you see the voice of the sign of
[28:32] Moses first the sign was the burning
[28:37] bush and the voice was the
[28:41] scripture I have come down to fulfill my
[28:47] promise and I'm sending Mo Moses he says
[28:50] because I'm a
[28:52] spirit I need somebody to work through
[28:55] I'm going to step inside the Veil
[28:59] amen didn't he say Moses Sav all these
[29:01] objections and everything else and Moses
[29:03] saidwell I can't speak and God said who
[29:05] made your mouth and he says and I I
[29:08] can't all that I'm I'm ineloquent and
[29:10] everything he says what happened to all
[29:11] the college education I gave
[29:13] you what happened to all this and he
[29:15] says and behold he says I will make you
[29:18] a god how's he going to do that God has
[29:22] to step in that side that Veil and he
[29:24] says I'm going to make Aaron your
[29:26] prophet
[29:29] amen
[29:31] amen see the voice of the sign of Moses
[29:34] the sign was the burning bush the voice
[29:38] was the scripture and now by God's help
[29:41] we'll find that in the scripture tonight
[29:44] and see if that's the
[29:45] truth see here's the Burning Bush was a
[29:49] sign to Moses that was a sign and it was
[29:52] given to and he heard the voice from the
[29:56] bush amen let's go over here to 1
[29:59] Corinthians chapter
[30:01] 2 praise the Lord
[30:06] amen
[30:13] amen in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:2 it
[30:17] says now we have received not the spirit
[30:22] of the
[30:23] world but the spirit which is of god
[30:30] I believe all of you believe you're born
[30:32] again you're saved so you have received
[30:36] the spirit of
[30:38] God and the reason that you've received
[30:40] the spirit of God Paul says that you
[30:44] might know the things that are freely
[30:47] given to us of God God will not hold
[30:52] back he told his he told his 12
[30:55] disciples he says well thus far he says
[30:57] I've told you some things but he says
[31:00] when the spirit of the Holy Ghost comes
[31:03] when the comforter comes he will reveal
[31:06] all things that you have need of when
[31:09] you have need of
[31:10] it not
[31:13] before when you have need of it he will
[31:16] re he will give it to us
[31:19] freely freely that's what it says that
[31:23] we might know the things that are freely
[31:26] given to us of God which things also we
[31:30] speak not in The Words which man's
[31:32] Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[31:35] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[31:41] spiritual so when you see all these
[31:45] things happening and you see all the
[31:48] problems and all look in the
[31:54] scriptures don't don't look out and say
[31:56] oh I think I'm going to Google it and
[31:57] find out what what's going
[31:59] on because it's a sign see to the world
[32:04] it's a sign but they don't know it to
[32:07] the believer it's a sign that we know
[32:10] we're getting close to the end but how
[32:13] do we know that we're getting close to
[32:14] the end because we take the sign and we
[32:17] look in the scriptures and say Hey There
[32:20] It Is he already told us and then we
[32:24] know that we've heard the voice amen
[32:29] so he says which things also we speak
[32:31] not in The Words which man's Wisdom
[32:34] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[32:37] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[32:41] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[32:43] not the things of the spirit of God for
[32:47] they are foolishness unto
[32:49] him when you try to tell somebody about
[32:52] God sending a prophet and they laugh in
[32:53] your face you see it's a natural man
[32:57] there's no rece ceing Tower in
[32:59] there for their are foolishness unto him
[33:03] neither can he know them because they
[33:05] are spiritually
[33:08] discerned amen amen praise the
[33:13] Lord so we see that brother Brenham
[33:16] taught he said Moses before Moses could
[33:20] could step into the office and fulfill
[33:23] his part in God's plan God had to send
[33:27] Moses a sign that would attract his
[33:31] attention and then when it attracted his
[33:33] attention it had a scriptural voice that
[33:38] followed it and if it's not a scriptural
[33:42] voice
[33:44] then something's
[33:46] wrong because every sign has got a
[33:49] scriptural voice that's what we're going
[33:51] to find out so let's go to John chapter
[33:55] 1 amen
[34:04] John chapter
[34:06] 1 verse
[34:09] 35 again the next day after John stood
[34:13] and two of his disciples and looking
[34:15] Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold
[34:19] the Lamb of
[34:21] God we know that John the
[34:25] Baptist was a
[34:28] Elijah and we know that
[34:30] God placed him in the scriptures if we
[34:34] were to take a study on John we would
[34:36] see that when they came and asked him
[34:38] you know they all came out because John
[34:41] he just showed up one day one day he
[34:43] just showed up
[34:44] just Jordan River the Kingdom of Heaven
[34:47] is at hand repent Make Way for God he's
[34:51] on his way in the whole city everybody
[34:53] they were all moved but when they came
[34:56] out because they did not have a receiver
[35:01] on the inside of them they did not
[35:04] recognize they saw the sign but they
[35:06] couldn't receive the
[35:08] voice they saw the sign and they said
[35:11] who are
[35:12] you they said are you the
[35:15] Christ are you the prophet are you this
[35:19] are you that and John when he answered
[35:21] them he said I am the voice of one
[35:25] crying in the wilderness which was a SC
[35:27] scriptural
[35:29] voice for the sign that he had and
[35:33] brother renham said he said God will do
[35:35] nothing so the Messiah couldn't come
[35:39] unless there was a prophet on the face
[35:41] of the Earth to identify the
[35:44] sign there had to be somebody standing
[35:47] there identifying the sign and he turned
[35:50] to two of his disciples he said Behold
[35:53] the Lamb of God and they looked and they
[35:57] didn't see see a
[35:59] lamb they didn't even see a lion of the
[36:01] tribe of
[36:02] Judah they just saw a man in clothes
[36:07] that look like brother Ron how
[36:09] disappointing is
[36:12] that they just looked but because the
[36:15] prophet pointed out the
[36:18] sign they followed and what were they
[36:21] looking for The
[36:24] Voice they were looking for that
[36:29] and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he
[36:31] said Behold the Lamb of God and the two
[36:34] disciples heard him speak and they
[36:37] followed the
[36:39] sign they followed Jesus and Jesus
[36:43] turned and saw them following and said
[36:46] unto
[36:48] them why are you looking for why are you
[36:51] following me what are you looking for
[36:55] what are you seeking for
[36:58] and they
[36:59] said Rabbi which is a first interpreted
[37:04] Master where dwellest thou and he said
[37:07] unto them come and see and they came and
[37:11] saw where he dwelt and Abode with him
[37:13] that day for it was about the 10th hour
[37:18] amen and one of the two which heard John
[37:21] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[37:26] Peter's brother
[37:29] now this is going to get really
[37:33] important and he first found his own
[37:35] brother Simon because Andrew recognized
[37:40] the
[37:41] sign but he also heard the
[37:45] voice he he not only saw the sign but he
[37:47] saw the scriptural
[37:49] voice and he went and he found Peter his
[37:53] brother he went to Simon he said Simon
[37:56] we have
[37:58] found we have found the
[38:01] Messiah we have found him who we have
[38:03] been waiting for
[38:07] amen
[38:09] Amen brother brandham in a message
[38:11] called it is I he said and after we had
[38:14] prayed I can see my dad he's talking
[38:16] about Peter giving this testimony I see
[38:19] my dad brush back the gray hairs from
[38:21] his face he put his arm around me and he
[38:23] set me up on the boat and he said
[38:25] Simon my little boy I've pred you to
[38:28] serve God to the best of my
[38:30] knowledge that's that's the most a
[38:33] parent can do I raised you to the best
[38:36] of my knowledge to serve God and he said
[38:39] Simon I like all True Believers have
[38:42] looked forward for the day that when the
[38:45] Messiah would come and I thought I would
[38:48] see him in my day but Simon I'm getting
[38:52] old now and my days are numbered and my
[38:55] steps are getting shorter and perhaps I
[38:59] I maybe I won't see him but Simon my son
[39:03] you are the younger so perhaps you will
[39:06] see the Messiah that we've looked for
[39:08] for all these years the hope of
[39:11] Israel and Simon before he comes there
[39:15] will be many things that are raise up
[39:17] down through the age saying they are all
[39:19] Messiahs and all these things and
[39:21] brother bandam said all kinds of
[39:23] fanaticism and all kinds of turmoil and
[39:26] all these things will
[39:29] happen and Simon's dad is telling him
[39:32] the same
[39:33] thing and when by the time of his coming
[39:36] there'll be all kinds of things raised
[39:37] up but Simon the church has gotten off
[39:40] on many Tantrums but I want to tell you
[39:43] my son you remember to believe what
[39:46] Moses said our Prophet that when the
[39:49] Messiah comes Moses told us that the
[39:52] Lord Our God should raise up a prophet
[39:54] liken unto Moses and he would be the one
[39:57] that we were to go to and Simon whatever
[40:01] you do always remember no matter how
[40:05] anything looks
[40:06] remember the Messiah will be a prophet
[40:10] for it's according to the
[40:14] scriptures don't be carried away Simon
[40:19] with foolish things and strange
[40:22] doctrines but stay with the scripture my
[40:26] son stay with the scripture people are
[40:29] all afraid oh no gas is $4 a gallon what
[40:32] do I do what do I do what do I who cares
[40:36] what does the scripture
[40:38] say what does the scripture say it's a
[40:42] sign it's a sign he said I'll shake the
[40:45] heavens and I'll shake the Earth that
[40:47] everything that can be shaken will be
[40:49] shaken and when I see those things
[40:51] shaken am I
[40:53] shaken because I'm based on a solid rock
[41:00] amen I've seen the sign and I've heard
[41:03] the voice amen don't be carried
[41:07] away the Messiah will be a prophet and
[41:11] the sign of the Messiah now we haven't
[41:13] had a prophet for hundreds of years but
[41:15] one day there will be one raised on the
[41:17] scene that will be a prophet and that
[41:19] will be the Messiah because we are
[41:20] waiting for that day now I want you to
[41:24] watch
[41:27] so verse 41 he said and he first findeth
[41:31] his own brother Simon and he saith unto
[41:33] him we have found the Messiah which is
[41:35] being interpreted the Christ and he
[41:38] brought Simon to Jesus and when Jesus
[41:42] beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the
[41:45] son of Jonah Thou shalt be called sephus
[41:49] which is by interpretation a
[41:53] stone how many people in this room know
[41:56] what the word what Peter
[42:00] means what does Peter
[42:04] mean you better say it
[42:07] louder do you know that that was a
[42:10] hidden
[42:12] Mystery that only the god of Heaven knew
[42:16] because you look in any dictionary you
[42:17] look at the meaning of Peter and it'll
[42:19] say
[42:20] aaq and how do we know that because the
[42:23] Messiah gave a voice and he had a
[42:26] scriptural
[42:27] sign praise the
[42:30] Lord
[42:32] amen things that were it was freely
[42:35] given to
[42:37] you praise God
[42:41] Amen so he told Peter he gave Peter a
[42:44] new
[42:45] name in verse 43
[42:49] says and the day following Jesus would
[42:52] go forth into Galilee and he findeth
[42:55] Phillip and saith unto him Follow
[42:58] Me Now how many people do you think
[43:00] dwelt in
[43:03] Galilee 200,000
[43:07] 500,000 well I don't know how many
[43:09] people lived in Galilee but let's say
[43:11] there was 500,000 you know Jesus knew
[43:14] exactly where philli was and could call
[43:18] him by
[43:19] name how many people are in
[43:22] Flint God knew sister ly he called her
[43:26] by name he called sister Linda by name
[43:29] he called brother Keith by name you know
[43:31] how blessed you are that he called you
[43:33] by his your name in this big city in
[43:37] this big
[43:38] world did you ever read in Genesis it
[43:41] said that when when men started to
[43:43] multiply in the face of the Earth so did
[43:46] Sin but yet God knew your
[43:50] name and called
[43:53] you and how many people would say I
[43:56] ain't going
[43:58] but you yet you
[44:01] Hallelujah
[44:03] you when he said follow me you said yeah
[44:06] I'm
[44:07] going amen you left you followed
[44:11] him your family didn't follow him you
[44:15] told them they couldn't hear a that's
[44:18] not a sign that's not a sign that's not
[44:22] a voice that's not but yet you heard the
[44:25] you saw the sign and then you heard the
[44:28] voice why are you
[44:31] afraid you see God has set you on such
[44:34] Solid Ground you can't miss it you
[44:40] can't because you're
[44:42] here you're still following after
[44:46] him amen praise the Lord
[44:50] amen amen the following day Jesus went
[44:54] forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip
[44:56] and saith unto him follow me now look at
[44:59] this Philip was of Bethesda the city the
[45:02] same city of Andrew and
[45:06] Peter amen God knew Philip he knew right
[45:10] where he
[45:11] was praise the Lord now I want you to
[45:14] notice something here brother Brenham
[45:16] said improving his word this is great he
[45:19] said Phillip seen this
[45:22] happening what did he see he was in the
[45:26] audience when Simon came in the back
[45:29] door and Jesus in the middle of his
[45:31] sermon stopped and said hey that's Simon
[45:35] and not only do I know you I know your
[45:40] daddy you're the son of Jonas and he
[45:43] I've heard his prayers many times and he
[45:46] says and now
[45:49] you I'll make you a Fisher am men and
[45:53] I'm going to change your name I'm going
[45:55] to call you sephus which means Peter
[45:59] which we all know means a stone a
[46:02] Rock
[46:04] Amen praise the Lord and when Phillip
[46:08] saw that he got pretty excited about it
[46:12] because he saw the sign he heard the
[46:14] voice he went back and looked at Moses's
[46:17] Prophecy and he said this is that which
[46:20] was prophesied by our Moses and he ran
[46:25] all the way around the mountain on the
[46:26] other side M about a Day's Journey and
[46:28] he found his his prayer partner
[46:31] Nathaniel and he went and got Nathaniel
[46:34] he said Nathaniel we have found the
[46:37] Fulfillment of the
[46:40] scriptures and Nathaniel said well
[46:42] that's a good thing because I've been
[46:43] waiting a long time for the Salvation of
[46:45] Israel he says it's Jesus of Nazareth he
[46:49] says what nothing what Jesus of Flint
[46:52] Michigan are you kidding you can't even
[46:54] drink the water there
[46:59] can anything good come out of
[47:02] Flint can anything come out of Detroit
[47:05] are you kidding
[47:09] me yeah but you know Phillip Phillip
[47:13] don't care about your you know see he's
[47:16] there's some you know when God's got a
[47:19] hold of you and that hook that gospel
[47:22] Hook is stuck in your mouth don't matter
[47:24] what the name Sayer say didn't matter
[47:27] you know most of us we have got
[47:28] discouraged oh Phillip or Nathaniel why
[47:32] don't you believe anything I say
[47:34] what no Philip says well if you don't
[47:37] believe me come on and come and see come
[47:39] and see for yourself come and see and
[47:43] see if it's not the Fulfillment of the
[47:48] scriptures so what are you worried about
[47:52] why are you
[47:53] afraid why are you why what
[48:01] so he took off around the mountain it
[48:03] was gone about a day and he come back
[48:04] and he brought him a friend named
[48:06] Nathaniel And he was these things are
[48:08] really happening Moses said the Lord Our
[48:11] God shall raise up a prophet like him
[48:13] and here the man is and why he told
[48:15] Simon who he was even even who his
[48:18] father was and we know that what he said
[48:20] it's the truth because we're all in the
[48:22] same city we're in the same fishing
[48:24] Association
[48:27] go and study the scriptures you'll find
[48:30] out
[48:32] amen Andrew and Simon and Phillip and
[48:35] they were all fishermen
[48:38] together because God said it in the word
[48:43] and here it is proved that he will to is
[48:47] going to do that and that proves that
[48:51] this is the
[48:53] Messiah which means you have no thought
[48:56] but
[49:01] coming you have no opinion
[49:06] coming you think you have an opinion
[49:08] about politics and the economy and
[49:11] what's going on but you
[49:13] don't because if you're the scriptures
[49:16] you can only say what the scripture
[49:19] says Jesus didn't get caught up with the
[49:22] Pharisees and the Sadducees and all
[49:24] their things and their doings and
[49:25] everything else he said said I have come
[49:28] to do thy will oh God and God has come
[49:33] and chosen you and you have a right to
[49:36] say the same thing that Jesus said I
[49:40] have come into this world to do his
[49:44] will not
[49:49] mine and when he walked up in his
[49:52] presence Jesus said to him he said
[49:54] behold an Israelite in whom there is no
[49:58] guile and Nathaniel said
[50:01] Rabbi wow one place brother brandom said
[50:04] that took all the air out of his
[50:06] sails he thought he was quite the guy he
[50:09] thought he knew the scripture he says
[50:11] how how H how how did you know me I I
[50:15] just today I just met you here today
[50:17] how'd you know me he says I saw you when
[50:21] you were praying underneath the tree and
[50:24] I heard your prayer and he
[50:28] he's he's kind of like me he says oh
[50:30] you're the
[50:33] Messiah and Jesus told him he says
[50:35] because I said
[50:36] this he said Thou Art the king of
[50:40] Israel he was just as much as Peter
[50:42] saying Thou Art the Christ the son of
[50:44] the Living God Nathaniel was saying the
[50:46] same thing and Jesus said he said you
[50:48] think this is great he saidou going to
[50:51] see greater things than this all you got
[50:53] to do is keep following
[50:57] keep following stay with the
[51:00] scriptures stay with what God has done
[51:04] stay and when you see these things rise
[51:07] up in all this turmoil and all this
[51:10] stuff go and just just stand back and
[51:13] say
[51:14] Lord this is a sign I know it's a sign
[51:17] it's some kind of a sign where it show
[51:20] me in the
[51:21] scriptures show me what you want me to
[51:24] see what if Moses saw the burning book
[51:26] and said wow this is really great I
[51:28] think I'll just take a picture on my
[51:29] iPhone and I'll put it on Twitter and
[51:31] I'll get 12,000 likes and didn't even
[51:33] went up
[51:34] there what good is
[51:37] that
[51:39] amen praise the
[51:41] Lord praise the
[51:44] Lord praise
[51:46] God
[51:48] Amen can I give you one
[51:50] more let's go back here to First
[51:53] Kings 22
[52:05] amen First Kings 22 starting in verse
[52:08] one it
[52:09] says and they continued three years
[52:12] without war between Syria and
[52:14] Israel and it came to pass in the third
[52:17] year now let's see that sounds like it's
[52:18] a pretty good thing no Wars everything's
[52:21] going fine
[52:23] wonderful came to pass in the third year
[52:25] that Jehosaphat
[52:27] the king of Judah came down to the king
[52:29] of Israel and the king of Israel said
[52:31] unto his servants know ye that rth and
[52:35] Gilead is ours and we be still and take
[52:38] it not out of the hand of the king of
[52:40] Syria and he said un Jehosaphat wil thou
[52:44] go go with me to battle to rth Gilead
[52:47] and Jehoshaphat said to the king of
[52:49] Israel I am as Thou Art my people as thy
[52:53] people and my horses as thy
[52:57] horses that's quite the
[53:00] commitment you
[53:04] know brother bam says and it was during
[53:07] the time of the reign of Ahab the king
[53:09] of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of
[53:12] Judah and we all know that how during
[53:16] the reign of Ahab as far as
[53:19] materially it
[53:21] prospered things were
[53:24] prospering but spiritually speaking it
[53:27] was at a low
[53:30] EB but Jehoshaphat was a
[53:34] Believer his father before him was a
[53:36] Believer and then one day Jehoshaphat
[53:39] made the wrong move which is most likely
[53:43] to come to every one of us that we will
[53:46] make that wrong move it's so easy
[53:50] Jehoshaphat went down to visit Ahab and
[53:53] that's where he made a
[53:55] mistake the Bible ible said for us to
[53:57] come out from amongst unbelievers and
[54:00] not be connected and associated with
[54:03] unbelievers and Jehosaphat came down to
[54:05] visit Ahab and Ahab wanted to show him a
[54:07] great time so Ahab he had an axe to
[54:11] grind and usually that's the way the
[54:14] world does they have an axe to grind so
[54:17] when josaphat was a mighty man and God
[54:20] was with him and when he come down Ahab
[54:22] showed him such great Hospitality but
[54:25] Ahab said you know know there's this
[54:27] little piece of ground up in Rama up in
[54:29] rth and Gilead that really belongs to us
[54:32] I want you to go up with me and help me
[54:33] to take this see he wasn't just
[54:36] satisfied and I think that's a lot like
[54:39] people are like
[54:41] Ahab I say that Ahab was a borderline
[54:44] believer a lukewarm half-baked
[54:47] so-called
[54:51] believer notice and they've always got
[54:54] an axe to grind
[54:57] he wasn't satisfied with what he had he
[54:59] had to try to get
[55:00] more and that's the way the church gets
[55:03] sometimes you can't be satisfied with
[55:05] Jesus and good old-fashioned experience
[55:07] of a good old backward sky blue sin
[55:11] killing religion you have to go dangling
[55:13] around in the world after something else
[55:15] and the devil's always present to give
[55:18] you what you're looking
[55:20] for
[55:22] amen and verse five
[55:25] says and
[55:27] Jehosaphat said unto the king of Israel
[55:30] inquire I pray thee at the word of the
[55:33] Lord
[55:36] today and that's where Jehoshaphat made
[55:39] his
[55:41] mistake hooking up with
[55:44] Ahab then being a spiritual man though
[55:47] he said yes I'll go with you but first
[55:51] let's consult the
[55:54] Lord that's a good thing pray in
[56:00] everything amen so if take a little
[56:02] detour
[56:05] here though you already know all these
[56:08] things we are stirring up your
[56:13] minds Matthew
[56:17] 6 I remember when the Lord first showed
[56:21] me this
[56:28] Matthew
[56:30] 6:25 therefore I say unto you take no
[56:33] thought for your life what you shall eat
[56:36] or what you shall drink nor yet for your
[56:39] body and what you shall put on
[56:42] it is not your life more than meat and
[56:47] your body more than
[56:49] Ramen behold the fowls of the air for
[56:52] they sow not neither do they reap nor
[56:55] Gathering Burns
[56:56] which we all do right we make all plans
[57:00] we reap we go to the store we buy stuff
[57:02] we put it in the freezer we do all these
[57:04] things and then Detroit Edison there's a
[57:06] storm comes and there's no electricity
[57:08] for seven days and all of our food
[57:10] spoils right and that what happens but
[57:14] God if he can watch over The Sparrows he
[57:18] can watch over
[57:20] you
[57:22] amen so why are you all afraid
[57:28] your heavenly father Feth
[57:30] them are you not much better than
[57:34] they and which of You by taking thought
[57:37] can add one cubit unto your
[57:40] stature everybody in here everybody
[57:43] everybody I know of wants to lose 10
[57:47] pounds and I'm telling you you can fast
[57:49] and pray and you probably
[57:53] won't because by taking thought you
[57:56] can't add a cubit you can't change the
[57:59] color of your hair you can't turn back
[58:01] the
[58:03] time god holds all these things and they
[58:07] are spiritually discerned and he called
[58:10] you out of Flint that Wicked
[58:13] City and he left your neighbors behind
[58:16] but he called you and you
[58:18] answered it ought to give you some
[58:20] confidence that God is in
[58:23] charge
[58:24] amen and why take you thought for
[58:28] ramen consider the lies of field how
[58:31] they grow they toil not neither do they
[58:34] spin but I say unto you that even
[58:36] Solomon in all of his glory was not AR
[58:38] raid like one of these I want you to
[58:42] think of verse 30 because I thought on
[58:44] this today while I was sitting on my
[58:45] front porch I was thinking huh wherefore
[58:50] if God so clothe the grass of the
[58:53] field which today is
[58:57] and tomorrow thrown into the
[59:01] fire but today it's
[59:03] beautiful today the trees are beautiful
[59:07] they got green leaves on them and it's
[59:09] wonderful to hear the birds singing in
[59:10] them and and the wind blowing but
[59:13] tomorrow they're going to Autumn's going
[59:15] to come the cold winds will come the sap
[59:18] will run down the trees will wrinkle up
[59:21] the leaves will fall to the ground is
[59:23] that right and Jesus said wherefore God
[59:27] so clothe the grass of the field which
[59:29] today is tomorrow is cast Into the Fire
[59:32] shall he not much more clothe
[59:38] you ye of so little
[59:43] faith therefore take no thought saying
[59:46] what should we eat what should we drink
[59:48] what should we wear where are we going
[59:50] how wish I do this why I do
[59:54] that oh who's going to win this what's
[59:56] about the election what about the
[59:58] economy what am I going to do about oh
[59:59] what the green New Deal and
[1:00:02] all
[1:00:04] whoa seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:00:08] heaven and all these other
[1:00:11] things will they'll they'll be
[1:00:14] fine because I'm from above I'm not from
[1:00:18] here
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] amen let's go back to First Kings
[1:00:27] First Kings
[1:00:31] 22:6 says then the king of Israel
[1:00:34] gathered His prophets together about 400
[1:00:37] men and said unto them shall I go
[1:00:39] against rth Gilead to battle or sure
[1:00:42] shall I forbear and they said go up for
[1:00:46] the Lord shall deliver it into the hand
[1:00:47] of the king they were all in one mind
[1:00:51] and one Accord behind a guy that brother
[1:00:56] brandom said
[1:00:59] was a make believer and that
[1:01:03] spiritually he was at a low E and all
[1:01:06] these guys they all got excited they
[1:01:08] said Oh no you're the one we we do
[1:01:10] whatever you say we're going to do it
[1:01:11] we're going to do it we're gonna do it
[1:01:13] we're gonna get with it we're GNA get
[1:01:14] with the
[1:01:17] program and
[1:01:19] Jehoshaphat the
[1:01:22] believer he listened and he said is
[1:01:24] there not a prophet of the the Lord
[1:01:26] besides that we might inquire of him and
[1:01:28] the king of Israel got really mad he
[1:01:31] said why don't you just do what I say
[1:01:40] do there is somebody Miki the son of
[1:01:43] imla oh Micaiah the son of imla by whom
[1:01:48] we may inquire of the Lord but you know
[1:01:50] I don't like him because he never says
[1:01:52] anything good about me
[1:01:56] but
[1:01:57] evil and jhus fet said
[1:02:00] well can I hear him for
[1:02:03] myself then the king of Israel called an
[1:02:05] officer and said hasten
[1:02:08] hither
[1:02:10] um Micaiah i gota i m yeah
[1:02:15] Micaiah I looked that up listen to it
[1:02:18] 100
[1:02:19] times hasten hither Micaiah the son of
[1:02:22] imla and the king of Israel and
[1:02:24] Jehoshaphat the king of Judas set each
[1:02:26] on his throne having put on their robes
[1:02:28] in a void place in the entrance of the
[1:02:31] Gate of Samaria and you could preach
[1:02:33] three hours on that
[1:02:35] scripture and all the prophets
[1:02:37] prophesied before them and zedekiah the
[1:02:40] son of uh
[1:02:43] chamana made him horns of iron and he
[1:02:45] said thus sayeth the Lord with thee
[1:02:48] shalt thou push the syrians until thou
[1:02:50] has consumed them and all the prophets
[1:02:52] prophesied saying go on up to ramth
[1:02:55] Gilead and pray Prosper for the Lord
[1:02:57] should deliver it into the king's hand
[1:02:59] and we're going to be better off it'll
[1:03:01] be great I
[1:03:04] promise and the messenger that was gone
[1:03:07] to call Micaiah spake unto him saying
[1:03:10] behold now the words of the prophets
[1:03:13] declare good unto the king with one
[1:03:15] mouth let Thy word I pray thee be like
[1:03:18] the word of one of them and speak that
[1:03:19] which is
[1:03:20] good and Micaiah said as the Lord liveth
[1:03:25] what the the Lord saith unto me that
[1:03:28] will I
[1:03:29] speak we need
[1:03:32] Believers that believe
[1:03:35] that not what they read on the internet
[1:03:38] not what they see that got tweeted not
[1:03:41] what they see on the news it's okay to
[1:03:43] watch a news but go and see what the the
[1:03:48] sign you see the sign what's the
[1:03:51] scriptural
[1:03:52] voice stay with the scriptures Simon
[1:03:56] many things are going to be
[1:03:59] happening verse 15
[1:04:01] says praise the
[1:04:05] Lord oh I was supposed to stop at
[1:04:10] 12 the greatest man in the nation in the
[1:04:13] military and the national site was
[1:04:15] zedekiah he was the head Prophet by the
[1:04:17] king he was the head of all the other
[1:04:19] prophets by organization he was made by
[1:04:22] his organization the head of all of them
[1:04:24] probably the best r the best educated
[1:04:26] more eligible for the job and he was
[1:04:29] anointed with the holy spirit because he
[1:04:31] was called a prophet sure not just an
[1:04:34] ordinary prophet he was a Hebrew
[1:04:37] Prophet pay
[1:04:40] attention he had the goods brother
[1:04:43] brandham said he was a Hebrew
[1:04:49] Prophet so watch him zedekiah said the
[1:04:52] Lord spoke to me make me these two horns
[1:04:54] of iron and Assemble and a prophet
[1:04:57] usually gives symbols he said make these
[1:04:59] two horns of iron the holy spirit said
[1:05:01] to me take these the anointing that
[1:05:03] blessed me don't think it's a
[1:05:05] sacrificial but to get to a point the
[1:05:08] holy spirit that speaks in tongues
[1:05:10] through me the one that's Vindicated me
[1:05:13] he said take these horns and by this
[1:05:15] tell the king that to push Syria Plum
[1:05:17] out of the country and I will give him
[1:05:19] back the land that rightly belongs to
[1:05:21] Israel the church and brother that's
[1:05:23] pretty fundamental
[1:05:26] just about like balum was up
[1:05:41] there so verse
[1:05:43] 15 so he came to the king and the King
[1:05:45] said unto him Micaiah shall we go
[1:05:49] against Rond Gile to battle or shall we
[1:05:51] forbear and he said I'm just going to
[1:05:53] tell you what you want to hear go and
[1:05:55] prosper
[1:05:56] go and have a good
[1:05:58] time woohoo it's going to be
[1:06:03] great and Ahab said how
[1:06:06] many how many times I have to adure you
[1:06:09] to say only what God has said
[1:06:12] oh that changes
[1:06:14] everything I adure Thee that thou tell
[1:06:17] me nothing but that which is true in the
[1:06:20] name of the Lord and Mah said I saw all
[1:06:24] Israel scattered upon the hills as a
[1:06:26] sheep that have not a shepherd and the
[1:06:29] Lord said these have no master let them
[1:06:31] return every man to his house and peace
[1:06:35] and the king of Israel said unto
[1:06:36] josaphat did not I tell you that he
[1:06:39] would prophesy no good can thing
[1:06:41] concerning me but
[1:06:44] evil I told
[1:06:47] you and he said hear thou therefore the
[1:06:52] word of the
[1:06:53] Lord I Saw the Lord s sitting on his
[1:06:56] throne and all the hosts of Heaven
[1:06:58] standing by him on his right hand and on
[1:07:01] his left and the Lord said who shall
[1:07:04] persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall
[1:07:08] at rth
[1:07:10] Gilead now why would God say that to his
[1:07:19] angels because he had a Vindicated
[1:07:24] Prophet named El
[1:07:26] Elijah who said Ahab because of your
[1:07:31] wickedness the dogs will lick your blood
[1:07:35] where the dogs will lick the blood of
[1:07:37] Jezebel your
[1:07:43] wife it wasn't that Miki wanted to
[1:07:48] see Israel be destroyed it wasn't that
[1:07:51] he wanted to see Judah fall it wasn't he
[1:07:53] he he could only
[1:07:58] say what the Bible already
[1:08:07] said and one said on this manner and
[1:08:10] another one said on that manner and
[1:08:12] there came forth a spirit and stood
[1:08:15] before the Lord and said I will persuade
[1:08:18] him and the Lord said unto him wherewith
[1:08:22] and he said I will go forth I will be a
[1:08:25] lying spirit in the mouth of all of his
[1:08:28] prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade
[1:08:32] him and
[1:08:34] Prevail go forth and do
[1:08:44] so now you're the
[1:08:47] congregation and which one is
[1:08:50] right both of
[1:08:52] them both of them were Prophets
[1:08:55] and the only way you can tell the
[1:08:57] difference in them is to check it by the
[1:09:02] word he said how did you get this he
[1:09:05] said I saw God sitting upon a throne and
[1:09:07] I saw all the counsil around him and
[1:09:10] remember zedekiah just said he saw God
[1:09:13] too In The Same Spirit I saw God he told
[1:09:17] me to make these horns out of iron go
[1:09:20] out there and push the Nations out of
[1:09:21] there for this belongs to us the others
[1:09:23] ain't got no right to it they would if
[1:09:25] they' have stayed with the go with God
[1:09:28] they would have had that but they got
[1:09:29] away from God and that's the way the
[1:09:32] organization is the church it's got
[1:09:34] right into these things but you've been
[1:09:37] cheated out of it because you got away
[1:09:39] from God's word and God's spirit
[1:09:43] anointing to vindicate the word of the
[1:09:47] Season don't you fail to get this
[1:09:51] message notice what taking place now
[1:09:56] he said I saw God myi did setting upon
[1:10:01] the throne in heaven his counil was
[1:10:03] gathered around him and he said who can
[1:10:06] we get to go down and deceive Ahab to
[1:10:10] make alijah's words come
[1:10:13] true my Prophet that was
[1:10:17] Vindicated I spoke that he would come
[1:10:20] and Elijah had my word and heavens and
[1:10:24] earth will pass away
[1:10:26] but my word will not fail I don't care
[1:10:30] how modern they get how good they get
[1:10:34] how educated they get how big they get
