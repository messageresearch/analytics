believe [Music] lord i believe all things [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe amen our lord jesus said do you now believe amen what a you know what a privilege it is to be able to believe there are people on the earth who can't believe that's right is that right amen because they don't know what to believe you gotta faith has to be based on something and there's only one thing that faith can truly be based on and that's the word of god amen you can't base it on hope or imagination or none of it will ever work but if you anchor your faith on the word of god every promise of the word can can be manifested in your life amen amen jesus never did say we've said it many many times but one day it's going to grab a hold of us jesus never ever said did you feel it but he did say did you believe it if thoughts can believe all things are possible all things you think the dead can be raised all things you think blinded eyes can open all things you think a drunk become a preacher all things if thou s can believe well brother daryl i've got the worst situation in my life but you've got an answer for it jesus christ is the answer for every question that we have amen he's the answer to what's happening in our nation right now the reason our nation is in the condition is because they've rejected the answer to the question amen he is the answer amen if you're thinking if you're thinking biden's the answer you're sadly mistaken if you think trump is the answer you are sadly mistaken amen there's only one answer and that's the lord jesus christ and i'm glad to know him aren't you tonight amen you remember that night he came to you do you remember where he was at i remember i'll never forget there's no building by myself down in jonesburg tennessee about two o'clock in the afternoon i've been out drinking the night before i had a habit of my life i come out of the army with some habits that i'd be ashamed for you to know and i've been out all night long and there's an old building about two o'clock in the afternoon on a sunday he came into the room where i was at i knew it was him because i felt him when i was a boy and a voice spoke and said you go out that door i'll never call you again and there and that old building by myself i knelt at that door of that building and gave my heart to the lord amen you know i called that old place my birthplace and i used to you know you travel some you get a little tired i used to go down by there and i get a little tired and i pull in there and i just sit and remember sometimes it's good to just sit and remember what the lord did for you and i would just sit there and remember that day that he came to me and i got busy traveling it had been several years since i've been by that way and i was over in that part of the woods and i said you know i believe i'll go by the old birthplace i went down by there and it was gone the building was tore down the parking lot was changed there's a big supermarket there in the big old paint parking lot and lots everywhere kind of hurt my feelings a little bit but then i thought you know that's right they can change the landscape they can change the building but they can never take out of my heart what the lord did for me that day amen you'll never know him just by reading we have to know him by experience amen and i'm glad that we can deny do you love him we're kind of an honor to be with you and if you have your bibles turn with us to the book of mark and i just been seeking the lord all day of which direction to go and we trust her to please this would be pleasing to you we thought we'd take some of this and tied in with some of the last night and uh looking forward as we move into the dedicational service tomorrow of the of the new church that the lord has blessed you with and uh you know we looked at the scripture last night where the lord said my word will not return unto me void but it will accomplish that which i please amen and so you know when i was thinking on the theme of a new church and a dedication and you know what would we want to be and so i you know we'd want a church that he would be pleased to come and dwell in amen and so we looked at last night of what i was on this theme of what kind of church does god really want i mean does he want stained glass windows and fine carpet and fine pews and highly robed choirs and that might be all right but what does god really want for his church amen and so we looked at last night you know that god wants a church that will not turn back that no matter how bad the situation is or no matter what they throw at her she keeps marching towards the promise amen no turning back we're not going back we're going forward amen and so we looked at that last night and tonight we want to look at a thought of another along the lines of that god wants a church like him like him and that's what we want to look at tonight if you have your bibles turn with us to mark 10 we want to read starting at verse 35 and may the lord richly bless you and i appreciate brother john allowing us to come and i know dedicational services this weekend i i know he could have got a much greater minister to come and preach and yet he allowed me to come and i certainly appreciate that and i trust something to be said to help you and encourage you along the way but we want to read now from mark 10 verse 35 do you love him the bible says this then james and john the sons of zebedee came unto him saying master we would that thou should just do for us whatsoever we shall desire and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you and they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory but jesus said unto them ye know not what you ask can you drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with and they said unto him we can a good positive attitude we can and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized with shall ye be baptized amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word i want to speak to a few minutes this evening on ye shall indeed let us bow our heads oh lord father how we thank you this evening lord for your mercy that's been given to us and lord we thank you for the opportunity that we have to serve you lord knowing dear god that our faith tonight does not rest upon imagination dear god it doesn't rest upon an organization or a denominational program but our faith rests solely upon the word of god and lord as the old fellow said that time and he they ask him why do you carry the bible around you can't even read it he said because i carried around because i believe it he said i'd rather be standing upon the word than standing in the heavens and they said why would you say such a thing he said because the word said heavens that shall pass away but the word shall never fail and oh god that's where we want to anchor ourselves tonight is solely upon the word of god knowing lord that you'll bankrupt heaven before you let one promise fail the believer father we ask tonight lord that you would take this thought god and may the people understand it in the way lord that our hearts desire is to bring it god that you want a people lord who will be just like you and father we believe that through calvary lord through the death burial and the resurrection thou hast made a way lord for your church to accomplish that father god may we follow that program for it leads to eternal life bless your children tonight lord those that would be sick god those that would have a need may you just move among them lord in a great way and father we thank you for touching sister lafontaine last night lord and just the reading of the scripture just the quoting of the scripture at the end of the service of laying down the sleep that's asleep shall be sweet and the sister testified today that she went home and reminded you of that promise said she had been unable to sleep for several nights but she laid down and her sleep was sweet thank you lord thank you for keeping your word bless your children now father we ask for we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says amen god bless you may be seated now matthew in the matthew's version of it matthew 20 they said then came to him the mother of zebedee the children of her sons worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what will thou and she said unto him grant that these my two sons may sit thee one on the right hand and the other on the left and in thy kingdom now in the reading of the scriptures we find that there's two accounts of this event mark said it was james and john who asked jesus this question matthew said it was the mother that asked jesus this question but both matthew and mark agreed that it was james and john who answered we can and i believe that every person in this building this time can answer this same question by faith and the grace of almighty god is we can we can't overcome laodicea we can't overcome the devil we can't overcome habits in our life we can be victorious in this area that we're living in we can take a body change we can take a rapture why because the word of god says so amen oh my then we find in this passage of scriptures that they were desiring a position in his kingdom one wanting to sit on his right hand and the other wanting to sit on his left and jesus said unto them you don't know what you're asking you won't do you want to be a part of this kingdom and he said can you drink of the cup that i drink and can you be baptized with the baptism that i'm baptized with notice now he never said a cup in matthew he said my cup but he never said a baptism but he said this baptism the same cup the same baptism the same cup the same baptism and the word same means identical can you drink of the same cup and the same baptism and they said yes we can and jesus said ye shall indeed ye shall indeed not hope so not maybe not could be but you shall indeed it reminds me of elijah and elisha in the bible after 10 years of following elijah and his message and god never cut the message of elijah to fit elisha but he shaped elisha to fit elijah's message amen or his mantle and it came to pass that after 10 years we'd gone over and elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elijah said i pray let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i go when i'm taken from me then thou shall be so unto thee if not it shall not be so and it came to pass the bible said that they still went on and talked and behold there appeared a charitable fire and horses of fire parted them both asunder and elijah went up into a whirlwind and elisha saw it and he cried out my father and my father the chariots of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and down from the heavens came the mantle of elisha now notice they went down to the river and elijah took the mantle and he struck the water and the water parted and they went to the other side and elijah said unto elisha what do you will that i would do for you before i leave and elisha said i want a double portion of your spirit and elijah said thou has asked a hard thing but nonetheless if you see me when i go you can have what you asked for the charity fire came down picked up elijah and elisha kept his eyes on the promise and let me say that's what you must do tonight don't look at the situation don't look at that crippled leg don't look at that blinded eye keep your eye on the promise amen i am the lord thy god that healeth thee amen it comes and kept his eye upon the promise and when elijah went up down out of heaven came the mantle and elisha picked up the medal hang on here for a second he picked up the mantle don't be taking my man on hey buddy god bless you good to see you hey man watch your brother that's my man amen he saw the medal came down and the bible said he took the medal of elisha of elijah and he ripped his own clothes he rent his own clothes you know sometimes we need to rip off those garments of fear and the garments of doubt have the garments of depression and the oh my have the garments of our opinions and our own ideals we need to rip those garments off of it well i'll tell you the best thing i've ever done was take off the old coat and put on the new abraham hallelujah he ripped off his coat and he picked up the metal and elijah hallelujah and he goes down to the same river with the same metal with the same anointing hallelujah and he took the mantle and he struck the water and he said where is the god of elijah he oh my he wasn't asking a question he was making a statement that the god of elijah does now rest with elisha that's right amen not another mantle the same manner amen hallelujah oh my he took the same metal to the same water with the same god and got the same results because it was the same ministry thank you brother god bless you buddy amen but what did he ask for he asked for a double portion of his spirit that's right now look the prophet of god said one place that elijah had done four great miracles and elisha done eight double portion greater greater only but greater greater but only greater in in quantity and not quality i always have to slow down i say it backwards every time only greater equality not quality the quality was the same amen look at ruth and boaz ruth following the instructions of the naomi she goes down to the threshing floor in the barley season and nominee said cover yourself and go down there and mark the spot where he lays and when he lays down you lay down at his feet at about midnight boaz awoke and said who's there he felt somebody and she said it's ruth the handmaid spread thy garment thy skirt garment over me for thou art a near kisman and boaz took his garment and spread his garment over her she was covered she was covered by the same garment he was covered by not another garbage same garment amen she arose up early in the morning the bible said and he said to her take the veil that you're veiled with and he measured out six measures of fine barley a measure for each day oh wait a minute preacher there's seven days in the week you messed up no i didn't he gave her six measures of fine barley one measure for each day but you see on the seventh day he never gave her a measure you know why because of the sabbath day she didn't get a measure she got the lord of the harvest hallelujah and then the seven amen in the seven days we don't just get a prophecy we don't just get a tongue but every redemptive blessing amen is given back to the church hallelujah oh my you don't need a measure on the seventh day because on the seventh day she got him the lord of the harvest the two becoming one she laid at his feet with the same skirt same garment that he was covered with elijah and elisha share the same rule boaz and ruth share the same garment james and john was desiring to sit with him in glory to be where he was let me tell you something that is a great request i love that song you know we sing i just want to be where you are that's all they desired they just wanted to be where he was desire to sit with him in glory and jesus turned to james and john and said can you drink of the cup i drink from in other words she said unto them can you share in what i'm partaking of can you be a part of this are you a participator or a spectator can you get involved or sit idle amen i don't want to just come to church and sit if i come to church i want to do something i want to come through those doors shouting praises i want to come through those doors exalting my god that when i leave the building i can say what that sign said this day i give my all for jesus christ amen can you be a part of this can you be a part of what i'm a part of can you share in this he was asking them can you drink of the cup but what is the cup what is the color that he was asking can you drink of this cup i'm drinking from notice the cup was not empty nobody drinks one empty cup unless you got problems so what is the cup that he drank from that he asked him can you drink of this cup not a cup not a cup this cup that i drink from can you drink so we get a glimpse of the cup this cup what is it we get a glimpse of it in the garden of gethsemane when he was praying to the father matthew 26 39 and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as i will and he said have a father all things are possible unto thee yes amen she said lord you can do anything it's your program all things are possible take away this cup from me when he was sweating it out the prophet said the anointing left him in the garden and he was sweating it out as a man going to calvary and he said your god you can do anything don't make me drink this but nevertheless nevertheless it's the only time what did he say i come to do the will of my father this is the only place you'll ever find jesus sweating out his own will he said nevertheless not what i will but let thy will be done amen what is in this cup what is in this cup that he would pray don't make me drink it the prophet of god said it is the cup of bitter persecutions amen as the old song said everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die in other words everybody just wants to cake walk in is a cup of bitter persecution the bible said he was a man of sorrows that word sorrows you know what it means pain physical pain mental pain a man of sorrow acquainted with grief you know what that word means sickness that's right he was acquainted with sickness the prophet that god said that he raised that winter woman's son from the dead and went over and sat on a rock and groaned with a headache that's right it's the truth i'm trying to paint your picture just stay with me for a second i'm trying to get you to see what he was a man of sorrow equated with grief he was called beelzebub a devil raised a widow woman sun from the dead and groaned on a sat on a rock groaning with a headache stop the storm that was started think about this he stopped a storm that was started with 10 000 devils and yet laid on the boat to rest from the meetings he wept at lazarus grave the death of his friend then he raised him from the dead amen that's right and he asked his disciples can you drink of this cup he was told he was the devil mocked made fun of rejected lied on persecuted and killed it is the cup the prophet said of persecution the cup of rejection by the world the cup of bitterness the cup of ridicule the cup of hatred the cup of death the prophet said sometimes the torture that that a sign has to go through is amazing the torture that jesus went through to prove the sign of god that he was the messiah think of that the torture that jesus went through to prove he was the messiah the torture to prove the sign the difficulties the ministry will face to prove the gift many people want fame but not pain many people want to be a great preacher but they don't want the training that it takes to be that the mooding of the character of a son of god you see if god gave us everything we'd just be a bunch of small children but our character is not motive by what god gives us but our character is mooted by the things that we suffer can you drink of this cup can you drink of this cup and he they said they said we can and jesus said ye shall indeed amen and indeed they did even to the point that paul said after the crucif after his conversion he said we've heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it they were thrown in jail as we looked at last night beaten persecuted rejected hated all drinking from the same cup he drank from the apostle said they returned rejoicing because they were counted worthy to bear the reproach of his name hallelujah praise the lord worthy to perfect reproach the name of jesus let them laugh at us let them hate us let them persecute us it is a badge of honor to be hated by the world to be known as a jesus follower by the reproach of his name matthew was killed by a sword in ethiopia mark died in egypt after being dragged by horses through the street till he was dead luke was hanged in greece john was boiled at all sentenced to exile on the isle of patmos ended up dying of old age john was the only one of the disciples who died of old age and they tried their best to kill him but they couldn't of all the disciples john types the pride amen and let me say i want to serve notice to the devil tonight no matter what he does to this bride he will never stop this pride [Applause] we are more than conquerors where every enemy is under our feet what are we today what are we today we are risen in christ jesus with every enemy under our feet he's under my feet he's under my feet satan is under my feet amen more than just car curse we just walk right into it as an inheritance more than conquerors now we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated he said oh my i was i was twice my size now i would feel twice as good we are disputing with the conquered enemies every time you sit and argue with the devil you are arguing with a defeated enemy you shouldn't give him one ounce of your time [Music] you should just tell him sit down boy you're defeated amen god's purpose can never be defeated amen you shall indeed drink of the cup of better bitter persecution peter was crucified upside down james was thrown off of a roof of a church and when they found that didn't kill him they beat him to death james the son of zebedee was beheaded to jerusalem his guard was so moved by james's faith that he repented and declared his faith in christ and was beheaded with james but the man who's holding me as a prisoner was so moved by his testimony was so moved by his life that he repented himself and died with the one he was guarded oh god that's the real christian right there he just didn't talk to talk he lived it he lived such a life that his guard converted to christianity and died with him bartholomew i can't say his name bartholomew bartholo thank you brother somebody asked one time you speak a foreign language i said yeah it's foreign to me but they beat him to death with a whip andrew was crucified thomas was stabbed to death with the spirit india jude was killed by arrows matthias was stoned and then beheaded all drinking from the same why did they kill them like that why did they persecute him because they saw jesus in them if i'm gonna be hated by the world let me be hated because they see jesus in my life the prophet said in the church book not only is the candlestick of gold it is a beaten goat handcrafted of beaten code according to her blueprints which are spirit given outside of her lord and master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she's filling up the sufferings that christ is left behind her goods are dispelled her life is in jeopardy she's accounted a chic for the slaughter she's killed all the day long and suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bound not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and joy forever by the trials and testings of this life he shall indeed drink as we said last night many people think that christians that god loves us therefore we should never be sick that we should never have heartache or sorrow that we should we should we should never have to bury loved ones or battle pandemics we should never have mental pain physical pain every day should be blue skies but you see jesus never promised us that he just said can you drink of this cup he never said we wouldn't be persecuted mark laughed at hated ridiculed he never said we wouldn't get sick battle cancer but he did promise i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you amen amen many times we are led to that spot you say why is it if i go to church and i live with for god with all my heart and try to be a just and honest person all that christianity requires why is it that these things happen to me but you know many times they are blessings in disguisement many times we can't understand them but if you'll just let them alone god will work it out just right for the potter knows how to mold the clay amen you shall indeed drink of this cup that i drink amen some people tries to introduce christianity there's so much promises today made amongst christian people so many ministers promised people a false thing if you just come to christ all your troubles are settled i tell you when you come to christ that's when they begin why drinking from the cup now i said all that he said brother this is dedication service you've got us so depressed well you know sometimes you have to look at both sides of the coin and i'm fixing to flip the coin so hang on but why because they're drinking from this cup but i said all this to say this think about this for a moment all famous pictures before they can ever go into a hall of fame they first have to pass through the critics and the prophet said i like that because it's about like the church before the church can ever go into the great rapture it first has to come through the critics oh god are you listening to me look at where we're at look at what's happening around us look at all the things on the internet that's rising up against us look at all the critics who are posting all their commentaries come on somebody look at those around our ranks who has walked away friends that we used to eat with now are persecuting us but before we can ever go into the rapture we must go through the hall of critics could that be where we're at right now then how close are we from going home before the church can ever go into the great rapture it has to come through the critics all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution there is no excuses there's none that's the deferred i'll have to pass through the line of persecution and criticism but then if we pass through that with such a life that critics cannot point their finger to anything that's true then the pitcher is ready for the great hall of fame when all the critics get done with all their jabber and all their talk and all when they do all that they can do and the bride is still standing here and she's still presenting christ she's still come on somebody she's still so in love she's still reaching out with signs and wonders following the believer they will have to about the bible said every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord and the prophet of god said what's more this world will hear from god it will be through his bride before the church can ever be raptured and taken through the hall of fame it goes through the hall of critics all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution it must go through the criticism no criticism no glory have we not seen friends in just the last few years have we not seen an increase of critics from within and without many many of them that's right where listen to me god will never take a baby for his wife that's right if i told you i was getting married next week and you said who you marrying i said my my bride she's five-year-old you're gonna call it alone christ will never unite with a baby so what does the trials of testings of life what does it do it causes us to grow up through the tour to know what he wants done with the word and when we look hallelujah when we reproduce christ on the earth again he'll take us away remember if you follow christ you'll be hated by people for all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution and if you come to christ you'll not come by any church or any denomination or any creed not just by getting message books and wearing a message belt buckle and having a message picture on your wall there's only one way to come to christ and that is by the blood the blood is the only avenue amen it's too bad people come to a message search three times and we make them a message believer but let me tell you tonight saying to god if there's no repentance if there's no death of that old nature and you're not born again you have not arrived yet if christ is ever anchored in your soul you cannot walk away from the word he is the word brother why did this one walk away why did that one walk away because they never had a bird well that's all right man that's the truth how can you have the holy ghost and deny the very word that the holy ghost have vindicated amen the gentile church the real truth church of god has exposed herself to public persecution by taking god in his word and saying i believe that divine healing and the power of the resurrection i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever with all these old cold formal morgues say the days of miracles has passed we expose ourself and lay at his feet when the apostles said they returned rejoicing because they're counted worthy they rather approach of his name how happy we ought to be 1900 years later to see the same holy ghost and the same kind of people causing the same results from the outside pointing a scornful finger like they did the first church so are they doing it's coming so fast like they did the alphabet now they're doing it to the omega bride the same finger the same finger of thumb for finger people on the outside hating and doing the same things they did to the first church but at the same time a people on the earth who has the same resurrected power of the lord jesus on the inside stretching forth his hand to do signs and wonders that he did at the beginning the same event taking place now a persecution of god's people like it was in the days of old why because god was in them and with them and today slates of god we are coming under the critics we are coming under the score for why the same god that was with them is with us doing the same thing confirming his word that's the church he wants a church not formal not a church of creeds not a church of dogmas not just a bunch of quotas but he's looking for believers not somebody that'll quote it somebody that'll live it a new church let's have a new commitment a re-dedication we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken we are cast down but not destroyed a woman once said to her lord lord grant unto you my two sons that one was set on the right hand and the other left into thy kingdom and he said can you drink the cup that i drink that's bitter persecution yes and he said you shall indeed drink and as we just proved it by the bible and by the message that his words were true amen for they surely indeed drank that cup of persecution why why did they drink that cup of persecution because they was baptized with the same baptism if it was true for them then it's true for us if the first part of that scripture is true then the rest of that passage is also true oh yeah that's right that's right for not only did he say just think if he had just said you shall indeed drink of this cup if he had just left it at that but there was a conjunction there was something else went with the passage he said you shall indeed drink of this cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with and if the first part of that was right about drinking the cup of bitter persecution then the rest of the passage of scripture is right that we as a people of god can receive the very life he had not another holy ghost come on somebody the same holy ghost for that calvary that day when he died he committed his spirit to god what happened on the day of pentecost god sent that life back down to the church think of it friends think of it a people so persecuted and hated a people who have sorrow and grief and sickness and death and the other people so anointed with the anointing of the messiah that they would be messianics did you catch the pictures that started by ten thousand devils a man who weapon at the screen's grave did raise him from the dead a man that raised a boy from the dead and then sat on a rock and groaned with a headache for what was he you see he was he was not just a man nor was he just a god but he was a unique blend he was a god it's going man get quite from now over there's all right but think of it look at the picture a man a god man walking the earth and yet he suffered bitter persecution to the point they killed him and yet god dwelled in him and then he says ye shall indeed drink this cup and be baptized just like i was baptized how many of the prophet god said he received the holy ghost on the river that day when you received the baptism of the holy ghost the prophet of god said you've got the same anointing the same life living in the flesh of his people a people so persecuted a people of sorrow a people of grief people who have sickness of people who bury loved ones and yet are people so anointed with the anointing of the messiah that they would be called messiahs the anointed ones of god thank you hallelujah [Applause] come into our position what are we coming to we are coming to what god thought of us but for the foundation of the world [Music] when god sees you he sees you the way he saw you before the foundation of the world hallelujah like ruth who laid down pulled the same cover over her not another cover the same cover like elisha when elijah was taken up got a double portion of elijah's spirit same mantle same anointing just more of it same skirt same robe same cup same baptism can you be baptized with the same baptizer i'm baptized with what is that baptism it is the holy ghost same life he lived by but god is looking for men who are on fire who's been to the burning bush whose souls is burning with the fire of god same skirt same robe same cup same baptism same holy ghost same life he lived did not he say when he resurrected from the dead because i live ye shall live can you yes we can yes we can and he said ye shall indeed these things that i do to the church greater than you now the prophet said it couldn't be greater in quality it had to be greater in quantity because he stopped nature raised the dead heal the sick everything could be done he did it see give that life back to the dead and everything so nothing could be done any greater in quality but it was quality these things that i do shall you do more and more shall you do because i go to my father what he did when he was here it was one man jesus and the holy ghost working through him doing signs and wonders now the holy ghost is walking through a many member bodies all around the world making sense making state john 14 12 a reality the works i do shall you do also and greater than this how you do for you'll do it in the michigan you'll do it in guyana you'll do it in costa rica you'll do it in australia come on somebody it's the bride of christ oh glory to god i'm from the south we get excited i'm sorry hallelujah because i go to my father and i send back this baptism to you the same baptism that i have you'll have to the same spirit that was in christ is in you hallelujah jesus said the same cup that i drink you'll drink the same baptism i'm baptized with you shall be baptized with and the same things that i do shall you do also what did he do he spoke in tongues he cast out devils he preached the gospel he healed the sick notice he never one time pushed me well gloria you don't believe in listening to tapes oh yeah i believe in listening to tapes but i also believe in a five-fold ministry amen how they knew your brother bannon never came to take the place of you know why i'm not a pastor i've had plenty of offers i say it humbly but i say it truthfully i've had plenty of offers for churches probably in my career of a minister if i could say it that way i'm ignorant i don't know fancy words i say the wrong word forgive me but what i'm trying to say is this in all my years of preaching i've had many offers you know why i've never took a church there's a brother told me one time that god told him i was to be the pastor of a church i sought god for three years because i wanted to be right and one day out in kentucky in a tree stand deer hunting when i was actually praying and i said god if you want me to take that church that brother said that you told him i was to take that church i said god if you're able to tell that man and i'm the one that's supposed to do it you're certainly able to tell me and i said lord if you want me to take that church if you'll speak to me i'll do what you tell me to do god is my witness sitting there in that tree stand a warm feeling come over me and avoid what otherwise i've never heard the honorable voice of god but a voice spoke just as real as i'm speaking to you told me he said stay on the field as an evangelist and by this you'll know that you're this is what you're to do he gave me two brothers names and said you'll preach for both of these brothers and by this you'll know that you're to stay on the field i come out of the woods a man by the name of billy laster he's go to glory now billy killed a big cow down here in kentucky and invited all these believers in for a big steak dinner man it was good too and i came out of the woods took a shower and went over to that steak dinner and god is my witness both of those brothers were there and both of those brothers that night asked me to come and preach for them i'll go back up i go back up to where where the brother said that and i took a message the sons of god are led by the spirit of god and i told him i cannot take the church because he told me to stay on the field as an evangelist i can't take the place of a pastor i'm not a pastor but brother brennan cannot take my place there's a five-fold ministry he never ordained the pushing to play to take the place of the fivefold ministry i don't care friends you get mad at me just pray for me but i'm trying to tell you the god's truth amen amen what did he say he said the works i do shall he do also what did he do he spoke in tongues he cast out devils he preached the gospel healed the sick the same thing he did we can too sorry i'll take that over what anybody else says and at the end of our days as he's raised from the dead so will we who are in him for he said i am the resurrection and the life you see what the messiah is messiah is the kingdom of god anointed ones them anointed with the same spirit he was anointed with one said to him one day what my son said at the right hand in the left and he said can you drink the cup that i drink can you be baptized with the baptism i baptized with and she said yay and he said you will but the kingdom to the sin at the right until the left hand is not mine to give so it showed that we could drink of the same cup of persecution be called bl's about whatever it might be and still be baptized with the same spirit he was baptized with what are you saying i'm saying simply this we can absolutely be filled with the holy ghost and still get sick and still get down but greater see that is in me than he that's in the world amen hallelujah he was called messiah which he was because he was anointed with the holy spirit and any church any church send the light any church that's anointed with the same holy ghost he is anointed with is a messiah yes let me read that again in case she was daydreaming he was called messiah which he was because he was anointed with the holy spirit and any church somebody say any church any church that's anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah a littler smaller god amen told you it's gonna get quieter well brother i don't know about that well then tear down your quote book i just read you a quote that's not my words that's his words and he told me to say what he said so that's what i'm saying someday when this body is resurrected i hope beforehand that god can get a hold of a bunch of people right here in fit michigan that god can get ahold of a bunch of people that'll manifest his power in every dimension that it's supposed to be in messiah anointed one a king to deliver a king hallelujah your kings and priests kings to bring in priests kings to bring in priests to ministers to a messiah his signs to follow in all ages reflecting his light his presence with his kingdom people amen can you drink this cup yes we can can you be baptized yes we can can you receive the holy ghost yes i can can you be delivered yes i can can you get healing yes i can can i take a rap sir yes i can cause i know the can man i said i know the can man i know the cannon and the canned man said it all i can oh glory to god that might make the top 20 but that was fresh right there do you know the canned man the canned man said we can even can you drink yes we can can you be baptized yes we can amen there's a bride on the earth who can declare yes we can cast out devils lay their hands on the sick raise the dead walk on water take a body change and at the same time be criticized rejected and hated at the very and friends i ask you with the signs and wonders has taken place you know i could just stop right now spend the rest of night testify of things i've seen the lord do that's god's truth i've seen the things i've seen the lord do that's the byc camp here several years ago when he was up in ohio james titled me some you know brother james tibble he was already he had a cancer in his ear been there for three years scab over over and bled come over he put all kinds of essential oils all kinds of appointments he said brother i was embarrassed because it looked like my hair was always dirty and when people come up and talk to me they was always looking at my ears and i was so self-conscious but that night we just had a mass prayer for everybody had all the young people come up that had all the believers and all the ministers to come up and stand behind them you know brother james is a preacher he got a church there in tennessee and so brother james came up there put his hands with the young brothers had the sisters on one side brothers on the other and just had a mass prayer for everybody in the building and brother james laid his hand on those young people and we all pray brother james goes to the room lays down go sleep he gets up the next morning looks in the mirror it's gone no scar no scale it disappeared why i know the can man i had a basal cell carcinoma come up in my ear right there they cut a hole in my ear so big you can read the constitution through it i said god's truth it left a scar that now might you i'll show it to you after church it's terrible scar you see man done that man i thank god he was able to do it he cut the cancer out of here but he left a terrible scar but when my god took the cancer off of brother james's ear he didn't even leave a scar oh hallelujah [Applause] how's that in the backfield working brother of north carolina called me said brother are you busy i said no sir i said what's going on he said brother my grandson my boy down to georgia said his son he's three-year-old i think he was something like that he said he's got a terrible skin disease he said the doctor said it's incurable he said brother it's awful from the top of his head to the souls and feet he's just one big rash and the doctor said he'll always be the way he said brother it just kills me to look at him i can't he said will you agree with me that god will do something for him i said sure brother let's agree together and over the phone in the backfield we prayed he prayed three days later i was still working in the backfield my phone rings i said hello it was the brother oh brother daryl he said my boy just called from georgia said that grandson said his skin it's gone brother now his skin looks like a baby skin these five shall follow them that believe why they are baptized with the same baptism that's the kind of church god wants right here in fifth michigan oh god oh he's so good to us cast out devils lay their hands on the sick raise the dead take a body change at the same time be criticized and reject it and hate it but it never stopped him and it will never stop us they tried their best to kill john but they never could kill him and they will never stop this bride she has drank of the cup and has been baptized with the baptism he was baptized with now friends this can't be talking about the baptism he received of john if that was true we would all have to go to jordan and be baptized in the river that's right so he's not talking about that baptism when john baptized he's talking about another baptism but what did john say i baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i'm not worthy to bear and he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire you that's right i'm sorry that's the god's truth that's the truth i had some frail britches i was out burning the brush file and i was kicking up the brush in there to burn it and i was sitting there and all of a sudden i thought man my legs awful hot the other day i said jimmy cricket i'm on fire my passion was burning right up to i was two seconds away from ripping my britches right off in the neighborhood wow you said brother why i was on fire can you imagine the man who furnishing well look i'm burning golly no when you're on fire the neighbors knows it the fire department knows it everybody knows it and let me tell you this church amen let's get on fire from god let fit michigan know there's a god who answers the prayers of his people amen the clearest example i know of the meaning of the baptism is a text from the greek point by the physician nasander who lived in 200 bc it's a recipe for making pickles it's helpful because it uses both words now watch this neander says that in order to make a pickle the vegetable should be first dipped bapto into boiling water and then baptized baptizo in the vinegar solution both verbs concerning the immersion of vegetables in a solution but the first is temporarily the second is the act of baptism the baptizing the vegetable produces a permanent change and john said you're not just going to be dipped in water you are going to be pickled it's going to take a prostitute and make her a godly woman or the baptism of the holy ghost that he said i don't care what you've done you can't be baptized if you'll follow the formula hallelujah what is this baptism it is a new birth it is a regeneration it is a new creature he is standing in the midst of the church and he stands out revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god can i have just a few more minutes this to me is the church he wants this is what he wants us to be not just come to a message church not just those pictures are wonderful thank god i'm glad we understand what those pictures are but we have all this and not have healed we're nothing but a lodge are you here we're nothing but a lodge because they meet together they have pictures on the wall and everything else so we've got to be something besides a lodge god's not looking for a lodge but he is looking for a bride he's the author he's the author of creation of god this is another creation this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special listen to this this is a special designation of himself so what does the church want what does he want his church to be he wants his church to be him yeah that's right bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit the prophet said she is him hallelujah the author amen the author of creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born mary was just the incubator god created the cells in that womb that produced that body i want to repeat that he said he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body god not mary provided that body for he said in his word a body has thou prepared me mary was the human incubator and she carried the holy child and brought him to birth and he was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of a new race and he is the hand of this new race what did the spirit of god produce in the womb of mary it produced a god man that's right well let me just in case you don't the prophet god said when he slept in that boat that night because he was tired he was a man but when he put his book on the bow that boat and said peace be still that was more than the man that was god said when he wept at lazar's grave he was a man but when he threw those shoulders back and said lazarus come forth that was lower than a man that was god so what did he produce in the womb of mary a new creation a new race and god wants kind to bring forth time that's according to the book of genesis then if christ is to take a bride what kind of bride will he take somebody that's just like you how can they be like him they are baptized into a new creation what did the spirit of god produce in the womb of mary a god man what will the spirit of god produce in the womb of the church a god man he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things have become new therefore you can see that no man was of the old order or the creation now listen to this i'm coming to a close now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god man though he was born of the old order or the old creation now in a union with christ he has become the new creation of god for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus under good works ephesians 2 10 ephesians 4 24 and now that you put on the new man which actor god is created in righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not a no creation made over or not because it couldn't be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is it's not a no creation made whole it's a new creation the old man dies amen this is another creation distinct from the old one but now out of every kinder tribe nation he has produced a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of a man and now by his spirit he has created many sons of god unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation hallelujah god the great creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose everything christ has we have everything christ is we are to manifest you want to see a miracle you are one they say we shall see miracles in 2021. it's the year of miracles i say why not us why not now it's time we rise to the state it's time we rise to the level that god has called us to be not just church members but sons and daughters of god made in his image the visions that the prophet saw that's wrong in the books friends we're not reading them we're living them god had a dream god had a vision concerning the last day and you are the dream that god dreamed you are the vision that god saw you are his word manifested on the earth in the hour that you're living in that is the church of the living god we're living out the vision a bride on the earth whom god is manifesting himself in god manifesting himself in his church among his people can you drink of this cup and be baptized with this baptism not a cup the same cup not another baptism the same baptism not another robe the same robe not another garment the same garment not another anointing the same anointing not another god the same god glory let the winds blow let the storms come resurrection lays within us we're drinking from the same cup he has made us to drink through and through his death and through his burial and through his resurrection because he lives we shall live also and we shall sit with listen to me as i close god don't want you just to send the light he wants you to be the life he wants you to be for what did our lord say i am the light of the world and then he turned around and said ye are the light of the world yes amen so who's the light of the world jesus or you oh here's the mystery of it both correct that's right both correct it's christ in you the hope of all glory be the name of the lord it is the doing of our father and it is marvelous in our eyes can i say to you not my brother my sister have you drank that cup have you been baptized with that baptism before we ever go into the rapture we must come this way when i see the blood i will pass over you he's only looking for one thing the token but i see that token life i will pass over here what kind of church does he want he wants himself in action do you love him do you know the prophet god said the moon is the wife of the son and you know the prophet of god said the moon has no light of its own it only lives off the light of the sun it doesn't have its own light it's only reflecting the sun's light do you know a rainbow you've seen a rainbow in the sky a rainbow in the sky is caused by water droplets in the air and the light of the sun passing through the droplets splits the light into seven colors and makes a seven colored rainbow and we know that rainbow is a covenant that god made is that right the rainbow is the top of the covenant do you know that in this end time in the life magazine article of the cloud anybody anybody ever seen the life magazine cloud on one page it says a mile high mystery cloud and it's the picture of the cloud and it says and dot dot dot and and you turn the page over how many knows what's on the other page it's a rainbow how many knows where that rainbow was at it was in hawaii honeymoon capital of the world how he knows what time the rainbow appeared it appeared at 11 o'clock at night to call in the 11th hour worker what was it showing us that we have a covenant with god we are god's covenant people knows there's a thing called a moonbow you know what a moonbow is a mumbo is the same thing as a rainbow except the rainbow is caused by the sun but a moonbow is caused by the light of the moon and it takes certain kind of conditions to produce the moonbow it takes so much darkness so much moisture and so much light so the only age that could ever been a moonbow is the last stage in the darkness of laodicea the light returns with the water of the word and produces a moonbow showing that god has made a covenant with his people what kind of church does he want for his he wants a church like him do you love him do you believe him every praise is to our god every word of worship in one

part of the story of the partner when he goes to the field and he collects the clay have you ever noticed from the time he picks that clay up until the time it's formed into a thing of beauty have you ever noticed go back and look at it it never leaves his hands his hands are always he will not take his hands that's the only church that jesus claims as his own mark 16 in action all else is false oh saints of god recognize who you are amen as i said last night the guy's name was merle he was raised in new jersey in the jewish family went through all the jewish customs wore the hat the string did all the things that the jews do but one day somebody come knocking at his door and he opened the door and it was a man with the book and the book was open and in the book was the man's true identity he showed him his name he showed him his birth and he told him you are not a jew you are a sioux indian from off the pine ridge indian reservation and when he found out who he really was he went back to his native roots he went back to talking the old way and walking the red path and he become an award-winning flute player native american flute player you see that was in him the whole time he thought he was a jew that laid within him but one day the open book revealed his true identity and the things that i have told you tonight did not come from an ellie queen mystery magazine the things we have talked about tonight has come from the open book that god has revealed to us who we are brother said i didn't come to mix up a doctrine i come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and the scare that you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be you are now sons and daughters of god you always were yes you always do you love him tonight his church in action he wants a church in action he wants a church on fire what kind of fire brother now the fire of the holy ghost amen do you love him this power is amen oh lord father i thank you lord jesus that we can look as that little boy who never saw a mirror lord his mother took him down to a home where there was a mirror and he was the only little person there and he's looking around and all of a sudden at the end of the hallway he saw another little boy father never seen a mirror he didn't realize what he was looking at he thought he'd found someone to play with he rushed towards the mirror his mother and grandmother was watching him he got closer and closer and closer and he waved and the boy waved back and he smiled and the boy smiled back and finally he touched the mirror and the boy touched the mirror and the revelation spoke his heart it struck his heart he turned around and said why mama it's me amen and oh god i'm so grateful tonight that we can look into the mirror of your word for a word mirror reveals to us our word image that god we can look into the mirror of your word and see this church this people that you're talking about this new creation it's not something that's coming it's here now an anointed messiah living on the earth oh god and the prophet of god said when we reproduce you on the earth again then you'll catch us away oh god as we go through this hall of critics may we not get weary and well do it knowing dear god that this bride will pass every test who shall go flying away one day lord it does my heart good when i realize the prophet of god said it's the
