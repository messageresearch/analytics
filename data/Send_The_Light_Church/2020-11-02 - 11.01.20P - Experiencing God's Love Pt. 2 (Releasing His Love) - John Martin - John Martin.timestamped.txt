[3:37] once again it's good to be in god's
[3:39] house
[3:40] it's getting harder and harder i believe
[3:43] for our flesh
[3:45] as we see the the day approaching it's
[3:49] we we can't uh
[3:52] we we can't just move on the excitement
[3:55] of the flesh
[3:57] because the the flesh is weak and
[4:00] it's running out of excitement
[4:04] but praise the lord for the spirit of
[4:07] god that lives within us
[4:09] that we can't truly be excited about the
[4:12] word and
[4:13] and believing in the realness of god
[4:15] revealing himself to us and making
[4:18] himself known to us amen i want to say
[4:20] it's
[4:22] a joy to have sister genie with us again
[4:25] it's been
[4:26] a while been a long time
[4:30] what was the last sermon that we
[4:31] preached because we just don't want to
[4:32] do that one again
[4:38] okay it's been a while
[4:42] well it's certainly good to have you
[4:44] with us tonight we love you
[4:46] in christ amen turn with me if you would
[4:49] to the book of matthew
[4:51] chapter 28 for our
[4:54] opening scripture before we have you be
[4:56] seated
[5:01] matthew chapter 28 very familiar
[5:04] scripture the great
[5:05] uh commission known as
[5:09] starting with verse number 18 and jesus
[5:11] came and spake unto his disciples
[5:15] saying all power is given unto me in
[5:17] heaven and earth
[5:19] go ye therefore and teaching teach all
[5:21] nations baptizing them in the name of
[5:23] the father
[5:24] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[5:28] teaching them to observe all things
[5:30] whatsoever i have commanded you and lo
[5:33] i'm with you always even unto the end of
[5:36] the world amen god bless
[5:38] you may be seated god's going to be with
[5:40] us to the end
[5:42] does it matter does it matter what we
[5:44] feel that's right hallelujah
[5:46] he's still with us
[5:50] and so i came up with this idea i don't
[5:53] you know just tell me what you think
[5:55] about it
[5:56] uh that every two minutes everybody says
[5:58] amen
[6:02] now that's not you for you brother
[6:04] marcus that would be a slow slowdown
[6:07] so for you it's every minute
[6:16] this morning we spoke on receiving god's
[6:20] love
[6:24] and the greatest
[6:28] experience a sinner can have
[6:31] is when he receives the forgiveness of
[6:34] his sins
[6:37] i just there's not a greater experience
[6:40] a greater power
[6:42] in fact that's the only time
[6:45] [Applause]
[6:46] that is that i know that's recorded in
[6:49] heaven
[6:49] that the angels are rejoicing over that
[6:52] experience it's such a great experience
[6:54] for myself i've never experienced
[6:57] anything greater
[6:59] than when god forgave me and he cleaned
[7:01] me
[7:03] and this evening i want to speak on part
[7:05] two of experiencing god's love
[7:08] on the subject releasing god's love
[7:12] so this morning we we spoke on receiving
[7:15] it and
[7:16] and this this evening we want to speak
[7:18] on releasing
[7:20] god's love amen jesus said all power
[7:23] is given unto me amen
[7:28] and he he told his disciples to wait
[7:31] in jerusalem to tarry there
[7:34] until they receive the holy ghost
[7:39] is that true and he's he he shared
[7:42] with them that they're they're going to
[7:44] receive the same power that he had
[7:48] in acts chapter 1 verse 8 but ye shall
[7:52] ye shall receive power after the holy
[7:54] ghost has come upon you and you shall be
[7:56] witnesses
[7:57] unto me basically everywhere you go
[8:01] everywhere you go you're going to be a
[8:04] witness so
[8:05] all power was given unto jesus
[8:08] and he promised to give his disciples
[8:12] that same power after the holy ghost has
[8:16] come upon them
[8:17] allowing them to be a proper witness
[8:19] amen
[8:22] and he says go ye therefore and teach
[8:24] all nations
[8:25] baptizing them in the name of the father
[8:28] and the son and the holy ghost
[8:29] right amen i got it we got a good
[8:33] testimony
[8:34] sister hope is going to be baptized next
[8:37] sunday
[8:39] in the name of the father and then and
[8:41] the son
[8:42] and the holy ghost
[8:46] it's going to be in in the name of jesus
[8:48] christ because that that is
[8:50] the father and the son and the holy
[8:57] [Applause]
[9:04] teaching them to observe all things
[9:07] whatsoever
[9:08] i have commanded you in law and with you
[9:11] always even unto the end of the world
[9:12] now
[9:13] god commands us to do a lot
[9:16] so the great commission is that we need
[9:20] to teach others the same thing
[9:23] and we can't always get him to come to
[9:25] church so we need to
[9:27] you know tell them right where they're
[9:29] at amen
[9:30] because it's still his command
[9:34] so when he comes to me and he says my
[9:36] son john why did not you
[9:38] tell so-and-so i can't say well
[9:42] because they didn't come to church
[9:46] because this commission is going to yell
[9:50] so we we can only do this by going out
[9:54] find a way to reach them and share with
[9:56] them what god's been sharing with you
[9:58] that is the command
[10:02] it's releasing god's love
[10:06] this is god's love the motive here is
[10:09] love it it's not
[10:11] religion it's it's it's not i have to
[10:15] it's a it's a desire it's it's a it's a
[10:18] love desire
[10:22] acts chapter 20 verse 35 i
[10:25] have showed you all things paul's
[10:27] speaking
[10:28] how that soul laboring
[10:31] ye ought to support the weak and to
[10:34] remember
[10:35] the words of our lord jesus how he
[10:38] said it is more blessed to give
[10:41] than to receive so
[10:45] i mean it was a great experience that we
[10:47] had when god
[10:49] forgave us when he loved us when we had
[10:51] that experience
[10:54] but it is a greater experience to have
[10:58] that same flow out of you to somebody
[11:01] else because now god's using your body
[11:05] to do what he did to you
[11:06] [Music]
[11:08] it's more blessed to give christ than to
[11:11] receive christ amen
[11:14] we can get real selfish and real stingy
[11:16] and
[11:17] real greedy and all about us that's
[11:19] right
[11:20] basically get all wrapped up in our self
[11:23] and forget that there is something
[11:24] greater than that
[11:26] when jesus christ can use your body can
[11:28] use your mind your
[11:29] your lips and your heart and your time
[11:32] and your money
[11:33] to go out somebody yes amen
[11:38] you will be blessed i'll say it like
[11:41] this you'll be more blessed
[11:43] god has a way of blessing you when
[11:47] you let him use your body
[11:54] you you know how it is when somebody
[11:58] uh
[12:02] helps you i think
[12:06] brother mark was telling me this morning
[12:08] how much he appreciated
[12:10] brother jacob coming over and helping
[12:12] him with his car and just spent
[12:13] hours with him to the late hours of the
[12:16] night helping him with his car and he
[12:18] just
[12:19] he felt so overjoyed and so indebted
[12:23] and just said you know whatever you
[12:25] whatever you need i'm just i'm just
[12:27] what you just tell me i'll be there
[12:29] that's what he said what he said it was
[12:30] a
[12:31] and there's a real realness and a
[12:33] feeling that he felt
[12:34] from what brother jacob had done for him
[12:39] and if your car is broke down you don't
[12:43] have anything
[12:44] somebody lets you use their car you feel
[12:48] indebted to them and god
[12:52] at this point can't reach anybody
[12:55] he chose the preaching of men he chose
[12:58] men
[12:58] to spread the gospel and when we let god
[13:01] use our bodies
[13:04] all he just rewards us with joy
[13:09] he lets us know
[13:13] he lets us know that we did the right
[13:16] thing
[13:17] amen that you and him became a worker
[13:21] together
[13:22] to win a soul another part of the family
[13:25] came together
[13:27] that they wouldn't have made it without
[13:29] you how many times did we hear
[13:31] brother barnum express when he went
[13:34] beyond the curtain of time
[13:36] we wouldn't have made it unless you came
[13:43] so was it brother branham come on think
[13:46] about it
[13:47] brother brother branham was was raised
[13:50] by a drunk parent
[13:55] so you know was it brother branham he
[13:57] wanted to to just
[13:59] to to to uh to to do the things of the
[14:02] world
[14:03] and the spirit stopped him
[14:09] he gave himself to god
[14:12] he lent his body to god just like
[14:15] the most subtle beast lent his body to
[14:18] the devil
[14:21] brother lent his body to god and god
[14:24] used him to win
[14:25] millions to get this message to you we
[14:27] wouldn't be here if it wouldn't have
[14:29] been for a brother we'll say the same
[14:30] thing that he said
[14:32] we'll say the same thing but we'll
[14:34] probably be sending to more people
[14:36] because down the chain right went
[14:39] through a lot of people to get to us
[14:44] but that indebtedness they gave
[14:50] it is the greatest thing that we can
[14:53] ever experience is when we
[14:55] release the love of god amen manifest
[14:58] the love of god
[15:04] no doubt we were blessed when god poured
[15:06] out his love
[15:07] amen his great love wherewith he loved
[15:11] us and gave himself for us when we were
[15:12] done our sins and our trespasses and
[15:15] he took his grace and he he saved our
[15:18] lives and it wasn't by our works or good
[15:21] looks or
[15:22] anything like that he gets all the
[15:26] credit
[15:27] we stand here by the grace of god
[15:30] indebted to god amen
[15:33] but it's more blessed to give out the
[15:35] love
[15:36] of god to others than just
[15:40] to be on the receiving end brother brown
[15:43] talk to us about
[15:45] a a system system am i saying that
[15:48] saying that correctly
[15:51] okay see you all know what i mean when
[15:52] they say it wrong i didn't have to ask
[15:54] you if it's right
[15:55] you already know
[15:59] he said it has no outlet
[16:03] it just it's just receiving all the time
[16:06] he says it becomes a dead cesspool now
[16:09] think about that
[16:12] how do you think god feels when he's
[16:14] just given love
[16:15] giving giving giving to you and you hold
[16:18] it all in
[16:23] we need to let the love of god out we
[16:25] need to release it
[16:28] you know it just multiplies when you
[16:30] give it out
[16:32] and it kind of shrivels up to nothing
[16:34] when you keep it inside amen
[16:39] you get joy by sharing jesus
[16:47] what is your love calling you to do
[16:53] your love will pull you to do your will
[16:57] the love of christ will pull you to do
[16:59] his will
[17:01] the love of god ought to be holding us
[17:04] in the same theme together turn with me
[17:08] if you would to second corinthians
[17:09] chapter 5 verse 14
[17:13] and we we hope pray
[17:16] trust doing our very best not to be
[17:19] lengthy tonight because we had the
[17:22] service today
[17:23] and it'd be nice to not be long wasn't
[17:26] it can you say amen today what else
[17:27] should i say amen to that one
[17:30] that's another way to encourage your
[17:32] pastor to hurry up
[17:36] hey as long as long as we get the
[17:37] message across right
[17:43] chapter 14 of second corinthians chapter
[17:46] 5
[17:47] for the love of christ constraineth us
[17:53] this commandment to go ye
[17:56] out it shouldn't be grievous
[18:00] no sir even though it is our
[18:03] responsibility
[18:04] and brother brother brandon said we need
[18:06] to accept our responsibility
[18:08] it shouldn't be grievous to us when
[18:11] brother branham got
[18:12] back from the curtain of time he said
[18:14] i'm
[18:15] uh uh i feel more responsible than i
[18:18] ever have in my life to get the message
[18:20] out of that's what he said now what made
[18:22] him say that
[18:25] he was in the presence of perfect love
[18:30] it was perfect love that made him say
[18:32] that
[18:33] he wanted to release what he received
[18:39] that's why i say what are you releasing
[18:45] your love will release your desires
[18:49] and feed that's why we don't want to
[18:51] feed on the things of the world because
[18:52] we're just going to get nowhere
[18:57] somewhere down the line
[19:02] we've got to release god's love and we
[19:04] all should better stand up and testify
[19:06] this is what i'm doing on a daily basis
[19:09] on a weekly basis
[19:11] to release god's love
[19:16] amen for the love of christ
[19:19] constraineth us constrains
[19:22] us unites us together
[19:26] in one purpose because we
[19:30] thus judge that if one died for all
[19:33] then we're all dead we no longer exist i
[19:37] don't have a
[19:39] name and building my own life and doing
[19:41] my own thing i'm dead why am i dead
[19:43] because he died for me i'm no longer my
[19:46] own
[19:47] i've been bought with a price he does
[19:49] with me what he wants
[19:51] imagine of all the things that you
[19:53] bought
[19:55] just decided to say you know what i
[19:58] don't like your driveway i'm going back
[20:00] to the auto dealer i like being with the
[20:03] other new cars how about the groceries
[20:07] you bought
[20:08] you go to the fridge and they just all
[20:10] sudden they're not there and there you
[20:12] see them going down the sidewalk
[20:17] how do you think god feels when we've
[20:20] surrendered our life we gave jesus our
[20:22] life and you said you
[20:23] you know what i just i got things i got
[20:25] to do
[20:28] i'll fit you in on a sunday and
[20:29] wednesday but don't you ask me to do two
[20:32] on a sunday
[20:34] you understand the thoughts that are
[20:36] that we battle inside
[20:42] we can say amen to the scripture but do
[20:44] you really
[20:45] have that feeling inside where you feel
[20:48] that we're all
[20:49] dead and we belong to christ
[20:52] and you feel christ changing your life
[20:55] like
[20:56] like do you feel tomorrow
[20:59] this week tuesday i'm changing things up
[21:01] i'm
[21:02] i'm letting the word do something in my
[21:04] life
[21:06] it would just absolutely be to me
[21:07] wasteless
[21:09] to come to church hear the word
[21:13] and not be changed
[21:16] fruitless no good
[21:19] we're just fooling ourselves
[21:21] [Music]
[21:23] we need to change just a little
[21:25] something
[21:26] need you need to put in action in the
[21:29] direction
[21:30] that god wants you to go he wants
[21:33] how can people hear christ
[21:37] if we if we don't bring christ to them
[21:43] we can we can give them a bible we can
[21:45] give them a plaque
[21:48] we can say we're praying for them but
[21:50] you know
[21:52] somehow they've got to see it they got
[21:54] to see sacrifice
[21:56] and laying down your life and doing the
[21:58] same thing christ did for you
[22:00] that's what it means to release the love
[22:02] of god
[22:05] verse 15 and that he died for all
[22:09] that they which live should not
[22:11] henceforth
[22:12] live unto themselves
[22:17] but unto him that died and rose again i
[22:21] love
[22:21] that amen like i said every minute we
[22:24] need to amen if we get more amens we get
[22:26] into it more we get more out of it right
[22:28] what you get what you put in is what you
[22:31] get out
[22:33] did you know you could sit here never
[22:36] say amen
[22:37] and and like watching the discovery
[22:39] channel
[22:42] you know reading some
[22:45] seminary booklet
[22:49] we want to have this word come alive
[22:52] to us and be real and what can't sit
[22:55] still because
[22:56] the word is so real to us
[23:00] you know i can't do that for you
[23:03] no preacher can't he a preacher can get
[23:05] up here and make you feel good
[23:08] it won't take long until you're not
[23:10] feeling good anymore
[23:11] but if you get serious with god you
[23:13] don't need a preacher to make you feel
[23:15] good
[23:16] you need a relationship with jesus
[23:18] christ it'll make you feel good
[23:22] verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we
[23:24] know man after the flesh yet though we
[23:26] have known he
[23:26] known christ after the flesh yet now
[23:29] henceforth knowing no more
[23:31] therefore if any of us
[23:34] are in jesus christ
[23:39] we're different
[23:42] we're different than before we knew him
[23:45] amen we're a new creature
[23:48] our own life has gone by amen
[23:53] and our whole life was about us
[23:56] all you had to do is look back in your
[23:58] life look at what you did or what your
[24:01] parents did or what
[24:02] somebody that was in the world what they
[24:04] did
[24:07] what what it meant to the old life
[24:11] they lived for themselves
[24:15] there was no releasing of god's love
[24:20] and you can't release what you don't
[24:22] have
[24:24] so you have to get it to release it
[24:28] and when you have it god don't let it
[24:30] stay there
[24:34] now i understand there could be some
[24:36] trouble with will
[24:38] because he's got to work through
[24:39] self-will
[24:42] but i know when it's bubbling it's
[24:44] bubbling
[24:46] it just wants to come out and when it's
[24:49] not then i know i need
[24:51] a trip to the altar
[24:54] eat a trip to the altar get filled back
[24:56] up
[24:58] he's a new creature all things are
[24:59] passed away behold all things
[25:02] are become new and you just want to
[25:04] share
[25:05] jesus with somebody
[25:08] and you ever share jesus with somebody
[25:10] get turned down you still feel good
[25:19] it's awesome because you're in the will
[25:22] of god
[25:24] paul wasn't responsible for everybody
[25:28] he knew he's only going to get something
[25:32] but i believe he was just as happy
[25:34] sharing jesus with
[25:35] everyone and i believe it was
[25:39] it was god in him amen and all
[25:42] things are of god who have reconciled us
[25:45] to himself by jesus christ and have
[25:47] given to us
[25:49] a responsibility
[25:55] let's talk about your ministry amen
[25:58] a ministry of reconciliation is about
[26:01] restoring
[26:02] others to it that god was in christ
[26:05] reconciling the world to himself not
[26:07] imputing their trespasses on them
[26:09] and have committed them to us the word
[26:11] of reconciliation
[26:12] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[26:16] as though god did beseech you by us we
[26:18] pray you in christ and be reconciled
[26:20] to god so that's basically your whole
[26:23] motive when you're talking to a sinner
[26:25] or to someone that needs to be restored
[26:27] to the truth they may be in a partial
[26:29] truth and you're trying to bring them
[26:31] into more truth your goal is to
[26:33] reconcile them to god because they're
[26:35] not in the place that god wants them to
[26:37] be
[26:38] even though they may feel they're just
[26:39] fine
[26:42] they don't know that they don't have
[26:44] that responsibility now you carry that
[26:47] you carry that burden just like jesus
[26:49] carried that
[26:50] your burden to the to calvary
[26:54] for the joy that was set before him he
[26:56] could do it and when you have that
[26:58] vision
[26:59] that i i see this person saved right in
[27:02] the will of god
[27:05] that vision it gives you joy
[27:09] gives you strength when they say get out
[27:11] of here
[27:13] you know no i love you get out of it i
[27:16] still love you
[27:19] i'm here for one purpose to reconcile
[27:22] you
[27:22] to get you to god oh i am god thank you
[27:29] i know you have gotta i just want to
[27:31] share more of god
[27:34] there's more of god there's there's more
[27:36] of god and not belittling what god you
[27:39] have
[27:39] i just want to share more of god
[27:43] and it takes a time to do this
[27:47] and i say if god's love is inside of you
[27:50] it you'll just be releasing that
[27:58] part two is harder than part one
[28:06] it comes with a responsibility does it
[28:08] not brother button says
[28:10] if your your candle is lit you're
[28:13] obligated
[28:14] to go light somebody else's and and
[28:18] god is not obligated to give you the
[28:20] gospel twice if somebody else hasn't
[28:22] heard it once
[28:24] i mean think about how important it is
[28:26] to release this love to everybody
[28:30] i don't believe that jesus was just
[28:33] talking to the 12 disciples
[28:35] think about this why would it be
[28:38] recorded
[28:41] so if you were one of the 12 disciples
[28:43] and you were standing there
[28:45] would you say oh no this is just for
[28:47] matthew mark luke and john and
[28:51] to think that even though you weren't
[28:54] there
[28:54] you're placing yourself there
[28:58] how that makes god feel here's someone
[29:00] that believes my word
[29:02] without a feeling without an emotion
[29:07] here's someone with a vision without a
[29:09] vision the people perish
[29:12] the only way we'll release the love of
[29:13] god
[29:17] turn with me to first john chapter 3.
[29:25] all right some of you honestly
[29:29] have been missing your two minutes
[29:37] i would say you know would help you just
[29:39] stay awake but that would be real carnal
[29:45] first john chapter 3 verse 13
[29:48] marvel not my brethren if the world
[29:52] hate you
[30:01] you're the best thing sent sliced bread
[30:03] and you're wondering why people hate you
[30:07] you're trying to help them
[30:10] and you wonder why people hate you when
[30:12] you're just trying to help them you ever
[30:13] do that i just tried helping them and
[30:15] they
[30:18] marvel not my brethren if the world
[30:21] hates you
[30:22] we know that we have passed from death
[30:26] unto life
[30:28] for one thing because we love the
[30:34] brethren
[30:37] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[30:39] in death
[30:42] so the world is exercising
[30:47] a lesser love it's a love for self
[30:54] and we know that we're separated from
[30:57] the world for one purpose
[31:00] because we don't hate anybody
[31:09] it's easy to say why i love 90 of the
[31:12] people
[31:14] but that's did you know
[31:18] i was the
[31:21] the brother of jesus christ when i was
[31:25] in sin
[31:26] i was still his brother
[31:30] i just wasn't reconciled yet i wasn't
[31:33] cleansed i wasn't washed i
[31:35] i didn't know him i didn't even know him
[31:37] as i was like a foster
[31:38] child didn't know who my parent was then
[31:41] they
[31:42] he came into the
[31:45] and adoption part of the family
[31:50] so there's people out there that don't
[31:51] agree with us that are against us
[31:55] that that say terrible negative things
[31:58] about the word about god
[32:00] that could be our brother
[32:06] you never want to hate anybody for any
[32:08] reason as soon as you do you're
[32:10] separating yourself
[32:15] that's what the world does we know
[32:19] that we got eternal life
[32:23] because we love one another
[32:28] he that loveth not his brother
[32:33] abideth in death
[32:37] something has taken place
[32:40] when we're not consumed with ourselves
[32:43] anymore
[32:46] because the world is consumed with
[32:48] themselves
[32:51] we have a much greater interest a much
[32:54] greater value to esteem
[32:58] when we're loving one another when
[33:00] something has taken place in your life
[33:02] when love has come into your heart
[33:04] there's a greater interest than just for
[33:07] yourself it's for others
[33:10] the world loves themselves but we love
[33:12] our enemies
[33:16] what a difference what a difference
[33:19] something has taken place when we're not
[33:22] consumed
[33:23] with ourselves anymore even our thoughts
[33:27] we can hardly get others off our minds
[33:34] because there's a burden there a love
[33:36] there for their soul
[33:38] you know we can get so consumed with
[33:40] ourselves that
[33:41] we don't even think about somebody's
[33:43] soul
[33:47] i want you as you're hearing this word
[33:49] today being preached
[33:50] i want you to examine yourself
[33:57] are you releasing god's love or are you
[34:01] in a pool
[34:07] our words our conversation should be
[34:09] easily
[34:10] read by others that we love them
[34:16] something should stand out about us than
[34:18] a million other people
[34:22] amen verse 15 whosoever hateth his
[34:26] brother
[34:27] is a murderer and you know that no
[34:29] murders have eternal life
[34:31] abiding in him
[34:37] i'd like to know who is guilty of murder
[34:39] today let me see your hands
[34:41] one two three four we got few honest
[34:44] people in here
[34:45] what about the rest of you
[34:51] the world would never consider a man
[34:54] looking at a woman or a woman looking at
[34:57] a man with a desire for them
[34:59] guilty of adultery
[35:03] is that true can't go to court like that
[35:06] but you know
[35:07] god would the world
[35:10] court would never put a man on trial for
[35:14] murder
[35:14] if he was just talking negatively about
[35:16] someone
[35:18] but god would
[35:22] so whose standard are you judging
[35:24] yourself with the world
[35:26] or gods to put a knife in the back of
[35:30] someone's influence is guilty of murder
[35:33] [Applause]
[35:37] and the scripture says that no murderer
[35:40] have eternal life abiding in him
[35:42] this is why this is so important
[35:46] because either we got to hold ourselves
[35:48] accountable
[35:51] or totally ignore the word
[35:55] and i think it'd be better to let the
[35:57] word change our attitude
[36:01] and you know that no murder have eternal
[36:04] life
[36:04] abiding in him verse 16 hereby perceive
[36:07] we the love of god because he laid down
[36:11] his life for us
[36:13] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[36:15] brethren
[36:18] so let's just get this straight i want
[36:20] to perceive whether i got the love of
[36:21] god
[36:22] god came into my life he changed my life
[36:25] he made
[36:26] me just feel so good
[36:34] so let's perceive that love
[36:38] all his brother john does is talk about
[36:40] jesus lay down his life from
[36:44] but i don't see anything different
[36:52] but you will perceive the love of god
[36:54] when i lay down my life
[36:56] for somebody else
[36:59] [Applause]
[37:00] so i want to ask you today i want to
[37:02] perceive your life
[37:07] i want you to perceive the love of god
[37:09] in your life
[37:13] what are you laying down
[37:18] because we can know exactly
[37:23] where we're at we can know how much love
[37:27] of you know you go in your gas tank you
[37:29] go in your car and you look at the tank
[37:30] and you know
[37:32] how much gas is in there
[37:38] we come to church to find out where
[37:39] we're at with god
[37:41] the devil will tell us all day long how
[37:43] good we are
[37:44] we're so good we don't even need to go
[37:46] to church anymore
[37:50] you'll be just fine stay home take it
[37:53] easy
[37:54] you're still bride
[37:58] but you come and you hear the word and
[38:00] you allow that word
[38:04] perceive the love of god in me
[38:08] who am i laying down my life for
[38:12] christ laid down his life for me we
[38:15] ought
[38:16] in other words we're not doing it we
[38:18] ought
[38:19] to be doing it we ought to be laying
[38:21] down our life for somebody
[38:24] fill the blanket fill the blanket every
[38:27] day this is
[38:28] fill the blank no you used to go to
[38:31] school and it was multiple choice you
[38:32] thought
[38:33] at least i got a chance you got to fill
[38:36] the blank hole man you're in trouble
[38:41] multiple choice do you love god yes i
[38:43] love god
[38:46] fill in the blank who are you loving
[38:49] who are you laying down your life for
[38:53] test becomes harder
[38:56] but there's the only way you can
[38:57] perceive whether you know this stuff or
[38:58] not you ever take a test
[39:00] and you just you do real good on it
[39:04] but it's all guesswork you know what i'm
[39:07] talking about
[39:08] i told you about the time my teacher i
[39:10] got i didn't get good grades hardly
[39:12] through the whole
[39:13] thing i almost aced it
[39:16] on my final and he did everything he
[39:20] could except stand there
[39:22] and deny me right to my face that i was
[39:25] a cheater
[39:30] but i stayed up all night and i studied
[39:32] like i'd never studied before
[39:35] it's what it took
[39:40] but you can't fake the love of god
[39:47] that's right by this shall all men
[39:51] know that you're my disciples when you
[39:53] have this same
[39:54] love where you lay down your life
[39:59] releasing the love of god release it
[40:02] if it's in you release it don't hold it
[40:06] don't keep it don't say it's for me and
[40:09] my family
[40:10] release it to another soul that don't
[40:12] know him yet
[40:13] because that's what it's for
[40:18] so what are you doing with your time
[40:33] i just don't have much time brother john
[40:36] i don't have much time i barely
[40:40] have time to make it to church
[40:46] let me ask you a question when have you
[40:48] in your life
[40:49] ever had enough time
[40:55] oh i can't wait till i retire and then
[40:57] what
[41:03] the prophet taught us that eternal life
[41:06] is living for others
[41:11] eternal life is living for eternal
[41:14] things
[41:17] so when you're living for somebody's
[41:18] soul that's eternal
[41:22] when you're just baking my favorite pie
[41:25] which you know we need to step that up a
[41:27] little bit when when you're just baking
[41:29] my favorite pie
[41:31] it's not eternal you may get a reward
[41:34] for it
[41:37] that's not eternal
[41:42] can you imagine going to heaven
[41:46] we're having a giving pie to the pastor
[41:49] contest
[41:52] and so and so over here won it with
[41:54] umpteen pies for their pastor
[42:00] okay what are we gonna do talk about
[42:01] that for 10 000 years
[42:05] but get a soul saved that soul will not
[42:08] want to leave your presence
[42:10] because they know they wouldn't be there
[42:12] without you
[42:14] that's how important it is to bring
[42:16] jesus to somebody
[42:18] and don't listen to a devil that tells
[42:20] you well if it's god god would speak to
[42:22] him anyways
[42:23] [Applause]
[42:27] can you imagine if god told
[42:30] paul that oh don't worry i'll get the
[42:33] word to them
[42:34] you just take it easy
[42:40] god wants to express his love
[42:47] if if alls i'm going to do
[42:52] is pat my brother's back hoping that
[42:55] he'll pat mine
[43:00] am i not like the publicans
[43:04] but when you can do something for
[43:06] somebody
[43:10] knowing they can't do it back to you
[43:17] that's the love of god and every one of
[43:20] us has an opportunity to do that
[43:23] you just need to put it on your heart to
[43:25] go find somebody
[43:27] to share the love of god with somebody
[43:30] to release it don't hold it in
[43:33] release the love of god
[43:40] we're living in heaven we're not going
[43:41] to be thinking about temporal things
[43:46] so what does it mean to live for others
[43:50] what does that mean
[43:57] does it mean to make pies to one another
[44:08] next sunday next sunday you bring a
[44:12] piece of paper i want to know
[44:13] all the things that you've been doing to
[44:16] live for others
[44:20] we need it we can't be satisfied with
[44:23] saying i'm in the message
[44:25] i received the message i've been saved
[44:29] what are we doing with what we've been
[44:30] given
[44:32] we've got to release the love of god let
[44:35] god use our bodies
[44:37] release that love of god amen hereby we
[44:40] perceive
[44:41] we understand what the love of god is
[44:44] for because
[44:45] his great love wherewith he loved us
[44:48] his enemies he loved his enemies
[44:52] he laid down his life for us and when
[44:55] the
[44:56] love of god is shut about in our hearts
[44:58] by the holy ghost we will do the very
[45:00] same thing because god is the same
[45:04] yesterday today and forever he's just
[45:06] using a different body
[45:10] he's not using william brandon anymore
[45:11] he's using you
[45:14] he's not using the pastor he's using you
[45:18] amen the greatest power a believer can
[45:21] ever experience
[45:22] is when they release the love of god to
[45:25] another soul
[45:26] there is no greater experience greater
[45:29] love have no man than this than a man
[45:31] lay down
[45:32] his life for his friends john 15 verse
[45:35] 12
[45:36] this is my commandment that ye love one
[45:38] another as i
[45:40] have loved you
[45:43] god went to extremes to get me
[45:49] he had to basically
[45:52] knock me off of my horse
[46:00] he had to show me i was so wrong
[46:06] amen and then he just spent time with me
[46:08] kept
[46:09] calling my heart kept saying i'm here
[46:13] i'm here for you just give your heart to
[46:16] me
[46:18] sometimes we just get all upset bothered
[46:21] because we tried sharing jesus with
[46:23] somebody
[46:23] and they get all offended can you
[46:27] imagine if the holy ghost stopped with
[46:28] you
[46:30] greater love have no manners and a man
[46:32] lay down
[46:33] his lie for his friends now remember
[46:37] when jesus laid down his life for you
[46:40] you were his enemy
[46:43] you only became a friend afterwards
[46:48] so the people that we're talking to may
[46:50] not be our friends right now
[46:54] but we we believe they are they just
[46:56] don't know it
[46:57] right you know brother bran could come
[46:59] up to the pulpit and he'd say
[47:00] good morning friends there were people
[47:02] out there that hated him that he was a
[47:04] friend to them
[47:08] it's the god inside of you is
[47:11] befriending them
[47:13] amen and he said in verse 14 you are my
[47:15] friends if you do
[47:17] whatsoever i command you
[47:21] god has commanded us to lay down our
[47:23] life
[47:25] to live for others the greatest power
[47:29] sinner can experience is when he
[47:31] receives forgiveness
[47:32] of his sins so if god is in you
[47:37] release forgiveness somebody offends you
[47:39] release forgiveness
[47:41] release love release grace
[47:46] be christ to them
[47:50] let christ be himself inside of you
[47:53] whoa that was fresh
[47:57] let christ be himself inside of you
[48:00] just let go and let god have his
[48:04] wonderful way remember the parable this
[48:06] morning
[48:07] of who loved the most
[48:10] was proven by who was who forgave
[48:14] the most jesus forgave both equally
[48:19] but the one that had the greatest debt
[48:21] loved
[48:22] the most so
[48:26] i say instead of looking at every time
[48:29] you get offended or bothered by
[48:30] something or some one or or some
[48:33] situation
[48:34] instead of being bothered by it look at
[48:37] it as an
[48:37] opportunity to manifest the love of god
[48:42] because the more that you forgive
[48:44] somebody shows you've got more love
[48:51] you know you want to be so full of the
[48:52] love of god that no matter which way
[48:54] you're
[48:55] you know pushed offended love comes out
[49:02] is full of compassion we should be too
[49:06] jude chapter 1 verse 22 and some have
[49:09] compassion making a difference
[49:14] who makes a difference when you think of
[49:17] the people in your life
[49:21] who's made a difference in your life the
[49:23] person who writes you off the person who
[49:25] don't care
[49:27] the person don't want to give you the
[49:28] time of day
[49:31] it's the person that has compassion
[49:34] they are the ones that will lay down
[49:36] their life
[49:37] they make a difference i think it's time
[49:41] for us to start making
[49:42] more of a difference amen can you say
[49:45] amen to that
[49:47] it's time for us to start using
[49:49] compassion
[49:50] to make the difference in somebody's
[49:52] life
[49:54] brother branham said in the message love
[49:56] he said when love
[50:00] excuse me he didn't say that he said
[50:03] when love has been projected and comes
[50:05] to its end
[50:06] sovereign grace stepped in and took its
[50:09] place
[50:10] he said it will do it every
[50:14] time he said that's the nature of god
[50:18] he can't do nothing else for anybody
[50:21] but when you really truly love him
[50:24] loving him
[50:25] is not just a mystical thought but i
[50:28] mean
[50:28] in your heart he becomes dear to you now
[50:32] i want you to think about that
[50:34] when we think about the love of god
[50:36] inside of us it isn't just a thought
[50:39] it's it's something that controls you
[50:44] constrains you in other words you want
[50:46] to go this way but the love of god says
[50:48] no go this way
[50:50] it controls you it's that real
[50:55] if it's something that's just in your
[50:56] head and it's a it's a mystical thought
[50:58] it's not that real to you it's time
[51:02] to spend more time with the love of god
[51:04] amen
[51:06] so what are the boundaries of god's
[51:08] great love ephesians
[51:10] chapter 3 verse 17 just how far will the
[51:13] love of god go what is the extremes that
[51:16] god's love will go ephesians 3
[51:19] verse 17 that christ may dwell in your
[51:22] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[51:24] grounded in love
[51:25] may be able to comprehend with all
[51:27] saints what is the breath
[51:28] length death and height and to know the
[51:31] love of god
[51:32] that passes knowledge
[51:35] that ye might be filled with the
[51:38] fullness of god
[51:40] amen now unto him that is able to do
[51:43] exceed me above
[51:44] all that we ask or think according to
[51:46] the power what
[51:48] the power that's working in us
[51:52] did not he say we would receive power
[51:54] after the holy ghost has come upon us
[51:59] now the more of the love of god we have
[52:02] in us
[52:02] the more power we have
[52:06] and it takes more power to forgive than
[52:08] to judge
[52:10] it takes more power to lay down your
[52:12] life than say no i can't let that person
[52:14] step on me again
[52:17] you know i'm done turning my cheek i'm
[52:19] done going the second mile
[52:21] i'm done done done done
[52:25] you never see the love of god saying i'm
[52:27] done done done done
[52:30] all you're doing is speaking about your
[52:32] love because god love has no end
[52:35] it it never quits it on the day of
[52:38] judgment
[52:39] is when it's all over
[52:44] but until then we should continue to lay
[52:48] down our life
[52:49] well once hate filled paul's life and he
[52:52] didn't care about hurting others
[52:54] even killing others but the love of god
[52:58] came inside paul's heart and it produced
[53:00] the same effect that it did on jesus
[53:04] he laid down his life for his friends he
[53:07] got stoned
[53:09] he was afflicted from being whipped just
[53:12] like jesus five times received 39
[53:15] stripes on his body he said in one place
[53:18] i bear in my body the marks
[53:21] of the lord jesus christ he was
[53:23] persecuted beaten with rods
[53:25] he frequently went to prison
[53:28] and he died often i i can't quite
[53:33] comprehend
[53:34] that but maybe he died a lot more than
[53:37] we realize
[53:40] but if he did no wonder he could say in
[53:42] acts chapter 20 verse 24 but none of
[53:44] these things move me
[53:46] neither come in my my life dear unto
[53:48] myself
[53:49] so that i might finish my course with
[53:51] joy
[53:52] and the ministry of reconciliation that
[53:55] god gave me
[53:56] which i have received to the lord to
[53:58] testify the gospel
[54:00] of the grace of god
[54:07] he wanted to finish his ministry
[54:11] he wanted to finish his course and he
[54:14] didn't want to come to church
[54:15] drudgingly he wanted to do a joy
[54:20] i think god was in control of his vessel
[54:24] we cannot let our lamps go out
[54:27] we can't let the holy ghost slip out
[54:31] you the world would drag
[54:38] so much out of us the paul of the world
[54:42] would drag out so much and we've got to
[54:45] come back to god we got to spend time at
[54:47] the altar we got to spend time seeking
[54:50] the holy ghost
[54:50] we've got to humble ourself and realize
[54:53] that something is missing
[54:56] because you can't give out what you
[54:58] don't have
[55:00] i understand there's one baptism
[55:04] but we need some fillings we need more
[55:06] fillings we need to get to the filling
[55:08] station
[55:11] don't tell me your car's electric get to
[55:14] the filling station get
[55:15] get charged up acts chapter 21 verse 13
[55:20] then paul answered what me need to weep
[55:23] and to break my heart for i am not
[55:25] but i i am ready not to be bound only
[55:28] but also to die at jerusalem for the
[55:31] name
[55:32] of the lord jesus christ that's
[55:36] to me eternal life that to me is laying
[55:40] down your life
[55:42] so how far will god's love take you
[55:45] for a soul how far
[55:48] has it been taking you
[55:52] how many bible studies have you been
[55:54] having with somebody that don't know
[55:55] jesus
[55:57] how much time have you been spending
[55:59] with someone
[56:02] what sacrifices will you make
[56:06] for a soul some
[56:09] have compassion making a difference
[56:13] some not everybody but this word
[56:17] god deals with us as as individual
[56:21] gentiles some
[56:24] this word is just going to roll off the
[56:26] back
[56:27] like water off a duck's back
[56:31] in some this word is going to penetrate
[56:34] it's going to penetrate into the heart
[56:36] because the heart has been prepared
[56:37] there's a sincerity
[56:39] inside and they want to lay down their
[56:41] life they want to
[56:42] let love be released they want to take
[56:45] their relationship the next step
[56:51] the greatest power a believer can
[56:54] experience
[56:55] is releasing the love of god inside of
[56:58] you
[56:59] to have god use your body
[57:02] wow release what you have
[57:05] give it up god will give you more cast
[57:08] your bread upon the water give it to
[57:10] seven
[57:11] even to eight we don't have a promise of
[57:14] tomorrow you don't need
[57:15] you know you may not have a chance to
[57:17] live for god tomorrow if it was over
[57:19] today would you be happy with what you
[57:21] did for christ
[57:24] would you be happy would you be
[57:26] satisfied would you be
[57:27] standing there with your list of
[57:31] what you did with your time
[57:38] oh a person that sold out to god can do
[57:40] more for god
[57:42] in a year than
[57:46] a lot of people can do for the lord in a
[57:52] lifetime
[57:54] want to have every excuse in the book
[57:56] and the other just says
[58:02] all to jesus
[58:05] all to jesus there is nothing else worth
[58:08] living for
[58:11] so don't be a system a system
[58:15] don't let your life get all wrapped up
[58:17] in yourself
[58:20] let the love of god constrain you to
[58:23] reach out
[58:24] while you have a chance
[58:27] if you are honest with yourself and you
[58:29] look back
[58:30] two years ago one year ago isn't it
[58:33] harder today to serve god than it was
[58:36] then
[58:37] isn't there less of a desire today those
[58:41] of you that been serving the lord a
[58:42] while
[58:45] well it's getting harder the world's
[58:47] getting darker and it's harder to get a
[58:51] hold of god
[58:51] in church
[58:55] we're hoping that that something
[58:57] controls our feeling and what we need to
[58:59] do is get our feelings
[59:00] under god and set our affections on
[59:03] things above and not just be
[59:04] satisfied with church attendance
[59:08] i've never experienced a love so great
[59:10] as when god uses me
[59:13] to help another soul just naturally when
[59:16] you do something for somebody you get
[59:18] such a a wonderful feeling even if you
[59:21] make a pie
[59:22] it's a wonderful feeling to do it and
[59:24] give it to somebody
[59:25] but there's no greater experience that
[59:29] i've ever experienced
[59:30] that when i've laid down my life for a
[59:32] soul
[59:39] i feel so unworthy because that soul
[59:43] that god is
[59:44] reaching to is worth ten thousand worlds
[59:48] so i wanna leave you with this i wanna
[59:51] encourage you
[59:52] to start exercising the releasing of
[59:55] god's love
[59:58] there's what a way to experience it you
[1:00:01] you have received it now release it
[1:00:04] and and keep that cycle going receive
[1:00:07] more
[1:00:07] give more receive more give more and
[1:00:10] keep
[1:00:11] the life of christ flowing through your
[1:00:13] life
[1:00:14] don't be satisfied with the knowledge
[1:00:16] and what you have received up here and
[1:00:18] where you're standing
[1:00:22] hold yourself accountable to living for
[1:00:24] others
[1:00:25] amen let's stand together
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:38] amen so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm
[1:00:41] yours
[1:00:45] [Applause]
