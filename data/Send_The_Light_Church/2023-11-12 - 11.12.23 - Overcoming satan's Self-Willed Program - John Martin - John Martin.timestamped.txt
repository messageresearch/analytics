[39:15] the word can change our nature there's
[39:17] nothing that we could do to save oursel
[39:19] or to change our
[39:20] nature the Bible says the law of the
[39:23] Lord is perfect converting the soul but
[39:26] we
[39:27] understand that not All Souls can be
[39:33] converted and there's a lot of people
[39:35] trying with self-help to help themselves
[39:38] and that only goes so
[39:40] far
[39:42] and the the soul is the nature of the
[39:45] spirit so we want to overcome Satan's
[39:49] self-willed nature that we were born
[39:51] with and we do that by receiving the
[39:55] word of God that's it is that simple by
[39:57] receiving the word of God not into our
[39:59] minds not into our ability to quote but
[40:03] into the manifestation of Our Lives
[40:06] amen now this morning we're going to
[40:09] talk a lot about the
[40:12] devil I hope that's
[40:14] okay those that are watching for the
[40:17] first time I don't want you to think
[40:18] that we're a
[40:19] cult but we want to talk about the devil
[40:23] now this up on the board here says study
[40:25] your Bible because Satan studies
[40:28] you so I want to I want to study Satan
[40:32] today through the
[40:33] Bible and I I I firmly believe if I
[40:36] never see Satan who he really is I'll
[40:38] never be able to see him who he is
[40:40] inside of
[40:42] me and and I've got to see him inside of
[40:45] me because I'm the only one that can
[40:48] overcome for me you are the only one
[40:49] that can overcome for
[40:51] you all right we're going to do a couple
[40:53] lengthy readings and the first one is an
[40:56] Isaiah 14 starting with verse
[41:03] 12 I didn't want you have to stand for
[41:07] these Isaiah 14:12 I didn't you know
[41:10] nobody I didn't hear any Pages
[41:14] moving you got to your Bible you got to
[41:17] because we could be putting up the wrong
[41:19] words here we'd never do that
[41:22] but it's important that we read our
[41:25] Bible how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[41:28] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[41:31] cut down to the ground which did US
[41:33] weaken the Nations for thou has said in

[41:44] sides of the
[41:46] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[41:48] the clouds and I will be like the most
[41:52] high yet Thou shalt be brought down to
[41:54] Hell to the sides of the pit and they

[41:59] thee and consider thee
[42:02] saying is this the man that made earth
[42:06] the earth to tremble and did Shake
[42:10] kingdoms that made the world as a
[42:13] Wilderness and destroyed the cities
[42:15] thereof and opened not the house of his

[42:38] amen Ezekiel 28 starting with verse
[42:41] number 11 son of man take up a
[42:43] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and
[42:47] say unto him thus sayeth the Lord God
[42:50] thou seal us up the sum full of
[42:54] wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou has
[42:58] been in Eden the Garden of God and every
[43:01] precious stone was thy covering the
[43:02] Sardis topz Diamond Barrel onx Jasper
[43:06] Sapphire emerald and the carbuncle and
[43:10] gold and the workmanship of thy tablets
[43:13] and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in
[43:17] the day that thou was
[43:20] created Thou Art the anointed cherub
[43:22] that coverthe set thee so thou was upon
[43:27] the holy mountain of God and has walked
[43:29] up and down in the midst of the stones
[43:31] of the
[43:32] fire thou was perfect in thy ways from
[43:37] the time that thou was created till
[43:40] iniquity was found in
[43:43] thee by the multitude of thy
[43:46] merchandise they have filled the midst
[43:48] of thee with violence and thou has
[43:51] sinned therefore I will cast thee as
[43:53] profane out of the Mountain of God and I
[43:55] will destroy thee old covering cheran
[43:57] from the midst of the stones of fire
[44:00] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[44:02] Beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[44:05] the reason of bright of thy
[44:07] brightness and I will cast thee to the
[44:09] ground and I will lay thee upon I will
[44:11] lay thee before
[44:13] kings that they may behold thee thou has
[44:17] defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude
[44:20] of thy iniquities by the iniquity of thy
[44:22] traffic therefore will I bring thee
[44:24] forth a fire
[44:26] from the midst of thee and it shall
[44:28] devour thee and I will bring thee to the
[44:31] ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all
[44:34] them that behold
[44:35] thee and they that Know Thee among the
[44:39] people shall be astonished at thee Thou
[44:42] shalt be a terror and never shall thou
[44:45] be
[44:48] anymore amen praise the Lord I'm looking
[44:51] forward to that day
[44:53] amen now the path of L Lucifer is a very
[44:57] crooked
[44:59] path he was created absolutely perfect
[45:03] the Bible says blameless he was a model
[45:06] of perfection full of wisdom and perfect
[45:09] in Beauty when God created a body for
[45:12] him to dwell in the Bible says there was
[45:14] no beauty that we should behold but when
[45:16] he created Lucifer he was absolutely
[45:18] perfect in
[45:21] Beauty Lucifer was covered with every
[45:24] precious stone that God created
[45:27] God anointed him and set him up to be
[45:29] the anointed cherub of that covered the
[45:31] holy
[45:32] place he was a marvelous being of power
[45:37] he had power he was on the holy mount
[45:41] with God he was the brightest among all
[45:44] the angels and I probably say in a
[45:46] number of different
[45:48] ways but he was one of the morning Stars
[45:51] he was the son of the morning the Bible
[45:53] says the very word Lucifer means
[45:56] lightbearer he was a carrier of the
[45:59] light and he walked up and down in the
[46:01] midst of the stones I I believe he
[46:03] walked around all the revelations of God
[46:06] and all the creation of God and he saw
[46:09] when God spoke the word that it came to
[46:14] pass God used him in a mighty
[46:17] way he was a leader he was sent on
[46:20] missions no
[46:22] doubt do you believe that do you know
[46:25] God has investigating angels that he
[46:27] sends out to carry out specific duties
[46:30] this day God sent the angel of Gabriel
[46:33] twice to
[46:34] Daniel once to
[46:38] Zachariah telling that he was going to
[46:40] be a a a father and and he he Gabriel
[46:44] even had power to close zacharias's
[46:47] mouth that he couldn't
[46:49] speak Gabriel Gabriel was sent to Mary
[46:53] about the birth of Jesus God sent the
[46:56] Angel Michael also to
[46:59] Daniel and he sent to engage in wars and
[47:03] against the powers of Satan as we read
[47:04] in our opening scripture he was a
[47:07] protector so no doubt Lucifer was an
[47:10] extremely powerful Angel he was an
[47:13] influential angel I believe God used him
[47:15] in a mighty way in so much that he
[47:18] gained the respect of the other angels
[47:20] that were there they all kind of like
[47:22] looked up to him do you believe that in
[47:24] the process of time
[47:26] Lucifer's
[47:27] brightness uh got to
[47:29] him it blinded him you know what happens
[47:32] when you look at the Sun so long you'll
[47:34] go
[47:36] blind and and Lucifer lost track of
[47:39] whose light he was carrying whose light
[47:41] he was bearing and he looked at how much
[47:44] light he had and he he he just thought
[47:47] that it was his own he lost track of the
[47:50] author of that light that's why we need
[47:53] to look to the author and the finisher
[47:55] of our faith amen it was at that time
[48:00] that God found iniquity in his
[48:06] heart he thought he entertained the
[48:10] thought that had never been entertained
[48:12] before and that thought was I could do
[48:17] what I wanted to do instead of what God
[48:20] wanted me to
[48:22] do it seemed at the time just a harmless
[48:25] thought
[48:28] but it was when he had that thought in
[48:30] his heart that was the first sin that
[48:31] ever took place in
[48:35] heaven the Bible says that his heart was
[48:39] lifted up because of his
[48:41] Beauty and he corrupted his god-given
[48:44] wisdom by a reason of his
[48:48] brightness he kept looking to
[48:52] himself Lucifer became so jealous of God
[48:56] that he said in his heart I will Ascend
[48:58] into heaven I will exalt the Throne of
[49:00] God above the stars of God I will sit I
[49:04] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[49:07] God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[49:10] the congregation and I will Ascend above
[49:12] the heights of the clouds I will be like
[49:15] the most high and I'll tell you when we
[49:19] get thoughts that we're going to you
[49:21] know outdo somebody you know jealousy
[49:24] thoughts I'm going to tell that's from
[49:26] the pit of
[49:29] Hell that is from the pit of
[49:31] Hell so Lucifer used his god-given
[49:35] influence because God gave him influence
[49:38] and he started conniving the other
[49:41] Angels who were already wowed at his
[49:45] abilities and through a period of time
[49:48] Lucifer convinced a third of the angels
[49:50] to follow him through iniquity he used
[49:55] iniquity it to get them to follow him
[49:58] into more iniquity so it was through
[50:01] iniquity he got them into
[50:04] iniquity into his new kingdom to a new
[50:08] way of living without the will of God in
[50:11] mind with Liberties they've never
[50:13] experienced before that they could do
[50:15] whatever they wanted to do and no longer
[50:17] had to stick to the strict rules that
[50:19] God had it was so appealing that Lucifer
[50:23] the Bible says drew a third of the
[50:25] angels with his
[50:28] tail I wonder how long do you think
[50:30] iniquity was in heaven before Lucifer
[50:33] was kicked
[50:39] out luer for filled heaven with his
[50:45] garbage he destroyed a perfect setting
[50:48] that God had in
[50:50] heaven he spread the fake
[50:53] news what was the fake news news the
[50:56] fake news was you don't have to listen
[50:58] to all of God's
[50:59] word you don't have to do everything
[51:02] that he says to do that's fake news and
[51:06] he stood there and he says look at me I
[51:07] am living proof today that you don't
[51:10] have to do everything that God tells you
[51:12] to do and you're still everything's
[51:14] still going to be okay he was able to
[51:17] convince the other
[51:18] Angels nothing happened to me nothing
[51:22] will happen to you you can do what you
[51:24] want to do
[51:27] he was dead while he was
[51:29] living there was war in heaven the Bible
[51:31] says and Michael and the archangels
[51:33] fought against the dragon the dragon
[51:35] fought against the angels and prevailed
[51:37] not neither was there Place found in
[51:39] heaven anymore and the Great Dragon was
[51:42] cast out that old serpent called the
[51:44] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[51:46] whole world he was cast out into the
[51:50] Earth with his angels with his angels
[51:54] were cast out with him and his angels
[51:56] were cast out with
[51:59] him now it wasn't good
[52:03] enough his iniquity had to get
[52:07] spread he's so mad at God today he's
[52:10] still mad at God he's still jealous of
[52:12] God today his driving force to do evil
[52:16] is
[52:17] jealousy that's why we got to keep it
[52:19] out of our
[52:21] life cuz he it filled his life with
[52:24] violence the Bible
[52:26] says so Satan destroyed a perfect
[52:30] setting that he had in the Garden of
[52:33] Eden God had a perfect setting in the
[52:36] Garden of Eden and Satan destroyed that
[52:38] did he the Beast said to Eve for God
[52:41] doth know that in the day you eat of my
[52:44] idea then your eyes shall be open you
[52:47] shall be as God's knowing good and
[52:50] evil not only knowing good and evil but
[52:53] choosing to do your will above Gods
[52:56] that's what he proposed to Eve the same
[52:58] thing he proposed to the angels in
[53:01] heaven and Satan perverted and destroyed
[53:04] a perfect setting that was in the garden
[53:07] just like he perverted a perfect setting
[53:11] I'll say it like this destroyed a
[53:13] perfect setting that God had
[53:17] created that's why he had to get kicked
[53:20] out that's why the Angels had to get
[53:22] kicked out that followed him because God
[53:25] was not going to have
[53:28] iniquity and what did he tell uh and
[53:32] what did he say there he said you know
[53:34] we've got to put up flaming swords to
[53:36] keep man from coming and partaking of
[53:38] the tree of life because he is he is
[53:40] filled his life with
[53:43] iniquity and there had to be a
[53:45] separation
[53:46] there and today Satan is weakening the
[53:50] Nations
[53:52] today through
[53:54] iniquity by giving them what they
[53:57] want instead of what's
[53:59] right you want gay rights you can have
[54:02] it you want to change your gender go
[54:04] ahead you want to abort your babies go
[54:06] ahead you want to control the the
[54:09] population by killing then you go ahead
[54:11] and do that you want human trafficking
[54:14] you can have it you want fent on your
[54:16] streets you can have it you want Wars
[54:18] you can have it that is what Satan is
[54:21] giving the
[54:23] world Jesus said in the last days
[54:25] iniquity would abound and it's
[54:29] abounding whatever people want Satan
[54:31] would just give it to them and when they
[54:34] get it what happens it destroys them you
[54:37] want liquor it'll destroy you want porn
[54:39] it'll destroy you you want money it to

[54:49] Cities The Monuments the the Looting the
[54:51] defunding the police it was money money

[54:56] do that where the money come from to
[54:59] support ham Hamas
[55:01] Hamas money did that without money they
[55:04] couldn't get guns
[55:07] and Nation Rising against Nation Satan
[55:11] is weakening the Nations
[55:13] today through so many
[55:15] Avenues but the world doesn't recognize
[55:18] it's the
[55:20] devil the bottom line they don't they
[55:23] think it's the Russians
[55:27] China many think it's the Jews it's a
[55:30] Jews fault that's why they hate the Jews
[55:33] it's North Korea it's Iran it's the
[55:35] immigrants coming over the borders it's
[55:38] to Cel with the drugs the blacks think
[55:41] it's the whites the whites think it's
[55:43] the
[55:45] whoever Democrats think it's the
[55:47] Republicans the B Republicans think it's
[55:49] the Democrats you know what I'm saying
[55:51] here some think it's our government the
[55:54] FBI the CIA or the police some think
[55:58] it's Bill Gates George
[56:01] Soros come
[56:04] on we're living in the hour that se
[56:08] Satan is weakening the
[56:10] Nations he's perverting the world from
[56:12] one end to the other from the North Pole
[56:15] to the South Pole but the world does not
[56:17] recognize that it's Satan Behind these
[56:20] people he's influencing these
[56:23] people he's given them what they want as
[56:27] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[56:29] be in the coming of the Lord as it was
[56:32] in the days of the lot so shall it be in
[56:33] the coming of the Lord nations are
[56:36] breaking
[56:38] down what else is Lucifer
[56:43] weakening the
[56:46] church Satan has perverted the Churches
[56:49] of
[56:50] God he goes to church
[56:53] too he tries to pervert the truth in the
[56:57] minds of the
[57:01] people second Corinthians 4:3 says but
[57:04] if our gospel be hid it is hid from them
[57:07] that are
[57:08] lost in whom the God of this world have
[57:12] blinded the minds of them which believe
[57:15] not the worst thing you could do is when
[57:18] you hear the gospel being preached when
[57:20] you read the Bible the worst thing you
[57:23] could do is question that
[57:26] is doubt that because as soon as you do
[57:29] you open the door for the devil to Blind
[57:31] your
[57:34] mind brother the Bandon said in the
[57:36] message a blushing prophet he says Don't
[57:38] Let The Devil Pat you on the shoulder
[57:40] and say well I go to
[57:43] church the devil does too he said that's
[57:47] right he sure did come up to God went to
[57:50] church up in heaven come before the
[57:52] Throne of God with the sons of of God
[57:55] sat down with them had an audience with
[57:57] God he said where you
[57:58] been walking to and fro up and down on
[58:02] the earth that's where I've been so the
[58:05] devil goes to church the devil belongs
[58:08] to church the devil acts like a
[58:11] Christian he's a deceiver and if he
[58:15] didn't act like a
[58:16] Christian and and act like a church he
[58:20] wouldn't be a deceiver and no man could
[58:22] be deceived the only thing is it it's
[58:26] different it its difference is as black
[58:29] as white now he's saying he's saying
[58:32] that Satan the difference between a
[58:34] Christian and the devil acting like a
[58:36] Christian is black and
[58:40] white it's contrary to one another he
[58:43] said but the Bible said and the it would
[58:46] be so close that it would deceive the
[58:48] very
[58:50] elect the spirit in the last days
[58:52] friends were here so he's given a script
[58:54] scripture that they're so close only the
[58:56] elect's going to be able to see them
[58:58] they're so far it's such a vast
[59:01] difference is black and
[59:02] white I wonder what that is I wonder
[59:05] what that is we're going to see what
[59:06] that is how is Satan doing
[59:10] this how is
[59:12] he defiling the
[59:14] church the Bible says that thou has
[59:17] defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude
[59:21] of thine
[59:22] iniquities by the ini ity of thy
[59:28] traffic well when we talk about traffic
[59:31] we talk about well how's 23 how was the
[59:33] traffic when you came to church Brother
[59:35] Bruce how's the traffic here how's the
[59:39] traffic on
[59:41] Leroy well you know the devil does a lot
[59:44] of
[59:46] trafficking you know what he's doing
[59:48] he's offering members of the church the
[59:50] same thing that he offered the angels in
[59:52] heaven you can pick a choose choose what
[59:55] you want to obey and you don't have to
[59:56] do everything I am living
[59:59] proof you can do what you want to do you
[1:00:01] can choose what you want to
[1:00:03] choose and that's following my
[1:00:09] way no PE the whole world is following
[1:00:13] Satan and they don't even know
[1:00:16] it anything that is not God's way is
[1:00:19] Satan's way there's no there's no God's
[1:00:23] way Satan's way and then there's John
[1:00:25] Martin's way it don't work like that
[1:00:28] there's only two
[1:00:32] ways that's why there's only one way to
[1:00:34] make
[1:00:37] it Satan is pedling his ideas that's
[1:00:41] what that word means traffic he's
[1:00:44] pedling his ideas with the church
[1:00:46] members and he's offering them what an
[1:00:49] easier
[1:00:51] way an easier way he's bartering and
[1:00:55] trading with church members a broader
[1:00:58] way an easier path and that's what it
[1:01:00] means that word traffic it means to
[1:01:02] paddle to barter to to trade he's given
[1:01:06] you something different than what the
[1:01:08] word is
[1:01:13] saying Satan is selling his lies right
[1:01:17] inside the
[1:01:19] church just like he did in
[1:01:23] heaven
[1:01:29] look the deception is not behind the
[1:01:31] pulpit I'm
[1:01:33] sorry we don't got people come in here
[1:01:36] preaching false
[1:01:38] Doctrine I'm not I'm sure it's in
[1:01:41] churches I know it is but it's not in
[1:01:44] this
[1:01:46] church but Satan is here and he's still
[1:01:49] doing his job where is he doing it in
[1:01:51] our minds why we sit here listening to
[1:01:53] the word he's doing traffic he's
[1:01:56] paddling oh you don't got to do
[1:01:58] that that's just
[1:02:01] uh just a little bit of a
[1:02:04] compromise and he he's filling the
[1:02:07] sanctuaries with
[1:02:10] iniquity even today Satan who is the
[1:02:12] epitome of evil has the power to
[1:02:16] transform himself as an angel of Light
[1:02:18] the Bible says not even recognizing it's
[1:02:21] the devil he has the ability to mix
[1:02:24] light and
[1:02:26] darkness he is the author of confusion
[1:02:29] he is the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:02:32] Evil he knows what's good but chooses to
[1:02:36] not do it that's
[1:02:38] bad that's what evil is he that knoweth
[1:02:41] to do good and doeth it not to him it is
[1:02:45] sin today we're facing the devil who's
[1:02:49] trying to convince the church that we
[1:02:51] don't need to do all of God's will right
[1:02:55] I got the main things you know I I I I
[1:02:58] got baptized I I I come to church I I
[1:03:01] pay and that's the main
[1:03:06] thing show me a scripture in the Bible
[1:03:08] just one that says that's all you got to
[1:03:11] do or make your list of what you're
[1:03:14] doing and tell me that's all you got to
[1:03:16] do find
[1:03:18] that see but the devil he pedals his
[1:03:23] ideas inside of our minds not behind the
[1:03:29] pulpit the pulpit is preaching the word
[1:03:31] the fful ministry is delivering the
[1:03:34] word it's our minds that are choosing
[1:03:38] what we're going to do and what we're
[1:03:39] not going to
[1:03:40] do are we going to surrender
[1:03:43] all are we going to give ourselves to
[1:03:46] the Lord are we going to obey him more
[1:03:48] today than we did
[1:03:50] yesterday and the thing is look we can
[1:03:52] get so we can get our conscious is so
[1:03:55] callous that God could be speaking his
[1:03:57] word to us that wouldn't bother us one
[1:04:00] bit God don't ever let me get like that
[1:04:03] make my conscience
[1:04:09] tender the bride is living by the
[1:04:12] Revelation that they must live by every
[1:04:15] word of
[1:04:16] God where the world is picking and
[1:04:20] choosing people are not recognizing the
[1:04:22] Real Enemy right in inside the
[1:04:25] church because the Devil comes a
[1:04:31] church he's the one that's trying to get
[1:04:33] us to doubt he's the one that's trying
[1:04:35] to get us to
[1:04:36] compromise he's pedling the idea it's
[1:04:39] not that necessary to do what's being
[1:04:43] preached that's a scary
[1:04:46] thing and I wonder how many times we
[1:04:48] recognize that's a devil that's not our
[1:04:50] thought Saints you're not going to think
[1:04:53] that thought
[1:04:55] God has God has birthed you to believe
[1:04:58] the word not to question the word to
[1:05:01] believe the word so when those thoughts
[1:05:03] come you got to recognize that's just
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:06] devil we've got to defeat the Devil
[1:05:09] brother Bram said it's the greatest
[1:05:10] battle ever fought right there in her
[1:05:15] mind it's nothing but
[1:05:19] iniquity when he comes to our
[1:05:22] minds and he tries to get us to
[1:05:26] compromise just a little bit that that's
[1:05:29] not that important the main thing is
[1:05:31] this I'm telling you that's iniquity
[1:05:34] from God that is that is the that's the
[1:05:37] definition of iniquity from
[1:05:40] God the same thing that Lucifer had when
[1:05:44] he said in his
[1:05:47] heart I don't really have to do
[1:05:50] that I can come in and out of God's
[1:05:53] presence without having to listen to
[1:05:55] him I go talk to the angels and just
[1:05:58] share my ideas with
[1:06:01] them people come in the church with
[1:06:03] their own ideas right they're not
[1:06:06] fearing the Lord like
[1:06:11] Lucifer I'd rather have the fear of God
[1:06:13] take away everything that I had give me
[1:06:15] the fear of God because without it we
[1:06:18] have
[1:06:19] nothing
[1:06:23] nothing Jesus said many will come to me
[1:06:25] in that
[1:06:28] day he's defiled the
[1:06:32] sanctuaries pedling his
[1:06:38] lies then I will profess to them I never
[1:06:41] knew you depart from me what ye that
[1:06:45] work iniquity how do I work iniquity
[1:06:48] very
[1:06:49] simple not doing what God asked you to
[1:06:53] do
[1:06:55] every time we come to church God speaks
[1:06:57] to
[1:07:00] us he's a good
[1:07:02] god he's a beautiful God he'll bless us
[1:07:06] He blesses me beyond
[1:07:09] all the day that I got saved that was
[1:07:12] the first day that I recognized that he
[1:07:14] blessed me more than I
[1:07:17] deserved and every day since I have not
[1:07:20] deserved the least of His blessings not
[1:07:22] a one I Haven
[1:07:30] deserved iniquity is what has caused so
[1:07:33] many problems for all of us in our
[1:07:36] lives it will tear down and weaken us
[1:07:39] just like it does the
[1:07:41] world I'm going to give you a scripture
[1:07:43] you write it down Psalms
[1:07:46] 31:10 for my life is spent with grief
[1:07:51] and my years with sighing my strength
[1:07:56] faileth because of my
[1:08:00] iniquity and my bones are
[1:08:03] consumed I mean we want more strength
[1:08:05] from the Lord we need to get serious
[1:08:07] about obeying the word of God that we're
[1:08:10] not thinking about is that
[1:08:12] important come on on to just get into
[1:08:16] this word because this is the
[1:08:18] word we've got to recognize Satan
[1:08:21] personally trying to get up to
[1:08:24] compromise with God we
[1:08:28] must we must if we don't then we're
[1:08:32] being
[1:08:33] deceived the word is the only thing that
[1:08:36] shines light the word is a is a a light
[1:08:38] to our
[1:08:39] path and and the thing that needs to be
[1:08:43] we we all agree that this word is
[1:08:45] perfect and everything we have no
[1:08:47] questions with that we believe in the
[1:08:48] prophet we believe in the ministry here
[1:08:51] but but what we're not doing enough is
[1:08:53] is questioning ourselves am I truly
[1:08:55] lining up with everything God has told
[1:08:57] me to do or have I allowed the Le to see
[1:09:00] a spirit of lukewarmness to how to get
[1:09:02] on me it's not that big a deal I'm in
[1:09:03] need of
[1:09:07] nothing can I read some
[1:09:11] quotes brother braham's uh where would
[1:09:14] we be without the prophet in this age
[1:09:16] brother Braham said UNC sound he said
[1:09:18] but sin is attractive any way you take
[1:09:21] it sin is attractive to the human being
[1:09:24] because he's a subject of the Fallen
[1:09:27] race that we are and it's attractive
[1:09:30] Satan knows how to make it attractive
[1:09:32] he's a genius at the
[1:09:35] job and if he can't get it out there in
[1:09:38] the world Affair he brings it right into
[1:09:41] the church he comes right over onto our
[1:09:44] ground that's the reason brother and
[1:09:47] sisters we should recognize him in the
[1:09:50] mark of the beaste he says there's no
[1:09:52] middle ground either the mark of the
[1:09:54] beast or the
[1:09:56] world which is the apostate church or
[1:10:00] the Seal of God he said no remember
[1:10:02] today that every person leaving this
[1:10:04] door either leaves with the mark of God
[1:10:07] or the mark of the end the apostate
[1:10:11] Church oh you say oh brother brandom I
[1:10:14] go to church he said that don't have one
[1:10:17] thing to do with it the devil goes to
[1:10:19] church he's very religious the Bible
[1:10:22] said so he said but are you born
[1:10:27] again and now he goes to describe what
[1:10:30] that means he says does your life cope
[1:10:33] with his
[1:10:35] word does your
[1:10:37] actions does your life does your
[1:10:40] dressing does your behavior does your
[1:10:43] spirit does your faith all cope with the
[1:10:45] word of
[1:10:47] God then that shows the life is in you
[1:10:52] is living is living Christ so in other
[1:10:56] words we are not a denomination that
[1:10:59] just believes yes Jesus died for me I
[1:11:01] believe God lives in me and we just go
[1:11:03] out and live any old life we want
[1:11:06] to God has sent a prophet that said he
[1:11:10] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:11:12] he proved it by the mighty works and now
[1:11:15] we believe that if we truly believe that
[1:11:18] we've got the holy ghost that God is in
[1:11:20] us that we will do the things that that
[1:11:22] word says for us to do and that's what
[1:11:25] we line our lives up with that's what we
[1:11:28] look at one another with that that
[1:11:29] doesn't mean we're not going to fall
[1:11:30] we're not going to slip we're not going
[1:11:32] to make
[1:11:33] mistakes but we can't have an attitude
[1:11:35] that it doesn't
[1:11:37] matter we can't have that we come to
[1:11:39] church with the fear of God God show me
[1:11:41] what I need to be doing more than I'm
[1:11:43] doing because that the righteous
[1:11:45] scarcely make it where were the ungodly
[1:11:48] and those that are not caring where are
[1:11:49] they going to end up tribulation there
[1:11:52] is a foolish version there's a wise
[1:11:55] version I hope I'm speaking to a
[1:11:57] students
[1:12:00] today
[1:12:02] wise don't be
[1:12:05] foolish we must recognize the devil's
[1:12:08] trying to get us to compromise with the
[1:12:10] word and defeat them defeat the
[1:12:14] Devil become how do you defeat them
[1:12:17] become one with the word that's the only
[1:12:20] way it isn't just saying
[1:12:24] amen it's your spirit your heart your
[1:12:29] whole being saying amen so be it that's
[1:12:33] what I want my my life that's what I'm
[1:12:35] going to seek after that's what I'm
[1:12:36] going to knock that's what I'm going to
[1:12:38] call on God for is to become the word in
[1:12:42] the message show us the father and it
[1:12:44] will suffice this brother Brandon said
[1:12:47] say get thee behind me Satan it is
[1:12:49] written The Works that I do shall you
[1:12:52] also
[1:12:54] that's how Jesus defeated
[1:12:57] Satan he never used his own
[1:13:01] power he was God manifested In the Flesh
[1:13:06] but he did use but he didn't use his
[1:13:08] power see all the gifts that was in
[1:13:11] heaven he had them in him but he never
[1:13:15] used them he just took the father's word
[1:13:19] and he said it is written Thou shalt
[1:13:21] Worship the Lord thy God and and uh thy
[1:13:25] God it is written it is written it is
[1:13:26] written it is written and he defeated
[1:13:29] Satan and the word of God will defeat
[1:13:32] Satan anywhere on any ground under any
[1:13:35] condition God's holy word so we want to
[1:13:39] defeat the Devil right here in our life
[1:13:41] we want to be free from we want to be
[1:13:43] delivered we want to be healed we want
[1:13:45] whatever we want just agree with the
[1:13:47] word say Amen to the word I'm becoming
[1:13:50] the word and that's where the victory
[1:13:52] comes
[1:13:54] amen tooo many people think they have
[1:13:57] the Holy Ghost and they fail to compare
[1:13:59] themselves with the word to make sure
[1:14:01] they got it don't you think look we're
[1:14:03] in the message but just let for a minute
[1:14:05] let's get out of the message and let's
[1:14:07] go to some some other churches who don't
[1:14:09] know the message don't you think those
[1:14:11] people in that church think they got the
[1:14:12] Holy Ghost
[1:14:14] too don't you think the preacher stands
[1:14:16] by the pope and says this is all you got
[1:14:18] to do and you got you got the Holy Ghost
[1:14:21] Inside of You
[1:14:24] so that means Satan can come here and do
[1:14:26] the same thing just because we're in the
[1:14:29] message that doesn't make us
[1:14:31] exempt from Satan coming and lying to
[1:14:37] us we've got to manifest the word and
[1:14:41] I'll tell you that's hard
[1:14:43] work I'm just going to be honest with
[1:14:45] you building a greenhouse is hard
[1:14:51] work doing things you've never done
[1:14:53] before before that's hard
[1:14:56] work I say living this word is hard
[1:15:01] work the thing that's so hard is you got
[1:15:04] to die out and let the holy ghost live
[1:15:06] in you that's hard because this flesh
[1:15:09] wants to control it wants to do what it
[1:15:11] wants to do it wants its own
[1:15:18] will brother baham said in the message
[1:15:21] Christ is revealed in his own word he
[1:15:23] says today people are so confused about
[1:15:27] the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so
[1:15:29] forth he said Satan can impersonate any
[1:15:33] kind of gift that God has but he cannot
[1:15:37] bring the
[1:15:39] word what does that mean cannot bring
[1:15:41] the
[1:15:42] word in other words I cannot live the
[1:15:46] word you cannot live the word only the
[1:15:50] Holy Ghost can live the word amen
[1:15:54] that's why the Bible says I can do all
[1:15:57] things through Christ who strengtheneth
[1:15:59] me it's through him that we live the
[1:16:01] word andan can impersonate any gift but
[1:16:05] he can impersonate but he cannot bring
[1:16:08] the word to manifestation in a life
[1:16:12] because he hates the word he hates
[1:16:14] Christ how can you hate something and
[1:16:17] love it at the same time to live it
[1:16:19] because you have to yield to it you have
[1:16:21] to love the word you have to yield to it
[1:16:22] to manifest
[1:16:24] it that's why you cannot serve two
[1:16:27] masters at one time you will hate the
[1:16:28] one and cleave to the
[1:16:36] other in the message I think of man's
[1:16:38] filter brother bam says no if you want
[1:16:41] the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it
[1:16:43] is when the soul of yours will line up
[1:16:48] with the word of God in every respect
[1:16:53] it shows you've been drawn your life
[1:16:56] through the thinking man's filter God's
[1:16:59] filter the
[1:17:01] word the
[1:17:03] word notice is that God's
[1:17:08] filter he said he is Washed by the Water
[1:17:11] of the word so so when we come to church
[1:17:13] and we hear the word and it the word is
[1:17:18] what washes us if we receive it if we
[1:17:21] don't it condemns us us we walk out
[1:17:24] feeling like well you know I didn't get
[1:17:27] nothing out of the
[1:17:28] service come
[1:17:30] on that's that's the two Spirits one is
[1:17:33] carnal looking at the word one is
[1:17:35] spiritual one is humble one is
[1:17:38] proud comes to church he's doing his job
[1:17:43] he's trying to get us to not be washed
[1:17:47] to not become with one with the
[1:17:52] word brother B went on to say when God
[1:17:55] gave Adam and Eve a filter in the Garden
[1:17:57] of Eden he said don't draw none of this
[1:18:01] in
[1:18:02] there but Satan punched a hole in it
[1:18:04] said oh it's a little bit it won't
[1:18:09] hurt just one drop through it's all it
[1:18:12] took to set death in the human race
[1:18:15] That's what Satan tries to get us to do
[1:18:17] he tries to get us just to pop a little
[1:18:20] hole while that's not that important you
[1:18:24] know oh that must be for somebody
[1:18:29] else this
[1:18:31] word you know I fear that I'm not
[1:18:34] following the word I fear that there's
[1:18:37] something I don't see that my eyes are
[1:18:39] blinded to that I get let my carnality
[1:18:42] take the the the front course and I'm
[1:18:44] going to miss something and I need him
[1:18:46] to shine the light of his holy spirit in
[1:18:49] my heart and let that word open up and
[1:18:51] let me see things clearly
[1:18:54] am in the message does God ever change
[1:18:57] his mind about his word he says people
[1:18:59] sometimes won't receive the holy ghosts
[1:19:01] un unless they speak in
[1:19:04] tongues now I believe in speaking in
[1:19:06] tongues
[1:19:07] certainly he's a good
[1:19:09] God he'll give you the desire of your
[1:19:13] heart but no matter how much you speak
[1:19:15] in tongues and deny this word you're
[1:19:17] wrong
[1:19:19] anyhow see you don't go in
[1:19:24] by speaking in
[1:19:25] tongues you go in by keeping the
[1:19:30] word that's the evidence of the Holy
[1:19:32] Ghost when you believe the word of God
[1:19:35] now to believe it is to live
[1:19:37] it in the message why do you say who do
[1:19:41] you say this is Brother bam says how can
[1:19:43] you shout speak in tongues and deny the
[1:19:47] word he said the evidence of the Holy
[1:19:50] Ghost is believing the word word always
[1:19:54] been every age if you can receive the
[1:19:59] word to receive the
[1:20:05] word you know what's
[1:20:07] scary Ron what's scary brother Marty is
[1:20:12] for
[1:20:13] me to think that I've received the
[1:20:16] word but I'm not living
[1:20:20] it and convinced that I've received
[1:20:26] it now what that ought to do to me is it
[1:20:30] all put me crying out to God for the
[1:20:33] power to live that word and I believe
[1:20:35] that's what God wants it's that personal
[1:20:38] relationship because think about it if
[1:20:40] we didn't really believe in the power of
[1:20:42] God to live the life then we could just
[1:20:44] have a a good Seminary you know we could
[1:20:46] have good
[1:20:47] [Laughter]
[1:20:49] teachers God help us s the message
[1:20:51] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:20:53] and the Earthly bride brother says now
[1:20:55] that's what we was talking the other day
[1:20:59] the evidence of the Holy Ghost see the
[1:21:01] evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you
[1:21:03] can receive the word the evidence of the
[1:21:05] Holy Ghost is when we can receive the
[1:21:09] word personally receive
[1:21:12] it that will destroy the works of the
[1:21:16] devil that will destroy the works of the
[1:21:18] devil in the beginning was the word the
[1:21:20] word was with God the Word was God and
[1:21:22] the Word was made flesh and what is
[1:21:24] first John 3:8 say for this purpose the
[1:21:27] Son of God was manifested that he might
[1:21:30] destroy the works of the
[1:21:33] devil now I'll tell you I want to
[1:21:37] destroy I want to destroy this nature
[1:21:39] that I was born
[1:21:41] with that's what I want destroyed I
[1:21:44] don't care about destroying anybody else
[1:21:46] I don't care about being better than
[1:21:47] anybody else I want to destroy the ugly
[1:21:49] nature that I was born with from my
[1:21:51] mother and my father I want to be
[1:21:53] birthed with the word of God that it can
[1:21:55] live through me that I can be found
[1:21:57] pleasing in the sight of God and when
[1:21:59] that time comes that hour comes when he
[1:22:01] calls us I won't be lacking I won't have
[1:22:04] weights and shuckles on me when the time
[1:22:06] of the Rapture comes he's coming for his
[1:22:10] own he ain't coming for the
[1:22:14] intellectuals he ain't coming for the
[1:22:15] foolish
[1:22:17] virgin he's coming for those who let the
[1:22:20] word be manifested it will just destroy
[1:22:23] I believe it'll defy the gravity that
[1:22:26] the devil's keeping us down with this
[1:22:29] negativity and can't seem to to muster
[1:22:32] enough energy to live the life through
[1:22:33] the weak what's going
[1:22:37] on iniquity it's it's taking our very
[1:22:42] strength away from
[1:22:44] us the joy of the Lord is our
[1:22:48] strength God gives us joy when we follow
[1:22:51] the word
[1:22:53] he
[1:22:55] does the word of God will defeat Satan
[1:22:58] anywhere on any grounds at any
[1:23:02] time the
[1:23:04] word that's when the word is living in
[1:23:09] you now whatever you're
[1:23:11] facing that word puts Satan in its
[1:23:16] place you can't put Satan in in in his
[1:23:21] place you l have to use the name of
[1:23:24] Jesus you can't use John Martin you
[1:23:27] can't use your name can't use Paul's
[1:23:31] name can't use brother braham's
[1:23:35] name it's God is the only one that can
[1:23:38] put Satan in his place in our
[1:23:42] life and we need God inside of
[1:23:47] us don't rely on just speaking the word
[1:23:51] hold yourself self accountable until
[1:23:53] you're able to live it too often we just
[1:23:56] I know I know think about all the things
[1:23:58] that we know you Brothers you and you
[1:24:00] are some humble Brothers here we've
[1:24:01] talked in our men's meeting we know so
[1:24:05] much of the word that we just haven't
[1:24:07] lived at
[1:24:09] all so we got to go beyond what we know
[1:24:12] to make sure that we're living it every
[1:24:15] day now the world is going under there's
[1:24:18] no safety outside of the word and I'm
[1:24:21] saying that word is being manifested in
[1:24:24] you because you can't literally hold on
[1:24:27] to the Bible and make it into the
[1:24:30] Rapture that that word has to be hid in
[1:24:32] your heart David says I hide Thy word in
[1:24:35] my heart that I sin not against
[1:24:38] thee it is the only thing that will
[1:24:40] clean up our lives is the word it'll
[1:24:42] clean up our homes it'll clean up our
[1:24:44] church it it'll clean up our
[1:24:45] relationships it's when the word of God
[1:24:48] is
[1:24:51] manifested God don't care how smart I am
[1:24:53] in my home he cares how much I yield my
[1:24:56] life to him in my
[1:25:00] home manifesting this word is the only
[1:25:03] thing that will break the strongholds of
[1:25:08] iniquity Paul said to Timothy
[1:25:10] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:25:12] stands sure having this seal the Lord
[1:25:14] knows them that are
[1:25:16] his there's a difference between his and
[1:25:19] those that are not his the ones that are
[1:25:21] deceived and not
[1:25:23] deceived the ones that are in light ones
[1:25:25] that are in darkness let everyone that
[1:25:27] nameth the name of Christ he's got a job
[1:25:29] to do what is it stand up and depart
[1:25:32] from
[1:25:34] iniquity don't just say I don't got
[1:25:38] any don't just say I got you know
[1:25:40] everybody's got
[1:25:45] iniquity yes we all got
[1:25:48] iniquity but are we all trying to depart
[1:25:50] from it
[1:25:53] and are we trying to depart from it by
[1:25:54] just coming to
[1:25:56] church or or just reading the Bible a
[1:25:59] little bit you dep you depart from it by
[1:26:02] actually
[1:26:03] departing you're going to get in your
[1:26:05] car and you're going to depart from this
[1:26:07] church you're not going to think about
[1:26:09] it you're not going to sit there and
[1:26:10] read about leaving the church you're not
[1:26:13] going to sit and talk about it to your
[1:26:14] husband to your wife about leaving the
[1:26:16] church you're actually going to get in
[1:26:17] the vehicle and you're going to leave
[1:26:19] and that's how you depart from iniquity
[1:26:21] you leave it amen you leave it leave it
[1:26:23] at the
[1:26:26] altar God's calling us to clean up our
[1:26:30] lives while the world is abounding in
[1:26:33] iniquity the bride is departing from it
[1:26:37] supernaturally
[1:26:40] amen while worldly church members are
[1:26:43] using excuses that they don't have to do
[1:26:45] all of God's will the rde is truly
[1:26:50] manifesting that word that comes in a
[1:26:53] still Small Voice to their hearts it's
[1:26:58] real James chapter 3 are you are you
[1:27:00] with
[1:27:04] me the others are you going to get with
[1:27:07] me James chapter
[1:27:10] 3:6 and the
[1:27:12] tongue the tongue is a
[1:27:17] fire what else is it a world of iniquity
[1:27:23] so is the tongue among our
[1:27:26] members that it defiles the whole body
[1:27:29] did you ever say something negative to
[1:27:31] somebody and just you know as soon as
[1:27:33] you said it you just felt oh
[1:27:38] my it it just it just it defiles you and
[1:27:42] those that are listening that it
[1:27:43] defileth the whole body and sth on fire
[1:27:47] the course of nature the very nature we
[1:27:50] were born with the nature of iniquity
[1:27:53] and is set on fire of
[1:27:57] hell what is that that's no
[1:28:00] control do what you want to do you're
[1:28:03] always right you'll prove it you'll
[1:28:06] prove
[1:28:09] it you you'll just stop talking to
[1:28:12] somebody you're GNA prove it you're
[1:28:15] going to be mean you're going to be
[1:28:19] upset set on course
[1:28:24] or Hell a fire a fire of
[1:28:29] hell I don't want to lack the fear of
[1:28:32] God the world is Satan's self-will
[1:28:37] program everything is operating through
[1:28:39] the nature of
[1:28:42] self-will 1 John chapter 2:6 if you want
[1:28:45] to write it down says for all that is in
[1:28:47] the
[1:28:48] world speaking of the world now trying
[1:28:51] to Define find it it's the lust of the
[1:28:54] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of
[1:28:58] life is not of the father but is of the
[1:29:05] world the world is not out
[1:29:10] there the world is Desiring anything
[1:29:13] that isn't of
[1:29:16] God and our nature we were born with a
[1:29:19] nature to just want our
[1:29:24] and he's calling it The lust of the
[1:29:25] flesh the the lust of the eyes and the
[1:29:27] pride of
[1:29:28] life and he says in verse 17 the world
[1:29:31] passeth away and the lust thereof but
[1:29:34] but what but he that doeth the will of
[1:29:36] God abideth forever so you see you've
[1:29:38] got the will of man and you got the will
[1:29:41] of
[1:29:42] God the world is not out there the world
[1:29:45] we're fighting is right inside here just
[1:29:47] read James I believe uh chapter 4 the
[1:29:51] first first part of it tells about that
[1:29:53] war
[1:29:54] inside Paul talks about it in Romans
[1:29:56] chapter
[1:29:58] 7 it's a real war and to act like we
[1:30:02] don't have to worry about self-will is
[1:30:05] being filled with
[1:30:07] pride is being so full of Pride that you
[1:30:10] don't want to take a look and look the
[1:30:13] only way that we're ever going to win
[1:30:16] the only way we're going to overcome is
[1:30:18] when we humble ourselves to be honest to
[1:30:20] take a look at our will because you know
[1:30:23] we spend so much energy trying to prove
[1:30:26] one another is
[1:30:30] wrong right but how many times have you
[1:30:33] gone up to somebody and say sister
[1:30:35] brother would you help me to see what
[1:30:38] I'm doing wrong would you help
[1:30:41] me we're so full of they're wrong that's
[1:30:44] wrong he's
[1:30:46] wrong what is that God didn't make you
[1:30:50] that
[1:30:52] the word is telling us that we need to
[1:30:55] check our hearts amen check our motives
[1:30:58] you know brother Ram said that quite a
[1:30:59] bit check your motive check your
[1:31:02] objective well it's real easy I checked
[1:31:04] it my motive is good you know what
[1:31:06] you're so full of
[1:31:07] Pride you don't even know your own heart
[1:31:10] it's very deceptive it takes God to show
[1:31:12] you you got to really break down in
[1:31:14] tears and say God I really want to know
[1:31:16] if there's something evil inside of
[1:31:19] me you know we're not going to just you
[1:31:22] know sail in in the Rapture sorry we're
[1:31:25] not we're not believing that that's not
[1:31:27] how the prophet taught
[1:31:30] it I do believe you know you know here's
[1:31:32] the thing you know the prophet said that
[1:31:35] we shouldn't preach on predestination
[1:31:37] right he says it's
[1:31:39] dangerous the devil gets a hold of that
[1:31:42] and he twists it around to make us feel
[1:31:44] so predestinated that we don't got to do
[1:31:46] anything to line up with the
[1:31:49] word and that's what he does he oh
[1:31:51] that's that doesn't matter this doesn't
[1:31:53] matter God understands before you know
[1:31:55] it you know who's running the show you
[1:31:57] are that's
[1:32:01] iniquity your will is not God's will
[1:32:05] God's will is God's will your will is
[1:32:08] still your will his thoughts are higher
[1:32:10] than your thoughts his way is higher
[1:32:14] than your
[1:32:15] ways we have to subject oursel to the
[1:32:18] word that's the only way we
[1:32:20] know
[1:32:22] don't just focus
[1:32:25] on two or three things that he's spoken
[1:32:27] to
[1:32:29] you and put your whole life on
[1:32:37] that
[1:32:38] imagine imagine if all I thing I did was
[1:32:41] focus on one thing God speaking to me
[1:32:45] and say you're going to have a a
[1:32:47] business right over there when it was
[1:32:49] just a
[1:32:50] field what if I just spent my whole life
[1:32:53] focusing on that God said I'm going to
[1:32:55] have a business I'm going to business
[1:32:56] I'm going to build an Empire
[1:33:00] here he spoke to
[1:33:04] me man shall live by every word of God
[1:33:07] I've got to focus on the whole
[1:33:10] word that's what's
[1:33:20] important
[1:33:23] all right how many want to
[1:33:26] overcome we overcome by obeying the word
[1:33:30] of God which is his will and we'll be
[1:33:32] blessed John
[1:33:34] 16:33 we're just going to we're going to
[1:33:36] try to spend a few minutes on this and I
[1:33:38] pray that those of you that are wanting
[1:33:40] it to be over now will bear with me cuz
[1:33:45] really be honest with you The Best Is
[1:33:47] Yet To Come amen The Best Is Yet To Come
[1:33:53] all right John 16:33 these things I have
[1:33:56] spoken unto you that you might have
[1:33:58] peace that in me you might have peace in
[1:34:00] the world you shall have tribulation but
[1:34:02] be of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:34:07] world in order to
[1:34:10] overcome you have to have a
[1:34:13] battle now Jesus said he overcome the
[1:34:17] world he didn't blow up the world he
[1:34:20] didn't new it he didn't kill all the bad
[1:34:25] people so what is he talking about he's
[1:34:27] talking about
[1:34:30] self-will he overcame self-will do you
[1:34:32] believe that Luke 22:40 says and when
[1:34:35] Jesus had entered into the mountain now
[1:34:37] he said pray that she enter not into
[1:34:40] temptation the Temptation was not to
[1:34:42] fall
[1:34:43] asleep you know we may come on prayer
[1:34:45] meet and just say well if I can make it
[1:34:48] through an hour prayer the Temptation
[1:34:51] was now not to fall asleep the
[1:34:53] Temptation was not to cut some guy's ear
[1:34:56] off the Temptation was
[1:35:00] self-will don't enter into
[1:35:04] self-will and he was withdrawn from them
[1:35:07] about a Stones cast and he kneeled down
[1:35:09] and prayed saying father if thou be
[1:35:13] willing remove this cup from me you see
[1:35:17] self-will there
[1:35:19] self-will father if thou be willing
[1:35:22] remove this cup from me nevertheless not
[1:35:26] my will but thine be done he overcame
[1:35:30] self-will and when you can say from the
[1:35:33] bottom of your heart Lord not my will
[1:35:35] but thine be done and you mean it from
[1:35:37] the bottom of your heart you are
[1:35:39] overcoming Satan in your
[1:35:45] life be of good cheer I have overcome
[1:35:49] the world Jesus overcame
[1:35:51] self-will the Bible says he learned
[1:35:54] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:35:57] he surrendered his self-will he humbled
[1:36:00] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:36:03] even the death of the Cross he
[1:36:06] manifested the father's word and I'll
[1:36:09] just say it like this and we can
[1:36:12] too we can
[1:36:15] too we do it through Christ the Bible
[1:36:17] says we have a high priest that can be
[1:36:19] touched with the feelings of our
[1:36:21] infirmities that's our our feebleness
[1:36:24] our our sickness in our body or our mind
[1:36:27] our our moral Frailty but was in all
[1:36:30] points tempted just like we are yet
[1:36:33] without sin be of good cheer for I have
[1:36:36] overcome the world and if I'm living in
[1:36:39] you you can be happy about it you can be
[1:36:42] happy you can be an overcomer you can
[1:36:43] tell Satan I am going to listen to the
[1:36:46] word of God and I'm going to love every
[1:36:48] word of God and I'm going to follow
[1:36:49] every word of God I'm going to put more
[1:36:51] energy into doing the word of
[1:36:54] God you don't have to sit there and be a
[1:36:56] slave to the devil
[1:36:58] anymore fill me with the Holy Ghost Lord
[1:37:02] that I might overcome my self-will I
[1:37:05] don't want to be a part of Satan's
[1:37:07] self-willed program anymore I know I was
[1:37:10] birthed into it but I've been born again
[1:37:13] I've been birthed into the word and that
[1:37:17] word is what destroys the works of the
[1:37:18] devil in my life I'm an
[1:37:22] overcomer two last scriptures that I
[1:37:25] want to read in Revelations Revelations
[1:37:28] 3:20 behold I stand at the
[1:37:31] door and I
[1:37:33] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:37:36] the door I will come into him and will s
[1:37:39] with him and he with me we're obviously
[1:37:42] dealing with self-will
[1:37:45] here that's what we're dealing with God
[1:37:48] is not going to break the door down of
[1:37:51] your
[1:37:52] will we have to open that door of
[1:37:54] Silence we have to let God come in yes
[1:37:58] but I'll just say like this you've got
[1:38:01] to let the will of God come in too many
[1:38:04] people say I let Jesus in my heart but
[1:38:07] they haven't let the will of Jesus in
[1:38:09] their
[1:38:11] heart he's standing at the door and
[1:38:14] wanting his will to come in you've got
[1:38:17] to open and say God I want your will I
[1:38:20] don't want just
[1:38:22] you carnally I want your will that means
[1:38:25] you really want all of God not just the
[1:38:28] D boy
[1:38:32] right we've got to let the will of Jesus
[1:38:36] in our hearts and if we do that then
[1:38:39] we've got the
[1:38:41] Overcomer how many people do you see
[1:38:43] that says yeah I got Jesus in my heart
[1:38:44] but they can't seem to
[1:38:48] overcome because I don't I don't believe
[1:38:50] they've let the the will of Jesus in
[1:38:52] their
[1:38:53] heart because when he not withhold
[1:38:56] anything from them that obey him nothing
[1:38:59] you can overcome all things
[1:39:02] right now I tell you the the thing that
[1:39:04] we need to focus on is our nature how we
[1:39:07] act when we're not in
[1:39:10] church how we act when we're by
[1:39:13] ourselves listening to the radio
[1:39:15] watching TV or in our homes talking to
[1:39:17] our spouses or our kids I'll say it like
[1:39:20] this or the thoughts that we're thinking
[1:39:21] when we're laying on our
[1:39:23] bed come on we got to overcome those
[1:39:29] things now to him that overcometh why
[1:39:32] Grant to sit with me on my throne even
[1:39:34] as I also overcame and sat down with my
[1:39:36] father in his
[1:39:40] throne be of good
[1:39:42] cheer he that have an ear let him hear
[1:39:45] with the spirit is saying to the church
[1:39:47] we have to overcome our will yeah
[1:39:51] I'll say it like this to me now I'm just
[1:39:53] being honest I'm not pointing any
[1:39:55] fingers to me I haven't overcome
[1:40:03] it every day I get up you know what I
[1:40:06] gotta do brother Ron I gotta kill that
[1:40:08] old
[1:40:09] man I don't like it when my children
[1:40:11] call me old
[1:40:14] man but what can I say the Bible calls
[1:40:16] me an old
[1:40:17] man kill the old
[1:40:19] man
[1:40:22] they don't call me old
[1:40:23] man but I am an old
[1:40:26] man all right last scripture in
[1:40:27] Revelations chap 12 verse number seven
[1:40:30] where we started out
[1:40:32] with and there was war in heaven Michael
[1:40:35] and the archangels fought against the
[1:40:37] dragon and the dragon fought against his
[1:40:39] angels and prevailed not neither was
[1:40:40] there Place found anymore in
[1:40:46] heaven
[1:40:49] now where is God dwelling right
[1:40:52] now in our
[1:40:58] hearts so just like he allowed it for a
[1:41:02] season there needs to be a battle to get
[1:41:06] rid of him in our
[1:41:08] heart remember the word that fell on the
[1:41:13] ground that had
[1:41:15] Thorns so that heart already had a
[1:41:20] desire for
[1:41:22] self-will the Bible says the the the the
[1:41:25] world the things of the world the cares
[1:41:26] of
[1:41:28] life and when he received the word he
[1:41:32] rejoiced yes praise God I love the word
[1:41:36] but because there was two things
[1:41:38] happening in his
[1:41:41] heart God will not bow to the
[1:41:45] devil he just steps out the word or the
[1:41:49] world desire desires of self-will choked
[1:41:53] out the
[1:41:55] word so there's a battle going on right
[1:41:57] now in every one of us whether we see it
[1:41:59] or not recognize it or
[1:42:01] not and we've got to take the word of
[1:42:04] God and defeat
[1:42:07] Satan and that great Dragon was cast out
[1:42:10] the old serpent called the devil and
[1:42:11] Satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[1:42:13] was cast out and his angels were cast
[1:42:15] out with him and I heard a loud voice
[1:42:18] saying in heaven now has come salvation
[1:42:20] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:42:22] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[1:42:24] of the Brethren he's cast down which
[1:42:26] accuse them before our God day and
[1:42:31] night if you find somebody that's always
[1:42:33] saying something negative about
[1:42:36] somebody that inspiration come from God
[1:42:41] right and they overcame him last verse
[1:42:44] in the whole service today and they
[1:42:47] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:42:52] by the word of their
[1:42:54] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:42:58] unto
[1:42:59] death they got rid of the iniquity they
[1:43:02] departed from
[1:43:04] iniquity we can't we can't go through
