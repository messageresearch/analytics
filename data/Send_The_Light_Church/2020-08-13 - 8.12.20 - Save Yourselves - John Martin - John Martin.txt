something that's a worth that will bless your heart i'm kind of more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have required you search much deeper within through the way things appear you're looking into my heart i'm coming back a heart of worship and it's all about you it's all about you jesus i'm sorry lord for the things i've made it and it's all about you it's all about you jesus king of everless worth no one can't express how much you deserve though i'm weak and poor all i have is yours every single breath i'll give you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have

all about you jesus amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah leave that up brother amanda if we could just all as a congregation sing that a few sisters could lead us in that because it is all about him should never be about us about a feeling that we get right when we sing you know sure you get a good feeling it makes you feel good but it's really about him amen i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you and it's all about you jesus i'm sorry lord for the things i've made it when it's all about you it's all about you jesus amen hallelujah amen sometimes you know you think of that and sometimes it's so often it's all about us and you know it's the wrong spirit it is all about him amen let's just stand as we get ready to change the order service and let's just sing pleasing amen please let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you pray let everything i pursue be pleasing oh lord on to you [Music] pleasing let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you praying let everything i pursue be pleased to you one more time let's just close our eyes to him please let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you praise let everything i pursue be pleasing oh lord amen is that your prayer amen let's let's go before the lord in prayer heavenly father we thank you for your presence here we don't see the angels and we don't see you physically but your word declares that you're here and you're here inside your people and we feel it one with another we thank you for your presence today lord we know there's been many times many times in my life that i haven't been pleasing come short of your glory come short of pleasing you and we ask lord if there's any of those times that you haven't forgiven us that you haven't taken the blood and just washed us we asked at this moment you would do that because lord it is our desire to be pleasing to you in everything that we seek after and everything that we do and god we ask today that you would come in the ministry of your word lord that thy word would become so plain to us so clear so directional that we would know lord that it's you speaking we ask that you would anoint not only our lips and our mind but you would anoint our ears lord that we may receive the engrafted word today lord we ask that you remember the needs that would be in our lives lord the prayers that have been in our heart through the day and before the service lord asking that you would intervene and uh and lord that you would move into behalf of those needs as well for your god that can do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think lord we commit this service in your hands we commit lord the ministry of your word into your hands lord take these lips of clay and lord just use them and i humbly pray that you give each and every one of us revelation and we'll give you the praise for these things lord in jesus name we ask amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of acts chapter 2 what um provoked the service today is we had a brother approach us last service um about wanting to be baptized and there's uh on a a few others in the church that need to be baptized and but this service i want to make it real clear is for everybody in here so that's i'm just letting you know where where it started from and we want to go through uh some scriptures here that talk uh that guide us into baptism it's something that we want to walk forward in amen amen starting in acts chapter 2 and num and verse number 37 the question was asked how do we be saved now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brother what shall we do and then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this onto a generation and then they that gladly received the word were baptized the same day were added unto them about 3 000 souls and they commune steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in the breaking of the bread and in prayers amen god bless you may be seated i'm sorry i did not get a request in before service but if we could remember to continue to pray for brother daryl ward and then also for brother donnie reagan and his family they have also caught the culvert and there there is a very great need with his daughter and that the family there and if we could just remember brother donnie the church and his his his daughter and their her family um they've stopped having services um nothing live streaming or anything and so i know they're they're going we've heard they're going through some trials so if we could remember to pray for our precious brother amen um we want to entitle this message save yourselves save yourselves and for a subject playing your part we have a part to play with with salvation so god does not cast a magic wand over and decide who he's going to save and who he's not going to save it isn't god uh making all the choices you've got to save yourself i mean this is what the scripture said with many other words that he testify exhorting saying save yourselves many other words they testify and exhort saying save your cells so somewhere down the line we have a part to play in salvation amen and it was an on toward generation at that time and that means warped or perverse or or crooked world and today it is worse than ever amen and we need to save ourselves today we don't want to wait around waiting for somebody else to save us we've got to take charge of it just like your health we've heard that you don't want to put your health in some doctor's hands who's taking care of a lot of patients who doesn't got a lot of time and you can't give you the the the personal private attention that you need all the time and so you must take your health into your hands it's true the doctor just can't give you enough time to take care of what your needs are you need to go see another doctor you need to get some you need to get a second opinion sometimes you you need to see a specialist and so you need to take your health into your own hands brother says if you're not going to listen to the doctor don't go right right so i say it's the same way with your salvation right amen that's why brother bran was so it was so important to get the point across that we need when we're choosing a church we we can't choose a church just like we would choose what we'd want to choose for our life can i word it like that so i don't work the other way you know what i'm trying to say so we we because the church that is what leads our soul in the direction that god wants it to be and there's so many churches out there that leaden have so many mixed motives and to find we know that jesus he's interested in our soul amen he has no ulterior motives amen he's not wanting to mix anything in with it right but when churches are worried about other things and we want a church that puts not just the priority but but only our our character and our soul being built to the place that we can make a rapture that's all that matters everything else is going to be vain amen so don't let anybody tell you that you don't have anything to do with salvation if you think that so much this predestination so much you won't lift a finger to do anything for you to help yourself the bible says save yourselves for brother john i was always told that i was saved by the grace of god let's go to the scriptures ephesians chapter 2 verse 7. we want to make sure we got a right balance in the sermon ephesians chapter 2 verse 7 that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus how many has felt the kindness of the lord jesus amen for by grace are you saved it's through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god amen not of works lest any man should most for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus on two good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them that's right so it is god's grace that saves us amen and we are his workmanship he's in control but if we don't have anything to do with it then all he's got is a bunch of robots for a relationship with us you cannot save yourself without god right and god cannot save you without yourself you play a part god plays a part amen i want to talk about god's part god recognizes you he recognized you when you are horribly selfish a sinner didn't care about god you were hell bound and there was nothing that you could do to even help yourself because you were blind to your condition amen you thought you were pretty good you didn't need any help thank you but then jesus he come knocking on the door amen and he helped you to see your condition he declared on to you that he was the only way to eternal life there was no other way to make it and the thing is you didn't have one thing to do when god came to you he chose to meet you he chose to knock on your heart amen so that is grace that is grace [Music] he went to the cross before you were even born right amen to pay the price that you would have a chance to receive eternal life to have your sins washed away amen that is the grace of god that's why it's not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works you can't even you can't attain to some sort of merit of having it through doing anything it is truly the grace of god you couldn't earn god's goodness or his favor amen amen isn't even aware of god until god begins to deal with your heart now you that have just been coming to the church not for very long and something is beginning to take place in your heart i just want to make this real clear that is god when we need to to recognize that this is god this is the way that god deals with us how he speaks to our heart in john chapter 6 verse 44 the bible says jesus said no man can come to me except the father which have sent me draw him and i will raise them up the last day so we can't even come to god unless he draws us first so he begins to speak to our heart he he he puts a little tug in there a little nudge in there and and we we get our attention we begin to listen a little bit more at church and that is god drawing us to heal amen verse 65 the same chapter and then he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except that we're given unto him of my father so god's grace this is his part he draws us to him amen and and we we can't be saved without that part but we need to respond to that part so we don't do the choosing god chooses us amen it is his grace alone that chooses us it is not of ourselves it is the gift of god right god is the great master builder he's orchestrating this whole thing amen before i i knew god before i knew brother bruce i was doing my thing but god knew today would happen amen many years afterwards he's the master build he's he's he's got a big plan involved he says i know i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace to give you an expected in to finish the work that he started he's building a church inside of each one of us ephesians chapter 2 verse 7 says that in the ages to come that's these ages this is this age 2020 here at sun delight he might show the exceeding riches of his his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus his grace is amongst us praise god his kindness is amongst us god has showed his kindness to us he has saved us through jesus christ acts chapter 4 verse 12 says neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved amen praise the lord praise the lord this is the part that god plays where you don't have one thing to do about this choice he knocks on your heart or you might got invited to church you might have got invited to to to to to to some bible study to to do some reading but it really it was god who is orchestrating you to be introduced to him amen amen see see god god can just speak to you when you're sleeping when you're laying down he can he you can sit there and look at the mountains look at the the waves and and begin to think about god that god chose the foolishness of preaching god chose man to bring the gospel because man brought the gospel to me and that's how it works isn't that beautiful i mean it it took humans to bring forth our children took a union to bring four children and when god unites in your heart as brother bran says if if god lights your candle yes you're obligated to go like somebody else's now just because he chose you chose to love you while you were yet a sinner that doesn't mean you're automatically saved no sir you have a part to play in the salvation army amen and if you don't play your part you won't be saved amen and that's why peter said save yourselves play your part we've got a part to play to save ourself as soon as you feel or you recognize the tug in your heart you've got to respond back and do something you cannot sit there you cannot just do nothing about it right you've got to do something about you can't ignore it that is god tugging on you he put that there he's calling you he's dealing with you amen now the first thing you have to do when you feel that to save yourself is you have to believe amen you have to believe that this is not just me or my thoughts this is just you know some feeling this is just something uh the teacher's teaching me no you've got to believe that this is god dealing with you inside he that cometh to god must first believe you've got to believe it's god it starts with believing and then we've got to believe the gospel from cover to cover amen i believe hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 says but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen believe what he's speaking to your heart now what he's speaking on your heart is not what he's speaking on everybody else's heart right because god's dealing with us with issues and things in our life he knows what we need amen the same word can be preached over the pulpit and dealt with all of our hearts just slightly differently first thing we have to do to save ourselves is believe we don't have to understand the gospel we don't have to memorize the gospel we don't have to quote it recite it we just have to believe it amen say amen to the word of god it's for me i i receive that word amen when god draws a man to be saved the man must come to the understanding that he is lost without him that's the first thing that's got to happen amen the lord creates the reality we're born in shape and and we think we're something every man's right in his own eyes comparing yourself with others that are worse to make you feel better but god has to take the blindness off of us open our eyes to the light the light not that not that just jesus is the truth not just that so we can sit in church and say yes jesus is the truth but we've got to come to the light of how dark we are how evil we are how wrong we are amen i yes we've got the wrong birth yes we were born in sin shape and iniquity that happened to me and i didn't think i was a bad person for the longest time in my life my parents told me i was a nice kid the neighbors the relatives my cousins my grandma called me a snake in the grass because i was growing marijuana under her nose with her plants under the lamp but other than that most of people thought i was pretty decent you know she was just one out of many she was more accurate than the rest of them we've got to come to the understanding of our awful condition amen amen every man and woman is born with an evil nature amen romans chapter 1 verse 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men the wrath of god no one is going to be saved without being born again amen that's just not going to happen romans chapter 3 verse 10 as it is written there is none righteous no not one amen there is none that understands there is none that seeketh after god i wasn't seeking after god when i was asked to go to church i thought i didn't want to go right i did it it was boring i i didn't feel close i didn't see god and i saw a church full of hypocrites because i was there with a judgmental attitude see like why would they ask me to go and do something when they're not doing it there is none that seeketh after god they're all gone out of the way they are all together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one amen that's where god has to bring every sinner to that place to recognize this otherwise he doesn't know what to repent of right i i can't repent for you you cannot repent for me so i've got to see my sin you've got to see your sin right amen i can't save you and you can't save me we've got to save ourselves [Applause] when god calls a man to be saved the man must come to the understanding that he's a sinner so he can repent of his sinful condition we've got to believe jesus is calling us to repentance that's the call right because it's the first step now there's we know that jesus told us many parables and things in the bible where people try to get into heaven another way right amen without repentance and works don't save you we need to repent of our sins jesus said in john 8 24 for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins now he was talking to the most religious people that day amen and what about us right i know i was i think i was talking to brother stan brother stan so good to see you today in the house of the lord he's talking do we do we have time to put up a picture this is brother stan we were loading the wood today for the new church praise god brother stan's i want to give him a hand clap for all he's doing for the lord [Applause] yeah he didn't know i took that picture [Laughter] and i don't know where i was before i started talking about that but we before we came to the lord we were not monks and priests that's what was that's why i thought he we brother brother uh stan said well it'd be hard to be a monk today and i said i don't really believe god has called us to be monks i think that is a man-made effort god wants us to be out there living the life with other people so they can see christ jesus was god manifested in the flesh saint john chapter 14 verse 6 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me we have to come through jesus jesus paid the price for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in should not perish but have a everlasting life god showed us his amazing grace at calvary now it's up to us to do our part to accept that grace and to follow what jesus told us to do you cannot sit around what is laodicean doing sitting around they're not on fire they're lukewarm we've got to believe as the scriptures teach us to believe in other words our belief can't be of any private interpretation well this is what i think do not say this is what i think i want to find out what the scriptures got to say about it because it's got to line up with the gospel amen we can't just believe with a mental faith and intellectual faith we've it's it's not a book of knowledge and facts it's the word of life amen and and we've got to believe it with our heart james chapter 2 verse 19. how many believes that there's only one god let me see your hands i want you to understand you believe as much as the devil believes today now believe is that there is one god thou doest well right the devils also believe and they tremble right because there's a they know there's a realness to god but will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead yes so you know we see the point that we're not saved by works of all works but us responding to the call of god you can't just say i believe and do nothing and sit there you've got to respond with works amen if you say that you're a believer but your life has no works then your faith or your belief is dead it's considered all in vain and you should bury it james chapter 2 verse 26 for as the body without the spirit is dead so your faith without works is dead also verse 18 james said i will show thee my faith by my works yes praise the lord r got to work out our own salvation amen we've got to save ourselves we show our faith in the gospel by following through what god requires of us to save ourselves there would be no reason for me to ever get baptized if i don't repent there'd be no reason for me to ever go and seek the holy ghost if i haven't repented god just won't do that [Music] so we we we've got to put the right steps first repent or perish that's a choice we've got to make that choice we can't sit there and not make the choice joshua chapter 24 verse 15. and if it seems evil unto you think about this personally you that battle jumping in wherever you're at on the spectrum that you are with the lord it doesn't matter how long you've been serving the lord here if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve every time god comes every every time god presents to us the word he's expecting us to make a choice either serve that word that he gave us or if it seemed evil in your sight or not necessary come on amen choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods of you which your father served and i know the gods that my father served i mean they are don't say it john we all we all know about your dad which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord now this is the choice that we make praise god to save ourselves right amen we've got to serve the lord in our homes we've got to serve the lord with our lives it isn't we serve the lord at church the church is where we we get the word we take this word and we take it home when you choose to repent from serving the gods of this world you're choosing to save yourself you're choosing to follow jesus christ the truth the way the life now we can't say we believe and never repent you've got to repent romans chapter 10 verse 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved amen you got to call in the name of the lord there's your part to play to save yourself is call on the lord that you can't do that if he never called you there was a time in my life that i was doing everything that you can imagine and i was still going to a denominational church it was just the thing to do you just go to church it was church time you went to church that was it but when god began to knock on my heart said you're going to hell if you don't get saved right that was that real to me amen and i had to make a choice amen and i began to call on the name of the lord and you can do it without your voice you can do it without a church altar right now but you need to do it amen you need to call on the lord amen if you don't call in the name of the lord he ain't going to come he's a gentleman he'll let you sit there all your life yes right right right inside of a church we've heard so many stories about it we've got to save ourselves second corinthians chapter 5 verse 10 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive of the things done in his body according to what you have done whether it be good or bad verse 11 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade you amen we persuade you and as though god did beseech you by us i pray you in christ stead be reconciled to god now this is what god is calling every one of us to do is to be reconciled well brother john man i repent i got baptized so long ago are you telling me that you're perfected then there is some reconciling to do with your savior with your husband amen that's why this message is for everybody save yourselves from this entre generation repent and be reconciled but we don't want to stop with repentance we want to move on to baptism that's the next step right repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of sins it is a part of obedience baptism is a part of obedience to save yourself your faith in god will always lead you to obeying more of the gospel right amen if you have true faith it will always lead you to obey more you know really backsliding is not moving forward in the sight of god it is eventually you will be going backwards and you want the thing about it is you'll never know it right you'll never know it until it's too late all of a sudden you're saying well i haven't had joy in so long why it was so hard for me to forgive that person how come i just wasn't patient with him where did all the fruits go and we didn't even realize it jesus said in mark 16 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not right shall be damned we have to move forward amen we have to save ourselves nobody's going to baptize us let me just say something here if you think god would put his trust in all the human race that they would all baptize their children in order to be saved god wouldn't do something so foolish as that you've got to save yourself not your parents [Music] our parents can't baptize us the priest can't baptize us the pastor can't baptize a child he doesn't even know how to believe doesn't even know about his sins i remember one time james forgive me for talking about this one time we went to savannah and we had two condos and the kids stayed in one we stayed in the other and uh well some of the kids stayed with us we couldn't fit them all in one condo you know and uh so somebody got into the donuts and no one was confessing to who bit the donut and so he took that donut brother she like donuts are here they took that donut and they had everybody take a bite of a donut so i could remember and even after proving who bit the donut there still was no confession [Music] you have to confess you have to confess you can't move forward amen i'm a sinner amen i want to be saved amen you know there i am in no wise any better than any one person in this church at this moment i'm a sinner saved by grace i'm not saved yet repent be baptized the promise is unto you amen amen now i'll just talk about baptism for a moment there are two baptisms that we read about in our opening scripture the first is water baptism and the second is spiritual baptism both are required of the believer amen to water baptism is the part that you play to save yourself water baptism is not some church ritual it is the beginning of you working out your salvation with fear and trembling after you repent you need to get baptized water baptism is one of the keys that peter gave us on the day of pentecost he later explained in his letter of first peter chapter 3 when once the long-suffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was preparing were in few that his eight souls were saved by water now verse 21 of first peter chapter 3 says the light figure where unto even baptism does also now save us save yourself not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscious towards god by the resurrection of jesus christ water baptism doesn't put away the filth of our flesh only the blood of calvary can do that amen the holy spirit is the only thing that can purge us and take away our sin and sanctify us it's through calvary where the sacrifice of your your personal sins were paid your sins were paid there not just everybody else's and to know that yours were paid there that's awesome jesus died for you he died to take your sins and put them in the sea of god's forgetfulness amen now this process of sanctification can take a long time it it all depends on how honestly how serious you are with god amen you've got to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling and i'll say it like this the more fear and trembling you have the quicker you're going to get it [Music] and the more you think well i've repented i got baptized i'm here i'm just going to i do this and i do that then if there's no fear if there's no trembling when you come into god's house how can god deal with you we come here to find out what we're out with god but if you don't have that fear that reverend said lord i just want to be pleasing to you [Music] water baptism is the answer that we're looking for in our heart to be right with god it's an outward expression that you do in front of everybody that really expresses an inward work of faith in your heart something is happening here i want to express it out here and it's when a baptism is something that can help you look back to it any time in your walk with the lord when the when the enemy would try to come and hit you over the head and beat you up and and tell you you really aren't a christian you just look back and i made a decision there and i repented and got baptized in the name of jesus christ and i'm moving forward it's a it's where you took a turn in your life you turned around acts chapter 2 verse 37 now when the men heard the gospel preached they were pricked in their hearts and they said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do to be saved yes peter is saying if you really want to be if you really want to save your souls from going to hell then you need to repent amen you need to get baptized every single one of you i don't care how religious you are nicodemus unless you're born again you're not going to make it amen amen and we get baptized we repent and get baptized for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost jesus said in revelations chapter 1 verse 18 he says i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death but jesus placed those keys in peter's heart on the day of pentecost matthew chapter 16 verse 17 and jesus answered and said unto peter blessed art thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on her shall be loosed in heaven right amen and peter took the keys that god gave him the inspiration came at that moment i don't think he had it when he went into the upper room but inspiration hit him and when the time came and somebody wanted to know what to do to be saved peter was right there saying what you need to do is repent of your sins get baptized in the name of jesus christ the titles won't work and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost we must be baptized in the name of jesus christ amen there's no other name given among men whereby we must be saved amen amen that's right acts chapter 2 verse 39 the promise of the second baptism we talked about the first the water baptism and now the second baptism for the promise of the holy spirit which is god living inside of you yes amen promise is unto you and to your children the whole family amen and and to all that are false even as many as the lord our god shall call now we got a lot better chance of our loved ones feeling the call if we're living the life that the more that jesus can shine out of you the more people are going to be thinking about jesus the more you keep them kind of tucked inside in a ziploc in the tupperware the more they're going to see you amen i know you if you're like me at your very best it's all vanity right amen john chapter 7 verse 37 in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink amen and he that believeth on me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water this is this is the promise of the holy spirit just bubbling out enjoy unspeakable and full of glory this spake he of the spirit which they that believe they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus was not yet glorified yes but the holy ghost has been given amen the holy ghost is here amen and we can have as much as we can believe for no matter how many times we've been filled he wants to to to give us some more holy ghost amen he has more force it does often take some crucifying of the flesh [Music] god doesn't want to share his holy spirit with the other spirit right he wants to fill your flesh but he doesn't want that other nature there acts chapter 3 verse number 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation amen we need many other words in fact we need all the word amen we need all the words written in here amen jesus said in matthew chapter 4 verse 4 he's talking to the devil if he's talking to the devil how much more it would be for us it is written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen we need every word of god especially this hour this wicked hour that we're living in it's horrible you can't watch the news without feeling yucky there's no hope in the world second timothy chapter 3 verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall worse shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and been assured of knowing of whom those learned them and that from a child that has known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by the inspiration of god and it is profitable for doctrine reproof correction instruction of righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works yes every time we come to church we should have a heart to be working out our salvation with fear and trembling amen amen i don't mean to be belittling anybody's strong walk with the lord i don't mean that and one slightest of my thoughts but i do feel that god always has something more for us a lot of times we miss it we miss it because we're battling in our minds something that we're hearing that we don't think we should have to do and pretty soon we get stuck over here something that happened a month ago and we're wondering why we can't get anything out of we got to go back amen it's important to what god speaks to you is important can you imagine talking to your children about something that's really important to you and there's you're like yeah i believe when god speaks it's important amen who am i to say it's not that important it's important i'd like to show a little video about the importance of keeping yourself in the bible reading the bible the scriptures given to us that we can be perfect be what god wants us to be so we need to continue in the word of god just turn that up if you could too this is what i look like underneath my skin we can crank that off if we can [Music] there was a recent study by the center for bible engagement where they pulled 40 000 uh general population in the u.s from eight to eighty and they just wanted to see how we are engaging with scripture right and they discovered something that actually became kind of the profound discovery of the entire study they weren't even looking for this and this is kind of became the highlight of study right um when we're in the scripture one time a week and that could be church on sunday that's pastor saying you open your bible we hear the message one time a week had negligible effect on some key areas of your life so i'm gonna spell that out more here in a moment two times a week negligible effect now at three times a week there was a blip on the map like there was a heartbeat something happened again a heartbeat but here was a profound discovery when we're in the scripture four times a week it literally spikes off the turtle you would expect that it'd be one two i mean there'd be a gradual link line on the effect and impact that would have in your life but it was literally one two three four something radically happened okay you got my curiosity to this extent what kind of behavior is being affected feeling lonely throughout thirty percent wow eight four times a week four times a week in the bible okay anger issues dropped 32 percent uh bitterness in relationships marriage a relationship with your kids and so on drops 40 percent alcoholism drops 57 feeling spiritually stagnant you know if there was one area when i'm talking with people that that they'll be honest about is they just feel spiritually stagnant ask them the question how much time do you spend in the scripture if they're in the scripture four times a week or more it drops 60 percent wow viewing pornography dropped 61 that's very important now on a flip positive side sharing your faith jumps 200 percent wow because you have a confidence in god's word and then discipling others jumps 230 that's that's amazing right there [Music] make a difference in your life in so many different but it could help us yeah and we don't even realize it because the devil is trying to keep us away from reading the word we need to save ourselves we need to make the choice to read the bible more spend more time hebrews chapter 2 verse number one therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip how shall we escape verse 3 says if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us that heard him save yourselves mix the gospel with faith you've got to believe what you're hearing hebrews chapter 4 verse number 2 hebrews chapter 4 verse 2 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them why didn't it help some of them right because when they heard it they didn't believe it they didn't mix it with faith it was an intellectual well try to make myself better you can't make yourself better acts chapter 3 going back to our opening scripture here acts chapter 3 verse 41 then they that gladly received the word they were baptized mix it with faith and get baptized in the name of jesus christ and that same day there were three other hun 3 000 other souls that made the same choices we did one day amen we're one of the few one of the few amen i love verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and in fellowship with one another and in the breaking of bread and in prayers amen they just didn't continue they continue steadfastly put your faith in jesus christ he's the captain of our salvation he began a good work he's going to finish it amen we need to gladly receive the word when it comes to us and work out our salvation save ourselves with the word that's coming across the pulpit amen god sent a message in this hour to get us ready we need to take that message and save ourselves know a lot of believers don't continue steadfastly like they should they feel like they've met all the main requirements yeah they just want to continue ever so often here and there a little bit here and there this is not the time for any of us to take our foot off the gas pedal the hour is late if we've not received the seal of the holy ghost we need to be working on saving ourselves we need to keep pressing into sanctification we need to be looking at the things that god's dealing with us about amen the coming of the lord is near first john chapter 3 verse 1. i'll try to get through this i know we're near the end but we saw that long video and i'm not allowing it to have my time behold what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not amen it's okay people think you're strange because you're getting baptized in the name of jesus beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he show up here we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and if you truly believe this if you have this hope inside of you this confidence this expectation every man that have this hope in him purifieth himself he's saving himself even as he is pure even as he is saved he's saving himself amen that's why we don't want to feel like we're being belittled here when we hear the word and the word is telling us that we need to to depress in we need to do more we need to save ourselves yes we're saved but we need to continue saving ourselves because it is he that endure to the end the same shall be saved today is the day of salvation not back then when i got baptized today is the day of my salvation we need to continue to play our part whatever it is that god speaks to us a number of scriptures i'm going to pass but i want to read revelation chapter 19 verse 7 very familiar let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage lamb of for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife saved yourself yes amen he made herself ready she did she was the only one out of everybody that heard the word she was the only one to obey all the word the rest of them only took part of the word right right the foolish virgins they were even clean people right right we need to be serious about the word god is serious about the word his wife is serious about the word amen god played his part by giving us a fivefold ministry we've got to play our part by believing taking the word that god gave us through the fivefold ministry and save ourselves with that word start doing it don't mouth cherry pick you know more smorgasbord do what i want take what i want not what i want that is not how you work out your salvation there is no fear and trembling in that the fear and trembling is i need all the word right if i don't feel comfortable with this i need to get serious because god is part of the word that's fear and trembling that's how you work out your salvation amen now for those of you who have received the seal of the holy ghost then we must keep our shoulder to the wheel in this hour we need to continue serving the lord with all the things that he shows us matthew chapter 28 verse 20 jesus said teaching others to observe all things whatsoever i command you and along with you always even to the end of the world we have to teach others to observe everything that god showed you personally it's kind of hard for you to show for you to tell somebody something when god hasn't showed you yet right but if god showed you something you can share it with somebody amen because he has he's he's commanded you to do it whatsoever i have commanded you we need to keep going keep teaching to the end jesus said lord i am with you to the end amen we can say amen to that second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 for the love of christ constrains us to do this that's right to share the gospel with others it's the love of christ because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead dead to our old sinful selfish self-centered ways of living verse 15 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves anymore amen but unto him that died for them and rose again so we got to switch who we're living for right amen amen we need to continue working for the lord jesus wants us to keep teaching first corinthians chapter 15 verse 58 therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord amen for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord if you're doing it in the name of the lord you're not going to lose a reward right i'd rather mess up greatly trying and not trying at all whoa that's way too quiet that's way too quiet for that statement i'd i'd rather be looked at as messing up but getting back up and trying again and having to be so perfect and get nothing done i only got a little bit time left i'm giving it all i got i don't even know what reward i got when i get on the other side brother ron i have no idea it may be only this right it'll be the grace of god to make it brother bruce but the thing is i i i don't even i can't even think well it's going to be just to this this this big all i know is this is the only chance i have to do something about it and i don't care how i look how i fail what happens i'm just going to get up and i'm going to keep going because he is my reward amen amen he's our reward amen our last scripture hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 this is for us who have the holy spirit we need to save ourselves because there's many other words jesus said many things to say unto you but you can't bear but after the holy spirit comes right you better stomach it hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 but beloved we are persuaded something better of you the things that go along with salvation though we thus speak now what are what are these things let's what are they let's read about them for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have shown toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister amen those are the things that god expects out of us we all have a work to do yes we are all ministers that's right it's just where you want to allocate your time i do know this god is persuaded better things of us god expects us to be working for him and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end well brother john i'm just going to be honest with you it was the end for me a long time ago i think it was the end for a lot of us many times all we need is more holy ghost [Music] the holy ghost doesn't run out of energy it doesn't run out of octane right it's got just as much joy today as the day we felt it it's got just as much peace just as much power we just need to get filled back up yes [Music] there's joy in sharing jesus with somebody amen amen and god desires that every one of us show the same diligence of hope to the end look at verse 12 that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises well the promise is unto you and to your children we just got to get the gospel we can't be slothful we need to save ourselves from being thoughtful we need to save ourselves from being slothful because there's more things that god wants us to be doing i don't want to be lazy i want to be serving the body and i'm talking about not only this body but the body who's not saved yet they're still part of the body just somebody's got to get the truth to them so they can get into the body that's a work that's a labor we don't want to be thoughtful in that in fact jesus said or the bible says maybe james they that win souls is wise it's a wise thing to do amen that means it's unwise not to do it amen let's stand together god wants us to save ourselves you don't have to preach you don't have to minister but we do have to serve we do have to wash some dirty feet we do have to help somebody along the way it's the plan of salvation for a lost soul we all can be saving ourselves from our condition saving ourselves from where we're at to where god is calling us to be so no matter where if if you haven't repented repent if you haven't been baptized be baptized if you haven't received the holy ghost get more serious about cleaning up your life so god can come and fill that precious vessel of yours right if you've got the holy ghost then amen get more get serious about using that vessel for the lord amen because that's what sanctification is all about it's set aside for service after you get the spirit you can't help there's something inside of you it's persuaded better things share the gospel with somebody every single day what a difference it would make it would help your it would help you uh it would help you somehow spiritually he was saying 200 and something percent just sharing your faith amen don't let this be the only place you get serious with god people talk about god all day long don't they brother and they're not serious about god it's not about talking about god it's about being serious about god amen take time to get serious with god and save yourself no matter where you're at with god save yourselves you put forth the next foot god will meet you you draw nigh to god god will draw nigh to you whatever your need is god will meet that need he's just looking for someone to say i need you lord i need you amen amen let's see that little course open our eyes lord and i think that's the biggest thing about really moving forward is lord open my eyes to see what i need to do next open our eyes lord we want to see
