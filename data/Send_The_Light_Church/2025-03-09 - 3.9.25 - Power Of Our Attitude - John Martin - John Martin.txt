heart just seems to be ferti to better receive the word and so it gives us a greater opportunity to have our needs met amen you know it's it's it's it's not the the worship service is not to make us feel good it's to give honor to God amen amen he's worthy of all of our praise amen um I just want to read a card before we uh look into the scriptures and this is a thank you card that sister Lynn had given and I'm not sure if everybody got a chance to read it is put on the B board I just wanted to read it just in case you didn't get a chance to read it it says with thanks to all of uh to all of you uh sending all of our a sincere thank you for being so warm and so wonderful thank you the best church family ever love sister Lynn amen and she just uh appreciated so much the support and uh we are a family and we got to continue to to treat one another with love and respect uh and to support one another especially when there's hurt and pain amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of Hebrews chapter 6 and then also Colossians chapter 3 Hebrews chapter 6 and Colossians chapter 3 also we want to continue praying for sister Lynn and her sister am amen let's just look to the Lord in prayer and just ask His blessings upon the word and Upon Our Eyes amen our hearts Heavenly Father we bow before you with Thanksgiving that you've given us the strength to be here today the health to be here you helped us to get up earlier Lord perhaps some of us are tired Lord we ask that your Holy Spirit would come personally hover around each one of us Lord our our minds our hearts uh and and come and minister to us in a personal way Lord we've come here to meet with you Lord we're thankful for our brothers and sisters Lord we're grateful that we can meet with them Lord a heart is to to be with you today to to to hear from you Lord and I I pray for the anointing of the Holy Spirit may it be upon each of us Lord may you break the bread of life to us may you help us to get out of the way that you may speak words of life into each one of us let us leave here today Lord so much more powerful than when we came in equipped to face the enemy at every turn am just grow to that statue of a perfect man as Brother Bruce had said just to overcome that we can wear a crown Grant it Lord we commit the service bless these scriptures and may they be accompanied with salvation we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Hebrews chapter 6 verse number n but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and the things that accompany salvation though we thus speak amen we'll be coming back to this chapter but we want to read just a few in Colossians chapter 3: 8- 10 Colossians chap 3: 8-10 so we see here there's certain things that accompany a man that is saved and here Paul is saying in the book of Galatians there is we we do away with certain things and we add on certain things verse 8 says but now ye also put off these anger wrath ra malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lying not one to another seeing you put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him amen God bless you you may be seated so we see here we could just look at verse number 12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of mercy and kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a crow against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness so we see here that there's a there's a putting off of certain things and then there's a putting on of certain things and we're going to go back here to the book of of of of Hebrews and we see here um that there's things that accompany salvation many people want to say they're saved and they don't think about anything else they just claiming that they're saved based on a few things so here this this this book of Hebrews is really a to me it's a great book about you need to continue to move forward yes the whole book is we see here chapter 6 this is verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection right and not just laying hands of the uh laying hands uh laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Faith toward god of the do doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment in this will we do if God permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again and to repentance seeing they have crucified to them themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain and cometh often upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat uh for them by whom it is dressed receiveth the blessings from God but that which is uh what beareth thorns and Briars is rejected is nend to curse him whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you the things that accompany salvation though we thus speak so we see here that so many start on with Christ they they they repent they get baptized they say I'm going to be a Christian I'm going to serve God my life's going to change my life's going to become new and then there's this great battle the same battle to me that the children of Israel had when they came out of Egypt to continue moving marching through all the trials until they hit the promised land and we our promised land is the nature of God inside of us that is then that is our Promised Land it isn't saying I got the holy ghost that is not it because until we see it manifested in our life till All Things become like him I say we need to keep marching forward and if we just have that kind of attitude but we see here that that there's this tendency to try to stop but yet the blessings still come the rain still comes down it falls on the just and the unjust and and and and and and fruit comes but the ones where it's the Briars and the Thorns you know they get blessed but remember at the end they get burned they don't make it so the the the the message comes out it's like a warning a Stern warning look there's there's better things they're persuaded of you don't go by them don't live like that there's things that accompany salvation and we need to put away the old man we need to start acting like Christians that's what the word is for it isn't just there well yeah that's a I I see that's a good book and that's what we should be doing but it's not that Bigg a thing no it has to be there's not going to be any Christians up there that are full of anger that truth like want to punch somebody's eyes out and gossiping and and this and that that won't be up in heaven one thing that accompanies salvation is the spirit that brought us salvation the Holy Spirit should be accompanied with us amen Jesus said I'll send back the comforter of the the Holy Ghost in Galatians 5:22 says that the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gness goodness Faith meekness Temperance so this should be accompanying us amen true if the I I I if the Holy Ghost brought us salvation the Holy Ghost is with us and this is the fruit of the Holy Ghost right Jesus said in Matthew 7:16 ye shall know them by their fruit yes well we just read what the fruit of the spirit is and he says do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles absolutely not even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit every crup tree bringing forth evil fruit amen now that's pretty clear but here's the big deal here's the big deal it's that great area in between every good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is he down and cast Into the Fire wherefore You by their fruits you shall know them now here's the thing there is the possibility I'm going to just say a mixed tree is not good tree true it is an evil tree now when we look at evil we look at his pure devil black evil there ain't no good in it but remember the two trees that the two spiritual trees that were in the garden one was a mixed tree it was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so there was good in it so there is the possibility of Believers being good but yet being evil and and and Jesus is saying you'll know them by their fruits right so here again the scripture is pointing us that we need to go on to Perfection we need to we need to continue to knock off the old man that that's still there and not being s satisfied with with whatever we're looking at so we're not we're not excited about a tree where we see two Spirits bearing two fruits two Spirits amen wherefore by their fruit you shall know them for God has not given us the spirit of fear right that doesn't accompany salvation but of power and of love and of a sound mind that's right amen don't you think God gives us more than a form of godliness absolutely he gives us power to overcome he gives us love to live for others he gives us the mind of Christ let the mind that was in Christ be in you amen so this is this this is what accompanies salvation and we have every right to demand it in our life you know excuse me for saying you know I I don't ever like saying you know but I say you know isn't that terrible of course you don't know my dad used to say but I say you know dad he says no I don't know you're telling this one so tell me so I do know and I completely lost my train of thought on that so we're all on the same page together I am not going to fake that one it came back it came back God said it gives grace to the [Laughter] humble we have such a tendency of of being able to see where other people are at or at least we got a good opinion right but the thing is this gospel is for me yes amen right do I have a sound mind yes do I have power do I have love not noticing when other people aren't showing it because the quicker we get to uh where God wants me to be the quicker we are actually be able to help people because our words telling people just don't help people it's the life it's the life that the demons tremble but God is persuaded better things of us the things that accompany salvation one thing that should accompany salvation is a good attitude yes because it took a good attitude to actually get salvation we had to Humble ourselves I I mean we didn't care nothing about God we didn't go looking for God and God knocked on the door and said you're going straight to hell he got our attention somehow we saw the goodness of God amen and we had to repent that's a good attitude repentance is a good attitude and we know what happens if a good attitude does not continue to accompany salvation I want to tell you this Hebrews 3:14 for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confident steadfast to the end we must maintain a good attitude now our attitude can seem like an insignificant element in our lives but it makes a great impact oh but brother John I focus on faith I believe Faith does I say yes my dear brother and sister but you can't have faith without a right attitude you can't just have a negative attitude and say you got faith you it's impossible God is not going to bless us with faith when we're murmuring complaining gossiping being negative not caring not trying just have a bad attitude and we expect God to give us Faith about situations we've heard attitude is a small thing that can make a big difference brother bam said the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass so if a right attitude can bring the divine presence down from heaven in our have what will a wrong attitude do it will bring down the presence of the Demonic world to work against us think about that if a right attitude will bring the Divine Promises of God to pass what would what will a bad attitude do it will bring the Demons of Heaven down to destroy your life but we don't think about it like that how can it work one way but not the other Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now those are what comes down when our attitude is I don't really care I don't feel like trying I don't care what he says I don't care what she says you are bringing down hell right to you with a bad attitude great quote from Charles Sendo attitude is more important than facts it's more important than the past than education the money circumstances than failures and success than what other people think say or do is more important than appearance ability or skill it will make or break a business a home a friendship in organization the remarkable thing is I have a choice every day of what my attitude will be I can I cannot change my past I cannot change the actions of others around me I cannot change the inevitable the only thing I can change is my attitude life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it but notice how we react is how we think it really is and we should be focusing on us the other 90% yes sir not about what we see out here because you can't change a lot of stuff out here especially when you just brought down hell when negga when you're when we're negative we can't deal with stuff you know what I'm talking about how many times you just had to walk away just walk away right but with the sound mind you can give a soft answer and turn away wrath because you got the power of God right there a quote I I read it they give the credit to Thomas Jefferson but they say it's incorrect but that's all we could fine says nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal and nothing on Earth can help a man with a wrong mental attitude nothing can help him true the power of our attitude that's the name of our service today the power of our attitude people with the wrong mental attitude are really troublemakers they cause problems in the church home the workplace road rage in the store we've seen it how many times you you you I'm I'm it's been a while but I I remember going to the going places and hoping the kids didn't act up all right don't be a troubl maker I'll say this a wrong mental attitude really brings about making trouble but it's it's not always how we think there are peacemakers they have the right mental attitude there are troublemakers they have the wrong mental attitude peacemakers they care they want peace and they're willing to lay down their life to get it we're troublemakers they don't care they're selfish and they cause trouble around others they don't care people are affected by how they act and you're not both I am telling you you're not both your heart is one or the other it's either it cares a lot or it doesn't really care the random said in the message God projecting his love he said there are two different types of love two different types of love and I'm almost sure that many of us have been deceived with having fial love and thinking it was a go love fial love he said is intellectual agape love comes from the heart that's human love affectionate love and godly love Godly love doesn't question human love reasons but Godly love doesn't it's perfect in its trust it's perfect it just produces faith when you really love so the key is love God you'll trust him intellectual says no you got to prove it first no you're got to make me feel it I got to see it all these three things gotta line all this got to have and then I'll believe see because it's in the head it reasons amen now to face an audience like this of s several hundred people then someone would say do you mean that you would just read those one that one little verse of scripture brother BR says well there is enough in that verse of scripture and he's referring to John 316 to send you to heaven or to condemn you forever and if I had power I will in no wise change it if I would be offered all the money in the world or to be a king of the universe and a and a million years to reign in health I still wouldn't change one word of that text because it's God's word and it can never change no matter how small it is it's the same it's got the same value in it as the entire book has got and he says your action or your attitude towards this little piece of scripture will seal your Eternal Destiny and this is what I want to say today I want you to pay attention to this it's all about your attitude your attitude church one scripture can seal your destiny and we don't think about it because we're thinking about other things but if you want your life to change the key is in your attitude the key is in your attitude it's not in somebody's ability to make you feel good when you're at church it's in the ability of you believing the scripture and having an attitude that knows it's God and that if the whole world didn't believe it you would still stand there and believe it that is what will change your life am in the message here you him brother B says so now the Lord bless you as I read for just a little short text the Lord willing in chapter 17 of St Matthew's gospel and the last three words of the fifth verse he you him these little words but you say that's an awful small text brother brandom but it isn't the size of the text it's the context of it it it's what will determine your Eternal Destiny every man that hears it and his attitude towards it amen we know the word is perfect but what is the attitude towards it yes that's what's important we're going to get into some I think we're going to have some rich stuff this morning God helping us our attitude has everything to do with where we're at life where we're at with God has everything to do with our happiness the Bible says he gives more grace to the humble amen and he resists the proud and gives grace to the humble so if you want more from God have a good attitude to me a person that's proud does not have a good attitude a proud Spirit which you can see a mile away you've heard The Strife was so thick you can cut it with a knife when you see pride it is so thick it is not transparent you see it because it's manifested in so many ways and a a proud spirit is a wrong attitude you're not going to get much grace like that why because God re resists that thing because that's what Lucifer has so we're told to submit to God take the right mental attitude and God will help you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you amen it's all about the attitude we choose we choose to draw nigh to God or we don't we choose that I'm going to take this word my life is going to change or we're going to choose to just well when when is service over I got some things going on today I'm looking forward to it God is humble his nature is humble learn of me I'm meek and lowly I dwell with them of a humble and contrary Spirit humility is a choice of attitude when you see somebody and you say oh that's a humble sister that's a humble brother I am telling you that's a choice that they make they have a right attitude they're they're choosing to resist all the negative evil that come into their head all their judgmental thoughts that come into their head they're choosing to say I'm not going to think on that and they choose to be humble too much we look at that we say oh that's just their personality sir but I tell you I wasn't born like this I wanted to knock somebody's head off I wanted to hurt people that's right I wanted to well I did drink and all that stuff humility is a choice it's not something you're born with or not born with in fact we're all born without it we're all B born with a proud selfish spirit and if you don't put that thing off it'll stay there and it'll stay there and it'll stay there in church it'll stay there in church it may not rash out but it'll stay there in church we're going to talk about how that's stopping us but Jesus just kind of want to show how the importance of an attitude here John 939 John 9:39 Jesus said for judgment I am coming into the world that they which see not might see and they which see might be made blind so God has come to deal with people's attitude and some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and they said oh are we blind also are you going to tell me that I'm blind and Jesus said unto them if you were blind you should have no sin but now you say we see Therefore your sin REM ath amen it's all attitude because you say no different than Le to seal because you say you're in need of nothing you're actually naked blind you need so much you need to come by and me gold Tred in the fire because of your attitude I'm going to tell you this age that we live in this the the spirits that we rub shoulders with every day it's the spirit that's of a of of of a um double-minded it's not hot it's not cold it's lukewarm it can't make a decision I'm going to stay here a little bit for God a little bit for my will a little bit for lukewarm God looks at that says I'd rather have you one or the other he doesn't say well I'd rather have you be hot with me he doesn't say that because he he respects Choice he madees man he made the Devil with a choice you know what he finally stuck with it I think the de God has more respect for the devil than a lot of so-called lukewarm Believers at least he can look at the Devil and say that's a devil you look at some half-hearted in and out and I'm a Christian but no I'm not no holding accountable no taking on no responsibility to become the statue of a perfect man the spirit that's in the people in this age is the spirit is is is speaking to me that it's lacking the new birth which is the Holy Ghost the deity of God people don't people don't even like talking about the New Birth that is the they're not serious about coming to the Altar and seeking it they they feel they already got it in need of nothing they don't even realize what spirit's on them Jesus said you must be born again right and the word is the only thing this is the only thing in in spirit form this in spirit form is the only thing that can change our nature amen it's not learning what it says not learning the message not qu it's not intellectually having it it's the spirit of the word coming inside of your heart where the nature really is coming from and changing it and that's the new birth Peter said in 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not of in not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever so when you're born again you're not born again of a little bit better seed than corruptible like I I I was able to stop smoking yeah but I'm still doing this that's not the seed you're born with so if you stop smoking praise God but you stare at what yet has to be done and you keep moving and believing for it not saying well you know we're we're all going to be you know you know none of us are perfect where's that can to lead us to I don't see that pressing towards any Mark and it's going to drag you the wrong way see it's your attitude that's important now brother Brandon said the natural birth types the spiritual birth we have the natural seeds and spiritual seeds Genesis tells us that every seed brings forth of its kind but it must meet the right conditions in order to bring forth life real important because we're talking really in this that I'm going to be going we're talking about us bringing forth the word and in order for the word of God to bring forth life today it must meet the right requirements see we know that this word is perfect the spirit of God is perfect the spirit of the word is perfect the preaching we can say of the word is perfect what has to get perfect it's the receiving of the word amen that's what has to get perfect amen has to be conditioned now a natural male human seed enters the female womb but if it stays there it will die that seed needs to continue moving forward and the Egg th of the female must come and meet them they must meet that male cell and that egg must open itself to receive the male word amen it has to if it don't life will not come forth from the seed entering into the womb are you with me can you say Amen we got to get past this natural part for a second just so we understand how this thing works it's no different with the spiritual word seed of God it must enter the womb of the church brother Braham talked about the mind being the womb of the Soul or the spirit it starts in the mind but understand if the word just stays in your head it will never bring forth life it must continue going towards the heart and inside your heart there is a desire and that that intentions and that motive it's going forth to meet that word that desire to have it manifested and if you open yourself up to that word that is when life will come manifested in you Hallelujah but if you sit there and church and you hear the word you say Amen to the word but in your heart you never receive it it'll never bring forth life it'll just be like having sex we're here because we want to be manifested sons of God we don't want to just have some put on some form of godliness oh this is what the church plays I guess I got to act like this no this is what God's calling us to he's calling us to put off these things he's calling us to put on these things I can't do that within myself if I could I wouldn't need the gospel so I need him to do it and he ain't going to do it here it is unless that desire inside of you is not going to come up and reach that word that's in your mind that word has to drop down to your heart and your desire has got to reach that it's got to open up and say come on in Lord I want this for my life and there there's a bond that's made right there in those two cells they just fuse together what happens life comes forth that's what it means to be born again not joining a church not saying I've been serving the lord so long not saying I'm in the message but we got to be seeing things that accompany our Salvation accompany the new birth there needs to be change happening year after year you can't be looking at your life and saying I see the same old thing that I saw a year ago that's true now can you imagine a woman being pregnant we understand that it takes about nine months can you imagine after four months five months that she just stops takes a break for a year later nothing goes on on no growing no once the seed starts it keeps going we don't hear of a mother stopping that stopping with her baby inside it's not growing for a year come on it don't work like that the natural birth types A Spiritual birth amen we need to understand that the devil's doing everything he can to stop that seed from reaching what it needs to he's got distractions he wants the word to fall on four different types of ground we understand what the devil's devices are but what we need to do is be humble and have the right attitude and say am is this accompanying my life or am I just trying to be a better a better Christian than everybody who's not I don't want to be better than somebody I want to be the word he's coming for a word bride amen it must connect with the egg inside of the Bride did it will the word of God travels beyond our mind reaches towards our heart and that word of God God must reach the greatest desire of our heart now here's what I'm going to say with this you know you ever been talking to somebody they're talking to you they're talking about one thing but their motive is something different you know what I'm talking about deceitful it's like what do you got up your sleeve you know what I'm talking about we can have many desires we can have a desire for God we can have have lovers of pleasure or the lovers of God we can have love for so many different things we have a desire to do so many things but you know God will not receive you until you want him more than anything amen theuth you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart and until that desire gets there the new birth will not happen yeah you can repent and you can get baptized that's right you can start you go to church and things can start to happen but if you do not continue on if you do not go on to Pro if you do not keep doing what the preaching is telling you to do you don't dig into the word you don't say God make me what I ought to be and you don't press in with all your heart I am telling you you will come short of the new birth be those that start to build their house they didn't have they didn't pay the price enough to finish it right they didn't consider the cost well what's the cost the cost is all your heart that cost is all your life amen God is not going to accept you into the kingdom and you only give 50% of your life to him why thought all had to do is repent get baptized and I'm saved search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify of me we need the whole book Amen to understand what it really means to believe really to do anything to repent amen Jesus said I stand at the door of our heart so the the word the word comes in is standing there at the door what has to happen we have to open the door amen that's our desire now we all know this we want to open the door that says God this is where all the blessings come right here but then there's another door to the rest of the house that door we don't want God to go in but God is knocking at the door to your house amen and when you say God I really want my life to change right I don't want to go down the path of the world because if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God ain't even in you amen you can't do both that desire has to be all for God yes and I know this is strong preaching but we need it we need it oh my my I got a quote I haven't even read the whole thing but I grabbed it right at the end brother brandham said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he says and the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the Mind receive the word then the Spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life there you are that's what it does the real gospel teaching brother I believe it if St Paul was standing here today he'd be teaching the same thing that I do in this hour well we know that to be the truth God's spirit the life of God has to come and Unite with that desire that's inside of us now we know that we could sit all day and learn boy about anything we could learn about cars we learn about um money we can learn about taxes we can learn about the Bible and the next day don't even be thinking about it so we have the ability to get the word in our mind but if that does not come down into the heart and meet with life brother Braham talks about um the chickens that lay the eggs but they never hatch out and he said the reason they don't is because that hen was never with the rooster can you say amen and so therefore it doesn't have the life to bring forth we've got to we've got to get serious with God we got to meet God and we got to stay in our fellowship and stay connected to the vine Le you abide in me and I abide in you he said you can do nothing without me nothing we can't even be a Christian we can't even stop ourselves from getting angry and yelling at somebody we can't even stop oursel from having an attitude true we can't even stop oursel from we we don't even want to forgive somebody our attitude plays such an important role in manifesting the word of God we don't ever think you don't have to have a good attitude and you manifest the word of God it is so you're you're so deceived I'll say that you're so deceived if you think that the Bible says if we hear the word and don't do it we deceive ourselves we need the right attitude for growing in Christ for maturing for overcoming even for adoption if our attitude is well I really don't care what God is saying right now then our desire will never connect with God Amen and the word of God will never bring forth life to us well I don't need this I don't need this church I don't need I don't need this message I can just you know I can stay home and go online and watch whatever I want to watch and you tell me God is going to take that attitude into a Rapture you think God's going to say yeah I want to get married to that I want to spend eternity with that kind of attitude you know God is the type of God that wants to see you are you willing to suffer he is right if you don't suffer you don't reain Christ laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for others he is our example Christ is he is our example of suffering that we should follow in his steps Peter said just a a couple examples many of us know of the story of non in Second Kings non was a a captain of a Syrian Army he was a the Bible says he was a Mighty Man Of valure Because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he was a great and honorable man so but he had leprosy so we know that there is so much good about this man he just had leprosy he had a problem non and his wife had a maid who who had taken captive from the land of Israel and she knew about the prophet Elisha and she told her mistress I would God that my Lord were with the prophet that was in Samaria for he would recover him or non of his leprosy right so the word got to non and non came with his horses and his chariots and he stood outside the door of the House of Elisha this is 2 Kings 5:9 and verse 10 and Elisha sent Messengers unto him he wouldn't even come to the door came all traveled all that way and he stayed in another room you would think that's kind of disrespectful and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean and non was wroth verse 11 now he just received the word he just received the word what to do to get his healing but instead he got angry and he went away offended at the word of the prophet and said behold I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call the name of the Lord is God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper you know we all got preconceived ideas too don't we I think the church should do this and the preacher should do that the pastor should do he shouldn't do this and he shouldn't and the prophet you know I just that word Roth it means crack off to burst out in Rage and to be angry non had the message of the hour all figured out why have so many people left the message they left you know a lot of them left in Wrath right they you can't hardly find any that walked away just humble they won't say anything they they just walk away wouldn't say no they got to be outraged against it Same Spirit nonon had a wrong mental attitude and I'm telling you if he would have kept it life would have not came forth and he would have been a leper died a leper and that's a truth because he received the word of the Lord it was in his mind but it never dropped down to his heart it was in his mind and he began to reason with it intellectual love you know what I'm talking about that's and he goes on to say are not Abner and far par rivers of Damascus better than all the rivers of Israel may I not wash in them and be clean he had a different Revelation so he turned and went away in a rage that means hot displeasure it it is so strong if you look it up the word means poisoned that's how bad it was and his servants came near and spake unto him said my father my father if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing would has thou not done it how much rather than when he saith to thee wash and be clean his servants taught nonon how to have a good attitude how important it is when we're trying to help one another have a good attitude believe the word that's come forth at the church or the tape that you're listening to or the Bible that you're reading let it drop down into your heart because that's exactly what was happening his servants was trying to get that word that he knew up here to drop down here yes I'm telling you they knew his attitude was going to make or break it those servants had a reel ation that if they did not change non's attitude that he was going to continue to be a leper so they actually had a burden they convinced him then went he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the Flesh of a little child and he was clean does not the Bible say believe in the the Lord so shall you be established Believe In His prophets so shall you prosper it's a promise take it seriously I am telling you there's not another book in the world that you can read and have confidence like the word of God now understand we you know we we prayed and we tried and we we we we did all these things and we thought you know you know somehow that God failed us but we don't want to say it but yet we believe it right it's a difference between trust and not trust brandom said in the message the ins sign he says how do you do lady I believe that she's up at the the podium going across being prayed for how do you do lady do you believe me to be his servant Do You Believe Me Do you believe that he is here now do you believe that the spirit's here to make you well he says you're a stranger here in this city too he says you're from Toledo sorry I couldn't find one that was of Michigan with this is that right and aren't you a minister it's a lady and he says aren't you a minister he says your husband's a minister too now notice the spirit is not correcting this right now this is the Holy Ghost In Charge is not correcting that situation he says that's right sitting right here uh-huh never seen you in my life but you got heart trouble haven't you he says you're healed God bless you go on your way see your mental attitudes quite a difference between you and the lady that just passed here and he must have been looking at somebody else when he said that he calls he didn't say nothing here about faith right he did say you you know do you believe but he said it was your attitude that made a quite a big difference one is humble and one is not humble enough to believe God's word now someone who just got upset at the truth and didn't change his attitude was Cain yeah right that's right the the the the same word is used but unto Cain this is Genesis 4:5 but unto Cain into his offering he had no respect and Cain was what WTH got upset and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why are they rough why are you upset why are you jealous why are you angry why is th countenance Fallen if thou doest well Thou shalt be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and thou and th and they sh I'm sorry and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so he had an opportunity is he had an opportunity he had a choice to choose to do what the word said had a choice to change his attitude to put off a bad attitude to put on a new attitude he had that choice God gave Cain that choice you know what but Cain went home and he continued to get upset continued to get angry continued to fill his mind with how much he was displeased with his brother amen that is and eventually it came out because you got something against somebody I'm telling you if you don't sincerely forgive him from your heart it'll stay there and rot you poisoned Cain acted like there was no consequences to his choices Luke Chapter 13 verse1 please bear with me we just may go a few minutes extra if that's okay with you amen and for those that it's not okay you can quietly we're going to continue on Luke 13:1 there was president at the season I'm going to just we're going to talk about the importance of repenting correctly when you repent you're exercising the power of your attitude there were present at that season some that told Jesus of the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices and Jesus answered and said unto them suppose ye that these uh galileans were Sinners above all the galileans because they suffered such things you ever look at somebody and said oh wow and this is what Jesus said about that and I tell you nay but except you repent you shall likewise perish or of those 18 upon whom the tower and Shalom fall and slew them think ye that they were Sinners above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem and I tell you nay but except you repent you shall all likewise perish so we see here that repentance is the right attitude always repentance is the right attitude amen and if we back exite 100 times a day we we ought to be repentant 100 times a day you know not me brother John the way that I do it I I'm such you know what I do is I just kind of just wait to the end of the day you know just do it all one time you know because I'm real busy what if you don't make it to the end of the day what if you don't make it to the end of the day blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy if we don't forgive men their trespasses God will not forgive us our so our attitude towards other people determines our destiny think about that that's true my attitude towards others determines where I'm going right wow I thought I could have any old kind of thoughts about anybody and I'm still okay NOP that's a lie of the devil amen Mercy is another thing that accompanies salvation amen that's going to be my last quote brother BR said painted face Jezebel in the message painted face Jezebel he says now if we see what God did back there to those people upon certain attitudes that they had taken towards God and then if we find out if we'll take that same attitude that they did we will receive the same reward they did it's right brother you can just expect CU God never changes he's just the same he's his Blessing is the same and his penalties are the same Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever so I just want to say this why don't we just seek to have the same attitude learn learn how namon got his life turned around had a miraculous healing just because his attitude maybe God is asking us to do something are you with me amen amen the power of our attitude ude is a choice that that will make a difference in our life amen so we have a choice to separate from certain things be not unequally yolked together right put off the things of the world put off malice and anger and hatred you know about those things that we think you know are not that big a thing they're kind of private they're just between me and my husband me and my wife me and my children me and my boss who I hate and sometimes you know me and my neighbor that you know no put it off be Christ to that evil I'm going just say like this Christ is calling us to overcome and you know what really does it it's love love is what overcomes it it's not proving to the other person how wrong they are and what they're doing it's helping them like the Servants of nonon helped non to choose the right way that that's why the Bible says if a brother be overtaken to fall ye which are spiritual go to him in a spirit of meekness and fear considering yourself lest you also be tempted it takes someone with the love of God to help somebody most people when they see there's a problem you know what they do they walk away and I'll tell you I'm going to say this if Christ lives in you how is Christ allowing you to walk away when he walk towards you am this does it make sense so I say that God is calling us to be more like him amen let your salvation be ACC company with the right mental attitude but beloved we are persuaded did better things of you things like respect do you think respect accompan salvation amen how many testimonies have we heard over the years people said you know I used to do this and I used to do that and I didn't care about this I mean I was I was tearing down buildings before I was converted then after I got converted I I don't know how many churches we built because you respect when you got the Holy Ghost you respect I know because at one time I didn't respect I didn't care what my dad said I didn't care what people thought I didn't even care if they were right and I was wrong that's how bad it was but respect accompanies Salvation And if you're not respecting you need to look and get saved you need to esteem others better than yourself amen let's Stand Together respect accompanies salvation I know this is a challenging message today but I'll say to encourage you you're where you're at with God because of choices that you made so when you were out in the world you'd still be there if you didn't make the choice that you made to get where you're at I want you to be encouraged with that but I do want you to know that God is calling all of us unto Perfection now there's only one group of people that's going to go there that's the bride the rest are going to stay and they're going to just wallow in the wilderness murmur and complain and I just say like like this from my heart I love you and I want to provoke you to good works I want us to look at our lives in a personal way and make sure that the things that accompany the holy spirit is accompanying Our Lives we don't want to be in that side that the whole church world is that they say they got God but that's not accompanying their life we want to be Christ to others that's how we know when when when we're being Christ to others that's how we know that the right things are accompaning Sal accompanying salvation for our lives we're not going to preach uh uh uh a a death s uh bed a bed confession or on the cross at the last minute that's not what this ministry is for this ministry is to help a bride get ready to get serious with the word and to allow it to come into the heart and change a man from from Death onto life and you know what's exciting I think for a Christian he never stops changing amen he never stops changing it's so exciting praise the Lord amen let's sing uh fill my cup Lord fill my cup cup fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and qu this thirsting of my
