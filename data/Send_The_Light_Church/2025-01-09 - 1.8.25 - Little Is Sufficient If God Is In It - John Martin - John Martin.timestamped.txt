[36:14] as you promise not to get
[36:19] tired amen second Corinthians chapter 3
[36:22] verse number five
[36:24] reads not that we are sufficient icient
[36:28] of ourselves to think
[36:30] anything as of
[36:32] ourselves but our
[36:35] sufficiency is of God Amen God bless you
[36:38] you may be seated we want to talk about
[36:40] our sufficiency where it comes from and
[36:43] just entitle this message if we could
[36:46] little is sufficient if God is in it
[36:50] little is sufficient if God is in it you
[36:53] ever been in a situation where you just
[36:56] you're just gonna like you're going to
[36:58] take charge and you're going to handle
[37:00] it and you you just feel like you can
[37:02] just do this thing but you find out that
[37:04] you weren't able to take care of
[37:08] it sometimes we look to ourselves as
[37:11] that we're able to handle a situation
[37:15] without
[37:16] God but I believe with God we can have
[37:19] confidence in handling the situation but
[37:21] it's recognizing where our help really
[37:24] does come from because sometimes our our
[37:27] own intelligence even sometimes our past
[37:31] experiences if we think we had something
[37:33] to do with something that good that had
[37:35] had happened even that thought can get
[37:38] us to thinking that our sufficiency is
[37:40] in ourselves in our own
[37:42] ability and um you know when Paul said
[37:45] forgetting those things which are behind
[37:47] I think there's certain things that we
[37:49] we should set behind us and and not
[37:52] think about them any bit more and uh and
[37:56] and and look to the Lord for our
[37:59] sufficiency for the future amen so we
[38:02] know the scriptures here it's talking
[38:04] about the the ministry that God is has
[38:07] given us that we are able ministers and
[38:10] and that our sufficiency is not of
[38:11] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[38:13] but our sufficiency is of God and as
[38:15] long as we can keep focused that God is
[38:17] the reason for every victory in our life
[38:19] I believe we can keep moving forward
[38:21] with the Lord It's a time that we begin
[38:23] to want people to look at us to to think
[38:26] that there's something about us that
[38:28] they should look to I remember one one
[38:30] time there was a a man that he was
[38:32] begging and he looked to Peter and John
[38:34] and said you know give us something and
[38:36] he said don't look upon us as if if we
[38:40] have anything to give but what we have
[38:43] is is of god such as I have give I Thee
[38:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus or this
[38:48] this one and there was a big thing where
[38:50] they came and you know what what caused
[38:53] this this this man to to be able to see
[38:56] when he couldn't see before or to be
[38:57] healed when he wasn't healed before and
[38:59] they they they kept saying don't look at
[39:01] us it was
[39:03] Jesus and we need to remember Jesus is
[39:06] the answer to take care of all of our
[39:08] problems in life all of them amen let's
[39:12] take a look here at this story in St
[39:14] John chapter 6 verse2 for a little bit
[39:16] the story of Jesus feeding the 5000 with
[39:19] just a boy's lunch everybody remember
[39:22] that
[39:24] story what about the rest of you did you
[39:26] forget it that's why we're reading it
[39:27] today because you forgot the
[39:30] story all right St John chapter 6 verse
[39:32] number two and a great multitude
[39:35] followed Jesus because they saw his
[39:37] miracles which he had did on them that
[39:40] were diseased and Jesus went up into the
[39:42] mountain and there he sat with his
[39:44] disciples and the Passover and the
[39:47] Passover a feast of the Jews was nine
[39:49] and when Jesus then lifted up his eyes
[39:51] and saw a great company unto him he
[39:55] saith unto Phillip whence shall we buy
[40:00] bread that these may
[40:05] eat so Jesus cared about the people that
[40:10] were with him just naturally that they
[40:12] needed to be
[40:15] fed and look at verse six and this he
[40:18] said to prove him for he himself knew
[40:23] what he would
[40:26] do Jesus Jesus knew how these people
[40:29] were going to be fed but he was trying
[40:32] to put this
[40:35] responsibility upon
[40:37] Phillip that something needs to be done
[40:39] because he had compassion upon these
[40:41] people he kep and I think one place it
[40:44] talked about that he had he saw them as
[40:46] sheep having no Shepherd that they
[40:48] needed
[40:49] someone but Jesus wanted to prove to his
[40:53] disciples just how great he is he wanted
[40:57] to prove that to Phillip and to his
[41:00] disciples the Bible tells us that Jesus
[41:03] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[41:06] forever he is a great God Jesus is the
[41:09] key to success the Bible tells us that
[41:12] all things were and are created by Him
[41:16] including the squirrels that brother
[41:17] Brandon spoke into existence they really
[41:20] came from the word of God and his
[41:23] disciples were not the answer notice the
[41:26] disciples were not the answer Philip
[41:28] wasn't the answer the money was not the
[41:31] answer
[41:33] but the disciples were actually the
[41:37] instrument that God used to provide food
[41:40] to the
[41:42] people God was the answer the disciples
[41:45] were the instrument that God used to get
[41:47] the food to the people it's really no
[41:49] different than
[41:50] today but the food came from God and
[41:53] Jesus created the bread I meant to bring
[41:56] some bread today we got from Panera
[41:57] Bread my son asked me if I wanted he
[41:59] couldn't eat it so I ate half of it I
[42:01] thought well I could just use this today
[42:03] because this is a a really good prop we
[42:06] could use this but Jesus created the
[42:08] bread and the disciples passed it out
[42:11] and it's no different than this very
[42:13] moment we're sitting here in church the
[42:15] real bread the real breaking the real
[42:17] Revelation the real unveiling the real
[42:19] word comes from
[42:20] God but it's the disciples that hand out
[42:24] the bread to us right in John
[42:29] 6:35 says Jesus said I am the bread of
[42:32] life he that cometh to me shall never
[42:34] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[42:37] never thirst so Jesus Christ is the
[42:40] bread of life amen he's the spiritual
[42:43] Mana so at this this this which we're
[42:47] reading this great this great story that
[42:49] is known all over the world that Jesus
[42:53] fed
[42:54] 5,000 uh men with just a boy's a lad's
[42:59] lunch the Bible
[43:01] says but it was a perfect type of Christ
[43:05] being able to supply everybody's need
[43:10] spiritually and Christ is the spiritual
[43:13] man or he's the word of God and that
[43:15] every man must live by and he breaks the
[43:18] bread of life he gives it to his
[43:20] disciples through the five-fold ministry
[43:22] and they give it to the body and I just
[43:24] want to read this I want to if I could
[43:25] go off here to Ephesians
[43:27] 4:1 we'll just look at this and come
[43:29] back to the story and God gave some he
[43:34] didn't give everybody that claims it but
[43:36] he gave some Apostles and some prophets
[43:38] and some evangelists and some pastors
[43:40] and teachers and what did he give them
[43:43] for to use them to give the word of God
[43:47] out to the people so that there would be
[43:49] a perfecting of the Saints right not not
[43:54] just to eat about some ideas and learn
[43:57] but to perfect
[43:58] us to work the ministry and for the
[44:02] edifying of the whole body of Christ and
[44:05] I want you to put yourself in this
[44:07] condition here I think that all of us
[44:09] should have a goal to be perfected amen
[44:13] I think we should all roll up our
[44:14] sleeves and say I owe it to Jesus Christ
[44:17] to work in the ministry amen and I
[44:20] believe that we should be willing when
[44:22] we come to church to not worry only
[44:25] about us that we should actually try to
[44:27] ify somebody else we should have a
[44:29] concern for the other part of the body
[44:32] it's called love and how long do we got
[44:34] to do this we got to do this every
[44:36] day till we all come into the unity of
[44:40] the faith and the knowledge of the Son
[44:43] of God
[44:45] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[44:50] the Statue of the fullness of Christ now
[44:53] has anybody seen this person yet that
[44:56] we're describing
[44:57] and this got to become the whole body
[44:59] but I just want to say it like this we
[45:01] need to be continue having the mindset
[45:04] of perfection and working the ministry
[45:06] and edifying the body until we see this
[45:08] transpire amen and in other words you
[45:12] don't do it until you feel like it when
[45:14] you don't feel like it this needs to
[45:15] become the purpose of the Christian
[45:18] because this is the reason that God sent
[45:19] a fful Ministry this is the reason that
[45:22] God gives the bread of
[45:24] life and here's the end result
[45:27] here he wants to get us away from being
[45:30] little
[45:31] children that we henceforth be no more
[45:35] children tossed to and fro carried
[45:39] about with every wind you ever you ever
[45:42] see a leaf in the wind and it blows from
[45:44] here and then over here and then over
[45:46] there just it's not
[45:47] stable the word of God is to stable the
[45:50] Christian amen it's to make them solid
[45:58] by the sight of men and the cunning
[46:00] craftiness whereby they lie in we to
[46:03] deceive we know that is just the enemy
[46:05] isn't that not right so God's goal for
[46:08] us is to speak the truth in love and
[46:11] that we may grow up into him in all
[46:15] things which is the head even Christ
[46:19] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[46:23] together compacted by every by that
[46:26] which which every joint supplieth to the
[46:29] effectual working in the measure of
[46:30] every part making increase of the body
[46:32] unto the edifying of itself you know
[46:34] verse 16 just seems to me like a
[46:37] machine like an automatic machine like
[46:39] automated
[46:42] automation we are all supposed to fit
[46:44] together
[46:47] amen not well you need to fit me and if
[46:49] you don't fit me it's your
[46:53] problem that ain't Christianity
[46:57] the whole body fitly joined
[47:02] together anybody ever try to put a piece
[47:05] of thread in a
[47:07] needle it's not easy you're going like
[47:10] this like I don't know how many times
[47:12] you're liing it you're trying to get it
[47:13] in
[47:16] there sometimes it's not very easy
[47:18] working with others with other
[47:22] Christians but you know what if you just
[47:25] speak the truth and Love and You grow up
[47:27] in Christ you can usually get it right
[47:28] in
[47:30] there the whole body fitly joined
[47:33] together every joint
[47:37] supplieth that means I need you to
[47:40] supply
[47:43] love grace
[47:47] mercy I need you to supply Christ
[47:49] because that's what my joint
[47:55] needs well I I think think we should
[47:57] have a Hallelujah on that one myself
[47:59] that's how I
[48:00] feel I know it's it's hard but you know
[48:03] what Christ supplies Christ the flesh
[48:07] supplies flesh Christ supplies
[48:11] Christ according to the effectual
[48:13] working the effectual working I mean
[48:16] some good things are happening when
[48:18] every joint is supplying the love of God
[48:21] effectual working in the measure of
[48:23] every part making an increase of the
[48:26] body
[48:29] amen it's not all about
[48:31] you it's not about you increasing it's
[48:35] about you having a heart for others if
[48:37] there's one thing I know about Jesus
[48:39] Christ it is this Christ lived for
[48:42] others
[48:44] amen if that is the nature that's inside
[48:47] of you that is Christ
[48:50] amen no greater love than a man have
[48:53] this and he lay down his life for his
[48:55] friends
[48:59] to the edifying of itself all right
[49:01] let's go back to John there John we're
[49:03] going to pick that up in verse number
[49:05] seven chapter
[49:08] 6 Philip answered
[49:10] him 200 penny worth of bread is not
[49:15] sufficient for them that everyone of
[49:18] them may take even a little and
[49:22] eat and one of his
[49:25] disciples and Andrew Simon
[49:28] Peter uh brother saith unto him there is
[49:32] a lad here which have five barley Loaves
[49:36] and two small fishes but what are they
[49:40] among so
[49:43] many and Jesus said make the men to sit
[49:46] down and I think in Luke we could find
[49:49] out that's in groups of 50 he had him
[49:52] sit down now there was much grass in the
[49:56] place
[49:57] so the men sat down in in number
[50:01] about
[50:03] 5,000 so we know here that there was
[50:05] 5,000
[50:07] men but if you go to Matthew you'll find
[50:10] out there was 5,000 men besides the
[50:13] women and the children so I want to tell
[50:15] you there is about 15 20 possibly 25,000
[50:21] people that are sitting in the grass in
[50:23] groups of
[50:24] 50 just want to get a a little concept
[50:27] of what this miracle really was and
[50:30] Jesus had compassion on the multitude
[50:33] because he saw them as as no one
[50:36] directed over their lives can you
[50:37] imagine somebody that is your
[50:41] headship that is just leading you all
[50:43] over the
[50:45] place can you imagine a president
[50:48] leading his
[50:54] country down the tubes
[50:57] nobody would want
[50:58] that nobody would want to work for a
[51:02] boss who the boss the only thing he
[51:04] thought about was
[51:05] himself and didn't care about the
[51:08] people we wouldn't want to go to a
[51:11] church where the pastor really didn't
[51:13] know what he was talking about or his
[51:16] only motive was to get money or a big
[51:19] following or who knows what he was
[51:25] after so Jesus J has compassion upon
[51:27] everybody's soul and he wants
[51:29] everybody's soul to follow the Right
[51:31] leader
[51:33] amen Paul said follow me as I follow
[51:37] Christ it's okay to follow somebody but
[51:40] I am telling you if they're not
[51:41] following Christ step
[51:44] back because Christ is not going to lead
[51:47] somebody who's being led by the devil to
[51:49] lead you to Christ in everything they do
[51:52] I'm saying God can't use them once in a
[51:54] while because he can he can use a donkey
[51:57] but be in in reality we need to get
[51:59] serious about
[52:01] leadership we need to get serious about
[52:03] leadership so Jesus made them to sit
[52:06] down where there was much grass and
[52:07] Psalms 23 tells us the Lord is my
[52:09] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[52:12] to lie down in Green Pastures amen he
[52:15] leadth me beside Still Waters he
[52:17] restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths
[52:20] of righteousness for his name's
[52:22] sake and I believe that Jesus really had
[52:27] a heart to help
[52:32] others he didn't have a heart to say
[52:34] look at me what I can do a heart to help
[52:38] others all right verse 11 and Jesus Took
[52:41] the
[52:41] loaves when he had given thanks he
[52:44] distributed to his disciples and his
[52:46] disciples to them that were set down and
[52:48] likewise of the fishes as many as they
[52:51] would whatever they wanted they could
[52:53] have can you imagine all you can eat
[52:55] smoggers Borg you ever go to smoggers
[52:57] Borg and you but you could only get one
[53:02] plate this is all you want you could
[53:04] have that's the God we serve amen we
[53:07] serve a god that is able to give us
[53:10] whatever we want right he said I'll do
[53:12] exceedingly above all that you would ask
[53:14] or even
[53:17] think and they the Bible says verse 12
[53:22] when they were filled
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:27] filled it takes a lot to be filled
[53:30] doesn't it it does I mean 20,000
[53:35] people come on that
[53:38] that's I don't think Franken MTH goes
[53:40] through that in a
[53:41] day when they were filled he said unto
[53:44] his disciples gather up the fragments
[53:46] that remain that nothing be
[53:50] lost now those that don't like leftovers
[53:55] we got to look at this scripture
[53:58] here gather up the fragments that remain
[54:01] that nothing be lost therefore they
[54:03] gathered them together and
[54:05] filled 12 baskets with the fragments of
[54:10] the five barley
[54:12] Loaves and the REM and which remained
[54:15] over and above that which they had
[54:21] eaten I just think this is an amazing
[54:25] miracle I would happen to believe if
[54:27] there were 25,000 people that there were
[54:29] many people that didn't see Jesus
[54:32] multiply the bread they were too far
[54:35] away but it
[54:39] happened and when the disciples went
[54:42] over there to that 4,000 people over
[54:45] there I'm sure they were
[54:48] saying Jesus created this
[54:51] bread and then they were there thinking
[54:54] did he really do it because I didn't see
[54:55] it
[54:57] imagine there were some Phillips wasn't
[55:01] it Phillip I won't believe Oh Thomas
[55:04] that's right it was Thomas I won't
[55:06] believe unless I see and I feel and
[55:10] we're here as Believers today we're not
[55:12] here as
[55:13] sightseers or feelers we're here as
[55:16] Believers in the
[55:18] church if one
[55:21] lad could eat two fishes and Five Loaves
[55:26] of of
[55:28] bread through my
[55:30] calculations Jesus probably created
[55:33] 40,000 to 50,000
[55:36] fish and 100,000 to
[55:39] 125,000 loaves of bread for about 20,000
[55:45] people this was no small miracle that
[55:48] happened this was a big
[55:52] thing and I'll say it like this God took
[55:56] something that was so small now do you
[55:59] think he really even needed the boy's
[56:04] lunch to do what he
[56:06] did he created heavens and
[56:09] earth but he used the boy's
[56:15] lunch he took something that was so
[56:19] little would look
[56:22] insufficient to meet the need amen
[56:29] little is sufficient if God is in
[56:32] it little is all you need if God is in
[56:36] it you don't need anything great you
[56:38] don't need anything big you don't need
[56:40] about to see it you just need to get God
[56:41] in your
[56:44] problems God in your
[56:48] problems if God is able to take five
[56:51] loaves of bread and two fish and make it
[56:53] sufficient enough to feed 20,000 people
[56:56] then don't you think that God is
[56:58] sufficient enough to meet every possible
[57:01] need you would
[57:03] have
[57:07] amen that's we're serving the same God
[57:10] he's not here in a natural form but he
[57:13] is here in a spiritual
[57:15] form and all he's looking is for someone
[57:19] to because as he wanted to prove to
[57:21] Phillip and The Disciples of just how
[57:24] great he is God wants to prove to us
[57:28] right and he wants us to take him at his
[57:32] word he doesn't want us to look at our
[57:34] abilities how much money we got how much
[57:37] popularity we got how many friends we
[57:40] got he wants us to recognize that we are
[57:43] insufficient of what we have to do
[57:46] anything and our sufficiency is of god
[57:49] am and that is
[57:51] enough that is
[57:54] enough if you could have Faith as a
[57:57] grain of mustard seed you can say unto
[57:59] this mountain be thou removed am little
[58:01] is sufficient if God is in
[58:05] it Philippians 4:19 says but my God
[58:10] shall
[58:11] supply all your
[58:14] need according to his riches in Glory by
[58:19] Christ
[58:20] Jesus I like the way Paul said that he
[58:23] said my God
[58:26] my God shall supply all your
[58:30] need and that's the god that we need to
[58:34] look to to supply our needs if we're
[58:36] ever going to grow and become into the
[58:40] statue of a perfect man or or be able to
[58:43] handle situations better and I I'm all
[58:46] for falling I
[58:49] am because it's impossible for us not to
[58:53] fall what's important is that when we
[58:55] fall we get back back up if a righteous
[58:58] man falls seven times seven times he'll
[59:00] get back up God wants us to grow how are
[59:02] we going to grow if we don't make
[59:04] mistakes we don't fall but we got to
[59:06] start looking to him to supply our needs
[59:08] amen you know what God wants us to
[59:12] do just for a
[59:15] second God tells us pay your
[59:20] ties you know what that means to
[59:23] somebody to give a little bit of money
[59:25] in the office offering once in a while
[59:28] that's what that means to some
[59:34] people but we're promised that if we do
[59:37] our part that our barns will just
[59:41] overflow and that we'll have to build
[59:43] new
[59:45] barns I never made that promise and I
[59:47] never concocted the idea that's just
[59:49] what I found in the word of
[59:52] God and you think about the little bit
[59:55] that you you got to give to God
[59:58] Faithfully that little
[1:00:01] bit that little
[1:00:05] bit we hang on
[1:00:09] to is what could be the difference of
[1:00:13] being blessed by
[1:00:16] God look if I told you look I want you
[1:00:19] to give me $100 and by next week
[1:00:21] Wednesday you come here I'll I'll make
[1:00:23] sure you got a thousand
[1:00:26] you would sayyou know what that sounds
[1:00:29] like a good
[1:00:30] deal James would be coming to me in the
[1:00:32] office in the back and he' say can I
[1:00:34] borrow 100 bucks from you I want to give
[1:00:35] it to
[1:00:38] you we would do that it's a good
[1:00:42] deal but if we don't believe that we'll
[1:00:45] be blessed by giving ties we won't give
[1:00:47] our
[1:00:48] ties and I'm not saying we should ever
[1:00:51] give money because of getting blessed
[1:00:52] I'm not saying that I'm just saying God
[1:00:56] blesses you for obeying his
[1:01:02] word little is sufficient if God is in
[1:01:05] it amen doesn't matter how little you
[1:01:08] got God will bless you amen let's when
[1:01:13] Sarah laughed remember Sarah she laughed
[1:01:16] within herself about conceiving a child
[1:01:19] in her old age the Lord said un to
[1:01:22] Abraham is there anything too hard for
[1:01:25] the the Lord is
[1:01:28] there not one thing is too hard for God
[1:01:32] but for what for whatever re reason we
[1:01:34] lose contact with God and we try to
[1:01:37] start handling things
[1:01:39] ourselves now Sarah didn't have much to
[1:01:41] work
[1:01:42] with she was an old AG sister with a
[1:01:46] dead
[1:01:47] womb there was no medical help for her
[1:01:51] there was no scientific help for
[1:01:54] her everything was stacked against her
[1:01:59] she had little to work
[1:02:02] with but little is sufficient if God is
[1:02:05] in
[1:02:08] it and if God speaks to
[1:02:11] you and says it's going to happen you're
[1:02:14] a child of the king we sung about it
[1:02:16] then you believe it if you believe God's
[1:02:18] going to take care of you you believe it
[1:02:21] amen because you just need his word on
[1:02:23] it and my God shall supply all your
[1:02:27] need is there anything too hard for the
[1:02:34] Lord God we we you know we can actually
[1:02:36] take a god who's capable of doing
[1:02:39] exceedingly above all that we could ask
[1:02:41] and think we can take an amazing God who
[1:02:43] created the Earth that we stand on eat
[1:02:45] the food he created we can take an
[1:02:48] amazing God like that and we can
[1:02:50] handcuff him to where he can't move in
[1:02:53] our life because of unbelief
[1:02:57] now Abraham's testimony in Romans 4:20
[1:03:01] says he staggered not at the promise of
[1:03:04] God through unbelief but was strong in
[1:03:07] faith giving glory to God you ever go
[1:03:11] through a trial and you're just feeling
[1:03:13] like I don't feel like praising
[1:03:17] God come on now it's time to wake up in
[1:03:20] church
[1:03:21] today we're CH we're we're we're
[1:03:23] children
[1:03:25] of Abraham amen he staggered not at the
[1:03:29] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:03:31] strong in faith giving glory to God you
[1:03:35] want to know if you're strong in the
[1:03:36] faith you're praising God in your
[1:03:40] trial because it you know you got to go
[1:03:43] beyond how you feel you got to go beyond
[1:03:46] what you can see you got to go beyond
[1:03:48] what you can hear and you're looking to
[1:03:50] the Unseen through eyes of faith and
[1:03:54] Just Praise Him for the finished product
[1:03:56] you know what I'm so glad that there's a
[1:03:58] God that we can serve he's a real God am
[1:04:02] he's not some picture on a wall he's
[1:04:04] some not some religion but there's a
[1:04:06] realness to almighty God that you can
[1:04:09] you can serve with all your
[1:04:11] heart and being fully persuaded that
[1:04:16] what he had promised what God had
[1:04:18] promised he was able also to
[1:04:23] perform God is able
[1:04:28] sometimes all we have to all we have to
[1:04:30] hang on to is a promise in his word we
[1:04:33] don't even hear it like an audible
[1:04:35] voice we don't have a dream we don't
[1:04:38] have a prophecy alls we have is a
[1:04:42] promise in the word amen to hang on to
[1:04:46] and it seems so
[1:04:48] little but I'll say it like this little
[1:04:51] is sufficient if God is in it and he is
[1:04:53] in his word
[1:04:55] we can have confidence in that and we
[1:04:58] need to be looking to the word to take
[1:05:00] care of our
[1:05:01] needs care of our problems is there
[1:05:04] anything too hard for the
[1:05:05] Lord Jeremiah
[1:05:08] 32:17 Jeremiah 32:17 we were close to
[1:05:11] that in Jeremiah
[1:05:13] 29 ah Lord God behold thou has made the
[1:05:17] Heaven and the Earth by thy great power
[1:05:22] and stretched out arm and there there is
[1:05:26] nothing too hard for thee what a
[1:05:30] testimony now we would we would it would
[1:05:33] do us good if we literally got up and we
[1:05:35] read that scripture every day than
[1:05:38] wondering how in the world we're going
[1:05:39] to get out of our
[1:05:41] problems we just need to testify about
[1:05:45] how great God is there is no situation
[1:05:48] that is too difficult for God to handle
[1:05:51] not one when our our backs remember the
[1:05:55] the children children of Israel their
[1:05:57] backs well I don't know if their backs I
[1:06:00] think their their back was facing
[1:06:02] Pharaoh's Army and they were staring at
[1:06:05] the Red Sea and they had no place to go
[1:06:10] right but what they did have is they had
[1:06:13] god with them they had the word of God
[1:06:16] and the word of God now God never told
[1:06:19] the children of Israel hey when you
[1:06:21] leave when you leave out of Egypt I'm
[1:06:23] going to have I'm going to put you right
[1:06:25] in the
[1:06:26] pickle and you're you're not you're not
[1:06:28] going to you're not going to know what
[1:06:30] to
[1:06:31] do he didn't say
[1:06:34] that because he wants to prove himself
[1:06:37] we cannot expect God to tell us how to
[1:06:40] fix our problems he brings us to the Red
[1:06:43] Sea he brings us to uh Wilderness
[1:06:46] experiences for the purpose to prove
[1:06:49] himself and to prove us whether we're
[1:06:51] going to trust him and whether we're
[1:06:52] going to believe and I'll say it like
[1:06:55] this
[1:06:57] God knew what he was going to do when
[1:06:58] they got into the Red Sea just like he
[1:07:00] he knew what he was going to do with the
[1:07:01] children of Israel or like what he was
[1:07:03] going to do with his disciples with the
[1:07:05] with the boy's lunch he knew what he was
[1:07:07] going to
[1:07:09] do little is sufficient of God's in it
[1:07:13] they didn't need a bridge that went over
[1:07:14] the Red
[1:07:15] Sea they didn't need a map to go some
[1:07:18] other way what they needed is a
[1:07:21] relationship with God to trust God
[1:07:22] that's what we need today we need a
[1:07:24] relationship with God that'll help us to
[1:07:26] trust him
[1:07:28] more the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians
[1:07:32] 9:8 that God is able to make all grace
[1:07:37] abound towards you that you may always
[1:07:40] having all sufficiency in all things may
[1:07:44] abound to every good work God is able to
[1:07:48] do this for
[1:07:49] you I can't do that for
[1:07:52] myself I can't Supply everybody need I
[1:07:56] can't do that but God
[1:07:59] can you know the song goes I can't make
[1:08:02] the Stars to shine I can't make the moon
[1:08:04] to shine I I can't I can't make the moon
[1:08:07] to I can't make the wind to
[1:08:11] blow I can't heal bodies brother B often
[1:08:16] said I can't heal man doctors can't heal
[1:08:21] they can put together they can take out
[1:08:24] but it takes God to
[1:08:26] heal and God is our provider he's
[1:08:28] Jehovah Gyra God is able to make all
[1:08:31] Grace sufficient to your personal life
[1:08:33] to your needs I mean if we want to see
[1:08:37] God more in our life then we need to to
[1:08:39] trust God with what little we have and
[1:08:41] what little we have is
[1:08:44] God we have God that's all we need we
[1:08:47] don't need some Arnold short singer with
[1:08:50] his built and you know his ability to to
[1:08:54] fly here here and there and superm's and
[1:08:57] Batman's and all the mans out there we
[1:09:00] have Jesus Christ he's our man amen amen
[1:09:04] it's all we need little is sufficient if
[1:09:07] God is in he's all we need Philippians
[1:09:09] 4:13 says I can do all things through
[1:09:13] Christ which strengtheneth
[1:09:15] me I'm okay with being
[1:09:20] dumb I
[1:09:22] am I I am okay with that I've always
[1:09:25] been okay with
[1:09:28] that because the more talent you have
[1:09:32] the more you begin to you
[1:09:34] know depend on your
[1:09:39] talent and to be honest with you I want
[1:09:42] to be able to do everything through
[1:09:43] Christ
[1:09:45] amen everything through Christ he
[1:09:48] deserves the glory for it all
[1:09:51] anyways with what little I have I can do
[1:09:56] all things because little is sufficient
[1:09:59] if God is in it real some quick
[1:10:02] scriptures here before we get to a story
[1:10:04] I want to spend a few minutes on Jude
[1:10:06] 1:24 says God is able to keep you from
[1:10:09] falling you talk about sufficiency God
[1:10:12] is the one that keeps you from falling
[1:10:14] amen James 1:21 that the word of God is
[1:10:18] able to save your soul that's a good one
[1:10:20] for brother Ryan here God the word of
[1:10:24] God is able to save our
[1:10:27] souls 2 Timothy 1:12 for the which cause
[1:10:31] I also suffer these things nevertheless
[1:10:34] I am not ashamed for I know in whom I
[1:10:37] have
[1:10:38] believed and am persuaded that he he is
[1:10:43] able to keep that which I have committed
[1:10:46] unto him unto him against that
[1:10:50] day I'm so glad that I have someone
[1:10:53] watching over my soul amen
[1:10:56] he's the keeper of my soul he's the
[1:10:58] Lover of My Soul he is the soul
[1:11:03] maker he's the one that's going to take
[1:11:06] us through yes but what we have to do is
[1:11:09] commit oursel to him amen commit the
[1:11:11] soul to him amen not just commit
[1:11:14] salvation to
[1:11:15] him commit our soul to him commit commit
[1:11:19] our life to him am and then he'll keep
[1:11:22] us Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is
[1:11:26] able you can write this one down if
[1:11:28] you'd like now unto him that is able to
[1:11:30] do exceedingly abundantly
[1:11:33] above everything all that we could ask
[1:11:36] or think according to the power that
[1:11:40] worketh where in us you know there's a
[1:11:45] power in
[1:11:46] us that's not of
[1:11:48] ourselves there's a power in us that's
[1:11:51] not of ourselves it's of God he is the
[1:11:54] one that keeps us amen all right 2
[1:11:58] Corinthians
[1:11:59] 12:7 we'll have to go through this kind
[1:12:01] of fast second Corinthians 12:7 and this
[1:12:05] is here the story of Paul talking again
[1:12:08] about the sufficiency and lest I should
[1:12:11] remember he was one that had a lot of
[1:12:14] Revelations is caught up to the third
[1:12:16] heaven and God blessed him to to what so
[1:12:19] much word that he had confidence that he
[1:12:21] wrote 14 books of the Bible that you and
[1:12:23] I basically Liv by we live by amen
[1:12:28] andless I should be exalted above
[1:12:31] measure through the abundance of
[1:12:33] Revelations there was given to me a
[1:12:36] thorn in the flesh does anybody have a
[1:12:42] thorn in the
[1:12:46] flesh a thorn in the flesh the messenger
[1:12:49] of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[1:12:53] exalted above measure
[1:12:55] for this thing for this thing I besought
[1:12:59] the Lord three times that he would just
[1:13:02] take it away from
[1:13:07] me and he said unto me my grace is
[1:13:11] really what's sufficient for
[1:13:14] you for my strength is made perfect in
[1:13:18] your
[1:13:19] situation my strength is made perfect in
[1:13:23] weakness most gladly therefore I rather
[1:13:26] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:13:28] of Christ May rest upon me therefore I
[1:13:31] take pleasure in infirmities in
[1:13:34] reproaches and necessities and
[1:13:35] persecutions and distress what for
[1:13:37] Christ's sake it needs to be for the
[1:13:40] reason of Christ though for when I am
[1:13:42] weak then I am strong amen now the whole
[1:13:46] world is suffering but they're not
[1:13:47] suffering for Christ's
[1:13:53] sake but when it's talking about the
[1:13:56] furtherance of the kingdom of God or the
[1:13:58] furtherance of coming to the Statue of a
[1:14:00] perfect man we should take pleasure and
[1:14:03] the the things that we go
[1:14:05] through and Jesus Is Telling Paul here
[1:14:09] that my grace is sufficient for
[1:14:12] thee God was teaching Paul to recognize
[1:14:15] that there was something greater than
[1:14:17] every need that he had in his life and
[1:14:20] that need was God's grace that's what
[1:14:22] was
[1:14:23] sufficient they don't need need to look
[1:14:25] to your own abilities little is enough
[1:14:30] little is enough if God is in it amen
[1:14:34] and God was also teaching Paul how to be
[1:14:37] content because he prayed three times
[1:14:40] here's the prophet of God he wanted it
[1:14:42] for the right reasons and God said
[1:14:47] no after three times of praying I
[1:14:51] believe God was also teaching Paul how
[1:14:55] to be
[1:14:57] content he says here in Philippians 4:11
[1:15:00] not that I speak in respect of want for
[1:15:03] I have learned in whatsoever State I am
[1:15:05] in there with to be
[1:15:08] content I like how the NIV puts this he
[1:15:11] says I know what it what it is to be in
[1:15:14] need Paul says I know what it is to be
[1:15:17] in need for I have learned to be content
[1:15:20] with whatsoever the circumstance
[1:15:25] you talk about the power of
[1:15:28] God is learning to trust God that much
[1:15:31] and you know something you got to learn
[1:15:33] you're not born with that amen all right
[1:15:35] let's try to look at this last story
[1:15:37] before we leave it's in 1 Corinthians
[1:15:39] chapter or 1 Samuel chapter 16 this is a
[1:15:42] story of David
[1:15:44] here David when he's chosen to be
[1:15:50] king what I like about this story is
[1:15:53] that there was nothing in it that David
[1:15:57] had that really shows his sufficiency of
[1:16:01] himself but he was just one that trusted
[1:16:06] God and starting off with verse verse
[1:16:09] one and the Lord said unto Samuel how
[1:16:11] long will thou mourn for Saul seeing I
[1:16:15] have rejected him from reigning over
[1:16:18] Israel fill thy horn with oil and go I
[1:16:22] will send thee to Jesse the betham for I
[1:16:25] have provided me a king among his
[1:16:29] sons and Samuel said how can I go if
[1:16:33] Saul hears about it he will kill me and
[1:16:37] the Lord said take a heer with thee and
[1:16:41] say I am come to sacrifice to the
[1:16:47] Lord the Lord has his way of getting the
[1:16:51] thing done
[1:16:53] right and called Jesse to the sacrifice
[1:16:57] and I will show thee what Thou shalt do
[1:17:02] and thou shall anoint unto me him whom I
[1:17:06] name unto thee what I love about this is
[1:17:09] God did not even tell his profit
[1:17:12] everything he didn't just do this be
[1:17:16] faithful with this when you get done
[1:17:18] doing this I will meet you here and I
[1:17:20] will tell you what to do
[1:17:23] next we don't need to know
[1:17:26] everything we need to be faithful with
[1:17:28] what God tells us to
[1:17:31] do and Samuel did that which the Lord
[1:17:35] spake and came to Bethlehem and the
[1:17:38] Elders of the Town actually trembled at
[1:17:41] his coming and said you you come you are
[1:17:44] you coming peacefully is everything okay
[1:17:47] and he said peacefully I am come to
[1:17:50] sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify
[1:17:52] yourselves and come with me to the
[1:17:54] sacrifice
[1:17:55] and he Sanctified Jesse and his sons and
[1:17:57] called them to the sacrifice and it came
[1:18:00] to pass when they were come that he
[1:18:02] looked on elab
[1:18:06] Eli and said
[1:18:09] surely the Lord's anointed is before him
[1:18:15] now this is the
[1:18:18] Prophet this is this is the one
[1:18:27] and the Lord said unto
[1:18:30] Samuel here it is brother Ron you quoted
[1:18:32] it in men me look not on his countenance
[1:18:36] or his
[1:18:38] height or the statue because I have
[1:18:41] refused him for the Lord seeth not as
[1:18:46] man seeth for man lookth on the outward
[1:18:50] appearance but the Lord lookth on the
[1:18:53] heart remember David was a man after
[1:18:57] God's Own
[1:18:58] Heart isn't that beautiful you can come
[1:19:00] to church and be a man after God's Own
[1:19:04] Heart I think that's one thing that God
[1:19:07] wants us to give more to him is a heart
[1:19:10] amen then Jesse called aadab and made
[1:19:14] him pass before Samuel and he said
[1:19:16] neither have the Lord chosen this then
[1:19:20] Jesse made shama to pass by and he said
[1:19:24] said neither have the Lord chosen this
[1:19:27] again Jesse made Seven of his sons to
[1:19:30] pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto
[1:19:33] Jesse the Lord have not chosen
[1:19:37] these
[1:19:39] wow and Samuel said unto Jesse are here
[1:19:43] all thy sons and he said There remaineth
[1:19:47] Yet the
[1:19:49] youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep
[1:19:52] and Samuel said unto Jesse send forth
[1:19:54] and tou him for we will not sit down
[1:19:57] till he come
[1:19:59] hither Samuel was there on a
[1:20:02] mission and he sent and brought him in
[1:20:06] now he was
[1:20:08] Ruddy he was
[1:20:11] readyy and with all of a beautiful
[1:20:15] countenance and goodly to look to and
[1:20:19] the Lord said arise anoint him for this
[1:20:22] is he and Samuel took the Horn of oil
[1:20:25] and anointed him in the midst of the
[1:20:26] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[1:20:28] Upon David from that day forward so
[1:20:31] Samuel rose up and went to
[1:20:34] Rama I'll just say it like this in
[1:20:37] everybody's mind David was not the
[1:20:40] guy he didn't look the part he didn't
[1:20:43] even play the part but you know what he
[1:20:45] had the heart of the part he had the
[1:20:48] heart of a
[1:20:50] part his
[1:20:52] heart and I'll say it like this
[1:20:55] God is teaching Samuel don't look at the
[1:20:58] outside but look at the
[1:21:02] heart man looks on the outside God looks
[1:21:05] on the heart and when I thought about
[1:21:08] this story I thought you know what
[1:21:11] little is sufficient if God is in
[1:21:15] it the other brothers were they were
[1:21:17] bigger they were taller they were
[1:21:20] stronger but God wasn't in that God
[1:21:24] isn't in a
[1:21:26] ability God's in the
[1:21:29] heart I think about David's
[1:21:32] life David was in trouble with a bear
[1:21:37] with a lion with Goliath he was in
[1:21:40] trouble with Saul even his own men
[1:21:42] rejected him as a king he became the
[1:21:45] rejected King he really didn't have a
[1:21:47] lot going for him but you know what his
[1:21:50] sufficiency was in
[1:21:53] Christ he trusted in God and we can do
[1:21:57] that you
[1:21:59] know David was King for quite a
[1:22:03] while while there was Saul was still
[1:22:05] there and Saul was not a very humble man
[1:22:08] was
[1:22:10] he he was a proud
[1:22:12] man and he actually wanted to kill
[1:22:16] David and David didn't do anything
[1:22:19] wrong the Bible says that God that evil
[1:22:22] spirit went from the Lord unto Saul to
[1:22:26] to to torment
[1:22:28] him and David actually God gave David a
[1:22:33] gift and then a desire to help Saul to
[1:22:36] calm him
[1:22:38] down it was like
[1:22:41] God had this whole thing in in in motion
[1:22:47] of what he was doing and it took time
[1:22:50] and it wasn't just David was King and
[1:22:52] okay we kick Saul out and you know we
[1:22:54] got a new president it didn't happen
[1:22:55] like
[1:23:01] that but if we can learn anything from
[1:23:04] the story of David's
[1:23:06] life that David didn't have a lot of
[1:23:10] backing he didn't have a lot of
[1:23:13] help he didn't have a lot going for him
[1:23:16] in fact I when I look at David's life I
[1:23:18] say he had more problems and trials than
[1:23:21] he ever had victories
[1:23:25] but you know his character grew quite a
[1:23:30] bit he didn't only get himself in
[1:23:33] trouble he he got in trouble by by so
[1:23:36] many
[1:23:38] means but God provided for him through
[1:23:42] every
[1:23:43] situation little is sufficient if God is
[1:23:46] in it let's Stand Together little is
[1:23:49] sufficient if God is in it
[1:23:55] I want God in my
[1:23:57] life I want to start trusting him
[1:24:04] more you know most everything we do we
[1:24:06] do by
[1:24:09] feel I feel like pizza
[1:24:12] tonight you do too okay I feel like a
[1:24:16] Hershey bar I
