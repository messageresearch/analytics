[36:40] Father we thank you that you've placed a
[36:43] desire in our heart whether we're live
[36:46] streaming or whether we're here Lord to
[36:51] want to grow in the things of God to
[36:53] want to make sure that we're we're ready
[36:57] and to allow that word to vindicate
[37:01] we're ready to meet you Lord father we
[37:05] pray this morning that your great Holy
[37:08] Spirit would come and deal with every
[37:11] one of us Lord it's only you can our
[37:15] words they they fail Lord even if we
[37:20] speak your word but it's not your spirit
[37:23] speaking it Lord it can fail as well but
[37:29] Lord when your word anointed is spoken
[37:33] by you Lord it can deal with our hearts
[37:37] and bring us to the statue of a perfect
[37:39] man and we pray that you take this time
[37:42] Lord that we were placing in your hands
[37:46] and asked you to take this precious word
[37:49] that's eternal and make it real to us
[37:53] make it alive in this give us revelation
[37:56] of it Lord we have prepared our hearts
[37:59] the best we could we've worshipped you
[38:01] in spirit and in truth and now Lord we
[38:04] place ourselves on the altar we ask that
[38:07] you would give us revelation of the
[38:09] things that you speak to us today we
[38:11] give you the glory and honor for it as
[38:14] we son that song in the name of Jesus
[38:16] Christ amen amen praise the Lord
[38:20] Saint John chapter 17 verse starting
[38:23] with verse number 20 neither Jesus in
[38:27] his great prayer here in the upper room
[38:29] before he gets ready to separate from
[38:36] his disciples and there was a concern
[38:38] that he had he says neither pray I for
[38:43] these alone but for them also which
[38:48] shall believe on me through their word
[38:51] that they all may be one as thou father
[38:55] art me and I in thee that they also may
[38:59] be one in us that the world may believe
[39:03] that thou has sent me and the glory
[39:06] which thou has gave us me I have given
[39:10] to them that there that they may be one
[39:14] even as we are one I in them and thou in
[39:19] me that they may be made perfect in one
[39:23] that the world may know that thou has
[39:26] sent me and has loved them as thou has
[39:30] loved me praise the Lord then
[39:33] revelations chapter 22 starting with
[39:38] verse number 17
[39:49] as a very big prayer that Jesus was
[39:54] praying for a oneness with any eternal
[39:57] God and human beings but Jesus I thank
[40:04] thee father because thou always hears
[40:07] answers my prayers amen verse 17 in the
[40:11] spirit and the bride say come and let
[40:15] him that heareth say come and let him
[40:19] that is athirst come and whosoever will
[40:22] let him take of the waters of life
[40:25] freely fry testifying to every man that
[40:27] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[40:29] this book If any man shall add unto the
[40:32] things God shall add unto Him the
[40:34] plagues that are written in this book
[40:36] and if any man shall take away from the
[40:38] words of the book of this prophecy God
[40:40] shall take away his part out of the book
[40:45] of life and out of the holy city and
[40:47] from the things which are written in
[40:49] this book
[40:50] he which testify if these things say
[40:55] surely I come quickly amen even so come
[41:00] Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus
[41:02] Christ be with you all amen
[41:06] and God bless you may be seated we want
[41:08] to entitle this message it's time it's
[41:12] time for our subject becoming one with
[41:16] God it's time to begin to manifest
[41:22] Christ more more amen because we don't
[41:29] want to be satisfied with how much we
[41:32] are manifesting Christ what I think
[41:34] about the there is a a group that
[41:40] doesn't go on a rapture then waits a
[41:43] thousand years go through the white
[41:45] throne judgment some are saved and some
[41:48] are not now the ones that are saved
[41:50] there was a part that they missed out on
[41:55] they missed out on the thousand-year
[41:57] reign they missed out on the honeymoon
[41:59] miss out on being the bride so there was
[42:02] a part that was taken out of the book of
[42:04] life so we don't we we don't want to
[42:08] miss anything that God has for us amen
[42:11] now here Jesus in st. John chapter 17
[42:15] was praying now Jesus was a man that
[42:18] believed in prayer before he went to
[42:21] Calvary he was preparing his disciples
[42:23] for his his natural separation he said
[42:27] I'm going to be crucified he says let
[42:29] not your heart be troubled leaving me he
[42:32] says I'm going to send you a comforter
[42:34] and it will be me in the form of the
[42:38] Holy Ghost amen
[42:40] and there's many things I want to say to
[42:42] you right now you really need need to
[42:44] hear them but you can't handle it right
[42:47] now but when the Holy Spirit comes when
[42:51] I come in the form of the Holy Spirit
[42:53] I'm going to be inside of you and you're
[42:55] not going to easily be offended you're
[42:58] going to be able to take what I'm saying
[43:01] to you because I'm on the inside the
[43:03] view of it just on the outside you can't
[43:05] handle it and when I come back in the
[43:12] form of the Holy Spirit I'm going to
[43:14] lead and guide you into all truth for
[43:17] the spirit of truth will not speak of
[43:21] himself this is so wonderful because you
[43:26] know there's a good indication we can
[43:28] figure out what Spirit is doing is
[43:31] speaking to us if it's speaking of God
[43:32] or if it's speaking of itself amen
[43:36] because you can be speaking the Word of
[43:38] God but yet speaking yourself jesus said
[43:43] in Saint John 15:15 I have called you
[43:47] friends for all things that I have heard
[43:50] of my father I have made known auntie
[43:53] isn't that wonderful that we can be so
[43:55] close to God that he just he shares
[43:58] everything there's a oneness amen
[44:00] he says you have not chosen me but I've
[44:02] chosen you and I've ordained you that
[44:04] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[44:07] that your fruit should remain now
[44:11] whatsoever he
[44:12] he shall ask of the Father in my name he
[44:16] may give it to you these things I
[44:18] command you that you love one another
[44:22] God has chosen us to be one with him not
[44:27] just to be saved or make it to heaven
[44:31] no God chose us to be one with him one
[44:35] in purpose to be in the same image that
[44:39] God created Adam in God chose us from
[44:43] the foundation of the world to bear his
[44:46] fruit and that that fruit would continue
[44:49] being fruity so other people can see it
[44:58] he ordained us from the beginning to
[45:02] love one another everyone exactly the
[45:07] way he loves everyone not partial even
[45:12] the enemies when we were originally in
[45:16] the mind of God we were manifested in
[45:19] his likeness in the likeness of God just
[45:22] like Adam was when God said let us make
[45:24] man in our image he visualized Adam
[45:29] being just like him he didn't it wasn't
[45:35] like well let's make in our image and
[45:40] like opening the back a box of Cracker
[45:43] Jacks and and we wonder what the prize
[45:45] is going to be when you get down to the
[45:47] bottom of it no Jesus knew exactly what
[45:50] Adam would be there was no doubts no
[45:54] questions he was he had in his mind to
[45:59] be a mini creator have dominion over
[46:03] everything even the most subtle beast to
[46:07] have power to what to love to submit to
[46:12] the Word of God to obey the Word of God
[46:14] to be grateful to be thankful amen to do
[46:19] the will of him who
[46:22] hated him there was a complete oneness
[46:27] between Adam and God Adam
[46:31] a spirit man also manifested in the
[46:34] flesh and perfect harmony and oneness
[46:37] with his God now when we were in God's
[46:41] mind before there was ever world God
[46:43] visualized us being one with him in the
[46:46] same way he knew same love same
[46:53] submission same gratefulness
[46:56] thankfulness everything was the same but
[47:01] he knew it wouldn't be that way because
[47:05] we would be boring pervertedly and when
[47:09] we were born pervertedly that just
[47:11] messed everything up our will became
[47:15] selfish we were filled with hatred we
[47:18] were proud we wanted to do our own will
[47:21] we didn't want to do the will of our
[47:23] Father who created us so we were born
[47:28] unacceptably to God but it never changed
[47:32] his original plan in his mind he
[47:36] provided a way for us to be born again
[47:38] with a new nature to take on what he
[47:41] originally planned from the beginning to
[47:45] act like he act to love like he loved to
[47:48] do his will were born by the will of God
[47:52] it's the only acceptable way the Bible
[47:55] says that by one spirit we're all
[47:56] baptized into the body Christ and it is
[48:01] God's holy spirit that makes us one with
[48:05] God makes us United with God his Spirit
[48:09] transforms our minds the way that we
[48:11] think we begin to think like him that's
[48:15] why Paul said in Philippians chapter 2
[48:17] verse 5 let this mind that was in Christ
[48:20] that this might be new which also was in
[48:23] Christ Jesus we can't have the mind of
[48:26] God we just got to get rid of ours can't
[48:31] put a boat there there's that room for
[48:32] both people who thinks two different
[48:36] ways a double minded man he's unstable
[48:38] in all his ways so what kind of mind is
[48:42] that kind of spirit is that and Paul
[48:48] said let this mind be in you which was
[48:49] also in Christ Jesus
[48:50] what kind of mind is that Paul defines
[48:54] and describes and helps us clearly
[48:56] understand the mind of Christ in
[48:58] Philippians chapter 2 turn with me if
[49:01] you would they're the footings chapter 2
[49:03] as we read this take note this is
[49:05] exactly what God had in his mind when he
[49:08] had you in his mind at the beginning
[49:10] before the foundation of the world he
[49:11] visualized his mind in you and this is
[49:15] exactly what Jesus was praying for in
[49:18] st. John chapter 17 that there would be
[49:20] a oneness between them you can't be one
[49:23] with Christ and not have the mind of
[49:25] Christ you know where would we be
[49:28] without the blood of Christ to cleanse
[49:31] us and it the blood of Christ makes us
[49:35] one by covering us but we still need to
[49:42] be filled with the life that was in that
[49:44] blood in order to think like him to act
[49:47] like him to talk like him so he says
[49:51] here in flipping chapter 2 verse number
[49:53] 2 fulfil ye my joy that ye be
[49:56] like-minded having the same love being
[49:59] of one Accord and a19 this is the mind
[50:04] of Christ and this is the oneness
[50:08] like-minded same as the mind of Christ
[50:11] the same love as Christ being of one
[50:14] Accord Amen I just love this word Jesus
[50:20] said I and then and now in me that they
[50:23] may be perfect in one this is we need
[50:27] the mind of Christ for this to be
[50:29] fulfilled it's so it's a reality the way
[50:33] we think is very important the things
[50:35] that we let go through our mind the
[50:37] things we think about the things that we
[50:39] we say about the things that we
[50:41] thinking they're important they're
[50:42] either showing one ship with Christ or
[50:45] they're just your opinion let me just
[50:51] say this God knows every evil that's
[50:54] happening on the planet and every second
[50:57] of the day but he doesn't go around
[51:01] thinking about it talking about it well
[51:03] and on it so just because we're speaking
[51:08] truth it doesn't mean it's a good report
[51:12] it doesn't mean we should be there with
[51:15] that all right let nothing verse three
[51:19] let nothing be done through strife or
[51:21] vainglory but in lowliness of mine this
[51:27] is the mind of Christ lowliness of mind
[51:30] let each esteem other better than
[51:33] themselves know contents and others
[51:40] rather condescend to men of low estate
[51:43] condescend yourself to get down where
[51:46] they're at and help them this is the
[51:48] mind of Christ in other words let
[51:51] nothing be done in your fleshly carnal
[51:54] selfish powerful nature but when god's
[51:58] new nature inside thinking of yourself
[52:00] more humbly mourn worthily but in
[52:05] lowliness of mind let each esteem other
[52:07] better than themselves now that's a big
[52:11] big challenge for some people all they
[52:17] can say is get more of the Holy Ghost
[52:18] and it won't be such a challenge look
[52:24] not every man on his own things but
[52:28] every man also on the things of others
[52:32] somewhere down the road in our journey
[52:34] from here to the promised land we need
[52:37] to put a halt to thinking about
[52:41] ourselves to talking about ourselves
[52:46] planning about ourselves we need to stop
[52:51] we need to put a halt to it it's not the
[52:54] mind of Christ it's not about us you
[52:58] know you take away some people you take
[53:00] away then talking about themselves and
[53:03] they don't got nothing to talk about
[53:08] let every one of us in this church be
[53:12] thinking praying caring and doing things
[53:16] for others she that's the message to
[53:19] this church the promised land is filled
[53:23] with living for others nothing short of
[53:30] that eternal light is living for others
[53:33] this is the mind of Christ this is the
[53:35] mind of the bride and the spirit and the
[53:39] bride say come there is a unity in the
[53:42] way that they think let this mind be in
[53:45] you which was also in Christ Jesus it
[53:50] can be done don't say it's hard for me
[53:56] start believing him start reading the
[54:00] Bible more started saying lord help me
[54:02] to be humble like you are help me not to
[54:05] exalt myself against you lord your will
[54:09] who being in the form of God thought it
[54:11] not robbery to be equal with God Jesus
[54:16] did not think his nature was different
[54:19] than his father's he knew where he came
[54:25] from who he was he had a revelation he
[54:29] said I come from God I go back to God
[54:32] his character was just like the
[54:35] character of the father brother Branham
[54:38] taught us if you want to know who God is
[54:40] look at Jesus Christ
[54:43] you'll know exactly how he acted he
[54:49] didn't have some look at me attitude he
[54:52] wasn't talking about me he was always
[54:56] talking about Jesus we're talking about
[54:58] the father
[55:03] God was manifested in the flesh Jesus
[55:06] Christ amen
[55:10] Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ was
[55:13] in the image of the invisible God the
[55:16] firstborn of every creature and we are
[55:21] coming into manifestation of the same
[55:25] image remember he is the firstborn among
[55:27] many brethren
[55:29] we can't keep such a wide gap I
[55:34] understand that we're not God but that
[55:40] doesn't mean I can stay down where the
[55:43] devil wants me to be I've got to believe
[55:47] that God can come into my life and
[55:49] change my nature change the way that I
[55:51] think and act and how I talk that I
[55:54] really can humble myself and live for
[55:57] others and esteemed somebody else better
[56:01] than myself and not be a respecter of
[56:05] persons and and only love certain people
[56:08] I mean I don't want to be down there
[56:10] where the devil wants me I want to be up
[56:13] in heaven II places with Christ Jesus
[56:15] and donal love everybody that's what I
[56:18] want so my question to you is do you
[56:24] know who you are
[56:26] do you ever a revelation of who you're
[56:29] supposed to be we're supposed to be in
[56:32] the form of God if you have that
[56:36] revelation then take on the same mind of
[56:41] Christ we have one mind one Accord
[56:46] esteem others better than yourself put
[56:50] others before you it says the things of
[56:53] others the things of others I want to
[56:57] challenge you how many of you have
[57:00] called somebody and it's concerned about
[57:05] them
[57:07] we're too busy in our lives we've got so
[57:11] much plans and so much things going on
[57:14] in such a direction that when we finally
[57:18] do connect with somebody it's on
[57:20] something so carnal or it's about
[57:22] herself now I'm not saying be a monk and
[57:30] live in a cave but what I am saying is
[57:32] we need to manifest the word we need to
[57:35] take time to manifest it alright verse 7
[57:38] speaking of Jesus Christ or the mind of
[57:42] Christ in this but he made himself of no
[57:46] reputation and took upon him the form of
[57:50] a servant and was made in the likeness
[57:53] of men think about this this is who the
[58:02] father was this is who Jesus was when he
[58:07] manifested in the flesh and this is who
[58:09] we are
[58:10] we're not superior to others if you've
[58:18] got that nature where you have to you're
[58:23] too proud to get underneath somebody you
[58:26] don't want anybody to see so you got to
[58:28] like text them privately
[58:36] we need to stop acting like we're
[58:39] superior over others stop thinking like
[58:41] it stop talking like it we need to get
[58:45] rid of the reputation of continuously
[58:50] trying to build ourselves and look like
[58:55] were something in somebody else's eyes
[58:59] need to get rid of it don't make
[59:01] yourself of our reputation if that is in
[59:04] your mind it's the wrong spirit God
[59:08] didn't want to show off who he was yeah
[59:11] he got a burn when it comes time for God
[59:21] to show his glory he will but he's the
[59:25] only one that can do that we need to get
[59:31] rid of our reputation we need to realize
[59:35] or just like them until you become the
[59:41] servant of God then you're like Almighty
[59:47] God that's what would make you greater
[59:50] than them if you want to really become
[59:53] greater than another human being you
[59:56] need to submit yourself and become their
[59:59] servant and then you're just like Jesus
[1:00:01] Christ you're just like God that's what
[1:00:05] are you saying here we want to become we
[1:00:09] want to show were more than they are by
[1:00:11] what we know or what's wrong about Vann
[1:00:15] and it's not even the mind of Christ the
[1:00:18] mind of Christ is get underneath that
[1:00:20] person and help them get them up no
[1:00:24] matter where they're at it can be real
[1:00:28] low or real high but get underneath them
[1:00:30] and when you be do that then you're just
[1:00:33] like Almighty God we all want to be like
[1:00:35] that he says it Jesus even told his
[1:00:37] disciples
[1:00:39] want to be great because of all and
[1:00:44] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:00:48] humbled himself and he became obedient
[1:00:51] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:00:55] so he didn't stop he kept going with
[1:00:59] that attitude rate to the end of
[1:01:01] humility and unworthiness now we're
[1:01:04] talking about the mind of Christ and
[1:01:05] this is so important if we're ever going
[1:01:08] to be one with God oh you know I am not
[1:01:14] much every one of us is one with God but
[1:01:20] there is a difference between repenting
[1:01:22] getting baptized asking Calvary to take
[1:01:27] care of what's missing in their lives
[1:01:29] and becoming in the image of Jesus
[1:01:34] Christ and and being ready to take on
[1:01:38] the bride nature because the bride
[1:01:40] nature is the female part of God we're
[1:01:47] just like him the same image the same
[1:01:50] mind we don't have to try real hard to
[1:01:53] humble ourselves we don't have to put up
[1:01:56] some little image in front of somebody
[1:01:59] we don't have a form it's not a sales
[1:02:03] pitch it's not just acting like it right
[1:02:07] now because we're in front of people
[1:02:08] it's the life that we live we need the
[1:02:11] mind of crisis is important to the to
[1:02:13] the bride to the believer it's not just
[1:02:16] something while we're just shoot for the
[1:02:19] dark hope we hit it someday no it's
[1:02:21] something we practice with every thought
[1:02:23] that we think that comes into her head
[1:02:24] we begin to practice what we're doing
[1:02:27] with those thoughts humble thoughts this
[1:02:33] is what God visualized in his mind for
[1:02:36] you from the foundation of the world to
[1:02:38] be just like this now he knows we were
[1:02:42] born like that Adam was
[1:02:46] we weren't so we have to do a lot of
[1:02:50] suffering a lot of crucifying to the
[1:02:52] flesh to get to think like that because
[1:02:54] the love of God thinks no evil we don't
[1:02:57] have a problem sitting in our couch
[1:02:58] thinking evil about somebody and nobody
[1:03:00] will ever know it let's see the mind of
[1:03:05] Christ doesn't do that I can see where
[1:03:11] brother brand said this will not be a
[1:03:15] public show this is going to be done in
[1:03:19] secret yeah this is between those who
[1:03:24] love God more than anything this is what
[1:03:29] Jesus meant when he prayed for us to be
[1:03:32] one with him is to is to fulfill to have
[1:03:35] this type of mind in our thinking every
[1:03:38] day by God's own holy spirit we are
[1:03:42] missing and supernaturally baptized into
[1:03:45] the body of Christ and God's own seed
[1:03:48] inside of us it begins to Germany it
[1:03:51] begins to grow and we begin to become
[1:03:54] more like him when we're born again but
[1:03:57] it is apparent that we don't all grow
[1:03:59] the same some grow faster than others
[1:04:08] it's very apparent to me that we play a
[1:04:11] big part in how fast we grow don't put
[1:04:17] it all on God God don't look at you and
[1:04:21] say I don't want you to grow first oh I
[1:04:24] like your eyes I want you to grow real
[1:04:26] fast
[1:04:27] God ain't like that he's no respecter
[1:04:29] persons if we want to grow more then we
[1:04:35] got a humble ourselves more we got a
[1:04:37] cruise to sell crucify our flesh more we
[1:04:40] got to get a revelation of what it means
[1:04:44] to die out that he might increase amen
[1:04:48] as we receive God's Holy Spirit he leads
[1:04:52] us to become one with himself because
[1:04:55] it's him inside United with himself now
[1:05:00] Justin doctrine yeah I don't want us to
[1:05:02] become one Justin doctrine but in nature
[1:05:05] in the way that he acts the way that he
[1:05:09] handles situations on a daily basis the
[1:05:16] thing that we put such a little emphasis
[1:05:18] on well it really doesn't matter how we
[1:05:21] act really doesn't matter what we say
[1:05:23] what we think doesn't matter our
[1:05:26] temperature well I'll tell you
[1:05:29] physically if you get too hot you begin
[1:05:33] to think serious right there but you get
[1:05:40] a fever
[1:05:58] we need to put more emphasis on a daily
[1:06:03] basis what we're manifesting the
[1:06:08] attitudes that we pack around are we
[1:06:12] representing the selfish nature the way
[1:06:15] we talk and act or is it God's character
[1:06:19] God's holy spirit just doesn't lead us
[1:06:22] to become with one with the knowledge
[1:06:25] like I understand this you can have all
[1:06:29] understanding right can have all
[1:06:32] knowledge but we need his character
[1:06:34] that's the life we lived the Holy Spirit
[1:06:39] unites us with his character not just
[1:06:41] the knowledge of his word when his
[1:06:45] Spirit has preeminence in her life it
[1:06:47] would transform our minds to think more
[1:06:50] humble to talk more humble to act out
[1:06:56] more humble so we're still going to
[1:06:59] think we're still going to talk we're
[1:07:00] still gonna act but it's just gonna be
[1:07:02] with a different spirit because God
[1:07:05] dwells with them that are of a humble
[1:07:06] contrite spirit he says I am humble he's
[1:07:11] the high lofty one but he's humble
[1:07:12] learning me a meek I'm humble praise the
[1:07:18] Lord
[1:07:18] let all that I think say and do be
[1:07:22] pleasing to the Lord how many wants to
[1:07:25] be one with Jesus amen now there are
[1:07:29] many reasons that people would like to
[1:07:30] be one with God but the reason Jesus
[1:07:34] gave us was for his glory not for ours
[1:07:40] no doubt God wants us to be united he
[1:07:44] wants us he wants to be united with the
[1:07:46] bride unfortunately all of his wife
[1:07:49] isn't in yet all of his wife don't even
[1:07:53] know him yet they're out in the world so
[1:07:59] the rapture can't happen yet and he's
[1:08:02] got a particular interest with them his
[1:08:05] nature is to leave the ninety-nine you
[1:08:07] go after the one so God has a very
[1:08:10] big interest for those that aren't saved
[1:08:12] and when you feel that burden for the
[1:08:17] souls of others that's the Holy Ghost
[1:08:20] that's the Living God inside of you
[1:08:23] because I wasn't born with that I mean I
[1:08:27] wanted to beat up my brother I wanted to
[1:08:32] steal from the people that stole from me
[1:08:34] I wanted to be better than everybody
[1:08:45] that God's Spirit is so different you
[1:08:51] you can honestly look at people now and
[1:08:53] know that their deceit you can say
[1:08:57] Father forgive them they don't know what
[1:08:59] spirit they're under
[1:09:00] there's an anointing on them they don't
[1:09:02] even know they're acting selfishly
[1:09:09] another random I believe said that no
[1:09:12] man deserves to hear if every man hasn't
[1:09:17] heard at once received this message and
[1:09:21] I say that is where God's heart is that
[1:09:24] that's what brother grant said mission
[1:09:26] work it's always in the will of God it's
[1:09:27] awesome to think that when God was
[1:09:29] praying in this right before he went on
[1:09:36] to - to Calvary his last tiny spending
[1:09:40] with his disciples
[1:09:41] it's awesome to think that we was
[1:09:43] praying with his disciples that he was
[1:09:45] praying for you and I we were in his
[1:09:48] mind at the same time he was praying you
[1:09:52] believe that he didn't just pray for you
[1:09:57] he prayed for those who you would
[1:09:59] witness to
[1:10:04] look at verse st. John 17 verse 20
[1:10:07] neither pray I for these alone but for
[1:10:09] them also which shall believe on me
[1:10:12] through their word their word amen you
[1:10:19] have a word to share with somebody you
[1:10:21] have a ministry to share with somebody
[1:10:24] the gospel didn't stop with us we're not
[1:10:29] the last ones on the train we're not the
[1:10:31] last ones in the boat the lifeboat now
[1:10:35] at the time to get on board as she is
[1:10:37] passing by but if we wait too long we
[1:10:40] shall forever die there are souls to
[1:10:44] rescue there are souls to save it's up
[1:10:46] to us to send the light we need to send
[1:10:49] the light we see
[1:10:52] HUD unveiling his purpose for unity or
[1:10:56] oneness as Jesus prays to the Father
[1:10:58] that day verse 21 that they also may be
[1:11:00] one in us that the world may believe
[1:11:03] that thou has sent me look at the the
[1:11:06] purpose here for God so loved the world
[1:11:13] that He gave His only begotten Son our
[1:11:16] oneness with God opens the eyes of the
[1:11:20] world that the Son of God may be seen in
[1:11:24] us that's the reason that word God is
[1:11:29] purpose in which he wants us to be one
[1:11:33] he's got all through eternity to do
[1:11:37] whatever he wants to do with us when
[1:11:38] were in heaven and he has given us the
[1:11:43] earnest of his spirit now which is love
[1:11:45] joy peace longsuffering
[1:11:46] but those things are not meant just to
[1:11:50] be for us selfishly why do I need to
[1:11:54] have to be long-suffering with myself
[1:11:58] why do I need to be meek with myself
[1:12:04] fruit so the spirit are needed so other
[1:12:07] people when you're when they're being
[1:12:09] when they're being bad that they can see
[1:12:12] the life of Christ inside of you now the
[1:12:16] purpose of being one with Christ is said
[1:12:20] that other people can see that that
[1:12:23] Jesus has been sent and he's been sent
[1:12:26] in you to them to manifest that he's
[1:12:31] alive he's the same yesterday today and
[1:12:33] forever that's the reason Hebrews 13:8
[1:12:42] that's why God has given us the Ministry
[1:12:45] of reconciliation that the world may
[1:12:47] know that the Son of God has been sent
[1:12:53] because he he
[1:12:56] he's dead he's no longer seen in this
[1:13:05] body that he walked on the planet 2000
[1:13:09] over 2,000 years ago for about 2,000
[1:13:14] years ago but he's alive in us but what
[1:13:21] good is that living life inside of us if
[1:13:24] other people can't see it what would be
[1:13:29] a need then for oneness with God his his
[1:13:33] reason that he's given for oneness is
[1:13:35] that others may know that he's been sent
[1:13:39] not 2,000 years ago ain't gonna do no
[1:13:42] good from they want to know Jesus is
[1:13:45] alive today they want to know Jesus is
[1:13:47] the I am God that what he's done for
[1:13:50] others he can do for them yes the answer
[1:13:54] is Calvary but Cal Reyes has become real
[1:13:57] to them personal to them God's purpose
[1:14:00] for our oneness with him isn't just for
[1:14:03] us in our certification people's lives
[1:14:08] people's souls are depending upon it it
[1:14:13] is the heart of God I believe if Jesus
[1:14:17] was here in the flesh today at this
[1:14:20] pulpit I believe somewhere down the line
[1:14:23] he would have prayed the same prayer
[1:14:26] then others in this world may know that
[1:14:30] he's been sent and that God would use us
[1:14:34] the Holy Spirit would use us to reach
[1:14:38] them there is not one person in here
[1:14:44] that would say it doesn't matter to me
[1:14:48] if you want to cut my finger off I don't
[1:14:50] need it
[1:14:54] we want our fingers take my my I take my
[1:15:02] arm nobody wants to give up their body
[1:15:10] Jesus isn't gonna lose one member of his
[1:15:14] body not one but what he's looking for
[1:15:19] is someone who would take in to them who
[1:15:24] would take Jesus to them it starts out
[1:15:28] with carving out some time of your life
[1:15:30] to help somebody today don't wait til
[1:15:33] tomorrow
[1:15:34] don't wait til somebody comes by and
[1:15:36] says hey can you tell me about Jesus go
[1:15:42] yell you never taught his disciples stay
[1:15:45] here in go out and bring them in God
[1:15:52] wants people to know today that God sent
[1:15:55] a prophet with God's message for the
[1:15:58] hour that's ticket is ready no other
[1:16:00] message will work we need to stand
[1:16:03] united with Christ in prayer and his
[1:16:08] eternal purpose Amos 3:3 says can two
[1:16:11] walk together except they agree how can
[1:16:15] we walk close together with Christ and
[1:16:17] be in disagreement about his purpose
[1:16:21] when he's calling us to to share him
[1:16:24] with others but we don't agree with that
[1:16:31] united we stand with Christ divided we
[1:16:36] fall
[1:16:38] jesus said that even satan's kingdom was
[1:16:41] United now they're United in the purpose
[1:16:46] to divide and conquer to sow discord and
[1:16:51] division among the body of Christ but
[1:16:54] Jesus and his angels are rejoicing over
[1:16:57] one soul that unites with Christ so
[1:17:00] there's a unity in the kingdom of God as
[1:17:03] well when God spoke in the prophecy and
[1:17:11] he told us to to build our unity how do
[1:17:17] we do that we come together and pray one
[1:17:20] for another it starts right there
[1:17:24] because you know if we come and just
[1:17:26] tell all the people what they need to do
[1:17:29] well you know you're not gonna get too
[1:17:32] much United with somebody look how hard
[1:17:36] it is for you to even listen to me you
[1:17:41] literally have to be in the spirit to
[1:17:45] say it's of God because the flesh don't
[1:17:49] want to hear it but when we come
[1:17:51] together we pray for one another God
[1:17:55] would do things that we've never seen
[1:18:00] God's kingdom is United God's Spirit in
[1:18:06] the church is United Northern random
[1:18:09] even taught us if there was another
[1:18:10] spirit that tried to get in there by
[1:18:12] anyone somebody in the church somehow
[1:18:14] did the church coming in the church he
[1:18:16] says you just waxed that much closer
[1:18:18] together is that what he said that's
[1:18:22] exactly what he said he said now you're
[1:18:25] all one big happy bunch but the devil is
[1:18:29] also united to not keep it that way a
[1:18:34] lot of junk going out in the world it's
[1:18:39] confusing the people more and more we
[1:18:43] need to know where we stand in his
[1:18:48] purpose and what he's called us to do a
[1:18:52] person that has a burden for souls you
[1:18:59] can trust them a lot more that they care
[1:19:04] about the whole body it's not my notes
[1:19:12] as all came extra we need to stay united
[1:19:17] with the Living Word stay attached to
[1:19:21] the vine don't become separated stay
[1:19:24] attached to his love stay attached to
[1:19:27] his will stay United to fulfill the
[1:19:30] purpose of God verse 22 of st. John
[1:19:36] chapter 17 and the glory which thou
[1:19:38] gavest me I have given them that they
[1:19:43] may be one even as we are one now the
[1:19:47] glory that Jesus had was the glory of
[1:19:50] God Jesus gives us the glory of God now
[1:19:59] listen not glory from God
[1:20:03] but the glory of God it is the kernel
[1:20:08] nature of man to want to get glory and
[1:20:12] steal it from God because it's the
[1:20:16] reputation it's look at me what do we
[1:20:20] have to do anything about anything
[1:20:23] there's nothing good in me
[1:20:25] amen say it again I'm okay with
[1:20:29] everybody saying John there is nothing
[1:20:31] good in you because it's the truth why
[1:20:36] would I take offense to that I would
[1:20:40] just take offense to say that there's no
[1:20:43] Jesus in you as we give God Liberty in
[1:20:51] our hearts that's when the glory that's
[1:20:59] the glory that Jesus has given you it's
[1:21:03] when you give him Liberty to do what he
[1:21:06] wants to do inside of you in other words
[1:21:09] when we received the Word of God that's
[1:21:11] preached to us we become more like him
[1:21:13] because God don't give us the word just
[1:21:15] to give us head knowledge he's
[1:21:17] interested that that word becomes a part
[1:21:19] of our life second Corinthians chapter 3
[1:21:22] verse 18 but we all with open face
[1:21:27] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:21:31] Lord are changed into the same image
[1:21:33] from glory to glory even as by the
[1:21:37] Spirit of the Lord were changed what do
[1:21:41] we change we're changing to the glory of
[1:21:43] God
[1:21:44] see it's the glory of God we should
[1:21:47] never take glory away from the Lord if
[1:21:52] we do it's satanic
[1:21:56] we just don't know it yeah and the glory
[1:22:01] which thou gave us me I give them that
[1:22:03] they may be one that's the reason we got
[1:22:06] glory there'd be one with God even as we
[1:22:08] are one
[1:22:08] becoming one with God doesn't happen by
[1:22:11] church attendance it doesn't have my
[1:22:14] tape listening by typing by Bible
[1:22:17] reading it's when we slow down to submit
[1:22:22] to the word that we've heard agreeing
[1:22:25] with the word doesn't make us one our
[1:22:35] relationship with God doesn't grow
[1:22:39] necessarily like a marriage any two
[1:22:43] people that have gotten married or even
[1:22:46] when you begin to have a serious
[1:22:47] relationship now I've seen this many
[1:22:51] times many times but I've known people
[1:22:56] before they were married
[1:22:57] and then when they come and they get
[1:23:00] married they change both of them do
[1:23:05] there becomes a blending together they
[1:23:10] they learn to have to be long-suffering
[1:23:15] forgiving and and they learn they can do
[1:23:22] things all the way they want to anymore
[1:23:26] so there's like some neutral blending
[1:23:29] together and becoming like a new you
[1:23:34] like that with God in our relationship
[1:23:38] with God God don't need to change we do
[1:23:42] a hundred percent of the changing he's
[1:23:45] the same yesterday today and forever we
[1:23:47] are the ones that are changing to new
[1:23:48] creatures so the relationship is a
[1:23:51] little bit different we are the ones
[1:23:52] that always have to be humble and our
[1:23:55] human relationships I can say you listen
[1:23:57] to me or you listen to me you can't do
[1:24:02] that what God
[1:24:05] well you shouldn't do that with one
[1:24:08] another but that's human nature that's
[1:24:15] human nature
[1:24:17] our relationship with God completely
[1:24:21] relies on you becoming humble enough to
[1:24:23] submit to the word that he places in
[1:24:26] front of you every time you come to
[1:24:27] church that's how we become more like
[1:24:33] Jesus he remains the same he's just the
[1:24:39] same as the day he called me he hasn't
[1:24:43] changed one bit and thank God for that
[1:24:46] because when we get so lost in her sin
[1:24:49] and so down in the dumps and so
[1:24:51] depressed and so away from walking in
[1:24:53] the spirit we finally humble ourselves
[1:24:54] to get in prayer and we feel his
[1:24:58] presence come oh we begin to think back
[1:25:01] when he first loved us and how he
[1:25:03] forgave us and we're so grateful that
[1:25:06] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:07] forever amen verse 23 I in them and thou
[1:25:13] and me that they may be made perfect in
[1:25:16] one and that the world may know that
[1:25:18] thou has sent me and has loved them as
[1:25:21] thou has loved me to think that God
[1:25:25] loves you as much as he loves himself
[1:25:29] that is just like mine bothering for he
[1:25:36] so loved the world that He gave His only
[1:25:37] begotten Son turn with me to Ephesians
[1:25:38] chapter five verse number 25 Ephesians
[1:25:41] five verse 25 husbands love your wives
[1:25:44] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:25:48] gave himself for it that's how much he
[1:25:56] loved us that he might sanctify and
[1:25:59] cleanse her with the washing of the
[1:26:00] water by the word so what a precious
[1:26:02] moment we have right now then he gives
[1:26:05] us his word we're in the process of the
[1:26:07] washing when the word is being preached
[1:26:10] in reality he's expressing his love to
[1:26:13] you
[1:26:17] his commandments are not Grievous he
[1:26:20] wants that word to wash us to wash us of
[1:26:23] our I own ideas of our own plans of our
[1:26:27] of our of our reputation and the things
[1:26:29] that we want to do to get people to look
[1:26:31] up to us he wants to wash us of that
[1:26:33] stuff and he wants us to just be just so
[1:26:38] clean that the only thing he sees is
[1:26:39] himself amen praise the Lord that he
[1:26:43] might present to himself a glorious
[1:26:47] church having not having spot or wrinkle
[1:26:50] or any such thing but that it should be
[1:26:53] holy and without blemish well I'll tell
[1:26:56] you I got blemishes he's still working
[1:27:03] on me the love that God has given us is
[1:27:09] awesome the love he has given us Romans
[1:27:14] five verse five because the love of God
[1:27:16] is she'd abroad in our hearts by the
[1:27:18] Holy Ghost which is given unto us he
[1:27:21] didn't give us his unconditional love
[1:27:24] that we could conditionally love others
[1:27:30] know that love needs to be used to let
[1:27:34] the world know that Jesus is alive that
[1:27:37] that the father sent Jesus amen so the
[1:27:40] world can behold the glory of God
[1:27:42] John chapter thirteen verse 34 John
[1:27:45] chapter 13 verse 34 and I need to be
[1:27:48] moving so you need to be moving with me
[1:27:53] don't make me stop for you a new
[1:27:57] commandment I give you that you keep
[1:28:03] loving the same way you've always loved
[1:28:09] the way I love
[1:28:12] because it's not the wording gonna know
[1:28:16] that the father sent Jesus in you well
[1:28:21] just tell them I'm in the message now
[1:28:23] buddy brother branham's are probably
[1:28:24] gonna help anything
[1:28:26] think you can help one thing a new
[1:28:29] commandment I give unto you that you
[1:28:31] love one another as I have loved you
[1:28:35] that ye also love one another on
[1:28:37] conditionally seven times seventy and by
[1:28:43] this love not your love but the love I
[1:28:46] put in your heart by the Holy Ghost
[1:28:48] that's why we need the Holy Ghost by
[1:28:51] this shall all men know that you're my
[1:28:53] disciples if you have love one to
[1:28:57] another John chapter 15 verse 12 this is
[1:29:03] my commandment in John 13 it was a new
[1:29:07] commandment in verse 15 is my
[1:29:10] commandment that ye love one another as
[1:29:13] I have loved you that made all his
[1:29:19] disciples feel like I am NOT doing that
[1:29:22] right now I have to start manifesting
[1:29:26] something greater than what I was now we
[1:29:29] were in the image of God this is how he
[1:29:30] visualized us to be one with him to love
[1:29:34] just like he loves and I'll tell you
[1:29:36] it's going to take a great manifestation
[1:29:39] no you aren't going to go on the cross
[1:29:41] and die for the world but you're going
[1:29:44] to get up and pick up your cross and
[1:29:45] follow him on a daily basis also people
[1:29:49] ain't gonna see that see the love of God
[1:29:51] they're just gonna see your love
[1:29:52] well Milo is pretty good you know you
[1:29:54] know my love is pretty good up wow you
[1:29:57] know I can do a lot with my love but
[1:30:01] it'll come short of them seeing Jesus
[1:30:03] and if you're not interested in them
[1:30:06] seeing Jesus and you're interested in
[1:30:08] your reputation
[1:30:10] because people can want to know you we
[1:30:13] people can want to know oh we could want
[1:30:16] not we but people we'd get a spirit on
[1:30:19] this that we want other people to know
[1:30:20] that we know Jesus for what reason for
[1:30:24] your reputation the reason we want
[1:30:27] people to know Jesus is so Jesus can
[1:30:30] help them there no we can do to help
[1:30:32] them except introduce the the bridegroom
[1:30:35] to the bride that they don't know their
[1:30:37] bride yet that's our job make ourselves
[1:30:44] of no reputation greater love hath no
[1:30:47] man than this than a man lay down his
[1:30:50] life for his friends something about the
[1:30:55] family of God they're tight my my dad
[1:31:00] used to say when I was growing up he
[1:31:01] said blood is thicker than water
[1:31:05] family is thicker than friendships but
[1:31:16] God's blood makes his family
[1:31:30] that spirit will cause us brother brand
[1:31:38] would walk up to the pulpit he said good
[1:31:39] morning friends were they all bright
[1:31:47] some of them didn't even know the
[1:31:49] message sure but we need to be Christ
[1:31:52] everybody amen
[1:31:53] er my friends I'm calling you friends
[1:31:57] I'm laying down my life for he lay down
[1:31:58] his life for the world and you are my
[1:32:01] friends if you do the same for me that's
[1:32:04] what it means I if you do whatsoever I
[1:32:07] come in you means you lay down your life
[1:32:09] for me I got a quote I'd like to read
[1:32:15] from brother Branham in the Great
[1:32:17] Commission you think about laying down
[1:32:20] your life
[1:32:21] take my word brother Brennan says for
[1:32:24] this when somebody when someone does you
[1:32:27] wrong
[1:32:28] don't mention it all my my you just stop
[1:32:32] right there with the quote when somebody
[1:32:39] does me wrong I want to tell everybody
[1:32:41] about it
[1:32:42] do you ever hear somebody just talking
[1:32:44] about somebody doing them wrong what
[1:32:47] spirit is that well it was so wrong I
[1:32:50] know if I tell somebody they're just
[1:32:52] going to agree with me and then they're
[1:32:53] gonna get on my side so what what would
[1:32:58] that achieve you're building your
[1:33:02] kingdom your reputation I want to build
[1:33:05] God's take my word for this when someone
[1:33:09] does you wrong don't mention it
[1:33:12] maybe maybe his destination rests on
[1:33:17] your attitude towards him after going
[1:33:23] before God's throne will realize we're
[1:33:27] all guilty and need each other's help
[1:33:31] that's right brother preach it you'll
[1:33:34] begin to feel sorry for that person
[1:33:37] Satan relaxes when we're just busy
[1:33:41] shooting at one another
[1:33:44] I love the spirit and the Prophet
[1:33:53] because he taught us how to live a life
[1:34:01] people are gonna do here Jesus that
[1:34:04] offenses are gonna come we can't do
[1:34:07] nothing about it people are going to
[1:34:09] talk behind our back people are going to
[1:34:10] use us
[1:34:11] people are gonna destroy us but will
[1:34:17] they see Jesus anyway I don't want to
[1:34:21] just shine when everything's on my going
[1:34:24] my way it's time to shine when
[1:34:27] everybody's left you you're left alone
[1:34:30] nobody cares they've done well used you
[1:34:34] up you know the Bible says the rich have
[1:34:37] many friends but soon as their money
[1:34:39] leaves they're no longer needed The
[1:34:47] Closer that you are in your everyday
[1:34:50] relationship with God the more you'll be
[1:34:53] one with him the blood makes you one
[1:34:58] with Christ but I'm not talking about
[1:35:00] that I'm talking about the character
[1:35:02] that comes from the Holy Spirit living
[1:35:04] inside of you the way we act and talk
[1:35:07] and handle life's issues and problems
[1:35:10] that's what we're that was an example
[1:35:13] right there is when somebody says
[1:35:17] something Zipit love covers a multitude
[1:35:21] of sin you sure you got something when
[1:35:26] you can zip your lip brother John are
[1:35:31] you talking directly at me no but I hope
[1:35:34] the Holy Spirit is
[1:35:37] because that was my prayer that the Holy
[1:35:40] Spirit would take this word and make it
[1:35:43] real to us not in a way to feel bad for
[1:35:46] the times we have talked about others
[1:35:49] but that we can make a stand I want to
[1:35:51] become one with God because there's too
[1:35:55] much religious spirits oh I'm one with
[1:35:58] God I love God I know God but they don't
[1:36:01] care about living that just a religious
[1:36:04] spirit we're talking about something
[1:36:07] that can take inventory when we become
[1:36:16] one with him
[1:36:18] we'll act more like him every day what
[1:36:22] talk more like him well say things like
[1:36:24] him we'll act like him you'll know how
[1:36:28] it is you know the more you're with
[1:36:33] somebody the more you begin to think
[1:36:39] like them or at least know how they
[1:36:44] think almost begin to end better
[1:36:48] anticipate the way they're going to act
[1:36:50] with a certain situation happens to them
[1:36:53] and we've heard it before when two
[1:36:55] people are together they kind of blend
[1:36:57] and they begin to look like one another
[1:36:59] and act like one another well we need to
[1:37:03] become like Jesus we need the mind of
[1:37:06] Christ so we know the way he thinks we
[1:37:08] begin to handle situations what would
[1:37:10] Jesus do in a situation like this are
[1:37:13] you with me we should be so close to
[1:37:16] thinking like the Holy Ghost we should
[1:37:18] be saying the same thing that he's
[1:37:20] saying the bride will be saying the same
[1:37:24] thing he says even in the midst of all
[1:37:26] the confusion the changing that's going
[1:37:28] on in this world the in this our the
[1:37:31] spirit and the bride are saying come
[1:37:34] there's no hope left but the coming of
[1:37:37] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:39] revelations 22 verse 17 the spirit and
[1:37:42] the bride say come and let him that
[1:37:47] heareth say come and let
[1:37:49] that athirst come notice the first two
[1:37:54] are capitalized and the second one is
[1:37:55] not and whosoever will let him take of
[1:37:58] the water of life freely come and he
[1:38:04] ends up in the second from the last
[1:38:07] verse in the Bible testifying that these
[1:38:10] things are true surely I come quickly to
[1:38:14] every single person that's ever lived
[1:38:17] their life has been a vapor of smoke
[1:38:19] it's been short it's been too quick for
[1:38:23] them
[1:38:25] we need a revelation of how quickly
[1:38:28] Jesus is coming we don't have much time
[1:38:31] left and it's not about just you being
[1:38:36] ready God wants you to be one so you can
[1:38:38] help others get ready that's the reason
[1:38:43] Romans chapter 8 verse 18 for I reckon
[1:38:48] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:38:51] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:38:52] glory which shall be revealed in this
[1:38:56] you will have to suffer the more you
[1:38:59] want to become one with Christ because
[1:39:02] you'll have to die out to your way of
[1:39:04] loving with respect to persons or
[1:39:08] choosing who you're in love and who
[1:39:09] you're not going to talk to you that day
[1:39:13] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:39:16] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:39:18] of the sons of God for the creature was
[1:39:22] made subject to vanity not willingly
[1:39:24] wasn't our we were willing to be born in
[1:39:27] sin but by reason of him who had
[1:39:30] subjected the same in Hope because the
[1:39:33] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:39:36] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:39:38] glorious liberty of the children of God
[1:39:40] for we know that the whole creation is
[1:39:43] groaning and travailing in pain together
[1:39:47] until now there should be something in
[1:39:49] the bride of Jesus Christ that is
[1:39:52] screaming out saying come Lord Jesus
[1:39:54] come we can't allow ourselves to get so
[1:39:59] relaxed in this world
[1:40:01] we're not gonna get ready we're not
[1:40:04] gonna be concerned about others it's
[1:40:09] time the time is at hand lay aside
[1:40:13] everything and become him don't become
[1:40:17] like him become him
[1:40:19] don't just mimic him become him let him
[1:40:24] live his life so much through you it's
[1:40:26] no longer you your life is hidden hidden
[1:40:29] God Amen it's time to be one with Christ
[1:40:35] so the world will know that God has sent
[1:40:39] Jesus in you I want people to see Jesus
[1:40:45] in me it's time to be getting the rest
[1:40:49] of the family of God inside Christ yes
[1:40:54] let's take just take a little bit of
[1:40:56] time I'm counting if you just take a
[1:40:57] half hour next week and do nothing
[1:41:01] except that half hour except trying to
[1:41:04] hunt the bride I know that sounds
[1:41:06] ridiculous but it needs to stop start
[1:41:09] with that we can't just be lured bring
[1:41:13] the bride in Lord use me Lord I'm
[1:41:16] waiting Lord just this week open the
[1:41:18] door if you want me to talk to somebody
[1:41:20] we already know it's his will for us to
[1:41:22] do it we just got to go out we got to
[1:41:25] change the way that we look at those
[1:41:27] things it's time to manifest that we're
[1:41:30] one with Christ it's time for us to be
[1:41:33] hungry and thirsting for us his return
[1:41:36] it's time for Jesus to come Paul told
[1:41:43] Timothy in chapter four verse number
[1:41:45] eight he said henceforth there is laid
[1:41:46] up for me a crown of righteousness which
[1:41:49] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[1:41:51] me at that day and not me only but I
[1:41:53] want you all them that love his
[1:41:57] appearing surely I come quickly let's
[1:42:03] stand together even so Lord Jesus
[1:42:09] Lord Jesus how many want Jesus to come
[1:42:13] soon when that hunger becomes so great
[1:42:18] that your life is just totally given

[1:45:42] word inside let it wash us that we may
[1:45:47] become one with him and usually I'll
[1:45:52] just say it like this it starts out with
[1:45:54] our attitude think about many things I'd
[1:46:04] like to say to you but you can't bear it
[1:46:05] now but when the Holy Spirit comes we
[1:46:07] can bear it brother Branham says we come
[1:46:09] to find out where we're at with God we
[1:46:12] hear the word we find out we're right
[1:46:14] then our attitude what do we want to do
[1:46:17] with it well I want to fulfill the
[1:46:22] reason that God wants me to be one with
[1:46:24] him not selfishly but now that he could
[1:46:30] take this body this body that I think is
[1:46:33] whatever and let him use it to go lay
[1:46:38] down
[1:46:39] it's his life again to lay down his life
[1:46:43] again in front of somebody that they may
[1:46:47] see him he just needs the best those

[1:47:34] of being one with you forgive us for
[1:47:37] being so selfish with your love and
