am and he promis if we do Hunger that will be be fed well praise the Lord everyone it's good to be in the house of the Lord and we're so sorry for those who are battl in sickness amen because it's uh it keeps us from being gathered together and uh it was a couple days ago we woke up in the morning praying and we just felt led to call um brother Isaac and and to see how he's doing because I with hearing that the church was all sick we didn't want to bring anything here amen and uh he said just that day his wife had woke up with a fever and it was starting to just to to spread there so um we thought it would just be the wisdom of the Lord to wait amen and um and we're thankful that the Lord knows uh all things and he's in control and we just we just trust him amen amen uh we did get a chance to go see uh brother Dennis in in the in the hospital and he uh he said he would be able to come home in a couple of days uh so uh but I haven't heard you know he hasn't hasn't responded yet but let's continue to pray for him we're so grateful to the Lord what the Lord had done for him amen amen turn with me if you would in the book of Ephesians what we're going to be doing is doing part five of functioning uh of a healthy body how many how many wants to have a healthier body amen amen amen well just like in the natural if we want a healthier body we have to do all the work we do we have to do all the work we have to make the sacrifice we have to we have to eat the right things and I I I believe if we're going to function as a healthy body here we we have got our our work cut out for us we got things that we have to do we can't rely on somebody else to do all the healthy eating for us and all the exercising for us we got to be part of that amen let's read verses uh Ephesians 4 in chapter uh chapter 4: 15-6 and then we'll have a word of prayer before you're seated the Bible says um that we henceforth be no more children so our first goal is to grow up right amen amen tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness uh whereby they lie in way to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by what by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in every measure of uh of every part making an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love let's approach the author who's able to make this word uh alive to us Heavenly Father we come to you with sincerity of hearts Lord we we can't see all of you the way we want to we're looking through a glass Darkly we know that we're supposed to be uh your bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing we know that we're going to be just like you when you appear we have these promises and Lord we have this desire in a heart that we want to manifest you and uh when there's the great need of of well all times but Lord but especially when there's problems in a church we want to be able to to to handle them exactly the way that you would handle them and Lord we need you for this Lord we need the Holy Spirit and we pray that you would break the word to us and that you would increase the desire in our heart uh to be more like you and to to to be Christ one to another and just to help one another father we commit the service into your hands and we're trust in you that you give us spiritual ears to hear what you're saying to us Lord we give you the praise now for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may be seated seated today we want to talk or get into we'll might do a couple services in this but examples of functioning healthy healthy um functioning as a healthy body requires the most important thing which is the character of God Amen the Bible tells us that Christ wants preeminence in the church that's right so if he has preeminence things are going to work out right um but if he doesn't have preeminence then we're there to deal with stuff brother brandom said that character was important and he said in the choosing of the Bride he said God is looking for character when he chooses his bride Amen in another place he said it's the only thing we're taking with us amen is character so character is not a badge you get after you go through 18 years of school and you got diploma it's really The Life of Christ Living inside amen oh we've all been to a wedding before and uh those of you those of you wives ladies who have been married uh have experienced that when it comes to a wedding that all the attention is on the bride amen the whole thing even the groom's not allowed to see the bride in the wedding dress right and so there's this great preparation the man is standing at the platform the groom getting ready to get married everybody's just sitting down and but when the bride walks in everybody has to stand up and give honor to the bride amen there's such an honor everything is placed everybody's looking at the bride they're not looking at the groom now I tell you where there's coming a time where all creation is groaning looking who is going to who did the who did Jesus Christ choose to be the bride amen and looking at her beauty and truly the the beauty of the church is the character of Christ amen so this is what we need to function as a healthy church amen now character is seen in how we act and how we worship and how we pray but it really the deepness of character is manifested in how we react in our hardest trials amen we know character is built in the fiery furnace of Trials amen that's right Bible or brother bam taught us that God is hid in Simplicity but he's also reveals himself in Simplicity now I believe uh our character is developed in Trials but is also revealed in trials amen you put a tea bag in hot water and you see what kind of what's really in the tea bag cuz you line up 20 tea bags they all look the same same size they all look the same but you put them in hot water you see how they react and then you know what they are amen take a look at job job was a perfect man and uh he had character he he prayed he made sacrifices for the sins even of his own children amen and and God looked at job and says you considered my servant job he's perfect there's none like him in all the world and you know and Satan didn't say oh wow yeah he sure is I can tell it's not what he said he said oh he's just that way he just coming to church and paying his ties so he can get whatever he can get from you he says but if you just put him through the test take everything away we'll find out if he's just still going to have that that Integrity for you amen see even Satan himself could identify what true character Christ was that when everything's taken away you're still staying true to God Amen you notice he never gave an offense even to those that accused him of sin because that's what the character of Christ is and that's what is needed in a church to take care of BS now understand in every Church there's three types of Believers amen and we always believe that the the the mate Believers and the unbelievers don't ever come that's what we believe but in in reality everybody is not going to have the character of Christ in a church and it's okay but if the bride has it yes she'll take care of the problems amen you understand what I'm saying if the bride has it she knows how to take care of the problems because she's been equipped with the character of Christ just like how Christ takes care of problems we take a look at Abraham even at the end it wasn't until the end when God said now I know you love me see it was at the hardest trial the deepest trial where he had to give up the very thing that God promised him and that's where character was really shown he didn't quit didn't stop didn't call God a liar didn't throw in the towel and say ain't worth it he howed to his character amen he howed to God's word Now The Church Must develop the character of Christ amen she must grow up in unto him in all things which is the head even Christ that's what the our our our scripture is we' we've got to grow up we've got to get the character now we can't just sit around and keep complaining because somebody else isn't doing their job amen amen now this is this is a great service for our homes and our marriages too our families it's not just for the church but you'll see too often we can function as an unhealthy body brother Braham did say the body of Christ was the sickest body he knew of Amen we have the tendency of handling situations in our flesh either we have an attitude of I'm going to straighten them out or we just have an attitude of ignoring the situation all together and both of those is in the flesh Believers can can have a form of godliness but they don't want to wash people's feet they don't want to feel for others enough they don't want to carry burdens they don't want to be a committed Christian to the to the body of Christ see there are people that come to church and they're they're they're committed to the church they're committed to the body of Christ in the church and then there are others who come to church who are just associated with the church they go to the church or oh this is where we go they they're not they're not committed to faithfulness they're not committed to a lot of things they're just Associates not everybody that goes is is committed but when it comes to being the Bride of Jesus Christ we've got to be committed to his body now if we're going to function better as a healthy church then we're going to have to get more of the love of God that's it that's where it all stems from the love of God we have to learn to speak the truth in love we have to put into practice supplying the needs to one another now I'm counting on each and every every one of you to do your part to help us because you're a part of the church amen take time to say Lord what would you have me to do God has placed you here for a purpose amen I believe it's to edify those that are around you to in the love of God wherever you go God wants you to Shine the Light why not Shine the Light here amen come on why not be Christ here be an example to the Believers don't despise your youth just you know get serious about this about being all of Christ you know too often we come to church all for ourselves and not to just be what Christ wants us to be God wants us to make an increase to the body the Bible says said in the message influences 63 says oh if we in the church as the members of the body of Christ could only work in harmony like that you would see a great Mighty Church of the Living God all in one array filled with with the Holy Spirit wouldn't it be wonderful every member of the body functioning just exactly to its place every gift to its place every gift helping the other every member helping the other that would be wonderful that what we want to see how do I know that I love God enough that's important how do I know I got character because I say I do to become the church that God wants us to be we need to learn to recognize the enemy not just in others because we're pretty good at that but we need to learn to recognize the enemy in our own minds Satan is the accuser of the Brethren and we know the devil can't do anything to any one of us he can't do anything unless he got a vessel to work through and think about all the times the devil has used you to accuse somebody just look at how many times you had to say sorry to the Lord amen we that's the evidence that we don't recognize the enemy enough so how does how does the devil trick us the devil camouflages himself with a false light what does that mean brother John it's a light but it's not pure light it's light but it has a little darkness in it you've seen bulbs that just kind of get dimmer and dimmer and dimmer well even like a a dim dimmer switch right the light's still on but it's not pure light amen and and this is how the devil tricks a lot of Us 2 Corinthians 11:13 says for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ in other words they're just acting like an apostle amen and and don't Marvel there's people like that out the world for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore there's no great thing of his ministers be transformed into transformed as Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works the devil has the ability to trick us and hide himself when he's speaking right to us he uses a bit of truth that's the problem brother BR said in the message the Harvest time he says notice speaking of the the false Church said she had power but it was false power she took part of the world word and didn't take the rest of it right he said what is the biggest lie that was ever told he said it's got 99% truth in it amen wow I would think it would be the one that had 0.1% in it and the rest was a lie no but the greater the light with a little deception is the greatest lie amen the devil camouflages in everything he uses everything you name it he'll use it the more busier are in life the more distractions you get the better chance you're going to get tricked amen he'll camouflage himself in problems he'll camouflage himself in your desires the things that are right the things that are wrong he'll he'll camouflage himself in the cares of Life the devil doesn't always use the same thing over and over he mixes it up brother Peter brother Peter in 1 Peter 5'8 he says you know this you don't have to turn there be sober be vigilant because your adversary of the devil as a Roy L walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist deadfast in the face you got to recognize him to to resist them knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world so here the devil is walking around mixed in so many things camouflaging himself and his goal is to devour you yes that's right amen so if we're walking in our carnality and our flesh we're not going to recognize his approach we've got to walk in the spirit right amen Paul said to the Galatians this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of can you what a what a promise right Galatians 5:116 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh but you understand walking in the spirit is not a gift when you wake up and you say oh God doesn't mean you're walking in the spirit you've got to crucify the old man amen you've got to say I'm done with this carnal thoughts and trying to figure it out and doing it my way God I want you and only you amen for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another so that you cannot do the things that you would our adversary the devil is walking about seeking whom he may devour right what does that mean you want to remember the devil's always seeking to get us to where God is Not he's trying to get us to do something we shouldn't do he's trying to get us to go somewhere we shouldn't go whether it's in our minds whether it's in our eyes whether it's driving doing he's always trying to get us to go somewhere that we shouldn't go amen now there are obvious things like a bar strip club robbing a bank looking at inappropriate things but there are also not so obvious things like a busy body in another man's business amen like esteeming our own self like looking after our own things only like proving we're right like building our own reputation like caught up in our own life living primarily for ourselves amen now there are many places the devil tempts us that we shouldn't go to he's seeking to devour us spiritually right he's trying to get us to a place where God is not God is not in those things not the nature of God so I want to just talk a lot about examples because I want I want you to be able to identify let's say we're walking in the flesh and somebody does something that we don't agree with this is a pretty typical example would you you say Amen now because you're in your flesh you're most you're you're lot less likely to catch the devil approaching you because your pride you know somebody does something that you don't approve of your pride is going to just automatically be the open door for the devil to come in into your mind the devil tells you that a person is wrong or you want to go straighten them out how often does the devil tell you that that's wrong I'm when I get the opportunity I'm going to tell them now if we think that won't work we'll simply be too afraid don't do nothing see we're tempted to either judge that person quietly in our heart or just totally ignore or we might be tempted to share our thoughts with another person in the church right amen I'll just share it with my with my look at that is not Christ it's the open door to start talking amen but that is not functioning as a healthy body that means you're just associate in the church get committed amen get committed to help but that means I got to get my hands dirty yes that's what it means I don't know if I want to do that but then you're actually saying I don't know if I want the character of Christ enough because that's what it takes we've got to develop that we've got to put our heart into becoming what we're not not I'm not taking away the character that we have I'm talking about what we're not possessing that's what we got to go after amen we're going to be healthier amen look I'm not taking away from the the carrots and the vegetables that you're eating and the the exercising that you're doing five minutes a week but maybe we need to do some more are you with me all right Satan's goal is to stir the pot of confusion just every evil work just Stir It Up he just he wants to start things he first starts them in our mind and that the devil has a way of just giving us a lot of imaginations and then we've been instructed by the Bible to cast him down right but sometimes we don't we end up talking about them sometimes we end up falsely accusing other people sometimes we we end up just I'm staying away from them tell me where is Christ in any of that right that's not healthy that means you're not Discerning that that there's another part of the body that isn't you amen that's what that is amen now when we're walking in the spirit we notice a person is wrong or he did something wrong I want you to know if you're walking in the spirit the first thing is your motive is pure God is not going to let you walk in the spirit if your motive is not pure your motive has to be pure Titus 115 says unto the pure all things are pure right but unto them that are def and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and their conscience is defiled they profess that they know God but in their Works they deny him being disobedient and unto every good work a reparate now look if I'm going to be the bride my mind has to be pure I have to be pure at my motives have to be right Amen brother Brandon said it so many times check your motive check your objective you just can't be the last thing you want to do is paint a p a picture of Christianity on you trying to be a uh hypocritical you don't want to stick peacock feathers in just be genuine on the inside and God will lead you God will give you what you need too often we try to you know handle things carnally in the flesh because we think we're right and even if you're right the spirit's not right if a Believer is walking in the spirit their thoughts are pure because unto the pure all things are pure but if a person is walking into the flesh their thoughts are not going to be pure about others can you say Amen now look let's just get into the word let's say Amen because it's a true word it's a true word and we've all come short in our thoughts amen Amen brother says 100 times a day we backslide am it takes a pure motive to walk in the spirit of God they that worship me must worship me in spirit and truth I say if we're going to walk in the spirit our motives are pure and not what I'm I'm really pushing that because you can that gives you confidence if your motive is right you can have confidence your motive is pure your your confidence is there because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world so when we're walking in the spirit our motives pure our confidence is because Christ is on the inside and we notice a person is wrong or that he did something wrong what do we do our motive is purely to help them it's not mixed right we want to Bear the burden we want to fulfill the law of Christ and we have confidence to do that because of the Holy Ghost Inside of us is wanting to lead them into all truth now if this is not operating inside of us we just simply need more of the Holy Ghost that's right amen we need to get more we need to get serious about spending time because coming to church don't give you the Holy Ghost amen coming to church does not give you the Holy Ghost amen but when you hear the word and it's real to you then you'll go seek the Holy Ghost amen you'll start being obedient to the word of God that you're hearing and that will bring the Holy Ghost amen amen now when we're walking in the spirit we're walking in the love of God Amen it's powerful you'll lay down your life for your friend amen it'll break every stron stronghold amen it'll bear whatever it needs to Bear because it Bears all things and you need that in a church to be healthy everything ain't going to go you know really easy it can be difficult but you know what when you have the love of God you're willing to reach down your time and help somebody you're willing to get your hands dirty help somebody functioning as a healthy body requires spiritual Believers willing to overcome and to help others overcome amen you have to first overcome the thoughts in your own head right you have to overcome the devil here have to recognize the devil here before you can actually help somebody I'm not say you know you don't even got to be spiritual and you can see people's got faults hey before I was ever Christian I knew all the faults my dad had my brother had my friends had teachers had because the devil shows me but he doesn't give me the character to deal with it see but God does Amen the Holy Ghost does shows you those same problems and now you that love inside of you wants to help amen well brother John you just can't help everybody okay I'm going to say amen for a second to that statement but you'll still lay down your life for everybody amen right amen so instead of making that an excuse why don't we just start putting into practice to somebody else that you can't help right because you know Faith grows it's got to be exercised character is something that builds it'll never be handed to you just because you came to church amen just because you pay I'm telling you if you're not going through the furnace you're not getting character amen and I'm saying you got to go you got to make the right decisions when you're in the furnace F got to make the right decisions amen Galatians chapter 6 verse one Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also so be tempted now not just anybody can go help anybody that's what that scripture is telling me true because a spiritual person his motive is to restore it's to help it's not to tell them the wrong it's not to tell them to stop doing it it's literally to help them it's to restore that word is restored and and then for those that are not really don't know what it means to be spiritual you've got to have a spirit of me neatness that's scripture amen and then it says considering thyself lest thou also be tempted well i' never do you know I'd never do what they did Brother John he not talking about that bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ for if a man think himself to to be something when he's not nothing he deceiveth himself and I'll just say it like this a person that goes to try to restore somebody without the spirit of meekness is deceived yes he is absolutely deceived they don't realize that the devil could attack them if you're going to defeat the Devil with a wrong Spirit if you think you're going to defeat the Devil with the wrong Spirit you're deceived because there's when it comes to evil there's nothing greater than a devil and Humanity or human wisdom or human intellect or or humanness doesn't defeat the Devil you need the power of the Holy Ghost amen and there's something that comes with a spirit of meekness yes there's power there's power in a spirit of meekness the world may look at it as all it's just a pushover right so I'll say first first check your motive are you just trying to correct somebody or do you love this person enough to lay down your life to help them are you willing to give your time are you willing to lay down your pride and see this person through through what through the process of restoration and it could take a long process right you know we sing that song Sometimes God's still working on me it's a process am how many times you as parents your kids were just acting up and you just said oh you just shut up would you just stop would you just quck would you just give your dad and mom a break would you just go to your room right do you ever ever imagine God acting like that toward you yeah you see so we need the power that comes from having the right spirit amen can't get the power to handle things right if you got the wrong spirit amen so if we don't have the spirit of meekness when we're trying to help someone we're a target for the devil if you can't you're going to go in and you're going to convince somebody of something if you don't have the right Spirit if you don't convince them if you don't least get them to a place as brother brand says we may not see eye to eye but we should be about to see Heart to Heart yes if we don't get to that place you just go in there and you attack somebody because you know they're wrong I'm telling you that Spirit on them is going to attack you it's going to when you try to expose an evil spirit on somebody and they that Spirit don't want to be exposed it'll attack it'll attack you it'll try to attack you no we we we've read stories of you know brother brandom when he would uh pray over somebody and and and uh that that Spirit would just kind of try to come out and we see that in the in the Bible when people are possessed with the devil but listen people can be uh oppressed with evil spirits on them and those spirits will try to attack you when you when if you don't have the power of the Holy Ghost in your life you that try to correct your husbands or your wives or your children you don't do it with the right Spirit they'll just start lashing out at you I've seen it many times people start acting like the spirit that attacked them absolutely those of us who have watched our children closely or watch really anybody if you see somebody hang out with a certain type of person you'll see they'll start acting like that person and there are certain times you don't want your children or somebody to hang out with somebody so remember it's always important it's not remember this no matter what it's not the action that happens but the reaction brother bradam said right so we understand that people are not right but you got to be careful that you don't have a just a carnal Spirit dealing with something because you're going to you're going to end up acting like them all right so let's I'm going to take some examples here look at jealousy jealousy produces jealousy in another person let's just say a husband and a wife there's a one of them had did something made the other person jealous well the first thing you know it the person that's jealous is going to try to get the other one jealous are you with me come on it's a real thing it's happened I've experienced it you get three girls together two of them are connecting pretty good one of them not whoa oh that one that's not is going to express a jealousy say something to get the other person to and that ball just starts rolling amen Spirits are real in a church amen take a person who's got a spirit for a a a desire for money we could say a lust for money but or a love for money but a desire for money they just I mean that's really important to them it's so important to them they think about it quite a bit and someone start talking to that person that spirit will try to get on that person and all of a sudden they'll be yeah man you know they got a point that maybe yeah maybe I could get some well you've heard of salesman right they're trying to sell you something and if they're good salesman they can get you to buy into it these are spirits take a person who's trying to build up their own reputation when somebody's talking to them they and they're trying to build their own reputation they're going to feel a little bit and they're going to want to build themselves up see that a spirit is attacking them and they don't even realize it amen but the beauty of the church is the character of the people so learning to function as a healthy Church it takes the character of Christ it takes a right spirit we' got to handle things the way Christ handles things knowing how to handle something is not enough you can know how to handle something but not have the power of the Holy Ghost to handle it in other words the Temptation is so great that you just have to get one thing straight but Christ in us can handle things the right way they a person who's angry at you for something has anybody ever been angry in your home amen they're angry because you did something they didn't like and they're not handling it right maybe they let it f Fuster F Fuster for some time Fester Gunsmoke so they finally got the they just blew their top they're coming out at you and they're going to let you know well automatically if you don't have a right Spirit of meekness you're going to be tempted they shouldn't be treating me like that you shouldn't have said that the Reas before you know it you're angry at them right and in our carnal mind we just all feel Justified about the situation but it takes a bigger person to get underneath another person it takes a spirit of meekness Amen to deal with situations amen and to make a healthy relationship because if you're arguing and fighting all the time that's not healthy when somebody gets angry at you brother James what do we do when somebody gets angry at us what's the Bible say somebody just gonna fly off the handle and you shouldn't have done this both if you got a spirit of meekness you're just going to give a soft answer and it's going to turn away the Wrath amen that's what the scripture tells us so we know it but we need the power of it we need the Holy Ghost Inside of us that's ready to give a soft answer when we've been treated wrong when we've been told wrong that's what we need in our church but too often we come in here with our Badges of Pride they shouldn't have done that to me who are they to say that who are they to think that may maybe God is wanting to prove how perfect we are I don't want to fail them I don't want to fail brother Marty I don't know what he's saying up there but if he puts me through a test I want to pass it amen I want to pass that test often times we use human wisdom to handle situations that involve evil spirits think think about that we're going to use human Humanity to deal with an evil spirit things up things end up becoming more confusing there's more Strife there's more of a division there's more of a misunderstanding there's more of a separation more bitterness so when we're dealing with evil we need something more something greater than just Humanity we need the power of the Holy Ghost in us we need him to take over we need his wisdom his Spirit his leadership CU we're not equipped to do it amen and we're talking about being a spiritual church amen we need a spiritual God inside of us right look at James chapter 3 for a little bit now we're not going to be to get through this but that's okay we'll get through what we can get through so there are carnal ways to handle problems and there are spiritual ways no problems I say if you uh are trying to move a dirt pile from here to there or you're trying to get the snow off your sidewalk or you're you you you you naturally you just do it but now if somebody's just laying on the sidewalk or laying on the Dirt Pile and doesn't want you to do it now there's a spirit that you have to deal with amen and it's our job to to work through that problem and if you weren't through it good enough they might be helping you to tr the side block when you're done all right James chapter 3 verse 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you okay it's a question I want to see Hands who feels who believes that you are a wise man and endued with knowledge among you I just want to see a show of hands one okay well look it this is the word of God we got to be this we've got to be this it says let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom now the question is not to the man who is knowledgeable of the human realm but of the spiritual realm amen a man that handles things must handle them with a spirit of meekness and here it is said meekness of wisdom there's wisdom in meekness amen amen but if you have bitter envy and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom does not come from above but it is Earthly Central and devilish right amen H amen so think about when you're trying to work out a problem and you got Strife anger bitterness you got those things you know inside of you going on just stop just stop get your heart right because you're not going to be able to handle the situation right now amen most of us that had kids when the kids were little real little we could say don't do that clean that up go into your room and they would do it but when they got older you couldn't say that you couldn't because they're maturing they're learning Mom Daddy ain't supposed to talk to me like that then you got to start using wisdom amen because they're old and look when we're dealing with people they got problems you need the wisdom of God right it's not about knowing what's right or wrong this question is who's ued with from uh who's wise Among Us who's got the the the knowledge of Christ amen we can't have bitter envy and and strife in our hearts no matter how much you think you're right all right verse 16 for where envy and and strife is there is confusion but we know who the author of confusion is Right amen and every evil work worldly wisdom to me is an Open Door for the devil to march in do is dirty work but the wisdom that is from above number one it's pure there it is to the pure all things are pure pure motives then Peaceable gentle easy to be intreated full of Mercy full of good fruits without partiality and without hypocracy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace wow Lord fill me with that amen fill me with the wisdom that's from above to me Jesus lived Proverbs he lived the Book of Proverbs he grew and he whacked strong in spirit and in wisdom the Bible says he he taught wisdom in Parables like our last service we talked about but the thing is when he handled situations he handled them with what's being described here with as wisdom from above he handled them gently and there's there's a lot of examples about this look at the woman that they brought to Jesus who was caught in adultery these were religious men they knew their they knew what the word said yes amen and there they came to to Jesus with their word worldly wisdom and they said this is what the the word says and we should Stone them but you know what do you say what do you say well he he used the wisdom that was from above amen it was it was pure it was gentle it was easy to be entreated just kind of step back made him think about what they were doing for a minute he didn't put them in a headlock and punch him in the face no just step back and we don't know what he wrote in the say but finally he said okay he that's without sin Let Him cast the first stone now to me that was the wisdom of God Amen that was meekness now he knew they were all wrong that could have been what he was writing and saying that's right but you know he didn't condemn he just let him walk away and then to the woman he didn't condemn her either just go don't do it no more because God is in the business of restoring you know too often we just need to you know we just have this carnal spirit in us in our flesh that we just want to handle everything in the flesh that's that's not where Christ is at no matter how much you think you're right amen and there are so many examples in the bible where jesus used wisdom from above if you're going to help somebody be Peaceable he sold peace in that situation and then he got peace out of it we make peace we either make peace or we destroy it right we're supposed to pray for the Peace of Israel we're supposed to be peacemakers blessed are the peacemakers amen we have our brother Jonathan has made mention that there's power in the tongue that's right it can bring life to a situation it can edify or it can bring death to a situation and to me if you really really want to be the bride of Christ ask God for wisdom we we don't got time to get into this but we know James tells us that if any man lacks wisdom he's no respector of persons right just let him ask right and God will give it to him I want to be that I pray for wisdom every day I pray for the Holy Ghost ghost more Holy Ghost every day I pray for more of him every day because I want to represent him I don't want to just stand with some badge and say yeah I believe the message and I got all the uh Mysteries understood and I know everything no I want to be a million miles from that where I want to be is whatever situation he puts me in I want about to handle it I want about to handle it I tell you as a healthy church that's where we all have to be amen we can't just oh let the pastor do it let this no Pastor can't do everything this is a body Ministry we're supposed to be being led by the Holy Ghost right I don't you know too often I hear about how much you know people know it's like please is that just puffing you up just tell me you got enough power to go take care of it amen I'm I'm depending on you to take the word become healthier I know we're fighting against Spirits look as much as we know what we need to do be healthier to eat better and rest better and exercise we don't do it even though we know it right so we're fighting our naturally we're fighting against something but look spiritually it's the same way we're fighting against spirits that don't want to come and pray Lord we're we're fighting against the devil who wants us to handle life naturally look this message that we heard today about functioning as a healthy body and at part five here this can be applied in our homes be applied in our jobs amen you have wisdom everywhere I'll say it's it's to you who who want it and I'll say to the bride the bride will have it the bride will have it and I'll say I'm going to say this to the bride okay to the bride here
