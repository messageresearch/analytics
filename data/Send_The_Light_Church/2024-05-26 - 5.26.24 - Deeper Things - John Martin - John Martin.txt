don't got to go very far in the day to realize people need the Lord the thing the hardest thing is to get a burden to to reach out and help others well God bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord it's uh I didn't know how many people would be here this Memorial Day weekend but we got a a good amount and we're grateful for each and every one that made it out this morning certainly good to see brother Ferguson back with his family man he was here last Service uh but we didn't get to see him inside the sanctuary so and uh I don't know if it if it's been announced and I hate to be the one to say something but was I say congratulations to Sister Maran is that yes Amen to the whole family God God bless you um the Bible says blessed is he whose quiver is full am amen amen well if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with us this morning to the book of First Corinthians chapter 2 um sure is good to see brother Bill and Sister Laura with us this morning just this morning we was in prayer and just praying uh for them that God would bless them and that we'd have a chance to see them again amen uh this morning we want to talk about the deeper the deeper things of God Amen the deeper things of god let's look to him in a word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you for this special day that we could come and honor the resurrection of Jesus Christ and to be in your presence Lord we do believe that you're here for you promis to be here where just two or three would be gathered together in Your Name Lord you gave us a great consolation that even the angels of Heaven would encamp round about them that would fear you and this morning Lord we we are reverencing you reverencing your word and we just believe that you and a whole host of Heaven is amongst us Lord though Lord our our five senses do not declare it Lord that six sense that you've given your your that that is your people Lord your your bride those that are a part of you you've given given them that six sense to just to know that you're here by Revelation so we thank you for that this morning Lord we we will want to take a moment Lord and uh Lord remember the special day tomorrow that's uh been set aside for those that have uh given their their life uh in some way during the service of Our milatary Lord father we think about if there had not been um uh those in the military uh fighting for this country and what they believed in Lord we wouldn't have the Liberty that we have here to gather together today we would probably be under some other kind of a dictatorship but Lord we want to thank you Lord for these men Lord not only that have given their lives Lord but each and everyone Lord in the service father we thank you for Calvary and giv your life you're our hero that you gave your life in this service that we might be set free spiritually we praise you and we worship you this morning come bless your word to our hearts open our eyes help us to see the deeper things of God this morning we'll be careful to give you honor and praise for all these things Lord as we wait upon thee in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you let's read here in second Cor Corinthian or 1 Corinthians chapter 2 just two verses verses 9 and 10 but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of men man the things which God have prepared for them that love him but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God amen God bless you you may be seated this morning we'll allow you to be seated as long as you stay entered into the service amen the deeper things have you ever had a want to have a conversation a little conversation with somebody and go deeper into the conversation with someone uh but they just didn't want to go like they they weren't interested in going there maybe uh they're trying to avoid the subject maybe it can feel like a a a a shallowness with that person because they're unwilling to just go deeper in the conversation and just say things the way they feel and it can cause us to be to feel a little disconnected from that person um you know what I'm talking about all right I think we've all experienced it to too often people aren't really interested in going deeper with God I say too often people aren't really interested in going deeper with God some feel it's it's too much work it takes too much commitment and and they're not uh willing to do that in fact some people actually like being shallow with God there's like less responsibility there and there are others who simply feel they already have a deep relationship with Christ Deep In Christ but so for various reasons people have a hard time wanting to get deeper into the things of God and those who are interested in going deeper into Christ are only willing to go deeper if it's just a matter of learning for some going deeper in Christ is getting more knowledge breaking down the Mysteries or dissecting the Bible or figuring out the last part of the seventh seal the trumpets or the timelines and things like that but going deeper in Christ has very little with gaining knowledge Paul told Timothy the Believers in the end time would be ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth you can find that in second Timothy chapter 3 but that knowledge of the truth that means coming into full discernment of Jesus Christ fully Discerning Jesus Christ in the end time message Believers Never Come to maturity we see that even in this age they're satisfied with just being in the message but they really never come to a maturity that what this message brought amen it's good it's one thing to say that we know that God sent a prophet and we we got the truth but it's another thing to be to be living what God brings us although God may not want us to know all things and he doesn't how many times we have questions why did God do this it's true that he doesn't want us to know all things but he does want us to come into a deeper relationship with him right Jesus said in John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you can't bear them now amen so there's a deepness that God wants to have with us but we're not prepared for that deepness so there's an absolute desire in God's heart for all of us to go deeper with him the fact that we're having a a hard time with handling the things that he would say to us shows us that there is a a deeper things that God has for us a lot of times people don't like dealing with difficult things because they simply can't handle it and we could be missing out on the deeper things of God just because we can't handle it you know a lot of people they want to they want to be in a service where they just only thing that they want to feel is feeling good but but our flesh has to die or else we're catering to the flesh too often our flesh gets in the way of the deeper things of God and we're going to see this morning by the grace of God that that God wants us to set our affections upon him and we can see the scripture here in Colossians 3:1 if he then be risen with Christ can you say Amen to that are you risen with Christ amen the instructions are to seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on the things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God you ever play hide and and seek and you're just alone and and and and maybe you're with somebody and they're and and they and there somebody's trying to find you and you're hid and you hope you don't you don't get you know they don't find you and when you're in Christ the devil can't get to you that's right but when you're out there you're you're you're Satan is looking for those that are out of the spirit that are in the flesh walking in a carnal way amen seeking whom he may devour but when you're in Christ you can't be devoured amen all right the scripture says when Christ who is our life shall appear then ye shall appear with him in glory so we need to set our affections on things above the thoughts of God we know that the thoughts of of God are higher than our thoughts so we can't just think the normal things that would think during the day and expect that to be the thoughts of God it's not we need to exercise our mind on Christ we need to entertain thoughts of of love and making God happy and how we can do that amen if our human nature gets interested in the deeper things of God uh it will look for the easiest way to do it you understand what I'm saying right I'm saying an intellectual way a way that just requires the mind to do all the work some schooling or learning some books or or some podcast or some teaching or philosophy and this is the way that people feel that they get deeper into God is doing these things brother brandham said that seminaries that are really made to teach people about God are the things that take Believers further away from God Paul said what things were gained under gained to me under Gia these things have I counted loss for Christ he said I suffer the loss of all things and do count them as but D that I might win Christ so we those things that we any other way than by the revelation of Jesus Christ cannot help us with God cannot help us find favor with God there's got to be a dividing line between you trying to do it and humbling yourself to love God and let him come in your heart and and reveal himself to you man's way is not God's way Remember The Men Who desired to make a Tower of Babel they said in Genesis 11:4 go to and let us build us a city and a tower look at the motive here whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the Earth let us make a name let us reach up to heaven let's let us do it the denominations wanted to make a name for themselves you know Paul wanted to make a name for himself the devil offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world the devil try to get brother brandom to make a name for himself preachers in this Mage try to make a name for themselves most everyone wants to make a name for themselves but Christ made himself of no reputation so God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same Simplicity here in in in Matthew chapter 11 we've read these scriptures but just trying to to lay a foundation Jesus said in Matthew 11:25 I thank thee oh father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things what things the deeper things The Reel the re the Deep things of God from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes wow so there is an incidence where God can look at a parent and say you know what you just don't get it and look at the the child and teach that child what's right or wrong even so father for so it seem good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of the father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him so what are we looking for for the deeper things of God we're looking for God to reveal I can't do that it can't come from the pulpit it can't come even from our own uh uh works of of opening the Bible and and reading and and and putting on a tape that just don't get the job done unless it's mixed with something are you with me I wonder why God has hid it from the wise and The Prudent just to trying to be keep things simple here is because they're unwilling to repent amen good to see brother Orlando Back God brought him back saved they're unwilling to repent think about that H that's why they're called wise and prudent they wanted to to know the deeper things of God without repenting they they built this Tower they wanted to go up and reach into heaven but you know they weren't willing to just follow the word of God they they wanted to do it their way right there's a way that seeth right to man but the but the end is the way of death so the wise and prudent are men that are smart they're educated they're mentally able to put things together they weigh out their options very carefully before they act upon them they base each decision upon the knowledge that they have for the situation and there are there are many wise and prudent men that don't like repenting because of their own confidence right every man being right in his own eyes but Jesus thanked the father that he hid it from these type of people 1 Corinthians 1:26 for ye see your calling now just take a look at your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called to the truth I'm saying that uh all all everybody's called right everybody's got a chance but what I'm saying here is God hasn't elected that type of a man to have that that type of uh uh uh fleshly pride in the kingdom of God it it just can't be um and and what happens when a person gets so full of Pride it's you when you know Pride people people that are full of Pride they have the hardest time with things it's just like it's a part of their character and that thing the character has to be denounced and they view they View their proud character often as they did something proud and that they're sorry that they did something proud but they never deal with the character are are you with me amen and and that's why there's not very many of them called but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God have chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are Mighty and the base things of the world and the things that which are despised despised have God chosen yay the things which are not to bring to na the things that are and what's the reason that God has done this that no flesh should glory in his presence no wise nor prudent is going to glory in his presence so the very fact that you see somebody gloring gloating and gloring you can just guarantee God's Not There God just isn't there God isn't in that type of atmosphere in fact he resists the proud the Bible says he resist that type of spirit 1 Corinthians chapter 2 are you with me can you say Amen to the word of God now if I say anything that's not the word of God you are allowed to not say anything 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse one and I Brethren when I came unto you I came not with the Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God and another words I I didn't bring anything when I brought the word of God to you for I determined not to know anything among you just just just one thing save Jesus Christ and him crucified for I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power you want to know to me what the one of the greatest demonstrations of the Holy Ghost in somebody is that it does not allow the flesh to come out it's in control it's it's it it it it has the body in control we look at uh the power of of of that that God using that vessel to do things outwardly here that's God's choices but it's our choice whether we let the flesh come out and try to get some Glory at the same time things are happening are you with me all right that the reason for this is that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in just the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect God is speaking wisdom Among Us amen among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not now we know what the wisdom of this world is right it's not vain Glory the Bible teaches is it's not bitter Envy or Strife it's not using these five senses or these 16 uh elements uh or enticing words or confusion and the reason is that that God that doesn't want your faith to stand in the wisdom of men and to try to have to figure things out in the midst of all that confusion God is he's the same yesterday today and forever ever and if we can just learn his nature and then duplicate that in our life seek that in our life set our affections on becoming a Christian that I is bearing the life of Jesus Christ but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory Jesus uh uh Jesus his life Express the wisdom of God how he handled things we' seen the wisdom of God displayed in everything he did even at Calvary and and look James describes it as first pure Peaceable gentle easy to be in treated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without without hypocrisy Paul said which none of the princes of this world knew for if they had known it they would have crucified the Lord Of Glory so we think about how did Jesus handle uh Calvary so here we got Judas coming in and betraying him with a kiss and he never said you get you get away from me you devil why do you portray me with a kiss what and got the the soldiers they came back and and and and and they they went to take Jesus what's going on I was with you all the time why are you taking me now and the disciples wanted to start fighting for the rights cut off the cut off a servant's ear what' Jesus do without respect to persons reach down pick up the air puts it on them you're seeing the wisdom of God was in demonstration in the battle he just he was led to Calvary like a lamb wasn't forced he went willingly nobody takes his life he laid down his life he trusted in the father this is the true wisdom of God but the Bible says that even the devil did know what was going on or else he would have never crucified him think about the devil who was made way before before we came into manifestation and God hid it from him God knew about it before the foundation of the world right it was in heaven but he hid it from him God kept The Greatest Secret Calvary from the devil but think about it he's revealed it to you he's revealed Calvary to you but he kept it from the devil why because Satan wouldn't repent he's wise and prudent but you repented and that's why he's revealed it to you we're blessed we're blessed God hid it from Satan but he's revealed it to us we are a special people we are the chosen of the lord we are the apple of his eye we are his bride we are the redeemed we are Spirit of his Spirit First Peter chapter 2:9 says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that called you out Darkness Into His Marvelous Light think about of all the people in your family that are walking in the truth he knew you would repent he knew it which in times past you were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but today now have we obtained the mercies of God there's No Mercy For The Devil it's just a matter of time but there's no mercy for the devil now if the devil would have known that crucifying Christ would have unlocked the door uh to our Salvation he would have never ever crucified him he would have never Anointed The unbelievers with those spirits of doubt and and fears and and saying crucify him crucify him away with him give us Barabas because that was all the anointing of the devil on those people amen none of the princes of this world knew for if they had known it they would have not have crucified the Lord Of Glory now God used that same being who caused all of us to sin caus the whole world to sin to actually just be a tool in God's great plan of Redemption it'll ought to make us so happy that God's got everything under control in our lives that we don't have to worry about anything God is still in control he can make it work out for the good he's able to take all the what we think is evil and use it just for you praise God you can't outsmart God you can't even hide things from God you can trick the people but you can't trick God God knows the very motives of our heart he doesn't only know what we're intending to do but he actually knows what Satan's attending to do I tell you we just we we're secure in Christ amen we're secure in Christ now if you want to go deeper into Christ we need to Humble ourselves and call on the name of the Lord the Bible says you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you but how do we actually draw nigh to God can I just go to church read my Bible listen to the tapes maybe stream some Services I say no no no an unbeliever can do that an unbeliever can do that can do all those things we've got to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and actually obey what we're reading what we're listening to what he speaks to us in prayer that's what brother Brandon meant said if you want to be more spiritual read your Bible and pray it meant your heart has to be into following what's going on Amen you know we we we live sometimes double lives double standards and we try to just you know do our part as a Christian then we go and we live in the world and that's not what God has called The Bride to be the he's called The Bride to be one with the bridegroom amen nothing short of that that's going to happen but this is how we get into the deeper things of God 2 Corinthians 7:14 we've quoted this before but this is such a beautiful scripture and helps put me in in my place that no matter where I think I'm at with God that I know what God wants me to do if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves not try to get somebody else humble but humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land see you just can't just do some wishy-washy Lord forgive me of my sins get up and go do what you want to do that is a different message now look at verse 15 now my eyes shall be open my ears attend unto the prayer that is made in what this place in other words if we get our heart right in this place then God is going to pay attention for now I have chosen and Sanctified this house that my name may be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually for ever permanently people come and go but God remains the same yesterday today and forever you can just feel sometimes the presence of God when you come in here nobody else is here too many people are trying to to make a Rapture their own way their own personal way some are Blinded By The Pride that's in them the thing that's is resisting God from helping them they're hanging on to some don't care about how carnal they act like well I'm just being myself well you can just be yourself but God is not coming for yourself God is coming for a bride without spot or without wrinkle he's coming the Bible says that we'll be just like him he's coming for himself Amen manifested in the flesh Paul said uh uh I Brethren could not come unto you as unto spiritual but when I came unto you as un to carnal children in Christ now you know the scripture it's in Corinthians I believe you just want to write that down that's going to be chapter 3 you want to write that down 1 Corinthians chapter three I have fed you with milk and not with meat hither to you were not able again to Bear it just like Jesus said neither yet are you are ye able now are you able so Jesus wanted to say many things but he couldn't say it Paul wanted to say uh many things to the to the Believers but they couldn't bear it because they were carnal they didn't want to go deeper into Christ in other words they were unwilling to repent unwilling to fear God more than they were doing unwilling to keep more of The Commandments and the Bible tells us that's the whole duty of man to fear God and to keep his Commandments Paul said for ye are yet carnal whereas there is among you envy strife divisions I'll just say like gossip are you not carnal and walk as men this is a church for believers while one saith I'm a Paul and another says I'm of Apollos are you not carnal I follow brother so and so in the message I live dream this and are you not carnal cannot God speak to you where you're at see we're trying to make the Rapture our way and we're missing the way that God has provided for us God has greater things for the bride he has deeper things for those who humble themselves let's take a a closer look at what we need to do to get into the deeper things of God we've got to get to the top of the pyramid the statue of a perfect man that that that Capstone is love and we got to get there are you with me all right let's just continue on now but I want to just read but we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which God have before uh ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of the new new of this world knew for they had known it they would have not crucified the Lord Of Glory so God's wisdom doesn't only hide things from the devil or the Devils he hides things from the devilish Natures inside of humans he certainly does we can say we're a child of God all day long but you act like a devil that ain't going to bring God's presence you're not going to have faith to bring God to cross his word to help you you come God's way or you're not coming at all it's all there is to it he gives more grace to the humble verse n but as it is written Eye Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither is it entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him so we cannot know about the things that God has Force by the five senses of man we cannot know them by worldly wisdom or intellect we cannot know the deeper things of God through our head God has kept them from man but verse 10 says but God has what revealed them unto us by the holy spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yes even the Deep things of God and who does God reveal them to to them that love him we just can't go to God's library and search for them we search for them through our love for God and I don't want us to miss this is such an important thing is to those who exercise on a regular basis their relationship with God that it means more to them than anything else that's going on in the on the planet in the home at work work at church just my relationship with God is the most important thing amen they are the ones who God reveals y the Deep things of God to the things that are in heaven I want to give you a little secret here Revelation really equals an experience Revelation equals in experience we know Revelation is Faith it's when God speaks but understand this when God speaks to us personal we now know God in a spiritual realm the Bible says we don't know God after the flesh anymore but after the spirit so what a revelation does for you is it gives you an experience so when Heaven comes down reveals itself to you that means it will manifest in our lives that's why brother Brandon could say eternal life is living for others because that's what happens in heaven that is the nature the core nature in heaven you don't see some of the people who have gone on and made it you don't see the angels in heaven all wanting to do their own things have their own parties it isn't like that there's one will it's the will of God and they live for one another am it's the nature of God you can you cannot separated it it's not an option for the bride of Christ to live for one another but it is an option for the foolish virgin they can take it or leave it and they will leave it but the bride how can they deny the light that's inside of them and it's not something that you even got to put on it's not no peacock feathers it's not no well I got to make this little effort I guess to be no it's just in you it's bubbling out of you you just you care about others it's not about yourself because God you you the only ones that got the true revelation ation that God bought you that God went to Calvary just for you that you are not your own anymore you've been bought with a price so I say brothers and sisters get so much of the Holy Ghost that you want to live for others without respect a persons get rid of your favorite friends get some of your enemies hug some of your enemies Amen brother B said get to the place where you can love every person the same way then you know you got a part of Heaven living inside you God has revealed to you what he has prepared for you in heaven then you already have a piece of it right now here on Earth that's what I'm trying to say it's not like well I got to wait till I get to the other side to find out what's in heaven No Heaven is inside of you that's why you're living the way you're living it's so precious verse 10 but God has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God today if there's a deep calling inside of us for more of God there has to be more of God out there for us to receive and and to not have that calling for more of God is a scary thing I say we need to get back to the altar you know we did so much better when we spent time at the altar you know what I mean we did we said we did so much better spiritually with God I mean I know it hurts the pride it hurts our you know how Macho we look but who cares how Macho we are I mean God chosen the things that look foolish to men that's who he chose to to confound the wise so the the spirit of God searches the Deep things of God and reveals them to us I say it like this it's through the process of a love relationship God has always been interested in the heart of man it's where he chose to communicate with man that's where he chose to uh uh reside inside of man it it's inside the heart but most people want to get deeper with God they use their brain they study they read they they they use this as the avenue to say that they're closer to God because they know more let me ask you something be I want to be I want you to be real with me look at all the things that you know that you don't live like the devil knows those things we can call him a Believer it's not knowing it's getting this flesh crucified that it could live the word God is omniscient he knows all things he knows what's in the heart of man the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 4 that the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts we come to church we hear the word preached not think if our hearts are right we're going to hear from God but if our hearts are not right we're not going to hear from God and I don't care how the word is preached I remember sitting in a church you could hardly say that there was much in it but there was something so personal there between me and God just one word can change your life and if God can use a donkey he can use anybody right brother Ron if he can use a donkey he can use anyone to speak the God's word so if there's a calling deep inside of the heart for the deeper things of God it's through love that they will be made known it's through our love it's by exercising our love towards God that he will reveal more of his stuff and if we don't express that love if we don't if it's just God I'm genuine I'm just just so serious about this I am sick of trying to make it to heaven on my own Tower of Babel my own personal way I want to just I want to tear right down to the foundation right down to the B I want to start at the where you want me to be and I just want to have a love relationship I want to be genuine I don't care about what anybody else thinks I care about what you think God and this is the way it needs to be we need to Humble ourselves we need to our affections on the Lord and the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to us the Deep things of God but it's built on a love relationship now when he reveals it I'll just say it like this you will become it amen you become it you become what he reveals to you that's why if if you think you got something for from God but it is not manifested in your life all you got is the knowledge of it I don't mean to disappoint you you just keep going there until you get the Revelation now it's true that without faith we can't please God but the Bible tells us that we could have all Faith so that we could remove mountains and still be nothing without love so we need faith that worketh by love in other words if our motive and our desire is to please God then that that's the faith that we want to get but to go ahead and have faith just to work miracles and and do all that stuff and not have a love relationship with God that's willing to die out to help your brother or sister brother or sister you got the wrong thing we've got to love God so much with his love that we're willing to do his will First Corinthian 1 Corinthians 13 explains that we could understand eat every mystery have all knowledge and still be nothing without the love of God Galatians 5:6 tells us for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything it doesn't profit anything or uncircumcision so I don't care what side of fence you want to be on but Faith which worketh by love if the reason that you're doing is because you love God God God's going to bless you you know I used to get persecuted a lot for the things that I did for the Lord oh I got called just about everything the motives for everything but I knew that the motive in my heart for doing is because I loved him and if it truly is your reason nothing will stop it from you doing it but if it was really the flesh you'll just get all offended and bothered and you'll stop doing it for what man knoweth the things of a man verse 11 now for what things knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him that's true how many times have you you watched uh I I mean this week I watched a a couple Turtles I I'm always trying to save the turtles crossing the road and I don't know I I I I seen Turtles they want to lay their eggs in the road I just don't get it and and so no no no uh no spe no Turtle knows the things of a turtle save the spirit of a turtle and no no man knows the things of a man say the spirit that's in man why is that so important because the Bible says even so the the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God that's we're depending on God to reveal himself to us we can't just try to figure it out on our own and think we're something they've got to be revealed it's only way we can know them now we have not received now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but that which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual so we don't need to come to church and use a bunch of carnal things to learn about the spirit of God it just doesn't work no spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God the natural man for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually deserved how many times you be honest how many times you come to church and just think oh man I didn't get nothing out of that all as were really saying with that statement or those thoughts is that the natural man went to church yes yes we that's why we brother brand talks so much about preparation get into those prayer rooms and and die out die out to the Natural carnal carnality of what you want to see God do and get into the spiritual realm where you say Lord not my will thy will be done I'm coming with fear and trembling and whatever you ask me to do that I will do because I am your spiritual son I am not your natural son I am your spiritual son it's got to be that real if we want the deeper things of God we must get out of our flesh get out of our wisdom get out of the natural man our heavenly father has hid the Deep things from the wise and The Prudent and he's reserved a revelation to the humble to the hungry to those that come seeking more of him for so it seemed good in thy sight now we all love God is that true amen amen we all do but we need to start exercising more of that love can you say Amen to that yeah we have a spirit that works on us constantly we don't ask Leo deia to be here we don't ask this lukewarm to come and invade our homes our minds our work and just kind of bring us down to humanity we're supposed to becoming more like Jesus every day so if that spirit is attacking us that means we need to start exercising more of the love of God to fight it now God doesn't want some formal relationship with him I'll say this I want you to listen carefully don't misunderstand me neither does God want us want to be known only as a blesser a provider a supporter a helper A Healer now these are great attributes of God but he wants his wife to act the same way he acts and I believe the bride is interested in pleasing her husband now in the world there's a spirit out there where the wife does not want to please her husband brother bandham said it's it's it's a right's age and in fact he went on to say it's a woman's rights age and uh before you know it the women are going to be running everything they're already showing how much more willing they are work to get they're much more willing to work to get on top to get ahead but a woman is out of her place when she's like that and God wants his church to be having a desire a hunger to want to be more like Jesus nothing short of that is going to make God happy you can go around like brother Bram told that story in the choosing of a bride oh God's going to choose me that cowboy is going to choose me oh look at me the way I'm dressed I can do so much I'm talented but there was that little woman in the back room when nobody was there she was putting in all the labor that just being faithful at her poster Duty coming to church when she needed to come to helping when she needed to help washing somebody's feet making a making a way to to to be a blessing that was the character that that cowboy was looking for God is looking for character not abilities he knows you got the abilities because he gave them to you he's the one that just threw him out there severally as he will the Bible says but God is looking no matter what ability you have that you bring your character in alignment with the word of God am and then you know you're just like Jesus amen now God proved his love at Calvary and he proves that commitment to his love every day he gives you new Mercies proving his love to you every day it started at Calvary but then he proves it every day now God wants us to prove our love to him now we proved it at the beginning when we repented we got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins we made a commitment that we're going to serve God the rest of our life but you know what I think a lot of us fall short improving our commitment to love to love God every day amen to walking in his will and keeping his Commandments every day now God is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins if we confess but are we faithful and are we faithful that same faithfulness back to God this is a I'll say one of the most important things that help me understand who God really is is John 14:1 15 and I want you to read this with me St John 14:1 15 Jesus said if if you love me keep my Commandments if in other words you may not you may not now we do know we all so many people love God brother BR even makes this statement we could love God and still miss it so we can love God with the natural part of us that wants to just keep getting blessed by God and God provide and meet my needs and help me with what what this thing that I'm bringing before you in prayer and and but but we want to love God to the point that we're willing to get serious about this word what are the things that God wants me to do so we need to start exercising This Love This Love right here that keeps his Commandments we need to to look for the Commandments that we've been been ignoring we've been setting aside we need to repent from ignoring we need to repent for disregarding them we need to to say Lord I'm sorry I will I will reverence your word more I will reverence your Commandments more amen and I'll say this will touch the heart of God in fact Jesus said be zalas and repent he'll come into our heart but he knocks at the door and he's always always faithful to tell us what we need to do because if we don't do what he tells us to do how can he be pleased with us amen all right we got to hurry up now time is catching away and uh u i just just need you to say you know amen let a little bit more so we can get this train going down the track you are the few you know how fast the train goes down right you get real quiet then I feel I got to go over that a little bit more John 14:21 he that ha my Commandments and keepeth him keepeth them it is he that that truly loves me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him that is so Supernatural to me that's so Supernatural now we think we most people serve a God that they they just look at God that God loves everybody and no matter what he loves you and that's the Revelation they got of God and I'm not taking that away but there is something special that he gives to those that love him back he gives them a greater a greater outpouring of himself and what what Greater Love Can we have of God than to to come and manifest himself right inside of us he's going to show us the deeper things of Heaven Judas saith unto him not as scary Lord how is it that thou will manifest yourself unto us but not unto the world a lot of people don't understand how this love relationship is supposed to work and that's what Judas was really asking how are you going to do that and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me again he will keep my words that's the that's that's the foundation right there of a of a of a relationship with God if you love God you now he's talking about your part we already know his part he went to Calvary He he'll he'll forgive you if you just ask him to forgive you he loves you he'll pour out his blessings on the just and the unjust but he says if you love me if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come onto to him and make our Abode our Abode I like that in other words he didn't say I'll come and visit you I'll come and I'll just come and do a spot blessing no we're we're going to live we're going to stay there in fact when people look at you they're not going to see you anymore they're going to see me in you all because of one word that word there's the there's the tiebreaker if a man loves me it's a love affair it doesn't matter if no one else wants to have this love relationship though none go with me still I'll follow it doesn't matter if no one else wants to work hard at keeping the Commandments in your home you be the one to work hard if you're willing to love God enough to keep the things he spoken to you then God will supernaturally come into our hearts and will begin to manifest the spirit inside of us you know it you know what just being honest with you none of us ever had to learn how to get upset and fight back at somebody when we were growing up we didn't get what we wanted nobody had to teach us this is how you fight fight for your rights but you know it takes the Holy Ghost inside of a man to lay down his life that Christ can be manifested at a time of just nothing but anger frustration just total chaos God has promised us that he would come inside and he would live it out for us so we didn't have to can you bear with me just a little bit longer all right I believe that we'll experience the deeper things of God if we just let the Holy Spirit come in it's a love relationship verse 24 he that loveth me not and keepeth not my Saints and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers that sent me these okay he that loveth me keepeth not my says I'm so sorry I'm going to read that correct corly I don't care if I got to stay here till 1:00 today amen he that loveth me not keepeth not my Saints I wish they just put comments in the right place so that's it you're really if you don't do what the word says you're really just saying you don't love God and the word which you hear it's not mine but the fathers that sent me so the Father in Heaven Jesus and this word they're the same they're all one in other words these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comfort of which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he will he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remance whatsoever I have said unto you the true anointing of the Holy Ghost will always always bring to your remembrance that you need to put your relation relationship with God number one and to love him above everything else there's a lot of things that we can talk about in the word we need them all but don't think that the holy spirit is never going to be reminding you of these things Jesus just said he would when the comforter the Holy Ghost comes he shall remind you of these things well what things is he talking about he's talking about keeping his word and to loving him but by by by by manifesting this love you can Manifest this love simply by simply doing what the word asks you to do in every situation some of you starts gossiping just turn away and say shouldn't do that what you're doing is you're manifesting the love of God somebody's getting angry at you just give a soft answer sincerely from your heart you know what you're doing you just manifested the love of God and this is why what I believe in this is what I believe in I believe in a God who can manifest himself in human flesh that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and there are certain things that only God can do it's got to be his will right everybody's not called to be a prophet right but he did say the works I do you'll do also but that doesn't mean you can go in the hospital and raise everybody out from the hospital it doesn't mean God is going to answer every one of your prayers in the way that you want it to go if I'm saying it correctly but there is one thing that God will never stand in the way is him becoming one in your body if you let him he wants that more than anything is to manifest and he's got to go through through more agency to get that done now anyone can be kind to anyone they want to be kind to anyone can be merciful to anybody want to be merciful to whoever they think's worthy anybody can love anybody that they're being loved back by it's easy right anybody can give when somebody gives to them anybody can forgive if they seem worthy of your forgiveness but the Commandment of God is to love others the way that Christ loves us did God still love you when you weren't loving him at times we all can say yes but what that really means is that we need to start loving others when they're not loving us has God forgiven your trespasses when you trespassed against him we need to exercise forgiving others when they trespass against us has God turned his cheek when you turned his back on word has God given you another chance in other words then we need to learn to turn our cheek and walk the Second Mile more than what might be needed and has the holy spirit interceded for you when you were ignoring him and just kind of doing what you wanted to do just using him that we need to pray for those who despitefully use us say all manner of evil against us in other words that is the life that we should be living with the power of the Holy Ghost some people struggle with knowing how to work with others that they just don't agree with you know some people just have a hard time working with others how many times have you heard I I I could just I do better myself if I got to work with that person you know I just can't do it in Christ we're to be one and I believe this I believe if the holy spirit is inside of you then you can work with difficult situations you can work with difficult people because it's no longer you trying to do it but it's God in you amen and that's just what I believe Jesus said for if you love them which love you what's your reward do not even the publicans the same and if you Salute Your brotherr and only say God bless you I love you good to be with you today what do you more than others do not even the publicans in other words these are shallow things for a Believer the deeper things of God is when he comes inside and he manifest himself inside of our bodies and that we're able to love others and and and salute those who actually have something inside against you something more you know uh hypocritical inside of them are you with me amen I believe that God wants to manifest himself inside of us and I believe when he comes in and he manifests himself to us we will be able to love our enemies we will be to bless them that curse us we've been able to do a lot of good things for others no matter what they're doing all because that God has come inside of us and that's why I'm saying Saints we should not be satisfied with how much God we got we should be looking how we can manifest more of the holy spirit all right turn with me to John 15 and I just want to close with these last set of scriptures here and then we're done is that okay John 15:9 as the father has loved me so have I loved you and his word says now continue in my love he didn't say continue in your love continue to love he said continue in in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I've kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that your joy might remain with you and that your joy might be full how many really sincerely would love to have more of the joy of the Lord well there there's there's there the answer is right here the answer is right here it's doing the things that God wants you to do you know how happy you get when you do something for somebody just makes you feel good that you did something for somebody just imagine how you're going to feel when you do something for Jesus amen this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you Greater Love have no man than this let's stand together that a man laid down his life for his friends Greater Love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends and you are my friends what's that next word if if you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you maybe you could just play quietly I am so so needy Lord you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you maybe we could just take a a moment at the end of this this message and just focus on our our love relationship with the Lord maybe today that you're here and you feel that God has spoken to you and you you want want to put into action this love for him maybe you've kind of let things gone to the side maybe you just haven't focused much done that part but you just been wanting God to to bless you and help you but you've kind of Forgotten maybe the things that he's wanted you to do I don't know I just I just want you to focus on these things and because I believe that God is here to do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think amen let's sing that I am so needy Lord so needy Lord so needy of you I am so needy Lord to be more like you shear all my rights away in this
