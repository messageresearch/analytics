[32:03] oh Lord
[32:06] I believe
[32:09] foreign
[32:11] amen amen
[32:14] I'm so glad that there's Believers in
[32:17] here
[32:18] amen
[32:20] Anything is Possible
[32:24] because there's Believers so we are
[32:26] grateful to the Lord
[32:29] for that amen God bless our our visitor
[32:33] praise the Lord
[32:35] and um brother Eric it's so good to see
[32:39] you in God's house amen the place that
[32:42] we need to be amen God bless each and
[32:46] every one of you this morning good to
[32:48] see
[32:49] um brother Blair
[32:54] and his parents God bless you God bless
[32:58] you very much
[33:00] um
[33:01] brother Brandon said in the message
[33:03] the Samaritan Church age he said the
[33:06] heart purpose
[33:08] and the Eternal purpose of God
[33:10] was to take a bride of his own
[33:14] choosing
[33:16] the very heart purpose the Eternal
[33:18] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[33:21] his own choosing so it's like we can't
[33:25] be the one who initiates
[33:28] the choice it's him that chooses
[33:32] so he sends a call out
[33:35] many are called but few are chosen
[33:38] so my question before we open in our
[33:40] scripture where do you think God
[33:43] is looking for in his choosing
[33:47] what's he going after
[33:51] what do you what what would you go after
[33:53] if you were choosing a mate for eternity
[33:57] I mean it's hard for us think about it
[34:00] it's hard for us that are married
[34:04] to go 80 years
[34:06] with our mate
[34:08] you know the difficulties that we have
[34:10] with one another just being trying to be
[34:12] honest so God is choosing
[34:16] someone for eternity
[34:19] so what is what's that main quality do
[34:22] you think he wants to have with her
[34:25] what's it's got to be a love
[34:28] relationship
[34:30] a love relationship and
[34:33] um I'm gonna ask sister Amanda to put
[34:35] this up on the board but
[34:38] uh it's going to take love to make a
[34:40] rapture
[34:41] and this this is really so fitting here
[34:44] because in the Statue of a perfect man
[34:47] uh it starts out with faith and it ends
[34:51] up with love and not just our love but
[34:54] the love of God and that's what we
[34:56] really need to exit out of here so when
[34:58] you see this sign I want you to be
[35:00] remember what we need to get really get
[35:02] out of here
[35:04] amen turn with me if you would to
[35:06] Philippians chapter 3.
[35:10] last Sunday we we spoke on pure love
[35:13] only
[35:16] and this Sunday we want to entitle this
[35:19] message to pursuit of perfect love
[35:23] the pursuit of perfect love
[35:27] it's not a gift
[35:32] we have to pursue after it here in the
[35:35] book of Philippians chapter 3
[35:40] um
[35:42] Paul is expressing that he he was really
[35:46] something in the world
[35:48] and everything that he was so great in
[35:51] the in the religious world he had to
[35:55] give up to find Christ
[35:59] and even after he found Christ
[36:03] there was still something
[36:06] that he didn't have
[36:11] and so he he expresses it here in verse
[36:16] number 12. I want to begin reading with
[36:18] verse 12-14 not as though I have already
[36:22] attained either we're already perfect
[36:24] but I follow after if that I may
[36:27] apprehend for that which also I'm
[36:29] apprehended of Christ Jesus
[36:31] brother and I count not myself to have
[36:33] apprehended but this one thing I do I'm
[36:36] forgetting those things which are behind
[36:37] and reaching forth unto those things
[36:40] which are before me
[36:42] I press towards the mark for the prize
[36:45] of the High Calling of God in Christ
[36:47] Jesus amen let's look to the Lord in a
[36:50] word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank
[36:52] you for this precious word we thank you
[36:54] for the riches that are contained in it
[36:56] and we thank you for being in our lives
[36:59] for being in our heart for saving us and
[37:02] and reviewing yourself to us that you
[37:05] are the only way to get to heaven and
[37:08] Lord out of all the people
[37:10] of the world you've you've chosen
[37:13] just a few Lord we're part of that
[37:16] number we want to say thank you today
[37:18] with all of our hearts thank you for
[37:20] choosing us thank you for placing your
[37:22] word down deep in our hearts father we
[37:25] pray at this time Lord that your
[37:27] anointing would come not just on my lips
[37:30] and my heart but on the ears and the
[37:32] hearts of the people Lord that as they
[37:34] feed on the word as they receive the
[37:36] word may it become a living Oracle
[37:40] inside their lives father for we want to
[37:42] be ready in that day when you say come
[37:45] up hither
[37:46] we commit this service to you with every
[37:49] need that we have here in our midst
[37:51] representing for we ask these things in
[37:54] Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen
[37:57] God bless you may be seated
[38:03] I just looked up in the
[38:07] uh the Greek what some of these words
[38:10] mean
[38:12] um and the word attained verse 12 not as
[38:15] though I've already attained that word
[38:17] attain means taken or gotten a hold of
[38:21] so it's not just you know handed to you
[38:24] you got to get a hold of it either we're
[38:28] already perfect now that means complete
[38:32] consummate in character consummate in
[38:36] character so that's the part that's
[38:39] missing we know that we've got the
[38:41] spirit of God we know we got him on the
[38:43] inside but there's still something in
[38:45] our lives when we're walking and going
[38:47] through trials that we we're not totally
[38:49] representing him
[38:50] and that's his character he says but I
[38:53] follow after now that word follow after
[38:55] it means to pursue
[38:57] to pursue it if that I may apprehend or
[39:02] take eagerly seize or possess that for
[39:05] which also I'm apprehended of Jesus
[39:07] Christ or Christ Jesus so we could read
[39:11] it just like this not as though I've
[39:13] already taken either or already made
[39:15] complete in character
[39:16] but I am in Pursuit if that I may take
[39:19] it eagerly or seize
[39:21] that for which I am possessed of Christ
[39:25] Jesus aren't you glad that Jesus bought
[39:28] you that uh that that you're in the palm
[39:32] of his hands that that that he has you
[39:35] he he owns you
[39:38] amen and and Paul wanted to have that
[39:42] same thing of God
[39:44] he wanted to pursue that same part and
[39:47] have him the way that Christ has him
[39:51] now he says brother I can't not myself
[39:54] to have apprehended
[39:58] I want you to know my attitude I'm not
[40:01] walking around as if I got what it takes
[40:03] to make it
[40:07] but there's one thing I do I'm
[40:09] forgetting those things which were
[40:11] behind but now he's not really talking
[40:13] about our past sins
[40:18] no he's talking about the things that he
[40:20] has apprehended
[40:22] right the part of Christ that he does
[40:24] have if you st if you keep dwelling on
[40:27] what you do have you're never going to
[40:29] be reaching for more because you're
[40:30] always going to feel it's enough
[40:33] but we need to forget
[40:36] what we do have and realize that there's
[40:38] more for the bride
[40:40] to reach forth for those things which
[40:42] are before and he says I press or pursue
[40:46] it's the same word used in two different
[40:48] verses
[40:50] toward the goal for the prize of the
[40:54] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so I
[40:57] believe the bride today is in Pursuit
[41:00] of the part of Christ that they need to
[41:03] make a rapture
[41:07] first John chapter 4 verse 16.
[41:11] now I want to encourage you to really
[41:13] get into the word because there's a lot
[41:15] here and won't be able to spend a lot of
[41:16] time on each one
[41:19] but
[41:21] uh
[41:23] I believe
[41:25] very much God is in this message today
[41:31] amen first John chapter 4 verse 16 and
[41:33] we have known and believe the love of
[41:37] that God have to us God is love and he
[41:40] that dwelleth in love dwelt in God and
[41:42] God in him
[41:44] and here in is our love made perfect
[41:49] that we may have boldness
[41:52] in the day of judgment you know my
[41:54] people are scared about the day of
[41:55] judgment
[41:56] that we may have boldness in the day of
[41:58] judgment because as he is
[42:02] so are we in this world in other words
[42:06] we don't have to wait to get to heaven
[42:08] to have his character
[42:12] it's something
[42:14] you know when you know that you have
[42:17] done what you've been asked to do you
[42:20] can have boldness I did exactly what you
[42:23] asked me to do
[42:25] and when we do exactly what God wants us
[42:27] to do we can have boldness on the day of
[42:29] judgment we don't have to fear
[42:31] there's no fear in love but perfect love
[42:34] casts out fear because fear of torment
[42:36] and he that feareth is not made perfect
[42:40] in love
[42:42] there's no greater power than perfect
[42:45] love
[42:47] it will cast out all fear think about
[42:49] Jesus when he feared going to the cross
[42:53] I'll say it like this when when fear was
[42:56] trying to attack him
[42:59] and he kept praying on his knees Lord if
[43:03] his father if it's possible let this cup
[43:05] pass from me I my I don't want to go
[43:09] through with this
[43:10] so he was dealing with fear
[43:15] and we all deal with it
[43:17] but you know for the joy that was set
[43:19] before him he endured the cross
[43:21] it was perfect love that cast that aside
[43:25] and he was able to walk up there for you
[43:28] and I
[43:30] verse 19 we love him because he first
[43:33] loved us
[43:34] If any man say I love God
[43:37] it doesn't feel the same way about his
[43:39] brother
[43:41] he is a liar
[43:43] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[43:45] he have seen how can he love God whom we
[43:47] have not seen so and this is what's
[43:49] really hard with the scripture you know
[43:51] we feel that we love God no matter who
[43:53] we hate
[43:55] no matter what problems we have with
[43:58] anybody we feel we love God
[44:00] and that's our feelings
[44:03] that's our feelings because the word
[44:06] says it can't be
[44:07] and if you get so full of hatred because
[44:10] of somebody I can guarantee this the
[44:12] holy spirit's just going to take his
[44:14] flight
[44:15] and he's going to go wait
[44:18] do you repent get that before he comes
[44:21] back on you
[44:25] Brandon said in the message that God had
[44:27] explained he says and I pray father
[44:30] that from my heart that thou will let me
[44:34] expressed to my brethren this morning
[44:37] the motive and the objective of my life
[44:40] to you
[44:42] that they might understand
[44:44] granted that we might have perfect love
[44:49] fellowship and cooperation in all the
[44:53] working of the gospel for we ask it in
[44:55] Jesus name who pray that we might be one
[44:59] as he and his father was one
[45:02] believing this that this will all men
[45:05] know that you're my disciples when you
[45:07] have love one for another amen
[45:11] what a beautiful prayer
[45:15] I believe that the bride of Christ will
[45:17] have perfect love
[45:18] they won't only be in perfect love one
[45:21] for another of the Bride but they will
[45:23] just have perfect love
[45:26] that's what really separates them
[45:30] because anybody can love them that think
[45:31] their bride
[45:33] right
[45:35] but can you love like Jesus loves
[45:38] everyone
[45:41] when we are in pursuit of perfect love
[45:43] we're really in pursuit of being one
[45:45] with God one with his word
[45:49] and so when we're in pursuit of being
[45:52] one with God we're really should be in
[45:55] pursuit of perfect love
[45:57] for God is love and he that dwelleth in
[46:00] love dwelleth in God and God in him
[46:05] brother Brandon said the Tolkien was the
[46:08] highlight of his message
[46:11] he said
[46:12] about the seals when he went through the
[46:14] seals that the Bible became a new book
[46:18] and when he went beyond the curtain of
[46:19] time he said
[46:22] he became a new man
[46:25] he wasn't the same brother ran him over
[46:27] and this is what he said in the rejected
[46:29] King he says if I could make up yonder
[46:32] 100 billion miles high a square block
[46:37] and that's perfect love each step this
[46:41] way it Narrows and narrows until it gets
[46:45] down to where we are now it would be
[46:47] just merely a shadow of corruption
[46:50] that little something that we can sense
[46:54] and feel that there is something
[46:56] somewhere we don't know what it is
[46:59] one billion miles now he's talking about
[47:03] as you get closer to God there becomes
[47:07] less of us and more of him
[47:10] lesser carnality less of hatred lesser
[47:15] and it now he talks about this pyramid
[47:18] not being a short one
[47:20] but a tall one a hundred million you
[47:23] know that's further than it is from the
[47:25] Earth to the Sun
[47:27] think about a pyramid that far and you
[47:30] have to walk up each step
[47:33] I'll tell you that that's all that's a
[47:35] that's a long pressing
[47:39] he says oh my precious friends my
[47:43] beloved he even says my darlings of the
[47:46] Gospel my begotten children of God he
[47:49] said listen to me your pastor you I wish
[47:52] there was somewhere I could explain it
[47:54] to you there's no words I couldn't find
[47:56] it it's not found anywhere but just
[48:00] beyond this last breath is the most
[48:03] glorious thing
[48:05] uh that you've ever there's no way to
[48:07] explain it there's just no way I just
[48:09] can't do it but whatever you do friends
[48:12] lay aside everything else
[48:15] to you get perfect love
[48:17] get to the spot that you could just love
[48:19] everybody every enemy and everything
[48:21] else
[48:23] you know he says that one visit there to
[48:25] me has made me a different man I can
[48:27] never never never be the same brother
[48:30] Branham that I was
[48:32] whatever you do friends lay everything
[48:34] aside to get perfect love
[48:36] in other words pursue it pursue perfect
[48:40] love
[48:41] but the brown never said whatever you do
[48:44] make sure you get all the correct
[48:46] Doctrine
[48:48] or make sure you do all these Works he
[48:52] never even said make sure you get
[48:53] perfect faith
[48:57] no we do need
[49:01] I was going going for the set you a
[49:03] perfect man but it's not up there it
[49:04] starts with faith on the bottom and you
[49:07] need Faith to get where you're going
[49:10] right
[49:11] amen
[49:14] but he said get perfect love
[49:18] because perfect love is what produces
[49:21] perfect Faith now I'm going to read this
[49:23] in the message perfect Faith he says now
[49:25] notice perfect faith is the master of
[49:27] all circumstances and you think about
[49:29] the needs uh we all we all have need of
[49:33] something in our lives I've been praying
[49:35] that God would move in for healing in
[49:38] our church amen
[49:40] that perfect Faith Masters all
[49:42] circumstances no matter what it is it
[49:44] Masters it now just watch when you
[49:46] believe for anything do anything you you
[49:49] got to have faith in what you're doing
[49:50] no matter what the circumstances is that
[49:52] don't make one thing to do with it see
[49:54] it Masters the circumstance
[49:57] if it's in a room of sickness and the
[49:59] Lord
[50:01] reveal that certain things going to
[50:03] happen you just speak it and go on see
[50:04] he says if you're in a room of sickness
[50:08] and
[50:09] the Lord has revealed to you that he's
[50:11] going to do something
[50:13] but you that you need God to reveal it
[50:17] and and where we come into play there is
[50:20] hungering God reveals speak to me I need
[50:23] this for my my body that's the part we
[50:26] play so God moves with compassion upon
[50:30] us
[50:33] he says don't just ask any question it's
[50:35] already over he said just keep going it
[50:37] Masters all circumstances Faith believes
[50:40] that God uh will work it out I don't
[50:42] know how he's going to do it but he's
[50:44] going to do it see it Masters the
[50:46] circumstances and faith and love is
[50:48] relation
[50:50] he said faith and love is relation
[50:54] because you can't have faith unless
[50:56] you've got love
[50:59] because your faith is in a God Who is
[51:02] the very essence of love
[51:06] faith and love works together
[51:11] he went under saying when we Sinners
[51:13] alienated without God and in the world
[51:16] and the muck of the mud as I talked
[51:18] about this morning come to us God sought
[51:22] you you never saw God no man can come to
[51:25] me except the father draws them first
[51:26] and God came down in that mock that
[51:30] where you were and sought you out and he
[51:32] brought you out and he said this is what
[51:35] I want to get to he says that ought to
[51:38] create a perfect love
[51:41] you should feel in debt to what he's
[51:43] done for you
[51:46] look what you was and look what you are
[51:48] what did what did that somebody that
[51:53] loved you can't you have faith in what
[51:56] he promised you then
[51:57] real genuine love will create confidence
[52:01] in his word
[52:04] he caught me when I was nothing I'm
[52:07] still nothing but I'm in his hands see
[52:09] he caught me and he loved me when I was
[52:12] unlovable he loved you when you were
[52:14] unlovable but he changed you just like
[52:17] the colored sister said that time in her
[52:20] testimony he said I'm not what I ought
[52:22] to be I'm not what I want to be but I'm
[52:24] not what I used to be
[52:26] she knew she had come somewhere
[52:29] something happened and that's what it is
[52:31] if God when I was alienated from he so
[52:34] loved me too he stooped down to get me
[52:36] and pick me up that gives me confidence
[52:38] that he wants to use me he's got a
[52:42] purpose in doing so he has something in
[52:45] uh he's seen something in me and he's
[52:47] seen something in you and he had a
[52:49] reason to save you look at the people
[52:51] that's unsaved today look at the
[52:53] millions he could have took you he could
[52:56] have put beside you but he took you
[53:00] one out of a million no man can take
[53:04] your place amen you're in God's economy
[53:06] no one can do it he he that's his love
[53:11] to you
[53:12] now that won't that won't Your Love he
[53:16] says then won't Your Love reach back to
[53:19] him
[53:21] and there is a love affair no matter
[53:24] what the situation is circumstances it's
[53:26] governed by this love that creates faith
[53:32] that God loves you and you love God you
[53:37] love one another and that brings the
[53:40] faith all right then it can't keep you
[53:43] from uh bringing out just exactly what
[53:45] God promised it would do Caesar watch
[53:47] Pure faith I'm sorry perfect faith is
[53:51] pure just as
[53:53] uh pure as love is
[53:58] so I say brother Brandon knew what he
[54:02] was saying when he said the most
[54:03] important thing to God's heart was
[54:05] perfect love
[54:07] and he told us to go after it
[54:10] so don't go after the other things go
[54:12] after perfect love we just can't bypass
[54:15] it it's what we need to be raptured
[54:19] don't try to get raptured
[54:22] without perfect love it won't happen
[54:25] don't just go after the faith or go
[54:27] after the quotes or or this that or the
[54:30] other pursue a relationship with God
[54:33] that is perfectly in love with him
[54:36] now perfect love is attainable
[54:39] we have Jesus telling us in Matthew 5 to
[54:41] be perfect towards all them uh that that
[54:45] oppose you just like uh his heavenly
[54:47] father does we have John telling us in
[54:50] our opening scripture that as Jesus is
[54:52] so are we in this world
[54:55] and and that's what will give us
[54:58] boldness on the day of judgment we also
[55:01] have the prophet in this last age
[55:02] telling us to get to the spot to where
[55:04] we can love everyone
[55:06] and he wouldn't be telling us to do
[55:08] something if we couldn't do it
[55:10] so we must believe that perfect love is
[55:13] attainable in our personal lives
[55:19] brother Branham told us even the
[55:21] importance that we need to lay
[55:22] everything else aside until we get it
[55:24] now we've read these quotes before we've
[55:27] gone through these and you know these
[55:28] but I think it's something that we don't
[55:30] take real serious we haven't taken real
[55:32] serious
[55:35] brother Brown said in the message the
[55:36] adoption he says thus saith the Lord
[55:38] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[55:41] that place
[55:42] it will take perfect love to put you in
[55:45] that place now here's the thing the
[55:47] devil has got so many people thinking
[55:50] somehow when I die
[55:52] I just have perfect love
[55:57] I mean that's the way I used to think
[55:58] when I was in the denominations
[56:01] that is the way I used to think before I
[56:04] came to the truth
[56:06] but get rid of that thought because if
[56:09] you hold on to that thought you won't
[56:10] press towards anything
[56:13] why do I need to press towards it if
[56:15] it's already going to happen when I die
[56:18] it just don't line up with the
[56:20] scriptures that don't dovetail
[56:24] for that's all there was there he says
[56:26] no matter what money how religious
[56:28] demonstrations how many Good Deeds
[56:30] you've done or whatever you've done that
[56:32] won't count for nothing on that day
[56:35] he says it'll take perfect love so now
[56:37] he's mentioning all the things
[56:40] that we do on this planet before we go
[56:43] and he says that won't mean nothing
[56:46] on that day to get there but you need
[56:49] perfect love
[56:50] all these things are pointing towards us
[56:53] to getting perfect love on this side
[56:58] so whatever you do lay aside everything
[57:01] else
[57:02] until you are just so filled with the
[57:05] love of God to you can love those who
[57:08] hate you
[57:12] you know our Pursuit you know we spend
[57:14] time trying to get away from certain
[57:16] people that make us feel uncomfortable
[57:19] parents
[57:21] when the prophet's telling us get to a
[57:23] place where we can love them
[57:28] it's just like are we going to listen to
[57:32] our spirit are we going to listen to
[57:33] God's spirit
[57:35] man you will come to me in that day this
[57:38] is me this ain't the quote
[57:40] Jesus said many will come to me in that
[57:42] day and say Lord Lord didn't we do this
[57:45] that and the other but what was really
[57:46] missing
[57:48] it was a love relationship
[57:51] because iniquity was there iniquity was
[57:54] not doing the things I asked you to do
[57:56] that's what was really missing they
[57:59] didn't think they needed to do
[58:01] everything that Jesus had asked
[58:04] so he's really looking in that love
[58:06] affair for someone that just will love
[58:08] him completely
[58:16] God is not having relationships with
[58:18] those that use that want to use them
[58:22] he's having relationships with those who
[58:25] love him enough to follow the word I've
[58:28] had a quite a few people in my life
[58:31] use me
[58:34] and I can tell you right now
[58:37] that I can't say
[58:39] that they were I had close relationships
[58:41] with them the very fact that you're
[58:44] being used really shows what kind of
[58:47] relationship that is right
[58:50] you would never ever use somebody you
[58:53] loved
[58:54] right
[58:56] right but see many people want something
[58:59] from God
[59:01] look at the Rich Young Ruler
[59:07] before he went over acroston he wanted
[59:10] eternal life
[59:12] after he he died and was there and he
[59:16] couldn't cross over he still had a
[59:19] desire to see his own family saved
[59:24] nobody wants to go to hell right
[59:27] nobody
[59:31] but that doesn't mean everybody wants to
[59:34] love God
[59:37] see the difference it's not about I
[59:39] don't want to go to hell and it's not
[59:41] about I want to go to heaven what it's
[59:42] about is I loving God completely to
[59:46] pursue a perfect love because that's
[59:48] what it takes to get there
[59:50] I want to finish this quote now he says
[59:52] just as I in adoption for just as I was
[59:55] said this morning my whole makeup is
[59:58] Grace a lot of people say no you scratch
[1:00:01] my back and I'll scratch yours yeah you
[1:00:04] do something for me and I'll do
[1:00:06] something for you brother Brandon said
[1:00:07] that's not Grace
[1:00:10] Grace as if if your back is itching I'll
[1:00:14] scratch it anyhow whether you scratch
[1:00:16] mine or not uh you can slap me on the
[1:00:20] face and say my back is itching it needs
[1:00:23] scratching and I'll scratch it
[1:00:27] right he said that's it do something I
[1:00:30] don't believe in works
[1:00:32] I believe that works is love
[1:00:38] works is the manifestation that Grace
[1:00:41] has taken place
[1:00:43] when brother Brian said do something
[1:00:46] he's meaning do something for somebody
[1:00:47] unconditionally
[1:00:51] don't worry about what you're going to
[1:00:52] get out of it
[1:00:53] if you're always worried about what
[1:00:55] you're getting out of it you're so far
[1:00:56] from perfect love it's you got that
[1:00:59] selfish love you're dealing with
[1:01:04] love those who use you
[1:01:09] love those who don't want to help you
[1:01:13] I won't say can't help you
[1:01:15] but don't want to help you
[1:01:18] true love is not using someone to get
[1:01:20] what you want
[1:01:22] it's not even sharing the
[1:01:23] responsibilities to get what you want in
[1:01:25] other words you scratch my back I'll
[1:01:26] scratch mine you scratch mine
[1:01:29] it's not a win-win situation
[1:01:32] true love is living for others that's it
[1:01:35] living for others you don't get nothing
[1:01:37] out of it
[1:01:43] now how many people really exercise this
[1:01:46] how many people are actually in pursuit
[1:01:48] of it how many people even spend time
[1:01:52] this is important to me
[1:01:55] I mean when we're all alone I don't mean
[1:01:57] when we're being reminded about it from
[1:01:59] buying the pulpit but but when we're at
[1:02:02] home and we're we're doing the things
[1:02:03] we're doing we're we're living the life
[1:02:05] we're going to work we're doing the
[1:02:06] thing how many people are actually
[1:02:08] trying to exercise this
[1:02:11] but the Brandon said in the message
[1:02:12] beyond the curtain of time he says
[1:02:14] whatever you do lay aside everything
[1:02:16] else until you get perfect love
[1:02:18] get to where you can love everybody even
[1:02:21] your enemy he says no he says the
[1:02:23] statement here says now no matter if the
[1:02:26] plane is rocking the lightning is
[1:02:28] flashing The Guns of the enemy are upon
[1:02:30] you these things do not matter
[1:02:36] does it really matter the bombs are
[1:02:38] going to fall the economy is going to
[1:02:40] fall
[1:02:41] people are going to be after you
[1:02:43] even The Guns of the enemy are upon you
[1:02:47] he said this doesn't matter
[1:02:50] in other words you have no excuse
[1:02:54] this is not an excuse God won't accept
[1:02:56] our excuses
[1:02:58] go get perfect love
[1:03:00] pursue perfect love put it in your heart
[1:03:04] that this is important
[1:03:06] because we
[1:03:07] naturally through the process of the
[1:03:10] devil's Ministry to us constantly
[1:03:13] it's not a very important topic
[1:03:16] to pursue
[1:03:18] right and of course the first thing he
[1:03:20] wants to do is try to get every think
[1:03:22] that they just they they just have it if
[1:03:24] they don't they're going to get it
[1:03:26] and both of those you don't have to
[1:03:28] pursue so I could just start pursuing
[1:03:30] other things
[1:03:32] and and that's that's how we get caught
[1:03:34] up in laodicea
[1:03:40] I say too many too many believers who
[1:03:44] know the truth have too many excuses for
[1:03:48] why they're not pursuing it
[1:03:52] now brother Brahm is showing us what
[1:03:54] Paul really meant about pressing towards
[1:03:56] the mark and the rest of this quote he
[1:03:57] says if you're not saved except Jesus
[1:04:00] Christ as your savior now
[1:04:02] he says if you've not been baptized in
[1:04:04] water be baptized now
[1:04:06] if you have not received the baptism of
[1:04:09] the Holy Spirit receive it now and then
[1:04:11] he says Press On
[1:04:13] to that perfect love
[1:04:17] which will take you to that beautiful
[1:04:21] and joyful place beyond the curtain of
[1:04:25] time
[1:04:26] so what's going to take it take you
[1:04:28] there
[1:04:29] perfect love
[1:04:31] how do I know I got it brother John
[1:04:34] would you just love everybody
[1:04:35] unconditionally
[1:04:38] well I just I don't know inside you know
[1:04:42] pursue it
[1:04:43] pursue it then don't just accept that
[1:04:47] this is just the way it is and just the
[1:04:49] way it's always been pursue it
[1:04:52] pursue more than what you got you you
[1:04:54] you you've been you repented that's
[1:04:57] great you yeah you've been baptized
[1:04:59] that's great you you got Sanctified
[1:05:01] that's great you got the baptism of the
[1:05:03] Holy Ghost that's that's great now
[1:05:05] pursue it
[1:05:07] get to the place of completion
[1:05:14] let it be important to you why why does
[1:05:17] it need to be important to you just
[1:05:18] remember this
[1:05:20] God
[1:05:21] is choosing
[1:05:23] his bride
[1:05:28] if I could say it like this you're not
[1:05:30] in on the vote who he's choosing
[1:05:35] only thing you can do is present
[1:05:37] yourself to him in a way that he would
[1:05:40] choose you that's all you can do
[1:05:44] so I'll say if it's important to God to
[1:05:47] have perfect love
[1:05:49] and let it be important to you
[1:05:52] because you know you can just preach
[1:05:54] predestination and believe pray
[1:05:56] destination to your just blue in the
[1:05:59] face and never have perfect love
[1:06:02] what good will that do to believe in the
[1:06:04] right Doctrine but not teach
[1:06:07] if you're predestined you will have
[1:06:09] perfect love right
[1:06:16] what takes us to that joyful Place
[1:06:18] perfect love
[1:06:20] the spirit of laodicea has caused too
[1:06:23] many
[1:06:24] too many Believers to take their foot
[1:06:26] off the gas
[1:06:28] just kind of coal steam I'm in the
[1:06:30] message
[1:06:32] I'm the bride I'm predestinated just
[1:06:35] coasting
[1:06:37] no pursuing no pressing towards the mark
[1:06:41] I've already attained
[1:06:45] you don't need to see very many
[1:06:46] believers
[1:06:48] to to realize that there's hardly any
[1:06:51] talk about
[1:06:53] getting perfect love
[1:06:55] it's not in conversations
[1:06:58] there's no there's no provoking there's
[1:07:01] no I need to get more serious about it
[1:07:04] God's been dealing with me about perfect
[1:07:07] love it isn't part of the conversation
[1:07:09] is something that's is distant and here
[1:07:13] uh the wave Chief in our age went beyond
[1:07:16] the curtain of time and all his great
[1:07:19] experience his conclusion was whatever
[1:07:21] you do go get it
[1:07:25] and why it ain't a part of our lives our
[1:07:27] conversations our homes our families
[1:07:32] we we rather spend time acting like we
[1:07:34] got it
[1:07:35] then making excuses of why it didn't
[1:07:37] work
[1:07:40] it's very low interest it's sad we don't
[1:07:43] got time but you could write it down
[1:07:45] Philippians 3 15 through 20.
[1:07:48] it's our own interest and our own
[1:07:50] desires that's taken us away from that
[1:07:53] the religious group of this age they
[1:07:55] feel very strongly that they don't need
[1:07:58] anything else than what they got
[1:08:03] that's why it's so hard to to keep
[1:08:05] staring at well this is what I've
[1:08:07] achieved this is where I am I'm a real
[1:08:09] good person I do this I've done this and
[1:08:11] it's always about what we've attained
[1:08:16] Revelation 3 14 unto the angel of the
[1:08:19] church allowed to see is right these
[1:08:20] things saith the amen the faithful the
[1:08:22] true witness the beginning of the
[1:08:24] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[1:08:25] thou art neither cold or hot
[1:08:30] I would you were one or the other
[1:08:32] that's right just two sides
[1:08:37] be like me I'm choosing a bride
[1:08:40] I know what I'm going after
[1:08:42] he says you two sides didn't brother
[1:08:45] Brandon say
[1:08:47] if you're if you're if you're if you
[1:08:49] don't want God you must just go live the
[1:08:51] life
[1:08:52] for yourself as good as you can because
[1:08:54] this is the only life you got
[1:09:02] right so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[1:09:06] you're neither not all in or all out
[1:09:09] I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:09:14] because your heart is speaking
[1:09:21] I'm rich now that don't necessarily have
[1:09:24] to be money
[1:09:28] I'm just I'm rich and
[1:09:31] knowledge and God and and this message
[1:09:34] and I'm rich and everything that I got
[1:09:41] and increased with Goods well we have
[1:09:44] more Goods in this this time of our life
[1:09:47] for the most part than in any other age
[1:09:50] and any other time
[1:09:54] and have need of you not telling me what
[1:09:58] to do
[1:10:03] I don't need that I got yeah you got it
[1:10:08] that's why you're not pressing
[1:10:10] right here it's a spirit of this age
[1:10:14] and not even here's there's people that
[1:10:17] are in the message
[1:10:19] they think they're where they need to be
[1:10:21] and don't even realize it that they're
[1:10:23] caught up in laodicea
[1:10:25] oh no I believe with that Minister says
[1:10:27] you know we're Beyond laodice here we're
[1:10:29] in the eagle age well the bride might be
[1:10:33] The Pride might be
[1:10:35] but that doesn't mean everybody who's
[1:10:37] claiming to be in the message is there
[1:10:45] I just believe that there's something
[1:10:48] that the bride has
[1:10:52] in connection that Paul had and it's
[1:10:54] that attitude of I don't have what
[1:10:57] everything that I need I am going to
[1:11:00] press and press and press towards it
[1:11:03] I think it's important to understand
[1:11:05] what the goal is the goal is not to be
[1:11:08] saved
[1:11:11] the goal is to be chosen
[1:11:14] to be his bride
[1:11:17] and and to sit here and just have the
[1:11:20] thoughts that well I am Chosen and I
[1:11:23] believe it well that's good but now hold
[1:11:25] yourself accountable
[1:11:27] are you at that place that the prophet
[1:11:30] told you to get to
[1:11:31] are you at that place the prophet told
[1:11:34] you to get to
[1:11:36] or do you kind of stay away from people
[1:11:39] that bother you because you don't want
[1:11:41] to have to deal with it
[1:11:44] come on now
[1:11:46] this this this is Eagle food
[1:11:50] this is this is not for for people who
[1:11:53] are not serious about being chosen to go
[1:11:56] on a rapture
[1:12:03] he says and know us not you're wretched
[1:12:06] you're miserable you're poor you're
[1:12:07] blind you're naked in other words the
[1:12:09] way that you're viewing your own self
[1:12:12] you can't see it
[1:12:14] you can't see straight so he says I
[1:12:16] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:12:20] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:12:22] white Remnant that that may as be
[1:12:25] clothed with in the shame of thy
[1:12:26] nakedness do not appear and an anoint
[1:12:29] thine eyes with with I said that thou
[1:12:31] mayest see Jesus is telling them to buy
[1:12:35] of himself to buy deity to buy to buy
[1:12:40] without money to buy without price
[1:12:43] to buy it with a love affair to give
[1:12:46] yourself that God gives himself to you
[1:12:50] to seek the Holy Spirit to seek his life
[1:12:53] to seek perfect love
[1:12:55] that's what he is counseling and he and
[1:12:58] he's saying you got to repent
[1:13:01] because uh
[1:13:04] an attitude of I I'm I'm of attained to
[1:13:08] where I need to be and I don't need
[1:13:09] really to press anything more that's the
[1:13:11] thing you got to repent of
[1:13:14] because that's that's the devil that's
[1:13:17] the same Spirit the devil had when he
[1:13:19] left heaven
[1:13:22] I don't need God anymore I can be my own
[1:13:28] and he got a whole bunch of people on
[1:13:30] the bandwagon in fact every one of us
[1:13:31] were born with that nature at one time
[1:13:39] remember the wise virgins
[1:13:42] said to the foolish virgins he said
[1:13:46] don't ask me to give you
[1:13:51] God
[1:13:52] oil the Holy Ghost
[1:13:55] because if I give any to you I won't
[1:13:58] have enough to make it
[1:14:01] but what was his advice the same as God
[1:14:03] go go to him that selleth
[1:14:08] and he'll give it to you
[1:14:10] pursue it from them but remember their
[1:14:13] attitude was I had enough
[1:14:15] because they all had oil to start with
[1:14:18] but their lamps went out
[1:14:21] and they didn't they didn't pursue more
[1:14:24] they didn't go on to get filled up
[1:14:30] There's an actual place of perfect love
[1:14:33] it's not a geographic place it's a
[1:14:36] holographic place
[1:14:37] and I'm allowed to make up my own words
[1:14:41] this is America
[1:14:45] this place is in Christ the word
[1:14:49] the Bible says who so keepeth his word
[1:14:51] in him verily is the love of God
[1:14:53] perfected so this place we want to get
[1:14:56] to is to keep the word that word
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:01] is to love where we're not loving
[1:15:05] it's not to focus on the word we are
[1:15:08] keeping it's not to focus on the love
[1:15:11] that we are loving
[1:15:13] as long as we do that we won't press
[1:15:18] the place in Christ is a love
[1:15:20] relationship with God's word
[1:15:23] it's not our feelings and our emotions
[1:15:25] about God it's what God's word says fall
[1:15:30] in love with the word because our
[1:15:32] feelings all of our feelings say I love
[1:15:34] you God
[1:15:35] right we can agree with that
[1:15:38] I love you God my feelings my emotions
[1:15:40] say God you've done so much for me
[1:15:44] but if you love me
[1:15:46] keep my word
[1:15:48] keep my Commandments that's the focus
[1:15:51] so we need to abide in the word stay
[1:15:54] connected to the vine be fruitful in
[1:15:57] What In Your Love relationship
[1:16:00] be fruitful in the love relationship
[1:16:02] with God
[1:16:04] Psalms 91 verse 1 just talked about that
[1:16:07] place before we pursue it
[1:16:09] laying along Foundation you know how I
[1:16:11] am Psalms 91 verse 1 says he that
[1:16:14] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[1:16:16] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:16:20] almighty so there's telling us that
[1:16:21] there is a place
[1:16:23] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[1:16:25] and my Fortress and my God in him will I
[1:16:30] trust
[1:16:31] surely he will deliver me
[1:16:35] drop down to 14.
[1:16:38] because he have set his love upon me
[1:16:43] therefore will I deliver him
[1:16:48] what part do we play
[1:16:50] setting our affections on things that
[1:16:52] are above
[1:16:54] setting our affection on God
[1:16:57] we want Deliverance set your affections
[1:17:00] on God Amen
[1:17:04] amen verse 9 because thou has made the
[1:17:08] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[1:17:10] high
[1:17:11] thy habitation
[1:17:13] this place the word
[1:17:16] there shall no evil befall thee no
[1:17:21] wonder he gives great peace to those
[1:17:23] whose mind is stayed on the Lord
[1:17:28] right God ain't gonna let him God is
[1:17:30] peace
[1:17:31] God don't get shook up right he's not
[1:17:34] All Shook Up
[1:17:36] he's he's a God of Peace he is peace he
[1:17:40] is our peace
[1:17:43] so when we're dwelling in that place of
[1:17:46] perfect love
[1:17:47] there's nothing to fear no matter what
[1:17:50] happens to us
[1:17:54] pursuing perfect love the first step to
[1:17:56] pursuing perfect love brother Branham
[1:17:58] told us is laying aside all the other
[1:18:01] things that's important to us
[1:18:04] that's the number one thing we have to
[1:18:06] do if you want to pursue perfect love
[1:18:11] this step may seem the hardest
[1:18:13] But as God spoke to brother random
[1:18:16] it is the correct and precise choice
[1:18:20] it requires us to forsake our time
[1:18:24] time that we think is more important on
[1:18:28] other things and that's why we're there
[1:18:32] so your time
[1:18:35] is what you need to free up
[1:18:38] in order to pursue perfect love
[1:18:43] that's why you got to lay it aside lay
[1:18:44] everything aside
[1:18:46] start analyzing
[1:18:49] it requires us to forsake all that's
[1:18:53] hindering us
[1:18:55] from getting to that actual place what's
[1:18:58] hindering you
[1:18:59] it requires us to forsake whatever we
[1:19:02] love
[1:19:03] whoever we love
[1:19:05] including ourselves
[1:19:07] right that includes ourselves
[1:19:09] we must Jesus said we must forsake all
[1:19:11] whosoever loveth father mother more than
[1:19:13] me is not worthy of me
[1:19:15] we must deny ourselves we must deny our
[1:19:18] will for the things that we're pursuing
[1:19:24] it's our will that's making us pursue
[1:19:26] the things that we're pursuing now
[1:19:29] don't you know it's the devil's job to
[1:19:31] get your life so confused so wound up so
[1:19:35] busy that the only thing you got time to
[1:19:37] do is rescue yourself
[1:19:46] imagine there was no cell phones
[1:19:49] how many times you walk into a room and
[1:19:51] you see someone your loved one on the
[1:19:53] cell phone and you say what would you do
[1:19:55] if there was no cell phones
[1:19:59] we go out to eat
[1:20:00] four of us at the table
[1:20:02] we all got our cell phone down
[1:20:08] Satan has done a good job getting our
[1:20:11] mind distracted on other things I'll say
[1:20:13] what we need to do is Lay start laying
[1:20:16] stuff aside I am telling you if you do
[1:20:18] not lay aside everything you will never
[1:20:22] ever ever get perfect love
[1:20:32] to get all of him
[1:20:35] he's choosing someone who wants him more
[1:20:38] than anything else oh brother John I
[1:20:43] want God
[1:20:44] so do you
[1:20:46] and six other billion people
[1:20:50] but do you want him more than anything
[1:20:53] else in your life
[1:21:00] Hebrews 12 verse 1 says wherefore seeing
[1:21:03] we also are compassionate about what's
[1:21:06] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[1:21:10] aside every weight
[1:21:14] now that word weight means hindrance
[1:21:18] lay aside every hindrance
[1:21:21] you know the greatest thing is the devil
[1:21:23] he doesn't want to he doesn't want you
[1:21:24] to see what's hindering you
[1:21:28] in other words the things that are
[1:21:30] hindering you
[1:21:34] that you have chosen to do in your life
[1:21:38] the devil's told you you need to do
[1:21:40] those
[1:21:43] but I tell you I don't think the god of
[1:21:46] Heaven would ever want me to do
[1:21:49] something that I would put before him
[1:21:53] now he may have given it to you but that
[1:21:56] doesn't mean
[1:21:58] you've got the character to put it in
[1:22:00] his place
[1:22:01] you know what I'm saying there
[1:22:04] just because he gave it to you
[1:22:06] just because he blessed you with it
[1:22:09] it doesn't mean it goes before God
[1:22:13] put it in its place
[1:22:15] put God first and put the other thing
[1:22:18] behind
[1:22:21] so lay us out every weight every hinder
[1:22:23] is in the Sin which does so easily beset
[1:22:25] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:22:29] that set before us amen we're in a race
[1:22:32] we need to be pursuing right
[1:22:36] the first step of perfect love is laying
[1:22:38] aside everything
[1:22:40] that's important to you
[1:22:45] brother random said
[1:22:49] don't make excuses no matter if the
[1:22:51] planes are rocking the lightning is
[1:22:53] flashing The Guns of the enemy are upon
[1:22:55] you
[1:22:56] don't let any excuse stop you from
[1:23:00] laying everything aside
[1:23:02] you know the thing I hear when I try to
[1:23:05] help people get closer to God
[1:23:07] I hear excuses
[1:23:14] and and sometimes if you press
[1:23:17] oh what comes out is not perfect love
[1:23:22] come on
[1:23:23] you know when you're trying to help your
[1:23:25] children
[1:23:26] you try to get your children in line
[1:23:29] and you start
[1:23:31] just look this is really important and
[1:23:33] they lash out at you
[1:23:35] come on are you with me now don't get
[1:23:37] too quiet we're having Church
[1:23:40] it's a reality yes and the Holy Spirit
[1:23:45] is here and he wants us to pursue
[1:23:49] perfect love
[1:23:51] not occasionally not when you can fill
[1:23:54] it in
[1:23:56] I know what it means to juggle things
[1:24:00] this is not juggled in
[1:24:03] this means put down all the balls and
[1:24:06] start seeking perfect love just the one
[1:24:09] get to the place where you've been tried
[1:24:12] and you know you can love everybody
[1:24:15] come on not after uh 16 days or 16 hours
[1:24:20] of thinking about it and staying away
[1:24:23] from them
[1:24:24] that you think you can do it now
[1:24:27] no but when you're in the heat of the
[1:24:30] battle you know you can't be moved
[1:24:32] no matter what they do to you you can't
[1:24:34] be moved you love them because you're
[1:24:37] dwelling in that place
[1:24:42] I may not be able to preacher right but
[1:24:44] I know the preacher's here
[1:24:50] now after you've committed to laying
[1:24:52] everything else aside
[1:24:54] simply exercise
[1:24:57] your love for God
[1:25:00] just exercise it
[1:25:02] if you're serious about getting perfect
[1:25:04] love
[1:25:06] you get there by simply loving God more
[1:25:09] and more and more we want to keep it
[1:25:13] simple God is hid in simplicity
[1:25:16] you you know when you've had a a problem
[1:25:19] with your mate or a a family member
[1:25:22] sister brother a child
[1:25:24] um
[1:25:25] you know what keeps people separated
[1:25:27] stubbornness Pride
[1:25:31] and you got to lay that thing aside and
[1:25:33] you got to be the bigger person to reach
[1:25:35] out and love them
[1:25:37] so I'll just say it like this just love
[1:25:40] love God
[1:25:41] love God
[1:25:42] find ways to love God
[1:25:45] it isn't just church attendance
[1:25:49] if we're pursuing the complete love of
[1:25:52] God it's going to require now listen to
[1:25:54] this it's going to require us learning
[1:25:56] how to love God more
[1:26:02] doing something that we're not doing now
[1:26:05] you just can't you can't lay everything
[1:26:08] else aside and sit there and go like
[1:26:10] this like a monk
[1:26:14] the laying the stuff aside is opening
[1:26:17] your time up
[1:26:18] but after your time has been opened up
[1:26:20] now you can start to pursue getting more
[1:26:24] of God
[1:26:28] we may think
[1:26:30] he's first in our lives because the
[1:26:33] devil is always telling us a lie
[1:26:36] right
[1:26:37] but ours are deceptive and we really
[1:26:40] need to ask God God
[1:26:42] are you first in my heart search me
[1:26:47] I remember when I got baptized
[1:26:52] I thought
[1:26:53] God was first in my life
[1:26:57] no I got baptized and I did the first
[1:27:00] step but there were many things the Holy
[1:27:04] Spirit wanted to say to me but you know
[1:27:06] what I couldn't bear it now
[1:27:08] and then I learned there was more things
[1:27:10] then I had to give up my records and I
[1:27:13] had to give up worldly and I I mean I
[1:27:16] when I got baptized my hair was long
[1:27:21] then I had to cut my hair
[1:27:23] and I
[1:27:25] I thought you were first God
[1:27:29] no there's more things in our lives and
[1:27:32] the more we could just get real with God
[1:27:34] that love affair God surely there must
[1:27:37] be more because if if there was no more
[1:27:41] I would be able to just love anybody my
[1:27:43] my feathers wouldn't get all ruffled
[1:27:44] when something happened to me
[1:27:47] just it's just being an honest
[1:27:49] relationship
[1:27:52] Jeremiah 29 13 says and ye shall seek me
[1:27:56] and find me when you search for me with
[1:27:58] all your heart and I will be found if
[1:28:02] you saith the Lord
[1:28:05] God wants
[1:28:07] to show himself to us
[1:28:10] putting God first may seem to be hard
[1:28:12] and difficult
[1:28:14] but just keep it simple
[1:28:17] remember love perfect love requires
[1:28:21] perfect obedience
[1:28:24] so the more you want to love God
[1:28:28] the more you have to obey them
[1:28:31] so perfect love requires us to pick up
[1:28:34] our cross
[1:28:37] and follow him
[1:28:39] you're pursuing perfect love now you're
[1:28:42] pursuant of God I want I want perfect
[1:28:43] love I want to get to that place where I
[1:28:45] can love it pick up your cross
[1:28:48] it requires it it's not a separate topic
[1:28:52] we can make it a separate topic we can
[1:28:54] preach on it separate but it's part of
[1:28:57] getting it
[1:29:00] we've got to pick up God's complete will
[1:29:03] and his complete will is picking up our
[1:29:07] cross doing all the things that we
[1:29:09] thought at one time were just optional
[1:29:13] I didn't know it was that important
[1:29:15] optional
[1:29:17] no
[1:29:18] perfect love it's not optional
[1:29:21] man shall live by every word of God
[1:29:24] Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you
[1:29:26] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:29:28] that you present yourself that's right
[1:29:31] amen a Living Sacrifice
[1:29:35] now if you presented yourself a dead
[1:29:37] sacrifice
[1:29:39] after you died
[1:29:41] you couldn't do anything right
[1:29:44] but a Living Sacrifice
[1:29:47] you're dead to yourself
[1:29:49] and now you're alive doing everything
[1:29:51] God wants you to do
[1:29:53] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:29:56] reasonable it's the least thing you
[1:29:58] could do for God
[1:29:59] brother Brandon said the power of
[1:30:01] transformation he says you know what
[1:30:03] conform is be not conformed to this
[1:30:05] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:30:07] of your night mind renewing of your mind
[1:30:09] the things that you once thought upon to
[1:30:13] be precious lay that aside
[1:30:18] and be transformed to something else
[1:30:22] what you was one time to what you are
[1:30:26] now yes
[1:30:28] so we're in that process of
[1:30:30] transformation
[1:30:32] we haven't attained
[1:30:34] now we've transformed in certain things
[1:30:36] but not all things
[1:30:38] and the goal is to to pursue it to run
[1:30:41] after it to hunger to thirst to to make
[1:30:44] it a point to make it part of your
[1:30:46] conversation part of your prayer part of
[1:30:49] what you what you're working on through
[1:30:50] the course of the day and not just
[1:30:52] something where we we learn about at a
[1:30:54] church from time to time
[1:30:57] we hear Brother Brian talk about it in a
[1:30:59] message from time to time but because of
[1:31:01] my selective hearing when I listen to
[1:31:03] the tapes I'm only hearing what I want
[1:31:05] to hear
[1:31:08] Lord help us
[1:31:12] so now that we have extra time because
[1:31:14] we've laid everything else aside spend
[1:31:17] time actually pursuing complete love not
[1:31:21] just seeking God for this that and the
[1:31:25] other
[1:31:26] we're good at that we don't even have to
[1:31:28] be taught that
[1:31:29] I want God to do this and this and I
[1:31:32] need God for this and this
[1:31:38] how about spend some time
[1:31:41] seeking God for what he wants you to
[1:31:44] have
[1:31:46] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:31:50] well I'll tell you when we get there but
[1:31:52] brother Brandon when he went and saw the
[1:31:53] kingdom of God he said there was nothing
[1:31:55] there but perfect love
[1:31:58] that's what he witnessed with his eyes
[1:32:01] the kingdom of God
[1:32:04] so if we seek perfect love
[1:32:08] well the only way I can get is perfectly
[1:32:10] obey that word
[1:32:12] to love the word I'm not I'm not making
[1:32:15] loving God different than obeying the
[1:32:17] word they're one in the same
[1:32:20] but the thing is you know we say we love
[1:32:22] God and don't obey the word
[1:32:25] which is we don't love one don't love
[1:32:28] our enemy how's that
[1:32:30] we kind of pick and choose who our
[1:32:32] favorites are
[1:32:38] look we all need it we all need there
[1:32:41] ain't one person in here that don't need
[1:32:43] more of the perfect love of God not one
[1:32:48] but you know I believe that God is going
[1:32:51] to choose those who lay everything else
[1:32:53] aside and go get perfect love I don't
[1:32:56] believe brother Brandon went beyond the
[1:32:57] current time came back with the fruit
[1:33:01] of the promised land told us something
[1:33:05] and then it not be important for us to
[1:33:08] make it
[1:33:10] right do you understand
[1:33:11] Joshua Caleb they came back
[1:33:14] with the report
[1:33:17] those that believed the report
[1:33:19] which the majority did not remember that
[1:33:23] the majority don't even talk about
[1:33:25] getting perfect love
[1:33:28] they just feel that somehow it's going
[1:33:30] to happen
[1:33:33] I'm just being honest with you how many
[1:33:36] preachers do you hear preaching that you
[1:33:38] need to get perfect love
[1:33:41] you just don't hear it it's it's not a
[1:33:43] main subject
[1:33:46] but it seemed to be important enough to
[1:33:49] brother random
[1:33:51] that he preached it throughout the his
[1:33:53] his message after went down the curtain
[1:33:55] of time
[1:33:58] I say it like this to the point I think
[1:34:00] you and I should be pursuing it
[1:34:03] I don't think it should be a topic that
[1:34:05] we just talk about once in a while
[1:34:08] I think it should be on the Forefront
[1:34:10] these other things that we're talking
[1:34:12] about let them
[1:34:13] be here and there
[1:34:16] but let's let our goal be let's go for
[1:34:18] perfect love let's let's get to the
[1:34:21] place let's hear some testimonies I got
[1:34:23] hit in the face and you know what I
[1:34:25] turned the cheek and loved him and there
[1:34:26] was no ill feeling inside of me no ill
[1:34:29] thoughts about him when I left their
[1:34:31] presence no God I wish you were
[1:34:36] just a heart
[1:34:38] Lord forgive them they know not what
[1:34:41] they're doing
[1:34:44] go after it
[1:34:46] Sue it
[1:34:48] I believe the bride will have it
[1:34:54] I'm not worried about any of us having
[1:34:56] the correct Doctrine
[1:34:59] you could know all the Mysteries you
[1:35:01] could have all Faith you could give your
[1:35:03] body to be burned but I'll tell you what
[1:35:05] give your life for Jesus Christ that's
[1:35:07] another story
[1:35:11] so it's not just given of yourself for
[1:35:13] what you think is right give yourself to
[1:35:17] God for God
[1:35:19] because we're created for his glory
[1:35:21] we're created for his honor are you with
[1:35:23] me
[1:35:25] all right press to pursue the goal of
[1:35:28] perfect love that's his character inside
[1:35:31] of you reach out for more sincerity
[1:35:34] reach out to become more serious about
[1:35:38] the things of God for the doing the
[1:35:41] complete will of God I'll say pray pray
[1:35:44] brother Ben says you can't pray too much
[1:35:46] we're talking about how to pursue
[1:35:48] perfect love
[1:35:50] read the word and fall more in love with
[1:35:53] the word
[1:35:54] don't use the word just for guidance of
[1:35:57] your life
[1:35:59] read the word for the heart of God
[1:36:03] this is God's heart this is God's love
[1:36:05] letter
[1:36:06] this is the this is how to get to that
[1:36:09] place on the other side
[1:36:13] so read it with Lord help me to fall in
[1:36:14] love with what I read
[1:36:17] when you read and pray and listen to the
[1:36:21] message of the hour be purposeful for
[1:36:24] this purpose
[1:36:25] pursuing perfect love
[1:36:27] let that be your motive not why I want
[1:36:30] to listen to a tape I need to listen to
[1:36:31] a tape no be purposeful I'm going after
[1:36:35] perfect love when I put this tape on I'm
[1:36:37] going to open the book because I want to
[1:36:39] have perfect love I want to manifest it
[1:36:42] get down on my knees God when I get up I
[1:36:45] want to be more like you be purposeful
[1:36:47] to be able to love like God loves amen
[1:36:51] it's the High Calling
[1:36:54] it's what he's calling us to
[1:36:59] seek perfect love
[1:37:03] now when you do this
[1:37:05] with your heart what you're doing is
[1:37:07] actually training
[1:37:09] you're going through training
[1:37:12] this is can can I have some time kind of
[1:37:14] a little bit longer service today
[1:37:19] when you're doing this
[1:37:21] you're now in training
[1:37:25] but everybody that goes through training
[1:37:29] has to take a final exam
[1:37:32] right you go to school you you read the
[1:37:34] books you study and then you take an
[1:37:36] exam and you know we take exams
[1:37:41] and sometimes they're pop quizzes
[1:37:43] somebody just comes up to you and just
[1:37:44] really
[1:37:46] nice you
[1:37:48] just says something that gets under your
[1:37:50] skin
[1:37:52] that they just kind of on the side
[1:37:55] make you feel
[1:37:58] like what's under their feet
[1:38:01] you know what I'm talking about
[1:38:03] and that's your test
[1:38:05] now is your test
[1:38:08] to see if
[1:38:12] all your been
[1:38:15] pursuing
[1:38:17] you're you know what that test is for is
[1:38:18] to see how much you did lay aside
[1:38:22] that's what the test is for is to see
[1:38:24] how much you laid aside
[1:38:26] to get what you need for that moment did
[1:38:29] you get deity
[1:38:31] did you get the goal that was tried in
[1:38:33] the fire because Jesus stood in that
[1:38:35] fire and he said father forgive him when
[1:38:37] he was on the cross
[1:38:40] so when it happens to you it's at that
[1:38:43] time that you got to know that you could
[1:38:45] turn the cheek
[1:38:49] but you can say good things to others
[1:38:56] you know and here's the thing
[1:38:58] you know in your your heart and mine
[1:39:02] whether you're thinking you had a
[1:39:05] negative thought towards that person
[1:39:07] you know it
[1:39:09] and brother Brian I'm saying just get to
[1:39:11] the place where you can love now a
[1:39:13] thought can come and if it bounces off
[1:39:15] your head that's that's okay because the
[1:39:17] devil's allowed to do that
[1:39:19] but if that thing comes and said well
[1:39:21] let's think about this
[1:39:24] you know you're a five second thinker
[1:39:25] you're in trouble
[1:39:27] you better learn to try the spirit a
[1:39:30] much quicker than that
[1:39:35] remember character is not a gift
[1:39:39] hello
[1:39:41] gifts and coins are without repentance
[1:39:44] God just threw them out there but you
[1:39:46] know what character is not that way he
[1:39:49] don't throw character out
[1:39:51] and he don't throw perfect love out
[1:39:56] you get that just how you get character
[1:39:59] it's in the middle of the trial so when
[1:40:00] you're in the middle of the trial this
[1:40:02] is the time that you can really manifest
[1:40:05] perfect love
[1:40:09] to be an expression of God In the Flesh
[1:40:13] again
[1:40:16] now
[1:40:20] you can't just go up to anybody you want
[1:40:23] to and go heal them
[1:40:26] it may not be God's will
[1:40:30] but did you know you can always have
[1:40:35] the love of God in your heart to display
[1:40:38] the character of Jesus Christ when you
[1:40:40] need it
[1:40:42] see most people think the love of God is
[1:40:46] just
[1:40:49] when you cannot face any trial and get
[1:40:52] along with somebody
[1:40:55] like I'm just friends with everybody I
[1:40:58] just love everybody but you know what
[1:41:00] just take that thing off the plate
[1:41:03] that don't have nothing to do with it
[1:41:05] the prophet taught us and Jesus himself
[1:41:09] taught us to be like his father which is
[1:41:12] in heaven
[1:41:13] get to that place get there get there
[1:41:16] that means I'm not there if I'm going to
[1:41:18] get there
[1:41:20] pursue it get to that place where I love
[1:41:24] the person that's using me
[1:41:27] in other words if it's not them using me
[1:41:30] it's just going to be somebody else
[1:41:32] and if they're not use me it's just
[1:41:34] going to be somebody somebody is going
[1:41:36] to use you
[1:41:38] you're going to get persecuted if you
[1:41:40] live Godly in Christ Jesus you will be
[1:41:43] tested you do have an exam coming amen
[1:41:46] but you got to pass it
[1:41:48] and if you're hungry you're thirsty if
[1:41:52] it means life to you
[1:41:55] and during your time
[1:41:59] that you're not taking the exam is when
[1:42:02] you'll really get serious with God
[1:42:06] because you can't stop the exam from
[1:42:08] coming
[1:42:09] it's coming
[1:42:11] and you know some of us take a lot of
[1:42:14] exams
[1:42:18] but you know God God's showing us
[1:42:23] we really need to get ready
[1:42:26] he's not choosing someone that's half
[1:42:29] ready
[1:42:31] he's coming for a bride without spot or
[1:42:34] without wrinkle now look I don't care
[1:42:36] what mistakes you've made I don't care
[1:42:39] how much you've Fallen
[1:42:42] because there's none righteous no not
[1:42:44] one but get to the place where you're
[1:42:46] not perfect and you don't make a mistake
[1:42:49] get to the place where you can love
[1:42:52] everyone now I'm telling I am just
[1:42:54] preaching the message
[1:42:56] that's all I'm doing I don't it's not a
[1:42:57] new message I'm just preaching the
[1:42:59] message
[1:43:01] get to that place pursue it
[1:43:07] perfect love not a gift
[1:43:09] it's a victory
[1:43:12] it's it's you paid the price you know
[1:43:15] the right way to act you know the right
[1:43:16] right way to respond you know the right
[1:43:18] way to think the love of God thinketh no
[1:43:20] ill to his neighbor
[1:43:22] get to the place where it don't exist
[1:43:25] well brother John you're asking for a
[1:43:27] lot I'm just quoting what the prophet
[1:43:30] said
[1:43:31] I'm just preaching the word what the
[1:43:33] word says it's it's no different it just
[1:43:37] happens to be important and not too many
[1:43:39] want to preach it
[1:43:40] right it's easier to preach other things
[1:43:43] it really is
[1:43:52] what did Jesus mean when he said
[1:43:55] when you
[1:43:56] when somebody Smite you on the face turn
[1:43:59] the cheek
[1:44:02] only perfect love does that
[1:44:05] only perfect love does that
[1:44:07] because if somebody hits me on the face
[1:44:10] the first thing I'm going to think is
[1:44:12] who Do You Think You Are
[1:44:15] right who are you to hit me
[1:44:19] yeah what right and then the next
[1:44:21] thought I'm going to have brother Larry
[1:44:23] is what what in the world did I do wrong
[1:44:26] to deserve that
[1:44:29] and that has nothing at all to do with
[1:44:31] anything
[1:44:33] it's not the action It's the reaction
[1:44:36] are you gonna are you gonna turn that
[1:44:38] cheek I know you're just gonna I mean
[1:44:40] you turn it you only turn it for one
[1:44:42] reason you don't oh God I hate getting
[1:44:44] hit
[1:44:45] no you you turn that cheek because you
[1:44:50] know it wasn't them
[1:44:52] who hurt you
[1:44:55] because if they knew you were the bride
[1:44:59] of Jesus Christ they would never ever
[1:45:01] hurt you
[1:45:03] never
[1:45:05] the only one that would do it would be
[1:45:07] the devil in his angels and his
[1:45:09] anointings and his spirits that get on
[1:45:12] people
[1:45:13] they are the ones
[1:45:15] that have no respect
[1:45:18] for God or his people
[1:45:22] that's why you can't you can't have the
[1:45:25] love of God and be disrespectful to
[1:45:27] somebody
[1:45:29] you just can't
[1:45:32] those of you that have a hard time with
[1:45:34] respect
[1:45:36] you need to pursue respect
[1:45:38] that might be a way to help you
[1:45:40] understand pursuing love
[1:45:43] perfect love you
[1:45:45] I had a Methodist brother
[1:45:48] I'll tell you 25 30 years ago tell me he
[1:45:51] said respect will take you a long way in
[1:45:53] life
[1:45:55] and I'll tell you perfect love will take
[1:45:57] you a long way in life
[1:45:58] you know you can be a good people person
[1:46:00] and not have the love of God
[1:46:08] instead of trying to
[1:46:10] be a friend to everybody go to the
[1:46:12] people that you got a problem with
[1:46:16] take more exams
[1:46:20] and help yourself realize that we should
[1:46:22] be in pursuit of the same thing Paul was
[1:46:27] the same thing
[1:46:29] the same thing that brother Brandon says
[1:46:31] that
[1:46:33] I'm not going to be able to get to all
[1:46:35] this so just so you know
[1:46:37] I love you anyways
[1:46:42] now brother Brian said this in Churchill
[1:46:43] now he said it in church order but
[1:46:44] listen what he said here he says if you
[1:46:46] can't disagree with a man
[1:46:48] and things
[1:46:50] and then shake his hands and still have
[1:46:54] what the same feeling
[1:46:56] now a lot of people
[1:46:58] fake it
[1:47:00] they hide the feelings
[1:47:02] and they fake it
[1:47:04] he says and still have the same feelings
[1:47:06] towards him then there's something wrong
[1:47:08] with you
[1:47:10] if you can't disagree with a man
[1:47:12] bitterly from one side to the other and
[1:47:15] still think as much of him as Christ
[1:47:18] would
[1:47:20] then there's something wrong with
[1:47:23] your spirit
[1:47:30] think about that
[1:47:33] so when we're right in the middle of a
[1:47:35] serious opposition
[1:47:37] we always have a choice to make
[1:47:41] usually when you got a problem with
[1:47:42] somebody you're
[1:47:43] you're choosing to fight or argue or
[1:47:46] defend ourselves or prove somebody else
[1:47:49] is wrong or ignore the person for a
[1:47:51] while because you're done with them or
[1:47:53] or or
[1:47:54] or hold your love for somebody else that
[1:47:57] you
[1:47:58] think's more worthy of now that's
[1:48:01] usually what happens when we're in the
[1:48:03] middle of our problems
[1:48:05] but don't pursue that carnal
[1:48:08] thinking anymore don't pursue that
[1:48:10] pursue perfect love
[1:48:13] this is your chance to have Christ
[1:48:15] manifested inside of you
[1:48:18] you're right there
[1:48:21] with your enemy but Christ is right
[1:48:23] there with you
[1:48:25] if he prepares a table before you in the
[1:48:27] presence of his enemies don't you think
[1:48:29] Christ in you
[1:48:33] can create such a faith and confidence
[1:48:36] that you don't have to fear
[1:48:39] the opposition
[1:48:42] this person
[1:48:43] you know this person has spoken ill of
[1:48:46] you and it might have been 10 years ago
[1:48:47] five years ago three years ago two years
[1:48:50] ago one week ago but you know something
[1:48:52] about this when the devil and that could
[1:48:54] have been made right but you know the
[1:48:56] thing is the devil don't let you forget
[1:48:59] it
[1:49:01] and that's what he uses as evidence
[1:49:05] when he comes to your mind
[1:49:10] but so when even there's no conflict
[1:49:14] with somebody but a thought comes to
[1:49:15] your head about somebody
[1:49:18] don't choose to be carnal
[1:49:22] choose to love them
[1:49:26] God I know you love them
[1:49:28] I pray you love them through me
[1:49:31] love them through Me Lord
[1:49:33] in fact until I see them
[1:49:36] I'm going to get down on my knees right
[1:49:38] now and pray for him
[1:49:42] maybe I'm going to text him maybe I'm
[1:49:43] going to call them
[1:49:45] because I just want to love them
[1:49:48] you know this thing of I got such a
[1:49:51] private relationship with God that
[1:49:53] doesn't have anything to do with the
[1:49:55] help in the body is really not what you
[1:49:57] think it is
[1:50:04] I think we need to we need to do some
[1:50:06] evaluation
[1:50:08] I I want to have boldness on the day of
[1:50:12] judgment
[1:50:13] as he is so are we now
[1:50:17] in this world
[1:50:19] I want to get to that place I want to
[1:50:21] lay everything aside so when you're in
[1:50:23] the middle of the trials
[1:50:26] choose
[1:50:27] the harder way
[1:50:30] choose the hard way right then
[1:50:32] afterwards it's hindsight's 2020.
[1:50:36] and it's one thing to say
[1:50:39] beforehand
[1:50:41] oh yeah yeah I'll have perfect love
[1:50:43] before the rapture
[1:50:45] but when you're in the middle of the
[1:50:46] trial choose the harder way
[1:50:51] God told brother Brandon he said this
[1:50:54] this decision this in itself is that
[1:50:57] which will bring to pass that tremendous
[1:51:00] victory in love divine
[1:51:06] that's how important your decision is
[1:51:10] so what we're just think about you know
[1:51:12] perfect love oh man it needs to be
[1:51:15] tested
[1:51:16] we want perfect love but we don't want
[1:51:18] the trials right it's like we want
[1:51:19] patience but we don't want the trial
[1:51:22] now we don't have time
[1:51:23] but I want you if you read James
[1:51:27] four this is a homework
[1:51:31] James 4 1-12 you will see how to
[1:51:37] manifest perfect love
[1:51:41] because the problem is starting inside
[1:51:42] right it's me that's keeping me from
[1:51:44] loving somebody perfect it isn't it
[1:51:47] isn't the person who's doing me harm
[1:51:51] but he goes on to talk about that he
[1:51:54] gives grace to the humble and just
[1:51:55] submit yourself to God and that's how
[1:51:58] you love perfect
[1:52:01] we need to be more concerned about
[1:52:03] getting perfect love
[1:52:05] because nothing else
[1:52:07] but perfect love will enter in there
[1:52:10] brother Brandon said in the message
[1:52:12] convinced and then concerned he says if
[1:52:14] we believe
[1:52:15] of the coming Messiahs at hand We
[1:52:17] Believe The Rapture is at hand he says I
[1:52:19] think we ought to lay everything else
[1:52:20] aside
[1:52:21] and be concerned about getting the
[1:52:23] message in the lands Yonder as fast as
[1:52:25] you can do it that's right I believe the
[1:52:27] Messiah is coming I would support a
[1:52:28] missionary program that would sweep
[1:52:30] around the country right quick and get a
[1:52:32] church ready for him I would do it
[1:52:34] therefore I am convinced that the
[1:52:37] Messiah is coming soon and I'm concerned
[1:52:39] about getting the gospel everywhere that
[1:52:40] I can
[1:52:42] that it can be gotten he said I am
[1:52:44] interested in a missionary program
[1:52:49] no
[1:52:51] if
[1:52:52] I was going to preach this message in an
[1:52:55] hour
[1:52:56] but you know I didn't because we're past
[1:52:58] an hour
[1:52:59] but if I was going to preach this
[1:53:01] message in an hour
[1:53:04] about 7 500 people would have died
[1:53:07] during the time of the message of course
[1:53:09] now it's more
[1:53:11] that's about 125 people a minute
[1:53:16] over 65 million people die every year in
[1:53:20] the world
[1:53:22] that's around one thousand no that's
[1:53:24] around 178
[1:53:26] 000 every day I wonder how many of those
[1:53:30] people are dying without Christ
[1:53:35] I just wonder
[1:53:37] who's got the vision
[1:53:41] who's laying even time the side to go
[1:53:44] help somebody
[1:53:47] you can't get away from the facts of the
[1:53:49] people that are dying the way the tree
[1:53:50] falls that's the way it lies
[1:53:54] God will use anybody that places them
[1:53:57] into his hand
[1:54:00] even though it took 100 lots to make an
[1:54:03] Abraham he would use lot
[1:54:06] who if all you're going to give him is a
[1:54:08] penny he'll use it
[1:54:17] I'm just going to try to
[1:54:20] finish it up here with some quotes if I
[1:54:22] can do that
[1:54:23] he said in the message testimony he says
[1:54:25] and you Christians don't stay in that
[1:54:28] lukewarm condition anymore lay aside
[1:54:30] everything
[1:54:32] just get as close to God as you can walk
[1:54:34] with him talk with him let everything
[1:54:36] else be secondary but your prayer life
[1:54:39] stay right with him at all times
[1:54:43] in the Healer Jerry's daughter brother
[1:54:45] Brandon says and every man that really
[1:54:47] feels the tug of the holy spirit will
[1:54:50] lay aside everything else and run to him
[1:54:53] if you really get to needing it bad
[1:54:55] enough it becomes between life and death
[1:54:57] you'll move no matter what anybody says
[1:54:59] that's right
[1:55:00] he must get to Jesus it's between life
[1:55:04] and death he must find him right quick
[1:55:08] brother Brandon was speaking of this
[1:55:10] when he's talking about the Believers up
[1:55:13] in Canada in the church in its condition
[1:55:15] he says and so they're very loyal to go
[1:55:18] to church no matter how cold it is
[1:55:20] outside
[1:55:22] they're wrapped up in a blanket and sit
[1:55:24] on the bobsled and drive the horse for
[1:55:27] 30 miles to get to go to church
[1:55:30] they'll walk through the snow drifts and
[1:55:32] everything else young and old
[1:55:33] they're all grouped together and one
[1:55:36] family gets the other family and they
[1:55:37] start walking and there they go it's the
[1:55:40] sacrifice that they make is what causes
[1:55:43] them to get so much out of the service
[1:55:48] I want to get more out of the service
[1:55:50] you just heard what you need to do
[1:55:55] he said where when there's no sacrifice
[1:55:59] there's not much to the service
[1:56:02] you have to really get down and do
[1:56:04] something that hurts you real bad
[1:56:07] you have to lay aside some things and
[1:56:10] and stop the work and do this and do
[1:56:13] that and get to the church and show God
[1:56:15] that you love them
[1:56:17] and you make a sacrifice to go it's then
[1:56:21] when you get something
[1:56:27] brother Brandon said how can I overcome
[1:56:29] he said there's a reward for the
[1:56:30] Overcomers press on Lily
[1:56:32] he says
[1:56:33] it's in you
[1:56:35] if it's he said if it's in you lay aside
[1:56:38] the mud
[1:56:40] and everything else and press towards
[1:56:42] the top
[1:56:43] to sit and he's quoting Jesus to sit
[1:56:45] with me on the throne
[1:56:47] press towards the top to sit with me
[1:56:51] brother Brandon said
[1:56:53] in the message beyond the curtain of
[1:56:55] time he said then a voice spoke to me
[1:56:59] now listen with the voice said this is
[1:57:02] what you preached
[1:57:04] that the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:06] this is perfect love
[1:57:08] nothing can enter here
[1:57:11] without it and a quote that's what
[1:57:13] brother Ram said the voice spoke to him
[1:57:18] how many times have you heard a preacher
[1:57:20] say that perfect love is the Holy Ghost
[1:57:23] or the Holy Ghost his perfect love
[1:57:29] now this is what the voice spoke
[1:57:32] there's got to be a connection
[1:57:34] there's got to be a connection
[1:57:37] nothing can enter here without it
[1:57:43] well
[1:57:49] three two more quotes and one more
[1:57:51] scripture
[1:57:53] thank you for bearing with me
[1:57:55] Jesus spoke in Luke 13 verse 23 he said
[1:58:00] uh one said to him ask him a question
[1:58:02] Lord are there few that be saved and he
[1:58:05] said unto them strive to enter into that
[1:58:07] straight gate for many I'll say unto you
[1:58:08] will seek to enter in and shall not be
[1:58:10] able
[1:58:11] millions and millions of people are
[1:58:14] going to seek to enter into heaven
[1:58:16] without
[1:58:18] getting perfect love
[1:58:20] so it's like they're spending this
[1:58:21] effort wanting God
[1:58:23] but not willing to pay the price
[1:58:27] in in the message
[1:58:29] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[1:58:30] Christ now this message he spoke to
[1:58:33] let's say about two and a half weeks
[1:58:35] after he spoke this message he's he
[1:58:38] preached his last message
[1:58:40] so this is right at the end before he
[1:58:42] leaves
[1:58:43] the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:58:45] Christ he says the bride knows where she
[1:58:47] stands
[1:58:48] she is very few
[1:58:50] he said there won't be many saved just a
[1:58:54] very very very few
[1:58:59] you say well there's they said there'd
[1:59:01] be thousands
[1:59:03] yes
[1:59:04] but they've come up to 2 000 years two
[1:59:09] on every age
[1:59:11] when it comes out see so in this age in
[1:59:14] this age there's going to be very few
[1:59:17] not very few but very very very few
[1:59:20] because it's the hardest age to attain
[1:59:23] before all the other ages they only
[1:59:25] needed so much
[1:59:27] this age we've got to get perfect love
[1:59:33] in the last quote from that time brother
[1:59:36] Brandon says I've been more determined
[1:59:38] to do everything I can to persuade men
[1:59:40] and women
[1:59:41] please be sure of this
[1:59:43] if God's love doesn't anchor in your
[1:59:46] heart supremely
[1:59:48] don't you take any sensation or motion
[1:59:50] you be sure that you can turn the other
[1:59:53] cheek
[1:59:54] that Christ is all and all to you don't
[1:59:59] miss it my brother now just remember I
[2:00:01] say this with the faith that I have in
[2:00:04] that Vision whatever it was I'll speak
[2:00:06] it in the name of the Lord except you
[2:00:08] have
[2:00:09] perfect love you'll never be there
[2:00:12] because nothing could ever be there
[2:00:14] without it now this is what he said he
[2:00:17] said your spirit would be out of place
[2:00:20] there
[2:00:21] it couldn't come there there'd be no way
[2:00:23] for it to come no matter that it would
[2:00:25] be he says no more than it would be if a
[2:00:28] grain of corn to raise up out of the
[2:00:30] ground without the germ of life in it no
[2:00:32] matter how natural it looks it could not
[2:00:34] raise
[2:00:35] my friend you old people you young
[2:00:38] people you don't know what time you're
[2:00:40] going to have to leave
[2:00:42] we don't know that but let me persuade
[2:00:44] you as a Christian brother that loves
[2:00:46] you except you're born again and that
[2:00:49] the spirit of God of love comes into
[2:00:52] your heart
[2:00:53] you'll certainly miss that place amen
[2:00:56] let's Stand Together God bless you thank
[2:00:58] you for your your patience
[2:01:16] thank you for your patience
[2:01:19] God bless your bodies
[2:01:22] got to give you strength
[2:01:27] foreign
[2:01:31] course I am so needy Lord
[2:01:36] try to focus on the Lord for just a
[2:01:39] second if he wants you to do anything
[2:01:46] amen

[2:17:48] amen amen
[2:17:51] brother Marty had something he wanted to
[2:17:54] share amen
[2:17:58] all right we called the prayer
[2:18:03] many of you know October is a pastor
[2:18:06] appreciation month and in the past we
[2:18:09] have always had like a meal or we've
[2:18:12] given them Gifts of him and and sister
[2:18:16] Cheryl and um
[2:18:17] uh but uh brother John has has asked for
[2:18:21] something different this year he doesn't
[2:18:23] want a a a banquet he doesn't want any
[2:18:27] gifts he doesn't want any trips anything
[2:18:28] like that he had just asked that uh that
[2:18:32] each and every one of you would just uh
[2:18:34] in one way show him uh appreciation not
[2:18:38] for his efforts but it's for what he has
[2:18:41] been preaching and it's all for the Lord
[2:18:42] but what he has asked is that you just
[2:18:45] show it through uh maybe contacting him
[2:18:48] and giving a testimony of what he has
[2:18:51] meant uh to you what the Lord has meant
[2:18:54] to you via his uh his preaching
[2:18:57] and uh
[2:18:58] another way would be uh just write him a
[2:19:01] letter
[2:19:02] how you feel and appreciation or a card
[2:19:06] anything like that and just yeah you got
[2:19:10] the whole month the whole month of
[2:19:11] October to do that and I think that just
[2:19:14] shows the heart of our our dear Pastor
[2:19:16] uh you know he's he never puts himself
[2:19:19] first never raises himself above anybody
[2:19:22] he's always putting himself below so uh
[2:19:25] but that's what he wants and so that's
[2:19:27] what I think we should all do so
[2:19:29] amen thank you let's just power ahead in
[2:19:33] the word of prayer dear heavenly father
[2:19:34] we're so thankful for this wonderful
[2:19:37] message that you have given us Lord we
[2:19:39] can see over the course of time here the
[2:19:43] pre how the preaching has gone Lord
[2:19:45] Jesus and it's
[2:19:46] it's just getting a higher level on a
[2:19:48] higher level and Lord Jesus if our dear
[2:19:52] Prophet had said back in 1965 that the
[2:19:56] Lord is coming soon
[2:19:57] how much sooner is he going to come now
[2:19:59] I know in many many hearts here feel
[2:20:03] that
[2:20:04] his coming as imminent Lord and as
[2:20:08] evidenced by what he said about those
[2:20:10] figures of all people dying and even in
[2:20:13] our own experience we've lost a loved
[2:20:16] one just so instantly when that same
[2:20:18] person would probably think that she had
[2:20:21] many many more years so may none of us
[2:20:23] feel that we have a lot of time and may
[2:20:26] we feel that an
[2:20:29] urgency Lord to follow your direction
[2:20:31] and what you have preached to us today
[2:20:34] Lord Jesus and may we be practical in
[2:20:37] looking at the things in our lives that
[2:20:39] are getting in the way and choking out
[2:20:41] everything Lord may we have perfect love
[2:20:43] Lord Jesus may we even look at our
[2:20:45] phones and look at the screen time how
[2:20:48] much time are we spending on on that
[2:20:50] phone and we think it's okay because
[2:20:52] it's it's news or whatever Lord Jesus
[2:20:55] forgive us for how much time we do spend
[2:20:58] on that Lord it just slips the devil
[2:21:00] puts a smoke screen out and just
[2:21:04] blocks our vision and so Lord may we
[2:21:07] have that heart for you Lord Jesus put
[2:21:09] everything aside let us work on
[2:21:11] everything that we can Lord and may we
[2:21:13] exhibit perfect love for you and may we
[2:21:15] all but just a desire to meet you in the
[2:21:18] air as soon as you come Lord
[2:21:20] we love you and thank you for your grace
[2:21:22] and your mercy in our lives and we pray
[2:21:24] these things in your precious holy name
[2:21:26] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[2:21:31] because I just wanted to say one thing I
[2:21:32] never talked to brother Marty but I did
[2:21:34] talk to Anne and it I I didn't say that
[2:21:37] everybody had to say something uh that
[2:21:42] that we've done for you that's not it
[2:21:45] and I just I I said if if if you if we
[2:21:51] did help you number one if if the if
[2:21:54] somehow the ministry the pastor has
[2:21:56] somehow helped in any any way if you
[2:21:59] want to you can share that would be that
[2:22:02] would definitely be encouraging but you
[2:22:05] know if it hasn't happened or you don't
[2:22:07] feel too you know don't do nothing you
[2:22:09] know
