[0:01] because they're my children
[0:05] and that will never stop i just feel it
[0:08] i may look at my age and i
[0:10] but it will never stop
[0:13] and i don't believe that god is ever
[0:15] going to stop rebuking me
[0:19] that would be saying like god stop
[0:20] loving me
[0:25] and so if there's anything that i need
[0:26] to do is be
[0:28] zealous fervent about repenting
[0:32] about the things that he says to me
[0:35] behold i
[0:36] stand at the door of man's heart
[0:40] and if any man hear my voice and open
[0:43] the door
[0:44] i will come to him and will sup with him
[0:46] and he with me
[0:48] god is a gentleman about getting us
[0:52] ready for a rapture
[0:54] that's true
[0:57] change is necessary for a rapture
[1:01] god is not going to squeeze us into
[1:03] getting ready
[1:06] he loves us so much that he will correct
[1:08] us
[1:09] but it's up to us to recognize that he
[1:12] is knocking at
[1:13] our door we don't want to come to church
[1:17] unpersonal we don't want to come to
[1:20] church
[1:21] as if we're just trying to gather some
[1:23] information pick a few things out
[1:26] that's going to help us individually
[1:29] but we need to come because this is
[1:32] where god
[1:33] promised to meet you personally
[1:38] behold i stand at the door of your heart
[1:41] and not just what gentlemen do
[1:44] a gentleman will stand there all night
[1:46] just he'll wait
[1:53] if you recognize that it's the voice of
[1:55] jesus speaking to you
[1:58] you recognize it's god speaking to you
[2:01] and you
[2:01] turn to obey him whatever that voice
[2:05] speaks to you
[2:06] at that point you are building your
[2:08] relationship with god
[2:11] you cannot expect god to build your
[2:14] relationship
[2:18] then he would be unjust for not building
[2:20] everybody else's
[2:23] we are the ones let's take the word
[2:26] do it and build the relationship
[2:29] and if we build that relationship he
[2:31] says i will come
[2:33] to him and will sup with him and he
[2:36] with me see that beautiful relationship
[2:40] i will stand upon my watch
[2:43] and set me upon the tower and watch
[2:47] to see what he will say to me
[2:50] and what i shall answer when i
[2:54] am reproved we're going to answer
[2:57] somehow
[2:58] we're either going to say amen lord so
[3:00] be it to me
[3:02] or we're going to say that's not for me
[3:04] i'm not receiving that
[3:06] i'm not going to accept that
[3:09] now this hour that we're living in it's
[3:12] a dangerous hour
[3:14] it's the most dangerous of all time
[3:18] the most deceptive it's the darkest hour
[3:21] that man has ever lived in brother
[3:24] branham when he saw
[3:25] this age it went into complete darkness
[3:30] we're living in horrific horrific
[3:34] perilous times as it was in the days
[3:37] of noah where nothing but evil was
[3:40] continually
[3:41] on man's heart as it was in the days of
[3:44] lot
[3:45] homosexuality and perverseness is just
[3:48] on a rampage the love
[3:52] of many jesus said is waxing cold
[3:56] hatred is rampant it was brought up in
[4:00] our men's meaning how terrible
[4:02] hatred is it's just growing
[4:07] jesus warned us to stand upon our tower
[4:12] as we see the day approaching not just
[4:16] with
[4:16] church attendance but getting more
[4:19] serious
[4:20] about the coming of the lord
[4:24] one of the biggest deceptions that satan
[4:26] has put on the church
[4:27] today is that they're already
[4:30] ready enough notice the way that i said
[4:34] that
[4:34] they're already enough
[4:38] no one's going to say i'm completely
[4:40] there but so
[4:42] many people are going to say
[4:46] i got the main shebang
[4:52] it's the biggest one of the biggest
[4:53] deceptions matthew chapter 24 verse 42
[4:57] jesus said
[4:58] watch therefore for ye know not what
[5:01] hour
[5:02] your lord doth come why doesn't he say
[5:07] hey to those who aren't ready
[5:10] watch but to those that who are ready
[5:13] you know you're okay you're already in
[5:18] but you know satan preaches that gospel
[5:21] to us
[5:23] you know you've got baptized right
[5:24] you've repented
[5:26] you're ready
[5:31] it's amazing how the devil wants to take
[5:33] the word of god and twist it
[5:35] but know this that if the good men of
[5:38] the household would have known what
[5:40] watched the thief would have come
[5:41] he would have watched and would have not
[5:43] suffered his house to be broken up
[5:46] therefore be also ready for in such an
[5:48] hours that you think
[5:51] the not of man cometh wow talk about
[5:54] distractions
[5:58] when we're thinking that jesus may come
[6:00] we're going to make different decisions
[6:04] when we think he's not going to be
[6:05] coming we're going to make so many plans
[6:10] when we see the signs out there and we
[6:13] see the signs
[6:17] but when we're comparing ourselves with
[6:19] those out there
[6:21] we feel ready
[6:24] but what we need to do is we need to be
[6:26] comparing
[6:27] with what he's speaking to our heart
[6:31] that's the scripture
[6:34] because this is what's going to get us
[6:36] ready it's not going to get me ready
[6:39] looking at all those in the bars
[6:42] all the drunks all the dry addicts
[6:45] looking at all those people and and
[6:48] feeling
[6:49] better that's not going to make me ready
[6:53] what's going to make me ready is
[6:55] whatever he speaks
[6:57] to my heart
[7:00] take that serious and it's so personal
[7:05] i don't even know what it is
[7:08] it's between you it's between god and
[7:10] you
[7:12] isn't that beautiful it's beautiful
[7:15] it's learning how to commune
[7:21] when jesus speaks to your heart how to
[7:23] respond back
[7:26] so beautiful watch therefore
[7:30] keep awake be vigilant when you're
[7:33] standing on that tower
[7:35] and you're watching for what he's going
[7:37] to be speaking to you
[7:40] spiritually stay fully awake brother
[7:43] brandon said
[7:44] pinch your conscience be sober be
[7:47] vigilant this is how you need to be on
[7:49] the tower you can
[7:52] church church church
[7:56] pretty soon it'll be over i'll get
[7:58] something out of it
[8:01] when we come to god's house in the flesh
[8:04] our flesh does not want to hear what
[8:07] god's really going to speak to us
[8:11] i'll i'll say like this he doesn't want
[8:13] to hear god's reproof
[8:16] that's right sometimes we even battle
[8:21] whether or not it's worth going that's
[8:24] true
[8:26] come on now i'm not saying that's how
[8:28] everybody feels all the time that's not
[8:30] what i'm saying
[8:31] but you can get so far from where you
[8:33] need to be with your
[8:34] walking in the spirit of god that you
[8:36] could actually think like that
[8:39] but when you're walking in the spirit we
[8:42] simply
[8:43] can not wait to get there
[8:50] that's it there's no in between
[8:54] and as brother bran said we come to find
[8:56] out where we're at with god that's why
[8:58] we can't wait to get there
[9:00] not in a carnal sense of have we been
[9:03] bad
[9:05] but in a spiritual sense how can i
[9:07] please him
[9:08] how can i make him more happy how can i
[9:11] how can he put a smile on his face
[9:16] just all depends on where we're at i was
[9:19] glad
[9:20] when they said unto me let us go let us
[9:23] go
[9:24] to the house of the lord and i believe
[9:26] the holy spirit says that to us
[9:29] let us go to the house of the lord amen
[9:32] psalms 27 verse 4 one thing have i
[9:35] desired of the lord
[9:37] and that will i seek after that i may
[9:40] dwell
[9:41] in the house of the lord all the days of
[9:43] my life
[9:45] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[9:47] inquire
[9:48] in his temple i will see how
[9:51] i will answer when i am
[9:54] reproved if you're in the flesh
[9:58] you're going to answer quite different
[10:00] than when you're in the spirit
[10:06] so i wonder i will
[10:09] see how i will answer isn't it
[10:12] you know brother branham said it's not
[10:14] the action it's not what god speaks
[10:17] but it's how we react to the situation
[10:25] it's not the action that counts but the
[10:28] rea i
[10:28] thought god would just come down and put
[10:31] his hand over me
[10:32] and just heal me in my leprosy why do i
[10:34] gotta go down there
[10:36] to those dirty waters see
[10:40] it wasn't the action what god told
[10:43] naaman but it's how he was reacting
[10:47] he was in the flesh when he came to
[10:49] church
[10:53] and through the singing through the
[10:55] praise through the worship
[10:58] god i'm thinking better amen
[11:02] thinking well the lord could have
[11:05] asked me to do something that would be
[11:06] almost impossible for me to do
[11:09] so i think i'm just going to run with it
[11:13] just run with it no matter what god
[11:16] speaks to you
[11:17] run with it you
[11:20] need it
[11:24] put it in practice
[11:28] when you recognize god is standing at
[11:30] the door to your heart and speaking to
[11:32] you
[11:33] no one else is hearing this
[11:38] no one else is hearing it it's your
[11:41] personal vision
[11:42] [Music]
[11:47] it's no longer eyes are here
[11:52] the eyes are here god's speaking to our
[11:55] hearts
[11:58] what will we do when he speaks to us
[12:02] what we do with it take the vision
[12:06] make it plain on the table of your heart
[12:09] in other words open the door and
[12:12] write it on your heart say amen so be it
[12:16] unto me
[12:17] according to thy word lord
[12:21] the lord is not reproving us because
[12:25] he's trying to just make a perfectionist
[12:28] out of us
[12:31] carnally like what we would think about
[12:33] one another
[12:36] he dislikes so many things that we think
[12:39] about
[12:42] so many things that we we do and we make
[12:45] excuses for but yet we judge others
[12:48] [Music]
[12:50] i mean there's many things that god
[12:53] wants to say to us but we can't bear it
[12:56] remember growing up and our oldest
[13:00] brother or friends in the neighborhood
[13:02] they would
[13:02] oh you're just a baby you can't take it
[13:04] i dare you
[13:08] and they were trying to get you to do
[13:10] something that
[13:12] you normally wouldn't do
[13:15] well god wants us to take it take the
[13:18] word
[13:19] and run with it amen not
[13:24] play with it not say amen
[13:28] and then don't do nothing with it
[13:33] it's dangerous second corinthians
[13:36] chapter three verse two
[13:39] second corinthians chapter three verse
[13:41] two for as much as ye
[13:42] are manifestly declared to be the
[13:46] epistles of christ
[13:48] ministered by us written not with ink
[13:51] but with the spirit of living god not in
[13:54] tables of stone
[13:57] but in fleshly tables of heart known
[14:00] and read of all men make it plain
[14:03] upon the tables of your heart it's got
[14:07] to go there
[14:08] it can't just go one one ear and out the
[14:11] other it can't just stay in the brain
[14:15] it needs to sink down to the heart it
[14:18] needs to be
[14:19] written there why does it need to be
[14:21] written there
[14:24] verse 2 and the lord answered me and
[14:27] said write the vision
[14:28] and make it plain upon tables that he
[14:32] may run that read it
[14:37] when people see that it's become your
[14:40] life and they read your life it's a an
[14:43] epistle
[14:45] manifestly declared to be jesus christ
[14:47] they know
[14:48] what to do they will run with it
[14:56] that's why you put it there so other
[14:59] people can read it
[15:01] you already got such a special
[15:03] relationship with god
[15:05] you come to church with the
[15:06] understanding that real things happen
[15:09] at church real things happen real
[15:13] changes happen but the person out there
[15:16] that don't know god
[15:17] they don't know they've never
[15:18] experienced this before
[15:21] but when they see it living in you
[15:23] because you took it and you
[15:25] wrote it right here you go out and you
[15:27] manifest it
[15:28] then they see it and they want to run
[15:30] with it too they want what you got
[15:37] brothers and sisters we're in a race
[15:42] most people are oblivious to it
[15:46] they're stuck in lukewarm state
[15:49] of laodicea
[15:53] but we need to make it plain where we're
[15:56] standing with god
[15:57] and where we're standing with what god
[15:59] spoke to us
[16:01] when other people read our lives they
[16:04] will join
[16:05] the race
[16:09] that's what we want we want them to join
[16:12] the race
[16:15] because if they don't they're going to
[16:16] perish without a vision
[16:20] the people perish
[16:23] when you hear god speak to you that's
[16:26] god's
[16:27] vision for you god visualizes you
[16:32] to take this word become this word eat
[16:35] this book
[16:36] right this is the vision
[16:40] if you don't take that vision out
[16:43] and live it amongst people they will die
[16:49] all of us are going to save somebody
[16:52] amen
[16:53] all of us are going to save somebody
[16:56] they're not going to get saved unless
[16:58] you have that vision
[17:04] and i i like what our brother larry said
[17:08] he says if i'm doing it
[17:12] nothing's going to avail to it but if
[17:13] the lord's doing it in me
[17:15] something's going to happen right
[17:16] brother
[17:18] and that's christ in us the hope of
[17:21] glory
[17:22] the hope of anyone reaching glory is
[17:25] christ
[17:25] in us hebrews chapter
[17:29] 12 verse 1 foreseen
[17:33] we are compassed about what's so great a
[17:35] cloud of witnesses
[17:37] let us lay aside every weight and the
[17:40] sin
[17:41] which just so easily beset us and let us
[17:43] run
[17:44] with patience the race that is set
[17:46] before us
[17:49] there are things in every one of our
[17:50] lives that are slowing us down
[17:54] weights that keep us from running
[17:59] hard with the lord jesus
[18:03] we need to think about those weights
[18:06] because they're all different for us
[18:08] i don't got the problem you got you
[18:11] don't got the problem i got
[18:14] but to both of us they are weights and
[18:17] weights they're like
[18:18] magnets to our flesh they hold us down
[18:23] we need to cut them off
[18:26] we need to get rid of them we need to
[18:29] pray one for another
[18:30] when you pray for john martin don't just
[18:32] pray for the
[18:34] for the ministry god bless john marlon
[18:36] cut those weights off lord
[18:40] amen i need my weights cut off
[18:47] it is our responsibility to lay aside
[18:51] every weight not god's
[18:54] don't expect god to come here and just
[18:57] do it all for you
[18:58] kind of relationship is that let me just
[19:02] take your personal relationship for a
[19:04] minute
[19:04] brother mark i'm sorry you're not
[19:06] married
[19:08] you can't be in this one but every one
[19:11] of us that is married
[19:13] there's times that our
[19:17] significant other our partner
[19:22] the other sex i want to make is clear
[19:25] that when i say partner i'm not meeting
[19:30] case anybody's watching this down the
[19:32] road
[19:35] but there's some times that your
[19:38] husband or your wife wants you
[19:41] to do something and what they're asking
[19:44] you to do
[19:45] is not as easy as flipping a coin
[19:50] it hurts it's painful
[19:53] it takes time it takes money it takes
[19:56] working extra hours
[19:59] whatever but it's the right thing to do
[20:03] because it's love
[20:08] don't expect god to do something that
[20:11] you can be doing
[20:16] lay it aside whatever he reproves
[20:20] lay it aside run with
[20:24] it don't battle it don't debate it don't
[20:27] go
[20:28] if as soon as you go into the the battle
[20:30] of reasoning
[20:31] you lost i don't care how long you're
[20:34] there
[20:35] you lost we've got to cast
[20:38] down reason every thought that exalteth
[20:41] itself
[20:42] against the knowledge of god against the
[20:44] will of god for our lives
[20:46] cast it down amen
[20:50] run with what god gives you amen
[20:53] don't ignore the race that's set before
[20:56] you
[20:58] don't miss your day of visitation and
[21:01] i'll say this each and every time you
[21:02] come to church
[21:03] god is going to visit you
[21:08] and do not expect him to
[21:12] to build this whole thing up and make
[21:15] you feel good and give you your favorite
[21:17] scripture and
[21:18] and and and give you everything that
[21:20] you're asking for
[21:22] i've been coming church long enough to
[21:24] know that god does not give me
[21:26] everything i'm asking for
[21:30] well brother john what's the problem
[21:34] well maybe i'm not walking uprightly
[21:39] maybe what i'm wanting isn't the right
[21:41] thing for me
[21:44] there could be a lot of reasons i'm not
[21:46] getting maybe it's not the right time
[21:50] but i do know this that god is here and
[21:54] he's got something for me
[21:56] and that's all that really matters
[22:01] focusing on what god has in our
[22:04] visitation
[22:06] very important don't
[22:09] run the race with weights don't try to
[22:12] do it
[22:14] don't mix it together don't mix it with
[22:18] weights of doubt or questions or
[22:20] uncertainties
[22:21] just take the word and run with it
[22:25] get the weights off you so you can run
[22:27] faster
[22:28] so you can endure more so you can
[22:31] overcome
[22:32] more so you can endure hardness as a
[22:35] good soldier
[22:35] jesus christ lay aside the things that
[22:39] god is telling you to lay aside that's
[22:41] what reproof is
[22:44] the reproof that he's speaking to your
[22:46] heart
[22:47] answer him with a sincere amen
[22:51] and run with it run with it
[22:54] run with it run with it
[22:57] we've got to think about the
[23:00] relationship
[23:00] part can i can't
[23:06] imagine
[23:11] my wife asking me to do something for
[23:14] years and never doing it
[23:16] and expect that to be a normal
[23:20] relationship
[23:23] how long has the lord been asking us to
[23:25] do something
[23:28] and we call that normal relationship
[23:34] we got to run with it looking
[23:38] unto jesus the author and finisher
[23:42] of our faith for the joy that was set
[23:45] before him
[23:46] he endured the cross despising the shame
[23:49] and to set down the right hand of throne
[23:50] of god
[23:52] for consider him that endured such
[23:54] contradiction of sinners against himself
[23:56] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[23:58] minds
[23:58] you have not resisted unto blood
[24:00] striving against sin
[24:03] right it hasn't been as bad as what god
[24:05] has gone through
[24:06] and you have forgotten the exhortation
[24:08] which speaketh unto you
[24:10] as unto children my son despise not the
[24:14] chastening of the lord nor
[24:15] faint when you're reproved
[24:19] of him
[24:22] a lot of ways we can faint faint can
[24:24] just be
[24:26] ignored service will be over shortly
[24:31] put your mind on other things
[24:35] not deal with it kick the can down the
[24:37] road
[24:39] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[24:43] and scourges every son that he receiveth
[24:45] we come to church
[24:47] we want to be received i want to be
[24:49] received of the lord
[24:52] every time we bring a sacrifice and
[24:53] offer we want him to to accept it
[24:56] we bring the sacrifice of praise and
[24:58] worship
[25:00] it's not just at the beginning when you
[25:02] give your heart to the lord
[25:04] if you endure chastening
[25:08] god is dealing with you as with
[25:11] sons so when he speaks to you
[25:15] and you say lord oh help me and you
[25:18] do it yes
[25:21] that means you have a proper
[25:23] relationship with the father
[25:26] proper relationship with the father
[25:31] but let's
[25:34] but if you are without chastisement
[25:39] in other words i don't i'm not going to
[25:40] do that i don't have to do that ah
[25:42] don't you tell i want better preaching
[25:45] than that
[25:50] where we're called in the scripture not
[25:52] his son
[25:54] that's not the god does not have any
[25:57] children like that
[26:02] if you endure chasing god deal with your
[26:04] sons for what son is he whom the father
[26:07] chasteneth not
[26:10] is there any dads here that did not
[26:13] correct their children
[26:14] in any way let me see your hands
[26:18] oh let me see your hands if you stop
[26:21] correcting them after two years old
[26:24] after six years old
[26:28] after 10 why is it that we
[26:32] should feel the right that we can come
[26:34] to church
[26:35] and never corrected because we're
[26:38] so old in the lord
[26:43] when i go through these scriptures lord
[26:46] have mercy on me
[26:48] as he reveals things lord have mercy i'm
[26:50] not even worthy to come up here
[26:52] and speak this
[27:00] what is god saying here
[27:03] take god's word and write it on the
[27:06] table of your heart and
[27:07] run with it run out of here with it
[27:11] don't leave it here take it with you
[27:16] that he who reads your life may run
[27:20] with you
[27:23] that's where we're going with this
[27:26] you want to win a soul for the lord
[27:36] but if you don't take the chastisement
[27:38] you don't take what he's saying
[27:41] it won't go on your heart who's going to
[27:44] run with you
[27:47] who is it going to attract who are you
[27:49] going to attract and where are you going
[27:50] to take him to
[27:53] you're supposed to preach everything
[27:56] that god commands you to do
[27:59] i know that's hard god is looking for
[28:03] some serious runners
[28:05] who are willing to take what he says and
[28:08] run with it
[28:11] not it's not a time for us to be
[28:13] fainting
[28:14] taking it easy
[28:17] i know when i used to run long races
[28:21] used to run long distances there's a few
[28:24] things that you needed
[28:26] to finish strong the first
[28:29] is you needed patience
[28:34] you need to be patient because when
[28:35] you're running and you're huffing
[28:37] and you're puffing you want this thing
[28:38] over with
[28:45] it's it you could never get it over fast
[28:48] enough
[28:49] a long race a sprint is different
[28:52] but a long race it just couldn't get
[28:55] over fast enough
[28:58] so you needed patience another thing you
[29:01] needed was a goal
[29:03] you needed to focus on your goal
[29:06] because your body wanted to quit all the
[29:09] time
[29:10] and you needed a goal to focus on
[29:14] there's something at the end of this
[29:16] hardship that you're going through that
[29:18] you're going to be rewarded with
[29:20] that's the goal and you needed
[29:24] encouragement
[29:27] you that's the octane in the tank
[29:31] you needed people saying come on you can
[29:34] do it keep going you're almost there you
[29:36] got them keep going
[29:40] you needed that and we all
[29:43] had somebody cheering us on at one time
[29:46] or another
[29:52] well they were cheering brother random
[29:54] on when he was racing
[29:56] they said keep pressing
[30:00] keep pressing
[30:03] we're almost there
[30:11] thank god
[30:15] that we're almost home thank god
[30:19] that we only got to press a little bit
[30:21] longer but it's no time to stop pressing
[30:25] we need to be serious about running
[30:27] [Music]
[30:29] i want to encourage you today my dear
[30:32] fellow runners that there are
[30:36] other believers that have gone on before
[30:39] you
[30:39] previous runners they're looking over
[30:42] the banister
[30:43] from heaven at one time
[30:46] they had the baton and they were running
[30:51] and then they handed it to somebody and
[30:54] they went on to meet with the lord
[30:58] and they gave the baton to someone and
[31:01] then they gave it to someone and then
[31:03] they gave it to somebody
[31:06] and today in this age you're holding the
[31:08] baton
[31:09] that our forefathers in the spirit had
[31:12] run with
[31:16] you just don't know how it trinkled down
[31:18] but you've got it spiritually
[31:20] and you got to run with it be serious
[31:24] about this race
[31:27] you've got to hand it to somebody
[31:31] you got to get somebody saved
[31:35] they got to join the race you got to
[31:37] take the word
[31:38] write it plain on the tables of your
[31:40] heart that they that read your life can
[31:42] run with you
[31:44] oh how we need a revelation of that
[31:49] today
[31:51] we're foreseen we're also compassed
[31:53] about what's so
[31:54] great a cloud or witnesses let us lay
[31:57] aside every weight
[31:59] and this sin which just so easily beset
[32:01] us and let us
[32:02] run the race with patience that set
[32:05] before us
[32:06] you know too many people
[32:10] don't want to run
[32:13] they want to think that all i have to do
[32:16] is say i'm in
[32:17] the race
[32:20] i'd like to talk about two races
[32:26] if you're not doing well in the first
[32:28] race you're not a qualifier of the
[32:31] second
[32:32] you know how that goes you can't meet
[32:36] you can't get to the next race until you
[32:38] won the first one
[32:40] too many christians are simply too
[32:42] satisfied
[32:43] with just being in the first race
[32:48] they're not very interested in how
[32:51] they're running
[32:54] they don't care if they're running fast
[32:56] enough
[32:58] they don't care about so many things
[33:03] they don't care if they make it to
[33:04] church don't make it to church if they
[33:06] take the word don't take the word
[33:09] long as they're just
[33:12] in the race i'm a christian
[33:18] you know it's like brother ben taking
[33:21] doors out of the water
[33:25] they don't care if the water is out of
[33:26] the water they don't care if they're not
[33:28] rolling
[33:29] they don't care if they're they're not
[33:30] pressing in very hard
[33:32] they don't care if they've stopped
[33:34] praying real hard
[33:36] they've settled for a lukewarm run
[33:44] let's look at this first race in 1st
[33:45] corinthians chapter 9 verse 24
[33:47] know ye not that they which run in a
[33:50] race run all but
[33:52] one receiveth the prize
[33:55] so run that ye may obtain now this is
[33:58] what's very difficult
[34:03] we all feel we've obtained
[34:08] so why do i need to run
[34:12] why do i need to try
[34:19] have we obtained or haven't we depends
[34:22] on what preacher you put behind the
[34:23] pulpit with that
[34:25] where they're going to go with that we
[34:27] all want to hear a preacher say
[34:29] you're in you've attained you're there
[34:31] you're predestinated
[34:33] it's gonna happen don't you worry about
[34:35] anything just
[34:36] take it easy
[34:39] but i'm trying to take that message and
[34:42] fit it into this
[34:45] brother branham says it's got to
[34:46] dovetail from genesis to revelations
[34:49] it's got to find its place i believe
[34:53] paul believed in predestination
[34:57] i believe he believed in eternal
[35:00] security
[35:01] i believe he believed in the seal of the
[35:03] holy ghost
[35:06] but i also believe that he said we need
[35:09] to run
[35:11] so we can obtain
[35:17] are you with me
[35:23] in this first race there's only one
[35:25] winner
[35:26] we've talked about it's either your
[35:28] flesh or your soul
[35:31] but only one wins
[35:34] you're the you that are in the race but
[35:37] running with
[35:38] little effort or trying
[35:41] only some of the time we definitely need
[35:45] a revelation
[35:47] that we haven't obtained yet that's the
[35:51] revelation we need
[35:54] i haven't attained if there's a
[35:56] revelation we need that's the one
[36:00] but we're searching for that revelation
[36:02] that i have attained
[36:05] right that's the if i speak in tongues
[36:09] i got it i've attained same spirit
[36:13] same spirit it's one word
[36:17] i proved it i spoke in tongues
[36:22] i've attained i got a revelation i'm
[36:25] yeah that's the right it all leads to
[36:28] doing nothing
[36:30] that's right
[36:34] what kind of runner is that right we
[36:37] need to run
[36:38] that we may obtain that means obtain
[36:41] something that we do not have
[36:43] right jesus said he that endureth to the
[36:46] end
[36:47] the same shall be saved
[36:52] he never said he that's got a revelation
[36:56] he that endureth because think about
[37:00] every single person
[37:01] that has backslidden from jesus christ
[37:06] maybe not every single one because
[37:08] there's still like real weak ones but i
[37:10] mean
[37:11] the ones that have been looked like they
[37:13] were solid for a while
[37:15] all felt they had a revelation
[37:18] that they're in it for nothing's going
[37:20] to happen kind of like peter
[37:23] i'll die for you right so
[37:26] it doesn't matter how we feel about the
[37:28] subject what matters is we just
[37:30] take it and run with it run the race
[37:34] as if you haven't attained
[37:38] so run that ye may obtain the prize it's
[37:41] no time
[37:42] to make your victory lap
[37:47] i'm there i made it i do
[37:50] i'm in that's right
[37:54] yeah that's right no time to act like a
[37:57] christian who's already attained
[38:00] philippians chapter 3 verse 12 paul said
[38:03] not as though i've already attained
[38:06] either
[38:07] already perfect
[38:11] but i follow after if i may apprehend
[38:14] that for which i've also operand of
[38:16] jesus
[38:17] christ who which also i am apprehended
[38:20] jesus christ
[38:22] brethren i count not myself to have
[38:25] apprehended
[38:26] for this one thing i do i'm forgetting
[38:28] those things which are behind and
[38:29] reaching forth for those things which
[38:31] are before
[38:32] i press towards the mark for the prize
[38:34] for the
[38:35] of the high calling in christ jesus look
[38:37] at these words
[38:38] i haven't retained i don't count myself
[38:42] apprehended i forgetting those things
[38:45] are be
[38:46] behind i'm reaching forth
[38:49] i press towards the the mark
[38:53] i'm looking for a prize of a high
[38:56] calling
[38:58] this is the race and this is what we
[39:02] need to be
[39:02] feeling in our souls and when we feel it
[39:06] so strong in our souls
[39:07] it's easy to come to church and hear
[39:10] what the lord is going to speak to us
[39:12] without being bent out of shape
[39:16] feeling so defeated
[39:23] you know what what god is having to do
[39:25] he's having to fight off the spirits
[39:28] that you let in your heart and mine
[39:33] you let the devil sweet talk you into a
[39:36] lukewarm walk
[39:38] and then god's got to speak from the
[39:41] pulpit
[39:45] you know what i love about this and i
[39:46] feel so free
[39:48] i never know what the lord's doing
[39:50] brother ron
[39:53] but i i have a revelation that god deals
[39:57] with our hearts
[39:58] and that's all that matters he can take
[40:01] a word
[40:03] and if if the spirit of the word the
[40:06] life of christ
[40:07] is through that word it will go and
[40:10] reach the mark
[40:12] but it has to be the spirit there that's
[40:14] why it's important
[40:15] to yield it's no time to be running
[40:19] around like a peacock
[40:21] showing off that you've already attained
[40:24] look at verse 15 let us therefore as
[40:25] many as be perfect
[40:26] be thus minded and if anything and if
[40:29] in anything you be otherwise minded
[40:33] god shall reveal this unto you in other
[40:35] words god is going to speak to you about
[40:38] that subject
[40:40] he's going to somehow get it across to
[40:42] you that you ain't ready yet
[40:45] you need to humble yourself and come and
[40:48] receive
[40:48] gold tried in the fire amen amen brother
[40:52] brahm said in the message expectation
[40:54] brother
[40:55] samson it sent this to me
[40:58] and maybe some of the others got it as
[41:00] well
[41:01] he said in the message expectation
[41:04] there's one thing that jesus christ
[41:05] lacked in his life
[41:09] he says i hate to say that but he did
[41:13] jesus lacked one thing
[41:16] a modern showmanship
[41:20] [Laughter]
[41:22] he wasn't a show-off no everybody
[41:25] today's got to have a great big
[41:28] uh headlines and bragging about what
[41:30] they're doing
[41:32] that's a stuffed shirt that's right
[41:35] that's not a servant of god a servant of
[41:38] god will be humble
[41:40] and keep himself back
[41:46] i'm pressing towards the mark
[41:49] don't be a stuff shirt press towards the
[41:51] mark
[41:52] let's get back to first corinthians
[41:54] chapter 9 verse 24 know ye
[41:56] not that they which run in a race run
[41:58] all but one receiveth the price so
[42:00] run that ye may obtain so
[42:03] in this first race here we see
[42:06] that as jesus said he that tries to save
[42:10] his life is going to lose it
[42:12] that's the race you've got to give up
[42:14] this life
[42:15] for eternal life that's a
[42:18] you've got to give up this life for
[42:21] eternal life what does that mean brother
[42:22] john
[42:23] you got to give up what you want to do
[42:24] in this life
[42:28] to receive eternal life
[42:32] you can what what what jesus said you
[42:34] could gain the whole world lose your
[42:36] soul what
[42:36] what did you get out of it
[42:39] so every man that striving for the
[42:41] mastery is temperant and all things
[42:44] but they do it to obtain a corruptable
[42:46] crown
[42:49] so i got this little corruptable crown
[42:52] here
[42:56] striving for a corruptable crown
[43:05] i remember i was so great when i won
[43:10] this
[43:13] it's not even mine i'm borrowing it's my
[43:16] father-in-law's i don't even
[43:17] i don't think i have any more trophies
[43:20] but they do it to obtain this yeah
[43:24] but we incorruptible
[43:28] in other words it's a crown that stays
[43:30] with you forever
[43:32] for eternity it's called eternal life
[43:36] i therefore shall run not as uncertainly
[43:40] not as one sulfide not as one that
[43:43] beateth the air
[43:46] but i keep my i keep under my body and
[43:50] bring it into subjection let's by any
[43:51] means when i preach to others
[43:53] i myself should be a castaway
[43:59] we've got to bring those thoughts and
[44:02] things in our life
[44:04] that constantly and will continually
[44:07] try to creep into our lives and bring it
[44:10] into subjection
[44:12] when god speaks to our heart when he
[44:15] rebukes us when he reproves us
[44:18] just run with it
[44:23] don't take it and kind of leave it in
[44:25] the car for a couple weeks
[44:29] don't write it down and just keep it in
[44:31] your bible case and then you
[44:33] forget about it run with it
[44:36] obey it
[44:41] i know time is running short here but i
[44:43] want to talk
[44:45] about the second race because if you're
[44:47] running
[44:48] in the first race you're a qualifier for
[44:51] the second race
[44:53] and it's not for everybody you got to
[44:54] have the correct mindset the right
[44:55] attitude
[44:56] you got to be pressing towards the mark
[44:58] you got to be you got to have the
[45:00] the the mindset that i'm not there and i
[45:03] i gotta get
[45:04] all that's what you need for the second
[45:08] race
[45:09] let's go back to first corinthians
[45:11] chapter nine verse six
[45:13] first sixteen
[45:17] now paul is talking about a reward
[45:25] remember at the at the end of this which
[45:28] we read at the beginning
[45:30] only one receives the prize
[45:34] though all one run only one receives a
[45:36] prize so he's starting out
[45:38] talking about a reward for though i
[45:41] preach
[45:41] the gospel i have nothing to gloria for
[45:44] in necessity
[45:45] for necessity it is laid upon me yea woe
[45:49] is unto me if i preach not the gospel
[45:53] for if i do this thing willingly i have
[45:56] a reward now what is that reward
[46:03] okay you're you're
[46:06] you're we're gonna see this at the end
[46:10] if you do it willingly you have a reward
[46:14] preach the gospel talk about preaching
[46:17] the gospel here
[46:19] but if against my will a dispensation of
[46:22] the gospel
[46:22] is committed unto me what is
[46:26] my reward then there's no reward
[46:30] if you're doing this because you
[46:33] have to
[46:36] fairly that when i preach the gospel i
[46:39] make
[46:41] the gospel of christ without charge
[46:45] that i abuse not my power in the gospel
[46:49] can you imagine trying to share brother
[46:51] ron was in the men's meeting trying to
[46:53] show us what it's like sharing the
[46:55] gospel
[46:56] of jesus christ without charge
[47:01] and he was saying yes you know you can
[47:05] come to know jesus or is that brother
[47:07] mike it was both of you maybe
[47:10] i know his brother ron oh yeah witness
[47:13] yeah you know you might want to try it
[47:14] you know it's
[47:17] no believing in it yourself
[47:22] no charge no it's life or
[47:26] death no you're going to hell if you
[47:29] don't accept
[47:30] jesus christ as your savior it's without
[47:33] charge
[47:36] what's your reward now look he steps
[47:40] into verse 19.
[47:44] for though i be free from all men he's
[47:47] talking about his willingness now
[47:50] i make myself a servant
[47:53] unto all that i might gain some i'm by
[47:56] making the more
[47:58] so people who are not willing to do this
[47:59] willingly they won't be a servant
[48:03] the only way they're going to win
[48:04] somebody it was with the comfortability
[48:06] of their
[48:07] their hammock their cell phone yeah
[48:11] no suffering just you know
[48:15] i want to invite you to church all right
[48:17] yeah
[48:19] yeah i want you to come
[48:25] no won't be a servant won't serve
[48:28] just gonna not do it willingly paul
[48:33] is willingly showing how to get the
[48:36] prize
[48:40] for though i be free from all men i made
[48:42] myself servant and all that i might gain
[48:44] the more
[48:44] in unto the jew i became as jew
[48:48] that i may gain the jews to them that
[48:49] are under the laws as under the law that
[48:51] i may gain them there under the law to
[48:53] them that are without the law is without
[48:55] law but not without the law to god but
[48:59] under the law of christ
[49:01] that i might gain them that are without
[49:03] the law to the weak
[49:04] became i as weak that i might gain the
[49:08] weak
[49:09] i made all things to all men that by
[49:11] that i might by all means
[49:14] not just the hammock and the cell phone
[49:17] that i may that i might by all means
[49:20] save
[49:21] some now here's the catcher
[49:25] and this i do for the gospel sake
[49:28] that i might be partaker with
[49:31] you now keep the same
[49:36] same mindset as we read the scriptures
[49:40] know ye not that they which run in a
[49:43] race run all
[49:44] but one receiveth the prize
[49:48] so run that ye may obtain
[49:52] paul knew he said i do this i am going
[49:56] to serve you
[49:58] i am going to do everything i can to win
[50:00] you to christ
[50:01] that i might be a partaker with you
[50:07] now we know that the the prize
[50:10] is eternal life which is jesus christ
[50:14] but i can be a partaker of his crown
[50:21] brother brandon says you're attached to
[50:22] it throughout eternity
[50:26] now we're here today to get instructions
[50:28] to write it on the tables of our heart
[50:30] so we can take and run with it so when
[50:34] others see it
[50:35] they can want to run with you now if you
[50:37] save their soul
[50:38] you're a partaker with them it's no
[50:41] longer you saying
[50:42] me
[50:47] now you're saying i'm a partaker of this
[50:50] one
[50:51] i'm a partaker of this one and you share
[50:54] that crown
[50:55] together somebody shared the gospel with
[50:59] me
[51:00] somebody is sharing that with me
[51:04] we have a chance to share this
[51:07] crown to be a partaker
[51:11] not just one not just two not just our
[51:14] our favorite friends or our family
[51:17] become all things to all men that you
[51:20] may win
[51:21] some you're only going to get some
[51:24] but it's worth giving your all give your
[51:26] all
[51:29] throughout eternity this thing is going
[51:31] to corrupt
[51:33] i shouldn't say that about something
[51:34] that don't belong to me but
[51:36] [Music]
[51:37] all mine corrupted they're gone
[51:40] probably been sandwiched in some sort of
[51:42] garbage thing
[51:44] but a soul can never
[51:48] crush can never diminish
[51:52] every time you see that person in heaven
[51:56] you're connected you're a partaker with
[51:59] them
[52:00] they wouldn't be there without you
[52:06] so run that you may obtain that soul
[52:09] run so you can obtain that soul don't
[52:12] waste your time down here
[52:18] run with it run with it
[52:22] run with what god gives you because he
[52:24] what he has in mind
[52:26] is another soul don't be so selfish that
[52:29] the only thing he's caring about
[52:30] is you amen that ain't the god that
[52:33] saved me
[52:34] amen the god that saved me was not
[52:37] selfish
[52:41] in fact when he saved me i thought i've
[52:43] got to be the least of all
[52:49] paul he said he was the least and he
[52:51] became a servant of all
[52:56] praise the lord let's stand together
[53:01] so many things i'd like to say right now
[53:05] but i just want to say keep running
[53:09] run with whatever god gives you write it
[53:11] on the table of your heart
[53:13] and run with it let
[53:16] people see a difference in your life
[53:18] keep
[53:19] running keep your eyes on jesus no
[53:22] matter what he says
[53:24] when he comes when you come to church no
[53:26] matter what he says
[53:28] just run with it
[53:31] the moment that you begin to
[53:40] say
[53:44] there's some here that are not running
[53:46] the race with all their heart
[53:53] we're taking some things and leaving
[53:55] others
[53:59] we've lost our vision for souls
[54:06] we want to get that back
[54:10] but it's personal between you and god
[54:14] see the word just comes it's up to you
[54:16] to say that's mine
[54:17] that's mine i'm taking it i'm taking it
[54:20] because there may be somebody here that
[54:21] says
[54:23] service is over that's about the right
[54:24] time
[54:28] we need serious runners we need we need
[54:32] we need someone coming in with the
[54:34] testimony you know what that testimony
[54:35] is
[54:36] they brought a soul to church that's
[54:39] that's the kind of testimony we need
[54:41] someone who's going to take
[54:42] time to bring a soul to church that's a
[54:45] testimony
[54:46] that's a testimony of what they believe
[54:50] it's not you know you can make winning
[54:53] souls for everybody else
[54:57] but just remember only one receives the
[55:00] prize
[55:02] only one receives the prize
[55:07] somebody they that wins those is wise
[55:12] somebody's got to get the job done why
[55:15] can't it be you
[55:17] you know more about the lord than all
[55:20] the
[55:20] denominations out there think about it
[55:24] you know more about the relationship
[55:27] with jesus christ

[56:46] partaker
[56:47] of another
[56:51] soul
[56:55] there are some that want to
[56:58] see heaven rejoice
[57:04] over one coming to you

[57:11] are willing to put time
[57:15] to become a servant to others
