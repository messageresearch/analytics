of the Lord amen good to be with brothers and sisters of light precious face good to see brother and sister Johnson amen God bless you and may the Lord just come and and be with those that are in their homes live streaming today would that all would be here concerning this subject but we are grateful for the live stream amen um turn with me if you would Into the Book of Matthew chapter 27. Matthew chapter 27 now we we're going to have communion today I just want to share a little bit about my heart about communion um there in my heart I desire everybody to be in communion come on and my my thoughts were um that we'd have more people on Sunday morning that could have communion then on Wednesday just Naturally Speaking more people come on on Sundays plus it's harder for some to not drive at night I also had a desire to have communion before Brother Bruce went into surgery and then I wanted to have wanted to wait till brother Ron got back from his vacation and so you see I know my heart was just wanting us all to be together um but it I believe it is pleasing to the Lord to to have it in the evening the time it should be and and to to make it to to have as many make it as they can now if someone really really wants to come and you want to ride well between brother Mark and I we got a couple Brothers brother Ron he lifted his hand he's willing to come pick anybody up so if you want to be here and but you can't you want to ride we can make that happen amen um communion is important so I just wanted to share my heart why we changed it and also it's going to give us this service here to to refresh and some really needs to to to to learn about communion to be honest with you so we're we want to do that today before we begin reading here in Matthew chapter 27 let's look to God In Prayer it just has his grace upon this service today our heavenly father Lord we're grateful for your love for us for what you did for us at Calvary and bringing us into fellowship with you and this morning Lord as we enter into the scriptures many things can be said about communion and Lord we're asking that you would guide our minds and our lips and that you'd help us to speak those things which you would have for us in this hour we pray that you break the bread of life to us we pray that you give us understanding a greater understanding Lord concerning the subject of communion we pray Lord that there would you take away any questions and doubts and confusions and whether somebody's worthy or not to take it and and Lord that you would just prepare our hearts for taking communion lord it's our desire some motive behind this please come now as we commit the furtherance of the service in your hand and and pray now that you give us revelation of your precious word for we Praise You In Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen so here we're going to start with verse 25 of Matthew 27. and this is just uh going through the actual crucifixion uh a a Calvary and and because this is what communion is all about sorry what verse 25 then answered all the people and said his blood be upon us and upon our children and then they released Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers imagine this put yourself right there and they stripped him they put him on a Scarlet robe on him and when they had plated a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and read in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews and they spit on them took a read and smold him on the head and after that they had mocked him and took the robe off from him and put his own Remnant on him and led him away to crucify him verse that's dropped down to verse 45. now the sixth hour now from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour is very similar to one in Egypt now and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli Lama Sabah tatini and I'm sorry can I not pronounce it that is to say my God my God why has Thou forsaken mean verse 40 Jesus when he had cried again with a love voice yielded up the Holy Ghost amen God bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message remembering Calvary remembering Calvary and for a subject entering into fellowship with the sufferings of Christ entering in to fellowship with the sufferings of Christ now we want to keep it simple today we want to stay with the word we we do not believe like some Churches believe when they take the bread they think it turns into the literal Body of Christ and it does not we want to keep it simple stay with the word it is a representation of Christ being broken on our behalf that we might uh that we would that door would be open that the Holy Ghost could come into our soul now we probably should have heard some more amens on that but hopefully as we go on through the service we'll be able to see them communion takes place brother Brandon says when two parties are talking to one another we can't communicate with the TV we can't communicate with a radio but we can communicate on a telephone one with another face to face communion isn't when one person does all the talking right amen that's right well the Branham said in the message communion he said so really the real communion is the holy spirit speaking back when you ask him and he speaks back this is correct communion is being associated with something that's talking back to you in the message remembering the Lord Brother Brandon said then as we come to the table of the Lord the table of the Lord as I've explained it before is the taking of the bread we place the right thing in the wrong place it isn't the bread that matters it isn't the wine that matters that's just the kosher bread and the wine but the thing that is communion means to talk to and talking to him remembering him I think it's the most blessed time of the services see every hour of our life ought to be a communion A communion's continuing to quote a communion with the Lord is like an oasis in the desert it's like the spring underneath the pond it's a is when a traveler comes by he stops and drinks of the water until he quenches his thirst that's remembering the Lord amen God wants us to remember him in communion what he done for us it's not a one-sided ritual where we just come in and do this thing right right neither it is and about us asking the Lord for all the things that we want or that we need or that we desire but it's about our personal relationship with Christ [Music] amen God wants to have communion with us on the basis of his will for our lives that's what he wants communion to be for so we want to ask him where we're not pleasing him the way that we need to that that needs to be done because to whom much is given much is required you know we're so used and I say like this our flesh is so used to coming to church hearing the word and doing what you still want to do that's true that's called iniquity and they that name the name of the Lord let him depart from iniquity so we need to take the word of the Lord more serious amen we need to learn to wait upon the Lord now this communion is about what Christ did for us and the effect that it has on our personal lives in our relationship I'm going to give you the John Martin definition of communion communion is entering into fellowship with the sufferings of Christ that's what it really is and that's why it's it's such a a sobering moment if I was to ask and and just try to be as honest as you can in this statement with me I'm going to ask you a question what do you think about when I say or when you hear it's time we're going to have communion what's the first thing you think about huh coming together okay there's no wrong answer I just want to hear huh across okay under the Lord okay okay yes getting your heart right that is that is that's that's the first thing I think about I think about am I ready for communion because I just because he died for me and he's he's asked me to give my life to him and have I really done that with everything that's within me well communion brings us to that table and it calls us to evaluate ourselves in our relationship with Christ and I'm telling you when we take communion it should bring us closer to God and closer to one another that's what true communion does it's not a time we come together and have a ritual and just think oh yeah my relationship is okay with God it's just going to be a ritual and that's not it and I in my opinion I believe Calvary is the greatest pivoting point in the history of humanity amen yes sir brother Andrew brought us he brought us brought a point out to us how Lucifer it was right next to Jesus and watched every detail about Jesus so he knows all his characteristics and and knows exactly how to mimic everything right and he knows all all about him and I just believe he brought out some mighty great things but there were some things that were completely hid from Lucifer amen amen he never seen Jesus redeem anybody in heaven he never seen Jesus save anybody in heaven he never seen anybody he never seen Jesus heal anybody in heaven or restore anybody because it never happened in heaven so he couldn't see it right it took a Man created in God's Own image to Fall From Grace to be restored back into Fellowship again see Satan never seen how great God's mercy really was until until the understanding came of what Calvary was all about course it was hid from them at the beginning or else he wouldn't ever allowed it but after he starts seeing all these people change all sudden their nature that they were born with all sudden they weren't having that nature or anything their eyes came open that it was God coming back into human flesh again see Satan never seen how great a love wherewith he loved us and changed our lives communion is not just about remembering Calvary it's about entering into the fellowship with the sufferings of Christ at Calvary Paul said in Philippians 3 10 that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death see it is we've got to if we do not pick up our cross we do not deny ourselves you might as well kick out your religion because it's not Christianity Christianity is dying out to yourself that Christ may live inside of you so we've got to know Christ in The Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the Dead God not only wants us to remember the sufferings of Christ until he comes but he wants us to remember when we're in heaven because there will be scars on his hands for us to remember what he did see Calvary is the pivoting point of the of of of history of humanity everything pointed to it and our whole salvation is based on it and when we get to heaven we will be casting ours our crowns down we will be shouting Glory Glory Thou Art Worthy you paid the price that I could be here today it's all about Calvary personally we were all separated from God and he made a way back for us everything points to Calvary God displayed eternal life to mankind and Calvary he displayed it for God so loved the world that he gave it was the manifestation of God's love although the whole world was blind to it it's so so blind even his own disciples scattered what's going on that's why we should never give up if we don't understand something we don't understand doesn't make it not real does it not make it not true but what we got to do is learn to wait on the Lord amen everything points to Calvary Calvary was in the mind of God before there was ever a world First Peter 1 19 says that when we were redeemed we were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ as of the Lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world so see think about this this great attribute was in the mind of God before there was ever a world there was something in him that wanted to express his redeeming qualities How Great Is Our God Amen How great is our God it was first revealed or record it if I could say it in Genesis 3 15 that the seed of God would make such a Blow To The Head of Lucifer that nothing could stop God's seed from coming forth amen Satan took over the whole Earth but the seed of God is still going to come forth in Revelations 13 8 the Bible says all that dwelleth upon the Earth shall worship Him whose name are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear so this everything pointed to Calvary everything points to Calvary even Paul said for I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified that's where he put his mind and his thoughts Calvary is where he brought us back to him Calvary is now where he can say you are bought with a price you're not your own you belong to Christ amen we need to keep our minds more in Calvary on the price he paid on the suffering he surrendered himself to do Jesus said therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life for the Sheep if you would let's turn with me to um Isaiah chapter 53 just this great recording I think it Bears witness reading I don't know it's a familiar scripture Isaiah 53 just remembering Calvary look verse 1 who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plan and as a root out of the dry ground he have no form of comeliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him imagine that when we talk to one another you know when we meet somebody when we talk to somebody give her order at Tim Hortons and then we go up to the window and we're surprised that they look like that you know what I'm saying they got this voice like this but then you see him and they go whoa is that what I imagined it to be well Jesus don't want to appear as something That's mighty on the outside because he's not trying to attract our flesh our Flesh and Blood our flesh is not going to inherit the Kingdom it's that Soul that's inside so the inside of Christ is speaking to the inside of us there's a deep calling to the Deep amen he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with griefs and we hit him and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed enough I want you to put yourself in these scriptures surely he bore our Greeks and he carried ourselves yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted he was wounded for John Martin's transgressions he was bruised for her iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen how grateful we all to be all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own ways and the Lord had laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he didn't have any regrets and he didn't fight back and he didn't say you know you shouldn't be doing this his heart was on you he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter as the Sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from the Judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when thou shall make his soul see here it is his soul in offering for sin he shall see his seeds praise God he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand and he shall see the travail of his soul and and shall be satisfied by his knowledge and shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities amen therefore I divide him a portion amen I will divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he have poured out his soul unto death and and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made the intercession for the transgressors he divided himself for us we have a portion of God inside of us because of what he did at Calvary everything points to Calvary brother Brandon said in the message communion 57 he said that communion was held first way down in Egypt the first communion the children of Israel if you want to turn their Exodus chapter 12 we're going to read some scriptures there the children of Israel in the land of bondage we're to take a lamb slay it apply the blood eat it and this lamb was to be without blemish just like Jesus Christ was without blemish but you know his bride is going to be without blemish without spots and without blemish and I'll tell you it takes not just the covering of our sins for that but it takes the Life of Christ Living inside of human flesh again pressing towards that Mark you know I understand that we can only do so much living the life of a holy person I understand that but why do we limit God because of our unbelief why don't we just spend more time with God and say God would you fill me with more of you because I know you can live the life Lord why do we want to take Church such a a separate part from the life this is where we come to get life amen this is where we come to receive the revelation of Christ that we can take it out and live it because this is what communion is all about Exodus chapter 12 verse number 7 says and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side poles and the upper door pulse to the of the houses wherein they shall eat it notice they eat the lamb inside the house now what's inside your house is a soul and that is where you eat Christ amen that's where you receive the word that's where you come communion is in the soul not the flesh now your soul eats the lamb but the blood is applied on the outside so that the whole world can see the Life of Christ what's inside of your soul [Music] and that's why I made mention that you don't have to tell anybody you got the Holy Ghost it is on display for the whole world to see but if you're having to convince feeling you're having to convince I say this spend more time and ask God to fill your soul with more of the Holy Ghost because you can't help to Bubble it out it can't help to come out let's drop down to verse 10 and ye shall let nothing of it remain unto the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn it with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins gerd your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover in other words this is a serious situation we're leaving that Egypt we're leaving this world Amen we're going in a rapture amen it's the Lord's Passover Pride will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I when I notice who has to really see the blood when I see the blood I will pass over you God is demanding to see the Life of Christ all over us he's got to see it so it doesn't matter what we do in front of one another doesn't matter what we try to put peacock feathers on or actors certain way we've we've got to have that blood applied in the sight of God at all times I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be here it is then this day shall be unto you for a memorial not a ritual but a memorial that ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations and ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever forever now we can take any one of these and really dive into it but we we just have a lot of ground to cover so we're obviously we're missing saying certain things but I want to stand the subject brother Brian said the message questions and answers 59 it he cannot issue taking communion and turn around and say there's no need to take it he says you've got to do it it's an order forever with God so we've got to take communion we don't want to be in a spot where well you know I just not doing real good and I don't think I should take no you can't do that what you do if you do that you're separating yourself from God well brother John I don't want to take it and take it unworthily so so I can't take it know what you need to do is you need to get right and take communion that is not an excuse you're separating yourself from God Amen you separate yourself from God it's just the same thing when the blood's not applied you've got to apply that blood to your life you just got to the Lord's Passover is a very serious thing imagine each one of you having a firstborn is going to die if you didn't take and kill a lamb apply the blood and eat that lamb in in the house you ever put yourself in this position now every one of us was a firstborn every one of us was the first I don't care where you were born in category you were born a firstborn we all must take Christ The Life of Christ into our soul and let him change our nature into the Life of Christ or the death angel is is not going to pass over us God has provided a chance to pass over us we've got to take the blood we've got to take the the meat of God's word no matter what he speaks to us to me it's meat because Jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and when God speaks to you I don't care how small it is how great it is that's God's meat being given to you you must take it you must eat it amen [Music] Jesus said we must be born again or we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven that nature change has to come we must have a nature change it's not some intellectual understanding of Calvary right it's not some carnal ritual of communion we must receive the very Life of Christ into our nature and that life must be on display in order to escape the oncoming judgment amen brother Branham said many people take communion who will die and will not make it I just really don't care about what does that matter who we fake out who we're trying to impress we need the Life of Christ manifested that can only come from him living in our souls because here's the thing we all could get the Life of Christ anointing our flesh doing great marvelous things and obviously that isn't us that's Christ but that what doesn't mean it's ever going to change in nature are you with me so we're not looking to the outside some manifestations for a period of time and say I've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a nature change you're not selfish anymore it's not about you anymore you live for others you don't have respect to persons you don't you're not ill towards somebody we're talking about the very nature that's inside that's on display with what you do with your time see Satan has deceived a lot of people true with me if you would to John chapter 6. Jesus shared this message with Nicodemus and his disciples and the Jews that followed him this this great message that you need a nature change you must be born again and the only way we can do it is through Christ starting with verse 52 and the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat that was the question how can it be Nicodemus said how can I enter into my mother's womb again be born again so we need our spiritual thinking caps when we come to church then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say to you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you many will come to me in that day I want the Life of Christ I don't really care about anything I don't care why anybody looks at me thinks about me I don't mean it wrong but if I don't have that life in me nothing else matters who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and I will raise them up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eareth my flesh and drinketh my blood here it is dwelleth in me and I in him now do you see where the spirit of God could come upon somebody and anoint them to all get out and yet they not be in Christ now we know this is not some natural cannibalism right communion is not naturally eating the body and drinking the blood by some sort of thinking that is happening when you're doing it it's a representation of Christ being broken on our behalf that we could receive his Spirit into our soul and have the true communion because see God is a spirit and they that worship me must worship me not in your mind not carnally but in spirit and in truth that's the fellowship that he's looking for that's why we you know we can come to church a lot of times and just pop in and pop out nothing really goes on but I'm telling you true communion with the Lord is you've got to get in Fellowship he talks he talks you listen you talk back you respond yes God I will do what you tell me to do I'm having communion with you man Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit they are life the flesh profiteth nothing I say natural communion Prophet nothing it's just like getting baptized without any change in Direction in your heart you go down a sinner you come up a sinner it is the spirit that quickeneth amen the spirit that's why we need the spirit of the word now when you receive the spirit of Christ the word you're actually eating spiritually come to the house of God every time these doors are open to feed upon the word of God we have precious opportunities to commune with the word of God as as he speaks to us we respond back with a amen so be it in my life Lord amen eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and now I in him the only way that Christ could be in US is through his word The Living Word is the Holy Ghost are you with me right we can go to a seminary spend five years in the Seminary and know less about God than when we first went in there because when we first went in there there was a yearning God I want to know you when we come out oh we just think we're something we're further away John Chapter 14 verse 20. at that day John 14 20 at that day you shall know that I am in the father and you and me and I and you and he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them here it is the word becoming real to us he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him there's that life Judas saith unto him not ascariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and then not unto others Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me it's where the criteria starts right there he will keep my words and my father will love him and will come unto him and make our Abode with him communion starts with love we've got to love God you can't have a relationship with God without you loving God Amen amen God is not going to be some Tyrant that places his will Upon Our us when we really would rather just do what our flesh wants to do are you with me so that's what I'm saying we need to cultivate love yes things that build off of love we got to get perfect love we got to get to the place where we can love our enemies we got to build amen that ain't gonna happen some Christmas gift right it's a relationship it's we take service seriously when we come to the house of God when we pick up our Bible we we listen to the tapes we're interested in building a love relationship and then the manifestation will come yes Luke chapter 22 remembering Calvary Luke chapter 22. I don't often take a sip of water but I need water are you getting something out of this starting with verse 13 and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the Passover and when the hour was come he sat down and The Twelve Apostles with him and Jesus said unto them with now notice this with desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer the Lord's Passover here has to do with the sufferings of Christ at Calvary so true communion is entering into the fellowship with the sufferings of Christ no he tried telling them what's going to happen and they didn't want to hear it and a lot of times we come to church and we don't want to hear that part that part of suffering that part of laying down your life we want to hear something that's encouraging and that just picks us up I want that too I do it's natural but look if you want to have True Fellowship with Christ you've got to learn to die out to your will stall there is to it Christ surrendered his will for you he said father if it's possible let this cup pass from me but he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done he gave up his will that you could have fellowship with him and we've got to give up our will to have fellowship with him we just got to if we don't that's what makes us Unworthy of the blood of Christ verse 16 for I say unto you I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God look at this the Fulfillment happens in the Kingdom God still wants us to remember Calvary when we're up there I say up there you know what I mean in that other dimension that's 18 inches from us he wants us to remember he was committed to suffering amen amen and his bride will be the only ones that's committed to suffering because if we do not suffer with him we will not reign with him we've got to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings communion with him is remembering the great love that he has towards us that he was willing to suffer to have that fellowship with us this is what communion is verse 17 and he took the cup and he gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves now if I don't want to take this one because I drink out of it but I'm going to take this one and if I took this I opened it and gave each of you a part of this would any of you have something different than the other one it would all be the same Same Love Same Spirit same forgiveness this this stuff about well I don't need to do that or I don't have to do that or you don't know what they did to me you know what you're telling me you're not partaking of Christ because when you have the Holy Ghost you will do what the Holy Ghost does amen we're trying to be the Holy Ghost don't try to be the Holy Ghost say God fill me with you you will automatically forgive love lay down your life and be everything that Christ is because you you have partook by one Spirit we're all baptized into the body of Christ yes all right what verse we on here verse 18. for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until it the kingdom of God shall come and he took the bread and gave thanks and he break it he break it now this bread that he was breaking when he said take this is this is uh my body which is broken for you that piece of bread that he was breaking was not his body do you understand that it was not his body he didn't transfer him to that bread it was a representation of him and what was going to happen at Calvary that when you come together and you break bread and you take it that that you have a visualization a representation a memorial of what happened at Calvary um and he gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do and remember I'll tell you if if that bread that he broke was him yeah exactly where do we fit in just does it make Calvary what it really really is but we just want to keep it simple right stay with the word likewise also the cup after supper after supper see after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table so here he is having communion first and we find in Egypt in a mixed multitude and here it is communion the Passover and he's having it with somebody that's unworthy are you with me you're gonna have three types of Believers in every Church you're going to have some taking it that that shouldn't be taken it because they need to get their heart right first amen right you just can't do nothing about that but what we can do is encourage one another right we're a body Ministry we do not have to wait to come to the house of God to help somebody you know you're all disciples what do Disciples do they disciple amen we're all disciples we need to help one another we need to get our hands dirty and talk to one another and help one another become more what Christ wants them to be I believe that I believe that with all my heart so we're going to talk about preparing our hearts for communion just a little bit communion is sacred just like Calvary was sacred the brand said in the message desperations he says I believe that communion is one of the most solemn sacred sweetest worships that there is in a church service he says but there there were three things left the Lord's Supper baptism foot washing was the three orders that was left to the church God suffered and was broken for the whole world but the whole world is too proud too arrogant to disbelieving to receive it but to us he's precious he's beautiful we have a revelation of what Christ did for us he redeemed us that we could live eternally with him so I say this that we need to take communion seriously we do not want to take communion just because we're supposed to or just because we were baptized or just because Mom and Dad does we don't want to take communion with our lives and our attitudes being wrong I say to the children young believers we need to remember this if we're old enough to take communion we're old enough to suffer the consequences of not taking it right so we need to take it seriously one of the most disheartening things is is when how imagine a 20 year old coming to Christ he says he wants to give up the world get baptized and he gets baptized repentance rep gets baptized and then leaves Church that's such a sad thing to me what's different about that than a a younger child doing the same thing but his heart isn't here at church come on come on parents we have a responsibility we do now when they reach that age when they're going to make their own decision that's different but until that age we have a re Brothers says you are the Holy Ghost to them until they get the Holy Ghost so they need to be taught all serious communion as well brother Brian said the message key to the door he said so communion is for Christians that's born again by the spirit of God foreign again does not necessarily mean now that you've got the Holy Ghost well this is getting rich he says now remember many now many teach that so the new birth there's the beginning and then there's a growth and we've been taught about the tutor uh uh be in the Holy Spirit when you finally get to the place where he can turn to the father and say he is ready now to step into his position even though he was a a son from the beginning he's not able to be in that position so there's like a growth and so I say to you that have repented you that have been baptized and you're still wondering why things are going on the what what's going on in your life you need to press into Christ that is your answer there is no other answer do not wait and do the same thing because if you do you always do what you've always done you're always going to get what you always got you've got to press in more to Christ that's what brings the results to a to a Christian pressing in now if you're planning on taking communion your relationship with Christ the word needs to be in order that's between you and Christ like if you've got a distant relationship between you and God there's hardly any I think you need to spend more time to your my sheep hear my voice and they follow me because he doesn't want us coming up and haphazardly taking communion when we don't really even think about what he the price he paid for us right it wasn't so we could just go live the life of Riley he wants our life turned around it didn't stop a year after we got baptized he still wants it turned around more and I know why this this is not a enjoyable but but I don't ever believe that this ministry was for the mate believer I never believed that we've got to come out of unbelief brother Brian preached a message that God's God calls for a separation from all unbelief and we've got to come out of of the things that we get sucked into see we all get sucked into them sometimes I see too much playing around in the church too much getting up and leaving I can guarantee this statement if Jesus Christ was here literally in the flesh you would not get up and leave the church you would be so glued to what he's saying but your very actions prove that you don't believe Christ is here and that he has an order that he expects respect you know it is when you're talking to somebody imagine if you're talking to somebody I'm going to talk to this brother Ben because Brother Joseph then so I'm always talking to you and I'm talking to you my precious brother and we're having a good time fellowship and also and I just now what is he going to think what's he gonna think it won't be any oh that's great keep walking that's right and do you think Jesus says yeah keep walking keep going just leave here keep going go do now I understand that there are times that we have to leave I understand that but there's so many times we don't have to that we ain't trying hard enough to get ready and prepared for the service so we don't have to walk out two times during the worship come on we're not taking Church the way God intended it to be no if you don't want to take communion because well I'll just say this you don't want to be taking communion if you're gossiping if you don't mind gossiping you don't want to take communion if it don't bother you to say negative things if it doesn't bother you to miss church miss your post of Duty if it doesn't bother you to ignore your responsibilities if it doesn't bother you to have respect to persons and to love others more than others it doesn't bother you to hold back your ties and your offerings and not you know that's between me and God brother you don't want to be taking communion like that brother Branham talked about a poor believer he could hardly make at the church he just he had to call a cab to come and get him we would probably call them Ubers and as he could he didn't have much money and he didn't have a vehicle but when communion came for church he really really wanted to make sure he made it for that when he's walking out to get in his car and his neighbor stops by and says hey where are you going he says oh I'm going to church to take communion to take the bread and the wine and his neighbor I'm just going to pick it up right here in the testimony of a true witness he said oh I had some too said I had a pan full of biscuits and a quart of whiskey and on his table right immediately he fell into a heart attack they were looking for him to go at any minute he said don't be ear religious irreligious don't be irrelevant I think that's what he meant to say the first time don't be irrelevant see respect the word of the Lord for we don't know what minute we're going to be called on to answer back to God so we need to be serious about communion serious about a relationship communion has everything to do with your personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen you can't be ill towards people I just say it like this if you have something all you got to do is make it right just make it right move forward you must discern that the people that you have a problem with could very well still be the Lord's body can you believe that is that really even possible well you got problems you could have kicked them out you might as well kick yourself out we must discern the Lord's body now I know the Lord's body is the word but we've also been taught that the Lord's body is inside his bride his people so communion has everything to do with our relationship with Christ you're pressing in with all of your heart now to love one another you're not just saying okay well I don't got nothing ill against anybody I guess I could go no you're actually wanting to do what the word tells you to do what you've been taught with what brother Brandon said lay everything aside until you get perfect love you're actually doing that brother John you're really raising the bar standard what to whom much is given much is required why is it just you know up for the the pastor that he has to well I'll tell you I'll be the first to tell you I am not I am not worthy I don't believe any of us are worthy I think his blood makes us worthy to take communion amen amen the Bible says if a righteous man's fall seven times seven times he gets back up you can't just stay down 49 times and get up when it's communion right God is looking for I don't know who I was talking to I don't know who it was I don't even want to think about it right now but really it's pretty easy to do about anything I think for God if you've got to help somebody you gotta make something right you can do it you got to go to you can do it you can go to church but you know what's hard is faithfulness to do it over and over and over and over and be faithful that is hard to do because you no longer can muster up the energy to do it once or twice or three times like you may be able to turn your cheek one or two times if somebody hit you what if they keep doing it come on and be faithful to love them anyways see faithfulness is a very hard thing but God has called all of us to be faithful communion has everything to do with that striving to please the Lord You're sincerely trying to obey every word of God because his words are spirit and their life to you now when your heart is in the right condition I say you're ready to move forward with taking communion can you say Amen we should have had a lot more amens on that we just don't want to take communion haphazardly because we'll just make our life worse I don't know it just God don't want it and it's up to him he's able to make all grace abound to us he's able to withhold it so we we are the ones that deceive ourselves by not obeying the word we are the ones that bring con damnation to ourselves so we're in control of this situation like I said before if you don't take communion you're disconnecting yourself from God you're disconnecting yourself from Calvary you're showing that there's something wrong with your relationship with Christ if you don't take communion we don't want to separate do we I say just take care of it move forward take care of it that should be much easier than being disconnected from God it's if I could say communion is like a showdown for the lukewarm believer he's got to get things right and if he doesn't then it's just showing everybody come on I believe God's blood can take care of any situation I believe he's capable of putting us all together United under Christ his blood can do it but we've got to confess we've got to say Lord I'm sorry help me with this I'm putting it I will strive to be all that you'd have me be okay First Corinthians chapter 11. my my and I'm going to try I will I will by the grace of God with his help and with this this scriptures here in First Corinthians chapter 11 start with verse 17. now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not that you come together not for the better but for the worse have you ever been in church and either either I'll just take it home first well have you ever been to church and heard somebody say Amen with a pitchfork all right oh yeah that was for hope they got it aim how many times have we been guilty of using a pitchfork that's not for the better it's one thing to have a burden for somebody to care about somebody it's another thing to use God's house to Pitchfork the word unto somebody so I think we should just say Amen so be it Lord I want to do it I want to do it Lord I want to live your word for first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it so division sets you out of the boundaries of communion I just want to make that clear get rid of Divisions and I'll say it's real easy get rid of them out of your heart and and wise up to not think the thoughts that Satan would give you negative about somebody else when you get a thought about somebody get on your knees and say God may you move in this brother sister's behalf may you bless them with such a blessing that they be all that you would have them to be and forget about trying to dissect how bad and wrong they are amen that never brings anything out of you that's of Christ any kind of division puts us outside of true communion because communion Calvary brought us into Fellowship Calvary is what broke down the middle wall of tradition Calvary is what brought us together and who are we to take communion with some of the separation with another person for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be manifest among you when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lord's supper now I can imagine some people would have had a problem with that scripture because when they had the first communion they were having suffer and Jesus just right there before it was over took bread and broke it and so here he was people that knew about really what happened with the Lord's Passover could have been saying it's okay to eat to come to church and eat and have communion at the same time because Jesus did he's our example but you know Paul was setting things in order and I'll tell you why Paul did that I believe I don't know why but you know what I think what happens is there's too much mixing see Jesus had the attention of his disciples King we're not doing dinner right now we're going to talk about something different but sometimes when you just blend them together one loses how real important it is so Paul was just setting order in the church we're not going to come together and eat now like they did we're gonna just you're gonna eat eat at home we're coming together for the Lord's Supper all right for in eating every one of you taketh before another his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken what have you in a house has he eat and drink in despise ye the Church of God and shame and shame them that have not what shall I say to you shall I praise you for this I do not Praise You For This for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me which part of Jesus do you want to remember here the part which was broken for you that's the part that he wants you to remember until he comes and then it'll I believe he'll still want us to remember what he did for him and I believe we should be taking communion more often the thing is I don't want to take communion too often to where it doesn't really become real to us common so it was up all of us got to work together for that right and the same manner also he took the copy of what he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament of my blood this do this Duty as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me is all about him suffering for you to be where you're at today to be where you're at today and to be where you're going to be before he returns it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know it when he shall appear we shall be like him we shall see him as he is we're going to be just like him verse 26 for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes beautiful wherefore what whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord and here it is but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup we've got to examine ourselves and we're just going to take a few days now and just really really examine I don't I don't mean it wrong I don't want you to examine one another I don't I want you to examine yourself but what you are allowed to do and should do is pray one for another for he that he is a drinketh and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sick among you and many sleep now there has been a lot of stuff that has gone on a lot of sickness a lot of covet a lot of stuff that has happened and there's been a lot of people that are sick a lot of people that have been weak you got to remember this was spoken way before Colvin right right before all that but I say this to you look at your life do you feel like you're weak in the Lord do you feel like there's some sickness whether it's spiritual whether it's physical that there's just too much and you just can't gain the victory this is part of an examination you want to take this to heart you don't want to say well you know what I'm not sick today so I must be doing okay in the Lord that is not nothing to do with it right I want I want us to enter into this I believe the Lord would be pleased if we would do this here it is for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should be that we should not be condemned with the world in other words whatever the Lord says we just say Amen to it move forward we're for my brother and when you come together to eat Terry one for another pray for one another care about one another you know you've examined yourself you've made the decision I'm going to church I'm going to have communion and now you come and you pray one for another and if any man hunger that I mean at home that he may come not together unto condemnation and the rest I will set in order when I come amen don't you wish Paul could come and just set things in order I wish we could have Paul Come set things in order but you know we got the word we got a five-fold Ministry [Music] all we got to do is believe it was Paul is the word of God amen amen let's Stand Together thank you communion will bring us closer together amen let's go to the Lord in prayer and then we'll we'll worship Him amen our heavenly father we thank you for your precious word we thank you for the truth that you've brought to us in this age through your prophet we thank you for the men of God that have brought the truth to us Lord we're Unworthy of your truth we're unworthy that you would reveal yourself and your will to our lives Lord there's been many times that we've just lost lost track of calvary and just moving on to the things that we want to move on to and Lord somebody we're sorry for where we have come short of those things we pray father that you would help us your word says that when the Holy Spirit Will Come elitist in God it's all truth and bring all things to our remembrance and I pray that you would always remind us Lord of calvary how you suffered for us you bled you were broken your blood was spilled for us personally we don't know how others feel but it means everything to us Lord and we want our lives to commune to to represent that we're communing with you that we've received the engrafted word we've received your spirit and Lord we're living out the very word of God to our our vessels on display Lord we pray that as we approach this communion service this next Wednesday if it would be your will Lord we just pray not only for that service but the service is to come that we would just be prepared father and that you would help us to see anything that we're not quite seen real well Lord bring it to our attention help us to to deal with things Lord to commune with you back and forth that we may take communion as as you stated as a as a a memorial to remember all that you did to make up for our shortcomings being separated from you we love you we commit ourselves to you now Lord we pray these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen amen can you say thank you Jesus amen thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me whole thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free thank you thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me whole thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free one more time let's sing it oh thank you Lord for saving my soul [Music] me whole thing thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free amen amen let's just thank the Lord thank you Jesus thank you for Calvary Lord thank you Lord God hallelujah hallelujah we're in debt to you Lord praise you Jesus thank you for Calvary Lord thank you for dying for thank you for suffering for us Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen let's sing at Calvary amen amen I know we had sung that not too long ago but how many remembers those years of vanity cried years I spent in vanity and pride carry not my Lord was crucified no we not it was for me he died on Mercy there was great and Grace was free hard and there was multiplied to me there my burden so far
