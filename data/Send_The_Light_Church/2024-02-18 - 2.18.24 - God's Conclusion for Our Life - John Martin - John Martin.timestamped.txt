[38:09] Ecclesiastes we know that uh Solomon was
[38:14] a man we he was a great man of wisdom
[38:17] and he wanted
[38:18] wisdom and I love his motive for wanting
[38:21] wisdom it wasn't that he could gain for
[38:24] his own but that he might be able to do
[38:26] the
[38:27] the job that God had given him amen the
[38:30] very possible best he and he he felt
[38:33] that
[38:34] insufficiency and
[38:36] so God uh blessed him as you know God
[38:40] gave him wisdom and gave him a lot more
[38:42] and he said his heart to know everything
[38:43] that was under the sun you name it he
[38:46] wanted to learn it he increased with
[38:49] knowledge but when he got all done he
[38:52] said vanity of vanities all is Vanity
[38:55] amen said what profit have a man of all
[38:58] his labors which he have taken Under the
[39:00] Sun Solomon learned that history
[39:03] repeated itself and he could get nothing
[39:06] from all his labors he wasn't taking it
[39:08] with
[39:10] him he even said that he that increaseth
[39:12] in knowledge increased in sorrow so when
[39:15] he sat back after seeking the very best
[39:19] that he could to
[39:22] understand it was all vanity amen I like
[39:26] to start here in Ecclesiastes 12:9 with
[39:29] this in mind and further by these my son
[39:32] be
[39:37] astonished oh verse nine I'm sorry and
[39:39] moreover because the preacher was wise
[39:43] he still taught the people knowledge
[39:46] yeah he gave good heed and sought out
[39:48] and set in order many
[39:50] Proverbs the preacher sought to find out
[39:53] acceptable words that which was written
[39:55] was upright even words of truth the
[39:58] words of the wise are as Golds As Nails
[40:01] fastened by the matter by masters of
[40:04] assembly which are given from one
[40:06] Shepherd and further by these my son be
[40:10] astonished of making many books there's
[40:12] no end in and much and much study is
[40:16] weariness of the flesh Amen Let Us hear
[40:19] the conclusion of the whole matter fear
[40:23] God and keep his Commandments amen for
[40:26] this is the whole duty of man amen for
[40:30] God shall bring every work into judgment
[40:33] and every secret thing uh whether it be
[40:36] good or whether it be evil amen God
[40:38] bless you you may be seated this morning
[40:40] we want to entitle this message God's
[40:43] conclusion for our
[40:45] lives amen God's conclusion for our
[40:47] lives and we want to just have a little
[40:49] introduction to the fear of the Lord it
[40:52] it's it'd be hard you could do a study
[40:54] and actually a number of different
[40:56] things that that we're going to go into
[40:57] today but we want to just try to focus
[41:02] on the fear of the Lord
[41:05] amen
[41:07] amen I I I'll say this I believe that
[41:11] every one of us could benefit more in
[41:13] our life if we had more of the fear of
[41:15] the
[41:16] Lord am and I believe we would be able
[41:19] to accomplish the will of God more for
[41:21] our lives if we had it right before we
[41:24] get into I want to talk about there's
[41:28] two types of
[41:30] fear one is the fear of
[41:32] torment and then the other is like the
[41:35] fear of reverence
[41:37] amen now these two fears come from two
[41:41] different
[41:42] Spirits brother Bram said the message
[41:45] Serv we would see Jesus he said there's
[41:47] only two Spirits One Believes and the
[41:50] other does not
[41:52] believe now James 2:19 says the devil's
[41:56] believe and tremble right so it's a
[42:00] different type of belief amen the Devils
[42:03] they they they shudder they quiver they
[42:06] shake like a leaf
[42:08] involuntarily as a result of their
[42:12] anxiety because they know what's coming
[42:15] amen but they've never believed with a
[42:18] submission to the word and I tell you
[42:20] that's how a lot of Believers are they
[42:21] believe there's a God they believe the
[42:23] word is true but they won't submit to it
[42:25] there's no than the devil's
[42:28] believes we know the devil deceiveth the
[42:30] whole
[42:32] world now the
[42:34] fear uh that is torment let me just say
[42:37] it like this I don't want to give the
[42:40] devil any credit for his ability to
[42:43] scare people that's right I want to say
[42:46] this fear of Torment is nothing but
[42:48] afflicting thoughts from the
[42:50] devil I want to keep it real simple this
[42:52] is the John Martin definition of where
[42:55] fear starts it is the afflicting
[42:57] thoughts from the devil that's all they
[42:59] are how many times have we heard there's
[43:01] nothing to fear than fear itself and I
[43:03] thought boy I don't want to fear fear I
[43:05] don't want to fear fear and fear is what
[43:08] but fear if fear is just an afflicting
[43:11] thought there's nothing to worry
[43:15] about it the devil can't hurt
[43:18] you afflicting thoughts can't hurt you
[43:22] unless you listen to them unless you
[43:25] yield to them
[43:26] right fact the Bible says perfect love
[43:30] cast out all fear
[43:32] righten perfect love for God perfect
[43:34] love in God will actually cast out those
[43:40] thoughts now when we yield to these
[43:43] afflicting thoughts of the devil they
[43:45] will manipulate this is a lot what we
[43:48] feel what happens and we wonder why we
[43:52] fear but these thoughts will manipulate
[43:55] intense in unbearable feelings in us
[43:58] that causes emotional and often times
[44:03] physical
[44:05] sufferings I'm telling you the truth
[44:09] amen look at Stephen for a second
[44:12] Stephen when they begin to Stone
[44:18] him of
[44:20] course he had a lot of afflicting
[44:22] thoughts don't you think Stones being
[44:25] stoned
[44:27] upon
[44:28] you and I believe that the
[44:32] thoughts that he had really brought
[44:35] about or or I shall say this trying to
[44:37] bring about some unbearable feelings
[44:41] because anybody throws a rock at you in
[44:45] an aspect to kill you because that's
[44:47] what they were doing they're trying to
[44:48] Stone him right but there was something
[44:52] inside of Stephen it was the love of God
[44:55] yes right that he could literally say at
[44:58] the time of going through his trial
[45:00] father forgive them for they know not
[45:03] what they
[45:05] do and I believe that love just cast out
[45:09] the devil and all that he was trying to
[45:11] give him the Bible says that his his
[45:14] countenance shine like an
[45:17] angel look at Paul and Silas when they
[45:19] were inside a prison feeling that where
[45:22] is God right you can see all the
[45:25] thoughts that could come to him but they
[45:28] would not yield themselves to those
[45:31] afflicting
[45:34] thoughts and if you don't yield to the
[45:36] afflicting thoughts that means the devil
[45:38] can't manipulate your feelings and your
[45:41] emotions to believe things that do not
[45:43] exist that's where you cast down all
[45:46] imagination and everything that exalteth
[45:48] itself against Christ amen they began to
[45:51] sing and worship and God was pleased
[45:54] with their faith amen
[45:56] amen now after the devil manipulates us
[45:58] into a state of emotional or physical
[46:02] sufferings this is what triggers
[46:05] feelings inside of us right a whole host
[46:09] of problems yes we can get angry we can
[46:13] get violent we can start threatening we
[46:16] can feel lonely we can say things and do
[46:18] things that we really don't mean all
[46:22] because we've a these emotions are real
[46:26] inside of us these feelings are real
[46:28] inside of us and then that same fear
[46:30] that attacks us gets on us and we begin
[46:32] to express yes the the the result of the
[46:36] fear that comes from torment
[46:41] amen the spirit of the
[46:44] devil his job is to torment us yeah
[46:48] that's what the devil means that mean
[46:49] he's a
[46:52] tormenter
[46:54] now the devil can't can't do nothing to
[46:57] us but if he can get us to believe his
[46:59] afflicting thoughts his lies then he
[47:02] will manipulate us amen I want you to
[47:05] remember this statement when we yield to
[47:07] the fear of manipulation that same
[47:10] spirit of fear on us will now begin to
[47:13] manipulate others yes we'll start
[47:16] getting angry at others we'll start
[47:18] pushing we'll start bullying people
[47:20] around we'll start saying things because
[47:22] we're being op we're operating from a
[47:26] spirit of fear we don't even realize
[47:28] [Music]
[47:32] it now God's nature never wants us to
[47:36] fear him like that that's right
[47:42] right he doesn't give us afflicting
[47:45] thoughts that cause us to have
[47:47] overwhelming feelings of Stress and
[47:49] Anxiety that does not come from God Amen
[47:53] God is not a manipulator he's a a
[47:57] gentleman God is a god of love amen the
[48:01] attributes that God has always has been
[48:04] he's wanted to express himself as a
[48:07] savior that ain't
[48:09] manipulative as a redeemer as a Healer
[48:12] these are these are uh uh if I could say
[48:15] it like these these are attributes that
[48:17] want to help not afflict us Amen to
[48:21] comfort us to shelter us to to be our
[48:23] refuge to be our provider to be one that
[48:26] is merciful and gracious to he wanted to
[48:29] express those things to us all stemming
[48:32] from his love and the love of God will
[48:35] cast out fear
[48:38] amen now the Bible tells us that the
[48:41] same God of love is also a consuming
[48:44] fire and I just try to bring a balance
[48:46] to
[48:47] this that the god that did create us he
[48:51] created us for himself he did not create
[48:54] us so we could do whatever we wanted to
[48:56] do amen the Bible says that vengeance is
[49:00] mine sayith the Lord Vengeance belongs
[49:02] to God
[49:04] Amen and that we all have to give an
[49:07] account to God one day right the Bible
[49:09] says every knee shall bow every tongue
[49:10] shall confess that Jesus Christ really
[49:14] is
[49:16] God Jesus said in John 1248 he that
[49:20] rejecteth me and receiveth not my words
[49:22] have one that judgeth him the word that
[49:26] I have spoken the same shall judge him
[49:28] in the last day so look th this does
[49:31] bring about I need to be paying
[49:35] attention Amen to God
[49:39] Amen now if we don't yield our life we
[49:43] don't yield the life that God has given
[49:45] us back to God here on this Earth then
[49:49] we're going to end up in the same place
[49:52] the devil
[49:53] goes that's right amen that that that
[49:57] just that's just saying like we're all
[50:00] heading to Hell amen unless we get
[50:05] saved and we
[50:07] know that hell was created for the devil
[50:10] and his angels right but remember every
[50:14] seed brings forth of its own kind amen
[50:18] and if we choose to disbelieve like the
[50:21] devil's disbelieve or we choose to
[50:23] believe only like the devil's
[50:26] believe then we end up in the same place
[50:30] Jesus said in Matthew 10:27 what I tell
[50:33] you in darkness that speak in light what
[50:37] you hear in the air that preach ye on
[50:39] the housetops and fear not them which
[50:42] kill the body but are not able to kill
[50:45] the
[50:46] soul but rather fear him that is able to
[50:49] destroy both soul and Body in
[50:53] Hell amen
[50:56] now the creator of all life is the god
[50:58] of of love yet his eyes the Bible tells
[51:03] us are as a flame of
[51:06] fire his feet as unto fine brass that
[51:10] burned in a furnace and his voice is as
[51:13] the sound of many Waters and out of his
[51:15] mouth went a two-edged sword so we do
[51:18] know that God is a God of Justice he's a
[51:22] god of Truth there is only one right
[51:25] there is not Mayes right it's right or
[51:29] wrong amen the devil wants us to make
[51:32] Mayes the devil wants us to question
[51:35] well maybe I shouldn't be a boy maybe I
[51:38] shouldn't be a girl maybe I should cut
[51:40] my hair maybe I that is just the devil
[51:43] that you can't find that in the
[51:48] word if you really want to know who God
[51:51] is read the Bible the word you'll know
[51:54] exactly who God God is
[51:58] amen 2 Corinthians 5:10 says for we must
[52:02] all appear before the Judgment seat of
[52:04] Christ yes that every one of you may
[52:07] receive the things done in his body
[52:09] according to it to that he have done
[52:12] whether it be good or bad knowing
[52:13] therefore look at this the terror of the
[52:17] lord we persuade
[52:20] men but we are made manifest unto God
[52:23] and I trust also are made manif EST in
[52:25] your
[52:27] conscience so there is a part of God
[52:29] that's
[52:33] real but it isn't like the terror that
[52:36] we would like
[52:38] see you know if we watched a horror
[52:42] film God is not like that what that
[52:45] really means is God is
[52:47] real there is a realness to God and that
[52:51] we didn't create our
[52:54] bodies
[52:56] I don't I don't I don't want to be you
[52:58] know maybe our mom and dad got together
[53:00] and they had sex but I'll tell you Life
[53:02] comes from God Amen that's right amen
[53:05] right amen and we we we're not going to
[53:08] give account to Mom and Dad on the other
[53:10] side we're going to give account to
[53:13] God and and that's what we must
[53:17] remember as we think about the fear of
[53:20] the Lord
[53:21] today Hebrews 12:2 8
[53:26] says wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[53:29] which cannot be moved let us have Grace
[53:32] whereby we may serve God
[53:36] acceptably and how do you serve him
[53:38] acceptably you got to have reverence and
[53:41] you got to have Godly fear
[53:44] yes for our God is a consuming
[53:49] fire he he you know brother brandham
[53:52] taught us about church order yeah and
[53:54] how things need to be you know we have
[53:58] these ideas that we can just act any old
[54:01] way want nothing really matters well yes
[54:03] it does matter it may not matter to you
[54:05] and it may not matter to the devil who's
[54:07] speaking to you but it does matter amen
[54:12] amen I've seen Believers serve God with
[54:16] all sorts of ungodly
[54:19] attitudes not caring what they say or
[54:22] who they say it to condemning judging
[54:27] falsely accusing
[54:29] others walking to church hoty arrogant
[54:34] he highminded proud boasting about
[54:37] things amen
[54:40] unthankful don't want to worship don't
[54:42] want to
[54:43] pray lovers of their own
[54:48] selves
[54:51] unthankful upset
[54:54] mad
[54:56] Fierce
[54:58] unruly
[55:00] uncaring without reverence and without
[55:03] respect to the word of God amen amen
[55:07] true operating under the spirit of
[55:10] torment and don't even know
[55:15] it getting up during the preaching of
[55:18] the word of God and think it doesn't
[55:21] bring a disrespect to God Amen it only
[55:25] proves that you're you think you're
[55:26] listening to some man when yet God is
[55:30] trying to speak to you he chose the
[55:32] foolishness of preaching to speak to
[55:36] us Believers getting satisfied with just
[55:38] a form of
[55:43] godliness but the life denies the power
[55:46] of the Holy Ghost living the word out
[55:50] we've got to grow up in the
[55:52] word we've got to start manifesting this
[55:55] this word and we're running out of
[55:58] time teach us Lord to number our days it
[56:02] is what brings the fear of the Lord to
[56:04] our
[56:05] lives the Bri said in the message
[56:08] influence he says you've got to give
[56:10] your all to God right your reverence
[56:14] your respect your everything that you
[56:17] are just be
[56:19] nothing amen just see how little you are
[56:24] and that's what God wants us to do and
[56:27] that's real humility that's the way the
[56:29] seraphim are in his presence you
[56:32] see with their faces in reverence
[56:34] covered their feet in
[56:37] humility I say we must serve God
[56:41] acceptably amen with more reverence with
[56:45] more Godly fear right amen we need to
[56:48] stop listening to the devil and thinking
[56:50] that we're okay because there's somebody
[56:52] a little bit worse than us amen I'll
[56:55] tell you what that means with reverence
[56:56] in Godly fear it means with
[56:59] caution it means with
[57:01] modesty and it means with
[57:05] shamefacedness you know nowadays you
[57:07] can't find a a sister or a brother who
[57:10] feels that
[57:12] way I'm sorry amen but it's so true
[57:16] everybody uh it just seems
[57:19] that God isn't that real to people I see
[57:22] when you I'll tell you what caught my
[57:24] attention when I was in uh brother
[57:26] Johnson church and I was very young in
[57:28] the Lord very young
[57:30] person coming out of a a Catholic
[57:37] church we had to focus more on just the
[57:41] things that they told you to do not even
[57:43] knowing a relationship with God and just
[57:47] spending a few services in brother
[57:49] Johnson's church and seeing a
[57:53] sister her love life of how she
[57:55] conducted herself brought such a
[58:00] Renown uh
[58:02] identification of the realness of God
[58:05] manifested never said a word there was
[58:08] no preaching but the life that she lived
[58:12] I said there has to be something about
[58:15] this praise the
[58:17] Lord I believe we need to be an all of
[58:21] God
[58:22] Amen to live that kind
[58:26] life but not just of God but understand
[58:31] of his
[58:32] word we can all say oh yeah I'm an awe
[58:35] at God look at that Sunset look at that
[58:37] mountain look at that water look at
[58:39] those animals God is
[58:41] awesome but can we look at the word of
[58:44] God the message of the hour and be in
[58:47] all amen because that is that's what we
[58:50] that's what this is God amen amen that
[58:55] is God's creation the Bible talks about
[58:57] those that worship the creation more
[59:00] than the Creator it was this word that
[59:02] created those mountains and those
[59:04] animals in that
[59:09] sea we need to be in awe of obeying the
[59:14] word in everything that we're doing
[59:19] presently presently it's really
[59:23] important
[59:25] the fear of God wants us to have the
[59:27] fear that is generated from
[59:31] him not the
[59:35] devil B said the message sin of unbelief
[59:38] he said that there's only two spirits
[59:41] that control a
[59:45] man and you
[59:48] think and man can literally think that
[59:52] he's not controlled by either but he's
[59:53] in control himself
[59:55] that's how deceptive the devil is he
[59:58] said there's only two spirits that
[1:00:00] control man they're either his faith or
[1:00:03] unbelief and each of us tonight is
[1:00:06] possessed with one or the other of those
[1:00:08] Spirits
[1:00:10] amen now we know faith comes from
[1:00:13] God it's a faith that worketh by love
[1:00:17] right he created everything through
[1:00:20] faith amen and fear and unbelief come
[1:00:23] from the Devil
[1:00:26] Satan perverts everything through
[1:00:31] unbelief Jesus said in Revelations 218 I
[1:00:34] just going to quote it the fear and the
[1:00:37] unbelieving shall have their part in the
[1:00:39] Lake of Fire which uh uh with the lake
[1:00:42] which burneth with fire and brimstone
[1:00:45] which is the second death so the fearful
[1:00:47] and the unbelieving same place because
[1:00:50] it's the same Spirit motivated by the
[1:00:55] fear of the devil
[1:01:00] torment you you see all these people you
[1:01:03] know no fear their hats are on and you
[1:01:06] know they're just whistling the
[1:01:07] graveyard they're getting their mind on
[1:01:09] something else but as long as I don't
[1:01:11] have to think about what's going to
[1:01:12] happen that I got a give an account I
[1:01:14] can just do what I want be what I want
[1:01:16] act how I
[1:01:17] want I believe God is ashamed of us
[1:01:20] sometimes the way we act amen amen amen
[1:01:24] and then we just keep going on and
[1:01:25] thinking that it's okay it's not okay
[1:01:28] the bride will come under subjection to
[1:01:30] the word but the foolish virgin will not
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:36] amen God hasn't sent us
[1:01:39] here to minister a good message to the
[1:01:42] foolish virgin amen I don't believe that
[1:01:49] amen it's not my
[1:01:53] calling

[1:02:07] doing how can you stand in the presence
[1:02:10] of God with that demeanor am that's
[1:02:13] right it shows that you're not walking
[1:02:16] in his presence just because you're
[1:02:17] trying to act like
[1:02:22] something the fear of the Lord
[1:02:25] the fear that God wants us to have is
[1:02:28] reverence and respect that is generated
[1:02:32] from
[1:02:37] him what do you mean is generated from
[1:02:40] him what do you mean by that hey just
[1:02:43] read in the book of Isaiah when Isaiah
[1:02:46] went into the
[1:02:48] temple he didn't see a bunch of carrying
[1:02:51] on God's presence demand Ed respect
[1:02:56] am and all the Heavenly Host was
[1:03:00] reverencing God Almighty
[1:03:03] amen and when we're not in that that
[1:03:07] frame we need to get there amen fear God
[1:03:11] and keep his Commandments yes in other
[1:03:14] words reverence God and respect his word

[1:03:24] things well that's fine but it's the
[1:03:26] whole Duty amen that's what we've been
[1:03:28] created for right that's
[1:03:31] right we don't want to just stand for
[1:03:33] the reading of the
[1:03:35] word we want to stand for the
[1:03:37] manifestation of the word amen amen the
[1:03:41] whole duty of man our whole duty is to
[1:03:44] reverence God to respect him enough to
[1:03:47] stay within the guidelines of this
[1:03:51] book you want to read other books that's
[1:03:53] fine you want to listen to other things

[1:04:08] Vanity amen now how many can
[1:04:13] say that

[1:04:18] said a lot of bad things in your life
[1:04:23] because you you weren't reverencing
[1:04:28] God Amen who does not want to
[1:04:31] participate in
[1:04:34] this how many can say that you've
[1:04:36] actually did a lot of bad things all
[1:04:40] because you weren't reverencing God Amen
[1:04:44] a
[1:04:45] lot
[1:04:53] now
[1:04:56] this is when you were
[1:04:59] born this is your
[1:05:08] birth this is you know you go into a
[1:05:11] cemetery and you see two dates
[1:05:14] right the birth the death or born died
[1:05:19] so every one of us has this no we have a
[1:05:23] hope in a rap that would be this date
[1:05:25] okay amen we don't know when the Lord's
[1:05:28] coming we thought he'd be here before
[1:05:29] now if I was to ask brother Johnson
[1:05:31] brother Johnson when did you think the
[1:05:33] Lord was coming I'm sure he would not be
[1:05:35] thinking it would be today it would have
[1:05:37] been much
[1:05:38] sooner than
[1:05:41] today now here is you and I this is
[1:05:46] where we're
[1:05:49] at that's right so you just told me that
[1:05:53] you've done and said a lot of things in
[1:05:56] this area right
[1:05:58] here that you did the same reason I did
[1:06:02] because we were lacking the fear of the
[1:06:04] Lord
[1:06:07] amen now we don't know how much longer
[1:06:10] we got just because you're younger than
[1:06:13] me doesn't mean you've got a lot more
[1:06:16] time than me that's
[1:06:20] true I was a middle child I had one one
[1:06:24] of my brothers die after three hours or
[1:06:27] three days one of the two and I'm sorry
[1:06:28] that I don't know but just bringing a
[1:06:30] point and I had one brother who was
[1:06:32] older than me that left this Earth
[1:06:34] before I
[1:06:35] did we don't know how much time we got I
[1:06:39] do know this that there's not a thing
[1:06:42] that you can do about your past not a
[1:06:45] thing that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:06:47] Christ is for thank God for the
[1:06:51] blood you have no promise of the future
[1:06:54] so when I talk to you this morning about
[1:06:56] the fear of God I'm talking about one
[1:06:58] thing I'm talking about where you are in
[1:07:00] your present state right this
[1:07:04] moment because that's all that
[1:07:06] matters where your mind is at your
[1:07:08] thoughts are at your intents you're at
[1:07:10] amen you fear the lord right
[1:07:17] now the only thing we can do is
[1:07:20] reverence him in the present
[1:07:22] tense amen if we learn to reverence him
[1:07:26] in our present tense that will bring
[1:07:29] about a faithful
[1:07:32] walk a faithful
[1:07:35] life When We Fear and
[1:07:39] respect When We Fear God we respect his
[1:07:45] word in all of our conversations and all
[1:07:48] of our
[1:07:51] situations that is when we grow and
[1:07:55] prosper in the things of God too often
[1:07:59] carnal Christians get caught up in the
[1:08:02] drama of only respecting those who they
[1:08:05] feel are worthy of their respect amen
[1:08:09] amen as if they're God over the
[1:08:14] word that's no different than being an
[1:08:16] unbeliever it
[1:08:19] isn't amen the Bible doesn't tell us to
[1:08:22] only respect certain people
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:26] amen in fact I believe the Bible says
[1:08:28] under all
[1:08:29] men especially those of the household of
[1:08:35] faith I think we don't got time but if
[1:08:37] you read the I believe it's the either
[1:08:40] in Peter or Jude the Bible talks about
[1:08:43] uh these these people they just talk uh
[1:08:47] uh so arrogantly about uh Authority and
[1:08:52] and about governments and about other
[1:08:56] people when the Bible says that even the
[1:09:00] angels right would not bring an
[1:09:03] acquisation against them who were wrong
[1:09:05] to the Lord
[1:09:08] amen because they feared the actual
[1:09:12] judging somebody the actual uh bringing
[1:09:15] the truth which was not according to the
[1:09:18] word of God to God but yet we find it
[1:09:22] it's okay to say negative
[1:09:26] things feel Justified well this is where
[1:09:29] I stand well that's fine where you stand
[1:09:31] but why don't you stand where the word
[1:09:33] wants you to
[1:09:34] stand stand with the fear of God stand
[1:09:37] you got angels as your example
[1:09:41] amen well brother John we're living in a
[1:09:43] different time I'll tell you when this
[1:09:45] time is all over you'll see what the
[1:09:46] real time was all
[1:09:52] along
[1:09:57] respect and reverence for all of God's
[1:10:00] word opens the door for wisdom
[1:10:05] yes Proverbs 9:10 says that the fear of
[1:10:09] the Lord this
[1:10:11] fear here the conclusion of the whole
[1:10:13] matter fear God keep his Commandments
[1:10:15] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:10:18] wisdom
[1:10:20] right and the knowledge of the Holy is
[1:10:23] understanding
[1:10:24] amen If any man likes wisdom let him ask
[1:10:27] of God who giveth liberally
[1:10:34] that's but I'll tell you what you're
[1:10:36] going to have to have the fear of the
[1:10:37] Lord if you're going to get it
[1:10:39] amen if we want true wisdom of God it
[1:10:42] starts with reverence and respect to his
[1:10:46] word more than what we're doing you want
[1:10:48] more wisdom respect the word more well
[1:10:52] brother John I respect the word and and
[1:10:53] I just you know I'm offended that you
[1:10:55] would say that I don't respect the
[1:10:57] word I'm offended that you think you are
[1:11:00] exactly what the word wants you to
[1:11:04] be look if my people which are called by
[1:11:08] my name shall humble themselves then I
[1:11:11] will hear from God it's not about do you
[1:11:13] belong to God not belong to God it isn't
[1:11:16] about you you you do not have wisdom or
[1:11:18] you do not fear the lord sure you
[1:11:22] do
[1:11:26] but look we can't even live our life to
[1:11:30] this
[1:11:32] point and be so happy about it
[1:11:36] amen amen why not hear the message this
[1:11:41] morning
[1:11:43] amen how many wants more wisdom amen the
[1:11:47] fear the Lord is the
[1:11:49] beginning of wisdom Proverbs 16:16 says
[1:11:53] how much much better is it to get wisdom
[1:11:55] than to actually get
[1:11:57] gold and to get understanding rather to
[1:12:01] be chosen than
[1:12:04] silver Proverbs 4:5 get wisdom get
[1:12:08] understanding forget it not neither
[1:12:10] decline thine uh decline from the words
[1:12:13] of my
[1:12:15] mouth so get wisdom get understanding
[1:12:17] forsake her not and she shall preserve
[1:12:21] thee forsake her not and she shall
[1:12:24] preserve thee love her and she shall
[1:12:27] keep thee right amen wisdom is the
[1:12:30] principal thing therefore get wisdom and
[1:12:33] with all thy getting get understanding
[1:12:36] amen exalt her and she shall promote
[1:12:38] thee she shall bring thee honor when
[1:12:41] thou Dost Embrace her amen too
[1:12:46] often we think we have
[1:12:50] wisdom and how we're going to handle
[1:12:52] something
[1:12:55] but we end up handling it
[1:12:58] carnally because what we're actually
[1:13:00] using is carnal worldly wisdom to handle
[1:13:03] our
[1:13:07] problems if we're going after Godly
[1:13:10] wisdom we're going after the nature of
[1:13:13] God in
[1:13:15] demonstration right you've got the
[1:13:17] knowledge of God and the wisdom of God
[1:13:20] and the wisdom of God puts it in
[1:13:22] demonstration it is the actual
[1:13:25] manifestation of what to
[1:13:27] do come on it shouldn't be so quiet here
[1:13:30] amen let's look at James 3 verse
[1:13:34] 13 who is a wise man and endued with
[1:13:38] knowledge among
[1:13:40] you let him show out of a good
[1:13:43] conversation his works with look at this
[1:13:48] meekness of wisdom so often we use
[1:13:50] wisdom but you know what comes with it
[1:13:52] yelling at some somebody getting angry
[1:13:54] at
[1:13:57] somebody come on just just love the word
[1:14:00] love the word you don't have to love me
[1:14:02] love the
[1:14:03] word but if you have bitter envy and
[1:14:07] strife in Your Heart Right amen glory
[1:14:09] not and lie not against the truth this
[1:14:13] wisdom descendeth not from
[1:14:16] above but it's Earthly it's Central it's
[1:14:20] devilish for when for where envy and in
[1:14:24] Strife is there is confusion and what
[1:14:27] else every every evil work amen that's
[1:14:33] why I hate confusion amen amen I hate
[1:14:36] the the very thing it tries to pop his
[1:14:39] head
[1:14:46] up there is no fear of the
[1:14:49] Lord when we're carnally in our flesh
[1:14:59] I love verse 17 but the wisdom that is
[1:15:01] from
[1:15:03] above its first pure in other words
[1:15:07] that's not mixed with our ideas of what
[1:15:09] we're trying to accomplish our bad
[1:15:10] motives and what we want to see happen
[1:15:13] it's just totally 100% God it is pure
[1:15:18] God no
[1:15:22] partiality
[1:15:23] it's then Peaceable it's
[1:15:26] gentle it's easy to be in treated it's
[1:15:29] full of Mercy it's full of good fruits
[1:15:31] it's without partiality and without
[1:15:33] hypocrisy and I want to ask you the last
[1:15:36] times that you deal you've dealt with
[1:15:39] things not back here but
[1:15:43] here which one of these did you
[1:15:49] use look at the fear of the Lord is the
[1:15:52] beginning beginning of what we just read
[1:15:56] amen amen I could be wrong I don't want
[1:15:59] to hurt I don't want to stumble but I
[1:16:01] know I need to make this thing right I
[1:16:04] need to I need God has called me to be a
[1:16:06] peacemaker God has called me to to
[1:16:08] intervene God has called me to stand in
[1:16:10] the God God has called me to help my
[1:16:12] Fallen brother and sister God has called
[1:16:14] me God's good but I need to do it in the
[1:16:16] guidelines of the wisdom of God Amen so
[1:16:21] instead of just trying to oh I got to
[1:16:22] figure this out what you need to say is
[1:16:24] I need to fear
[1:16:26] God I need to fear God because it is the
[1:16:28] beginning of wisdom we can't even get to
[1:16:31] where we want to get to without the fear
[1:16:33] of God Amen too often we're just I'm
[1:16:35] going to show somebody they're wrong I'm
[1:16:37] going to prove I'm going to I'm going to
[1:16:38] let them
[1:16:43] know hey look people can feel if they
[1:16:46] don't get it right that second it won't
[1:16:49] be long until God shows them what spirit
[1:16:52] that was
[1:16:57] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[1:16:59] in what
[1:17:01] peace of them that make peace right
[1:17:07] amen amen you know we can make wrath we
[1:17:13] can make turmoil we can make division we
[1:17:16] can so
[1:17:18] Discord we can got we got the power to
[1:17:20] do that if we're listening to a devil
[1:17:23] that's trying to tell us to be
[1:17:26] selfish but we also got power to bring
[1:17:30] two brothers together to bring two
[1:17:32] sisters
[1:17:34] together to make to make peace
[1:17:37] amen why
[1:17:40] because he is our peace and the Prince
[1:17:42] of Peace lives in US amen and when we
[1:17:45] yield to that you to him the fear the
[1:17:50] lord he always wants there he wants us
[1:17:54] to walk in peace I'm just going to say
[1:17:57] this the think that God does not want us
[1:17:59] to always be in peace is to say that God
[1:18:02] does not always want peace with
[1:18:04] you his very motive is that we walk in
[1:18:08] harmony with him why wouldn't his motive
[1:18:11] be for us to walk in harmony with one
[1:18:15] another in fact he's he's more for
[1:18:19] that than he is of your relationship
[1:18:23] with
[1:18:24] him brother John that's a strong
[1:18:26] statement what Jesus himself said if you
[1:18:28] come here to The Altar and offer me a
[1:18:31] gift whatever gift it is just leave it
[1:18:35] here go back and make sure things are
[1:18:38] right between you your brother and your
[1:18:41] sister amen make sure there's peace
[1:18:44] there and then when that's taken care of
[1:18:46] then you come here and give me your best
[1:18:49] but you're not giving me your best when
[1:18:51] there's something that should be made
[1:18:52] right right between a brother and sister
[1:18:54] that's right brother amen am that's
[1:18:58] good if you want the wisdom of God it
[1:19:01] will start with reverencing and
[1:19:03] respecting what the word instructs us to
[1:19:06] do with our present situations you know
[1:19:09] too often we just think well this is uh
[1:19:13] I I come to church and this is between
[1:19:15] me and God and then when I'm dealing
[1:19:17] with this person it's between me and
[1:19:21] them
[1:19:23] God needs to be the God of all of our
[1:19:25] life
[1:19:27] amen so I say I don't care what
[1:19:29] situation you're in I don't care if it
[1:19:31] has to do with with neighbors with
[1:19:33] people with family with with church
[1:19:36] members whatever your situation
[1:19:41] is if
[1:19:44] you are more reverent to what this word
[1:19:47] says God I want to do exactly what you
[1:19:50] want if it takes the height off of me
[1:19:54] God will give you wisdom to take care of
[1:19:58] it now if you don't care about taking
[1:20:01] care of it like you could care
[1:20:04] less well what you're saying is I could
[1:20:06] care less about my relationship with God
[1:20:09] I know that's strong but look I'm just
[1:20:11] going to say it like it is brother I
[1:20:14] just read a quote uh yesterday I believe
[1:20:18] it was where brother brandom saw the the
[1:20:21] these this couple they were walking to
[1:20:23] church and this woman she had a
[1:20:24] cigarette she was puffing it out like a
[1:20:26] train and she was on her way going to
[1:20:29] church and brother Brandon was there
[1:20:31] there is a a speaker and he was going to
[1:20:33] be speaking he said oh my God Lord
[1:20:36] You've you've you've called us to be
[1:20:38] ministers and to help your people and
[1:20:41] and this is this is what's coming and
[1:20:43] they don't he said they don't want to
[1:20:45] listen to me that's what he said they
[1:20:48] don't want to listen to
[1:20:50] me and brother and God just whispered a
[1:20:54] little word to brother Bram and said
[1:20:56] well if you're ashamed to speak my word
[1:20:59] to
[1:21:00] them if you're afraid to speak that word
[1:21:03] to
[1:21:05] them you're ashamed of
[1:21:10] me to seek to please
[1:21:13] men you're not a servant of
[1:21:19] his you know I do
[1:21:21] believe that we need to say it like it
[1:21:23] is
[1:21:25] amen do am and not not even behind the
[1:21:29] pulpit but we need to use meekness and
[1:21:33] love love is corrective well you know
[1:21:35] what hate traits are correct
[1:21:37] too hey the wisdom of this world tries
[1:21:40] to correct too well you shouldn't have
[1:21:42] done that and you shouldn't well how
[1:21:43] many times we've had a fight with our
[1:21:48] spouse trying to prove what's right here
[1:21:52] the conclusion of the whole matter I
[1:21:54] don't care what the fight is I don't
[1:21:55] care what it's about the conclusion of
[1:21:57] the whole matter is to fear God and keep
[1:21:59] his Commandments amen that's the
[1:22:01] conclusion amen proving who's right or
[1:22:05] who's wrong isn't doesn't mean anything
[1:22:10] amen Jesus said in Matthew 25:40 verily
[1:22:13] I say unto you in so much as you have
[1:22:15] done it unto one of the least of these
[1:22:19] my
[1:22:21] brethren you have done it unto
[1:22:25] me
[1:22:27] wow do you actually mean Lord that when
[1:22:30] I got upset and I just so angry in my
[1:22:33] thoughts and I just want to tell them
[1:22:34] like it was that I was actually doing
[1:22:36] that to you Lord amen that's exactly
[1:22:38] what that means but why we don't think
[1:22:41] of it is because we are not walking in
[1:22:43] the fear of the Lord we're not
[1:22:45] reverencing the word we got so religious
[1:22:47] spirit that thinks they got something
[1:22:49] special with
[1:22:51] God
[1:22:55] this fear of the Lord is not a
[1:23:02] gift it's not that's not something you
[1:23:04] can put on
[1:23:09] either times if we're not careful we can
[1:23:12] think ill of others and feel Justified
[1:23:16] about
[1:23:19] it how we think about someone talk about
[1:23:22] someone treat someone is the same way
[1:23:25] that we're doing towards God Amen
[1:23:35] wow you ever know if this has ever
[1:23:39] happened to her you ever start have
[1:23:42] somebody just testified this to me that
[1:23:45] I can witness of the same
[1:23:47] thing you're having you get a thought a
[1:23:51] negative thought
[1:23:53] afflicting thought of the devil
[1:23:55] something negative about
[1:23:58] somebody and if you yield to that thing
[1:24:00] and you say that's true and then
[1:24:04] something happens immediately has
[1:24:06] anybody ever experienced that
[1:24:08] immediately something
[1:24:11] happens I believe our thoughts speak
[1:24:14] louder in heaven than our words do
[1:24:16] unearth amen our thoughts how many times
[1:24:19] we hear the prophet say God knows
[1:24:21] exactly what you're
[1:24:26] thinking it's real this fear of the Lord
[1:24:28] is a real
[1:24:30] thing we we you know we're not coming to
[1:24:32] church to try to get some knowledge we
[1:24:35] need to get we need to better a
[1:24:39] relationship God doesn't like it when we
[1:24:41] don't respect one another amen our whole
[1:24:44] duty is to reverence God respect him
[1:24:46] enough to stay in the guidelines of the
[1:24:49] word so if the word says to respect one
[1:24:51] another to to love one another to honor
[1:24:53] one another to pray for one another to
[1:24:56] to Bear the infirmities of the weak then
[1:24:57] we respect that word and we start
[1:24:59] putting into action we don't say well
[1:25:01] you know I don't feel the leading of the
[1:25:02] Lord you know what it's because you
[1:25:04] don't have the fear of the Lord you get
[1:25:06] more of the fear of the Lord you'll feel
[1:25:07] led to do a lot more things in you're
[1:25:11] doing you know I may not know how to
[1:25:13] preach but I sure feel
[1:25:16] them I sure feel them this morning amen
[1:25:20] amen look at Mary
[1:25:23] she was the oldest sister of
[1:25:26] Moses she was probably used to help
[1:25:28] rescue Moses when he was in the N
[1:25:32] River no doubt believed in the calling
[1:25:35] of
[1:25:37] Moses yet she made fun of Moses's wife
[1:25:43] because she was in
[1:25:46] Ethiopian and you know what something
[1:25:49] negative happened to her body because
[1:25:50] she did that amen

[1:26:16] want to but you give God respect amen
[1:26:24] don't make fun of
[1:26:30] people I don't think God's going to just
[1:26:32] sit by Idol and let you be
[1:26:37] disrespectful I'll tell you I I I want
[1:26:40] my life to prosper a lot more than it is
[1:26:42] and I don't mean financially because I
[1:26:44] don't look at myself as very
[1:26:47] Financial because whatever I get I give
[1:26:50] stay away from that stay away from it
[1:26:54] just give what God gives you amen
[1:26:57] amen but I want my life to bring him
[1:27:00] more honor and glory
[1:27:03] amen it it can't happen unless I
[1:27:06] reverence the word more right it ain't
[1:27:09] about what I know it's about what I live
[1:27:13] that's right and it it it's it's about
[1:27:15] what we live at all times not just in
[1:27:17] front of one
[1:27:20] another the Bible says that God is able
[1:27:24] to make all grace abound unto us
[1:27:28] yes yes amen you want God to do more

[1:27:38] say God have I had the wrong thoughts
[1:27:40] have I said the wrong things if I have I
[1:27:42] had negativity in my mind because that
[1:27:46] is not the fear of the Lord that's being
[1:27:48] overtaken by the fear of the devil and
[1:27:51] not even know it right
[1:27:53] amen God demands respect at all times a
[1:27:58] lot of times people struggle on their
[1:28:00] life because they have a lack of respect
[1:28:01] and don't even know
[1:28:03] it Bible says when all thy ways please
[1:28:06] the Lord he'll make even thy enemies to
[1:28:08] be at peace with you you still got
[1:28:09] enemies but they're at peace with
[1:28:12] you they're at peace
[1:28:16] amen God demands respect at all times to
[1:28:19] his word you believe that revelation
[1:28:22] 22:18 says for I testify unto every man
[1:28:27] that heareth the words of the
[1:28:31] Bible the prophecy of this
[1:28:37] book If any man shall add unto the
[1:28:41] things to these
[1:28:43] things God shall add unto him the
[1:28:47] plagues notice that the plagues that are
[1:28:50] written in this book notice every time
[1:28:53] in the Old Testament that the Israel got
[1:28:55] out of the will of God what happened to
[1:28:57] them God pled them with their
[1:29:00] enemy but who's our
[1:29:03] enemy you know we think well that's the
[1:29:06] Old Testament God's in the new I'm
[1:29:07] telling you every time we get out of
[1:29:10] line if we are not willing to take heed
[1:29:13] to the word when it says get back in
[1:29:16] line trust me God will find a way to get
[1:29:20] your attention amen
[1:29:25] and if any man shall take away from the
[1:29:28] words of the book of this
[1:29:30] prophecy God shall take his part out of
[1:29:33] the book of life and out of the holy
[1:29:36] city and from the things which are
[1:29:38] written in this book in other words
[1:29:41] don't add don't take
[1:29:44] away God demands respect for the word or
[1:29:47] for his word
[1:29:49] amen and I don't feel as if I could say
[1:29:52] it like this my precious brothers and
[1:29:54] sisters I don't feel like we in our
[1:29:57] heart need to look at God and say God I
[1:29:59] I I I I want to fear you more respect
[1:30:02] you more reverence you
[1:30:05] more I don't think we're missing it
[1:30:07] there what we're missing it is is we
[1:30:09] don't think he's attached to this word
[1:30:12] enough right that's where I think we're
[1:30:14] really missing it we're not taking the
[1:30:16] word seriously when we say something
[1:30:18] about somebody you know the love of God
[1:30:20] think it's no evil we think evil and
[1:30:21] it's like not a bad big big
[1:30:23] deal we're not reverencing his word the
[1:30:27] our thought process with God our our our
[1:30:30] intent with God I mean that we yes I I
[1:30:33] reverence God but we're not taking this
[1:30:37] seriously and you can't separate God and
[1:30:40] the word in the beginning was the word
[1:30:42] the word was with God the Word was God
[1:30:44] they are the
[1:30:46] same and the bride is getting dressed to
[1:30:49] become the she is becoming the Manifest
[1:30:51] Ed word yes not the quoter of the word
[1:30:55] amen the manifestation of the word amen
[1:30:58] not I know more than you look at me
[1:31:00] unpopular no that spirit is out there
[1:31:02] thank God it's not here it's out there
[1:31:06] it's really out
[1:31:09] there it's what can I
[1:31:12] do to please you
[1:31:15] Lord
[1:31:17] presently right now what can I do right
[1:31:21] now to please you it takes the fear of
[1:31:26] the
[1:31:27] Lord to make sure you know every man
[1:31:30] here's the thing the Fe our nature is
[1:31:34] I'm right my own eyes don't you tell
[1:31:36] me and the fear of the Lord is just the
[1:31:39] opposite I could be
[1:31:41] wrong so these things do these two
[1:31:43] things are are are button heads brother
[1:31:46] BR say you got a white dog and a back
[1:31:48] black
[1:31:49] dog who is winning right amen you feed
[1:31:55] the white dog you're going to want to
[1:31:57] please him when the doors are
[1:32:01] closed if you feed in your flesh It all
[1:32:04] becomes a religion like a bark on the
[1:32:06] tree amen amen God demands respect at
[1:32:10] all times don't expect to just watch
[1:32:13] your way into the church with any old
[1:32:17] attitude and expect something from God
[1:32:21] Amen yes yes God dwells in
[1:32:25] humility
[1:32:26] God helps those that are humble he
[1:32:29] rewards The Humble but those that are
[1:32:32] proud and arrogant he will
[1:32:35] resist think about God's Prophet Moses
[1:32:38] take your shoes off you're standing on
[1:32:40] Holy Ground brother R said well you know
[1:32:45] usually what we do is we take off our
[1:32:46] hat down
[1:32:48] here didn't say hat
[1:32:54] didn't say take your jacket
[1:32:56] off take your shoes
[1:32:58] off whatever God says do it best advice
[1:33:03] that his mother gave to
[1:33:04] everybody said Mary what do we do
[1:33:07] whatever he sayth do it that's right
[1:33:10] amen do what the word
[1:33:13] says because if he's telling you to do
[1:33:16] something this right here is Holy
[1:33:19] Ground this is Holy Ground
[1:33:22] and if his word says love covers a
[1:33:25] multitude of sin then you better start
[1:33:27] covering yes don't take somebody's don't
[1:33:31] take the veil off somebody's sin don't
[1:33:33] you do that Satan is the accuser of the
[1:33:37] Brethren that's Unholy ground that's the
[1:33:40] that is you know that's the fear that
[1:33:42] comes from torment amen if you can't
[1:33:45] love somebody to keep it covered you're
[1:33:49] standing on Unholy ground amen I know
[1:33:53] this is strong but I tell you we need a
[1:33:55] cleanup don't
[1:34:00] we now too often Believers miss being
[1:34:05] blessed when they come to church because
[1:34:07] they just view this place as a a stone
[1:34:13] building that may be true it is a stone
[1:34:17] building like all other buildings but
[1:34:20] the secret here
[1:34:22] is it has been dedicated to God now when
[1:34:25] I mean that I don't mean we had a
[1:34:27] dedication
[1:34:28] service what I mean is each and every
[1:34:31] day when our thoughts go to this place
[1:34:33] at least mine it is a place that's been
[1:34:36] dedicated to
[1:34:37] God and God Honors
[1:34:40] that God Honors
[1:34:44] that you can walk into some places and
[1:34:47] feel so out of place so like I got to
[1:34:50] get out of here
[1:34:52] and you can walk into some places and
[1:34:55] feel the love of God that's
[1:35:00] right I believe God
[1:35:05] honors the place that he promised to be
[1:35:09] amen look at Israel every time the
[1:35:12] children of Israel murmured and
[1:35:14] complained they actually disrespected
[1:35:18] God what happens to us when we murmur
[1:35:20] and complaint
[1:35:22] it's okay God knows God sees God
[1:35:25] believes he's you know you know he's a
[1:35:29] you know we we begin to make this this
[1:35:33] truth this
[1:35:35] this religion this church this this
[1:35:38] message like some sort of uh uh
[1:35:41] Republican Democratic belief
[1:35:45] system in other words you're on one side
[1:35:48] and the other person is on another side
[1:35:51] and unless they believe with you they're
[1:35:54] off and what we need to do is realize
[1:35:57] that we're all off and the only thing
[1:35:59] that is on is the word
[1:36:03] amen and stop acting like we're a
[1:36:05] politician about the
[1:36:07] Bible it just doesn't matter live the
[1:36:10] word live the word lay down your life
[1:36:13] love amen because that's all that's
[1:36:16] going to matter it is the whole duty of
[1:36:19] man to fear God and to keep his
[1:36:21] Commandments amen do all things without
[1:36:24] murmurings and disputings that you may
[1:36:26] be blameless and harmless the sons of
[1:36:28] God without rebuke in the midst of a
[1:36:30] crooked and perverse Nation among whom
[1:36:32] you shine as lights in the
[1:36:36] world
[1:36:38] Israel feared the
[1:36:43] Giants they had these tormenting
[1:36:46] thoughts afflicting
[1:36:48] thoughts they were much bigger than than
[1:36:53] them and it
[1:36:55] began
[1:36:57] to they accepted
[1:37:00] them because they said we are like
[1:37:03] grasshoppers in our own sight to them
[1:37:06] and these very thoughts began to
[1:37:08] manipulate their feelings to where they
[1:37:11] felt
[1:37:14] scared they felt
[1:37:18] anxiety they felt overwhelming feelings
[1:37:23] and you know what they did they began to
[1:37:27] lash out against the
[1:37:30] authority of the
[1:37:34] word exactly what they
[1:37:36] did but we should have we should have we
[1:37:40] should have never left Egypt we should
[1:37:43] go back we should get a different
[1:37:44] Captain we should get someone who
[1:37:46] believes the way that we believe
[1:37:50] right Joshua and Caleb because they
[1:37:53] didn't yield to those AFF thoughts now
[1:37:55] just be honest with you they had the
[1:37:57] same thought come to them don't think
[1:37:59] the devil didn't give them any thoughts
[1:38:01] the devil did the problem is they
[1:38:05] resisted the thought therefore they
[1:38:07] never went into that feelings of in
[1:38:11] overwhelming I can't do
[1:38:13] this I'm suffering no the bigger they
[1:38:16] are the harder they fall their attitude
[1:38:19] was different
[1:38:23] it all stems with the thought that you
[1:38:26] accept as soon as you accept it then you
[1:38:28] got to sit there and you got to battle
[1:38:30] you got to think how am I going to
[1:38:32] overcome this situation how how am I
[1:38:34] going to think my way through before you
[1:38:35] know you're trying to use the worldly
[1:38:37] wisdom and I'm going to do this I'm I'm
[1:38:39] not going to shake that person's hand
[1:38:40] I'm not going to talk to the and before
[1:38:42] you're not you're walking carnally and
[1:38:44] you think God is with you but he's
[1:38:47] noten because you crossed the word a
[1:38:49] long time ago
[1:38:51] look there's a reason we feel the way we
[1:38:53] do in our past and if it's ever going to
[1:38:55] change it's got to change right
[1:38:58] now by fearing God more now amen
[1:39:03] now look at vasy she had it all sold up
[1:39:06] she was already identified as the queen
[1:39:10] of the king she was already the bride
[1:39:13] amen right message came to her she was
[1:39:19] bride but she started
[1:39:24] acting Hy y amen you know brother John I
[1:39:29] don't mean to wrong but I've seen
[1:39:31] ministers at Cy I don't get
[1:39:37] it brothers sisters that been in the
[1:39:39] message a while hoty amen
[1:39:43] arrogant amen I'm
[1:39:48] bride ashy I'm bride I can do this I can
[1:39:52] do
[1:39:57] that she was missing an important
[1:39:59] ingredient you know what that is don't
[1:40:01] you the fear of the Lord that's right
[1:40:04] she didn't fear the king that's right he
[1:40:10] didn't and the King had to put her away
[1:40:14] because he wasn't the example of the
[1:40:17] King
[1:40:18] right and who did he choose
[1:40:23] he chose
[1:40:24] someone that
[1:40:26] wasn't if I could say it like this
[1:40:30] acted like some Queen on the throne
[1:40:35] you've heard of the queen on the throne
[1:40:39] no reverence respect if it be pleasing
[1:40:43] in thy sight she waited she approached
[1:40:48] the right way the
[1:40:49] throne she waited till she was called on
[1:40:53] before she asked and when she asked she
[1:40:55] didn't ask for herself she was always
[1:40:58] asking for somebody else she was
[1:41:00] interceding for somebody else she knew
[1:41:03] her position up to half of the Kingdom
[1:41:05] but she never took it that's
[1:41:09] right amen look if I can just be next to
[1:41:13] him I can be his bride that's all I want
[1:41:17] amen she had the fear of the Lord
[1:41:22] I'll tell you Saints we've got so many
[1:41:25] examples in this Bible because
[1:41:27] obviously time is
[1:41:29] up get into the word and look for the
[1:41:32] examples of the fear of the Lord and if
[1:41:34] it's in your heart that you want to grow
[1:41:38] closer to God you'll never do it without
[1:41:40] the fear of God so seek the fear of the
[1:41:43] Lord am too many people get all this
[1:41:45] knowledge and all these Mysteries and
[1:41:47] they feel well I've got something you
[1:41:49] you know you got people that that come
[1:41:50] come to a message church and you know
[1:41:52] what their real motive is they're
[1:41:54] looking for something new I'm going to
[1:41:56] tell you something about that spirit so
[1:41:58] was Eve she was looking for something
[1:42:02] new she lusted for
[1:42:04] knowledge look the only thing I'm
[1:42:06] looking for new is to be able to live
[1:42:08] something I'm not living right now
[1:42:09] that's the new thing I'm looking
[1:42:14] for because that's what God's looking
[1:42:16] for I may be looking for you know you
[1:42:18] can have all knowledge
[1:42:21] still miss
[1:42:22] it wouldn't gain anything the Bible
[1:42:25] says but to love God to have his love to
[1:42:29] where you want to stay in the framework
[1:42:31] of the word that's what really matters
[1:42:35] amen oh my my you know there's a lot of
[1:42:37] examples just in the brother brandom's
[1:42:43] Ministry in the Bible in the
[1:42:46] ministry Abraham he
[1:42:49] lied in one sense we could say God said
[1:42:52] I don't care if he lied or not you
[1:42:53] better you better go ask him for
[1:42:56] forgiveness and have him pray over
[1:42:59] you God demands
[1:43:03] respect there's a woman that said I
[1:43:05] wouldn't give I wouldn't give your
[1:43:07] religion to my
[1:43:10] cow what happened to
[1:43:16] her we need to
[1:43:19] respect this message we need to respect
[1:43:23] this word we need to respect God one
[1:43:27] time brother Brandon was testifying to
[1:43:29] his sister about God's creative power
[1:43:31] and sister hady Wright said that's
[1:43:33] nothing but the
[1:43:35] truth you know God loves respect to his
[1:43:37] word he
[1:43:39] does the holy spirit said you just say
[1:43:42] the Holy Spirit told me whatever you say
[1:43:45] you can
[1:43:46] have brother Brandon
[1:43:49] said
[1:43:51] uh in the in in the message my new
[1:43:53] ministry and she said brother Bill my
[1:43:55] greatest desire is for the Salvation of
[1:43:57] my two boys there couldn't have been
[1:44:00] any greater thing she could ask for
[1:44:04] $10,000 she would have got it what if
[1:44:07] she would have been some
[1:44:09] millionaire she would have asked for
[1:44:11] another
[1:44:12] million God known exactly what she was
[1:44:15] going to ask for right
[1:44:18] yes I believe the whole Holy Ghost says
[1:44:21] Amen to every word of God don't you amen
[1:44:24] amen let's Stand Together wherefore
[1:44:26] let's serve God
[1:44:29] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[1:44:33] brother baham said in the message a true
[1:44:35] sign overlooked he said we should be so
[1:44:37] close together
[1:44:40] brother that we just we'd be more than
[1:44:44] real brothers and
[1:44:46] sisters that's the love that we ought to
[1:44:48] have in our hearts for one another
[1:44:50] Reverend respect the highest and I like
[1:44:53] that I like the real thing did you know
[1:44:56] the Bible said that the fear of the Lord
[1:44:58] is
[1:44:59] clean it's what cleaned you up I could
[1:45:03] be wrong okay let's get this thing
[1:45:06] right let the meditation of my heart
[1:45:11] amen amen and the words that I speak yes
[1:45:15] let them be acceptable unto
[1:45:19] thee
[1:45:24] is that your
[1:45:26] desire let us hear the
[1:45:29] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[1:45:35] and keep his Commandments amen for this
[1:45:40] is the whole duty of man last quote
[1:45:43] brother brand says the statute of
[1:45:45] perfect man he said let's add to our
[1:45:47] faith these things then we might come
[1:45:49] into the whole statue of Christ being
[1:45:51] joined together with Godly love the fear
[1:45:56] of God reverence in our hearts one
[1:45:59] towards another deep respect to one
[1:46:01] another brother and
[1:46:04] sister kindliness never
[1:46:07] vulgarity nothing but the purity of the
[1:46:10] Holy Spirit I'm I I am so sorry I got
[1:46:15] one more quote can you just stand a
[1:46:17] little bit this is important I'm just
[1:46:19] because it's just describing the fear of
[1:46:22] God in a greater measure brother Brandon
[1:46:23] said in the message respects he's
[1:46:26] quoting the scripture let us hear the
[1:46:27] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[1:46:29] and keep his Commandments for it is for
[1:46:32] this is the full duty of man the
[1:46:34] conclusion of the whole matter is to
[1:46:36] fear God and when you canot have
[1:46:40] respect and when you cannot have respect
[1:46:43] until you have fear you cannot have the
[1:46:45] fear of God Solomon said in Proverbs
[1:46:47] that the fear of God is to begin the
[1:46:49] wisdom no
[1:46:50] that don't mean that you're not afraid
[1:46:52] of him but that means that you're given
[1:46:55] respect and reverence and when you
[1:46:58] respect God you fear God you fear that
[1:47:01] you might displease him in some way you
[1:47:05] fear lest you would do something wrong
[1:47:07] you wouldn't want to do that he said I
[1:47:10] fear my
[1:47:12] mother I fear my wife I fear my
[1:47:17] church I fear all of God's servants
[1:47:20] unless I should put a stumbling block
[1:47:22] somewhere in their way I fear the people
[1:47:26] I fear people of the city unless I
[1:47:28] should do something wrong and would
[1:47:30] cause them to think that I wasn't a
[1:47:33] Christian you see amen you've got before
[1:47:36] you can have respect you've got to have
[1:47:38] fear and God demands it he demands
[1:47:41] respect God does he demands it and fear
[1:47:45] brings
[1:47:46] it and we know that fear brings respect
[1:47:50] respect I love that quote isn't that
[1:47:53] beautiful amen let's sing that little

[1:50:17] you

[1:50:26] pursue be

[1:50:45] pleasing to
[1:50:47] you let everything
[1:50:51] that I

[1:51:44] everything I
[1:51:47] pursue de please
[1:51:51] no Lord unto
[1:51:56] you amen I I believe that's all of our
[1:52:00] desires I really do
[1:52:03] amen let's just bow our hearts in a word
[1:52:07] of prayer with every eye
[1:52:09] closed if there was just one
[1:52:13] thing that you could
[1:52:15] receive from the Lord just one thing
[1:52:27] outside of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:30] now just one thing that you could
[1:52:33] receive from the Lord I just have this
[1:52:36] question would you ask for the fear of
[1:52:38] the
[1:52:41] Lord in that is all now
[1:52:44] your efforts and ability to do what he
[1:52:49] wants wants us to do of course we need
[1:52:51] the help of God to do it we need the
[1:52:54] Holy Ghost to live this
[1:52:56] life but I believe the fear of the Lord
[1:52:59] really stems from our attitude and
[1:53:03] brother Brandon just said the right
[1:53:05] mental attitude can bring any promise of
[1:53:07] God to pass and I believe promises
[1:53:10] include helping our current situations
[1:53:12] when we're dealing with people and
[1:53:14] things so if that's your desire I want
[1:53:18] you to hold it before the Lord
[1:53:20] and
[1:53:22] perhaps you be here today and you have a
[1:53:25] different desire you want to be
[1:53:27] remembered and prayer just lift up your
[1:53:29] handen God sees those desires praise the
[1:53:32] Lord praise the Lord amen let's let's
[1:53:37] believe as we look to him Heavenly
[1:53:40] Father Lord we're unworthy to even
[1:53:43] approach your
[1:53:44] throne though Thy word says to come to
[1:53:48] thee what
[1:53:50] boldness Lord unless the shedding of
[1:53:53] blood is upon us Lord we cannot come
[1:53:59] boldly but Lord we come
[1:54:02] today with your blood knowing
[1:54:07] knowing the nature of our life has not
[1:54:12] always been with the fear of the
[1:54:15] Lord haven't taken you serious
[1:54:20] always
[1:54:22] just having sometimes
[1:54:25] presumptuous that you're with
[1:54:27] us forgive
[1:54:30] us of presumptuously thinking things
[1:54:35] Lord
[1:54:36] God we're here your
[1:54:40] people Lord we want to make it in the
[1:54:43] Rapture yes
[1:54:45] amen Lord we know it's an
[1:54:48] individual you deal with us as
[1:54:51] individuals and we can't tell you to
[1:54:54] choose us we can't tell you to choose
[1:54:56] somebody
[1:54:57] else you're the one that chooses the
[1:55:00] bride Lord we're not asking that you
[1:55:06] change your word for us we're not asking
[1:55:09] that you would change your standard for
[1:55:12] us we're not a asking Lord that you
[1:55:15] would kind of do the choosing on a
[1:55:19] grading on a scale because we've all
[1:55:21] come short of your glory we're not
[1:55:23] asking
[1:55:25] that but what we're asking Lord for is
[1:55:29] that we might reverence and respect you
[1:55:31] more that we might think on this one
[1:55:34] scripture what our whole duty is as your
[1:55:39] children to remember that there's
[1:55:42] always one Spirit of how we might handle
[1:55:48] every situation the correct way
[1:55:50] way God we pray that you would bring
[1:55:54] your word from cover to cover the
[1:55:58] Forefront of our heart and our mind when
[1:55:59] we enter into situations that Lord we
[1:56:03] really truly need wisdom amen May the
[1:56:06] fear of God rise up inside of us and say
[1:56:09] Lord have thine own way inside of
[1:56:11] me May it come to the Forefront Lord the
[1:56:15] very beginning of wisdom that we need
[1:56:17] for this situation may it start off with
[1:56:20] Lord I want to please
[1:56:22] you I pray that you would bless Every
[1:56:25] Soul here every soul that's listening
[1:56:28] that's praying this very moment on the
[1:56:29] live
[1:56:31] stream God may you give them the very
[1:56:34] desires of their heart to please you
[1:56:35] because I know that you are standing
[1:56:38] 100% behind
[1:56:41] that Lord there's these others that also
[1:56:44] raised their
[1:56:46] hand Lord because you spoke to them
[1:56:50] you spoke to them through the word Lord
[1:56:52] and they have a a request and Lord I am
[1:56:55] uniting with each and every one of
[1:56:58] them I may not know what those things
[1:57:01] are but your word declares if we would
[1:57:04] just agree by
[1:57:06] faith touching the throne Lord that you
[1:57:09] would establish it I pray that you'd
[1:57:12] give the desire of their heart give them
[1:57:15] the desire of their heart Lord Father
[1:57:18] for they resp respect you they reverence
[1:57:20] you
[1:57:21] Lord may you give it to them as you gave
[1:57:25] Esther because Lord they are your
[1:57:29] bride they are the ones that you've you
[1:57:33] Lord I could say it like
[1:57:36] this you blinded Israel for this for us
[1:57:40] lord lord for us standing here and your
[1:57:44] bride around the world we're so grateful
[1:57:48] that you gave us an opportunity Unity
[1:57:50] Lord but then you also taught us to fear
[1:57:54] to fear because if you did that to the
[1:57:57] Natural tree how much more could you do
[1:57:59] that to that which was grafted
[1:58:02] in so Lord May when we leave here our
[1:58:05] lives begin to change more into your
[1:58:08] image because we're choosing the fear of
[1:58:10] the Lord we're choosing your way your
[1:58:13] word for our lives make us more like
[1:58:17] thee we commit ourself to you We Believe
[1:58:21] Lord in you in us manifesting more we
[1:58:26] give you the praise we give you honor we
[1:58:29] glorify you Lord we will thank you
[1:58:31] throughout today we will thank you in
[1:58:34] the days to come we will come rejoicing
[1:58:37] to your house Lord knowing Lord that you
[1:58:40] have something for each and every one of
[1:58:43] us in the preci
