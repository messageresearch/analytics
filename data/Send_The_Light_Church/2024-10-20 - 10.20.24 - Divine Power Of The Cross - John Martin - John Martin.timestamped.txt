[37:10] there's two scripture readings one is in
[37:12] St John chapter
[37:15] 19 and the other is in 1 Corinthians
[37:18] chapter
[37:19] 1 and there's just going to be one verse
[37:22] in each of
[37:24] those St John chapter 19 and first 1
[37:27] Corinthians chapter
[37:34] 1 where would we be without the word of
[37:39] God there would just we'd be lost
[37:42] absolutely is the only thing that
[37:44] doesn't contradict
[37:46] itself only thing that's
[37:50] perfect and our our souls are anchored
[37:53] to it all right St John chapter 19 we're
[37:56] going to read verse number 30 it says
[37:59] here Jesus on the cross after he had he
[38:02] just getting ready to die and he's looks
[38:06] at his mother and has compassion on her
[38:09] condition because he's leaving and has
[38:11] compassion on on one of his disciples
[38:15] John and uh
[38:18] he's takes care of them in the natural
[38:21] and then he says here in verse number 30
[38:22] when Jesus therefore had received
[38:25] vinegar he said it is finished
[38:28] and he bowed his head and gave up the
[38:32] ghost
[38:33] amen and then in 1 Corinthians chapter
[38:39] 1 verse number
[38:43] 18 1 Corinthians chapter
[38:46] 1 verse number 18 Paul speaking to the
[38:50] Corinthian Church he says for the
[38:52] preaching of the Cross is to them that
[38:55] perish
[38:56] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[38:59] it is the power of God amen amen God
[39:04] bless you you may be
[39:06] seated the price that God had required
[39:09] of Adam's sin was paid in full when
[39:12] Jesus said it is
[39:15] finished and because we were born in sin
[39:18] after Adam's sin our debt was paid in
[39:22] full at the same time that Jesus said it
[39:25] is
[39:25] finished now we understand according to
[39:28] the prophet that a a pardon is not a
[39:30] pardon unless it's received as a pardon
[39:32] and there was this man that was in jail
[39:35] at at the time of Abraham Lincoln and he
[39:37] had done something wrong and he was
[39:39] going to receive the death sentence and
[39:42] uh Abraham Lincoln did not have time I I
[39:46] think this is how the story goes they
[39:47] didn't have time to go there so he just
[39:50] wrote on a note and pardoned this man
[39:53] and he said I pardoned this man and he
[39:55] signed it Abraham Lincoln and he gave it
[39:57] to one of his uh Soldiers the men there
[40:00] and he he he came to the jail where he
[40:03] was and he he handed him the note and he
[40:06] said uh you're here this note is from
[40:09] you from Abraham Lincoln and he unlocked
[40:11] the jail cell and the note read that I I
[40:15] pardon so and so from uh the death
[40:17] sentence and the man that uh after he
[40:22] read the note and the door was open
[40:24] something inside of him uh w just
[40:27] couldn't believe this was real that this
[40:29] really wasn't given to him by Abraham
[40:32] Lincoln that the word was not the word
[40:35] of Abraham Lincoln
[40:37] amen and so he just didn't believe it
[40:39] and he sat there in the jail and so when
[40:41] the time came for the uh uh for him to
[40:46] to to die and be executed he was
[40:49] executed then there was an uproar
[40:52] because uh Abraham Lincoln had signed it
[40:55] it was just as good as gold that he was
[40:57] pardon yet he he died and so the Court
[40:59] ruled the judge ruled that a pardon is
[41:02] not a pardon unless it's received as a
[41:05] paron amen and and though Christ died
[41:08] for the whole world right you have to
[41:11] receive the pardon in order to be
[41:15] pardoned Jesus said in John 5:39 search
[41:18] the scriptures for in them you think you
[41:20] have eternal life that's right and they
[41:23] are they which testify of me so it's
[41:26] it's almost like I really care what I
[41:27] think about God I don't care what I
[41:29] think about the scriptures what matters
[41:31] is what the scriptures say to me amen
[41:34] because that's who that's really who God
[41:36] is the scriptures not what I think but
[41:39] what the scriptures say verse 4 he says
[41:42] and and ye will not come to me that you
[41:45] might have a life in other words so many
[41:47] people stay in the jail cell right they
[41:51] will not come out and they will not
[41:53] search the scriptures and find out
[41:54] exactly what it really means to believe
[41:56] in God
[41:58] Goen very familiar scripture in John
[42:01] 3:15 whosoever believeth in him should
[42:04] not perish but have eternal life so the
[42:07] key here is to believe for God so loved
[42:10] the world that he gave his only begotten
[42:11] son and whosoever believeth in him
[42:14] should not perish but have everlasting
[42:17] life for God sent not his son into the
[42:20] world to condemn the world but that the
[42:22] world through him might be saved and he
[42:25] that believeth on him is not condemned
[42:28] but he that believeth not is condemned
[42:29] already because he have not believed in
[42:31] the name of the only begotten son and
[42:33] this is the condemnation that light is
[42:35] come into the world and Men love to stay
[42:39] where they're at
[42:41] amen because their
[42:44] deeds were evil
[42:48] amen God has provided
[42:52] way there was nothing greater that God
[42:55] could
[42:55] done if God forced his holy spirit to be
[42:59] put on one person to change their life
[43:03] without freeor agency just just to do it
[43:06] then he would be guilty and have to do
[43:08] it to
[43:10] everybody so God did his
[43:13] part he finished the work of of paying
[43:17] the price and now it's up to
[43:22] us it's up to us to take Faith in what
[43:25] the scriptures are telling us to get
[43:28] saved and to go I'm going to say this to
[43:31] go beyond the denominational belief of
[43:34] Salvation and going into the this the
[43:37] the scriptural belief of a nature change
[43:40] because there's a difference there's a
[43:42] difference it's a complete word of God
[43:45] become born again the right way God's
[43:48] way amen the harder way but it's the
[43:51] precise way it's the the the the correct
[43:54] way I'll say it like this it's the only
[43:56] way Jesus said I am the way the truth
[43:59] the life and no man cometh to the father
[44:02] but by
[44:05] me God coming in the flesh and paying
[44:08] the price on the cross of just death it
[44:11] opened the door for us to have access
[44:14] now to the power of the cross I want to
[44:18] entitle this to the divine power of the
[44:21] cross I I believe there's power today
[44:25] that we have access all because of
[44:27] Calvary amen now the cross did not make
[44:30] us born
[44:32] again the cross only made a way for us
[44:35] to become born
[44:36] again and today we must work out our own
[44:39] salvation with fear and trembling and
[44:42] I'll say like this the more we fear the
[44:44] more we tremble the more we search the
[44:46] scriptures the more we want to be sure
[44:48] the more accurate we're going to get
[44:50] it but the more we think well this is
[44:52] the way I think it should be and this is
[44:53] the way we're going to run our home and
[44:55] this what you know what we're going to
[44:56] miss it
[44:59] it we got to become completely Born
[45:02] Again into the divine nature of God
[45:06] Amen the cross was
[45:10] the the only way provided for us to
[45:14] receive
[45:15] salvation the Bible says without the
[45:17] shedding of the blood there is no
[45:19] remission of sins so we could say
[45:21] without the shedding of the blood
[45:23] there's no salvation there's no healing
[45:24] there's no Deliverance there's no nature
[45:26] change without the
[45:29] cross now it's funny to me how how
[45:31] people can just say you know I believe
[45:33] in the cross I believe in the salvation
[45:35] but they don't believe in the nature
[45:40] change I question whether they believe
[45:42] in
[45:43] Salvation And I have a right to do
[45:45] because there are things that accompany
[45:48] salvation without the shedding of God's
[45:51] own blood there's no peace that passeth
[45:53] all understanding there's no joy
[45:55] unspeakable and full of Glory
[45:58] there's no way to love others actually
[46:00] the way that Christ loved us because he
[46:02] told us to love others the way he loved
[46:04] us and I can't love others with my own
[46:07] carnal fial love I need the agape love
[46:10] of
[46:12] God the shedding of God's own blood
[46:15] opened the door to the promises of God
[46:18] for our lives and inside inside the
[46:21] cross is hidden the treasures or the
[46:24] power to become just like Jesus
[46:27] Jesus most people I don't think they're
[46:29] really interested in that right I I mean
[46:33] they wouldn't mind it so bad if they
[46:35] didn't have to give up anything right
[46:37] they wouldn't have to Die daily crucify
[46:39] the flesh they you know kind of admit
[46:43] that part of their their their nature is
[46:45] wrong their life is wrong and to to take
[46:47] a stand against
[46:50] it I love this scripture and I want to
[46:52] dig into it today 1 Corinthians 1:18 our
[46:54] opening scripture for the preaching of
[46:56] the
[46:57] cross is to them that perish foolishness
[47:02] but unto us which are saved it is the
[47:05] power of God now there's a lot into this
[47:09] this verse and I want I wanted to take
[47:11] it from the Amplified version so you
[47:13] just please forgive me if you don't
[47:15] believe in the Amplified version but it
[47:17] really brings out more of a light it
[47:20] says for the message of the Cross is
[47:22] foolishness or absurd or illogical to
[47:27] those who perish who are perishing and
[47:30] are spiritually dead because they've
[47:32] rejected it right but to us who are not
[47:38] saved but to us who are being saved I
[47:42] love that it
[47:45] is uh the manifestation of the power of
[47:48] God
[47:51] Amen in other words God's power is
[47:55] manifesting in the lives of of those who
[47:57] act upon the word each
[47:59] day if the word is real to them and they
[48:02] take God at his word then the word will
[48:05] become manifested in their
[48:07] lives and if all they do is they believe
[48:09] in some religion which is I believe this
[48:12] and fill in the blanket don't matter
[48:13] what it is it is just a religion it's
[48:15] just a covering and many people use this
[48:18] message as a covering but you cannot
[48:20] denominate the real message you can make
[48:24] it what you want to make it but God has
[48:25] made it what it is and it's a Living
[48:27] Word and God will stand behind the
[48:32] messag so it starts with
[48:35] faith only believe not not works now
[48:39] just obedience to what the word says
[48:41] that's the only
[48:44] work Jesus said in John 7:37 the last
[48:47] days that great day of the feast Jesus
[48:50] Took he stood and cried saying if any
[48:53] man thirst let him come unto me and
[48:59] drink now the thing is nobody's going to
[49:02] come to Jesus if they're not
[49:07] thirsty they're not going to drink so
[49:10] he's not speaking to them amen he's
[49:13] speaking to those who are hungry and
[49:15] those that are
[49:16] thirsty and he that believeth on me as
[49:20] the scripture have said there's the key
[49:24] he that believeth on me is the
[49:25] scriptures is not as as the Devils
[49:27] believe but as the scriptures say out of
[49:30] his belly you can't help it shall flow
[49:34] rivers of Living
[49:38] Water you can't help it when it's
[49:44] bubbling and people are going to see
[49:47] [Music]
[49:49] it for the message of the Cross is
[49:54] foolishness absurd ill logical to those
[49:59] who are presently
[50:01] perishing and spiritually dead because I
[50:05] love this reason because they have
[50:07] rejected
[50:09] it in other words it's all about free
[50:11] more
[50:13] agency you're going to reject the word
[50:16] or you going to receive
[50:19] it but to us who who are being saved did
[50:22] you know I'm being saved today amen it's
[50:25] exciting
[50:28] amen my salvation you know you can say
[50:31] well I was saved before the foundation
[50:32] of the world you can say I was Bor saved
[50:34] at cover and you can say well I was
[50:35] saved when I gave my heart to Christ but
[50:37] I'm telling you today I'm being
[50:39] saved and I I'm I'm proud of it I'm
[50:41] proud to say it
[50:43] because the the the claws of Satan are
[50:47] everywhere so Paul is speaking of two
[50:49] different groups here one group is just
[50:51] scoffing at God's sacrifice of the Cross
[50:54] and the other is is being saved today by
[50:57] it being saved today by
[51:00] it so one group says today is the day of
[51:06] salvation the other group says I don't
[51:09] need salvation today I'm already
[51:14] saved one group is working out their
[51:16] salvation with fear and trembling the
[51:19] other group feels there's really nothing
[51:20] to work out I'm
[51:23] saved one group is fighting the good
[51:26] fight of fath
[51:27] faith and the other is just kind of
[51:30] sitting back losing more of their faith
[51:34] every day and wondering why they're so
[51:39] weak one group is earnestly contending
[51:42] for the faith and the others just kind
[51:44] of put their their shield down their
[51:46] their sword
[51:47] down one group is holding the beginning
[51:50] of their confidence steadfast to the end
[51:52] and the other group well you know what
[51:55] they've just let go of that confidence
[51:57] and they begin to in their heart the
[52:00] Lord delayeth his coming I might as well
[52:02] just go do this and I might as well go
[52:03] do that and everything Remains the
[52:08] Same see two different
[52:11] groups one group is being saved today
[52:13] she is manifesting the divine power of
[52:16] the cross the other group is not letting
[52:18] the word save her from her situations
[52:20] that she's in she's refusing to manifest
[52:23] the power of God she just wants to just
[52:26] make some
[52:27] [Music]
[52:30] excuse and we just got to be I'm I'm I
[52:33] feel we just need to be honest with
[52:36] oursel just be real with yourself
[52:39] because that's the only way to get
[52:42] ahead one group doesn't believe the
[52:44] other group believes but but brother bam
[52:47] told us of a third group and this group
[52:50] acts like they believe that they really
[52:53] don't right they're a make believer amen
[52:57] they had still a form of godliness but
[53:01] they deny the power of the Cross
[53:05] yes there's no manifestation of the
[53:07] power of the cross in their life that
[53:09] actually changes their nature into the
[53:11] divine nature of
[53:14] God but they're still
[53:17] claiming still going to
[53:20] church but their their lives are really
[53:22] what are they manifesting they're
[53:24] manifesting they're in love with
[53:26] themselves
[53:27] still that was the thing we're supposed
[53:29] to be delivered
[53:31] from I did not have to teach my kids to
[53:35] love
[53:40] themselves I I just remember myself
[53:43] growing up in love with what I wanted to
[53:48] do the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[53:53] want the price that the father had
[53:56] required by his word was paid when Jesus
[53:59] said it is
[54:02] finished but there's still work to be
[54:05] done Jesus said you must you must go
[54:09] forward and get born again right it's
[54:12] finished but you must go forward and get
[54:14] born again a complete nature must take
[54:18] place to where all things are of God in
[54:21] your life is that the scripture let's
[54:25] say Amen to the word it's that this is
[54:26] not brother John preaching this is the
[54:28] word of
[54:29] God Jesus said follow me into the
[54:33] Regeneration he said I go to prepare a
[54:35] place for you when the Holy Ghost comes
[54:38] he will lead and guide you into all of
[54:40] the nature
[54:42] change he that truly believeth in me he
[54:45] said the works I do shall he do
[54:48] also Paul said we've been created unto
[54:52] good
[54:53] works so there's still a work to be
[54:57] done Jesus finished paying the price
[55:01] with the death of
[55:04] his In the
[55:07] Flesh he tasted death for every man the
[55:09] Bible
[55:12] says so we wouldn't have to be eternally
[55:15] separated from him but we need the power
[55:17] of the Cross daily to stay connected to
[55:20] him or we'll drift away and I'll say it
[55:23] like this to have our lives completely
[55:25] changed and I think brother Ry was
[55:27] telling me and I used to hear from
[55:29] Brother Johnson you you you go one day
[55:31] without praying and you know it you know
[55:34] it you go two days the kids know it or
[55:38] the wife knows it I'm sorry and you go
[55:40] three days and the dog even knows
[55:43] it so you know you can't just say well I
[55:46] still
[55:47] believe you you got to stay connected in
[55:50] the vine you still got to you you still
[55:52] got to say God take away this desire to
[55:56] want to please myself and help me to
[55:58] actually honor you as king of kings and
[56:01] Lord of lords and and the creator of
[56:03] everything that I look at and the birds
[56:05] help me to honor you and worship you too
[56:08] often we look at those things and we say
[56:10] man those are
[56:11] beautiful well to look at those things
[56:13] and say God you're
[56:16] beautiful because it took a beautiful
[56:18] God to make
[56:19] them there's no power without believing
[56:23] in the power of the cross I want you to
[56:25] remember that statement there is no
[56:26] power without believing in that power
[56:30] the power of the Cross cannot be
[56:32] activated in your life unless you're
[56:33] trusting the word for you it's all of us
[56:36] can say I believe the
[56:39] word but can you say I will believe this
[56:42] word because I believe something's going
[56:44] to happen in my life because that's what
[56:47] the word is for if none go with me still
[56:50] I'll follow amen we've got to believe
[56:53] without faith it's impossible to please
[56:56] God God
[56:58] impossible second Peter uh 1: uh 3-7 I
[57:04] just want to read these uh We've read
[57:06] these before and I think it's good to be
[57:08] reminded of these because we're talking
[57:11] about the divine power of of God and
[57:15] it's hidden in the cross and I I'll just
[57:18] say it like this when
[57:20] Jesus finished the work what it did is
[57:23] it opened the door now for the promises
[57:25] of God to come to pass in your life
[57:28] right that's what it did without Calvary
[57:31] we wouldn't have access to the Holy
[57:38] Ghost we just do our best to try to be a
[57:41] good person well we know how far that
[57:43] would
[57:45] go second Peter chapter 1:3 according as
[57:48] his divine power has given unto us all
[57:52] things that pertaineth unto life and
[57:55] godliness
[57:56] through the knowledge of him that have
[57:58] called us to glory and virtue so where
[58:01] have you been called
[58:03] to okay I I didn't get to hear the
[58:06] message that Brother Bruce preached on
[58:08] Wednesday but I heard it was a good
[58:10] messag amen and the thing is you all if
[58:14] we all go back to the beginning when we
[58:16] were
[58:18] called we were called to him we were not
[58:21] called to be part of a church right part
[58:24] of a group part of the the brandom
[58:27] nightes we were called to
[58:30] Christ to be his
[58:32] wife and I'll say it like this it's
[58:35] glory and
[58:38] virtue now according to his divine power
[58:41] have given unto us all things that
[58:43] pertain unto this life unto godliness
[58:46] unto the through the knowledge of him
[58:48] that called us so now we got to dig in
[58:50] the scriptures search the scriptures
[58:52] find out what this knowledge is how we
[58:54] can become like him amen now whereby are
[58:58] given unto you and I exceeding great
[59:02] they're not little baby promises they're
[59:04] exceeding great and precious promises
[59:08] that by these we might be partakers of
[59:13] what a divine nature now it's starting
[59:16] to talk about how we Act Right how we
[59:20] handle
[59:21] things what how we're going to react
[59:24] when the pressure comes on us
[59:29] if the divine nature comes out or our
[59:31] old nature comes
[59:32] [Music]
[59:33] out having escaped the corruption that
[59:37] is in the world through lust and besides
[59:40] this giving all diligence I mean effort
[59:43] effort add add add
[59:48] add
[59:52] add you know certain things are easy to
[59:55] add right
[59:57] like
[59:58] calories no effort because there's a
[1:00:02] natural a natural
[1:00:05] appetite soon as that chocolate bar hits
[1:00:08] my
[1:00:09] tongue I mean it just sets me in a rage
[1:00:12] for another
[1:00:15] bite now if I want to start eating
[1:00:18] healthier I I I mean that takes
[1:00:21] effort I mean if I'm going to add Health
[1:00:24] to my life is it's going to take more
[1:00:26] than a few
[1:00:28] pills and and and it's going to take
[1:00:30] more than just a couple
[1:00:32] prayers I'm going to have to be willing
[1:00:34] to say no five candy bars is too
[1:00:38] much I'll start cutting down to
[1:00:41] four and then three and then two but you
[1:00:45] see you got to keep adding you got to
[1:00:47] keep adding to that divine nature it
[1:00:49] don't just come with the calendar how
[1:00:51] long you've been in the message it comes
[1:00:53] with you adding to it you working you
[1:00:55] believing amen that you are going to
[1:00:57] become just like Jesus and it needs to
[1:00:59] be your heart's
[1:01:01] desire it won't happen with just a
[1:01:06] desire because I believe everybody that
[1:01:09] came out of Egypt wanted the Promise
[1:01:12] Land I believe that but there's only two
[1:01:16] that had a different
[1:01:19] spirit and what was different about
[1:01:21] their Spirit they wholly followed the
[1:01:25] Lord Amen in other words they kept
[1:01:27] adding kept adding kept adding whatever
[1:01:31] God told them to do they just added it
[1:01:33] to their to to their life I will do this
[1:01:35] I will do that I will go here I will
[1:01:37] obey this we got some Christians
[1:01:40] nowadays all they want to do is go to
[1:01:41] church when it's convenient for him
[1:01:43] right and that ought to be good
[1:01:46] enough well I think that's good enough
[1:01:48] for a
[1:01:49] tribulation I'll say it like it is
[1:01:52] because if you're going to make this
[1:01:53] Rapture you're going to have to put
[1:01:55] everything you got in into
[1:02:00] it brother John I don't know that's
[1:02:02] that's pretty
[1:02:06] strong I'd rather have you hate me now
[1:02:08] and love me
[1:02:10] then you'll never regret giving your All
[1:02:13] to
[1:02:15] Jesus our minds must accept the promises
[1:02:18] of God the word of God for our lives we
[1:02:21] can't just say it's true and then and
[1:02:23] then don't accept it don't because if
[1:02:25] you don't won keep adding to your life
[1:02:28] these virtues how will your nature ever
[1:02:33] change and I'll say it like this it
[1:02:35] starts in our
[1:02:38] mind our mind that's why we're here at
[1:02:40] church to receive the word and into our
[1:02:42] mind into our
[1:02:44] hearts we need the mind of Christ
[1:02:48] amen Paul said let this
[1:02:51] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:02:54] Jesus
[1:02:56] what kind of mind did he have he humbled
[1:02:58] himself to obey all the word
[1:03:01] yeah to become a servant to live for
[1:03:06] others well you know what I I I've got
[1:03:09] these you
[1:03:15] know I don't think people are interested
[1:03:19] in the mind of
[1:03:21] Christ it's like they want to
[1:03:24] claim there
[1:03:27] something but they're not willing to
[1:03:30] fight for the mind of Christ to fight
[1:03:34] for the
[1:03:35] nature but they'll fight because this is
[1:03:37] where they
[1:03:41] stand I want to fight the good fight of
[1:03:43] Faith that's that's the
[1:03:46] fight we'll never get the mind of Christ
[1:03:49] without really wanting it bad
[1:03:51] enough we've got to press into it we got
[1:03:54] to have that spirit that presses into to
[1:03:56] it we got we have to start dismissing
[1:03:58] our carnal mind that that mind that God
[1:04:01] hates the Bible says he hates the carnal
[1:04:03] mind it's enmity with him we got to be
[1:04:07] willing to start working at casting down
[1:04:10] reasonings that say oh no you don't need
[1:04:12] to go to
[1:04:14] church no you don't have to do
[1:04:16] that look if you don't cast that down
[1:04:20] you're never going to
[1:04:21] change you can't expect God to come and
[1:04:24] just Bless you that's right and start
[1:04:26] serving him that don't work like that
[1:04:29] we've got all the opportunity that he
[1:04:31] I'll tell you if we all died right this
[1:04:32] second we God don't owe us one thing
[1:04:34] that's
[1:04:37] right but we've got to cast down the
[1:04:39] doubts that the devil gives us cast down
[1:04:41] the
[1:04:42] excuses cast down everything that exalts
[1:04:46] itself against the knowledge of God the
[1:04:49] knowledge of the cross the cross was to
[1:04:52] bring us to a nature change
[1:04:59] we originally born with a nature that
[1:05:01] doesn't even believe in the nature of
[1:05:04] God I tell you when I was in the
[1:05:07] world and somebody told
[1:05:09] me you know you need to stop doing that
[1:05:12] you you you need to realize
[1:05:15] that God serving God is is more than
[1:05:18] just going to a Catholic church and
[1:05:20] doing what you want to do and you know
[1:05:22] what that just didn't you know that
[1:05:24] didn't turn me on
[1:05:26] I wasn't excited about that because I
[1:05:29] know I could go to the Catholic church
[1:05:32] and and and still do what I want to do
[1:05:34] in the
[1:05:36] world because the the preacher never
[1:05:38] told me to
[1:05:40] change so there was there was nothing
[1:05:42] there being
[1:05:44] convicted but when I heard the
[1:05:47] word when I heard the rest of the
[1:05:52] word then I began to get stirred and
[1:05:54] start searching for the truth
[1:05:58] amen we must die to that thinking daily
[1:06:01] and take God at his word amen change it
[1:06:05] starts with changing the way we think
[1:06:08] and what's so beautiful about this is
[1:06:10] that we can do that right this
[1:06:13] second we don't have to wait till we
[1:06:15] leave
[1:06:16] church I love what uh James Allen or
[1:06:20] alen James said the greatest discovery
[1:06:23] of any generation is the man can Al
[1:06:25] alter his life by altering his
[1:06:27] attitude or the way that he
[1:06:30] thinks so it starts in the mind God
[1:06:34] cannot and will not work against our
[1:06:36] Free Will and that's why our minds have
[1:06:37] to change we must accept the word into
[1:06:40] our minds and allow it to change our
[1:06:43] attitudes brother Brandon said that our
[1:06:45] mind is the womb to our soul right and
[1:06:48] our soul is the nature of our
[1:06:51] spirit so if we don't change our mind
[1:06:56] if we don't change the way we think then
[1:07:00] how is our how is our nature going to
[1:07:02] ever get
[1:07:03] changed it's so
[1:07:07] simple our nature must keep on
[1:07:10] changing until All Things become God now
[1:07:13] that's our goal we can't lose track of
[1:07:17] that we're not a group that believes in
[1:07:19] Two
[1:07:20] Souls we're a group that believes in one
[1:07:23] Soul that's converted from an ungodly
[1:07:26] nature to the nature of God that's what
[1:07:27] we
[1:07:28] are so in other words we believe in the
[1:07:31] power of transformation
[1:07:36] amen it changes the selfish nature into
[1:07:39] the divine nature of God and it happens
[1:07:41] as we accept the word of God into our
[1:07:45] mind and we
[1:07:47] say I want this for my life
[1:07:51] yes if we're only going to be satisfied
[1:07:53] with just coming to church
[1:07:59] and really never have a drive to
[1:08:01] change do you know there's a
[1:08:05] greater a greater damnation
[1:08:09] coming and I it's happening on a daily
[1:08:12] basis that you listen to this statement
[1:08:14] brother brandham said a man never leaves
[1:08:17] the sanctuary the same way he came in
[1:08:25] he is either drawn closer to God right
[1:08:29] and that closer could be this simple
[1:08:31] Lord I Repent of my past that's closer
[1:08:34] to
[1:08:35] God or you're further away because you
[1:08:39] don't feel you should have to do all
[1:08:41] that
[1:08:42] stuff now you you may feel like you're
[1:08:45] the same but in reality to God you're
[1:08:48] closer or further
[1:08:50] away and to whom much is given much is
[1:08:54] required now here's the scary we we need
[1:08:57] all the word to make a rapture we do now
[1:09:01] the downside is if you don't want all
[1:09:03] the word it's going to be much
[1:09:12] greater what is left after the word what
[1:09:15] is left there is no there is no Grace
[1:09:17] outside
[1:09:20] God whereby are given unto us
[1:09:24] great exceeding great and precious
[1:09:26] promises that by these we might be
[1:09:28] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:09:30] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:09:32] world through
[1:09:34] lust this happens now
[1:09:37] one thought at a
[1:09:40] time one thought comes in your head this
[1:09:42] is how it happens one thought one minute
[1:09:46] at a time one hour at a time one day at
[1:09:48] a time and you begin to
[1:09:51] change by taking control of your mind
[1:09:54] see here's the biggest problem in the
[1:09:56] world the world has gone crazy
[1:10:01] right they don't care about the
[1:10:03] Constitution they don't care about God
[1:10:05] they don't care and they don't even care
[1:10:08] that they're
[1:10:12] wrong they are so used to letting their
[1:10:14] minds just think whatever they want to
[1:10:16] think there's no control of their mind
[1:10:19] if I could say it like this a mind that
[1:10:21] has no control is out of
[1:10:23] control and it's not not
[1:10:26] sound you can't depend on it that's why
[1:10:30] you cannot depend on yourself am but you
[1:10:33] can depend on God Amen and he don't want
[1:10:36] us to depend on ourself that's right he
[1:10:39] don't want us to say you know I'm going
[1:10:41] to take us
[1:10:43] through no he wants to say God he just
[1:10:46] tell you a real man a real man gets on
[1:10:48] his knees and he says I can't make it
[1:10:50] without God I'm going to look to him
[1:10:53] that's a man
[1:10:55] anything short of that is not a
[1:10:58] man Romans 12: 2 and be not conformed to
[1:11:03] this
[1:11:04] world don't let the world just you know
[1:11:08] draw you in that direction because
[1:11:10] there's a big poll in the
[1:11:11] world but be ye transformed how do we do
[1:11:15] this how do I become transformed by the
[1:11:18] renewing or the renovating of your mind
[1:11:26] we renovated no brother Stan renovated
[1:11:28] this
[1:11:32] room sister Amanda's uh room is being
[1:11:36] renovated right
[1:11:39] now what you do is you take something
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:43] isn't what it is at that point and you
[1:11:46] bring it back to where it should
[1:11:49] be so you renovate it you go through the
[1:11:52] process of taking out the old and
[1:11:54] putting in the good but but how does
[1:11:56] this happen is in your mind you have to
[1:11:58] make different decisions I'm not going
[1:12:00] to think about that I'm not going to do
[1:12:02] that I'm not going to go in that
[1:12:03] direction I'm going to put God first and
[1:12:05] that is how you become transformed it's
[1:12:08] in your
[1:12:09] fingertips God is already paid the price
[1:12:13] it is finished we have access to the
[1:12:16] divine power that's in the Cross by
[1:12:18] simply taking the word and believing it
[1:12:20] for what it
[1:12:23] says amen
[1:12:28] I love the rest of this that ye may
[1:12:32] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:12:37] and perfect will of
[1:12:39] God there's only one will that's
[1:12:41] acceptable to God that's his perfect
[1:12:45] will and it's
[1:12:48] good it's good just like everything God
[1:12:51] created he said it's good his will is
[1:12:54] good and it's the only will that's good
[1:12:57] my will is
[1:12:58] perverted
[1:13:04] amen well I love the word this
[1:13:09] morning the divine power of the Cross
[1:13:12] gives us access to God's
[1:13:15] grace we do not have to listen anymore
[1:13:18] to the devil we don't have to just take
[1:13:20] all the thoughts that come into our mind
[1:13:22] and say yeah they're true no we can try
[1:13:25] the spirit see if it be of God and the
[1:13:27] ones that are not I resist you devil I
[1:13:30] will give my life to God I will they
[1:13:32] that are pure right have this hope that
[1:13:36] they're going to be like Christ one day
[1:13:38] and they take their mind and they say
[1:13:40] I'm going to start being better today
[1:13:41] than I was
[1:13:43] yesterday because when we're in the
[1:13:45] world we just actually don't care what
[1:13:47] we think about we don't care what we say
[1:13:49] we don't care how we treat people we
[1:13:50] just don't
[1:13:52] care you cross me and I'll cry CR
[1:13:56] you you look at me and
[1:13:59] I'll
[1:14:02] Christians
[1:14:04] Christians that's not
[1:14:08] Christlike and that's why I don't want a
[1:14:11] form I want the genuine amen I want the
[1:14:14] real thing
[1:14:16] amen and how do I know I got the real
[1:14:18] thing I get up tomorrow and I do it
[1:14:21] again and if I fall I get back up I say
[1:14:24] sorry Lord and I do it
[1:14:27] again I don't I don't put my name in a
[1:14:29] book I don't say spoken tongues I don't
[1:14:33] do this thing I got baptized no I look
[1:14:35] at my life I look at my life and it
[1:14:37] tells me where I'm going it tells me
[1:14:39] where I'm at
[1:14:43] right because I've searched the
[1:14:47] scriptures you don't have to think
[1:14:50] about thinking we're something arrogant
[1:14:53] proud
[1:14:55] unthankful self-centered we can be
[1:14:58] transformed by simply accepting the word
[1:15:01] of God into our mind by saying I don't
[1:15:03] want to be like that
[1:15:05] anymore I don't want to do that I don't
[1:15:08] want to hurt I don't want to I don't I
[1:15:10] don't want to be selfish anymore I
[1:15:12] actually want to love God more than I do
[1:15:14] he gave his life for
[1:15:16] me you just accept that into your
[1:15:20] Minden you think about it you begin to
[1:15:24] let it mean more to you than it did
[1:15:27] yesterday and then it drops down into
[1:15:29] your
[1:15:32] heart that's when it becomes real amen
[1:15:35] is when it drops down into your
[1:15:38] heart but it's hard to have something in
[1:15:40] your your heart if your mind is over
[1:15:42] there all the time you understand that's
[1:15:45] how the devil here you take a Christian
[1:15:47] he's just walking with the Lord he's
[1:15:48] real strong he's going to do this I want
[1:15:50] to help and you know he's real strong
[1:15:52] for a while and then all of a sudden
[1:15:53] he's way over here
[1:15:55] how did that
[1:15:56] happen it did not happen
[1:16:00] overnight it didn't happen because one
[1:16:02] bad thing happened to him and he fell
[1:16:04] that's not how it
[1:16:06] happens it happens
[1:16:09] because the he begins to slip in his
[1:16:15] dedication I don't you know I God before
[1:16:19] you know it you keep doing that and God
[1:16:22] just what you're doing is you're
[1:16:23] grieving the Holy Ghost
[1:16:25] right and before you know you're over
[1:16:28] here and you're just going to church but
[1:16:29] nothing's
[1:16:30] happening are you with me I I think some
[1:16:33] you ought to jump up and say I love the
[1:16:35] word of
[1:16:36] God because the word of God is the only
[1:16:39] thing that can help our lives we come
[1:16:41] here to come to to let the word discern
[1:16:44] what's really happening inside of us and
[1:16:46] I understand that my shoe is not going
[1:16:48] to fit every one of
[1:16:49] you but I believe that God's going to
[1:16:52] preach all sizes here
[1:16:55] before we leave I believe there's a shoe
[1:16:57] to fit
[1:16:58] us and we all want the same thing is
[1:17:00] that right we all want to be closer to
[1:17:02] God we all want to make a Rapture that
[1:17:04] that's all of our testimony we want that
[1:17:07] amen we become transformed by simply
[1:17:10] accepting God's word into our mind we
[1:17:11] begin to meditate upon it day and
[1:17:15] night yes we feed on the word we just
[1:17:18] don't well you know say our prayers
[1:17:22] before no
[1:17:25] the word means something to you there's
[1:17:27] a there's you you you honor this you
[1:17:30] honor it you respect it you fear it you
[1:17:34] know you can't live without it just like
[1:17:36] the children of Israel they were fed
[1:17:38] from Heaven the bread that came down a
[1:17:42] type of feeding on Christ
[1:17:45] daily and having the attitude you cannot
[1:17:49] just eat the word today and not eat it
[1:17:52] tomorrow
[1:17:55] you got to eat it fresh every day and if
[1:17:59] we sincerely do this we sincerely do
[1:18:02] this I believe we be able to our life
[1:18:05] our life will prove what is that good
[1:18:08] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:18:09] before you know your spouse is going to
[1:18:10] be saying what is going on with
[1:18:13] you people at work are going to be
[1:18:16] saying why are you so
[1:18:19] happy you know it's one thing to go into
[1:18:21] a
[1:18:22] restaurant and you know put on your BT
[1:18:26] Duds but it's another thing to live it
[1:18:28] in your
[1:18:30] home now I tell you you want a better
[1:18:32] Church which we all do Let's Get Better
[1:18:37] Homes let's make some sacrifices at home
[1:18:40] so we can get like a
[1:18:42] burden you know instead of coming to
[1:18:44] church all selfish about
[1:18:46] me come on I'm going to preach it
[1:18:49] whether you like it or not I'm going to
[1:18:50] preach it we ought to be Christians that
[1:18:52] live for others amen right that care
[1:18:55] about others that we we're interested in
[1:18:58] the welfare of others not com to church
[1:19:00] and say well you better just do your job
[1:19:02] up there and help me if you don't
[1:19:03] encourage me it's a bad
[1:19:13] service the word can never be
[1:19:17] bad the spirit behind what is said can
[1:19:21] be
[1:19:22] bad but not the word
[1:19:26] amen word's the word verse three for I
[1:19:30] say through the grace given unto me to
[1:19:33] every man that is among you so I'm
[1:19:35] speaking to all the men here women
[1:19:38] you're off the
[1:19:39] hook for I say through the grace given
[1:19:42] unto me to every man that is among
[1:19:46] you first thing not to think of yourself
[1:19:50] more
[1:19:51] highly than you ought to think
[1:19:58] don't think you're better than somebody
[1:20:00] else don't think you're you're more
[1:20:04] capable so you don't have to humble
[1:20:06] yourself to God's word don't think you
[1:20:08] don't need to follow the word don't
[1:20:10] think you you don't need to do certain
[1:20:12] things that the word says don't think
[1:20:15] more highly than you ought to
[1:20:21] think according okay but got to think
[1:20:26] soberly amen so I remember when I was
[1:20:30] drunk Brother Bruce I couldn't think
[1:20:33] straight and I remember my dad trying to
[1:20:35] trick me to see if I was drunk or not
[1:20:37] and I tried so hard to answer his
[1:20:40] questions to prove I had a sober mind
[1:20:44] when I wasn't
[1:20:46] sober you think
[1:20:50] different and a Christian who's not
[1:20:52] filled with the spirit walking in the
[1:20:54] spirit
[1:20:55] he does not have a sober
[1:20:58] mind you can't just act like you got a
[1:21:01] sober mind and think you got a sober
[1:21:04] mind a sober mind comes from
[1:21:08] God to think soberly how is that
[1:21:12] according as God has dealt to every man
[1:21:14] The Measure of Faith now what is faith
[1:21:16] faith is when God speaks to you
[1:21:18] personally and whatever God has spoken
[1:21:21] to you that is how you think in other
[1:21:24] words come to church you hear the word
[1:21:25] of God God speaks to you you don't leave
[1:21:27] here and say well I just forgot that it
[1:21:29] was a good service we'll have a good day
[1:21:31] see you later God bless you no you take
[1:21:33] and you live you think soberly you think
[1:21:36] according to the faith that he spoke to
[1:21:38] you in that
[1:21:39] service because he wants you to carry it
[1:21:42] out don't think for a second God wants
[1:21:45] you to sit here in your nature not to
[1:21:47] get changed that might be what you want
[1:21:49] but that is not the mind of
[1:21:53] God we need the fear of God we need to
[1:21:55] get moved by the Holy
[1:22:03] Ghost you'll never regret
[1:22:06] it your flesh May hate it but your soul
[1:22:18] inside don't think of yourself more
[1:22:21] highly than you ought to
[1:22:23] think think
[1:22:25] soberly second Timothy 1:7 For God has
[1:22:29] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[1:22:32] power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:22:37] that's
[1:22:40] soberly because Jesus went to the Cross
[1:22:43] now you have access to the power of
[1:22:48] love the power of a sound mind
[1:22:55] but you have to be the one that says I'm
[1:22:57] not going to be wishy-washy anymore I'm
[1:23:00] not going to do my will God's will my
[1:23:02] will God's will my will God's
[1:23:05] will I'm going to actually pay attention
[1:23:07] to what God's speaking to me at church
[1:23:09] and I'm going to leave the
[1:23:13] building and I'm going to please God
[1:23:19] Amen God has given you the spirit of
[1:23:22] aound mind you're God is not giving the
[1:23:24] spirit of fear well I don't know if I
[1:23:26] can do this I you know I'm just afraid
[1:23:27] if I try then you know I'll blow up and
[1:23:29] you know so why should I just even try
[1:23:32] that's a spirit of fear on you that is
[1:23:35] absolutely a spirit of
[1:23:39] fear I'm gonna tell you a spirit of
[1:23:41] Faith a spirit of faith says when you
[1:23:44] fall seven times seven times you're
[1:23:45] going to get back up I am not afraid of
[1:23:51] falling if I was afraid of falling
[1:23:55] I wouldn't even be
[1:23:57] trying because I know I'm going to fall
[1:24:00] I know it what did the prophet mean
[1:24:03] about backsliding under times a day I
[1:24:05] think we just need to gain control of
[1:24:07] our
[1:24:08] minds think soberly think sound God give
[1:24:11] me God gave me this promise I receive it
[1:24:15] I got a sound
[1:24:17] mind I'll tell you when you got a sound
[1:24:22] mind how many would want to buy a brand
[1:24:25] new
[1:24:30] car and put spaghetti sauce in the gas
[1:24:36] tank you don't want that
[1:24:40] garbage why would we want or allow the
[1:24:43] thoughts of the devil to entertain us in
[1:24:45] our mind we got a sound
[1:24:48] mind but you know what it don't stay
[1:24:51] sound You're The Keeper of the house
[1:24:55] amen you're the
[1:24:57] keeper you're the one that
[1:25:00] chooses want the word or it doesn't
[1:25:03] matter if I don't have the word and I
[1:25:04] tell you when you have that
[1:25:07] attitude you're going down your
[1:25:10] spiritual life is going
[1:25:13] down the more you don't have
[1:25:16] boundaries or the more you make
[1:25:18] boundaries I'm going to tell you I'm
[1:25:19] going to tell you about your
[1:25:21] boundaries your boundaries are up and
[1:25:24] down every one of us here because
[1:25:27] they're based on
[1:25:30] emotions that's why one minute you can
[1:25:32] love somebody and the next minute you
[1:25:34] just I can't I I want to talk to them
[1:25:37] anymore
[1:25:42] right that's not a sound
[1:25:44] mine sound mine is I love them all the
[1:25:47] time amen no matter how they treat
[1:25:51] me praise the Lord
[1:25:57] thank you
[1:25:59] Jesus God has given us the power of a
[1:26:03] sign sound mind but it's our
[1:26:05] responsibility to keep it sober we've
[1:26:09] got to cast down our negative thinking
[1:26:11] yes I don't like what he
[1:26:14] said take a moment and find out is that
[1:26:18] what he said or is that what God
[1:26:21] Said any any thought that would kind of
[1:26:24] puff you up and exalt you and make you
[1:26:26] feel like you're something better than
[1:26:27] some you got to cast that down right
[1:26:31] through the cross we have the power to
[1:26:33] Humble ourselves in the sight of the
[1:26:35] lord we and we have the promise that he
[1:26:37] will exalt Us in due
[1:26:44] season he that exalteth himself shall be
[1:26:48] abased he that humbles himself shall be
[1:26:50] exalted right amen the way up Up Is
[1:26:55] Down a cross gives us access to God turn
[1:27:00] with me if you would to Romans chapter 5
[1:27:02] verses one and two and we're not going
[1:27:04] to be able to get through everything you
[1:27:06] know I good thing I didn't say you know
[1:27:08] I just want to take my time this morning
[1:27:11] and U go an extra hour or to can you can
[1:27:14] you
[1:27:16] imagine I I I I try so hard to just only
[1:27:20] do but it just never never happen so you
[1:27:23] know when you pray for me just make it
[1:27:25] part of your prayer Lord let it be you
[1:27:28] know condensed when brother John is
[1:27:30] ministering like condensed milk you know
[1:27:33] you get a whole gallon in a can you know
[1:27:34] what I'm
[1:27:37] saying all right the cherubin have been
[1:27:40] ordered to step back and let everyone
[1:27:43] that is of a humble and contrite spirit
[1:27:45] come to Christ did you know that Romans
[1:27:48] 51 therefore being justified by faith we
[1:27:52] have peace with God through the Lord
[1:27:54] Jesus Christ by whom also we have
[1:28:00] access access by faith into this grace
[1:28:06] wherein we
[1:28:10] stand and we rejoice in the hope of the
[1:28:14] glory of
[1:28:18] God so whatever your life needs whatever
[1:28:21] you're
[1:28:22] Desiring you have access by faith into
[1:28:28] God's
[1:28:29] Grace Grace is all we need Grace is what
[1:28:32] saved
[1:28:33] us we didn't we didn't ask God to come
[1:28:37] down from glory to save us right it
[1:28:39] wasn't in our minds it wasn't in our
[1:28:41] thoughts it was
[1:28:43] Grace and today he has Grace for us
[1:28:47] whatever our needs whatever our desire
[1:28:49] is that we want God to have in our lives
[1:28:54] he's given us
[1:29:02] access he's asked us to come boldly
[1:29:05] Before the
[1:29:08] Throne the scripture tells us there is
[1:29:11] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:29:13] Christ Jesus who
[1:29:14] walk not after the
[1:29:17] flesh but after the spirit
[1:29:20] right now the key here is your motive
[1:29:24] when you take your
[1:29:26] step has to be I want to walk with Jesus
[1:29:30] amen I want to do his will I want to
[1:29:33] treat people I want to love people I
[1:29:36] want to reach out to people
[1:29:39] am to a person whose heart and mind is
[1:29:43] in that Spirit of
[1:29:46] thinking there's no
[1:29:50] condemnation but if we're in a mindset
[1:29:53] well I don't really need to do that it's
[1:29:55] not church church is in it to Wednesday
[1:29:57] I can kind of do what I want to
[1:29:59] do well then there's going to be
[1:30:00] condemnation in your
[1:30:03] mind are you with
[1:30:06] me we have to be willing to walk after
[1:30:09] Christ we just can't sit around we have
[1:30:12] a work to
[1:30:15] do John
[1:30:17] 628 then said they unto him what shall
[1:30:22] we do that we might work the works of
[1:30:26] God I want to work the works of God what
[1:30:28] do I got to do and Jesus answered and
[1:30:31] said to them this is the work of God
[1:30:35] that you believe on him who have
[1:30:38] sent and if you believe as the scripture
[1:30:41] said that you will keep
[1:30:43] adding you will keep you you will add
[1:30:46] because you believe in the power of the
[1:30:51] Cross God works when we work
[1:30:55] the gospel works if we believe
[1:30:59] it brother briam said in the message my
[1:31:02] new minist my new ministry he says when
[1:31:05] he looked upon the apostles and he
[1:31:07] looked upon the Harvest he said the
[1:31:09] Harvest is ripe and the laborers are few
[1:31:12] pray the Lord of the Harvest that he
[1:31:15] will send laborers into the Harvest he
[1:31:17] says how many remember that well why
[1:31:20] would you have to pray to the Lord of
[1:31:22] the Harvest to send laborers into the
[1:31:24] Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was
[1:31:26] standing there knowing it would be done
[1:31:30] why God has so arranged it amen we put
[1:31:35] up that that that that quote there God
[1:31:38] has so arranged it that his well you
[1:31:41] just listen to this God has so arranged
[1:31:43] it that his program cannot move without
[1:31:47] you and I
[1:31:49] yes and as long as we're not doing what
[1:31:52] God leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[1:31:57] program but when the church moves by the
[1:32:00] anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are
[1:32:03] in God's will doing his
[1:32:06] program so we have a work to
[1:32:10] do when God speaks I'll just say God is
[1:32:14] not a God that when he speaks he doesn't
[1:32:17] care what you do he is a God that let
[1:32:20] you do what you want to do but his will
[1:32:23] is for us to do what he tells us to
[1:32:26] do and if we don't do what he tells us
[1:32:29] to do you paralyze God in your
[1:32:33] life how is God gonna how is if you
[1:32:37] belong to God now if you belong to God
[1:32:39] how is God going to bless you he's not
[1:32:42] going to now if you don't belong to God
[1:32:44] he may Bless you that's
[1:32:47] right that's right because he prospers
[1:32:50] the wicked right that it certainly but
[1:32:53] the thing is it's not about getting
[1:32:54] blessed or not getting blessed it's
[1:32:57] really about walking with Christ by
[1:33:00] loving your husband that's what it's all
[1:33:04] about we have to believe enough to put
[1:33:06] our faith into action 1 Thessalonians
[1:33:09] 2:13 maybe we just have to wrap this up
[1:33:11] real quick for this cause also thank we
[1:33:16] god without ceasing because when you
[1:33:19] received the word of God which you heard
[1:33:22] of us you receed received it not as it
[1:33:26] was the word of just
[1:33:30] men but as it is in truth it's the word
[1:33:33] of God now there it is right here which
[1:33:38] effectually
[1:33:39] worketh also in you that belief so it
[1:33:43] worked in the apostles it worked in
[1:33:46] Paul but it'll work in you too if you
[1:33:51] believe we're transformed by accepting
[1:33:54] the word into our
[1:33:56] mind pondering it long enough that it
[1:33:59] drops into our heart and says God I want
[1:34:01] this for my
[1:34:02] life and then it begins to work out and
[1:34:05] becomes
[1:34:06] manifested and that is the power the
[1:34:10] divine power of the Cross amen there are
[1:34:14] so many scriptures that we're just going
[1:34:16] to like let them go let's
[1:34:18] stand
[1:34:21] together last one 2 Corinthians 3
[1:34:26] 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:34:30] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:34:38] Liberty the
[1:34:40] Lord doesn't go where he's not
[1:34:44] welcomed amen he goes where he feels a
[1:34:47] liberty to be there
[1:34:51] am we had brother jera Jeremiah over our
[1:34:54] house yesterday praise the Lord he's
[1:34:56] helping us
[1:34:58] and we did everything that we could to
[1:35:02] let him know you're welcome come come
[1:35:05] come whatever you want stay for dinner
[1:35:09] we shot shot some
[1:35:12] hoops we wanted him to have
[1:35:16] Liberty so he would feel
[1:35:21] welcome if we turn down part of God's
[1:35:25] word we not giv him
[1:35:29] Liberty so by us worship and say God
[1:35:32] come into my heart Come Into My Heart
[1:35:34] Lord give me all of your word help me to
[1:35:35] live it you're giving God
[1:35:38] Liberty are you with me now the Lord is
[1:35:41] that Spirit where're the spirit of the
[1:35:42] Lord is there's liberty but we all with
[1:35:45] open face beholding as a glass the glory
[1:35:50] of the
[1:35:51] Lord we're changed into the very same
[1:35:55] image of Jesus Christ from glory to
[1:35:59] glory even as by the spirit of the Lord
[1:36:04] amen we need the Holy Spirit I'm going
[1:36:07] to tell you you know what the the holy
[1:36:08] spirit is it is this
[1:36:12] word this is the holy
[1:36:15] spirit when and this is it so often we
[1:36:18] want more Holy Ghost
[1:36:22] right it's like sometimes we want the
[1:36:24] Holy Ghost without obeying the word and
[1:36:27] that's I'm say this is this is so easy
[1:36:31] when you receive the
[1:36:33] word just one word you can't receive
[1:36:36] that word without receiving the Holy
[1:36:39] Ghost because they're one and the same
[1:36:42] now I know we're going after a a
[1:36:44] fullness of the Holy Ghost I understand
[1:36:46] that but look sometimes it comes a drop
[1:36:49] at a time a word at a time a scripture
[1:36:50] at a time a service at a time
[1:36:55] but don't try to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:36:57] without receiving the word that'll just
[1:36:59] grieve the Lord give them Liberty
[1:37:02] receive the word into your heart amen
[1:37:06] amen let's bow our hearts and we'll sing
[1:37:08] a few
[1:37:09] songs amen maybe there'd be someone here
[1:37:12] today that says brother John God
[1:37:16] knows God knows my heart he knows the
[1:37:20] stand I'm taken
[1:37:21] today the word is had an
[1:37:25] effect I want to draw close to him and
[1:37:28] take this word just remember me in
[1:37:32] prayer if you would just raise your
[1:37:33] hands I want to pray with you God bless
[1:37:35] these hands amen God God sees your
[1:37:38] desire it's all about a
[1:37:41] relationship

[1:38:01] today thank you Jesus thank you we thank
[1:38:05] you for the price that you paid at
[1:38:07] Calvary and

[1:38:13] that needed to be done the price for
[1:38:15] Redemption was
[1:38:18] paid now Lord you've left it into our
[1:38:20] hands to to activate the power that is
[1:38:24] in that cross to become into the image
