[40:51] salvation amen God bless you you may be
[40:54] seated we want to entitle this this
[40:56] morning the dwelling of God and for a
[40:59] subject the secret
[41:03] place first thing I want to say is that
[41:07] the secret place is not a
[41:10] place it's a
[41:13] person is the person the Lord Jesus
[41:16] Christ I will say of the Lord he is my
[41:20] refuge he is my Fortress he is my God in
[41:24] him will I trust not the place but in
[41:28] him Colossians 2:10 says and we are
[41:31] complete in him which is the head of all
[41:34] principality and power he is our
[41:36] everything Philippians 4:19 but my God
[41:40] shall supply all your need according to
[41:42] his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus he
[41:44] is Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide he
[41:48] is that secret
[41:53] place you know we come to a building
[41:56] here to gather together to have church
[42:00] here and we think sometimes that that
[42:03] God has
[42:06] a a place that if we can
[42:10] just um get to that we're going to be
[42:16] safe and I want us to and it's not so
[42:19] much um in a church building it's not so
[42:23] much listening to a tape it's it's it's
[42:26] not so much getting our hands and our
[42:28] knees at at home by our
[42:31] bed I want us to think of this place as
[42:35] God but not just God but a part of
[42:40] God the secret place is not a place it's
[42:44] a
[42:45] person surely he will deliver us he will
[42:49] cover you in your he will shield you in
[42:52] him we can trust Amen brother brandom
[42:55] shared the secret place places in Christ
[42:58] he says in the spiritual food do season
[42:59] he says what a wonderful thing a type of
[43:02] the spiritual place in Christ God's
[43:06] provided place of worship he says now
[43:08] the thing I want to speak about this
[43:09] morning is that God has only one place
[43:12] that the worshipper can meet God only
[43:15] one place and Through the Ages many have
[43:17] sought for this secret place of God
[43:21] through all ages even job wanted to know
[43:23] where he lived he says if I could only
[43:25] go to the house and knock at the door
[43:28] job wanted to find God's dwelling
[43:30] because their God and his family is
[43:32] worshiped together
[43:34] amen he that dwelleth in the secret
[43:36] place of the most high the secret place
[43:38] of the most high is the very Heart Of
[43:43] God it is the very heart the very center
[43:46] of who God is so where are where are
[43:50] secrets
[43:51] kept that's right that's right secrets
[43:55] are kept in the heart
[43:58] how many times we've said this
[44:00] statement um why'd you keep that secret
[44:03] from
[44:04] me where was it kept it was kept in the
[44:07] heart the secret place of the most high
[44:09] is the very Heart Of
[44:12] God it's a precious place he that
[44:16] dwelleth in the heart of the most high
[44:19] shall abide under the Shadle or the
[44:22] defense of the
[44:24] almighty now that word dwelleth and I
[44:27] want to get into this a little bit later
[44:29] with some scriptures in the New
[44:32] Testament that word dwelleth it means to
[44:35] remain settle it means to marry it means
[44:39] to abide it means to continue too many
[44:41] people want to live their life and when
[44:43] they need help they want to go to God
[44:45] and God help me but that is not dwelling
[44:48] in the secret
[44:51] place he that dwelleth in the heart of
[44:54] the most high shall abide now that word
[44:56] abide means stay
[44:58] permanently stay
[45:03] permanently and we play a part of the
[45:05] dwelling we choose to dwell in the
[45:08] secret place we choose to dwell in the
[45:12] very desires of God's
[45:15] heart Psalm 178 says keep me as the
[45:18] apple of the eye hide me under the
[45:22] shadow of thy wings
[45:27] you're you're your eyes always stay
[45:31] there you don't take your eyes off your
[45:33] eyes are there they they're permanently
[45:36] there they're dwelling in your
[45:39] body God wants us to dwell in the in his
[45:44] heart now God's secret place isn't
[45:49] everywhere it isn't in every thought
[45:52] that we
[45:53] have we can take Corinthians 13 forces
[45:57] charity or the heart of God envieth not
[46:01] it vaunteth not itself it's not puffed
[46:03] up it does not behave itself unseemly it
[46:05] seeketh not her own it's not easily
[46:07] provoked it thinketh no
[46:10] evil so the heart of God is not in that
[46:14] amen so if we're doing that we're not
[46:16] dwelling in God
[46:20] right we're not dwelling in God's secret
[46:23] place when we're thinking ill about
[46:25] somebody or some something when we don't
[46:28] have the mind of
[46:29] Christ we're not in the secret
[46:34] place Philippians 2:3 says let nothing
[46:37] be done through Strife or vain Glory but
[46:40] in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem
[46:42] the other better than themselves look
[46:43] not every man on his own things but the
[46:46] but every man also on the things of
[46:47] others let this mind be in you which was
[46:50] also in Christ Jesus
[46:58] so God is not in every thought we
[47:02] have God does not dwell in every thought
[47:05] we have I want us to separate well God
[47:09] is always with me the Holy Ghost is
[47:11] always with me God I I'm me and God are
[47:14] one but yet our thoughts are not God's
[47:18] thoughts and we we we don't want to go
[47:20] through life and and and and and not
[47:23] care about those
[47:25] thoughts because we want to learn to
[47:28] dwell we want to learn to dwell in the
[47:30] secret place in the heart of
[47:33] God not not just visit it when we need
[47:35] it not just use it for our
[47:41] gain to love God's
[47:43] heart now God is
[47:46] everywhere he's everywhere but there is
[47:49] only a secret place for the most
[47:54] high there is nowhere that God is not
[47:56] present in knowing god is I'm a present
[48:00] which means god is everywhere at all the
[48:01] times God's divine presence fills all
[48:04] space and
[48:06] time Psalms 139:7 says whether whether
[48:10] shall I go from thy Spirit or whether
[48:12] shall I flee from thy presence Jonah
[48:16] couldn't if I Ascend up into the heaven
[48:18] Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell
[48:20] behold th are
[48:24] there God can get right down into the
[48:26] inside of our motives and our
[48:30] intents Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God
[48:32] is quick powerful and sharper than any
[48:36] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[48:38] dividing of Thunder of Soul and Spirit
[48:40] and the joints and the marrow and it is
[48:42] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[48:45] of the heart you know we need God to
[48:47] even know where we're
[48:49] at if if God does not come and show us
[48:52] what's inside of us we're
[48:54] lost we think we know so much we're that
[48:57] shows how much we don't
[48:59] know verse 13 neither is there anything
[49:03] that is that is not manifest in his
[49:05] sight but all things are naked and open
[49:08] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[49:11] to do amen obviously God is present
[49:16] everywhere nothing is hid from
[49:18] him even God's
[49:20] presence
[49:22] anoints and blesses his enemies
[49:27] his reain falls on the just and the
[49:29] unjust the good and the
[49:31] evil yet God has a dwelling
[49:35] place I want us to separate that we know
[49:40] God dwells in his word we also know that
[49:44] he has uh many mansions in his house the
[49:48] Bible tells
[49:52] us Isaiah 57:15
[49:57] we going to think about this dwelling in
[49:58] our hearts
[50:00] here for thus saith the H the high and
[50:04] lofty one one that inhabit eternity
[50:07] whose name is Holy I
[50:10] dwell in the high and holy place and
[50:15] with him also that is of a contrite and
[50:18] humble
[50:20] Spirit to revive the spirit of the
[50:22] humble and to revive the heart of the
[50:24] contrite ones so we see that that God
[50:28] has a dwelling place and it's high
[50:32] above
[50:35] everything he'll come down and he'll
[50:37] bless everybody he'll bless even his
[50:40] enemies he'll show he'll show his
[50:43] goodness to everybody because God is
[50:45] good all the
[50:47] time no one no one no matter what they
[50:51] say against God right many will come to
[50:54] to me in that day and say Lord Lord what
[50:56] about us no one there may be people
[50:59] saying
[51:00] God why weren't you as favorable to us
[51:04] to me as you were to others there'll be
[51:06] people that are actually accusing God
[51:08] just like Satan does but but God will
[51:11] just show them will revealed just how
[51:15] good he really was to them how many
[51:16] chances he really gave to everybody God
[51:19] is a good
[51:21] God but he doesn't dwell with everybody
[51:27] the secret place is with a contrite and
[51:32] a humble spirit that means somebody who
[51:35] chooses to have a spirit around their
[51:39] heart that is the spirit of Christ it
[51:44] isn't like
[51:47] well okay I live over here in Heartland
[51:51] Road and this is my dwelling over here
[51:53] but I'm going to come in I'm going to
[51:54] visit Church
[51:57] it isn't like God dwells in heaven but
[51:59] I'm going to come and I'm going to visit
[52:01] my children or my
[52:03] wife no they have the same Spirit or
[52:06] he's not going to dwell
[52:09] there the same spirit and God's spirit
[52:12] is a humble he's Meek learn of me I'm
[52:14] Meek I'm
[52:16] LLY you look at look at the
[52:21] picture so full of love and compassion
[52:27] yet such
[52:30] power could destroy everything at one
[52:34] moment could create the whole
[52:37] world but yet his
[52:41] Spirit wouldn't want to hurt
[52:44] anybody wouldn't want to do
[52:47] ill has no takes no no uh pleasure in
[52:51] the death of the wicked
[52:53] right there is a dwelling with God it's
[52:56] the very Heart Of God there's a place
[52:59] it's a secret place that he just doesn't
[53:01] unveil it to
[53:05] everybody but we know he Reveals His
[53:10] secrets to those that love
[53:13] him and that's the access into the
[53:16] secret place God dwells in the high and
[53:19] holy
[53:22] place and with a human heart that also
[53:26] is of a contrite and humble spirit it's
[53:30] not two different places it's not like
[53:33] you know some people have two homes well
[53:34] I have one home here I have one in
[53:36] Florida I dwell in both it's not like
[53:43] that we have become the The Dwelling
[53:46] Place of God the bride is the dwelling
[53:48] place of
[53:50] God Jesus said I go to prepare a place
[53:53] for you that where I am there you may be
[53:56] also but a preparation has to take place
[54:00] we have to be concerned about our
[54:01] thoughts we have to be concerned about
[54:03] what kind of spirit we display 24 hours
[54:06] a
[54:07] day we can't just be you know religious
[54:10] and claiming that we're we're we're
[54:12] God's bride because we're in the message
[54:14] and we know certain things it ain't
[54:16] about what we know it's it didn't say
[54:18] about what we know it's about what
[54:19] Spirit we
[54:23] have and and you you don't you don't
[54:25] have a and not display it we're written
[54:28] Epistles read of all
[54:31] men it takes trials to show what kind of
[54:34] spirit we are of it's really what it is
[54:36] without the trial you don't know what
[54:38] you
[54:40] are Paul said in Ephesians
[54:42] 26 that God have raised us up together
[54:45] and made us to sit in Heavenly places in
[54:49] Christ
[54:52] Jesus now God is everywhere but there is
[54:55] a secret place for the most high and it
[54:57] is the very Heart Of God I want us when
[55:00] we visualize this secret place this this
[55:03] Heart Of God I want us to visualize the
[55:05] Tabernacle in the
[55:07] wilderness the Tabernacle it had three
[55:10] parts to it right it represented the
[55:13] dwelling of God where God met with his
[55:17] people it was the outer court and it
[55:21] consisted of the Brazen labor the the
[55:23] large water basin and the sacrificial
[55:26] altar that was the outer
[55:29] Court sacrifices were made there the
[55:32] blood was sprinkled there for the
[55:37] worshipper and inside the outer Court
[55:40] was called The Holy place or the
[55:43] sanctuary that's where the showbread was
[55:46] the the golden lampstand and the altar
[55:48] of
[55:49] incense but behind that next Veil inside
[55:53] of that now beyond that was the Ho EST
[55:56] of all that's where the Ark of the
[55:59] Covenant which God contained which
[56:02] contained the sto uh Stone ta tablets
[56:05] with the Ten Commandments the golden pot
[56:08] that had mana and Aaron's bod uh Aaron's
[56:10] Rod that always mded it
[56:14] was it showed that there was life in
[56:17] there because the Mana that was inside
[56:21] the the the second dwelling or the
[56:23] sanctuary it only lasted a week
[56:27] and it had to be
[56:29] changed but the manner that was
[56:32] inside the Ark of the
[56:34] Covenant it never went
[56:37] bad it was always fresh showing that
[56:41] there was life in there and that's where
[56:43] God dwelt see that secret place is where
[56:47] he
[56:48] dwelt Hebrews 93 says after the second
[56:52] Veil The Tabernacle which is called the
[56:54] holiest of all and over it the cherabin
[56:56] of Glory shadowing the mercy seed of
[56:58] which we cannot speak particularly
[57:02] of that was the only
[57:04] place
[57:05] notice the the cherubin protected where
[57:08] God
[57:12] dwelt like you know it's protecting you
[57:15] remember when Adam and
[57:18] Eve they left the heart of God they left
[57:22] the heart of God they left the word of
[57:25] God
[57:26] and they
[57:28] fell and God said you know we got to put
[57:30] CH Cher cherubin
[57:33] Angels so they cannot come back and
[57:39] enter
[57:42] God wants all of us for
[57:47] him and our
[57:49] flesh
[57:52] um needs to die out to the word of God
[57:58] so God is everywh but there is a secret
[58:01] place of the most high and it is the
[58:03] very Heart Of God so we see God in the
[58:06] Tabernacle in the wilderness the outer
[58:09] the inner and the holiest of
[58:11] all let's take a look at the next
[58:14] Tabernacle that God met man with and
[58:17] that was in Jesus it was the outer flesh
[58:21] of Jesus and that really veiled God from
[58:25] the world
[58:27] and remember brother Ram taught us that
[58:30] the Pharisees the people that rejected
[58:33] Jesus they could not see God because of
[58:36] the veil because of the
[58:38] flesh but it was that outside flesh that
[58:42] was offered right that was offered at
[58:47] Calvary that outer Court correct it was
[58:51] a it was a flesh without
[58:53] sin now inside his flesh was veiled the
[58:58] sanctuary he spoke daily the bread of
[59:02] life to everyone he gave light to those
[59:05] that were ordained to see the word and
[59:07] he offered up prayers for the father for
[59:09] you and I
[59:11] amen and beyond that veil was the very
[59:14] heart of God the very life of
[59:17] God inside the heart of God was what the
[59:21] love of God that actually came down to
[59:23] offer that sinless body for the
[59:28] world so how many times people looked at
[59:32] Jesus and never saw the heart of
[59:35] God that's why you and I when we're
[59:37] trying to help people sometimes we we
[59:40] try to help them it's the very Heart Of
[59:41] God coming out of but they can't see it
[59:43] because they're looking at the
[59:49] veil God now dwelling in
[59:54] us the outer flesh
[59:57] which needs to be
[59:59] crucified crucified the Deeds of the
[1:00:02] Flesh and of our
[1:00:06] will in the inner Sanctuary where we
[1:00:08] feed on the word of God and we offer up
[1:00:11] prayers as incense unto the
[1:00:14] Lord and the holiest of all which is our
[1:00:17] heart it's where the Lord dwells by the
[1:00:21] presence of the Holy Spirit not on the
[1:00:25] flesh yeah he'll come and anoint
[1:00:27] everybody's flesh not just on the spirit
[1:00:31] realm not just on that inner realm where
[1:00:33] we can rejoice in the word but he comes
[1:00:36] and he dwells inside the very desire of
[1:00:40] man's
[1:00:41] heart and and man's desire and God's
[1:00:45] desire become one
[1:00:48] right a union takes
[1:00:52] place and unless that takes place
[1:00:56] we're missing the very secret place of
[1:00:58] the most
[1:01:02] high I inhabit eternity I dwell in the
[1:01:06] high and holy place and with him also
[1:01:10] that is of a contrite and humble Spirit
[1:01:13] to revive the spirit of the humble to
[1:01:16] revive the heart of the contrite ones
[1:01:19] have you ever
[1:01:20] seen have you ever been okay I'm just
[1:01:23] going to say this i' I've said it before
[1:01:25] I've had people call me and and try to
[1:01:28] you know sell me something and just tell
[1:01:30] me that you know what they have to sell
[1:01:32] me is is really it's really going to be
[1:01:34] good for me and they're talking real
[1:01:37] nice to
[1:01:38] me like they're my
[1:01:41] friend and what they have to offer is
[1:01:43] going to help my
[1:01:45] life and when I tell them I'm not
[1:01:47] interested it's amazing how quick their
[1:01:50] Spirit
[1:01:53] changes well anybody can fake it
[1:01:57] right God knows the difference between
[1:01:59] someone who's trying to be it for a
[1:02:02] moment and him that just dwells in that
[1:02:06] place tell me who's faking it there's
[1:02:08] really nothing there to
[1:02:10] revive right because they're they're not
[1:02:13] really broken
[1:02:16] enough and and and God if I can say this
[1:02:20] understand God wants us to to always
[1:02:23] dwell in a place of Brokenness
[1:02:28] I believe you can dwell there and be
[1:02:30] full of
[1:02:31] joy you can be
[1:02:39] happy I don't want to be at a place that
[1:02:42] he's not
[1:02:44] dwelling and I know that if I remain
[1:02:48] humble if I remain contrite if I'm
[1:02:52] sincere in my heart
[1:02:55] that God is going to meet
[1:03:00] Me 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:03:04] 6:14 says be not unequally yolked
[1:03:08] together with unbelievers for what
[1:03:10] Fellowship have righteousness with
[1:03:12] unrighteousness and what communion have
[1:03:14] light with darkness and what Concord
[1:03:17] have Christ with b or what part have he
[1:03:22] that believeth with someone that just
[1:03:24] doesn't believe
[1:03:26] and what agreement had the temple of God
[1:03:28] with
[1:03:29] Idols here it is for you are the Temple
[1:03:33] of the Living God and God have said I
[1:03:37] will dwell in them and walk in them and
[1:03:40] be their God and they shall be my people
[1:03:44] amen so what part do we have to play
[1:03:47] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:03:51] be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch
[1:03:54] not the unclean thing in I will receive
[1:03:58] you and I will be a father unto you and
[1:04:00] you shall be my sons and daughters saith
[1:04:02] the Lord Almighty and he that dwelleth
[1:04:05] in the secret place of the most high
[1:04:08] shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:04:11] almighty amen see there's a separation
[1:04:14] from the way that we normally think to
[1:04:17] subjecting our mind to the word of God
[1:04:21] Amen separating from things all the time
[1:04:23] we should be separating
[1:04:26] and here's the thing I'm not saying
[1:04:27] you're going back to drinking again
[1:04:29] you're going back to smoking again I'm
[1:04:30] not saying that what I'm saying is I
[1:04:32] know the devil's throwing thoughts at us
[1:04:35] all the
[1:04:36] time and we got to learn on a regular
[1:04:39] basis to separate from those
[1:04:41] thoughts keep our minds stay on
[1:04:45] him Hebrews
[1:04:47] 8:10 for this is the Covenant that I
[1:04:50] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:04:52] those days sayeth the Lord I will put my
[1:04:56] laws into their mind and I will write
[1:04:59] them in their hearts that's right and I
[1:05:03] will be to them a God and they shall be
[1:05:06] to me a people you notice the difference
[1:05:10] there God
[1:05:14] people
[1:05:16] showing
[1:05:19] headship showing his will is above ours
[1:05:26] yes we are his wife but we need to know
[1:05:29] our place in the
[1:05:33] word you know too often we just want to
[1:05:35] do our thing and say I belong to
[1:05:39] God and it it just gets us in
[1:05:43] trouble he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:05:46] place dwell in the secret place Psalms
[1:05:50] 91:4 says he shall cover thee with his
[1:05:54] feathers and under under his
[1:05:56] wings shall thou trust his truth shall
[1:06:00] be thy shield and thy buckler Thou shalt
[1:06:02] not be afraid for the terror by night
[1:06:04] nor the arrow that fth by
[1:06:08] day you ever been bothered by the
[1:06:22] devil I'm all about
[1:06:26] rebuking the
[1:06:32] devil but I'm also all four dwelling
[1:06:37] under those cherubin with the
[1:06:41] Lord and and if we we get to put our
[1:06:44] mind on the things of the Lord
[1:06:49] amen God will meet us there because he's
[1:06:53] there understand he's not bothered
[1:06:56] by the terror by day or or by night he
[1:07:00] he's not bothered by the
[1:07:03] Enemy No matter how much the Devil comes
[1:07:05] to
[1:07:07] him what do he say to what do he say in
[1:07:09] job where you been
[1:07:12] Satan they going to and fro not
[1:07:17] bothered in fact God God prepares a
[1:07:20] table for us in the presence of our
[1:07:22] enemies amen he's not afraid
[1:07:26] we need to dwell in him we would not be
[1:07:28] afraid dwell in him the the key is
[1:07:31] learning to dwell in the heart of God
[1:07:35] and the only way to enter the dwelling
[1:07:37] place of the heart of the most high is
[1:07:39] through agape love I want to kind of
[1:07:42] catch this
[1:07:44] because you know we love God because he
[1:07:47] first loved us but understand in the
[1:07:51] world in the world I had love for people
[1:07:58] and they loved me people loved
[1:08:02] me but that is not the love of God there
[1:08:07] is a distinct difference between human
[1:08:09] love and God
[1:08:11] love human love always has
[1:08:16] boundaries it starts it
[1:08:20] stops but this agape love it's eternal
[1:08:26] it's
[1:08:29] unconditional and I can love you with
[1:08:33] aape unconditional love and never be
[1:08:36] loved back by
[1:08:37] you but when you love God with
[1:08:40] unconditional love the same love that he
[1:08:42] loves you with God will open more up to
[1:08:47] you because God wants to be loved more
[1:08:50] than just with human
[1:08:52] love it's all that's ever come before
[1:08:57] but God is looking for someone that
[1:08:59] wants his
[1:09:01] heart to love him
[1:09:04] unconditionally that I'll just say it
[1:09:06] like this everyone that ever came to
[1:09:07] Christ every single person that ever
[1:09:10] came to Christ and and heard the
[1:09:13] preaching of the
[1:09:15] Gospel there was some point in that
[1:09:17] person's life that they just said I
[1:09:20] don't want to do
[1:09:21] that I'm willing to do this but I don't
[1:09:24] want to do that I don't think I should
[1:09:25] have to do that are you with me but
[1:09:28] something inside of that
[1:09:31] person was attached to something Eternal
[1:09:36] amen and said even though my flesh I
[1:09:40] don't want to do this something inside
[1:09:43] says I love you unconditionally
[1:09:47] Lord and when we begin to enter into
[1:09:49] that
[1:09:51] place that's when a real a real
[1:09:56] closeness with God starts to
[1:09:59] happen because I'm telling you there's
[1:10:01] people that can walk into a church I
[1:10:03] don't care what kind of church it is and
[1:10:05] just because everybody's you know acting
[1:10:08] this way they start acting that way or
[1:10:10] what they wear they start wearing and
[1:10:12] I'm not talking about that I'm not
[1:10:13] trying to conform our flesh into some
[1:10:15] dos and don'ts and this is how you do
[1:10:17] things I'm talking about entering into a
[1:10:19] secret place where you hear the heart of
[1:10:21] God and something inside of you says I
[1:10:23] want to be there with him
[1:10:32] but the B says we could love God every
[1:10:33] day and still miss
[1:10:36] it I don't want that kind of
[1:10:43] love I want to love
[1:10:46] him with a love that Maps me to the
[1:10:51] secret
[1:10:53] place cuz you just don't get there
[1:10:55] because you just want
[1:10:57] to right just because your kids want to
[1:11:01] drive because they want this because
[1:11:02] they want that because say can I have
[1:11:04] this can I have that you just don't yeah
[1:11:07] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:11:09] yeah
[1:11:13] no they got to prove
[1:11:15] themselves they be willing to pay the
[1:11:17] price to show that they
[1:11:21] can they can be
[1:11:23] faithful that they here that they're
[1:11:27] honest that they can handle what you're
[1:11:30] giving them because you know how many
[1:11:31] times we heard somebody got rich and the
[1:11:34] money went to their
[1:11:35] head somebody got a chance of popularity
[1:11:38] and what went to their head you
[1:11:40] understand what I'm
[1:11:43] saying so God is mapping out the weight
[1:11:46] into this secret place into the very
[1:11:48] Heart Of God but it's going to require
[1:11:50] our love for
[1:11:52] God not oh I got to go go to church got
[1:11:56] to pay my ties got to I got to I got to
[1:11:58] make sure that I'm I'm
[1:12:00] giving that is not the heart of
[1:12:04] God God loves a cheerful
[1:12:07] Giver that's the heart of God the heart
[1:12:10] of God as I shouldn't have to ask
[1:12:14] twice if you love me keep my
[1:12:19] Commandments it's not about just making
[1:12:21] it to heaven
[1:12:25] you're not going to make a Rapture
[1:12:27] without dwelling in the secret place of
[1:12:29] the most
[1:12:32] high we've got to to learn that the
[1:12:35] heart of God is where we want to be the
[1:12:37] heart of
[1:12:42] God and love Maps out the directions
[1:12:45] because he has set his love upon me
[1:12:48] because he set his love upon me I wonder
[1:12:53] where our love get set
[1:12:59] sometimes sometimes we could just trying
[1:13:02] to build such a future in this
[1:13:06] world and we can forget to set our love
[1:13:09] upon
[1:13:11] God you know we can fill our our our
[1:13:14] life with so many places we want to go
[1:13:16] so many things that we want to
[1:13:19] do so much money we want to make that we
[1:13:22] forget the heart of God
[1:13:27] I'll say it like
[1:13:29] this if what you're doing is getting you
[1:13:33] closer to God I'll say you're probably
[1:13:35] on the right
[1:13:36] track but if what you're doing is
[1:13:39] keeping you from the heart of God step
[1:13:41] back and get a better
[1:13:45] balance because I'm tell we do not have
[1:13:48] time to waste to get where we need to
[1:13:51] get to to get into a Rapture there is
[1:13:53] only just enough time
[1:13:56] I believe that with all my
[1:13:59] heart when we set our love upon the
[1:14:01] heart of God remain there dwell
[1:14:06] there that's when the blessings
[1:14:08] come he shall call upon me and I will
[1:14:11] answer him I will be with him in
[1:14:16] trouble and I will deliver him and I
[1:14:19] will honor him with long life I will
[1:14:22] satisfy him and I will show him my
[1:14:24] salvation
[1:14:26] you know most people Miss what salvation
[1:14:29] is because they think salvation is
[1:14:31] something that happens to
[1:14:33] them so that they escaped
[1:14:36] hell they missed that today is the
[1:14:38] Salvation that I need salvation from all
[1:14:41] these thoughts I I need I need to be
[1:14:45] saved on a regular
[1:14:47] basis I need his peace on a regular
[1:14:50] basis I need his his healing his his I
[1:14:53] need his Deliverance
[1:14:55] I need I need to be under the his
[1:15:00] feathers I need him every hour you know
[1:15:03] so most people they come to church not
[1:15:05] most people excuse me a lot of people
[1:15:07] they'll come to church because it's time
[1:15:09] to go to church and they feel that you
[1:15:11] know they can get attitudes that they
[1:15:12] don't even really need to
[1:15:14] go but yet they hang on to this you know
[1:15:18] I got this
[1:15:22] salvation missing what salvation really
[1:15:27] is salvation is to save us from
[1:15:33] ourself because he has he has made the
[1:15:37] Lord because thou has made the Lord
[1:15:40] which is my refuge even the most
[1:15:45] high thy
[1:15:47] habitation thy
[1:15:49] dwelling we have to make a choice Saints
[1:15:53] I am going to dwell in Christ I'm going
[1:15:56] to dwell in his word I'm going to dwell
[1:15:59] there I'm going to remain there I'm
[1:16:02] going to remain in the heart of God
[1:16:04] that's just the
[1:16:06] outskirts not just I'll tell you if the
[1:16:10] righteous scarcely make
[1:16:15] it to me would you want to marry
[1:16:18] somebody whose attitude was I'll just do
[1:16:21] barely what I need to do to get by
[1:16:25] I'll tell I want to marry somebody
[1:16:26] that's in love with
[1:16:30] me I don't want to marry somebody that
[1:16:39] just I don't know all the reasons people
[1:16:41] get married I don't
[1:16:43] know but I'll just say it like this with
[1:16:46] God God is interested in our heart and
[1:16:50] he wants to marry somebody he wants a
[1:16:52] bride whose heart is after
[1:16:56] him after
[1:16:58] him I want us to remember that's the
[1:17:00] only way into God's secret place which
[1:17:04] is the heart of God is through
[1:17:06] love through love so when you're wanting
[1:17:09] to get in that that secret place I want
[1:17:12] you to think about loving him I believer
[1:17:15] will never be able to find the secret
[1:17:17] place outside of the love of God love
[1:17:19] Maps out the
[1:17:22] directions Jesus said here in John 14
[1:17:25] 21 he that have my Commandments he that
[1:17:29] has my word he that that hears the word
[1:17:32] preached and and keeps
[1:17:35] them he it is that loveth me so he's
[1:17:38] identifying the true person that loves
[1:17:40] him and he that loveth me is going to be
[1:17:43] loved by my father I thought God loves
[1:17:45] everybody that there's a special love
[1:17:48] when you love God back with his word
[1:17:50] there is there's a reciprocation that
[1:17:52] comes back more I know he loves
[1:17:54] everybody but I'm telling you when you
[1:17:56] love him a reciprocation comes back and
[1:17:59] that love
[1:18:02] grows and I will love him and I will
[1:18:06] manifest myself to
[1:18:09] him there's something that happens when
[1:18:12] you take the word of God
[1:18:15] seriously that God will just take as it
[1:18:18] were his shirt open it up and manifest
[1:18:22] himself to us
[1:18:26] that's the kind of love that I want to
[1:18:29] be around
[1:18:31] am I want God to manifest himself to
[1:18:36] me now Judas we could say he's in church
[1:18:40] this morning Judas saith unto him not a
[1:18:43] scariot though a different Judas he said
[1:18:46] Lord how is it that thou are going to
[1:18:47] manifest thyself unto all of
[1:18:50] us but not unto the
[1:18:53] world here was the
[1:18:55] answer Jesus said if a man love me he
[1:18:59] will keep my
[1:19:01] words and my father will love
[1:19:04] him and we will come unto him and make
[1:19:07] our Abode with
[1:19:13] him no more just the spirit jumping on
[1:19:16] us
[1:19:18] prophesying speaking in tugs dancing in
[1:19:21] the spirit doing many wonderful
[1:19:23] works not just a blessing on the
[1:19:28] outside because all that can happen
[1:19:30] without keeping God's
[1:19:32] word all of
[1:19:36] it but to be
[1:19:38] serious about God's
[1:19:43] word that's what opens the heart of God
[1:19:45] that says I will come and make my abold
[1:19:49] with him I tell you when you've been in
[1:19:52] the presence of the Lord you do not want
[1:19:54] to get
[1:19:57] out when you're there you say God don't
[1:20:01] ever let me leave this
[1:20:05] place we know that David was a man after
[1:20:08] God's Own
[1:20:10] Heart he sought the secret place of the
[1:20:13] most
[1:20:14] high God is as God is is seeking those
[1:20:19] that will worship Him in spirit truth
[1:20:20] God is also seeking those who is looking
[1:20:23] to dwell in his
[1:20:26] heart because not everybody wants
[1:20:29] to people don't mind doing their due
[1:20:31] Justice and go to church and listen to a
[1:20:34] tape and do some prayers but after
[1:20:36] they're done their their mind and their
[1:20:38] heart is in different
[1:20:43] areas and I'm not saying God is not
[1:20:45] thankful when we don't come to when we
[1:20:47] come to church or or when we read and
[1:20:49] when we pray I'm sure that God is but
[1:20:51] God is looking for a special
[1:20:53] relationship with his
[1:20:56] wife someone who says I am putting
[1:20:59] things aside to to reciprocate this
[1:21:03] unconditional love back to my heavenly
[1:21:05] father to my
[1:21:08] husband he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:21:12] place of the most high Colossians 3:2
[1:21:16] says set your affections on things above
[1:21:19] not on the things of the Earth for you
[1:21:22] are dead and your life is hid with
[1:21:25] Christ in God hid in Christ with God I
[1:21:29] many times we are brother Brandon me
[1:21:31] even Jesus he' say this he said the
[1:21:33] world don't know you because it didn't
[1:21:34] know
[1:21:37] me Christ was hid from the world he
[1:21:40] hides himself from the wise and
[1:21:44] prudent you know some people I I'll tell
[1:21:47] you you know the Bible says the rich
[1:21:49] have many
[1:21:52] friends if somebody can use
[1:21:55] you they probably
[1:22:00] will
[1:22:02] true but if there's something in them
[1:22:05] that can't use
[1:22:08] you they
[1:22:15] won't people want God for many
[1:22:21] reasons and not that there's anything in
[1:22:23] God that he doesn't want want to help
[1:22:25] everybody for all the
[1:22:27] reasons but
[1:22:29] imagine God looking down all that ever
[1:22:32] came before me are thiefs and
[1:22:34] robbers he's
[1:22:36] looking who loves
[1:22:38] me who loves me with this unconditional
[1:22:41] love who's willing to give up more of
[1:22:44] their heart from me from my
[1:22:48] heart I believe God is calling the bride
[1:22:51] to a place that no other church member
[1:22:53] can go
[1:22:56] that's why this this this this kind of
[1:22:58] ministry can can maybe seem like a a
[1:23:02] little hard or a little a little too
[1:23:04] much but it's really to the
[1:23:11] bride he's calling a bride out of a
[1:23:14] church he will have a Rapture I believe
[1:23:17] with all my heart there will be people
[1:23:19] from this church that make a Rapture I
[1:23:21] believe that with all my heart there is
[1:23:23] no doubt about it
[1:23:27] love is the key into the secret place
[1:23:30] with God Psalms 18 vers1 says I will
[1:23:34] love thee oh Lord my strength I will
[1:23:37] love
[1:23:38] thee the Lord is my rock my Fortress my
[1:23:42] deliverer my God my strength in whom I
[1:23:46] will trust my buckler my horn of my
[1:23:48] salvation my high
[1:23:51] toow David said I will love
[1:23:57] thee oh Lord my
[1:24:01] strength too many people want God to be
[1:24:05] their Fortress their deliverer their
[1:24:08] strength their buckler their
[1:24:12] salvation they refuse to love
[1:24:16] them refuse to love them back enough
[1:24:21] enough to keep the word that God's been
[1:24:23] trying to tell them to do you know many
[1:24:25] you know many people come to
[1:24:29] church they have this attitude I love
[1:24:32] God I serve God my way
[1:24:35] refuse to line up with part of the word
[1:24:38] and say they love
[1:24:43] God you know the thing is there's many
[1:24:46] things that God wants to tell us right
[1:24:49] many things he wants us to do but if we
[1:24:52] don't come to church with that desire
[1:24:55] God help me to do the things that I'm
[1:24:57] not
[1:24:58] doing instead of I'm glad I'm here doing
[1:25:03] this and I feel this is good enough God
[1:25:05] is looking for such a
[1:25:07] closeness we don't want to miss
[1:25:10] it
[1:25:12] amen the dwelling place is the love of
[1:25:15] God to love the Lord thy God with all
[1:25:17] thy heart with all thy soul with all thy
[1:25:19] might this is the heart of God
[1:25:22] Amen John 15 verse one time is slipping
[1:25:26] by and I want to try to get into this we
[1:25:29] know that was the Commandment that God
[1:25:30] wanted us to keep to love the Lord with
[1:25:34] all of our our
[1:25:37] heart now if I don't know my heart I
[1:25:40] need to ask God I need to be sincere and
[1:25:42] ask God God how much of my heart am I
[1:25:45] loving you
[1:25:47] with instead of just assuming I love God
[1:25:50] with all my
[1:25:52] heart because if I'm a human being I I
[1:25:55] probably needing to give up some more
[1:25:58] amen amen that's that's why that humble
[1:26:00] and contrite spirit is always needed
[1:26:03] right John 151 I am the True
[1:26:06] Vine my father's the husbandman every
[1:26:09] branch in me that beareth not fruit is
[1:26:11] he taketh away and every branch that
[1:26:14] does bear fruit he purchase it that he
[1:26:16] may bring forth more fruit see we see
[1:26:19] the very Heart Of God that he just wants
[1:26:21] more and more and more and more I'm okay
[1:26:23] with that
[1:26:25] I'm okay with that I need that my flesh
[1:26:27] May don't want that but I know that I
[1:26:31] need that now you are clean through the
[1:26:33] word which I spoken unto you why does
[1:26:36] the word clean you because when you say
[1:26:38] Amen you say so be it in my life clean
[1:26:42] me up Lord I accept the word I accept
[1:26:46] this it's not about the word clobbering
[1:26:49] you over the head it's about the word
[1:26:52] cleaning you right but here's the
[1:26:55] difference if you feel clobbered your
[1:26:57] heart's not in
[1:27:01] it because if you love the word you're
[1:27:05] you're not going to get offended right
[1:27:06] oh great peace have they that love my
[1:27:08] word nothing shall offend them so the
[1:27:11] word comes in and it it it cleans us a
[1:27:15] little bit more I tell you when you
[1:27:16] receive the word you know what you're
[1:27:18] doing you're loving God back with
[1:27:20] unconditional love
[1:27:26] that opens the door for him to manifest
[1:27:28] himself more to
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:32] us verse four abide in me abide I'll say
[1:27:37] he says this like oh one two three four
[1:27:40] five six seven times in the next three
[1:27:42] verses seven times he uses this word
[1:27:46] abide abide in me and I in you as the
[1:27:49] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:27:51] except it abide in the Vine no more can
[1:27:55] you except you abide in
[1:27:57] me now I'm the vine you're the branches
[1:28:00] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[1:28:02] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:28:04] without me you can do nothing if a man
[1:28:06] abide not in me in other words he just
[1:28:10] comes and goes just comes and goes to
[1:28:13] church just comes and goes to Christ
[1:28:17] just comes and goals with with the grips
[1:28:19] of I'm going to obey the Bible and I'm
[1:28:21] going to get in the message just comes
[1:28:24] and
[1:28:25] goes it's not
[1:28:27] abiding if a man abide not in me he is
[1:28:30] cast forth as a branch and is withered
[1:28:35] and Men gather them and cast them into
[1:28:37] the fire and they are burned but if you
[1:28:40] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:28:42] then you shall ask what you will and it
[1:28:45] shall be done unto you look at the
[1:28:49] blessing that come from abiding you know
[1:28:53] too many people want to reject that and
[1:28:54] just say you know whatever you say in
[1:28:56] the name of the Lord you'll have
[1:28:59] it you got to take the whole
[1:29:03] word and God is really I'm not saying
[1:29:06] that
[1:29:07] God in my name they shall cast out
[1:29:09] Devils abiding or
[1:29:12] not yeah
[1:29:14] exactly but we're we're not talking
[1:29:16] about hey let's just get power over
[1:29:18] sharpens and you know uh Judas had all
[1:29:21] that
[1:29:24] but there there there there wasn't a a
[1:29:25] desire in his heart to
[1:29:28] abide and and this calling that God is
[1:29:30] calling the bride to is to
[1:29:33] abide now that word abide it has the
[1:29:37] same meaning as he that dwelleth in the
[1:29:40] secret
[1:29:41] place it means to stay in
[1:29:44] relation it means to continue to dwell
[1:29:48] to endure to be present to remain to
[1:29:51] stand to Tar
[1:29:59] same we got to stay there amen it's the
[1:30:02] hardest thing to do the easiest thing to
[1:30:05] do is repent get baptized I'm starting
[1:30:09] for you
[1:30:10] Lord and how Satan comes with his
[1:30:13] swiftness oh I'm there I'm I did it it's
[1:30:17] over I'm
[1:30:19] saved but if you really don't truly get
[1:30:23] saved you'll simply go back and your
[1:30:26] life will not be in
[1:30:28] Christ and how many people have done
[1:30:31] that more than ever did stay more than
[1:30:35] ever did
[1:30:38] stay now we need to dwell there because
[1:30:42] we need the presence of God it's our
[1:30:45] safety and we when we dwell or abide in
[1:30:49] the heart of of God the love of God the
[1:30:51] presence of God we have safety
[1:30:55] and also it's only in that place that
[1:30:57] true things can
[1:31:00] happen I mean God can deliver us God can
[1:31:04] Deliver Us from things we're not
[1:31:05] dwelling
[1:31:08] there God can God can Deliver Us from
[1:31:12] spirits but we do
[1:31:14] realize that seven worse Spirits demons
[1:31:16] can come back upon
[1:31:19] us because of not entering into that
[1:31:23] Dwelling Place that secret place to
[1:31:25] where you're dwelling with God now there
[1:31:29] is where life
[1:31:31] changes nature
[1:31:33] changes not only old things are passed
[1:31:36] away but behold All Things become new
[1:31:38] see there's a difference that takes
[1:31:40] place and we need to get in the presence
[1:31:42] of God more and more and learn how to
[1:31:45] dwell there how to how to remain there
[1:31:47] because Satan's flying with all these
[1:31:49] thoughts and trying to get us distracted
[1:31:51] and off
[1:31:52] track so we got to learn to dwell there
[1:31:56] you ever been driving down the road and
[1:31:59] listening to music talking to somebody
[1:32:01] maybe on your phone excuse me and um you
[1:32:04] get
[1:32:05] distracted the tires go off the road and
[1:32:07] all a sudden you hear
[1:32:12] the happens a couple
[1:32:14] times and then you
[1:32:16] realize I need to dwell right here in
[1:32:20] the
[1:32:22] middle it's just natural
[1:32:24] amen things happen it's it's not that
[1:32:26] we're
[1:32:28] bad it it just we we'll understand if
[1:32:30] we're going to get to the place we need
[1:32:31] to get to we need to be the ones putting
[1:32:34] forth the
[1:32:35] effort because God wants to help us with
[1:32:37] all that we need have need of but we got
[1:32:39] to we got to cry out to them right in
[1:32:42] the message invisible
[1:32:44] Union of the bride of Christ brother
[1:32:46] says we're at the end time so what does
[1:32:49] it have to do
[1:32:52] now he said let lay in the presence of
[1:32:56] the s o n to be Ren ripened that's exact
[1:33:01] the word to be ripened into your heart
[1:33:06] to bring forth and live what we're
[1:33:11] talking about
[1:33:15] amen it's one thing to agree with the
[1:33:19] word it's another thing to let that word
[1:33:22] sit there and just lay in the presence
[1:33:24] of the Holy Spirit and let it begin to
[1:33:28] ripen shape our heart change our
[1:33:32] thinking get us to a place where we
[1:33:35] begin to manifest the very thing we're
[1:33:39] saying Amen to are you with me he says
[1:33:43] but oh how the church needs to lay in
[1:33:46] the
[1:33:47] presence till it tenders up you know and
[1:33:51] gets sweet in the spirit so that it can
[1:33:54] just bathe
[1:33:56] down what a what a precious quote there
[1:34:00] are certain things that only happen in
[1:34:02] the presence of God Amen brother
[1:34:04] brandham said in the message Abraham he
[1:34:07] says here was Moses in the presence of
[1:34:09] the burning bush his was better equipped
[1:34:12] in five minutes in the presence of God
[1:34:15] than 80 years of schooling had given him
[1:34:19] and I hope that don't hurt but I hope it
[1:34:22] sinks in real deep
[1:34:25] he in Divine love he says one day God
[1:34:28] come down in a little Burning Bush Moses
[1:34:31] known more about what he had to do what
[1:34:35] his future was and what he had to do in
[1:34:37] five minutes in the presence of God than
[1:34:40] all his Egyptian strategy that had
[1:34:42] taught him in 40
[1:34:44] years manifesting his gifts brother
[1:34:47] Braham says now his mother had taught
[1:34:50] him that he was to be the emancipator of
[1:34:54] amen all these things had been taught by
[1:34:57] his mother by teachers by the
[1:34:59] schools and yet he knew no more about
[1:35:03] God yet he knew more about God in just
[1:35:05] five minutes in the presence of that
[1:35:09] light yes so I'm going to say I want to
[1:35:13] say this to
[1:35:14] everybody it's wonderful that we listen
[1:35:18] to the tapes it's wonderful that we read
[1:35:20] our Bible it's wonderful that we come to
[1:35:22] church and we should but the thing that
[1:35:24] we should be seeking is the presence of
[1:35:27] God when that's
[1:35:29] happening because we could spend hours
[1:35:33] in church just like in
[1:35:36] schooling but just five minutes in his
[1:35:39] presence things open
[1:35:41] up Jehovah Gyra five minutes in the
[1:35:44] presence of Christ he took off his shoes
[1:35:47] and he respected
[1:35:50] it I don't understand you get people
[1:35:52] sometimes they come to church they don't
[1:35:54] have respect for God's house they don't
[1:35:57] come in they don't care what attitude
[1:35:59] they have they don't care what's hanging
[1:36:01] on them they don't care what spiritual
[1:36:03] clothes are on
[1:36:05] them because they're not walking they
[1:36:09] haven't come from God's
[1:36:11] presence they don't live in God's
[1:36:13] presence God's presence isn't in their
[1:36:20] home how we need the realness of God
[1:36:25] can you bear with me just a little bit
[1:36:28] Psalms 84:10 for a day in thy courts is
[1:36:31] better than a
[1:36:33] thousand I'd rather be a doorkeeper in
[1:36:36] the house of my God than to dwell in the
[1:36:38] tents of the
[1:36:39] wicked a
[1:36:43] doorkeeper you hardly can't get anybody
[1:36:45] to do anything for for the church
[1:36:48] anymore just too busy
[1:36:53] for the Lord God is the son and his
[1:36:55] shield the Lord will give Grace and
[1:36:57] Glory no good thing will he withhold
[1:37:00] from them that walk uprightly amen that
[1:37:04] doesn't mean do something uprightly once
[1:37:07] in a
[1:37:08] while it's a dwelling oh lord of hosts
[1:37:12] blessed is the man that trusteth thee
[1:37:14] Psalms
[1:37:15] 27:1 the Lord is my light and my
[1:37:17] salvation Whom Shall I
[1:37:19] Fear the Lord is my strength the
[1:37:22] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:37:25] afraid when the wicked even my enemies
[1:37:27] and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my
[1:37:29] flesh they stumbled and they
[1:37:33] fell though a host should encamp against
[1:37:35] me my heart shall not
[1:37:39] fear the heart shall not fear because
[1:37:43] that heart is dwelling with God
[1:37:46] Amen though War should rise up against
[1:37:49] me and this so I be confident one thing
[1:37:50] have I desired of the Lord and that why
[1:37:54] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:37:56] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:38:00] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:38:02] inquire in his Temple I don't know what
[1:38:04] people do with that with they they dread
[1:38:06] going to church once a week you know I
[1:38:08] don't know what they do with
[1:38:11] that you know they go it's probably the
[1:38:14] most miserable place to to be for a
[1:38:18] Believer when they have to go to church
[1:38:21] when they feel they have to go to church
[1:38:23] but they're desire just isn't
[1:38:25] there a a a not a very very fun place to
[1:38:31] be but to have a heart to always want to
[1:38:33] dwell in the presence of God no matter
[1:38:36] where you're at no matter the store or
[1:38:38] the car wherever you're at you can dwell
[1:38:41] in his Tabernacle amen
[1:38:46] amen or in the time of trouble he shall
[1:38:50] hide thee in his Pavilion you know too
[1:38:53] too many people wait till they get in
[1:38:56] trouble and then here's another thing I
[1:38:59] don't want to keep preaching because my
[1:39:00] time is up but here's the the a
[1:39:05] thing when people begin to call on the
[1:39:07] Lord and he doesn't answer he doesn't
[1:39:10] help them in the time of trouble you
[1:39:12] know what some of those people do they
[1:39:18] quit they say see it doesn't matter in
[1:39:21] other words church or God just becomes
[1:39:23] of
[1:39:25] formality they never had that personal
[1:39:29] relationship with them that keeps them
[1:39:31] with our relationship with God you know
[1:39:34] why why do we expect God to just I mean
[1:39:37] God is merciful but we got to truly
[1:39:39] truly turn around truly repent truly
[1:39:41] make a decision I'm going to serve you
[1:39:43] and I'm going to dwell in your previl
[1:39:45] I'm going to dwell in your secret place
[1:39:47] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:39:49] me in his Pavilion in the secret in the
[1:39:52] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:39:56] me he shall set me upon a revelation and
[1:39:59] now shall my head be lifted up above my
[1:40:02] enemies round about me therefore I offer
[1:40:05] in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy will
[1:40:08] sing yay will sing praises unto the Lord
[1:40:11] let's Stand Together
[1:40:14] Saints in the message DED dedication of
[1:40:17] the building to the Lord Brother BR says
[1:40:19] all that perfect rest that come from the
[1:40:22] congre ation to the altar from the altar
[1:40:25] to the bosom of Christ in the bed at
[1:40:28] night the secret place that resting
[1:40:31] place with Christ and in the hidden life
[1:40:35] just one quick word he says and every
[1:40:38] man or boy or woman or girl that is ever
[1:40:42] anointed of God and Walks Behind the
[1:40:45] temple the veil of God the Holy Ghost
[1:40:47] and puts him in a secret place the veil
[1:40:51] drops behind him and the world and all
[1:40:55] the things are cut off behind
[1:40:58] him there's a difference between
[1:41:02] dwelling and just checking it
[1:41:05] out and I believe that God is calling
[1:41:08] the
[1:41:09] bride to
[1:41:11] dwell and those of us that are dwelling
[1:41:14] to dwell more Amen to dwell
[1:41:17] more
[1:41:20] this I believe God just saying love me a
[1:41:24] little bit more he's just wanting to be
[1:41:25] loved A little bit
[1:41:30] more is there anybody here anybody here
[1:41:34] that doesn't want to hear the words I
[1:41:37] love
[1:41:39] you no we all want to hear the words I
[1:41:42] love
[1:41:45] you that's right so does
[1:41:50] God and you know what it's like for
[1:41:52] somebody to say I love you you but you
[1:41:54] don't feel
[1:41:55] it you can't get warned by a painted
[1:41:58] fire it needs to be
[1:42:01] real and and Jesus said why why you call
[1:42:04] me Lord Lord do not the things I
[1:42:06] say the love he wanting to feel from us
[1:42:09] is giving up our will to do his
[1:42:12] will that means we've got to find out
[1:42:14] what is it that he wants us to do that
[1:42:16] we're we're not quite doing the way he
[1:42:17] wants us to do and walk in that and that
[1:42:20] really shows him that's like saying I
[1:42:22] love you I love you let's just sing that
[1:42:25] little chorus I I I love him I love
