that great day when everyone will have to bow their knee and the privilege that we have today to do it willingly amen that i believe just blesses god and i'm grateful that he has revealed himself to us amen that he is the almighty the king of kings and the lord of lords and that we can serve him as he is amen amen it's a privilege and an honor amen let's just look to the lord in in prayer before we open the scriptures dear heavenly father we want to thank you that you have remained the same in throughout history throughout time as your word declares you are the same yesterday today and forever and we've gone through a lot of up and downs lord we've we've had a lot of slips and a lot of falls and a lot of tests and a lot of trials and we thought a lot of thoughts but lord you've always brought us back to your word and showed us that you're you remain the same your love has remained the same you have never stopped loving us you've never given up on us we are indebted to you lord today we pray that you would come as only you can reveal yourself to us lord we pray that you would reveal your great love to us lord may we long for your love long to manifest your love not just feel it and be blessed by it but lord to bless others with that same love fill us lord with your love we pray as we approach your word tonight lord that you would give us revelation of thy precious word we give you the glory now in advance for these things for we humbly pray in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to saint john chapter 15 or want to do a part three and remaining in god's love with the message tonight or the subject tonight of security remaining in his love brings a security to us and that's uh it's a great benefit uh for remaining in god's love now we know god's love towards us has remained the same the variable is always us and and jesus is encouraging us here in john 15 9 and 10 the bible says jesus said here as the father have loved me so i have loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i kept my father's commandments and abide in his love amen god bless you may be seated so it's easier said than done to remain in god's love because the requirement that jesus gave is we have to keep the word and the more we read the word the more we find out we got to keep so it's like a continual process of abiding in his love what the holy spirit is really doing he's leading us to a perfect love relationship with god amen and without it we can't really enter in so to get to that place of perfect love we have to abide in the leading of the spirit or abide in his love when we first came to the lord we only knew a very little bit about god we were really focused on how much he forgave us and washed all of our sins away and we were the happiest person on the planet and then we began to find out certain things that we needed to do one of the first things i learned about was that i had to cut my hair because it was one of his many commandments and and i i had to stop listening to worldly music and uh these um things if i did them now um if i didn't do them it didn't mean god loved me any less but i was i would stop my love relationship with him so all along god is developing a love relationship with us it's really based on love it's based on his word love for his word might be a proper way of saying it and at any time i decide that i don't want uh to do what he's asked me to do then i am putting a a wedge between me and god and we think it's not a big deal because we we still appreciate the salvation we still appreciate that he's met our needs we we still claim that um you know if we we pay our tithes and our barns overflow and so on so forth but the thing is god is more interested in the relationship and that's what this i believe this whole series has been about god's wanting us to remain in love it's easy to fall out of love still go through the motions kind of forget certain feelings we started off this series with remaining faithful and i think this is a important part um to to remaining in love is you got to remain faithful to the things that god said so one way is keep my commandments is be faithful to keep the commandments i'll say to any young christian it's impossible to grow if you do not remain faithful you just can't pick and choose when you're going to come to church pick and choose what what part of the word is favorable in your sight and and kind of let things go we must remain faithful to read our bible and to pray brother branham says if you want to be more spiritual that means grow then read your bible and pray every day he said in the message communion in 62 he says you see each day we've got to commune with christ we've got to talk to him each day we've got to settle with him each day what are we supposed to settle paul said i die each day that is what has to be settled each day i have to die yet i live not me but christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive and spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the lord each day to survive yes jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god so each day we've got to study the bible some people doesn't study it at all some picks it up every two or three times a year but a real real believer that's really spiritual built up he reads his bible every day and he talks to the lord that's right he has to because man shall not live by by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god that's remaining faithful another thing that we need to remain faithful is uh coming to church hebrews chapter 10 verse 25 says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the matter some is some some say it's okay some just you know they want to come when they want to come but exhort one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching so now it's put on us the responsibility of telling others you've got to be in church not hey i would consider you know you know you should maybe think about it no exhort them it's a responsibility if it's to me you're cutting off your lifeline we come here to feed and to find out where we're at with god and we can't take it as just one extra curriculum type of thing he says let's consider wanting to provoke unto love and to good work so i would say to somebody if the only reason you're telling them to get in the church is because you're being judgment or critical don't tell them but if it's the love of god in your heart you need to tell them faithfulness is so important we said that god is not obligated but the brandon said god is not obligated to show us anything more until we walk in the light that he's already given us this is so important because we kind of let certain things come and go and we something bothers us we just kind of like let it go and focus on something that's easier to do but this is really important to god it's his commandment and we all want to come to church and be blessed in his presence and to have a certain victory certain joys and and certain things in our life but we fail to follow through with the things that god has asked us to do so we need to look at this quote this statement that the prophet made to us in this last generation as really important to god when we remain faithfully connected to the vine then we can bear the fruit because jesus said unless you stay connected you can't bear fruit not not the fruit of god anyways he said in john 15 16 you have not chosen me but i chose you god started the relationship and he ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that you have no breaks you have no breaks amen you got to keep bearing the fruit so god has not chose us to be some plaque on the wall or some trophy or some dried-up church-goer right he's called us to be lively stones to bring forth fruit i believe the fruit comes forth from an intimate love relationship he gives the holy ghost to them that obey him and it's not easy to obey the lord i remember when i first came to to to christ and how precious it was being in brother johnson's church i'll tell you my main motive was i didn't want to go to hell and i'm just being honest that was my motive i wasn't looking for god he came looking for me and i knew i was going straight to hell if i didn't yield and i'm so grateful that there was something inside that believed the book of revelations when i read it even though i didn't understand it i believed it amen but our motives cannot remain that way it cannot remain i i'm doing this because i'm scared if it does listen to this we'll stop putting forth the effort to please him so i'm just go you know what i don't know what i don't it's we're we're we're three degrees under what it says but it must be real hot outside is that and it's having a hard time keeping up never had that happen before it's the first time it's a hot day today but i saw you i saw you and i just didn't want you to suffer so our motive needs to become pure if it's mixed god sees it he knows it but it needs to become pure that we just unconditionally were devoted to want to please him he said if you love me then keep the things that have spoken to you it doesn't happen automatically we don't come to church hear the word we automatically do it right no we've got to lay like like like paul said we got to die daily and and get the flesh uh crucified so that that seed of life can just come forth in it now it is the only way that we can remain in love with god because jesus said that you've got to keep the commandments to abide in my love so when you think about the commandments god has been speaking to you i don't know what they are they've been different for all of us but we've got to about identify them and make sure that we're keeping them because that's part of really feeling not just feeling but you know when his love is around you you're you you just know it you don't have to go searching for it it's there because you've been obedient to what he's told you to do so this is a real important now songs and music can move us to tears but the only way to remain in love with jesus is to follow through with what he said how many times we've listened to songs and just you know we've been all teary-eyed and and just crying out to god and then you know two hours later kind of forget all about god so yeah songs and music can move us but what we need to be focusing on is keeping the commandments remaining in god's love it's hard to do in the age that we're living we've got so many distractions there's you talk to people they just seem to be worse worse just cold they they don't want to give you anything more than just a what do you want and then kind of get out but if we're faithful to just crucify our flesh then i believe the love of god can can flow through us we can we can keep living for others because that's what the greatest thing i believe about the love of god is it has no problem laying down its life for another person none it is so powerful greater love has no man this any than a man lay down his life for his friends and if god's love is inside of us it will produce the same thing now you won't go to calvary but you will crucify yourself that christ can help that person through you that's what we're all called for if we miss that we've missed our calling romans 12 verse 1 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable it's a reasonable thing that you could do for god and be not conformed to this world and it's always trying to conform us right every day we go to work but be ye transformed by how you think by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god now i believe the perfect will of god is to lay down our life for one another i believe as the prophet said that whatever we do we should go get perfect love now i believe that that's what we should be proving that's what we should be focused it's the most important things every day we go to work and i've taught i've taught a number at work that when you've got uh a list of 20 things to do you can't get them done in one day so you have to make a priority of what's important the most important thing and the mo when brother branham got back from being on another side he said the most important thing is get perfect love now we agree with it we say amen but are we going after it or are we assuming it's just going to come to the turn of the page the calendar the next year it don't happen like that if it did he would have never said whatever you do get to the place he said he would have said don't worry it's coming no matter what it's not coming no matter what because it has to do with love it has to do with keeping the commandments it has to do with you giving up your will for god's will you have got to accept the same love in your heart that the father had to jesus and that jesus had to us are you with me all right john said the same thing in first john 3 16 he said hereby perceive we the love of god perceive we the love of god because he lay down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren so we're talking about perceiving to understand by this shall all men know you're my disciples when you have that love one for another can i can we just skip and and not skip but i want to inject this in ephesians chapter 3 if i could ephesians chapter 3 verse number i just want to start with verse number 14. for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth his name that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by the spirit of the inner man now who is that that's the holy ghost inside of you that's where we get our strength from when the world wears you out your strength comes from god that christ may dwell in your heart by revelation you've got to believe it if you don't believe it then christ can't come in that ye being rooted and grounded in love it's got to be the foundation it can't be because i'm scared to go to hell and it can't be because i i i want to uh be rich or i want to be delivered right i mean all those things are wonderful but your motive has to be love it's got to get there it's okay that that god gets our attention brother branham said that healing that was the bait right that was just god shows the bait he doesn't show the hook but he wants to hook us he wants a relationship with us something that would well that he it's a keeper right the worm can come off the hook but if that hook gets you amen he's going to reel us in all right that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints everybody all to know comprehend with all saints what is the breath the length the depth the height and to know the love of christ it passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god why does it take the love of god to be filled with the fullness of god why can't i just go to a college or you know learn all the bible and and just read it and and quote the scriptures quote the message it's not knowledge of god that gets us to god i'm talking about intellectual knowledge of god does not get us to know god it's when the love of god comes in your heart shut abroad by the holy ghost you know you know the fullness of god when you have the fullness of his love inside of you amen because god is love we've got to to remain in that love jesus said the same thing in john 15 verse 12 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you so often when we think about god's love we do not think about loving others i'm telling you the majority time that we think about the love of god is what god has done for us and somewhere down the line we've got to start thinking about others it's got to translate into god using your body to love somebody amen greater love have no man than this than a man laid down in his life for his friends i want you to think about this jesus was not bragging about himself when he's when he spoke this he it wasn't just all about him but he was teaching us that this is his commandment this is how you love this is what we need to do and then he ended year my friends if you do whatsoever command you amen it almost sounds like god's being respected persons here but he's not he's he's really showing us that there is a special relationship if you do what i ask you to do there's a special love relationship there when you re-reciprocate the same love back to god that he has reciprocated to us that he has initiated with us and i'm telling you and when you reciprocate it back this is where security begins unfortunately there's too many people that feel security starts with just jesus loving them and it don't matter what they do they're still secure in other words they leave out the part of keeping his commandments they leave out the part that that god is looking for we must press into god's love must abide in it remain in it keep ourselves in the love of god it's a choice that we make last sunday we dove into remaining in god's love through humility i think some of these things that we're saying they do bear repeating i i could i could i could use more humility amen we can be doing many things for the lord but if we don't remain in humility we'll never remain in his love it you must be humble if you're going to remain in the love of god you just you just cannot remain in god's love and be proud to me humility true humility that is is a sign that god is first in your life and no matter how religious we may feel pride is a sure sign that god is against you god is against you if pride is there to say even in the in the bible that god that god wanted us to know that a proud look god even hates a proud look didn't do nothing wrong just a look but yet the expression that god is so much against pride because really that's where it all started was with lucifer he was perfect when he was created but he got to a place of pride amen we don't want that we want to be able to get underneath every single person that we meet get underneath them and love them more than you think they deserve keep yourselves humble and it will help keep you in love with god keep looking for forgiveness it opens the door to the love of god just being more grateful repentance should never be something that we just end at the end of the day don't just start it and end it but through the course of the day be conscious of your thoughts what's pleasing to the lord maybe little little gestures and little things or you know even could be just wasting your time remember the woman that was so grateful brother braham says that her sins were forgiven until she spent all she had on jesus and what was so beautiful about this quote is that when we are so grateful we don't mind spending all we have time money i'm not pulling for money i'm not but i'll tell you you you don't have to go buy some alabaster oil but you should you should be sacrificing something for the cause of christ if you're not if you're sacrificing little you're going to receive little and i'll say it like this you love us little and i'm just i'm just using scriptures now we went through that we don't have time to go through it again but another practical thing that we can do is we need to learn to exercise thankfulness it will help us to remain in love in god's love if murmuring complaining grieves the holy spirit away then i believe just being grateful and thankful for what he's given us we we try to exercise that every day i believe that will help us to remain in god's love now our circumstances do not dictate dictate to us whether we're going to be grateful or not it is it doesn't matter if we receive the smallest blessing or we receive the greatest trial we need to give thanks we need to be grateful we need to understand that god is in our life he knows what he's doing he hasn't made any mistakes and he's in control now i think we should all just spend five minutes and saying amen amen amen amen because we we we go through so many things and we forget to give thanks if you forget to give thanks if you don't have that heartfelt feeling you're out of god's love you're out first thessalonians 5 18 says in everything give thanks in everything good bad ugly in everything give thanks when you wake up in the morning look in the mirror just give thanks you're looking at a body whose spirit of god dwells in you can find a reason to give thanks in the morning when you look in the mirror for this is the will of god in christ jesus and it's personal it's concerning you exercise it it will keep you from quenching the spirit i don't want to put out the fire of god in fact i want the blaze to go amen be careful about your words our speech and our words can become polar opposite well one minute we're saying praise the lord and the next minute we're complaining what scripture do we have for that you know so just sometimes our conversations become so polar opposite that it's hard for people to see the true gratefulness that we have so just keep it on track keep it you know keep it one direction keep keep praising them all day long keep thanking them all day no matter what happens in your life when you thank god for your tests and trials what you're doing saying god i got confidence that you're in my life you wouldn't let this happen to me for a bad reason and just to be honest do things work together for the good for you or don't they we got to come to grips with that we know the scripture is true but is it true for us and if it's truly us for us then who are we to complain to murmur to wish things were different being truly grateful it's a part of true worship all right turn with me to luke chapter 17 verse 11. remember the 10 lepers just want to touch on this before we get into our message tonight luke 17 verse 11 and it came to pass as jesus went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of sumerian angeli and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us made it real clear they wanted to receive something from god and when he saw them god be in no respect or persons here he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priest i don't know if he said anything else but this is what we do know and it came to pass that as they went to the priest they went on their way some miracle happened and they were cleansed so now at this point maybe jesus wasn't there by them maybe it was two miles down the road i don't know but now something has to take place after we receive a blessing and one of them when he saw that he was healed he turned back and with a loud voice he glorified god and he fell down on his face at his feet giving him what thanks he was a samaritan i'm probably worse than a samaritan one turn back and notice where jesus attention went to it went towards the ones that were not there and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine i expected thanks from all of them i want to say to you i want you to give thanks more than the other nine people around you because that's what god's looking for he ain't looking for you to kind of join in after somebody else gets the atmosphere going if the other night don't want to that's okay i'm moving forward i'm going to give thanks i'm going to praise him and then if god wants to from heaven say where the other then that's his business there are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and i'll think about this can you imagine having a deadly disease leprosy being healed and not wanting to give god the praise that he's worthy to be praised of now i know god blesses us every day in so many ways he blesses us and we come to church and we find it hard to even think of what things we could give thanks for you know what that's telling me that's telling me we're exercising a one-way relationship bring it on lord bring it on bring it on give it to me give me give me give me and we forget to give back to really give him praise and from my heart i love you no matter what that's what he's looking for and i know that may not be how you feel it may not be what you're wanting to hear but it is what god's wanting you to hear because that's what god is looking for god is always looking for us to return to church and give him glory don't even wait till you get to church get in your little room shut the door get down on your knees and praise them but i'll tell you what if you're not doing it in church you're not doing it at home you can't wait to get to church that's what the prophet said and he said unto him arise and go thy way thy faith have made thee whole how beautiful don't stop being grateful find ways to show it grow in gratitude that's a good one good message grow in gratitude all these things will help us remain in god's love we just need to exercise them fight to keep the flame alive so when you stay thankful you stay grateful you're keeping the flame going keep your relationship intimate not surfacing not storefront not just going through the motions keep it intimate stay there until his presence comes keep it genuine keep living for others now our natural love for god will not keep us in the love of god i mean write that down put it in don't ever forget that statement our natural love for god will never keep us in the love of god it'll never keep us in love with god we'll start to get lazy lay back we'll start living for ourselves we'll give up on things you know the prophet said we could love god every day and still miss it think about we can still love we can love god every day and still miss it it must be a different type of love there doesn't sound like any security in that love i'm looking for a love with security i believe god has that for us i believe that's god's love my love ain't secure you want to know about my love it has failed so many times i need a calculator amen it's all the times you yelled at somebody got mad at somebody didn't want to talk to somebody turn your back on somebody that's your love and if you're loving god with that love well i would never do that listen how do you know what love you're loving god with there's no security in our love we've got to we've got to reciprocate god's love back to him amen and i like what our brother said in our men's meeting today you can't give out what you don't got you can only give out what you got right isn't that right brother ferguson exactly right so we need we need the love of god how do i know i got it you're laying down your life that's how you know you got it not a feeling not an emotion not you claiming it not because he died for you but because you're laying down your life for the cause of christ but when you remain in god's agape love there's nothing that can tear you apart from god there are benefits to remaining in god's love and one of them is you can't ever get separated we can get separated by our love for god but nothing can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus romans 38 verse 5 uh romans 8 verse 35 let's just go through these real encouraging scriptures because i know i've been giving you some strong word but i'll tell you there's some benefits to remaining in god's love so now we've bypassed the section of keeping the commandments we're remaining grateful and thankful and humble and we're bearing the fruit now there are uh there are benefits now so number one is i don't i don't ever want to be separated from the love of god i'm okay honestly i'm okay with sinning and getting beat over the head by god for it but i am not okay with being separated from god that to me a separation from god is hell and you know to me if you you just think about it the whole world don't want the love of god they don't want to come under subjection they don't want to go to church they don't want to what they're doing is they're showing god i don't want you then when it comes to judgment and god says okay you chose not to want me then that's what you get separation eternal separation or forever separated right you know what i'm trying to say romans 8 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ so the things that we're going through or distress or persecution or famine nakedness or peril or sword amen amen brother bruce no as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long amen all day we don't get to do what we want to do we are counted as sheep for the slaughter we laid on our lives for one another for the lost souls we're for our sake we're killed all the day long it's showing why we can't be separated this verse which we wish we didn't read and talk about is the verse that brings security because if you don't want to crucify your flesh you don't want to be accounted as sheep for the slaughter then there is no security you are not reciprocating god's love back nay and all these things we are more than conquerors to him that loved us i love him because he first loved me we're more than conquerors to him that loved us for i persuade that neither death nor life nor angels principalities powers or or things present or things even to come who cares about the news nor height or death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from what our love to god no from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord amen now god would be a respecter persons if he chose to love only some people more than others and then there would never be a fair judgment on the day of judgment amen but there's many people going to be separated but when you reciprocate this same love back to god you cannot be separated that's where your security is at and the only way you can do it is be filled with god's love that's the only way you can give it back we got we've got the responsibility of going after perfect love of seeking it of of getting more of the holy ghost so more of the love of god can come out amen it don't just happen by church attendance for so many years it don't even happen by saying amen we've got to mean so be it right we've got to we've got to take this word home put it into use when you remain in love with god with his love you remain secure remaining in love it secures us now brother branham said that god is i don't know if he used the word always but he said god is hidden in simplicity it's so simple that smart educated intellectual men they cannot comprehend or see where god is at branham also said that he's revealed in the same simplistic way most people are trying to get to god to heaven some other way than a love relationship burning candles i mean there's just a lot of ideas out there but i i want us to catch this what we need is a genuine intimate relationship with the love of god not not just i know the word but the love of the word the love that wrote the word the love that was the motive behind that word being written we need an intimate relationship with that love which to me puts a whole another meaning of why we come to church now i can see why the prophet said we come to find out where we're at with god because there's something in me that wants to make sure that i'm doing what he wants me to do so brother branson says whatever you do lay everything aside until you get it now this relationship it's our protection it's our security when we love god back with the same love that he loved us with and i'm going to be honest with you god deserves so much more than my love my love is the pits and if cheryl was right here she'd say amen but human love just doesn't get the job done i'm going to love god back with the human love that quits when it wants to quit doesn't want to bear anything doesn't want to go the second mile doesn't want to turn the cheek and i'm going to love god with that and expect him that that is going to be good enough for our relationship it's not we've got to humble ourselves and get serious about getting filled with perfect love if the prophet said it i'm just a believer that we can get it amen i don't believe it's going to come on the last day before the rapture i believe it'll be on display it'll be on display and the bride will have it when we look when we love god back with his love we're protected from even fear how many times have we been afraid so just it was just within the last few days um my wife came out of the bathroom and i just happened to be you know going by i wasn't going like this but i just happened to be going by and she came out of the bathroom and she just said don't scare me now look i was accused of a motive of scaring her was not my motive my motive was to get to the other side of the room i had nothing to do with that situation nothing but fear was a real thing fear is real but when you are so in love with god's love you are so free from fear amen do you believe that yes amen first john chapter 4 verse 17 first john chapter 4 verse 17 herein is our love made perfect okay talking about perfect love that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world now how is that somehow we got to be like god god is love i i now when i'm talking about love i am not separating that from the word at all at all it's one and the same there is no fear in love now we're speaking of god's agape love here because my wife loves me and there's fear in our love think about it every human relationship there's fear in their love there is but in god's there isn't there isn't there is no fear in love but perfect love or complete love for god casteth out fear because fear it has torment and he that feareth is not made complete he's not made perfect in love there's still something missing so when we're battling fear you've got two choices you stand up and tell the devil to get behind you and if you don't feel you can do that you need to get on your knees and cry out to god for his love don't stand in the middle make a decision of what you're going to do god is love and he doesn't fear a thing and when that love is there it doesn't want you to fear when we fear his love is not complete in us so here was the angel coming down to to mary how many times the angel come down come down and and they were there was fear right the bible says that there was fear but you know brother bran goes on the other side and they say when brother bran says what's this going on and and they said this is what you preach was the holy ghost this is perfect love they weren't afraid of anything they weren't afraid anymore because they were in perfect love are you with me i don't think we have to wait to get there to feel it i think it's to every individual how much he wants to pay a price he deals with us as individuals amen we love him because he first loved us woe unto the man who loves god first you know what i'm saying because that love is not strong enough you've got to love god back with the love that he loved you because remember before god came to us we still had love maybe we still went to church we expressed love to one another we need to be careful that we're not satisfied with the love that we have in our heart and i'm okay if you're living a perfect life don't stop if you're laying down your life forever i'm okay with that but if that's not transpiring i want to stand behind what the prophet said and say whatever you do lay everything aside until you get it and that's a job we have to do uh because it'll be so much easier to keep his commandments amen because amen all right saint john chapter 10 verse 15 we are protected when we're in god's love security that's what we're talking about as the father knoweth me even so no i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep so here it is the the the intimate relationship the father knows the son and the son knows the father and what's the theme here i lay down my life for the sheep so there's a union or oneness between the father and the son and the subject of god's greatest expression of love here is laying down his life are you with me and he says that there's other sheep i have those are the ones he's got to lay down in his life for right which are not of this fold them also i got to bring in and they shall hear my voice they and there shall be one fold and one shepherd jesus is going after the sheep who are not in yet and the only way that they will know that they belong to jesus is something inside of them knows the voice of the shepherd and the shepherd's voice is always the word right always the word so even though they haven't been taught the word something inside of them it just registers when they hear it it's something supernatural now look at verse 17 therefore does my father love me because i lay down my life here's the reason that the father loves jesus for this thing of laying down the life that should be interest that should be important to us the father loves jesus for giving up his life so that the other sheep can come in wow that's the love i want i want that love inside of me no man taketh it from me there's no manipulation here the there's no force of the father yes he was in the garden and he said father if it's possible let this cup pass from me but he waited there the father waited until jesus said but not my will thine be done there was no force there was no manipulation and jesus said i lay down my life and this is why the father loves me because i lay down my life willingly now he knew he'd take it up he's got power to lay it down power to take it up again and i'll say it like this if you lay down your life by revelation you know the power inside of you is going to raise you up in the end there's no fear there's no fear all right let's drop down to 27 john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice now i know them and they follow me his personal sheep hear the voice of the lord speaking now what is he saying to these sheep what is he saying to them that they'll follow any ideas i love you okay it's a it's a good question i mean think about how he came to you what did he say to you how did he get you all right i think it's the same thing that he said in luke chapter 9 we're going to just leave there for a second luke chapter 9 verse 23 and he said to them all if any man will come after me in other words well follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it well i know when i was being introduced i went to church i went to a a catholic church but i didn't know god didn't know didn't know god at all in fact i was when something triggered in here i wanted to know god when i was being introduced to god by god i know he told me i had to give up my life not just say i'm sorry for my past sins and continue to do what you want to do that is not the message i got the message i got was i had to give up my life so the choice was there i remember this as clear as day i remember it if if i'm gonna serve god then i'm gonna have to give up cheryl i'm gonna have to give up my music and i remember that that choice had to be made and i'm so glad i made the right choice because when you make the right choice you put god first the promise is you'll save your life it'll raise up in the last day oh i just love this this scripture my sheep hear my voice i know them and they follow me so jesus says how how to really follow how the sheep are going to follow they're going to deny their will how many people have come been baptized in this church i'll tell you if everybody remained in this church that we have baptized from the beginning this room wouldn't be big enough for standing room only but they wanted salvation they started out but they didn't deny their will and when you don't deny your will you're still doing your own i don't care how you slice it my sheep hear my voice i know them and they deny themselves and they take up their cross and follow me that's that's the way it goes that word follow means part of a union if you look that word up follow it means part of a union it means to be in the same way with that is to accompany so here jesus follows the father and he follows them to do exactly what the father said which is to lay down your life and the sheep follow jesus and what do they accompany with what are they the same with in laying down their life it's no different that's what the voice is leading us to so jesus lay down his life in the flesh at calvary and that same spirit lives now in us and we're leading others to that same calvary we're pointing them to jesus we're showing them what they have to do just like we did right there's no grandchildren we all are sons and daughters they follow our company just like jesus did and they're laying down their life just like jesus did he says i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand now there's the security the people that have come and gone where is the security and i don't care what the devil's taught them or told them in the word there's no security you have to remain with christ my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand he said i and my father are one so the father's hand jesus said it doesn't matter you're one and we become one with him because he's gripping us word upon word line upon line hallelujah i don't want to follow jesus part way i think there's been a lot of people have been plucked out the only way that you'll get plucked out is if you don't remain in love with jesus we can get out of the ark of safety our children out of the ark of safety listening to the wrong thoughts the wrong spirits if the prophet had to get desperate it was desperate for his children we have to get desperate for our children i just say keep praying for him keep believing for him but this is a it's a serious thing very very serious hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren if we're really following jesus the way he wants us to we will be laying down our lives for others now this is to me one of the biggest revelations of the whole bible because our flesh resists dying out it it it will it'll go as far as paying ties it will do certain things and it wants to settle right there but how many people paid ties and didn't love god did not lay down their life the call the voice that i heard is to lay down my life for the sheep and i don't believe that is just for certain individuals i believe that's for all of us amen time is i just want to read just a little bit more okay psalms 91 verse 1 he's our refuge our fortress our rock all right there's security now when we reciprocate god's love back he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty there's a secret place for us i will say of the lord he is my refuge my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the stare of the follower and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings thou shalt trust he his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid by the terror by night nor by the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness or the destruction that wasted that noon day a thousand shall fall thy side and ten thousand at their right side but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shall thou behold the reward of the wicked now look at verse 9 because thou has set up because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation now to me this is where you're dwelling yes in the word yes in christ and yes in love you can't separate the word in in love the love of god you can't separate the two people try but you can't there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any place come thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge whoever they to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in thy in it in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone thou shall tread upon the line they added the young lion and the dragon shall thou trample under feet now look at verse 14 because he has set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him not because god loves us he delivers us but the security comes when we set our love upon we reciprocate it back for i will set him up on i because he have known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer i will be with him and trouble i will deliver him and i will honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation the security is when we set our the love of god that we have in our heart back upon him colossians 3 verse 1 says if you be risen with christ seek those things which are above which christ saith on the right hand of god we're ending with this set your affection on things above set your affection on things above not on this earth for your dead and your life is hid with christ and god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory and we don't got to but when you've got time i want you to read this chapter that's your homework not that we're going to be going into this sunday because god willing you know we're not we're just going to be speaking on communion but if you read this chapter in verse 5 so we're supposed to set our affections on christ and the first thing here in verse 5 he says mortify the deeds of your flesh count yourself as sheep for the slaughter you're just you're you're dead to your will don't don't don't have the wrong uh look at verse eight but now ye put off the old man anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication ever lying out one to the other senior put off the old man with his deeds and put on the new man now what is going to be described here is the love of god verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bows of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another what do i need that for because you've been a to lay down your life for people forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a crawl against even as christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these put on charity which is the bond of perfectness this is what we love god back with when we're willing to put this on for our brothers and our sisters there is so much security when you reciprocate that same love back to god and that's what i want that's security i don't want a false sense of security i don't want to think i got i want to assume i got something when i don't that's why the prophet said whatever you do get it get perfect love because there'll be no false sense of security in that you'll have the goods then amen let's stand together keep setting your affections on things above did you get something out of this amen praise the lord sorry for the extra minutes here it's not my desire to to go extra especially on a on a wednesday but i want us to rejoice because there's security there is a place of security in christ that doesn't matter if the bottom falls out doesn't matter if nobody shakes your hand loves us no matter what anybody does there's a security in christ and we can go after that and i just i want to i guess if i can say it like this blend our hearts in prayer right now and and be be the one that goes after it if nine don't be the one that comes back and praises god for what he's done the love he's he should have brought in your heart be that one if there's if jesus died if there was one that would receive him he would have died for that one if there's one that will praise him for what he's worthy of and live from for what is worthy you be that one even if nobody else does amen let's bow in our hearts and our heads in prayer for just a moment heavenly father we thank you for thy precious word lord that is a light to our path it helps us to see clearly lord your word even declares that if there's some sort of hatred in our heart for a brother that we're in darkness we're blind we can't see straight because your love is so great it is able to love the unlovable and lord i pray that you would feel a soulful of your love that we would reciprocate it back to you by keeping your commandments and doing what you've called us to do lord help us to exercise the things that we can do that would just create an atmosphere around each of us to where you'll want to come and fill our very beings with so much love that would just go out looking for the lost sheep lord we want you to love us like the father loved you because you lay down your life lord we want we want to be the vessel that you used to continue to carry out the work that the father had set into place you said at the cross it is finished the price of redemption was finished but the work is still going on for the res getting the lost souls in lord in the midst of all of our lives stir our hearts for souls put a burden on our heart for souls help us to give up our time to spend whatever we got to spend our time lord to to use it for your kingdom we know the devil wants to get us so busy so compounded with problems and issues that we just hardly got time for you lord but i pray o god that you would feel us so full of your spirit that we'll have a revelation of what you want us to do with your time our time lord because it's really your life it's the only thing we can give back to you lord because it's only anything you've given us choice of is our heart and our time help us to give it to you lord bless your your saints lord bless those not only that are here but those that are live streaming perhaps will be some that may listen to the archive and lord of in their heart they feel that this message has has been for them i pray oh god that you would come and visit them with your love o god visit them with your love and may they they set their affections on on things above and begin to reciprocate that love back to you by loving your children granted lord we thank you for these things we commit ourselves as a body as a church into your hands and father we just ask that you continue to prepare our hearts for the communion next service lord we need you unless you come lord and help us lord as it were flying lord blind and we need you to show us our heart is deceitful we can't even know it unless you show us oh god lord we just want things to be right and pleasing and we know that we we won't be perfect but we want to be perfect in our heart lord we want to be doing our very best lord jesus i'll pray that you deal with us prepare us lord that we may be found pleasing as we take the communion with you we praise you thank you for all these things now we humbly pray in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen please [Music] let me be pleasing to you that everything that i do pleasing to you praise let everything i be pleasing no more [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you pray let everything i [Music] one more time please let me be pleasing to you let
