worthy to be praised amen well God bless you uh this wonderful morning I I'm I apologize to you that our uh anniversary meetings have been postponed uh for probably to the fall our brother will come back out um and uh I'm sorry that and brother Daryl wanted me to tell you sorry as well he got some drywall dust in his eyes they were pretty bad in the in the uh the doctor just said that he did not advise him to fly so that that was it or else he was just coming with red eyes and uh that would have been fine too he said I just didn't want if I if depending on what the doctor he says he says I just don't want you to think I was drinking that's what he said but he wanted to be here and I um I I just don't uh I I we just can't be what brother Daryl is and uh so but I want I want you to be inspectation of the Lord amen um it was a day before yesterday just as we found out late um in the day Friday I just looked at my wife and I said you know this was I don't I don't really know what to do because I actually told Brother Daryl I said brother Daryl I was looking forward to you coming because I really I was really wanting to receive from the Lord personally this is just for me and I told my wife I says I I have no idea what to preach because what I had been studying was not it I just knew that you just know and uh so I want to thank you for your prayers this morning he did come and just give us a little thought and before we begin reading in the Bible I thought we could just look to God in prayer and it will open up to Luke Chapter 18. just ask his his presence amongst us Heavenly Father We Want to Thank You Lord that we can we can worship you here in your presence it's not just something way far off but your word declares we're just two or three are gathered together in your name there you'll be in the midst father we have felt your presence this morning we thank you for the songs of Zion we thank you for the the special we thank you for you for you Lord you are the one that makes our gathering worth coming and now we pray Lord that you would take your precious word and burn it into our hearts oh God we invite the Holy Spirit into breaking of the bread of life today only you can break it down to meet our needs Lord to make it to where it changes our life our nature and Lord we come to the pattern that you'd have us to be Lord we love you this morning we just thank you for your precious word we commit the service into you your hands now as we wait furtherance on thee and we give you the glory in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen God bless you if you return to Luke chapter 18 Luke chapter 18. and we're going to begin reading there just the first eight verses we've read these before we're going to take just a little different thought and these want to invite our guests today in the back here this man in the brown i i i Terry is his name and this man has been very gracious to us he's the one that introduced us to more than probably three quarters of the machines that we have in her shop he's just been a really good friend to us and has helped us out in the business and he's looking for the Lord in his life and I believe he's come to the right place and we want to also want to welcome again our neighbor Patricia with us and um thank you for coming may the Lord bless each of you so good to see sister Linda Helms amongst us amens the Bible says and he spake a parable unto them to this and now notice the purpose of the parable that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there wasn't a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge lest by her continual coming to me she weary me and the Lord said pay attention hear what the unjust judge saith and now and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen God bless you may be seated we uh I believe that Brother Bruce did a really good job on Wednesday and we just appreciate him very very much last Sunday we ministered on ready or not here I come and here the question is asked by Jesus nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth so God is coming whether we have faith or don't have faith right the end is going to happen we can't do anything to stop it the thing that we can do today is be ready like to entitle this my personal deliverer and for a subject calling on God brother Brandon said in the message Abraham he said wake up won't you bite your conscience won't you pinch your soul amen and we need to remember Jesus is still on the boat in our life we just got to get serious the illustration has come a number of times you'll wake him up I say we got to wake him up in our boat in our life because it seems sometimes that God is distant from us and he's not hearing our prayers the way we want to but he's amongst us amen you see this woman she cried out Cried Out cried out so when we want to be Avenged we want someone to vindicate us do you ever want somebody to go to bat for you and help you with your situation yes vindicate me of my adversary this helpless riddle had some serious problems that she needed attention with and she was in a desperate State and no one was able to help her except this uh unjust judge he was he was a worldly man and he didn't care about anything except himself he didn't fear God he didn't respect God he didn't even possess the beginning of wisdom it was just all him all about him he didn't care about being right or wrong his conscience had been seared and on top of that he didn't care about anybody else he didn't regard people you know what do we often talked about corrupt judges in our nation and how they get paid off and how they get Personal Agenda I can see this judge it was all about him what he could get this judge had power to help her situation but was completely selfish and self-centered in his thinking yet because of his selfish motive he had a selfish motive which was to get her off her back she he decided to do something amen and this judge he simply didn't want to be bothered anymore he didn't want to be wore out fatigued and drained and spent over this situation anymore he was becoming uncapable in functioning right so he took care of the problem now if that could happen in the world how much more is God going to take care of us we are the apple of his eye we're in the palm of his hand no man can pluck us out in fact Jesus said fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom he has chosen us from the foundation of the world and he's going to see us through the Bible says he which had begun a good work in you is going to finish it how much more shall God take care of his own elect we've been predestinated and Jesus said shall not God Avenged his own elect Romans 8 tells us who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect think about it think of all the times that you've been accused now I just want to say this right or wrong right or wrong Vengeance belongs to God who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect God has become our judge when we surrender our life to God God now is our judge God is our protection we have to go through God he is our he's our jury he's our our defense he's our personal deliverer amen right it is God that justifieth and by faith we're Justified by faith in what Christ has already done for us we're Justified now just that that's for our sins and there's the greatest thing that we could do that could happen to our life is be saved from our sins and God Justified us as if we never sinned now how much more is he going to take care of our situations in her life amen God's got this he's got this if God be for you who can be against you everything is going to work out so what can we say to these things we need to say Glory Glory Glory to God that's what we need to say amen God who did not spare his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things how many has a need of God in your life amen so all things all things Philippians 4 19 says my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus now I'd like to read it like this my personal God my personal God it's got to be personal to you every need is going to be met all of them right why are we hovering over certain ones what's happening is our faith is being attacked what do we have to worry about brother John you don't understand you don't get my situation it's not the same it's different and I am put in a pickle I'm put in a box and this pressure is so great in my life that it's just different and you don't understand Now isn't that how the devil plants his seed in fact my Situation's getting worse I don't see the deliverer I see the problem becoming magnified and it's causing other problems we need to watch our testimony remember often what we say is what happens he is the high priest of our profession if we profess God isn't going to help us there's a good chance he's not going to help us but if we profess that God is going to help us he's Duty bound to stand for our profession in him our confession in him done so we need to watch your testimony not just in our words but our thoughts because they speak louder in heaven we don't have a lot of time but you can write this down Revelations chapter 12 verses 7 through 17 we don't have time to read it but I want to pull one verse out of there and it's verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death it isn't just the blood it's your testimony in that blood it's the word of your testimony we need our testimony to be right to overcome this is the ingredients to overcoming we can't just say Jesus died for me and you're not going to testify he died for you because we're going to be tested we're going to be tried we're going to be put right there to the fiery furnace and see if we really are going to believe what we say and we need our Our Testimony to be exactly what the Bible says exactly what the word says you need to believe what the word says about you more than what you feel about yourself we are Overcomers greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world we need to believe that word what it's saying about us and that is how we overcome that is what God is looking for in our lives we need to start calling those things which be not as though they were I say like this woman this little woman we need to be constantly constantly calling on God and we need to let the devil know all the time where we're standing [Music] because he sees how his negative thoughts begin to infilter in our lives and calls us to think on things and say things and all of a sudden we're starting to talk about our not only our problems but other people's problems more than same with the word is saying for victory for us yeah we need to stop considering our circumstances as unmanageable for God we need to stop staggering around at God's promises for our lives and just take that word and believe it for you personally you need to build ourselves up in the Most Holy Faith testify of what the word says yeah the devil's going to come and he's going to taunt you he's going to say you don't really mean that doesn't matter what he says you don't have to feel it you don't have to have electricity coming out of your body you just have to believe the word the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass turn with me if you would to Second Kings chapter 13. we just need to be fully persuaded that what God has promised he will perform second Kings chapter 13. now here's a story that we a few verses is going to tell us a story where we can learn that God has an answer for our situation and that we play a part in that you remember when God called the children of Israel out of Egypt he did it the by himself I mean yes he used Moses but he did it himself and then God put it this commandment out there that you need to believe that there is a promised land for you and they failed to fight that faith Joshua and Caleb said we're more than able to make it and the other ones they just murmured and complained and we can learn from these set of scriptures here that we have a part to play amen verse starting with verse number 14 and Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness wherever he died and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said oh father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof and Elisha said unto him take bow and arrows notice he didn't tell him how many did it take bowl and arrows and he took unto him bowl and arrows and he said to the king of Israel put thy hand upon the ball and he put his hand upon the ball and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands and he said open the window Eastward and he opened it and then Elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the Lord's Deliverance and the arrow of Deliverance for Syria for thou shall Smite the syrians in Apec till thou has consumed them and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of Israel Smite upon the ground and he smote three I'm sorry he smoked twice Thrice which means three and stayed he just shot three and then he stayed didn't do anything else now you would think he followed the instructions right in other words I I praise God I asked God I cried out to God three times and the man of God was Wrath with him and said thou should have smitten five or six times then as thou Smit in Syria till thou had consumed it whereas now Thou shalt Smite Syria but Thrice you know a lot of times we go to God because things are just really bothering us we cry out to him as soon as we get to help with that thing we just stop we get a little Victory we just stop and then this things start happening again and what we can learn from this is that God has an arrow of Deliverance for every one of our situations but we need to get serious and not just do a little bit but we need to do fiber so we need to keep calling on God because God will see you through you have to do your part you can't just well God you know my heart you know what I'm being bothered by you know what's needed no God is looking for some you know how would you like to go out with somebody that didn't really put their heart into you nobody wants to marry some computer right I mean when we read a book we get inspired we see two people kissing or loving we say wow I wish that must be sweet that's that's wonderful it's the way it should be we see two people just cold God wants a relationship he wants us to call upon him not just say God if you're you're supposed to take care of all this stuff no we still have to reverence the Lord amen you have to plead with them now one purpose that God intended this Parable for was to keep us praying in desperation to our situation gets taken care of and we're not going to overcome if our prayers are not overcoming you understand what I'm saying if we go to God and complain we go to God and murmur we go to God and just say this is everything that's he knows what's happening he's looking for us to start having faith in what's going on in our heart that we're trusting him we're trusting in the word of God that he has provided a way of excitement we don't know what it is we don't need to know what it is we just need to believe that he's going to do it now we're living in the hour where we're all being buffeted by our adversary right right on every side many things I want to talk about one thing that's really strong there's a strong Spirit trying to get us to slow down to give up to turn around to just kind of yeah what's the use nothing makes it different nothing changes I can't see the light of the end of the tunnel has anybody dealt with that spirit let me just see who am I talking to amen it's a real real spirit in this age Jesus said nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth the question is the question we should ask is Jesus going to find faith in us when he returns or is he going to see us falling away from the faith we're told at the hour of his return that it would be just the opposite of faith second Thessalonians 2 3 if you write it want to write it down let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first Christians are falling away from the faith that was once delivered to them people are leaving the messages in the in the world people are leaving modern Christianity more than they ever have evil is prevailing that's why we need to be earnestly contending for the faith more I read this that more and more people are describing their religious identity as atheist atheists agnostic or really nothing in particular they stopped believing in God now that's the spirit in this age that we're fighting I'm not saying we're doing that I'm saying that spirit is fighting us and it wears us down churches are having to compromise just to keep people in the churches you preach the word anymore people go somewhere else to find Satan gives them some good ideas all you got to do is compromise with the word a little bit lower your standard Don't Preach about holiness in other words they let the goats in true just enter just entertain them and they'll come to church [Music] just have a concert a comedian short little message God loves you everything's okay Paul being a prophet turn with me to Second Timothy chapter 3 verse one Paul being a prophet God showed him what kind of spirit there would be inside of the church when he comes that's how bad it's getting and this is you we all know this scripture but it just Bears repeating this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come now just I want you to look at this as not I don't want you to I so much identify this as somebody that you think in the church has one of these I I don't want you to do that but how I want you to look at that is this spirit trying to get you and then just ask which one of these Spirits are trying to get you for men shall be lovers of their own self covetous bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful uh sure appreciate that Psalm this morning amen Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers you know I'll tell you what we got enough Satan accusing us what do we need others to accuse us we are leading to somebody to help us incontinent in other words without self-control Fierce despisers of those that are trying to do good Traders saying you're going to do something and then months later you don't do it heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power of verse 7 ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now is James Janice and James withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth they're men of corrupt Minds reprobates worthless Haster ways concerning what the faith when the son of man comes shall he find faith and you see these spirits that get on us and and trying to get us just to to not give ourselves totally to God will cause us to fit in to these things right while we're in the church the spirit of this age is to withstand God's truth that's what the spirit of air is that's what the spirit of Satan is that's what the spirit of the devil is he don't want you here at church right and he certainly don't want you in a church that preaches the truth and I don't care what Spirits are attacking you have attacked you there is a deliverer and he can personally deliver you if you just confess it to God's tell God what's going on Amen if we baby it Church men of corrupt Minds the laodicean age has turned into the age of apostasy a great Falling Away there are scoffers that people are getting worse and worse the love of many is waxing cold now I just I just want to say something that I have seen in the last 15 years now I watch people I've been that way since I was a kid I'll work with people I have friends I have family I have precious brothers and sisters and if there's one thing that I've seen change is the love of many waxing more cold now they'll have an excuse they all blame somebody they all blame someone but they won't listen to Jesus because Jesus said because iniquity abounds because iniquity abounds in your life Your Love Will wax code right but if you stay on fire you be faithful you keep reading your Bible you keep praying you keep calling on God you keep crying out to him and our God is faithful he will fill you with the love of God I'll tell you what I love about Joshua and Caleb for 45 years they've stood in a congregation that just didn't want to submit to God but you know they were so faithful they loved everyone they kept the same attitude we can make it out of here just change your attitude and God will see you through that's what we need we need Joshua and Caleb's the sibo spirit is constantly working against us buffiness on every side trying to get us to give up on our own steadfastness remember the time she said oh yeah I'm going to be faithful and then after a while it was doesn't matter if I come it's trying to get us to lose hope lose our beginning confidence that we had right not holding it firm to the end Satan I remember one time brother Mark was preaching he said that Satan is always trying to get us to lay down our our Christian armor because as soon as you just relax that's when the enemy can get in there and this is the spirit that we're fighting Hebrews 12 3 12 says take heed brethren lest there be and any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God we need to fight the good fight of faith we need to keep pressing you can't look at your feelings how many times have your feelings lied to you I mean it happens all the time yet for some reason we're just so stuck on believing the next one we have we never just okay this could be wrong what does the word say no we go by our feelings I tell you what we're needing is we need to get a re-energizing in our walk with God and just forget about our problems I don't mean it wrong but look God will put every single human being on the planet in the spot that they can't do nothing about something they can only trust God and that's where we're going to make the choice I trust you in my situation it isn't just what you're going through the person next to you has gone through it if they're not going through it now and here's the one thing we're always going through something I was in the room and just I just feel like God has just been really crushing me and God you know why God puts you in pain he puts you in pain so you are forced to look to him trials fulfill a purpose and our attitude towards them should be counted all joy to be grateful that God is in control of your life and that what he put in your life is causing you to look to him oh glory to God because we're not doing it enough we need to be like this woman and cry out till more our walks sometimes get so starchy I think we just need to get more desperate about this adversary that's trying to take us down trying to take our family down we need to get more desperate keep getting desperate keep fighting like this woman was fighting she was a good example for the elect Jesus thought so amen we just can't I'll tell you this is why I could see now the wisdom that brother Branham had when he said that you ministers you need to stay away from predestination it'll confuse the people you tell some of their predestined and chosen so much they don't think they need to cry out anymore I'll tell you if we are the elect we will be crying out that's what this message is for is to get us calling on God more don't wait till you feel like it we got a good concert everybody in the church is telling you you're the best you're the best person in the church that ain't gonna happen we need God on the inside keep digging keep digging so the question is when God comes is he going to see you in the faith not intellectual now in the faith that is producing a life and a testimony with your words in the things that you're doing or is he going to see that you are falling away from the original it ain't going to just happen we've got to fight for it we need to be fighting for this Faith now what is the faith think about you when you first God first called you it was all about salvation when Christ came into your life it was the greatest thing that happened on Earth I'm going to tell you that's still the greatest thing on the planet that's still the cause of Christ that's what we should be doing today when he looked at Peter he said follow me and I'll make you Fishers of Men I want to save you I want to pray for you that your faith fail not and I want to use you to win souls now what was the Great Commission before he left go out into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing them teaching them to do whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I am with you to the end so in the end when he returns is he going to find you doing that or is he going to find you while I'm in and that's all that really matters come on now don't tell me you're not called we're all called we're all called to share Jesus and I'll tell you this when God came into my life I just couldn't help but tell somebody you remember that you were bubbling it's a bubbling it's a bubbling but what's happening the Devil comes in her life and he pollutes it with a lot of worldliness and carnality and and they're they're we become negative and the only thing we do is we start to see problems and everything else and everybody else that's right and that's the spirit that we're fighting well how do you fight against it start calling on God call out to God do what Jesus said he gave us this Parable for a reason don't let the devil rock you to sleep our Salvation is nearer than when we first believed do you believe that it's a high time to to wake up to rise up we don't want to sleep like the the modern church is sleeping if I could say it like this we're the elect we need to act like it we need to get desperate stay desperate have our testimony of our mouth always being positive there's needs in our life there's needs in our family there's needs in her church I wonder who wants to be so close to God that you intervene you see we have a job to do but Satan's job is to get you thinking about all that not just your problems but all your your desires all your goals all the things that you want to do get so involved that you forget about Christ and but you spend more time in prayer you'll get more balance more connected and you'll be doing the right things we can't get lazy we can't shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night not just that woman not just that little woman but his own elect need to cry out day and night though he bear long with them if you want to see God move more in your lives you need to move more with God need to cry out more now the modern Church isn't going to be crying out they're lukewarm they're cold in the sense of uh well they're lukewarm but they're they're they're not sold out they're not really sold out so they're part of the group that sometimes is praising God and sometimes they're not but they're miserable they're blind they become in a lukewarm state to where they have this attitude I need nothing I don't need you to tell me what to do I don't need to come under subjection God has already saved me this is between me and God and I don't need any man telling me what I need to do that's the spirit and unless we go to God we cry out we're zealous to repent we're zealous I'll tell you this is for the Church of the Living God we've got to overcome the spirit we can't have the attitude I've already overcame it and I'm in the message now friends that ain't it that spirit is just as real today it's trying to bring you down you know how many people are in this message that are in laodicea yes excuse me for bobbing back and forth I need like this cage right here a little thing to keep me right here foreign we can't get comfortable because we know we're sitting in a church that preaches all the truth it don't work we need that Living Truth in us when God speaks to our heart something inside of our hearts says yes to the word that was preached to us is bearing witness the spirit and it says bearing witness with his spirit that we are the children of God we are the elect of God and that word spoken is for me not for somebody else that's what I hate about this Spirit about coming to church about just I got all I just want you to speak about this and just you know just this one thing I'll tell you the things where God is coming he has did things in my life and has crushed me and things that have happened I'll tell you I don't I don't see it coming from the left-hander to the right God don't need my okay we need to come to this house and say God where am I with you speak to me I need to hear what you want me to do because that's all that matters we need to run to God In Prayer Proverbs 18 10 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and they're safe we know where to go righteous man falls down what does he do he doesn't say well everybody falls I'm just going to stay down here this he gets back up gets in the race the Bible says some trust in chariots some trust in horses I'll say some trust in themselves but we will remember the name of our Lord our God Psalms 18 verse 2 the Lord is my rock my Fortress my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my buckler my horn of my salvation and my high tower you talk about a personal belief David said my can you say my we don't want to look at God is just a deliverer he's got to be your personal deliverer verse 3 says I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies amen that's without what a woman was doing she was calling upon the Lord yeah you might get a little discouraged but you need to keep doing it I don't care if the word rebukes you look we've got to remember no man should ever be rebuking another person if there's rebuking that has to be done you better make sure that's the Holy Ghost In You and God is he's the one that sets the order in the church man he's the one that sets the order in our life there was a woman she just wanted help from Jesus to heal her daughter and the word just came out and said you're not worthy for what you're asking for but her attitude was that is the truth Lord I am not worthy her attitude is what brought the results I don't believe this little woman felt she was worthy when she was going to the uh uh going to the judge because she kept coming pleading over and over and over we just got to come in that right spirit that right attitude God will take care of the situations I'll say when you get personal with God that's when God gets personal with you when you can start to put your name in the scriptures draw an eye to God and he'll draw an eye to you brother Brandon said in the message to reproach for the cause of the word he talked about an old Captain his name was John quartz he got sick near and to death on the ship and God had ordained a boy who read his Bible and his mom read the Bible to him and he was on this particular voyage and the boys said to the captain let me tell you Captain how that my mother used to read it said here's the way she wrote it he was wounded for Willie Pruitt's iniquity and he was chastised for Willie Pruitt and all things that he'd done was for Willie Pruitt that was his name you know Willie Pruitt and the old Captain said I like that I like that could you read my name in it and the little boy said I'll try and he said he was wounded for John quartz's transgressions he was bruised for John quartz's iniquity and with his stripe John courts was healed and the old Captain said I see it I see it the Lord healed him because he put his name in the book it became personal to him he said Brother Brad says read your name in it he was wounded for William bradham's transgressions he was bruised for William bradham's iniquities he did that for me and he did that for you just read your name in it can you say Amen the gospel was for the whole world but only you can accept it for you you can't accept it for anybody and we certainly don't want to say it's true but you know many times we heard this I know I know it's true but it's not for me a lot of times Christians who come to church feel the same way oh yeah I know you know God loves me but I'm an overcomer I don't know I don't feel like it what I've been going through you got to put your name in the book you got to get serious with the devil that taunts you that lies to you that tells you you can't overcome you believe that there was a woman she was in dire need she had a blood issue for 12 years and you talk about Hope being against her she had tried so many things for 12 years but she didn't give up when she came to service that day Jesus was going to be preaching and she came with this intent she was desperate if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment and she pressed through the crowd she pressed through the people she did what she had to do to touch him now you touch Jesus with your faith if you can believe for your situation God can give it to you do not say I'm believing and it don't ha and it didn't happen don't you say that you just keep believing I'm not saying you're doubting I'm just saying keep believing there's a difference if there's something wrong with your faith God will straighten that out but you just need to keep confessing you need to keep believing all right Matthew 20 verse 29. Matthew 20 verse 29 here's a little uh example in the Bible of what we need to be doing I believe today there's a couple Blind Men that had a need and as they Departed uh uh as they departed from Jericho a great multitude followed him so this must be Jesus and his disciples when they departed from Jericho a great multitude followed him and behold two blind men sitting by the wayside when they heard that Jesus had passed by cried out saying have mercy on us O Lord thou son of David and the multitude noticed everybody in church rebuked them said you need to be quiet you need to hold your peace but you know what they did the Bible says they cried the more saying have mercy on this O Lord thou son of David I'll tell you there is nobody here that can help you but Jesus if you're here for help don't you let anything discourage you don't you let anything that said anything any talk behind your back anything that's happened discourage you you are here for Jesus have mercy on us O Lord thou son of David and Jesus Stood Still and called them and said what will you have what will ye that I shall do unto you and they said unto him Lord that her eyes may be open so Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him now don't you think Jesus has the same compassion on you as he did them I don't care what the situation is I don't care what the request is Jesus cares about us he cares for you Pastor cares upon Him He cares for you but you have a part to play if you were to just sat on the wall you probably would watch Jesus go by or if you cried out once and you said God I need you in church and everybody kind of looked at you at the long necks maybe Jesus would have went by but they kept calling until Jesus said what would you have me to do sometimes it takes a little bit not that God doesn't see us cry out the first time he wants us to give a little bit more amen now we have our own personal deliver here in 2023 amen we don't have to go back and wish I was back then with Jesus because Jesus is here it's purposeful that he doesn't appear In the Flesh like he did before and Paul said we we don't uh we knew Jesus in the flesh but we don't know Jesus Anymore in the flesh they that know Christ they know him in the spirit amen right and and and and we need to look for God in the spirit now it's not here well this invisible thing it's right here this is Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart and that's where he'll meet us every one of us well brother John Jesus is in my heart yes he's in your heart but I just want to ask you a question brother sister is he got full control of your heart is he in every door of your heart I think he's knocking at the door he wants to have more preeminence I believe that with all my heart Psalms 86 3 Psalms 86 verse 3 be merciful unto me O Lord for I cry unto thee daily it's okay you don't have to look like oh yeah you got the power of God and everything's with you and you're just everything's going great your life and look up to me no you can just be the real you be merciful to me o God I need you I need some Deliverance I cry unto thee daily that's the same thing this woman was doing Rejoice for the soul of thy servant For unto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul you know we're not looking for an outward body we got to lift up our hearts and our soul to the Lord amen for thou Lord art good and ready to forgive aren't you grateful for that all we have to do is say Lord I am sorry I am sorry I don't if I I'll tell you I believe I have said I'm sorry and more in the last three days I could say at least a hundred times well that's a lot just think about how many times you said sorry in the last three days see how that compares we need to be zealous about it I am just sorry of how rotten I am I'm just rotten I can't look at myself in the mirror and say you're a pretty good chap I just can't do it and and I believe we need to maintain that Spirit don't you for thou Lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous and mercy unto all them that call upon thee now notice he didn't say unto the righteous he said to them that call we have a job to do give your O Lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications in the day of trouble why call upon thee for thou will answer me you know we sing a song in his time I know a lot of times we pray and nothing happens but you're just in the process you're just in the process it doesn't change anything yes we want it to be changed right now yes we want what we want right now but God is the one that decides and we should respect that Psalms 55 16 as for me I will call upon God and the Lord shall save me look at these beautiful scriptures evening morning and at noon will I pray and cry aloud brother John we're in church you know shhh you know if there's any activity in the church that's praising God is quite in order even the scripture says aloud I will cry aloud don't be afraid to call on God you are sitting next to brothers and sisters who have the same need that's Jesus Christ in your life just be yourself Hallelujah I love this word he Verse 18 he have delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me God will give us peace in our situations [Music] now we need to call upon the Lord more we need to cry out to him we need to get desperate if I as I've said sometimes we're a little too sheepish am I saying that right cheapest we're we're a little bit um I don't know kind of like like we're too embarrassed to cry out to God maybe a little too dignified sometimes some guys we go to church and we see others and we think that that they're going to extremes like in our mind we've kind of judged the situation that this is not proper this is not etiquette this is not order but maybe they really really are getting serious with God and it kind of makes us feel uneasy there was a group of people in the Bible who thought Jesus as followers were going to an extreme and we could read about it Luke 19 verse 37 if you want to they were spreading out even their clothes for and and Palms in front of Jesus so a donkey and him could write on it it looked like a little bit of extreme can you imagine it's raining somebody runs out there and grabs the coat their coat and they put it down just so you could walk into church that would seem like an extreme well this is what was happening in Luke 19 verse 37 and when he was come nigh even Into The Descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen the problem is when you stop looking at him you stop praising keep looking at them saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the religious Pharisees from among the multitude said unto Jesus master review thy disciples they're out of order rebuke them and he answered and said unto them I tell you if they should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out now this scripture tells me how much God wants me to praise him that's what this scripture tells me and then if I don't do it he's going to get it from somebody else God wants to be praised personally in spirit and Truth the Bible says that's what he's looking for it might seem that God's taken a long time to help us but he's in the process of helping us he's he may be looking for us to get in our proper place of just calling on them that's between you and God I just know that God's faithful I know we entertain a lot of thoughts that God's not with us and God's not going to do this and I wonder what's going to happen with this but I'll tell you God is faithful and that's all that matters we go up and down but God Remains the Same now who is our adversary can I want to shoot that clock for until I'm done laughs who is our adversary it's good we got two good answers we have two adversaries the first the Bible says that that old serpent called the devil and Satan who deceiveth the whole world and Peter brings them out just like this in in First Peter chapter 5 verse 7 and you just you know this scripture just like the widdle woman who pleaded with the unjust judge he tells us to cast all of our cares upon free careth for us so I say keep asking keep pleading keep knocking keep crying out spend more time in the prayer closet yes spend more come to church early and pray be sober now look at this verse eight that's what I want to get to be sober he wants every one of us to be on alert be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a wrong line he's walking about seeking whom he can get right and he wants to devour you now we know he's a lion without teeth we do know that but we see his purpose he still wants to devour us now he can't come and on his own will and chop us but he can get you in a weak State he can keep gnawing at you get it none on you without teeth to get you in a weak state to where you just don't feel like trying you've got a reason not to praise God you've got a reason not to call on God and you know what you never get stronger in that state did anybody ever do that and say well I did the right thing I feel so strong in the Lord right now no the devil brings you down more and that's why we need to be sober because our our adversary the Devil he's walking around waiting to catch somebody in that condition he even told Peter Jesus told Peter that Satan has desired to sift you like wheat but I prayed for you what was the answer prayer prayer was the answer that our faith failed not when he comes shall he find faith in the earth we need to pray amen men ought to pray and not faint men ought always to pray and not faint prayer was the answer to Faith not failing so look at verse 9 who resists steadfast in what the faith resist him in the faith that isn't like this big powerful thing coming on you Jesus I rebuke you in Jesus name no you just simply no I'm not entertaining that resist him in the faith I'm staying with the what the word says about me not how I feel not my sickness not what's going on I am staying with the word whom resists steadfast and faith knowing that the same afflictions don't tell me yours is worse the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world we're going through things we need to be praying for one another but the grace of God which have called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after you have what suffered a while what was that woman doing going to the judge suffering a while make you perfect strengthen I'm sorry establish strengthen and settle you that's that's God's desire for our lives but there's a purpose in our suffering we don't know always what it is but there's a purpose he's just looking for us to stay connected to him do you believe that now we have adversaries and neither of them we have two adversaries and neither of them are your brother and your sister amen how many times do we spend time thinking about a human being when we're thinking about our enemy that is not the Holy Ghost a bit that's the enemy trying to start something and then he just steps on the way and he just lets him go at it then we become a tool we become a tool in the devil's hands then it starts now the devil has most people trained to recognize the devil in other people's lives while not even recognizing the devil in their own mind but we have another adversary and that's us brother Brandon said that you are your greatest enemy so if you take between the devil and yourself you're the greatest enemy because brother random taught us that the devil can't do nothing unless he's got someone to work through and when you lend your mind over to the devil just like Eve lent her mind over to the most subtle Beast and the most subtle Beast lent his self over to the devil as soon as you lend yourself over to the devil's way of thinking you now have become your greatest enemy but if you keep the devil out of you be filled with the Holy Ghost burning on fire for God bubbling with the joy of the Lord the love of God just springing out of you man but you know the devil just looks at you as a 5 000 watt voltage and just or 25 000. you know what I'm trying to say he just wants to stay away from you because he's no match for God but the devil's a match for every one of us that's why we have to be filled with the Holy Ghost we have to be filled now look at here's what Jesus told us how to take care the over of the adversary and our life in Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and I'm I am like so close to closing here so you please bear with me Luke 9 verse 23 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me if you don't deny yourself in your situation the devil is going to get in there and he's going to cause you to think negatively that's true amen I mean I believe we should be hearing a lot more amens I I know this is not maybe I want to really feel good but I'm telling you it's the truth deny yourself daily Paul said I Die daily make it your personal habit um to make God your personal deliverer if you stay alive and I'm going to take care of this and I'm going to do this and I'm going to show them and I'm going to not shake their hand and I'm gonna how is God going to be your personal deliverer amen you can't you we got to call on God with the same the right spirit and God will see us through we gotta not lean to our own understanding it not be wise in our own eyes not just I'm gonna I'm gonna do it my way no deny yourself trust in the Lord believe in the power of prayer that when you pray it that prayer is set towards heaven and God will answer that prayer no matter how you feel no matter what it looks like no matter if it hasn't rained for 120 years no matter if the fire is seven times hotter no matter if the lions are growling in the in the in the den you just got to believe it's all about believing God will see us through let's Stand Together we are our greatest enemy for one reason we I always used to say and I believe this it's our nature right our first nature I'd like to say it like this I don't want to blame it just kind of takes the responsibility off my hands but my greatest sentence me is myself because I lend myself over to the devil and if I can control that that means the devil can't control me we need to understand that God is here to fill us with more of himself to be a personal deliverer in our lives with any situation that we have and I'll say it like this do not wait for God to come by and kind of give you a little Ray of Hope that it looks like it's almost over what I want you to do is believe that it's almost over and praise him for it thank him for it and when you start to feel this overwhelming power to try to subdue you into a depression call on God call on them and I want you to thank him for remembering you thank him for being your personal deliverer because that's what he come to be amen let's say I know the Lord will make a way for me [Music] I know the Lord Lord will make a way for me know the Lord will make a way for me [Music] if I live a holy light shun the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me one more time I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for me on the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me amen as she continues to play that softly if I could get you to Bow your your your head and your heart and just with every eye closed [Music] I wonder if there'd be someone here today said Brother John would you remember me in prayer because I want God to make a way for me just slip up your hand if anybody feels that way God bless these hands God sees you amen amen now he promised to do his part if we did our part and I'll tell you we can never Attain we can never attain to living a good enough life that merits his grace so we don't have to feel ever good enough all we have to do is say Lord I'm sorry for not doing my part and ah I'll confess my sins I confess my my my my shortcomings Lord and I pray that you'd come and make a way for me Lord I pray that you'd come and and fill me with the joy that I used to bubble out of me I used to wake up thinking about you Lord come and come and heal my body Lord make a way for me financially Lord come and help me restore relationship Lord I pray that you'd come and help us Lord Jesus oh let it be your prayer let it be your heart's desire and your faith as we go to him now in prayer Heavenly Father we come to you Lord with all of our hearts with all of our our needs and all of our requests which Lord you got every one of them under control you're not confused because we're all coming to you in prayer and and and and expressing our need of you Lord because you hear each one of our prayers Lord you know the very thoughts and the intents of a heart and Lord as we come to you today we're coming with Faith Lord knowing Lord that you are going to deliver us because we are your elect we are your Chosen and Lord we we have captured this morning what you want us to do when we leave here is to keep calling upon you to keep spending time in prayer and and and and and coming to you not so much uh begging but but Lord as you taught us in the word to knock to ask to seek and to praise you for the finished work that you're going to do it Lord because that is what your word declares that you'll do for us we thank you for these things Lord we thank you in advance and we give you the praise for every need being met Lord from that hand that's been raised today these hands that were raised today we love you and we honor you in Jesus Christ precious name amen amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord on my soul to the Lord amen I would not be denied I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole I would not be denied I as Jacob in the days of old I wrestled with the Lord and instant with a courage board I stood upon his word amen I would not May denied I would not be denied I tell Jesus came and made me whole I would not be denied oh Satan said my Lord was gone and would not hear my prayer he's a liar but praise the Lord the work is done and Christ the lord is he I would not they denied [Applause] till Jesus came and made me whole why would not be denied oh I would not be denied I would not Medina till Jesus came and made me whole oh I would not be denied amen let's thank the Lord let's thank the Lord for victory thank you Jesus hallelujah thank you for victory in my life Lord thank you for victory in my life thank you Lord Jesus amen and thank you for victory in the life for your of your people amen let's sing um victory victory no I was I'm thinking of all those I want to tell Satan to get behind me Vic yeah
