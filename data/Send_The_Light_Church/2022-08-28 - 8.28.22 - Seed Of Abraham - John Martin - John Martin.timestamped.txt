[37:14] honor for these things for we pray them
[37:16] in jesus name amen
[37:19] amen galatians chapter 3 verse number 16
[37:25] now to abraham and his seed were the
[37:28] promises made
[37:30] he saith not and to seeds
[37:33] as of many but as of one
[37:36] and to thy seed
[37:39] which is christ dropping down to verse
[37:41] 26
[37:43] for ye are all the children of god
[37:47] by faith in christ jesus
[37:50] for as many of you as have been baptized
[37:53] into christ have put on christ
[37:56] there is neither jew nor greek there is
[37:59] neither bond or free neither
[38:02] male nor female
[38:04] for ye are all one in christ jesus
[38:08] and if ye be christ
[38:12] then
[38:12] are ye abraham's seed
[38:15] and heirs according to the promise amen
[38:18] god bless you may be seated
[38:28] how many has ever heard things that i
[38:29] said that were
[38:33] didn't quite seem right
[38:39] how many is
[38:40] heard things that
[38:43] you just didn't understand
[38:58] we can't get away from that completely
[39:02] we can't
[39:04] but
[39:04] that shows us
[39:06] that we really need the lord
[39:19] one thing that i really really
[39:21] enjoyed about brother aaron for many
[39:24] years since the beginning
[39:26] i i told him that his experience
[39:29] he's gifted he's just he is gifted and
[39:32] but i told him as an experience as a
[39:34] lawyer you know you have to convince
[39:38] the others of what you're saying
[39:41] and he he knows how to lay it out
[39:45] and and it's just easier to follow
[39:48] um
[39:49] but everybody is not gifted in that
[39:51] realm
[39:53] moses was not gifted in that realm
[39:56] that he had an errand
[39:59] um
[40:00] peter was ignorant and unlearned
[40:05] paul was it was schooled
[40:07] but we know
[40:08] that uh well brother brandon he only had
[40:11] a seventh grade education
[40:14] and um
[40:15] it's just the way that god has ordained
[40:18] it it can't be perfect
[40:20] naturally but we can be in the spirit
[40:24] we can be connected to this
[40:27] to god who's using the vessel
[40:30] brother branham said this in questions
[40:31] and answers in 62 he says
[40:34] and i can say one
[40:36] thing
[40:38] and i'm so misunderstood or say it this
[40:41] way
[40:42] it's the way it's this way or that way
[40:45] one gets it
[40:46] way on this side
[40:48] and way it is you say that right
[40:51] straight towards the point one hears it
[40:53] this way and tells another and he leans
[40:55] a little further the next one leans a
[40:57] little further and then a little further
[41:00] and then it's got plumb out of
[41:02] cater
[41:05] all because of misunderstanding
[41:08] one hears it
[41:09] the other way
[41:10] he goes this way
[41:12] that way and then that way see
[41:15] you get away
[41:16] and that's the way it is in the meetings
[41:18] and so forth you really are driving it
[41:20] right to the spot now the elect
[41:25] would hear that spot
[41:28] they get that spot they know
[41:30] because
[41:31] because i said it
[41:33] exactly
[41:34] what i was meant
[41:36] like that that's just the message it's
[41:38] just exactly
[41:40] now that's
[41:42] what i say it seems like there's more
[41:44] misunderstanding all the time
[41:47] continually
[41:50] tell me we're not going to quite get
[41:51] away
[41:52] from
[41:54] well i wouldn't quite say it like that
[41:56] brother john a lot of times when we've
[41:57] had ministers come through there they
[41:59] have a point that they want to bring
[42:03] and it may not be balanced like i'd like
[42:05] to see it
[42:07] but they're bringing a point
[42:09] and you got to support the point
[42:12] you understand i'm saying you you just
[42:14] can't just throw it out because it ain't
[42:16] balanced the way you want it or it it's
[42:19] it's not said just the way you want
[42:22] um
[42:24] we've got to understand that god's got
[42:26] many different vessels and he uses them
[42:29] and just because it's not quite the way
[42:31] we see it um it doesn't mean it's it's
[42:33] not of the lord
[42:35] but this i will say because of the
[42:37] situation because there brother branham
[42:40] saying there's there's so many
[42:41] misunderstandings and more and more all
[42:43] the time and continually we need to be
[42:47] more ready to hear the word to be in the
[42:49] spirit when we come into church and and
[42:51] not just you know put it all on the
[42:54] natural right but to enter into the to
[42:56] the spirit amen
[42:58] amen well this morning we want to talk
[43:01] about the seed of abraham and for a
[43:03] subject
[43:04] the two seeds of abraham now brother
[43:06] branham again if you if you studied the
[43:09] message you see brother branham talked
[43:11] about uh two c's one was isaac
[43:14] and and uh one was um
[43:16] um was abraham i'm sorry there were two
[43:19] seeds one was isaac and one was ishmael
[43:22] another place he said one was
[43:24] isaac and one was was uh christ and in
[43:27] another place he said that that he had
[43:29] three seeds
[43:31] and so
[43:33] if you just take one of them and go to
[43:34] seed on it you can get in trouble but
[43:37] but but understanding the point that
[43:39] he's bringing so i want to talk about
[43:41] the two seeds the ones that we're aware
[43:43] of uh and that was ishmael and
[43:46] isaac
[43:48] can can you go with me for for just a
[43:50] moment okay brother brandon he starts
[43:52] off in this message uh abraham's grace
[43:56] covenant he said now our heavenly father
[43:58] we thank thee
[44:00] for every gracious word that's written
[44:02] in the bible
[44:03] it seemed that we're compassed about
[44:05] with such a a great cloud of witnesses
[44:08] two and a half million people died yet
[44:11] perishing in the wilderness of unbelief
[44:15] and only two that believed
[44:17] were permitted to go over
[44:20] he said father god i pray you to help us
[44:23] to see that
[44:24] and to look to what it means
[44:27] let us not be disbelievers in thy word
[44:30] but may we be not only hearers
[44:33] not only hearers but doers of the word
[44:37] granite amen so the the
[44:40] the message came that we could be doers
[44:43] of the word and learn
[44:45] and learn from the word amen
[44:48] now abraham had two sons isaac and in
[44:52] ishmael one son isaac he was
[44:55] supernaturally birthed by the spoken
[44:57] word of god the other son ishmael he was
[45:00] birthed by the natural will of man
[45:06] yet they were both seeds of abraham
[45:10] abraham really wanted ishmael who was
[45:12] born by his own will to be the son in
[45:15] which the spiritual promise would come
[45:18] we understand that even though god
[45:21] declined him
[45:24] that desire that that he would have when
[45:26] he spoke all that ishmael might live
[45:28] before thee god still promised to bless
[45:31] ishmael
[45:33] and in genesis 21 verse 17
[45:36] and god heard the voice of the lad and
[45:38] the angel of god called to hague or out
[45:41] of heaven and said unto her what aoeth
[45:44] hagar
[45:45] fear not
[45:46] for god have heard thy voice had heard
[45:49] the voice of the lad where he is
[45:52] so god hears our voice no matter where
[45:54] we're at
[45:57] and god sees our distresses and our
[45:59] pains and our hurts and his ears are
[46:01] open to the cries of his people
[46:05] god pours out his his mercy to them who
[46:07] are humble and of a broken contract
[46:10] spirit we can see here that both hagar
[46:12] and and ishmael they were they were
[46:14] broken and the angel of god said fear
[46:17] not
[46:18] use the words fear not the the same
[46:20] words that the angel said to mary fear
[46:22] not the same words that jesus said fear
[46:25] not little fly it's the father's good
[46:27] pleasure to give you the kingdom and
[46:29] it's encouraging to know that when we're
[46:31] suffering we're going through something
[46:33] that god is there saying fear not
[46:37] verse 18
[46:38] arise lift up the lad and hold him in
[46:40] thy hand for i will make him a great
[46:44] nation
[46:46] what a comfort that must have been
[46:50] in that moment
[46:51] of distress that there was a future
[46:55] and not just a an okay future but this
[46:58] was a he was going to make a great
[47:00] nation out of ishmael
[47:01] it was the promise of god yes it was the
[47:04] same promise that he told abraham here
[47:08] in genesis 17 verse 20
[47:11] and as for ishmael i have heard thee
[47:13] behold i will bless him and i will make
[47:15] him fruitful and multiply him
[47:17] exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[47:19] beget and i will make him a great
[47:23] i i'd just say that would be the
[47:26] the thing that every father and mother
[47:28] would want to hear about their their
[47:29] children something like that
[47:32] uh no doubt god
[47:33] has blessed ishmael blessed ishmael and
[47:36] his descendants
[47:37] but i'll say naturally
[47:41] great arab nations today that hold all
[47:43] the
[47:44] mo a lot of oil and diamonds and rubies
[47:47] and silk and just many many blessings
[47:49] have come out from ishmael
[47:54] the reason why is because god
[47:56] established as it were i'm just saying
[47:58] as it were
[47:59] like a covenant but it was a natural
[48:02] covenant
[48:04] he promised to bless them but they
[48:06] weren't spiritual blessings
[48:10] they were natural blessings
[48:13] this was not an everlasting covenant it
[48:16] was a temporal covenant
[48:18] established on natural things and it was
[48:20] the prosperity
[48:21] of this life this natural life
[48:24] behold i will bless him and make him
[48:26] fruitful multiplying because any twelve
[48:28] princes shall he be get and i will make
[48:30] him a great nation
[48:32] you could say just like jesus said the
[48:34] the the rain falls on the just and the
[48:36] unjust the blessings of god falls on on
[48:39] on the just and the unjust
[48:41] now he blessed ishmael in a mighty way
[48:45] and even though god's blessings uh even
[48:48] though god blessed abraham's natural
[48:50] seed
[48:52] god told
[48:53] abraham in genesis 17 20 21 but my
[48:57] covenant will i establish with isaac
[49:03] which
[49:03] sarah shall bear
[49:08] god made an unconditional covenant with
[49:11] abraham
[49:12] and it at times
[49:14] it just
[49:17] it was out of the scope out of the reach
[49:19] or out of the understanding
[49:22] of abraham at times because he just kept
[49:25] waiting nothing was happening he was
[49:26] getting older as he was waiting things
[49:29] were just getting harder getting further
[49:31] away his understanding was it was
[49:33] telling them that things are getting
[49:34] further away
[49:37] and it's hard for us believers when
[49:39] we're going through our tests and our
[49:41] trials how am i ever going to be like
[49:43] christ when it just seems to be getting
[49:45] harder and harder with the spirits in
[49:47] this age getting worse and worse but
[49:50] we've got to be believers we are the
[49:52] seed of abraham we are the believers
[49:55] just like abraham
[49:58] now abraham was chosen by god to bring
[50:00] forth this spiritual seed
[50:03] god foreknew isaac he was predestinated
[50:06] he was the elected by the sovereign will
[50:09] of god
[50:11] abraham never concocted it was it was it
[50:13] was god that told uh abraham what was
[50:16] going to happen it was an unconditional
[50:19] uh covenant with um with spiritual
[50:22] blessings god tells abraham in genesis
[50:25] 17 verse 19 i will establish my covenant
[50:28] with him for an ever lasting covenant
[50:32] and with his seed after him now he never
[50:34] said this about ishmael
[50:36] he never said this about the natural
[50:38] seed
[50:40] but i praise god he said it about
[50:43] abraham's spiritual seed which is us
[50:48] what do we have to fear
[50:50] amen
[50:51] we're believers of god there's nothing
[50:53] to fear
[50:55] if god's force who's going to be against
[50:57] us
[50:58] why should we be questioning our
[51:00] position in christ
[51:03] we we shouldn't let the devil push us
[51:05] around in our minds
[51:09] i mean
[51:11] we're a family
[51:13] we belong to christ
[51:15] and we protect and help our family does
[51:17] there anybody here that has a family
[51:20] member you just feel like i could care
[51:21] less about
[51:24] no
[51:26] and when you're the true seed of christ
[51:28] cares about the true seed of christ
[51:33] so who can separate us from christ
[51:37] we're just as much a part of this
[51:38] everlasting covenant as abraham and
[51:41] isaac were yes sir amen
[51:43] because we're the same seed
[51:45] and that seed is christ and it's through
[51:48] faith
[51:49] it's the seed of christ through faith
[51:52] now you might say brother john how do i
[51:54] know i'm really of that seed if i just
[51:57] if i just knew
[51:59] then you know i could just relax
[52:02] it's really simple
[52:04] you believe like abraham believed that's
[52:07] it
[52:08] right amen
[52:09] if you're looking for the evidence be a
[52:12] believer like he believed amen
[52:15] romans 4 verse 16 says therefore
[52:18] it is of faith that it might be by grace
[52:22] to the end
[52:23] the promise might be sure the promise
[52:27] might be sure
[52:28] to all the seed
[52:33] not to them only which are of the law
[52:35] but to them also which
[52:38] is of the faith of abraham who is the
[52:41] father of us all
[52:43] simply believe like abraham believed
[52:48] brother brandon said in the message
[52:49] jehovah jibril he says now we are
[52:51] abraham's seed if we are in christ
[52:56] and then if you are abraham's seed you
[52:58] have the same faith as abraham had
[53:02] so if you are in christ you have a
[53:04] supersede
[53:07] a
[53:08] a super to what abraham was because you
[53:11] come by the royal seed christ
[53:14] if you are dead in christ then you are
[53:16] abraham's children
[53:18] if you're dead in christ you're
[53:20] abraham's children and you have
[53:23] abraham's seed and abraham's faith and
[53:26] abraham's faith was in god's word
[53:28] regardless of what took place
[53:34] he called those things which were not as
[53:36] though they were because god says so
[53:38] what a promise we have
[53:41] face final resting places in the word
[53:43] and we just have to take god's word and
[53:46] just don't lean to our own understanding
[53:48] don't try to figure things out don't
[53:50] don't try to you know have it to be so
[53:52] perfect in here because the devil will
[53:54] confuse your mind
[53:58] he's the author of confusion you just
[54:01] got to take that word and believe it and
[54:03] let everything let the dominoes fall
[54:05] where they're going to fall
[54:11] now both of these seeds are holding on
[54:13] to the promises that god made their
[54:15] father abraham
[54:18] they want to be great they want to be
[54:20] fruitful they want to multiply they want
[54:22] god's blessings in their life
[54:25] both seeds believe in god
[54:27] both seeds believe that abraham is their
[54:29] father of their faith
[54:31] both seeds believe that god had made a
[54:33] covenant with them
[54:35] both seeds
[54:36] believe in serving and following the god
[54:39] of abraham can you say amen to these
[54:40] things
[54:42] now one seed is a spiritual seed
[54:45] and it was started by god
[54:48] through
[54:49] faith
[54:51] the other seed is a natural seed and it
[54:53] was started by man
[54:55] it was man's desire for god's promise
[54:59] but it was without total reliance on god
[55:03] there's the difference
[55:04] still wanting the promise of god
[55:07] but it wasn't a total reliance on god
[55:10] it was missing the substance of faith
[55:12] and we know that without faith it's
[55:14] impossible to please god so god wasn't
[55:16] pleased with that right
[55:19] we can be see we can we can see that
[55:21] there's there's similarities and there's
[55:23] differences here
[55:25] jesus speaking of our day he says the
[55:27] two spirits would be so close that
[55:31] if it were
[55:32] if it were possible the very elect would
[55:34] be deceived but we know the elect cannot
[55:37] be deceived because you can't deceive
[55:39] god
[55:41] and the elect are a part of god
[55:46] now we all got an opinion
[55:49] we all got opinion
[55:52] but i'll tell you it's
[55:54] it's not very easy
[55:56] to see who's seed and who's not
[56:01] should we even be thinking who is seed
[56:03] and who is not
[56:08] no we don't know
[56:09] we don't know
[56:12] we don't know
[56:16] but sometimes we think we know
[56:19] sometimes the devil tells us and gets
[56:22] our minds going in certain ways
[56:28] brother branham said that
[56:29] they're both religious they're both
[56:31] fundamental they both believe in worship
[56:33] and offerings and sacrifices
[56:35] look at genesis 21 verse 20 says god was
[56:39] with ishmael
[56:41] think about that god was with ishmael
[56:43] and he grew and he dwelt in the
[56:45] wilderness and he became an archer
[56:49] god promised him i'm going to bless him
[56:51] i'm going to make him a great nation
[56:52] he's going to have 12 princes god was
[56:54] with him
[56:57] and the believers are not careful they
[56:59] can focus too much on the natural
[57:03] in other words being content that god's
[57:05] with them
[57:06] and having these natural blessings being
[57:09] content with their their spiritual
[57:11] condition that there's really not a need
[57:14] to press towards the mark for anything
[57:16] more
[57:17] no need to labor to enter in to the rest
[57:20] of god's nature
[57:22] now i'll tell you this is not nothing
[57:24] that we would verbally say this is not
[57:26] like anything that we'd verbally talk
[57:28] about
[57:29] but these are thoughts that the devil
[57:31] puts in her head and that's what causes
[57:34] lukewarm laodicea to become so strong in
[57:37] our nature
[57:40] come on amen
[57:44] now god was with ishmael and his
[57:46] children and he blessed them
[57:49] god was with the children of israel for
[57:51] 45 years and he blessed them
[57:56] we know their shoes didn't wear out that
[57:57] god just met their needs physically
[58:03] but it seemed that they were content
[58:04] living outside of the promised land
[58:09] just how far can god
[58:12] bless
[58:14] the natural seed of abraham how just how
[58:16] far can the blessings of god go to the
[58:19] natural seed of abraham
[58:22] they can never be heir with the
[58:23] spiritual seed
[58:28] galatians chapter 4 verse 22
[58:32] is this i just want to know is this seen
[58:34] what i've said this so far does this
[58:36] seem
[58:37] to is it is it easy to understand what
[58:39] i'm saying
[58:40] okay
[58:42] for it is written that abraham had two
[58:44] sons the one by a bondwoman the other by
[58:46] a free woman
[58:48] but he was born of the bondwoman
[58:50] uh was born after the flesh
[58:53] but he that was of the free woman was
[58:55] born by promise
[58:58] i'm sorry yeah okay verse 30 you're with
[59:01] me
[59:02] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[59:03] cast out the bondwoman and her son for
[59:06] the son of the bondwoman should not be
[59:08] heir
[59:09] with the son of the free woman so we see
[59:11] here
[59:12] that there was a separation
[59:15] the blessings only go so far with
[59:17] ishmael
[59:18] right
[59:19] but but with isaac they go into eternity
[59:23] they're eternal blessings
[59:25] we're talking about nature
[59:29] a nature change
[59:32] ishmael there there's nothing in there
[59:34] about nature change it was just the
[59:36] blessings of god
[59:40] the blessings to the natural seed of
[59:43] abraham they're limited but the
[59:45] blessings to the spiritual seed of
[59:47] abraham they are limitless
[59:55] now
[59:56] it doesn't mean i like this testimony
[59:59] that we heard of uh brother mark this
[1:00:03] morning about healing
[1:00:05] uh
[1:00:06] the scripture tells us a wonderful
[1:00:09] testimony don't
[1:00:10] forget this thought
[1:00:12] here brother branham said that
[1:00:15] every redemptive we have claims to every
[1:00:18] redemptive promise
[1:00:19] he paid for it
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:27] naturally we all
[1:00:29] want to be perfectly well ex
[1:00:31] especially those of us that battle some
[1:00:34] sort of horrible sickness
[1:00:39] and god paid for that healing
[1:00:43] i want you to think about these problems
[1:00:44] surely he bore our griefs and carried
[1:00:47] our sorrows
[1:00:49] he was wounded for a transgression
[1:00:50] bruised for iniquities chastisement our
[1:00:52] peace was upon and with his stripes we
[1:00:54] are healed now that healing can be
[1:00:56] natural or spiritual
[1:01:05] but if we don't take if a man doesn't
[1:01:07] take advantage
[1:01:10] of a nature change
[1:01:13] what good would it do to be forgiven
[1:01:16] of your past
[1:01:18] when your future
[1:01:20] continues to be what your past was
[1:01:25] so the spiritual promise
[1:01:27] is for a nature change
[1:01:31] it is nothing to do
[1:01:33] with ishmael's promise
[1:01:38] but we get
[1:01:40] natural blessings and spiritual
[1:01:42] blessings if you think about it abraham
[1:01:44] was he was blessed right
[1:01:47] he was blessed naturally
[1:01:49] but he was blessed spiritually
[1:01:52] where ishmael you might not appoint yeah
[1:01:54] he's blessed naturally
[1:01:55] but he wasn't blessed spiritually
[1:01:59] in fact abraham had to separate
[1:02:01] kept kept having to separate separate
[1:02:03] from la separate well lot didn't
[1:02:06] man i'll tell you as long as lot stayed
[1:02:08] with abraham he was better off
[1:02:11] as long as lot stayed with abraham he
[1:02:13] was spiritually better off
[1:02:15] but soon as he separated from that he
[1:02:18] began to pitch his tent towards the
[1:02:20] world
[1:02:25] i'm not saying that
[1:02:27] he didn't grow naturally in blessings he
[1:02:29] became the mayor
[1:02:32] right
[1:02:33] but spiritually it
[1:02:35] his righteous soul was vexed daily
[1:02:40] now both seeds were promised blessings
[1:02:44] yet there was a separation between the
[1:02:46] two
[1:02:47] one
[1:02:48] the blessings were tied now catch this
[1:02:51] to this natural life
[1:02:54] the other one the blessings were
[1:02:55] connected to a spiritual life in other
[1:02:57] words they were heirs with god
[1:03:02] heirs with god
[1:03:04] and this is what i love about this
[1:03:07] is because i can't have the nature of
[1:03:09] jesus christ
[1:03:10] i can have greater is he that's in me
[1:03:13] than he that's in the world i can have
[1:03:15] the overcomer living inside of me where
[1:03:18] i can fear nothing out there
[1:03:24] god never said i am the god of abraham
[1:03:27] ishmael and his twelve sons
[1:03:31] he said i am the god of abraham isaac
[1:03:34] and jacob he bore witness of whose heirs
[1:03:37] were who he was connected to
[1:03:41] oh
[1:03:43] that's what i want today for me
[1:03:46] you know when they came out of egypt
[1:03:47] they were a mixed multitude
[1:03:50] but when they went into the promised
[1:03:52] land it was only the elect
[1:03:56] god bore witness to his heirs joshua and
[1:03:59] caleb
[1:04:00] numbers 14 24 says but my servant caleb
[1:04:03] because he had another spirit with him
[1:04:05] and have followed me fully
[1:04:07] him will i bring into the land wherein
[1:04:09] he went and his seed shall possess it
[1:04:13] so here it was god was making a
[1:04:15] separation they were both his children
[1:04:18] he called both of them his children
[1:04:21] but he made a separation and it was
[1:04:24] because
[1:04:25] those that followed him holy they got
[1:04:27] the promise those that followed him
[1:04:30] partially
[1:04:31] didn't get all the
[1:04:33] the spiritual promise
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:37] i hope you
[1:04:38] can see yourself
[1:04:41] in the scriptures
[1:04:46] i want
[1:04:47] to be identified
[1:04:49] with god's spiritual promises amen
[1:04:54] now our promised land is the nature of
[1:04:56] christ living
[1:04:57] inside of each and every one of us
[1:05:00] it's the promised land that that
[1:05:04] god
[1:05:06] lives inside he's completely got control
[1:05:08] now here's the thing none of us can say
[1:05:10] i'm a i'm a perfect
[1:05:13] illustration of jesus christ but
[1:05:15] but here's the thing
[1:05:17] as the seed of abraham that should be
[1:05:19] our goal that should be our focus that's
[1:05:22] what we should be looking to it should
[1:05:24] mean a lot to us that's why we come to
[1:05:26] church find out where we're at in that
[1:05:27] aspect
[1:05:29] because we're after that
[1:05:31] we're not after just the natural
[1:05:34] blessings
[1:05:36] and and not much of a focus on that
[1:05:38] nature change
[1:05:40] see too much satan has got so many
[1:05:43] people just oh you know you've got the
[1:05:45] holy ghost you're saved you're in now
[1:05:47] just build your natural life
[1:05:52] it's a trick
[1:05:55] i will not be satisfied until i awake in
[1:05:58] his
[1:05:59] his lightness his nature until he can
[1:06:02] handle things the way he handles them
[1:06:05] until i can overcome like he overcome
[1:06:08] like i can
[1:06:10] and and and become
[1:06:13] love joy peace long-suffering gentle
[1:06:17] because that is the air
[1:06:19] that's the the spiritual
[1:06:22] uh
[1:06:22] promise the the the the heir of of
[1:06:26] abraham's seed it's it's christ well
[1:06:29] what is christ christ in you the the
[1:06:31] hope of glory it is the the nature
[1:06:34] change where where people look at you
[1:06:36] and you're no longer seen you're seen as
[1:06:39] miss jesus that's christ in you the hope
[1:06:42] of glory
[1:06:48] romans 8 chapter 15 15.
[1:06:51] uh
[1:06:52] romans 8 chapter 15. that doesn't make
[1:06:54] sense romans chapter 8 verse 15
[1:06:59] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:07:01] bondage again to fear
[1:07:06] but you have received the spirit of
[1:07:07] adoption
[1:07:10] whereby
[1:07:12] your your
[1:07:13] something is happening inside
[1:07:16] now when you
[1:07:17] we've had our grandchildren over we had
[1:07:20] this week a number of
[1:07:22] grandchildren we had over and two of
[1:07:24] them were babies and they cried
[1:07:28] and i'll tell you there is a
[1:07:29] when there is a crying baby
[1:07:32] um
[1:07:34] they want something
[1:07:37] strongly
[1:07:39] they don't know quite how to go after it
[1:07:43] but like any baby that's wanting
[1:07:44] something
[1:07:45] they get cry they cry and then they get
[1:07:47] the attention
[1:07:50] and that's what we have to do
[1:07:53] we have to cry abba father but what what
[1:07:55] are we wanting
[1:07:58] what are we wanting
[1:08:00] are we wanting these natural
[1:08:03] things
[1:08:04] are we focusing on the nature change
[1:08:08] see the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:08:10] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:08:14] of god
[1:08:16] spiritually speaking now
[1:08:19] something inside
[1:08:21] the spirit
[1:08:23] inside that lives in us is bearing
[1:08:26] witness that we're connected to the to
[1:08:29] the spiritual promises of god
[1:08:35] there's a yearning
[1:08:37] to be in the image of god there's
[1:08:38] something crying out oh that it might be
[1:08:41] like jesus
[1:08:43] you know we do a situation and we we
[1:08:45] stumble we fall we say things we
[1:08:47] shouldn't we do things we shouldn't and
[1:08:50] we just kind of like kick it like that
[1:08:51] and keep walking but something inside
[1:08:54] the spiritual seed of god says i want to
[1:08:57] be a just like jesus i want to better
[1:08:59] handle that situation just like jesus
[1:09:02] and it's a constant crying it's a
[1:09:04] constant journey it's a it's a deep
[1:09:07] calling to the deep that their eyes are
[1:09:09] fixed on the spiritual promise we are
[1:09:11] the seed of god we are the of the faith
[1:09:14] of abraham and our focus is on the
[1:09:16] spiritual not the natural
[1:09:24] and if children verse 17 then were heirs
[1:09:29] heirs of god joiners with christ
[1:09:32] if so be that we if so be that we suffer
[1:09:36] with him
[1:09:37] that we may be also glorified together
[1:09:40] now why in the world
[1:09:43] would they just drop this little thing
[1:09:45] about suffering in here when we're
[1:09:47] having such a good time talking about
[1:09:49] being joint heirs with jesus christ
[1:09:53] because what it takes
[1:09:57] if we don't mortify the deeds of the
[1:09:59] flesh if we don't not willing to die out
[1:10:01] deny our will how can we become in the
[1:10:04] nature of jesus christ
[1:10:10] for i reckon
[1:10:12] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:10:16] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:10:18] glory that shall be revealed in us that
[1:10:22] we will be able to see christ manifested
[1:10:26] in the flesh once again
[1:10:28] that's the glory that shall be revealed
[1:10:31] in us
[1:10:33] not to us
[1:10:35] in us
[1:10:38] in what you know it's what we live
[1:10:41] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:10:43] creature or the creation it's waiting
[1:10:47] for this manifestation to take place
[1:10:51] waiting
[1:10:52] no wonder
[1:10:54] we the seed of abraham are crying out
[1:10:57] i'm a father
[1:10:59] fill me with your spirit
[1:11:02] we're not lost in laodicea content with
[1:11:06] what we have spiritually and then just
[1:11:08] trying to build our lives naturally
[1:11:10] we're not of that natural seed we have
[1:11:12] the spiritual seed of christ
[1:11:16] it's recognizing your position
[1:11:21] the natural seed focus on natural
[1:11:23] blessings
[1:11:25] the spiritual seed focus on spiritual
[1:11:27] blessings the spiritual blessings of the
[1:11:30] nature change
[1:11:31] we are changed from glory unto glory
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:35] we're looking to our desires to be more
[1:11:39] look like our heavenly father
[1:11:42] you know
[1:11:43] satan has really tricked a lot of people
[1:11:46] into thinking that somehow that just
[1:11:48] happens on rapture mourning
[1:12:03] we all want to be changed
[1:12:09] and the more that we're willing
[1:12:12] to deny this flesh who always wants to
[1:12:15] be king
[1:12:17] in la in our life
[1:12:20] the more we're going to die out to that
[1:12:22] ishmael
[1:12:24] nature
[1:12:26] that we were born with right we were
[1:12:28] born
[1:12:29] uh we're shaping in iniquity
[1:12:33] the more we can die out to that thing
[1:12:36] crucify it the more god has liberty
[1:12:41] and the more we'll just be like him i
[1:12:43] mean
[1:12:45] yes one day we're going to wake up
[1:12:48] and we're going to be in heaven
[1:12:51] it's going to happen we're going to be
[1:12:53] we're going to go on a rapture we're
[1:12:55] going to be in heaven we're going to be
[1:12:56] like christ but isn't it exciting to the
[1:12:58] believer who just wants to wake up and
[1:13:00] be a little bit more like him that day
[1:13:03] isn't there just something that's just
[1:13:05] not satisfied there's a yearning and a
[1:13:08] calling to me that's the spiritual seed
[1:13:11] it's looking for that promise now i'm
[1:13:14] thankful for all the victories that
[1:13:16] christ has given me in my life but i'm
[1:13:18] by far not satisfied
[1:13:22] because my flesh has gotten in the way
[1:13:23] too many times
[1:13:28] so it's a battle
[1:13:31] but branham said
[1:13:32] in in the message a greater than solomon
[1:13:34] is here he said and jesus said a sower
[1:13:36] went forth and he sold
[1:13:38] seeds and some
[1:13:41] sold good seeds
[1:13:43] and and and an evil
[1:13:45] man sold tares
[1:13:48] and the husbandman which is
[1:13:50] the pastor
[1:13:52] said
[1:13:53] shall we pull out the tares
[1:13:58] and he said
[1:14:00] well if the pastor said it's probably in
[1:14:02] the church right
[1:14:03] and he said you'll up
[1:14:06] the wheat with it he said let them grow
[1:14:10] together
[1:14:14] let them grow together
[1:14:16] so there's no separating church natural
[1:14:19] and church spiritual
[1:14:21] but the church spiritual is the elected
[1:14:24] church it's the called out it's the set
[1:14:26] aside by god alone and they are the ones
[1:14:29] that will hear
[1:14:31] the word
[1:14:32] of the lord
[1:14:37] there's nothing we don't have scripture
[1:14:40] to
[1:14:41] make decisions
[1:14:42] who is and who isn't and to take out and
[1:14:45] to pull in
[1:14:49] brother branham says you there's no way
[1:14:51] of separating the church natural and the
[1:14:53] church spiritual
[1:14:56] not our job
[1:14:58] but god distincts the difference
[1:15:02] god distincts the difference
[1:15:05] romans 9 verse 6
[1:15:08] not as though the word of god have taken
[1:15:10] none effect
[1:15:12] for they are not all israel which are
[1:15:15] of israel
[1:15:18] what does that mean not all jews are
[1:15:20] jews
[1:15:21] not all christians are christians not
[1:15:23] all believers are believers
[1:15:24] not they are not all of israel which are
[1:15:28] of
[1:15:29] israel
[1:15:30] neither because they are the seed of
[1:15:32] abraham are they all
[1:15:35] children
[1:15:36] but in isaac
[1:15:38] shall thy seed be called
[1:15:42] that is they which are the children of
[1:15:44] the flesh
[1:15:46] they are not
[1:15:48] the children
[1:15:49] of god amen now that's a strong
[1:15:53] scripture
[1:15:54] it's a strong word
[1:15:56] that didn't come from brother john
[1:15:58] that's just the word amen
[1:16:01] they that are the children of the flesh
[1:16:02] they are not the children of god but the
[1:16:05] children of the promise
[1:16:07] are counted for the seed
[1:16:11] that's why we must be born again
[1:16:14] it's why we must rot out to this a this
[1:16:17] nature that that that doesn't want to go
[1:16:20] through
[1:16:24] we've got to be born of the will of god
[1:16:27] we've got to take on the seed of god
[1:16:29] by faith that believes that i will
[1:16:32] become like christ
[1:16:36] john said he came to his own his own
[1:16:38] received him not but as many as received
[1:16:40] him to them gave he power
[1:16:42] hallelujah power to become a son of god
[1:16:46] even to them that believe on his name
[1:16:48] you know what it's like when you you
[1:16:50] meet somebody's son that you haven't
[1:16:52] seen for a while or somebody's daughter
[1:16:54] that you haven't seen for a while or or
[1:16:56] a baby
[1:16:58] and the first thing you're doing is
[1:16:59] you're trying to look to see if there's
[1:17:01] some resemblance
[1:17:03] you're looking for a resemblance
[1:17:06] look like mom or dad
[1:17:11] i mean if we're a son and daughter of
[1:17:13] god there's a looking for some
[1:17:14] resemblance
[1:17:16] we're looking for some resemblance
[1:17:19] but it's see it's in character
[1:17:25] and they're going to come with sign
[1:17:27] lines and wonder signs and wonders and
[1:17:30] but there but
[1:17:32] there's
[1:17:37] if you focus
[1:17:40] on a complete new birth
[1:17:43] if you let that be your focus you're
[1:17:45] focusing on the right thing
[1:17:50] i'm glad
[1:17:52] that god has started
[1:17:55] the new birth in me
[1:17:57] and i can say by faith i'm born again
[1:18:02] but i also also have to say i'm not
[1:18:04] completely in his image i don't
[1:18:07] completely look like him
[1:18:09] but i am pressing towards that mark for
[1:18:11] the prize of the high callings
[1:18:14] and it's it's it's what i believe the
[1:18:17] spiritual seed is focused on
[1:18:25] jesus said you must be born again
[1:18:29] the natural seed of abraham
[1:18:32] cannot be heirs with the spiritual seed
[1:18:35] that's why our first birth
[1:18:38] can enter in
[1:18:40] it's basically an ishmael birth we were
[1:18:42] all born by the will of man
[1:18:45] just like ishmael was
[1:18:47] that's why we have to be born again be
[1:18:49] born by the promise of god by the
[1:18:52] spiritual promise of god by faith
[1:18:55] that's how it happens it doesn't well
[1:18:57] when i begin to see jesus a little bit
[1:19:00] more inside of me then i'll have
[1:19:02] confidence no
[1:19:03] no no no you believe it before it
[1:19:06] happens just like abraham because you're
[1:19:09] the seed of abraham
[1:19:11] god is god is looking for his seed to be
[1:19:14] like him we're we're being called back
[1:19:16] to the image of christ amen
[1:19:21] now we
[1:19:22] the seed
[1:19:24] the spiritual seed
[1:19:26] are longing for spiritual blessings
[1:19:30] and the spiritual blessings
[1:19:32] that i'm talking about is a nature
[1:19:35] change
[1:19:36] i mean i'm i i love
[1:19:39] when god's presence comes sometimes
[1:19:41] you're just you're in prayer sometimes
[1:19:43] you're listening to some song sometimes
[1:19:45] you hear a test something happens to you
[1:19:47] and a blessing just falls on you it's
[1:19:49] his presence
[1:19:51] and it's it's just wonderful and and and
[1:19:54] honestly nothing can compare with god's
[1:19:57] presence
[1:20:01] but i if i understand the scriptures
[1:20:04] that same blessing can fall on the just
[1:20:06] and the unjust
[1:20:10] brother i've talked about the tares say
[1:20:12] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:20:14] but see something that
[1:20:17] gives you victory
[1:20:20] it's your walk
[1:20:22] it's what happens on a regular basis
[1:20:25] it's how you handle the devil
[1:20:30] it's how you handle the devil
[1:20:32] when he comes to your mind he tries
[1:20:35] getting in your home he tries getting
[1:20:37] into your church he tries getting into
[1:20:39] your workplace it's how you handle the
[1:20:41] devil
[1:20:47] i'd rather have that
[1:20:53] i'd rather have that than all the
[1:20:55] blessings have fallen on this natural
[1:20:57] guy
[1:21:05] because
[1:21:06] i need god on on the inside of me i need
[1:21:10] him on the inside
[1:21:12] because when you're facing
[1:21:14] a demon
[1:21:16] when you're facing you know like brother
[1:21:17] brandon says when you get off that plane
[1:21:19] you got to have thus saith the lord
[1:21:21] you you
[1:21:23] you you are facing demons that are
[1:21:25] attacking
[1:21:29] and he's after this message and he's
[1:21:32] after the the ministry and i just want
[1:21:33] to say
[1:21:34] i thank each and every one of you that
[1:21:36] have
[1:21:37] a burden to pray for the minister here
[1:21:40] now say with the ministry
[1:21:42] the family
[1:21:44] because
[1:21:45] um it's one thing to say
[1:21:48] it's one thing to say oh lord just bless
[1:21:50] the ministry there you know bless
[1:21:51] brother john in the ministry there and
[1:21:53] it's another thing to know that there's
[1:21:55] so many
[1:21:56] uh
[1:21:57] guns pointed
[1:21:59] at them
[1:22:01] and to be able to enter in to a uh it's
[1:22:04] one thing to say oh moses he needs his
[1:22:06] hands lifted up
[1:22:09] somebody needs to help him
[1:22:11] but it's another thing to go over there
[1:22:12] and actually help his hands stay up
[1:22:16] it's it's it's a greater effort
[1:22:18] it's easy to say well the pastor needs
[1:22:20] this and the pastor needs that
[1:22:24] and he does oh boy this past this pastor
[1:22:27] i know this pastor
[1:22:29] this i can testify this pastor needs
[1:22:32] help
[1:22:34] needs help
[1:22:35] needs prayer
[1:22:38] every time i i've never come up to the
[1:22:41] pulpit in my life ever feeling
[1:22:44] worthy
[1:22:46] to be here
[1:22:47] ever there hasn't been a time
[1:22:51] had a dollar for every thought that i
[1:22:52] had i would just love to sit down
[1:22:55] and support
[1:22:59] i i'm i honestly i feel like i'm such a
[1:23:02] good supporter
[1:23:04] such a good servant
[1:23:07] but this leadership role
[1:23:10] you just can't seem
[1:23:13] to
[1:23:14] appease everybody
[1:23:16] you know what i'm trying to say here
[1:23:19] and uh
[1:23:20] so i appreciate your prayers and i want
[1:23:22] to say is at this moment thank you for
[1:23:24] for your long suffering with me thank
[1:23:25] you for bearing with me
[1:23:27] thank you for for believing in the word
[1:23:30] above me
[1:23:38] but we're looking for the spiritual
[1:23:40] blessings we're wanting to move forward
[1:23:42] in the new birth
[1:23:44] not unborn again but move forward in it
[1:23:46] move forward into this which says he
[1:23:48] that hit which had begun a good work in
[1:23:51] you shall perform it okay the the new
[1:23:53] birth started but let's continue in it
[1:23:56] amen till old things are passed away and
[1:23:58] all things become new and all things are
[1:24:02] of god
[1:24:04] now that's the spiritual seed
[1:24:07] of abraham
[1:24:09] first peter chapter 1 verse 22
[1:24:12] senior purified your souls
[1:24:16] in obeying the truth
[1:24:18] through the spirit
[1:24:21] unto unfeigned
[1:24:24] love
[1:24:25] of the brethren
[1:24:27] my
[1:24:28] see that you love one another
[1:24:31] with a pure
[1:24:34] heart
[1:24:36] once in a while
[1:24:39] fervently
[1:24:41] being born again not of the corruptible
[1:24:44] seed
[1:24:45] but
[1:24:46] of incorruptable
[1:24:48] by the word of god which liveth and
[1:24:51] abideth
[1:24:52] forever amen
[1:24:55] i'm looking for that jesus christ the
[1:24:56] same yesterday and forever inside of me
[1:25:03] now the spiritual seed is looking for
[1:25:05] spiritual blessings of the nature change
[1:25:09] first john chapter 3 verse 2 beloved now
[1:25:12] are we the sons of god and it does not
[1:25:14] yet appear but we know that when he show
[1:25:16] up here we're going to be just like him
[1:25:18] we're going to see him as he is and
[1:25:21] every man that has this hope
[1:25:24] in him
[1:25:26] what does he do
[1:25:30] wow he purifies himself he actually is
[1:25:33] doing something all because of this he
[1:25:36] has a hope
[1:25:37] to
[1:25:38] to manifest christ inside of them
[1:25:44] it's not that we're not pure
[1:25:48] we are pure
[1:25:50] but we want to be pure
[1:25:53] it's it's not that we're not like christ
[1:25:55] we just want to be more like christ
[1:25:59] this is how sometimes our ministry can
[1:26:01] be
[1:26:06] misunderstood the spiritual seed is
[1:26:09] purifying their souls in obeying the
[1:26:12] truth
[1:26:15] it's through faith
[1:26:17] it's not through
[1:26:19] ability
[1:26:20] it's not through i know i'm something
[1:26:23] no we know we're nothing
[1:26:25] we we we need god's grace
[1:26:27] so i'm just gonna i'm gonna believe god
[1:26:30] i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:26:32] purify my my myself i'm gonna i'm i'm
[1:26:35] gonna obey the word that i heard
[1:26:38] at church i'm gonna go home and i'm
[1:26:41] gonna
[1:26:42] spend time in prayer praying that god
[1:26:45] would move
[1:26:46] anything out of the way that's keeping
[1:26:49] me from fulfilling the word of god for
[1:26:51] my life it's that simple it's it's your
[1:26:54] relationship with god that you're
[1:26:57] getting down to business
[1:27:01] now the natural seed is looking for
[1:27:03] natural blessings
[1:27:05] without the nature change
[1:27:10] they're not they're not focusing
[1:27:13] on the nature change
[1:27:15] they're
[1:27:16] they're not focused on it their main
[1:27:18] focus is just on natural blessings
[1:27:22] the blessings of the family
[1:27:25] i mean ishmael's family was blessed
[1:27:29] god promised me 12 princes we're going
[1:27:31] to have 12 nations
[1:27:34] focus
[1:27:38] not worrying about
[1:27:40] the character in the home
[1:27:43] not worrying about any
[1:27:46] are we praying
[1:27:48] like we should
[1:27:50] are we
[1:27:50] are we talking about other people in our
[1:27:53] homes
[1:27:55] come on
[1:27:56] now now here's the thing
[1:28:00] it's got to change sometimes
[1:28:03] this the seed the spiritual seed
[1:28:11] there are so many i i can take any one i
[1:28:14] can take any person here
[1:28:16] and i can
[1:28:17] talk to you
[1:28:19] and talk to anybody about you
[1:28:22] except a couple of these little guys
[1:28:24] jonathan i don't know much about you and
[1:28:26] but
[1:28:28] but for the most part i know enough
[1:28:30] about you that i can say some negative
[1:28:32] things about you
[1:28:36] right
[1:28:37] but what good would that do
[1:28:39] what
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:41] but good
[1:28:45] and we could we all could do that we all
[1:28:47] could do that because we we see one
[1:28:49] another we know one another's faults
[1:28:53] and at the end of the conversation that
[1:28:55] we spoke the truth
[1:28:56] what good would it do
[1:28:58] what is it edified
[1:29:00] what is it helped
[1:29:03] i'm not going to better preach
[1:29:04] everything anyway so i'm also just
[1:29:06] saying what i want to say satan is the
[1:29:08] accuser of the brethren
[1:29:12] and i i mean the scripture to the
[1:29:15] spiritual seed you know
[1:29:18] where's we're supposed to put that stuff
[1:29:19] away
[1:29:21] the scripture says put it away
[1:29:23] just put it away i know it's bothering
[1:29:25] you i know it's true put it away if you
[1:29:28] are really bothered about somebody or
[1:29:29] something this is what you do
[1:29:32] you get down on your knees and you pray
[1:29:34] until god
[1:29:36] shows you how to help
[1:29:40] how to help
[1:29:41] and don't limit yourself to i can't help
[1:29:45] don't do that
[1:29:47] you're not you know you may be limited
[1:29:49] but god ain't limited all you're doing
[1:29:52] is testifying of how much god's in you
[1:29:55] and if that's how you feel then you need
[1:29:57] to stay there until you get more of
[1:29:59] jesus inside of you because somewhere
[1:30:02] down the line even if you're not to go
[1:30:05] to them
[1:30:07] god will use your faith in prayer to
[1:30:10] take care of the situation
[1:30:14] because you're of the seed of abraham
[1:30:16] you're the faith of abraham
[1:30:19] we're just following in our father's
[1:30:21] footsteps
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:23] but where it's not it's not a uh some
[1:30:27] you know god didn't give us
[1:30:29] something private faith for just us
[1:30:34] if he did then we wouldn't be associated
[1:30:36] with a spiritual family with spiritual
[1:30:39] needs
[1:30:41] we we if god shows you something in the
[1:30:44] body
[1:30:45] let god use you to help that need
[1:30:50] yes
[1:30:51] i'm telling you you
[1:30:53] let me just say this in your own
[1:30:55] personal family
[1:30:56] if there was a problem
[1:31:01] did did the arguing and fighting ever
[1:31:03] work
[1:31:05] no
[1:31:06] did proving who was right who was wrong
[1:31:08] did that ever work
[1:31:09] did you ever feel good even when you won
[1:31:11] the argument
[1:31:13] oh
[1:31:14] even when there's a problem in the home
[1:31:16] you you come together and you pray
[1:31:18] and even though
[1:31:20] there may have not been a a swift
[1:31:22] confession at that moment
[1:31:24] god began to start something
[1:31:27] he began to work on this situation
[1:31:31] because god honors when we humble
[1:31:32] ourselves and say god you know we can't
[1:31:34] handle this i know we need you
[1:31:38] and all you're doing is manifesting
[1:31:40] christ
[1:31:41] you're manifesting christ
[1:31:44] i love this word amen
[1:31:49] now time is up
[1:31:51] and i won't keep you
[1:31:53] i won't keep you another hour
[1:31:57] can i give you some scripture street
[1:32:00] all right
[1:32:04] oh my my there's so much here
[1:32:07] well let me ask you this question
[1:32:10] well now that's the see this is the
[1:32:13] situation sometimes when you're
[1:32:15] preaching you're just
[1:32:17] you you have too much i'm going to give
[1:32:19] you the scriptures
[1:32:21] john 8
[1:32:24] 33 through 44. now here in these
[1:32:27] scriptures jesus begins to deal with the
[1:32:30] natural seed and the spiritual seed
[1:32:34] can we at least do this one
[1:32:36] can we at least do this one
[1:32:38] okay the rest of the scriptures
[1:32:39] galatians 4 28-31
[1:32:43] galatians 5 16-26
[1:32:48] luke
[1:32:48] 13 10
[1:32:50] through 17. now what i'll tell you about
[1:32:53] this i remember i told you that god
[1:32:54] always bears witness of his of his heirs
[1:32:58] that's what luke 13 10 is and then
[1:33:01] john
[1:33:03] um
[1:33:06] 8 31 31-37
[1:33:10] say it again
[1:33:12] the galatians yes galatians 5 16-26
[1:33:17] luke 19 1
[1:33:19] through 10.
[1:33:24] what you're going to see here when you
[1:33:25] read these scriptures is that there's
[1:33:27] the uh natural seed the spiritual seed
[1:33:31] you're going to see that god identifies
[1:33:33] himself
[1:33:35] with the seat of abraham
[1:33:38] he calls a woman she's a daughter of
[1:33:39] abraham calls uh uh
[1:33:42] zacharias he did all these bad things
[1:33:44] taking advantage of people and then he
[1:33:47] says
[1:33:48] jesus said he's the son of abraham and
[1:33:50] he be he changes he changes he he wants
[1:33:52] to
[1:33:53] give back fourfold everything he took of
[1:33:55] anybody and his his nature began to
[1:33:58] change because he was the seed of
[1:34:00] abraham
[1:34:05] and the reason i want to go through john
[1:34:07] chapter 8 if i could and just take a few
[1:34:09] minutes on here because this this can be
[1:34:12] kind of difficult to catch it
[1:34:14] but starting here with verse 33 they
[1:34:16] answered him
[1:34:19] we be abraham's seed and we're never in
[1:34:22] bondage to any man how sayest thou ye
[1:34:25] shall be made free
[1:34:27] verse 36 if the son shall make you free
[1:34:31] then you should be free indeed now
[1:34:32] that's what i want
[1:34:34] i don't want to be controlled by some
[1:34:35] overpowering hate
[1:34:38] some overpowering jealousy some
[1:34:40] overpowering
[1:34:42] uh anger some overpowering frustration i
[1:34:45] want to be set free
[1:34:47] the thing is i need the i am a present
[1:34:50] help in a time of trouble with me
[1:34:53] not a god of the past not a god of the
[1:34:55] future but the i am with me
[1:35:00] know that ye are abraham's seed so hear
[1:35:01] jesus come out and he confesses i know
[1:35:04] that you're abraham's seed but you seek
[1:35:06] to kill me
[1:35:08] because my word have no place in you
[1:35:10] he's acknowledging their abraham seed
[1:35:17] but the fact that he's saying that you
[1:35:18] seek to kill me now he's starting to
[1:35:20] show that there's two there's two
[1:35:22] different seeds here
[1:35:24] there's two different seeds of abraham
[1:35:27] i speak that which i seen with my father
[1:35:30] and you do that which you see with your
[1:35:32] father
[1:35:34] you can be of the natural seed of
[1:35:37] abraham
[1:35:39] and be of the spiritual seed
[1:35:42] of
[1:35:43] satan
[1:35:47] religious you know and brother bran
[1:35:49] teaches us in the message
[1:35:56] verse 39
[1:35:59] um
[1:36:01] they answered and said unto him abraham
[1:36:03] is our father
[1:36:05] jesus saith unto them if ye were
[1:36:07] abraham's children he would do the works
[1:36:10] of abraham so now he's trying to say i
[1:36:12] you can certainly be identified
[1:36:16] whether it's natural cedar spiritual
[1:36:17] seed here that's what he's saying
[1:36:22] at this point they're confessing to be
[1:36:24] heirs of the coming of the promise the
[1:36:26] spiritual seed that's what they're
[1:36:27] confessing but jesus says no
[1:36:30] but now ye seek to kill me a man that
[1:36:33] have told you the truth which i
[1:36:35] have heard of god
[1:36:37] this
[1:36:38] did not abraham
[1:36:45] so
[1:36:46] he's saying yeah you're the seed of
[1:36:48] abraham i'm okay
[1:36:50] but the spiritual seed don't do this the
[1:36:52] spiritual seed don't kill
[1:36:55] just just because they don't kill period
[1:36:59] you know brother brandon talked about
[1:37:00] saying things to other people
[1:37:04] behind someone's back
[1:37:08] it's called murdering them
[1:37:11] killing their influence killing some
[1:37:13] influence that they could have with that
[1:37:15] person down the road but you decided to
[1:37:17] say something
[1:37:19] he says that's the same thing as murder
[1:37:23] that's what the prophet told us
[1:37:26] so we see that
[1:37:28] and of course
[1:37:29] before we were born again we were doing
[1:37:31] that stuff all the time
[1:37:34] but
[1:37:35] by faith being born again
[1:37:38] receiving the spiritual seed the being
[1:37:41] born by the will of god we just don't do
[1:37:43] that no more
[1:37:44] we just don't do it and when we do
[1:37:47] we make it right
[1:37:48] i know this may seem to be strong and
[1:37:50] hard but listen this
[1:37:53] we're we're just going off what what
[1:37:55] jesus said this did not abraham nor his
[1:37:59] spiritual seed
[1:38:01] it was the natural seed of abraham that
[1:38:03] did this
[1:38:07] jesus was taking their natural seed of
[1:38:09] abraham and bringing it back to the
[1:38:10] spiritual seat of the enemy the devil
[1:38:14] you do the deeds of your father
[1:38:16] verse 41 they said
[1:38:18] they said they to him we be not born of
[1:38:21] fornication
[1:38:22] we have one father even god see how
[1:38:25] religious and strong they are and you
[1:38:27] know they're pointing a finger at jesus
[1:38:29] you're a fornicator
[1:38:31] you were born a fornication that's what
[1:38:33] they were doing
[1:38:34] they were calling them out because he
[1:38:36] was born out of wedlock
[1:38:41] in their eyes
[1:38:45] we were not born a fornication
[1:38:49] your mother your mother found you before
[1:38:51] you were married
[1:38:53] come on
[1:38:56] this is not pointed at anybody this is
[1:38:58] just just stating the facts jesus said
[1:39:00] unto them if god were your father you
[1:39:02] would love me
[1:39:04] think about that if we are god's
[1:39:06] spiritual seed we will love
[1:39:09] right amen amen
[1:39:11] proceeded forth and came
[1:39:13] from god neither came i myself but he
[1:39:16] sent me
[1:39:17] why do you not understand my speech even
[1:39:19] because you cannot hear my word
[1:39:23] jesus told pilate everyone that is of
[1:39:25] truth heareth by voice
[1:39:27] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:39:29] me we're hearing the word of god what
[1:39:31] god wants us to do
[1:39:40] hmm
[1:39:41] last verse ye are of your father the
[1:39:43] devil
[1:39:45] and the lust of your father you will do.
[1:39:48] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:39:50] abode not the truth because there is no
[1:39:51] truth in him where he speaketh the law
[1:39:53] he speaketh what of his own
[1:39:55] for he is a liar and the father of it
[1:39:58] amen
[1:40:02] it's scary because these these people
[1:40:04] were the most religious people on the
[1:40:06] planet at that time there was nobody
[1:40:09] they were even identifying themselves
[1:40:12] they could prove they were of the seed
[1:40:13] of abraham
[1:40:15] but yet they
[1:40:17] they weren't of the covenant
[1:40:19] the spiritual covenant it was the
[1:40:22] natural
[1:40:24] but not the spiritual
[1:40:26] and so i just want to saints as we move
[1:40:28] forward to focus let's put our attention
[1:40:32] on what god has really promised
[1:40:34] the heir
[1:40:36] of abraham the heir of god
[1:40:39] what has he made his joint heir with
[1:40:43] he's taken us back to his nature
[1:40:46] let us focus on that let that become the
[1:40:48] most important thing let's let that be
[1:40:50] the thing that we talk about at the
[1:40:52] dinner table the things that we talk
[1:40:54] about you know if we just say you know
[1:40:55] we all need to be more like christ let's
[1:40:57] pray for so and so and let's let's help
[1:41:00] so and so let's intercede for so and so
[1:41:02] we all need the nature of christ i'm
[1:41:04] telling you this will get the train down
[1:41:06] the track
[1:41:07] this will help us to to grow like like
[1:41:10] god is calling us to grow
[1:41:12] amen let's stand together
[1:41:19] and those scriptures that i gave you
[1:41:20] they were not all homework by the way
[1:41:22] that's just
[1:41:24] that's just
[1:41:25] extra curriculum you know how you if you
[1:41:26] did extra work you got extra points
[1:41:30] and i i believe that god will just give
[1:41:32] you extra blessings if you spend some
[1:41:34] time just seeking
[1:41:37] that nature of christ
[1:41:39] now we are
[1:41:41] the seed the spiritual seed of abraham
[1:41:45] by faith

[1:41:51] no matter what
[1:41:55] don't wait till you see it believe it
[1:41:58] because we're all in the process
[1:42:00] of becoming more like jesus
[1:42:04] and i i want to continue to be born
