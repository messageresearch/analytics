[37:11] reading of this word Lord upon our
[37:15] understanding upon our heart to receive
[37:17] it on good ground and Lord that we would
[37:21] uh that we would we would benefit and
[37:24] become real genuine Believers in your
[37:28] word father we give you the praise now
[37:31] for we ask it humbly in Jesus Christ's
[37:34] name amen turn with me if you would to
[37:37] the book of St John chapter
[37:42] 6 and we'll try
[37:45] to read through this uh
[37:49] quickly how many REM St John chapter
[37:54] 6 amen how many
[37:58] this is the first time you're reading
[38:01] it there's a lot that happens in uh St
[38:05] John chapter 6 um but we want to start
[38:09] here at verse uh number
[38:12] 52 and we want to get it well brother
[38:16] brandom uh read these scriptures mainly
[38:20] from 60 to 72 when he preached on three
[38:23] kinds of
[38:24] Believers and we just want to dive into
[38:26] one of those
[38:28] but we'll see these three types of
[38:30] Believers in these
[38:31] scriptures starting with verse number 52
[38:34] and the Jews therefore strove among
[38:36] themselves saying how can this man give
[38:38] us his flesh to eat and then Jesus said
[38:42] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[38:44] except he eat the Flesh of the son of
[38:47] man and drink his blood you don't even
[38:49] have any life In You whosoever eateth My
[38:52] Flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal
[38:54] life and I will raise him up at the last
[38:56] day amen for my flesh is meat indeed my
[38:59] blood is drink indeed he that eateth my
[39:02] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
[39:04] me and I in him and as the living father
[39:06] sent me I live by the father so he that
[39:09] eateth me even he shall live by me this
[39:12] is the bread which came down from heaven
[39:15] not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[39:18] dead he that eateth of this bread shall
[39:21] live forever these things said in in the
[39:24] synagogue is he taught in cernium now
[39:26] many therefore of his disciples when
[39:30] they heard this said this is a hard
[39:36] saying who can hear it amen and when
[39:39] Jesus knew in himself that his disciples
[39:43] murmured at it he said unto them does
[39:47] this offend you you offended at the word
[39:50] that's being preached what and if ye
[39:53] shall see the son of man as sent up
[39:55] where he was before it is the spirit
[39:58] that Quicken it the flesh profit nothing
[40:01] the words that I speak unto you they are
[40:04] spirit and they are
[40:07] life but there are some of you that
[40:10] believe not where Jesus knew from the
[40:13] beginning who it was that would that
[40:15] believe not and he and who should be
[40:20] betray him so he's
[40:25] amen and he said therefore said I unto
[40:28] you that no man can come unto me except
[40:30] it were given of him of my father from
[40:33] that time many of his disciples went
[40:37] back and walked no more with
[40:41] him then said Jesus unto the TW
[40:47] disciples will you also go away and then
[40:52] Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom
[40:54] shall we go thou H has the words of
[40:56] eternal life we we believe that we and
[41:01] are sure that thou art Christ the son of
[41:03] the Living God and Jesus answered have
[41:05] not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a
[41:07] devil he spake of Judas the scariot the
[41:10] son of Simon for it for he it is what
[41:14] for he it was that should betray him
[41:17] being one of the twel amen God bless you
[41:21] you may be seated I know that was kind
[41:22] of a lengthy lengthy reading there um
[41:27] and we'll probably get into this uh a
[41:30] little bit uh more in
[41:33] detail uh as we talk about the other
[41:37] believers but tonight we just want to
[41:38] talk about one of the three
[41:40] Believers and I just want to start out
[41:43] with this quote that brother brandom
[41:45] spoke of at the beginning of his message
[41:48] three kinds of Believers he said the the
[41:51] first is the
[41:53] believer the makeb believer and the
[41:56] unbeliever now there's this is quite a
[41:58] subject but as as sure as we are sit
[42:01] here
[42:02] tonight that group is always gathered
[42:06] together amen wherever the people are
[42:08] gathered we find this group and always
[42:11] have found them and we probably always
[42:14] will have them until the coming of the
[42:17] Lord amen and I want us tonight to
[42:20] picture ourselves as I speak on these
[42:24] three groups and see what group we're in
[42:30] amen
[42:32] whoa what group were
[42:38] in
[42:40] now brother Brandon preached this
[42:43] message in his home Church in
[42:45] Jeffersonville Indiana now you would
[42:47] think that that church was full of
[42:52] Believers and that he would just tell
[42:55] the church you're all believers
[42:58] but he
[42:59] didn't and he wanted his
[43:02] church to see which
[43:04] one they were
[43:08] betraying and and so this in itself is
[43:12] is a is a hard
[43:14] saying I I would imagine if you asked
[43:17] every one of them in the church are you
[43:19] a Believer and a Believer or M believer
[43:21] they would all say well we're Believers
[43:23] brother Bram we believe this messag amen
[43:26] but on the the contrary he was sending a
[43:29] message no we're
[43:30] not and he actually says this at the end
[43:33] of the message right before he prays he
[43:37] says look you're in one of these
[43:40] classes he says in your present state
[43:43] right now the present state of your mind
[43:47] right that you're here in the visible
[43:49] audience and you that are in The
[43:52] Invisible audience of this tape your
[43:56] Pres state of mind after listening to
[43:59] this tape proves to you what class
[44:02] you're in it tells you exactly where you
[44:05] are whether you're a believer in the
[44:07] word and stay with it or whether you'll
[44:11] walk out and shut the door and shut the
[44:13] tape off H that tells you what you've
[44:19] done you don't want to listen to it you
[44:21] shut it off I don't want to listen to
[44:24] that well that's that un
[44:28] believer see you won't stop to test it
[44:31] and see if it's the truth or not or just
[44:33] hanging around to trying to see some
[44:35] fault then you know what you are too it
[44:37] tells you see God help us to believe it
[44:39] stand with it be loyal to it obey the
[44:41] word for he is the word do you believe
[44:44] that he says let us
[44:48] pray let us pray this is in one sense
[44:51] it's a sobering subject but the reason
[44:54] that I really want to bring it is
[44:55] because the has convinced so many people
[44:59] who do not believe all the word that
[45:02] they are believers and just simply that
[45:05] is the reason that that is the purpose
[45:08] and the reason that I fell in my
[45:11] heart so as we take a look at these we
[45:14] want to just concentrate on the
[45:15] unbeliever today I want to ask this
[45:17] question is the devil a Believer or is
[45:20] he an
[45:24] unbeliever now now God is a Believer and
[45:26] he says only
[45:28] believe he told us to only believe he's
[45:31] he he that's the key is to to to believe
[45:36] now is the devil considered one of
[45:40] those who's telling us to believe and
[45:43] believe or or is he viewed at as an
[45:47] unbeliever he don't believe in serving
[45:52] God I'm just I'm just trying to stir us
[45:55] up in the thinking
[45:58] process James 2:19 says Thou believest
[46:01] that there is one God thou doest well
[46:04] the Devils also believe and tremble
[46:07] amen amen so the devil knows that
[46:10] there's one God and if the devil knows
[46:13] he's there's only one God why is he
[46:15] trying to exalt himself above the Throne
[46:18] of
[46:20] God and and and truly the answer to this
[46:23] this question shows the real
[46:26] characteristic of an
[46:29] unbeliever the devil quoted
[46:32] 99.97% of the word to Eve exactly but he
[46:36] refused to agree with it all and there
[46:40] is the dividing line between the
[46:42] believer and the
[46:46] unbeliever the devil believe yet he's
[46:49] identified as an
[46:52] unbeliever the unbeliever isn't just an
[46:55] Infidel that says there's no God
[46:58] but he's one that does not believe every
[47:01] word of God the unbeliever sits in the
[47:04] church but he refuses to unite his life
[47:09] with the word of God
[47:11] Amen and I know that's
[47:14] strong but we've got to come to grips
[47:16] with
[47:18] it brother brandom said in Satan's Eden
[47:21] he said there is a God of this world and
[47:23] I preached to you about last Sunday
[47:27] here he is today in deceit that
[47:30] treacherous hour that treacherous time
[47:32] that we're living in the most glorious
[47:34] time of Ages because we're facing the
[47:36] great Millennium again we're facing the
[47:38] Eden again but right at this age all the
[47:41] de heat and every tactic that he's ever
[47:44] used has been able to deceive with he's
[47:48] Gathering it all together and reinforce
[47:51] himself and come down like God and has
[47:54] put himself in the place of God Rel
[47:57] religious and can quote the scripture
[47:59] and can tell you the scripture just as
[48:01] Satan did to Eve in the garden but leave
[48:05] one leave out one spot of it amen is all
[48:09] he has to do is make a
[48:17] Gap a
[48:20] gap so let's listen to this definition
[48:23] of an unbeliever in a church it's some
[48:27] who's willing to leave out one word out
[48:30] of their
[48:32] life how often we are programmed with
[48:36] the aspect of well I go to church I do
[48:39] this I pay my ties I do this I I I don't
[48:43] do that but I'm still a
[48:47] Believer but are we but are we a
[48:50] Believer now I'm not saying we all have
[48:53] to be 100% perfect in living the word I
[48:56] want to make it clear I am not saying
[48:59] that but what I am saying is we should
[49:02] be striving to live all the word because
[49:06] if we have an attitude of it doesn't
[49:09] really matter if I do it all I'm still
[49:12] believer we're an unbeliever we do not
[49:14] realize it amen I know this is strong
[49:18] amen
[49:20] but if it helps us get to where we got
[49:22] to get to then it's worth it
[49:25] right now San job is to create a
[49:28] gap between our heart and the word of
[49:31] God Amen and he don't care if that Gap
[49:35] is this big or an
[49:38] Infidel as long as there's a gap because
[49:41] that Gap is what keeps
[49:44] us from going all the way with God
[49:47] that's right so we look at people who
[49:50] are really far away from God as an
[49:53] unbeliever
[49:57] and those who go to church and are
[49:59] living some of the word as a
[50:02] Believer but that's wrong we shouldn't
[50:04] do
[50:06] that uh it doesn't matter if they're
[50:08] they're professing to be a
[50:11] believer Satan's job will always be to
[50:15] bring a gap and and that Gap is by
[50:17] getting us to doubt you know doubt the
[50:20] word now brother brand gives examples of
[50:24] be Bel chazar Ahab Ahab they they were
[50:28] they thought they were Believers but
[50:31] they were unbelievers he
[50:33] said unbelievers they deny the whole
[50:37] word of God to be true he says he
[50:40] believes it but he denies it he says
[50:43] well so much uh so much of it is well he
[50:48] says but if it's not if it isn't right
[50:50] then that makes him an unbeliever it all
[50:53] has to be you've got to believe every T
[50:57] every jot everything that's said in
[50:59] there it's got to be true if you if you
[51:02] say now well you know I don't know I
[51:05] don't believe that he says then you're
[51:07] an
[51:08] unbeliever
[51:10] true so really what we're doing is we
[51:12] know an unbeliever somebody that doesn't
[51:15] want anything to do with God doesn't
[51:16] want to talk about it doesn't want to go
[51:19] to church doesn't want no we know he's
[51:20] an unbeliever right what we don't know
[51:23] is the person who's a 99 % believer but
[51:27] there's still something that he refuses
[51:29] to do that God told him to do he thinks
[51:32] he's a Believer true and as long as
[51:35] Satan can get that person to think that
[51:37] he's a Believer he won't try to do that
[51:40] other part that's good are you with
[51:44] me all
[51:46] right who's not with
[51:51] me the job of the Holy Ghost is to unite
[51:54] us with the word if it's s job to get us
[51:58] to have a gap between them it's God's
[52:00] job to get us to unite with it am we
[52:03] know in Deuteronomy 6 if you want to
[52:05] write it down 4 through 7 uh here oh
[52:09] Israel Lord our God is one Lord Thou
[52:11] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[52:13] heart with all thy soul with all thy
[52:14] might amen and and and these words I
[52:17] commanded they got to be in your heart
[52:19] you got to teach them to your children
[52:21] right so the word has to be first a
[52:24] total commitment not 99%
[52:28] we talked about I believe uh last
[52:31] service that uh this is the message that
[52:34] we've heard from the beginning decare to
[52:36] you that God is light and in him is no
[52:39] Darkness at all if we say we have
[52:41] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[52:43] we do not the truth we're we're lying so
[52:46] the whole idea is God is trying to get
[52:49] us to walk out of the darkness that
[52:51] we're in and to walk into more light
[52:54] what we're going to be doing is we're
[52:55] going to be creating more of a Oneness
[52:57] with God uh that that his whole desire
[53:00] is that we become just like him we'll
[53:03] see him as he is and and and there's no
[53:07] Gap amen and and and I know that the
[53:11] other churches are not going to be
[53:12] teaching this and that's
[53:19] okay I don't want to be part of that
[53:22] group that says well
[53:26] I I thought because I did this and did
[53:30] this and did that you know that I I made
[53:35] it right depart from me ye workers of
[53:40] iniquity what's iniquity not doing what
[53:43] you were told you knew you should
[53:45] do all
[53:48] right brother brother Ram said in the
[53:50] message Abraham and his seed after him
[53:52] just shown the importance now of
[53:55] separating from darkness and unbelief
[53:58] and now and then notice as soon as
[54:02] Abraham believed God by
[54:04] justification and in parentheses that
[54:06] means Believing on the Lord were
[54:09] Justified so as soon as he believed on
[54:12] God immediately God called Abraham to
[54:16] separate from all unbelief
[54:19] right yes and we and and and the the
[54:22] mentality is as soon as somebody gets
[54:25] Justified there a they're they're in
[54:27] they're they're they're sold out they're
[54:29] they're where they need to be and yet
[54:31] God said this is beginning since you've
[54:33] taken this step I want to let you know
[54:35] you got to separate from everything that
[54:37] disbelieves this word yes
[54:40] Amen in the message
[54:42] possessing all things brother see God
[54:45] when he called Abraham he called him to
[54:47] separate from every from himself from
[54:51] everything and that's what we have to do
[54:54] God calls us to totally separate from
[54:57] sin now he said what's sin sin is
[55:00] unbelief
[55:02] amen come out of her my people and be
[55:04] not partakers of her sin so in Genesis
[55:09] we see at the very beginning God
[55:11] separated the light from the darkness
[55:14] and brother bandam says in the message
[55:16] God's word calls for total separation
[55:17] from unbelief he says the spirit of God
[55:20] spoke out and said let there be light
[55:22] and he separated the light from darkness
[55:24] and he's been doing that ever since
[55:26] separating light from Darkness amen and
[55:29] that's what happens when we come to
[55:31] church it's why we love to come to
[55:32] church we want the spotlight of the word
[55:34] of God to shine on our life to shine out
[55:36] the darkness let us see where we're
[55:38] standing with
[55:41] God so Jesus speaking in St John 17 if
[55:46] you want to write it down just read the
[55:49] chapter there's so many different verses
[55:50] here but he spokes these words and he
[55:52] says I have given them Thy Word
[55:57] I have given them Thy word and he says
[55:58] sanctify
[56:00] them through thy truth Thy word is truth
[56:04] so when the word comes forth the word is
[56:07] being preached you read the word of God
[56:09] and that word is given to you for one
[56:12] reason it is to clean you from the
[56:14] inside out
[56:17] amen and he says neither pray I for
[56:20] these alone but I pray for them which
[56:22] also Shall Believe on me through their
[56:24] word
[56:27] so now the word is going to get to us
[56:29] not through the the 12 disciples but
[56:32] through the disciples Through the Ages
[56:34] right and they that they all may be one
[56:39] amen the purpose now is to send the word
[56:42] to bring sanctification is that they
[56:44] would be
[56:45] one father uh that thou that thou I'm
[56:50] sorry that they all may be one as thou
[56:52] father art in me and I in thee that they
[56:54] also may be one in US
[56:57] i i in them and thou in me that they may
[57:00] be perfect in one or that is complete
[57:04] Oneness in God there is no Darkness
[57:07] there is no unbelief and in us there
[57:12] is
[57:14] right we you know mentally we don't want
[57:17] to say there is
[57:19] any but as soon as that word's being
[57:21] preached and oh yeah that's right I I
[57:24] haven't I I haven't been doing that the
[57:26] word says I should be doing that that's
[57:28] calling it out right there and that's
[57:31] why I like you know brother brandom I
[57:33] don't think he's
[57:35] really I I can't speak for brother
[57:38] Brandon but I like the way that brother
[57:40] Brandon said that it's our state of mind
[57:42] we don't want to put somebody in a group
[57:44] you know this person is a a Believer
[57:47] this person is an unbeliever right you
[57:49] know we don't want to do that but at our
[57:53] state of mind at any time we come in the
[57:55] church it it it it's in one of those
[57:58] it's in one of those states do you
[58:00] believe that amen Amen brother BR said
[58:03] in the message God's eye God's eye he
[58:07] said be real reverent please if you will
[58:11] unbelief is one of the most horrible
[58:13] things that there is yes let me go any
[58:17] way but don't let me be a religious
[58:22] unbeliever unbelief is the only sin
[58:24] there is smoking drinking commit
[58:26] adultery cursing swearing that's not
[58:29] sin that's that's attributes of unbelief
[58:32] right he that believeth
[58:36] not uh he that believeth not is
[58:39] condemned already he's quoting Jesus and
[58:42] people who claim to be religious go to
[58:44] church Pious and still rank unbelievers
[58:48] Sinners Jesus said you're of your father
[58:50] of the
[58:51] devil and yet they will just as pious
[58:56] and religious as they could be the worst
[59:00] demon there is to deal with is a
[59:02] religious demon that's right he said
[59:06] they are five times more horrible than
[59:09] any other evil spirit think about
[59:15] that so you know we look at evil spirits
[59:19] as like whoa I mean they're just dark
[59:23] they're wearing the dark clothes they're
[59:24] just I mean
[59:27] oh but now he's talking about something
[59:31] a a demon that's much five times worse
[59:34] of that sits in the church right five
[59:38] times worse
[59:41] yes he's religious amen he uses part of
[59:45] the
[59:47] word amen we're taught by Jesus there's
[59:50] a Broadway and a narrow way the Broadway
[59:54] he said many go in there at we might
[59:56] might say it like this many unbelievers
[59:59] go in there at so one in the spectrum of
[1:00:02] the unbeliever is I don't believe in God
[1:00:04] I don't want to go to church I I don't
[1:00:06] want to talk about God and the other end
[1:00:08] of the spectrum is I believe in God I
[1:00:12] sincerely Tremble When I fearfully think
[1:00:16] about falling into the hands of God when
[1:00:18] I die because I know I'm not going to be
[1:00:20] where I should be amen that is still an
[1:00:24] unbeliever because he refuses to live by
[1:00:28] the every word of God
[1:00:30] Amen both our unbelievers the unbeliever
[1:00:34] that sits in church he still believes
[1:00:37] but only partially
[1:00:41] believes so it's important which part
[1:00:44] you know we sing that song Lord search
[1:00:47] me see if there be some Wicked way amen
[1:00:50] our hearts are deceitful who can know it
[1:00:53] it takes God to to to show us what's
[1:00:55] real really in there and you know I
[1:00:58] praise God for all that we believe
[1:01:00] in but the part that God is interested
[1:01:04] is in the part that we need to start
[1:01:06] believing
[1:01:11] in in our opening scripture there were
[1:01:15] 70 disciples that believed on the Lord
[1:01:18] and they followed the Lord but it says
[1:01:21] in John
[1:01:23] 666 the mark of the beast as John le
[1:01:26] Fontaine used to say from that time many
[1:01:30] of his disciples went back and walked no
[1:01:34] more with
[1:01:38] him
[1:01:42] so but he calls them
[1:01:46] Believers but they're not full
[1:01:49] Believers if you're not a full believer
[1:01:52] you are now an
[1:01:54] unbeliever if you're not a full believer
[1:01:56] you're an unbeliever that's right and
[1:02:00] it's just a matter of time before you
[1:02:05] stop John chapter
[1:02:08] 8 John chapter 8 very this is just a
[1:02:12] little bit further in in the chapter and
[1:02:15] uh starting with verse 29 in and St John
[1:02:19] chapter
[1:02:19] 8 uh and he that sent me is with me the
[1:02:24] father have not not left me alone for I
[1:02:28] for I do always those things that please
[1:02:30] him and he spake these word and as he
[1:02:34] spake these words many believed on him
[1:02:38] we could call them Believers right then
[1:02:42] Jesus said to the Jews which believed on
[1:02:45] him if you continue in my word then
[1:02:47] you're my disciples indeed now just
[1:02:49] remember the two chapters before there
[1:02:52] were his these Believers that believed
[1:02:55] on him but then they walked
[1:02:57] away and now he's telling hey look you
[1:03:00] got to continue in the word I'm going to
[1:03:02] be giving you word down the road right
[1:03:05] and this word you got to take it you got
[1:03:07] to run with it you got to you got to
[1:03:09] live it amen you got to continue in the
[1:03:12] word amen and then if you continue in
[1:03:14] the word he says you shall be my
[1:03:17] disciples
[1:03:19] indeed and he and you shall know the
[1:03:22] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:03:26] yes well I'm already
[1:03:29] free that's the attitude that's the same
[1:03:32] attitude these
[1:03:33] religious I'm already free I'm already
[1:03:38] saved Lord help us to to
[1:03:42] catch the importance of believing all
[1:03:45] the word of God now I want to I want to
[1:03:49] mix a little bit of this um to show how
[1:03:55] how if we respond to the word the right
[1:03:57] way we become the word and we're proving
[1:04:01] with our life that we're a Believer are
[1:04:04] you with me turn with me to First Peter
[1:04:06] chapter
[1:04:08] 22 I mean chapter 1 verse
[1:04:12] 22 the the word when it's preached if we
[1:04:16] receive it into our hearts and we're
[1:04:19] doing everything we can to live it out
[1:04:22] it is what purifies our life it's what
[1:04:26] gets us
[1:04:28] ready how can a person say they're born
[1:04:31] again by the word of God to become the
[1:04:33] word of God and not believe part of the
[1:04:35] word of
[1:04:36] God it it just doesn't make sense if you
[1:04:40] say you're born again by the word then
[1:04:43] you're not going to deny the word that
[1:04:46] you've been born by because every seed
[1:04:48] comes brings forth of its own kind all
[1:04:51] right 1 Peter chapter 1:22 seeing you
[1:04:54] have purified your souls in obeying the
[1:04:58] truth is that what Jesus told us that
[1:05:02] word sanctifies us through the spirit
[1:05:06] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[1:05:09] that you love one another with a pure
[1:05:11] heart fervently amen being born again
[1:05:13] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:05:15] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:05:17] liveth and abideth forever for all the
[1:05:20] flesh is grass all and all the glory of
[1:05:22] man is the flower of grass the grass
[1:05:24] wither the flower thereof falleth away
[1:05:27] but the word of the Lord endureth
[1:05:28] forever and this is the word which we W
[1:05:31] which by the gospel is preached onto you
[1:05:34] so the word is sent to purify our souls
[1:05:39] now it's one thing to go to church that
[1:05:42] all you do is believe in
[1:05:44] justification the blood just covers me
[1:05:46] that's all the blood the blood the blood
[1:05:48] Calvary that's all that's all that's it
[1:05:49] that's
[1:05:51] it what you're doing is you're taking
[1:05:53] away the rest of the word that's right
[1:05:56] you need all the word amen and this word
[1:06:00] is what purifies our souls when we obey
[1:06:03] it
[1:06:04] amen all right 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 6
[1:06:08] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 6
[1:06:12] through1 wherefore also it is contained
[1:06:15] in the scriptures behold I lay in Zion a
[1:06:19] chief Corner Stone elect precious and he
[1:06:21] that believeth on him shall not be
[1:06:24] confounded unto you therefore which
[1:06:27] believe now here's the
[1:06:28] believer unto you therefore which
[1:06:30] believe he is precious but unto
[1:06:34] them which be
[1:06:38] disobedient now these are the
[1:06:41] unbelievers the stone which the builders
[1:06:44] disallowed the same is made the head of
[1:06:48] the corner I know this is strong but if
[1:06:52] you're disobedient you're projecting
[1:06:54] yourself an unbeliever most people want
[1:06:57] to say look I I'm I'm still a believer
[1:07:01] I'm just being disobedient that's
[1:07:04] true I'm I'm just we trying to line up
[1:07:07] with the scriptures and what you know
[1:07:09] the the the Seer the prophet in this age
[1:07:13] he could see he went up he could see and
[1:07:16] came back down and and taught us all
[1:07:20] right then he says here in verse eight
[1:07:22] and a stone of stumbling
[1:07:25] a rock of
[1:07:27] offense even to them which stumble at
[1:07:32] the
[1:07:33] word being
[1:07:36] disobedient where unto also they were
[1:07:42] appointed they can't be a
[1:07:44] believer they're stumbling at the
[1:07:47] word stumbling to believe it if you
[1:07:49] don't believe it you're not going to
[1:07:50] obey
[1:07:51] it but then he says you're a chosen
[1:07:54] generation a royal prieser a holy nation
[1:07:56] A peculiar people that you should show
[1:07:58] forth the Praises of him that called you
[1:07:59] out of that Darkness right that that
[1:08:02] part where you don't you you you're just
[1:08:04] struggling and believing all the word
[1:08:06] now you you you believe all the word you
[1:08:08] came out of that Darkness Into His
[1:08:09] Marvelous Light which in times past you
[1:08:12] were not a people but now you are the
[1:08:13] people of God which have not obtained
[1:08:15] Mercy but now have obtained Mercy the 70
[1:08:20] disciples who left Jesus in Matthew or
[1:08:23] in St John chapter six are a perfect
[1:08:27] example of
[1:08:29] unbelievers even they an unbeliever many
[1:08:33] times believes part of the word but he
[1:08:35] doesn't believe all of it and eventually
[1:08:38] he will go and just do his own thing
[1:08:41] amen the children of Israel they
[1:08:43] stumbled at the word amen they became
[1:08:47] disobedient and they are another good
[1:08:49] example of an
[1:08:53] unbeliever in the message three kinds of
[1:08:55] Believers brother B says a real
[1:08:58] believer don't hear nothing but the
[1:09:02] word he said that's all he watches the
[1:09:06] word he ain't looking for no loopholes
[1:09:09] he ain't looking for no gimmicks he
[1:09:12] believes God and that settles it and he
[1:09:14] just keeps going on he there is a he
[1:09:19] said there is the believer amen the
[1:09:23] unbeliever fills up in a
[1:09:27] minute what's he referring to fills up
[1:09:29] it just comes to church fills up with
[1:09:32] the word and just a
[1:09:34] minute and he can't stay to listen 10
[1:09:37] minutes of the message he's got to get
[1:09:40] up and walk out
[1:09:42] true this little guy that's filled up
[1:09:45] quick it jumps up and runs out at every
[1:09:48] little phase that he don't like you
[1:09:51] don't pay no attention to him he's just
[1:09:54] an un believer to begin with right see
[1:09:58] the difference between a Believer is
[1:10:00] just hungry wants the word give me more
[1:10:02] of the word and unbelievers you know
[1:10:05] that's too much that's too much I've had
[1:10:08] enough are you with me now these are not
[1:10:11] my words this is just what the prophet
[1:10:13] brought us it's helping us
[1:10:15] recognize you know brother man said this
[1:10:17] statement he says it's real easy to know
[1:10:19] where you're going where are you being
[1:10:20] drawn to yeah that's it where's your
[1:10:22] where's your desire where's your hunger
[1:10:25] yeah because we're all manifesting right
[1:10:27] it's manifesting
[1:10:29] time in the book of Jude turn with me if
[1:10:32] you would to the book of
[1:10:34] Jude take a look at this children of
[1:10:37] Israel uh maybe for a little bit uh
[1:10:40] we're making some good time and I'm I'm
[1:10:42] skipping a lot of stuff so I'm real
[1:10:44] happy about you know making good time
[1:10:47] the Lord Jude verse one says Jude the
[1:10:50] servant of Jesus Christ and the brother
[1:10:52] James to them that are number one these
[1:10:54] are San ified they're not only Justified
[1:10:57] they're Sanctified by God the father and
[1:11:00] preserved in Jesus Christ and called
[1:11:03] Mercy unto you and peace and love be
[1:11:05] multiplied beloved when I gave all
[1:11:07] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:11:09] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:11:10] to write unto you and to exhort you that
[1:11:12] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:11:14] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:11:16] Saints so the purpose of this letter
[1:11:19] that Jude is writing is to tell the
[1:11:20] Believers that are Sanctified and that
[1:11:23] are preserved in God that they need to
[1:11:26] just not sit around like a like like you
[1:11:28] would a can that's preserved right your
[1:11:32] spaghetti that's preserved or your beans
[1:11:34] or your peaches or your pears he says
[1:11:37] but you got to get up and you got to
[1:11:40] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:11:43] once delivered to the
[1:11:47] Saints a different total
[1:11:51] mentality totally different mentality
[1:11:54] than I'm saved amen I'm
[1:11:59] Sanctified I'm
[1:12:01] preserved
[1:12:05] what there this wasn't just an idea that
[1:12:08] Jude had this was a burden on his heart
[1:12:12] I think God put on his heart to write
[1:12:15] it and he says when I gave all diligence
[1:12:18] it was needful for me to tell you about
[1:12:22] this important thing that you should
[1:12:24] earnestly content for the faith you got
[1:12:26] to make sure that you got it you got to
[1:12:28] make sure you're believing every word
[1:12:31] that's right that you're walking in it
[1:12:34] amen it's not an
[1:12:40] option the devil is not giving up on
[1:12:42] anybody I don't care if you're preserved
[1:12:44] or not Satan is sticking around seeking
[1:12:47] whom he may devour amen and the only way
[1:12:50] to combat Leo DEA is earnestly contend
[1:12:53] for the original Faith amen
[1:12:55] I believe
[1:12:56] that verse four for there are certain
[1:13:01] men who crept in
[1:13:05] unawares the church don't even know
[1:13:07] about
[1:13:08] it crept in
[1:13:10] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:13:14] to this condemnation they're called
[1:13:17] ungodly men turning the grace of the
[1:13:19] Lord grace of our God into
[1:13:22] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[1:13:25] Lord God and our Lord Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ now it's important that we we try
[1:13:32] to understand what this verse
[1:13:38] is people who are turning the grace or
[1:13:42] or or or denying the Lord God no one's
[1:13:45] no one's ever going to say I deny that
[1:13:47] Jesus Christ I deny Jesus Christ they're
[1:13:50] not going to say that but but when they
[1:13:53] start entertaining doing their own will
[1:13:56] instead of God's will after they know
[1:13:59] what God's will is they're denying the
[1:14:01] only Lord because if he ain't Lord of
[1:14:04] everything he's not Lord at
[1:14:08] all so if we want to start going another
[1:14:12] way than God's way we're actually
[1:14:14] denying the
[1:14:15] word which is denying the only Lord God
[1:14:19] Amen now I know this is strong but we
[1:14:21] just we just we got to look at the
[1:14:23] importance of how important the Bible is
[1:14:25] to us that that that's the whole purpose
[1:14:27] of this to become in love with the word
[1:14:29] of God to become one with the word there
[1:14:32] are
[1:14:33] believers they were saved by the grace
[1:14:36] of God and then they began to walk after
[1:14:39] their own will they became self-willed
[1:14:43] walking without the fear of God they
[1:14:46] turned the grace of God into
[1:14:49] disgrace they're not afraid to want
[1:14:52] whatever they want they became
[1:14:54] irreverent
[1:14:56] impious they stopped showing respect
[1:14:59] reverence they became presumptuous oh it
[1:15:02] won't matter to God I'm sure it'll be
[1:15:06] okay now they were
[1:15:09] believers who God destroyed because of
[1:15:12] their unbelief so at one time they
[1:15:14] believe but God had to destroy them
[1:15:15] because they did not continue they
[1:15:18] didn't earnestly contend they didn't see
[1:15:20] a need to contend for the faith they had
[1:15:21] enough Faith are you with me that's what
[1:15:25] you said oh do you believe are you a
[1:15:26] Believer do you got faith yeah I'm a
[1:15:28] Believer I got faith that wasn't the
[1:15:30] mentality of
[1:15:32] Jude verse five I will therefore put you
[1:15:36] in remembrance though ye once knew this
[1:15:40] how that the Lord having saved the
[1:15:42] people out of the land of
[1:15:44] Egypt afterwards he destroyed them that
[1:15:50] believed
[1:15:51] not now when they all came out of Egypt
[1:15:55] they all believed
[1:15:56] amen he even called them my people my
[1:16:00] people I heard the The Cry of my people
[1:16:02] I've come
[1:16:03] down so here these are his people they
[1:16:06] came down they actually had a Hallelujah
[1:16:09] rejoicing service after they crossed the
[1:16:12] Red Sea that's
[1:16:14] right and I tell you brother Ron they
[1:16:17] didn't have a hard time they didn't have
[1:16:19] a time they they were just set free from
[1:16:22] the task masker amen they were
[1:16:26] Believers amen but they did not contend
[1:16:31] for the original Faith which because the
[1:16:32] original Faith the original voice the re
[1:16:35] the original Revelation is I have a land
[1:16:38] for you just taking you out of here is
[1:16:40] just part of it but the the full promise
[1:16:44] is I got a land for you and they did not
[1:16:46] keep that original faith and so look
[1:16:49] yeah this message came to get us out of
[1:16:51] a denomination but that ain't all it did
[1:16:54] it was to take us into the word to the
[1:16:56] Manifest of the word of the hour and I
[1:16:58] think too many people are stopping they
[1:17:00] don't want to press into that
[1:17:03] amen that's why we got to earnestly
[1:17:08] contend verse six and the
[1:17:12] angels which kept not their first estate
[1:17:16] but left their own habitation has
[1:17:18] reserved in Everlasting chains in
[1:17:20] darkness unto the Judgment of that great
[1:17:22] day so he's given us another example
[1:17:24] that you got to stay on track with what
[1:17:26] you started right if Lucifer would have
[1:17:28] stayed on track and did his job in
[1:17:30] heaven there would be no
[1:17:31] evil we wouldn't you know of course we
[1:17:34] wouldn't be here and all that but but
[1:17:36] he's given the example they he left his
[1:17:38] first estate the the the children of
[1:17:42] Israel that came out of Egypt they left
[1:17:45] their first estate which is let's go
[1:17:47] into the promised land they were willing
[1:17:49] to go until the spies went over there
[1:17:51] realized that these guys are so big they
[1:17:53] came back and they gave gave an evil
[1:17:56] report right and their their hearts of
[1:17:59] the of the congregation just thought
[1:18:00] well you know I I I we can't do it we
[1:18:03] can't go it's you know it's easier to
[1:18:05] just believe than to
[1:18:08] believe something Joshua and Caleb had
[1:18:12] another
[1:18:14] Spirit had another
[1:18:16] Spirit they had a believing spirit amen
[1:18:19] they just said no we can do it he gave
[1:18:21] us the promise it isn't how big they are
[1:18:24] or how little we are that's right it's
[1:18:28] God who made the promise is able to make
[1:18:30] these Stones raised he's able to to
[1:18:33] annihilate these guys amen so two of
[1:18:38] them had faith in the word and the rest
[1:18:40] of them who were Believers start showing
[1:18:43] their colors as unbelievers are you with
[1:18:46] me and brother brandham says every one
[1:18:50] of these types of Believers is in every
[1:18:53] Church yeah every
[1:18:55] everyone it it's not our job to say who
[1:18:59] is and who
[1:19:00] isn't it is our job as brother brandham
[1:19:03] said to analyze am I believing every
[1:19:06] word am I shunning part of it am I kind
[1:19:10] of ignoring this
[1:19:11] part you read the message and brother
[1:19:14] bandam says something and something says
[1:19:16] ins say you got to start doing
[1:19:19] that I'm telling you you start doing
[1:19:21] that because if you don't you're really
[1:19:24] manifesting in you're an unbeliever amen
[1:19:27] when brother Bram says I want you as we
[1:19:29] go over these things I want you to see
[1:19:32] where you're
[1:19:33] at don't just say I'm a Believer because
[1:19:36] I've been going to your you know brandom
[1:19:38] Tabernacle for x amount of
[1:19:41] years but which part of the
[1:19:45] word this is a this is a relationship A
[1:19:48] Love Affair between you and God and God
[1:19:50] speaks to you whether he does it in the
[1:19:52] church or when you're on your knees
[1:19:54] praying
[1:19:55] or when you're listening to a tape or
[1:19:56] you're driving your car God speaks to
[1:19:59] you and that word you must believe that
[1:20:02] word if you choose not to believe it if
[1:20:04] you choose to just well I don't need I
[1:20:07] like well I believe but I'm not going to
[1:20:10] do it that is a
[1:20:13] devil that is a devil the devil believes
[1:20:16] and he trembles he doesn't submit to
[1:20:20] it we don't want to believe the word and
[1:20:23] not do it that's not good
[1:20:25] enough the whole earth is groaning
[1:20:28] waiting for the manifestation of us yes
[1:20:32] who fre more agency amen
[1:20:34] amen so I want to talk about these men
[1:20:37] that had crept in
[1:20:39] unawares so I just had of look that
[1:20:43] up
[1:20:45] unbelievers these are unbelievers that
[1:20:48] have settled in alongside of the
[1:20:53] believer so they Lodge with us secretly
[1:20:57] quietly they possess a form of godliness
[1:21:01] alongside of The Godly so the
[1:21:04] unbelievers lodge among the Believers
[1:21:06] and the mate
[1:21:12] Believers one of the
[1:21:14] signs that is common among the
[1:21:17] unbeliever is a spirit of
[1:21:20] settling for
[1:21:23] Less this is is an important one
[1:21:26] settling for Less when more light is
[1:21:30] presented to the unbeliever they're
[1:21:33] okay there's no big deal if they don't
[1:21:36] walk into
[1:21:39] it they're okay with where they're
[1:21:42] at a spirit of settling for Less a as
[1:21:47] Jesus talked about in the spirit of
[1:21:49] leoda is need of
[1:21:52] nothing settling for where they're at
[1:21:56] a spirit where the word has been shown
[1:21:59] sown among the Thorns now
[1:22:02] remember when the word fell on the four
[1:22:05] types of ground one of them was among
[1:22:07] Thorns so they had the word they
[1:22:10] rejoiced they said amen I'm a Believer
[1:22:13] yeah we want this let's get going but
[1:22:15] through the course of time when they
[1:22:17] weren't in that presence they
[1:22:20] entertained other
[1:22:23] things and those other things they took
[1:22:25] the seed in and eventually down the road
[1:22:28] they began to grow up and what do they
[1:22:31] do the Bible says Jesus said they choke
[1:22:34] out the word amen they were Believers
[1:22:37] and they became unbelievers
[1:22:41] amen sitting right amongst
[1:22:44] us don't ever let a spirit of
[1:22:49] settling with what you have be around
[1:22:53] you
[1:22:55] always be earnestly contending for more
[1:22:58] amen I want more I need more I don't
[1:23:02] know what I need but I know I need
[1:23:05] more it it's okay to say I'm not sure
[1:23:08] that's right but the but we need to be
[1:23:11] hungering there's something inside of us
[1:23:13] the the deep is calling out for the Deep
[1:23:15] there's got to be more there's got to be
[1:23:17] Victory there's got to be Joy there's
[1:23:19] got to be peace there's got to be living
[1:23:21] for others more there there's just got
[1:23:23] to be yes and and and that that love
[1:23:26] affair that's what all a sudden your
[1:23:28] intenance go up you're paying attention
[1:23:30] in in in in in the in the ministry of
[1:23:33] the word that word is for me you know
[1:23:35] how many people come in the church they
[1:23:37] come into church with a bad
[1:23:40] attitude and they wonder why they don't
[1:23:42] get anything out of
[1:23:47] it we've got to come into church like a
[1:23:50] Believer amen a
[1:23:52] Believer like God God is here
[1:23:56] yes God wants to bless me amen God wants
[1:24:02] to give me more of
[1:24:04] himself he wants to when I get more of
[1:24:06] the Holy Spirit I'm going to get more
[1:24:09] joy more peace more
[1:24:12] love amen that's what Believers
[1:24:15] believe yes we just can't come in with
[1:24:18] any old kind of attitude say I'm a
[1:24:20] Believer yeah I'm in the
[1:24:22] message so is the Devil he's really in
[1:24:24] the message you know how messed up this
[1:24:26] message
[1:24:27] is that's the and that ain't because
[1:24:31] that's because the devil's in the
[1:24:36] message you understand what I'm saying
[1:24:38] the devil wants to get a hold of any
[1:24:41] beautiful life and twist it up amen
[1:24:46] that's
[1:24:47] right the message is pure yes it is
[1:24:50] right on that's what God set for us to
[1:24:53] get ready but the devil wants to get in
[1:24:55] there and twist it just like he wants to
[1:24:58] get into our life and twist things
[1:25:01] up in the message three kinds of
[1:25:04] Believers brother Brandon says when the
[1:25:07] supernatural is displayed yes it
[1:25:11] produces three different
[1:25:14] types it did down in Egypt It produced
[1:25:17] the unbeliever the believer and the mate
[1:25:19] believer it did all three classes now
[1:25:22] what did he say he do this the
[1:25:24] supernatural yes the super the
[1:25:28] supernatural attracts it does but it
[1:25:31] doesn't make you a
[1:25:34] Believer it
[1:25:36] doesn't it just attracts you still who
[1:25:39] are you are that's right all right
[1:25:42] Hebrews chapter 3 verse 6 now we have to
[1:25:44] hurry because we were doing good with
[1:25:46] our time and we don't want to just all a
[1:25:48] sudden be behind
[1:25:52] again Hebrew chapter 3 verse
[1:25:58] 6 but Christ as a son over his own house
[1:26:03] Brother Bruce spoke on this a little bit
[1:26:07] in his message praise God who house we
[1:26:11] are If We Hold Fast the confidence and
[1:26:16] the rejoicing of Hope firm unto the End
[1:26:21] Amen so the children of Israel did not
[1:26:23] do that the 70 disciples that believed
[1:26:26] on Jesus in St John said they didn't do
[1:26:28] that they said look this is a hard
[1:26:30] saying I I who can who who can who can
[1:26:35] understand he didn't ask us to
[1:26:37] understand he asked us to believe it
[1:26:39] right understanding will come
[1:26:42] yes and then he goes on and he's trying
[1:26:45] to he's trying Paul or the the the
[1:26:48] writer here of Hebrews is trying to to
[1:26:51] take the the the situation that happened
[1:26:54] with with the children of Israel as a
[1:26:56] type of what happens in the believer's
[1:26:59] heart today he says wherefore as the
[1:27:01] Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear
[1:27:04] his voice Harden not your
[1:27:05] hearts as they did in the wilderness
[1:27:08] when your fathers tempted me prove me
[1:27:10] saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was
[1:27:12] grieved with that generation and said
[1:27:16] they do always air in their
[1:27:19] heart and they have not known my ways so
[1:27:23] there
[1:27:24] heart was didn't didn't want to
[1:27:28] believe they murmured they complained
[1:27:30] you know all the problems they had in
[1:27:33] there there was there was just murmuring
[1:27:36] and complaining about the church can you
[1:27:38] believe that yes sir they wanted to get
[1:27:40] rid of they wanted to get rid of the
[1:27:43] pastor they they wanted to get a
[1:27:45] different leader and go back you know
[1:27:48] Amen to Egypt I mean that just the truth
[1:27:50] of the matter amen because it was too
[1:27:53] hard for them just like these 70
[1:27:55] disciples said this is too hard who can
[1:27:57] hear this and they went and they started
[1:27:59] do you know those 70 disciples they went
[1:28:01] and they started following somebody else
[1:28:04] yeah they left the leader of life to
[1:28:07] follow something that was easier for
[1:28:09] their
[1:28:11] flesh amen so I swear in my wrath that
[1:28:13] they shall not enter my rest verse 12
[1:28:16] take
[1:28:16] heed Brethren take heed Brethren lest
[1:28:20] there be in any of you an evil heart of
[1:28:25] unbelief now he defines what unbelief is
[1:28:30] departing from the Living
[1:28:34] God it's okay to sit in a church that's
[1:28:37] dead that believes the same thing the
[1:28:41] same Creeds the same
[1:28:43] thing the same Dogma the same candle
[1:28:47] burning the same Rosary the same it's
[1:28:50] okay to do
[1:28:52] that but but don't believe in a living
[1:28:55] God true now a living God will speak to
[1:29:00] your heart
[1:29:03] amen because he's alive you're you're
[1:29:06] his son your
[1:29:09] daughter you're his bride he's speaking
[1:29:12] there's a relationship but he ain't
[1:29:14] going to speak to you through some
[1:29:17] worldly music some worldly television
[1:29:20] show some some worldly thing he speak
[1:29:24] speak to you through the word my sheep
[1:29:26] know my voice what's his voice it's his
[1:29:27] word so when the word is preached he's
[1:29:30] speaking that's a living
[1:29:33] God he's alive and well living in me to
[1:29:38] tell that's why we hunger for the living
[1:29:41] word amen amen if we go to the graveyard
[1:29:45] we're not going to see anyone that speak
[1:29:47] to
[1:29:49] us they're they're six feet
[1:29:52] under people will get get to a place
[1:29:55] where it's okay when God's not speaking
[1:29:57] to them about moving forward they're
[1:30:00] actually content with going to the
[1:30:02] church as long as they don't have to do
[1:30:06] nothing but you start having to you know
[1:30:09] do something well I'm feeling
[1:30:14] uncomfortable that is what it means
[1:30:17] depart from the Living God an evil heart
[1:30:21] of unbelief look at verse 13 but exort
[1:30:22] one another daily while is called day
[1:30:24] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:30:28] deceitfulness of
[1:30:30] sin what is the deceitfulness of
[1:30:34] sin it's real
[1:30:36] easy Satan
[1:30:38] says you don't really have to do
[1:30:41] that he that knoweth to do good and
[1:30:44] doeth it not to him it is sin that's the
[1:30:48] deceitfulness of sin you can still feel
[1:30:51] okay with not doing all the word there
[1:30:54] ought to be something inside the
[1:30:56] believer's heart that's hungering to
[1:30:59] fulfill all the word of God in their
[1:31:02] life if if they're if they're connected
[1:31:04] to God they really want to be what God
[1:31:07] wants them to be then they're interested
[1:31:10] in every word of God because Jesus said
[1:31:11] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:31:14] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:31:16] mouth of
[1:31:17] God and Jesus said in St John chapter 12
[1:31:20] he says uh he that doesn't believe in me
[1:31:23] it's it's okay I didn't come to judge
[1:31:25] anyone but but he that rejecteth me and
[1:31:28] the words that I have spoken the same
[1:31:30] shall judge him in the last day the word
[1:31:32] becomes important to the believer to the
[1:31:35] unbeliever is not that important are you
[1:31:38] with me because Satan has tricked them
[1:31:41] deceived them into thinking that what
[1:31:43] they do believe is good enough because
[1:31:45] they believe and they got
[1:31:47] baptized right he that believeth in is
[1:31:49] baptized shall be
[1:31:51] saved well why don't I need to believe
[1:31:54] anything else for then the deceitfulness
[1:31:57] of
[1:32:00] sin the real Believing on God is
[1:32:03] believing all the
[1:32:07] way God we just started the race so when
[1:32:10] God when God when Abraham believed God
[1:32:15] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:32:17] righteousness God called him to separate
[1:32:22] from the other unbelief right and this
[1:32:25] is the hardest thing I I think for us as
[1:32:28] as Believers in this message is that
[1:32:31] there's still a part that God is calling
[1:32:33] us to separate from if he had to do it
[1:32:35] from our father our our father of our
[1:32:37] faith why not the children of our father
[1:32:40] are you with me
[1:32:42] amen so we need to exhort one another
[1:32:47] daily that means I need you to tell me
[1:32:50] hey I need you to be living more the
[1:32:52] word that's what that
[1:32:56] means I I want to I want to get some
[1:32:58] phone calls I want to get some some
[1:33:00] taxes I want somebody to be caring about
[1:33:03] me and we need to care about one another
[1:33:06] we need to care about our spouses our
[1:33:08] children our parents we need to care one
[1:33:11] for
[1:33:12] another and not just well whatever it's
[1:33:15] really important now look at verse 14
[1:33:18] for we are made
[1:33:20] partakers of Christ if
[1:33:24] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[1:33:26] steadfast to the end we are not made
[1:33:29] partakers of Christ if we
[1:33:32] stop the 70 stopped they were no longer
[1:33:36] partakers the children of Israel they
[1:33:38] stopped they were no longer partakers
[1:33:41] Jesus said they're everyone dead they
[1:33:43] ate Mana yes they ate of that bread but
[1:33:46] they're everyone dead Jude tells us look
[1:33:49] after he saved them he destroyed them
[1:33:52] they weren't made part Aker so today we
[1:33:55] got to think about it's not about
[1:33:57] sitting in the church sitting in the
[1:33:59] message belonging to send the light that
[1:34:01] is not the answer that's
[1:34:05] right because brother bradam already
[1:34:07] said in every church is three types of
[1:34:10] Believers so we can't be looking at just
[1:34:13] being in the church is we're a Believer
[1:34:17] we've got to be looking am I lining up
[1:34:20] with all that God is speaking to me at
[1:34:22] the church amen amen and that takes a
[1:34:24] real honest to goodness sincere heart
[1:34:28] yes if my people which are called by my
[1:34:31] name amen shall humble themselves
[1:34:35] right it it takes a lord I got to know
[1:34:38] because there's a deceitfulness of sin
[1:34:40] that gets in there and the saint wants
[1:34:42] us to think that we're going to make the
[1:34:44] Rapture by just coming to church no
[1:34:46] we're going to make the Rapture by
[1:34:48] departing from all Darkness from
[1:34:50] departing from all Sin from becoming
[1:34:52] this word and believing be a believer
[1:34:54] that I can live more than I've been
[1:34:57] living I can become more of of of what
[1:35:00] Christ is I could literally have a
[1:35:03] desire to live for
[1:35:05] others and that's right you know these
[1:35:11] people were not made partakers of Christ
[1:35:14] we're not going to be joint heirs with
[1:35:15] Christ if we don't hold our confidence
[1:35:17] steadfast for the end so we've got to
[1:35:20] earnestly contend for the faith right
[1:35:24] all right verse 18:19 we got to hurry
[1:35:26] now cuz time
[1:35:28] is time is time is almost up I don't
[1:35:32] want to say time is up because I'll feel
[1:35:34] bad so I'll say time is almost
[1:35:38] up and to whom swear that he should that
[1:35:42] they should not enter into his rest they
[1:35:44] wouldn't be partakers of Christ but to
[1:35:47] them that believe not so we see then
[1:35:49] that they could not enter in because of
[1:35:51] unbelief they entertain that Spirit of
[1:35:54] just settling settling we don't have to
[1:35:57] go into the promised land we don't have
[1:35:58] to get serious about manifesting the
[1:36:00] Holy
[1:36:01] Ghost verse one of chapter 4 let us
[1:36:06] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[1:36:09] us of entering into his rest any of us
[1:36:12] should seem to come short of it for unto
[1:36:15] us was the Gospel preached as well as
[1:36:16] unto them but the word that was preached
[1:36:19] did not profit them because it wasn't
[1:36:22] mixed with faith
[1:36:24] they didn't earnestly contend for it
[1:36:27] they were settling for what they did
[1:36:30] believe they settled for what they did
[1:36:34] believe instead of saying I need to
[1:36:37] believe more
[1:36:39] yes this is
[1:36:41] such a severe threshold I believe for
[1:36:46] every one of us as we stare we look we
[1:36:49] search our lives and we look God was
[1:36:52] there anything that you were trying to
[1:36:54] tell me that I just kind of pushed aside
[1:36:57] didn't think it was that big a deal
[1:36:58] that's right right because you know God
[1:37:00] is not obligated to give us more light
[1:37:03] more Revelation if we don't walk in the
[1:37:06] one that we
[1:37:07] did and and if he's trying to take us to
[1:37:10] a
[1:37:13] place and we're you know we're just
[1:37:15] trying to sidestep something and get
[1:37:18] there it's not going to
[1:37:19] work because you're making God a fool
[1:37:22] for thinking you don't you don't have to
[1:37:23] do something he's asked you to do and
[1:37:25] you're going to bypass it some other way
[1:37:28] we've got to go God's way let's stand
[1:37:31] together you promise me you'll do me
[1:37:34] something when you get home today
[1:37:36] tomorrow sometime this week read Hebrews
[1:37:38] chapter 10 verses 22 through
[1:37:45] 38 and you know maybe we'll maybe we'll
[1:37:48] touch into that when we start part part
[1:37:51] two but it talks continues to talk about
[1:37:55] the
[1:37:56] unbeliever and how we need to be a
[1:38:00] believer and not draw back but to
[1:38:02] continue pressing on amen that's what
[1:38:05] separates the believer from the
[1:38:07] unbeliever they're both sitting in
[1:38:09] church they're both believing part of
[1:38:11] the word but only the believer believes
[1:38:14] all the word and not you know if I could
[1:38:17] say it like this the devil believes more
[1:38:19] of the word than a lot of people
[1:38:23] but he he doesn't submit to it he
[1:38:25] doesn't obey it he just mentally
[1:38:28] believes it so I'm interested in living
[1:38:32] I'm in interested in In Living the word
[1:38:34] of God Amen let's let's look to him in
[1:38:37] in prayer before we we sing Heavenly
[1:38:40] Father we thank you for sending your
[1:38:43] Prophet to speak things Lord that we
[1:38:47] would just never ever be able to come up
[1:38:51] with never be able to
[1:38:56] understand Lord we would be in total
[1:38:59] darkness but you sent a
[1:39:02] prophet and he preached things to where
[1:39:05] Lord not only we could understand them
[1:39:07] but Lord that that through these things
[1:39:10] that he preached like these these three
[1:39:12] types of Believers we know now how to
[1:39:14] strive to be the believer you want us to
[1:39:17] be we thank you for that Lord continue
[1:39:20] to open our eyes continue you to show us
[1:39:24] what things that we must
[1:39:27] do Lord help us to take heed L there' be
[1:39:31] inside of any of us a a a heart of of of
[1:39:35] of unbelief and departing from that that
[1:39:38] living
[1:39:39] voice speaking to us personally a on a
[1:39:43] regular basis father meet with us uh in
[1:39:46] the mornings and and when we spend time
[1:39:49] at home praying meet with us
[1:39:51] Lord and and and show us as your bride
[1:39:55] how we can be more in line with a
[1:39:59] complete believer father
[1:40:03] amen Lord if there's any any questions
[1:40:07] on your people's heart concerning the
