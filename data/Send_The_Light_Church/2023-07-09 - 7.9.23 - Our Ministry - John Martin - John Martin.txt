I'm Yours Lord amen God bless you this morning so good to be back in the house of the Lord we enjoyed the services when we were gone but it just nothing like being in the house of the Lord we had a chance to talk with brother Johnson yesterday and he uh he said indeed it it wasn't an infection that he had in his kidneys that was causing the problem it wasn't the kidney stones which he thought and he's uh they put him on an antibiotic and he's doing much better and he's uh tuning in this morning he said so we thank the Lord for the live stream amen amen um well if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with us to Second Corinthians chapter 5 and you know now nowadays you most scriptures that you choose they're a very well-known scripture because we we read the scriptures a lot and we love the scriptures I want to say thank you to each of you that have been prayed for us this week we we had a chance to get away and do nothing and we always enjoy that and uh when we can when we can amen um let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we We Begin here Heavenly Father we want to thank you for watching over us all the brain is here safely today that we could look to you the author and the finisher of our faith that we could express our Thanksgiving to you that one day you reach down your hand and you brought us up out of the world you changed our very desires our very nature to to love you to set our affections on things above to be full of interest to the things that you're interested in Lord father we thank you today for saving us and Lord we thank you for putting us on a right path the path that leads straight home and Lord we believe father that there is a group of people Lord that are going to make the rapture that are not going to to see death and father you've placed that hope within all of us and we thank you this morning that you have given us a message and a word that would help us to make ourselves ready father as we look into the word today we humbly pray this morning that Lord you would Place upon each of us the Revelation that we have need of for our individual lives wherever we are at in our walk with you knowing Lord that we're all in different levels as it were and you're dealing with us in different ways and but God you're able to take the message this morning and break it down individually what you'd have for each of us we pray today Lord there not be one that would be missing would would not a one that would would miss your voice speaking to them the direction for their lives we asked it Lord you'd meet all the needs that would be among us father May there be a faith in our heart just to claim whatever it is Lord that you've been uh you've burdened our heart with perhaps with just more of you more Holy Ghost an answer for a situation a healing in the body a Deliverance whatever it might be Lord you're able to make all grace abound to us father bless your word now and bless this remainder of this time as we commit ourselves into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 or actually I like to start with verse 14 I want to talk about our ministry and in particular finishing our ministry amen and Paul says it's the the love of Christ that constrains us showing us the mode of for this ministry because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that if he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him that died for them and rose again verse 17 wherefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature and the old things are passed away the old will the old living for themselves has passed away behold all things are become new in other words he's never experienced just doing the will of God Amen and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the ministry of restoration of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing the trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ said be reconciled to God amen amen God bless you you may be said aren't you glad that God did not impute your trespasses upon you amen sometimes when we're dealing with people who have problems we can't seem to get their problems out of our head and we want to bring it before them and really God didn't do that to us and I'm so glad today that his mercies are new each morning that no matter what that that God has a remedy to fix our relationship with him and to draw a relationship closer no matter how close we are with God I do believe there's something in God's heart that's wanting us to be closer to him amen yes sir amen and and we know we can't look at God as he's the fault of our relationship it has to be somewhere on our end and if we can just get quiet long enough and let him speak to us amen God bless brother stands good to see him I love when brothers and sisters press in amen amen I do now the most important part of our Sunday are every Sunday is when God speaks to us amen the most important part and and we ReSound back with a so be it Lord so be it whatever he says to us so be it because we rest in the word brother Branham says Faith's final resting place is in the word and so we long for the word personally to be spoken to us we all want God to speak to us on a personal lover because that's where faith comes from is when he speaks to us but oftentimes too many times we miss the Simplicity of God speaking to us sometimes he speaks to us so loud that it knocks us off our high horse and we know it was him and then sometimes it's so still and so quiet that we just miss it completely we don't recognize it but he's still speaking amen amen so if you want to connect more with God we just need to Simply put into practice what we hear come across the pulpit yes sir get rid of the diasecting get rid of you know if you have to figure out whether this thing is true or not you need to find a church that you agree with the word is the word I mean I certainly I wouldn't be welcome to to preach in the church that believes in the trinity it just doesn't connect right and so if you found your home church and you need to have confidence in the word being ministered to you amen I'd rather have a right mental attitude and obey the word of God that's being preached than to sit around and wait for the Revelation to come before I go decide to do it what's God going to honor the word ought to be the final resting place to every believer brother Brandon said in the message hear his voice he said this morning might be the time that you make up your mind whether you're going to listen to what the television says or what the paper says or what the theologians say or What God Says let me tell you as a people don't you listen to what anything says but What God Says wait on that still small voice and he will change you so what are we listening for the voice for what's the ultimate goal when we hear the not to get more knowledge not to feel better it's to be changed amen we come here to get changed and we can't get changed you know Anne's got that little quote back there's if it don't challenge you it won't change you and that's the truth because uh we live in such a complacency age okay brother Brandon goes on to say you say I like to believe brother Brian I wish I could believe I wish I could do certain things you can't why can't you you don't get quiet long enough you don't get into a place where the doubts are all gone in other words he's saying you won't take the time to prepare yourself right you know sometimes we we had this repetition I'm going to go to church I'm going to spend my 10 minutes on prayer and I'm going to go do this I'm going to do that and really it becomes a ritual right right and sometimes you got to pray for an hour right to get out of your flesh because you've been in there so long and sometimes you get on your knees and his presence just comes immediately right but we need to get out of the routine and get prepared if we really really want to believe amen he says when you enter into that place where the doubts have passed away he says then you're you'll be free and you can hear the voice of God speaking otherwise we're going to sit here a doubt is that was that brother John was that was that what we want to be in that place where his his voice is what we're hearing and then we can have faith to not just say Amen which we should say say Amen but our whole being should say Amen how many of us feel like we have a Ministry one two let me see them praise the Lord so we're we're speaking to those that got a Ministry this morning sometimes we can get distracted and even just consumed with our lives that we forget about our ministry I say don't ever get too saved that's true don't ever get over being saved don't lose your enthusiasm don't lose your excitement don't lose this I I'm so happy to be a Christian because when you you lose your joy the joy of the Lord is your strength when you lose it then you you don't even feel like working for the Lord we can sometimes revert back to just being in the flesh so this morning I just want you to know my motive what I'm trying to accomplish I want us to to reflect and possibly reconnect and recalibrate with our ministry as we reflect on our ministry I want us to think outside of these four walls because a lot of times we think our ministry is in the church right well this is what I do in the church I preach behind the pulpit I'm I'm preaching to me on that one because I preached men in public [Music] it's not what we do here right right that's that what that scripture is so I want us to think outside those of you that raise your hand want you to think outside of this building God isn't isolated to just this building he's really building his church outside amen his message was go ye out that was the message of the church so as we reflect I want to ask this question what is your ministry outside the church Define it what is it what do you do outside the church how's your ministry been going let's be honest has it been important enough to you you feel that it's you can stand here today and say yeah I've been putting in the time that is needed because I believe it's really really important or you can say on I I I really haven't maybe allocated enough time in a prayer or enough resources now look you may have ideas to do something but you don't got maybe the money to do it but I'm going to tell you this whatever God's given you give it to his kingdom that's all that he requires you to give but the thing is if you're you're not if you're not putting attention to your to to the ministry that God's given you we can maybe get so caught up in life so many problems and because also we got excuses of why we're not ministering right I've got this going on and that going on I got pressures from over here and this is happening before you know it that becomes priority true so maybe it's time to reconnect and and recalibrate with God's Ministry how many has received the new birth come on get these hand keep them up there I love it I love the waving I'll tell you why because I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of God it's the power of God under salvation when we become Born Again God gave each of us a Ministry when we became new creatures in Christ with the nature of God a different nature than we were born with all things in our life became of God and he gave each one of us the ministry of reconciliation now God doesn't give us all different Ministries we all have different gifts we might even have different callings but we all have we're all part of the ministry of reconciliation every one of us and we have been also given the responsibility of reconciling people to Christ remember Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the Bible says he had to self-made Ministry he wasn't born again and when Jesus asked him uh or over nicotines as Jesus you know you know how can we be born again how can these things be Jesus said our thou a master of Israel and you don't even know these things so this this this ministry has to do with being born again saying to you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God except there be a nature change we can't understand what what God is all about what heaven is all about brother Branham said in the message the reaction to the action he says no one will be in the Rapture without the Holy Ghost you can't even go in a Rapture without the Holy Ghost and brother Branham even said the Holy Ghost is the token that you've been pardoned that is so powerful to me Brother Bruce you know because we think part and all I got to do is believe get under the Bloods ask for forgiveness and it's done brother Brandon said when God gives you the Holy Ghost that's him accepting your faith amen right so in this age we got to have the Holy Ghost and I'm all for taking more time in seeking the Holy Ghost because I know it as clear as anything the devil tells every one of us we got enough Holy Ghost because he's bothered when you get done on your knees and you say God I need more of you that scares him right you could even be the weakest Christian and he'll tremble amen sometimes we're just so proud and think we're there Marvel not thy saying to you you must be born again everyone planning on going to heaven must be born again must have a nature Changers there's no get out of jail no free pass every man woman boy and girl must have a nature change and that nature change isn't from one weirdo to another weirdo right it ain't from acting you know what I'm saying our nature must become the nature of Christ each born-again believer receives a Ministry of reconciliation with this nature change there's no one that exempt every I don't care how old we are how young we are boy or girl we must work to reconcile others back to Christ if that's not happening we need to reconnect because we need to finish our ministry that God has given us a complete nature change unites us with God and his purpose his will and his purpose see the nature change just doesn't okay okay your Nature's change you're going to heaven now go do what you want to do no when you get the Holy Ghost you get the nature change it unites you with God's purpose if if I was going to call any one of you at your house and say look I want to come over tomorrow what are you doing I wouldn't know that answer until you told me this is what I'm doing tomorrow if you want to come along this is then I wouldn't know what your purpose is and when God gives you the Holy Ghost it's not to do your will it's not to do your thoughts it has nothing to do with this world it has to do with his eternal purpose and so God is not going to give you the Holy Ghost and then it's not going to unite you with his will just not going to happen right God predestinated us to work with him from the very beginning Ephesians chapter 1 verse 9. explains having made known unto us the mystery of his will it's a mystery according to the good pleasure which he have purposed in himself in other words he didn't get together with the angels and say what do you think about about doing this this was all God this is what he wanted it's about his ministry it's about his will it's about his purpose that in the dispensation of the fullness of times when it's all over he might gather together in one all things that are in Christ that are that are in that new nature that we just read about both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him God is working to get his family born again that's how we get there that's how we get into the Kingdom so we get Born Again by one Spirit we are baptized into the body and so we need to be you know we we see others who are struggle and got problems and this is going on and that's going on you know we need to encourage people to get more Holy Ghost because that is the only thing that's going to set them where they need to be it's God in them not them on the outside looking for advices on what to do to help them with their their walk with God no we don't need that we need God on the inside he's able to direct your path verse 11. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance praise God being predestinated praise God we're predestinated not just to go to heaven but according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will now you tell me in those scriptures where are you in those scriptures where where is your will in those scriptures where's your plans in those scriptures where is your your goals and what's your it's all about him the only part that you is falling in line with his purpose it is only Satan that's trying to get you in all these other things all these other distractions see God's nature unites with unites us with his will and his eternal purpose that's what the Holy Ghost will do for you it'll it'll unite you with him so imagine today that um uh you know brother Ron say you know let's just say brother Ron last service he gets up here and he's he's speaking about uh something that is a little off the wall shall we say a little different brother brother Mark gets up here and he ministers that's a little bit off the wall the other way I get up here nice be something a little bit off the wall the other way well that's nothing going to be but a bunch of confusion for our church and you're going to try to figure out what's what the Holy Ghost in you will do the same thing it did in Jesus it'll be the same purpose see the thing is we we let the devil interpret to us what God's Ministry is for our life completely wrong we got black and white what our ministry is there's no if ands buts about it what we should be doing how could we have the spirit of God and his nature and not carry out his purpose right I'll say it like this impossible over a long period of time it's impossible short period yes we all drift and do things like that but I'll tell you we need to reconnect recalibrate and and focus and finish the ministry that God has given us it's the proof in the pudding right when we're doing his will now if we fall more in love with him and his will then there is a promise in the scripture that things are going to work out for our favor but we've we've got to love him and be called according to his purpose if you leave one of those out of there you're in trouble Romans 8 28 says and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are are the called according to his purpose now I'm just gonna again take a couple examples and and I I I want to say I'm just going to think Mark and me but we can take Bob and Jim and and Bob is one sold out believer he has given himself over to the Holy Ghost Jim on the other hand he comes to church Faithfully but he still works his own will in his life now which one has been called according to God's purpose that's a question you're supposed to answer that one who Bob all right you're paying attention in class okay see we we got to make sure we gotta make our calling and election sure we got to make sure that we're called according to his purpose and not just doing a little bit here and a little bit there and feel that we're part of that no no if you really want all things to work together for the good you got to give them all that's what that love affair is his purpose remember his purpose is to gather together in one all things in Christ gather together in all in one all things in our Christ so you just take a look at your last week and and how much of your time has been looking for those to gather them into one because I'm just I'm just cutting through the taste this is his purpose now we could we can make his ministry something different well I'm just going to do this and I feel to do that if it don't come under the umbrella of gathering together all things in one in Christ then we're out of we're out of his purpose we've manufactured a different purpose both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so when did our ministry start we've been predestinated to this ministry must have been in the mind of God I don't think God saved some of us to just take it easy right work on our own careers kind of soothe In Sail in and as that song goes a bed of ease and others sail through bloody Seas when Jesus called us this ministry was on his mind when Jesus called Peter he said follow me and I'll make you Fishers of Men got you know right to the chase right there at the beginning of the call the ministry was right there and I love the attitude of Peter there was no debating there was no discussing how hard it was going to be there was no discussing of the benefits there was no way you please tell me first what's going to go on and then I'll you know make a decision no right amen because something connected on the inside there was didn't have to persuade on the outside something on the inside they straight away left their Nets and followed that was it it was the same with James and John no Jesus didn't want to say them and and just set up some prosperous career for them the mind of Christ was to use them in the ministry to help other Souls come to him yes sir that's where God you know God is the same yesterday to him forever people change times change fads change churches change pastors change but God don't change God is the same yesterday today and forever we have an absolute here and I'll tell you this word is exciting to me because when the Devil comes with all this other stuff going on it's real easy to know what the truth is [Music] but if the devil can separate you from the word from the love of the word then you're easy to get tripped up now Jesus taught them and he discipled them all 12 of his disciples and I'll say what a teacher they had what a teacher we have in Jesus today amen he's he's he's here teaching and then he equipped them he equipped them he's he he sent them out two by two and the Bible says that they were able to heal all manner of diseases and he gave them a power but you know they were just getting started their Ministry was actually mixed with their flesh you can say Amen to it they were rejoicing because the Devils were subject to it can you imagine they just thought it was really cool they fought and they bragged about who was the best among them there were times they didn't even realize they didn't have the right spirit and when Peter promised to finish his ministry that he would even die with this ministry he turned away he cursed denied and followed Jesus from afar didn't want to get too close to the word like some of us hey we need to stop playing church and we need to start uniting amen we need to start uniting and the only way to do that is crucify the flesh see Peter's nature wasn't completely changed all things were not of God his ministry was mixed the disciples Ministry was mixed that's why they all forsook them it wasn't until after they got the Holy Ghost that they stayed with him said it in the message all the days of our life he said I trust that the church will understand this that we have no right to use our own thinking about things when we become Christians we totally surrender every bit of our mental powers to God and to follow after his leading amen and as long as we try to go after our own feeling then we are using the Fallen state of the being right do you see how you can mix yourself with the ministry and the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness brother Brown said it's the Simplicity of the Gospel that staggers the people it's because they're always looking for something great like I want you to take for a moment maybe two or three ministers that you thought were just the greatest ministers you uh that you've ever seen and how they made you feel and and to think that yes that's God I say is God and you would tell anybody that was God and anything underneath that is questionable as if God only has that and I think that's where it staggers a lot of people he says they try to make it a great intellectual something another when it's the simpleness but God takes the very tool of humility weakness and simplicity to work his works with that's what he uses he said that's only a tool in God's hand God is looking for humility and weakness and simplicity I guess there's just no room for me and that that's a good Revelation to have there's no room for us there's no room for us we got to get out of it now after Jesus had resurrected and Peter was wanting to know the future of John and Jesus responded with a question he says what is it to you what's going to happen to John it is none of your beeswax none of your business Peter Focus focus on your ministry follow me right God is not even interested in what we think about one another [Music] if we could spend our effort in getting serious with God and following the the very same word two words that he uses at the end right before he leaves is to say words that you still when he called them and you know Peter's life kind of went like this and it takes the Holy Ghost to keep us on track [Music] a man at his very best is all vanity you know we could say oh yeah I'm serving God I'm doing this and you know next day we're off doing our own thing we can't make it without the Holy Ghost now let me just say this we know repentance is a part of the Holy Ghost right Godly sorrow worketh Patton's it's God dealing with somebody's heart we know that if a man repents and God forgives him he justifies him that is a work of the Holy Ghost it's the same thing as sanctification amen we can't look at those things and say we've got the Holy Ghost you got to look at your life with this word and say is my life living this word it just got to be that way because if you don't do that you're going to let the devil lie to you because when you come here you do not hear a Ministry that says take it easy you got it you already got it take it easy you won't hear that I don't hear that I can listen to the tapes all day and I don't hear I got it take it easy you're in the message I hear I got a dig I hear something every time I when I pick up that word and I read I think oh my Lord help me I need more of the Holy Ghost I hope you feel the same way the original Ministry that God called the disciples to was to be Fishers of Men but they weren't new creatures yet so when he called them to be Fishers of Men he had in his mind that they had to become new creatures that they had to get filled with his spirit that the way they looked at things how they responded to problems right I'm going to tell you that was really that was it how they responded surprised you know brother Brian says it's not the action but the reaction anybody can sit here and say what's right what's wrong but who can handle a problem the right way amen that's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and that's what they didn't have it takes a nature change and Jesus reminds them of the original calling just before he leaves with the Great Commission in Matthew 28 19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost well brother John I can't I can't go to another Nation but you can go on vacation [Laughter] it's all about purpose it's all about heart teaching all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you well isn't that personal what God tells me it's for me it's not for everybody else Jesus said what I have spoken to you what to observe what to live by you got to tell others yeah God can come and he can speak to anybody but he has you're in him so when you speak it it's really him right it's really him but people don't see it because of that Veil flesh teaching them to observe all things whatsoever command did you and lo I am with you always amen even to the end of the world now think about this the disciples did not live to the end of the world so was Jesus speaking to them or was he speaking to us because we're closer to the end than they were right I if I read this scripture correctly I feel I have this responsibility I had this responsibility to share Christ with others now look my flesh don't want to do your flesh don't want to do you know what our flesh want to do one to lay in bed today that's what our flesh wanted to do but we're not here to talk about our flesh we're really here to hear from God and it's not so much just we're coming to hear the truth but the truth has got to it's got to do something in our hearts there's got to be a connection there God gives every man and woman a part of the ministry of reconciliation to restore The Souls of other men and other women and other children back to God teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you amen but wait to the Holy Ghost comes wait till you're in do with power from on high spend more time in prayer and get more of the Holy Ghost don't try to do it in the flesh amen acts 1 8 says but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you right so what what do I do after I get that power do I rejoice that the demons are subject do I say that I'm better than so and so no ye shall be Witnesses unto me wherever you're at wherever you're at amen you're a witness you're no longer you you're Christ in a different body what an honor what a privilege God used me wherever I am I'll praise Him wherever I am I'll be a witness a witness the Holy Ghost is the only thing that can equip us what sharing Christ during adversity amen because if we're only going to share Christ when there's no adversity we don't need the Holy Ghost we don't hey when things are going your way you can do about anything when the money's coming in the popularity is there the friends are there you know everybody's patent you on the back hey share Christ but go through some adversity we'll find out what's really in the tea bag and the Holy Ghost is the only thing that can equip us with being able to witness Christ properly while going through adversity I believe that with all my heart when God gives us the Holy Ghost this ministry of reconciliation is attached to the Holy Ghost it's just like the word and the spirit of the word or the word and the Holy Ghost is the same amen not the dead letter part but the spirit of the word which is the same thing there's no confusion one is alive and one is dead all right the Holy Ghost equips us to do the ministering in other words he makes you and I able ministers not ourselves we can't do it but he does it and you just write these two scriptures down I don't know if I'll have time I will not have time to go through them so you write these down second Corinthians chapter 6 verses 1 through 10 second Corinthians chapter 6 verses 1 through 10 second Corinthians chapter four 7-15 second Corinthians chapter 4 7-15 now this is a this is really describing about us being able ministers it's really not talking about finishing the ministry because that's what this message is but that really helps you to understand how you should be ministering second Corinthians 3 5 tells us not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit give her life you ever go up to somebody and just tell them like it is what did you do when you did that killed it you killed the opportunity to help right amen that would be okay if it was really God and he was condemning the person but it's usually not God is full of Mercy he has so much Mercy you I had one guy come into our shop one time and he was trying to sell himself wanted a job with us he says I can run that computer so fast it'll make your head spin God has so much Mercy to make your head spin that's what I got to say you know but for some reason we only exercise and when we do exercise it it's only to those we feel are granted Worthy and that's a representation of Christ me brother Brian said in the message Witnesses 53 he says you know I say this now with all respect it isn't our city full of boot leg joints that's hurting us we could fill in the blank with a lot of evil stuff going on here's what's hurting us more than ever is people who are professing to be Christians and not living it that's the thing see they're not a correct Witness well the Holy Ghost is what makes us correct Witnesses they can't witness until they've had the experience and when they have an experience then they can become a witness automatically because they are born again and all the things of the world the old things have passed away and all the and all things have become new then you become a witness unto Jesus Jesus knew before these Apostles could ever go out and be a correct witness that they had to experience what they were witnessing about you can't say it any planer than that that's right that is it in a nutshell we need more of the Holy Ghost so much that it don't matter what's happening to us what we come in contact we're still living the life we we've gotten to the place where we can love everyone we've gotten to the place where we can lay it on our life and live for others the Holy Ghost unites us with the mind of God the mind of God and it puts us in harmony with his purpose which is to reach out to others we're being consumed in our own lives we're forgetting about the ministry that Christ gave us we need to work in harmony with the Holy Ghost and only the holy the holy spirit inside of us is going to know the correct Harmony the Bible says we're workers together with him with him in the message oncoming storm brother Brandon says therefore when you are born from above you have the Holy Spirit coming down from God that changes your nature you know this whole message is interwoven with a changed nature and I don't understand how the how so many people in the message can read the message and there's no concern about the change come on he says no matter your sister your mother your best friend could be dressed that way but the Christian that's born of the spirit of God he's born from above and their spirit is of another kingdom so here we are he we that are born again we intertwine and we in we we're involved with other people who have not been born again and they're family members are you with me so no matter what our spirit has to represent Christ how else are they gonna how else are we going to help them no chance of helping them if you're going to be double-sided you got to be a beacon gotta be a lighthouse gotta Shine the Light let's go back to our opening scripture here mine time flies when you're having fun all right second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 If any man be in Christ he is a new Witness old witnessing has passed away behold all witnessing becomes new and all witnessing is of God who have reconciled us unto Jesus unto us by Jesus Christ now unto himself by Jesus Christ I want to I looked up that word reconciled right there in the Greek what that meant you know what it means it means to change mutually to change mutually now you know Amanda's very best is Vanity he can't do nothing but we have to unite with God we have to say God I am so sick of myself I want you to come in and change my nature and you know it takes sometimes no it takes most times more than just asking it once or twice if you want something bad enough you'll go to extremes right right like you know if you ever had to do a greenhouse it could take years to do if you're doing it by yourself it can take a long time and sometimes we want a nature change but you know we give God an hour Sunday maybe an hour and a half on Wednesday sometimes we're gonna come on Wednesdays and we want God to do something in our life what do you want to do because he's serious about a relationship he's serious about the nature change and he can't do it all by his will because his will that the whole world will be saved his will that everybody's nature would be changed but he can't do it you have to combine with God's will you have to say Lord I willingly not my will but thy will be done I give up my own will for your will and then God begins to reconcile you to him and that is the same process he uses in your ministry with others how many times are you trying to help people they don't want to listen I'm not saying that Christ in you is going to make everybody turn out right but I will tell you Christ in you will become a correct Witness and those that are ordained will come right that's just scriptural all right and notice the big word and in verse 18 and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation the ministry you know what that is that you looked that word up it is attendance as a servant amen you now are a servant you're no longer who you think you are you're just you're just a little old servant that's all you are we don't want to think of ourselves as anything right and God can't use a tough shirt so the little or more littler you can get the more God wants to use you reconciliation that word reconciliation restoration is the action of returning something to a former owner place or condition so here you are you're going out to some devil possessed person nowadays you just look about everybody and you say you you you just are they are they possessed it's how bad it's getting the world's going insane brother Brandon said but our job is to re to restore them to the former owner which we don't know if that's Christ we don't because but we're instructed to become all things to all men that we might win some of them to the original owner which is Christ praise the Lord to wit to wit to wit in the manner that God was in Christ he reconciled the world in himself not reputing their trespasses imputing their trespasses on them and is committed and unjust the word of reconciliation so now what what what Christ did for the world Christ does in US individually to others no different he's given us the word the same word that he preached the same word right here this word is the only thing that can save somebody my word ain't going to save anybody God's word is the only thing that can reconcile man back to God now then we are ambassadors in other words we act as a representative a true witness for Christ as though God did beseech you uh by us notice that when you're speaking to other people about their souls that's God in you beseeching them to to come to Christ and we pray you in Christ said that ye be reconciled and just join the ministry join the ministry we who are born again have been born again to a responsibility to carry out this this ministry we read that it's it's the love of God he sheds it abroad uh it's in her heart and it constrains us it puts us out yonder to to win souls for Christ it's his love inside of us that pushes us out to do this ministry look you know I can see what brother Brandon was saying he says we need to pinch our conscience we need to do something that this word does something in her life because to sit here and hear this word and not be moved you're in a worse condition than I would imagine the word needs to move us not some action not some being just you know I could get up here this is true I could get up here and I could Minister without notes I couldn't Minister like this but I could but that would not make it any more God than what it is right now that word was still anointed I had a week for this word praise the Lord all right so I'm not going to be able to finish this but that's okay it's okay maybe we'll just we'll continue instead of pushing it I don't want to push it wait I mean you got to the part of finishing our ministry we have a Ministry but we got to finish it and and God clear as anything you know when God speaks to you God wants us to finish the Ministries given to us keep on keep on sharing Christ all the things that are are standing in your way the busyness the distractions the excuses don't let them become the thing that makes us unfaithful to the ministry that God's given us you know what happened to Paul I'll just I don't know if I'll have a chance to to share to do this I don't know the will of the Lord honestly for for Wednesday but you know Paul Paul was viewed at by other ministers as a weak speaker he was looked at one this is all in the scripture it's hid but it's there that they looked at Paul as someone who didn't want to have confrontation with others he didn't go into debating with others and so the other ministers kind of looked down on Paul thinking about this he's the he wrote 14 books he's the one that God chose he was the prophet of that age and he got other ministers during his time preaching Jesus that were looking down on him in a negative way so Paul he goes to compare himself with other ministers and he compares of of all his sufferings to bring Christ to others that's what he uses for comparison with with all the other ministers this is I labor more and I'm go to prison more I die more I'm Shipwrecked more and he uses this as his proof of his ministry not how great he can speak Paul wasn't a great speaker or uh Moses wasn't a great speaker God chooses the weakness where he can show forth his glory see you know Saints this is what's important it's important that you remain a witness in the middle of your trial because people are watching your life are you going to get offended when they slap you or are you going to turn the other cheek if someone asks you to go one mile are you gonna say again or will you go two because this is the ministry it may not be what we want it to be but it's the ministry and he's called us to finish it let's Stand Together God bless you this morning one place Paul said none of these things moved me so I may finish the ministry in which he called me amen he was so focused on that Ministry and Saints we need to if I could just ask a request that we could just spend a little bit of time maybe today talking to one another about the ministry that God has given us and to make sure that we're finishing it let it be part of the conversation give God a chance to let this word deal with us amen because I really believe it's him amen it's him um Because He Lives amen Because He Lives because [Music] does he lived I can face tomorrow because he lives all fear is gone cause I know he holds my future and life is worth the Living Just Because He Lives Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow Because He Lives all fear is gone because I know he holds my future and life is worth the Living Just Because He Lives Because He Lives I can face tomorrow I can see passing in this he'll live all fear is gone because I know he holds my future and life is worth the Living Just Because He Lives is more of you more of you I've had it all but what I need is just more of you of things I've had my fear and yet I hunger still [Music] hear our prayer for more of you foreign [Music] [Music] Lord hear my prayer for more of you more of you amen he's promised to fill the hungry more of you I've had it all but what I need just more of you of things I've had my fear and yet I hunger still empty and bare Lord hear my prayer for more of you amen is my wife continues to play that real quietly maybe we could just all ow our heads and close our eyes for just a few moments before we go to him in prayer [Music] now I just wonder if there's anyone here today that really feels you've let the bars down on your ministry you know what you he's called you to do but you've just let the bars down [Music] no my my mind goes and we've all seen it we've all seen people who've lost their their legs or their arms or some some horrible thing accident happened in their life and they're left without the ability to to run and and do things that they used to do but somehow they'll they'll sit up there and and give a speech that will just bring such conviction to you and they have such an attitude of really doing something with their life even though they're missing part of their body [Music] and here we are today with arms and legs and the sound mind and time God's given us time and he's given us all gifts and I just wonder today have we really been given ourself for his purpose wants us to finish this ministry from where the where the last leg before he comes we've got to reach those that are yet to come in we've got to share this burden with Christ pray with me
