[18:17] our guest I guess this morning. This is
[18:21] um my wife's twins
[18:25] daughter Tabby. So she's from
[18:28] Washington. So she came a long way. We
[18:32] think we came a long way. She came all
[18:34] the way from Washington. So we just want
[18:37] to invite her and by God's spirit in her
[18:40] heart this morning. Amen. Well, God's
[18:43] the same yesterday, today, and forever
[18:46] all around the world, you know. So, it's
[18:49] just not in our little town here, but
[18:52] he's just saying. Amen. So, let's just
[18:54] remember also, let's remember our
[18:56] brother Orlando. He's asking for prayer
[18:59] for his uh upcoming eye surgery on
[19:01] Tuesday. So,
[19:05] you know,
[19:07] we're just so thankful for our brother
[19:09] and and for our also our sister Bertha
[19:12] this morning that they, you know, a lot
[19:14] of people drive a long ways to come and
[19:18] it shows you
[19:20] that
[19:22] there's no,
[19:25] you know, there's no greater price than
[19:26] truth. So, so when you know the truth,
[19:33] nothing else will satisfy you. So,
[19:38] Lord, let's just remember our sister
[19:39] Elizabeth. I don't know what's going on
[19:41] with her, but we just pray the Lord
[19:43] would just uh comfort her and guide her
[19:46] and
[19:48] uh take away any pain that she would
[19:50] have. And uh you know, we all have that
[19:54] eternal day waiting for us. and uh you
[19:59] can't run away from it.
[20:02] It's going to be there. So, we just pray
[20:03] for her. We pray for everybody else
[20:05] that's not here, anybody that's sick. Um
[20:11] yes, let's just uh remember somebody in
[20:13] prayer this morning and just lift them
[20:15] up before the Lord. Uh remember there's
[20:18] calendars out there, so let's grab a
[20:20] couple calendars. Uh give them to
[20:22] somebody this year. I'm sure that uh
[20:25] there's plenty of people that need that.
[20:28] And uh let's just remember all the
[20:31] missionaries throughout the world. Uh
[20:33] let's remember to just pray one for
[20:35] another and lifting each other up in
[20:38] prayer for we're all going through
[20:40] something.
[20:41] We may maybe we I don't know what you're
[20:44] going through, but
[20:46] God does.
[20:48] and he says, uh, you know,
[20:53] just seek him and he'll give you
[20:54] something to pray for. That's for sure.
[20:56] So, let's just remember that. Let's
[20:58] remember, uh, Sister Cheryl's dad and
[21:02] and mother and her new place. We pray
[21:06] that that's going good and, uh, they
[21:09] find comfort in that. So, let's just
[21:11] stand this morning. If anybody would
[21:13] have something else on their heart, just
[21:15] lift it before the Lord this morning.
[21:17] Let's remember our our sister Trish. I
[21:20] don't see her this morning. And brother
[21:22] James and uh our brother Roger, many
[21:26] more that might should be here and it's
[21:28] not. So that's our our brother uh Keith
[21:31] and sister Linda Beckman. Amen. So let's
[21:35] just remember them in prayer this
[21:37] morning. Let's just pray for our pastor
[21:39] one another to receive the word this
[21:41] morning as as God would have it in the
[21:44] name of Jesus. Amen. Let's just go forth
[21:46] one another. Amen. Dear heavenly father,
[21:48] Lord, as we come before you, Lord, this
[21:50] morning, Lord, there's many things that
[21:52] would be on our hearts, Lord, but none
[21:54] greater than just a a deeper walk with
[21:57] you, Lord God. For Lord, all these
[22:00] things of the world don't matter.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; So Lord, as we come to you this morning,
[22:06] Lord, we come to you with faith, Lord,
[22:08] knowing that you're the one that called
[22:10] us, Lord. It wasn't Lord we were just in
[22:14] sin and Lord you just came to us on that
[22:16] day Lord and expressed your love to us
[22:19] Lord and Lord as you gave us a pardon at
[22:22] Calvary Lord and we accepted it Lord we
[22:26] started our journey with you Lord but
[22:28] Lord it's not those that start the race
[22:30] but it's those that finish it Lord so
[22:33] let us press on to the mark of the high
[22:35] calling Lord let us believe the word as
[22:38] it would come forth Lord let it change
[22:40] our hearts change our souls, Lord God,
[22:43] that Lord, we might draw closer to you
[22:45] by the end of the service, Lord, that we
[22:48] could say to one another, Lord, did you
[22:50] did you hear that? Did you see that,
[22:52] Lord? Did you Oh, Lord, I feel so much
[22:55] closer to you, Lord God. Or, Lord, we
[22:58] just believe in the word, Lord. And we
[23:00] believe that you're going to draw us,
[23:02] Lord, by it, Lord, this morning, Lord.
[23:05] We pray for our pastor, brother John,
[23:07] Lord, that you would just, Lord, just
[23:10] Lord, just speak to him, Lord, as you
[23:12] have for this word that's coming forth,
[23:14] Lord, and that I might be anointed for
[23:17] our ears, Lord. Give us a Lord, a heart
[23:20] of thanksgiving, Lord, to receive it,
[23:22] Lord, this morning. And we'll be glad
[23:24] and ever so thankful for it in the
[23:26] precious name of our Lord and Savior

[32:32] Amen. I think it's a good place to be
[32:36] uh here today if we're weak
[32:39] &gt;&gt; to become strong in the presence of God.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I don't know any greater
[32:45] thing that can make us strong than the
[32:48] word of God because it is the strongest
[32:50] thing.
[32:51] And we're going to be reading some
[32:53] quotes today where brother said he gave
[32:55] us his word uh to protect us.
[33:00] And uh he sent his word to heal us. His
[33:03] word is everything to us. And we want to
[33:06] talk about planting that word in our
[33:08] heart today. And I I believe it'll be a
[33:11] a service that we all could benefit
[33:13] from. Let's look to the Lord in a word
[33:15] of prayer. I want to say as brother Ron
[33:17] did, God bless Tabby today for coming.
[33:20] May the Lord bless you. Amen. Let's bow
[33:23] our heads in a word of prayer. Our
[33:25] heavenly father,
[33:28] we deem it a privilege to be in your
[33:31] house, Lord.
[33:33] Lord, thank you for calling us
[33:38] to be yours.
[33:41] One day we had no desire for you. We
[33:45] didn't want to know about you. We were
[33:49] uh doing our own thing and happy doing
[33:51] it. One day you you came by and
[33:57] you let us know Lord that
[34:00] we belong to you and that the condition
[34:02] that we were in, we wouldn't make it.
[34:06] And so Lord, we thank you for for
[34:09] changing our hearts
[34:12] and revealing yourself to us and calling
[34:16] us
[34:17] with a holy calling to to be your bride
[34:22] to be that special lady, that elect lady
[34:26] without spot, without wrinkle. Lord, we
[34:30] know that you're calling us, drawing us.
[34:33] For you said, "When
[34:35] the Holy Ghost comes,
[34:38] he will lead and guide you into all
[34:39] truth."
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're thankful for the truth that
[34:42] we do have, the truth that we're living,
[34:45] the truth that we believe.
[34:47] We know, Lord, that there is more for
[34:50] us. For Paul said, I'm pressing towards
[34:53] that mark
[34:55] &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling. Our
[34:58] hearts, Lord, we're we want to press
[35:00] into it today. We ask that you would
[35:02] take away any spirit of of doubt, of
[35:05] unbelief, any tiredness, any lefery, any
[35:08] lukewarm leodysia, anything that would
[35:11] keep us from pressing in as we ought to,
[35:13] Lord.
[35:15] And may the word become alive to us.
[35:17] Just bless this little thought, Lord,
[35:19] today,
[35:21] Lord. We ask that you'd be with each one
[35:24] uh that isn't here uh that's in the live
[35:27] stream today.
[35:29] Lord, they have needs in their homes.
[35:31] Their heads are bowed. They're praying.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; God, may you touch them. May you meet
[35:36] every need. And may you bless us all,
[35:40] Lord, as we press in to thee. We love
[35:43] you. We thank you for that. As we wait
[35:45] further upon thee here now, in Jesus
[35:48] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Turn with me if
[35:53] you would to the book of Genesis where
[35:55] it all started. Genesis chapter 1.
[36:01] Jesus did say, "Men shall not live by
[36:04] bread alone, but by every word that
[36:05] proceeds out of the mouth of God."
[36:08] &gt;&gt; And the word is the most important thing
[36:10] to the Christian.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 1, we're going to read
[36:15] two verses there, verses 11
[36:18] and 12.
[36:22] And God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[36:26] grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
[36:30] fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[36:32] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[36:35] earth. And it was so." It was so because
[36:39] God spoke it. Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; And the earth brought forth grass and
[36:44] herb yielding seed after his kind, and
[36:48] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[36:50] in itself
[36:52] after his kind. And God saw that it was
[36:55] good. Amen. God bless you. May be
[36:57] seated.
[36:59] So everything that God created, he
[37:01] placed a seed in it with the ability to
[37:05] reproduce itself. Right.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; There was nothing that God created that
[37:10] one time you planted it and it was a
[37:13] tomato and the next time you planted it,
[37:15] it was an olive.
[37:18] God is not the author of confusion. He's
[37:20] not the author of well, I wonder what's
[37:23] going to happen if I plant this. We know
[37:26] that every seed comes forth of its own
[37:29] kind. If you ever bought a a carrots in
[37:33] seed form and you planted them and they
[37:35] came forth lettuce, that means they put
[37:38] the wrong seeds in the package,
[37:41] &gt;&gt; right? Because we know whatever God
[37:44] created, that seed is going to come
[37:47] forth.
[37:49] Uh so when God created the the herbs,
[37:52] the grasses, the bushes, the trees, the
[37:54] creeping things, the fishes, the whales,
[37:56] the birds, the horses, the bears, and
[37:58] humans, inside every one of them was a
[38:01] sea to reproduce itself.
[38:05] And in Genesis 1 26, and God said, "Let
[38:09] us make man in our image after our
[38:14] likeness, and let them have dominion
[38:16] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[38:18] fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
[38:19] and over all the earth, and over every
[38:21] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[38:23] earth." So God created man in his own
[38:27] image, in the image of God, created he
[38:29] him, male and female created he them.
[38:33] And we know when God first created Adam,
[38:36] he created Eve inside of Adam at that
[38:38] time because the Bible says um he called
[38:42] Adam and Eve. He called them both Adam,
[38:45] right? And then he took a part of Eve
[38:48] out and formed a body. And um that was
[38:52] the feminist part of of Adam. And they
[38:56] just a perfect type of uh us coming out
[39:00] of Christ that he could uh have love and
[39:04] fellowship with us. Amen. In a more uh
[39:08] beautiful way. So in all the creatures
[39:11] that God created, none of them were
[39:14] created in the image of God except man.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; And before Adam fell, he was in the same
[39:24] image of God. If we can think about
[39:26] this, he had the same attributes of God.
[39:28] He was immortal. He was divine. He was
[39:32] eternal. He possessed the spoken word.
[39:35] Everything that Adam did was good. Just
[39:38] like everything that God did was good.
[39:40] Everything that Adam did was good
[39:42] because he was in the same image. Adam
[39:44] was faithful. He was full of joy and
[39:47] peace. He loved like God loved. He loved
[39:50] Eve so much that he was willing to give
[39:52] up his life for her just like Christ did
[39:54] for us at Calvary. So Adam was a
[39:58] wordborn
[40:00] son
[40:03] &gt;&gt; because God is the word.
[40:05] And so uh it was Adam. Adam was the
[40:11] spoken word of God for he was created in
[40:14] the same image of his invisible father.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; So it's hard to to really imagine or
[40:24] depict what Adam was really like. Of
[40:28] course, the message uh talks about some
[40:31] of those things,
[40:33] but
[40:35] um when we look at Jesus Christ, we see
[40:39] that he was in the image of the
[40:40] invisible God as well.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; And he was a perfect son. And if I could
[40:46] just say this, Adam was absolutely he
[40:49] was in an exact image because he was the
[40:53] seed of God and every seed brings forth
[40:55] of its own kind. So, I have a number of
[40:57] quotes today that I'm going to read and
[40:59] I hope this will be okay. Um, the the
[41:04] sometimes it's not as entertaining, but
[41:06] here's the thing. It's a really good
[41:08] teaching on planting the word in our
[41:09] heart. Abraham said questions and
[41:12] answers on the seal. He says, "And we
[41:14] always follow the nature of our parent."
[41:18] You know that look at the baby, the
[41:20] nature. Well, then Adam was the son of
[41:23] God. Eve was a daughter of God, right?
[41:25] the first thing of the creation of God
[41:29] which could not have one speck of evil
[41:32] anywhere about it. Evil wasn't even
[41:35] known at the time.
[41:38] Evil wasn't even known at the time. So,
[41:40] Adam was just perfect. You know, when we
[41:42] look at one another, we see faults and
[41:45] and things in one another's life. And
[41:48] Adam didn't have any.
[41:52] In the message fundamental foundation
[41:54] for faith says now God when he made man
[41:56] in the beginning he made him superior to
[41:58] everything on the earth. He gave him
[42:00] jurisdiction of everything on the earth.
[42:02] He could control everything. He could
[42:04] control the animal life. He could
[42:06] control the foul life, the fishes of the
[42:08] sea. He controlled the winds. He
[42:10] controlled the plant life. He controlled
[42:12] everything. Man was made as a secondary
[42:14] God on earth. He gave the power to
[42:17] control all things, all elements of the
[42:19] earth. That was Adam. And Adam could
[42:22] speak to the winds and it would stop. He
[42:24] could speak to the trees and they would
[42:26] obey him. He could speak to the
[42:28] wildlife. It would obey him. He could
[42:30] speak to the water. Uh ever what it was,
[42:34] everything obeyed Adam. So it's showing
[42:37] us that Adam was truly in the image of
[42:41] God.
[42:43] In Satan's Eden, brother Brandon
[42:44] speaking of the Garden of Eden. He said
[42:46] it was a beautiful place. There was
[42:48] nothing like it. Great paradise of God
[42:50] and the great dinosaurs and whatever
[42:53] more crawling through it and the great
[42:55] animals. No harm in them. They were just
[42:59] as gentle as a little kitten. They had
[43:02] nothing at all. No sickness, no sorrow,
[43:04] no disease, no germ on the earth. Now we
[43:06] fight germs all the time.
[43:09] Oh, what a place. He said the great
[43:11] birds uh swinging from tree to tree and
[43:14] Adam could call them by name and they
[43:15] would fly up on his shoulder and cool on
[43:17] him. Oh, what a wonderful place God had.
[43:22] The message the breach between the seven
[43:25] church ages and the seals. Brother Ram
[43:28] says, "And when he lost his life, he
[43:31] lost his inheritance in life because he
[43:35] had complete supreme control of the
[43:38] earth. He was God of the earth. God is
[43:40] God of the universe everywhere. But his
[43:43] son had earth under his control. He
[43:46] could speak, he could name, he could
[43:48] say, he could stop nature. He could do
[43:51] anything he wanted. But he did that. But
[43:55] when he did that,
[43:57] when he fell, he lost his inheritance.
[44:02] Adam could say, uh, let this mountain
[44:04] here be moved over there and it would
[44:06] obey him.
[44:08] Adam could say, "Let this tree be
[44:09] plucked up and planted over there." And
[44:11] it would do it. For he had complete
[44:14] supreme control as a minor God under God
[44:17] our father because he was a son of God.
[44:20] Why are you reading all this? Because
[44:23] God is calling us into the same image.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; So if we know what God created at the
[44:31] beginning, we know what we are to
[44:32] become.
[44:36] After Adam fell in Genesis chapter 3,
[44:40] man was born without the will of God,
[44:45] without the spoken word of God. Where
[44:48] Adam was born by the by the spoken word,
[44:51] God said, "Let's make man in our image
[44:53] and it happened." Well, after the fall,
[44:55] everyone that has been born has been
[44:58] born completely out of the will of God.
[45:02] We were all born through a sinful nature
[45:06] without God.
[45:09] Man had become separated from God. God
[45:12] could no longer say that man was in his
[45:15] image anymore.
[45:18] Man was being born in the image of
[45:20] Satan.
[45:24] Uh we should all say amen to that
[45:26] because it would help us.
[45:29] In other words,
[45:31] uh,
[45:33] everybody that was born was born
[45:35] selfish, proud,
[45:38] rebellious against the word of God, no
[45:40] desire to do the will of God. Every time
[45:43] you try to correct the child, it just it
[45:45] don't want to do it.
[45:47] But that was not
[45:50] the man that God made in his image.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; God had to turn his head from man.
[45:58] Literally in Genesis 6:5, "And God saw
[46:02] that the wickedness of man was great in
[46:05] the earth. And that every imagination of
[46:08] the thoughts of his heart were only evil
[46:13] continuously.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God."
[46:17] And he actually repented and it repented
[46:20] the Lord that he that he made man on the
[46:24] earth and it grieved him in his heart.
[46:26] So think about how sad God was that here
[46:31] was man
[46:32] with in the image of Satan.
[46:35] And you could go to Revelations chapter
[46:38] 13 and read about the mark of the beast.
[46:40] Um it is said that it is the same mark
[46:43] as as as is the number of man. They're
[46:46] the same. They're one and the same. 666.
[46:53] So when Jesus came to earth,
[46:56] he had the same testimony. He said,
[46:58] "There is none good but one that is
[47:00] God."
[47:01] And Jesus told a ruler of the Jews, he
[47:04] was actually a master of Israel, his
[47:05] name was Nicodemus. He said, "Verily,
[47:07] verily, I say unto you, except a man be
[47:10] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[47:13] God." So now we're going right back to
[47:16] the birth. And of course, Nicodemus, you
[47:19] know the story, how can uh a man enter
[47:22] to his mother's womb again and be born?
[47:25] And
[47:27] but the the flesh part
[47:34] is
[47:35] part of the creation of God.
[47:38] But the nature of humans was not
[47:44] God's
[47:46] because everything that God makes is
[47:48] good.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus is telling Nicodemus
[47:55] that your nature, you need a new nature
[48:00] in order to enter into the kingdom of
[48:02] God. This nature that you have, no
[48:05] matter how good of a person you are, no
[48:07] matter what great things you do, it will
[48:09] never allow you to come into the
[48:10] kingdom, that nature has to die and a
[48:14] new nature has to be born in you.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Most people don't understand what it
[48:19] means to be born again.
[48:25] They believe it's an act of God whereby
[48:28] eternal life is imparted to the person
[48:29] who believes. That's why you got people
[48:32] saying, "I believe. I'm born again. I
[48:35] believe."
[48:37] And they're they're missing what the new
[48:40] birth really is.
[48:45] John 3:6,
[48:48] Jesus speaking here. John 3:6, that
[48:50] which is born of the flesh is flesh, and
[48:52] that which is born of the spirit is
[48:54] spirit. So flesh is man's nature alone
[48:59] involved. So just two people come
[49:01] together, they have an act, and then
[49:03] they have a child. That's flesh.
[49:06] But that which is born of the spirit is
[49:08] when God comes into a person's heart and
[49:11] changes their nature and births his
[49:15] actual word inside of them.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; He births. In other words, it's the seed
[49:20] of God that goes into the heart, which
[49:23] is the womb of of of a human, and a new
[49:27] nature will spring forth from that
[49:29] birth, from that word being planted. Are
[49:32] you with me so far?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; All right. Jesus said in verse 7,
[49:35] "Marvel not that I said unto you, you
[49:38] must be born again. The wind bloweth
[49:41] where it listeth, and thou hearest the
[49:44] sound there, but you cannot tell where
[49:46] it came and where it's going." So is
[49:48] everyone that's born of the spirit. In
[49:51] other words, it's never controlled by
[49:53] you. You don't know.
[49:56] It's God.
[49:58] It's it's
[50:01] Adam wasn't birthed
[50:04] by God, created by God, the spoken word.
[50:08] And he says, "You know what? I'm going
[50:09] to do my own thing."
[50:11] &gt;&gt; God would never He would never have a
[50:15] different seed inside of him.
[50:19] The seed that was in God produced Adam.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; It produced the right nature.
[50:27] And when the seed of God comes into us
[50:29] through the word of God,
[50:32] it will produce the same nature
[50:34] &gt;&gt; that God is because his word and him is
[50:37] the same.
[50:42] The new birth has everything to do with
[50:45] the will of God.
[50:48] and it produces the same image of God.
[50:52] Every seed brings forth of its own kind.
[50:54] When a person with God's seed inside of
[50:57] him recognizes who they are, they will
[50:59] feed on the word of God until they begin
[51:01] to manifest who God is.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Can't get away from it. You got, you
[51:05] know what? You have the majority of of
[51:07] of
[51:10] professing believers trying to sell that
[51:14] they're a Christian.
[51:17] but their life doesn't match it.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; And in reality, if they would just focus
[51:23] on living the word, they don't have to
[51:25] sell anything.
[51:27] [laughter]
[51:28] &gt;&gt; They just manifest the word. Jesus said,
[51:31] "You must be born again. There's no
[51:32] other options."
[51:35] And what that really means is a man must
[51:37] be born according to the way God
[51:40] originally planned.
[51:43] Man must be born to the way that God
[51:46] originally planned. So the way that
[51:50] we're born is not good enough. And when
[51:53] God wills us to be born, he will will us
[51:57] to be born according to his image.
[52:01] There was nothing in his mind that said,
[52:03] you know, I want to make man in a
[52:05] different image than me.
[52:08] All the other animals, even the most
[52:10] subtle beast was not in his image.
[52:15] But man, he wanted fellowship with man.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; He had a he had a purpose with man.
[52:22] And that was to have fellowship with
[52:24] him. And he couldn't have the kind of
[52:26] fellowship he wanted if he was talking
[52:29] to some lower creature.
[52:32] Right? Even the most subtle obese could
[52:34] talk, could reason, but it couldn't
[52:37] connect, not on the same level.
[52:42] So when the new birth takes place in a
[52:44] Christian's life, their life begins to
[52:47] mold more into the image of God.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; It begins to evolve
[52:54] and and each day, each week, each month,
[52:57] it it just provides another opportunity
[52:59] for that word to grow. Now, what we have
[53:02] for the majority is we have churches out
[53:04] there who who are claiming Christianity,
[53:07] but they're really not coming into the
[53:09] image of God.
[53:12] And you can't just because people put
[53:15] peacock feathers inside of them, it
[53:16] doesn't make them a peacock.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; I I I mean, every peacock's going to
[53:21] bring forth of its kind. [laughter]
[53:24] And a Christian is just a born again
[53:26] Christian. He's just going to come forth
[53:28] in the image of Jesus Christ. THAT'S ALL
[53:30] THERE IS TO IT.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; You couldn't stop it.
[53:35] So when Jesus said is is born again, if
[53:37] you look it up,
[53:40] it means to procreate.
[53:44] Procreate.
[53:47] Something that wasn't there now comes
[53:50] into existence. It means to regenerate.
[53:54] It means to bear or to begat or to bring
[53:59] forth into existence.
[54:01] It means to conceive in word form and to
[54:04] be delivered of in manifestation.
[54:08] So in reality, this born again
[54:10] experience is not something that happens
[54:11] in your head.
[54:13] Not something you prove in your head or
[54:15] the way you talk
[54:17] or even human changes that you can, you
[54:20] know, do in yourself. It's the literal
[54:24] working of God's Holy Spirit in a human
[54:27] heart that literally changes his very
[54:29] nature.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And it is the most glorious thing that
[54:33] could happen to a human in on on planet
[54:36] Earth. That's what we're talking about
[54:37] today. The greatest thing that could
[54:39] happen. And you know what I love about
[54:42] uh Paul? Paul taught me that your
[54:45] attitude
[54:47] means everything of what you're going to
[54:49] become.
[54:51] If Paul had half the attitude, I think
[54:54] he would have manifested only half of
[54:56] the life of Christ. But because he had
[54:59] this attitude, I want more of God. Oh, I
[55:02] oh that I might know him. He wanted to
[55:04] press into him. Not just the the knowing
[55:07] him like this because we don't know
[55:09] Christ up here. We know Christ by
[55:11] experience.
[55:14] 2 Corinthians chapter 5
[55:20] verse 16 says, "Wherefore henceforth
[55:23] know we know man after the flesh. Yay,
[55:25] though we have known have known Christ
[55:28] after the flesh, yet now henceforth know
[55:30] we him no more." In other words, it's a
[55:33] spiritual birth. If we could just forget
[55:36] it doesn't have anything to do with our
[55:38] reasoning, our understanding. We're not
[55:40] to lean into our own understanding.
[55:43] We're not to, you know, try to do it
[55:45] oursel. We're just follow the word.
[55:47] Whatever the word says, that's God.
[55:49] That's the new birth. Just do what the
[55:51] word says and we become the word.
[55:55] Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[55:58] here's the criteria. Any man that's born
[56:00] again, he really is a new creature.
[56:06] Old things are passed away.
[56:10] Behold, all things are become new. In
[56:15] other words, our first birth, there was
[56:17] nothing about God's image in us. Not one
[56:21] single thing about our first birth had
[56:25] anything of God's image in us. Nothing.
[56:29] I I mean we might have been cute to look
[56:31] at, cute to hold
[56:35] and uh have be able to have fellowship
[56:38] with someone older.
[56:41] But our nature, there was nothing in our
[56:44] nature that was in the image of God.
[56:49] It was a mixed tree.
[56:52] Its motives were wrong. They were
[56:53] selfish.
[56:55] Has anybody ever met anybody that that
[56:58] that weren't a Christian
[57:01] and uh their motive wasn't selfish
[57:04] somewhere down the road?
[57:06] You understand what I'm saying? There's
[57:07] there's something in it for them.
[57:10] But if any man be in Christ, he's a new
[57:12] creature. Old things are way passed
[57:14] away. Behold, all things have become new
[57:16] and all things are of God. So to me,
[57:19] these scriptures define what the new
[57:22] birth is.
[57:24] So it doesn't matter if we say we're
[57:26] born again. We should say, "Are all
[57:28] things new in our life?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Has all the old been passed away?"
[57:32] Because if it isn't, then we need to be
[57:34] pressing into that because the the new
[57:38] birth will produce that.
[57:41] It will produce that.
[57:44] Now, in order for all things to become
[57:45] new, we must keep planting the word of
[57:48] God into our heart. That's what this
[57:50] service is about. We must keep planting
[57:54] the word of God. You plant it.
[57:59] We don't want to just have part of the
[58:01] word, but we want to have every word of
[58:03] God. There's a reason that Jesus said we
[58:05] must have every word of God. And the
[58:09] spiritual birth is happening to us every
[58:11] day
[58:13] as we receive the word.
[58:18] As you receive the word, truly receive
[58:21] it, not know it, not quote it, not say,
[58:25] "Yeah, I believe it." But you actually
[58:28] begin to put heart into obeying it.
[58:33] And it and and your heart and you you
[58:37] keep doing it. You can't do it for a
[58:38] week,
[58:40] right? The word didn't fall on good
[58:42] ground there. You got to have a sincere
[58:44] heart. You got to just keep doing it.
[58:47] then your your your born again
[58:49] experience is happening.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, we we should be
[58:53] testifying. That's where tell our
[58:55] testimony should be happening is the the
[58:58] of the new birth in our life.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; You know, because this to me is should
[59:02] be just as exciting today as the first
[59:04] day that Jesus saved us.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] Amen.
[59:11] As the word is being preached, we open
[59:13] our heart. We let it in. We give him
[59:16] liberty
[59:17] and he begins to build his image inside
[59:21] of us. And that's how it does it. It's
[59:24] so simple
[59:27] uh that I think it it just bypasses so
[59:30] many people because you know it it's not
[59:33] in doing great things. It's not getting
[59:35] in great revelations.
[59:37] It's not in demonstration of of the
[59:40] flesh. It's really uh simply a human
[59:44] being with humility and love that says,
[59:46] "I'm just going to obey what God tells
[59:47] me to do." And they begin to do it. And
[59:49] you step back and you say, "That's that
[59:51] is not a human. That's God. That is God
[59:55] in a person."
[59:57] 2 Corinthians chapter 3:1 17 says, "Now
[1:00:01] the Lord is that spirit, and where the
[1:00:04] spirit of the Lord is, there is
[1:00:06] liberty."
[1:00:09] That's why we always want to give God
[1:00:11] liberty in our heart.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; We don't want to say, "No, I'm not going
[1:00:14] to do that. No, I don't want to hear
[1:00:15] that. No, I don't want to listen to
[1:00:17] that. No, I don't have to do that." You
[1:00:19] know, God resists the proud and gives
[1:00:23] grace to the humble. Right now, the Lord
[1:00:26] is that spirit. Where the spirit of the
[1:00:27] Lord is, there is liberty. But we all
[1:00:30] with open face, beholding as in a glass
[1:00:34] the glory
[1:00:36] of the Lord. We're looking at the glory
[1:00:38] of God when we look into this Bible.
[1:00:42] We are changed, the Bible says, into
[1:00:46] the same image of our Lord
[1:00:49] from glory to glory even as by the
[1:00:54] spirit of the Lord. So we come to
[1:00:56] church, we're hearing the word of God
[1:00:58] preached and written this. What that is
[1:01:00] is not some minister up here. Certainly
[1:01:02] not just brother John up here speaking
[1:01:04] words. We believe that God just uses
[1:01:07] this office. He puts a minister behind
[1:01:10] the the sacred desk. He speaks his word
[1:01:14] and to the believer who believes that
[1:01:17] word is God's word to their heart
[1:01:19] personally.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Receives it. They become changed.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; There's nothing worse than sitting in
[1:01:28] church and never being changed.
[1:01:32] That is the most miserable horrible
[1:01:35] thing.
[1:01:39] Something is wrong with the heart. Not
[1:01:42] the word.
[1:01:44] Not the word. The word is perfect.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; We are changed into the same image of
[1:01:55] God. God is still saying today. I mean,
[1:01:58] or I believe he's still holding forth
[1:02:02] his word that he spoke in Genesis
[1:02:03] chapter one, let us make man in our own
[1:02:06] image. That is still his heart's desire.
[1:02:09] He is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:02:10] forever. The purpose that he had back
[1:02:12] then, he wants to have it today. Yes, he
[1:02:15] wanted it in the spoken word. But but
[1:02:17] what is happening? Okay. Oh my. God had
[1:02:22] all these attributes that he wanted to
[1:02:24] express that he could have never
[1:02:26] expressed his love as we know if there
[1:02:28] was a perfect sending. So he had to
[1:02:32] create evil as the Bible says and allow
[1:02:35] this thing to come about so man could
[1:02:37] fall and he could come down and be a
[1:02:39] savior and be a healer, be a redeemer,
[1:02:41] be a deliverer that would never be able
[1:02:43] to be manifested if he didn't allow
[1:02:46] that.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; But what did he do? HE GAVE HIS BRIDE
[1:02:50] THE SAME OPPORTUNITY IN SATAN'S Eden
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; to say no to Satan, TO SAY NO TO THE
[1:02:57] FLESH, to say yes, I'll take God's word
[1:03:01] and begin to prove to God, I love you,
[1:03:04] Lord.
[1:03:06] I love you. I love you more than myself.
[1:03:11] I don't like this ugly nature. I really
[1:03:13] want to be in your image, Lord. I want
[1:03:15] to reflect you next time there's a
[1:03:17] trial. I want to be just like you next
[1:03:20] time I go that thing.
[1:03:23] I don't want to come short.
[1:03:25] I want to be like you, Jesus.
[1:03:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:32] That was fresh.
[1:03:36] Bible says or brother Ram said the
[1:03:38] message the rapture he says then if God
[1:03:40] ever does anything in the church it'll
[1:03:43] be original back with the word again.
[1:03:47] Exactly. It has to be because the life
[1:03:49] is in the tree and it bears its own
[1:03:52] kind. Jesus wants fruit of or for
[1:03:56] himself. His wife must bring forth the
[1:04:01] kind of children that he is.
[1:04:09] Then if it don't bring forth children,
[1:04:12] bride children, word children, then it's
[1:04:15] a denominational child.
[1:04:19] Then her first love, the world, the
[1:04:21] denomination,
[1:04:23] she's gone back to that and it can't
[1:04:26] bring forth a real genuine born again
[1:04:28] Christian because there's nothing there
[1:04:30] to bring it forth.
[1:04:34] In the message, the seed is not air with
[1:04:36] the shut. Brother Ram said, "But a
[1:04:38] genuine born-again church of God
[1:04:40] believes the word of God in the face of
[1:04:43] everything regardless of what it is."
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; The word is the absolute. Praise God.
[1:04:49] The word is our absolute.
[1:04:53] The spiritual birth takes place as the
[1:04:56] word of God is planted into our hearts.
[1:04:59] said that, but I want to I want it to
[1:05:01] stick because you know sometimes we make
[1:05:03] this thing real hard like how can I get
[1:05:06] the Holy Ghost? How can I be born again?
[1:05:08] How can I get delivered? How can I
[1:05:10] change? How can I become more like God?
[1:05:11] And it's real simple. Start obeying the
[1:05:14] word of God.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Things happen supernaturally when you
[1:05:18] trust God enough. You don't lean to your
[1:05:20] own understanding. You just trust God.
[1:05:22] You start obeying him.
[1:05:24] 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 22.
[1:05:28] This is, you know, definitely bears um
[1:05:31] studying when you get home the scripture
[1:05:34] here. 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 22.
[1:05:37] Seeing
[1:05:39] you have purified
[1:05:42] your soul. You've done it. You've done
[1:05:45] it. You purified your soul in obeying
[1:05:51] the truth through the spirit unto
[1:05:54] unfeign love of the brethren. See that
[1:05:57] you love one another with a pure heart
[1:05:58] fatly being born again. Now notice, go
[1:06:01] back there just a second verse.
[1:06:04] It's a colon.
[1:06:06] It's not the end of a sentence. And what
[1:06:09] is in that included in this sentence?
[1:06:13] Verse 23, being born again or begat or
[1:06:17] brought into existence
[1:06:19] not of a corruptible seed, but of an
[1:06:23] incorruptible seed by the word of God
[1:06:26] which liveth and abideth forever. See,
[1:06:28] you take that word and you purify
[1:06:30] yourself by obeying it, seeing that you
[1:06:33] have purified yourself by obeying the
[1:06:36] word of God. It's so simple. We don't we
[1:06:39] don't have to have any feeling, any
[1:06:42] emotion, any demonstration, any great
[1:06:45] dream or or or or or a vision. Alls we
[1:06:50] need is a heart that says, "I believe
[1:06:54] that I am a seed of God. I believe I'm a
[1:06:58] child of God. I believe I've been called
[1:07:02] into his image."
[1:07:04] Um the Bible says that um we've been
[1:07:08] predestinated
[1:07:10] uh that that Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:12] firstborn among many brethren.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; So just how Jesus is, I I'm going to be
[1:07:20] because I'm part of that group
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; and I I have faith that I'm going to be
[1:07:25] in his image. So I take the word of God
[1:07:27] more seriously.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:32] Become in love with the word. Not your
[1:07:34] reputation,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; not your image, not what you want people
[1:07:38] to think about you,
[1:07:40] but become in love with the word.
[1:07:43] Oh, I love the word. The word of God is
[1:07:47] a seed. We must have it planted. We must
[1:07:50] plant it in our heart, not our head. I
[1:07:53] tell you about your head. I don't
[1:07:55] whatever you're thinking about right
[1:07:57] now.
[1:07:59] In an hour from now, you won't be
[1:08:00] thinking about it.
[1:08:06] You may go to the restaurant and say,
[1:08:08] you know, I really want to have some
[1:08:09] pancakes. You get those pancakes. Oh
[1:08:10] man, I didn't want pancakes.
[1:08:14] Your mind changes
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; all the time. Now, thank God for mine.
[1:08:19] We need a sound mind,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:24] But the word can't be just planted in
[1:08:26] your mind.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Your mind, your mind
[1:08:33] understands the word as you read it or
[1:08:35] you hear it preached, but it needs to
[1:08:38] drop down into the heart and it needs to
[1:08:40] stay there and abide there forever.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; That that settles it. I believe it.
[1:08:46] Nothing is going to change it. my
[1:08:48] emotions, my feelings. So many times I
[1:08:50] get rejected, yelled at. No matter what
[1:08:52] happens in my life, how much sickness I
[1:08:54] get, I'm going to believe the word of
[1:08:56] God. I'm going to believe that I'm going
[1:08:57] to come in his image. Nothing is going
[1:08:58] to change it.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; That's why it has to drop. And it needs
[1:09:02] to be planted in the heart. When you
[1:09:05] plant it, it grows.
[1:09:09] If you only think about it, it'll stop
[1:09:12] growing when you stop thinking about it.
[1:09:15] But plan it in your heart and your
[1:09:18] nature will literally change day by day.
[1:09:22] Verse 24. For all the flesh is as grass
[1:09:25] in the glory of man as the flower of
[1:09:28] grass. The grass witherth and the
[1:09:31] flowers thereof fallth away. But the
[1:09:34] word of the Lord endureth forever. And
[1:09:36] this is the word which by the gospel was
[1:09:38] preached unto you. We've all had flowers
[1:09:40] in our home, have we not?
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And they're so beautiful. when they
[1:09:45] first come,
[1:09:46] they're just you look at them, it cheers
[1:09:48] you up
[1:09:51] and you just they're just beautiful. You
[1:09:54] testify of the beauty. Well, we know God
[1:09:56] created them. But eventually those
[1:09:58] flowers start to brown and wilt
[1:10:02] and look like we got to get rid of these
[1:10:05] things.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; We got to get them out of here. They're
[1:10:07] starting to stink up the place.
[1:10:10] Well, that's what happens to me if you
[1:10:13] just have the word in your mind.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; We can't even go the next day and
[1:10:19] remember what was preached
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; last service.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But you get that word in your heart,
[1:10:24] you'll be thinking about it a lot more.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; The word of God must be planted in our
[1:10:30] hearts in order for us to obey it. We
[1:10:32] won't keep obeying if it's just in our
[1:10:34] head.
[1:10:35] And as we obey it, we become the word
[1:10:38] manifested for the hour that we're
[1:10:40] living in. We'll be changed from glory
[1:10:43] onto glory.
[1:10:45] Amen. Brother Brham said, told you I had
[1:10:48] a lot of reading, a lot of quotes, but I
[1:10:51] hope hope this is a a blessing to you.
[1:10:54] The signs of his coming. Brother Bham
[1:10:56] says, "And if the word of the Lord and
[1:10:59] if it's the word of the Lord, then it's
[1:11:01] his premeditated thought." Amen. and how
[1:11:05] we were how we have eternal life because
[1:11:09] we was spoken into existence by God.
[1:11:13] Not joining into a church but born by
[1:11:18] the word.
[1:11:20] Born by the word the original seed that
[1:11:24] God said let there be and
[1:11:29] there was. Amen. That's the way God bs
[1:11:33] his children today in the womb of their
[1:11:36] heart with his word and his word takes
[1:11:40] root and it grows.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; We've got to plant that word. We have a
[1:11:45] part of that. I mean, we could, you
[1:11:48] know, how many times we heard people
[1:11:49] sitting in church all their life and
[1:11:51] they never change.
[1:11:53] They never receive the word into their
[1:11:55] heart.
[1:11:59] But you could just take one word and you
[1:12:02] plant it in your heart. Something will
[1:12:03] change inside of you. That's the power
[1:12:06] the word has when it is believed in the
[1:12:09] heart.
[1:12:12] Said, "How can a spirit in a human heart
[1:12:14] say it's of God
[1:12:19] and deny this word?"
[1:12:23] When the very God word itself
[1:12:26] is
[1:12:28] when the very God word itself is
[1:12:32] what's in the human heart. Amen. If it
[1:12:35] isn't, it's something else and then it
[1:12:39] isn't the Holy Spirit. In other words,
[1:12:42] anybody that says, "Yeah, I'm born
[1:12:43] again. I've got the Holy Ghost." But
[1:12:46] they deny the word of God. Something is
[1:12:49] wrong with that spirit
[1:12:51] because the Holy Spirit and the word is
[1:12:53] the same. It's our absolute. Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; We must keep feeding on the word more
[1:13:00] and more to grow. Brother Bram said,
[1:13:02] "The true vine, the false vine said, we
[1:13:04] know that the Holy Ghost feeds on the
[1:13:07] word."
[1:13:08] Feeds on the word. I know when I was in
[1:13:11] the world, I didn't even think of the
[1:13:14] word.
[1:13:17] I was feeding on everything else.
[1:13:21] And then when God began to deal with me,
[1:13:23] I remember laying on my bed and reading
[1:13:25] the Bible a little bit.
[1:13:28] And then I was feeding on the world
[1:13:29] still.
[1:13:31] I was. And then I'd get the Bible and
[1:13:34] I'd read a little bit. Eventually, I had
[1:13:36] to make a decision
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; what I was going to feed my life with.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; As the eagle stereth up her nest, the
[1:13:45] ram says, "Oh, I like to have sheep
[1:13:47] food, good food, the power of God, the
[1:13:49] word of God, the Holy Ghost feeds on
[1:13:51] it." That's what the church needs
[1:13:54] tonight is a good solid gospel
[1:13:56] preaching, gospel teaching, gospel
[1:13:58] salvation, and the gospel Holy Ghost.
[1:14:02] In the message thirst, brother Ram says
[1:14:04] if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit,
[1:14:07] the word of God,
[1:14:12] Jesus said, "Every word shall be by the
[1:14:16] Holy Spirit." He says, "And listen now,
[1:14:19] if you try to feed it with the wrong
[1:14:21] thing, if it's the genuine Holy Spirit
[1:14:24] in you, it'll know the difference." Now
[1:14:26] remember, the word of God is what the
[1:14:28] Holy Spirit feeds on. It don't feed on
[1:14:31] enthusiasm.
[1:14:34] It don't feed on education.
[1:14:37] It don't feed on churchgoing.
[1:14:39] It doesn't feed on theologies.
[1:14:42] There is a lot of difference between an
[1:14:45] inspired something and a theological
[1:14:47] standpoint of it.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; It's hard to feed on the word of God if
[1:14:53] our hearts are not prepared. I want to
[1:14:54] spend just a few minutes talking about
[1:14:55] the importance of our hearts being
[1:14:57] prepared. If we're not careful,
[1:15:01] we may become satisfied with just making
[1:15:03] it to church.
[1:15:05] I made it to church. Preparation has
[1:15:08] nothing to do with making it to church.
[1:15:10] It has everything to do with the
[1:15:12] condition of your heart while you're at
[1:15:14] church.
[1:15:16] Brother Ram says this is where God deals
[1:15:19] with us.
[1:15:20] And we come here to learn where we're at
[1:15:23] spiritually.
[1:15:25] Amen.
[1:15:27] So, let's turn to Matthew chapter 13 or
[1:15:30] or you can look up here or those that
[1:15:32] are taking notes. And what we're going
[1:15:34] to do is we're going to skip around in
[1:15:36] chapter 13 here to I've never done this
[1:15:38] before with this quite like this uh that
[1:15:41] I can remember. So, just maybe to help
[1:15:46] uh
[1:15:48] we might grab something more than than
[1:15:51] we would have before. I'm not sure.
[1:15:52] We're just going to try it. We're going
[1:15:53] to start with verse number two of
[1:15:55] Matthew 13. And great multitudes were
[1:15:57] gathered together unto him, so that he
[1:16:00] went into a ship and sat and the whole
[1:16:02] multitude stood on the shore. Now, can
[1:16:04] you imagine if we would have came in
[1:16:05] here and I'd be sitting up here and
[1:16:07] you'd all be standing. That's kind of
[1:16:09] what was happening when Jesus was
[1:16:11] preaching here. And he spake many things
[1:16:14] unto them in parables, saying, "A swer
[1:16:16] went forth to sow.
[1:16:20] And when he sold, some seeds fell by the
[1:16:22] wayside, and the fowls came and devoured
[1:16:25] them up. So what kind of seed was Jesus
[1:16:29] referring to here?
[1:16:32] Luke 8:11 tells us,
[1:16:34] now the parable is this. The seed is the
[1:16:38] word of God.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; So here it is. The swer went forth and
[1:16:43] he swed the word of God. Seeds, right?
[1:16:47] Like, "Brother Ben, you need to pray.
[1:16:51] Genie, you got to love.
[1:16:54] Sister Joy,
[1:16:57] you got to
[1:17:00] do something." [laughter]
[1:17:03] And the seeds just went out. He swed
[1:17:05] seeds. You know, when you come to
[1:17:06] church, you hear so many different
[1:17:09] things being preached.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; That helped me. That was a blessing. Or
[1:17:13] I wish somebody so and so was here. That
[1:17:15] would have helped them.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; But there's a lot of seeds here, right?
[1:17:23] And it it's it's really
[1:17:26] um in one sense singular because it's
[1:17:28] God, but in attributes with he it's
[1:17:32] seeds and that's the way it's referred
[1:17:34] to. The seed is the word of God. And
[1:17:38] some seeds fell by the wayside and the
[1:17:40] fowls came and devoured them up.
[1:17:44] So look at verse 19. The interpretation
[1:17:47] comes in verse 19 of what this is. And
[1:17:49] when one
[1:17:51] when anyone hears the word
[1:17:55] being preached and he doesn't understand
[1:17:58] it,
[1:18:01] then cometh the wicked one and catcheth
[1:18:04] away that which was sown in his heart.
[1:18:07] This is he that receiveth seed by the
[1:18:09] wayside.
[1:18:12] So the word, it does make it to the
[1:18:15] heart,
[1:18:18] but because the person just kind of came
[1:18:20] to church and plopped in
[1:18:24] and he's really not paying attention,
[1:18:26] he's not involved.
[1:18:30] He doesn't quite understand what the
[1:18:32] word is being preached.
[1:18:35] The enemy is going to come and take that
[1:18:36] word out of them to where it's not even
[1:18:38] going to become part of their life.
[1:18:39] That's very true.
[1:18:42] Verse five. And some of the seeds they
[1:18:46] fell on stony places where they had not
[1:18:50] much earth and forth with they sprung
[1:18:53] up. And because they had no depthness of
[1:18:56] earth, and when the sun was up, they
[1:19:00] were scorched. And because they had no
[1:19:02] root, they withered away.
[1:19:07] So this is another condition that man
[1:19:09] has when he comes to church and he hears
[1:19:10] the word of God.
[1:19:13] It's his heart is has hardness, hard
[1:19:16] spots in them. Maybe the whole thing
[1:19:19] isn't hard, but there's hard spots in
[1:19:21] them.
[1:19:23] And Jesus gives interpretation here in
[1:19:25] verse 20 and 21. But he that receiveth
[1:19:28] seed into stony places, the same as he
[1:19:31] that heareth the word and says, "Amen."
[1:19:34] and and with joy he receives it and says
[1:19:37] yes I want this yet
[1:19:41] have he not root in himself
[1:19:44] but dareth for a while for when
[1:19:47] tribulation or persecution arises
[1:19:50] because of the word by and by he is
[1:19:52] offended
[1:19:55] in other words as long as everything's
[1:19:56] going okay I can say amen yes I like the
[1:19:59] word I think it's a great thing
[1:20:03] But if you only if if you don't have
[1:20:07] root, in other words, the word is only
[1:20:10] in your head, like you're a head
[1:20:12] Christian,
[1:20:14] and you don't get it down into the
[1:20:17] deepness of your heart where that word
[1:20:20] means everything to you. Soon as a
[1:20:23] little trial comes by, you get offended,
[1:20:26] little persecution comes by, you get
[1:20:29] hurt,
[1:20:31] and then all of a sudden, well, I'm not
[1:20:33] going to live the life right now.
[1:20:37] The word is not going to those first of
[1:20:41] all, those two grounds will not bring
[1:20:43] forth the image of Christ.
[1:20:47] It'll make you act like a Christian for
[1:20:49] a while, but it'll never bring forth the
[1:20:51] image of Christ.
[1:20:53] Verse seven. And some fell among thorns,
[1:20:57] and the thorns sprung up and choked
[1:20:59] them.
[1:21:01] Think about that. Why didn't the word
[1:21:04] choke it out?
[1:21:06] Verse 22.
[1:21:08] He also that re receiveth seed among the
[1:21:11] thorns is he that heareth the word. And
[1:21:14] the care of this world,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; and the deceitfulness of riches choke
[1:21:21] the word,
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; and he becometh unfruitful.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Why doesn't the word choke out the cares
[1:21:32] of life?
[1:21:34] Why doesn't it? Because the word's
[1:21:36] powerful. Why doesn't it?
[1:21:39] Because there's one thing that God will
[1:21:42] not cross and that's free more agency.
[1:21:46] He will not take second place to the
[1:21:48] devil.
[1:21:50] He's not going to stay there.
[1:21:52] What'll happen is he will
[1:21:57] when you allow the things of the world
[1:21:59] in your life, they will choke out
[1:22:03] the the word of God that you received in
[1:22:06] the past.
[1:22:08] And the cares of life are just problems
[1:22:10] that we have, right? Things that we got
[1:22:13] to do. You know what? Whether things we
[1:22:16] got to fix at the house, things we had
[1:22:18] more things to fix at our house this
[1:22:19] year than any other time.
[1:22:25] And these things can get in the way of
[1:22:26] your time with God
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; and your attitude that you have when you
[1:22:30] come to church. Some problem that you're
[1:22:32] having at home or something, all of a
[1:22:34] sudden that gets in there and that
[1:22:36] chokes the word
[1:22:40] cannot bring forth the image of Christ.
[1:22:44] Here's the fourth type of ground. Verse
[1:22:46] eight, but other fell into good ground,
[1:22:50] and it brought forth, and some 100fold,
[1:22:52] 60fold, and 30fold, who has ears to
[1:22:54] hear, let him hear. Verse 23 kind of
[1:22:58] describes what this good ground is. But
[1:23:00] he that receiveth seed into good ground
[1:23:04] is he that re that hears the word being
[1:23:06] preached, he has an understanding of it,
[1:23:09] which also beareth fruit,
[1:23:13] and bringeth forth
[1:23:16] some 100, some 60, and some 30.
[1:23:20] So notice
[1:23:23] he obeys the word
[1:23:27] and the word produces fruit
[1:23:32] and this is what brings the image of
[1:23:34] Christ. This is the only ground that
[1:23:37] will bring the image of Christ. I like
[1:23:39] how Luke 8, you know, speaking of that
[1:23:41] same parable here, defines what this uh
[1:23:46] good ground is, but that on good ground
[1:23:49] are they which in an honest and good
[1:23:53] heart, having heard the word, they keep
[1:23:57] it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
[1:24:02] They're not in and out of the church.
[1:24:03] They're faithful.
[1:24:06] They they I if this is what the word
[1:24:08] says, they just do it. If this is what
[1:24:10] the prophet said, they just do it. They
[1:24:12] learn to be faithful. That is the first
[1:24:15] step of anything is faithfulness.
[1:24:20] God is faithful. His wife is faithful.
[1:24:22] His children are faithful.
[1:24:25] There's only one ground that will bring
[1:24:28] forth the image of God in us and remain.
[1:24:31] And that's good. A good sincere heart.
[1:24:34] What good would it do to come into
[1:24:35] church, plop down in your seat, and the
[1:24:38] devil takes away what was swn in your
[1:24:39] heart?
[1:24:41] What good does it do? Wh what what good
[1:24:44] would it do to receive the word of God
[1:24:46] if you come into church and you got
[1:24:47] hardness about somebody or something?
[1:24:52] You're you're you're you're it won't
[1:24:53] last. What good would it be to come into
[1:24:56] church if you got if you got things of
[1:24:59] the world? If you love the world or the
[1:25:01] things of the world, the the love of the
[1:25:02] father's not in you. It won't hold you.
[1:25:04] It these this this type of heart
[1:25:07] condition cannot bring forth the image
[1:25:09] of Christ. And and we need to become
[1:25:12] that. We need to become the image of
[1:25:14] Christ if we're going to make a rapture.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; We just got to it. It it we've got to
[1:25:18] come in. We've got to get more prepared.
[1:25:20] We've got to spend time in the prayer
[1:25:22] room.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; We don't want to get to church at 10:00.
[1:25:26] We want to get to church at 9:30. Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And and God bless my precious brother.
[1:25:31] Get I know he got here just as soon as
[1:25:33] he could. I had nothing meaning there.
[1:25:35] Um but I'll tell you sometimes we we
[1:25:37] come here to church early. You know what
[1:25:40] we'd end up doing? Talking.
[1:25:43] Talking.
[1:25:45] And you know what we do after church?
[1:25:47] Talking.
[1:25:49] Like if we prepared before service in
[1:25:52] the prayer rooms
[1:25:54] when we heard the word when we get out
[1:25:56] of church we'd be talking about the
[1:25:57] word. [laughter]
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; That's what it does for us.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] There's only
[1:26:06] one heart that's
[1:26:09] going to bring forth the image of Christ
[1:26:11] and it's those that are serious that go
[1:26:13] deep in Christ. They're ordained.
[1:26:16] They're elected. They're chosen to be
[1:26:17] the bride and they will let the word of
[1:26:21] the Lord conform them. That's it. They
[1:26:23] through free more agency. They say, "If
[1:26:25] that's what the word says, I'm going to
[1:26:26] do it."
[1:26:30] What's happening inside the bride right
[1:26:32] now? We could just read real quick.
[1:26:34] Romans 12:1. We're almost We're almost
[1:26:37] through. I hope um you can just stay
[1:26:40] with me a little bit longer. I hope you
[1:26:42] can stay with me a lot longer. I mean, I
[1:26:44] got um uh more notes, more quotes.
[1:26:49] Romans 12:1, I beseech you therefore,
[1:26:51] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[1:26:53] you present your body a living
[1:26:56] sacrifice,
[1:26:58] holy and acceptable unto God, which is
[1:26:59] your reasonable service. And be not
[1:27:02] conformed to this world, but be ye
[1:27:04] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:27:07] mind. Think about the word different
[1:27:09] than you ever used to think about it.
[1:27:12] That you may prove with your life what
[1:27:15] is the good and acceptable and the
[1:27:17] perfect will of God.
[1:27:19] The word of God must become our
[1:27:23] headship.
[1:27:26] We must allow the word to dominate us.
[1:27:29] That's scary. Dominate us. Brother Brand
[1:27:32] said Queen of Sheba. He says God intends
[1:27:34] the Holy Spirit to lead the church.
[1:27:36] That's our leader. That's the one that
[1:27:38] was sent to us. And we're to be
[1:27:41] dominated by him and him alone. That's
[1:27:44] that's pretty powerful. We're to be
[1:27:46] dominated by God.
[1:27:51] Then we stay in the word level in the
[1:27:54] word. I always like brother Smith would
[1:27:57] say good balance.
[1:27:59] The Holy Spirit feeds you sheep food.
[1:28:02] And sheep food is the Bible. And it
[1:28:05] feeds on the Holy Spirit. The soul
[1:28:07] that's hungering for God feeds on the
[1:28:09] word of God.
[1:28:12] Too many people say God is in their
[1:28:15] their head, in their heart, and they
[1:28:18] they they ignore the Bible. Too many
[1:28:20] people say God is in them and they
[1:28:22] ignore the Bible. Can't do that. In the
[1:28:25] message and uh tomb, uh brother Ram
[1:28:28] says, "Then how can you say you can stay
[1:28:31] at home and be just as good a Christian
[1:28:34] as you would be at church?"
[1:28:37] He says, "You can't do that."
[1:28:40] He He said, "Read the word." That's what
[1:28:43] [laughter] brother Phom said. "Read the
[1:28:45] word."
[1:28:47] The Holy Spirit feeds on the word. The
[1:28:50] Bible is God's spiritual diet.
[1:28:53] For for those of you that are going on a
[1:28:55] diet, you know how hard it is, right?
[1:28:59] It's sometimes hard to keep reading the
[1:29:02] word of God, to stay in it,
[1:29:06] to only feed on that, to only feed on
[1:29:09] the word. There's that tendency to feed
[1:29:10] on the word and feed on other things.
[1:29:13] But you can't do that with a diet.
[1:29:16] That's why I never go on a diet. I I can
[1:29:18] eat oil cookies the rest of my life.
[1:29:26] The Bible is God's spiritual diet for
[1:29:28] his church. And the Holy Spirit is the
[1:29:31] one who brings it to you and places it
[1:29:33] in your heart. And with thanksgiving,
[1:29:36] you water it.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That's where you praise God. And every
[1:29:39] divine promise will produce just exactly
[1:29:41] what God said it would do. It's got to.
[1:29:43] It's his word and it's his life.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:49] Any
[1:29:51] promise that God makes you, any promise
[1:29:54] that God makes, you just plant it in
[1:29:56] your heart and say, "It is mine. God
[1:30:00] gave it to me."
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Now, you may not see any results right
[1:30:04] now.
[1:30:05] You don't see your corn crops soon as
[1:30:08] you plant your corn, but potentially
[1:30:10] it's there. And as long as you leave it
[1:30:12] alone, keep watering it, it'll grow.
[1:30:14] Don't worry about that. It'll take it'll
[1:30:17] it'll germinize uh if it's a Germanized
[1:30:20] seed
[1:30:21] and every word of God is germinized by
[1:30:25] God himself.
[1:30:27] God is the word so it'll grow. You know
[1:30:30] it will. There you are. We have to take
[1:30:33] his word, accept it, believe it, commit
[1:30:35] it, and it grows. That's right. But
[1:30:37] don't keep digging it up. You'll ruin
[1:30:39] it.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; You'll ruin the crop every time you do
[1:30:42] that. Just commit it to God.
[1:30:48] Brandon, this I tell you this whole
[1:30:49] message came with this one quote that
[1:30:51] I'm going to read right now. It's short.
[1:30:56] Brand said in the message, God's power
[1:30:58] to transformation. He says, "Come back
[1:31:00] to the word. Take that word and it'll
[1:31:03] grow. It'll grow. It's got to grow. That
[1:31:07] word has to come to pass. It's God's
[1:31:11] word." He said, "Plan it in your heart
[1:31:15] if you want to go in a rapture." That
[1:31:18] one sentence there just break my heart.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; You know, we can rally behind uh this
[1:31:24] message and you know it, you know, we're
[1:31:26] going to go into rapture. That's great.
[1:31:29] But if we don't plant the word of God in
[1:31:31] our heart, how can we go in the rapture?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; We we just don't plant the part of we're
[1:31:38] going to be changed in the twinkling of
[1:31:39] an eye. We don't just plant that.
[1:31:42] God is looking for some. His wife is
[1:31:44] going to be in his image.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; And so that's happening now.
[1:31:53] We should be able to come to church at
[1:31:55] least. I'll just be try to be as
[1:31:57] graceful as I can here monthly and
[1:32:00] testify there's a change that's
[1:32:01] happening to me.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Really, that should be happening. There
[1:32:05] should be testimonies of that. If
[1:32:06] there's not, I say to you, plant the
[1:32:09] word in your heart.
[1:32:11] because you'll begin reflecting Christ
[1:32:14] more. Don't get under the Leodysian
[1:32:17] spirit. I've got enough. Don't do that.
[1:32:21] Don't Don't do that. It's a trick of
[1:32:22] Satan.
[1:32:24] God wants you to press in.
[1:32:27] He says, "If you want to be genuine, if
[1:32:30] you want to be Christians genuine,
[1:32:33] place this word in your heart."
[1:32:37] Romans 6:5 says, "If if we've been
[1:32:40] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:32:42] death, we shall also be in the likeness
[1:32:46] of his resurrection." Amen. Plant the
[1:32:49] word in your heart if you want to go in
[1:32:50] a rapture.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my my. Um,
[1:32:56] okay.
[1:33:02] Am I allowed? Time is up, but am I
[1:33:04] allowed to have like Okay, thank you.
[1:33:07] Thank you. Conflict between God and St.
[1:33:09] Bill says, "Now, what is the word of
[1:33:11] God?" So, what is the word of God? The
[1:33:15] word of God is God himself.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; God gave the believer himself. That's
[1:33:22] why the word is so important to us.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; It's not just a book. It's not just
[1:33:26] ideas. It's not just, you know, it is
[1:33:28] God.
[1:33:31] God gave the believer himself. Amen. And
[1:33:34] brother Brandham says, "Woo,
[1:33:38] it's God himself. He gave the believer
[1:33:40] himself to attack the enemy by." In
[1:33:44] other words, he's the father and the
[1:33:47] word is God and the word is our father.
[1:33:51] We're born by the word. And he's
[1:33:53] standing, now listen to this, he's
[1:33:56] standing in the forefront of his
[1:33:59] children and his children. He's standing
[1:34:02] in the forefront of his children. In
[1:34:04] them.
[1:34:06] Amen. There you are. He's standing out
[1:34:08] there for his children. Kind of like the
[1:34:11] pillar of fire that was before him and
[1:34:12] behind him. What are we scared about?
[1:34:14] The rapture is sure. The coming is sure.
[1:34:17] Every blessing has been promised to us
[1:34:19] is sure. It all belongs to us. I'll tell
[1:34:23] you, I don't mean it wrong, but think
[1:34:25] about all the people who do not receive
[1:34:28] the blessings of God, who do not receive
[1:34:31] the promises of God. And they could have
[1:34:33] had them by just believing
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; in the message, the invisible union of
[1:34:37] the bride of Christ. He says, if you're
[1:34:40] married to Christ,
[1:34:43] Christ is the word of God.
[1:34:46] In St. John 1, in the beginning was the
[1:34:48] word, the word was with God, the word
[1:34:49] was God, and the same was made flesh and
[1:34:52] dwelt among us. Christ was the living
[1:34:54] word. He always was the word. He is
[1:34:58] still the word. He will always be the
[1:35:00] word. He was only manifested. He was
[1:35:03] only the manifestation of the attributes
[1:35:06] of God. For he was the son of God.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; All that was in God, he poured into
[1:35:14] Christ. All that was in Christ, he
[1:35:16] poured into the church
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; now. We are becoming in his image. It's
[1:35:21] happening. We should rejoice in that.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; We should be excited about that. Not
[1:35:27] only for what has happened, but what is
[1:35:30] to happen, right? It's like going on a
[1:35:32] vacation. Part of the excitement about
[1:35:34] going on vacation is, you know, if you
[1:35:36] ask Ron, if I if I was, if I was to ask
[1:35:38] Sister Lori, Sister Lori, uh, about this
[1:35:41] vacation that you're taking, are you
[1:35:43] excited about it? Yes, I'm excited about
[1:35:44] I can't wait till we go. And so part of
[1:35:47] the excitement is what we're going to
[1:35:48] become.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; And any son is the attributes of his
[1:35:56] father. And just as you were in the gen
[1:35:59] genes of your father, in the body of
[1:36:02] your father when he was a young boy, you
[1:36:04] were in him. Yet he could not have
[1:36:07] fellowship with you because he didn't
[1:36:09] know you. But then through the bending
[1:36:11] grounds of a mother, you were brought
[1:36:13] forth into earth and became in the image
[1:36:16] of your father. Then he could fellowship
[1:36:19] with you. And so were you sons and
[1:36:21] daughters of God before there was ever a
[1:36:23] moon, star, or any molecule. You were
[1:36:25] sons and daughters of God. But you were
[1:36:28] you are only the physical manifestation
[1:36:31] attribute that was in God at the
[1:36:33] beginning. But there is only one form of
[1:36:36] eternal life and that was you. uh that
[1:36:39] was you before. You don't know nothing
[1:36:42] about it. Neither did you know uh when
[1:36:45] you were in your earthly father, but you
[1:36:47] are manifested to his image. In the
[1:36:50] image of God, you are made and you were
[1:36:53] manifested for the glory of God. In the
[1:36:55] fellowship of God, I love that you were
[1:36:57] you were manifested for the glory and
[1:37:00] the fellowship.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Think about how much time you're going
[1:37:02] to fellowship with God today.
[1:37:05] And therefore, as soon as your gene had
[1:37:07] to be in your father before your natural
[1:37:10] birth, your spiritual gene had to be in
[1:37:12] God before your expression of the
[1:37:14] attribute of his thought before the
[1:37:16] foundation of the world. Right? No way
[1:37:18] around it. That's right. Now, we notice
[1:37:21] then that life being in you, God's life
[1:37:24] being in you from the foundation of the
[1:37:27] world. Now, I just got just a one one
[1:37:32] scripture I want to read. It's
[1:37:33] Colossians chapter 2 verse number 6 uh
[1:37:37] through 10. As ye have therefore
[1:37:40] received Jesus Christ Jesus the Lord, so
[1:37:44] walk in him. In other words, you hear
[1:37:47] the word, obey it.
[1:37:50] As we're married to Christ the word, so
[1:37:53] walk in his word. Rooted. Noticed you've
[1:37:57] been planted. You're rooted and built up
[1:38:00] in him. established in the faith as
[1:38:04] you've been taught, abounding therein
[1:38:06] with thanksgiving as
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; thankful for what God is doing in your
[1:38:10] life. Beware lest any
[1:38:13] any man spoil you through philosophy and
[1:38:18] vain deceit after the tradition of men
[1:38:21] and not and after the rudiments of the
[1:38:24] world and not after Christ. In other
[1:38:26] words, even though you're established
[1:38:28] with Christ, even though you were on
[1:38:31] fire with God and walking with God, you
[1:38:34] could allow a wrong spirit to come by
[1:38:37] you and influence you the wrong way and
[1:38:40] get you off track.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You're not immune to that. So, beware.
[1:38:46] For in Christ dwells the fullness of the
[1:38:49] Godhead body, and you are complete in
[1:38:54] him.
[1:38:55] which is the head of the principalities
[1:38:58] and powers. God is working on us. He's
[1:39:02] still in his mind. If you ever, what is
[1:39:04] God thinking about? What is God doing?
[1:39:06] What's on God's mind today is that God
[1:39:10] wants to make us in his image.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; That's what's on his mind. We need to
[1:39:15] get that in our mind. [laughter]
[1:39:18] God is still believing. He's still
[1:39:20] waiting. The Bible says, "Waiting for
[1:39:22] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; It does not yet appear what we shall be,
[1:39:27] but we know when he shall appear. We
[1:39:29] shall be like him, for we shall see him
[1:39:31] as he is."
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[1:39:35] God will have a word bride who will make
[1:39:38] herself ready for the rapture.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Plant it in your
[1:39:43] heart if you want to go in a rapture." I
[1:39:46] want to leave you with that. Plant the
[1:39:48] word in your heart. more more of the
[1:39:51] word. More of the word may have nothing
[1:39:53] to do with the rapture itself, but God
[1:39:56] wants you to become the manifested word.
[1:39:58] Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be like Jesus.
[1:40:03] Amen. On earth.
[1:40:06] On earth. I long to be like him.
[1:40:11] To be like Jesus.
[1:40:16] [music]
[1:40:17] to be like Jesus
[1:40:23] on earth. I love
[1:40:27] to be [music and singing] like him.
[1:40:32] All through life's journey
[1:40:35] [singing]
[1:40:37] [music] from earth to gloryy.
[1:40:41] [singing]
[1:40:42] I only [music] have
[1:40:46] to [singing] be like him.
[1:40:51] To [singing] be like Jesus.
[1:40:56] To be [singing] like Jesus. [music]
[1:41:02] on earth. I long
[1:41:05] to be [singing and music] like him.
[1:41:10] All through life's [music] journey
[1:41:13] [singing]
[1:41:15] from earth to [music] gloryy.
[1:41:20] I only have
[1:41:24] to be [singing] like him. [music]
[1:41:29] To be like Jesus. [singing]
[1:41:33] [music] to be like Jesus.
[1:41:38] On earth I long
[1:41:42] to be [singing] like him.
[1:41:47] All through life's journey
[1:41:50] [singing]
[1:41:52] from earth to glory.
[1:41:55] [music]
[1:41:57] I only have
[1:42:00] to [singing and music] be like him.
[1:42:05] Amen. That's a precious desire, is it
[1:42:07] not? Amen. [music]
[1:42:10] Oh, let's sing that chorus. Make me more
[1:42:12] like thee.
[1:42:15] Make
[1:42:17] me more like [singing] thee,
[1:42:22] [music] Jesus.
[1:42:24] Make me more [singing] like thee.
[1:42:28] [music]
[1:42:31] Give me a heart that's
[1:42:35] [music and singing] filled with love and
[1:42:39] make me more [singing]
[1:42:42] like thee.
[1:42:44] [music]
[1:42:46] Oh, make [singing]
[1:42:47] me more like thee,
[1:42:52] Jesus. [music and singing]
[1:42:53] Make me more like thee. [music]
[1:43:01] Only a [singing] heart that's filled
[1:43:05] [music] with love and make me more
[1:43:09] [singing]
[1:43:10] like thee. Amen.
[1:43:13] Oh, make [singing]
[1:43:16] me more like thee,
[1:43:20] Jesus. [music and singing]
[1:43:22] Make me more like thee.
[1:43:27] [music]
[1:43:28] Oh, give me a heart that's [singing]
[1:43:32] filled with love and make me more like
[1:43:39] thee. Amen. And as you continue to play
[1:43:42] that, let's just bow our hearts in a
[1:43:44] word of prayer. Maybe there'd be someone
[1:43:46] here today that say, "Brother John, I
[1:43:50] want my heart to be just like his.
[1:43:54] I want to be more in his image.
[1:44:00] You want to be remembered in prayer. I
[1:44:02] want to unite my faith with you today
[1:44:06] that God would grant the desire of your
[1:44:09] heart because we're all all wanting to
[1:44:12] be in his image. Amen. Amen. Just
[1:44:15] believe now. Oh, make us more like you,
[1:44:19] heavenly father.
[1:44:22] Lord, to have that desire is priceless
[1:44:26] because we know what happens if that
[1:44:29] desire isn't there. There's no pressing
[1:44:32] in.
[1:44:34] There's no seeking after. There's no
[1:44:37] becoming new. There's no all things
[1:44:40] becoming God. And Lord, you've placed
[1:44:44] that desire in our heart to be more like
[1:44:47] you, to be more in your image. Lord,
[1:44:52] we want to fulfill
[1:44:54] your word. Lord, I believe it's
[1:44:58] Revelations 19:7. And it says, "Let's
[1:45:02] rejoice and be glad
[1:45:05] because his wife have made herself
[1:45:07] ready."
[1:45:09] Lord, your word is what makes us ready.
[1:45:12] And Lord, we want to receive every word
[1:45:16] that you have for us. Lord, help us when
[1:45:19] we come to church, Lord, to have a heart
[1:45:22] more prepared.
[1:45:24] Lord, that we might leave with more of
[1:45:27] you, Lord. those whose hearts are
[1:45:29] prepared. I pray that you would fill
[1:45:31] them abundantly. Lord, may you give
[1:45:35] above whatever they're asking for. You
[1:45:38] said in your word that you are a God
[1:45:39] that that does more than what we ask,
[1:45:42] more than what we can think of because
[1:45:44] you are God that just loves us and wants
[1:45:47] to give to us more than we can even
[1:45:49] comprehend. Lord God, we're believing in
[1:45:52] you. We believe this word that you spoke
[1:45:55] to us today. We're thankful, Lord, that
[1:45:57] you sent a prophet, Lord, to give us
[1:45:59] insight to let us know that the word
[1:46:02] must become number one in our life. And
[1:46:05] Father, we we pledge ourselves to put
[1:46:09] you first. We commit ourselves to you,
[1:46:12] Lord. We plant your word in our heart,
[1:46:15] Lord. When we hear the word of God,
[1:46:18] we're going to follow. We're going to
[1:46:19] obey it. We're going to follow you all
[1:46:21] the way.
[1:46:23] And Lord, we believe that we're going to
[1:46:27] we're going to arise.
[1:46:29] We believe that we're we're going to
[1:46:34] be changed in the twinkling of an eye
[1:46:36] because we see ourselves changing here
[1:46:38] little by little from glory unto glory.
[1:46:41] Here a little, there a little. We're
[1:46:43] becoming more like you. We're becoming
[1:46:45] more in your image. Lord, what a a
[1:46:48] perfect testimony. What a perfect proof
[1:46:50] that we're going to be in going in a
[1:46:53] rapture because we're changing now.
[1:46:56] Lord, thank you for this. Grant to your
[1:46:59] children the very desires of their heart
[1:47:01] today. We love you and give you praise
[1:47:04] for these things now. [music]
[1:47:05] Be with those that are not here, Lord.
[1:47:08] Those that are on the live stream, Lord,
[1:47:10] with their hearts lifted up and their
[1:47:12] perhaps their hands, their desire to be
[1:47:15] in your image. Lord, I pray that you
[1:47:17] would grant to them the very thing,
[1:47:19] Lord, as if they were here in [music]
[1:47:21] the sanctuary building today. Grant it,
[1:47:24] Father. We love you and give you the
[1:47:26] glory for it all in Jesus Christ's
[1:47:28] precious name. Hey.
