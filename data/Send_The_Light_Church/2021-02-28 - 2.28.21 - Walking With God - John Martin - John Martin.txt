today as well may the lord jesus come to each one of us in a very personal way may we recognize him when he's coming to us and speaking to us and may he implant his spirit inside of us that we may be more like him amen that's all we all we want well god bless you i'd like to turn to matthew chapter four just read a few verses there um before we have you be seated and then we'll have a word of a word of prayer after we read these scriptures here in matthew chapter 4 verse 18. and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon and pete simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men and they straightway left their nets and followed him amen let's bow in prayer heavenly father lord what a privilege it is to even hear you call to us and to invite us to follow you and lord by your grace we standing here able to drop our past life to come and follow you and lord it's our desire to fulfill your will to to find the souls that you're leading us to and to be in your image lord that they may recognize that you are the same yesterday today and forever living in your people fathers we enter this part of the service lord we ask that you would bless every heart with revelation today of your precious word lord help me to be out of the way that you may be the way the truth and the life this morning to each heart lord we commit the service with the needs in our life lord you heard the the prayer request many that we've been praying for are very urgent lord we pray that the god of miracles would move upon many of these requests lord all over the world we thank you give you praise and honor for this for we ask it all in jesus christ's name amen god bless you may be seated before we start this the ministry of the word there was just a couple things that we wanted to share one was we have 11 open spots on the church cleaning sheet and so we're looking for 11 volunteers what do you mean we don't have that many people in our church so um i'd like to encourage uh to work for the lord i would say i mean you could do it unto the church i believe it'd be a blessing you know how it is when you want to do something for somebody but when you do it unto the lord you just don't lose your blessing no matter how you feel so uh we want to encourage that and then we have some missionary pictures from brother from brother boaz we'd like to show you now there were 13 souls that got baptized in cam reddy india and he distributed many uh bibles and message books and his most of you know that we are a supporter of our our brother amen so we're just going to go through these kind of quick like real quick because there's like there's many actually we're just going to show some isn't this beautiful we appreciate the lord using our brother to to be fishers of men one just one of those is worth ten thousand worlds this is the real beauty right here a soul our our church is so much nicer than that church right there but the beauty of the church is the character of the people amen praise the lord how many is excited god is still alive amen well one more thing i wanted to say about church order there have been improvements in our church how many can say praise the lord there's been some real improvements i've seen them i'm so grateful to the lord but there's still some areas that we need to keep pressing into because i'm going to be honest with you bad habits are hard to break but god deserves a greater reverence and that's that i want that to be the the focus or the motive um the first one that i have i just have three i want to touch uh getting to service i think is probably the most important one there's too many absences i believe god wants us to be more faithful he said well done thou good and faithful servant so faithfulness is important number two would be a lack of preparation i believe this is all part of the order either not getting to church on time or we're talking too much or just not praying enough either way there's a lack of preparation this is all part of order it's just part of order and then three is once church has started let's give god more reverence one church once church has started god is talking so stay seated my god can you imagine you're talking this time you have an interview with somebody and you just get up and walk away you know so when god's talking stay seated don't get up leave while god's speaking to you and i want to say when god is speaking to just sit there and say nothing the whole service by god's speaking to you i just don't think that's the lord brother graham told us that the holy ghost says amen to every word of god right now i'm not saying that we got to say it out loud but what i am saying is that you need to get involved with what god's speaking to you now to say more than so be it or amen we could be robbing god of attention because god is is got your attention he's trying to speak to you you just want to agree with the word so just reverently agree with the word and then respond to the word respond come come pray come seek the lord and or maybe stay in your seats and pray but just get real with god amen because that's what that's what this is all about amen amen well this morning we want to start with a little series walking with god and here starting off the bat jesus makes a call to follow me and i'll make you fishers of men but we know that there's more to to following god than just winning souls but what does it really take to follow the lord matthew chapter 16 verse 24 jesus said unto his disciples if any man come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me so these peter and his brother andrew um had when they when they made the decision to follow the lord to be a fisher of men they may have not known completely that they had to deny himself deny themselves and take up a cross but it was a requirement it wasn't just for certain people now for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever loses his life for my sake shall find it so if we if we make the choice not to follow the lord and we're because we're afraid to give up our will at the end we're going to lose it anyways and the thing is uh he says what what a man prophet if he gained everything that he could possibly want in this world and lose his soul and then he says it like this or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul what are you going to consider that's so much better than god's perfect will for your life in john chapter 16 verse 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but uh but you can't bear them now albeit when the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into walking with me into all truth amen so we're talking about following jesus today for he will not speak of himself now notice a spirit that's always is all about them all about them all about them how can that be the lord he's not speaking of himself jesus it wasn't about himself you have to deny the self it's about the purpose that god has absolutely for whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show them things to come romans chapter 8 verse 14 just laying the foundation before we get into this romans chapter 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god yes amen now notice it doesn't say they are sons of god are led by the spirit of god because we've heard that even when we were in sin we were still son of god and i know i wasn't being led by god the things i was doing so god lays claim as you're taking up his leadership now there's many things that he has to to say unto you to lead you with but it's up to us whether we're going to follow them or not jesus said my sheep my sheep hear my voice what do they do they follow whatever he says they follow that's right so if we're a son and daughter of god and and we're we're in tune with the spirit we're going to follow what he said and it's not going to be easy it's going to hurt because to the flesh we can't bear it now we actually need something about to bear this and it's the holy ghost and it helps us to bear the will of the lord amen so where are we following jesus too we could say that we're following jesus to win souls and we'd be right we could say we're following him uh to heaven and that would be right but one thing i would like to us to focus on is that we're following jesus to get prepared for heaven because as brother branham taught us that that we as people have this tendency to to look at a god in what he's done in the past and a god to what he's going to do in the future and missing god what he's doing right now and i believe that god is preparing us for the catching away he said in matthew chapter 7 verse 13 entering at the straight gate the straight gate he wants us to enter into verse 14 because strait is the gate and narrows the way which leadeth unto life and few be that find it notice the the gate in the way is leading us to life in other words we don't enter into it and then we're there right it's true we just know repent get baptized and we're there no we've entered into the way now we're in the way and we're heading there he that endured to the end the same shall be saved so there's a there's a path for us to fall to get there this morning i want to take a look at predestination and we'll take a look at working out our predestination it's true that every seed will bring forth of its own kind but satan is deceiving the whole world many will come to me in that day and say lord lord i thought it was predestinated i did all this and i thought it was the bible says that satan is deceiving the whole world we can see that out there naturally but spiritually amen we need to look at predestination just the way that we're told to look at salvation which is to work it out with fear and trembling not with an attitude of i'm saved i don't have to do anything breed us not to do anything [Music] and third i want to look at being conformed to christ being conformed to christ so taking our scripture here from romans chapter 8 verse 29 which was going to be my opening scripture amen for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brother now if anybody's got a brother that was born of the same parents there's no question and no doubt that your brothers and when we become born again and come into the image of christ we are a brother we are a brother we're joint heirs with christ the bible says now that word conform means jointly formed similar so we're not a tag-along we don't just belong to the church of god uh we are in god's image brother branham said in the message where i think pentecost failed he said predestinated it's not a very good word for an evangelist or a minister to use i feel okay because i'm a pastor because it confuses the people when you say predestination and we know where all confusion comes from we know where it originates from so satan loves to confuse the people with god's word so why does it confuse the people because satan can take the word and manipulate it in your mind in a number of different ways in one way satan wants people to feel like they're forced into a certain situation what i mean is well i must the way i feel i must be predestined to go to hell it's true you're pre you're going there this is the way you feel you can't change what you're doing he wants to force people like they're they're going in a certain direction but brother brandon said in the message the power of god speaking on predestination he said but god not making set it in order a little hole that you have to go through and you can't go no other way god never made it to where you have to you know you ever you push stuff through a little thing and you're making noodles or some sort of icing for a cake and you're pushing it through and it god never just chose us to be forced to go one way or the other way he said in other words god didn't say now i'll make this man this and i'll make this man to be that but in order to be god he had to know the end from the beginning brother and said foreknowledge is a better word to use because of god being omniscient or all-knowing by his great foreknowledge god knew what decision you were going to make before you were even aware of being that there was a god and that should give us confidence that god knows what we're going through knows our situations that he is a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities that he's able to make a way where there seems to be no he knows all about it amen so one way god uses predestination to make people feel trapped in their minds that they have no choice in the matter but another way that satan uses predestination is to make people feel so free in their minds that no matter what they're still going it doesn't matter how much you miss church doesn't matter if you don't pay your tithes it's okay it's okay to rob god doesn't matter if you don't worship the lord in spirit and truth as long as you're there it doesn't matter if you don't love everyone it's okay if you could if you talk behind people's back i'm still predestinated if satan doesn't use the word to trap you out he'll use the word to relax you in laodicea amen that's why the word is dangerous i want us to look at predestination in a way of foreknowledge god really knows what's going on in your life god really knows what you're you're doing with your decision making where you're putting your your your your direction to it in life if you notice predestination didn't make paul relax it didn't make brother branham lazy it didn't make any of his disciples to lay back so predestination shouldn't alter your state and that's what satan wants to do he wants us to to alter our way as long as i'm in the message as long as i believe the prophet as long as this is that whatever by god's great foreknowledge he saw before the foundational world that you were given the opportunity to serve him and that when you were given that opportunity to serve him he knew you would say yes i'm going to serve you lord so buy that he could elect you right he could choose you and say yes when that time comes and i make that call and i say follow me we'll drop our nuts and follow the lord amen amen because of that decision that commitment he could predestines to become in the image of his son let's take a look at jacob and esau for just a moment esau was born first according to the right he had the birthright or the right to the promise of being the firstborn so all the way up to the day that that his daddy prayed over him um the very promise of the firstborn he believed he was predestinated to it his whole life he believed he was predestinated because he was the firstborn but he had a lax attitude amen he kind of despised doing the things that he was supposed to do i say today we don't want to despise when god's trying to lead us to do his will we don't want to despise that because that's what esau did now jacob was not the firstborn but he longed to possess the birthright and he had a desire at all cost to get the promise of the firstborn like those believers who sell out to become born again praise the lord willing to give up everything amen that's what it takes go to extremes yes jacob went to extremes he was a little trickery guy but he wanted that birthright praise god for a mother that has a revelation from heaven because daddy didn't have it now daddy now i'm going to just say keep saying daddy but we are the children of abraham isaac and jacob amen now the thing is isaac didn't have a proper revelation of his two sons his whole life right to the end that's why we can't just walk around with this thought process of unpredicting i feel real comfortable in life we gotta work it out with fear and trembling we gotta be sure jacob worked out his salvation with fear and trembling esau didn't esau enjoyed the pleasures of doing what he wanted to do but because of god's grateful knowledge of their decision making he could say without respect to persons jacob have i loved in esau have i hated before they were even born because of his foreknowledge i want you to understand this god for knew you and i today yes amen god is looking to us to stay the path to keep going from the decision that we made to follow him with all of our heart we can't let anything in this world take us off the track church attendance won't get us into a rapture neither a lack of it will we got to get serious with god amen romans chapter 11 verse 2 says god have not cast away his people which he for knew which he foreknew so when you look at the decision you made to follow christ and to sell out to become him because that's what we're to become is him make sure you're not despising the things that god is asking you to do today yes amen because the attitude that esau had was i'm still the firstborn even my daddy agrees with it he's even put his arm around me and says you're the firstborn but yet he despised the things that he was supposed to do and we all of us sitting here today are told by god almighty to do things don't despise it in your heart say god i want to do it i'm going to submit to you i'm going to deny this flesh i'm going to follow you to the end amen amen work out those things with fear and trembling amen for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen now is paul saying here that we're going to somehow magically be changed into the image of christ is it going to happen in the just a twinkling of an eye when we become new creatures in christ do all things automatically become new on their own what is he saying here paul is telling us in romans chapter 8 that we are predestined to be jointly formed into his image but in romans 12 paul tells us to work at work out this predestination in a way in other words we have something to do about it if we don't have anything to do about then that means god does not go through free more agency and he has robots romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you therefore brother by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice just present yourself to god in church here i am lord say it like it is holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world that word conform it means different than what it does in 829 it means to fashion yourself amen we don't want to fashion ourselves just like how the world feels about church how it feels about god's word how it feels i mean you've got churches out there of course we know that every church does not like our church we got churches out there you however you feel whatever you want you can go get it's like a smorgasbord you can find what you're looking for but we don't want to fashion ourself the way that other churches do we don't fashion ourselves the way the world does but be ye transformed or changed by the renewing of your mind amen by the way you think amen about things so from where we're at when jesus said to peter and andrew come follow me to where they were going to after the day of pentecost was a a a large distance because there was a period of time that they walked with jesus and they were still in their carnal flesh yes still wanting to serve jesus carnally with the sword and you know if they're not with us they're against us and didn't know what spirit they had and and this carnality if i'm better than soul and soul and but even though they were following jesus they were part of the miracles they were going to the services the revivals and the things were happening they still weren't there in his image yet amen and god is calling us to something greater than where we're at today [Applause] and we need to focus on that we get there we get there by the renewing of our mind that we may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for our life we've got to change the way we think about something if you always do what you've always done you're always going to get what you always got and if peter continued to say look i've done everything to follow you there's nothing else left for me to do if you're always going to think like i'm under i'm going to take the sword i'm going to die for you he would never be transformed to be able to prove what is the perfect will of god and the perfect will of god is to lay down your life when john saw the line of the tribe of judah what did he see when he looked a lamb slain he lay down his life that word transform mean change means metamorphosed to undergo a change in nature our nature changes by the renewing of the way that we think about things in other words god's gonna go through the three more ages he's not going to put you in a trial and put your head in a bucket of water and saying you're not pulling your head out of here until you say you'll serve me he's going to put you right in that trial and he's going to let you make a decision are you going to die out to your will are you going to love when you're not being loved are you going to give when when there's nothing else to give you got to change the way you think about things about everything paul tells us how to work out what we're predestined to be cut to become by continually changing different than what we're used to make different choices in our mind choices that are contrary to our normal carnal way of thinking it all starts in our mind brother braham said our mind is the womb to our soul amen as our eyes are to the womb of our soul eyes eyes but it all starts in our mind what we see what we think about our carnal flesh our carnal fleshly mind is always right in the way that we think the bible says a man is right in his own eyes he's always right in his own eyes romans chapter 8 verse 7 says because the carnal mind is enmity or hostile hatred against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so there's just this battle of the carnal mind that's why when we come into church we don't want to come into church with just the carnality with a carnal mindset because we're going to actually hate the word we're going to hate the word that god's given us that's why we have to deny yourself pick up our cross and follow him in other words it's not slightly different the way that we think is not slightly different than the way that god thinks it is totally different it's night and day difference and the only way we can be transformed into god's image is to be completely to completely renovate the way that we think we need to to gut out we need to gut the walls got the stealing tear everything out not just change a little different furniture not just switch churches we need to think completely different in our box renovate the place renovate the way we think about things in life not just about god but about everything how does god think about those things that you're thinking about amen philippians chapter 2 verse 5 paul said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus keeping in mind now we're being transformed by the renewing of our mind well i i don't want to just you know read a little book read a little quote read a little something and say well i need to kind of like look at things a little bit different that just won't work for me we need to possess the mind of christ and so paul is saying let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus so what is the mind of christ how does it think how does it process thoughts verse 4 says look not every man on his own things so one way that christ thinks is he doesn't think about himself right amen but every man also on the things of others now can you imagine if we're sitting here and nobody is selfishly thinking about what they want but they're actually coming to church and they're so concerned about the person they're sitting next to amen verse 3 let nothing be done through strife or vain glory in other words when you're working out a situation because you're having a a rough time with your boss or with somebody you don't have some sort of strife and you don't try to prove your right just to get vain glory but in lowliness of mine let each person esteem the other person better than themselves why this is if i got to think like that i might the whole way i think is going to be different but you're being you're being conformed to the image of christ this is what it means to walk with the lord philippians chapter 2 verse 7 says but jesus made himself of no reputation he took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashionism and he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so this is the mind of christ talking about the mind of christ the mind of christ spoke in john chapter 10 verse 15 as the father knoweth me even so i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep right this is the mind of christ what we just read there in philippians about esteeming others and it's not about your reputation and it's not about strife it's it's about esteeming others better than yourself this is what it means to lay down your your life for the other fishes right peter come follow me i'll make you fishers of men how are you going to do it by your own brains no amen by this shall men know you're my disciples when you have this kind of love one for another amen he says other sheep i must bring in you have other sheep god wants to use you to bring another sheep in other words you have a responsibility well how do i know that they don't come to me i don't feel that i you know what one day will stand before the lord we'll have to give an account what we did with our time i'd rather spend my time trying get nowhere than to sit there and say well i was right i didn't have any anyways don't let satan talk you into i can't let the lord talk you into is my responsibility therefore doth my father love me why does he love me because i lay down my life no man taketh from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down i have power to take it up again this commandment i received to my father see it going through free more agency not being pushed through a situation you have a choice to be conformed to the image of god lay down your life or say yeah it's not for me but don't you don't claim predestination do what you want to do you you received it you res you did not receive the revelation of predestination it is not going to alter your walk with the lord if anything it's going to make you sell out more first john chapter 3 verse 16 how be it perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us we should be doing the same thing laying down our lives for the brethren jesus gives his disciples the same commandment that the father gave jesus yes same commandment john 15 verse 12 this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you greater love have no man than this than a man laid on his life for his friends here my friends if you do whatsoever i command you now i know when i was first being introduced to the lord god was not my friend i was very content going to a catholic church didn't bother me to stand up kneel down watch the candle see the smoke go across here i was okay with that why because i didn't have to be transformed i'd have to change my nature i could keep my hair the way it was i could look like a girly i could wear my pink bell bottoms i can walk out of there and go do what i want to do but i wasn't being conformed to god praise god that the word saved us now we demonstrate by living a life that only christ can live in a human being amen john chapter 13 verse 34 a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another and by this all men shall know by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another in other words you can't do this on your own it's impossible for a human being to to display christ without the holy ghost as much as peter was sold out as much as he is willing to take that sword and die for jesus he did not have the power to lay down his life amen to be a lamb to be conformed into the way of jesus christ amen jesus had to rebuke him get behind me satan thou savers the things that be of men it's not going to only happen to me but you're going to have to lay down your life too that's exactly what he told them ain't no different this age this is our time this is our time this is our time to be christ think about it you're here without the prophet discerning thoughts intents of the heart without going through a prayer line and seeing things happen miraculously but you still believe the same word think about it more blessed are they that believe and have not seen right think about what you're at to you're not missing out amen you're on top the cream it floats to the top now the holy spirit wants to renovate our minds from a selfish way of thinking to a selfless way of thinking from loving lust to loving more from loving self to loving others from laying down your life for yourself right making time for yourself to laying down your life for others from esteeming yourself to esteeming others from your reputation to god's reputation what does god want you to do with your life to exalt his reputation amen amen this renovation of our mind is really the straight gate that jesus is admonishes really everybody to walk in but everybody won't it's not traveled by very many people why too difficult people want to do their own thing right amen the harder way for all of us is most likely going to be always god's way it's not going to be the easy way brother brahman said life was not meant to be easy it was not meant to be easy we strive for it to be easy i believe there are two major things that the church should be recognizing that god is leading us to god is leading us to win as many souls as possible that was the last great commission but god is also leading us to come into his image to the statue of a perfect man the holy ghost inside of us is the only thing that will produce that it's the only thing that's going to produce us to really have a burden for souls because to me man is selfish i'm going to cut down my neighbor i'm going to do whatever i have to do to get what i want but god's nature is i'm going to give up everything i have to help my neighbor amen only the holy ghost can produce that amen now if we choose to not follow god's leading then we're going to paralyze god from everything that he wants to do think about that how i can't just stand behind him i'm going to be pretty destinated into his image and it doesn't really matter what i do we've got to just cut that thing out of our head hold ourselves accountable brother branham said in the message my new ministry he said when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the harvest he said the harvest is ripe the laborers are few pray the lord of the harvest and he'll send laborers into his harvest how many remember that congregation says amen amen amen that's what you say amen he said well why would they have to pray to the lord of harvest to send laborers into the harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why he said god is so arranged that and he said listen to this now listen to this god has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and i free moral agency nobody's going to be in heaven accusing god that he's got a bunch of robots up there as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost then we are in god's will doing his program amen amen now the holy ghost i know is not leading me the broad way the easy way the do what you want way your predestinated way he's leading me the harder way this the straight way the straight narrow path is harder that's the way he's leading me and if i don't follow that leading i paralyze him from performing his image inside of me i hope you catch that we can't sit here and say i'm not i don't need to do that i'm still in it i don't go there you're paralyzing god he has to move through your mind through free more agency you've got to accept it you've got to say not my will thy will be done we've got too much of this i'm in the message i don't care if you're in the message let the message be in you that's what it's about and this message is constantly being ministered to us every single day we get up we get in our prayer closet we pray and god speaks to you he says this is what i want you to do you need to get serious about doing it i'll tell you i'll be the first to tell you you don't come in god's image by serving him for 30 years also about to say hey look here i'm there you don't do it like that it's all about your will denying yourself following what he tells you to do to go the harder way amen we're not rallying behind brother branham we're not rallying behind this thing called the message in the last age we're taking this glorious message and we're saying lord live this in me i surrender all to you amen that's what we're rallying behind the word of god made flesh again the bible says when peter when jesus asked peter to follow him he he dropped his nets straight away he he dropped his reputation he followed jesus and in matthew chapter 19 verse 27 it wasn't enough then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and follow thee what is left for me to do i already go to church already pay my tithe i've already accepted the message jesus said in the verdict i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory he also notices also shall sit upon the twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel we have to follow jesus into regeneration now that word regeneration it means rebirth a spiritual renovation is what it means so we have to follow god we have to follow the holy spirit we have to follow the leading of the holy spirit which is jesus in us to a regeneration a complete regeneration where he sits on the throne well what's the throne the throne is your heart you are the temple of the holy ghost he sits there in the throne of your heart first he judges your life he puts your life in order now we don't mind it when anybody comes over our house even somebody we don't like as long as we know they don't have to stay you come visit that's okay but just so you know you ain't stan i'll go to church i'll listen to it for an hour but let that word live inside me when he is lord of everything that's the throne of his glory i don't know when i look to the right or i look to the i don't know who's going i just know that i want to go i want to be in this image i want to crucify this flesh i'll tell you there's no hope for this world there's no hope i just wonder what brother brennan would preach today if he could see the condition of the world today the only hope that i have is to let them in the throne of my heart forget about this world time is coming we we we have something so precious and that's an opportunity god has given us an opportunity to allow him to be the the the god of glory inside of our hearts it's got to become more than just some head knowledge we got to become in his image so you become or share his glory when you become one with god when jesus christ has preeminence in your heart when you have surrendered your will completely to christ when he sits on the throne of your heart not controlling the world controlling you amen the heart becomes the throne of his glory where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty to change us from glory unto glory so it becomes more glorious the holy spirit wants to change us to become him john chapter 17 verse 20 neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through the word through their word that's why it's important when you speak speak god's word yes that they all may be one as thou father and me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me so right now while you've got one group trying to push one thing another group trying to push another thing and and and you know devil's author of confusion he don't care what's being pushed out there as long as it's not christ amen and so only thing we care about we know we cannot save this world we cannot turn this world around we cannot get enough people to stand up and say we've got the truth just follow us clean up this whole world it can never happen but but god wants to use us amen for those that are predestined for those that yet have to be saved yes that's all he wants because this world is destined to burn right amen it's going to be judged it's going to be burned and we don't care about it jesus said we're not of the world they are not of the world amen but he's placed us in the world amen to be a light yes to reach a soul that when we get to the other side you can stand and say lord here are the trophies that i present you [Music] that's the truth you will present someone to christ if now you will give an account for your time we have to be about the father's business we need to become one look at verse 22 and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them noah's it's tied with being one that they may be one even as we are one right when god sits on your heart one with your will you've surrendered your will there's where god gets glory he's not gonna get glory by john martin saying he's something people are going to look at me look at that monkey but when they see you lay down your life as christ laid down his life i in them and thou in me that they may be perfect one and that the world may know that i have that thou hast sent me and as and has loved them as thou has loved me think about it jesus wants the world know that you are his disciple and that you sent you're sending them to whoever you're talking to so when you're going and you want to witness to somebody you're talking to somebody god wants that person to know who you're talking to that god sent you to them because your job is to bring that person to jesus that's your goal to be a fisher of men not to prove they're wrong not to prove your rights but to prove that jesus christ is alive he's coming soon it's all the matters john chapter 14 verse 26 jesus said at that day he shall know that i'm in the father and he and me and i and you there's that day where that oneness is there amen the only way we can really become one with god is for you to give up your will there's no way you can hold on to your will and be one with christ he's not going to share his his glory with any flesh it won't inherit the kingdom amen [Music] now our oneness is going to happen we will manifest christ we will be conformed to the image of god because we've been predestined amen first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we sitting here today should be called the sons of god therefore the world doesn't even know it the world doesn't know us because it knew him not if it didn't know jesus it so makes sense that they don't know us you know in one way god wants everyone to know in one way right he died for the whole world he would that none would perish but in another way he's hid it from the spirits of the wise and prudent from those that just want to mock it and turn it down and spit on them anyways yes sir right yes beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear right what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we're going to be like him now that word like him means similar in character that's something that i can have today amen that's not something i have to wait for a twinkling of an eye or at the end or when i get on the other side i have to make better decisions in the middle of my trials that's how i get character for we shall see him as he is you know how many times you're talking to somebody say well the white the way i think it is the way i see this the way i look at jesus everybody's got their own opinion right in other words we really don't see clearly but when you become him you see things clearly you see him clearly the only way you can know him is to become him because he hid it from this he's revealed it to this now look at this verse verse 3 and every man that has this hope in him purifyeth himself even as he is pure he does something he does something to purify himself what does he do he agrees with the word that's been given to her amen the groom gives the bride the word the bride agrees with it and the word is not always your pre just say don't worry about it which there's truth to that i'm not taking it away but what makes that so dangerous we don't feel like working anything out we're not going to purify anything we need to get busy at purifying ourself changing the way we think realizing that we have about a short time to get ready to get conformed into his image because he's coming back for his the other half of him amen he's not coming back for opposites right opposites attraction that's why we got in so much trouble so are we getting trouble but in reality he's coming back for the other half of him amen and where's that at it's inside of you amen that's why it's important to be serious about the word to become the word not just to agree with it but to become it god is not going to do one thing by himself to change you god doesn't have robots he will always work through your free more agency you've always got to agree with it before he'll do the change god will lead and guide you into your change he promised when the holy spirit come he'll lead guide you to all truth well what is the truth he wants for you to change and to become in his image not just well this is the correct baptism right right the change of your character but god is not going to change you without you i love being predestinated i love that god is predestined me predestinated me into his image yes but what that really means to me is that my flesh is gonna have to suffer to be crucified and i'm gonna have to mortify the deeds of the body amen the deeds of my body that's what that really really means [Applause] in the beginning god created when he originally created man he created man in his own image just he's by the spoken word he spoke it and man was in his own image today we were born with a nature that is satanic it is so unlike god speaking of character now and now we by his spoken word are being conformed into that same image that was created at the beginning now you tell me how we're going to get there without trying yes yes without belief we won't get there but the belief is that we have to surrender to the whole word of god it ain't believing sitting on a hammock it's believing when you get put through that trial you're you're conforming to the image the way that god would handle that trial first we must be conformed to god's way of thinking about things we must let the mind of christ that be in us we're not going to make it without it god's word must become the absolute for the way that we live we live the way christ lived everything that christ did we do he lived for others we live for others he lay down his life for the world we lay down our lives for the world he denied making himself a reputation we deny making ourselves a reputation he prayed for his enemy we pray for our enemies he loved everyone we love everyone he didn't have respect to persons then we don't have respect to persons he exercised forgiveness then we exercise forgiveness so when you do what christ done then you're in his image why would you stop short of pressing in until you've seen it just because pray destination you have to be conformed into every one of these things yes conformed to it and i'll say it like this transformed by the way that you think a lot of times we think what does it matter it's not fair i shouldn't have to go through this you got to change the way that you think right everything that christ went through down here was not fair he's the lord of lords the king of kings he didn't have to come down here he shouldn't have had to come down here he suffered at the hands of men and we think we're going to make it on flowery beds of ease just because he predestinated us must jesus bear the cross alone there's a cross for every one of us and the cross is crucifying the flesh forgiveness is a characteristic of the image of christ forgiveness started with god and it continues on manifesting through you and i because you're in his image you were forgiven by god a debt that you could not pay back right it was impossible to pay god back and now you have been given the opportunity to forgive others a debt that they can't pay back to you i want you to think about that i want you to think about the things that people have said to you done to you and and you that feeling and having that there in your life but you've been given an opportunity to forgive them just like christ forgave you a debt that could not be paid [Music] so what are you going to do with your opportunity will you display the image of christ or will you display your own image amen will you expect more from them will you feel deemed them unworthy to be forgiven you hold things against them see it's not about being predestinated friends it's about working out your predestination by proving that you're in the image of christ today forgiveness is like a key that unlocks the door to more of the image of christ most view that in order for a person to move forward with god you must be able to forgive others because that's what jesus he spoke that he made it clear he says if you forgive not mend their trespasses then your forgiveness basically stops right that's right i want us to take a look at this from a standpoint of just love for just a moment just love god loved the world but he could not move forward with them until he forgave them and that's why he went to calvary so he could put it behind them broke the middle wall partition down and had fellowship and communion with his bride again he could not move forward without forgiveness forgiveness brought them back in harmony with god and the true evidence of god's forgiveness was when jesus laid down his life at calvary and today you cannot move forward with that person without forgiving them your love is so important to bring them back into harmony so it's not just a law that god put out it's about being family we're all guilty amen every single person is guilty we have to learn to exercise that great key of forgiveness it shows and proves you're in the image of christ it is the image of christ from a standpoint of love you can't move forward with anyone until you forgive them forgiveness is who christ is 7 times 70 he said i'll just say it like this as long as somebody's got breath in them there's hope forgive him we must be conformed to his image we must let go of grudges put things behind us we must let go and forgive because we've been predestinated to become just like jesus i want to say it like this if you never heard the word message and you never heard the word william branham you have heard the message that christ wants you to hear god sent a prophet to get us that message you don't need to tell people about william branham even though you should even though you should but just saying here's william branham isn't going to attract them [Music] but when they see jesus in you when you're able to lay down your life when you get hit on the face you get taught by you get stabbed in the back you get treated like nothing and you still love as they're their best friend amen i'm personally thankful for the privilege of being able to show mercy to others because it shows that i'm being conformed into the image of christ head knowledge isn't the image of christ head knowledge won't conform to showing mercy head knowledge is going to say you're guilty we all know we're guilty amen we all can stand up here and judge every single person in this church of something it's true and if you don't know that much about that person talk to him a little bit and then you'll know but we have no problem judging anybody we're built for it but christ is decreasing us i must decrease that he must increase that we may show mercy show grace show love come in the image of christ i want to end with this quote here that brother branham preached an adoption number four part four he said it's all about love yes everything now speaking of adoption here he'll end with it everything is real brother everything is real sister he's speaking of when he crossed the other side he's sharing it he said there's no death there's no sorrow there's no jealousy no nothing nothing can enter there it's just perfection amen he said that's what i'm striving for not one i'm pretty destinated too he said that's what i'm striving for we've got to work out our predestination [Music] he said that's what i'm placing for i love this quote now it's short so pay attention i said oh lord that's what i'm here at the church for i'm trying to set the church in order telling you brother sister there's only one thing that can enter that and that's perfect love not because you're loyal to branham tabernacle or the methodist church or the baptist church them is all right you should be but old friends not because you spoke in tongues danced in the spirit because you cast out devils or moved mountains with faith he said that's all right for that's all right says it twice but still unless the real perfect love is in there that's that was where perfect love was now listen to this sentence and that's the only thing that will let you in there that's the only thing that will let you in there that's the only thing that can stay there it's the only thing that was there oh my it's an adoption yes that's what we're being adopted too to the image of christ to being able to manifest it and and brother sister you can go home today with the desire in your heart lord let the first trial come and let me let me shine for you let me display you that's all that matters who cares about telling anybody anything just live it right live out perfect love amen amen he said god before the foundation of the world we've been predestinated to this perfect love before the foundation of the world we just didn't understand because we grew up in a bunch of selfish stingy love and then we come into this message trying to you know find our place on you know how do i act and you know still holding on to part of the world and trying to love but not being able to do it and just you know trying to you know have a form but the holy ghost will take you all the way amen it'll stamp his image in you amen if you want it you hunger for it you thirst for it you desire it god promised to fill you it's a promise but it ain't happened as much as you want i say hunger more there's more cry out for god more amen you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all thy heart it won't be for those who could take it or leave it i'll tell you that because brother branham said this harder way is so he says you've got to actually get to the place where you can love everybody in fact he said i don't care what's important to you you must lay aside everything else until you can get to that place where you can love everyone the same that means you're caring about their reputation as much as you're more than yours amen you care about esteeming your enemy more than yourself get to that place lay everything else aside that means you've got to really want it bad amen let's stand together god bless you god is leading you to be conformed to his image what an honor what a privilege that god called us and that we recognized amen the call amen praise the lord well we're gonna maybe sing some acapella i'm not sure if we got a piano player yes i hear the doors opening praise the lord and it's it's truly my fault i just want to make that clear because my precious wife has said it a few times to me i'll make sure you make time for me to get in there so that is not her that's on me we appreciate her very very much amen amen i just wanted to see that little chorus make me more like thee amen real simple but think about these words now make me more like thee jesus make me more like thee oh give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee o make me more like thee jesus make me more like this give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like me [Music] oh may me more like thee jesus make me more likely give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more likely if we could just say that without music for a second close your eyes just sing it real to him as a prayer make me more like thee jesus make me more like thee give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like amen with our with our heads bowed now eyes closed let's just let's continue that that uh desire and prayer and let's just all go to the lord in prayer and just make it known to him how much you desire to be more like him at this time father we come to you as a body of believers today knowing that you see every one of our hearts you're hearing every one of our prayers right now desiring to be more like thee lord to be in your image and to be filled with your love oh god hear our prayers today lord make us more like you fill us with that perfect love lord that we may display you to the whole world no matter what our situation is no matter what we're going through no matter what's happening lord that we can display your image lord for you have predestinated us to that no god oh i just pray for every heart father perhaps there's someone here today lord that's just discouraged father feeling that they've uh lord uh stumbled so much that that that you wouldn't hear their prayer but oh god i just rebuke all the lies of the devil today lord you've come today with a message to set us free today lord and i pray father lord your blood has covered us of our sins lord you put them in the sea of forgetfulness our past is the past and lord if there's anything lord that you brought to our attention father that we haven't put in the past at this moment lord we put it under the blood we we're sorry for our sins lord we're sorry for the past lord we pray that you take it from us that we may stand clean and white and purify in your sight at this time lord for you said that he that has this hope purifies himself even as he is pure and today lord we want to become more like you lord we want to listen to you more we want to follow your leadership more we want to do the things that you called us to do that you've asked us to do in our homes under jobs in the church and in the work of the lord lord whatever it would be we just want to follow you that straight a narrow path oh granted today lord lord we want to be in your image and when that time comes lord when you call us up yonder to enter into that place lord we want to be standing there oh we want to be standing there oh lord jesus as trophies presented by you by your prophet lord in this message that we believe the message of this bible we believe it lord is the same that we love our brothers oh god grant it to be so lord jesus may not one person under this voice be missing may they not miss it lord may they be there in that day i pray in the name of jesus christ oh granted lord fill us with the holy spirit lord make it so make it so we thank you for these things we humbly pray them in your precious name amen let's play that now of you i've had it all but what i need is just more of you [Music] lord hear my prayer for more of you [Music] just more of you amen more of you i've had it all but what i need is just
