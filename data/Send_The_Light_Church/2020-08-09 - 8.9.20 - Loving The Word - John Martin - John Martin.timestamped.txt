[40:04] christ's name
[40:05] amen amen deuteronomy chapter 6
[40:09] starting with verse number 4 hear
[40:14] o israel
[40:17] the lord our god is one lord
[40:21] and thou shalt love the lord
[40:25] thy god with all thine heart
[40:28] with all thy soul and with all thy might
[40:32] amen these words which
[40:35] i command thee this day shall be in
[40:39] thine heart
[40:40] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[40:42] unto thy children
[40:45] and shall talk of them when thou sittest
[40:47] in thine house
[40:49] and when thou walkest by the way
[40:52] and when thou liest down at night and
[40:56] when thou
[40:57] risest up in the morning
[41:00] thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[41:04] thine hand
[41:06] and shall be as frontlets between thine
[41:09] eyes
[41:11] and thou shall write them upon the post
[41:15] of thy house
[41:17] and on thy gates amen god bless you may
[41:20] be seated
[41:22] on the title this message
[41:25] love the word amen the word and for
[41:29] a subject i want to talk about loving
[41:32] god
[41:34] outside of his word
[41:38] loving god outside of his word
[41:42] jesus referred back to this very same
[41:45] commandment that we
[41:46] read this morning one time when he was
[41:48] talking to a lawyer that was trying to
[41:50] tempt him and we can find this in
[41:52] matthew 22
[41:53] 36 when this lawyer
[41:57] was tempting jesus you know
[42:00] he didn't like the ministry of jesus
[42:03] because it wasn't quite like moses
[42:06] the prophet jesus uh he asked he said
[42:10] master
[42:11] which is the great commandment in the
[42:14] law
[42:14] because see jesus said
[42:18] i am the way to god
[42:21] and he didn't like that so he's saying
[42:24] master what's the great
[42:26] commandment in the law and jesus said
[42:28] and thou
[42:29] shalt love the lord thy god with all thy
[42:32] heart
[42:33] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[42:37] he said this is the first and great
[42:40] commandment but you notice he didn't
[42:42] stop there
[42:43] because this lawyer didn't want to
[42:46] fulfill
[42:48] the word amen
[42:51] and he said the second is like unto it
[42:53] that thou shalt love
[42:54] thy neighbor as thyself and jesus said
[42:56] i'm your neighbor
[43:00] of these two commandments hang all the
[43:02] law
[43:03] and all the prophets yes amen if we can
[43:06] get this straight
[43:08] amen everything else will just turn out
[43:11] right
[43:12] [Music]
[43:13] too often we try to love god and
[43:17] make our own personal choices about
[43:18] loving our neighbor
[43:21] loving god ought to be the center theme
[43:25] of all of our lives appreciated that
[43:27] song this morning
[43:28] i believe it was the right time for that
[43:30] psalm
[43:32] but reality we become satisfied with
[43:36] only loving god with
[43:37] some of our mind some of our
[43:41] our our heart and and some of our
[43:45] strength or some of our might if i could
[43:47] say it like that
[43:48] we ought to be pressing towards loving
[43:51] god
[43:52] with everything because in the end
[43:55] that's all that's really going to matter
[43:59] in reality the human nature that we're
[44:02] born with
[44:04] isn't doesn't gravitate to loving god
[44:07] first
[44:09] and if it does try to do it
[44:13] it usually has some selfish motive of
[44:15] what they can get out of it
[44:18] that's why at times church seems
[44:22] to be hard for us we can take it or
[44:25] leave it basically
[44:27] but when god's nature is preeminent
[44:30] you cannot wait till those doors are
[44:33] open
[44:34] abandoned had made some strong
[44:36] statements about loving god he said we
[44:38] could love
[44:39] god and still miss it at the end
[44:44] that's a hard one to understand when the
[44:45] bible says that nothing can separate us
[44:47] from the love of god
[44:49] in christ jesus i'll say it takes a
[44:52] tremendous amount
[44:53] of effort to love god with everything
[44:56] right with all thy might
[45:00] our strength all of our our mind with
[45:02] all of our thoughts
[45:04] with all of our efforts to love him in
[45:07] every
[45:08] possible way it's almost like a new
[45:11] religion
[45:14] amen because people feel they they have
[45:17] a choice and
[45:18] they can still love god as much as they
[45:20] do and everything is okay
[45:24] is it okay with god that's what matters
[45:28] each and every one of us should keep
[45:31] pressing
[45:31] towards maintaining the commitment
[45:34] of loving god every day with everything
[45:38] brother branham said in the message
[45:40] influence of another he says when
[45:42] you leave god out of anything i want
[45:45] you to leave me out of it too
[45:50] brother brandon said because you must
[45:53] always remember
[45:54] god first yes
[45:57] the devil don't care if you're not doing
[46:00] horrible things
[46:01] as long as you're putting god second yes
[46:06] most people don't realize almighty god
[46:08] will not take second place
[46:12] to anyone to anything amen
[46:16] he may use second place but he'll not
[46:18] take it
[46:20] exodus 20 verse 3 says thou shalt have
[46:23] no
[46:23] other gods before me god wants to be
[46:26] first amen
[46:29] not only are we to keep god first by
[46:31] loving him with all
[46:32] our lives but we need to teach the same
[46:35] to our children
[46:36] to our families the words of of loving
[46:39] god with all of our lives
[46:42] in deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 7
[46:45] they need to be taught diligently
[46:49] unto our children yes these words
[46:52] that that god that that moses
[46:55] through the inspiration of god was
[46:57] commanding the children of israel
[46:59] to love the lord god with everything
[47:03] those words shall be in your heart and
[47:05] they shall be taught
[47:07] diligently unto thy children
[47:11] and thou shalt talk of them
[47:14] when you're sitting down in the house
[47:17] what you think about sitting with your
[47:19] children
[47:22] and when they'll get up to to walk
[47:24] somewhere
[47:26] maybe to go outside or go to the store
[47:30] and when thou takes a nap
[47:35] or goes to sleep at night amen
[47:38] talk about him and when you get up in
[47:41] the morning
[47:43] talk about loving god first now this is
[47:46] the word of the lord
[47:49] this love of god must diligently be
[47:53] taught to our children and if we don't
[47:55] do it who's going to do it
[47:57] [Applause]
[47:59] amen all of our might strength and mind
[48:03] should be used to love god with
[48:05] everything and in every way and to teach
[48:08] our children the same with a diligent
[48:11] fashion now this
[48:12] is a full-time job i don't even know if
[48:14] i've got time to do anything else
[48:20] and thou shalt bind them verse 8 for a
[48:22] sign
[48:23] upon thine hand and thou and they shall
[48:26] be as frontlets
[48:28] between thine eyes yes god
[48:32] likes signs to be posted
[48:35] but not on the wall but posted on our
[48:39] lives
[48:41] when people see everything that our
[48:44] hands do
[48:45] they ought to see us loving god
[48:48] and when they look into our eyes they
[48:51] need to see the love of god in our eyes
[48:53] amen
[48:55] they need to see it on our faces thou
[48:58] shalt write them upon the post of thy
[49:00] house none thy gates
[49:03] a lot of times you see people putting up
[49:05] signs at the
[49:06] at the gates of their property at the
[49:08] end of their driveway and
[49:10] some sort of uh sign that they what they
[49:13] like
[49:14] and what they believe in and maybe they
[49:16] put up a state sign or a u of m flag or
[49:19] something to kind of let
[49:20] all the people that are driving by know
[49:22] where they stand
[49:24] and god wants people when they see us
[49:28] to see the sign that we love god first
[49:31] in our lives
[49:33] and they need to see it first impression
[49:35] amen as they enter into our lives
[49:40] god wants us to display the theme of
[49:43] loving god
[49:46] loving him and teaching everyone
[49:49] especially our children
[49:51] this great commandment i want to say
[49:54] today
[49:55] loving god is not enough
[49:58] we've got to love him with all of our
[50:00] heart
[50:01] yes amen amen amen don't come
[50:04] short of the word all right all of our
[50:08] mind all of our strength
[50:09] all of our spirit all of our soul that's
[50:12] the thing we take
[50:13] for granted that we think we do
[50:18] but if we do it'll be so apparent
[50:22] it'll be so apparent everybody will be
[50:24] gravitated to being around you
[50:27] they will want what you got
[50:31] amen amen
[50:34] teaching our children to love god with
[50:36] all of our heart
[50:37] our mind our strength it's god's
[50:40] commandment
[50:42] and anything short of his commandment
[50:45] is simply a definition of your love
[50:53] anything short of the commandment
[50:56] is your love because god's commandment
[50:59] is all
[51:02] and we shouldn't stop there with just
[51:04] loving god with everything we have
[51:06] we need to take it to the next level we
[51:08] need to
[51:09] to love others as we love ourselves
[51:13] right love thy neighbor as thyself
[51:17] we've got to love others how god has
[51:20] loved us and how has he loved us
[51:22] unconditionally to teach
[51:26] them to teach our children to love god
[51:30] with all of our
[51:32] with all their strength with all their
[51:33] might with all their spirit
[51:36] and soul and if we do not
[51:39] teach them that same right we are
[51:42] only loving them with our love
[51:48] and our love comes up short
[51:52] amen i don't want a definition of my
[51:54] personal love
[51:55] i want a definition of god's love
[52:00] now you might say i'm not i'm not
[52:02] turning
[52:03] my cheek for a person who's just going
[52:06] to mistreat me again
[52:10] i'm not going to let them use me again
[52:12] take advantage of me again
[52:15] i'm not going to go the the second mile
[52:17] i'm not even going to give them the
[52:18] second inch
[52:21] i'm not going to forgive them again
[52:22] they're just going to do it again to me
[52:24] how many times you expect me to forgive
[52:26] anyways
[52:28] i've bailed them out so many times i'm
[52:30] done with it enough is
[52:32] enough anything
[52:35] short of loving your neighbor as
[52:37] yourself is a definition
[52:39] of your love doesn't matter if you claim
[52:43] god's love now
[52:50] when people hear about you
[52:55] let them hear that you love
[52:58] unconditionally
[53:01] and that will be a definition of god's
[53:03] love
[53:06] so it's not about you loving god or
[53:08] having
[53:09] the love of god in your hearts
[53:13] it's about loving god with everything
[53:18] so it can be manifested to those who
[53:20] don't possess it that's the important
[53:22] part
[53:23] by this great loving commandment shall
[53:26] all men know that i have chosen you
[53:28] to be my disciples otherwise everybody's
[53:32] claiming to be his disciple
[53:33] yes amen it's not what we claim
[53:39] it's his love abroad in our heart
[53:41] by the holy ghost being manifested
[53:44] to those who are mistreating us
[53:47] anybody can love somebody that loves
[53:49] them anybody can get along with somebody
[53:52] that wants to get along with them
[53:53] show me somebody who will lay down their
[53:55] life when they're being stepped on
[53:58] and i'll show you somebody who has god
[54:01] inside of them
[54:03] because only god can do that amen
[54:08] most people getting their beard pulled
[54:10] out or the blood running off their head
[54:12] or
[54:13] just want to tell them they're doing
[54:16] wrong they shouldn't do that
[54:21] so if loving god is the most important
[54:23] thing
[54:24] we can do and that's the thing that the
[54:27] only thing that really matters why is it
[54:29] so hard
[54:30] for me to put god first to love
[54:33] god first why are we loving
[54:38] him more it's because of our selfish
[54:42] flesh
[54:44] our carnal nature amen it's all
[54:48] it's all about me attitude our mindset
[54:52] brother branham said that our greatest
[54:55] enemy
[54:56] was ourself
[54:58] [Music]
[54:59] i want to stay away from that person i
[55:01] want to stay away from the devil
[55:03] i'll tell you your greatest enemy is the
[55:05] person you're stuck with
[55:09] is standing in the way of victory amen
[55:13] we learn wednesday night that jesus
[55:16] wants us to learn
[55:17] how to die daily
[55:21] remember what god spoke to brother
[55:23] branham
[55:24] he said this in itself basically the
[55:28] choice that you've made to deny
[55:30] yourself and choose the harder way to
[55:34] deny
[55:34] it's all about me attitude
[55:38] this in itself will bring the past that
[55:41] tremendous
[55:42] victory in love divine
[55:45] if we don't deny ourselves how do we
[55:48] expect
[55:48] to ever get filled with the love of god
[55:52] amen you can't make god loves
[55:57] you can't make god love you
[56:00] you can't make god love through you
[56:03] it's a relationship
[56:08] oh wretched man that i am
[56:12] who's going to deliver me from this body
[56:14] of death yes
[56:16] we need a great delivery amen yes amen
[56:20] every single hour of every single day
[56:25] to save our wretched self
[56:28] yes when i was
[56:32] without christ in my personal life i
[56:35] thought i was an okay person
[56:38] i was in the world doing all the the
[56:40] worldly things that everybody else was
[56:42] doing
[56:46] and you you notice those who are a
[56:49] little bit worse than you
[56:52] and when i looked at them enough
[56:56] it helped me to feel that i was just a
[56:59] little bit better i was an okay guy
[57:00] because i wasn't doing what they were
[57:02] doing
[57:03] but i was blind i was blind
[57:08] little did i realize i had a
[57:11] devilish self-tendered nature just as
[57:14] them
[57:16] i was spiritually dead in sins and
[57:18] trespasses
[57:20] walking according to the spirit of this
[57:22] world i just didn't realize it
[57:24] the bible tells us it's the very same
[57:27] spirit of disobedience that's now
[57:29] working in the chil in children and
[57:32] adults
[57:34] and adults amen i was simply carrying
[57:38] out the nature
[57:39] that i was born with fulfilling the
[57:42] desires of my mind
[57:43] and my flesh and the lust that was
[57:45] inside i was
[57:46] simply by nature a child of wrath
[57:51] but i was still good enough
[57:57] i didn't need anything else
[58:01] because everybody else was doing the
[58:04] same thing
[58:07] until one day god showed me how
[58:10] horrible i was and when god shows you
[58:14] how horrible is
[58:15] then you realize you need to be born
[58:18] again
[58:20] but as long as you think you're good
[58:22] enough because you go to church
[58:24] because you do these things
[58:30] you never see a need for the new birth
[58:35] the revelation of the new birth comes
[58:37] when you realize
[58:40] that you're lost that a man at his very
[58:43] best is all vanity
[58:46] and there's no way we can make it find
[58:49] favor in the sight of god outside of a
[58:52] new birth
[58:54] ephesians 2 verse 4 but god who is rich
[58:58] in mercy praise god
[59:01] you know when you need somebody
[59:05] you don't you need money you don't go to
[59:08] a pover uh
[59:09] somebody in poverty
[59:13] you go to somebody that's got the goods
[59:14] somebody's got the money
[59:17] yes i need some money
[59:23] but you know you you should do it humbly
[59:25] or a better chance of getting it
[59:30] but we need mercy mercy rewrote my life
[59:34] god who is rich in mercy for his great
[59:37] love
[59:38] so great wherewith he loved us
[59:42] even when we were dead in sins have
[59:46] quickened us together
[59:48] with christ how many has been quickened
[59:51] that puts you in the family of god that
[59:55] makes his brother branham says overalls
[59:58] uh hug somebody in a tuxedo
[1:00:02] it's the love of god amen by grace
[1:00:05] you're saved
[1:00:06] he loved me when i was a sinner and i
[1:00:10] didn't even know it
[1:00:12] and you know what he did he didn't say
[1:00:15] the same thing the devil told me which
[1:00:17] is you're an okay guy
[1:00:19] right don't you worry about it you're
[1:00:21] gonna make it
[1:00:23] i love you no he says as many as i love
[1:00:26] i rebuke i chase sin right
[1:00:30] amen you're not in a condition to make
[1:00:33] it into the kingdom
[1:00:34] amen only the blood of jesus christ can
[1:00:38] put us in there amen
[1:00:42] to think that god loves you as a good
[1:00:44] person
[1:00:45] just doesn't do so much for you does it
[1:00:49] it won't change you it'll make you feel
[1:00:52] yeah of course
[1:00:53] i mean god even sees i'm a good person
[1:00:57] but when you realize that you're the
[1:00:59] biggest
[1:01:00] sinner on the planet amen
[1:01:04] and god still loves you as a sinner
[1:01:09] that'll turn your heart around amen
[1:01:11] that'll do something for you
[1:01:13] god loves to change your life
[1:01:19] from the moment that he changed your
[1:01:21] life every person that has had that
[1:01:23] experience
[1:01:24] ought to be putting their roots in that
[1:01:26] love
[1:01:28] but i'm sad to say that the majority of
[1:01:30] the people experience the love of god
[1:01:33] resort to only having that love
[1:01:36] to be a part of their lives
[1:01:39] they want to keep that love with them
[1:01:43] but they never put their roots in that
[1:01:44] love
[1:01:47] maybe they want to keep it with them
[1:01:50] when it's convenient
[1:01:52] or they may need it
[1:01:55] god's love should not only change us
[1:01:59] but it should continuously be changing
[1:02:02] us
[1:02:02] until we leave here
[1:02:06] i don't need to change anymore is to
[1:02:08] tell me that
[1:02:09] you're defining the fullness of god in
[1:02:12] your life
[1:02:14] whoa i don't know why that was so quiet
[1:02:16] there should have been some amends in
[1:02:18] there
[1:02:20] to pack around an attitude
[1:02:24] that i don't need to change anymore that
[1:02:26] i have changed enough
[1:02:28] is telling me that you've got the
[1:02:31] fullness of love of christ in your life
[1:02:34] [Music]
[1:02:37] well i don't like saying amen to my word
[1:02:40] but i believe that's the word of god
[1:02:43] and i want to say amen to that
[1:02:46] there's a reason that the apostle paul
[1:02:49] said i'm pressing towards the mark
[1:02:51] because his matter no matter how much
[1:02:53] revelation he had how much of god that
[1:02:55] he had
[1:02:58] he still realized that there was more
[1:03:00] for him amen
[1:03:04] too often we get satisfied like
[1:03:07] because of this much god i got my life i
[1:03:10] kind of like where in the world well i'm
[1:03:11] not as bad as that person
[1:03:13] not as bad as that believer going to
[1:03:15] church not as bad as that one calling
[1:03:17] himself a christian
[1:03:19] that one who says they love god
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:28] i honestly love
[1:03:32] the opportunity to love somebody
[1:03:37] who's out of the way
[1:03:41] and i'm not talking about people who
[1:03:44] don't know
[1:03:45] christ i'm talking about people who
[1:03:49] claim
[1:03:50] to be christians to know god
[1:03:54] who simply do not see where they're at
[1:03:56] at the time
[1:03:57] amen and that's why they're acting the
[1:03:59] way they're acting amen
[1:04:01] paul told timothy to be an example to
[1:04:04] the believers
[1:04:06] we have a job to do we have a job to be
[1:04:09] christ to those
[1:04:10] around us the body edifies
[1:04:13] one another we grow
[1:04:17] together we don't rebuke
[1:04:20] together we don't just try to be some
[1:04:24] diamond one to another all the time
[1:04:27] even though it is scriptural but the
[1:04:30] thing is
[1:04:30] uh we need to love one another
[1:04:34] as we love ourselves now you know you
[1:04:37] love yourself because you took good care
[1:04:38] of yourself before you got into
[1:04:40] church today you wanted to look
[1:04:43] presentable
[1:04:45] you didn't want to look like a hobo
[1:04:49] but now if you can love me the same way
[1:04:51] take care of me
[1:04:52] the same way well
[1:04:56] i don't know if i can love john that
[1:04:58] same way why not
[1:05:00] why not that's right
[1:05:04] i need help i need your love
[1:05:09] i need the love of god in you to help me
[1:05:12] there will come a time that god will
[1:05:15] will expect you to demonstrate the love
[1:05:18] of god in your heart
[1:05:20] for me amen and for every other one
[1:05:22] that's in this church
[1:05:26] because the devil has the the great
[1:05:29] ability
[1:05:30] right while you're sitting in church
[1:05:33] looking up
[1:05:36] just like that lawyer wanted to
[1:05:39] tempt jesus because he he saw something
[1:05:43] in jesus that he didn't agree with
[1:05:46] yet he was flawless but the devil has a
[1:05:49] way
[1:05:50] of showing us things
[1:05:55] but where are you going to stand are you
[1:05:58] going to sit on the seat of the scornful
[1:06:01] are you going to sit on the seat of the
[1:06:03] judgment right right
[1:06:05] are you gonna come up and wash my feet
[1:06:11] you'll have an opportunity the person
[1:06:14] you're sitting next to the person that's
[1:06:15] behind you the person that's in front of
[1:06:17] you
[1:06:19] you know we got just as much falls as we
[1:06:20] got good things
[1:06:24] but the flaws aren't in the spirit now
[1:06:27] they're in the flesh
[1:06:29] love covers a multitude of flaws
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:33] the love of god is what we need today
[1:06:38] change your life psalms chapter 1 verse
[1:06:40] number 1 blessed
[1:06:41] is the man that walketh not
[1:06:44] in the counsel of the ungodly amen
[1:06:49] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[1:06:54] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:57] you're blessed in god's ways blessed is
[1:07:01] the man who's walking
[1:07:02] in god's ways
[1:07:05] but you know when we walked in the world
[1:07:07] they weren't god's ways
[1:07:10] amen but when you begin to walk in god's
[1:07:13] ways
[1:07:14] your life becomes blessed
[1:07:17] because jesus is a true friend he
[1:07:20] sticketh closer than any of your
[1:07:22] your other friends out there
[1:07:26] but his law but his delight
[1:07:30] is in the law of the lord
[1:07:33] and in his law doth he meditate
[1:07:37] day and night
[1:07:40] how many delights in the word of god
[1:07:42] today
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:07:45] it's where our love needs to be it needs
[1:07:48] to be in the word
[1:07:50] amen and he shall be like a tree
[1:07:53] planted by the rivers of water and
[1:07:55] bringing forth his fruit and his season
[1:07:57] and his leaf shall not wither and
[1:08:01] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[1:08:04] yes wow
[1:08:07] do you want your life to prosper more
[1:08:10] here's the answer delight yourself in
[1:08:13] the word of god
[1:08:14] amen delight yourself in it don't read
[1:08:18] it because well you know brother ben
[1:08:20] says every christian should read his
[1:08:22] bible every day
[1:08:23] you know i don't got quite time to do
[1:08:25] that so i just i just grabbed my little
[1:08:27] you know bread of life and just get my
[1:08:29] scripture for the day or my little
[1:08:31] phone app and you know boom oh yeah this
[1:08:33] is a good one i'll send it to so-and-so
[1:08:38] the light yourself in the word of god
[1:08:41] there's things in there
[1:08:43] that god wants you to know things he
[1:08:46] wants to bring back to your remembrance
[1:08:49] things he wants to be fresh to you to
[1:08:52] reveal to you
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:54] well you know the word has hit in my
[1:08:57] heart and i already got it
[1:09:04] you want to prosper
[1:09:08] put god first put god first
[1:09:13] we never want to be satisfied with god's
[1:09:16] love just
[1:09:17] being a part of our lives
[1:09:20] we don't want to have the mindset that
[1:09:22] we can just uh
[1:09:24] pull it pull it into our lives whenever
[1:09:26] we
[1:09:27] need it or just
[1:09:31] have it when it's convenient
[1:09:34] always remember whatever you're rooted
[1:09:37] in
[1:09:38] that's what you will become amen
[1:09:44] wherever your heart is rooted in
[1:09:47] that's what you will become amen
[1:09:51] is the scripture something about where
[1:09:54] your treasure is
[1:09:56] where your heart is there where your
[1:09:57] treasure be also somewhere there
[1:10:00] so you want your treasure to be in the
[1:10:02] love of god
[1:10:06] see most people just they want god's
[1:10:08] love there they want god's love to take
[1:10:09] them through they want
[1:10:11] god's love god to love them
[1:10:14] and that's they're okay with anything
[1:10:16] everything else it doesn't really matter
[1:10:20] and that's where they're missing a part
[1:10:22] of god
[1:10:27] the more that you're planted in god's
[1:10:29] love
[1:10:30] the more you'll be able to love just
[1:10:33] like god loves
[1:10:34] now that all be the desire of our hearts
[1:10:37] our lives
[1:10:38] is to be able to love like god loves us
[1:10:43] not just benefit from god loving us
[1:10:48] and not being able to love him back with
[1:10:50] that same love
[1:10:51] and how do we love god back with that
[1:10:53] same love
[1:10:54] not by sitting in church and just saying
[1:10:56] i love him i love him because he first
[1:10:58] loved me
[1:11:00] i'd get out of church and love somebody
[1:11:03] that's how you
[1:11:04] love god the same way that he loves you
[1:11:07] what good is it to have something and
[1:11:09] not be able to manifest it
[1:11:12] i mean god in heaven had a love that he
[1:11:15] wanted to express and he couldn't
[1:11:16] and he caused a situation to happen that
[1:11:19] he could save somebody that he could
[1:11:20] redeem somebody
[1:11:22] that he could heal somebody
[1:11:25] so what good would it be to have that
[1:11:27] love and not be able to express
[1:11:28] it it would be useless
[1:11:34] so look for an opportunity to love
[1:11:36] somebody that can't love you back
[1:11:42] look for an opportunity something that's
[1:11:43] so down in the dumps
[1:11:47] they couldn't love you first if they had
[1:11:49] to
[1:11:51] but you love them first you can turn
[1:11:54] their life around
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:11:57] amen the more that you're planted in
[1:12:02] god's love the more you'll be able to
[1:12:03] love like him
[1:12:04] unconditionally everywhere to every
[1:12:06] person at all the time
[1:12:08] press towards it the more that you're
[1:12:11] planted in god's love the more you'll be
[1:12:13] able to comprehend
[1:12:15] and know because you really can't know
[1:12:17] the love of god to experience it
[1:12:21] otherwise you got knowledge
[1:12:24] god loves me he died for me the bible
[1:12:27] says that
[1:12:30] but if it's that change in you you're
[1:12:31] not experiencing it right
[1:12:34] that's right while morty's saying what
[1:12:36] else is there
[1:12:37] to experience for the john
[1:12:40] how about feel for the person who's lost
[1:12:46] how about have that love
[1:12:50] the mask has come down you grabbed it
[1:12:52] now put it on your brother
[1:12:54] put it on your sister because life is
[1:12:58] leaving them
[1:12:59] and they need the oxygen of the holy
[1:13:01] ghost amen
[1:13:05] jude chapter 1 verse 21 jude chapter 1.

[1:13:09] i am just going to feel so good about
[1:13:12] saying it keeping
[1:13:18] yourself in the love of god
[1:13:25] you have a choice
[1:13:29] where are you going to keep yourself
[1:13:30] where are you going to be rooted
[1:13:33] is god's love going to be a part of your
[1:13:35] life or is it going to be your life
[1:13:39] keep yourself in the love of god looking
[1:13:42] for the mercy of our lord jesus christ
[1:13:45] unto eternal life
[1:13:46] so keep on experiencing the love of god
[1:13:50] in your life just keep experiencing one
[1:13:52] experience after another
[1:13:54] just keep it going keep experiencing
[1:13:56] keep yourself in that love
[1:13:59] what god's wanting to love the lord thy
[1:14:02] god with all the heart with all thy soul
[1:14:04] with all thy might
[1:14:05] amen from glory unto glory amen

[1:14:16] may dwell in your hearts
[1:14:19] by faith that's right if you're not
[1:14:22] going to believe it
[1:14:24] christ won't be there
[1:14:30] but at this very moment if you can
[1:14:32] believe
[1:14:33] that christ will be there
[1:14:40] god is not scientific even though
[1:14:44] he knows all about science yes
[1:14:49] god is a god of faith
[1:14:53] and if you want him you got to take him
[1:14:56] by faith
[1:14:58] and i'm so thankful i'm so thankful that
[1:15:01] i don't
[1:15:02] do so these things or be a certain
[1:15:05] knowledge or ability
[1:15:07] all they got to do is only believe only
[1:15:10] believe
[1:15:11] amen god sees your faith and he comes
[1:15:13] inside your heart
[1:15:17] he dwells there by faith as soon as you
[1:15:20] begin to
[1:15:23] the doubt says without faith it's
[1:15:25] impossible to please god
[1:15:27] amen and he just kind of like
[1:15:31] waits for you to get your attitude and
[1:15:34] your mind
[1:15:36] right so he can come back and just
[1:15:39] have the preeminence there you've got to

[1:15:50] out of the clouds and make sure you're
[1:15:54] grounded in love
[1:15:55] in the love of god keep your steps
[1:15:59] out of your ways and make sure your
[1:16:01] paths or the path that you're walking
[1:16:04] is the love of god
[1:16:08] rooted and grounded in the love of god
[1:16:11] everything

[1:16:14] in your hearts by faith that you be
[1:16:18] rooted and grounded in love
[1:16:21] yes i want to be honest with you
[1:16:27] there's a lot of mentality out there
[1:16:28] that you know since people
[1:16:30] receive christ they love god they just
[1:16:33] plucked themselves up and they just go
[1:16:35] somewhere else
[1:16:40] they don't realize as soon as you do
[1:16:42] that
[1:16:44] you lose where your strength your
[1:16:46] nutrition your water comes from
[1:16:50] you've got to stay in the love of god
[1:16:52] you can't i've got it figured out now
[1:16:55] i've got all this i got all the
[1:16:57] knowledge
[1:16:58] got it figured out
[1:17:02] any opportunity comes by to love
[1:17:04] somebody and you just get all tripped up
[1:17:05] because it's
[1:17:07] too hard yeah that's right they
[1:17:09] mistreated you too much
[1:17:13] it's too hard to love them what are you
[1:17:15] rooted in
[1:17:18] get your roots back in the love of god
[1:17:21] amen anything else short of that you're
[1:17:24] not going to grow properly
[1:17:28] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:17:31] faith being rooted grounded in love may
[1:17:33] be able to
[1:17:34] comprehend with all
[1:17:37] saints what is the breath
[1:17:40] the length the depth
[1:17:44] and height there's something
[1:17:47] there's something there's a a structure
[1:17:50] to god's love
[1:17:53] and to know the love of christ
[1:17:57] which passeth knowledge
[1:18:01] that ye might be filled
[1:18:04] with the fullness of god
[1:18:13] that's the revelation i want right there
[1:18:16] amen take this whole world but give me
[1:18:20] jesus
[1:18:22] it takes being rooted and grounded
[1:18:26] in the love of god to comprehend
[1:18:31] just how much god loves you
[1:18:36] it takes being rooted and grounded in
[1:18:39] love to know the love of christ
[1:18:41] to the place where our lives
[1:18:44] might be filled with the fullness of god
[1:18:48] i'm not happy with how much i have
[1:18:52] amen want the fullness
[1:18:55] well i'm not going to get it through
[1:18:56] head knowledge i'm not going to get it
[1:18:58] through
[1:18:59] the the mysteries and knowing all the
[1:19:01] mysteries and having all
[1:19:03] faith to remove mountains
[1:19:06] making all these sacrifices even burn my
[1:19:09] body
[1:19:13] fall in love with the word amen
[1:19:17] no god see we all know god through
[1:19:21] experience
[1:19:23] we've all felt god's love god has
[1:19:26] blessed us and
[1:19:27] bubbled us over it's a bubble and it's a
[1:19:30] bubbling
[1:19:31] right now we've all experienced his
[1:19:34] presence coming home he's
[1:19:35] listened to a song and oh that's so true
[1:19:38] also in the presence of the lord comes
[1:19:41] sitting in church something happens you
[1:19:43] know that that was just for you
[1:19:46] amen you begin to feel
[1:19:50] lord you did hear my prayer when i was
[1:19:52] praying the other day
[1:19:53] amen and we all experience
[1:19:56] god in that way
[1:20:02] but not too many of us love
[1:20:06] the word
[1:20:09] not too many of us are falling in love
[1:20:12] with the word
[1:20:14] we're falling in love with the god who
[1:20:16] expresses
[1:20:18] love to us by meeting our needs
[1:20:23] by answering our prayers by directing
[1:20:25] our paths
[1:20:28] by letting us feel his presence
[1:20:32] but we're not anxious about the word
[1:20:35] that's true that he has for our hearts
[1:20:40] now this is just human nature our
[1:20:43] our natures can become selfish about
[1:20:46] god's love
[1:20:47] right yes sure we want god's love we
[1:20:50] want to
[1:20:50] feel it and experience it know that it's
[1:20:52] with us and
[1:20:54] but god wants us to love the word
[1:20:57] his word it's a challenge for us
[1:21:01] to be filled with this fullness and we
[1:21:03] can't outside
[1:21:04] of the love of god because god is love
[1:21:08] now in tim that's able to do exceedingly
[1:21:11] above
[1:21:12] all that we ask or even think according
[1:21:15] to the power
[1:21:17] that's working in us well brother john
[1:21:20] i'm not feeling that power it's still
[1:21:24] working
[1:21:26] you've got to believe it you don't got
[1:21:29] to
[1:21:30] i don't i believe that mary received
[1:21:34] the word of god through faith
[1:21:37] when she said be it unto me according to
[1:21:41] that word
[1:21:43] it wasn't according to how i feel about
[1:21:45] the situation
[1:21:48] it went beyond her comprehension her own
[1:21:52] understanding how could
[1:21:55] a man receive the word who's never a
[1:21:57] woman receive
[1:21:58] a seed without knowing a man
[1:22:02] today you're sitting in the presence of
[1:22:05] god who can inject his seed into the
[1:22:07] womb of your mind
[1:22:08] and receive it down into your hearts
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:12] and life can come forth it is that real
[1:22:17] we don't need some show some light
[1:22:20] some some entertainment some hollywood
[1:22:23] some
[1:22:24] stories we just need the word of god
[1:22:26] fall in love with that word it's a sea
[1:22:29] that can come into our hearts
[1:22:32] continue to change us from glory unto
[1:22:36] glory most people come
[1:22:38] short of the love of god that god
[1:22:41] intended to have for them
[1:22:43] now long ago we ministered here on
[1:22:47] knowing christ as savior or his lord
[1:22:49] remember that
[1:22:52] some know this to be true a lot of
[1:22:53] people who say that they love
[1:22:56] god are not love with his word
[1:23:01] it's evident when you give them the word
[1:23:03] they say no thank you
[1:23:06] they will express all the things that
[1:23:07] god did for them
[1:23:10] and they will testify about it
[1:23:13] and they should but sometimes
[1:23:18] they're not interested in the word of
[1:23:20] god
[1:23:22] it's almost like they're bragging how
[1:23:25] much god loves them
[1:23:29] i said it and i believe it with all my
[1:23:31] heart
[1:23:33] instead of giving god glory the breaking
[1:23:36] how much god loves them
[1:23:39] i'm unworthy of his love friends
[1:23:46] it's almost like they're they're more
[1:23:48] special than the person they're talking
[1:23:50] to
[1:23:52] but yet they call it a testimony
[1:24:00] one time brother branham got home from
[1:24:04] being away and it was late and sarah and
[1:24:07] rebecca
[1:24:09] were so anxious to see their daddy
[1:24:15] and the older one was bragging to the
[1:24:16] younger one
[1:24:19] i've got all of daddy
[1:24:23] i got him and the younger one said
[1:24:27] yeah but daddy's got
[1:24:35] when you choose to put god first
[1:24:39] he's got all of you in the palm of his
[1:24:42] hand
[1:24:46] but when we're just gonna brag about
[1:24:48] god's love but we don't feel in debt to
[1:24:51] it
[1:24:52] when it doesn't make you want to get on
[1:24:53] your knees and love somebody with the
[1:24:55] same love that god loved you with
[1:24:58] you might have all jesus but friend
[1:25:01] what's going to hold you
[1:25:03] is when god is holding you
[1:25:12] loving god and not being in love with
[1:25:15] all of his word
[1:25:16] is one of the greatest deceptions that
[1:25:18] satan has put on the believer
[1:25:23] this is god in letter form
[1:25:27] amen god is his word
[1:25:30] amen it has never failed
[1:25:35] this word has never failed i
[1:25:38] am a human being that has lied
[1:25:42] well brother john what are you doing at
[1:25:44] the pulpit
[1:25:46] show me a man on the planet that hasn't
[1:25:48] lied amen
[1:25:49] and i'll do everything i can to get him
[1:25:52] over here and i'll sit underneath them
[1:25:54] amen
[1:26:01] well i expect more out of you you know
[1:26:04] we do need a revelation of our pastor
[1:26:07] that's the truth
[1:26:09] well brother john i got a revelation of
[1:26:11] my pastor
[1:26:12] my pastor would never say what you say
[1:26:15] he would never do what you do
[1:26:17] he would never act my pastor he would
[1:26:20] give me the scriptures and make me feel
[1:26:21] the way that i want to feel that's my
[1:26:23] pastor
[1:26:29] that's your revelation
[1:26:33] that would almost be like jesus telling
[1:26:36] you everything that you wanted
[1:26:37] every day i love you so much i can never
[1:26:40] rebuke you
[1:26:43] i can never hold you accountable i just
[1:26:46] let you keep lying
[1:26:56] let god's word be true amen we can count
[1:27:00] on it
[1:27:00] we need to fall in love with this word
[1:27:03] they're
[1:27:04] inseparable amen when you think about
[1:27:07] god i want you to think more about his
[1:27:09] word not so much the letter but the
[1:27:14] spirit of the word
[1:27:17] for each one for each and every one of
[1:27:20] our lives
[1:27:23] god and his word need to be inseparable
[1:27:29] in every situation that you're in yes
[1:27:32] too often we leave the word and go with
[1:27:35] the feelings
[1:27:38] go with our thoughts go with our
[1:27:40] understanding go with what we
[1:27:42] emotionally feel about it
[1:27:45] when we're told plainly to not lean to
[1:27:47] our own understanding
[1:27:50] just acknowledge him his word
[1:27:53] would direct your paths now i'll say
[1:27:56] this if you respected the word of god
[1:27:58] more in church
[1:27:59] god you would see god's directing your
[1:28:01] life more
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:05] but because you're coming to church for
[1:28:07] a feeling or emotion
[1:28:09] or something different
[1:28:14] you're not respecting him how do you
[1:28:17] expect god to just
[1:28:18] be your dubois we need to
[1:28:22] fall in love with the word the word is
[1:28:26] where jesus is at
[1:28:28] that's why so many people leave church
[1:28:30] and they're feeling nothing's transpired
[1:28:35] come on people can leave a a a
[1:28:39] another church a denominational church
[1:28:41] an independent church and
[1:28:43] they've got the the most enjoyable
[1:28:46] everything and feels so good
[1:28:49] about leaving right something really
[1:28:52] happened
[1:28:52] really encouraged them and really made
[1:28:54] them feel better
[1:28:57] there's been a change
[1:29:01] but their life remains the same
[1:29:10] when god was telling us to love him
[1:29:14] with all of our might
[1:29:18] involve our strength with all of our
[1:29:20] mind
[1:29:21] with all of our heart with all of our
[1:29:23] soul
[1:29:24] what he was really really telling us is
[1:29:27] to love his
[1:29:28] word with all of our heart
[1:29:31] with all of our strengths
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:37] do not allow your personal experiences
[1:29:40] with the love of god
[1:29:42] to be separate from this word
[1:29:47] amen too many of us are loving god
[1:29:50] outside of the word of god
[1:29:53] and are missing all the love that god
[1:29:56] has for us
[1:29:57] amen he has he wants us to be filled
[1:30:00] with the fullness
[1:30:01] of his love that's what the bible says
[1:30:05] first john chapter one verse number one
[1:30:08] not first john saint john sorry
[1:30:10] saint john chapter one verse one time is
[1:30:13] running out
[1:30:14] time was really filled with swift
[1:30:16] transition today i don't really know
[1:30:18] what happened
[1:30:20] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:30:24] word
[1:30:24] it was with god and the word
[1:30:28] it was god
[1:30:31] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:30:34] see it's insufferable
[1:30:36] you can't separate the bible from god
[1:30:40] amen if you don't understand
[1:30:44] something pray about it
[1:30:47] god wants to reveal himself at the same
[1:30:50] time he wants to reveal himself to the
[1:30:52] hungry
[1:30:53] to the thirsty he's also hiding himself
[1:30:57] from the person who's got the wrong
[1:30:58] motive
[1:31:01] about knowing about it
[1:31:05] so if the word and god was the same at
[1:31:08] the beginning
[1:31:10] then we when we fall in love with god we
[1:31:13] need to fall in love with the word
[1:31:17] hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 through faith
[1:31:21] we understand that the worlds were
[1:31:24] framed by the word of god
[1:31:27] so that the things which are seen were
[1:31:30] not made
[1:31:31] of things which do appear
[1:31:34] now i can say that i made this
[1:31:38] from some wood that somebody cut
[1:31:42] from a tree and they planed it earth it
[1:31:44] was planed when it was brought to them
[1:31:49] and then perhaps somebody planted the
[1:31:52] tree
[1:31:53] watered the tree
[1:31:57] but in reality all the hands that have
[1:31:59] touched it
[1:32:03] the actual substance came from something
[1:32:06] we don't even see
[1:32:09] and that's the word of god amen
[1:32:13] amen and at the beginning when there was
[1:32:15] nothing
[1:32:17] the word amen spoken into existence
[1:32:22] amen and that word was god and that his
[1:32:26] word will not return
[1:32:28] void it will accomplish
[1:32:31] its purpose that it was sent out to do
[1:32:36] god didn't bring us this far to leave us
[1:32:40] it will accomplish that which he
[1:32:42] intended it for
[1:32:47] we can have a confidence he that which
[1:32:50] have begun
[1:32:50] a good work in us is going to finish it
[1:32:53] the word is going to finish it
[1:32:55] because the word is already spoken
[1:33:02] we don't need to emphasize
[1:33:06] look towards experiences
[1:33:09] of our flesh
[1:33:12] experiences of the love of god in our
[1:33:14] flesh the good
[1:33:16] feeling it brings us
[1:33:19] oh did you just feel the presence of the
[1:33:21] lord there
[1:33:24] i want to feel the presence of the lord
[1:33:26] here
[1:33:28] if you don't feel it here what good is
[1:33:30] it to feel it here
[1:33:33] this won't change you this temporary
[1:33:36] makes you feel good you know that
[1:33:38] right that's why i eat double stuffed
[1:33:40] oreos because they don't do good here
[1:33:46] they taste good here
[1:33:57] john chapter 1 verse 14 and the word
[1:34:00] that was at the beginning
[1:34:02] was spoken and was made flesh
[1:34:06] and it dwelt among us and we behold his
[1:34:10] glory the glory is the only begotten of
[1:34:11] the father full of grace
[1:34:13] and full of truth
[1:34:16] god's word will not return void a virgin
[1:34:19] shall conceive
[1:34:20] and it came forth it was manifested
[1:34:24] in the beginning god called your name
[1:34:26] yes
[1:34:27] you're going to come forth you're going
[1:34:29] to be a manifested son and daughter of
[1:34:31] god
[1:34:35] it's gonna happen because god's seed is
[1:34:39] inside of you
[1:34:42] you have to say yes to the word
[1:34:47] because when you were in the world you
[1:34:49] weren't saying yes
[1:34:50] to the word you were just doing what you
[1:34:53] wanted to do and nobody could tell you
[1:34:55] any different
[1:34:56] yes and that's why your life didn't
[1:34:59] change
[1:35:01] but when you turned your life to christ
[1:35:03] when you did the things that you
[1:35:05] should do that's when change began to
[1:35:08] take place
[1:35:09] and i say it like this do not sit here
[1:35:12] and say i've changed to know
[1:35:16] because the word called you a manifested
[1:35:19] son
[1:35:19] and daughter of god and you've got to
[1:35:21] agree with that word you've got to say
[1:35:23] be it unto me finish the work you've
[1:35:25] started in me lord
[1:35:27] you're not through with me and i believe
[1:35:29] you're what i'm gonna change
[1:35:32] and you know what it's just slowly it's
[1:35:34] not some
[1:35:35] you know we want to see some some dream
[1:35:38] prophecy
[1:35:39] some arm come forth we all want that
[1:35:42] that's beautiful that's wonderful
[1:35:44] but god chose the preaching of his word
[1:35:48] to bring forth manifested sons and
[1:35:51] daughters of god
[1:35:52] and it happens here and then there are
[1:35:54] this
[1:35:57] you know when your child is is growing
[1:35:59] up
[1:36:01] you don't shove the whole encyclopedia
[1:36:03] down his throat as soon as he starts
[1:36:05] school
[1:36:07] you give him a little bit yeah
[1:36:10] first they learn to take a nap when the
[1:36:12] teacher says take a nap
[1:36:15] if you're good we're going to have our
[1:36:16] graham crackers and milk
[1:36:18] right i don't know what they do
[1:36:24] because of my fondest memories is at
[1:36:26] lunch time when i was in school
[1:36:28] [Laughter]
[1:36:30] and don't tell me you can't wait to get
[1:36:32] out here and go to lunch because that's
[1:36:33] not why we're here
[1:36:40] we got to give time for that child to
[1:36:42] grow
[1:36:43] experience give a little bit more and a
[1:36:45] little bit more
[1:36:47] can you imagine your 13 year old saying
[1:36:50] i know more than you
[1:36:54] you stopped telling me what to do you
[1:36:55] were hypocrite yourself
[1:37:07] we can get that attitude at church
[1:37:11] who are you to preach that
[1:37:14] i saw you get upset
[1:37:18] probably didn't see me get upset but
[1:37:19] you've probably seen something
[1:37:21] sure the devil showed you something he's
[1:37:23] real good at it
[1:37:28] he can tell you all about me even when
[1:37:31] i'm not telling you
[1:37:31] be at home just sitting on the couch
[1:37:33] thinking to me he'll tell you a whole
[1:37:34] bunch of stuff
[1:37:36] he's good
[1:37:42] i don't know i'm not allowed to preach
[1:37:43] like this when it's at the end of the
[1:37:44] service turn with me to colossians
[1:37:46] chapter one
[1:37:48] now there's nine verses here that are
[1:37:50] kind of like
[1:37:51] there's no period after just comma or
[1:37:54] semicolon and it just kind of goes on
[1:37:56] and
[1:37:57] you know when you're in school they
[1:37:58] would call this a run-on
[1:38:01] but god's word is etron i just want to
[1:38:03] kind of cut here at the end of that
[1:38:05] colossians chapter 15 who is in the
[1:38:08] image jesus christ is in the image of
[1:38:10] the invisible
[1:38:11] god the firstborn of every creature
[1:38:14] for by him were all things created
[1:38:18] that are in heaven that are here on
[1:38:21] earth
[1:38:22] things that are visible and invisible we
[1:38:25] got invisible waves going through here
[1:38:26] right now
[1:38:28] whether they be thrones or dominions
[1:38:29] principalities or
[1:38:31] or powers even the powers of satan
[1:38:34] right that's good all things are created
[1:38:37] by him
[1:38:38] and for him
[1:38:42] for him that tells me that god
[1:38:45] wants to be god that's what that tells
[1:38:48] me
[1:38:50] and he is before all things and by him
[1:38:53] all things consist
[1:38:56] and he is the head of this church
[1:39:00] amen that's correct he's the head
[1:39:04] yes who is the beginning of the
[1:39:07] firstborn of the dead
[1:39:09] that in all things he might have the
[1:39:12] preeminence
[1:39:14] now how do you allow jesus christ
[1:39:18] to be preeminent in this church
[1:39:21] how do you do it don't get that close to
[1:39:24] me brother john stay
[1:39:27] back
[1:39:31] how do you allow him to be preeminent
[1:39:34] in your life in this church
[1:39:41] you let the word be preeminent
[1:39:44] amen in other words you
[1:39:47] let the word judge you yes
[1:39:52] you let it be the final say-so
[1:39:56] for your life not just well that's
[1:40:00] probably for somebody else ain't for me
[1:40:04] let the word be preeminent that's how
[1:40:07] he has preeminence in this church
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:12] we all have an opportunity to build this
[1:40:14] relationship with god
[1:40:19] just yield to him amen let the word
[1:40:22] govern your life
[1:40:24] change your life whatever god is trying
[1:40:26] to do
[1:40:28] he wants to be thankful for jesus
[1:40:32] he's not only supplying our needs we
[1:40:34] don't want to be just thankful for him
[1:40:35] supplying our needs
[1:40:36] we want to be thankful that we ought to
[1:40:39] be thankful that god
[1:40:40] wants to correct your life in a closer
[1:40:43] way with him
[1:40:44] tell me which parent in here ever had
[1:40:47] the attitude
[1:40:51] james
[1:40:55] i feel i got permission from the parents
[1:40:57] james
[1:40:59] i i love you the way you are you do not
[1:41:03] need to change
[1:41:05] you keep being as disobedient as you are
[1:41:08] you don't have to do your chores more
[1:41:10] than you're doing them now which isn't
[1:41:12] very much
[1:41:14] you don't have to take your plate to the
[1:41:16] table
[1:41:18] no parent is going to say that why would
[1:41:21] we expect god to come in here and say
[1:41:23] you don't need to change anymore you're
[1:41:26] good where you're at
[1:41:27] you've hit the plateau fact you've been
[1:41:29] there so long
[1:41:30] i don't know why i didn't rapture myself
[1:41:36] let the word have preeminence let all
[1:41:39] the feelings
[1:41:40] that we comprehend be set aside
[1:41:43] let all the emotions and knowledge be
[1:41:46] set aside
[1:41:47] let everything that you think you know
[1:41:49] be set aside
[1:41:51] let all the tongues and the prophecies
[1:41:53] and the dreams and the knowledge
[1:41:56] be set aside and fall in love
[1:42:00] with this word fall in love with this
[1:42:04] word
[1:42:05] fall in love with the other part of god
[1:42:07] that we haven't been thinking about
[1:42:12] to know the love of christ with passive
[1:42:14] knowledge
[1:42:15] that we might be filled with the
[1:42:18] fullness of god so
[1:42:20] the fullness of god comes with
[1:42:23] the love of god fall in love
[1:42:27] with his word it's time to build our
[1:42:30] love relationship
[1:42:32] with the word amen thy word
[1:42:35] is a lamp unto my feet and a light
[1:42:38] to my path amen the word is settled it's
[1:42:42] forever
[1:42:44] settled in heaven it ought to be settled
[1:42:47] in our heart we just need to settle with
[1:42:49] it
[1:42:52] i have so many things that i need to
[1:42:54] just
[1:42:55] bypass
[1:42:59] and sometimes i ask the lord lord why
[1:43:02] did did you have me go through them why
[1:43:05] am i writing them down
[1:43:06] if i'm not going to be able to preach on
[1:43:08] them
[1:43:11] it's a big battle i have then i gotta
[1:43:14] wonder did i
[1:43:15] did i stay too long on a subject is it
[1:43:18] for another time
[1:43:20] did i do the right job but i'll tell you
[1:43:24] my anchor is the lord is in control he
[1:43:27] knows what he's doing
[1:43:28] amen praise the lord
[1:43:32] john chapter 12 verse 46. excuse me i i
[1:43:35] am skipping a lot trust me
[1:43:38] too many people think that god didn't
[1:43:41] come
[1:43:42] to judge them just came to save them
[1:43:53] and this is this is the part of the
[1:43:54] gospel that that really satan
[1:43:56] wants people to know about
[1:43:59] god wants us to walk in the light of his
[1:44:02] word saint john chapter 12 verse 46
[1:44:04] i am come a light into
[1:44:07] the world that whosoever believeth on me
[1:44:12] should not abide in darkness so here is
[1:44:14] his statement
[1:44:15] god gives us the truth of his word so
[1:44:18] you don't stay in the condition that
[1:44:19] you're in
[1:44:20] amen verse 47 and
[1:44:24] if any man hear my words and they don't
[1:44:27] believe them
[1:44:28] i judge them not right for i came not to
[1:44:32] judge
[1:44:33] the world but my job here is to save the
[1:44:36] world
[1:44:38] look at the next verse he that rejecteth
[1:44:42] me
[1:44:42] and receiveth not my words have
[1:44:45] one that judge him the word that i have
[1:44:49] spoken the same
[1:44:51] shall judge him in the last day
[1:44:54] we cannot get away from the word of god
[1:44:58] it was in the beginning it will be in
[1:45:00] the end he is the alpha he is the omega
[1:45:03] we need to fall in love with the word
[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:07] we don't want to kick the can down the
[1:45:08] road right
[1:45:11] don't build your love relationship
[1:45:14] outside
[1:45:15] of your love for the word don't do that
[1:45:18] fall more in love with the word let's
[1:45:20] stand together
[1:45:22] let your love relationship be more with
[1:45:25] the word
[1:45:26] set your affections on the word
[1:45:33] i wish i could give you all these
[1:45:34] scriptures
[1:45:38] i want to encourage you to read the
[1:45:40] bible you're going to see them
[1:45:45] be more rooted and grounded in god's
[1:45:49] love
[1:45:49] yes amen stay away from loving god
[1:45:54] outside of the word it's so easy to do
[1:45:57] feelings emotions i got my private stay
[1:45:59] away from that
[1:46:00] delight thyself in the word god
[1:46:04] when you start thinking about god i want
[1:46:06] you to think about
[1:46:08] the he's the word god
[1:46:12] putting the preeminence the emphasis on
[1:46:15] the word
[1:46:17] so we delight ourselves to get into it
[1:46:19] more and
[1:46:20] and read it and seek to get
[1:46:23] grounded rooted in
[1:46:26] the love of the word yes yes
[1:46:30] so we can speak the word
[1:46:34] the truth of the word in love rather
[1:46:37] than just
[1:46:39] speaking the truth speak it in love
[1:46:43] there's always a way out
[1:46:47] think about this none of us today
[1:46:49] standing here
[1:46:50] are without the mercies of god at our
[1:46:53] fingertips
[1:46:54] nobody has blasphemed the holy ghost

[1:47:22] nature yes sir i've got to learn to
[1:47:25] crucify it i've got to learn to deny it
[1:47:28] it it creeps in the more that god shows
[1:47:31] me in his word the more horrible i am
