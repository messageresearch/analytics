[28:54] brother John comes amen
[28:58] I know not why God's wonderous Grace to
[29:04] me he hath made
[29:08] known nor why
[29:11] unworthy Christ in love
[29:15] redeem me for his
[29:18] own but I know whom I have believed in
[29:24] and am
[29:26] persuaded that he is
[29:29] able to keep that which I've
[29:34] committed unto him against that
[29:40] day I know not how the saving Faith to
[29:46] me he did
[29:50] impart nor now
[29:53] believing in his word brought peace
[29:58] within my
[30:00] heart but I know whom I have
[30:05] beli and am
[30:08] persuaded that he is
[30:11] able to keep that which I've
[30:16] committed unto him against that
[30:21] day I know not how the spirit moves
[30:28] convincing men of
[30:31] sin
[30:33] revealing Jesus Through the word
[30:38] containing faith in
[30:41] him but I know whom I have believed in
[30:46] and am
[30:48] persuaded that he is
[30:51] able to keep that which I've
[30:56] committed to him against that
[31:01] day I know not what of good or ill may
[31:07] be reserved for
[31:10] me of we ways or golden days before his
[31:18] face I
[31:20] see but I know whom I have believed in
[31:26] and am persuad
[31:27] ated that he is
[31:30] able to keep that which I've
[31:35] committed unto him against that
[31:40] day I know not when my Lord may come at
[31:46] night or noon day
[31:49] Fair nor if I walk a veil with him or
[31:56] meet in in the
[31:59] air but I know whom I have believed it
[32:05] and and
[32:06] persuaded that he is
[32:09] able to keep that which I've
[32:13] committed unto him against that
[32:18] day but I know whom I have believed it
[32:24] and am
[32:25] persuaded that he is
[32:28] a to keep that which I've
[32:32] committed unto him against
[32:38] that
[32:40] amen that's Faith amen that's faith I
[32:44] know in whom I have believed in
[32:48] amen if someone talked to you in Jesus
[32:51] somebody can talk you
[32:53] out but if God has revealed himself to
[32:56] you
[32:58] no man can talk you out I am persuaded
[33:02] that he is able right good morning and
[33:06] God bless each of
[33:08] you good to see you my
[33:11] family the family of God together think
[33:14] about what it's going to be like brother
[33:16] Johnson when we're on the other
[33:19] side never have to
[33:22] depart no aches and
[33:25] pains no sicknesses no
[33:30] sorrow that's why we're here today amen
[33:34] because we're looking forward and we're
[33:36] believing we're persuaded that that day
[33:39] is coming amen amen God bless you this
[33:43] morning turn with me if you would to the
[33:45] book of second Peter chapter 1 and then
[33:49] also second Corinthians chapter 1 we
[33:52] want to uh hopefully we want to do part
[33:57] three and precious
[33:59] promises and if the Lord will help us to
[34:02] get through we have a lot of
[34:04] scriptures and we have uh honestly uh so
[34:08] many notes that in scriptures that we
[34:10] haven't read because there's so much uh
[34:13] in the Bible of course but there's so
[34:15] many promises of God and so many things
[34:18] but if we just if we go back and we we
[34:22] try to nail the
[34:25] highlights um I believe that there are
[34:28] many promises that we don't receive
[34:31] because we don't do our part now the
[34:33] biggest part is believing amen that's
[34:35] the biggest part but how can we believe
[34:38] if we haven't done what he's asked us to
[34:41] do so you see that that one point that
[34:44] we don't spend much emphasis on is I
[34:48] believe we need to get a balance because
[34:51] if we want our faith to grow we got to
[34:52] do the things that he's asking us to do
[34:54] to receive the promise amen amen
[34:57] amen let's look to the Lord in a word of
[35:00] prayer before we read Heavenly Father
[35:02] Lord this morning as we come before you
[35:05] we know Lord that without you we're
[35:07] nothing so we're asking that You' come
[35:09] and forgive us of all of our sins
[35:13] cleanse us of our unbelief wash Us in
[35:15] the pure blood that was shed at Calvary
[35:18] and let us be uh in perfect harmony with
[35:22] you this morning Lord we don't want to
[35:24] miss anything that you would have for
[35:26] for us and we pray that you'd give us uh
[35:29] ears to hear that still Small Voice as
[35:31] you're speaking Lord there's uh our
[35:35] brothers and sisters are here and they
[35:37] are going to be hearing from you and uh
[35:40] Lord uh there's going to be voices
[35:44] spoken uh Lord but we ask Lord that we
[35:48] would all be in tune with your voice
[35:50] this
[35:51] morning Lord the reason that we want to
[35:53] hear from you because you said my sheep
[35:55] hear my voice and they follow me we want
[35:58] to follow whatever you have for us this
[36:01] morning God we pray that you would
[36:03] prepare our hearts now if they're not
[36:05] prepared we ask Lord that the word would
[36:08] be accompanied with Revelation from
[36:11] above today Lord come and reveal let it
[36:14] let these words not be uh just uh words
[36:19] of spoken by a man but may they be
[36:22] spoken from Heaven this morning
[36:24] Lord we ask Lord
[36:27] Lord that you would give us a greater a
[36:31] a greater revelation of the promises of
[36:34] God this morning we commit it all to you
[36:36] and we give you praise in advance in the
[36:39] precious name of Jesus Christ we pray
[36:42] amen amen second Peter chapter 1 just
[36:46] two verses there verses three and four
[36:49] according as his divine power have given
[36:51] unto us all things that pertaineth unto
[36:54] life and godliness through the knowledge
[36:56] of him that have called us to glory and
[36:58] virtue whereby are giving unto us
[37:00] exceeding great and precious promises
[37:04] that by these promises we might be
[37:08] partakers of the divine nature having
[37:13] escaped the corruption that is in the
[37:15] world through our desires amen and then
[37:20] second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20 2
[37:24] Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20 now uh
[37:29] for all the promises of God in him are
[37:34] yay and in him amen that's right unto
[37:38] the glory of God by us now he which
[37:42] establish us with you in Christ have
[37:46] anointed us is God who have also sealed
[37:50] us and given us the earnest of the
[37:53] spirit in our hearts amen God bless you
[37:56] you may be seated for a subject this
[38:00] morning I want to focus on meeting God's
[38:03] condition is what builds fate to receive
[38:05] the
[38:07] promises so often I believe God's hidden
[38:11] Simplicity and and and God has often
[38:14] said if thou can't believe all things
[38:16] are possible
[38:19] amen but
[38:21] then we understand that there's
[38:24] sometimes an element of unbelief and and
[38:27] the one man said Lord help my
[38:30] unbelief help this element of of
[38:34] unbelief
[38:37] well all of God's
[38:39] promises are not
[38:43] unconditional they are conditional so
[38:46] there is a condition that has to be met
[38:48] and I believe by meeting God's
[38:51] conditions we can build the faith that
[38:53] we need for the very promise that we're
[38:56] wanting
[38:59] am I believe it's God actually
[39:03] transforms us through these
[39:07] promises so as we meet conditions we're
[39:10] obeying the word of God we're showing
[39:13] that we love him and he changes us he
[39:17] transforms us from Glory unto
[39:21] glory and it's through the Freemore
[39:24] agency it it's not by something that we
[39:29] are forced to do we don't come to church
[39:32] because our parents make us come we
[39:34] don't come because uh um well the Bible
[39:38] says that the Commandments of God are
[39:40] not Grievious so if we just love him we
[39:43] want to please him and as we as we walk
[39:46] in further
[39:47] obedience he changes
[39:50] Us in fact if we had time and we don't
[39:53] have time um in second Peter uh um he
[39:57] goes on and he talks about um giving all
[40:02] diligence and besides these precious
[40:05] promises give all
[40:07] diligence to add to your faith virtue
[40:10] virtue knowledge so you're adding these
[40:12] virtues to your life and that through
[40:14] these you become
[40:18] Overcomers and that if if these virtues
[40:20] aren't even in you it'll leave you
[40:23] Barren unfruitful of the fruit of God
[40:26] God right and uh um you you can even
[40:30] forget what God has done for you in the
[40:33] past the Bible says forget about what
[40:35] Calvary did for us and but if we're
[40:39] predestinated if we're elected then we
[40:41] make our election sure our calling sure
[40:46] we make sure that those virtues are in
[40:48] our
[40:49] life and some of these two of these
[40:51] virtues are actually the fruit of the
[40:53] Holy
[40:54] Ghost so it's a constant adding amen and
[40:59] through our obedience and adding these
[41:02] things to our
[41:04] life that we receive more of Christ in
[41:08] the image and that's what it's all about
[41:10] it's about us getting ready to get out
[41:11] of
[41:13] here he's coming for
[41:16] himself he's coming for himself he's
[41:19] coming for his
[41:22] wife which was a part of him at the
[41:25] beginning
[41:27] and it's taken all these years for all
[41:29] of us to get manifested through time and
[41:32] he's still waiting for the last ones to
[41:34] come in get manifested so we can get out
[41:37] of here so these promises are extremely
[41:42] important so we we talked about that we
[41:46] have a need of promises in our life
[41:48] because of problems and then God has a
[41:50] need of being preeminent in his
[41:53] bride so now we're trying to work these
[41:56] these two things out together and he
[41:58] tells us to put the yoke upon us his
[42:02] word to put it on us to get dressed with
[42:05] the word and let the word become our
[42:08] headship we no longer have a will we no
[42:11] longer want the the hey look at
[42:14] me I'm better we don't have that he's
[42:17] the great one and we actually esteem
[42:20] others better than ourselves we take on
[42:23] the nature of God Amen it's about his
[42:27] will so we grow in obedience we grow in
[42:30] faithfulness we grow closer to him
[42:32] because it's Christ in us the hope of
[42:36] glory now obedience to God's condition
[42:40] is the vehicle that builds our faith to
[42:43] receive the very promises that we
[42:46] want so of course how many times have we
[42:49] sat in church and just wish I had Faith
[42:52] to
[42:53] believe because you can't muster it I
[42:56] wish wish I had Faith to
[42:58] believe there are things that you can do
[43:01] to build your
[43:03] confidence you cannot sit back be
[43:07] lazy don't do the things that you know
[43:10] you should be doing and expect to have
[43:12] faith for things in your
[43:14] life because it's a
[43:17] relationship and brother Brandon makes
[43:20] this statement that God is not obligated
[43:23] to give you anything more if you haven't
[43:26] walked in obedience to what he's already
[43:29] given you in the
[43:33] past
[43:35] amen now our understanding tells us that
[43:38] we can have faith without
[43:40] obedience that's what our understanding
[43:42] tells
[43:44] us that we can have God's promises
[43:48] without being
[43:50] obedient in other words there's an
[43:52] attitude out there it says name it and
[43:54] claim it that's right name it and claim
[43:58] it
[43:59] attitude but God's Yoke the word of God
[44:02] teaches us that faith and obedience
[44:06] opens the doors to God's promises so we
[44:09] can say it like this name it follow the
[44:12] conditions and claim
[44:16] it so I believe in naming and claiming
[44:19] it but I believe in obeying
[44:22] it brother brandom said in the message
[44:24] sir we would see Jes Jesus he says now
[44:27] if it is the same Spirit then it'll do
[44:31] the same
[44:33] work if the people can get themsel in
[44:37] the same
[44:40] condition in the same condition in God's
[44:44] provided way brother Brandon said see
[44:46] we're finite we can say well I was
[44:51] wrong but he God can't be wrong that's
[44:55] right and be
[44:57] God so what action he has taken if he
[45:01] was called on the scene at one time to
[45:04] save a man and he saved that man on a
[45:08] certain basis If any man any time
[45:12] anywhere meets on the same Ground God is
[45:15] obligated to do it
[45:18] again if he healed a man because of his
[45:21] faith then he will have to meet then he
[45:25] will have to meet the same condition
[45:27] each time or he did it wrong when he
[45:30] saved the first man or healed the first
[45:32] man see so brother bandam is teaching us
[45:36] that if we just follow the
[45:39] pattern if we just do what others have
[45:44] done God is obligated to do what for us
[45:48] what he did for them it is no secret
[45:50] what God can do what he's done for
[45:52] others he can do for you amen
[45:56] now what is God's divine
[45:59] nature is it going to
[46:02] church is it paying
[46:05] ties what is his divine
[46:08] nature leoa is blind to God's divine
[46:15] nature why would God tell them to be
[46:17] zous and
[46:20] repent their attitude is not about
[46:23] adding anything to their life and any
[46:26] virtues or building their attitude is
[46:29] I'm in need of
[46:31] nothing in fact I come to church to feel
[46:35] good and if I don't get
[46:38] that hey they kicked Jesus out they
[46:41] brought the lights in they brought the
[46:43] comedians in they brought the
[46:44] entertainment they brought the singing
[46:46] it's no longer worship it's I want to be
[46:48] in a concert I want to feel good about
[46:50] this
[46:54] thing they haven't added ude that Jesus
[46:56] died for me the blood covers my
[47:01] sins see they're close but there's no
[47:05] conscience of adding anything to their
[47:10] life I'll say it like this how can the
[47:12] blood of Jesus Christ cover someone when
[47:15] they refuse to walk in the
[47:18] light and and that's that's the hiccup
[47:21] right there see they're claiming the
[47:24] blood but they're not walking in the
[47:27] light and my Bible tells me in first
[47:30] John that that God cleanses us as we
[47:32] walk in the light as he is in the
[47:35] light so we've got to we've got to take
[47:38] that yoke upon
[47:41] us the word says come out of her my
[47:43] people and be not partakers of her sin
[47:45] come out of that spirit that alls I have
[47:48] to do is what I'm doing right now that's
[47:51] all that's required how can God even
[47:54] speak to us about doing doing other
[47:56] things if we if if we just picture that
[48:00] uh the the form of godliness that I have
[48:02] is really the divine nature of God we
[48:06] need the power of God we need the power
[48:08] to to deny
[48:10] ourself the the the power to lay down
[48:13] our life the the power to to to put our
[48:16] brothers forth the the power to pray and
[48:19] get into Spirit the the power to live
[48:21] for God the power to reach out to others
[48:23] the power to save Souls
[48:26] a that wins Souls is
[48:29] wise leoda is
[48:32] blind but did you know even Believers
[48:35] can backslide and forget about God's
[48:38] divine
[48:40] nature but God has a remedy for the
[48:43] backslider the Bible Jesus said the Holy
[48:46] Ghost will bring all things back to your
[48:50] remembrance thank you Lord Jesus
[48:52] Galatians turn with me Galatians 5:22
[48:56] this to me is the divine nature of
[48:59] God Galatians
[49:02] 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is
[49:07] love it is
[49:09] Joy it is peace longsuffering gentleness
[49:13] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[49:16] against such there is no
[49:21] law and they that are are the seed of
[49:27] Christ they that are predestined they
[49:30] that are elected they that are
[49:32] Christ they do
[49:34] something what do they
[49:36] do they have crucified the flesh with
[49:40] the affections and their lustful
[49:47] desires because they can't interact the
[49:50] carnal nature in God's nature they fight
[49:53] their enmity with one another another
[49:57] amen and we don't got time to get into
[49:59] all these but I want to if I by that
[50:01] with the help of the Lord I want to talk
[50:03] about the first
[50:04] three love joy and peace now by these
[50:09] precious
[50:10] promises we tap in to Galatians 5:22 we
[50:16] tap into it amen we we tap into the
[50:20] divine nature at least this promise is
[50:23] telling us here now this this is this is
[50:27] not the one thing that attracts the
[50:30] attention of the The
[50:34] Sinner right this is not it what
[50:38] attracts their attention is seeing
[50:40] somebody
[50:42] healed right seeing some
[50:46] miracle but for those that are they know
[50:50] that they're going to be just like Jesus
[50:52] when he returns this is a precious
[50:55] promise that we can become into God's
[50:59] divine nature and not only that the
[51:02] Bible says it helps us to escape the
[51:05] corruption that's in the
[51:08] world oh I love this amen all right love
[51:11] we know God's divine nature is love the
[51:14] Bible tells us God is
[51:16] love Jesus said in Matthew he said be ye
[51:20] therefore perfect even as your father
[51:21] which is in heaven is perfect so this
[51:24] this love is really described in 1
[51:26] Corinthians chapter 13 the the one very
[51:30] strong thing about it is it never fails
[51:32] our love fails God's love doesn't fail
[51:35] it's able to Bear any situation it
[51:38] endures all things it never stops hoping
[51:41] it doesn't think evil it's not puffed up
[51:45] it's it doesn't seek its own desires
[51:48] this love is
[51:50] supernatural and it is the divine nature
[51:52] of God for God so loved the world that
[51:56] he gave I want to tell you how many
[51:58] times have you woke up and said I I just
[52:00] I want to get and just give everything
[52:03] I'll tell you that's what Jesus
[52:05] did he gave this love is beautiful
[52:10] Ephesians 2 tells us God who is rich in
[52:12] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[52:15] loved us even when we are dead in sins
[52:18] have quickened us together with Christ
[52:20] by Grace you're
[52:22] saved we're able to love God because he
[52:25] first loved us what I mean by that is he
[52:29] places his love inside of
[52:33] us hey look if if God God if God just
[52:37] comes down and showers us with his
[52:40] blessings and we all feel the love of
[52:42] God and we feel
[52:45] good it could be an hour after the
[52:47] service and we actually don't even feel
[52:50] that feeling anymore are you with me but
[52:54] if that love comes down on the inside of
[52:57] the inside of your
[52:59] soul now you're able to love him back
[53:02] with the same love that he's loved you
[53:04] with can you say Amen to
[53:06] that now let's look at the promise of
[53:09] love right here Romans 55 Romans 55 the
[53:13] love of God I want this promise how many
[53:15] wants love all right right here the love
[53:18] of God is shed abroad in our hearts by
[53:21] the Holy Ghost which is given unto usen
[53:26] it is
[53:27] impossible to have the love of God
[53:30] without having the Holy Ghost Inside
[53:33] you amen the Holy Ghost comes inside of
[53:36] you and it begins to work out its
[53:40] will its will its will is not to be ill
[53:45] towards somebody so if you're like I got
[53:47] this problem with this person and their
[53:49] bother and me but you've got to yield
[53:53] yourself to the Holy Ghost you've got to
[53:56] let God work in you both to will and do
[53:58] of his good pleasure and then you're
[54:01] able to love that person with no ill
[54:04] amen and this is how it works it's not a
[54:08] an emotional thing it's not a thing of
[54:10] feelings it's a thing of Faith the word
[54:13] says think no evil I will think no evil
[54:16] you believe the word you apply yourself
[54:18] to the word I can do all things to
[54:21] Christ it's a
[54:23] reality it's a reality to the
[54:26] believer amen so I want to say if you
[54:29] want more how many wants more love how
[54:31] many is refusing to participate in
[54:37] this it's simple seek the holy ghost
[54:41] seek more of the Holy
[54:43] Ghost the problem is we battle this
[54:46] thing I'm sealed already I'm sealed
[54:49] already I'm sealed I'm sealed there's I
[54:52] can't get
[54:53] anymore oh My my what a battle you must
[54:57] have what a battle you must have praise
[55:01] God for the seal praise God for how much
[55:03] Holy Ghost you have but I'm talking
[55:05] about getting
[55:07] more I'm talking about learning to yield
[55:09] to the Holy Ghost you do
[55:12] God because it will bring forth the
[55:15] genuine love of God Amen now the promise
[55:19] of the Holy Ghost Jesus
[55:21] Promised the Hol the Holy Ghost to us in
[55:24] John 14:16 says I will pray in the
[55:27] father and he will give you another
[55:29] comforter that he may abide with you
[55:31] forever okay so this is just another
[55:35] promise okay um acts 238 gives us the
[55:39] promise repent be baptize every one of
[55:41] you in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[55:44] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[55:46] so we we we talked about it you seek you
[55:49] knock you you you you ask and you keep
[55:53] doing it and we already know God's
[55:54] desire he wants to give us the Holy
[55:56] Ghost so much more than we want to give
[55:58] good gifts to our kids amen but we still
[56:02] got to do our part so the condition is
[56:04] we've got to truly
[56:08] repent we've got to truly
[56:11] repent we've got to have the correct
[56:13] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:15] Christ we can't be baptized in the in
[56:17] the titles father son Holy Ghost it just
[56:19] doesn't
[56:20] work the correct baptism according to
[56:23] the gospel and when we meet those
[56:28] conditions we can have faith to receive
[56:30] the Holy Ghost are you with me now
[56:34] here's the big thing brother John how do
[56:36] I know I've truly repented this is a big
[56:40] one there's no doubt when everybody has
[56:43] repented they are sorry for the sins
[56:46] that they've done and they don't want
[56:48] those sins to stand in the way of them
[56:50] going to
[56:53] heaven
[56:56] but is
[56:58] that all that we need to repent for I
[57:02] guess that's a good question is that all
[57:03] we need to repent
[57:05] for in other words if I just repent for
[57:08] that and I continue to go live in the
[57:10] world the way I want to and do the
[57:12] things that I used to do
[57:15] right see if you repent of your past
[57:19] sins God will forgive you of your past
[57:22] sins but if you continue to walk out and
[57:25] do what you want to do hey look you've
[57:28] got new
[57:29] sins you've got new sins that's just all
[57:32] there is to it those things have to be
[57:34] dealt with so brother John how do I know
[57:37] if I've truly
[57:39] repented first you turn
[57:43] around you simply begin to do the
[57:45] Commandments of God so I Repent here I I
[57:49] I I I've repented I get baptized I'm
[57:51] washed I'm going to start walking in the
[57:53] will of God
[57:55] whatever he wants me to do I'm going to
[57:57] start doing it if this word tells me to
[57:59] do it I'm going to do it if you decide I
[58:03] I'm only going to do what I want to do
[58:05] I'm only going to come I'm only going to
[58:07] get I'm only well look there is no
[58:10] gospel for
[58:11] that there's there's no there's no
[58:15] there's no Assurance to that there's no
[58:18] Blessed Assurance of that type of walk
[58:21] you've got to turn around your life has
[58:24] to become off
[58:25] Christ and this is to me we need to
[58:28] evaluate have I do I wake up every day
[58:31] and give my all to
[58:34] God because Satan is on the other side
[58:37] every day trying to get you away from
[58:39] doing the will of
[58:40] God brother sister I'm thankful for
[58:43] every one of you that been baptized I'm
[58:45] thankful for every one of you that said
[58:47] I I want my sins under the blood and and
[58:50] I'm going to give my heart to Christ but
[58:52] today is the day of salvation and you
[58:54] need to make make sure that Monday
[58:56] through Sunday you're giving your all to
[58:58] God
[59:00] amen amen because if not we just become
[59:03] a denomination in the
[59:04] message right we become our own little
[59:08] belief
[59:11] system second you must begin the most
[59:16] important thing in your life which is
[59:19] fall more in love with Jesus every
[59:22] day that's how you know you've done a
[59:25] complete
[59:27] turnaround hey look when I was in the
[59:29] world I love the things in the world and
[59:31] I didn't even have to be taught to do
[59:33] them I just wanted to do them I saw them
[59:35] I heard them I tasted them I this is
[59:38] what I
[59:40] want but we've got to fall in love with
[59:44] Jesus now that that takes I'm GNA be
[59:46] honest with you that takes
[59:49] work you've got to be willing to crucify
[59:51] your flesh you got to be willing to pray
[59:54] and and read your Bible and listen to
[59:56] the tapes and and get into his
[1:00:01] presence so it does take efforts and
[1:00:03] Jesus said in for uh John 14:15 he says
[1:00:07] if you love me keep my
[1:00:11] commandments so love becomes the
[1:00:15] motivation for obeying the word amen
[1:00:18] it's no longer I have to it's I want
[1:00:22] to it's falling in love with Jesus now
[1:00:25] look at verse
[1:00:26] 22 John
[1:00:28] 14:22 Judas saith unto him not as scar
[1:00:31] yet Lord how is it that you're going to
[1:00:33] manifest yourself unto us but you're not
[1:00:36] going to do it unto the
[1:00:37] world and Jesus said unto him if a man
[1:00:41] love me the first thing he's going to
[1:00:44] do is obey
[1:00:48] me that's the first
[1:00:50] thing and my father is going to love him
[1:00:54] for
[1:00:55] it and you know what's going to happen
[1:00:58] we will come in unto him and we're going
[1:01:02] to make our
[1:01:03] bold now here's what's the beautiful
[1:01:06] thing about God coming inside
[1:01:09] am if the spirit of Beethoven Lives in
[1:01:13] me well I am going to play like
[1:01:18] Beethoven if the spirit of who's that
[1:01:23] artist Rim brand lives in me I'm going
[1:01:26] to be able to paint like Rim
[1:01:29] brand so if the
[1:01:31] spirit of the
[1:01:34] father is going to come and Jesus is
[1:01:37] going to live in me now I'm going to
[1:01:40] begin to
[1:01:43] manifest not
[1:01:45] knowledge but
[1:01:48] manifest manifest the
[1:01:51] life and it all stems from love I love
[1:01:56] God so much I'm going to keep his
[1:01:58] Commandments and just by that simple
[1:02:00] fact
[1:02:02] now we meet the condition the Holy Ghost
[1:02:06] comes in do you get it he gives the Holy
[1:02:08] Ghost to them that obey him there's a
[1:02:11] condition that has to be met
[1:02:15] amen how are youall doing this
[1:02:19] morning you
[1:02:23] happy it we going to you is it time to
[1:02:25] stand up and
[1:02:29] sing all right verse
[1:02:33] 24 he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[1:02:38] Saints help us to love you
[1:02:40] Lord Jesus said the second commandment
[1:02:43] is liken unto the first love your
[1:02:45] neighbor as
[1:02:47] yourself so 1 John 4 1 John 4:19 and I
[1:02:52] got to go through a number of these
[1:02:53] scriptures just you know the more you
[1:02:54] can get behind it amen and get in with
[1:02:56] me the quicker I'll about able to go
[1:02:58] here we love him because he first loved
[1:03:01] us if a man say that I love God I love
[1:03:05] you Lord I love you but hates his
[1:03:11] brother he is a
[1:03:16] liar for he that loveth not his brother
[1:03:19] whom he have seen how can he love God
[1:03:21] whom he not seen so I'll just say it
[1:03:22] like this everybody feels they love God
[1:03:25] anybody talk to just about in the world
[1:03:27] that's uh whether they go to church
[1:03:29] don't go to church whatever it is oh
[1:03:30] yeah I love God he loves me I love
[1:03:36] him but it doesn't matter what they feel
[1:03:38] it doesn't ma matter what a man says it
[1:03:42] only matters what he
[1:03:46] lives so if he's talking ill of somebody
[1:03:51] something is
[1:03:52] wrong something is wrong
[1:03:56] somewhere and this is the Commandment
[1:03:58] which we've heard from him that he who
[1:04:01] loves God love his brother also now I'll
[1:04:05] tell you you know what it means to love
[1:04:07] your brother it means never ever ever
[1:04:11] ever ever do him any
[1:04:17] ill that's what that means don't do him
[1:04:20] any harm don't do him any
[1:04:22] ill but brother John I'm just human good
[1:04:26] get the Holy Ghost get more of the Holy
[1:04:28] Ghost I I'm okay with whatever you're
[1:04:31] going to say against that but I'm going
[1:04:32] to tell you there's a word for you to
[1:04:34] get better
[1:04:36] am because if we could all get in the
[1:04:39] condition that they were in the upper
[1:04:42] room right the Holy Ghost can fall and
[1:04:45] put us out there wining souls and never
[1:04:48] be afraid of what they're going to do to
[1:04:50] us amen CU that's what the happened to
[1:04:53] the disciples
[1:04:55] so I say to you if you love them that
[1:04:57] love
[1:04:58] you according Jesus what reward have
[1:05:03] you amen there are others that do that
[1:05:07] and if you salute just your favorite
[1:05:09] brother your favorite sister what do you
[1:05:12] more than
[1:05:14] others do not even the Publican Soul be
[1:05:17] ye therefore perfect even as your father
[1:05:19] which is Heaven is perfect oh this is so
[1:05:23] important this is the nature of God and
[1:05:26] we must get it we're not going into
[1:05:29] Rapture without the nature of God we're
[1:05:31] not nobody will go in the Rapture
[1:05:33] without the nature of
[1:05:35] God and in this age above every other
[1:05:39] age there will be more manifested Jesus
[1:05:42] Christ the life than in any other
[1:05:47] age so there is an high expectation that
[1:05:50] God has of us as we have an expectation
[1:05:54] of God that he would give us this
[1:05:55] promise that we're wanting are you with
[1:05:57] me all
[1:05:59] right he says in verse 44 but I say to
[1:06:02] you love your enemies bless them that
[1:06:04] curse you do good to them that hate you
[1:06:06] and pray for them that despitefully use
[1:06:08] you and persecute you now I will say
[1:06:12] this God is going to put every one of us
[1:06:15] in a wonderful opportunity to do
[1:06:19] that a wonderful opportunity to fulfill
[1:06:23] that scripture
[1:06:24] amen and in order for us to fulfill that
[1:06:27] scripture we're going to have to deny
[1:06:31] ourself but we're also going to need to
[1:06:34] be filled with the power of the Holy
[1:06:37] Ghost because it's that power of the
[1:06:40] Holy Ghost that sheds its love into our
[1:06:44] heart whereby now we can look at our
[1:06:47] enemies the same exact way that Jesus
[1:06:52] does because because it's no longer you
[1:06:55] you can stand next to wish there's a a
[1:06:59] picture of Paul here but he says it's
[1:07:02] not I but Christ that liveth in
[1:07:05] me that's that's what I'm interested in
[1:07:08] I'm interested in having so much of
[1:07:10] Christ in me there is no
[1:07:12] fear because perfect love cast out all
[1:07:16] fear fear is going to come it's going to
[1:07:20] show its ugly
[1:07:22] head
[1:07:27] just be so full of
[1:07:29] God nothing nothing can separate you
[1:07:32] from the love of
[1:07:36] God all
[1:07:39] right but I say unto you love your enemy
[1:07:43] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:07:44] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:07:46] despitefully use you and persecute is
[1:07:48] that is that a lot to do is that hard to
[1:07:50] do come on you those of you that that
[1:07:53] are not not getting into the service I'm
[1:07:55] speaking to you is is is is is this hard
[1:07:58] to
[1:07:59] do now look the believer can
[1:08:03] escape this corruption this Corruption
[1:08:06] of hate this Corruption of I don't like
[1:08:08] this Corruption of I'm not praying for
[1:08:10] them I'm just think of they don't do
[1:08:12] they did this to me that's
[1:08:15] corruption and the precious promise of
[1:08:17] God of his love you can escape those
[1:08:20] things do you see what I'm telling you
[1:08:24] yes that you may be the children of your
[1:08:26] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:08:28] the son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:08:31] good and he sth Reign on the just and
[1:08:33] the
[1:08:34] unjust in other words God is expecting
[1:08:39] you he's expecting your your
[1:08:43] son the Christ in you to rise on the
[1:08:49] evil to send your Reign your goodness
[1:08:52] not yours but Christ goodness in you
[1:08:55] upon those that hate you those that are
[1:08:58] evil toward
[1:09:01] you God is looking for the same thing in
[1:09:03] us that he
[1:09:06] is but how can it
[1:09:08] happen how the realness is Christ in you
[1:09:13] yes when Christ becomes so real in your
[1:09:17] life that it happens
[1:09:20] organically it just happens you don't
[1:09:23] got a must it
[1:09:26] up it just flows because he's in there
[1:09:30] to meet the need it's a realness and I
[1:09:33] would rather have that above all the
[1:09:35] knowledge above all the Mysteries above
[1:09:38] everything I would rather have the love
[1:09:40] of
[1:09:43] God brother Brandon said in the message
[1:09:48] Shalom he says and I've come to that
[1:09:52] spot I believe that people don't know
[1:09:55] what they're
[1:09:57] doing can you say
[1:09:59] Amen it comes to the time to where the
[1:10:03] human beings has looks like has become
[1:10:07] such a subject to evil until it's a
[1:10:11] pathetic
[1:10:13] thing it seems like there's a shadow of
[1:10:16] Darkness just over the people that
[1:10:19] presses
[1:10:21] them you can relate to this can you not
[1:10:24] he says like for instance this one thing
[1:10:28] crossing the nation around and speaking
[1:10:31] and the Lord God identifying and
[1:10:33] vindicating his word and showing that's
[1:10:36] exactly and never let nothing be said
[1:10:40] unless it come to pass exactly what he
[1:10:43] said speaking it right into existence
[1:10:47] and so forth and he's been doing as he's
[1:10:51] been doing and people just sit there and
[1:10:55] look at
[1:10:56] that and continue right on in their
[1:11:01] same
[1:11:06] condition now he's talking about
[1:11:09] Humanity who's not
[1:11:14] changing God's whole desire for the
[1:11:17] bride is to change amen of course he
[1:11:19] would that all men would be
[1:11:22] saved
[1:11:25] but only the predestinated are going to
[1:11:27] get serious about this
[1:11:30] word they're the only ones that going to
[1:11:32] get dressed in it start living it making
[1:11:35] sure they're doing it and
[1:11:38] change like we don't need to see the
[1:11:42] Miracles we've already see received the
[1:11:45] message of the
[1:11:46] hour and the message of the hour is
[1:11:49] leading us up to the Statue of a perfect
[1:11:52] man it's leading us into the image of
[1:11:56] Christ so I can say with brother B amen
[1:12:00] what a pathetic thing to see someone who
[1:12:03] doesn't want to
[1:12:06] grow come on
[1:12:13] now I'm I'm not here to to judge I I
[1:12:18] don't mind provoking you just to want to
[1:12:20] grow a little bit
[1:12:22] more
[1:12:27] I want to read this next quote it's in
[1:12:28] the adoption because there's a strong
[1:12:31] Spirit a strong leodan spirit in this
[1:12:34] message that they just don't care about
[1:12:37] getting any more love than what they
[1:12:40] already
[1:12:41] got they they they they they they they
[1:12:45] they they have this badge on them I'm in
[1:12:48] the message I know
[1:12:51] this and that's that's all it's
[1:12:54] needed so now remember this is an
[1:12:57] adoption for so this is maturity right
[1:13:00] when you're talking about adoption
[1:13:01] talking about maturity amen he said
[1:13:04] that's he said that that's what bothers
[1:13:09] me though to preach to you people don't
[1:13:14] remain on the same condition that you've
[1:13:17] been going he said change
[1:13:20] now exclamation point hear me as I say
[1:13:26] it thus saith the Lord I've never called
[1:13:31] myself this I'm not that but you call me
[1:13:35] your Prophet or a prophet the world
[1:13:37] believes that the world around millions
[1:13:40] and millions and millions of
[1:13:42] people I've spoke directly and
[1:13:45] indirectly I really want you to listen
[1:13:46] to this
[1:13:48] quote I've spoke directly and indirectly
[1:13:51] to tens or 12 milli million people or
[1:13:54] more directly speaking I've seen tens of
[1:13:57] thousands of visions and signs and
[1:13:59] wonders and not one of them has ever
[1:14:02] failed wow what a testimony I'd like to
[1:14:05] have that
[1:14:07] testimony and that's right he's foretold
[1:14:09] me things that's never failed to happen
[1:14:12] just
[1:14:13] exactly I'll bring any man to trial for
[1:14:16] that that's right now I don't claim to
[1:14:19] be a prophet but you listen to
[1:14:21] me thus sayith the Lord it'll take
[1:14:25] perfect love to put you in that
[1:14:29] place wow wow you're going to go through
[1:14:33] all that tell me all your
[1:14:35] credentials tell me how God's never
[1:14:37] failed all these Mighty things all these
[1:14:40] seals and everything these Mysteries
[1:14:42] that you've talked about and you're
[1:14:44] going to bring me back
[1:14:45] to perfect
[1:14:50] love and he's saying thus sayith the
[1:14:52] Lord to two
[1:14:55] times I think this is
[1:14:58] important I think it's a I'm going to
[1:15:00] stay with the
[1:15:01] word I'm going to stay with the
[1:15:05] message thus saith the Lord it'll take
[1:15:09] perfect love to put you in that place
[1:15:11] for that's all there was there in other
[1:15:16] words there was nobody saying look at me
[1:15:19] I'm better than
[1:15:22] you
[1:15:25] look at me I did
[1:15:27] this there's none of
[1:15:30] that none of
[1:15:32] it he says no matter what money how much
[1:15:36] religious
[1:15:38] demonstration how many Good Deeds you've
[1:15:40] done or whatever you've done that won't
[1:15:43] count nothing on that
[1:15:47] day it'll take perfect
[1:15:51] love he says so whatever you do you lay
[1:15:56] aside everything else until you are just
[1:15:59] so filled with the love of God till you
[1:16:03] can love those who hate
[1:16:08] you now first of all we can't stand
[1:16:11] being around anybody that hates
[1:16:16] us in fact when we see somebody that
[1:16:18] doesn't like us we
[1:16:21] just hey hey Teddy how you
[1:16:28] doing I want to get to that
[1:16:32] place I want to get to that place sister
[1:16:34] Linda and you know what that
[1:16:36] means that means I'm going be tried a
[1:16:39] lot that means there's going to be a lot
[1:16:41] of guns pointed at me there's going to
[1:16:43] be a lot of hateful things said about me
[1:16:45] behind my
[1:16:47] back but I want to pass the
[1:16:50] test I want to pass the test because
[1:16:53] this is not my
[1:16:56] home I'm getting out of
[1:16:58] here but I want what I need to get out
[1:17:01] of
[1:17:03] here you you know back before we had
[1:17:07] phones you had to make sure you had your
[1:17:10] ticket in your hand before you went to
[1:17:11] the
[1:17:17] airport the ticket is perfect
[1:17:22] love it comes from being so full of the
[1:17:26] Holy
[1:17:27] Ghost God sees you keeping all his
[1:17:30] Commandments that he just comes takes
[1:17:32] his bold in you and that Holy Ghost
[1:17:36] working through your life nothing phases
[1:17:38] you nothing separates you no hate no
[1:17:42] Hurt No
[1:17:44] Pain perfect love and to be able to
[1:17:48] demonstrate it don't you think your
[1:17:50] heavenly father looks down upon you and
[1:17:52] smiles
[1:17:55] every time somebody does something mean
[1:17:57] to you and you genuinely love them not
[1:18:00] some make fake thing not something you
[1:18:04] make up but something real inside of you
[1:18:07] you can love them as if they never done
[1:18:09] it yes
[1:18:11] sir I'll tell you that put you in
[1:18:13] harmony with heaven
[1:18:15] today that put you on the right course
[1:18:17] and I'll tell you you don't need some
[1:18:21] theology
[1:18:24] you just need to believe what's been
[1:18:28] spoken and I'll say it like this to to
[1:18:31] many of us we are so busy in our life
[1:18:34] we're not we're not obeying what the
[1:18:36] prophet
[1:18:38] said he said lay it
[1:18:41] aside lay your busy schedule
[1:18:44] aside lay aside what is so important to
[1:18:47] you and go after something instead of
[1:18:50] just thinking it's going to come because
[1:18:52] your name is John John Martin I don't
[1:18:54] care for your name is John Martin and
[1:18:55] ain't coming to you until you lay
[1:18:57] everything aside and go after it and
[1:18:59] make sure you get
[1:19:02] it to be able to to demonstrate perfect
[1:19:06] love this is the victory that overcometh
[1:19:08] the world even your faith when you have
[1:19:12] faith and what's faith faith is
[1:19:14] confidence now how do I know how do I
[1:19:18] know brother Dennis you're the closest
[1:19:20] one I don't want to pick on Brother
[1:19:21] Joseph right here
[1:19:24] but look how am I going to have
[1:19:26] confidence to overcome this world to
[1:19:28] escape the corruption through
[1:19:31] lust this brother slaps me on the face
[1:19:34] talks behind my back stabs me with some
[1:19:36] rotten
[1:19:38] words look the only way I know I've Got
[1:19:41] Confidence is when I pass the test and
[1:19:44] genuinely love him for give
[1:19:48] him then I can have
[1:19:50] confidence then I can have faith
[1:19:53] this is what overcomes the world but if
[1:19:55] I say oh you know I don't have to apply
[1:19:57] that scripture because God God knows how
[1:20:01] vicious this was how real this was God
[1:20:04] knows how much I was hurt God knows what
[1:20:06] it made me feel like God knows it wasn't
[1:20:08] right what does that have to do with one
[1:20:11] thing don't lean to your own
[1:20:14] understanding lean to God lean on God
[1:20:17] lean on that word let this word become
[1:20:19] your headship amen I'll tell you the
[1:20:22] I'll tell you the bride's hat is the
[1:20:24] word it is the word it is the word it is
[1:20:28] the word amen I'm starting to feel like
[1:20:31] I want like I I want to preach right
[1:20:36] now let talk about Joy I don't know if
[1:20:39] we're going to get through
[1:20:40] this love
[1:20:43] joy now people have their different
[1:20:46] ideas about
[1:20:49] Joy you know some people just
[1:20:51] get
[1:20:54] Joy when they're cutting
[1:20:58] up you know what I'm saying laughing it
[1:21:01] up cutting it
[1:21:03] up proverb says Folly is joy to him
[1:21:07] that's destitute of
[1:21:10] wisdom but a man of understanding
[1:21:12] walketh uprightly let's talk about the
[1:21:15] the promise of Joy how many wants
[1:21:18] joy we could all use joy and I'm G tell
[1:21:20] you it is it is so important to have
[1:21:25] joy Jesus said in John 1713 says and now
[1:21:29] come I to the he's praying to the father
[1:21:32] he says I come now to thee and these
[1:21:34] things I speak uh these things I spake
[1:21:37] in the world that they might have my joy
[1:21:42] fulfilled in
[1:21:46] themelves I want God's joy fulfilled in
[1:21:51] me
[1:21:53] Psalm 1611 says Thou will show me the
[1:21:55] path of life in thy presence is fullness
[1:21:58] of joy at thy right hand there are
[1:22:01] Pleasures forever more so right in the
[1:22:06] presence of God are these precious
[1:22:09] Promises of Joy so we see the condition
[1:22:13] don't try to get the joy of the Lord
[1:22:16] without being in his presence amen when
[1:22:19] you know You' said something done
[1:22:21] something that griev
[1:22:23] G God maybe nobody knows about it but
[1:22:27] you grieve
[1:22:29] God I mean you got to take care of that
[1:22:32] thing you why because you got to get
[1:22:35] back into the presence of the Lord
[1:22:37] because that's where fullness of joy is
[1:22:39] that see people try to get the promise
[1:22:42] of God without the condition of
[1:22:46] God Joy is not just having a good
[1:22:50] time Joy is one of the most important
[1:22:52] fruits to have bearing in the believer's
[1:22:54] life and I'm going to tell you why it's
[1:22:56] crucial for our
[1:22:58] trials it's not about being
[1:23:00] happy it's not about feeling
[1:23:04] good Nehemiah says for the joy of the
[1:23:07] Lord is your
[1:23:09] strength the joy you need the strength
[1:23:13] that comes from the joy of the Lord to
[1:23:15] go through your
[1:23:17] trials so if we want joy we need to
[1:23:21] spend time in prayer get in the presence
[1:23:22] of God wait on the Lord and he promised
[1:23:25] that they that wait upon the Lord he
[1:23:27] shall renew their strength so how does
[1:23:29] he do it he gives them Joy well I tell
[1:23:32] you when the presence of God comes you
[1:23:34] get joy I don't care if you're crying I
[1:23:37] don't care if you're laughing you get
[1:23:39] joy when the presence of the Lord comes
[1:23:43] you do do I'll say it like this even
[1:23:46] when God's presence comes and You Feel
[1:23:48] So Unworthy God I'm not worthy you you
[1:23:52] repent can't you make things right I'm
[1:23:54] telling you tears make uh uh you may sow
[1:23:58] tears uh but they'll come forth reaping
[1:24:01] Joy the Bible tells us if we we sow
[1:24:03] tears of tears that will come forth
[1:24:06] reaping joy and I believe that if it's
[1:24:09] what you sow if you you repent you you
[1:24:12] get out of yourself and you say God I'm
[1:24:14] not worthy of you just fill me with your
[1:24:16] presence in his presence is fullness of
[1:24:19] joy
[1:24:21] amen
[1:24:23] they that soow tears shall reap in
[1:24:26] Joy all right we need spiritual strength
[1:24:29] to go through our trials do you believe
[1:24:30] that sometimes you're going through a
[1:24:31] try say I just I forget I'm I'm done
[1:24:33] with this I'm not doing it no more I've
[1:24:36] tried are you with
[1:24:38] me that's not the joy of the Lord that's
[1:24:41] not the fruit of God Isaiah 12:3 says
[1:24:44] therefore with joy shall ye draw water
[1:24:47] out of the wells of
[1:24:50] Salvation with joy you shall draw Waters
[1:24:53] out of the wells of Salvation amen now I
[1:24:57] would like to say for a moment
[1:24:59] H it takes
[1:25:02] effort to deny our flesh to come into
[1:25:06] this church and start drawing from the
[1:25:10] wells you just can't come in here with
[1:25:12] all your problems not caring always down
[1:25:16] the dumps always expecting God just to
[1:25:18] come no matter what your attitude is it
[1:25:21] takes effort if anybody's ever drawn
[1:25:24] water out of a
[1:25:26] well it takes
[1:25:29] effort I I don't think Rebecca just sat
[1:25:32] there and pushed the button for
[1:25:35] Isaac for eler I'm sorry for
[1:25:40] aler no draw and you know what she has
[1:25:43] so much joy hey I'm not only going to
[1:25:46] draw water for you I'm going to draw
[1:25:47] water for your camels and we know how
[1:25:50] much brother Bruce we know how much
[1:25:52] water she had to draw
[1:25:55] amen that's a lot of
[1:25:57] work we want the joy of Salvation we
[1:26:01] want God's presence but what do we do
[1:26:03] when we come in here don't want to
[1:26:05] draw sit here make that song leader let
[1:26:09] him let him do all the work make us feel
[1:26:13] good don't feed on the word don't hunger
[1:26:17] for the
[1:26:19] word and
[1:26:21] expect have the joy of the Lord Brother
[1:26:25] sister it ain't the preaching it ain't
[1:26:27] the singing it ain't because we're
[1:26:28] lacking instruments in here it's we're
[1:26:30] lacking a vision for God that's what it
[1:26:34] is yeah we we brought hey we just
[1:26:36] brought the tidwells here they lit up
[1:26:38] the place they lit up the
[1:26:48] place let me ask you do you got that
[1:26:50] same Joy
[1:26:54] is if you bring that same joy to church
[1:26:57] you will draw from the wells of Living
[1:27:02] Water if if I understand the
[1:27:05] scripture to the hungry every bitter
[1:27:09] thing is
[1:27:12] sweet we should not have any
[1:27:15] problem now we need the strength that
[1:27:19] comes only through Joy
[1:27:24] the joy of the Lord gives us strength to
[1:27:26] endure to be forbearing to be
[1:27:28] longsuffering to deal with our brothers
[1:27:30] and sisters to deal with our spouses to
[1:27:33] deal with our family members it takes
[1:27:35] the joy of the
[1:27:38] Lord uh Paul said I Endure all things
[1:27:41] for the elect sake so he must have had
[1:27:43] Joy Jesus had joy for the joy that was
[1:27:46] set before him he endured the cross you
[1:27:48] see Joy is important not just to feel
[1:27:50] good but to better go through your
[1:27:52] trials properly so you don't murmur you
[1:27:54] don't
[1:27:57] complain Paul said I can do all things
[1:27:59] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:28:02] who continues to give me
[1:28:07] joy a believer that doesn't have
[1:28:10] joy doesn't have strength he's going to
[1:28:14] fizzle
[1:28:16] out he's just going to fizzle out he's
[1:28:19] just going to all a sudden I I'm just
[1:28:21] going to go to church cuz it's time for
[1:28:23] church I'm just going to get on I'm
[1:28:25] going to go to work cuz it's time to go
[1:28:26] to
[1:28:28] work it just Fizzles out does it not be
[1:28:31] doesn't bear the fruit of the
[1:28:33] spirit are you with
[1:28:36] me our joy has ways of Disappearing how
[1:28:40] many truly has you you feel you you're
[1:28:44] you're missing the joy of the Lord in
[1:28:46] your heart all right just be be honest
[1:28:49] those of you that don't want to
[1:28:51] participate
[1:28:55] David said restore unto me the joy of
[1:28:59] thy
[1:29:01] salvation The Joy restore
[1:29:04] it we didn't
[1:29:07] lose
[1:29:09] salvation but I'll tell you what we did
[1:29:12] lose a closeness that we once had with
[1:29:15] God showing us that our relationship can
[1:29:18] be real close and be further away from
[1:29:20] Goden
[1:29:23] and this is important for us to see
[1:29:24] maybe if if Joy is missing maybe we got
[1:29:26] to dive in to to to just seeing God is
[1:29:32] there anything there that I should be
[1:29:35] doing just spend some time waiting for
[1:29:37] him on prayer if there is anything he'll
[1:29:40] show you he'll tell you you ever been in
[1:29:43] prayer and conviction just comes that
[1:29:47] you know what that is that's the Holy
[1:29:49] Ghost that's the Holy Ghost he's he's
[1:29:51] brighter than our hearts and then when
[1:29:54] we take care of it we have confidence
[1:29:56] that confidence gives us Faith to
[1:29:57] believe for the presence and then more
[1:29:59] joy comes into our life that's how it
[1:30:01] works we meet conditions that's what
[1:30:04] this whole thing is about amen now
[1:30:07] there's so many scriptures that I have
[1:30:09] to pass up because it's
[1:30:12] late
[1:30:16] H we have Wednesday we
[1:30:20] do
[1:30:28] H you know I really really
[1:30:34] really really have a lot of
[1:30:37] [Laughter]
[1:30:42] hair sometimes we do things that grieve
[1:30:44] the
[1:30:46] Lord sometimes we don't do things that
[1:30:48] Grieves the
[1:30:50] Lord and all of a
[1:30:53] sudden we keep doing that and then after
[1:30:56] a while we're missing joy and then we
[1:31:00] don't have strength to even do the
[1:31:01] things that we were
[1:31:04] doing and so Joy is such an
[1:31:08] important it's important promise for the
[1:31:14] believer it gives you strength to serve
[1:31:16] God the way you ought to serve God when
[1:31:20] I think about Paul when he was being
[1:31:24] told the Bible tells us that he was gone
[1:31:28] Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not
[1:31:30] knowing the things that shall befall him
[1:31:32] save the Holy Ghost is witnessing in
[1:31:34] every city that bonds and afflictions
[1:31:36] abide
[1:31:37] me who would want to go somewhere where
[1:31:40] you got trouble getting
[1:31:42] there you know what we do we we avoid
[1:31:45] talking to somebody on the phone when we
[1:31:47] think there's going to be
[1:31:50] trouble we avoid a text we avoid a
[1:31:52] handshake we here was a man that was not
[1:31:57] moved that's what I love what he had he
[1:32:00] says but none of these things move me
[1:32:02] neither count I my life dear unto myself
[1:32:05] so that I may finish my course with
[1:32:09] what
[1:32:11] joy
[1:32:12] joy strength he wasn't moved he had
[1:32:16] strength he was willing to do anything
[1:32:18] God wanted him to do amen and I know
[1:32:20] some of us feel so strong that we'll go
[1:32:22] up to some demon-possessed person and
[1:32:24] we'll just knock him in the face in the
[1:32:26] name of
[1:32:27] Jesus and I understand all that but do
[1:32:31] we have enough Faith to just get under
[1:32:33] our knees and be faithful in our prayer
[1:32:36] closet do we have enough Faith just just
[1:32:38] to come to church
[1:32:40] early get in the prayer room and pray
[1:32:43] for your brothers and
[1:32:45] sisters do you have you have enough
[1:32:47] Faith to to apply the thing that you
[1:32:49] heard the last sermon you listen
[1:32:53] to the last one you live stream the last
[1:32:56] tape you listen
[1:32:58] to the last time somebody sent you a
[1:33:01] text and said oh you know what that was
[1:33:03] just for me I needed
[1:33:05] that but then do we apply it you know
[1:33:08] what I'm talking about we'll take that
[1:33:10] little 60c word of encouragement but
[1:33:13] then what we do we let it
[1:33:16] go help us
[1:33:20] Lord brother Brandon said in the message
[1:33:24] where has thy strength gone
[1:33:27] Samson God's Bible says that he's the
[1:33:30] same yesterday today and forever and his
[1:33:35] power is the
[1:33:37] same they've come too late to tell me
[1:33:40] about it see I've experienced it I know
[1:33:42] what I'm talking about he's still God
[1:33:45] and he'll always be God and he is just
[1:33:48] as much God right here in this building
[1:33:51] tonight as he was on the day of
[1:33:53] Pentecost now we've got the same
[1:33:56] blessings the same thing
[1:33:58] if he can get the people in the same
[1:34:05] condition the same thing will operate
[1:34:09] every
[1:34:13] time we're looking to
[1:34:17] God to do all the work to bring these
[1:34:20] promises that we're wanting
[1:34:23] and the prophet is telling us that we've
[1:34:25] got to get in the same condition because
[1:34:28] God will do what he promised to do
[1:34:31] because he's God and he will not
[1:34:33] change see we're not
[1:34:36] fighting one
[1:34:39] another we're not fighting the
[1:34:41] denominations we're not fighting
[1:34:44] Hamas we're not fighting
[1:34:46] Russia we're not fighting
[1:34:49] China we're fighting principalities
[1:34:52] we're fighting spirits that are trying
[1:34:54] to keep us in a lukewarm Spirit that's
[1:34:57] what we're
[1:34:59] fighting I'll tell you I don't what are
[1:35:02] we waiting
[1:35:05] for we need men and women to rise up and
[1:35:08] say this day I give my all to the Lord
[1:35:11] this day I'm not waiting till tomorrow
[1:35:15] and you know what here's the sad thing
[1:35:17] we got to do it every
[1:35:19] day I I uh I like the inspiration that
[1:35:24] uh Sister Anne had when brother darl
[1:35:26] preached that message here in our church
[1:35:29] oh back in
[1:35:34] 2014 she was inspired to have that put
[1:35:37] on a
[1:35:38] plaque and we got it hanging in the back
[1:35:40] there this day I Give My All to Jesus
[1:35:43] Christ what I love about it is it wasn't
[1:35:46] just a good
[1:35:48] sermon it was something to live by
[1:35:52] it's something to live
[1:35:55] by God is calling us to live by these
[1:36:00] precious promises to take them take the
[1:36:03] conditions and build our confidence
[1:36:06] build our faith amen being confident of
[1:36:10] this very thing he which begun a good
[1:36:11] work he's going to finish it Joshua said
[1:36:14] every place that The Souls of your feet
[1:36:17] tread upon it's yours but be courageous
[1:36:20] be strong
[1:36:22] to do what to observe
[1:36:25] everything in the word of God Amen put
[1:36:28] the Yoke on make sure you do your
[1:36:31] condition because if you meet the
[1:36:34] condition God is Duty bound to give you
[1:36:36] whatever you're asking for whatever you
[1:36:39] ask in my name if you can believe all
[1:36:41] things are
[1:36:44] possible what I love about this little
[1:36:47] series it's little just three
[1:36:50] parts
[1:36:52] it it shows us how I can build my
[1:36:56] faith JW said building yourself up in
[1:36:59] the most holy faith faith comes by
[1:37:03] hearing hearing by the word of God we've
[1:37:06] heard the word of God the word of God is
[1:37:08] telling us to start meeting his
[1:37:10] conditions right and when you meet the
[1:37:14] conditions then you have
[1:37:17] confidence then you can l a greater
[1:37:20] claim
[1:37:22] how many times have we
[1:37:28] heard sometimes God puts things on
[1:37:30] people for a reason right hey we got
[1:37:34] this in the Old Testament how many times
[1:37:36] did God allow the Philistines to come on
[1:37:38] the children of Israel because they were
[1:37:41] being
[1:37:42] disobedient because they weren't
[1:37:44] following the conditions of the word
[1:37:45] amen and only thing God wanted them to
[1:37:48] do was repent make things right and that
[1:37:52] there would be nobody to be able to
[1:37:53] stand before them all the days of their
[1:37:54] life I think in the spiritual realm that
[1:37:57] we're in we deal with Spirit sometimes
[1:37:59] that I'll be honest with you we've let
[1:38:01] come into our home we've let come into
[1:38:04] our
[1:38:04] life we we we've let just surround us
[1:38:08] and then we we come to church and we're
[1:38:09] hoping that there be some sort of
[1:38:11] miracle that happens where we don't have
[1:38:14] to do anything and God just delivers us
[1:38:16] from
[1:38:18] that well maybe God is wanting us to H
[1:38:21] humble ourselves before him call upon
[1:38:25] him I
[1:38:28] mean humble yourself under the mighty
[1:38:31] hand of God that he may lift you up well
[1:38:33] he can Li well why can't he just lift me
[1:38:35] up now brother John I want to be lifted
[1:38:37] up God is wanting you to get to a place
[1:38:41] where he can develop his character in
[1:38:44] you his nature so that Divine image of
[1:38:48] God that's what he's looking for if we
[1:38:50] lose sight of what God's trying to do in
[1:38:53] our life we may miss the importance of
[1:38:55] seeing why it's so important to obey the
[1:38:57] word amen God bless you let's stand
[1:39:05] together I love this word I'll tell you
[1:39:07] it's been a great blessing to
[1:39:16] me it's helped me to look at things
[1:39:19] differently that I probably get in the
[1:39:21] way
[1:39:24] of God accomplishing His blessings more
[1:39:28] than I
[1:39:32] realize either
[1:39:34] way we need to wait on the Lord because
[1:39:37] we get
[1:39:38] joy we give God a chance to speak to
[1:39:42] us a and then we get a chance to walk in
[1:39:45] his
[1:39:46] will I believe that we have a lot of
[1:39:50] tests coming don't
[1:39:53] you um we're going to turn on this air
[1:39:56] probably should have did that
[1:39:58] before you just you make it so hot in
[1:40:02] here you brought so much Holy Ghost with
[1:40:03] you you just like really putting this
[1:40:05] place on fire we're going to have to not
[1:40:09] quench the Holy Ghost but just get that
[1:40:11] the temperature a little bit cooler
[1:40:13] here he's going to shake heaven and
[1:40:16] earth right the bombs are coming that's
[1:40:19] true amen one day the door will be
[1:40:23] closed you will not even be able to call
[1:40:27] your
[1:40:28] favorite
[1:40:30] preacher favorite brother your favorite
[1:40:32] sister you won't be able to do
[1:40:36] that at that point time is running out
[1:40:40] very very quickly at that at that moment
[1:40:43] you don't have time to re-evaluate how
[1:40:48] you want to spend your time with God
[1:40:50] because we we're panicking where's our
[1:40:52] food going to come from do I have faith
[1:40:55] to pray my food on the table right now
[1:40:59] look this word that God has given us
[1:41:02] let's get serious about it it's
[1:41:06] real and I I don't believe G
[1:41:11] God is holding back any truth from
[1:41:16] us I believe he's given us everything
[1:41:19] that we needed that pain to life and
[1:41:22] godliness I believe it it's up to us
[1:41:26] when we leave
[1:41:29] here to love that word to love it I love
[1:41:33] it I want him to take a greater Abode in
[1:41:36] me so I'm gonna I'm gonna Ponder these
[1:41:39] things I'm gonna pray about these things
[1:41:41] and I'm gonna I'm gonna become more in
[1:41:42] love with God what's it going to do it's
[1:41:44] going to produce more of an
[1:41:46] obedience may God bless us with that is
[1:41:49] is my my prayer
[1:41:53] amen let's let's sing uh I know the Lord
[1:41:56] will make a way for me
[1:42:02] amen I know the
[1:42:05] Lord will make a
[1:42:08] way for
[1:42:13] me and I know the Lord will make a
[1:42:18] way for me
[1:42:24] if I live a holy life sh the wrong and
[1:42:31] do the right I know the Lord will make
