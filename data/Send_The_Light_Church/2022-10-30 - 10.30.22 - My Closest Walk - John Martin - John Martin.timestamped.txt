[34:30] and other reasons and we just ask that

[34:37] Lord that

[34:43] they can't be here and I know that

[34:47] reveal to them your great love and give
[34:51] them strength and support and and direct
[34:53] them for their lives Lord we just ask

[35:03] father Lord all those that would be in a
[35:06] back sliding condition Lord we ask that
[35:09] you would be with them too that you
[35:11] would speak to their hearts in this late
[35:13] hour and call them back to the house of
[35:15] the Lord to you Lord to fellowship with
[35:19] you Lord as we look into your word today
[35:22] Lord we are truly hopeless without you

[35:30] Lord we need you we need you to give us
[35:32] revelation of these words
[35:36] draw Us close to you father bless the
[35:39] reading of your word to each of our
[35:41] hearts Lord we ask that you take control
[35:44] of our lips our mind and Lord that we
[35:47] would speak only those things that you
[35:49] would have to be spoken and father at
[35:52] the end of the service in the days to
[35:55] come we will give you the glory and the
[35:57] honor for all these things for we humbly
[35:59] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[36:03] James chapter 4. I want to read just the
[36:06] first verse and then drop down to verse
[36:08] 5 from whence cometh Wars and fightings
[36:12] among you come they not hence even of
[36:16] your lust that war in your members now I
[36:19] want to entitle this message my closest
[36:21] walk we all want a closer walk with the
[36:24] Lord
[36:26] but there there are things that uh are
[36:29] warring against us from having that
[36:31] close walk and there's things that we
[36:33] have to do to get the close walk we
[36:36] understand that
[36:38] um there's a battle and we have to to to
[36:40] win the battle to get the closer walk
[36:43] amen verse five do you think that the
[36:46] scripture saith in vain the spirit that
[36:48] dwelleth in us lusteth to envir to ill
[36:51] will to do our own will but he giveth
[36:53] more grace wherefore he saith God
[36:56] resisteth the proud but giveth Grace
[37:00] unto the humble
[37:02] submit yourselves therefore
[37:05] to God Amen amen that's the first thing
[37:07] then resist the devil and he will flee
[37:10] from you so there's a submission that's
[37:13] required draw nigh to God and He will
[37:16] draw nigh unto you
[37:19] and how do we draw an eye to God cleanse
[37:22] your hands
[37:23] you Sinners purify your hearts you
[37:26] double-minded be afflicted and mourn and
[37:29] weep let your laughter be turned a
[37:31] morning in your joy to heaviness
[37:34] so he's describing to us that the act of
[37:37] humility that needs to transpire before
[37:40] our Closer Walk humble yourselves
[37:44] in the sight of the Lord and He Shall
[37:48] lift you up amen amen God bless you may
[37:52] be seated
[37:55] by Brother Branham
[37:57] made mention
[37:59] that God would not take
[38:02] a man until he is most ready so he's not
[38:04] going to take a soul until it's most
[38:06] ready that gives us confidence
[38:09] and when we're talking about our closest
[38:11] walk our closest walk could be at that
[38:14] time
[38:16] it could be because we think about Enoch
[38:18] and he walked with with in the testimony
[38:21] that he walked with the Lord every day
[38:23] and as we're told that he just he kept
[38:26] walking closer and closer and closer and
[38:30] he he was walking so close to God that
[38:33] he was actually walking closer to Heaven
[38:35] than Earth and God just took him
[38:38] and I I believe that's you know we're
[38:40] all waiting for the coming Lord we're
[38:43] waiting for the Rapture we're waiting
[38:44] for things to happen but as we're
[38:46] waiting we should be drawing closer to
[38:49] God
[38:50] because that's what we need to get ready
[38:54] turn with me if you would to First John
[38:57] chapter one
[38:59] and this was going to be my my opening
[39:02] scripture but uh
[39:06] uh we're gonna put these together now
[39:09] brother Branham did say
[39:12] that
[39:14] that if we grieve the Holy Spirit which
[39:17] we can
[39:18] we can grieve the Lord
[39:22] um
[39:22] and displease them and if we begin to do
[39:26] things that we shouldn't brother Branham
[39:28] taught us that the holy spirit will will
[39:31] kind of take its flight go sit on a line
[39:33] or a pole and he'll just stay there and
[39:37] watch until we're ready to change our
[39:40] attitude and our nature
[39:45] and
[39:46] um so God allows three more agency to
[39:50] transpire
[39:51] in us but that doesn't mean that he's
[39:55] always going to be there
[39:57] you know there are things that we have
[40:00] to do to keep God happy
[40:03] and and when we go off to do our own
[40:05] will uh the flesh is enmity with God so
[40:08] there's not going to be any any true
[40:11] connection there so we have to be
[40:12] somewhat conscious and caring about what
[40:15] kind of attitude we're packing and how
[40:17] we're how how we feel at all times
[40:20] all right first John chapter 1 verse 1
[40:22] says
[40:24] um
[40:24] uh that that which was from the
[40:27] beginning which we have heard which we
[40:30] have seen with our eyes which we have
[40:32] looked upon
[40:34] with our hands
[40:36] uh and our hands have handled of the
[40:39] word of life
[40:41] for the life was manifested we seen it
[40:44] bear witness and show unto you that
[40:47] eternal life which was with the father
[40:49] and was manifested unto us that which we
[40:53] have seen and heard declare we unto you
[40:55] that
[40:56] ye Also may have fellowship with us and
[40:59] that truly our fellowship is with the
[41:01] father and and with his son Jesus Christ
[41:03] and these things right we unto you that
[41:06] your joy may be full there's a purpose
[41:08] that we're writing it this then is the
[41:11] message which we have heard of him and
[41:13] declaring to you that God is light and
[41:15] in him is no Darkness at all
[41:19] none if we say that we have fellowship
[41:22] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[41:24] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[41:26] light as he is in the light we have
[41:27] Fellowship one with another the blood of
[41:30] Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from
[41:33] all sins
[41:35] and if we say that we have no sin
[41:38] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[41:40] not in US but if we confess our sins he
[41:43] is faithful and just to forgive us of
[41:46] our sins and to cleanse us from our
[41:47] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[41:50] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[41:53] word is not in US
[41:57] amen those are these are some very
[42:00] powerful scriptures and I had a thought
[42:02] where I was going to be going for this
[42:05] Sunday
[42:06] and I just felt
[42:08] Lord I need to hear from you yeah I
[42:11] could go with this uh that it was going
[42:15] to go with that says that's not good
[42:17] enough for me it would have been the
[42:18] word it would have been truth and it
[42:20] would have been I believe edifying but I
[42:22] wasn't satisfied with that I wanted to
[42:24] hear from God and when this this set of
[42:28] scriptures came to me I knew he was in
[42:32] it and I can have confidence today that
[42:35] we're not just hearing the word of God
[42:37] being preached but we're here in a
[42:39] Pacific a specific word that God wants
[42:42] for us in this church
[42:44] we can have confidence in that Christ is
[42:48] the word the Bible says in John 1 1 that
[42:50] in the beginning was the word the word
[42:52] was with God and the Word was God
[42:56] the same was in the beginning and all
[42:58] things were made by him without him
[43:00] there there was nothing made that was
[43:02] made
[43:03] in Colossians 1 tells us for you don't
[43:06] have to turn here but but we're just
[43:08] going to be uh sharing some scriptures
[43:10] for by him were all things created that
[43:14] are in heaven that are Earth visible and
[43:16] invisible whether it be Thrones Dominion
[43:19] principalities Powers all things were
[43:20] created by Him and for him we're talking
[43:24] about the greatness of our God that was
[43:27] in the beginning amen we're going
[43:30] somewhere with this for he is before all
[43:33] things and by him all things consist and
[43:36] he is the head of the body the church so
[43:38] who is the head of our church
[43:40] who's the true Shepherd of the church
[43:43] that's right that's right
[43:46] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[43:49] the dead that in all things he might
[43:52] have the preeminence Christ is supposed
[43:55] to have the preeminence in here there's
[43:57] a lot of times we feel that things
[43:59] should be this way or that way or this
[44:01] is we understand that there's a
[44:03] difference is that we all have but
[44:05] Christ is the one that must have
[44:08] preeminence so when we're talking about
[44:10] I want a closer walk with God I want to
[44:12] be drawn closer to God he needs to have
[44:15] preeminence we need to Humble ourselves
[44:17] under the mighty hand of God that he
[44:19] could be preeminent amen
[44:21] amen all right first John or John
[44:23] chapter 1 verse 4 going back to that in
[44:25] him was life in him was life and the
[44:29] life was the light of men
[44:34] his life becomes our light
[44:38] when his Spirit comes in US
[44:41] that is our light
[44:43] not the knowledge of the word now
[44:46] the understanding of the word
[44:48] but his Spirit his life becomes our
[44:52] light amen and the light shineth in dark
[44:57] plate in darkness and darkness
[45:00] comprehended it not
[45:04] wow
[45:09] like how many times have we heard light
[45:12] okay so I remember as you all know we
[45:15] all experience things like this when I
[45:17] first came to to Christ and I learned
[45:21] that I that having my long hair was not
[45:25] according to the gospel it was not
[45:28] according to light and I remember
[45:30] thinking that's strange what does my
[45:33] hair have anything to do with my
[45:35] relationship with God
[45:37] so the darkness inside of me was not
[45:40] comprehending the light
[45:43] but light still light
[45:46] so God requires us to walk in the light
[45:48] not to understand the light
[45:50] understanding comes down the road right
[45:53] now we know according to Saint John
[45:55] chapter 1 verse 14 the word that was in
[45:58] the beginning it was made flesh and it
[46:01] dwelt among us and we Behold The Glory
[46:05] we bear out his glory the glory of the
[46:07] only begotten of the father full of what
[46:09] Grace and Truth
[46:13] the invisible word of God became visible
[46:17] for Humanity to see in Jesus Christ
[46:21] that's why the prophet said if you can't
[46:22] see Jesus Christ in every scripture go
[46:26] back and read it because we miss
[46:29] something
[46:31] he is the word he's in every scripture
[46:34] he's he's he's hidden these scriptures
[46:37] but it is him it is his word you can
[46:40] have confidence when you're reading that
[46:42] that's God
[46:42] [Music]
[46:46] now the life of the word
[46:48] has been manifested
[46:52] you can have the word without the life
[46:56] that's the tree of knowledge
[46:58] you can have the word
[47:01] and yet not do you any good
[47:04] the scripture tells us for the letter
[47:07] killeth
[47:08] but the spirit of the word is what gives
[47:11] life
[47:13] so we want to focus on the life of the
[47:15] word
[47:17] because the knowledge of the word is
[47:19] just going to condemn us
[47:21] going to make us feel defeated we not
[47:24] obeying but we want is the life of it
[47:27] and that has to do with our heart
[47:29] falling in love with God
[47:33] it is the spirit of God
[47:36] because
[47:39] the word is beautiful when you read it
[47:43] but if your heart is not I want to I
[47:46] want this word in me I want to please
[47:49] the Lord I want to I want to have
[47:51] fellowship with him well then you're
[47:54] you're you're losing the spirit part of
[47:56] the word
[47:58] so that the letter will eventually kill
[48:00] us
[48:01] you know condemn us convict convict us
[48:05] and will just feel like
[48:07] um
[48:07] discouraged and down
[48:10] but you get in the presence of God and
[48:12] your your heart just is yearning to have
[48:16] this inside living and manifested and
[48:20] walking into light well then that spirit
[48:23] is what has given us light his spirit is
[48:27] the light of man
[48:29] that's right
[48:31] so the spirit of the word was manifested
[48:34] and it became the light for men to walk
[48:38] in and now the disciples had bore
[48:40] witness of this invisible God becoming
[48:44] visible to them they handled they
[48:47] touched this invisible word of God they
[48:50] looked upon it they looked upon the
[48:52] invisible word because now it was
[48:54] manifested they seen Miracles after
[48:57] Miracles take place the dead were raised
[49:00] the dumb speak the the death here the
[49:02] bodies were restored
[49:04] Jesus taught and astonished the
[49:08] religious people of his day when he was
[49:10] 12 years old
[49:12] Nicodemus said we know that thou are a
[49:14] teacher come from God for no man can do
[49:16] these Miracles that thou doest except
[49:18] God be with him
[49:22] you know the greatest miracle that these
[49:25] disciples witnessed wasn't Lazarus
[49:27] raising from the dead
[49:29] wasn't the 5 000 being fed it wasn't the
[49:33] creation of fishes it wasn't the
[49:36] Discerning of men's hearts
[49:39] they didn't just witness the power of
[49:41] creation
[49:43] they witnessed the power of restoration
[49:48] which really teaches us a lot about the
[49:51] nature of God
[49:53] God is not a God to throw away the clay
[49:56] right
[49:59] if it don't work out he just don't go
[50:01] I'm done with it
[50:06] Philippians 1 6 is being confident of
[50:08] this very thing he which had begun a
[50:10] good work in you will perform it unto
[50:13] the day of Jesus Christ
[50:15] Hebrews 13 5 he has said I will never
[50:18] leave thee nor forsake thee amen he's
[50:21] not throwing us away just because of the
[50:25] flaws
[50:26] he doesn't throw away the clay because
[50:28] of the flaws
[50:32] he'll fix them
[50:35] his blood will cover them
[50:38] but he's not throwing it away
[50:40] Romans 8 39 nothing shall be able to
[50:43] separate us from the love of God which
[50:45] is in Christ Jesus our lord
[50:48] nothing
[50:52] we need to receive more of the spirit of
[50:54] God not just the knowledge of God but
[50:56] the spirit of God
[50:57] and the love of God is shed abroad in
[51:01] our heart by what the spirit of God
[51:04] the spirit of the word
[51:07] the spirit of the word is what gives us
[51:10] that love
[51:12] to love others yes
[51:15] to to to to
[51:17] um turn the cheat to go the second mile
[51:19] to to to to to overlook certain things
[51:22] because that love covers is still
[51:25] covering today there's still Power in
[51:27] the Blood
[51:29] sure is
[51:33] John 1 12 says but as many as received
[51:37] him to them gave he power to become the
[51:40] sons of God even to them that believed
[51:42] on his name all we do is receive him but
[51:47] truly receive the word into our life
[51:52] you can't receive Christ without
[51:54] receiving the word amen
[51:56] which were born not of blood nor the
[51:59] will of Flesh nor of the will man but of
[52:02] God so we must be born again of the
[52:05] spirit of God we need a a different
[52:08] Spirit to be motivating us I understand
[52:12] that
[52:13] you know this seems like a very hard
[52:15] thing but we're talking about something
[52:17] very serious and this is our soul
[52:20] our soul is never going to get perfected
[52:22] by our efforts
[52:24] we need to die out to our efforts we
[52:28] need to surrender our life to God and we
[52:30] need to God to come in and create a new
[52:33] nature inside of us amen
[52:35] just trying to encourage you here John
[52:37] chapter 10 verse 28 says and I give unto
[52:40] them eternal life
[52:42] and they shall never perish neither
[52:45] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[52:51] My Father which is which gave them me is
[52:55] greater than all and no man is able to
[52:59] pluck them out of my father's hand
[53:03] about the security that we have in
[53:07] Christ
[53:08] I mean the power of regeneration which
[53:12] is really what transpires in all of our
[53:14] lives
[53:16] we were not created perfect like Adam
[53:20] we were we were created with ugly
[53:23] natures and to be honest with you is our
[53:25] opening scripture it pops out once in a
[53:28] while
[53:29] really does but we're in the process
[53:32] of being transformed
[53:35] amen regenerated into a new creature
[53:38] where all things are passed away behold
[53:40] all things
[53:42] are not just new but they're of God
[53:45] and God is holding us so that no matter
[53:49] how many times we fall or slip or get
[53:52] away or backslide or have wrong thoughts
[53:55] God is not throwing away the clay
[53:58] thank you the bride is secure
[54:02] but she's not relaxed in laodicea amen
[54:05] she's anchored but she's always
[54:07] abounding in the work of the Lord
[54:12] God doesn't throw away the clay just
[54:16] because of the flaws he's not going to
[54:18] throw us away just because of
[54:20] I know we all feel like we got problems
[54:23] that is beyond everybody else's we all
[54:26] feel that way it's a natural way of
[54:28] feeling
[54:29] but God is not looking at those things
[54:31] his focus is on getting us regenerated
[54:35] and that needs to be our Focus
[54:39] he's just going to put us back on the
[54:41] potter's wheel
[54:42] we need it you know if we don't we that
[54:46] flaw will stay there
[54:48] we have to be in his complete image
[54:50] right
[54:51] now Ephesians 5 27 God is going to
[54:53] present to himself a glorious church not
[54:56] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[54:59] but that it should be holy and without
[55:02] blemish
[55:04] wow
[55:07] that's a
[55:09] I know we read that scripture and we
[55:11] think how in the world am I going to
[55:13] become that
[55:15] in ourselves it is impossible
[55:20] and as long as we're in this this
[55:22] Cockapoo this pest house it will be a
[55:26] pest
[55:28] to the Deep desires of our heart
[55:31] but what happens is because that of that
[55:34] true statement and not having a
[55:36] revelation of what that really means
[55:40] the devil often convinces us when
[55:43] nobody's perfect
[55:45] so you know
[55:47] you know we're all we're just going to
[55:48] have these flaws so you know that is
[55:50] anti-word it is anti the spirit of of
[55:54] Christ God wants us pressing in and
[55:58] walking in all the light that he puts in
[56:01] front of us
[56:02] and the more that you humble yourself
[56:05] the closer you get to God and the more
[56:08] that it's it's not that big a thing
[56:10] well then you're not going to have that
[56:12] close walk with the Lord that he has for
[56:14] you
[56:16] you see too many Christians
[56:20] giving up on helping other Christians
[56:22] just because of their flaws
[56:27] they'd rather work with someone with
[56:29] less problems
[56:32] someone that required less of their time
[56:35] someone that listened to them a little
[56:37] bit more agreed with them a little bit
[56:39] more
[56:40] someone they actually enjoyed being with
[56:42] when they discipled
[56:45] in other words their idea of
[56:46] Christianity is flawed
[56:50] brother Branham said in the message a
[56:51] man running from the presence of the
[56:53] Lord he said Christianity is an everyday
[56:55] rugged life living for God in this
[56:57] present world
[56:58] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[57:00] love of God in the heart
[57:02] that sets you of fire and puts you out
[57:04] yonder with people making converts to
[57:07] Christ I want you to think about this
[57:09] statement if you're going to make a
[57:10] convert to somebody
[57:12] they're not converted yet
[57:14] right which means they're in their old
[57:17] nature full of problems
[57:19] and if you think all you have to do is
[57:22] just say Jesus loves you
[57:26] it's going to take more than that that
[57:28] is not a hard rugged life
[57:31] you're going to need the burning of the
[57:33] fire of God to get you out there washing
[57:36] the feet of those who are dirty
[57:39] [Music]
[57:41] see when we can see that this is how
[57:43] much Christ loves us and he don't throw
[57:45] away the clay
[57:47] why are we to have an attitude of
[57:50] somebody less than us
[57:54] because we think they're flawed too
[57:57] flawed
[58:03] I think if Christ lives in me
[58:06] he's going to love that person the way
[58:09] that he loves them when he's not living
[58:11] in me
[58:13] right don't you think we all have this
[58:15] picture on which God loves us
[58:18] but you have that same picture of of God
[58:20] loving them through you
[58:23] that's the picture that needs to be seen
[58:25] because without a vision the people
[58:27] perish you need to possess that and
[58:31] that's that ain't your knowledge by the
[58:32] way
[58:33] that's the Holy Ghost inside of you
[58:36] loving them
[58:38] because if you love them with your love
[58:40] you're just going to stop when you've
[58:41] had enough
[58:46] lots of Christians don't really accept
[58:48] their responsibility as being a
[58:50] Christian but brother Brandon says You
[58:51] must accept your responsibility it's
[58:54] what he said in that message a man
[58:55] running from the presence of the Lord
[58:58] now let's think about it if that nature
[59:01] of the Holy Ghost was in every one of us
[59:03] that nature of well that person's too
[59:05] flawed I don't want to deal with them
[59:07] they bother me none of us would be here
[59:12] today
[59:15] how do we adapt a different attitude for
[59:18] others than God has towards us
[59:22] that's why we need to Humble ourselves
[59:25] in the sight of the Lord
[59:29] too many Christians think that God loves
[59:31] them more than their fall flawed
[59:33] bystanders
[59:36] God is no respecter of persons
[59:38] what he's done for you he'll do for
[59:41] others
[59:42] we sang the song what God has done for
[59:44] others he'll do for you but I'm telling
[59:46] you what God has done for you he'll do
[59:48] for others
[59:50] he cares the question is do we care
[59:53] too many Believers Never learned what it
[59:57] means to live for others
[1:00:00] they've
[1:00:01] they've interpreted carnally
[1:00:05] instead of truly living for others
[1:00:08] too selfish they're too busy
[1:00:11] too much in love with themselves to
[1:00:13] really give up their lives for others
[1:00:16] now these disciples
[1:00:18] had witnessed this nature of God
[1:00:23] in Jesus Christ this word that was in
[1:00:26] the beginning became flesh and they were
[1:00:28] witnessing this nature not just in
[1:00:31] creation now but in regeneration
[1:00:35] this great love that he had amen it
[1:00:39] wasn't only the the glory of his
[1:00:41] creative power but it was the power of
[1:00:44] regeneration
[1:00:45] they didn't only witness God's nature
[1:00:48] being expressed in truth and
[1:00:50] righteousness but it was being expressed
[1:00:52] in Grace in Mercy in love in in in in
[1:00:57] the aspect that you don't need that to
[1:01:01] create something you only need that to
[1:01:03] restore something
[1:01:05] amen for God so loved the world that he
[1:01:08] gave his only begotten son and we behold
[1:01:11] his glory the glory of the only begotten
[1:01:14] the father full of grace
[1:01:15] was first
[1:01:17] then truth
[1:01:19] Grace was first then truth
[1:01:22] let your conversation always be with
[1:01:26] Grace
[1:01:28] so often we just want to true true truth
[1:01:33] but I tell you the devil he'll speak
[1:01:35] truth right
[1:01:37] he'll speak enough truth to condemn you
[1:01:41] he'll he'll he'll give you enough truth
[1:01:43] to make you feel you ain't worth a thing
[1:01:48] that you're not in the father's hand
[1:01:50] that you're you're not saved this thing
[1:01:52] isn't real in your life
[1:01:54] yeah
[1:01:55] he'll give you enough truth
[1:01:58] to unite with your feelings and before
[1:02:00] you know it
[1:02:04] no Grace
[1:02:07] if you're speaking without Grace take a
[1:02:10] step back
[1:02:11] Jesus Christ was full of grace and truth
[1:02:17] eternal life came down and was
[1:02:18] manifested in the realm of this
[1:02:21] temporary life
[1:02:23] it was manifested with flesh and blood
[1:02:26] this eternal God that was invisible now
[1:02:29] became visible
[1:02:31] and they were they were beholding
[1:02:35] and they were handling they were
[1:02:36] touching
[1:02:38] they were coming in Fellowship
[1:02:40] with it
[1:02:42] are you with me amen and when eternal
[1:02:45] life comes in to live in a body of Flesh
[1:02:47] it will change its worldly nature
[1:02:52] it will not stay it will not allow the
[1:02:56] old nature to stay there
[1:02:58] now I'm not saying you know the the
[1:03:01] he would pour out his Spirit upon All
[1:03:03] Flesh that's true and he will come and
[1:03:06] His blessings will fall into Justice and
[1:03:08] unjust but when the Holy sorry confesses
[1:03:10] I've got the Holy Ghost and God is
[1:03:12] living in me you can automatically
[1:03:14] expect that your nature is going to be
[1:03:18] changing
[1:03:21] because God won't allow it to stay that
[1:03:23] way
[1:03:24] and it will keep happening until you're
[1:03:27] out of here
[1:03:29] I mean God is on a one-track mind
[1:03:33] He Wants You In His Image that's the
[1:03:36] track he's on
[1:03:38] all right let's just take a look at
[1:03:39] these scriptures and I know they're not
[1:03:40] maybe for for for for all of us here but
[1:03:43] I I just for those that it might be I
[1:03:46] want to read them Ezekiel 36 verse 26 a
[1:03:49] new heart also will I give you
[1:03:52] and a new spirit well I put within you
[1:03:56] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[1:03:58] of your flesh and I will give you a
[1:04:01] heart of Flesh
[1:04:03] you know what it's like when you're
[1:04:04] talking to somebody and they're just
[1:04:07] hard at you
[1:04:08] or sometimes you know you've been hard
[1:04:10] at somebody you just can't control it
[1:04:13] well God promised to take that out and
[1:04:15] give us a heart of Flesh
[1:04:17] he says and I will put my spirit within
[1:04:19] you
[1:04:20] and I will cause you
[1:04:23] and I will let you do your own thing
[1:04:27] no but I will cause you to walk in my
[1:04:30] statutes and ye shall keep my judgments
[1:04:34] and do them
[1:04:36] that's what's going to happen when you
[1:04:38] say I got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:42] Hebrews 8 10 for this is the Covenant
[1:04:44] that I will make with the house of
[1:04:46] Israel after those days saith the Lord I
[1:04:48] will put my laws into their minds and
[1:04:50] write them into their hearts and I will
[1:04:52] be to them a God and they shall be to me
[1:04:57] a people
[1:04:58] you talk about sweet Fellowship
[1:05:01] and they shall not teach every man his
[1:05:04] neighbor
[1:05:05] and every man his brother saying know
[1:05:08] the Lord know the Lord For All Shall
[1:05:10] know me
[1:05:11] from the least
[1:05:12] to the greatest now this is where God is
[1:05:15] heading
[1:05:17] this is where God is heading all right
[1:05:19] first John chapter 2 verse 27 but the
[1:05:23] anointing
[1:05:24] which you have received of him
[1:05:27] abideth in you
[1:05:29] and ye need not that any man teach you
[1:05:35] but as the same anointing teaches you
[1:05:37] all things and is truth and is no lie
[1:05:41] and even as it have taught you ye shall
[1:05:45] abide in him
[1:05:48] now John's coming out and saying
[1:05:51] the Eternal Word of God is now living in
[1:05:54] you
[1:05:55] it is very capable of unveiling what you
[1:06:00] should be doing the way you should be
[1:06:02] living the things that you should be
[1:06:04] doing you do not need to be told by any
[1:06:06] man
[1:06:10] but why do we have to be told by a man
[1:06:16] because we're focusing on the part of
[1:06:18] eternal life that gets us to heaven and
[1:06:20] we're not very interested on the part
[1:06:22] that if we love them we'll keep the
[1:06:23] Commandments
[1:06:26] you know why did Jesus say hey if you
[1:06:28] love me keep my commands he didn't say
[1:06:29] hey
[1:06:31] why'd I say that
[1:06:34] but you know he
[1:06:36] why do you say Peter you love me Peter
[1:06:38] you love me Peter you love me
[1:06:43] Peter thought he loved God so much that
[1:06:45] he would die for him kill form
[1:06:49] and when Jesus said that's not how you
[1:06:51] express it
[1:06:53] he didn't know what to do with himself
[1:06:55] hey basically
[1:06:58] what crazy in his mind
[1:07:01] started denying them
[1:07:04] to a great degree
[1:07:07] so I'm telling you the holy ghost that
[1:07:10] is here among us we should be in
[1:07:13] connection with the Holy Ghost because
[1:07:14] he's the one that's trying to speak to
[1:07:16] you he's the one that's trying to teach
[1:07:18] you there may be a man up here behind
[1:07:20] the pulpit but we've got to believe the
[1:07:22] Holy Ghost is trying to speak to us
[1:07:25] that's right
[1:07:27] and if you can if you can get connected
[1:07:30] to that Spirit there get your eyes off
[1:07:32] the flesh let the Holy Ghost
[1:07:35] s teach you
[1:07:37] all right John 16 13 says how be it when
[1:07:40] he the spirit of Truth come he will
[1:07:42] guide you into all Truth for he shall
[1:07:44] not speak of himself but whatsoever ye
[1:07:47] shall hear he shall speak in that he
[1:07:49] will show you things to come so here it
[1:07:51] is Jesus himself says when the spirit of
[1:07:54] truths come he's going to guide you
[1:07:57] so uh how many times you've been in
[1:08:00] situations I don't know what to do
[1:08:02] I don't know how to handle this
[1:08:05] I don't know what to do with this
[1:08:06] situation
[1:08:07] I don't know what to say
[1:08:12] what is needing
[1:08:14] is the Holy Ghost nothing else because
[1:08:19] we have a promise
[1:08:21] that he will lead and guide us into all
[1:08:24] truth
[1:08:25] not just the doctrine of the Bible
[1:08:32] if we spent more time seeking the Holy
[1:08:35] Ghost
[1:08:37] give God a chance to be a teacher in
[1:08:39] your life
[1:08:40] amen give God a chance to come in and
[1:08:42] show himself how great a God he is to
[1:08:45] you personally
[1:08:49] we allow the devil to convince us that
[1:08:51] as long as we learn from the man that I
[1:08:53] just say it like this I I question that
[1:08:55] our nature is ever going to get changed
[1:08:58] God's not going to share his glory with
[1:09:00] no no man
[1:09:01] but if we believe what is being spoken
[1:09:04] is the Holy Ghost personally to us then
[1:09:07] we can expect that change to take place
[1:09:09] in our life
[1:09:11] the key is becoming more serious about
[1:09:14] fellowshipping with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:17] fellowshipping with the Holy Ghost now
[1:09:19] Everyone likes Fellowship
[1:09:21] right we all want Fellowship
[1:09:24] I'll tell you God loves Fellowship too
[1:09:27] that's right and he's jealous when he
[1:09:29] doesn't get it
[1:09:30] too often our fellowship with one
[1:09:32] another is missing the most
[1:09:35] important ingredient
[1:09:38] foreign
[1:09:45] and specifically
[1:09:47] how we can become more like him
[1:09:50] that is the most important ingredient to
[1:09:54] Fellowship
[1:09:56] how to walk closer to Jesus how to get
[1:09:59] more ready to meet him because
[1:10:01] ultimately that day is coming
[1:10:06] and I know Satan wants to tell us
[1:10:09] you know hey we're all going we're
[1:10:10] predestinated I understand that
[1:10:14] but why would Jesus be saying
[1:10:17] many will come to me in that day
[1:10:20] or be ready I'm coming in an hour you
[1:10:23] think not why was he saying those things
[1:10:26] because there's another side to that
[1:10:28] thinking
[1:10:30] why did Paul have to press towards the
[1:10:33] Mark if he already was on the bullseye
[1:10:38] so
[1:10:41] if I listen to the prophet and I hear
[1:10:44] him talking about turning over every
[1:10:45] stone and be sure and make sure and stay
[1:10:47] there and
[1:10:49] I I think he they're sending a message
[1:10:52] you know Jesus said before he left I'm
[1:10:54] coming soon well that was a long time
[1:10:56] ago did he miss
[1:10:58] represent
[1:11:00] no
[1:11:01] we need to live our life I don't care
[1:11:03] what church age we're in we need to live
[1:11:05] our life
[1:11:07] like he's coming soon because we only
[1:11:09] got so many hours and so many days to
[1:11:11] get ready and we don't even know what
[1:11:12] they are
[1:11:14] but and Satan wants to tell us that we
[1:11:16] we've got forever and if you talk to
[1:11:18] anybody who's under their Deathbed or or
[1:11:21] somebody that something happened if I
[1:11:24] would have known this I would have taken
[1:11:25] care of my body I would have I would
[1:11:27] have done this I would have done that
[1:11:29] right if they knew
[1:11:31] well I'm telling you we know Jesus is
[1:11:33] coming soon we need to we need to put
[1:11:36] that most important ingredient into our
[1:11:39] fellowship
[1:11:41] it needs to become more serious with
[1:11:43] some of us amen
[1:11:45] foreign
[1:11:46] John and these disciples were
[1:11:48] fellowshipping with the most important
[1:11:50] ingredient here in first John chapter 1
[1:11:53] verse 3 that which you have seen and
[1:11:55] heard declare we unto you that ye Also
[1:11:58] may have fellowship with us
[1:12:02] and truly our fellowship is with the
[1:12:05] father
[1:12:06] and with the son Jesus Christ
[1:12:09] and these things right we unto you that
[1:12:11] your joy may be full
[1:12:14] Joy doesn't come just because we want it
[1:12:16] right
[1:12:17] there's a price you have to pay for joy
[1:12:20] the Bible talks about weeping may last
[1:12:24] during the night
[1:12:26] right we may have to just stay with God
[1:12:29] in his and call upon him and plead but
[1:12:32] we have a promise that Joy comes in the
[1:12:34] morning
[1:12:36] John 15 verse 10 if you keep my
[1:12:39] Commandments ye shall abide in my love
[1:12:42] even as I've kept my father's
[1:12:43] Commandments and abide in his love these
[1:12:45] things I have spoken unto you this this
[1:12:48] these things of keeping Commandments
[1:12:51] this important thing of of keeping the
[1:12:53] cycle of of Commandments going these
[1:12:56] things I've spoken unto you that my joy
[1:12:59] might remain with you
[1:13:03] and that your joy might be full
[1:13:08] we see God's heart that he wants us to
[1:13:10] have joy and he wants it to be full but
[1:13:12] he's not going to give it if we're not
[1:13:16] going to keep his Commandments and walk
[1:13:18] in the light as he speaks to us it just
[1:13:21] it's just scripture
[1:13:23] now this is my commandment that ye love
[1:13:25] one another
[1:13:26] as I loved you so now he's going back to
[1:13:28] the Commandment this is what he wants us
[1:13:30] to keep I want you to love one another
[1:13:32] exactly the same way I've loved you in
[1:13:35] other words don't think that somebody's
[1:13:38] got too much flaws to spend time helping
[1:13:42] when you think all you got to do is get
[1:13:44] on your knees no matter what and say God
[1:13:46] forgive me my sins I need you
[1:13:49] but you won't take time to go help
[1:13:51] somebody
[1:13:53] then we wonder why we don't have the joy
[1:13:55] of the Lord
[1:13:57] Greater Love have no man than this than
[1:13:59] a man lay down his life for his friends
[1:14:02] now tell me do you got that love
[1:14:06] do you
[1:14:08] amen it's a decision that you make with
[1:14:12] your time
[1:14:17] you give your life what is your life
[1:14:19] well we know it's a vapor might as well
[1:14:22] give it
[1:14:25] give
[1:14:27] for others
[1:14:28] live for others what does that mean
[1:14:31] brother John get into the tapes with not
[1:14:33] just to listen to the tapes you can
[1:14:35] listen those tapes all day all the time
[1:14:38] and never ever
[1:14:40] come
[1:14:41] to eternal life
[1:14:44] now the thing is you when you put that
[1:14:46] tape on you've got to have a desire Lord
[1:14:48] show me how to live for others
[1:14:50] show me how to live for others show me
[1:14:53] how to love others exactly the way you
[1:14:55] love them show me because that's what
[1:14:58] those tapes are for
[1:15:00] those tapes are to get us ready for a
[1:15:02] rapture
[1:15:03] and nothing but perfect love is going in
[1:15:06] there
[1:15:08] Jesus is stressing to us to receive and
[1:15:12] to walk in all of the nature of God that
[1:15:16] he shows us
[1:15:18] that's what he's he's getting across
[1:15:21] here Greater Love have no man than this
[1:15:23] then a man lay down his life this is the
[1:15:25] nature of God he gave his son for us and
[1:15:28] he's stressing to us I want you to do
[1:15:32] that same thing for others
[1:15:34] I say our attention needs to be put
[1:15:37] towards that it's important to God it's
[1:15:40] got to be important to us
[1:15:42] and this this really happens in so
[1:15:45] simply it happens by us walking in the
[1:15:50] light that he shows us yes
[1:15:54] whatever God speaks to you just do it
[1:15:58] just do it
[1:16:01] don't think about it don't put it off to
[1:16:04] another time don't say I'm going to let
[1:16:07] God deal with me for who just get
[1:16:10] serious about doing it
[1:16:14] God wants our joy to be full do you
[1:16:16] believe that Psalm 16 verse 11 thou will
[1:16:20] show me the path of life
[1:16:23] in thy presence is fullness of joy at
[1:16:27] thy right hand there are Pleasures
[1:16:29] forever more
[1:16:32] well he's showing us the path of life
[1:16:34] here
[1:16:35] he's showing us how to get joy
[1:16:38] it's about walking in the light amen
[1:16:43] first John chapter 1 verse 5 or opening
[1:16:45] scripture
[1:16:46] this then is the message which we have
[1:16:49] heard and declare unto you that God is
[1:16:52] light
[1:16:53] and in him is no Darkness at all this is
[1:16:57] so hard for us to comprehend
[1:17:01] here's a God who knows everything yes
[1:17:06] sees all the evil knows all the evil but
[1:17:11] doesn't look on it doesn't think about
[1:17:12] it
[1:17:13] doesn't get enticed by it
[1:17:18] there's just no darkness in his thinking
[1:17:20] he thinks no ill of his neighbors he
[1:17:23] takes no pleasure in the death of the
[1:17:24] wicked
[1:17:25] a God that's only light
[1:17:29] there's just no darkness in him isn't a
[1:17:31] beautiful scripture
[1:17:33] amen Jesus is the light of the world
[1:17:35] pilate said I find no fault in them
[1:17:38] when John saw the city in Revelations 21
[1:17:41] he said the city had no need of the sun
[1:17:45] neither the moon to shine in it for the
[1:17:47] glory of God did lighten it and the lamb
[1:17:50] is the light thereof
[1:17:53] he is uh his spirit is our light
[1:18:00] this disciple John who now had received
[1:18:04] eternal life was declaring this message
[1:18:06] unto us the reader that God is lighting
[1:18:10] him there's no Darkness at all
[1:18:13] and I hope you can say Amen to the
[1:18:15] scripture
[1:18:16] the nature of God is not to allow any
[1:18:20] Darkness to be in his life
[1:18:25] he won't allow it he won't pacify it he
[1:18:28] won't make excuses for it God is light
[1:18:31] and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:18:37] and if we say that we have fellowship
[1:18:38] with him
[1:18:40] and we walk
[1:18:44] in not all the light that has been shown
[1:18:46] to us
[1:18:49] we're actually
[1:18:53] we're not in the truth
[1:18:55] they that worship me must worship me in
[1:18:57] spirit and in truth
[1:19:01] well that could be a little bit
[1:19:03] different
[1:19:04] say for all of us in the aspect of
[1:19:09] God may have shown you a lot more truth
[1:19:12] than he's shown me
[1:19:14] but what he has shown you
[1:19:16] you need to walk in it
[1:19:19] and that makes your worship
[1:19:22] as great as it can be
[1:19:25] but if you're if I'm not walking in all
[1:19:27] the truth that God has shown me I
[1:19:29] honestly can't be worshiping him in the
[1:19:31] truth
[1:19:32] I don't care if I'm in the message or
[1:19:34] not
[1:19:34] I don't care what I Proclaim I've got to
[1:19:37] walk in the light of the word
[1:19:43] and we want to have a a revelation of
[1:19:46] this scripture
[1:19:47] no none of us here without things in our
[1:19:50] lives that we don't want out
[1:19:52] we're all here we all have things in our
[1:19:54] life that we wish were there we don't
[1:19:57] want them there we've tried to get rid
[1:19:58] of them
[1:20:01] yet we claim that we have fellowship
[1:20:03] with them all the time
[1:20:05] I want us to pay attention to the things
[1:20:08] that are in our life that we haven't put
[1:20:11] much heart into getting rid of
[1:20:15] those are the things I want to talk
[1:20:16] about
[1:20:18] got awful quiet
[1:20:19] do you remember God's still here
[1:20:21] still his message
[1:20:24] the message from eternity is that if
[1:20:27] we're confessing that we have fellowship
[1:20:29] with God while allowing some Darkness to
[1:20:32] remain in our life
[1:20:33] that Fellowship is not really what we
[1:20:36] think it is
[1:20:40] because we will always Proclaim
[1:20:44] push comes to shove you will fight
[1:20:47] for what you believe in
[1:20:51] but the truth of the matter is
[1:20:54] if we're not walking in the things that
[1:20:56] God has spoken to us
[1:20:58] we don't have quite the fellowship that
[1:21:01] we think we have
[1:21:03] in him is no Darkness at all God don't
[1:21:06] allow darkness in his life
[1:21:10] if you're fellowshipping with God today
[1:21:12] he's going to be fellowshipping with you
[1:21:15] about getting the darkness out of your
[1:21:19] life
[1:21:21] why because in him there's no darkness
[1:21:24] and if you're as bright you don't want
[1:21:25] darkness in you amen amen so he's going
[1:21:27] to be fellowshipping with you about the
[1:21:30] things that he wants out of your life
[1:21:33] now it's easy for you to say well
[1:21:36] brother John you have this problem and I
[1:21:40] understand that I do
[1:21:42] but we all should be saying it's not my
[1:21:45] brother not my sister oh Lord but it's
[1:21:47] me that's standing in the need of prayer
[1:21:49] we need to come to church with only
[1:21:52] rakes
[1:21:53] no pitchforks no shovels no dump trucks
[1:21:58] no bulldozers but a rake
[1:22:02] it in
[1:22:09] I don't want to walk in darkness
[1:22:13] darkness is nothing but the Devil in
[1:22:17] Disguise
[1:22:20] we need to stop making excuses
[1:22:23] for allowing darkness in our life
[1:22:27] for allowing the things in her life that
[1:22:30] are there we've just we've we learn to
[1:22:32] tolerate them
[1:22:36] there's things that are still hanging
[1:22:38] around the things that we baby or cuddle
[1:22:40] or pacify
[1:22:43] maybe some dirty habit
[1:22:46] or maybe some lukewarmness
[1:22:49] maybe just not wanting to give more of
[1:22:52] our time to get serious with God I don't
[1:22:54] know what it might be for us
[1:22:56] individually
[1:22:59] but it's important that you know
[1:23:02] and that you learn to get that Darkness
[1:23:05] out
[1:23:07] because God's trying to get us to the
[1:23:08] next place
[1:23:11] and he wants his fellowship with his
[1:23:13] bride to be sweet
[1:23:15] just lovely beautiful
[1:23:19] but if that darkness is there
[1:23:21] and you're not dealing with it but the
[1:23:24] Holy Ghost is just you see that war
[1:23:25] that's going on
[1:23:27] that's why we need to Humble ourselves
[1:23:29] in the sight of the Lord
[1:23:31] to get serious about those things
[1:23:33] because God has to work through few more
[1:23:36] agency there's a part of us honestly
[1:23:39] that don't mind having darkness in our
[1:23:41] life
[1:23:43] it's enjoyable
[1:23:45] it's pleasurous if it wasn't we wouldn't
[1:23:48] be doing it
[1:23:51] right so we have to be the one that say
[1:23:53] I'm done with this
[1:23:55] I wanted you I want to be closer to God
[1:23:58] than I've ever been in my life
[1:24:00] I want to be closer to God than I've
[1:24:02] ever been in my life
[1:24:06] and I want to remain there in order to
[1:24:08] do that I got to walk in the light as he
[1:24:10] is in the light and then I can have that
[1:24:13] True Fellowship with him
[1:24:19] darkness is nothing but the Devil in
[1:24:22] Disguise
[1:24:25] God hates Darkness
[1:24:27] there's no darkness in heaven that's why
[1:24:29] Jesus taught us to pray thy will be done
[1:24:33] on Earth
[1:24:35] as it is in heaven
[1:24:38] there's no darkness in there
[1:24:40] he doesn't allow it he kicked it out
[1:24:43] we got to kick it out
[1:24:45] when he made creation he separated the
[1:24:47] dark and the light separated it
[1:24:51] we got to separate it we're separators
[1:24:55] God has entrusted you
[1:24:58] to take care of your vessel
[1:25:03] I might be honest with you you don't
[1:25:06] need me
[1:25:07] and I don't need you
[1:25:10] we don't need one another
[1:25:12] to be blurt now what we think we the
[1:25:15] others should be getting rid of
[1:25:19] but we got the Holy Ghost
[1:25:21] I got confidence that God speaks to our
[1:25:24] heart
[1:25:26] that there is a realness that happens
[1:25:29] but there's also a realness of
[1:25:33] pushing back I don't need to go to the
[1:25:35] altar I don't need to get serious I
[1:25:36] don't need to
[1:25:39] why because men love Darkness rather
[1:25:43] than light
[1:25:44] that old nature that we were born with
[1:25:46] loved Darkness
[1:25:48] why because it did its own thing you can
[1:25:51] do your own thing when nobody knows
[1:25:53] about it
[1:25:54] right when nobody's watching you can
[1:25:57] look at whatever you want to look at God
[1:25:58] bless sister Johnson you can look
[1:26:00] whatever you want to look at at the
[1:26:02] internet
[1:26:03] right
[1:26:06] you can go to somebody shake their hand
[1:26:08] say God bless you turn around and have
[1:26:10] the worst thought about that person
[1:26:13] because nobody knows see Darkness
[1:26:18] is just a disguise
[1:26:21] where the dirty work can be done
[1:26:25] I hope you love the word
[1:26:30] problem with our old nature it just
[1:26:32] tolerates Darkness it tolerates it
[1:26:35] unless it's bothering me
[1:26:40] like if
[1:26:42] brother Mark don't put the tools away
[1:26:44] when he's done using them oh man that
[1:26:47] bothers me I'm gonna tell him he better
[1:26:49] do his job
[1:26:52] but it's okay for me to leave the twos
[1:26:54] out
[1:26:55] you understand how that works
[1:26:58] it's just an ugly nature
[1:27:01] John chapter 1 verse 4 in him was life
[1:27:04] John chapter 1 verse 4 in him was life
[1:27:07] and the life was the light of men and
[1:27:10] that light shineth in darkness and
[1:27:13] darkness comprehended it not now I want
[1:27:16] to go to Saint John 3 16 what we say the
[1:27:19] most
[1:27:20] probably preach scripture in the Bible
[1:27:23] and I want to look at this in a
[1:27:25] different way in the way that we've been
[1:27:28] ministering today God sent his son to
[1:27:31] save the world John 3 16 for God so
[1:27:33] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:27:35] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:27:39] him
[1:27:40] they should not perish
[1:27:42] but have everlasting life
[1:27:47] but the world has to believe
[1:27:50] like the scriptures teach us to believe
[1:27:52] right because the Devils believe
[1:27:55] and they tremble
[1:27:57] so they don't got eternal life so the
[1:27:59] belief that we need to believe is a
[1:28:01] belief of Walking In The Light being
[1:28:03] obedient to the word of God Amen the
[1:28:06] devils are not going to walk in the
[1:28:08] light they hate the light
[1:28:10] they know they know the light they know
[1:28:13] the truth they'll speak the truth
[1:28:15] but they won't walk it
[1:28:18] so
[1:28:20] the way that we receive eternal life
[1:28:24] is we love the light
[1:28:27] we walk in the light that's why we
[1:28:29] repent we get baptized we agree with the
[1:28:31] scriptures my life was wrong I repent
[1:28:35] but it don't stop there Satan wants it
[1:28:37] to stop there
[1:28:41] but the bride is going under perfection
[1:28:45] all right verse 17 for God sent not his
[1:28:48] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:28:51] but that the world through him might be
[1:28:53] saved through him notice through him and
[1:28:56] he that believeth on him is not
[1:28:58] condemned
[1:29:01] he that believeth on him is not
[1:29:02] condemned if you truly believe Lord I'm
[1:29:05] trying to do everything I can
[1:29:07] but he that believeth not
[1:29:09] I don't need to do that
[1:29:12] is condemned already
[1:29:14] because he have not believed in the name
[1:29:16] of the only begotten Son of God and this
[1:29:19] is the condemnation that light is coming
[1:29:22] to the world
[1:29:23] and Men love Darkness rather than light
[1:29:28] because their deeds were evil
[1:29:33] they were born with this nature of just
[1:29:36] doing what they want to do and that's
[1:29:38] why we must be born again that's why we
[1:29:40] must
[1:29:41] get serious about getting more of the
[1:29:44] Holy Ghost some of us just need to get
[1:29:45] the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you those
[1:29:48] of you that got the Holy Ghost every one
[1:29:50] of you that got the Holy Ghost say I
[1:29:52] praise God for that would you pray for
[1:29:54] me that I get more Holy Ghost I know I
[1:29:57] need it it's just there
[1:30:00] and I don't want to ever make it sound
[1:30:02] like you know you need more than what
[1:30:04] you got that is not my my Ministry to
[1:30:07] you but I do believe
[1:30:10] that I need more
[1:30:13] and I want to be like Paul I want to
[1:30:16] press towards that Mark
[1:30:18] I'm not satisfied
[1:30:21] until awaken his likeness and in His
[1:30:23] image
[1:30:30] verse 20. for everyone that doeth evil
[1:30:34] hateth light
[1:30:38] see you go to do something bad you don't
[1:30:40] want nobody to know about what do you do
[1:30:42] don't tell anybody keep it covered don't
[1:30:44] say right is this this is just natural
[1:30:57] right okay neither cometh to the light
[1:31:00] lest his deed should be reproofed so
[1:31:03] I'll say this I know that when I Repent
[1:31:06] of something
[1:31:07] that I'm like I'm this thing's over I
[1:31:10] want it on my life even if I fall seven
[1:31:12] times and seven times I get back up when
[1:31:14] I've made a decision I'm truly repenting
[1:31:16] this I feel free of that thing
[1:31:20] but when I just know that it's not
[1:31:24] really I'm not to that spot of humbling
[1:31:27] myself before the Lord and I allow that
[1:31:30] thing in my life
[1:31:32] well I'm not coming to the light I'm not
[1:31:35] walking in that light
[1:31:38] and so therefore there's a separation
[1:31:40] between me and God
[1:31:43] John 15 talks about that abiding in the
[1:31:46] vine but that that Fellowship is not as
[1:31:49] sweet as God and wants it to be he if
[1:31:53] we're having fellowship with God he's
[1:31:55] working on taking care of the darkness
[1:31:57] out of our life
[1:31:58] amen that's where he's at now we got to
[1:32:00] be there with him
[1:32:02] amen the true light came to the
[1:32:04] disciples Amen Let me just uh read verse
[1:32:07] 21 but he that do a truth cometh to the
[1:32:09] light that his deeds may be manifest
[1:32:11] that they are wrought in God
[1:32:16] thank you
[1:32:17] so this light came to the disciples and
[1:32:20] the disciples came to us with the same
[1:32:22] light that we've got to walk in all
[1:32:26] all the light
[1:32:27] we can't be satisfied with having these
[1:32:30] things in our life and I'll say to you
[1:32:32] as Isaiah said in chapter 53 who have
[1:32:36] believed our report
[1:32:39] and to whom is this truth revealed to
[1:32:43] this word that we're hearing today
[1:32:45] honestly for our spiritual walk ought to
[1:32:48] make us the most excited
[1:32:51] this is the avenue to getting the
[1:32:54] closest that we've ever been to God
[1:32:58] this is it there is no other way this is
[1:33:01] the straight and narrow path as it were
[1:33:04] this is the message that we've heard
[1:33:06] from the beginning in declare unto you
[1:33:10] that God is light and him is no Darkness
[1:33:12] off we say that we have fellowship with
[1:33:15] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:33:17] not the truth God's light demands us to
[1:33:21] walk
[1:33:22] in it
[1:33:24] that's what the light demands
[1:33:26] and we've got to say God what you're
[1:33:29] saying that's my the final amen that's
[1:33:32] what I'm going with I'm not going to sit
[1:33:33] here and think about it how many times
[1:33:35] we've come to church we heard the truth
[1:33:37] and we just like
[1:33:38] Okay so
[1:33:41] I mean we're saying we have fellowship
[1:33:43] with the Lord but if we walk in the
[1:33:46] light
[1:33:47] I love this scripture as he is in the
[1:33:50] light
[1:33:51] we have Fellowship one with another amen
[1:33:55] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:33:58] cleanses us from all
[1:34:01] sin
[1:34:05] the requirement for the blood to cleanse
[1:34:07] us from all sin is obedience to all the
[1:34:11] light that we know
[1:34:15] that's why when you came to Jesus when I
[1:34:17] came to Jesus
[1:34:19] and I had drinking smoking behind me I
[1:34:22] had long hair I had everything that you
[1:34:25] can imagine hanging on me
[1:34:30] there just wasn't no good in me because
[1:34:32] it was just an ugly nature
[1:34:35] but when I repented
[1:34:38] and I said God I want you in my life I
[1:34:41] want to give up my life I Surrender it
[1:34:44] to you I want to receive you as my
[1:34:46] personal savior
[1:34:49] I got baptized with long hair
[1:34:54] I came up to the altar with long hair
[1:34:58] I listened to tapes with long hair I had
[1:35:01] records I loved worldly music
[1:35:05] foreign
[1:35:06] and I'll tell you those of you that are
[1:35:09] discipling others you know if you give
[1:35:12] too much light to somebody at one time
[1:35:14] you'll blame them
[1:35:18] and I'm so glad
[1:35:20] that I I was under a mature Ministry
[1:35:24] that had confidence that God can speak
[1:35:26] to the hearts of men amen
[1:35:30] give God a chance
[1:35:32] give God a chance
[1:35:34] but I'll tell you as God began to deal
[1:35:36] with me I began to walk in the light
[1:35:37] yeah
[1:35:39] yeah no I'll tell you I'm not real I
[1:35:40] wish this was a little bit shorter here
[1:35:42] but I'd be honest with you I never went
[1:35:43] back to long hair
[1:35:46] I just kept walking in it but you know I
[1:35:48] had so many other things to walk in
[1:35:50] and I'll tell you when I hear that
[1:35:51] worldly music playing sometimes think
[1:35:53] yeah I remember that one that was a cool
[1:35:55] one I really like that one
[1:35:56] what are you doing
[1:35:59] you know the flash will always be
[1:36:01] attracted to the world
[1:36:03] that that old nature
[1:36:07] it's a battle
[1:36:10] the spirits in us are fighting
[1:36:13] and and we
[1:36:15] just simply got to Humble ourselves
[1:36:16] before the Lord
[1:36:19] you're finding not enough strength to
[1:36:22] battle that thing we'll spend more time
[1:36:24] praying
[1:36:25] just get away and Worship the Lord just
[1:36:28] say God I love you I want to I want the
[1:36:31] closest walk I've ever had with you amen
[1:36:33] I want to go in that direction Lord you
[1:36:36] show me how to do it because I believe
[1:36:38] you live in me speak to me help me get
[1:36:41] get on your knees and call upon God God
[1:36:45] Is So merciful right if we walk in the
[1:36:48] light as he is in the light then he
[1:36:49] cleanses us from all of our sin will we
[1:36:52] still keep making them yes will you fall
[1:36:55] will you do some of the same things over
[1:36:57] yes you will but you'll get up and
[1:37:00] you'll keep walking towards the light
[1:37:03] that's always require and he's not
[1:37:05] looking for perfection in the flesh
[1:37:07] that'll never happen but he is looking
[1:37:09] for a perfect attitude he really is
[1:37:15] I just want to read the last two
[1:37:16] scriptures and tell this short story and
[1:37:19] then we're closing
[1:37:21] verse 8 says if we say unto him we have
[1:37:23] no sin we deceive ourself and the truth
[1:37:25] is not in us if we confess your sins he
[1:37:28] is faithful and he is just
[1:37:30] to forgive us of our wrongs
[1:37:35] and to cleanse us from all
[1:37:38] unrighteousness now that is a precious
[1:37:39] promise
[1:37:42] not confessed I just did it
[1:37:46] but confess that I've allowed this thing
[1:37:48] to just Ling around
[1:37:51] and now I'm ready to get serious with
[1:37:53] God
[1:37:56] brother Brian told the story one time
[1:37:58] when he would uh end up go when he went
[1:38:02] out hunting he would end up getting deer
[1:38:04] for other
[1:38:06] other people who some I think sometimes
[1:38:09] really even needed them
[1:38:11] he's really doing a good deed it was
[1:38:14] good intentions
[1:38:16] but God gave him
[1:38:18] a word
[1:38:21] and he told them not to do that anymore
[1:38:25] and so when he went out hunting
[1:38:30] he just got what he needed
[1:38:32] for himself
[1:38:36] and uh
[1:38:37] I'm sure
[1:38:39] brother Johnson could tell the story a
[1:38:41] lot better than I could I wish I would
[1:38:43] have read it but you're going to get the
[1:38:45] gist of the story
[1:38:47] one time
[1:38:49] he was
[1:38:50] In This Storm
[1:38:53] and the snow was flying and and and and
[1:38:57] and uh I'm not sure if he got lost
[1:39:01] but
[1:39:02] uh there was a big storm and after the
[1:39:06] end of the the storm
[1:39:09] um
[1:39:10] uh
[1:39:13] God met him
[1:39:14] God met him his I believe his tears were
[1:39:18] Fallen under dry leaves and maybe he
[1:39:20] spoke to the storm I can't remember if
[1:39:22] that was the time but I do remember this
[1:39:25] that God met him
[1:39:28] and
[1:39:30] God asked him
[1:39:32] um
[1:39:35] have you
[1:39:37] um
[1:39:39] have you shot any
[1:39:41] dear for anyone
[1:39:44] he said no
[1:39:46] I I haven't I've I've kept your
[1:39:49] commandment I've done what you asked me
[1:39:50] to do he said well
[1:39:53] I've kept my commandment I'll never
[1:39:55] leave you and I'll never forsake you
[1:39:59] it was like an arrangement of Fellowship
[1:40:03] but really what caught my attention was
[1:40:06] afterwards when God spoke to Brother
[1:40:08] Brian says
[1:40:10] would you like to walk with me
[1:40:12] right would you like to walk with me
[1:40:15] brother bran said that'd be the greatest
[1:40:17] privilege I've ever had
[1:40:20] and it had to do
[1:40:22] with keeping his word
[1:40:26] keeping his word it's more important
[1:40:28] than what we think it's not maybe
[1:40:30] important to us but it's important to
[1:40:32] God and if it's important to God it must
[1:40:35] get important to us amen let's Stand
[1:40:38] Together
[1:40:42] if you want the closest walk that you've
[1:40:44] ever had put all your heart into walking
[1:40:47] in the things that God speaks to you it
[1:40:49] may be just one thing
[1:40:51] in a week one thing in the service one
[1:40:54] thing in a month one thing you listen to
[1:40:56] that tape
[1:40:57] but just try to do it with all your
[1:40:59] heart you'll see that your walk will
[1:41:02] just be getting closer to God
[1:41:04] your fellowship will be sweeter you have
[1:41:06] more joy more peace things will begin to
[1:41:10] open up
[1:41:11] and ultimately we're walking to a
[1:41:14] rapture
[1:41:15] we're walking into a rapture
[1:41:18] and and we we have a big part but I know
[1:41:21] we're waiting for God to just but we
[1:41:23] have a part to play until that happens
[1:41:25] and I believe this is this is what we
[1:41:27] need right here to see that fulfilled
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:31] amen
[1:41:34] um
[1:41:35] let's just sing Shine Jesus Shine can we
