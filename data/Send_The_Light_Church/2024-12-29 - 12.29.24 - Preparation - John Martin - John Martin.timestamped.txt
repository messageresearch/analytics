[36:27] enter in and express our our love to you
[36:30] through song and through worship and to
[36:34] to honor you Lord because you're worthy
[36:37] to be honored this morning in your house
[36:40] and God we just ask that you would now
[36:43] uh take these receive our praises and
[36:46] and may our our hearts be prepared uh to
[36:50] receive the engrafted word this morning
[36:53] Father we pray that you would remember
[36:55] those that are not with us uh for some
[36:58] reason we just ask Lord that your Holy
[37:01] Spirit would Minister uh onto each and

[37:07] would burn within their heart and draw
[37:10] them so strong to you Lord that they

[37:19] we just commit ourselves into your hands
[37:22] and just come and Minister Lord your
[37:25] love your mercies your grace to to us
[37:27] now we pray these things in Jesus
[37:29] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[37:33] let's turn to the Book of Revelations we
[37:35] just have one familiar verse we want to
[37:37] read and it's in Revelations chapter
[37:42] 19 as we look into this subject this
[37:51] morning we
[37:53] know there is going to be a rapture
[37:57] there's going to be a
[37:59] Rapture
[38:01] and uh God's word is true it cannot fail
[38:06] is sure as
[38:07] anything um but there's nothing
[38:11] guaranteed that I'm going into the
[38:14] Rapture there there's nothing guaranteed
[38:17] uh but it is guaranteed there's going to
[38:19] be a
[38:19] Rapture but the uarantee is if I'm
[38:23] going and so there's a part that we have
[38:26] to play we want to talk this morning
[38:28] about preparation and let's read verse
[38:30] seven together let us be glad and
[38:34] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[38:37] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[38:40] wife have made herself ready amen God
[38:43] bless you may be
[38:47] seated and this is the part the only
[38:50] part that really we can play is
[38:54] preparing
[38:55] ourself if I stare at the word I am
[39:00] predestinated I am going to make
[39:03] it uh then I can begin to lose focus of
[39:08] this important part of
[39:09] preparation and I think I would almost
[39:12] rather have a
[39:15] revelation on
[39:18] Preparation than I'm
[39:22] predestinated if I had to choose I would
[39:25] rather choose to have a re ation of
[39:27] pressing towards the
[39:29] mark rather than saying I'm going to be
[39:33] there because um the the devil would
[39:37] like to take as as the prophet taught us
[39:39] to take certain uh scriptures and
[39:42] certain parts of the word in the Bible
[39:44] and help us to bring such such a comfort
[39:48] that we begin to begin
[39:50] relaxed and uh when we're relaxed we
[39:53] don't feel like we need to prepare and
[39:56] so this is an important subject the word
[39:59] preparation in the actually means the
[40:02] action or process of making
[40:06] ready or being made ready for the use or
[40:11] consideration and that's what I'm saying
[40:13] we know there's going to be a Rapture
[40:15] and we want to be in a place of
[40:19] consideration we we we um because we
[40:24] know there's many going to come to him
[40:25] in that day and say Lord what what about
[40:27] us what about us I did this and this and
[40:31] this and this happened in my life and
[40:33] you know I'm known by other people and I
[40:36] can show you
[40:37] testimonies and but to to God that
[40:41] didn't make them
[40:43] prepared a and so if we're going to be
[40:46] considered by God then we we have to be
[40:50] prepared and if we're going to be
[40:52] prepared that means today uh before the
[40:55] rapture we have to put our
[40:58] our our s our heart our life our desires
[41:01] our attitude into action we have to uh
[41:05] get into the process of making ourselves
[41:07] ready in order to do that we've got to
[41:10] dismiss the thought process that I am
[41:13] ready and we also have to dismiss the
[41:15] process that all I have to do is come to
[41:18] church and that should make us ready so
[41:22] we we have to actually look beyond that
[41:25] and that's why we have the scriptures to
[41:27] help us and to provoke us uh to these
[41:31] good works amen and did you ever have to
[41:35] push someone to do
[41:39] something yeah that there should be lots
[41:41] of amens on that and if anybody's got
[41:43] children there there there there's a
[41:45] given and if anybody has ever uh had
[41:48] somebody work for you or somebody's
[41:50] underneath you in in
[41:53] management um and you're trying to or or
[41:56] sometimes you're trying to get you know
[41:59] uh um uh Cheryl would have to remind me
[42:02] you know you have these things on your
[42:06] list that need to get done you know what
[42:08] list I'm talking about right and it
[42:10] don't matter if you did you know eight
[42:12] of them there's still those last two
[42:15] that need to be done and um so it it's
[42:20] like uh when when you're trying to uh
[42:24] press or or try to get somebody to do
[42:26] something something um they already know
[42:30] what to do but they just don't want to
[42:33] take action you know what I mean it it's
[42:35] it's it's time to to take out the
[42:37] garbage it's time to do the dishes it's
[42:39] time to clean the room it's time to get
[42:41] the this job done whatever it might be
[42:44] uh and and they they already know but
[42:46] they're not taking action see this is
[42:48] what preparation is it means taking
[42:50] action uh and when you have to push
[42:52] someone to do things it's clearly proves
[42:55] that they don't have a great enough
[42:56] desire to do it that's just that
[43:03] simple one
[43:06] morning Jim heard his name called John
[43:09] Jim it's time to get up and go to
[43:12] school from Mom and Jim responded but I
[43:16] don't want to get up they don't like me
[43:19] at school I just don't want to
[43:22] go mom said you got to get up Jim you're
[43:24] the superintendent
[43:28] you're the high ranking officer you got
[43:30] to get there you're in charge of the
[43:33] district so when you have to keep
[43:35] pushing someone to do something it's
[43:37] clear
[43:38] indication that they really don't want
[43:40] to do
[43:42] it now the Bride of Jesus Christ will
[43:46] never be able to make herself ready if
[43:49] she has to be pushed that's the first
[43:52] thing I want to
[43:54] say the bride don't have to be pushed
[43:57] she don't have to be forced she don't
[43:58] have to be babied she don't have to have
[43:59] a carrot dangling in front of her all
[44:01] the time she's not a hot peppered hot
[44:05] peppered hot baby plant however that
[44:09] goes the nature of the Bride will have a
[44:12] love inside of her heart to want to be
[44:18] ready because she has counted the cost
[44:21] to make herself ready she will pay the
[44:24] price daily to do God's will will she
[44:28] will pick up her cross and I'll say it
[44:31] like this the sufferings of God's will
[44:33] for her life because that's really what
[44:34] the cross
[44:36] is it's it it if if you're not suffering
[44:40] you're probably not doing the will of
[44:43] God because our flesh is still
[44:46] flesh and it still don't want to do
[44:49] God's will it it just doesn't and so
[44:52] there there's that battle there but I
[44:54] believe that she will dress her
[44:56] character in the word of God and that
[44:59] takes that's what it takes to get ready
[45:02] it's to become the word of God other
[45:05] brandom said it's like this he says it's
[45:07] easy to know where you're going he says
[45:10] just look at what you're being drawn
[45:14] to look at where your desire is pulling
[45:17] you towards amen how often have you
[45:21] thought about going out to
[45:25] eat I mean this is how happened a number
[45:27] of times in the car after church we're
[45:30] sitting in the car and we say to one
[45:33] another where would you like to go out
[45:35] to eat I don't know where would you like
[45:37] to go but what do you feel like
[45:40] eating what what hunger do you have I
[45:43] mean if you had Mexican food the last
[45:45] three nights you're probably not going
[45:48] to say yeah I feel like you know Mexican
[45:51] food so whatever you're hungering for is
[45:55] probably the direction you're going to
[45:56] go
[45:58] amen and if you're hungering to to be
[46:02] ready to be God's bride then you're
[46:05] going to be drawn into the word into the
[46:09] message into addressing your
[46:12] life but if that draw isn't there and
[46:15] you're you're constantly being drawn
[46:18] into the things of this world or the
[46:20] things that you just want to do for your
[46:22] life then that's the direction you're
[46:24] heading and that's not a good direction
[46:27] and that's why we have the the the Bible
[46:30] to help us to warn Us in things if
[46:33] there's a deep calling inside your heart
[46:35] be assured there's a deep to respond
[46:38] amen David said in Psalms 42:1 as the
[46:42] heart panth after the water Brook so
[46:44] panth my soul after thee Oh God my soul
[46:49] thirsteth for God for the Living God
[46:53] When shall I come and appear before God
[46:55] my tears have have been my meat day and
[46:58] night they continually say unto me where
[47:01] is thy
[47:04] God so he's talking about a deep calling
[47:08] inside of him for God Amen there must be
[47:12] a God to respond if there's a desire
[47:14] inside you remember the story about the
[47:17] brother R talking about the boy who had
[47:18] the the a need for sulfur inside of him
[47:21] and he just he couldn't get it with a
[47:23] chocolate bar an apple he needed he
[47:26] needed something with sulfur in it he
[47:28] could he found it in an eraser am and
[47:31] when he got it it satisfied him because
[47:33] there was a deep calling there inside
[47:36] and God has put something inside of each
[47:38] of us to drive us to the place where God
[47:41] is already at amen
[47:46] amen I want you to catch that just like
[47:50] a need for sulfur just like a need a
[47:54] craving to to go eat if you haven't eat
[47:56] eaten in a while and you're hungry God
[47:59] put that hunger there inside of you in
[48:01] your in your stomach so you eat because
[48:03] if you don't eat then you're going to
[48:05] your immune system is going to get weak
[48:06] you're going to get sick so this is just
[48:08] the way he made us and in the bride
[48:11] there is that desire already Amen to
[48:15] make yourself ready it's there and of
[48:17] course you have to cultivate it you do
[48:20] you you have to get in his presence you
[48:22] have to worship him you have to to to to
[48:26] to to uh reciprocate the love back to
[48:30] God that He Loves Us with and that makes
[48:33] it
[48:33] grow here in in 1 Corinthians 2:9 the
[48:37] Bible says but as it is written I have
[48:40] not seen nor ear heard neither have it
[48:43] entered into the heart of man the things
[48:45] which God have what prepared for them
[48:49] that love
[48:53] himen so we're talking about one group
[48:55] of people here only the group that loves
[48:58] God they're not talking about anybody
[49:02] else we're not talking about the group
[49:04] that half loves
[49:06] them we're not talking about the group
[49:08] that do you know does many wonderful
[49:10] works or prophesies or any of that we're
[49:13] talking about a group that loves
[49:15] them so this is an internal thing it's
[49:18] real easy to look who that is it's
[49:21] really easy to look who that is just see
[49:23] where you're being drawn to where
[49:24] where's where's your love at today
[49:27] so to those who are preparing themselves
[49:30] if I could say it like this if you love
[49:32] God you're preparing
[49:33] yourself does that simple so it's this
[49:36] group who is preparing him their self
[49:38] that God has already got something
[49:40] prepared for them
[49:42] amen but God have revealed them unto us
[49:46] by his spirit for the spirit searcheth
[49:48] all things yeay the Deep things of God
[49:51] we've gotten into this before about the
[49:53] Deep things of God and and there's
[49:56] something inside of us we come to church
[49:58] you know brother BR says we just can't
[50:00] wait to get there right we can't wait to
[50:03] hear from God there's just something
[50:05] personal that's for me amen bam said in
[50:09] the message Christ is the mystery of God
[50:11] he says but all this mystery is revealed
[50:13] only as he promised to the bride to his
[50:17] bride hell hell is against this
[50:22] truth hell is against this truth of the
[50:25] revelation of this mystery but the bride
[50:27] is standing on it amen that's her
[50:31] stand he says why do you hunger
[50:34] Church why do you thirst it's the father
[50:38] trying to reveal his hidden secret to
[50:41] you he says but you let many things get
[50:45] get it out of you you let your job you
[50:49] let your wife you let your husband you
[50:53] let your children you let the cares of
[50:55] the world you let some Pastor you let
[50:59] somebody else get that out of you when
[51:01] you know that way down in your heart
[51:05] you're thirsting and you're
[51:07] hungering it's God trying to reveal to
[51:10] you see the
[51:12] Revelation that's here in the last
[51:15] day so God placed something inside of us
[51:20] it's a hunger it's a hunger to get ready
[51:23] it's not a hunger to just
[51:26] acts 238 repent get baptized it's not a
[51:29] hunger to just you know I know God sent
[51:32] a
[51:32] prophet okay I fulfill that hunger no
[51:37] job said I will not be satisfied until I
[51:39] awake in his likeness there is a
[51:42] preparation that's that's that's that
[51:44] God is calling us to how many's heard
[51:48] that you have a theophany amen right we
[51:50] have a body already waiting for
[51:54] us we can't sit here
[51:57] and not manifest what we are it's
[51:59] manifesting
[52:01] time uh the devils are becoming more
[52:04] demonic and the Christ the true true
[52:06] believers are becoming more like Christ
[52:08] it's manifesting
[52:10] time and we can't allow the things of
[52:12] the world to get in the way you know
[52:15] Jesus said blessed are they that hunger
[52:17] and thirst after righteous for they
[52:19] shall be filled it's if we don't hunger
[52:21] after becoming prepared we won't get
[52:24] there we won't get there look at the
[52:27] children of
[52:28] Israel they were when they came out of
[52:31] Egypt for some
[52:33] reason they were still
[52:35] mindful of the land that they came out
[52:37] of yes and we've heard this uh you can
[52:42] you
[52:42] can uh uh you can take somebody out of
[52:48] the world but you can't take the world
[52:51] out of
[52:53] somebody and just like in in brother
[52:56] bring that example of a pig you can take
[52:58] a pig out of the barn you can bring him
[53:01] into the house you can wash him up you
[53:04] can powder him you can baby him you can
[53:06] put a bowl on him you say you're going
[53:07] to be with us now you're going to eat
[53:09] dinner with
[53:12] us and you you can share sitting by a
[53:15] fire and reading stories and whatever
[53:18] you do as a family but when it's time to
[53:21] go back outside he's he's he's not going
[53:23] to say I can't wait to come back in the
[53:25] house and be like you
[53:27] he's going to go right back to where his
[53:29] Nature's at amen and if that if that
[53:32] nature doesn't get killed we cannot get
[53:36] prepared so Hebrews 11:14 says for they
[53:41] that say such things declare plainly
[53:44] that they seek a country and truly if
[53:47] they had been mindful of that country
[53:49] from once they came out of they might
[53:51] have had opportunity to have
[53:54] returned but now they desire desire a
[53:57] better
[53:58] country that is a Heavenly country
[54:02] whereof God is not ashamed to call them
[54:05] their God for he has prepared for them a
[54:09] city
[54:11] amen so God has prepared for
[54:14] us
[54:16] already a theophany for us to become to
[54:21] and we're just automatically being drawn
[54:23] to that our our our our mind is is set
[54:27] on being the Bride of Jesus Christ where
[54:29] the world is caught in this place of
[54:32] just complacency and I'm talking about
[54:34] the the lukewarm church member of just
[54:36] just going to church and just just doing
[54:39] as little as possible and still feeling
[54:41] that they're you know
[54:43] predestinated look at that that I'm
[54:45] telling you that is no different than
[54:46] these I don't want to make mention of
[54:48] just you know certain types of churches
[54:50] but there's churches out there
[54:52] denominational churches they they just
[54:53] believe once saved you're always saved
[54:55] as long as you do this it doesn't matter
[54:57] you're you're in no matter
[54:59] what and there's no focus on becoming
[55:02] Into His Image they're just happy that
[55:05] they they repented they got baptized and
[55:07] they they call themselves whatever
[55:08] denomination you want to call
[55:10] yourself but you see that Spirit wants
[55:12] to come into the to the
[55:16] message now you you there that's why the
[55:20] two spirits will be so
[55:22] close and we we got to understand we
[55:25] have got to get prepared because he's
[55:27] already
[55:29] prepared he's prepared a place for
[55:33] us and now we got to get prepared for
[55:36] that and if all we had to do was is do
[55:40] the the uh uh the natural part of
[55:44] repenting and getting baptized in Acts
[55:48] 238 then we would be
[55:51] fine but we we were promised to receive
[55:56] the holy spirit
[55:58] amen now the holy spirit will
[56:02] prove a preparation it will it will
[56:05] prove pressing towards the mark it will
[56:08] prove getting us to the place that we're
[56:10] in His image but too many people fall
[56:13] short they do the natural part the first
[56:15] part and that the walk with Christ does
[56:18] not become
[56:21] spiritual so God has prepared a city
[56:25] okay he also said in John 14 Jesus did I
[56:28] go and I prepare a place for
[56:32] you I will come again and receive you
[56:35] unto myself that where I am there ye may
[56:38] be also and he says the next verse and
[56:41] where I go you you know and you know the
[56:45] way right so he's going to prepare the
[56:49] place and he's telling you know the
[56:52] way so there's got to be a way to get
[56:54] there remember Jesus said um broad is
[56:58] the
[56:59] way why is the gate broad is the way and
[57:02] many go in there at straight is the gate
[57:05] narrow is the way and few be that find
[57:09] it says but you know the way blessed are
[57:11] your ears they hear your your your your
[57:13] heart they understand your eyes they
[57:17] see the way to get
[57:20] in the way to get to that place that's
[57:22] prepared for you
[57:27] Peter said in 2 Peter 1:11 for an
[57:29] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[57:31] abundantly into the
[57:33] Everlasting uh Kingdom of our Lord and
[57:35] Savior Jesus Christ so this way is being
[57:38] ministered God sent a prophit in this
[57:41] hour to to to open the word to us to
[57:45] open the Bible to us not to give us a
[57:47] new Bible but to open the word to us and
[57:52] when we come to church that secret
[57:54] relationship that you have with Christ
[57:56] God speaks to your heart the person
[57:58] sitting next to you they don't know what
[58:00] God spoke to
[58:02] you right amen it it's personal we're
[58:07] here as a group we're here as a body
[58:08] we're a local body we're a family
[58:10] together but you know God deals with us
[58:12] as individuals
[58:14] alone and it has to do with a love
[58:16] affair because the person sitting next
[58:18] to you that they could just be out of
[58:22] it you know they they could still be in
[58:25] so being so carnal so natural so the
[58:29] only reason they're here is because it's
[58:32] church and and and and then the other
[58:34] person on the other side well they could
[58:37] just be so in love they they they
[58:39] prepared themselves for the service how
[58:41] many times have we heard that we got to
[58:42] come and prepare oursel for the
[58:44] service because you get more out of the
[58:46] service when you're
[58:48] prepared well you're going to you're
[58:50] going to don't don't think we're going
[58:51] to make a Rapture without getting
[58:53] prepared it's not going to happen
[58:57] Matthew 24 here Jesus is speaking to the
[59:01] Endtime Believers about preparation but
[59:03] he's also warning the mate
[59:10] believer Matthew 24:42 watch therefore
[59:13] for ye know not what hour the Lord do
[59:16] your lord your lord doth
[59:18] come not even the angels
[59:21] know but know this that if the good men
[59:24] of the house had known in what watch the
[59:27] thief would come he would have watched
[59:30] and would not have suffered his house to
[59:33] be broken up amen therefore be ye also
[59:37] ready for such an hour as you think not
[59:38] the son of man cometh amen now has
[59:41] anybody ever broken into your house to
[59:46] your car or to some property that you
[59:48] ever had is is that have you ever had
[59:50] that experience I certainly
[59:52] have I've had it happen a couple of
[59:55] times when I had had lived uh back uh as
[59:59] a boy as a young young as a boy in my
[1:00:02] home and I had uh a a a stereo taken out
[1:00:06] of my car I had uh coins um taken out of
[1:00:10] the house broken in when I I wasn't
[1:00:12] there uh I also had them take the
[1:00:14] Cadillac converter off our truck at work
[1:00:16] at one time just one time in the
[1:00:18] existence of trusted two I I also had
[1:00:20] him take uh the the the the the guts out
[1:00:24] of the um
[1:00:26] AC unit you know when that was going
[1:00:29] around that had that had those I think
[1:00:32] those four things uh happened uh to me
[1:00:35] that I can recall and I can tell you
[1:00:38] like this that if I would have known
[1:00:40] ahead of time that something like this
[1:00:42] is is is about to
[1:00:45] happen I would have
[1:00:48] prepared I I simply would have said I'm
[1:00:51] not going to allow this to happen amen
[1:00:54] I'm going to I'm going to get my my
[1:00:55] friend my father I'm going to get some
[1:00:57] I'm going to get some help and we're
[1:00:59] just going to get ready for this
[1:01:00] situation and we're going to stop it
[1:01:02] before it
[1:01:04] happens because we know about
[1:01:07] it well Jesus said I'm
[1:01:10] coming I'm coming soon be
[1:01:15] ready now at that point we have to make
[1:01:18] a decision is he truly coming or brother
[1:01:22] Dennis has he per has he delayed is
[1:01:27] coming you
[1:01:29] understand it's it's the thought that we
[1:01:32] have after what he
[1:01:35] said because we've heard for how many
[1:01:37] years brother Marty that he's coming and
[1:01:40] we've come to church and he still hasn't
[1:01:42] arrived like we thought right but you
[1:01:46] know he's coming in the opening of the
[1:01:50] word that should that should let us know
[1:01:53] that the corporate coming is also coming
[1:01:55] if you can see them in in the opening of
[1:01:58] the word personally to you that should
[1:02:00] give you such an excitement that the
[1:02:02] Rapture is just around the
[1:02:04] corner but if you're not receiving from
[1:02:06] them personally that that Rapture looks
[1:02:09] so far
[1:02:10] away are you with
[1:02:12] me he said in verse 44 therefore be ye
[1:02:17] also ready for in such an hour as you
[1:02:19] think
[1:02:21] not that is when the son of man cometh
[1:02:28] this
[1:02:29] word
[1:02:31] becomes the
[1:02:33] message to the
[1:02:36] Believers this word this word that he's
[1:02:40] coming soon this becomes the True Heart
[1:02:45] message to the
[1:02:47] Believers because when he comes what
[1:02:49] does it really matter does it matter how
[1:02:52] many re Revelations you you you you you
[1:02:55] have have or how many Mysteries you know
[1:02:57] or how well you can uh know exactly um
[1:03:02] even who's in and who's out of the
[1:03:04] message or um no no false what these
[1:03:08] false doctrines that people believe or
[1:03:10] or even what's happening in our
[1:03:12] governments in the world and how things
[1:03:14] are going to unfold at the end what is
[1:03:16] it really going to matter when the day
[1:03:19] happens what is it going to matter the
[1:03:22] only thing that's going to matter is am
[1:03:23] I ready for that day that's the only
[1:03:25] thing that
[1:03:26] matters so this becomes the message to
[1:03:29] the bride is to be ready nothing else
[1:03:31] matters you can know everything have
[1:03:33] everything be able to do everything but
[1:03:35] if you're not ready what willon it
[1:03:37] matter so it becomes the message to the
[1:03:40] Believers but to the mate Believers it's
[1:03:43] just a fairy
[1:03:45] tale it's just a fairy tale in other
[1:03:48] words it's there but there's nothing
[1:03:50] that's forcing them or pulling them to
[1:03:53] get ready the believer takes action to
[1:03:56] make herself ready the believer
[1:03:58] continues on the process of making
[1:04:00] herself ready because it is her message
[1:04:06] personally not everybody's going to
[1:04:08] believe be
[1:04:11] ready and of course you know the devil
[1:04:14] wants to get people to believe they got
[1:04:16] the Holy Ghost when they don't why so
[1:04:19] they don't seek it no need to seek it if
[1:04:21] I got
[1:04:22] it right amen
[1:04:26] yeah he wants to beat people up who have
[1:04:28] the Holy Ghost and say you don't have it
[1:04:31] but you know you you just can't deceive
[1:04:33] God God has a way of just making it
[1:04:39] known it's it's true that our our John
[1:04:43] the Baptist his Eagle Eye got dimmed
[1:04:45] over his beak grew out he he needed help
[1:04:48] that's true we go through that but you
[1:04:51] know God will see you through did did
[1:04:54] not uh Jesus Jesus send forth word to
[1:04:58] John the Baptist just tell them what's
[1:05:01] happening the Fulfillment of the
[1:05:03] scriptures is happening in this ministry
[1:05:07] and you are the one that said Behold the
[1:05:08] Lamb of God so God has a way of letting
[1:05:12] us know who we are if we we get off he
[1:05:16] does Amen we don't have to
[1:05:21] worry let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:05:26] what give honor to him for the marriage
[1:05:29] of the Lamb has come and his wife has
[1:05:34] made herself
[1:05:36] ready I want you to ponder today how are
[1:05:39] you making yourself ready just how are
[1:05:43] we doing that are we are we doing that
[1:05:46] by you just fill in the blank what's
[1:05:49] important is not whether or not I
[1:05:53] agree what's important is that you know
[1:05:56] it is making you ready amen because the
[1:05:59] end result is I want you ready amen the
[1:06:02] end result God Wants You Ready it it I
[1:06:05] don't it doesn't even matter if you like
[1:06:07] me I don't mean that
[1:06:09] wrong because it's not about some sort
[1:06:12] of um you've got to agree with me and
[1:06:15] you got to like me and we it that's not
[1:06:18] it what's it is you got to be ready for
[1:06:21] the Rapture I don't have anything to do
[1:06:22] with it's the word of
[1:06:24] God it's between you and God
[1:06:27] Amen now the foolish virgin never took
[1:06:32] action I want you to remember that the
[1:06:34] foolish version she never took action
[1:06:37] she never continued in the process of
[1:06:39] making herself ready for the use or the
[1:06:42] consideration of
[1:06:45] God but she was a
[1:06:50] Believer she felt she was already ready
[1:06:54] this is a real important thing because
[1:06:57] the the devil wants us to always feel
[1:06:59] like we're
[1:07:00] ready always but you notice the holy
[1:07:03] spirit in the Apostle Paul to the first
[1:07:07] church Age The Prophet to the first
[1:07:09] church age he said his message was I I'm
[1:07:14] pressing I haven't attained I haven't
[1:07:17] apprehended I'm pressing towards so here
[1:07:20] was a man that was anointed by God and
[1:07:23] the spirit that was on him was telling
[1:07:25] to press
[1:07:27] in we see the the devil is trying to
[1:07:29] tell us to relax how do you get into Leo
[1:07:33] Leo deia you
[1:07:36] relax so she feels she's already ready
[1:07:39] she's just kind of hanging in there
[1:07:41] waiting for it to
[1:07:42] happen in other words there's no need to
[1:07:45] take action if you're already ready
[1:07:47] there's no need to continue in the
[1:07:49] process of getting ready if you're
[1:07:51] already
[1:07:53] ready so it's a horrible
[1:07:56] Spirit it is a horrible
[1:07:59] Spirit I'm already prepared I'm already
[1:08:02] ready I'm in need of nothing it's proud
[1:08:05] it's arrogant it's foolish and that's
[1:08:07] what the foolish virgins
[1:08:10] had and I don't want to typ this Parable
[1:08:13] we're going to talk about here in a
[1:08:14] second with a lukewarm leoan
[1:08:18] Church whose works are neither hot or
[1:08:22] cold they're like in the middle
[1:08:26] you know they're enough to saywell
[1:08:28] because of this it shows that I'm you
[1:08:31] know I love
[1:08:33] God but they're not looking at
[1:08:37] this Jesus said because you say that
[1:08:39] you're rich or increased with goods and
[1:08:42] have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:08:45] that thou are wretched and miserable
[1:08:47] poor blind and naked so you see the
[1:08:50] attitude is I have what I need I don't
[1:08:55] need anything else the way that I'm
[1:08:57] serving God the way that I am doing what
[1:09:01] I'm doing I don't need anything
[1:09:04] else and the Holy Spirit is he he's he's
[1:09:08] trying to pull us into His Image right
[1:09:11] he's trying to draw us into His Image
[1:09:13] but in order to get there we need
[1:09:15] something more than just being a hearer
[1:09:17] of the word we needed to be a doer of
[1:09:19] the word so we have to put into action
[1:09:20] we have to put in the process that I
[1:09:22] need this for my life
[1:09:26] Luke 12:16 as we read this Parable Luke
[1:09:30] 12:16 and he spake a parable unto them
[1:09:32] saying the ground of a certain rich man
[1:09:34] brought forth plentiful plentifully and
[1:09:38] he thought within himself saying what
[1:09:41] shall I
[1:09:42] do because I have no room where to to
[1:09:46] bestow my fruits I've just got so many
[1:09:49] here and he said this will I do I know
[1:09:52] how to take care of this I'm going to
[1:09:54] pull down my barns and I'm going to
[1:09:55] build greater
[1:09:57] ones and there will and there will I
[1:10:00] bestow all my fruits and my
[1:10:03] goods and I will say to my what my soul
[1:10:09] not my body not my wife not my husband
[1:10:12] not my kids not my parents I say to my
[1:10:16] soul soul thou H has much Goods laid up
[1:10:20] for many years take thine ease
[1:10:27] take thine ease so if you ever have this
[1:10:30] feeling about taking thine ease just
[1:10:33] know that anointing is from the
[1:10:37] devil that anointing is from so eat
[1:10:41] drink and be married now that's a key
[1:10:44] factor we're going to dig into that a
[1:10:46] little bit here later eat drink and be
[1:10:49] married because everybody has to eat
[1:10:51] drink and be married but he's
[1:10:52] setting he's setting a a a picture for
[1:10:57] us when you take it easy we're just
[1:10:59] going to sit and relax take it easy and
[1:11:04] just kind of be merried like have a
[1:11:06] Merry Christmas have a Merry Christmas
[1:11:09] without Jesus amen you understand what
[1:11:12] I'm saying have a Merry Christmas
[1:11:14] without Jesus and
[1:11:18] so the the anointing of the devil wants
[1:11:21] you to speak to yourself because all
[1:11:25] through freeo agency take your
[1:11:28] ease everything's okay you've already
[1:11:32] been baptized you're already in the
[1:11:35] message just take it
[1:11:38] easy and God but God said unto this
[1:11:43] person thou fool this night thy Soul
[1:11:48] shall be required of thee then whose
[1:11:51] shall those things be which thou Hast
[1:11:55] has
[1:11:57] provided and then he says so is he that
[1:12:01] layeth up treasure for himself and is
[1:12:04] not rich towards
[1:12:08] God you understand it's two Spirits one
[1:12:11] is
[1:12:13] selfish and look Goods could be your
[1:12:16] popularity it don't have to be buying a
[1:12:18] bunch of things it could be your
[1:12:21] reputation it could be whatever you want
[1:12:23] it to be
[1:12:26] but what is needed is to be rich towards
[1:12:28] God his kingdom seek first the kingdom
[1:12:32] and his
[1:12:33] righteousness put God first make God's
[1:12:37] kingdom richer because of you and when
[1:12:40] you do that you know what God does He
[1:12:42] blesses you with more of himself it's
[1:12:45] through The Obedience of just doing what
[1:12:47] he wants you to isn't about going home
[1:12:49] and trying to be a monk and being a
[1:12:50] perfect person it's actually putting the
[1:12:52] Life of Christ into action in your life
[1:12:54] looking for opportunity to bring Christ
[1:12:56] to
[1:12:58] somebody take thine ease eat drink and
[1:13:01] be merry this is the same this is the
[1:13:04] same phrase that Jesus uses as it was in
[1:13:07] the days of Noah so shall it be when he
[1:13:10] returns he said there'll be eating
[1:13:14] drinking in other words just take your
[1:13:17] ease
[1:13:18] until they knew it
[1:13:21] not until the flood came yes
[1:13:26] and they were all taken away so shall it
[1:13:29] be at the coming of the son of man in
[1:13:31] other words there's only one group of
[1:13:33] people that is going to be prepared and
[1:13:36] that is the bride amen the foolish
[1:13:38] virgin is not going to be and this this
[1:13:41] what I want to say you know we're trying
[1:13:43] to get certain people to you know really
[1:13:45] try to dig in and they just don't want
[1:13:49] to you can't force them
[1:13:52] to they're making a stand who they are
[1:13:56] because the bride wants to be
[1:13:59] ready you've heard the old story if you
[1:14:01] can talk somebody into something
[1:14:02] somebody is going to come along talk
[1:14:04] them out of
[1:14:05] it right so you can talk somebody for a
[1:14:09] season to get on fire with
[1:14:11] God you know but something greater than
[1:14:14] you is going to come by you know what
[1:14:15] that is that's the devil in somebody
[1:14:17] else and anointing them to take their
[1:14:19] ease to
[1:14:23] relax so I just say like this the bride
[1:14:27] is
[1:14:28] not is not the person that you got to
[1:14:30] keep pushing you don't got to keep you
[1:14:33] you don't got to keep trying to like get
[1:14:35] her to do
[1:14:36] something because there's things already
[1:14:40] prepared for her because she loves
[1:14:42] God right she already loves God she has
[1:14:45] that relationship going now we come to
[1:14:47] church and yes we're we're provoked to
[1:14:49] Good Works we're provoked to make sure
[1:14:51] that we're you know we we cast off the
[1:14:53] works of darkness we're putting on the
[1:14:55] the the the the armor of light and we're
[1:14:57] and we got to oh yes I got to stop doing
[1:14:59] that I need a precedent that but you
[1:15:00] know that's between you and God that's
[1:15:02] the way it's supposed to be it's not
[1:15:04] somebody having to try to tell you you
[1:15:07] know you need to be doing this if if
[1:15:09] that is happening to get you where you
[1:15:11] need to go you really need to get to the
[1:15:13] Altar and get some things decided with
[1:15:14] God Amen come on it's a truth it's a
[1:15:22] truth this this is a condition of being
[1:15:25] relaxed take thy
[1:15:27] knees take it easy have a good
[1:15:31] one no need to preach so serious
[1:15:35] John you know what we we don't need that
[1:15:39] it just doesn't make it doesn't make me
[1:15:40] feel comfortable but I'm telling you if
[1:15:43] you are prepared and you've done
[1:15:44] everything that you need to be you're as
[1:15:46] happy as a lar I don't care what the
[1:15:47] preaching is it's a truth it is the
[1:15:53] truth if you're where your need to be
[1:15:55] you're not going to feel
[1:16:00] condemned because something inside of
[1:16:02] you says I I know where I'm at with
[1:16:07] God and and and if you you're you're
[1:16:10] you're you're rasling then just say Lord
[1:16:12] what is it more that maybe you want me
[1:16:13] to do that's it and then you just say
[1:16:17] Amen to that and and you you you you you
[1:16:20] begin to walk in if and if you're if
[1:16:22] you're not quite sure then get serious
[1:16:24] with God and spend more time with them
[1:16:26] and I'm telling you just in that time of
[1:16:28] process of of spending time with God
[1:16:31] things happen they that wait upon the
[1:16:32] Lord renew their strength amen I tell
[1:16:34] you God does when you you're in a
[1:16:36] problem and you got things going on in
[1:16:38] your life that they're real bad and you
[1:16:39] get down on your knees and you pray and
[1:16:41] you get strength that doesn't mean your
[1:16:43] problem is resolved that doesn't mean
[1:16:45] God takes it away that just mean God is
[1:16:47] there with you to be with you as you go
[1:16:49] through that
[1:16:50] problem why and and that's all that
[1:16:52] matters
[1:16:57] Paul told Timothy for the time will come
[1:17:00] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[1:17:02] but after their own lust shall Heap to
[1:17:04] themselves teachers having itchy ears
[1:17:06] for they shall turn their ears from the
[1:17:09] truth and shall be turned onto
[1:17:12] fables we're living in that hour yes
[1:17:17] Titus hold fast the faithful word is it
[1:17:22] have been taught that ye may be able to
[1:17:26] by sound Doctrine both to
[1:17:28] exhort and to convince the
[1:17:31] gainsayers for there are many unruly and
[1:17:35] vain talkers yes all they do is talk
[1:17:40] they you watch their life and they will
[1:17:42] not come under subjection to the word
[1:17:44] amen for there are many unruly vain
[1:17:48] talkers and
[1:17:50] deceivers especially they of the
[1:17:53] circumcision
[1:17:56] you know if your heart isn't really
[1:17:58] wanting to be
[1:18:01] circumcised you're you're you're you're
[1:18:04] you're just you're going to still do
[1:18:06] your own will right so you have to give
[1:18:09] up your will whose mouth Must Be Stopped
[1:18:11] who subvert whole
[1:18:14] houses teaching things that they ought
[1:18:18] not for filthy lucer
[1:18:23] sake peral times we're living
[1:18:27] in we live with all these Spirits are
[1:18:29] disguising themselves transforming
[1:18:32] themselves having doctrines of devils
[1:18:35] now what are those doctrines of devils
[1:18:37] the seducing Spirits you know what
[1:18:39] they're doing they're causing people
[1:18:40] just to
[1:18:42] relax just
[1:18:44] relax don't get serious we do not want
[1:18:48] you going to the Altar and asking God
[1:18:50] for help we don't want that we do not
[1:18:53] want you leaving the the church feeling
[1:18:56] that you need to to try harder we do not
[1:18:59] want that we want to entertain you we
[1:19:01] want you to feel good we want you to
[1:19:03] enjoy the
[1:19:06] service in the
[1:19:08] flesh I might add in the flesh but see
[1:19:11] it don't feed the inner man amen it
[1:19:14] don't feed the inner man so these
[1:19:17] Spirits are are causing us there's no
[1:19:19] need to press in that much there's no
[1:19:21] need to get ready there's no need to
[1:19:22] prepare
[1:19:25] some shall even depart from the faith
[1:19:28] scoffers walking after their own lust
[1:19:30] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:19:34] coming
[1:19:35] amen I know when I first came into the
[1:19:38] message I tell you the first the thing
[1:19:40] that was Pro most dominant in my heart
[1:19:42] is God is coming soon I remember that as
[1:19:45] clear as day walking in fear that it
[1:19:49] could be any time so when I step into
[1:19:51] church I better I better get what I need
[1:19:54] so so that I am prepared that when he
[1:19:57] comes he's going to receive
[1:19:59] me and because it hasn't happened the
[1:20:02] way we thought now how many times did we
[1:20:03] think he would come by here by here by
[1:20:05] here I'll tell you I had so many dates
[1:20:07] now I never told I never like preached
[1:20:09] it or or or said that but in myself I
[1:20:13] thought remember brother Bob Crawford
[1:20:15] telling me how many times he thought
[1:20:17] this car was going to be the last car I
[1:20:21] buy and so we got these preconceived
[1:20:24] ideas that he's going to come but he
[1:20:25] hasn't come and and it causes the spirit
[1:20:27] to be more real to
[1:20:29] you amen and we just got to stay in love
[1:20:33] with the Lord just stay in love with
[1:20:36] him now right after Jesus foretells the
[1:20:39] signs of his second coming he urges the
[1:20:43] followers to be ready and he gives this
[1:20:46] Parable in the next chapter and he talks
[1:20:50] about being prepared it's about the 10
[1:20:53] virgins if you want to to turn their
[1:20:55] Revelations chapter
[1:20:56] 25 five of The Virgins were ready to
[1:21:01] meet Jesus in The
[1:21:03] Rapture they were ready and the five who
[1:21:07] did not prepare to meet Jesus they were
[1:21:11] not
[1:21:12] ready and I'll say it like this the
[1:21:15] foolish only had enough
[1:21:17] oil to burn for a short
[1:21:21] time they obviously were burning for a
[1:21:24] short time time because you'll see in
[1:21:26] the parable he says their lamp went out
[1:21:29] that's right but they took no oil with
[1:21:33] them and and we're we understand this
[1:21:36] because Brother Band told us that
[1:21:38] justification is a part of the Holy
[1:21:41] Ghost it's a part of the oil by you just
[1:21:43] repenting saying God I give you my heart
[1:21:46] that's the working of the Holy Ghost in
[1:21:48] you we cannot deny the children of
[1:21:50] Israel came out of Egypt we cannot deny
[1:21:52] that but we have to admit they did not
[1:21:56] have enough oil to go into the promised
[1:21:58] land and they died in the wilderness
[1:22:00] Jesus said with many of them God was not
[1:22:02] pleased with them right
[1:22:04] amen so it's important that we take
[1:22:07] enough oil with us to make it into the
[1:22:09] Rapture amen all right Matthew
[1:22:13] 25:1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[1:22:16] likened unto 10 virgins which took their
[1:22:17] lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:22:20] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[1:22:24] and five were
[1:22:26] foolish so it had nothing to do about
[1:22:29] them being a virgin or a
[1:22:32] churchgoer not even living you know they
[1:22:34] living decent lives but one was trying
[1:22:37] to do it in their
[1:22:39] flesh they they didn't want to give
[1:22:41] their will totally over to the Lord
[1:22:43] because that's what it really takes you
[1:22:45] know if you know what the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:47] the Holy Ghost is the will of God in
[1:22:49] your life
[1:22:55] it
[1:22:56] is a foolish virgin he still goes to
[1:22:59] church still believes God still believes
[1:23:01] the word but he's doing his
[1:23:04] will and the Holy Ghost is inside you
[1:23:07] the Holy Ghost is never look at this the
[1:23:09] Holy Ghost is never going to live in you
[1:23:10] and say yeah you just go ahead and do
[1:23:12] what you want to
[1:23:13] do it's just not going to
[1:23:16] happen if if you remember that's how we
[1:23:19] were when he saved
[1:23:20] us we were doing our own will amen and
[1:23:24] so the Holy Ghost comes inside remember
[1:23:27] Jesus said I've come to do thy will oh
[1:23:30] God and we're born not of our will but
[1:23:34] we're born of God's will okay he say
[1:23:37] they that were foolish they took their
[1:23:39] lambs and took no oil with them so I
[1:23:43] just want to stop here for a second you
[1:23:45] hear the preaching of the word and the
[1:23:47] word of God says you need to get more
[1:23:49] Holy Ghost you need to seek more of God
[1:23:50] you need to press in and the devil says
[1:23:52] what are they saying I don't got the
[1:23:53] Holy Ghost what's what's wrong with me
[1:23:56] you know this is not making sense to me
[1:23:59] and the the the ministry of the word is
[1:24:01] be sure be sure get more press in don't
[1:24:05] entertain thoughts of
[1:24:08] attained but if you're going to air a on
[1:24:10] the side of I need more there is nothing
[1:24:13] wrong about doing that
[1:24:16] am but there is something wrong with
[1:24:20] gambling there's something wrong with
[1:24:22] that so they took no oil with them but
[1:24:26] the wise took oil let me just say this
[1:24:28] by the
[1:24:30] way how many believes that you have the
[1:24:33] Holy Ghost let me just see your hands
[1:24:36] okay you have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:41] now do you remember the day you got the
[1:24:44] Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost okay let me ask you a question and
[1:24:49] just be honest with me do you have more
[1:24:52] Holy Ghost today than you did that day
[1:24:57] okay that that that that's enough to
[1:24:59] prove what I'm saying is that you need
[1:25:04] more and we need to press into that
[1:25:06] thought process not the thought process
[1:25:08] that we don't have we already got it but
[1:25:11] more give me oil in my lamp keep me
[1:25:15] burning right just more more more of you
[1:25:18] Lord
[1:25:20] more that hunger that thirst is what
[1:25:23] gets you to that that place of
[1:25:25] preparation for the
[1:25:27] Rapture but the wise they took oil in
[1:25:30] their lamp in their in their vessels
[1:25:33] with their
[1:25:37] lamps they made sure that there was
[1:25:41] something inside of them for the future
[1:25:44] not for now they didn't need it as it
[1:25:46] were because they were in the same place
[1:25:49] that the foolish were they were lit they
[1:25:52] hadn't they had that confession they had
[1:25:54] their faith I believe they had that but
[1:25:58] they didn't take what they needed for
[1:25:59] the future and this is where the where
[1:26:02] the foolish version mess up because they
[1:26:04] say well I'm going to church like Bob
[1:26:06] I'm doing what Bob does I I'm doing this
[1:26:08] I'm reading the Bible I'm in the
[1:26:10] message that's what they're looking at
[1:26:12] but they're not looking at the
[1:26:14] future that's the whole reason of
[1:26:16] pressing in for more is for the future
[1:26:19] you'll see this and while the bridegroom
[1:26:22] T they all slum and slept see so they're
[1:26:26] needing the oil for
[1:26:28] after and at midnight there was a cry
[1:26:32] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[1:26:35] out to meet
[1:26:36] him well we know that was the message of
[1:26:39] the
[1:26:43] hour and the message actually told us
[1:26:47] how to meet him
[1:26:49] amen how to meet him what it what it
[1:26:52] required to meet him you you literally
[1:26:54] have to come buy of me without money
[1:26:57] without
[1:26:58] price you have to give your heart your
[1:27:01] life that's all God has ever wanted he
[1:27:03] wants a
[1:27:04] relationship but he wants the
[1:27:06] relationship based on his will
[1:27:11] amen we have not been born again of our
[1:27:16] will we or we haven't been born again of
[1:27:19] a high bread part our will part God's
[1:27:22] will we have born been Born Again of
[1:27:25] God's will period and you understand the
[1:27:28] the the thing of the Holy Ghost more
[1:27:30] Holy Ghost gets rid of more of your
[1:27:33] will it doesn't make you smarter and
[1:27:36] more knowledge knowledge puffs up but
[1:27:39] the Holy Ghost it
[1:27:40] edifies and the and the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:43] the love of
[1:27:50] God it's what it takes to meet him is
[1:27:55] that what the message brought to us this
[1:27:57] is why people who belittle the message
[1:28:00] of the
[1:28:03] hour who do not take it
[1:28:06] seriously they're going to miss
[1:28:09] it and and I'm going to say it like this
[1:28:12] there are a lot of people in the message
[1:28:15] that the message is not in
[1:28:17] them it it's just like being in church
[1:28:20] but it doesn't make them a
[1:28:23] Christian they got to get Christ in them
[1:28:25] they got to get the church in them oh my
[1:28:28] my I cannot believe that
[1:28:30] time is uh it it's like it always was in
[1:28:34] the past it just goes by like quicker
[1:28:36] than you want to go I wish we could just
[1:28:38] like stop time you know from 10:30 you
[1:28:41] know to 11:30 and then when I'm done I'm
[1:28:45] done and then we all feel like oh it's
[1:28:46] just a regular
[1:28:48] service all right let's continue reading
[1:28:50] then all those virgins arose and they TR
[1:28:54] their lamp okay I'm ready I'm ready I'm
[1:28:57] believing I'm
[1:29:00] believing and the foolish said unto the
[1:29:03] wise give us your oil for our lamps have
[1:29:07] gone
[1:29:10] out and the wise answered saying not
[1:29:14] so lest there be not enough for us and
[1:29:18] you but go you rather to them that sell
[1:29:22] and buy for yourselves
[1:29:25] and while they went to get
[1:29:28] it the bridegroom came and they that
[1:29:32] were ready that were already
[1:29:37] ready went in with him to the marriage
[1:29:40] and the door was
[1:29:42] shut afterwards came also the other
[1:29:45] virgin saying Lord what about us come on
[1:29:48] what about us I know you love
[1:29:51] us and he answered and said verely I say
[1:29:54] to you I know you
[1:29:55] not watch therefore for you know for ye
[1:29:59] know neither the day nor the hour when
[1:30:00] the son of man cometh now this is just
[1:30:02] not a
[1:30:04] story this is here to make sure that
[1:30:06] we're serious about making sure that we
[1:30:09] got enough of of of the all the Holy
[1:30:13] Ghost it ought to provoke us to just get
[1:30:16] a little bit
[1:30:17] more really what do we got to
[1:30:19] lose what we don't got nothing to lose
[1:30:23] you know no 's going to look at you and
[1:30:25] say oh look he's up at the altar she's
[1:30:27] up at the altar there must be something
[1:30:29] wrong with them no there's something
[1:30:30] great happening with
[1:30:32] them they're literally wanting more what
[1:30:35] they than what they
[1:30:37] got the altar isn't just to say Lord I'm
[1:30:41] I'm
[1:30:44] sorry the Lord is I want more the the
[1:30:47] altar is I want
[1:30:50] more I hope you're catching what I'm
[1:30:52] saying
[1:30:54] Matthew 22 let's try to do this one real
[1:30:56] quick we won't be able to get them all
[1:30:59] and you know unfortunately there wasn't
[1:31:00] a lot of scriptures but we just took our
[1:31:03] time as we went through this I'm sure
[1:31:04] you're getting you're getting the
[1:31:06] message today Matthew 22 ver1 and Jesus
[1:31:09] answered and spake unto them again by
[1:31:11] Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:31:13] is like unto a certain King which made a
[1:31:15] marriage for his son we should all be
[1:31:17] able to relate to this every one of us
[1:31:18] here and sent forth his servants to call
[1:31:20] them that were bidden to the wedding and
[1:31:22] they would not not
[1:31:25] come sometimes it's really hard to try
[1:31:28] to even get somebody to come to church
[1:31:30] they got every excuse in the
[1:31:33] world basically they didn't want to come
[1:31:36] to the wedding and he sent forth other
[1:31:39] servants saying tell them which are
[1:31:41] bidden behold I have pardoned uh I
[1:31:44] prepared I have prepared my dinner my Ox
[1:31:47] my f fatlings are killed and all things
[1:31:50] are ready come unto the marage so God
[1:31:53] has prepared
[1:31:54] his
[1:31:55] part and now he's trying to tell his
[1:31:58] those that are coming to the wedding you
[1:32:00] prepare to come to the
[1:32:02] wedding and the and the thing is come
[1:32:06] but you know you can't come to God with
[1:32:07] your will so as you're coming to the
[1:32:10] wedding and God says give up this start
[1:32:13] doing this become more like me that is
[1:32:16] where you make that decision I Love You
[1:32:19] Lord amen and then he is prepared and he
[1:32:22] reveals to you what he has prepared for
[1:32:25] you so you say yes Lord it's worth it to
[1:32:27] be just like
[1:32:29] you it's a love affair
[1:32:32] amen but they made light of it and they
[1:32:34] went their ways they made light of it
[1:32:37] take your
[1:32:38] ease went their ways one to his farm his
[1:32:43] his house one to his business to his
[1:32:47] merchandise and the remnant took his
[1:32:50] servants and treated them despitefully
[1:32:51] and slew them but when the king heard
[1:32:53] their thereof he was rought he sent
[1:32:54] forth his armies to destroy those
[1:32:56] murders and burn up their cities and he
[1:32:58] saith to his servants the wedding is
[1:33:00] it's still
[1:33:01] ready but they that were bidden were not
[1:33:04] even
[1:33:06] worthy and he he went remember he went
[1:33:10] to prepare a place for them
[1:33:14] but we show whether we're part of that
[1:33:16] place we show whether we're worthy of
[1:33:19] that place by responding to the word by
[1:33:23] responding to the word go ye therefore
[1:33:26] into the highways and as many as you
[1:33:30] shall find bid them to the marage now we
[1:33:34] understand that the Jews rejected Christ
[1:33:36] and now it's who whosoever will verse 10
[1:33:39] so those servants went out into the
[1:33:41] highways and gathered together all as
[1:33:43] many as they found both bad and
[1:33:47] good in other words don't worry about
[1:33:49] your
[1:33:50] past and the wedding was furnished with
[1:33:53] guests
[1:33:54] and when the king came to see the guest
[1:33:57] he saw that there was there there's a
[1:33:59] man which had not a wedding
[1:34:02] garment this man tried getting into the
[1:34:06] Rapture without getting
[1:34:09] prepared he wanted to get in his own
[1:34:12] way and he said unto them friend how
[1:34:15] camest thou hither not having a wedding
[1:34:17] garment and he was
[1:34:20] speechless then said the king to to the
[1:34:22] servant bind him hand and foot take him
[1:34:26] away cast him into outer darkness and
[1:34:27] there shall be weeping and nashing of
[1:34:29] teeth now this represents
[1:34:33] tribulation you can't make a Rapture
[1:34:35] unless you got the Garment on and the
[1:34:37] Garment is
[1:34:39] him right you're you're dressed with him
[1:34:43] you're not coming in with your own you
[1:34:45] take what the what the Chamberlain gives
[1:34:47] you for many are called to the wedding
[1:34:51] but only few are chosen
[1:34:54] amen so look where you're being drawn
[1:34:58] to all right Luke
[1:35:00] 12:41 if you could with me just uh kind
[1:35:04] of
[1:35:05] ignore the
[1:35:09] clock now ignore the clock pay attention
[1:35:12] to the word amen Luke 12:41 then Peter
[1:35:16] said unto him Lord speakest thou this
[1:35:18] Parable unto us or or even to all and
[1:35:21] the Lord said who then is a faith and
[1:35:24] wise Steward whom his Lord shall make
[1:35:26] ruler over his own house to give them
[1:35:28] their portion of meat in due season
[1:35:30] blessed is the man whom his Lord when he
[1:35:33] cometh shall find so doing just being a
[1:35:36] faithful Steward of what God has given
[1:35:39] you of a truth I say unto you that he
[1:35:42] will make him ruler over all that he
[1:35:46] have but if that servant say in his
[1:35:49] heart notice he doesn't say that to his
[1:35:52] wife or to his husband or to their
[1:35:54] children or to their mom and dad to the
[1:35:57] pastor but in his heart he said my Lord
[1:36:02] delayeth is
[1:36:04] coming and she'll begin to beat the
[1:36:06] maids the uh men's servants and maidens
[1:36:09] and to eat and drink and be drunken
[1:36:11] there it is again to be at ease to eat
[1:36:14] to drink to be married to be drunken
[1:36:16] just be at ease and what what does it
[1:36:18] mean to beat okay I just I just want to
[1:36:21] say this here look you know what it
[1:36:24] really means to to to beat you don't
[1:36:27] care about anybody but
[1:36:29] yourself that's beat that is
[1:36:34] beat you know we we we think beat is no
[1:36:39] brother bam says he that hates somebody
[1:36:41] is guilty of murder and they didn't need
[1:36:42] to murder him so I just I just want us
[1:36:45] to to get us to see that when we begin
[1:36:48] to get selfish with our
[1:36:50] life we're taking it easy we we feel it
[1:36:53] our heart that the Lord delayeth is
[1:36:55] coming because if you knew he was coming
[1:36:57] today you wouldn't take it
[1:36:59] easy
[1:37:02] right so you see that the spirit that
[1:37:04] we're fighting against here the verse 46
[1:37:07] and the Lord of that servant will come
[1:37:09] in a day when you look for him not when
[1:37:11] you look not for him and an hour when he
[1:37:13] is not aware and will cut him aunder and
[1:37:16] will appoint him his portion with the
[1:37:19] unbelievers notice this person was not
[1:37:22] an unbeliever
[1:37:24] he was a mate believer but the mate
[1:37:27] believer and the unbeliever go to the
[1:37:28] same place their portion is the same
[1:37:34] place and that servant which knew his
[1:37:37] Lord's will and prepared not
[1:37:42] himself neither did according to his
[1:37:44] will shall be beaten with many
[1:37:48] stripes that's why the prophet said you
[1:37:51] never leave here the same you're either
[1:37:54] closer or further away and he and but he
[1:37:58] that knew not and did commit things
[1:38:01] worthy of Stripes he's going to be
[1:38:03] beaten with fewer
[1:38:05] stripes for unto whomsoever much is
[1:38:08] given of him shall be much required and
[1:38:11] to whom men shall committed much of him
[1:38:14] they shall be asked the more says I come
[1:38:17] not to send fire on the earth I said I
[1:38:20] am come to send fire on the earth and
[1:38:23] what what will I if it be already
[1:38:26] kindled in other words there's something
[1:38:28] inside of God what is he doing why is he
[1:38:31] sending this
[1:38:32] fire but I have a baptism to be baptized
[1:38:35] with and how am I straightened till it
[1:38:38] be accomplished and other words God has
[1:38:40] a
[1:38:43] purpose he wants to take a bride out of
[1:38:45] here and he knows not everybody's
[1:38:48] going suppose ye that I come to give
[1:38:50] peace on the earth I tell you no oh but
[1:38:54] rather division in other words when that
[1:38:56] baby was born peace unto all men Good
[1:38:59] Will to everybody the the option was out
[1:39:02] there to everybody it was
[1:39:04] presented but he knows he can't stay
[1:39:06] like that there's a there's a time and
[1:39:08] an opportunity for man to make a
[1:39:09] decision and he wants man to make a
[1:39:11] decision he said I'd rather have you hot
[1:39:13] or cold but this's lukewarm no
[1:39:16] way so here he is with this fire inside
[1:39:19] of him and he says I I I I don't come to
[1:39:22] get peace but neighbor rather a division
[1:39:24] for from henceforth from this point
[1:39:27] forward there shall be five in one house
[1:39:31] divided three against the two and two
[1:39:35] against the
[1:39:36] three he knows about it not everybody is
[1:39:41] going to say yes I'm going to serve you
[1:39:46] lord it's not going to
[1:39:49] happen I mean we want to do what the
[1:39:51] prophet said we want to apply the token
[1:39:53] we all got loved ones who are out of the
[1:39:55] Ark of Safety that's just all there is
[1:39:57] to
[1:39:58] it now we want to believe for them we
[1:40:02] don't want to have any negative attitude
[1:40:03] towards it but in reality God is calling
[1:40:08] to make a
[1:40:10] stand God is looking for us to say me in
[1:40:13] my
[1:40:13] house we will serve the
[1:40:16] Lord and that's the attitude that needs
[1:40:18] to be in our homes that's the attitude
[1:40:20] that needs to be in our life amen we
[1:40:23] live literally need to look at one
[1:40:24] another our brothers and sisters and say
[1:40:26] come on we need to get
[1:40:28] going this is the way walking in it we
[1:40:31] need to get closer to God
[1:40:35] 2025
[1:40:37] amen we don't want to sit there to just
[1:40:40] you know eat drink be merry take it ease
[1:40:44] we're in the message no what don't we

[1:41:34] you're standing Hebrews 11:7 by faith
[1:41:37] Noah being warned of God of things not
[1:41:39] seen as yet he was moved with
[1:41:44] fear that means he respected the
[1:41:47] Lord he was moved with respect to God
[1:41:51] and he prepared an AR
[1:41:54] to the saving of his house by which he
[1:41:57] condemned the whole world and became
[1:42:00] heir of righteousness which is by faith
[1:42:02] I'll say it like this we all need to
[1:42:06] prepare our
[1:42:09] homes our loved ones we need I would
[1:42:12] rather be hated by them and tell them
[1:42:15] today this is the only way Christ is the
[1:42:18] only
[1:42:19] way because by us being nice to them
[1:42:21] they're not going to look at us and say
