just pray that word has preeminence in us and as we get ready to approach the word if we could see this little course teach us to number our days if we were on our deathbed I'm sure we would be looking at the service the word a little bit more serious and so let's just ask God to prepare us as we sing this he just you number are dead who teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom Lord teach us to number our days teachers to number party teach us to number our Dean that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom or teach us to number our days one more time teach us

word we wanna welcome everyone to our livestream today if there's anyone that's new for the first time god bless you on a welcome units that the Lord Jesus would just bless you real good he's alive and well and capable of doing that amen amen turn with me if you would to the Book of Luke chapter 14 Luke chapter 14 verse 31 we we want to talk about is as far as the subject how much does God expect out of our lives and it's something that we we think about every time that we're asked to do something of the Lord their flesh doesn't want to do it and and so there's this question that we have is how much does God expect out of our lives and we're going to try to get into that today Luke chapter 14 verse 31 before we begin reading there if we could just ask God to anoint this word to our hearts amen Heavenly Father we thank you for this this precious word this dear to our heart where David said I hide it in my heart that are not sin against the Lord we love you we love your word God we want to grow in your word we want to grow have it drove richly inside of us and we want to love that word more with that we may keep that Commandments and we pray that this service would be a supernatural service for everyone that's listening today the Lord you would meet one-on-one with everyone their homes father lore that this word would become revealed and so personal that God they would know of a surely Lord what you have expected out of them Lord as we get into this this deep subject but yet large so simple pray that you just reveal yourself to us bless this word now Lord as we commit this service in the reading of these scriptures now into your hands for we ask it and give you the glory for it all in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen Luke chapter 14 starting with verse number 31 or what King goeth to make war against another king in sitteth not down first in comes salted whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh to him with twenty thousand you're outnumbered there hey when you're you're in about in you're outnumbered you need something more than what you got they men or else while the other is a great way off he sendeth in ambassadors an ambassador desiring conditions of peace because he knows he just can't do it so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he have he cannot be my disciple Amen god bless you you may be seated ruinin entitled this an unconditional surrender last fall in September of 2019 an and sister Jeanne went to Hawaii on vacation and on her second day there on the islands she went to Pearl Harbor and boarded the battleship the USS Missouri there on that flag ship of the Third Fleet she read the official document the instrument of surrender that was signed on September 2nd 1945 by July of 1945 sixty-four Japanese cities had been largely or partially destroyed by conventional bombs during world war ii and were asked to surrender but they refused the following month on August 6th of 1945 the u.s. dropped an atomic bomb called the little boy bomb it was made of uranium on Hiroshima destroying over 60% of the developed city and killing between 70 and 80 thousand people because of the jet because of the Japanese refusing to accept surrender on July 26 of 1945 so they had a chance to surrender they were asked to surrender but they chose not to the New York Times said that that bomb at that time was equal to 20 tons of TNT Japan still refused to accept surrender and the terms of the Potsdam Declaration even after that first bomb just three days later the u.s. dropped a second atomic bomb it was called The Fatman it was made of plutonium it was more powerful and it was dropped on a city that manufactured weapons of destruction called Nagasaki and you have read about this in seen in history killing 40,000 more people with an additional 70,000 people dying from the aftermath just within four months today we have bombs that can produce three thousand times more damage think about that they're literally too big to use the US had plans for more atomic bombs but Japan wise Lee surrendered an early Sunday morning on September 2nd 1945 when the USS Missouri was docked in Tokyo Bay the Japanese delegation boarded the last battleship commissioned into the United States Navy to sign the instrument of surrender making the official ending of War World War two as most of us know a General Douglas MacArthur and nine Allied nations were represented there nozanne was reading this document when she was on vacation her attention drew to what caught her what caught her eye was these words unconditional surrender and these words I hope catch our attention this morning an unconditional surrender is a surrender in which no guarantees are given to the surrendering party when you unconditionally promise to surrender it's not limited by conditions it's an absolute surrender means to give oneself up to submit or yield oneself to the power of another what the Japanese had really feared was the destruction of the entire framework for rule that's what they wanted they wanted to rule and they didn't want to give up rule the ultimate is to surrender that rule to someone else without any say-so that's unconditional it's no different with any human being it is not in the human being in the nature of a man to want to give up or unconditionally surrender to will of God we were born with a very selfish spirit nature a complete self-centered will to the soul that hasn't been converted yet everything still evolves around them and you don't want to give that up you don't want to surrender that as it were to God Ephesians chapter 2 verse 3 sharing a little bit of that with us here among whom also we all notice that word all had our conversations in times past in the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and Word by nature the children of Wrath even as others we just we didn't not only we did not want to surrender our will over to God we didn't even know God we didn't care about God we didn't want nothing to doing about God that was just the spirit in us and you know got time but if you want to write it down Romans 3 verses 11 through 18 everyone basically is just seeking their own will they're not seeking God's will but their own will an animal doesn't know its creator I want you to think about this for a little bit an animal doesn't know its creator sure it will discover who its mother is but not where its life came from and neither does an animalistic nature in humans know its creator humans eventually discover who their mother is but most never discover where their life came from thus never ever learning the reason further existed so that's why so many people they just can't seem to function they don't real have a real purpose in life Romans chapter 1 verse 25 tells us about a lot of these humans who worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator they they worship and serve the creation more than the Creator who is blessed for evermore amen they will look at the Grand Canyon and standing all at it they will spend hours staring at the ocean and be amazed at its beauty and the sound they will paint pictures and they will sing songs and there were write books about God's creation and never mentioned God in it it's a she don't want to give credit don't want acknowledge why is that Romans 1 verse 28 tells us that they did not like to retain God in their knowledge although talk about how pretty the birds sing how fast the hummingbirds wings move or how fast the cheetah can run on land did you know that a snail can sleep for three years how would you like to do the study on that one furthermore elephants are the only animals that can't jump it takes a sloth two weeks to digest his food I don't think humans could hold out that long did you know that that long net giraffe has no vocal cords how a black cow can eat green grass go through four stomachs and simply nearly 200 thousands of glass of white milk in a slave planet or know an octopus did you know that the octopus has three hearts did you know that most some of us know this probably that while dolphins are smart creatures that call each other by name and the probably more of us know that dogs have a sense of smell that's a hundred times a hundred thousand times stronger than humans think about that but they have just one sixth of our taste buds no wonder they put some of you in their mouth they say that the fingerprint of a koala bear are so indistinguishable from humans that on occasions they've been confused at a crime scene I just want to know who's been putting those little creatures in the database even God tells us to consider the ant that we can learn a lot people are so amazed at God's creation but many don't want to admit that there is a God who created everything they love to talk about it but they don't want to retain God in their thoughts in their minds if people possibly consider that was God that created them they would have to consider for themselves that they were created by God for our purpose and then they would have to answer to that God it's not in the nature of an animal to want to know their Creator and it's not in the the nature of humans that are born with that same humanistic animalistic nature to want to know its creator they were born in sin shape and iniquity Peter calls them natural brute beasts of course we know where we came from our natural seed with man's animalistic nature he simply doesn't want to know his creator that's why when you look back in your life and you were just out in the world just doing everything that you wanted God wasn't a part of your plan thank God he was we were a part of his amen Peter says walking after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness despised government's presumptuous are they self willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities people just lacked so much respect they don't even got respect for themselves an animal will not unconditionally surrender its will it has to be beaten or forced to that's why Jesus said we must be born again because he's not one about beating his will into us he's a gentleman in order for that experience to happen for our nature to change we must surrender to God unconditionally like the lamb unconditionally surrenders its whoa to the shears like the Lamb of God he was led to the slaughter of Calvary Jesus unconditionally surrendered his will to the Father remember when he was asking for his will for the cup if the cup could pass him and he wouldn't have to go through this way of suffering and he prayed that three times it was important to his flesh his flesh just didn't wanna have to suffer us like ours he understands what we're going through but he ended his heart and his prayer by saying not my will but thine be done he unconditionally surrendered for this purpose he came to the earth Paul was led to the slaughter many times over and over and we've read it many times he was stoned and whipped and so many things was done to him he unconditionally surrendered he said though I I'd be free from all men I make myself a servant Jesus I must show how many things he must suffer for my namesake must Jesus bear the cross alone no there's a cross for all of us Paul unconditionally surrendered his will to Jesus a certain prophet named Agabus in Acts chapter 21 verse number 11 next 21 verse 11 and when he was come unto us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that oneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles and when they heard these things both we and they that were of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem but noticed it was the Holy Ghost that told him and the natural part of these believers were trying to tell him not to go but Paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break my heart for I am ready not to be bound only but also to diet Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul had unconditionally surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying though well the Lord be done amen unconditionally started thank God for Paul thank God for leaders that are enough not willing to to quit hey man but they unconditionally surrender amen what an example for us to follow Japan had a will to blow up Pearl Harbor the u.s. had a will to blow up Japan and they were blown into pieces Japan still had a will to destroy us but they unconditionally surrendered it to the will the u.s. did you know that the majority of the people accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior do not unconditionally surrender their lives they don't unconditionally surrender it I would say that the majority that people do need about that it's a requirement let's look at some some scriptures of common salvation that are often used by believers in Romans chapter 10 verse number nine just appreciate your prayers that God would help us to better receive Oh to get what God has for us today into better to receive it amen Romans chapter 10 verse 9 just some some scriptures here that talk about salvation let's just see if they talk about an unconditional surrender okay Romans chapter 10 verse 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in my heart that gotta raise him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart the man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so right there and I read that to the to the natural mind I don't see anything about an unconditional surrender I just see you just got to confess with your mouth you've got to believe with your heart and you're gonna be saved I don't see anything there about unconditional surrender Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us for when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and he continues in verse eight for by grace are you saved through faith and it's not of yourselves it is the gift of God so here we see it's it's grace that saves us we just have to believe again just through faith and it's a gift so I don't see anything here about unconditional surrender these scriptures are often used look at Romans chapter 5 verse 18 therefore as by the offence of one judgement of by the offence of one and that was Adam judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one Jesus Christ the free gift came upon all men unto justification look at that the free gift it just came upon all men for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners right we didn't have anything to do with it and Adams disobedience we were born sinners so by the obedience of one so many be made righteous I mean I in these scriptures here I don't see anything about having to surrender unconditionally surrender to God I mean God is he's awesome God he blesses us he gives us life look at mark 16 verse 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned so it looks like here you just gotta believe believe X 15 verse 11 but we believe but we believe through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved another scripture nothing about having to surrender your will to God unconditionally next chapter 16 verse 31 when a guard at a prison as Paul and Silas sirs what must we do to be saved they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved in thy house that's Acts chapter 16 verse 31 believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house now to the natural mind none of these scriptures refer to a need of an unconditional surrender to but they're often used in the scriptures and often used which makes us to think in the natural way does God really require an unconditional surrender do we really need that old-time religion that how fire-and-brimstone preaching now I don't have anything negative at all to say about these scriptures but I do want to ask the question do we have the right interpretation of them do we have a complete understanding what it means to receive this gift and to believe John chapter 7 verse 38 Jesus seen here he that believeth on me as the Scriptures have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so we have to believe not in a personal way our own personal interpretation but we have to believe as the scripture teaches us to believe everybody's got a different view of belief we're concerned about the one that Jesus spoke of and it it takes we need revelation amen we need true revelation what are the rest of the Scriptures have to say about this because Jesus told us in John 5:39 to search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but the Scriptures are really what testify of him not what we think not how we interpret believing they're not testifying it's the scriptures that testify 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 15 the Holy Scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith that's what Paul told Timothy which is in Christ Jesus the Scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation think about that pause I had to do is just believe why do I need the rest of the scriptures all Scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for for correction remember that for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works we need to hunger and thirst for the inspiration of God that we may catch the real meaning of this this morning knowdo chapter 1 verse 5 so I will therefore put you in remembrance though he wants know knew these things how that the Lord having saved the people of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believed not so one time the children of Israel believed and were saved but because they did not continue to walk in more truth that God had given them God destroyed them and this little part right here really makes me to to understand God's nature a little bit more now that's not just good enough to start the race with God hey Ben but Jesus's own words as he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved now between the time you start and the time that it ends guarantee God's going to give you more truth to walk in he is not going to let you sit around and and just hang on to Jesus went to Calvary and paid the price for you and that's all you got to think about no God has something more in mind for you and he promised when he knew that her carnal nature couldn't take it has how many face to set up to you but you can't bear it now but after the Holy Ghost comes upon you he will lead and guide you into what all true all true so we need a hunger for all the truth there is a continuing on that God requires of every believer God wants an unconditional surrender from us he's not interested in man's surrendering with a condition means I could talk to you just a second most of you have heard about my carnal agreement that I had with the Lord when I before I gave my heart to God I told God that I would give my heart to him under one condition that he would he would give me Cheryl it was a condition of surrender and I'm so glad that God didn't allow that to happen before I made a decision I am NOT gonna marry Cheryl or do anything until God tells me and I gave my heart to Jesus Christ an unconditional surrender and then it isn't like we can call the shots with God you know it isn't like we have more men then we got 20,000 he's already got ten and isn't like we've got more power than him Luke chapter 14 verse 25 just kind of going back to her or opening scripture here a little bit before now take a look at this just painting the picture here there was a great multitude of people with him multitudes what multitude is 2,000 and there were multitude so there is a quite a great multitude with him almost like might say a Coliseum maybe in some auditorium like a ballpark or an arena or some baseball football there just a lot of people with him and instead of just trying to get them all to just you know you boys just follow me you just you know everything's going to be okay the Bible says in verse six that he turned to them and he said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yay and his old life he cannot be my disciple Wow now these are scriptures that are not often read in churches I'm just being guarantee of that you know Jesus wasn't afraid that the majority of the multitude would leave because of only having a natural understanding their carnal understanding of that but I just want you to see in the scripture God wants us to totally surrender our greatest love unconditionally over to him over to the will of God he doesn't want us to put anything before God even our own lives and we know him this time that we're living in that men are in love with themselves they're so in love with themselves but we have to surrender it over to him or we can't even be his disciple now we can be our own claimed disciple of Jesus but he won't claim you and to be honest with you I can't force myself to go in the rapture ain't bigger than him he's the one that's going to have to claim me verse 27 and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me he cannot be my disciple say you can't love anybody not even your family of god you can't love your life and on top of it you got to bear your cross before you can even even come after God or else you cannot be his disciple think about it most jesus bear the cross alone no was it just Calvary here Jesus is talking about the cross that we need to carry now that word bear means to live to carry up to take up to endure declare sustain or to receive so we need to to lift up and bear that cross that word cross figuratively it is a stake a post a pole but what it really represents is an exposure to death that is self-denial example that is the atonement of Christ where Jesus he gave the ultimate gave his own life he died physically for you and now we have to die out calmly for him he wants us to die out currently for him we have to deny our will to do what we want to do just in order to surrender to him it's not a physical death but death to yourself to the ruling of your heart and of your will and of your life most jesus bear the cross alone sounds like jesus is requiring more than himself to bear cross here we've got to we've got to by our own will surrender our self to the Lord Jesus Christ by our own will pick up the cross and follow him by our own choosing suffer by not giving our own flesh what we want and then we can follow him and fulfill his purpose when I was at Home Depot there was someone standing in line as I was picking up some Shepherd hooks for well my wife who had a few extra baskets of flowers that she wanted hung and the person that was standing in front of me had a t-shirt on and on the back of that t-shirt it said I'm and I'm an American by birth but I'm a patriot by choice so in other words he was born in a a country that fought for liberty and somebody had thought about the future and they fought for that Liberty and so he was born into the the blessings of the Liberty that this nation has but he is declaring that he's making a choice about wanting to support and defend this country as a patron now we were born into this world we didn't even know that Jesus died for us 2,000 years ago so we were born with this knowledge that for God so loved us that He gave His only begotten Son I tell you there's a lot of Christians out there are a lot of believers out there I should say that a real that are not real patriarchs that really don't defend the gospel that don't support the gospel who are not willing to pick up the cross that Jesus gave them and to follow him not allowed to say today you are children of the patriarch Abraham Amen we're Patriots for God we're ambassadors for Christ amen and he's called us to pick up the cross to follow him not some fun easy way to be a Christian that isn't the story that Jesus painted for us now that's the story that the most subtle beasts painted for Eve still painting it today in fact is so nice of a painting that kicked Jesus out of the church and they're having church their way the fun way with entertainment and the lights and the joking and everything so fun but they're ready they're ready not a patriot for the gospel amen they're trying to pick and choose what they want to take out of the scriptures and it's a it's a conditional surrender to God and still saying their surrender their life to God but it's conditional god help us just surrender all that we have now Jesus takes this important statement he begins to teach us he leaves us with a better understanding that it's not he that starts the race but he that finishes it here in verse 28 for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counted the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it less happily after you have laid the foundation he's not able to finish it and all that behold it began to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish if we don't finish building what we started with God we will be the ones that are being mocked galatians chapter 6 verse 7 be not deceived God is not mocked for who serve for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to the flesh shall weep to the flesh reap to the flesh but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap everlasting life amen we gotta keep sowing to the spear and I know it's how are we got to keep denying the flesh but the Bible says in verse 9 and let us not be weary in well-doing for a new season we shall reap if we faint not now remember going to and I was going to church in Selene I remember driving by and seen a house that had started to get built and never really finished I just year after year to go by and the house was still there and I began to wonder this man started with a purpose to invest this money put all this labor but he didn't have enough to finish it I thought you know so sad kind of like me with the water fall out there you know he started about I haven't finished it and a lot of Christians a lot of believers when they come to Christ are interested in making sure their their sins are forgiven they just want God cleanse me I believe in the blood of justification not realizing it's not about finding a way to get rid of your sins that's not what it's about God is interested in a relationship he wants to build his church in you he wants to build you up to the statue of a prevent he launched his character in you and that requires a lot of building a lot of labor you got to finish what started amen God hasn't expected end for us amen amen we got to keep going we got to sit down and consider what is going to cost us to see if we have what it takes to be a real disciple of Christ that's what he's ready here do we have enough to be a real disciple it ain't good enough to be self-proclaimed a lot of people they self-proclaim like crazy what they are in other words to a real believer all you have to do is look at the life look at the fruit and you you know all right let's continue on Luke 14 verse 31 as waiting for an to finish her knows but she is writing away this morning or what King got to make war against another king in sitteth not down first and consulted whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him they cometh against him what twenty thousand or while or else while the other is yet afar a great way off he sent us an ambassadors in desiring conditions of peace I think Japan should have considered that before they entered the war he should have sat down and considered it and it goes to show you how a lot of times human nature can be deceived believers can be deceived we cannot overcome the power of God's will with our feeble animalistic self-centered will of ours he's got what it takes to annihilate us to smithereens he's got an atomic bomb that can blow us out of the bits and that's his word and his word declares that we need to unconditionally surrender our will to his well he's a great way off we better humbly approach him with a desire for a peaceable condition nothing short of an unconditional surrender will God accept nothing first 33 so likewise who soever he be of you that for saketh not all that he have he cannot be my disciple all of our will all of our desire it sounds like to me that God is requiring an unconditional surrender and if we truly believe the scriptures that testify of Jesus we can see clearly what it means to believe if we understand the gift that God gave at Calvary he didn't have to come down and provide a way for the Holy Ghost to come upon us that was freely given but just because he went to Calvary doesn't mean the whole world's going free Jesus concludes here typing our condition our condition our conditional surrender with salt that was good at the beginning but later it lost and became useless to God salt is good but if the salt have lost his Savior where what shall be salted it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that have ears let him hear Jesus not telling us a little story about some men that just tossed some salt out the dent wasn't working anymore God has no use for a conditional surrender either did the US with the Japanese and that's what was written there unconditional surrender to many believers surrender their lives to God conditionally they just don't realize it until later when God tells them to do more than they thought at the beginning they begin to rationalize what's important do I really have to do this I mean as long as I do this this is more important this can slide and they begin to develop this mindset that they've got to be intelligent and smart enough to figure out what they have to do what they don't have to do and just being so humble just to surrender everything to God if the Cross requires too much suffering for them too much humility too much laying down their lives too much repenting then they put a condition in it while holding on that they're still bribed that's the spirit that can creep around in the message I'm so special that I don't need to surrender everything because I'm still bright I'd like to read a quote for the message the day on Calvary I want to recommend everybody get this quote and study it it was preached in 1960 all 925 so it'd be September 25th that day in Calvary I want you to listen carefully to this quote look what that day on Calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow red like crimson white like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior your sins are forgiven anything is forgiven is remitted and forgotten about its it's a done deal praise praise God Calvary paid the price amen but look what he says then what does it do he says what does it do what do you mean what does it do it paid the price for all all my sins no it don't stop there what does it do he asked the question it gives up after that condition his spirit to follow him and to do as he did for others who is following on see if you follow on your gonna be his disciple now you're gonna do as he did he was just one man the perfect man He gave His life and he made an example for you now what must we do another question so he's he's preparing us now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself that's forsaking all his life was spent for others no brother and laying that foundation this is what we need to be doing that's perfectly eternal life brother and says now I know y'all got jobs you all got free time and we all need a wind down kind of like clear out our heads but we can take that so far that they become excuses of living for others and I'll tell you sure we all know each our life isn't froze but we need a revelation of what that really means just like we need a revelation of what it means to to forsake all you know it's gotten so carnal that people think living for other sisters doing things for people when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but if you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life now there is no way in the world I could ever say those words but you know what the Prophet did and he's he's the seer of God it's this message that breaks down what the word says this is so important for all of us st. to really really check where is our desires are we are we making excuses for everything that we're doing with our time is there a burden do we even have a burden to see Souls saved are we just thinking about what my job is in in the future I mean for a man of God for the Prophet to tell me that if I am living for myself that I don't have eternal life nothing about well all you got to do is believe I mean sure the Prophet said that sure he courted those same scriptures but what does it really mean to believe what is it really mean to forsake all if you forsake everything you're no longer living for yourself you're living for there is nothing else to live for if you're not living for yourself but when you live life when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when you come to the Lamb of God in other words we too have to lay down our lives someone said how can you stand brother Brandon let anybody call you such bad names he said you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man now how you're gonna redeem that man Alice Christ gonna better be seen if you don't allow that evil to come up in your life and be spoken about you that's when there's an opera it's wrong but then there's the opportunity for the life of Christ to to come forth the love of God to redeem that man but if you're just judging oh that's wrong I ain't gonna talk to you anymore I'm cutting you off what is that let me enter like that's a humanistic animal nature but the random said you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons amen and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten they were sons oh they don't they don't mind saying oh yeah I was the Son of God even when I was in sin I was a seed of God they don't mind saying I'm Brian no matter what but they forgot to live like a son they forget to conduct themselves that they have someone follow the other side he's the king of kings in the Lord of lords we don't want to forget we're supposed to act like a son we're a son he said brother and says you're taking Christ place as a son your son so don't live for yourself live for others sons of God live for others what is that saying what are you saying you're being pretty strong pretty bold well hey I'm not here telling who's in and who's out what I am trying to do is draw your attention to this word and then this unconditional surrender that the Lord Jesus wants from your life and it would behoove us to take time to sit down and consider the call us what God is wanting out of our lives instead of just when church is over we just go ahead and do the same old thing let the Holy Ghost speak to you hey man heart not your heart is in the day for let the Holy Ghost squeeze your heart and cause you to surrender more of yourself to God things can creep into our life Saints it's not about proving who's holier than now it's about laying down your life and not even being anything in this kind of other people just give yourself your Son of God do you live for others amen he said you look on towards Calvary as your son you're looking to Calvary in other words Jesus laid down his life I'm a son of God I have to lay down my life it's a different understanding than what most churches teach no listen these words he says I hope this helps you to get in a place in other words brother I am speaking here they're not in place he's wanting this to get them in place that's what the tabernacle that's what all people has got to do is find out what you are and what's the purpose don't just say I'm the child of God don't just keep you know claiming you're a child just to have that feeling of being a child but now come to maturity with that being a child become manifested when I was a child I put away childish things but when I became a man I acted like a man I began to to love like my father a man the love that endures all things amen the love of God that covers things that that loves us said to me and because we were his child and we're maturing that's who we are Church isn't going to church just to play music just to sing songs church is a place were correction judgment begins at the house of God brother Brad says we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ then he made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves for his service you know we can't do that in our flesh though but why I'll tell you what the Holy Ghost is in you to do the same thing you did when it was in Jesus surrendered his will to the Father he said if we follow him we lead the life that he lived if we follow him we lead the life that live that's wonderfully exactly what Jesus said when he was telling us no man can come after him unless we pick up our cross lay down our life deny our will and then we follow him we lead the same life that he led us exactly what the Prophet was saying Luke chapter chapter 9 verse 22 I just like try to go through this real quick I know we're getting down here Luke chapter 9 verse 22 and the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected to the outers in the chief priests and the scribes and be slain and be raised again the third day in verse 23 and now notice this is not a different subject but he's he's teaching his disciples that as he suffered they're gonna have to suffer that's what he's teaching them and he tells them that you're not gonna be able to follow him unless you do and he said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross on a daily basis and follow me that's an unconditional surrender right there that's what it means to unconditionally surrender your life to Jesus Christ your will every day for whoever will save his life shall lose it that's what happens it's Japan they tried to save their life they lost it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it I tell you I think Japan would have been annihilated they had more bombs hey you you already kept blowing them up but you know what they sought to lose their life that they might save and we have Japan today the way to save your soul to save yourself is to lose your will to God just surrender unconditionally over to him for what is a man advantage if he gain the whole world lose himself be a castaway for whosoever shall be ashamed of me in my words of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and his father's and the Holy Angels we don't want to be ashamed of this word this word that we heard today about unconditionally surrender is that a popular subject but I'm going to tell you it's not about going to church and here hearing a popular subject or hearing something that's that we enjoy hearing more I guess my whole heart from ever ever ever preach earnest never left me has never been about helping people to feel more comfortable because I thought there was a problem with the ministry not making people feel comfortable it's not that I'm not worried about what I look like how much I fail I'm not concerned about how many people would want to listen to me honestly but when I stand before the Lord in the midst of all my failures I know the heart of God wants a relationship with every one of you and I feel like I'm at the defense and the support of helping that relationship be developed by sharing the heart of God with you and not let the enemy trip you up to make you think well Calvary done you did law we're pretty well set we can just go on and live our lives no God has a greater purpose for you than that and we got to die out before that purpose can be fulfilled turn with me to Psalms 23 now so often I've been to many funerals in my life and the psalm is often read referring to a natural death and that it's it's like a it's like a tunnel that we go through to the other side doesn't work but I really believe with all my heart not to do anything against that but I really believe that this is this Psalm is for those who go through a spiritual death does this this means everything to the believer who's living and is going through self-denial and and the crucifying of his flesh look at the very first verse the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want well you think we're gonna have to worry about that one or on the other side after we die this is the first thing that we're going through in our self crucifixion our self-denial Paul said I've learned whatever stayed on their wit to be contempt so the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I forfeited my will to God's he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still one he restoreth that's how our soul gets restored a man our soul never be restored by going to church and figuring out God learning all the mysteries of what the Prophet meant here and coming in here and getting all this knowledge your soul will never get restored with that you need to die out you need to let the Holy Ghost come in and have its way let him lead you beside the still waters let him lay it down in green pastures let him lead you in paths of righteousness for his name's sake he's trying to restore your soul that's the reason that is the reason we have to die out that's the importance of it though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll tell you another thing about this your your soul don't get restored when you die the tree falls that's the way lies this is for the spiritual death yea though I walk through the valley of the show it doesn't seem like that when you got to give up your will just like you feel like you're you're dying out to what you wanted to but look at the faith the relationship that David had with God I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me do you know it's not only we need God's Word to lean upon but we need the rod of Correction - that gets us in line it's all love don't let your mind be carnal and try it you think that the preachers trying to force you in a tube to make you try to do something you don't want to do no we got a surrender willingly to God an unconditional surrender and when you surrender and you're not wanting your you're walking through a valley of shadow death and fears all around you but you know what I will fear no evil look what he says here they'll prepare us a table before me in the presence of my enemies you know when you begin to die out you recognize who your enemy is it becomes more aware that the enemy is right here inside of you and God begins to prepare a table right inside of your heart a man the Word of God becomes open and fresh and real to you and the devil can't do nothing about it amen right in the presence of the enemy God comes in and he noise your head with oil and get your cup to run over he gives you spiritual food in due season amen and look at this surely goodness and mercy shall follow me amen all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and then if you continue to walk a self Crucified life every single day I can say of a surety surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life amen God will bless you God will be your strength God will be your portion he will be your buckler he will be the answer to every situation he will be your peace and then because you've set your love upon him he will deliver you amen right in the presence of your enemies this very important topic of just surrendering unconditionally to the Lord Jesus Christ may God bless you today and may God bless you tomorrow and each day that this word unfolds more and more to you such a small simple topic but yet so deep and so important God he's still calling us for an unconditional surrender even as he did the first day that he called you let him have his way as you surrender your will and your heart over to him amen let's stand together so how much does God expect out of me an unconditional surrender just sign on the dotted line he wants you he's he's calling you for a purpose greater than where we're at today I can say that of her shirt and God is always not just pulling us higher but he has an higher expectation out of us and so often we forget the real important subject of just surrendering surrendering that God's character can be Memphis that his love his peace his joy so he laid our life and let the whole world know that Jesus is alive in us amen amen let's just bow our hearts in a word of Prayer our dear gracious father we thank you for Calvary thank you for loving us when we didn't know you we didn't care about you in fact we acted so against you we were aliens but you for the joy that was set before you you endured the cross you endured the suffering and it was so real that you wanted the cup to pass from you but he surrendered unconditionally to the Father and not my will but thine be done and today Lord the book has been open our ears have heard what the Spirit is saying to us the church that you're calling us for that same unconditional surrender back to you to pick up our cross to follow you to deny our will Lord I pray for every believer for every heart perhaps there be some listening today they think you know I don't know if I can do this I don't know if I can give much more than I'm giving I don't know if it'll make a difference scare that they won't gotta fall through if they make a commitment today lord I pray that you would let them know as they take a step in walking through that valley of the shadow death that there'd be such a faith in their heart they would fear no evil you are our refuge you are our hiding place you are that rock in a weary land weak we have your rod and your staff for us in this journey to help us along the way you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us as we're walking Lord were comforted today by the Word of God no Lord this is hard for each and every one of us Lord myself being so challenged so challenged in my life God I'm praying give me grace to live it today
