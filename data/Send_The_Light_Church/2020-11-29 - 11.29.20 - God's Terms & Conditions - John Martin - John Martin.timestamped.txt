[0:00] it's just words
[0:01] right and uh there's something about
[0:05] words without
[0:06] heart it's just doesn't go very far amen
[0:10] but when you can put your heart into the
[0:12] things that you say it warms your heart
[0:16] person that's speaking to you you know
[0:18] if they mean it from their heart it just
[0:20] warms you and uh I believe I believe the
[0:24] Lord is pleased when we offer our hearts
[0:27] to the Lord behind the things that we
[0:29] said even said about the Pharisees he
[0:32] said uh they think that they're heard
[0:35] for they're much speaking it isn't isn't
[0:37] the words it's it's their heart that
[0:40] comes behind it and I think that it's a
[0:43] blessing for us to come here today and
[0:45] and have the opportunity that we have to
[0:47] Worship the Lord from the dictates of
[0:50] our heart and know that you know it may
[0:53] not be exactly the way that the person
[0:55] next to us is worshiping but God sees
[0:57] her heart and and that he's pleased with
[1:01] our love for him amen amen well God
[1:04] bless you turn with me if you would to
[1:06] the book of St Mark chapter 10 want to
[1:10] say it's really good to see sister hope
[1:12] amen God bless you Sister It's been a uh
[1:18] hard test and trials all the way around
[1:22] but um in in
[1:25] reality uh all of us go through tests
[1:28] and trials
[1:30] and uh sometimes the hardest one is the
[1:33] beginning when you first make your
[1:35] commitment to the lord the devil does
[1:38] everything he can to stand in that way I
[1:41] want to say it's good to see everyone
[1:43] here today God bless you we're we're
[1:46] missing uh so many and we wish that you
[1:50] could be here and pray that God would
[1:53] bless you there just as much as he could
[1:57] here amen pray that all of us are just
[2:01] in the spirit because uh it's God that
[2:04] speaks to us and not not brother John
[2:07] amen we're looking to the Lord let's
[2:09] just read just one verse of scripture
[2:11] we'll have a word of prayer and then
[2:12] have you be seated Mark chapter 10 just
[2:16] verse 21 this is the story of the Rich
[2:18] Young
[2:20] Ruler uh who come to the Lord and and
[2:25] wanted to uh have eternal life like
[2:29] every other human being does not want to
[2:32] die but wants to live forever and he
[2:34] went through his life and he did the
[2:37] things that he thought he needed to do
[2:39] but there was still something inside of
[2:41] him that was questioning and that's what
[2:44] made him
[2:45] ask uh Lord what can I do to to inherit
[2:49] eternal life and he said in verse 21
[2:53] Jesus beholding him loved him and said
[2:55] unto him one thing thou lackest
[3:00] go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and
[3:05] give it to the
[3:06] poor and thou shal have treasure in
[3:09] heaven and come take up thy
[3:14] cross and follow me amen let's look to
[3:18] the author of the scripture in prayer
[3:20] Heavenly Father we've read Thy word
[3:22] which were not even worthy to look upon
[3:25] it but you said blessed are your eyes if
[3:28] if you just read it
[3:30] but Lord you also gave a special
[3:32] blessing to those that understand and we
[3:35] pray that the Holy Ghost would come and
[3:37] give us the understanding Lord of not
[3:39] only the scripture but all the
[3:41] scriptures that we'd read today Lord the
[3:43] very subject that you have for us we
[3:45] pray that you would become so real to
[3:48] every one of our hearts that we could
[3:49] just look beyond the Flesh and and and
[3:52] ignore the things of the the past or or
[3:56] anything that the enemy would try to put
[3:58] into our minds and help us just to
[4:00] connect with you this morning and
[4:02] receive from you the things that we have
[4:03] need of Lord we commit this service now
[4:06] to you we give you the praise and honor
[4:08] for all that you will do but we ask it
[4:10] in Jesus name amen God bless you may be
[4:13] seated
[4:15] today we want to en tile this message
[4:19] terms God's terms and
[4:22] conditions God's terms and conditions
[4:25] and for a subject paying attention to
[4:27] the fine print
[4:30] often times when we do certain contracts
[4:34] uh renting mortgages purchasing cars
[4:38] getting
[4:39] insurances uh especially
[4:41] insurances um if you don't pay attention
[4:44] to the fine print you can come up
[4:47] disappointed and uh even in this great
[4:50] subject that of uh our relationship with
[4:52] God and getting eternal life um there's
[4:56] a lot of people that did we know that
[4:59] will not look at the fine print and in
[5:02] the day of judgment many will come to
[5:04] him and say Lord Lord did not we do this
[5:06] and this and
[5:08] this and he will say unto
[5:10] them uh you didn't look at the fine
[5:16] print it wasn't just this and this and
[5:19] this it's it's everything we got to look
[5:22] at the the fine print and say this
[5:26] morning where would we be without the
[5:28] Forgiveness of God in our Liv
[5:31] we'd be lost be lost in this world think
[5:34] about all the people that don't that you
[5:36] know that don't know God and they don't
[5:38] know where to go what to do their lives
[5:40] are in turmoil they're mixed up or
[5:43] they're just deceived thinking that
[5:45] they're right the world is falling apart
[5:49] people are being let us LED astray
[5:51] they're they're like sheep without a
[5:53] shepher they they don't know where to go
[5:56] or what to
[5:57] do and when we get Down On Our Knees to
[6:00] humbly ask God to forgive
[6:03] us we look to
[6:07] Calvary we look to the the blood of the
[6:10] Lamb that Supreme sacrifice and we give
[6:13] thanks and praise to God because we know
[6:16] that we're we're Unworthy of the mercies
[6:19] of
[6:20] God so I say Amen where would we be
[6:23] without the Forgiveness of God today
[6:25] even this day the sins that we sinned
[6:29] yesterday
[6:30] yesterday if we would not be forgiven
[6:33] today where would we
[6:34] be but there are many times that God's
[6:38] mercy and forgiveness doesn't come easy
[6:42] in fact we may not realize it but there
[6:45] are many scriptures and conditions that
[6:48] God
[6:49] has Clauses in the scriptures even for
[6:53] his forgiveness and let's just look at
[6:55] one of them today it's in Mark 11: 25
[7:00] Mark 11:25 and I just want you to I want
[7:03] you to to focus in on things that we may
[7:08] Overlook in the scriptures when we think
[7:11] about God and his love and all the
[7:13] things that that God has towards us
[7:16] because a lot of
[7:18] times um these things that we're going
[7:21] to be talking about um are the things
[7:24] that disappoint us because if you you
[7:26] talk about those terms and conditions
[7:29] and you find out the insurance policy
[7:31] didn't work because uh because of this
[7:34] fine print here and usually it's the
[7:36] fine print that disappoints you I wish I
[7:40] would have known I would have never ever
[7:42] tried this
[7:44] hamburger I would have never bought this
[7:47] car I would have never got this
[7:49] insurance I would have never married
[7:53] you why didn't you tell me the fine
[7:58] print all right Mark 11:25 and when you
[8:02] stand praying
[8:04] forgive if you have ought against any
[8:07] that your father also which is in heaven
[8:09] May forgive you of your
[8:11] trespasses but if here's the fine print
[8:15] but if you do not forgive neither will
[8:18] your heavenly Father which is in heaven
[8:19] forgive your trespasses so it's not as
[8:22] easy as just you know Lord forgive me I
[8:25] the I I plead the blood but there's
[8:29] there's also more that God is expecting
[8:32] of us the condition of forgiveness isn't
[8:35] just asking God to forgive you or the
[8:38] blood automatically covers you or atones
[8:40] you or that Christ already died for you
[8:43] and already paid the price for your
[8:45] debts Jesus gave a condition of
[8:48] forgiveness that we have to be like God
[8:52] he wants us to be like him and that is
[8:54] about to forgive others think about that
[8:57] we want God to forgive us he's not look
[8:59] at us and says I want you to be like me
[9:01] you learn to forgive as well God is is
[9:05] Shifting our thoughts into a more mature
[9:07] way of looking at things away from a
[9:11] selfishness into a a a maturity
[9:15] amen Matthew chapter 6
[9:18] ver14 Matthew chapter 6 ver14 for if ye
[9:21] forgive men their trespasses your
[9:23] heavenly father will also forgive you
[9:26] forgive you but if you forgive not men
[9:28] the trespasses neither will your father
[9:30] forgive your
[9:32] trespasses and uh if you're
[9:36] human you're we have
[9:39] trespasses if you're human if there's
[9:42] angels in here which we know there's
[9:43] angels in here we can't see him well uh
[9:47] at
[9:47] least the the angels that have not
[9:50] Fallen they have not
[9:52] trespassed but the fallen angels that
[9:54] are here they've trespassed and they're
[9:57] trying to get us to doubt the word to
[10:00] doubt what's being
[10:03] preached most of the time that we're
[10:05] seeking forgiveness from God our focus
[10:08] is on his Mercy right because we're
[10:11] looking for God to have mercy on us
[10:13] because we've sinned we've come short
[10:15] but God's focus is on our character he's
[10:18] not just interested in us being forgiven
[10:20] he's interested in being able to have
[10:23] the character to forgive others that's
[10:25] where his focus is at so he's he's
[10:28] Shifting the way way that we think
[10:31] towards the way that he thinks
[10:33] amen too often our attention is drawn to
[10:35] what we need or what we want from God
[10:38] and God's continuously drawing our
[10:40] attention to what he wants us to do and
[10:43] sometimes it's
[10:44] first and we need to remember that so A
[10:47] lot of times when we come to the Lord
[10:49] and just God I need your forgiveness we
[10:51] need to to shift from just God forgiven
[10:54] me to what is it that you want me to
[10:57] do remember his thoughts are higher than
[11:00] our thoughts his ways are higher than
[11:02] our ways we enjoy talking about how
[11:06] great God's love
[11:10] is we enjoy talking about his Rich
[11:14] mercies that that it rote our life and
[11:17] his Amazing Grace yet the conditions
[11:20] that God wants us to think
[11:24] about are the things that need to to
[11:28] trans Inspire our Our Lives into
[11:31] becoming more into his
[11:33] character and we don't want to forget
[11:35] those because we'll come
[11:37] short we realize that there's no
[11:40] condemnation now to them that walk in
[11:42] Christ Jesus right there's no
[11:44] condemnation to them that that walk in
[11:46] the spirit and not in the flesh but you
[11:49] know we do still walk in the
[11:52] flesh so that means condemnation can
[11:56] come and and and we don't realize
[11:59] it people like to to view God in a way
[12:03] that God is always happy with
[12:06] them they're doing a great job there
[12:09] isn't really much more that they could
[12:12] do they're really passing all the test
[12:15] so any gospel that's preached different
[12:18] than this way of thinking will keep a
[12:22] person from the ability to receive
[12:27] something from God
[12:30] I hope you're catching what I'm
[12:33] saying we all want to view God as God is
[12:37] happy with us because any view other
[12:40] than that makes us feel bad makes us
[12:42] feel uh immaturely convicted immaturely
[12:48] condemned but we don't want to feel that
[12:50] we want to feel that God's happy with us
[12:52] I I I came to church today God ought to
[12:54] be happy with me I ask God to forgiven
[12:57] he ought to be happy with me
[13:00] but there's many things that God has to
[13:02] tell
[13:04] us and we we don't want a relationship
[13:07] that's just I only want to carve out
[13:09] this part of
[13:11] God you know we we got to take them we
[13:14] got to marriages hook lion Sinker take
[13:18] the good with the bad the bad with the
[13:19] good if I could say it like
[13:22] that and uh we may view God in a way
[13:25] that's got bad when he's wanting us to
[13:28] crucify our
[13:31] flesh the problem was never with what
[13:34] Jesus
[13:35] preached it was the problem with how
[13:38] people re perceived what he preached the
[13:41] problem was with the attitude The View
[13:44] that they had about what Jesus preached
[13:46] and and so it is
[13:50] today it's not the
[13:52] word it just people want a different
[13:55] word
[13:59] that will not help us grow in the Lord
[14:01] it may make us feel better we may enjoy
[14:04] it more our flesh
[14:07] may want it more but it will not help
[14:11] our
[14:13] character God is continuously trying to
[14:16] shift our attention to view things the
[14:19] way that Christ viewed things to to have
[14:23] let this mind that was in Christ be in
[14:26] you be ye transformed by the renewing of
[14:28] your mind
[14:30] so God is is is is trying to make us
[14:33] think like God thinks to see things the
[14:36] way God sees things and we can't come
[14:39] into church with preconceived ideas
[14:42] about God or how God views us or looks
[14:44] at us or what he wants for our life we
[14:47] need to place oursel in a neutral
[14:49] position and let let God begin to speak
[14:52] to our hearts amen so as we grow in the
[14:55] Lord a way of thinking continues to grow
[14:57] as well first Corin Ians chap 13 verse
[15:00] 11 says when I was a child I spake as a
[15:03] child I understood as a child I thought
[15:07] as a child but when I grew
[15:11] up I put away those childish way of
[15:16] thinking and and and we've got to be
[15:18] strong enough to do that we can't hang
[15:19] on to them nobody can put those away
[15:23] from you you've got to be the one
[15:25] willing to put away childish
[15:27] thoughts it's same thing for a Believer
[15:30] as he matures in the Lord he has to put
[15:33] away those childish things those well he
[15:35] didn't shake his my hand he didn't smile
[15:38] at me he didn't he didn't make me feel
[15:40] good he didn't it is nothing about that
[15:43] put away those things
[15:46] amen God expects us to put away childish
[15:50] selfish
[15:53] behaviors and to put on the behavior of
[15:56] living for others loving others laying
[15:58] down your life for others amen many are
[16:02] areas of our life if how could say it
[16:04] like that amen Jesus said in St John
[16:07] chapter 16:12 I've quoted it many times
[16:10] but as we're talking about these terms
[16:11] and conditions I want to repeat it again
[16:14] I have yet many things to say unto you
[16:16] but you cannot
[16:18] bear them now bear that word bear means
[16:21] to
[16:22] carry to pick it
[16:24] up in other words the word is spoken but
[16:27] you just leave it there
[16:30] like water off a duck's back you just
[16:32] okay get on to the next thing that's not
[16:34] what I come to church for that's not
[16:36] what I'm looking for
[16:39] right how be it when he the spirit of
[16:42] Truth has come he will guide you in all
[16:44] truth he will not speak of
[16:46] himself amen but whatsoever you shall
[16:49] hear that shall he speak and he show you
[16:51] things to come so when the Holy Spirit
[16:54] is in our life and is around us and I'm
[16:56] telling you I believe the holy spirit is
[16:59] by you today where you're sitting I
[17:01] believe that with all my heart he's
[17:03] wanting you to pick up the word to car
[17:06] and and carry it with you out of here
[17:08] and make it part of your life don't
[17:10] leave it
[17:12] here remember what God has said I have
[17:15] yet many things to say unto you the
[17:18] things that are in God's mind the things
[17:21] that are already in God's mind but the
[17:24] question is can we pick up the word
[17:26] that's presented to us
[17:29] can we walk in more of his will or are
[17:33] we going to get
[17:34] offended is it too hard to carry the
[17:38] responsibility of laying down your
[17:43] life the responsibility of forgiveness
[17:46] we just read about it we all want
[17:48] forgiveness but can we carry the
[17:49] responsibility of forgiving
[17:52] others right or are we going to talk
[17:54] about it you know it's so easy to talk
[17:57] about somebody else who's done wrong but
[17:59] where's the person who quickly covers
[18:01] who forgives who's exercising
[18:04] Christ amen because this is a
[18:07] responsibility it's a responsibility to
[18:10] be merciful to somebody Amen to to reach
[18:14] out to the for Souls it's a
[18:16] responsibility you got to pick up that
[18:18] word right you got to carry
[18:21] that we don't want to make the gospel
[18:23] private in other words this is The
[18:25] Gospel according to John Martin I want
[18:28] this and I want this and I want a
[18:30] Cadillac and I want this and whatever I
[18:32] ask in his name
[18:35] and I can make it whatever I want to
[18:37] make it but that would be my gospel and
[18:40] that would be my private relationship
[18:42] and at the end I'm going to end up
[18:44] saying Lord Lord did not I do this in
[18:46] the
[18:48] end I never knew you I never knew you
[18:52] because I had many things to say to you
[18:54] but you couldn't pick it
[18:55] up when I gave it to you when I showed
[18:58] it to you you didn't say I'm goingon to
[19:00] make it part of my
[19:02] life Hebrews chapter 5 verse 11 Hebrews
[19:06] chapter 5 verse 11 of whom we have many
[19:09] things to
[19:11] say many you ever come to church and say
[19:14] well this is the same old same
[19:21] old God has many things to
[19:24] say and hard to be
[19:27] uttered seeing you're dull of
[19:31] hearing hard to be uttered did you ever
[19:34] have to say something to somebody but
[19:36] you knew it was going to be hard to say
[19:38] it because they you knew they were going
[19:41] to have a hard time taking
[19:44] it you could just say it like it is but
[19:47] that ain't going to work so you try to
[19:49] say it in such a way that they can take
[19:52] it so you're you're searching for the
[19:54] words and you're for the opportunity and
[19:56] and just the right way to bring it in
[19:59] it's hard to be uttered sometimes God is
[20:02] trying to get his word across but it's
[20:04] hard to utter it to us because of our
[20:09] condition because of our
[20:11] attitude seeing you are dull of hearing
[20:16] now that word dull it means
[20:19] sluggish
[20:21] lazy
[20:24] slothful it's just too hard to carry
[20:26] that word
[20:29] too
[20:30] hard too hard to
[20:34] try
[20:36] look there is nothing greater than the
[20:40] word of God the truth of God there is
[20:43] nothing greater on the planet than the
[20:46] word of
[20:48] God we are the Most Blessed people on
[20:52] the
[20:54] planet we've even been introduced to the
[20:57] messenger that God sent sent to get a
[20:59] bride ready we are blessed to have the
[21:03] understanding of the scriptures we are
[21:06] blessed why would we take the attitude
[21:10] of being dull of hearing yeah I heard
[21:12] you but you know
[21:15] whatever you're turning down
[21:20] Christ you're not turning down the
[21:22] person that's telling
[21:24] you you're turning down
[21:26] Christ verse 12
[21:29] for
[21:30] when for the time he ought to be
[21:34] teachers you've heard this long enough
[21:36] you need to be teaching this to somebody
[21:39] else you have need that one would teach
[21:43] you
[21:44] again which be the first principles of
[21:47] the Oracles of God and are become such
[21:51] you became as such as have need of milk
[21:58] from a
[22:00] bottle and not of strong
[22:04] meat for everyone that useth
[22:07] milk is
[22:09] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[22:13] for he is considered a
[22:17] babe this is not the hour to be
[22:22] satisfied with being a babe
[22:29] this is not the hour it's a dangerous
[22:31] hour that we're living in God is coming
[22:34] for a mature bride without spot without
[22:37] wrinkle there's a maturity she has the
[22:40] character she can lay down her life she
[22:42] can forgive she can be merciful she can
[22:45] love she can reach out for
[22:49] Souls she's
[22:51] mature look strong meat but strong meat
[22:59] that's stable steadfast nourishment if
[23:03] you look that up stable steadfast
[23:07] nourishment belongeth to them that are
[23:10] of full age even those who by reason of
[23:14] use have their senses exercised to
[23:17] discern both good and evil now we
[23:22] know it is evil to kill
[23:26] somebody and it is good
[23:30] to help
[23:32] somebody but can we discern the good and
[23:34] evil that takes place in this between
[23:36] these
[23:39] ears can we discern the good and evil in
[23:41] our life because there are good and evil
[23:44] in our life
[23:45] continuously
[23:47] continuously but Satan wants us to feel
[23:50] that it's always
[23:52] good so therefore we never really
[23:54] exercise it on oursel I just exercise it
[23:56] on my brother Mark I see him make so so
[23:58] many sins that ain't even
[24:02] funny I call them out all the time
[24:05] too you know what he said one more time
[24:08] and I'm
[24:09] leaving you call my sin one more time
[24:12] I'm I'm leaving I'm gonna go find
[24:13] another place to
[24:19] be no he never said
[24:21] that because I never said
[24:24] that
[24:26] but we got to exercise what's going on
[24:29] in
[24:30] here don't wait for somebody to come up
[24:32] to you and say your tie is
[24:35] crooked take a moment look in the mirror
[24:37] see if the ti is
[24:39] crooked come to church I want to hear
[24:42] from you Lord I want you to tell me if
[24:44] my ti is
[24:46] crooked amen that's what it's all
[24:50] about if we're not at full
[24:53] age press into Christ this is not the
[24:56] hour to be laying around
[24:58] Jesus is coming
[25:00] soon now if we're of full age then we
[25:05] need to receive the strong meat of the
[25:13] word that's not just some strong
[25:17] Doctrine that's been laying in the
[25:18] message that we're hoping to hear
[25:20] something that excites
[25:22] us it's learning how to do all of God's
[25:25] will that's what strong meat is
[25:28] brother John you better give me
[25:29] scripture for that one okay okay I will
[25:32] John chapter
[25:34] 4:34 John chapter 4:34 Jesus saith unto
[25:38] them my meat is to do the will of him
[25:43] that sent me and to finish his work now
[25:49] it's one thing to receive instructions
[25:50] from the Lord but you got to answer the
[25:53] question have you finished the
[25:55] work that he gave you to do
[25:59] so what is your meat what meat are you
[26:02] looking
[26:04] for it's to do all not just part of the
[26:06] will of God but we ought to be looking
[26:10] for the part that we're not doing to be
[26:13] finishing the work that he gave us to do
[26:16] we all got meat to do his
[26:19] will I'd like to say I've done it but
[26:22] somehow when I wake up in the in the
[26:24] morning I feel something's missing in my
[26:27] life that there's more I can be doing
[26:29] for the
[26:32] Lord you know we can get so lost into
[26:35] ourself that we don't even have that
[26:36] anymore
[26:38] true many scriptures have conditional
[26:42] Clauses to
[26:43] them that we may not even realize it we
[26:48] may not focus on it we may not even pay
[26:51] attention this morning I want to take a
[26:53] look at some of the the fine print in
[26:55] the Bible if I could we want to allow
[26:57] the the Holy Spirit to shift our
[26:59] thoughts from the way that we're looking
[27:01] at things to another way of
[27:04] thinking how many want to be a friend of
[27:08] Jesus his name is Jesus he'll be your
[27:11] friend he's human as well as Divine oh I
[27:14] want you to know him I want you to meet
[27:17] him this wonderful friend of mine
[27:19] everybody wants to be a friend of
[27:23] Jesus I don't want to be his
[27:26] enemy John chap 15 verse4 you would
[27:30] think it's pretty easy to be a friend of
[27:33] Jesus he said ye are my friends if look
[27:37] at the fine print here if you do the
[27:40] things I command you the fine print here
[27:43] is
[27:45] if we are considered a friend of God if
[27:48] we walk in the things that he's already
[27:52] already told us
[27:56] yesterday what did he tell you yest
[28:02] yesterday don't don't just come to
[28:04] church keep looking for new things when
[28:06] we haven't done the old
[28:08] things amen now the First Command the
[28:13] First Command we're going to talk about
[28:14] commands the first command for any of us
[28:18] is to believe that's the first
[28:21] thing Faith it's through faith that God
[28:24] created everything that we see
[28:27] everything that we don't see all the
[28:29] Angels everything that's transpiring in
[28:31] those other
[28:34] Realms and the first condition that God
[28:37] has set forth for mankind is faith if
[28:40] thou can't believe all things are
[28:43] possible without faith we can't please
[28:45] God the Bible says and he that cometh to
[28:49] God must first believe not be proven
[28:53] must first believe that he is and that
[28:55] he is a rewarder to them that diligently
[28:58] seek him you don't ha God don't have to
[29:00] prove and he will not prove to
[29:05] anybody
[29:07] God he's the one that created gravity
[29:13] molecules everything that's in
[29:17] existence and the only way that God
[29:21] understands that we're stuck here on the
[29:24] earth is through gravity something that
[29:26] God made
[29:29] and so there's scientists and there's
[29:31] people who who seek out to to understand
[29:35] how Brave uh brain waves function and
[29:39] how the heart beats and and and and the
[29:42] nature of animals and and how the tides
[29:46] can go in different directions in the
[29:48] sea and all there's just so much that
[29:51] God is created and it's so wonderful and
[29:54] so beautiful but when it comes to
[29:56] knowing god in a relationship ship God
[29:58] is not going to prove to you
[30:00] scientifically who he is you must
[30:04] believe nothing short of it that's right
[30:07] you'll never know God outside of
[30:11] Faith he that believeth not Jesus
[30:15] said is condemned
[30:18] already because he believeth not in the
[30:21] name of the only begotten son John 8: 24
[30:26] I said therefore unto you John 8:24 that
[30:31] ye shall die in your sins if ye believe
[30:34] not that I am he he shall die in your
[30:40] sins faith is a
[30:43] requirement we can obtain a good report
[30:46] if we exercise things through faith
[30:49] that's what the scripture says the
[30:51] elders obtained a good
[30:53] report by using faith in their
[30:56] life Matthew chapter
[30:58] 17:20 and Jesus said unto them because
[31:01] of your unbelief for verily I say unto
[31:04] you if you have faith as a grain of
[31:06] mustard seed you shall say into this
[31:08] mountain remove hence into Yonder place
[31:10] and it shall be removed and nothing
[31:12] shall be impossible unto
[31:15] you
[31:18] faith it needs to be the the
[31:22] first the middle and the last
[31:26] part right we need perfect faith for a
[31:31] rapture we can't ever do away with faith
[31:34] we can't be we can't get away from that
[31:38] freshness with the
[31:41] Lord faith is what moves your
[31:45] relationship with God
[31:47] forward faith is what moves It
[31:50] Forward when you do not exercise faith
[31:54] when you do not build yourself up in the
[31:56] Most Holy Faith
[31:59] unbelief will move your relationship
[32:01] backwards with
[32:03] God you can become more distant with
[32:08] God when you get to a place when you
[32:11] have to if God don't do this and he
[32:13] don't show you this and he don't prove
[32:16] this when you start getting away from
[32:19] Faith you're starting to get away from
[32:23] God we're living in an age where we need
[32:26] to be earnestly contending for the faith
[32:29] amen that was once delivered to the
[32:31] Saints we need it till we get out of
[32:34] here the first condition that God has
[32:36] set forth for mankind is faith if you
[32:39] believe then you can make a choice to
[32:43] follow the
[32:44] lord Mark 16:16 he that believeth and is
[32:48] baptized shall be saved but he that
[32:52] believeth not shall be
[32:55] damned you got to believe but we got to
[32:58] believe as the scripture says we got to
[32:59] believe all the scriptures right the
[33:02] fine print let's look a little bit more
[33:04] closely into the condition of following
[33:06] the Lord in Luke chapter 9 verse
[33:10] 23 and he said to not just one person
[33:14] not just to
[33:15] you but he said to them all what he says
[33:19] to one he says to all If any man will
[33:23] come after
[33:25] me let him deny himself take up his
[33:29] cross and follow
[33:31] me it's not just believing in being
[33:34] baptized
[33:36] anymore now there's there's some fine
[33:38] print here there's a denying yourself
[33:41] taking up the things that God would ask
[33:44] you to do and sometimes they're
[33:46] suffering they're hurtful we may view it
[33:49] as a
[33:50] cross that's the fine
[33:54] print in our opening scripture Jesus was
[33:57] talking to a a young man who had some
[34:02] some wealth in his life and he also was
[34:06] a man of
[34:08] authority and this young man he had a
[34:11] desire for eternal
[34:13] life
[34:15] enough of a desire that he tried to keep
[34:18] the Commandments of God from his
[34:22] youth but it wasn't
[34:25] enough the conditions
[34:28] he wants and
[34:31] expects is first place in her
[34:35] life how many times have you had a
[34:39] honeydew
[34:40] list and you just wanted to get the list
[34:43] done before things were
[34:47] added how many
[34:49] times did your boss give you a list of
[34:53] things to do and you just wanted to get
[34:56] that list done because it was weighing
[34:58] on
[35:00] you and and often
[35:02] times we just want to do whatever God
[35:06] wants us to do to get it off our
[35:11] back and
[35:13] this young
[35:16] man he was doing the Commandments that
[35:19] God's word asked to do
[35:23] but there was still something left
[35:27] undone in his
[35:29] life this man is a typical example of
[35:32] people wanting to hang on things in
[35:35] their
[35:36] life and not give them
[35:38] up we all have them we sit here today
[35:42] every one of us has little things
[35:44] hanging on that we don't want to give
[35:47] up he had other Desires in his heart
[35:50] that did not include God and those
[35:53] desires will always be the thing that
[35:55] sell you short from from a relationship
[35:57] with God
[35:59] always Mark 10: 21 our opening scripture
[36:03] then Jesus beholding him he loved him
[36:05] and he said unto him one thing thou
[36:12] lackest one thing go thy
[36:18] way sell look at the command now sell
[36:21] whatsoever thou has give it to the poor
[36:24] and thou shalt treasure in heaven now
[36:26] when you get that done come take up your
[36:29] cross and follow
[36:31] me God has terms and conditions one
[36:35] thing thou lackest to me that's a a term
[36:38] and and
[36:40] condition why didn't he say uh you have
[36:44] one additional thing in your life why
[36:46] didn't he say that it' be a true
[36:51] statement because most people
[36:54] feel that they can have something in
[36:57] their life as long as they're doing the
[36:59] things of
[37:01] God people don't realize that that
[37:04] desire that one thing that they're
[37:05] holding on to is the one thing that's
[37:08] keeping God from being first in their
[37:09] life and God wants to be first in their
[37:12] life terms and conditions is that God
[37:14] wants control of our life he just
[37:17] doesn't want to save
[37:20] us it isn't like we're co-equal with
[37:24] God that's what Lucifer wanted co-equal
[37:28] I want to be like him I want to be like
[37:29] the most high
[37:33] co-equal like God's going to do his will
[37:36] and I'm going to do mine
[37:42] co-equal we're born to do the will of
[37:46] God any extra Desires in our life will
[37:50] always be the things that are lacking
[37:53] for God to have complete control of Our
[37:56] Lives if he Lord of everything he's not
[37:59] Lord at all so you want him as your
[38:03] friend I mean how many's how many's
[38:06] really happy that you know somebody that
[38:08] can get you out of a
[38:09] pinch come
[38:11] on oh I got somebody in the police force
[38:14] I got somebody over here I got somebody
[38:16] who's a really good mechanic I got
[38:18] somebody over here I I know this one oh
[38:20] if I ever
[38:22] need yeah that's the way that a lot of
[38:24] people look at
[38:26] Jesus he's the the one that can help me
[38:28] out of this
[38:30] mess talking about
[38:32] relationship we're talking to the
[38:35] bride amen we're we're talking about
[38:38] something
[38:39] greater God would not allow this man to
[38:42] follow Jesus think about it with other
[38:48] desires even though he was coming to
[38:51] church and he kept the Commandments from
[38:53] a
[38:54] youth God would not allow him to follow
[38:58] him
[38:59] even with these other Desires in his
[39:03] life I want you to think about the other
[39:08] desires that are in your
[39:11] life because they could be keeping us
[39:14] from following the
[39:15] Lord come on it's a it's a strong
[39:19] statement Jesus told him to leave go thy
[39:24] way get rid of the desires that I cannot
[39:28] control inside of
[39:30] you and come in other words when you're
[39:36] willing pick up your cross and follow
[39:42] me huge huge fine print to
[39:46] me something that's overlooked by the
[39:49] churches overlooked by the
[39:53] multitudes they don't mind talking about
[39:55] God's love God's mercy what God did for
[39:57] protect him God did this God did that
[39:59] God what about the fine
[40:02] print talk to me about the fine
[40:06] print because when it gets on the other
[40:09] side is any of that going to matter is
[40:13] any of the other going to
[40:17] matter but God you were so good to me
[40:19] you did this and you did this and you
[40:21] did that and you protected me here and
[40:22] you met this need and I never ran out
[40:25] you okay okay okay okay I did but that
[40:27] has nothing to do with our relationship
[40:29] because our relationship is between me
[40:31] and you and I want you to start cough
[40:33] coughing up what you've done for
[40:35] me I want you to start talking to me
[40:38] about what I commanded you to do the
[40:40] fine print in my
[40:43] word because that's what's going to
[40:45] matter on the day of
[40:52] judgment notice as we read it again
[40:54] Jesus has love in his heart for this
[40:58] man he has compassion in his in his
[41:02] heart for this man's
[41:06] Soul yet God's great love couldn't save
[41:10] him against his own will I want you to
[41:13] think about that how great God's love is
[41:16] it's the greatest power on the planet
[41:19] and yet this power was not strong enough
[41:22] to save this man against his own will
[41:28] it's so strong it cannot penetrate
[41:34] self-will you're the only one that can
[41:36] turn that door you're the only
[41:39] one that can open that door of
[41:43] self-will he can knock and he can say I
[41:46] love you John Martin I love you but I've
[41:50] got to be the one to open that
[41:52] door I got to be the one to say Lord
[41:54] come in your will be done not my
[41:58] I'll sell what to have a give to the
[41:59] poor I'll go here I'll go there I'll do
[42:02] this I'll do that whatever
[42:09] Lord think about it God's terms and
[42:13] conditions verse
[42:16] 22 and he was sad at that same and one
[42:20] away
[42:21] grieved for he had great
[42:23] possessions and Jesus looked round about
[42:27] and saith unto his disciples how
[42:29] hardly shall they that have riches enter
[42:32] into the kingdom of God the thing about
[42:34] riches why I believe that this was
[42:36] brought out is because when I have money
[42:38] when we have money we can buy
[42:41] anything money buys any
[42:44] desire buys any
[42:49] desire without money I'm
[42:51] limited to what I can hold on to
[42:57] I
[42:58] mean if I was in love with
[43:02] Planters you know I'd be if I was
[43:04] obsessed with
[43:06] planners that would definitely between
[43:08] be keep me
[43:10] between God my relationship with him
[43:13] because I got lots of planners at my
[43:19] house so just because we don't have
[43:22] money doesn't mean we can't have things
[43:25] that we're holding on to right
[43:28] but when you got money oh it just opens
[43:31] the door for
[43:33] such such
[43:37] desires and the disciples were
[43:39] astonished at his words now this is his
[43:41] own disciples but Jesus anth again and
[43:45] saith unto them children how hard it is
[43:48] for them that trust in riches to enter
[43:52] into the kingdom of God in other words
[43:55] if I've got money
[43:57] I don't
[44:00] need you to help me if
[44:04] anything I don't need to depend on God
[44:07] for where my next meal is
[44:09] coming to help me with this surgery that
[44:13] I need because I got Blue
[44:16] Cross
[44:18] money get you to have what you want so
[44:21] you can't depend so you're not you're
[44:24] not forced to depend on the Lord yeah
[44:28] and God wants us to depend on him so I
[44:31] say it like this if you got money God
[44:33] bless
[44:35] you but live like you don't
[44:39] am Abraham did not flaunt his money
[44:46] right but he was very
[44:52] rich verse 25 it is easier for a camel
[44:56] to go through the eye of a needle than
[44:58] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[45:00] of
[45:01] God and they that and they were
[45:04] astonished out of measure saying among
[45:08] themselves who then is able to be
[45:13] saved and Jesus looking upon them saith
[45:17] with men this is totally
[45:21] impossible but not with God praise
[45:24] praise the Lord for with God God all
[45:28] things are
[45:31] possible and then Peter began to say
[45:34] unto him L we have left all we're now
[45:37] like this guy we've left all and have
[45:40] followed
[45:41] thee now that sounded pretty good at
[45:43] that point but Peter did not realize
[45:47] what was in his
[45:49] heart and a lot of times we don't
[45:53] realize what's in our heart when we have
[45:56] this feeling of all for the
[45:59] Lord how many times you made a decision
[46:02] I'm going to start doing this and you
[46:04] you did not continue to do
[46:12] it that's why we need to press in to the
[46:15] Lord press in for more of the Holy Ghost
[46:18] these terms and conditions gave this
[46:20] young man that were given this man
[46:22] weren't just for
[46:23] him but these these terms and conditions
[46:26] were for all of us Luke 14: 26 If any
[46:31] man come to me and hate not his father
[46:35] mother wife children brethen sister yeah
[46:39] in his own life he cannot be my disciple
[46:43] what a term and condition you know many
[46:46] people are claiming to be a disciple of
[46:48] Christ and they have not put Christ
[46:52] above other people
[46:58] God will only take first place in a
[47:04] relationship and whosoever does not bear
[47:07] his cross and come after me he cannot be
[47:10] my
[47:12] disciple terms and
[47:15] conditions if we want Jesus to pick up
[47:17] pick us as one of his disciples for for
[47:23] 2020 he's got terms and conditions for
[47:25] us too John
[47:28] 8:31 John 8:31 then said Jesus to those
[47:33] Jews which believed on him if you
[47:35] continue in 2020 in my word then are ye
[47:40] my disciples indeed and you shall know
[47:44] the truth and the truth shall make you
[47:47] free now these Jews had already believed
[47:52] on the Lord they already believed in
[47:55] Jesus
[47:57] but Jesus was wanting them to read the
[48:00] fine print the fine print is that God is
[48:05] wanting us to continue in the things
[48:08] that he's going to further show us
[48:11] remember you're my friends if you do
[48:14] whatsoever I command you
[48:17] right if is that little word if you
[48:23] continue in my word in the things which
[48:25] I teach you
[48:27] you shall know the truth the truth shall
[48:29] make you free and then your disciple
[48:33] ready and then your disciple ready we
[48:35] want to
[48:37] claim where we're at with god without
[48:41] the following of the word and our
[48:43] emphasis needs to be on continuing
[48:45] coming to church I'm going to hear
[48:47] something that God wants me to do this
[48:48] week I'm going to try to do
[48:50] it that's really what this should all be
[48:54] about not smer
[48:57] not coming and and just picking what we
[49:00] want and not picking what we don't want
[49:01] and still saying I'm a
[49:05] Christian I'm not trying to make anybody
[49:07] feel bad and I think all of you know
[49:14] that but there's terms and conditions
[49:17] here Hebrews chapter
[49:19] 3:14 Hebrews chap 3:14 for we are made
[49:25] partakers of Christ when we
[49:28] repent and get
[49:31] baptized are you
[49:35] sure for we are made partakers of Christ
[49:38] if terms and conditions if we hold the
[49:43] beginning of our confidence which was
[49:45] when we repented and got
[49:48] baptized if we hold the beginning of our
[49:52] confidence
[49:54] steadfast unto the end
[50:00] so we've got to start we've got to
[50:03] repent we've got to get
[50:06] baptized but it's not over then that's
[50:10] just the beginning you've got to stay
[50:13] steadfast you got to keep going you got
[50:15] to hold that same confidence I remember
[50:17] when I got when I repented and I got
[50:20] baptized that was what I was told what I
[50:23] needed to do to get saved and I knew I
[50:25] was lost and wanted salvation and my
[50:28] confidence was when I got done doing
[50:30] this I was going to be set free and I
[50:33] was going to
[50:35] heaven now if I don't maintain that
[50:39] steadfastness well what do you mean keep
[50:41] getting re baptized keep
[50:44] repenting no what means is when the word
[50:47] is being preached to
[50:49] me if God shows me okay I want you to
[50:52] get rid of those
[50:54] records then I need to repent get rid of
[50:56] those records records right God says you
[50:58] need to quit that smoke I need to quit
[51:01] that smoking right you need to cut your
[51:03] hair I'll cut my
[51:05] hair whatever God commands me to do I
[51:08] need to continue to walk in that word I
[51:11] need to hold my that my beginning
[51:14] confidence steadfast to the
[51:16] end that's what it means that's the fine
[51:19] print in the
[51:20] Bible the terms and conditions that God
[51:24] has set forth for everyone of
[51:27] us now if you're having a hard time with
[51:30] that that's what verse 15's
[51:34] for while it is said today if you will
[51:37] hear his
[51:39] voice and Harden not your
[51:43] hearts as in the
[51:46] provocation this what is happening to
[51:49] all of us is not the first time it's
[51:52] ever
[51:54] happened everybody
[51:58] is tempted with getting their hearts
[52:02] hardened they don't want to follow the
[52:04] lord they don't want to do everything
[52:05] that God tells them to do they don't
[52:07] want to whatever I could say a lot of
[52:11] things
[52:13] but it's up to us that no matter what
[52:16] God is speaking to us
[52:19] personally we need to allow our hearts
[52:21] to be
[52:23] soft let that word penetrate
[52:28] come to that place where you can say as
[52:30] Jesus said not my will thy will be done
[52:36] Lord
[52:39] and he'll see you through amen Hebrews
[52:42] chapter 10:35 cast not away therefore
[52:46] your
[52:47] confidence why it has a great recompense
[52:52] of
[52:54] reward for you have needed patience we
[52:57] all about to say Amen to that one that
[53:00] after you have done the will of God you
[53:03] might receive the
[53:04] promise for yet a little while and he
[53:09] that shall come he's going to come and
[53:12] he will not
[53:14] tar now the
[53:16] just are
[53:18] living by
[53:21] faith amen they're living by faith it
[53:24] wasn't just oh I believe in God but
[53:26] they're living by faith but if any man
[53:32] draws back on that way of living where
[53:36] he's no longer living by faith where
[53:39] he's no longer holding his confidence in
[53:42] his
[53:43] relationship the Bible says my soul
[53:46] shall have no pleasure in
[53:51] him but we and this is where we take a
[53:54] stand today this is where you said say
[53:56] Amen to the word today but we are not of
[54:00] them who draw back unto destruction to
[54:04] paraliz end to predition but of them
[54:08] that believe to the saving of the
[54:11] Soul what does that mean brother John
[54:13] that means he that endureth to the end
[54:17] the same shall be saved that today is
[54:19] the day of salvation and if you live
[54:21] tomorrow tomorrow will be the day of
[54:25] salvation the terms of God's love as
[54:28] we're getting
[54:29] ready to close but we're not closing I
[54:32] just want to make that real clear
[54:34] anybody that has an idea that we're
[54:35] closing no I say we're getting ready to
[54:39] close the terms of love that God has set
[54:44] forth for us let's take a look at the
[54:47] fine print it has to do with our
[54:48] relationship John Chapter 13 Verse
[54:51] number 35 by this shall all men know
[54:56] that you're my
[54:58] disciple okay well first we had
[55:03] to not put mom and dad first anymore not
[55:07] put our spouse first not put our our
[55:11] most loving children
[55:14] first we had
[55:16] to give up everything we have to get up
[55:19] in the morning and deny our our will we
[55:22] have to be willing to do the things that
[55:24] he asked us to pick up our cross and
[55:25] follow
[55:27] him and
[55:29] now and now what is he asking us to
[55:34] do by this shall all men know you're my
[55:36] disciples if you have loved one for
[55:38] another I thought I only had to do all
[55:41] those things and
[55:43] now that's not even good enough people I
[55:46] can do that and people will never not
[55:49] always
[55:50] know that I'm his
[55:55] disciple there's something greater that
[55:57] I have to do that for people to know
[55:59] that I'm a real disciple of
[56:02] God and that's to love
[56:06] you when you don't love
[56:10] me to care about you when you don't care
[56:14] about
[56:16] me to remember you when you don't
[56:19] remember
[56:20] me to lay down my life if you could care
[56:24] less about laying down yours
[56:29] that is the true evidence that you're
[56:33] worldwide everybody's going to know that
[56:36] you're a disciple of Christ
[56:39] amen do you know how often we try to
[56:41] prove other people that we belong to
[56:45] God
[56:47] without
[56:48] loving
[56:51] them I'm going to prove I'm right I'm
[56:54] going to prove I belong to God
[56:56] God but we don't use
[57:00] love and how many times somebody Tred
[57:03] proven to you that they were a disciple
[57:06] and you felt as cold as
[57:09] ice you didn't feel the love in their
[57:12] heart you just felt them
[57:15] defending they were so
[57:19] righteous but there's that there's
[57:21] missing of
[57:23] love and it made you question did it not
[57:27] it makes you question every single
[57:31] time but when they love oh
[57:36] wow love is corrected certainly
[57:43] is but you need to speak the truth in
[57:47] love you need to cover love covers a
[57:51] multitude love is patient kind endures
[57:54] all things believes all things hopes all
[57:55] love love does so much more than the
[57:59] flesh is willing to
[58:02] do Divine love is not an
[58:06] option it's a term and
[58:09] Condition it's a term and condition for
[58:12] us John
[58:14] 14:15 if you love me keep my
[58:20] Commandments if you love me keep
[58:22] them John 15 ver2 and this is my
[58:26] commandment excuse me John
[58:29] 15:12 this is my commandment that you
[58:32] love one another as I have loved you now
[58:35] don't you just wish it would put a
[58:38] period after that you love one another
[58:41] and just put a period
[58:46] there I could just love everybody but if
[58:50] I have to love
[58:51] everybody that little Clause that little
[58:54] yeah that's right brother r
[58:56] as God has loved me whoa It's a whole
[59:00] another ball game that's the big leads
[59:04] that's not double a tria a college high
[59:08] school that's the big
[59:11] league to love others the way that God
[59:14] loves
[59:16] us don't you like it when somebody brags
[59:20] about
[59:21] you that
[59:23] you were
[59:26] you love
[59:28] somebody the same way that God loved
[59:32] you what a feeling that
[59:35] is because we break about God's love how
[59:37] much he loves us
[59:39] right we ought to be hearing somehow
[59:44] someway through the grap
[59:47] Vine that our love is making an impact
[59:50] on one
[59:51] another that's what the the love of God
[59:54] does in the body of Christ
[59:57] it edifies it it grows it makes a
[1:00:00] difference it it covers it it blocks it
[1:00:05] it does what it needs to do to keep
[1:00:09] building praise
[1:00:11] God you know I feel his
[1:00:15] presence I know this is the truth
[1:00:18] Greater Love have no man than this than
[1:00:20] a man lay down his life for his friends
[1:00:24] and ye are my friends
[1:00:26] if you do whatsoever I command you so he
[1:00:28] laid down his life for the
[1:00:32] world but most of the
[1:00:35] world kept the door
[1:00:40] shut very few open that
[1:00:43] door and say Lord come on into my
[1:00:46] heart I want to start obeying the things
[1:00:48] that you command me to
[1:00:50] do I want to love you the way that you
[1:00:53] love
[1:00:54] me and say has told a lot of people
[1:00:57] don't you worry about letting Jesus in
[1:01:00] your heart God still loves
[1:01:03] you and God does still love
[1:01:08] them but he doesn't love them enough to
[1:01:10] put them in
[1:01:14] heaven we've got to open that door let
[1:01:18] God in s with him
[1:01:22] amen praise the
[1:01:24] Lord let's look at the fine print in
[1:01:27] God's love Luke 6 verse number
[1:01:32] 32 Luke chapter 6 verse 32 for if you
[1:01:36] love them which love
[1:01:39] you what thank have ye what thank so
[1:01:44] here Jesus is is really saying people
[1:01:48] like to receive
[1:01:51] thanks hey thank you for you know thank
[1:01:54] you for doing that for me thank you for
[1:01:56] for saying that and if you're doing if
[1:02:01] you're loving them
[1:02:03] which only love you what thank have ye
[1:02:07] for Sinners also love those that love
[1:02:11] them and if you do good to them that
[1:02:14] which do good to you I'll give you a
[1:02:17] Christmas present if you give me a
[1:02:18] Christmas
[1:02:20] present what than have you you try
[1:02:22] giving a present to somebody that cannot
[1:02:25] give you you a present
[1:02:27] am try giving to somebody that you know
[1:02:31] cannot give you
[1:02:34] something you may have to give something
[1:02:36] and say Anonymous
[1:02:38] Giver because what you're doing at that
[1:02:40] point is you're really giving to the
[1:02:42] Lord yeah if you do good to them that do
[1:02:46] good to you what thank heav you for
[1:02:47] Sinners also do even the same and if you
[1:02:50] lead them if you lend to them of whom
[1:02:53] you hope to receive what think have he
[1:02:57] for Sinners also lend to Sinners to
[1:03:01] receive as much can I remember when I
[1:03:02] was in the world oh yeah you knew you go
[1:03:05] you went to your sinner friends if you
[1:03:07] needed
[1:03:10] something hey can I bum this off you
[1:03:14] yeah you make sure you give it back
[1:03:20] man think of all the
[1:03:23] times God has loved you
[1:03:26] when you weren't loving
[1:03:29] him how about think about all the the
[1:03:32] times that God's been good to you when
[1:03:34] you were not good to
[1:03:36] him all the times that he lent you a
[1:03:39] helping hand and gave you what you
[1:03:41] needed to get you out of trouble when
[1:03:44] you weren't doing anything for
[1:03:46] him now that's the type of believer God
[1:03:50] is calling us to be
[1:03:53] amen and we have it in our possession
[1:03:57] to do the same to one another as God has
[1:04:00] done to you God is trying to shift our
[1:04:03] way of thinking from an immature all
[1:04:05] about me to being like him amen that's
[1:04:09] what's
[1:04:10] happening I love it verse 35 but love ye
[1:04:16] your
[1:04:18] enemies and do good and
[1:04:22] lend hoping for nothing amen
[1:04:27] how many times we have motives selfish
[1:04:30] motives of
[1:04:34] recognition and your reward shall be
[1:04:37] great and ye shall be the children of
[1:04:39] the highest for he is kind unto the
[1:04:43] unthankful and to the
[1:04:46] evil be ye therefore
[1:04:49] merciful as your father also is merciful
[1:04:53] look at the fine print don't don't just
[1:04:58] love love as he
[1:05:01] loved don't just love those that you
[1:05:04] have respect to persons
[1:05:06] for try loving everybody all the time no
[1:05:09] matter what that will include your
[1:05:12] enemies terms and conditions of a love
[1:05:15] relationship with God is loving others
[1:05:18] the same way that God has loved us turn
[1:05:21] with me if you would to 1 John 3:1 16
[1:05:25] love
[1:05:26] like God loves us is all about learning
[1:05:30] how to yield yourself to God that's
[1:05:33] really what it's all about because I'll
[1:05:35] be honest with you I was born in sin
[1:05:37] shaped in iniquity and I have no idea
[1:05:40] how to love like God
[1:05:42] loves the way that I love is whatever I
[1:05:46] got to do to get what I
[1:05:49] want that's what I I'll tell you I'm an
[1:05:52] expert at
[1:05:53] it I was it was like I was was born with
[1:05:56] this gift of
[1:05:59] selfishness and I can connive anybody
[1:06:02] out of
[1:06:04] anything get what I
[1:06:06] want I have that ability just gifted
[1:06:09] with it you know what we all
[1:06:11] were we knew how to connive something
[1:06:14] out of mom or
[1:06:17] dad or vice versa depending on the
[1:06:24] mood 1 John 3:16 hereby perceive we the
[1:06:29] love of God because he laid down his
[1:06:31] life for us we ought to lay down our
[1:06:34] lives for the Brethren honestly I wasn't
[1:06:38] born with that
[1:06:39] nature I don't quite know how to do that
[1:06:44] I was told I need to do it but how do I
[1:06:48] do it I learn to you to the
[1:06:52] Lord basically all you're doing is
[1:06:55] Lending your body over to God God comes
[1:06:58] inside and does it for you amen that's
[1:07:01] how it happens in Simplicity it's not
[1:07:04] you mustering up a different
[1:07:07] nature you just yielding Your Vessel to
[1:07:10] the nature that's already
[1:07:13] there and he does it for
[1:07:17] you it's
[1:07:19] beautiful staying in love with Christ is
[1:07:22] essential and vital in this hour and
[1:07:25] we're we're getting ready to close
[1:07:27] because it's getting late St John chap
[1:07:30] 15: 10 if you love me keep my
[1:07:33] Commandments if ye I'm sorry if you keep
[1:07:36] my Commandments ye shall abide in my
[1:07:40] love so as soon as you stop commanding
[1:07:42] doing the Commandments of God you step
[1:07:44] out of love talking about love
[1:07:47] relationship even as I have kept my
[1:07:49] father's Commandments and abide in his
[1:07:52] love uh verse number four the same
[1:07:54] chapter 15:4 abide in me and I in you as
[1:08:00] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:08:02] except it abide in the vine no more can
[1:08:04] you except you abide in me so we have to
[1:08:06] stay connected in this love relationship
[1:08:10] with God not just a relationship not
[1:08:13] just church attendance not just paying
[1:08:16] ties come on it's love relationship
[1:08:20] because that's what it's all
[1:08:22] about when Jesus addresses the
[1:08:26] condition of this church he's talking to
[1:08:29] the messenger of leoda it's a oblique
[1:08:33] situation the church wasn't filled with
[1:08:36] people holding up to God's terms and
[1:08:40] conditions if I could say it like this
[1:08:42] they were not reading the fine print
[1:08:45] there was ministers who were just
[1:08:48] preaching the this the skim or the the
[1:08:51] the the easy things of the
[1:08:54] Gospel the feeling good of God's
[1:08:57] presence the gifts even come on but
[1:09:01] we're not talking about the will of
[1:09:06] God they weren't acting right they
[1:09:09] weren't dressing right they weren't even
[1:09:12] believing
[1:09:13] right it was a bleak condition when the
[1:09:16] messenger was preaching he had a hard
[1:09:20] job telling the
[1:09:22] church where they were at in their
[1:09:24] relationship with God that's really what
[1:09:28] this message is when he's speaking he's
[1:09:30] speaking to the Church of
[1:09:33] Leia now of course in that message he's
[1:09:36] calling out a
[1:09:39] bride he's calling out the bride and
[1:09:41] he's dressing the
[1:09:42] bride but he's calling her out of the
[1:09:46] church
[1:09:48] amen the Church of leoda it's a pretty
[1:09:51] hopeless condition that's why we got to
[1:09:53] come out of it
[1:09:55] that church was
[1:09:57] naked they did not even realize that the
[1:10:00] things that they were
[1:10:02] believing were nothing they were
[1:10:04] invisible to God they going to hold up
[1:10:07] no water with
[1:10:10] God they didn't know that their own
[1:10:13] personal
[1:10:15] belief wasn't adequate for a
[1:10:17] relationship with God you know how many
[1:10:18] times you're talking to some and the
[1:10:20] first thing one of the things they say
[1:10:21] is well the way that I think the way
[1:10:23] that I believe the way that I see
[1:10:25] it those words do not mean
[1:10:30] anything it's really what the word says
[1:10:33] it's what Jesus said it's what's re
[1:10:36] what's between the pages of this book
[1:10:38] it's it's what what what the prophet
[1:10:40] said
[1:10:42] amen I'll say the Church of leoda Jesus
[1:10:45] called them blind they can't even see
[1:10:48] their own spiritual condition and the
[1:10:50] Bible tells us that the God of this evil
[1:10:52] age has has blinded the minds of them
[1:10:54] which what believe
[1:10:57] not they didn't do the first step they
[1:11:00] didn't believe and if you don't believe
[1:11:03] you become
[1:11:04] blinded God will never ever ever ever
[1:11:09] ever ever ever ever ever born you
[1:11:14] blind it's a choice that you
[1:11:17] make he told those disciples if you
[1:11:20] would say that I'm blind then you would
[1:11:23] see but since you say you see you're
[1:11:28] blind it's a it's a it's a choice it's a
[1:11:31] condition but there's a little flock in
[1:11:34] this age fear not little flock it's the
[1:11:37] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:11:39] kingdom that God is preparing a bride
[1:11:42] for a Rapture amen she's the one that
[1:11:46] that has ears to hear I want to leave
[1:11:49] you with this last condition that God
[1:11:52] gave to the church in Revelations 3: 22
[1:11:55] he says he that have an ear let him hear
[1:11:59] what the spirit is saying to the
[1:12:02] churches he that have an ear in other
[1:12:04] words everybody don't have an
[1:12:07] ear can you imagine if you came into
[1:12:10] church today and half of the people that
[1:12:15] came in did not have
[1:12:18] ears yeah that would look funny that
[1:12:21] would look weird that would be
[1:12:24] sad break our
[1:12:27] hearts but there are a lot of people in
[1:12:30] church who don't have
[1:12:35] ears they they have ears to hear what
[1:12:38] they want to hear and if they don't hear
[1:12:41] what they want to hear they're going to
[1:12:42] go somewhere
[1:12:46] else there's only a small group of
[1:12:49] people that have ears to hear what the
[1:12:52] spirit is
[1:12:54] saying what the Holy Ghost is
[1:12:57] saying and that ear has everything to do
[1:13:00] with
[1:13:01] desire like if I was to go ahead you're
[1:13:04] all I'm GNA clap my hands GNA be kind of
[1:13:06] loud so if I
[1:13:07] go everybody heard that like it or not
[1:13:10] they heard it because of these natural
[1:13:14] ears but spiritually when God is
[1:13:17] speaking we it's not like
[1:13:21] that he just doesn't speak and everybody
[1:13:23] hears it
[1:13:25] that sound has everything to do with
[1:13:28] desire it's condition of the horor Lord
[1:13:30] I got to hear from you
[1:13:32] today it's a hunger it's a thirst it's a
[1:13:36] it's a realness of the relationship and
[1:13:38] then you get to hear his voice it's a
[1:13:41] still Small Voice that he's speaking to
[1:13:43] the church
[1:13:45] today and it's
[1:13:48] personal it has nothing to do with me it
[1:13:52] has nothing to do with the person that
[1:13:53] sits next to you it has nothing to do
[1:13:56] with your spouse nothing to do with your
[1:13:57] best friend it has nothing to do with
[1:14:00] anything it's God reserves that between
[1:14:02] you and
[1:14:05] him and he's he leaves the church with
[1:14:09] these last words he that hasn't
[1:14:14] here I tell you if I wasn't hearing from
[1:14:17] the Lord it would make me
[1:14:20] desperate it would make me say God I'm
[1:14:22] not hearing you I need to hear from you
[1:14:24] I need to I need you Lord what more do I
[1:14:26] need to do so I can hear you do I gota
[1:14:29] do I gotta get come to pray more maybe I
[1:14:32] need to pray
[1:14:35] more I can't force God to speak to me
[1:14:40] sorry about that clap I didn't mean to
[1:14:41] scare anybody there you can't force God
[1:14:44] to do that you speak to me no it's a
[1:14:48] love affair it's all about desire and
[1:14:51] want I'll say today if you're Desiring
[1:14:53] and you're wanting God
[1:14:55] you will hear his
[1:14:59] voice and it may be as subtle as this
[1:15:02] boy I heard a whole sermon and I'm not
[1:15:04] sure if I heard from God well if you
[1:15:06] heard him to get serious about the terms
[1:15:09] and conditions you heard from
[1:15:13] God I don't think God expects us to you
[1:15:16] know hear this whole thing grab this
[1:15:18] whole thing every time we come to church
[1:15:20] it's hard there's a lot of
[1:15:23] information but I'll say it like this
[1:15:25] the reason that the sermons are the way
[1:15:28] they are is because I want you to catch
[1:15:30] a picture that's throughout the Bible
[1:15:32] it's it's a theme it's there it's real
[1:15:35] it's not just a little
[1:15:39] thought we've got to back up what we're
[1:15:42] saying so I'll say start out with just
[1:15:45] Lord I heard you speak to me to get
[1:15:49] serious about the terms and
[1:15:51] conditions and I want to start walking
[1:15:53] in that direction that's all you need to
[1:15:54] do do God will give you the next
[1:15:57] step don't get hard to the
[1:16:00] word allow your heart to be soft stand
[1:16:08] together now find for me one of the
[1:16:11] hardest
[1:16:12] things is I feel like I got three
[1:16:21] lives it can't be as simple as just you
[1:16:25] know
[1:16:26] I used to burn the candle at five
[1:16:28] different ends now I don't care how much
[1:16:31] I try they just fizzle out about
[1:16:34] 6:30 no matter how much I want to burn
[1:16:36] them no matter how much I want to do I
[1:16:38] just got to wait till the next day
[1:16:40] brother Stan knows what I'm talking
[1:16:42] about you can only go so far so much but
[1:16:46] I still got the same responsibilities
[1:16:48] that I did before and so it takes me so
[1:16:50] much longer to get anything done one of
[1:16:53] the hardest things I have for me is
[1:16:55] getting and spending time alone with the
[1:16:58] Lord just me and him oh I have to force
[1:17:01] myself just to get to study in the
[1:17:05] message to get prepared for
[1:17:08] church but set this thing aside Lord
[1:17:11] this is just between me and you what you
[1:17:13] want me to do one of the hardest things
[1:17:15] for me to do is just spend time with the
[1:17:18] Lord to get direction for my
[1:17:22] life the pressure
[1:17:28] we've got to make time we've got to
[1:17:30] we've got to carve out more time you see
[1:17:32] what the devil has done in this age with
[1:17:34] the covid all the fear and all the
[1:17:37] things that is
[1:17:38] happening just gets us so
[1:17:41] distracted and then we're looking for
[1:17:43] some sort of place of normality and
[1:17:45] trying to get involved more at the
[1:17:47] holidays and the the family and staying
[1:17:49] connected and and all these things and
[1:17:51] every one of these is taking us away
[1:17:53] from the Lord
[1:17:56] if there's ever an hour that we need to
[1:17:57] press in this is the hour we need to
[1:18:00] come together with
[1:18:02] purpose with a closer walk with the Lord
[1:18:05] with staying
[1:18:07] connected I think it was brother Mark
[1:18:09] was telling me yesterday you know
[1:18:11] brother John it just seems like it's
[1:18:12] been so long since I've been to church
[1:18:14] we missed one
[1:18:16] service but look how it affects
[1:18:21] you that's why I feel so so bad for
[1:18:25] those that haven't been here in a while
[1:18:28] it's got to be
[1:18:31] hard amen make a pledge with me to take
[1:18:35] God's terms and conditions sign on the
[1:18:38] line Lord I'm
[1:18:41] willing teach me your way amen let's
[1:18:45] look to him in
[1:18:46] prayer with every head bowed every eye
[1:18:49] closed maybe there's someone here today
[1:18:52] says brother John would you remember me
[1:18:54] today God knows what's on my heart pray
[1:18:56] for me God bless these hands God sees
