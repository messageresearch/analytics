don't want to come here without him you want to bring them amen amen and that way we all can have a little bit more than what we had we come so let's just look to the Lord and ask His blessings on the furtherance of this service our heavenly father we stand here in need that's why we've come to the house of the Lord Lord as Brother Bruce had made mentioned you are our Shield you are a comfort you are a buckler you are all that we have need of whatever need that we have you are the answer to that need and Lord we believe as as Believers in this Bible that you've given us that you've sent your word to meet our needs Thy word declares you sent your word to heal us and you're a God that can touch our minds and give peace amen you can touch our hearts and fill us with thy great love you're able to mend relationships you're able to bring forth your nature down deep in our hearts and change our character that be pleasing in thy sight and Lord we pray that you would just anoint the service today to each one of us may our hearts and our spirits be so in tune with you Lord that there's no distractions father that you would give us ears to hear what the spirit is saying to us this morning Father we commit the service into your hands we pray your blessings upon the reading of the word and that the ministry would come forth with Revelation to every heart we pray we'll give you praise for this now in advance as we wait furtherance on thee in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen am amen turn with me if if you would to uh first John chapter 3 we have actually three scripture readings before we have you be seated the first is in 1 John chapter 3 second is going to be Matthew 24 and the last is going to be Revelations chapter 19 I want to entitled this message making ourselves ready making ourselves ready kind of putting the responsibility on us first John chapter 3 starting with verse number one verses 1 through3 be behold what manner of love the father have bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not that's right beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him like he is and every man that have this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure amen now Matthew chapter 24 what manner of love when we think of God we think of love and we're going to be just like him when he appears that means we're going to be of that same love and each one of us that has that hope is purifying himself now they're getting themselves ready amen Matthew 24 and verse 44 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh amen those are great words of warning from the Lord Jesus Christ to us today and then Revelations chapter 19 for our last verse before you're seated Revelations Chapter 19 Verse number 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready God bless you may be seated um this morning uh before when you got out of bed um maybe you took your jammies off and then you put your church clothes on because you wanted to prepare yourself for church amen does anybody else agree with that statement okay when it comes to the rapture we have certain things that we have to put off in our nature right and there's certain things that we have to put on so we can be ready for the Rapture now many Believers are leaving it totally up to God for them to get ready they're just putting it all on God it'll be by the grace of God that I'll make the Rapture so their mentality is it's all on God and I if I could say this if we could just look at the children of Israel I believe they had that attitude right because see God took them out of Egypt they didn't have to do nothing God did all the work amen and so they came out and they had that same attitude about the promised land that God was just going to drive out the enemy and then and and God's just going to give him the promised land but this is where it changed God expected them to move in and move out the things that shouldn't be there before they inherited it and it takes Faith to do that and I believe that we've got to to take out the enemy to get into the promised land for what God really has for us now God has already provided a message for us in this hour to dress us and I believe the Bride of of Christ is re has received the message and is receiving the message and there's an invisible Union that's going on right now on the planet you you can't necess neily be seen outwardly but but God is coming into the heart of his bride and is changing the literal nature that she has into the same image of Jesus Christ the wise virgin she's digging into the message and she's becoming the message she's laying aside everything else to go after that perfect love because she knows that she's going to have to have that same manner of love that God has bestowed upon her she's going to have to have that back for for him while the foolish virgins are living with the attitude that they already have enough to make it because they're in the message see they're all ready to go they're already predestinated and that that mentality keeps them from going on and getting more of the Holy Ghost which is the the actual life of God is the Holy Ghost we're allware we're living in the most dangerous hour of all time amen just if you look out there the the whole world's going insane am the whole world has become deceived in one fashion form or way of or another and it doesn't seem uh to be getting like leveling out I I I really think the train has gone over the hill and it is going down along with the world the church world is deceived and the worldly church is deceived as well we're living in perilous times or dangerous times on April 30th of this year I preached a message ready or not here I come I just want to quote one thing from that message they asked brother bran the question is it possible for a person to be lost and end up in hell if they reject the light of the word even though he was genu he had a genuine experience of justification and sanctification and brother brand made it real simple real clear yes sir that's exactly right that's scary so no matter what experience we got when God wants to give us new light right more word that He is wanting us to do amen maybe revealed more of the message maybe reveal more of the word if we don't walk into that light how can we be part of the rapture we can't rely on a past experience or a a a a past work of Grace that God has done in their life I mean think about the children of Israel when they were trying to go into the promised land they didn't say hey you you know you you took us out of Egypt you know shouldn't you give us that we we should still about to go God requires them to do something and it took faith and it's going to take Faith for us to make a Rapture I believe that amen so it takes more to get ready than we realize we've got to be Overcomers just like the children of Israel had overcome and they didn't want to we have to overcome so whether we want to or not we have to amen Jesus said to him that overcometh why I grant to sit with me on my Throne now who is sitting with Jesus on the throne the bride the bride nobody else not the church not those that just do 90% but the bride he chooses the bride now we've got two great enemies to overcome two great enemies to make ourselves ready amen and one of them is the devil he deceiveth the whole world he's the accuser of the brother he's the one that's behind every terrible thing that happens he's the one that lies to us he's the one that tries to deceive us he's the one that gets us to sin we've got to overcome him but then there's another enemy and that is Us in fact brother brandham said that enemy was his greatest enemy amen more than Satan yes and if you notice the only way that we can overcome Satan is by overcoming ourselves right he overcame them with the the blood of the Lamb with the word of their testimony and they love not their lives even until the death so we've got to overcome ourselves to overcome the enemy but God has told us greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world I trust our hearts are prepared this morning that God really God's word can come and find a dwelling place inside our hearts well too many Believers think they're ready enough because they've been baptized they've cleaned up some things in their life they've they've maybe perhaps stopped smoking or or drinking or something like that and that they're they're set because they they always compare themselves with something uh that that that that that was worse than their state and we're thankful for uh for growth taking place but that growth taking place doesn't mean we stop growing and it's it's it's it's a dangerous attitude to feel that I'm I'm I'm pretty good right now it's okay to say greater is he that's in me but it's not good to say I'm pretty good right now I I I feel that I'm I'm I'm worse today than I was back when I first gave my heart to the Lord now why do you say that brother John well when I gave my heart to the Lord I didn't know nothing except I was just I'm not I'm going to hell if I don't give my heart to God but now he's given me so many opportunities from then till now what have I done with my time how faithful have I been to his word have I been as faithful to him as I should it's a dangerous attitude to have 1 John chapter 1 if you like to follow me there 1 John chapter 1 verse number five this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you what is the great message that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all now we're supposed to become like him we're going to see him as he is we're going to be just like him that means in us there's going to have to be no Darkness at all now this is a hard thing to perhaps accept to see how it can be done but we've got to start with the attitude that that's what God is requiring with me and I must take this serious am God doesn't want any darkness in our lives and and the way that we make ourselves ready is start dealing with those things God is not looking for something perfect because there it doesn't exist humanity is full of flaws and Frailty but he is looking for a heart that desires to be like him serious about it verse number six if we say that we have fellowship with him look I got a I I got a I got a a walk with God but we walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth amen so what do we do with this H who who's walking in the light I mean don't you feel that each one of us need to take a good look at this really has nothing to do about what church we're going to or or or anybody else in the church it really has to do with Where I Am with You Lord amen the whole Church world out there saying oh yeah I have fellowship with God I I walk with God I go to church and but are they walking in the light so when God gives us light I believe that God is expecting us to walk in it it's an expectation that God has verse seven but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from from all sin so we think about this if I don't if I don't forgive you the trespass that you have that you did against me God will not forgive me his blood won't cover me won't cleanse me so the light of the word is I've got to forgive you even though I didn't cause the problem amen so God has an expectation that we walk in his word True Fellowship with one another I'm going to be honest with you is when we're walking in the word you know how it is when you're a Believer you believe the word you're talking to somebody that don't believe the word that Fellowship no matter how much of a friend you may be with them in the world there is a dividing line and True Fellowship is when you're fellowshipping with somebody whose heart is is doing everything they can to walk in all the of God's word that's true Fellowship am anything outside of that it is broken amen now the bride will be taken from all seven Church ages amen right we could almost say there's Catholics that were saved out of out of Luther's time and all they had to do was believe that God is the one that saves them that it's not by works that there's no other mediator between God and man except the man Christ Jesus that had to believe in the grace of God for their salvation and that true Faith does lift the burden of sin just like it did on Martin Luther fortunately for them they didn't have to worry about sanctification they didn't have to worry about the gifts or the the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they certainly didn't have to worry about this end time message where all the word is being restored but yet there will be part of that bride will be from that age this age is by far the hardest of every age because all the word has been restored in this age that's what God sent the message for was to restore the entire word right so in this age it's harder for us to be just like him than it was in Luther's age to be just like him we cannot sit around and saying well I've got this I've got this I've got this I everything should I should be good we can't do that your your Bullseye your goal what you've been predestinated to is to be in His image right you can't put it all on God the bride makes herself ready the wife makes herself ready you have a part to play you have a part to play where you you you take off that which you would shouldn't be there that that your first nature that has to be taken off amen and you have to be dressed in the nature of God now God can only give you his nature that can only come through the Holy Ghost but if you don't get serious about God I I need you to deliver me of this old Wretched Man who's always trying to just have his selfish way through the course of the day and just go to church twice a week and feel that's all he needs to do I need to be delivered of that Lord let's look carefully at Matthew chapter 24 I want to read some some scriptures in here starting with verse number 42 Matthew 24:42 Jesus really speaking to us you know I I I got thinking about this and I don't know if I'll end up doing this but you know there's a lot of things that Jesus spoke and that he was actually speaking to us and he wasn't speaking to his disciples then but he spoke him to his disciples so it could be written and then we could hear it so he's speaking to the last hour and he says watch therefore in verse 42 for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would have not suffered his house to be broken up now I'm being honest with you we you all left your home and and no body else is there right but if you knew you had an inside word somebody was going to come to your house and break in when you were at church no doubt you would have stayed home maybe called for backup because you know I believe the bride knows the hour that this is the hour that he's coming God is longsuffering he's not willing that any should perish but should come to repentance but Peter said that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night he's not going to announce it to everybody I don't believe he's going to announce it to the bride I don't believe he's going to be saying oh by the way I'm coming in a week from now he wants to see if they really want to be his bride that they're going to live for him that they they're going to please him and do his will prior to the announcement so we're living in the night that Peter was referring to this is the hour that the bride is looking for her groom and she's not thinking oh I know he's coming but it's a little bit down the road come on these are not words that we say these are feelings we feel these are thoughts we think which is not from heaven right verse 44 therefore be ye also ready for in such hour as you think not the son of man cometh I want to just talk to the heads of the church for a second the heads of the families if you're ahead so I'm talking to you men fathers verse 45 for who then is a faithful in a wise servant who his Lord have made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season I want to say to you fathers you you you husbands um are you giving your family the spiritual food in due season that they need to make a Rapture I that's just an honest question are you feeding them the food that's going to make them ready for his coming you can't be putting this on the pastor I'm sorry you can't you can't be putting that on pushing play I want to speak to us all as as individuals now I'm including the sisters I'm including the children the Lord made each and every every one of us a ruler over this our household right here amen so have you been a faithful and wise servant are you feeding yourself with the spiritual food that God has set in this hour to get us ready for his coming yes or have we been caught up with the cares of this life because we're not going to be ready if we allow ourselves to to be caught up Jesus said in Luke 21:34 and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharge with surfing drunkenness and the cares of this life and so that day come upon you unaware for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth not just America watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all those things things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man I believe the wife of Christ that made herself Worthy is the one that made herself ready is the one that's worthy to escape these things so we got our our part to play and I wish I could say you know just come just come faithful to church you know just give your tithes and you know you know what everything's going to be okay he the moment I say that you better March me out these doors because that's not what the word says verse 45 who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord have made him ruler over his household to give them meat in due season oh I love that be mindful of what your family needs be mindful of what your body needs your soul feeds on the things of God Amen blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen blessed is that servant verily I saying to you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods I wonder who sitting with Jesus Christ on the throne it's this wise servant who was taking the spiritual food in the due season for his coming and getting ready it's no longer you got to get Way Beyond I believe the message you got to get Way Beyond it that message has got to sink inside your body and you've got to start manifesting things that that message had brought to us that's how we make ourselves ready we watch we pray we we stay spiritually in tune he's coming that's for sure but it's the word that gives us what we need to be manifest to manifest it's not our favorite song it's not our favorite scripture it's not our our our our our favorite encouragement that word is what we are to become and God is the bride is making herself ready by taking the word the word this Bible from cover to cover and saying it's important to God it's got to be important to me now John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way of the Lord Jesus Christ he was a voice that cried in the wilderness preparing those who would hear here he prepared the way of the Lord he made it clear that Jesus is coming and we need to get ready now there were Snakes in the Grass but there were those that were ordained to hear Jesus Christ and I I'd like to say if they didn't hear John the Baptist's message they probably wouldn't hear Jesus's message either now when Esther was making herself ready to be the Bride of King hazeroth the Bible says that she required nothing but what the king's Chamberlain had appointed her to have to get ready right so whatever the king's servant had said that's what she took and you know the Bible says that she found favor inside of The King and I believe because she did what the message told her to do I don't know if you realize but a lot of us when we take uh a bath and we want to get real cleaned up and we put in uh what's that stuff you put in your bathtub Mr bub Mr Bubble that we know that's from quite a few days ago and uh but there's uh all all sorts of epson salts with lavend door and all these uh things that turn into a bubble bath and um you know sometimes we'll we'll be in there for an hour and say whoa that was a long time I must be pretty clean but when Esther was getting clean she needed more than an hour can you imagine 12 months of purification now when I think about that I think that's a little little overdoing it don't you think King but it it was a type for us this purification isn't just I I got baptized and I'm trying to do the right thing now you got to keep on going he that has this whole purifies himself even as he already is pure but he still keeps going because he knows his vision is going to be just like Jesus God has sent a message today I'll tell you without the message I wouldn't know the Bible amen you talk to you talk to the greatest Scholars that there is that knows this Bible if they don't know this this message I'm telling you you know a lot more than they do that is the truth and it doesn't matter the age of the child that's right there's just something missing I could see why God had to sent a prophet said behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord wow well I know that when Jesus came born in the manger that coming was not Dre Dreadful right it was not Dreadful it was a rejoicing this day I'll bring you good tidings of great joy shall be for all people this is talking about his second coming that's going to be Dreadful but God promised to send a messenger a prophet what's he going to do well Jesus said in Matthew 17:11 Elias truly shall first come and re rest store all things all things amen not just some of them Revelations 10:7 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets we're blessed people God chose you out of a big big group of people somehow he got the message to you somehow he directed you to the truth we ought to be the happiest people in the world because you need the message to overcome you need the message to overcome how can you overcome and not brother B say is recognizing the devil and all his tricks this message shows us the devil talks about motives and objectives and checking those things because the devil can inside the word of God has been restored to the church Jesus said in John 18:37 everyone that is of Truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice in other words there's something inside of us that said yes I believe this and that's your connection with God there's a small flock who's taking the truth and making herself ready amen they're purifying themselves with the pure word because this is pure there's no man's opinion I was talking to someone today and I I I it's I wasn't talking to him today I was talking to him the other day and I was trying to get them to read the Bible and I told him to start with Romans just start with Romans read the first three chapters and then we talk the next week well they just the day before that I saw them they they read the first two chapters and she started out by saying that um well I I think you know you know Paul was given his opinion his View and so I just strictly said this this this Bible is God's word it it is nobody's opinion there's no man's opinion in there right our my whole soul is banked on this word if this word don't get me there nothing will amen nothing will there ain't a man on this planet I have confidence in my confidence is in the word Faith's final resting place is in the word so you pray pray for those Souls because we want them to come to church but in Ephesians 5:27 I'm just going to read it real quick Paul said that he might sanctify and cleanse the church with the washing of the Water by the word amen so when we think about washing whether dishes whatever it is we're using water brother Stan he washes his tools when he's done making that beautiful beautiful entryway he uses water to wash it God uses his word to wash us yes and the thing is we've got to take the word into our heart we don't want to be washed on the outside we don't come to church to get washed on the outside we get washed on the Inside Yes it deals with our motives our character things that nobody knows about except you and God Amen and what's the reason verse 27 says that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish I want to be his bride certainly My Flesh doesn't want to yield to this word My Flesh doesn't want to have to humble itself and pray and and and and make things right and and and and pursue the the character of God it doesn't want to it's just like yours it was just like Peter's but thank God somebody not Peter or Paul off his horse God is attention you're on the wrong path and I'm so glad something God knocked me off my horse amen got me on the right path amen I can see now why brother bam says we come here to find out where we're at with god let's go back to Matthew now God's giving us just time enough just time enough to make ourselves ready we don't have extra time verse 48 but if but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delay is coming you know how how the evil man says that in his heart I don't have to worry about that right now that's how he says that and God looks at that mentality as being evil and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunkard in another words words he begins not to care about helping others get ready for his coming that's what that really means yeah we know the whole world is killing one another out there but when you don't care to help somebody get ready for the coming of the Lord you're just so focused on yourself and spend time with those that are in the world what are they doing it's all about them it's all about what pleases them not saying we're we're drinking I'm not saying that but look if there was a fire in here and it was real bad and somebody else's child was in here you wouldn't say every man for himself sir you would be running back in there to get that child am but we're talking about the coming of the Lord there is no service after the coming of the Lord there won't be any service here I will not be here so this train only leaves once you know we can miss a service and come to the next one we can miss a day of prayer and come to the next one you cannot miss the coming of the Lord verse 50 the Lord of that servant shall come in that day when he look not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him aunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and nashing to PE notice you know when we look at a hypocrite we look at somebody who professes one thing and then doesn't do it right now Jesus is saying hey if I've told you about it you're not going to walk in that light that's hypocritical what does it take to make ourselves ready that's the real question Romans chapter 13 we want to go through some scriptures here and just talk about taking off some old things and putting on some new things what does it take to make ourselves ready well Romans 13 I'm going to start with verse 7 render therefore to all their dues tribute to him tributors do custom to him Customs do fear to him fear honor to him honor all no man anything don't try to leave the planet on somebody something oh no man anything but to love one another amen oh I love that you know if you just love you'll take care of things for he that loveth another ha fulfilled the law when you're manifesting Divine love you're surely on the right track just remember that and if you're not manifesting Divine love you better get there first brother Brandon says without perfect love there's no way to to get in there how are you going to make a Rapture without perfect love James said if if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scriptures Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor as th you do well but if you have respect to persons you actually commit sin amen and are convince the law and our transgressor so if I respect somebody in this church more than somebody else if I love someone more favoritism than somebody else I'm a transgressor sir God don't want a wife up there that only has love for certain persons because he's a God that loves all persons amen he just has the character to deal with those who are out of character he just has enough love to handle it without just getting rid of them because if you think about it every child of God every member of the Bride every foolish version that's go through tribulation every single one had satanic nature before God came to them so he's got the capability of dealing with a satanic nature amen and if we get filled with God's love we'll know how to handle it too but I tell you you can't do it on yourself you know one satanic nature trying to deal with somebody else's satanic nature it don't work no but the love of God in your heart covers a multitude of sins it is patient it is kind as Longs suffer it endures all things it can handle it amen Jesus said if you love them which love you what reward have you you're not even the publicans if you salute your brethren only what do you do do not even the publicans do the same thing Jesus is saying you're nothing special if you just loves only certain people in the church you're nothing special you're not considered material if that's how you're going to end up so if you're there start loving those that you have a hard time with get to that place where you can love everybody even your enemies that's what the prophet said Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect lay aside everything and go after that perfect love get rid of respected persons by this shall all men know you're my disciples by this shall all men know you're ready for the Rapture when you have love one for another that's right all right Romans 13:10 love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the Fulfillment of the law and that knowing the time and now is high time to wake out of our sleep for our Salvation is nearer than when we first believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off The Works cast them off the works of darkness you know some people would read that verse and they' say oh that's for The Sinner no that's for the believer The Sinner don't believe it the night is far spent the days and let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the AR armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not riding drunkenness not in chamberling and wanness not in strife and envy but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof so we're to cast off strife and envy and Ill behavior and and just wanting things cast that off it's a work of Darkness amen and put on the armor of light well what is that the Lord Jesus Christ amen in other words be clothed with humility put on the that let the mind that was in Christ be in you amen some people put on Christianity like they do clothes you know what I'm saying when they're done with them they just take them off they're just going to beat their own self they put them on when it's convenient or for sure show or if they want to preach to somebody hey look at these Duds dude pretty fancy huh don't I look good I just say if you're going to put those clothes on keep them on don't be a show be genuine amen Christianity is something that you leave on it's it's an everyday life it's you live it it doesn't matter if who you're living around is a Believer or not you live it it's not to be a sh we're not Hypocrites we're Believers we're making ourselves ready it requires more than just the act that Christ did for us at Calvary he did his part but God is asking us to obey his word we've got to do our part he did his we have to do ours and throughout these scriptures you're going to see that we have to cast off the first nature and then we have to put on God's nature and we're just using that terminology of casting off and putting on but I'm going to say it like this this means your heart is actually putting forth effort you don't sit there and say well God's going to have to put me in the promised land if I'm going to get there you're not going to get there at that attitude neither did the children of Israel you want you're going to have to be like Joshua and Caleb I'm going out after the nature of God nothing can stand before me if God be with me who can be against me and that's how the attitude we got to have Ephesians chapter 4 verse1 15 now we we're talking a little bit in our series about um be functioning as a healthy body but it kind of connects here a little bit I believe because God is not marrying a child he's not marrying a a lady that's immature we have to grow up right verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ and from the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love God give us a revelation like that then I can stop preaching there's a lot there this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the UN having the understanding darkened being alienated from the real true life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart how important is about to see the word to not be blinded to the word because whatever you think God really is that's what you'll be you've got to have a you've got to know who God is God is Holy so that means you're going to be holy God is loving you're going to be loving God is forgiving you're going to be forgiving whatever you you Vision God to be it's you got to keep that there and walk in it who being past feeling have given thems over to lasciviousness to walk all all to work all uncleanness with greediness it's all about them but you have not so learned Christ praise God if so be that ye have heard of him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that's why we believe in preaching the truth here and that you put off concerning the formal conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust well we all had one thing in common before we came to the Lord we wanted our own will we had that in common we may not agree with one another but we wanted what we wanted amen and as we the more we become like Christ the more we want to serve one another amen that's right all right and be renewed in the spirit of your mind this is the way you think and that you put on the new man which is after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore put away that little sneaky I'm not going to tell you everything speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be not angry and or be angry and sin not I say for most of you that don't have a Revelation on that just don't be angry amen if you're going to get angry get angry at sin Not a Human Being because as soon as you let it out on that human being you've sinned so be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath now look at we're supposed to be putting this on taking this off and putting this on put off anger and put on don't let the sun go down before you make things right now we all well now this is the Bible this is not the John Martin you know Bible this is the King James Bible I just read out of this is what we need to practice can you say amen amen amen be be committed to it because you're the bride if I was if I was talking to the foolish version hey look we wouldn't be having this type of service I'd be you know trying I'd be preaching to them I'd be saying you know you're doing so good you don't need to do anything more you know what I'm saying all right don't let the sun go up on your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor don't be looking for things from others but labor I don't I've never understood it where these people go into a store and they steal stuff or they steal from somebody I mean what is that it wasn't yours to begin with I don't care if you give it to somebody else I don't care if you're a Robin Hood and you are vigilante and steal from this guy and give it to the poor you're not supposed to steal you want to give something away go labor for it and then give it away let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which worketh which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth it let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of the Ed that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers you know we all have a chance to minister don't we every time we open our mouth I'm speaking to every one of us of what we say in our homes right because that's where we need to practice is is in our homes or maybe on our jobs and grief not the Holy Spirit whereby years sealed until the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you taken off of you with all malice and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake have forgiven you so we see in these set of scriptures that God is wanting us to put off a first nature and put on his nature and the problem is we go through and we make mistakes we give some excuse I wouldn't have done it if they would have did this and they started first and they called me that and they said this and they offended me and that wasn't right before you know it you've got some self-righteous reason to act the way you do well Vengeance doesn't belong to you it belongs to God Amen what we need to do is be so full of the love of God that we can actually handle things hey I'm G to be just like him I'm I'm sorry but I just believe it I'm stupid enough to believe the word of God call me odd you go ahead but I'm gonna believe it if nobody believes it I'm going to believe it and the quicker we believe it the quicker we'll be able to start handling things is we got to we got to start working through them you know usually when they're comes a problem I don't want to get into our Wednesday series that we are doing but you know we get so afraid when somebody goes that's just the devil manipulative the Bible tells me to be tenderhearted amen tenderhearted I want to be that I want to live that I don't want to live it just in front of you brother Ron I want to live it to the person who really wants to hurt me who really had something bad I just talking to a minister just yesterday and he was telling me about these things that were said about him just Plastering him so everybody could hear and it just hurt me the bride don't do that I don't care if they're claiming to be the bride the bride won't do that the thing really needs to be made right they need to get right we have to put on Christ therefore If any man being Christ he's a new creature the old has passed away all things have become new and all things are of God so we got to put on all of God we got to put on the the whole armor of God right things we got to take off we got to take off our self-righteousness we got to take we got to put off all of our iniquities Colossians chapter 3:8 I I want to read these quickly here Colossians chapter 3:8 but now ye also there's more things I like that the Bible's not over with but now ye also put off these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing the put off the old man with his deeds and it put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him God still has this Vision let us make man in our own image where there is neither Greek nor nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbar Barbarian cian Bond or free but Christ is all and in all put on therefore as the wife this is how you make yourself ready when you can holy beloved bows of Mercy kindness humbleness of mind humbleness of mind don't be thinking thoughts like I wish I could give him a piece of my mind that's not humbleness of mind if I wasn't a Christian I'd give him a piece of my mind you still got it to the mind of Christ don't think like that humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against another even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these above everything we just heard above all these put on charity which is the bond of perfectness I got thinking about that we that are married we think about the bond that we have with our spouse we do that from time to time I say time for time because other times we're dealing with situations Excuse Me Maybe I wasn't supposed to say anything [Laughter] there start over but we think of bond and there's a bond there yes and I think the bond that Christ has with his wife it's actually happening now she's thinking of what pleases him he's thinking about how to help her through to get to this point to be in His image and he's trying to wash her with the word and give her what she needs and give her faith but if she's going to be lazy and she ain't going to cry out to God well then she's not doing what the bride needs to do because I'll say it like this my wife doesn't go to any other man and say I want you to build me a greenhouse because she would get a flat out no answer that there's a bond there there's a bond between you and Christ and it's the love of God inside of you that constrains you to please him to put off the old nature and say God I want to be so full of you that when something happens I don't want you to come out right and that charity is really what bonds you the love of God bonds you together God is not attracted to your human love he is not attracted to you'll go this far but then you stop he's interested in you going and never stopping that you're in it for the Long Haul so I say today we got to make ourselves ready let's make it our first and most important because we're not going to get a heads up when he's coming this is the heads up the heads up that he sent a message and he's he's given us time to get dressed he doesn't owe us anymore time he doesn't owe us anymore you know I I I I just want to give you one more day to you know kind of put some time and spend it with me he's given us time it's up to us to number our days let's Stand Together Revelations 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come there's a union and he that Hearth say say come and let us and let him that is a thirst come and what and whosoever will let him take of the Waters of Life freely for I say unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add into the plagues that are written in this book and if any man say well I don't really have to do them it's not that necessary take away from the words of the book of this Prophet God shall take his part of the book of life and not of the holy city and from the things that are written in the book he which testifieth these things sayith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all let us be glad and rejoice amen we ought to be the happiest people in the planet the bride has really taken time to make herself ready she's found her place her part and I'm so thankful for Revelation because it takes Revelation so I'll say you that maybe don't quite see things the way that they were ministered take time to pray and just say God if that really is you would you show me and I believe God will just open that up he's just looking for a willingness amen amen amen soon and very soon we shall soon and very soon thank you sweetheart amen oh soon and very soon we are going to see see the
