TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen amen turn with me if you would to the Book of James chapter 1 uh this has been a little thought that's been on my heart for a few weeks now a couple couple couple weeks anyways uh two to three weeks and um just waiting for the the right time for the Lord uh to bless it and we trust it is it's in his time and and uh thank you that you've been praying God bless everyone that's watching on a line and sorry that you can't be here I'm sure you feel the same way um we'd love and can't wait till we're back together again everybody amen when when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be and I I I will say we did finally get our our application to from the building department that we can start presently working on it so we got the green light in that direction and now we just are are are walking in the next step so keep keep that in prayer I'm I'm thankful that I gave up on the pressure of time yeah right that's right I I deal with that enough at work you know due dates brother Ron knows all about it got to get it done now that very fact that here's the date creates pressure and um God does everything beautiful in his time that's right amen amen before we begin reading here in verse 19 let's look to the author and a word of prayer father we thank you for your precious word we thank you that you anointed James to repend these words that we're going to read and Lord we as humans have went to school and we've been taught how to read and understand what certain words mean and we certainly have uh an idea what what words mean and and just about anybody Lord that would uh go to school it have a a a a good understanding of uh what um these words would mean uh in the natural uh but God we don't want uh the our own thoughts we want to be uh in the spirit and we want to be totally yielding to the Holy Ghost and Lord we ask that that same anointing that anointed James when he penned this Lord that it would come upon us today to receive it may it become more real today uh than when we uh entered into the doors father bless this word and give Revelation now to each and every heart we'll give you the praise and honor for it as we've been praying for this uh prior to this service now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Jam James chapter 1 starting here with verse number 19 uh wherefore my brethren let every man be swift to hear and slow to speak and slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls now we all feel here that our souls are saved so why would we need the scripture because it's he that endureth to the end we've got to continue in the word amen that's right but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straight way forgiveth what manner of man he was but whosoever lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continu with therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed amen let's finish the chapter If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is considered vain but pure religion none defiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world it looks like they're doers of the word amen God bless you you may be seated well we want to entitle this do it and for a subject your decision after hearing the word your decision after hearing the word now John Martin this is John Martin's three states of Readiness three states of Readiness the first state is the state of being ready we had that little series about being ready we never quite finished it but we're going to touch on a few things because I believe the Holy Ghost really wanted things to be said but I just felt it was strong but the bride needs all the word that's right now Jesus told us be ready be ready at all times for his return and and labor continuously for his kingdom until he returns amen so being ready is living a life whereby you're pressing towards the mark the mark of His Image you want to become just like Jesus you're walking in the spirit of the Lord now this is the first state of being ready amen now the second state is right before being ready you're in the state of getting ready amen you're not only aware of not being ready but more importantly you're actively moving moving forward you're consciously putting forth effort you've accepted that there are things in your life that need to be overcomed and you're making Necessary changes in your life you're you're digging more into the message of the hour you're actively involved in the word at church amen and you're seriously moving forward so that to me is you're in the state of getting ready right amen the third state is the state of being stuck in Leia you have a form of godliness you're going to church still you're paying your tie you're listening to the sermons but your spiritual life is stagnated whether you make it to church on time or not doesn't really make a big difference or whether you make it at all it's not a big deal to you you're really not digging into the message of the hour you're not making time to read your Bible right you're just hanging around you're just going through the motions and sometimes acting religious when needed now this morning I'd like to try to help anyone who may be stuck in that state of apostasy and uncaring and also if you view yourself in the second condition this message will help you get over the hump and be ready and if you are ready this message will be a warning of how the enemy will try to deceive you that's right in other words this message is for everybody that's right i' like to take our our text from verse number 25 but whosoever lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deeds that's right amen blessed in his deeds Amelia nhart said the most effective way to do it is do it and we don't want to complicate it with do I really have to right is that really necessary is that just that's probably just for certain people right just do it amen we spent more time in prayer this morning amen so we might be more ready to hear the word than to offer the sacrifice of fools remember that message and the god that we serve now is showing us here that hearing is not enough amen that's we need to be more ready to hear than all for the saice but hearing is not enough now we got to be a doer that's right isn't that beautiful he doesn't want us to forget it he wants us to leave here and do it am be a doer of the work the Bible says God wants to see his word materialized in us become alive amen come off the book and become living in his children amen his wife now in order for this to transpire the word must become more or real to us we can't imagine or pretend that the word is real to us that's right we can't sit around and be double-minded with God's thoughts and wonder if it's really going to happen or not we've got to accept God's word as a reality for us amen then and only then can it begin to work and materialize inside of us amen I believe you have to believe the word when it's preached not just hear it but you have to believe it amen then to show forth your faith in the word that you've heard and leave here and go do it you go out by faith you put your foot in the water you trust God that he's going to separate your situation and you're going to move forward there's a part that you play it's the part of Faith it's the part of your confidence in God amen it's you showing forth trust and then God will do the rest brother brandom said in the message the word became flesh he said now if you got a double mind and you don't believe it yeah you just say well I just wonder he says you better watch out that's right he says it's got to be a change here it is a change of heart not of this physical thing but the heart of your soul and something anchors to your thoughts that that way is I'm sorry until your thoughts that way is dull you don't see it no more that's good you just see the Lord Jesus you see righteousness and Holiness and Purity and love and grace that's when you'll be changed that's right what is a convert convert means to be changed to change something over and your thoughts your habits your being has been changed from a sinner to a Christian the first thing you know in your heart then you express it with your lips and then it materializes and that's what you are and it starts with hearing the word now if you think that you think it what a word but you imagine it you think it and you express it and it doesn't materialize then you're on the wrong road so if you think that you're thinking it but already what you're doing is imagining it it won't materialize he said I love this because it makes it real clear whether we're really getting Revelation or not when we if we see it manifested when we leave here right he says you get it maybe I better let that maybe I better just go a little slower he said look if you imagine you're a Christian and you speak it out with your lips but you find out that you're not you better get your thoughts changed get your heart change see because it doesn't bear record it doesn't bear the fruit of it but the fruit of the spirit is gentleness peace longsuffering goodness meekness and faith if every little thing comes along and you fly off at it be careful you better be careful there's something that hasn't happened you're expressing something here that's not you're expressing something here that's not here amen good quote we understand that the only way God can live God that we can live the life is God living it through us only only God can live his life only the Holy Spirit can live out the life of the Holy Spirit it right and I like how uh James said it he said we can't just be a hearer of the word but we need to be a doer of the work in order for this to happen the holy spirit's got to come inside of us and do the work am because he's the only one that can do the worken I love it amen I love it's making it it's causing me to get desperate for more of God that's what he wants in this relationship in the me message the uh fundamental foundation for faith brother B says now if you want to go back a little further just as far as a as historical you can see uh the word in the beginning was the word but what was the word a word is a a thought manifested a thought spoken forth God first he perceived the thought and spoke it and meant it and became a word and the word became material amen so everything that God has spoken in his word received into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise behind it is God will do it he is obligated to do it then if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you have God the word in you and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God and it's Inseparable then if you have God's word in you you have God's life in you you have God in you and whatsoever God's word speaks forth out of you it'll have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God you and God are becoming one there's a Oneness that's happening Hallelujah now James is speaking of of two categories hearers and doers hearers only and doers let me reward that because in order to be a doer you have to be a hearer but if you're hearer only and not a doer that's two different categories so I wrote some stuff down a hearer only is someone who is not serious with God but a doer is serious with God a hearer only he doesn't care very much but a doer cares a lot a here only by definition of Love is is not a lover of the word a hearer only is not a lover of the word but a doer loves the word a hearer enjoys hearing only some of the word now this you'll see it because there's we all like love to hear the word word I'll say it like this more properly part of the word true the word that feels good the the word that energizes makes you feel good and clean and and God loves me right but we don't enjoy hearing the word of laying down our lives and giving up our time and and and following suit with things that we don't enjoy doing so a doer enjoys all the Worden a hearer could be considered more of a gambler a doer does not gamble right that's why he he's not going to gamble with the word he's going to do it amen see Satan says you don't got to do that yeah that's rightly Gambler a here only is careless Frolic and unaware jokes around about with things but a doer is sober he's Vigilant he's alert he's watchful because at any moment at any time Satan could come and try to trick you up through anybody that's true a hearer only he doesn't want to suffer but a doer suffers willingly for others a hearer only he's blind as a bat so what the Bible that's what James said but a doer has x-ray vision amen praise the Lord here only he he he just puts his time in he just goes to church puts his time in but a doer can't wait to hear what God has for them to [Music] do here only um a hearer only leans towards not being his sheep now what I mean by that Jesus said as a doer my sheep hear my voice and they follow me but if you think about it if you're not following the word if you're not doing the word you're just hearing you're really not following so a hearer only doesn't really lean towards following Jesus he just thinks he is that's the deception a here only it's just knowledge at most but a doer is actually the revelation of the word a hear only is building the relationship on sinking sand but a doer building on the solid rock a hearer only doesn't have much of a burden for Souls but a doer has a greater burden for Souls a hearer only is pretty much living for himself TR and a doer of the word he's living for others am so that's the John Martin uh here are only do doers list so of but that list could actually be endless I think we all can know whether we're doers of the word right true you don't want to pick what you are doing that's good and you don't want to beat yourself up to what you're not doing what you want to do is are you putting forth the effort to do all the word that's that's that simple amen amen that's a doer of the word but if you're wanting to just not deal with certain things do these things and and and call yourself a Believer you're deceiving your own self James said you have the ability to deceive yourself true you you would stand against anybody that would try to deceive you you'd call them an enemy but then you would Gallop or gulp a thought down that you don't have to do part of the word right now coming to church with little or no intent to change is training yourself for Spiritual deception Amen to actually get to the place that a Believer feels satisfied with just hearing the word and not committed to putting it to practice has been deceived not by the devil but by himself not submitting to the word or intending to allow that word to dictate and to rule over our hearts is on the ladder of spiritual deception amen how many times have we come to church with no intent no intent of making yourself do the word we can't come to church hear the word and because we agree with the word it's it's actually going to just do it for itself in US I'd like to ask this brother if can I you can like correct me if if if you're wrong if I'm wrong if you're wrong I could be wrong here how many times did you hear the word about cutting your hair before you did it okay and the first time that we heard the word did it all a sudden it become materialized you've got to accept it you got to believe it and then you got to put your foot in the water so how many times do we come to church and we hear this word being preached but we don't think about putting our foot in the water that's right we're making ourselves hearers of the word only walking that ladder of deception thank you brother it helps us to see you know how to look at what how we look at certain individuals and we say oh well they're like a spiritual person you know they're they must be a spiritual person look at the way they're acting look at the be because of what James is teaching us we should be able to say and see very clearly who's really walking up the ladder of deception right by simply seeing if they're obeying what they heard last service last week last month right true we get so used to just coming in church and all we got to do is show our religiousness and that's our badge that we're a doer of the word that he's not a doer of the word Merc amen this message exposes you may not want to shake my hand after service verse 23 for If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's like unto a man beholding his natural face in the glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way in straight way he forgets what matter of man he was someone who's not following through with the word that he heard at church how many times we come to church and the word speaks to us and we feel a conviction brother sister as we come here to find out where we're at with God and then God shows us we go whoa that ain't good that ain't good we've even heard comments about uh uh uh like like we feel like we got beat up at church but in in any way we feel God showing us where we're at with the word with the message of the hour TR amen we see it clearly as if we're looking in a in a in a in a mirror and say oh man I got a pimple here I got to do something about it that's right but we leave here and we forget what we look like in church what God showed us in church we forget about it right right as long as I keep going to church as long as I keep doing this as long as I keep doing that God would not have showed us what he showed us in church if he didn't have a longing and a desire in his heart for you to change he's expressing his love as many as I love I rebuke and Chason well I thought brother John that's just when you were you know in the in the denomination and you had to repent and get out of that and come into the message I thought after that you don't got to do it no more it's amazing how the enemy can twist things when we're hearing the word preached to us God is speaking and we can see clearly where we're coming short of God's glorious expectation we're saying Amen to the word but I fear that we're leaving services with just a mental agreement with the word in other words we're sitting here naturally with our natural understanding and saying yeah it's true but you know nobody's perfect nobody can do it all well we'll just try to do a little bit better when we leave and we completely forget the personalization of the Holy Ghost speaking to us that's right as individuals Jesus said we straight way or James said we straight way forget what manner of man we was right to come to church and hear the word it's quite easy true honestly it doesn't hurt well we just come and hear what he's got to say he can't hurt you but when we actually have to follow through and do it becomes painful you have to self-inflict pain Affliction right wasn't it John who when he ate the word it was sweet in his mouth it was like honey but when it began to settle in and begin to digest and it had to become part of his life became bitter harder to do Smith Wigglesworth said it right when he said with every Revelation comes the responsibility of carrying it out that's right PA we had to do is say hey man what a great Revelation I got so much Revelation I know all this I know this that and the other and no life no manifestation that's right right no responsibility for Souls that's right that's the or I think we're more of a hearer of the word than a doer amen that's right look when Jesus found they came to Jesus and they brought that woman caught in adultery and they were all trying to catch Jesus is what they were doing and Jesus simply said okay let we're going to do it we're going to do it your way you want to just take that word you want to do it he that's without sin Let Him cast the first stone and noticed it was the eldest right first that laid his Stones down first because he had more sins even though he was a Christian longer he was or more in the message longer he still sin more I don't think I think the more we come to church the more responsible we are to whom much is given much is required why do some people stop going to church that's right it's too much for them many start out the race that's right it's not it is a It's A Hard Road it's it's hard it's not easy that's trth but we don't want to get caught with just being a hearer of the word today a hearer of the message we don't want to just sit and talk about how great certain Ministries are in the message and just hear God can give you a message through a two-letter word am that's trth you could pick up a piece of mail yep see something on there and it be God speaking to you brother random saw that pack of cigarettes right he got the thought about a thinking man's filter God is everywhere we come to God's house to hear from him it's the place we can have confidence in not confidence that we're without sin that we haven't made any mistakes or that we haven't made any really bad mistakes we're Sinners saved by grace if the prophet said we could backslide a 100 times a day back then you know it's got to be worse now because T Paul told Timothy that evil would grow worse and worse right it's terrible terrible I'm telling you it's more than 50/50 half the time when you're talking to somebody whether they're gay or lesbian that's the truth brother you don't know why are they talking like that why are they acting like that that just don't look normal John you're judging them I'm not judging them but it's getting worse the statistics are not going the other way it's it's not getting more holy and more righteous and people are coming to you know no they want Church should become you accept me the way I am or you're a racist that's right you're a hater that's the truth we can't sit there blindly and say it don't exist it exists it's getting worse yes sir and just because we're not that we can't sit here in church and just hear the word and not follow through with it because we need that to make a Rapture well you know John going home and having to do that that doesn't seem like it has anything to do with the with the Rapture your obedience to that has everything to do with the Rapture right God knows what he's doing that's the TR can you imagine Gideon go go around with these lanterns and break them and the light come out and walk around Jericho seven times what does this have anything to do with going in there knocking the walls down your obedience to what God says that's what will bring the walls down that's what will make you Triumph and victorious in this leot and age that we're living in I think a lot of times when we're hearing the word being preached we're just hearing naturally We're In the Flesh and we're we're really not hearing spirit spiritually it's not being mixed with faith we're just saying Amen in agreement but not amen by faith so be it in me I don't know how many times I've sat and I've heard people say amen and it's with a pitchfork yeah oh it just hurts me not that it may not be true right but the word when it's coming is personally for you amen we need to make coming to church about you and him God don't need you to Pitchfork it on somebody else he can he can take care of conviction himself amen and when you take the word into yourself you know what you're doing you're creating an atmosphere where God can come and deal with them amen I somewhat fill up preaching this morning Hallelujah Hebrews 4:2 For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so just sitting here and hearing the word that's important but there's got to be a lot of faith it can't be just a natural Faith a carnal Faith an intellectual Faith the Devils have that and they tremble they're here too you know trth he's here telling you you don't have to listen to him that's not for you that's for somebody else he's here getting your mind on what you're going to do after service he's making you think brother John just being mean to me he's here getting us everywhere than on the word yeah right right true I want to be blessed in my deed the only way I can is to be a doer of the word a hearer of the word only is not a true close follower of Christ remember when Peter followed Jesus from afar he was following him but he couldn't accept the word he got to a place where he's even denying his relationship with Jesus Jesus but Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and they follow me in other words they do what the voice sayith amen my sheep hear my voice and they just do it amen well look don't look at God is the only thing he's going to do is guide you out of some corn maze go here go here go this do this follow me I'll show you the way that's it that's all his job is is to lead and guide me that's truth he's trying to get your life into more truth and more light you actually have to do something true when you hear the voice at church you go out and you do it amen you know what brother Ron my precious brothers and sisters what I love to hear is some testimonies of God leading you and you walking into more truth because that's what the word is for spiritually now naturally is to help you get that new car find out what house you need to be in help figure that one natural thing out right but he has something for you spiritually because those things happen naturally doesn't mean anything's happening the spiritual realm for you and we must learn that the word is to get us to walk in all truth you know it's just like healing healing is a Divine act and power of almighty God and he paid the price for our healing at Calvary yes we could be healed every day and still miss it amen truth and get sick again and die of something so there's an end to those blessings that are in the natural realm Even in our bodies but spiritually see no it's built on a rock it's forever settled in heaven your character brother B say the only thing you're taking with you and we've got to overcome something to gain character so the word spiritual word what makes us a spiritual believer is when we can take the word and we understand that even though it it hurts and and we don't want to do it we know it's the best thing for our souls it's the best thing for our our our character and we're willing to walk into it that's why we come to the house of God well brother John I come for this other reason well I understand that's the bait on the hook that's what brother BR said the healing the bait on the hook attracts the attention attracted the attention of so many ministers they wanted to know brother Bram how do you do it how do you do it why I want about to do that I like to draw that attention to you to you right not even interested getting people of Christ right amen well they don't mind as long as it's through you we're too far down the road this is our relationship we need to get people to him not to us not to look at us not what we did not even what God did through us right Luke chapter 9:23 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me so how can how can we just sit and hear the word and be okay we got to deny ourself if that if we don't have faith to mix in I got to deny myself the word won't do us any good we got to take up the cross daily and then follow him that's truly my sheep hear my voice and follow me amen present your body in other words a living sacrifice and then you're following that's the only way you can prove those that hear his voice and do it will be blessed in their deeds those that hear his voice and don't do it are deceiving themselves the the the terrible thing about this is that they don't know it that's what this message is for to bring an awareness of what happens when we're not interested in making sure that the word that we heard is transpiring in our life the Holy Ghost is God speaking directly to you it it happens in here and when God speaks directly to you something needs to take place life needs to come forth brother raham said in the message hear ye him he says when we receive the Holy Ghost it isn't to jump up and down and to shout with right it isn't just to speak with tongues and run all over the floor it isn't to organize a group and say we've got it the rest of you haven't you ever see people who've been blessed by the Holy Spirit and they don't try to include you everywhere amen it's like they're a special badge that's not what the Holy Ghost is for we've got it the rest of you haven't he says it's to work with love and humility as Christ come to do with if you got the Holy Ghost it's to work love and humility inside of you this will all men know you're my disciples you have love one for another what a beautiful quote is it how many is not enjoying this message I want to see if you were listening you just get you don't want to say every Amen to everything you know blessed we can become so relaxed when we rely on the fact that we got the Holy Ghost some people say and feel that they're so full of the Holy Ghost that it doesn't really matter if they attend church every time the doors are open Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 let us consider one another and to provoke unto love and to good works well what are some of these good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the matter of some is but exhorting one another and so much more today amen than 20 years ago that's right because we see the day approaching it won't be too much longer we're getting sick of it the bride is getting sick of it there ought to be such a hunger and thirst in our hearts to get here on time brother BR says we got to get to the place if we're really where we need to be we can't wait till the doors are open that's right in other words prior to oh I got to get going it's almost Church time right there's like a hunger and a thirst something's been speaking to you prior you you can't wait to get there now that's why God sent a prophet because we can have confidence in what he said people are losing their fire anybody heard of Grace and Gilbert are you going to hear about him today I'm not going to read everything he said but I'm going to read a portion he said I am under the unw conviction that unless I am genuinely ill people are in their Thor of death my legs are rendered inoperable or we are trapped in our house Church attendance is mandatory he says I will not miss it even when I've had to miss it under those circumstances which is quite rare indeed and I I've hated it however for the sake of being completely transparent there that this was not always the case especially early on in my faith there was a point in my life where I consistently worked on Sundays I was a Christian and had been for a couple of years at that point yet I considered myself to be a faithful Christian who was stuck in between a rock in a hard place I had no other means of income than was bringing into my family at the time and my wife worked but we needed both streams of income to make ends meet and care for the newborn and yet there was a steady growing conviction in my heart that I should be coming to church every single Sunday I believe now that's what I love the Holy Ghost for you don't need to pitch fork bad on somebody right because the Holy Spirit Will convict you and if you don't want conviction he'll say okay because he is a gentleman but if there is a desire to please God in your heart conviction will start coming your way while the argument could be made that it was necessary for me to miss due to the circumstances I found myself in the reality was I needed to swallow my pride and get another job that could allow me to attend church on a weekly basis and just be found faithful to come now notice he was blind he thought he was faithful at some point the conviction came to me that church was a non-negotiable what's more than this is that I came to believe Church attendance is non-negotiable for every Christian I love that in other words this is the conviction that was dealing with me personally I couldn't deny it was the Holy Ghost then I could see in the word it's really for everybody isn't that beautiful and that what's important about that is now you know how to pray for other people the reason this is so is that I believe that the New Testament teach is that our time together as Believers in formal corporate worship is to be one of the most precious things we partake of in as Christians he said I believe that the regular attendance is so important that it reveals our hearts and our priorities it reveals much of what we treasure and likewise much of what we don't it especially reveals what we understand about the person of Christ and his saving work upon the cross right then and there is where I lost several of the readers this is one of those areas where many people have to settle in their minds that church attendance is optional right they can't miss here and there without any large repercussions to their spiritual well-being and their own families will not be any worse off either however the reality is that I have never known a casual attend attendee to thrive in any meaningful capacity in other words if you really want to have love joy peace throughout the week you're not going to ever have that staying out of church that's true that shows that God wants you here now that's Church attendance doesn't automatically give you that but you can't have a casual attitude of and expect that God's happy with that I have witness seasons of growth from then from them I have witnessed seasons of growth from them yet I have simultaneously witnessed a stunt growth because invariably they are sporadically absent from the ordinary means God has given them for their maturity encouragement perseverance in the Christian faith more often than this stunt growth there is no growth at all or worse a backsliding of some sorts tell me you all can witness this you you miss a little bit of church now there's like four pages that was only one I need to go on with the message you've all experience how it feels when you miss some church that's right do you ever feel like I'm thriving more I I need to do this more often now when you've gone on vacation for a couple days few days whatever a week you relax and it does you good right I mean if you're a hard worker when the when the men get back from my from their vacation and they're like refreshed they look good I can say to them if this did you good clear out your mind vacation does good for the body but not for the soul true what is really happening to the person who's sitting in church and is content with just hearing the word having no drive to change no desire to be challenged no will or determination to put the word into action we may feel content but God calls it lukewarm true believers who come and hear the word only but never are hot enough to change our lukewarm yes God doesn't want anything to do with that type of relationship he said I'll spew them out of my mouth they're lukewarm and in need of nothing and they don't feel they need to just do it as long as they agree can you imagine Mary saying to the angel of the Lord you're going to have a child and she just says amen amen mentally amen she wanted it she hungered for it be un to me make it happen in my life yes amen well you know it's a good service I enjoyed it you know I got something out of it true I feel like I know a little bit more now about the subject that's good God's here even when we're not here God's here even when this isn't here God is here we may be here here physically but we need to be here spiritually because God is a spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spiritual and they that hear must hear in the spirit we don't want to be caught in a lukewarm State maybe not feeling they need to be ready but they're already ready why do they need anything they're they're already ready there's there's there what they're saying is there is it's not really that necessary because I'm ready God loves me it's just a preacher's opinion the things that we wrestle with good I would never say or entertain thoughts that someone wasn't ready I want to make that state meant or in the state of being ready but here's the thing you should never be Act in like you're in need of nothing never I believe that Paul lived in a state of being ready he said I fought a good fight I've kept the faith I'm ready to be offered he lived in a state of being ready Paul worked non-stop for Jesus Paul was steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord even though Paul lived in that state of being ready you couldn't tell by his attitude that he was ready true boy there's a revelation in that brother Ron he looked like the the the Christian that just came in hungering thirsting I need more of God his attitude was the same as if he wasn't ready what a paradox good brother bam said in the message desperation he says now remember he said keep the token applied and be desperate to press into the kingdom amen that to me is the state of being ready amen now done I'm done I'm there and don't you cross me either because I'll show you right quick that you're not ready Philippians 3:12 we need to hurry because we're only halfway that was just the the foundation you know the problems I have with the foundations all right Philippians chapter 3:12 not as though I've already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I'm apprehended of Jesus Christ Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing do I'm forgetting all my achievements and I'm reaching forth for something more we want to take that scripture and apply it to all the bad things we've done Paul's whole topic is talking about getting somewhere yeah obviously we can't get anywhere if we're so down and upset and bother because of something we did in the past right yeah we need to forget that but the real problem is there's so much pride that's true just accept what you did realize that without Christ we're just beast that's we're just Beast I'm a little bit better beast than you Brother John okay but you're still Beast we must as just accept it I press towards the mark for the real prize not just salvation I'm saved I don't need to press anymore repented got baptized in the message I'm a good Christian Stand Out stand up people look at me they look up to me I'm saved what are the prizes are I got Jesus Christ in my life that is such a carnal natural understanding the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus I like that one Psalm that the fontain sing until I see all of him in me and there's many times at the course of the day I don't see him in me say what are you doing that for what are you thinking that what what I have reason depress amen therefore let us therefore as many as be perfect how many's perfect here come on let me just say this to you you act like it sometimes true the way that you talk negatively down or condenscending or judging but let's just say for a moment you were let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded have the same mind as if you weren't perfect right that's what he's saying here and if anything ye be otherwise minded God shall convict your heart he'll let you know this is so it's okay to not be perfect it's not okay to have an attitude that I am perfect see where it gets you I don't need to work out my salvation anymore fear and trembling I'm already saved well what do you do with he that endureth to the end well I don't know not for me start ripping out part of the Bible and you will not see the picture clear nevertheless where un you have already attained let us walk by the same Rule and let us mind the same thing in other words live the same way as if you didn't attain that makes for a very humble heart Brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example look there is other believers out there who are only interested in themselves they feel like they've apprehended you haven't they're in a state that they're Superior over you they've attained and Paul's saying don't look at them as your example look at look he said first he said look at me and there's others out there that have the same attitude that I'm talking about let them be your example he says for many walk of whom I have told you often and now telling you weeping that they're the enemies of the cross when you don't have this attitude you're an enemy of the Cross even though you claim whose end is destruction whose God is their belly in other words it's all about them it's all about them whose glory is their shame and who mind Earthly things brother brandham said you'll never leave the service the same now many times we've walked out the door feeling the same oh let me say it like this we've walked out the door feeling like nothing happened but brother Brandon makes it clear you'll never leave the service the same as when you came because a decision is always being made when the word is given to you and your attitude or your decision that you make with that will determine your spiritual walk with God we will either become more humble dig in I've got to know you more I've got to I got to have manifested what you just told me I won't rest until I get it I'm going to spend time praying about it talking about it I want it to be part of my life or you'll become more knowledgeable right more intellect and more religious because somehow you've got to act like it even if you don't got it yeah right you one goes negative away from God one goes towards god with every single service there's a decision that's being made verse 25 our opening scripture but who so lookth in the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein be not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed now I just want to spend just a couple minutes if I could talking about being blessed because you heard a pretty strong message Jesus said if you continue in my word then you're my disciples and deed in other words if you don't continue to do what you've heard God is not going to claim you as his disciple it's the doer of the work that shall be blessed I say when the word is being preached just go do it don't rationalize it right don't look for ways not to have to do it be a doer of the word work the word in your life believe it act on it pray about it talk about it and and start to put your foot in the water fall over it doesn't matter start practicing it am God's looking for the attitude of I care about living the word you're going to be blessed in your deed the word will be materialized eventually in your life a few quotes from Brother brand in the message expectation brother BR says say now Jesus said I'll tell you these quotes that I'm reading they were all when I did the study on the on being ready and I just it just God just came right around and said they this word is for them so God doesn't forget and and and and just maybe it just wasn't time we trust that now Jesus said I give them eternal life eternal the word comes from the word Zoe the Greek word which means the life of God well then if we have the life of God in us the born again then we have God's life in us which makes us believe like God does and whatever the word says it will materialize do you see what I'm saying if we're truly believing what we're hearing right it will be happening out there in the message at Thy word brother R says that's it take the word of God and God's spoken word must materialize and produce exactly what it says it will listen the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it the past I don't care what it is if you want corn you plant corn water corn and leave corn alone it will produce corn is that right wheat will produce wheat in the message what think you of Christ brother B says and if the right mental attitude and and if the right mental attitude you just take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God and he said watch it materialize of course you're going to be tried s the devil's going to come to you and say you don't believe that look you fell you went three days and you didn't even think about it yeah yes you're going to have a battle but you get right back up and you say yes but the Lord brought it to my attention amen praise the Lord look how long Mary and and Joseph went didn't realize Jesus with with them he didn't say oh I give up no I went back looking for him in the message questions and answers the question was given please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bride brother Bram said this first conscious controls this body with see taste feel smell and hear and has just got us all scrupled up we reason and everything else but the new body that comes from the born again not the first conscious that passes away but inside something lives everybody understand that say amen amen I don't completely understand it but I'm going to say Amen it's not the outside see taste feel smile and hear it isn't it's subject to death and we will die but inside part of you down here inside the person that cannot die and that's the person that has the new life that starts from the new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life you get it so God is in here he's not going to stay there in a shell he wants to come out he wants to manifest again that's why the word needs to become important to us when we leave here that we heard the God in heaven if I could say it like this is speaking to the god inside of his bride he's expressing his desire from Heaven to man EST in his bride we say Amen to that and we leave here doing it and understand you just can't go live it on your own but you begin by wanting it being serious Being Sober praying about it Lord I believe your word and you're trying not well you know it's too hard I don't feel good don't got time so potent eventually it's here and what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word and the thing is the translation of the Bride will be the same way the word that's in you the word that you've accepted not just heard because when you hear it only you don't accept it spiritually he said the word that's in you the body will materialize around the word word the same as it did by Sarah we have every right to believe the word that we heard on Sunday is going to become part of our life it will materialize it will materialize in your life but if we hear only if we come with that habit of just making it to church and hearing the word but we don't come with I want to live whatever God speaks to me I can't wait to what it is yes it won't be easy for the flesh this gospel is not for your flesh flesh and blood won't inherit the Kingdom we want to live with him right in heaven so somewhere down the line we got to be mature enough to to knock out the Flesh and be interested in what's happening in our nature amen let's Stand Together God bless you for your your patience you see why I couldn't read those other three pages amen can we sing we're standing on Holy Ground okay

we're looking forward to that we want to pray for that service and for all the services and is is Wednesday prayer meeting Wednesday's prayer me how many's excited man we can't pray enough brother brah said do anything too much can't pray too much and uh it is something to help us get back in the closeness with the Lord and uh remember it's not praying In the Flesh the Bible says pray always in the spirit if someone's going to pray for me I want to be in the spirit amen supplications in the spirit because the the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much amen um I believe this would be a good time since the Lord brought it to my my attention um I want us to especially remember our brother Ron Husker um he had told me some time ago that he he's has the uh later stages of postate prostate cancer and uh and the numbers are rising they're doubling and it's it's not a good sign scientifically it's not going in the right direction um and he honestly had no intentions of sharing anything but I asked for permission I asked for his permission after a couple weeks because I believe in the prayers of the Saints I believe in your prayers we may not be the biggest we may not be the baddest the boldest the best anything but we're part of his bride amen and I believe that the bridegroom hears the cries of his wife amen God he's able to do exceedingly above yes sir whatever we ask whatever we can think and I know it seems like a hard situation but we have testimonies amen God is the same yesterday today and forever and I I just it we may not be mentioned a lot but engrave it in your heart to remember our brother in prayer um the reason we don't want to mention a lot is our brother don't want to draw attention to himself just a real humble Spirit um but if it's here the burden's there you know that's what to get the job done and brother Ron before we dismiss and pray just did did I is there anything that you want to add to what I said or to to correct what I said amen for that year amen it's a it's real it's it's real um I just I love to see God move he's the same yesterday forever I I don't I don't want us to think like the doctors I I uh I understand that's what they're saying and it's it's it's statistically there's things that they reasons they say that um but let's believe that God would move in his behalf amen that's right brother Mike praise the Lord he can do it let's believe he will do it let's pray for it on Wednesdays let's pray for all the time that the Lord would bring to your thoughts our our our our precious brother our brother drives a couple hours one way and uh he was starting to come on Wednesdays yes I said whoa let's not overdo this I don't want to he's not used to driving out and here he is he's wanting to praise God with everything he has while the time he has and uh I think God sees his heart to be here on Wednesdays even when he's not here is that that that desire amen God sees when we can't be here amen yes brother R you know in saying what you're saying know I believe that we all believe that we're the one who makes difference we know we are a body we should amen we should have re yes amen that's perfect it's it's like um it's like we need a responsibility take on the responsibility of intercession and it's it's not just for somebody else let's say collectively nor many people we got here and there's people listening just say there's a a total of maybe 40 people that are are combining in this effort to pray for a brother and everybody has one 140th of a part to play all you got to do is play your one part yeah but you think oh there's 39 certainly that'll get the job done I'm not I'm sure you know they'll handle it and it misses out because we didn't play our part and that's I think what our brother's trying to say we have a part to play and we want to make sure we play our part amen amen well the Lord be with you and bless you amen we're be in dism dismissed in prayer amen
