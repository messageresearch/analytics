[39:40] verse and that's Philippians chapter 4
[39:43] verse 19 Philippians chapter 4 verse
[39:47] 19 they kind of go along with
[39:53] our our text today
[39:57] and is a familiar
[39:59] scripture Philippians 4:19 says but my
[40:02] God shall supply all your need according
[40:06] to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus
[40:09] amen amen God is the one that takes care
[40:13] of us
[40:14] amen well there's a lot of problems all
[40:18] over the world Amen we could spend all
[40:20] day talking about the things that are
[40:23] happening all over and we don't know
[40:26] honestly the half of it that's true
[40:30] there's just so many terrible things
[40:31] happening in the world problems that
[40:34] seems like this world is going on a
[40:36] roller coaster
[40:38] down we could talk about those things
[40:41] and we could talk about the things that
[40:43] would make those situations perhaps
[40:46] better but you and I as individuals
[40:49] there's not a whole lot that we could do
[40:52] to change like we would like to see the
[40:55] change in those things
[40:57] I want to focus on the problems that can
[41:00] make a real difference in our personal
[41:02] lives
[41:03] today how many can agree that there's a
[41:06] a lot of stuff a lot of drama that can
[41:09] that goes on in our personal
[41:11] lives
[41:13] amen and I I believe it's something that
[41:16] we could we could focus on today I want
[41:17] to en title this message looking beyond
[41:20] our problems amen and for a subject it's
[41:23] all in your
[41:25] head
[41:26] amen how many times have we heard that
[41:29] that's all in your
[41:30] head often times what you're meaning is
[41:32] that you're you're making that stuff up
[41:35] in your head that's what they're meaning
[41:36] but it's not always the case but I will
[41:39] say this when I say it's all in your
[41:42] head really what I'm saying is that our
[41:44] mind is a dangerous mind
[41:47] field it has the ability to imagine the
[41:50] worst case
[41:53] scenario how many times we've done that
[41:57] it has the ability to dramatically
[41:59] change the reality in our minds to
[42:03] reason why it's it's really okay to not
[42:07] follow all the word of God can you say
[42:10] amen amen yes it it has the ability to
[42:13] leave out important details to to
[42:16] actually to do harmful thing to to
[42:19] actually think ill of others and feel
[42:21] okay with it you ever do that just well
[42:23] they shouldn't have done that so it's
[42:25] it's a dangerous mindfield right
[42:28] here it's the ability to brag and vaun
[42:31] ourselves and be arrogant and selfish
[42:33] and self centered and be okay with
[42:38] it I think these are some
[42:41] things that
[42:43] we can help the change in our lives to
[42:48] make our lives our minds
[42:51] better I believe we can get so caught up
[42:53] in our personal desires that we can EAS
[42:56] easily ignore
[43:00] reality now out in the world it is a
[43:04] massive
[43:07] confusion I don't care what subject you
[43:10] take you get on one side of that
[43:13] subject and then will'll point out
[43:16] things to the other side of the subject
[43:18] that make
[43:19] sense doesn't make what they're doing
[43:22] right but it makes sense and you go over
[43:24] here and they could do the same thing
[43:26] any subject you want anywhere around the
[43:29] world because see Satan is the author of
[43:34] confusion and he wants you just out
[43:36] there spinning your wheels and going
[43:38] nowhere fast but see our mind was not
[43:41] made for
[43:44] that God wants our mind to be at peace
[43:47] to Be steady to be
[43:50] sound but our mind can be a dangerous
[43:53] mind
[43:54] field God God gave
[43:57] us amazing power to make decisions in
[44:00] our mind as long as we make the right
[44:02] decision everything is well but as soon
[44:05] as we begin to make selfish decisions
[44:07] then disaster awaits us amen said that
[44:11] power without character is
[44:15] satanic power with
[44:17] character is to be able to choose God's
[44:21] will over our
[44:23] own but when we take that power that
[44:25] he's given us and choose our will over
[44:29] the word of God that is what's satanic
[44:32] amen are you with me amen the devil
[44:35] wants to get into the thoughts of our
[44:38] mind and begin to manipulate our
[44:41] decisions we've all watched Sports
[44:43] before most of us
[44:46] have and the other team the opponent is
[44:49] always trying to get in the other
[44:52] person's head to manipulate them to you
[44:59] know to get them
[45:01] scared I remember brother Bill telling
[45:03] about a story he used to go to school
[45:05] here in South Lion they had a terrible
[45:08] football team they just were always
[45:10] losing they were playing this real big
[45:11] team and they were down I don't know
[45:13] some great number to nothing something
[45:15] like that and and he's up at the line
[45:18] and the guy from the other team who's
[45:21] bigger and Bolder and and winning looks
[45:24] over at brother Bill and says we coming
[45:28] over to get inside the mine and to
[45:31] manipulate the Devils that's the devil's
[45:35] job said the message is the greatest
[45:37] battle of her fault speaking of God and
[45:39] the devil fight he said there has to be
[45:41] a place selected in this place there's a
[45:43] mutual ground no man's land they fight
[45:46] here at this place they just don't uh
[45:49] they just don't one fight over here and
[45:51] one over there and and run and run here
[45:54] there's a battle where where they meet
[45:56] and test their powers where each Army
[46:00] test its strength against the other a
[46:02] mutual meet meeting place don't miss
[46:06] this he says now this great battle
[46:10] started on
[46:12] Earth there had been a a mutual meeting
[46:15] place there had to be a place
[46:19] selected for the battle to begin and the
[46:22] battle to rage and the battle Grand
[46:24] began in the human mind right this is
[46:28] where the battle starts the human mind
[46:31] was chosen for the place of the battle
[46:34] where it is to begin and that is because
[46:37] that decisions are made in the mind the
[46:46] head the Battlegrounds where you got to
[46:49] meet your enemy is in your mind you've
[46:52] got to make your choice it it it it it
[46:56] meets you and I want this little girl
[46:58] that's very sick here to be sure to
[47:01] listen now to this very closely
[47:05] decisions are made in the mind the head
[47:08] this is where Satan meets you and
[47:10] decisions are because God made man that
[47:13] way if the church right now could be put
[47:16] together and knitted together with such
[47:19] that every person would be in one
[47:21] Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt
[47:24] anywhere there would not be one feeble
[47:27] person in our midst in the next five
[47:29] minutes true amen there would not be
[47:33] nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but
[47:35] what would receive it if you could just
[47:38] get that certain thing
[47:40] fixed and there is where the battle
[47:44] begins right in your
[47:45] mind uh whether you will so we have a
[47:50] power in our mind today we don't have to
[47:53] listen to the devil we don't have to
[47:54] listen we just got to recognize amen
[47:57] that they're not our thoughts that the
[47:58] the enemy puts them there brother
[48:01] Brandon praying at the end of the
[48:03] invasion of the United States he says oh
[48:07] father while the great darkness is on
[48:09] the battle and the devil invading the
[48:12] countries invading the pulpits invading
[48:15] the churches invading the peoples
[48:17] invading the businesses invading the
[48:19] cities and the schools and the homes oh
[48:22] God help us to stand and pull the sword
[48:26] quickly and fight for God as Moses and
[48:29] the Levites did sit down there with sin
[48:31] in the camp help us Lord forgive us now
[48:34] and bless
[48:35] us and keep us humble break us up Lord
[48:41] of Lord oh God you said he that goeth
[48:45] forth sowing tears shall doubtless
[48:47] return again rejoicing bringing with him
[48:50] sheep oh God break us to Pieces mold us
[48:53] a new
[48:54] Lord we're getting too much out of the
[48:59] way out of God's way amen
[49:02] amen stay humble that's how you that's
[49:05] how you beat the
[49:07] devil that's how you beat the devil is
[49:10] humble
[49:12] not because the more you can go like
[49:14] this the more you're going to
[49:16] miss doing what the word wants you to
[49:20] do so the mind of man can be a dangerous
[49:24] mindfield amen uncontrollable unstable
[49:28] wavering back and forth on
[49:32] subjects are you with me
[49:35] amen I I want you this morning to say
[49:39] Amen to the
[49:41] word James 1:6 says for he that waver is
[49:45] like the wave of a sea driven with the
[49:47] wind and tossed for let not that man
[49:50] think that he shall receive anything of
[49:52] the Lord a double-minded man is UN
[49:55] stable in all his
[49:57] ways we've seen people that are just
[50:00] unstable they can't seem to get anywhere
[50:02] in life and it's not because God made
[50:05] them
[50:07] different they just never recognize the
[50:10] Enemy talking to them amen because if
[50:13] the devil can ever get you to think it's
[50:16] God you'll
[50:18] listen but we we've got to try the
[50:21] spirit see because God is not going to
[50:23] author confusion to anybody amen he's
[50:26] going to take somebody in a confused
[50:28] State and bring them out in a sound in a
[50:30] sound mind
[50:32] amen some people are like the weather
[50:35] they changed their mind a
[50:38] lot wherever they're at today you just
[50:41] can't count on it
[50:42] tomorrow they have a hard time following
[50:45] through or being committed with things
[50:47] going from Pillar To Post from this idea
[50:49] to that idea from this person to that
[50:53] person Proverbs 163 three says here's an
[50:56] answer not being negative this morning
[50:59] I'm trying to find answers for our lives
[51:01] amen amen commit thy Works unto the Lord
[51:04] and thy thoughts shall be established
[51:07] that's right commit your ways commit
[51:10] your life remove everything out of the
[51:12] way that isn't this word and walk with
[51:15] the word amen don't well this is how I
[51:19] feel this is get away from that that's
[51:21] where the danger comes in amen we've got
[51:24] to make sure it's the word of
[51:27] God now just as the devil can mess up a
[51:30] man's life God can take that same man's
[51:33] mind and straighten it out that's right
[51:36] he has power God can take the biggest
[51:39] mind mess there is and straighten it out
[51:42] amen amen we need some amens with that
[51:45] one amen because there's no situation
[51:48] that's too too great for our Goden
[51:51] second Timothy 1:7 says for God have not
[51:54] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[51:58] and of love and of a sound
[52:02] mind a sound mind now is really capable
[52:06] of doing the will of the Lord while
[52:09] you're suffering amen but an unsound
[52:12] mind can't do
[52:14] that an unsound mind is not willing to
[52:17] suffer if you just you look at Peter
[52:20] Peter he said oh I'm so sold out to God
[52:24] but when it came down to to the acid
[52:25] test where he had to actually Suffer
[52:28] Well then he started walking away from
[52:31] the word which was walking away from
[52:32] Jesus even denied even swore that he
[52:35] didn't know Jesus Anymore
[52:37] amen because he had not received the
[52:40] spirit of a sound mind and that comes by
[52:43] the Holy Ghost amen comes by it's not a
[52:45] it's not a gift you're born with it's a
[52:48] gift that's it it it's part of the Holy
[52:50] Ghost amen
[52:54] amen A sound mind has the
[52:58] capability of doing God's will when
[53:01] things are stacked against you amen when
[53:04] everyone's against you when you feel
[53:05] alone when things aren't going your way
[53:08] a sound mind can still do the will of
[53:11] God Faithfully through adversity amen
[53:15] that's the why it's so important to have
[53:17] a sound mind amen A sound mind comes
[53:20] from God it does not entertain spirit of
[53:25] fear amen amen it trust in God no matter
[53:29] what I'll say it's easy to serve God on
[53:32] our terms
[53:34] right it's very hard to serve God on his
[53:38] terms his terms are a full commitment to
[53:41] the word our terms is a partial
[53:43] commitment are you with me amen amen
[53:46] that's why just because we're we say
[53:48] we're a Christian we're serving God we
[53:49] got to make sure that that we're making
[53:51] the decisions that the Bible tells us to
[53:53] make amen amen
[53:55] and when a man surrenders his his life
[53:58] to the word of God he chooses to obey
[54:01] the word more than he's been doing God
[54:04] is going to bless him with blessings
[54:06] that he hasn't received yet amen because
[54:09] that's just how God is the more you give
[54:11] God the more that God gives you amen
[54:15] true now who is our Real
[54:23] Enemy now if no body had ever heard the
[54:26] message before they would never get this
[54:30] right thank God that he sent a message
[54:34] amen amen it's not our brother it's not
[54:37] our
[54:38] sister it's not even our
[54:41] pastor amen it's not her wife it's not
[54:45] her husband it's not her neighbor it's
[54:47] not her coworker it's not our
[54:52] boss it's not the other political party
[54:56] it's not the government or our
[55:00] taxes we have the ability to call
[55:04] anything or anyone our enemy who we
[55:08] choose but brother BR said our greatest
[55:10] enemy is ourselves brother R said my
[55:13] greatest enemy is William brandham
[55:17] amen and here's the scripture right here
[55:19] I want to give you for this Romans
[55:23] 8:7 because because the carnal mind is
[55:27] enity against God that means
[55:31] hostile our carnal mind is hostile
[55:34] against
[55:35] God everybody's born with that carnal
[55:38] mind right yes Amen in other words for
[55:41] it is not subject to the law of God
[55:44] neither indeed can it be it's
[55:48] Lawless it just does its own thing
[55:51] uncontrollable hatred against the truth
[55:57] against the will of
[55:59] God in other words it doesn't really
[56:02] want to esteem others better than itself
[56:05] it doesn't want to lay down its life for
[56:07] others it it doesn't want to reach out
[56:09] because it doesn't have enough time to
[56:11] live for
[56:12] itself come
[56:14] on it's the word of God now you
[56:17] understand we all battle the enemy
[56:19] within us amen amen the enemy up here he
[56:22] uses our mind amen
[56:25] the enemy of our carnal mind is what
[56:27] keeps us from obeying what God wants us
[56:30] to do amen and it's always
[56:36] there you come to church and hear the
[56:38] truth and the devil's right there trying
[56:40] to get you to doubt
[56:43] it I'll say it's time to take a
[56:46] stand not against others but against the
[56:50] enemy that's in our
[56:51] mind against the enemy who manipulates
[56:54] our mind to judge others to not care
[56:57] about others to be selfish to be lovers
[57:00] of our own selves and not willing to
[57:02] crucify the flesh how many times have we
[57:04] heard you know you should spend some
[57:05] time praying you should die out you know
[57:08] you shouldn't be acting like that you
[57:09] just kind of Shake It Off I ain't got
[57:11] time maybe
[57:12] later right amen come on we're we're
[57:15] just trying to deal with the reality
[57:17] that happens inside of our minds I want
[57:20] you to take a look at our opening
[57:21] scripture now shall my head my head be
[57:26] lifted up above my enemies that are
[57:32] round about me amen they're circulating
[57:36] inside our head amen trying to get us
[57:39] off track that's the enemy amen it's the
[57:42] Battleground it's where he meets
[57:45] us we need to lift our
[57:49] heads our our the mindset that we're
[57:53] in we need to lift up our heads above
[57:58] the enemy who is trying to get us to
[58:02] lift ourselves amen amen our selfish
[58:06] nature need to lift our our heads out of
[58:09] the carnal state of doubts and fears yes
[58:13] stubbornness and Rebellion
[58:14] procrastination and negativity and those
[58:17] things that we we learn to be content
[58:21] with that is not the Holy Spirit that's
[58:24] the end enemy that has gotten into our
[58:26] minds and that drives us down to a
[58:28] hopeless condition
[58:34] amen 2 Corinthians 10 chapter 4 it says
[58:38] for the weapons of our Warfare they're
[58:41] not carnal amen but they're Mighty
[58:44] through God Amen to the pulling down of
[58:48] strongholds
[58:50] amen we're not choosing to use the
[58:53] weapons that this world uses every
[58:56] day we don't choose to yell and scream
[59:01] and manipulate and hate and give the
[59:05] silent treatment or talk negative give a
[59:08] cold shoulder give a storefront
[59:11] fakeness the list goes on and on we
[59:15] don't choose to use those weapons
[59:17] dealing with
[59:19] others amen not choose these weapons in
[59:22] our mind in fact we pull hold down these
[59:26] strongholds
[59:28] amen we don't yield to the feelings that
[59:30] bring the wrong
[59:34] weapons right if you yield to your
[59:36] feelings you want to straighten them out
[59:40] you're going to let them know nobody
[59:41] talks to you that
[59:45] way I'm telling
[59:48] you power to turn the cheat to go the
[59:52] second mile to give us off all all that
[59:55] is character amen amen am some people
[59:58] may look at that as just a little
[1:00:00] wishy-washy no when you can keep that
[1:00:04] devil from raging in your mind when you
[1:00:07] can lift your head up above that amen
[1:00:10] hallelujah amen right I'd rather have
[1:00:13] that than all the money in the
[1:00:15] world look at verse five casting down
[1:00:20] imaginations right and every High thing
[1:00:23] that exalts itself against what against
[1:00:27] the knowledge of God
[1:00:30] Amen and bring it into captivity every
[1:00:33] thought Amen to obey the word of God
[1:00:37] Amen and having a Readiness to Revenge
[1:00:41] all Disobedience when when you obey the
[1:00:45] word when your obedience becomes
[1:00:47] fulfilled
[1:00:50] right when our mind starts to engage in
[1:00:54] a battle maybe somebody acts wrong
[1:00:56] towards us or says something that upsets
[1:00:59] us the word of God says a soft answer
[1:01:04] turns away raft true right that means
[1:01:07] we've got to cast down every thought
[1:01:10] that says they're wrong or we're right
[1:01:14] or I'm going to prove something you got
[1:01:17] to cast that down you got to lift your
[1:01:20] head up above your enemy amen amen you
[1:01:24] got look beyond your current problem and
[1:01:27] you've got to give that soft answer that
[1:01:30] is the answer to that that's the
[1:01:32] solution to that
[1:01:35] problem see I believe in a I believe
[1:01:39] that we should be putting our time to
[1:01:42] building the character of Jesus Christ
[1:01:44] in our lives amen
[1:01:46] amen because God is not coming back for
[1:01:49] an earth that's in order a world that's
[1:01:52] in order he already made it clear I am
[1:01:55] not of this world and he prayed for us
[1:01:58] and he said we are not of this world
[1:01:59] we're in it but we're not of it and I
[1:02:02] think we're wasting our time if we're
[1:02:03] not building the character of Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ inside of us
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:11] amen we have to make a decision in our
[1:02:14] minds I'm not going to let the devil
[1:02:17] Advance I'm not ignorant of his
[1:02:20] devices if somebody steps on your toe
[1:02:24] you want this thing to escalate step on
[1:02:28] theirs yeah that's
[1:02:31] right but you remember real character is
[1:02:35] being able to do the will of God in
[1:02:37] adversity amen and the will of God
[1:02:40] sometimes can say let me get out of your
[1:02:42] way
[1:02:44] right when he had every intention to
[1:02:46] hurt you let me get out of your
[1:02:50] way all of a sudden you diffuse the
[1:02:52] situation that's right
[1:02:55] will you take that mentality with your
[1:02:57] relationships at home your relationships
[1:02:59] with your spouses your kids those that
[1:03:02] you work with your brothers and sisters
[1:03:04] and I'm telling you it's a reality you
[1:03:06] can look beyond the
[1:03:10] problem and see the answer that God is
[1:03:14] going to supply the need can you say
[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:18] amen now I'll tell you I know this is
[1:03:21] not as enjoyable as sitting and listen
[1:03:23] to a lot of mysteries
[1:03:26] unfold but you know that there's no
[1:03:31] character there's nothing you have to do
[1:03:33] except listen and
[1:03:35] enjoy you can know all the Mysteries and
[1:03:37] it one profit anything the Bible
[1:03:41] says you could hear a great sermon feel
[1:03:44] really really good you heard one last
[1:03:45] Sunday I
[1:03:47] trust but I I
[1:03:50] believe that God wants us to be
[1:03:52] Overcomers amen amen the promise to
[1:03:55] making a Rapture is overcoming all
[1:03:58] things and and the enemy is not out here
[1:04:03] it's no I like this person a little bit
[1:04:06] more than I like that one or I get along
[1:04:08] with this one more than that one you
[1:04:10] know that is just nonsense
[1:04:13] thinking what we need is to love
[1:04:16] everyone amen and we need to hate
[1:04:19] ourselves
[1:04:21] amen I'm talking about that car own
[1:04:24] nature
[1:04:26] right I that's what I'm talking about
[1:04:29] that that that man that gets in the way
[1:04:32] and says I don't have to do the will of
[1:04:34] God
[1:04:36] yeah when our mind start to engage in a
[1:04:38] battle and the devil tells us that we
[1:04:41] don't have to follow through with
[1:04:43] everything the Bible
[1:04:46] said or everything the message
[1:04:53] said when the devil tries to exalt my
[1:04:57] reasoning above the word of
[1:04:59] God you know what I'm going to bring
[1:05:02] every thought into captivity amen I'm
[1:05:06] going to say this does not pass the word
[1:05:08] test
[1:05:11] amen because what the devil's trying to
[1:05:13] do is stir up a problem in my life he's
[1:05:17] trying to Calla
[1:05:19] something and if I listen to
[1:05:22] him and I start to just compromise with
[1:05:25] the Bible over here or compromise with
[1:05:27] the Bible over here compromise my prayer
[1:05:30] life if you begin to compromise you're
[1:05:33] just you're you're you're standing in a
[1:05:35] mindfield anything's going to happen
[1:05:38] amen so we need to take a stand against
[1:05:41] the devil we need to lift up our head
[1:05:45] above where the enemy wants us to
[1:05:49] be bring those thoughts into captivity
[1:05:52] bring them down call them mouth this is
[1:05:55] not the truth these thoughts are theil
[1:05:57] you know we're so afraid to call out the
[1:05:59] devil in our own mind I don't understand
[1:06:02] that as if we're so perfect and we don't
[1:06:04] get thoughts from the devil or
[1:06:07] something true but we have no problem
[1:06:10] calling out the devil out here right all
[1:06:13] over
[1:06:15] here look the devil's the devil here as
[1:06:18] well as
[1:06:19] anywhere the difference you know here's
[1:06:21] the thing you don't go out and murder
[1:06:23] anybody right
[1:06:24] because you wouldn't let the even and
[1:06:26] the devil has probably told us all
[1:06:28] that he's told us so many things that we
[1:06:31] have not done right we know that's the
[1:06:34] devil but he tells us things that we do
[1:06:37] do that's right and that's what this is
[1:06:41] for this this service today is to help
[1:06:44] us not
[1:06:45] listen to recognize it's the devil and
[1:06:49] to get our head above that type of
[1:06:51] thinking amen David said I will I lift
[1:06:54] my head above my
[1:06:56] enemy I'm not going to stay down here
[1:07:00] with the
[1:07:01] chickens not going to stay down
[1:07:04] here God has called me to be an
[1:07:07] eagle to Fly Above these things I'm a
[1:07:10] Believer in the word of God
[1:07:13] Amen I'm going to tell the devil it is
[1:07:15] written I have decided to live by every
[1:07:18] word of God Amen that's a choice we must
[1:07:22] make that's back up by faith in other
[1:07:25] words we're not just saying it because
[1:07:28] the devil knows whether you mean it or
[1:07:29] not
[1:07:31] amen we got to trust that God's really
[1:07:34] going to supply our need right
[1:07:36] now right now brother bam said in the
[1:07:40] message seeking after Jesus he's
[1:07:43] speaking under the discernment here he
[1:07:46] says you're suffering with a nervous
[1:07:49] break isn't that right lady laying there
[1:07:52] in the cot isn't that true true a
[1:07:54] nervous break he says Don't Let The
[1:07:58] Devil defeat you if you have faith
[1:08:01] tonight you can go home and be
[1:08:07] well in the message the resurrection
[1:08:10] brother Brandon says do you know the
[1:08:12] word of God will defeat Satan anywhere
[1:08:15] anytime night or day any place the
[1:08:18] written
[1:08:20] word amen God's going to back up his
[1:08:22] word don't you believe that Amen in the
[1:08:25] message
[1:08:26] expectation now and now you remember
[1:08:30] that you don't have to wait for an
[1:08:32] Evangelistic service or a person coming
[1:08:35] through the prayer a person coming
[1:08:37] through praying for the sick he says you
[1:08:41] have a right to it yourself
[1:08:46] amen remember gifts and callings are
[1:08:49] wonderful but remember here is the
[1:08:51] greatest thing that God gave the world
[1:08:53] outside of Jesus Christ is the Bible am
[1:08:57] do you know what the word of God will
[1:09:00] defeat the Devil any place anywhere
[1:09:03] anytime on his own ground did you know
[1:09:06] that the word of God Alone Jesus made it
[1:09:11] so simple until the weakest Christian
[1:09:14] could do it amen amen think about it now
[1:09:18] nobody in here is the weakest Christian
[1:09:20] on the on the
[1:09:22] planet so I don't care what your
[1:09:24] situation is if you just simply do what
[1:09:27] the prophet
[1:09:31] said if you just do what the word
[1:09:34] says stop listening to the devil
[1:09:40] amen if you don't take a stand for him
[1:09:43] somebody else ain't going to get inside
[1:09:44] of you and take a
[1:09:46] stand you've got to do
[1:09:49] it you're the only one that can help
[1:09:51] your
[1:09:52] mind I'm the only one that can help my
[1:09:55] mind you can sit here and encourage me
[1:09:58] all day long but I still got to leave
[1:10:00] these doors and go out there and make my
[1:10:02] own decisions when thoughts come to
[1:10:05] me in the message Jesus Christ the same
[1:10:08] yesterday today and forever brother BR
[1:10:10] says and let me say this now that the
[1:10:12] word of God will defeat the Devil
[1:10:13] anywhere any time or any place he will
[1:10:15] defeat the Devil and the right mental
[1:10:18] attitude this is in your mind now
[1:10:22] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:10:24] bring it to pass amen amen if you can
[1:10:28] look at it the way that God wrote it and
[1:10:30] accept it in your heart God will make
[1:10:33] the word become life amen now that's a
[1:10:38] reality that's reality that's when the
[1:10:40] word becomes real to you

[1:10:55] first
[1:10:57] first we must learn to defeat the Devil
[1:11:00] in our own
[1:11:01] minds were the greatest battles ever
[1:11:04] fought I wouldn't be worrying about the
[1:11:06] battle of
[1:11:08] Armageddon I'd be paying more attention
[1:11:11] to the Battle of doubts that rage in our
[1:11:13] own mind amen Ephesians chapter 6 ver 10
[1:11:17] very Frome your scripture we all know
[1:11:19] this but I think it'd be encouraging to
[1:11:20] us to read it finally my brethren be
[1:11:23] strong strong in the Lord and in the
[1:11:26] power of His might put on the whole
[1:11:30] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:11:33] stand against the Ws of the devil
[1:11:38] amen he's certainly wild isn't he amen
[1:11:41] for we don't wrestle against one another
[1:11:45] right but against principalities against
[1:11:49] Powers against the rulers of the
[1:11:51] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:11:55] wickedness in high places you know the
[1:11:57] people are going around the world
[1:11:58] they're getting up many of them even go

[1:12:59] and we need the shoeld of
[1:13:01] faith and we need the helmet of
[1:13:05] salvation amen and the sword of the
[1:13:07] spirit which is the word of God we need
[1:13:10] to we unfortunately we have to call the
[1:13:12] devil out

[1:13:19] anything unless God allows it God has
[1:13:22] allowed the devil to talk to
[1:13:27] mankind that means we must learn our
[1:13:30] enemy learn when he's trying to bring
[1:13:32] confusion learn when he's trying to get
[1:13:34] us away from doing God's Will and call
[1:13:37] him out and say it is written I'm
[1:13:40] staying with the word
[1:13:44] amen Satan comes by and he starts to
[1:13:47] question our identity like we're not
[1:13:50] really saved like we're not really a
[1:13:53] Christian Christian we need to lift our
[1:13:55] heads above the enemy that's around
[1:13:57] about us with all these thoughts and
[1:14:00] tell them it's written I'm a Son of God
[1:14:04] I'm a child of the king I'm covered by
[1:14:06] the blood amen I belong to him in fact
[1:14:11] the Bible tells me I'm a chosen
[1:14:12] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:14:14] nation A peculiar people I've been
[1:14:17] washed by the blood
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:25] I'm going to lift my head up and look

[1:15:01] our feet are in Solid Ground here this
[1:15:04] is God's
[1:15:08] house you know God had to kick Satan out
[1:15:10] of heaven right sometimes we got to kick
[1:15:14] him out of our house that's right amen
[1:15:18] all brother brother bman I hope it's
[1:15:21] okay just sharing this number of times
[1:15:22] he's made a mention of a little
[1:15:25] testimony when he'd go into a restaurant
[1:15:27] and they would be using foul language
[1:15:29] and carrying on in a wrong way and and
[1:15:33] the god inside of uh him would rise up
[1:15:35] and say I don't have to listen to this
[1:15:38] yeah and just rebuke that
[1:15:43] spirit and then his testimony was and
[1:15:45] then I notice they never said another
[1:15:47] word or one time they said at one time
[1:15:49] and that was it see God honors faith
[1:15:53] amen and there's a
[1:15:55] reality Satan will try to get to us any
[1:15:59] way he
[1:16:00] can now we can spend our time looking at
[1:16:04] all the problems that are happening in
[1:16:05] the world or we can just lift up our
[1:16:08] heads above that
[1:16:12] am Jesus said when these things begin to
[1:16:16] come to pass all the problems that are
[1:16:18] happening in the world when these things
[1:16:21] begin to come to pass what things
[1:16:24] as it was in the days of Sodom gomorra
[1:16:27] so shall it be in the second coming of
[1:16:29] the Lord right as it was in the days of

[1:17:19] to happen the next 10 years from now if
[1:17:21] God would carry amen
[1:17:25] second Peter 3:3 knowing this first that
[1:17:28] there shall come in the last days
[1:17:30] scoffers walking after their own desires

[1:17:42] coming Amen brother for since the
[1:17:44] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[1:17:46] as they were from the beginning of the
[1:17:48] creation amen but what an attitude not
[1:17:52] being able to see the hour that they're
[1:17:54] living
[1:17:55] in the bible promises this bible
[1:17:58] promises that in this day that we're
[1:18:01] living that there's going to be a great
[1:18:02] Falling Away
[1:18:04] righten second Timothy 3:1 says know
[1:18:07] this that in the last days perilous time

[1:19:12] which are coming on the earth for the
[1:19:16] powers of Heaven shall be shaken I'll
[1:19:18] tell you I don't think the problem I
[1:19:21] believe if the people on this planet
[1:19:23] would stop
[1:19:25] looking at all the bad things that are
[1:19:27] going on I don't think they would be
[1:19:30] their hearts would be failing so much
[1:19:31] for
[1:19:34] fear if they would just simply go to
[1:19:36] church and read their Bible instead
[1:19:38] every time they get a bad thought have
[1:19:40] to go to church read your
[1:19:43] Bible that would straighten things up
[1:19:46] around
[1:19:47] here verse 35 as a
[1:19:51] snare
[1:19:53] anxiety right is going to come on all
[1:19:57] them that dwell on the face of the whole
[1:20:02] earth verse 28 and when these things

[1:20:27] above your enemy that's trying to make
[1:20:29] you look at those things our Redemption
[1:20:32] is closer than what we
[1:20:34] realize look up and beyond our problems
[1:20:37] Jesus is the answer the Bible says that
[1:20:40] my God shall supply all of your
[1:20:43] need
[1:20:45] that's all of your
[1:20:48] need not by your ability not by your
[1:20:51] bank account
[1:20:54] not by your
[1:20:55] talent not by your
[1:21:00] popularity it's through Jesus Christ
[1:21:02] that every need is met in our lives amen
[1:21:06] amen I will lift up my head beyond my
[1:21:11] problems now shall my head be lifted up
[1:21:14] above my enemy round about me the
[1:21:17] thoughts that are circulating round in
[1:21:19] my mind that happen so often that devil
[1:21:22] gets in there he looks for a little
[1:21:24] crack and he gets in
[1:21:27] there the thoughts that are trying to
[1:21:29] bring me down or discourage me or
[1:21:31] depress me or thoughts that are are
[1:21:33] trying to build an anxiety or or get me
[1:21:36] to be too busy or I I I I just don't got
[1:21:38] time to wait on the Lord I got too much
[1:21:41] going on to serve other people I am
[1:21:43] telling you that's nothing but the devil
[1:21:45] you got to recognize it amen it's time
[1:21:47] to turn things
[1:21:51] around for in the time of trouble shall
[1:21:54] he hide me in his pilion in the secret
[1:21:56] of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he
[1:21:58] shall set me up upon a rock this word is
[1:22:02] the
[1:22:04] rock he's pointing us to the word of
[1:22:08] God Psalms 912 says now I will say of
[1:22:13] the Lord he is my refuge he is my
[1:22:16] Fortress in him will I trust I can't
[1:22:20] overcome the thoughts in my mind I can't
[1:22:22] in that's
[1:22:24] right amen when he comes in like a flood
[1:22:27] the Bible says that God will raise up a
[1:22:29] standard
[1:22:30] amen I can do all things through Christ
[1:22:34] who strengthen me amen because he set me
[1:22:38] upon a
[1:22:41] revelation I don't have to
[1:22:44] listen the devil's allowed to go out
[1:22:46] there and do his stuff but he's not
[1:22:48] allowed in here I got power I got
[1:22:52] control
[1:22:54] if you can control your mind you got a
[1:22:56] good chance you can help somebody
[1:22:59] amen but if you can't control your own
[1:23:02] mind how are you going to help
[1:23:05] somebody we can resist the devil in our
[1:23:08] mind the Bible says resist the devil and
[1:23:10] he'll flee
[1:23:14] amen I can do this because there's
[1:23:17] somebody inside of me that's greater
[1:23:20] than he that's in the world do you
[1:23:21] believe that amen amen
[1:23:23] the Devil he's always trying to break us
[1:23:25] down 1 John chapter
[1:23:28] 4 this the be first three verses we went
[1:23:31] over this but there's a there's Spirits
[1:23:33] out there that are trying to get us to
[1:23:35] compromise right trying to to to to to
[1:23:40] show that the days of Miracles are
[1:23:42] passed that that God doesn't really heal
[1:23:44] that God doesn't really perform Miracles
[1:23:48] anymore that God uh cannot deliver that
[1:23:51] that you if you got a vice it's there
[1:23:54] with you forever I mean there are many
[1:23:57] many spirits out there that refuse to be
[1:24:03] manifested in the
[1:24:05] flesh and verse
[1:24:07] four says that you are of God little
[1:24:11] children and have overcome them them
[1:24:16] Spirits right because that's what we're
[1:24:18] talking about beloved believe not every
[1:24:21] spirit and youve overcome them how
[1:24:25] because greater is he that is in you
[1:24:29] than he that is in the world Amen that's
[1:24:32] how you overcome the devil in your mind
[1:24:35] right there Amen to whom you yield
[1:24:38] yourself servant to obey his servant you
[1:24:41] are amen amen right verse five they are
[1:24:44] of the world and they speak of the world
[1:24:48] and you know what the World Hears
[1:24:50] them but we are of
[1:24:53] God he that knoweth God heareth us he
[1:24:57] that is not of God heareth not us hereby
[1:25:01] know we the spirit of truth and the
[1:25:04] spirit of error that's right I'm so glad
[1:25:07] that we have the
[1:25:08] Bible I cannot imagine being in the
[1:25:10] world where you got people all around
[1:25:13] the globe saying God told me to tell you
[1:25:18] this and they all contradict one another
[1:25:20] that's what really got me when I was
[1:25:22] going to a denominational
[1:25:25] Church by the grace of God there was
[1:25:27] just something dealing with me inside
[1:25:29] that I was lost no matter if I was going
[1:25:30] to church or
[1:25:32] not amen and I would hear this about
[1:25:36] this church I I go to this church and I
[1:25:38] hear about that
[1:25:41] church and they're all
[1:25:44] claiming they got the
[1:25:46] truth but there can only be one truth
[1:25:50] amen only one truth
[1:25:53] and something inside spoke as clear as
[1:25:55] could be I am not in the church I am in
[1:25:58] my word amen and from that moment this
[1:26:04] became my amen I attached my soul to
[1:26:08] this and not a church
[1:26:10] amen and it's never changed I haven't
[1:26:13] changed it since that
[1:26:16] time I'm so glad that we have God's word
[1:26:19] amen amen it wasn't written by just
[1:26:23] men Bible says holy men of old were
[1:26:26] moved on by the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:26:29] Ghost wrote the word amen that's why we
[1:26:31] can have confidence when we read it it
[1:26:33] is God speaking to us amen amen amen
[1:26:39] Psalms
[1:26:42] 21121 I hope to get through this quickly
[1:26:46] but you know how that
[1:26:51] goes I try to outsmart
[1:26:53] myself what do I mean by
[1:26:56] that you know the Bible says study to
[1:26:58] show thyself
[1:27:00] approved well the more I study the more
[1:27:02] notes I
[1:27:03] get the more time I put into it the more
[1:27:06] pages I get
[1:27:09] am so I try to like fake myself out work
[1:27:13] on other
[1:27:17] things Psalms 121:1 I will lift up my
[1:27:21] eyes to the hills amen from whence
[1:27:24] cometh my help my Help Cometh From The
[1:27:28] Lord am which made Heaven and Earth I
[1:27:32] will not suffer thy foot to be moved he
[1:27:34] that keepeth thee will not Slumber
[1:27:36] that's right behold that keepeth Israel
[1:27:39] shall neither slumber nor sleep that is
[1:27:42] right we know one thing we can ignore we
[1:27:45] can forget what's going on in Israel we
[1:27:47] can doubt what's going on but I'll tell
[1:27:49] you what God's got his eye on Israel
[1:27:52] amen amen The Lord Is Thy keeper The
[1:27:55] Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand
[1:27:58] the sun shall not smite thee by day nor
[1:28:00] the Moon by Night the Lord shall
[1:28:02] preserve thee from all
[1:28:05] evil look at that
[1:28:09] promise he shall preserve thy Soul the
[1:28:12] Lord shall preserve thy going out thy
[1:28:15] coming in from this time forth and even
[1:28:17] forever more amen praise the Lord amen
[1:28:22] God be with us who could be against us
[1:28:24] we got to remember that no matter what
[1:28:26] thoughts are going on in here there's a
[1:28:28] God that's greater amen amen not mind
[1:28:31] over
[1:28:32] matter not you know my mind no God is
[1:28:37] with me I'm trusting you Lord I'm not
[1:28:39] listening to that amen sometimes that's
[1:28:41] hard the thought comes you know what if
[1:28:43] you just start singing a song Start
[1:28:45] quoting the
[1:28:47] scripture get your mind on doing
[1:28:49] something for somebody before you know
[1:28:51] it but you get lifted up above those
[1:28:54] things because there's a reality when
[1:28:56] you put God first in your
[1:28:59] life 1 Timothy chapter 6 if you want to
[1:29:02] turn with me there's a big trick that
[1:29:06] Satan gets a lot of Believers in is to
[1:29:09] go after other things to get your life
[1:29:11] involved in other things do you believe
[1:29:14] that I mean we we need to be making time
[1:29:17] for
[1:29:19] God but we're just
[1:29:22] I the more gadgets we get more
[1:29:25] microwaves
[1:29:28] phones everything more we get the more
[1:29:32] it seems like we're we're we're busier
[1:29:35] now we're busier now I used to be less
[1:29:38] busy when I when I first came to the
[1:29:40] Lord I was less busy right I love that
[1:29:43] life right and back then I can
[1:29:46] imagine I can imagine in the 70s
[1:29:49] watching a John Wayne movie and saying
[1:29:50] man can you imagine back then not having
[1:29:52] any
[1:29:55] phones just on a horse just going
[1:30:02] along the devil wants to get us
[1:30:05] busy First Timothy chapter 6 verse 6 but
[1:30:09] godliness with
[1:30:11] contentment is great gain yes great gain
[1:30:18] amen for we brought nothing into this
[1:30:21] world and cly we can carry nothing
[1:30:24] out and having food and Remnant that's
[1:30:27] right let us be there withth
[1:30:30] content but they that will be rich not
[1:30:34] necessarily just just money but going
[1:30:37] after something right just money buys
[1:30:39] you
[1:30:40] anything but they that will be rich fall
[1:30:42] into temptation and a snare into many
[1:30:45] foolish and hurtful
[1:30:48] desires which they actually drown men
[1:30:51] spiritually now into destruction and
[1:30:55] predition you talk about your mind being
[1:30:57] a landmine a dangerous L
[1:31:00] landine For the Love of Money is the
[1:31:04] root of all
[1:31:06] evil you've all seen shows
[1:31:09] before where they steal the money they
[1:31:13] get this
[1:31:14] money they look at one
[1:31:18] another we could retire we could change
[1:31:20] our life
[1:31:22] right right nobody will know we'll split
[1:31:25] it just by their eyes looking at
[1:31:29] it true the devil has a way of coming
[1:31:32] into our mind and getting us to go after
[1:31:35] things when the word says be content
[1:31:38] amen be
[1:31:41] content for the love of money is the
[1:31:44] root of all
[1:31:45] evil which while some coveted after they
[1:31:49] have aired from the most important thing
[1:31:53] the
[1:31:54] faith and Pierce themselves through with
[1:31:57] many Sorrows amen but thou oh man of God
[1:32:05] flee these things right now if I told
[1:32:08] you there was a fire in here get out of
[1:32:10] here flee you wouldn't be
[1:32:13] sin H are you sure brother
[1:32:16] John I I want to consider being rich for
[1:32:19] a
[1:32:20] moment
[1:32:22] things would my life would be
[1:32:26] easier blee these things and follow
[1:32:30] after righteousness godliness Faith love
[1:32:34] patience
[1:32:36] meekness fight the good flight of
[1:32:39] Faith lay hold of eternal life amen
[1:32:42] where
[1:32:43] unto where unto Thou Art also called and
[1:32:48] has professed a good profession before
[1:32:50] many witnesses
[1:32:52] God is trying to lay his word into our
[1:32:56] hearts this morning now Satan is trying
[1:32:59] to get us to doubt it
[1:33:02] amen so we need to keep fighting we need
[1:33:05] to to lay hold of each brother John
[1:33:08] already have eternal
[1:33:09] life if I understand what Jesus meant he
[1:33:13] said my words are spirit and they are
[1:33:16] life amen amen and to me I don't have
[1:33:19] all his word amen because I the only way
[1:33:22] I can get all his word is to have it
[1:33:25] revealed to me by God himself
[1:33:27] amen so I want to lay hold of more word
[1:33:31] for my
[1:33:33] life his words are spirit and they are
[1:33:38] truth that was my last scripture but I
[1:33:42] want to read a quote if I could from the
[1:33:43] greatest battle ever
[1:33:46] fall brother bam says it must be
[1:33:49] accepted in the mind
[1:33:52] speaking of the word now the word that
[1:33:54] we hear the word we heard this morning
[1:33:57] it must be accepted in our mind then it
[1:33:59] is believed with our
[1:34:03] heart then the word of God becomes a
[1:34:08] reality then every sense of the soul in
[1:34:11] the body is just scoured out with the
[1:34:14] Holy
[1:34:17] Spirit then you your sense of God and
[1:34:20] your consciousness of God and
[1:34:22] everything that's Godly it just flows
[1:34:25] through you right there's not a doubt
[1:34:28] anywhere there's nothing that can rise
[1:34:33] up but when it comes to reality your
[1:34:37] mind opens it up your mind either
[1:34:40] accepts it or rejects it that's it
[1:34:43] friends now he says God let none of them
[1:34:48] miss
[1:34:49] it see it's your mind that opens up the
[1:34:53] door or closes the door right yeah and
[1:34:56] listens to your conscience and listens
[1:34:58] to your memory and listens to your
[1:35:00] affections but when your mind closes
[1:35:02] itself to those things and let God the
[1:35:05] Holy Spirit of his word come in it blows
[1:35:08] the rest of that stuff out amen every
[1:35:10] doubt is gone every fear is gone every
[1:35:13] sensation is gone every feeling is gone
[1:35:16] there's nothing standing there but the
[1:35:17] word of God and S Satan can't battle
[1:35:20] against it am knows sir he cannot battle
[1:35:24] against
[1:35:25] it now we know that's the truth amen
[1:35:29] these battles have raged since the day
[1:35:32] of the Garden of Eden that battle in the
[1:35:34] human mind Satan started it yes what did
[1:35:38] he do uh what did he do when he met Eve
[1:35:42] yes he didn't deny God's word he just
[1:35:44] whitewashed it amen he got her to just a
[1:35:49] little bit consider
[1:35:52] we don't want that we want to cast down
[1:35:55] all reasoning amen let's Stand Together
[1:35:58] amen praise the lord we want to lift up
[1:36:01] our heads above our
[1:36:09] problems you've heard the story of mind
[1:36:12] is a terrible thing to
[1:36:16] waste an idle mind is a Devil's
[1:36:20] Playground
[1:36:24] we need to use our
[1:36:28] mind to win the greatest battle that was
[1:36:30] ever
[1:36:34] fall engage in the the reality that I'm
[1:36:38] going to be a manifested son or daughter
[1:36:40] of God that I am going to bring forth
[1:36:44] more of Christ in my life this week this
[1:36:48] month this year than I did last
[1:36:53] that it's a reality that if nobody in
[1:36:55] this
[1:36:56] church has that mind made up my mind's
[1:37:00] made up if nobody in my family has that
[1:37:03] in their mind I've made my mind up
[1:37:07] because when it comes to us God deals
[1:37:10] with us as
[1:37:15] individuals two will be in the bed one
[1:37:17] will be taken two will be grinding two
[1:37:20] will be working one will be one will be
[1:37:23] taken and one will be
[1:37:30] left we can't change the world but we
[1:37:33] can change our lives amen God's with us
[1:37:37] to help us through it let this word stay
[1:37:41] in your heart meditate upon it pray
[1:37:44] about it just ask the Lord
[1:37:47] Jesus Keep unfolding it through the week
[1:37:50] and amen and and try to put little
[1:37:53] things into
[1:37:54] practice right take take take the real
[1:37:56] little things when when some you don't
[1:37:59] put the salt shaker where it's got to
[1:38:02] go you know what I'm trying to say that
[1:38:05] it's it's amazing you know this is the
[1:38:07] truth it's amazing how simple and small
[1:38:11] a problem is that the devil can actually
[1:38:13] get into and make it such a wide problem
[1:38:16] true he doesn't ever come in like this
[1:38:18] yeah you but he starts with those little
[1:38:20] things that you know pushes your button
[1:38:23] amen let's let's look to the Lord in a
[1:38:25] word of prayer your
[1:38:28] desire is to to see this word manifested
[1:38:31] and you just keep it before the Lord as

[1:39:28] your
[1:39:29] remance bring your word to our
[1:39:32] remembrance Lord when the enemy begins
[1:39:34] to engage in our
[1:39:37] minds trying to get us off
[1:39:41] track Lord may you help us not only to
[1:39:44] recognize the
[1:39:46] enemy but help us to fight that good
