[36:04] and uh it it's as you could see it there
[36:07] and i got it
[36:08] here too um
[36:12] so he he got away the dog chased him

[36:20] i believe it was we're looking for him

[36:23] couldn't really corral him and then
[36:27] we just gave up because we couldn't find
[36:29] him he just went all over the neighbors
[36:31] across the street
[36:32] so we our neighbor called after he went
[36:36] to a number of neighbors trying to
[36:38] figure out who this goat belongs to
[36:40] and we just felt that the lord wanted us
[36:44] to connect with our neighbors
[36:46] so we've been connecting with our
[36:47] neighbors here of late
[36:50] so he was cornered in this little area
[36:53] about
[36:53] this big and there's about this much
[36:57] area to get on and off this little deck
[36:59] here

[40:16] i just had that in my heart to want to
[40:19] to share
[40:20] a thanksgiving to you amen before we
[40:23] begin reading here matthew 22
[40:26] let's look to the author and ask his
[40:29] blessings
[40:30] heavenly father lord we've all been
[40:33] raised in schools to bow to read and
[40:37] and have understanding about the words
[40:41] that are
[40:41] in the dictionaries and how to use them
[40:44] but
[40:45] lord we know that this is a heavenly
[40:48] language
[40:49] your book is written as a love letter
[40:53] and we need the holy
[40:56] spirit to come and inspire it to us
[41:00] to reveal what it is
[41:04] that could help us be ready for a
[41:07] rapture
[41:08] to come more into your image ultimately
[41:11] stand next to your side as as your bride
[41:14] in heaven
[41:16] lord we're looking forward to that as we
[41:18] see the world falling apart
[41:20] just looking forward to to leaving
[41:23] getting out of here we pray
[41:24] lord that you bless our eyes to see or
[41:27] our
[41:27] ears to hear our heart to understand
[41:31] that we might grow in your grace and
[41:32] your love come bless
[41:34] your word now to our hearts and
[41:37] may your holy spirit be felt by each and
[41:39] every one here we pray
[41:41] we thank you for these things lord we
[41:43] pray in jesus christ's name
[41:45] amen amen matthew
[41:48] chapter 22 starting with verse number 12
[41:51] and he saith unto him friend how came is
[41:55] thou and hither
[41:57] not having a wedding garment
[42:00] and he was speechless then said the king
[42:03] to the servants bind him hand and foot
[42:07] take him away and cast him to outer
[42:09] darkness
[42:10] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[42:13] teeth
[42:15] for many are called but few are chosen
[42:20] god bless you may be seated i'd like to
[42:22] entitle this message
[42:24] considering the cost of being chosen
[42:27] and for a subject god is calling
[42:29] everyone but is only
[42:30] choosing a few now we understand that
[42:34] the scriptures that we
[42:35] have been elected we've been predestined
[42:38] we've been chosen before the foundation
[42:40] of the world
[42:41] this is a true statement but there is a
[42:44] cost
[42:45] to really being chosen and i know the
[42:47] enemy would like
[42:48] nothing more than for us to just believe
[42:51] since we're in the message that it is an
[42:53] automatic thing
[42:56] but we have some scriptures to help us
[42:59] and
[43:00] my my desire is really um
[43:03] to provoke us to dig deeper
[43:06] into the lord the lord knows how
[43:09] to get us ready the lord knows what we
[43:12] need
[43:13] i don't we don't know what one another
[43:15] needs
[43:16] that's true are you with me we're not
[43:18] god we're
[43:19] god builds the church but i do know this
[43:23] that
[43:24] we open the door for god to speak to us
[43:26] more when we begin to hunger and thirst
[43:29] for god
[43:29] amen that's right so many are called
[43:33] fewer chosen everyone gets a chance but
[43:36] god has the final
[43:38] say so in who he chooses in this little
[43:40] opening scripture here
[43:42] um the question comes asked by jesus
[43:46] friend friend friend calls him a friend
[43:48] how did you get here but he wasn't a
[43:49] close enough friend to keep him there
[43:54] a friend but this friend couldn't say
[43:56] because he
[43:57] he wasn't prepared for the wedding
[44:00] supper
[44:01] and so he gets he gets cast out into
[44:04] outer
[44:05] uh into outer darkness i believe that it
[44:08] says this
[44:09] um yes there shall be weeping and
[44:12] nationalities we're
[44:13] representing here tribulation are you
[44:16] with me
[44:17] okay this is the hour that we are
[44:20] approaching
[44:21] so we want to consider the cost of being
[44:24] chosen because this
[44:25] this person did not have the wedding
[44:27] garment on right
[44:28] and it wasn't because uh it wasn't
[44:31] handed to him like this
[44:33] because the garment is is saying there's
[44:36] the garment go get it
[44:39] his bride have made herself ready she
[44:42] has to go
[44:42] after it after the word and get dressed
[44:45] amen
[44:47] luke chapter 14 verse 25.
[44:52] and there were great multitudes with him
[44:54] and he turned and he said unto them if
[44:56] any man come after me and hate not his
[44:59] father and his mother and his wife his
[45:00] children
[45:01] brother and his sister jay and his own
[45:04] life also he cannot be my disciple and
[45:07] whosoever not bear his cross
[45:08] come after me cannot be my disciple for
[45:11] which of you
[45:11] intend to build a tower sitteth not down
[45:14] first
[45:15] and counter the cost whether it be
[45:18] sufficient to finish it
[45:19] less happily after you've laid the
[45:21] foundation and is not able to finish it
[45:24] all that behold it began to mock at him
[45:28] saying
[45:28] this man began to build and was not able
[45:31] to
[45:32] finish how many times have you
[45:35] been in a situation to where you said
[45:38] i'm going to go do this
[45:39] i'm going to build i'm going to put this
[45:40] addition i'm going to buy this car i'm
[45:42] going to
[45:42] i'm going to go over here i'm going to
[45:44] go on this little trip i'm going to do
[45:45] this
[45:46] and you find out that you didn't have
[45:48] all the money that you really wanted to
[45:49] finish it
[45:50] right and and basically
[45:54] the wise thing to do would be to
[45:56] consider the cost of whatever we're
[45:58] going to do
[46:00] and and so here jesus is telling those
[46:04] that he's
[46:04] calling out to to consider the cost
[46:08] of being a christian consider the cost
[46:12] of being a disciple and i'll say it like
[46:15] this consider the cost
[46:16] of being chosen amen it's not as easy as
[46:20] i want to
[46:21] or i believe i am now those are okay
[46:24] and i'm not against them
[46:28] but we need to consider the cost
[46:33] we know that there's the believer
[46:37] and the unbeliever and the mate believer
[46:40] it's kind of like the good the bad and
[46:43] the ugly
[46:44] right the believer he's good the
[46:47] unbeliever is bad
[46:48] and the main believer is ugly are you
[46:51] with me
[46:52] in every church the prophet taught us
[46:55] that these
[46:56] exist now i'd like to say here to us so
[46:59] we make it real clear that we're all
[47:01] believers here
[47:03] the unbelievers and the mate believers
[47:06] well i don't know
[47:07] you know but we're all believers and we
[47:10] just we need to believe that but we also
[47:12] need to believe what the prophet said
[47:15] so i don't want anybody to be
[47:16] discouraged uh
[47:18] but we just have to understand that we
[47:23] are facing
[47:24] a devil who doesn't want us to dig into
[47:27] christ
[47:29] that's right we want to be encouraged
[47:32] all day long
[47:34] but god is saying look what more can i
[47:36] do for you
[47:38] it's time for you to express your love
[47:40] to me
[47:41] amen so the believer will hear and take
[47:44] the word of god
[47:45] into his life hook line and sinker
[47:49] brother ben says the holy ghost says
[47:51] amen to every word of god just takes it
[47:52] wants it
[47:53] and puts it into their life now the
[47:56] unbeliever
[47:56] he hears the same word but simply will
[47:59] not
[48:00] receive it just a heart heart
[48:04] just it it just
[48:08] is resistant to to take it into his life
[48:14] now the make believer he will hear the
[48:16] word of god he will say amen
[48:18] and he will go through the motions as a
[48:20] real believer
[48:22] but will not apply the word of god
[48:25] to his life now i'm talking about all
[48:27] the word
[48:28] some of the word he will but not all the
[48:30] word
[48:32] he may even try to make changes in his
[48:34] life
[48:35] but he won't apply all the word to his
[48:38] life now there's the
[48:39] the difference there now which one of
[48:43] these groups
[48:44] is god choosing first elect consider
[48:49] the cost we want to consider the
[48:53] cost of being chosen
[48:59] now it's okay for you to be happy
[49:02] this morning this is totally okay with
[49:04] me
[49:06] you can resist every other feeling that
[49:09] you're having
[49:10] this morning and be happy
[49:13] for the word i love you the word loves
[49:16] you jesus loves you
[49:18] but you know we have this flesh that we
[49:21] have to
[49:22] contend with and
[49:25] our our goal is
[49:29] uh we we want to find the mind of god
[49:32] amen for our lives
[49:36] we can see that many are called but only
[49:39] few are chosen
[49:40] by god why is that why he does he only
[49:43] choose
[49:44] some god must have a higher standard
[49:48] than what most people think
[49:50] or willing to accept as much as god has
[49:54] loved the world and gave his only
[49:56] begotten son
[49:57] god still requires us to surrender
[50:00] a total surrender for sake all ambitions
[50:04] careers
[50:05] love not the world our our loved ones
[50:07] our own will our own lives
[50:11] you don't have to read very far in the
[50:12] gospels to find out that's exactly what
[50:14] jesus
[50:16] is telling us amen so he calls many
[50:19] but he only chooses a few and i'm sure
[50:22] he chooses
[50:24] the ones that he wants when you go to
[50:27] the car
[50:28] a car dealer you want to buy a car
[50:31] you don't buy the car you don't want you
[50:34] buy the car you want when you go
[50:36] into a restaurant you know say can i see
[50:38] your menu i'd like to i'd like to order
[50:40] something i don't want to eat
[50:43] we don't do that we and i believe that
[50:45] when god
[50:46] makes a choice what he's choosing to be
[50:48] his bride it's exactly what he wants
[50:53] we can't force him to want us
[50:58] we can only become what he wants
[51:02] amen he wants only the best for his
[51:06] kingdom
[51:07] according to ephesians 5 27 we know god
[51:10] wants to present to himself a glorious
[51:13] church
[51:15] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[51:17] thing
[51:18] but that it should be holy and without
[51:21] blemish now that's what god is looking
[51:24] for in order to achieve this
[51:26] and resolve he is continually washing
[51:30] his bride with the washing of the water
[51:33] by the word he's continuously
[51:35] sanctifying her
[51:37] getting her ready every time she comes
[51:38] to service he's speaking
[51:41] something to her that he wants to see
[51:44] washed out of her life
[51:47] at the same time he's encouraging her
[51:49] you're my bride
[51:52] keep going but we cannot remain the way
[51:56] we are if we were ready we would be out
[51:58] of here
[52:01] the more we can get excited about
[52:03] wanting to become more like him
[52:05] amen the quicker we'll get out of here
[52:10] we are not necessarily waiting on god
[52:14] i believe he's he's he's also waiting on
[52:17] us i know the last elect has to come in
[52:21] but that just gives us opportunity did
[52:23] you ever
[52:24] did you ever like you know you go to
[52:25] school and you're gonna you're supposed
[52:27] to take a test
[52:29] but the teacher says you know what
[52:31] because of this and this
[52:32] i wasn't prepared you know you're not
[52:34] going to
[52:35] take the test until tomorrow and you go
[52:37] i got one more day to study
[52:41] well we just got a little bit more time
[52:43] to get ready for jesus
[52:44] that's the way i look at this
[52:49] i believe that god wants a bride that
[52:51] will love
[52:52] him more than they love themselves
[52:57] don't you want somebody that will love
[52:58] you more
[53:02] amen than they love themselves
[53:06] that's hard living with somebody they
[53:09] don't
[53:10] love you as much as they love themselves
[53:14] i believe god wants a bride that'll love
[53:16] him more than they love herself
[53:19] according to revelations verse 12 ver
[53:23] chapter 12 verse 11 it is one of the
[53:26] three requirements to overcome in this
[53:28] age
[53:29] and they overcame it by the blood of the
[53:31] lamb by the word of their testimony and
[53:33] they
[53:33] loved not their lives unto the death
[53:37] well if they didn't love their lives who
[53:39] they love it had to be god
[53:43] it had to be god so many are called few
[53:46] are chosen jesus uses the same
[53:50] ratio of many few in matthew chapter 7
[53:54] when he calls many into the to the to
[53:57] come into the doors of heaven he says in
[53:59] uh verse 13 of matthew chapter 7
[54:02] entering in at the straight gate
[54:04] for why does the gate and broad is the
[54:06] way that leads to destruction
[54:08] and many there be which going there at
[54:10] because straight is the gate narrows
[54:12] away that
[54:13] which leadeth onto life and few there be
[54:16] that find it so again the same ratio
[54:20] many few is being used
[54:24] the straight gate is a narrow entrance
[54:27] into heaven
[54:28] amen you've heard of the old expression
[54:31] straight as an arrow
[54:34] some teachers they were just so
[54:37] can't get away with anything or some
[54:41] coach
[54:42] or one of the two parents or did you
[54:46] ever hear this
[54:49] oh we can't go to my house and do that
[54:51] because my parents are too strict
[54:56] god is word straight as an arrow his way
[54:59] is straight as an arrow
[55:00] [Music]
[55:02] the way that god leads man to eternal
[55:04] life is by the infallible
[55:06] word of jesus christ there's no other
[55:08] way
[55:09] the majority of people have considered
[55:13] god's narrow way
[55:17] to not be the only way
[55:20] in other words they hear a voice that
[55:22] says that's narrow-minded
[55:27] they cannot that can't be the only way
[55:29] to get to heaven
[55:31] you know what i'll just find another
[55:33] church
[55:35] that is more suitable to the way that i
[55:37] think
[55:38] are you with me
[55:42] paul speaking of the end times here in
[55:47] ii timothy chapter 3 verse 13
[55:50] says but evil men and seducers shall wax
[55:54] worse and worse deceiving and being
[55:55] deceived but
[55:56] continue thou in the things which thou
[55:58] has learned and been assured of
[56:00] knowing of whom thou has learned them so
[56:02] in other words as we see this
[56:04] you know culvert arising again and all
[56:06] the you know we're going to have a
[56:08] shortage of 37 uh items
[56:12] in the future well they just seem to
[56:14] have know everything
[56:18] instead of our minds being on that stuff
[56:22] i think we should take the advice given
[56:24] by paul to timothy
[56:27] continue in the things that thou has
[56:30] learned and has been assured of
[56:32] anointing of who
[56:33] thou has learned them and that from a
[56:35] child that has known the holy scriptures
[56:38] which are able to make thee
[56:42] wise we're going to get a wise and
[56:45] foolish virgins here
[56:46] able to make thee wise unto salvation
[56:50] through faith in that is it which is in
[56:53] jesus christ
[56:54] all scripture is given by the
[56:57] inspiration of god
[56:58] and it is profitable for a doctrine
[57:00] reproof correction and instructions of
[57:02] righteousness
[57:03] that the man of god may be perfect
[57:05] thoroughly furnished unto all
[57:07] good works
[57:10] this is the only way to salvation is the
[57:13] word of god
[57:14] we need to be so interested in becoming
[57:17] that word
[57:18] not just saying i believe the word is
[57:20] true and i believe it's god's word and
[57:23] we're supposed to live by all those
[57:24] things has
[57:26] nothing in it about commitment
[57:30] to living the word and we need to be
[57:33] interested in letting this word
[57:35] become manifested inside of us
[57:41] now and hey guy on this couple of
[57:45] scriptures i'm throwing in here and i'm
[57:46] sorry i'll just i'm going to read them
[57:48] real quick
[57:49] hey guys uh chapter 1 verse 7 says thus
[57:52] saith the lord of hosts
[57:53] consider your ways so consider
[57:57] the thought process of being able to
[58:00] become
[58:02] god's chosen elect different
[58:05] than the way he is chosen isaiah 55
[58:09] verse 8 for my thoughts are not your
[58:11] thoughts
[58:11] neither are my neither are your ways my
[58:15] way so there's a difference between way
[58:17] we think and the way god thinks
[58:20] for as the heavens are higher than the
[58:21] earth sore my way is higher than your
[58:23] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[58:26] so god's thoughts his standard is higher
[58:29] than ours
[58:31] god's straight gate in narrow way
[58:35] is very difficult it's
[58:38] it's higher than ours in fact first
[58:41] peter chapter 4 verse 18 says
[58:43] that the righteous are scarcely saved
[58:47] the righteous scarcely
[58:51] now i wa if we're having a race or if
[58:54] you watch a race
[58:55] the olympics or whatever
[58:59] and a person's barely makes it
[59:02] as the winner right comes in first or he
[59:05] scarcely makes it well
[59:08] he he doesn't got a whole lap in front
[59:12] of another person
[59:14] right he doesn't get a whole 100 yards
[59:18] no it's this close
[59:22] and the righteous is this close to
[59:25] making it
[59:26] right it's not
[59:30] i'm so predestined it just doesn't
[59:32] matter i'm so elected it doesn't matter
[59:36] it just doesn't rhyme with all the
[59:38] scriptures yes we're predestined and
[59:40] praise god
[59:41] that should give us security and comfort
[59:43] but that doesn't take away what we need
[59:45] to be doing
[59:48] jesus said it's only they that endure
[59:52] to the end shall be saved
[59:56] now of course the whole church world is
[59:58] kind of like in going to make it to the
[1:00:00] end
[1:00:02] but endure what and tear what
[1:00:06] just be alive and get to the end no
[1:00:11] no what we need to be doing
[1:00:14] to get ready we're taught philippians
[1:00:17] chapter 2 verse 12
[1:00:19] to work out our own salvation with fear
[1:00:22] and trembling
[1:00:23] that's coming in to church now
[1:00:26] like i i hope
[1:00:30] i'm i'm pleasing the lord not coming to
[1:00:33] the church well
[1:00:34] i'll come here to grab some more
[1:00:35] knowledge kind of kind of just see
[1:00:37] you know you know how i can just grow in
[1:00:40] knowledge
[1:00:42] no
[1:00:46] for it is god which is trying to work in
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:50] both to will and to do of his
[1:00:54] good pleasure so we're just you know
[1:00:57] talking about that god's
[1:00:58] way is higher than our way his way of
[1:01:00] thinking is different than ours
[1:01:02] and we need to understand that when we
[1:01:03] come into church it
[1:01:05] because things are not coming across to
[1:01:07] us the way that we're thinking
[1:01:09] doesn't mean it's wrong
[1:01:13] it means that maybe that god isn't where
[1:01:16] we think he is all the time
[1:01:17] in the way that we think about the word
[1:01:22] we know the only way a man can get into
[1:01:25] heaven
[1:01:26] is simply through the new birth jesus
[1:01:29] told nicodemus
[1:01:31] in john chapter 3 verse 3 verily verily
[1:01:34] i say unto thee except a man be born
[1:01:36] again
[1:01:37] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[1:01:41] he has to be born again it's as clear as
[1:01:44] as can be
[1:01:45] that simple but yet what does it mean to
[1:01:48] be born again
[1:01:49] right the most important thing that god
[1:01:52] requires
[1:01:52] of a man to to make it to heaven is for
[1:01:55] a man to allow god
[1:01:57] to come into his heart
[1:02:00] to really come into his heart we can't
[1:02:04] make it into heaven with sin
[1:02:07] now jesus died for our sin and
[1:02:10] and and repentance is is required for
[1:02:13] sin
[1:02:14] to to be to re to be removed
[1:02:17] but god does not want people in heaven
[1:02:21] whose sins are forgiven yet they still
[1:02:24] have their own
[1:02:25] sinful nature
[1:02:29] so it's not just about being forgiven of
[1:02:31] our sin
[1:02:33] it's about the very nature that caused
[1:02:35] the sin
[1:02:38] because the whole reason think about
[1:02:41] this
[1:02:42] the whole reason that god put flaming
[1:02:44] swords
[1:02:45] in the garden of eden after he talked to
[1:02:48] adam and eve
[1:02:50] about the sin he said
[1:02:54] if we if they partake of the tree of
[1:02:57] life
[1:02:58] while they have that sinful nature
[1:03:01] they're going to live eternally
[1:03:03] with a sinful nature that's why he put
[1:03:07] flaming swords there right in other
[1:03:10] words
[1:03:11] you've got to be born again you've got
[1:03:12] to get rid of that nature because that
[1:03:14] sinful nature
[1:03:15] came upon them when they partook of the
[1:03:18] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:03:20] just like that they began to get old the
[1:03:22] day you ether of the day you'll die
[1:03:24] sin had set in
[1:03:33] god does not want people with a sinful
[1:03:35] nature in heaven
[1:03:36] amen so the most important thing a man
[1:03:39] can do
[1:03:40] is to allow god to come into his heart
[1:03:43] amen
[1:03:45] it's the only way that god can assure
[1:03:46] that his will is going to be done in
[1:03:48] heaven
[1:03:50] is if he has complete control of our
[1:03:53] lives our will and everything that
[1:03:56] happens
[1:04:01] as soon as someone in heaven wanted to
[1:04:04] do their own will
[1:04:07] that's when sin happened
[1:04:10] it's and that was lucifer when he
[1:04:13] decided
[1:04:15] i am going to do my own thing
[1:04:21] that's when iniquity was found and
[1:04:23] that's when things began to get polluted
[1:04:24] in church
[1:04:27] or polluted in heaven and god had to
[1:04:30] just say take
[1:04:31] sides there was a split in the church in
[1:04:33] heaven
[1:04:36] and a third of the church went this way
[1:04:38] and two-thirds stayed with jesus
[1:04:40] praise the lord hey splits have been
[1:04:44] since the
[1:04:44] beginning have they not right
[1:04:48] but god used it amen amen he used it how
[1:04:54] many times have you gotten in trouble
[1:04:59] for doing something that you shouldn't
[1:05:00] have done
[1:05:02] but you were never told
[1:05:08] or for not doing something that somebody
[1:05:10] wanted you to do
[1:05:11] but they didn't tell you
[1:05:15] and you said or at least thought these
[1:05:16] thoughts at one time or another
[1:05:19] i can't read your mind
[1:05:24] if you wanted didn't want it you should
[1:05:27] have told me
[1:05:30] and the only way to assure that god's
[1:05:33] will is going to be done in heaven
[1:05:35] is if we have the mind of christ
[1:05:39] that he has control of our mind
[1:05:44] our lives then he can just have
[1:05:47] remember brother branham said that power
[1:05:50] without character
[1:05:52] was satanic power to do whatever you
[1:05:54] wanted to do
[1:05:55] but not character to do god's will are
[1:05:58] you with me
[1:05:59] amen we must be born again
[1:06:06] the full birth amen
[1:06:09] we must be filled with the life of god
[1:06:12] nothing
[1:06:13] short of the holy ghost i can't
[1:06:15] emphasize enough
[1:06:16] the importance of getting on our knees
[1:06:19] crying out for god
[1:06:20] for more of the holy ghost
[1:06:25] i'm happy for how much we have
[1:06:28] but satan and an evil spirit
[1:06:31] is the only thing that will ever tell
[1:06:34] you you have enough
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:37] that will never come from the lips of
[1:06:38] god
[1:06:44] in fact we seem to be like jesus
[1:06:48] more of you
[1:06:51] i think that's the spirit of god
[1:06:58] let's talk about the condition and the
[1:07:00] deceptions
[1:07:01] of uh the the the foolish virgins for a
[1:07:05] moment turn with me
[1:07:07] if you would to saint matthew chapter 25
[1:07:10] i'd like to read the first 13 verses
[1:07:13] here
[1:07:18] how many is excited for the word now if
[1:07:28] i was speaking to your flesh
[1:07:30] there would have been
[1:07:33] but we're not speaking to the flesh
[1:07:34] we're speaking to the bride right
[1:07:38] saint matthew chapter 25 starting with
[1:07:40] verse 1 then shall the
[1:07:42] kingdom of heaven be likened unto
[1:07:43] virgins unto ten virgins
[1:07:45] which took their lamps and went forth to
[1:07:48] meet the bridegroom
[1:07:52] the five and five of them were wise
[1:07:56] and five were foolish
[1:08:01] they that were foolish took their lamps
[1:08:04] and took
[1:08:05] no oil with them
[1:08:09] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:08:12] with
[1:08:13] their lamps while the bridegroom terry
[1:08:16] they all slumbered and slept and at
[1:08:17] midnight
[1:08:18] there was a cry behold the bridegroom
[1:08:20] cometh go yet to meet him
[1:08:23] and all those virgins arose and trim
[1:08:25] their lambs
[1:08:28] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[1:08:30] us
[1:08:31] of your oil for our lamps have gone out
[1:08:35] but the wise answer is saying not so
[1:08:37] lest there be not enough for us
[1:08:39] and you but go ye rather to them that
[1:08:42] sell and buy for yourselves
[1:08:44] and while they went to buy the
[1:08:46] bridegroom came
[1:08:48] and they that were ready went in with to
[1:08:51] with him to the marriage and the door
[1:08:53] was shut and afterwards
[1:08:55] the other virgins saying lord lord open
[1:08:58] to us
[1:08:59] and he's answered and said unto them
[1:09:01] verily i say unto you i know you not
[1:09:05] watch therefore for ye know not the day
[1:09:08] or the hour when the son of man
[1:09:11] cometh now there are some similarities
[1:09:15] between these two groups brother branham
[1:09:17] taught us
[1:09:19] they were both virgins
[1:09:23] both groups lived good clean
[1:09:26] lives they didn't indulge themselves
[1:09:31] in the things of the world they both
[1:09:34] went out to meet the bridegroom
[1:09:38] both groups wanted to go into the
[1:09:40] rapture in other words
[1:09:43] they both went to church they fellowship
[1:09:46] together they prayed
[1:09:47] for one another they worshipped the lord
[1:09:50] they listened to the word
[1:09:51] of god being preached that
[1:09:54] they believed would help them get ready
[1:09:56] or else they wanted done it
[1:09:59] they both heard the message of the hour
[1:10:02] malachi 4 5.
[1:10:04] because brother branham taught us
[1:10:07] that at midnight the cry went out behold
[1:10:10] the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet
[1:10:12] him
[1:10:13] and that was the message of the hour
[1:10:16] that call was the message of the hour
[1:10:19] and all the virgins arose
[1:10:22] and trimmed their lamps see the
[1:10:25] similarities
[1:10:28] sit amongst us at church
[1:10:32] and the wise virgins believed
[1:10:35] the message of the hour they knew
[1:10:39] what it took to get in they knew it took
[1:10:42] more of the holy ghost
[1:10:47] whereas the foolish virgins listened
[1:10:50] to the wrong voice that said
[1:10:53] christ already paid the price for you
[1:10:56] you don't have to do anything else you
[1:10:59] already have the holy ghost
[1:11:01] you have enough of god to make a rapture
[1:11:08] same word but it's the response to the
[1:11:11] word
[1:11:16] and when the foolish virgins began to
[1:11:18] realize
[1:11:19] that they didn't have enough of god to
[1:11:22] make the rapture
[1:11:24] they got more serious with the word is
[1:11:26] that what we read in here
[1:11:29] and they started seeking more of god
[1:11:32] that's what was required they started
[1:11:33] seeking more of god but notice
[1:11:36] they didn't even go to god
[1:11:39] they were still carnal in their
[1:11:41] relationship and in their thoughts
[1:11:43] and so they they went to holy
[1:11:46] ghost-filled believers to get it
[1:11:50] as if they could get more god by talking
[1:11:53] to someone
[1:11:58] their relationship was so distant from
[1:12:00] god that they didn't even go to god for
[1:12:02] the holy ghost
[1:12:05] come on give me what you got
[1:12:10] and what did the holy ghost filled
[1:12:13] believers tell them
[1:12:15] just like it is the only person that can
[1:12:18] give you the holy ghost
[1:12:20] or more of god is god himself
[1:12:27] revelation chapter 3 verse 18 i think we
[1:12:29] read this
[1:12:31] just maybe last service or soul jesus
[1:12:35] speaking here he says
[1:12:36] i counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:12:39] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:12:42] rich
[1:12:44] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:12:47] clothed and the shame of thy nakedness
[1:12:48] do not appear and anoint that eyes with
[1:12:50] i saith that thou may deceive
[1:12:52] i counsel thee to buy of me
[1:12:57] i'm the one that can give you more holy
[1:12:59] ghost
[1:13:01] amen but it isn't as easy as just coming
[1:13:03] to god and saying
[1:13:05] oh god i want some more holy ghost
[1:13:08] it just doesn't work like that if it did
[1:13:11] well we'd all have it
[1:13:14] it requires so much more because god's
[1:13:17] standard
[1:13:18] is so high their relationship with god
[1:13:22] was never even close enough
[1:13:25] to first catch that they needed more of
[1:13:28] god than what they had
[1:13:29] because remember they kept thinking i
[1:13:32] have enough
[1:13:34] but when they realized that they didn't
[1:13:37] then then they started seeking it so at
[1:13:42] one time
[1:13:43] they kept resisting the word of god that
[1:13:45] was being preached
[1:13:46] the word says you know come to the altar
[1:13:49] come pray
[1:13:50] come seek the lord and
[1:13:53] i'll do it at home i got enough and
[1:13:57] but after a while when they began to get
[1:13:59] pricked when they finally realized it
[1:14:02] was
[1:14:03] what was required was more than what
[1:14:04] they had
[1:14:12] they kept having a deaf ear to the word
[1:14:15] of god that was being preached they were
[1:14:19] not willing to die
[1:14:20] out more to themselves in order to get
[1:14:23] filled up with the holy ghost
[1:14:27] that a lot of times god wants to fill us
[1:14:30] i think the prophet taught us that he
[1:14:32] wants to give us the holy ghost
[1:14:34] more than we want it he talked about the
[1:14:38] great pressure that's
[1:14:39] that there is behind god wanting to just
[1:14:42] give it to us
[1:14:44] but we don't i can kind of take it or
[1:14:46] leave we don't even have a pressure to
[1:14:47] get it
[1:14:48] right we don't even feel that pressure
[1:14:54] second when they came to the grips that
[1:14:57] they needed more
[1:14:58] they were so distant from god that they
[1:15:01] actually sought it
[1:15:03] through other believers
[1:15:06] wow can i read some quotes
[1:15:12] brother branham said in the message
[1:15:14] revelation chapter 4 he says
[1:15:15] look at the sleeping virgins oh what did
[1:15:18] she do
[1:15:20] they had to sell something in order to
[1:15:24] buy her oil
[1:15:27] what did she have to sell
[1:15:31] her old creeds her denominations
[1:15:34] and things
[1:15:37] she sold out all she had
[1:15:41] in order to find christ christ
[1:15:44] that great jewel
[1:15:48] she had to sell everything saints
[1:15:51] think about it paul said i have suffered
[1:15:54] the loss of
[1:15:54] all things and count them but dung that
[1:15:57] i might
[1:15:58] win christ now satan comes to church
[1:16:01] with us
[1:16:02] he sits next to us and he tells us all
[1:16:04] the time that we've given enough
[1:16:08] we're not considering the cost
[1:16:12] to be elect
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:17] in the message 10 virgins and a hundred
[1:16:21] and forty four thousand jews
[1:16:23] i don't know if i ever read that message
[1:16:27] brother brahm says judas come up
[1:16:29] remember the sleeping virgins
[1:16:31] you say uh could be inspired by the
[1:16:34] devil
[1:16:37] absolutely still living clean yes sir
[1:16:39] judas did he was saved
[1:16:41] sanctified preached divine healing cast
[1:16:43] out devils
[1:16:44] why he just right straight up
[1:16:48] almost the same thing that the rest of
[1:16:50] them was
[1:16:52] but when it come to the pentecost that's
[1:16:54] where he showed his colors
[1:16:56] he did not receive the holy ghost
[1:17:00] and turned up his heels and denied the
[1:17:03] lord jesus
[1:17:04] that's exactly what the churches did
[1:17:08] when it come to pentecost the bless the
[1:17:10] pentecostal blessings
[1:17:11] they got away from it oh don't you see
[1:17:14] it class
[1:17:19] i i i read this and to me whether i'm
[1:17:22] sitting there
[1:17:23] or i'm preaching it here i feel i need
[1:17:26] more of the holy ghost
[1:17:28] and i know this is this to me seems like
[1:17:31] the same vein that these last few
[1:17:33] services have been coming with
[1:17:35] but i really feel that god wants our
[1:17:37] little church to be crying out more to
[1:17:39] him
[1:17:40] i just feel that saints and you know i'm
[1:17:42] not a uh
[1:17:43] an evangelist to to get your your your
[1:17:46] feelings and emotions kind of arise to a
[1:17:48] place to want to
[1:17:49] do that i understand that but i'm hoping
[1:17:52] that the word is what you're in love
[1:17:54] with and that word will make a
[1:17:56] difference in your life
[1:18:00] in the message handwriting on the wall
[1:18:02] brother man says you know there were
[1:18:04] virgins that went out to meet him and
[1:18:06] five
[1:18:07] were still virgins but but were foolish
[1:18:10] virgins
[1:18:11] that didn't keep oil in their land
[1:18:14] i love how he said that because remember
[1:18:17] they had
[1:18:18] a bit of oil because
[1:18:21] otherwise it wouldn't have said that
[1:18:22] their lamps went out
[1:18:24] the fact that they went out means they
[1:18:25] had it but they didn't
[1:18:28] have enough they didn't take any with
[1:18:29] them they thought that the
[1:18:31] their attitude was the what i have here
[1:18:35] is adequate and that's what i'm trying
[1:18:37] to get across that
[1:18:38] the the voices that come to us and say
[1:18:42] that
[1:18:42] we have enough is so
[1:18:46] wrong
[1:18:52] they didn't keep oil in their land they
[1:18:54] didn't keep seeking it
[1:18:56] and though they were virgins just the
[1:18:58] same as others
[1:18:59] they were not permitted to the wedding
[1:19:01] supper so
[1:19:03] far be it from any people here tonight
[1:19:06] to be included so they would be excluded
[1:19:10] from the presence of lord
[1:19:11] included in that group of the virgins
[1:19:13] with no oil in their lamps i just say
[1:19:15] you know may there not be a soul here
[1:19:17] today of that group but i'll say it like
[1:19:19] this
[1:19:20] the devil still speaks to us
[1:19:23] and may this word today just be
[1:19:26] something that we can put
[1:19:27] uh as as a combat against the enemy when
[1:19:30] he comes to us
[1:19:31] and tries to just get us to lay back and
[1:19:33] it calls us to just
[1:19:35] seek more of god amen in the message god
[1:19:38] being misunderstood
[1:19:39] he says now if you were with us in the
[1:19:42] last teachings in revelations
[1:19:44] you'd find out that those virgins
[1:19:47] the five foolish virgins were not lost
[1:19:52] but they were not permitted to go into
[1:19:54] the wedding supper
[1:19:58] right but they suffered persecution and
[1:20:00] martin
[1:20:01] they were raised again in the general
[1:20:03] resurrection
[1:20:04] in the last day those are the people
[1:20:07] who were he separated the sheep from the
[1:20:10] goat see
[1:20:11] they stood before judgment
[1:20:19] call them goats
[1:20:23] in the message were the foolish virgins
[1:20:25] where are the foolish virgins
[1:20:27] questions and answers one of the
[1:20:28] questions questions 406
[1:20:31] were where are the foolish virgins
[1:20:33] during the millennium
[1:20:34] brother branham said in the millennium
[1:20:37] they're in the grave
[1:20:38] and he quotes the rest of the dead lived
[1:20:40] not for a thousand
[1:20:42] years in the patentless church age
[1:20:45] brother man says
[1:20:46] for when he comes the books will be open
[1:20:50] that is when even the luke
[1:20:53] warm church and the foolish virgin will
[1:20:56] appear now he
[1:20:56] now he's saying he's calling them both
[1:20:58] the same the lukewarm church
[1:21:01] and the foolish virgin
[1:21:04] will appear he will separate the sheep
[1:21:06] from the goats
[1:21:07] when he comes he will take over
[1:21:10] the kingdom for it is his and with him
[1:21:14] will be thousands times ten thousands
[1:21:18] his bride
[1:21:18] who will come to minister to him
[1:21:22] oh i hope you like to minister to people
[1:21:25] because that's what we're going to be
[1:21:26] doing oh
[1:21:28] it is now or never
[1:21:32] brother batman says repent before it's
[1:21:35] too late
[1:21:35] he said wake up from amongst the dead
[1:21:39] and seek god to be filled with his
[1:21:41] spirit
[1:21:42] or you will miss it amen
[1:21:46] do it now while there's time amen
[1:21:50] in the message of sardian church age
[1:21:53] brother brahm said it is the second
[1:21:55] resurrection
[1:21:56] wherein the five foolish virgins come up
[1:21:58] notice they were virgins they did not
[1:22:00] have the holy spirit so they missed
[1:22:02] being
[1:22:02] in the bride
[1:22:08] but i'm sure they were justified which
[1:22:09] is a part of the holy ghost
[1:22:12] and they were even sanctified because
[1:22:14] they were virgins
[1:22:16] but brother branham says they still
[1:22:17] didn't have the holy ghost meaning that
[1:22:19] they didn't have
[1:22:20] enough what was required by god
[1:22:27] okay let me read that again they did not
[1:22:29] have the holy spirit so they missed
[1:22:30] being the bride
[1:22:32] while the five wise who had oil became a
[1:22:35] part of the bride so we're considering
[1:22:37] the cost here
[1:22:39] but these people being a separate
[1:22:41] god-loving people
[1:22:42] and trying to abide by the word
[1:22:44] according to what they knew
[1:22:45] and being helped in the work of the lord
[1:22:47] will come up at the end time
[1:22:49] they will miss the millennium which you
[1:22:53] can begin to see
[1:22:54] by these truth is much more important
[1:22:56] and wonderful
[1:22:58] than we've ever thought or believed
[1:23:02] i love it in the message god's wrap gift
[1:23:06] brother bram says they're gone back the
[1:23:09] sleeping virgin's gone back
[1:23:11] to buy some oil but that's when he
[1:23:14] come while they were gone after it
[1:23:17] so how close are we now when we see
[1:23:21] these great churches coming back
[1:23:23] saying well maybe we've left off
[1:23:26] something somewhere we better find it
[1:23:28] they'll never get it just remember that
[1:23:30] they'll never never get it they're dead
[1:23:34] they're dead and dead and that's all
[1:23:36] they'll never come to life
[1:23:38] just remember i speak in the name of the
[1:23:39] lord and this
[1:23:41] is on tape yes sir they'll never never
[1:23:43] come into life
[1:23:44] they're done so that's the reason i'm
[1:23:47] not interested in them programs i'm
[1:23:49] interested in one thing
[1:23:50] blasting just as hard as i can to whom
[1:23:53] so ever will
[1:23:55] everybody isn't going to get excited
[1:23:57] about this message and i
[1:23:58] understand that and i don't think we're
[1:24:01] called
[1:24:02] to try to get everybody in to to doing
[1:24:05] it if they don't feel to do it
[1:24:07] that's not the call the call is to get
[1:24:10] the word to the bride
[1:24:13] and they need to hear this this this
[1:24:15] message is for the bride
[1:24:17] it's not for the foolish virgin it's to
[1:24:20] the elect
[1:24:24] turn with me if you would to luke
[1:24:26] chapter 18
[1:24:28] verse 1.
[1:24:38] great peace have they that love thy law
[1:24:41] and nothing shall offend them i say when
[1:24:44] you come to church be determined
[1:24:46] don't let anything offend you don't let
[1:24:48] any word offend you don't let any
[1:24:50] person offend you don't let anything
[1:24:52] offend you
[1:24:54] love god love his word
[1:24:58] luke 18 verse 1 and he spake a parable
[1:25:00] unto them to this end that men ought
[1:25:03] always to pray and not to faint saying
[1:25:06] there wasn't a
[1:25:06] city a judge which feared not god
[1:25:09] neither regarded man
[1:25:11] there was a widow in that city and she
[1:25:13] came unto him saying avenge me of my
[1:25:14] adversary
[1:25:16] and when he would not for a while but
[1:25:17] afterwards he said within himself though
[1:25:19] i
[1:25:20] fear not god nor regard man
[1:25:23] yet because this woman troubled me i
[1:25:26] will venture
[1:25:27] lest by her continue climbing coming she
[1:25:30] weary me
[1:25:31] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[1:25:35] judge saith he wants us to consider
[1:25:39] what this unjudge was saying
[1:25:43] and then he says and shall not god
[1:25:46] avenge his
[1:25:46] own elect which cry day and night unto
[1:25:50] him
[1:25:50] though he bear along with them
[1:25:54] i tell you that when that he will avenge
[1:25:56] them speedily
[1:25:58] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:26:01] shall he find
[1:26:02] faith on the earth what a paradox
[1:26:06] that god is presenting about the end
[1:26:09] time
[1:26:09] here the purpose of this parable
[1:26:13] was to get god's own elect to pray
[1:26:17] more now that was the purpose of this
[1:26:20] parable
[1:26:20] it was for no other purpose
[1:26:25] i'm not saying can't be used for other
[1:26:26] purposes
[1:26:29] but this was not for the foolish virgin
[1:26:33] this was not for the church-goer this
[1:26:36] was for god's own elect
[1:26:39] it's true that men ought always to pray
[1:26:42] and not faint
[1:26:44] but jesus wasn't trying to get us to
[1:26:45] pray a little bit more
[1:26:47] he was literally trying to get us to cry
[1:26:49] out to him
[1:26:50] day and night there's a big difference
[1:26:53] right
[1:26:54] the ramifications of not praying enough
[1:26:57] is a spiritual
[1:26:58] fainting that's when a person becomes
[1:27:02] spiritually weak frail weary and become
[1:27:06] unconscious of their condition
[1:27:10] they become spiritually incoherent of
[1:27:13] things
[1:27:16] they're not spiritually in tune they
[1:27:18] become
[1:27:19] disconnected spiritually
[1:27:22] in other words they begin to feel a need
[1:27:26] of
[1:27:26] nothing that's being said
[1:27:32] it's definitely a scary condition to be
[1:27:33] in
[1:27:36] now naturally
[1:27:39] just before a person faints they start
[1:27:41] to feel weak and dizzy
[1:27:44] maybe their knees begin to wobble
[1:27:47] exhausted about ready to lose
[1:27:49] consciousness
[1:27:50] they become incoherent now that word
[1:27:53] means without
[1:27:54] logical or meaningful connection
[1:27:57] disjointed
[1:27:58] like they can't perceive what's being
[1:28:01] said
[1:28:01] and they're just kind of like they're
[1:28:03] ready to leave
[1:28:06] they can become physically irrational
[1:28:10] or confused now jesus being able
[1:28:14] to see the condition of believers in
[1:28:16] this hour just before his second coming
[1:28:19] he knew that there would be spiritual
[1:28:21] co-inherit
[1:28:23] people without faith and without
[1:28:26] trust they didn't have a trust
[1:28:29] connection with jesus
[1:28:32] they would be in a state of disorder
[1:28:33] perplexed bewildered disjointed
[1:28:36] or disconnected are you with me just say
[1:28:39] amen to the word amen so in the worst
[1:28:42] state that god has ever seen man because
[1:28:45] this is the worst hour there is
[1:28:47] the question arises when the son of man
[1:28:50] cometh shall he find
[1:28:51] faith on the earth and i'm speaking of
[1:28:55] the necessary faith to make a rapture
[1:28:57] amen so god is looking for faith
[1:29:02] and today we sitting in this room we're
[1:29:05] looking for faith
[1:29:08] and he sends a message to his little
[1:29:10] bride he says you may not
[1:29:12] understand why i'm bearing along with
[1:29:14] you why i'm not coming
[1:29:16] right away but i will avenge you
[1:29:19] i will come to your rescue speedily in
[1:29:21] my time
[1:29:24] i'm not going to avenge you i'm not
[1:29:26] going to avenge
[1:29:27] those who just pray once in a while
[1:29:33] you need to keep praying you need to
[1:29:34] pray with your veil amen
[1:29:37] i'm coming for the ones that are crying
[1:29:39] out day and night
[1:29:40] amen for the ones that cried so much
[1:29:43] that you would think
[1:29:45] that they would just be troubling me
[1:29:49] the ones that would be saying oh god
[1:29:51] avenge me of this old pestilence this
[1:29:53] thing that stands in a way for me
[1:29:55] serving you the way i want to serve you
[1:29:58] amen and that's what it's going to take
[1:30:00] to find faith
[1:30:02] the faith that we're looking for the
[1:30:03] faith that we need and it's going to be
[1:30:05] what it takes
[1:30:06] to for god to see the faith that he's
[1:30:08] looking for in us
[1:30:10] when you're crying out to god it's
[1:30:13] showing you've got faith in god
[1:30:15] when you're just sitting here and saying
[1:30:16] well i believe i'm in the message i'm a
[1:30:18] believer
[1:30:18] i'm i'm not bright i'm let i'm
[1:30:20] predestined you don't do nothing
[1:30:23] you're not showing god you've got faith
[1:30:25] that's the devil's interpretation of
[1:30:27] that
[1:30:30] the attitude of the elect is a
[1:30:32] continuous crying out
[1:30:34] a continuous seeking more of god now
[1:30:37] that is the
[1:30:37] attitude of the light and god points it
[1:30:40] out here
[1:30:42] he's typing the the bride that will be
[1:30:45] crying day and night
[1:30:46] with this woman who kept asking for help
[1:30:53] consider the cost consider the cost
[1:30:59] the attitude the foolish virgin is to
[1:31:02] cry out to god once or twice a month
[1:31:10] and think that's enough
[1:31:15] we don't really need the day and night
[1:31:17] we don't need that attitude
[1:31:20] because we're a lot instead of finding
[1:31:23] out in the scriptures
[1:31:25] what the elect does
[1:31:28] we're trying to to prove that we're
[1:31:30] elected instead of using
[1:31:31] the scriptures that are able to make us
[1:31:33] wise virgins
[1:31:36] wise unto salvation
[1:31:41] we've got to get desperate
[1:31:44] for god in this last age and then when
[1:31:47] we get desperate we need to stay
[1:31:49] desperate
[1:31:51] we won't be able to lukewarm our way
[1:31:54] into a rapture friends
[1:31:58] jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:32:00] god and his righteousness
[1:32:02] and all other things shall be added unto
[1:32:05] you
[1:32:05] now the more problems that the devil can
[1:32:07] present to you
[1:32:09] you've got problems with this problems
[1:32:12] with these 25 things in your home
[1:32:14] these 25 things with your work these 25
[1:32:17] things with your family
[1:32:18] these 25 things with the church you know
[1:32:20] you just don't got time to seek god
[1:32:24] first
[1:32:27] that's what makes this age so hard
[1:32:31] because we feel that we
[1:32:35] have a reason not to carve out some time
[1:32:39] to come to church and seek god before a
[1:32:41] service
[1:32:44] or get away through the course of the
[1:32:46] week
[1:32:50] more than ever we need to be seeking god
[1:32:54] and i can't help this is like maybe a
[1:32:56] message that
[1:32:57] isn't that what you would like to hear
[1:32:59] but it is the message that we need
[1:33:02] there's a difference
[1:33:08] you all know me if i wanted to
[1:33:11] please you and make you happy i know how
[1:33:13] to do that
[1:33:16] but if i seek to please men i would not
[1:33:19] be a servant of christ
[1:33:22] and i'm more interested in your souls
[1:33:24] i'm more interested in you making a
[1:33:25] rapture
[1:33:26] than i am of anything else
[1:33:31] in the message questions and answers
[1:33:32] brother brahm said the holy ghost
[1:33:34] ought to be more important to you than
[1:33:37] any
[1:33:38] than everything else there is in the
[1:33:39] whole world
[1:33:41] your prestige your life your job your
[1:33:44] anything that there is you should never
[1:33:48] cease until you have it
[1:33:52] you must receive it now here's the thing
[1:33:55] now saints i
[1:33:58] will never judge a person whether they
[1:34:00] got the holy ghost or don't
[1:34:03] i cannot stand here today
[1:34:06] and say and everybody that i know in my
[1:34:09] life
[1:34:09] i can tell they got it or they don't got
[1:34:11] it god did not
[1:34:13] make me give me that or make me that
[1:34:17] in fact the prophet taught that he
[1:34:18] didn't know who was who
[1:34:20] now when you're under the anointing and
[1:34:23] you're strong
[1:34:24] and your spirit bears witness with their
[1:34:26] spirit and i mean there are times
[1:34:28] that you catch a glimpse
[1:34:31] of the holy ghost in somebody's life but
[1:34:34] to really know
[1:34:35] whether they got it or they don't got it
[1:34:40] so we have to preach the word in such a
[1:34:43] way
[1:34:44] that we all must get it amen
[1:34:48] and so we're not here about trying to
[1:34:52] make anybody feel in any sort of
[1:34:55] negative way
[1:34:56] because this message is coming across
[1:34:58] i'll say it like this to you that have
[1:34:59] the holy ghost
[1:35:00] seek more seek more
[1:35:05] to those that are questioning seek more
[1:35:08] that's for you
[1:35:09] to those that know you don't have it see
[1:35:11] more it is for you
[1:35:12] for many are called but few are chosen
[1:35:14] we are we are
[1:35:15] expressing how you know you can be
[1:35:18] chosen
[1:35:19] amen when you consider the cause we need
[1:35:21] all of god to get in
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:28] he said you should never cease until you
[1:35:30] have it you must receive it
[1:35:32] it must be the most
[1:35:35] and he and you say well
[1:35:39] i'm afraid that at my work or
[1:35:43] i'm afraid that my husband
[1:35:46] don't be afraid that
[1:35:49] that be first place let everything else
[1:35:53] go
[1:35:54] let that be first well
[1:35:58] i expect to get it one of these days
[1:36:00] brother branham
[1:36:01] no not one of these days now this is the
[1:36:05] time
[1:36:06] let it be first before i do anything
[1:36:08] else
[1:36:09] let me have it now he said get desperate
[1:36:12] amen that would help answer our question
[1:36:16] when you get desperate for it
[1:36:20] you really got to have it or die
[1:36:23] then is when you are going
[1:36:27] to get it we're almost done
[1:36:32] can you say praise the lord
[1:36:35] amen thank god for his word
[1:36:38] amen god is awesome
[1:36:45] but he just doesn't unveil himself to
[1:36:48] anybody at any time
[1:36:49] anywhere now he can but he just does it
[1:36:52] that's just not his nature
[1:36:54] in fact jesus said in matthew 11 verse
[1:36:56] 25 the father
[1:36:57] has hid these things from the wise and
[1:37:00] prudent and he's revealed them to babes
[1:37:03] showing us that he's more likely to show
[1:37:06] some people things
[1:37:08] and most likely not to show others
[1:37:11] not things the father has reserved all
[1:37:15] revelation
[1:37:17] of jesus christ
[1:37:20] you can't get it from one another
[1:37:24] he can only get it from the father
[1:37:29] jesus said in matthew 13 that he spoke
[1:37:32] parables
[1:37:32] to hide the truth from some while
[1:37:35] revealing it to the others
[1:37:37] that was the purpose why he spoke in
[1:37:39] parables
[1:37:40] of course we like the story part helps
[1:37:42] us catch it
[1:37:45] but that story being so simple hides it
[1:37:49] from the others there was a time that
[1:37:52] the lord revealed himself to paul
[1:37:55] but not to others on the road to
[1:37:57] damascus there was more with him
[1:38:00] heard sounds voices
[1:38:03] saw lights action took place
[1:38:08] but only one man got it and the rest of
[1:38:10] them didn't get it
[1:38:12] think about that obviously god is
[1:38:15] looking to get something more
[1:38:17] out of the trade right than just telling
[1:38:21] people
[1:38:21] about him and he deserves us coming
[1:38:26] through the door of jesus christ and his
[1:38:28] requirements
[1:38:30] he wants us to cry day and night not to
[1:38:33] slow down but to continue
[1:38:36] pressing in he doesn't want us to be a
[1:38:39] thief
[1:38:40] or robber come some other way some easy
[1:38:42] way
[1:38:43] right because why do people steal
[1:38:45] because it's easy
[1:38:47] stealing is easier than working
[1:38:55] you know it's much easier just to no god
[1:38:58] wants us to cry out to him
[1:39:01] proverbs chapter 6 verse 6 go
[1:39:04] to the ant thou sluggard and consider
[1:39:08] her ways
[1:39:08] and be wise
[1:39:12] so being a sluggard
[1:39:15] we might say is unwise the ant
[1:39:19] when we consider her ways is wise
[1:39:23] which having no guide oversea or ruler
[1:39:27] provided her meat in the summer and
[1:39:29] gathered their food in the harvest
[1:39:32] how long without sleepless sluggard
[1:39:35] when will thou arise out of thy sleep
[1:39:38] yet a little sleep a little slumber a
[1:39:40] little folding of the hands
[1:39:43] to sleep
[1:39:47] god wants us to consider how an
[1:39:50] ant works tirelessly
[1:39:53] endlessly to build her future
[1:39:59] and i understand we've been
[1:40:01] predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:40:03] world
[1:40:04] and i'm grateful for that we wouldn't be
[1:40:06] here today without that
[1:40:08] right and i understand
[1:40:11] that we're to claim that we're the elect
[1:40:13] i understand that i believe that
[1:40:16] but there's no scriptures that just say
[1:40:19] sit back
[1:40:20] because the more i sit back the lazier i
[1:40:23] get
[1:40:24] the less i feel like studying the less i
[1:40:27] want to go to church
[1:40:28] the less i want to hear about the do's
[1:40:30] and don'ts
[1:40:34] i mean i would like just to stay and do
[1:40:37] what i want until the rapture comes and
[1:40:39] then i'm changed
[1:40:40] that'd be ideal but you know what i take
[1:40:43] all that time and never show jesus
[1:40:45] christ any love
[1:40:48] this is the only place that we have a
[1:40:50] chance
[1:40:53] to save somebody you're not going to
[1:40:56] have that chance on the other side
[1:40:58] what a way to express your love to god
[1:41:01] that you care
[1:41:02] about somebody's soul
[1:41:06] one of those requirements that god wants
[1:41:08] is our hearts
[1:41:11] god wants to see all of our heart into
[1:41:13] it
[1:41:14] crying day and night jeremiah chapter 29
[1:41:19] verse thing and you shall seek me and
[1:41:20] find me
[1:41:21] when you search for me with all your
[1:41:24] heart now i know we've read this before
[1:41:26] and i just believe it's it's just part
[1:41:28] of the same thing that god is
[1:41:30] is drawing us to seek him with
[1:41:32] everything we got amen
[1:41:33] how can we ever go wrong by putting all
[1:41:35] of our heart into god
[1:41:36] it will never be in vain it will never
[1:41:38] be wrong
[1:41:40] deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 and thou
[1:41:43] shalt love the lord thy god
[1:41:45] with what with all thy heart with
[1:41:48] all thy soul and with all thy
[1:41:51] might brother branham said like this
[1:41:54] lay everything aside until you get
[1:41:57] perfect love lay everything aside
[1:42:02] well there's a cost to getting perfect
[1:42:03] love it's laying things aside
[1:42:06] that you feel that you can do at the
[1:42:08] same time of getting it
[1:42:11] now that perfect love is complete love
[1:42:14] this is my last quote this morning
[1:42:18] and then they'll be getting into
[1:42:19] afternoon and we'll be start the
[1:42:20] afternoon quotes
[1:42:24] faith is our victory brother branham
[1:42:26] said oh
[1:42:27] if we had more gallant men like that
[1:42:32] how many wants to be a gal man oh if we
[1:42:34] had more gallant
[1:42:35] or women men like that that would
[1:42:37] purpose
[1:42:38] in their heart if i'm a christian
[1:42:43] i'm going to find out every divine
[1:42:46] blessing that belongs to me and claim it
[1:42:50] if the bible teaches that i can receive
[1:42:53] the holy spirit
[1:42:54] i'm going to stay on my knees till i get
[1:42:57] the holy spirit and not just drift off
[1:43:07] gallant i believe the bride
[1:43:10] is gallant the brand says i was reading
[1:43:14] old uncle buddy robinson's life story
[1:43:16] some time ago
[1:43:17] and he was such a great man a loving man
[1:43:19] and a man of faith
[1:43:21] and he got to hungering for the holy
[1:43:23] spirit because the bible taught it
[1:43:26] i love that the bible taught it and it
[1:43:29] says that one day he was out plowing
[1:43:31] corn
[1:43:31] and he stopped the old meal his name was
[1:43:33] alex and he got down
[1:43:35] in the corn row and he said god if you
[1:43:38] don't give me the baptism of the holy
[1:43:40] spirit
[1:43:40] when you come back to earth you'll find
[1:43:43] my bones
[1:43:44] lying right here
[1:43:48] that's purposing in your heart that's
[1:43:51] really
[1:43:51] getting down to business
[1:43:55] now when you get that kind of purpose in
[1:43:56] your heart god is going to open up the
[1:43:58] windows of heaven
[1:44:00] something has to take place you've got
[1:44:04] to get down to business with god
[1:44:06] and have some purpose some gratitude
[1:44:09] for him saving you
[1:44:13] i already said thank you how many times
[1:44:16] you ever do something for somebody
[1:44:18] i mean you all experience this you put a
[1:44:21] lot of time into it
[1:44:23] and you get a thank you that is all you
[1:44:26] get
[1:44:28] i feel so sorry
[1:44:31] for the the sisters
[1:44:34] and brother run who cooked these meals
[1:44:39] they wore labor so much for a meal
[1:44:42] and sometimes i was like is a thank you
[1:44:47] to me showing gratitude is much more
[1:44:49] than the words thank you
[1:44:52] and sometimes it's hard for us to just
[1:44:54] really worship the lord and say thank
[1:44:56] you after a service after the word has
[1:44:58] come
[1:45:01] god wants to see some appreciation for
[1:45:03] salvation what he's done for us
[1:45:05] wow he did it last week last month last
[1:45:07] year last decade
[1:45:10] when we get to heaven we're not going to
[1:45:11] be going hey we already thank you for
[1:45:13] salvation
[1:45:15] we'll get on to other let's play some
[1:45:17] nintendo games now
[1:45:19] we're going to be worshiping god for
[1:45:21] eternal life
[1:45:23] those scars are going to be on his hand
[1:45:25] he wants us to remember what he did for
[1:45:27] him
[1:45:28] i don't think we should ever stop just
[1:45:30] being thankful for so great of salvation
[1:45:33] amen let's stand together so consider
[1:45:35] the cost of being chosen
[1:45:39] consider the cost of being chosen
[1:45:42] consider crying day and night
[1:45:44] to be more like god
[1:45:48] i know it's a high cost but it's one we
[1:45:51] can do with honor
[1:45:54] we can feel it's such an honor
[1:45:57] to be seeking god amen
[1:46:02] i know it's hard but it's god's way
[1:46:07] everything else that we do that's
[1:46:09] outside the word we don't have thus
[1:46:11] saith the lord
[1:46:13] we have if it be the lord will we have
[1:46:17] feelings emotions thoughts desires
[1:46:21] but in the midst of a world that's going
[1:46:24] crazy insane
[1:46:26] and our lives are just becoming more and
[1:46:28] more filled with things
[1:46:31] carve out more time just more time
[1:46:33] another
[1:46:34] amount of time on a daily basis if you
[1:46:37] can only do five minutes a day
[1:46:39] do five minutes a day
[1:46:43] but start to push towards this this
[1:46:45] crying every single day for the lord
[1:46:48] i like to say like this i'm i'm not much
[1:46:51] of a
[1:46:53] carnival got to do something but just
[1:46:54] stay there till you cry
[1:46:56] every day cry day and night whatever
[1:47:00] it takes to get you filled with
[1:47:03] more of god because when you have the
[1:47:06] holy ghost
[1:47:07] it's not a feeling it will make you feel
[1:47:10] good
[1:47:11] but sometimes it will also hurt when he
[1:47:14] calls you to do something
[1:47:15] it may require you to suffer the thing
[1:47:18] is
[1:47:18] you will know there's a difference
[1:47:20] that's taking place in your life
[1:47:22] your life will begin to change i like
[1:47:24] what brother stan is talking to brother
[1:47:26] stan one time he heard
[1:47:28] brother alex preaching and he said
[1:47:30] brother john something happened in that
[1:47:32] service
[1:47:34] i can't explain it i don't know but
[1:47:36] something happened that i do know and
[1:47:37] that's how it is with god
[1:47:39] you cannot explain god who can explain
[1:47:41] god who can explain the love of god
[1:47:42] who can explain laying down your life
[1:47:45] for others you can't explain it but you
[1:47:47] know it's him
[1:47:50] god's calling us to cry out to him more
[1:47:54] i believe if we do our part god is
[1:47:56] faithful to draw nigh to us and
[1:47:58] fill us with him that we may have power
[1:48:02] in this last age as the elective god to
[1:48:06] move
[1:48:06] in the direction whatever he calls us to
[1:48:08] do i certainly don't want to be working
[1:48:10] for the lord
[1:48:11] without the power of the holy ghost amen
[1:48:14] that would just make me a denominational
[1:48:16] believer i don't want that
[1:48:19] amen let's sing
[1:48:23] um oh saying to be like jesus to be like

[1:51:51] with the word that he has given you
[1:51:56] do you think god wants you to let go of
[1:51:58] anything
[1:52:01] maybe there's something inside of you
[1:52:05] that god's been asking you to let go
[1:52:12] take his advice
