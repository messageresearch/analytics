[7:31] the people i'd write stuff down so don't
[7:32] forget but i do want to greet all of you
[7:34] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[7:36] also greet you on behalf of my pastor
[7:38] ray erickson in the church at
[7:40] true word tabernacle i i communicate
[7:42] with brother john this morning he's down
[7:44] there in georgia so he wanted me to
[7:46] greet y'all as well
[7:47] so and i greeted him and now i'm
[7:49] greeting him
[7:50] as he wanted me to greet you on the
[7:52] camera so
[7:54] man i'm getting confused
[7:55] [Laughter]
[7:56] so we want to greet you and also brother
[7:58] jeff snodgrass i was just speaking to
[8:00] him a little bit this morning he wants
[8:02] to greet you all as well and we just are
[8:04] grateful that uh
[8:06] you know what god is doing here with you
[8:08] a lot of a lot of people here today
[8:09] we're so happy to see you all amen if
[8:11] you have your bibles
[8:13] i'll try not to be too poetic here i
[8:15] could just talk all day but that's not
[8:16] why we came here we're going to look
[8:18] into the book of hebrews the 13th
[8:20] chapter
[8:21] this morning and then we'll also look
[8:22] into the book of matthew
[8:25] the 27th chapter
[8:27] i am reminded of the apostle paul's
[8:29] words of the corinthians
[8:31] he told him to purge out uh
[8:34] the old leaven that you may be a new
[8:36] lump
[8:37] and of course he's he's speaking and
[8:39] type about the passover he says even
[8:41] christ our passover is sanctified for us
[8:44] and we know that easter
[8:46] and this time of the year it ties into
[8:48] the the passover celebration
[8:51] and uh let's just read here in
[8:53] hebrews 13. we'll read verses 10 to 14
[8:56] then i'll have you turn to matthew 27
[8:58] verse 10 says this he says we
[9:00] excuse me here he says we have an altar
[9:02] whereof they have no right to eat which
[9:04] serve the tabernacle for the bodies of
[9:07] those beasts whose blood is brought into
[9:10] the sanctuary by the high priest for sin
[9:13] are burned without the camp wherefore
[9:16] jesus also that he might sanctify
[9:18] the people
[9:19] with his own blood suffered without the
[9:22] gate let us amen let us go forth
[9:25] therefore unto him without the camp
[9:28] bearing his reproach for here we have no
[9:31] continuing city but
[9:33] we seek one to come matthew 27 as you're
[9:37] turning there speaking about the the
[9:39] passover and things and my wife she's at
[9:42] home to at the home church today doing a
[9:43] sunday school lesson
[9:45] she's wanting to speak on the token and
[9:47] i'm like well did you do that on purpose
[9:48] or watch like well i just kind of
[9:50] felt to do that i said well it ties
[9:51] right into the passover and these things
[9:53] and we're so thankful for that
[9:56] um
[9:58] and uh
[9:59] maybe look at a little bit of that here
[10:00] just a little bit i i did think it was
[10:02] uh
[10:04] it's it was noteworthy because we were
[10:06] reading through exodus chapter 12 where
[10:07] it talks about it and uh you know they
[10:10] were to eat the the lamb in haste
[10:12] amen and i made the point see he moses
[10:16] is not telling them to get ready for an
[10:18] exodus he's saying be ready for an
[10:20] exodus don't just have your shoes nearby
[10:23] where you can get ready in five minutes
[10:24] be ready to leave at a moment's notice
[10:26] and the bible that morning come because
[10:28] the
[10:28] scripture moses told them don't don't
[10:30] leave your house until morning and the
[10:32] bible says when the morning come that
[10:33] they they left the self same day
[10:36] amen
[10:37] so they left the self same day and and
[10:39] so it is with the token message
[10:41] you know i'll just say this a lot of
[10:42] preachers you know they uh they'll take
[10:44] things that brother bram said they'll
[10:45] take the message and and try to make
[10:47] different things out of it but uh i
[10:49] believe that the evening time we've had
[10:50] a rising of the sun i believe we've had
[10:52] a shalom it's a good morning to us and
[10:54] people try to make that and say well you
[10:56] know the church ages seats and this and
[10:57] that but we find that the bible tells us
[10:59] in the book of genesis that evening and
[11:01] day were the first day evening and day
[11:03] were the second day the day didn't end
[11:05] at the morning but it was the
[11:06] fulfillment because the light came
[11:09] i hope you see what i'm saying so in
[11:10] other words our light has come but it's
[11:12] the self same day the same message the
[11:14] same power the same resurrection amen
[11:17] matthew 27
[11:20] i'm going to get ahead of myself here
[11:21] too much if i keep doing all this let's
[11:22] just read here matthew 27 we'll read
[11:24] verses 41 to 53
[11:28] i think it just take a few moments to
[11:29] read the scripture i don't think we have
[11:31] an issue with reading too much scripture
[11:33] hopefully so
[11:35] but uh the bible here is talking about
[11:36] when jesus was crucified and they hung
[11:38] them between these transgressors
[11:41] the bible says this in verse 41 likewise
[11:43] also the chief priests mocking him with
[11:45] the scribes and elders said he saved
[11:48] others
[11:49] himself
[11:50] he cannot save now brother brahm talks
[11:52] about this it's interesting because they
[11:54] didn't realize that they paid him the
[11:55] greatest compliment they could have ever
[11:56] paid him they confess he saved others
[12:00] they actually confess he saved others
[12:03] but he cannot save himself and they
[12:04] actually complement him it said if he be
[12:06] the king of israel let him now come down
[12:09] from the cross and we will believe him
[12:11] he trusted in god let him deliver him
[12:14] now if he will have him for he said i am
[12:17] the son of god the thieves also which
[12:19] were crucified with him cast the same in
[12:22] his teeth now from the sixth hour
[12:25] there was darkness over all the land
[12:27] unto the ninth hour now keep in mind
[12:29] this is 12 hour increments in the day so
[12:30] we're looking actually it's what would
[12:32] now be
[12:33] like a six hour passage of time for us
[12:35] amen
[12:36] about the ninth hour jesus cried with a
[12:39] loud voice saying eli eli lama
[12:42] sabachthani
[12:43] that is to say my god my god why
[12:48] hast thou forsaken me
[12:51] some of them that stood there when they
[12:52] heard that said this man calls for elias
[12:55] or elijah and straightway one of them
[12:58] ran and took a sponge and filled it with
[13:00] vinegar and put it on a reed and gave
[13:02] him to drink the rest said let me let us
[13:04] see whether elias will come to save him
[13:07] jesus when he had cried again with a
[13:08] loud voice yielded up the ghost and
[13:11] behold the veil of the temple was rent
[13:14] in twain from the top to the bottom and
[13:18] the earth did quake and the rocks rent
[13:21] and the graves were opened hallelujah
[13:23] and many bodies of the saints which
[13:25] slept arose and came out of the graves
[13:28] after his resurrection
[13:30] notice this and went into the holy city
[13:32] and appeared
[13:33] unto many may the lord bless the reading
[13:36] his word you may be seated
[13:38] a rather lengthy text to get to a very
[13:41] short title
[13:42] we look back here in
[13:44] the 46th verse and
[13:47] the lord jesus he's saying my god my god
[13:49] why hast thou forsaken me and my title
[13:52] for this morning is forsaken
[13:55] forsaken
[13:57] for something to be forsaken
[13:59] i looked up i don't know which
[14:01] dictionary i use i usually use the 1828
[14:03] noah's webster's which i noticed brother
[14:05] john has in his office but i didn't look
[14:06] this morning thank you brother but to be
[14:08] forsaken is to give up something that
[14:10] was formally valued enjoyed or held dear
[14:15] and uh i take this first text this
[14:17] morning in the book of hebrews brother
[14:18] branham uses the same text when he
[14:20] preaches the sermon going beyond the
[14:21] camp and he presents the thought that we
[14:23] must leave a certain kind of a camp
[14:26] with the intention of entering into
[14:28] another amen there's an there's an
[14:29] intention or there's a deliberate action
[14:31] behind it because there's many kinds of
[14:33] camps today amen many voices and ideas
[14:36] and identifications in the world today
[14:38] brother bram says god has a camp for his
[14:40] people
[14:42] he says the denomination has their own
[14:44] camp and there's many other camps of
[14:45] course which he alludes to uh one one of
[14:48] my favorite ones he talks about people
[14:49] left the camp of common sense
[14:51] amen
[14:53] that's a good one amen and i think i
[14:56] think it's becoming more and more
[14:57] pronounced
[14:58] all the time if it wasn't evident in
[15:00] 1964
[15:02] uh that people were leaving the camp of
[15:04] common sense perhaps 2022 has convinced
[15:06] you
[15:08] that maybe you finally convinced people
[15:09] have left the camp of common sense i
[15:12] mean when you have a and i don't mean to
[15:13] get political at this point but when you
[15:15] have a supreme court justice they can't
[15:17] tell you what the definition of a woman
[15:19] is implying you have to become a
[15:20] biologist which would make it scientific
[15:23] uh i think it's time to concede that
[15:25] people have left the camp of common
[15:28] sense hey man it should honestly should
[15:30] be called uncommon sense or super sense
[15:32] or rare sense or whatever because it's
[15:34] anything but common the the to reflect
[15:37] the scarcity of it amen i remember
[15:39] something smith wigglesworth said this
[15:41] is a hundred years ago now but
[15:42] wigglesworth made the point people need
[15:44] a revelation of common sense
[15:46] and it is it's almost it's like uh it's
[15:49] like a superpower it's really it's a
[15:50] misnomer it shouldn't be called common
[15:51] sense it should be something else amen
[15:53] but whatever you want to call it they've
[15:54] left it off amen they've left the right
[15:56] for the wrong they have forsaken reason
[16:00] for madness amen brother bram says they
[16:02] left the camp of of decency and reason
[16:05] amen now we look at the idea of
[16:07] reasoning many times we we tend to frown
[16:09] upon the idea of reasoning in the
[16:10] message because we know brother bram
[16:12] talks about people reasoning with the
[16:13] word but there's a right kind of a
[16:15] reasoning
[16:16] amen there's a right kind of a reasoning
[16:18] because the because god through the
[16:20] prophet isaiah he invites the people to
[16:22] come and reason with him amen so when we
[16:25] talk about the wrong kind of a reasoning
[16:27] what we're really talking about is the
[16:28] idea of of trying to rationalize our
[16:31] desire or our lust to do something wrong
[16:33] we'll take something and we're not
[16:35] really concerned about whether it's
[16:36] right or wrong we just want it to be
[16:38] right so people will rationalize it amen
[16:40] and listen you can do that with anything
[16:44] so let's not just leave that like it's
[16:45] some sort of a you know whatever where
[16:48] like you know that people can only do
[16:50] that with the word you can do that with
[16:52] anything but when you do it with the
[16:54] word and you compromise the word that's
[16:56] what brings death amen that's what
[16:58] happened in the garden well you'll not
[17:00] surely die yeah god said this but he
[17:03] didn't really mean it the way he said
[17:05] god says what he means and god means
[17:08] what he says he meant what he said when
[17:09] he said it and he proved it when they
[17:11] fell in the garden amen they were going
[17:13] to die amen and they did die
[17:16] so but but uh what i want you to
[17:18] understand is god is not also advocating
[17:20] that we forsake this sense of reason and
[17:23] and and and and be you know some sort of
[17:26] like i don't know crazy person or
[17:27] whatever i guess amen amen he's making
[17:31] listen to serve god is reasonable if you
[17:33] see the plan of god if you have
[17:35] revelation the plan of god is reasonable
[17:38] and that's what he's telling through the
[17:39] prophet isaiah listen it's reasonable to
[17:41] serve god if you obey me and you do
[17:43] these things you'll be blessed and if
[17:45] you rebel you'll be devoured
[17:48] so it's it's reasonable to serve god
[17:50] amen not trying to rationalize your own
[17:52] lust
[17:53] or your own disobedience but to have an
[17:56] understanding of god's will in your life
[17:59] amen we should have that kind of sense
[18:01] we should have an understanding we
[18:02] should be wise knowing what the will of
[18:04] the lord is the bible says amen so that
[18:07] kind of reason or common sense the
[18:09] reasonable kind of common sense amen the
[18:12] reasonable kind of reason
[18:14] i should put that on a piece of paper
[18:16] and and do something with it i guess
[18:17] amen but it comes with an understanding
[18:20] it will lead you to life and to wisdom
[18:22] amen
[18:23] you know when i we pray and we do
[18:25] devotions with the kids in the evening i
[18:26] pray different things with him and among
[18:28] the different things we pray about we
[18:29] talk about one of the things i i pray
[18:31] for my children is that god would help
[18:32] them to always discern between right and
[18:34] wrong
[18:35] and not only just between right and
[18:37] wrong but right and almost right
[18:39] because almost right is still wrong
[18:41] but it looks almost right
[18:43] listen this this is the most deceiving
[18:45] age there's ever been
[18:46] it's not just what's wrong it's what
[18:48] looks right but it's still wrong
[18:51] because listen there's all kinds of
[18:52] things that look good there's you know
[18:53] that old saying the road to hell is paid
[18:56] with good intentions that's true
[18:58] amen it's true there's there's all kinds
[19:00] of well-meaning deliberate ideas and
[19:03] it's just a snare of the devil and of
[19:05] the world that's what makes them so
[19:07] attractive they don't look wrong but
[19:10] they are
[19:11] and that's what makes it such a snare
[19:13] amen you you look at this scripture and
[19:15] you look at this time of of celebration
[19:17] we're talking about with easter and
[19:18] stuff when jesus came into that holy
[19:20] city at the beginning of the week the
[19:22] people gathered around they took palm
[19:25] leaves they laid him down at his feet
[19:27] they cried hosanna hosanna blessed is he
[19:29] that comes in the name of the lord and
[19:31] it wasn't just a few days later the very
[19:33] same people were there crying out
[19:35] crucify him amen now why was it because
[19:39] they were inspired by their leaders amen
[19:42] oh let's take this man he's a rebel he's
[19:45] this he's that crucified they're
[19:47] inspired and these common people they
[19:49] they they have no discernment to realize
[19:51] they're in sin doing this
[19:53] and the very one that they had propped
[19:55] up and they lauded over how great he was
[19:57] and bless he blessed is he that comes in
[19:59] the name of the lord just a few days
[20:00] later they chose
[20:03] they chose to release a murderer over
[20:05] the prince of life
[20:07] thinking it was a good idea
[20:10] then people didn't sit there saying oh
[20:11] we're a bunch of terrible heathen devil
[20:13] pagans and this is god's chosen people
[20:16] they didn't think they were wrong but
[20:18] they were wrong but yet it was the plan
[20:20] of god got ordained amen
[20:23] amen
[20:24] so they didn't just condemn the lord i
[20:26] want you to remember really remember
[20:28] this they didn't just condemn the lord
[20:30] they they they chose to free a murderer
[20:32] to do it amen they went out of their way
[20:35] to release this man to do it amen and
[20:37] you know people they sneer and say well
[20:39] well how could somebody do such a thing
[20:41] but the scribes of the pharisees said
[20:42] the same thing to jesus oh well listen
[20:45] if we lived in the days of our fathers
[20:47] they said we would have been partakers
[20:49] of their blood with the prophets and
[20:51] jesus said you're your own witness
[20:52] against yourself that you you fill up
[20:54] the measure of your fathers oh if i
[20:56] didn't live back there i didn't ever i
[20:58] didn't ever persecute the prophets
[21:00] you're doing the same thing today to
[21:01] jesus
[21:02] and so it is today still amen people
[21:05] they go to an easter service at a church
[21:08] somewhere they say listen if i had been
[21:10] in that crowd i just stood up i would
[21:12] have never condemned jesus i'd have
[21:14] never come against them and yet they'll
[21:15] stand right in a church and they'll
[21:17] crucify the word of fresh today
[21:19] they've crucified it with their own
[21:21] ideas their own dogmas their own
[21:23] interpretations they've crucified the
[21:25] word hebrews chapter 6.
[21:27] they crucify him today all the while
[21:30] saying oh we would have never done these
[21:31] things it's no different than the
[21:32] scribes and the pharisees
[21:36] amen and they fill up the measure of
[21:38] their fathers
[21:39] amen they've got a camp brother ram
[21:41] talks about the camp of tradition amen
[21:43] easter is just an annual observation
[21:45] they get together and they commemorate
[21:47] this traditional idea that the
[21:49] resurrection was a historical event
[21:51] brothers and sisters the resurrection is
[21:53] more than a historical event for you and
[21:56] i today
[21:57] if we receive the same spirit that was
[21:59] in christ that raised him from the dead
[22:01] if we've got the same thing we have
[22:03] entered into our easter easter's every
[22:06] day for us the resurrection is in you
[22:08] and i
[22:09] he's in you and i testifying he is a lie
[22:13] today
[22:15] go and tell the world go and tell
[22:17] everybody he's alive and well he's been
[22:19] resurrected
[22:22] how do you know because he lives in his
[22:23] people
[22:25] you think about this jesus told his own
[22:26] disciples listen it's expedient for me
[22:29] or actually i don't know he said it's
[22:31] exceeded for you if i go
[22:35] amen it's expedient oh if jesus were
[22:38] here today and if he were here and he
[22:40] could do these things oh what a great
[22:41] thing it would be if jesus was with us
[22:43] today jesus is with us today
[22:46] he said it's expedient in other words
[22:47] you're better off if i go what do you
[22:50] mean he says if i go i'll send you a
[22:52] comforter he will even guide you into
[22:54] all truth
[22:56] amen what you've seen me do you're going
[22:58] to go do it the works that i do you
[23:01] shall do and greater than these because
[23:03] i go to the father
[23:05] see how people they cling to this this
[23:07] historical idea oh if the lord jesus
[23:09] says man we're here listen if the lord
[23:11] jesus as a man were here today with nail
[23:14] scarred hands and wearing a robe he
[23:16] could no more heal you today than i
[23:18] could because he already did it 2 000
[23:20] years ago when they bury the price on
[23:23] his own back
[23:25] you don't lack for anything today if his
[23:28] spirit is with you
[23:29] it's actually better
[23:33] now you can do the same things
[23:35] you can have the same life
[23:37] amen praise the lord we look at it and
[23:39] brother bram talks about in the rising
[23:40] of the sun what a resurrection that was
[23:42] and we thank god for it because if there
[23:44] wasn't we'd have no reason to be here
[23:46] today amen if christ has not risen of
[23:49] all men we are the most miserable i mean
[23:52] what a resurrection that was he says but
[23:54] what a resurrection this is to be
[23:56] resurrected out of dark
[23:58] denominationalism and man's ideas to
[24:01] know that he's the same
[24:02] today listen he didn't just it's not
[24:05] like lazarus he didn't just raise up and
[24:07] then die again listen lazarus raised up
[24:10] he come back from the grave four days
[24:11] later but he died again but jesus died
[24:14] he rose again and he's alive forevermore
[24:18] he didn't wander off somewhere and die
[24:20] of old age he's the same today as he was
[24:22] when he come out of that tomb that day
[24:26] [Music]
[24:29] we have found god has a camp for his
[24:31] people
[24:32] amen the shout of the kings in that camp
[24:34] he praise god
[24:35] amen this is a place this camp all
[24:37] things are possible amen in this camp
[24:40] everything is possible with men it's
[24:42] impossible but with god all things are
[24:44] possible
[24:46] amen
[24:48] god's come out of
[24:50] god's not limited to history amen he's
[24:52] found preeminence in the hearts of a
[24:54] believing people that's the true easter
[24:56] seal amen not just a bunch of lilies on
[24:58] the altar but souls on the altar souls
[25:01] that have given themselves holy to jesus
[25:03] christ that's the easter seal today
[25:07] we've gone beyond the camp with christ
[25:10] bearing his reproach
[25:12] we might be found in him amen
[25:15] what you know is when you truly go
[25:16] beyond the camp you must forsake
[25:19] everything that's there
[25:21] and everything that's there will forsake
[25:22] you
[25:25] well i said a lot there real quick but
[25:27] it's the truth amen paul said the world
[25:29] is crucified to me and i'm crucified to
[25:32] the world we've got nothing left to
[25:34] touch base on amen
[25:36] the children of obedience and
[25:38] disobedience they've got nothing in
[25:40] common you say well listen we all go to
[25:43] mcdonald's we all drive cars that's not
[25:45] what he's talking about he's talking
[25:46] about the divine nature your nature is
[25:49] not of this world it's a resurrected
[25:52] nature it's a living nature it's really
[25:54] regenerating nature it's god's nature
[25:57] all things are of him they're by him
[26:00] that he might have the preeminence
[26:02] amen
[26:04] hell praise the lord see you couldn't
[26:07] stay in that first camp if you're a son
[26:08] of god i mean jesus couldn't jesus could
[26:11] not stay there because his purpose his
[26:14] will was to be fulfilled outside the
[26:15] camp of man's ideas
[26:17] outside the camp of religion amen
[26:20] listen uh he he can't stay there why
[26:23] because a servant doesn't abide in the
[26:24] house forever but a son abides forever
[26:27] if you come into this house if you're a
[26:29] son of god not just a servant not just a
[26:32] good reformed church member if you're a
[26:34] son or daughter of god amen a son abides
[26:38] forever
[26:39] therefore if the son has set you free
[26:42] you are free indeed
[26:44] listen you might have served sin for a
[26:46] season but that's not your heritage
[26:49] you're the sons and daughters of god
[26:51] this house abides forever and neither
[26:54] they abide forever with it
[26:58] amen
[26:59] listen beloved you you might not you
[27:02] might not be the most popular people in
[27:03] the world today
[27:05] maybe you are i don't know
[27:07] chances are we're not the most popular
[27:09] people in the world today amen you might
[27:11] not all live lavish lifestyles listen a
[27:14] lot of us have probably had to pass up
[27:15] opportunities in our life as christians
[27:18] we had to pass up opportunities for
[27:20] things that would have benefited us
[27:22] naturally speaking but we would rather
[27:24] stay true to the word of god because we
[27:26] forsook all those things that we might
[27:29] have christ
[27:31] all the things that paul had is his
[27:33] position saul of tarsus a pharisee of
[27:36] the pharisees circumcised on the eighth
[27:38] day the stock of benjamin concerning the
[27:41] law he was blameless he forsook all
[27:43] those things to obtain christ
[27:48] amen
[27:51] it might not have benefited you as a
[27:52] natural person but it meant something to
[27:55] you to apprehend christ amen and listen
[27:57] what is the benefit what is what does it
[27:59] all mean for you you're free today
[28:02] oh hallelujah somebody you might not be
[28:04] the wealthiest or the most popular the
[28:06] most exciting but you're free
[28:09] amen you're the freest people that's on
[28:10] the face of the earth today amen listen
[28:13] they can lock you in a prison throw away
[28:15] the key they can chain you up like paul
[28:17] and silas you're the freest people in
[28:19] the world today
[28:21] you found liberty from your greatest
[28:23] enemy yourself
[28:26] god set you free from you from your past
[28:28] from your sin from your heritage all
[28:31] those things were against you
[28:33] but he set you free today
[28:37] amen if you're in christ you're the
[28:38] freest person there is amen
[28:42] well look at this idea this this morning
[28:45] so we're talking about forsaking things
[28:47] and i'm talking about we you know we've
[28:48] given up things many of us have amen
[28:51] this idea of sacrifice
[28:53] i mean the idea of sacrifice
[28:56] entails that you have to forsake
[28:57] something amen because then make it a
[28:59] sacrifice you have to offer up something
[29:02] of valuable
[29:03] and why would you give up something of
[29:05] value because you believe it's
[29:07] worthwhile to do it
[29:09] hey man
[29:10] this this idea of sacrifice is it's
[29:12] interesting because even in nature it's
[29:14] you don't see you know you know monkeys
[29:16] and dolphins and stuff it's not really
[29:17] imitating nature it's something about
[29:19] man
[29:20] something about man why because man was
[29:21] made in the image of god it's something
[29:23] about the divine nature that's portrayed
[29:25] a man this idea of sacrifice and you
[29:28] know i come in here and
[29:30] i got up this morning you're all really
[29:31] interested in this i'm sure i got up
[29:33] this morning and i've just put my
[29:35] clothes on and i've been doing this
[29:36] intermittent fasting i'm down like 15
[29:38] pounds i felt real good about myself i
[29:39] went with my wife who still sleeps hey
[29:41] honey look at this i got all this room
[29:43] she didn't care
[29:44] she's like okay that's great i'm back to
[29:46] sleep
[29:49] i come in here and i man i feel like a
[29:50] million bucks i look at brother mark i'm
[29:52] like oh my goodness this guy looks like
[29:53] he's got anorexia i need to lay hands on
[29:55] him
[29:56] i see brother roger i'm like man
[29:58] i thought i was doing real well
[30:02] well praise the lord at least i'm going
[30:04] the right direction or whatever for once
[30:06] we'll see how long it lasts
[30:09] listen i had to give up all them late
[30:11] night snacks
[30:13] that wasn't easy because i'm used to
[30:14] doing that
[30:15] hey man i do my best eating between 11
[30:17] and 12 o'clock at night
[30:19] get me a peanut butter sandwich get me
[30:21] some popcorn got some leftover steak
[30:23] throw a little bacon in there you know
[30:24] drink some lard eat some mayonnaise
[30:26] whatever
[30:28] well then you wonder why you're gaining
[30:30] 20 pounds a month i'm like i don't know
[30:32] lord what is it
[30:34] being dumb that's why
[30:37] and then i had to make some
[30:38] honestly i feel great you know just stop
[30:40] eating after 6 00 p.m well that's really
[30:43] that really shouldn't be that hard but
[30:45] it kind of was
[30:46] i'm doing a lot better listen
[30:48] look at him either the idea of dieting
[30:50] we you you give up certain foods you
[30:52] give up certain activities because it's
[30:54] beneficial to you in the long run
[30:56] amen
[30:58] that's just a natural cycle it's not
[30:59] like a sacrifice unto god amen but just
[31:01] to give you an idea amen that there's
[31:03] something about men they and women they
[31:06] see something noble they see something
[31:07] worthwhile maybe it's the country they
[31:09] live in or whatever it is they're
[31:10] willing to make a sacrifice that's going
[31:13] to cost them personally for something
[31:15] that is greater in the long run amen it
[31:18] takes a certain level of dedication and
[31:21] discipline because the real value of a
[31:23] sacrifice it's not so much what you're
[31:25] sacrificing it's what it means to you
[31:28] amen
[31:29] when you're whatever you're willing to
[31:30] forsake to obtain a goal or to please
[31:32] god whatever that sacrifice entails amen
[31:35] you look at abraham and his great test
[31:37] when god tells me to take i want you to
[31:39] take your only son isaac i want you to
[31:41] take him up and offer him as a sacrifice
[31:43] unto me listen he didn't ask abraham to
[31:45] go take a lamb or a goat or even one of
[31:48] his household servants i want you to
[31:50] take the most precious thing to you
[31:54] i want to take the dearest thing to you
[31:55] listen isaac is not just one of his many
[31:58] that's his son that's his promise god
[32:01] every promise god gave abraham was tied
[32:04] up in this isaac and he raises isaac and
[32:06] he loves isaac and that's his sword and
[32:08] at the end of it
[32:09] this child he's listen he's grown up
[32:11] enough to help his daddy take the wood
[32:13] up and lay himself down he knew what's
[32:14] going on
[32:15] hey man this is just a little boy but
[32:17] isaac goes up and and abraham says i
[32:19] want to take the isaac that you're
[32:21] attached to that you love that you've
[32:23] invested yourself in offer him as a
[32:26] sacrifice
[32:30] amen
[32:32] of course we know god stopped it but god
[32:34] required from him the most precious
[32:36] thing the very manifestation
[32:38] of god's promise to him god is requiring
[32:40] it back from him that's what makes it so
[32:42] significant amen so it's a real
[32:44] sacrifice to serve god
[32:47] amen listen it has to be or else
[32:49] everybody would do it
[32:52] if it was just a matter of going to
[32:54] church you just put your name on a book
[32:55] and this and that everybody would do
[32:57] that just to be safe
[32:59] amen but when you realize there's a
[33:00] reproach that comes with serving christ
[33:02] amen that's what moses saw in egypt he
[33:05] saw the riches of egypt but he saw the
[33:07] reproach of christ
[33:09] them slaves and a bunch of mud pits
[33:11] splashing around in bondage and he
[33:13] esteemed the reproach of christ greater
[33:16] than the riches of egypt
[33:19] amen
[33:20] so there's like there's a cost
[33:23] associated with it make no mistake you
[33:24] said well listen look what god offers
[33:26] you in return yeah that that's that's
[33:28] what makes it so great amen we esteem it
[33:30] like moses amen
[33:32] that's why we're willing to go beyond
[33:34] the camp with christ is to bear the
[33:36] reproach
[33:38] we're willing to suffer on his behalf
[33:40] because the bible says he is a rewarder
[33:42] of them that diligently seek him
[33:44] we believe there's a greater reward in
[33:46] serving god even if it would cost us
[33:48] something in this life to do so listen
[33:50] it might cost you your life
[33:53] you say it's free it's paid for yeah but
[33:54] it might cost you something you might
[33:56] have to forfeit your life or you might
[33:58] lose friend listen brother brandon when
[33:59] he preaches the seals what's he saying
[34:01] he says i'm gonna i'll probably lose ten
[34:03] thousands of my friends
[34:05] hey man i don't have ten thousand
[34:06] friends
[34:07] they got like 300 facebook half of them
[34:09] i don't know who they are
[34:12] amen
[34:13] well praise the lord listen this guy had
[34:15] friends everybody wanted to come preach
[34:17] he said i'm going to lose all that just
[34:19] stay true to this word
[34:24] amen
[34:26] so there's a cost associated with it
[34:27] amen
[34:28] brother bram says this in 1959 dying
[34:31] living dying buried rising coming he
[34:33] says in the scriptures in the old
[34:34] testament this is the sin offering when
[34:36] they got the two goats he said these
[34:38] goats
[34:39] he said jesus represented both of them
[34:41] or they represented him rather he said
[34:43] the one goat was killed and the other
[34:45] was the sins of the nation was placed
[34:46] upon this goat called the scapegoat amen
[34:50] that goat had to go out in the
[34:51] wilderness to die
[34:53] and be out there alone
[34:55] amongst the beasts and so forth jesus
[34:57] had to be that goat he said i want you
[34:59] to notice he was a lamb he was sheep but
[35:02] he was made goat for you and i that we
[35:04] bingo might become sheep
[35:07] we being guilt sinners guilty of death
[35:10] subject to death all sold out under
[35:13] condemnation yet christ become me that i
[35:16] through his grace might become him a son
[35:19] of god seated at the right hand of glory
[35:25] paul makes this point in the book of
[35:26] hebrews where i read
[35:28] you look at all the different offerings
[35:29] that were done without the camp you look
[35:30] at the red heifer they took the red
[35:32] heifer out and they slayed it they burnt
[35:33] the ashes and what they did they made
[35:35] the waters of separation i mean there's
[35:37] a waters this words are waters of
[35:39] separation it distinct it distinguishes
[35:42] us it separates us from the rest of the
[35:44] world it sanctifies us we're marked
[35:47] we've been set apart by the waters of
[35:49] the washing the water of the word amen
[35:51] waters of separation where was it
[35:53] prepared outside the camp
[35:56] where the scapegoat go outside the camp
[35:58] amen christ could never fulfill his
[36:00] purpose in the camp
[36:02] that red heifer could never fulfill its
[36:04] purpose in the camp
[36:06] amen
[36:07] it had to go beyond the camp and bear
[36:09] reproach
[36:10] amen i'm saying all this for a reason
[36:13] i'm taking a few moments just to lay
[36:14] this out but
[36:15] to really forsake something talk about
[36:17] the idea of forsaking now to really
[36:20] forsake something like i talk about with
[36:21] this lamb i talk about isaac you have to
[36:24] to have some manner of attachment to it
[36:27] amen
[36:29] amen
[36:30] you know i i make this point frequently
[36:32] i said you know when i come to the lord
[36:34] i i had nothing
[36:35] so it was really easy to give up
[36:37] everything lord i'll give you everything
[36:38] that's easy to do when you got nothing
[36:40] but when you've got something when
[36:42] you've been blessed like abraham can you
[36:43] still give it all to god or did you just
[36:46] get too blessed for your own good
[36:48] we got so enlarged just like king saul
[36:50] when king saul was small in his own eyes
[36:53] it was an easy thing to serve god but
[36:54] when he had power when he had popularity
[36:56] when he had a success in the military
[36:58] and all these things he couldn't find
[37:00] that same kind of a surrender all of a
[37:02] sudden right right
[37:04] hey man but when you have a real
[37:05] attachment or something's really dear to
[37:07] you and you can still forfeit it to
[37:09] forsake it that's what makes it a
[37:11] sacrifice that's why god throughout the
[37:13] scripture whenever they're making a
[37:15] sacrifice they take their flock or their
[37:16] turtle does whatever god always required
[37:19] their best
[37:22] their worst he said i want to take the
[37:23] uh you know a lamb of the first year
[37:25] without blemish i wish amen don't don't
[37:28] take the one that nobody wants anyway
[37:30] the one that's lame he's only got one
[37:31] listen in the book of malachi that was
[37:33] the very thing god condemned the
[37:35] priesthood over there their offerings
[37:36] were profane they didn't bring their
[37:38] best they brought what nobody else
[37:39] wanted
[37:41] and what does god say he says listen if
[37:43] you took this to the governor if you
[37:45] took this to a king would he accept this
[37:47] offering
[37:48] he'd be insulted and yet you're gonna
[37:50] give it to me and i'm the judge of the
[37:52] whole earth i'm a great king i'm god
[37:54] almighty
[37:56] you give your best to your employer you
[37:58] give your best to your spouse and you're
[37:59] not you can't give the best to god
[38:02] something's wrong with your your
[38:03] testimony
[38:05] god's not requiring the least thing in
[38:07] your flock he's requiring your best
[38:12] men brother bram talks about blind
[38:13] bartimaeus before he was healed of his
[38:15] eyesight his wife had an issue brother
[38:17] ram said he had this little lamb it was
[38:18] like a seeing eye dog this little lamb
[38:20] was his guide he said and one day he he
[38:22] was praying to god said god if you'll
[38:23] heal my wife i'll give you this lamb as
[38:25] a sacrifice i'll give this unto you and
[38:27] god healed his wife
[38:29] so he's on his way to the temple to
[38:31] offer up this lamb and the priest now
[38:33] why not watch this that's what i'm
[38:34] talking about the priest said listen you
[38:36] need that lamb that's your eyes it's
[38:38] like you know that's how you get around
[38:40] that's your guide he said listen i'll
[38:42] give you the money and i'll buy you a
[38:44] lamb and you can offer that as a
[38:45] sacrifice to please god
[38:48] and blind barbarian said no i didn't
[38:49] promise god a lamb i promised him this
[38:52] lamb
[38:54] because it meant something to me that's
[38:57] why i promised this lamb amen that's
[38:59] what made it special
[39:01] amen you you look i was talking to
[39:03] brother john about this just the other
[39:04] day you look at david
[39:07] and in second samuel
[39:09] uh david uh you know he he he sees
[39:12] bathsheba he takes bathsheba to himself
[39:14] and then he he ends up having uriah the
[39:16] hit type murdered so he can marry this
[39:18] woman the prophet nathan comes to david
[39:20] and he gives him this parable he said
[39:22] you know there was a rich man and he had
[39:23] many sheep and he had great flocks and
[39:25] he was a rich man and one day a stranger
[39:27] come to visit him he said no i've got to
[39:29] fix some something to eat and rather
[39:31] than take from all of his sheep which he
[39:33] had there was a poor guy
[39:35] just down the street
[39:36] amen he said this man was poor he just
[39:39] had one little you
[39:40] lamb wander the lamb oh my think about
[39:43] this now he said he had one little lamb
[39:45] he said and it grew up with him it grew
[39:47] up with his children
[39:49] it ate from his bowl it drank from his
[39:51] cup it laid in his bosom it was his a
[39:54] daughter unto him
[39:56] some of you all pet owners know what i'm
[39:57] talking about
[39:58] somebody like i mean that's ridiculous
[39:59] well
[40:00] he was attached to his little lamb amen
[40:03] you say that i don't think that's that
[40:05] big of a deal well david did because
[40:07] when david heard how this rich man took
[40:08] it listen david said that man needs to
[40:10] die
[40:12] not knowing it was actually about
[40:13] himself it's a parable but i want you
[40:15] know david's reaction the man wasn't
[40:17] murdered it wasn't his natural children
[40:20] it was his lamb
[40:22] david as a shepherd he was so incensed
[40:24] to anger about this transgression that
[40:27] man deserves to die for taking that lamb
[40:31] why because it was special to him
[40:33] that lamb might not have been special to
[40:35] you it wasn't really special the rich
[40:37] man he just wanted to give up something
[40:38] of his own amen but it was special to
[40:41] that man
[40:42] and that's what made it such a
[40:43] transgression
[40:46] hey man
[40:47] david wasn't going to kill this rich man
[40:48] because he stole a human child or he's a
[40:50] murderer and that because he's robbed
[40:52] him of his dear lamb
[40:56] my wife and i we uh
[40:58] that's why i brought up brother john my
[41:00] wife and i we had a we had a little
[41:01] white fluffy dog we named her mita
[41:04] after sister meeting stuff and and uh
[41:06] maria actually bought her
[41:08] around the time we got engaged and uh
[41:11] that was that was over 15 years ago
[41:14] and uh just a few days ago after 15
[41:15] years i we had to i had to go put our
[41:18] dog
[41:18] down and uh i don't care to tell you
[41:21] this really but i guess i'm going to you
[41:23] know i i've lost plenty of family
[41:25] members i've preached their funerals
[41:26] i've buried friends
[41:28] i had a friend when i was younger he was
[41:29] shot and killed he was just a teenager
[41:31] it was uh almost 18 years ago uh april
[41:34] 19th i believe
[41:36] you know i i've been through all those
[41:38] things but honestly that our dog died
[41:40] and that was probably one of the hardest
[41:41] things i've ever had to do
[41:44] i didn't know i'd take it so hard
[41:46] and like i said i don't hardly care to
[41:47] admit to be honest but i'm saying to
[41:48] make a point amen you get attached to
[41:51] something yeah something's dear to you
[41:53] and i wasn't offered as a sacrifice but
[41:55] you think about these that was that was
[41:57] the significance of offering these
[41:59] things brother graham said they take
[42:00] that land that they raise they take
[42:02] their bass they take their first sling
[42:03] or whatever and they'd offer it and
[42:05] watch it bleed and they'd watch it die
[42:07] and feel it and they realize this
[42:09] innocent creature had to pay a price
[42:12] for my sin it made you feel bad you
[42:15] realize listen my sin is a big deal
[42:18] we act like we just go to church oh well
[42:20] i went to church god forgive me i just
[42:21] god forgive me i'm fine
[42:23] somebody paid a price
[42:26] more than just a lamb the son of god the
[42:28] lamb of god paid a price
[42:31] amen that's what makes it you look and
[42:33] say you know what my sin was not a light
[42:35] issue
[42:36] my transgression and my rebellion
[42:38] against god it was not a simple thing it
[42:41] cost something
[42:45] there's a sincerity that comes with that
[42:47] amen
[42:48] that's why i say we forsake things amen
[42:51] uh listen
[42:53] i i really thought about this several
[42:54] years ago my my pastor he'd asked me to
[42:56] preach easter sunday at the home church
[42:58] and
[42:59] i had plenty of time to get ready and i
[43:01] had a few weeks and i'm steady and i'm
[43:02] praying like man i'm gonna preach easter
[43:03] sunday everybody's gonna be there even
[43:05] people that never come
[43:08] i was gonna say happy easter and merry
[43:09] christmas you know
[43:12] i'm getting ready and i'm studying oh
[43:14] man praise god we're going to have a
[43:16] good time we're going to be shouting
[43:18] we're going to be you know all this
[43:19] stuff
[43:21] and i'm sitting there and i'm listening
[43:22] to going beyond the camp like i've been
[43:24] talking about i'm i'm studying the
[43:25] message i'm reading through the bible
[43:26] i'm praying
[43:28] and i'm like i don't know where any of
[43:29] this is going
[43:31] amen
[43:32] i have no idea where i'm going with any
[43:34] of this and listen i was riding to
[43:36] church my i had my wife drive sunday
[43:38] morning easter morning i'm riding to
[43:40] church i have no idea what i'm preaching
[43:42] that day now i don't know if you can
[43:44] relate to that or not but i was a little
[43:45] nervous at that point
[43:47] hey man
[43:49] to be totally honest i was fit to be
[43:51] tied
[43:52] and then i'm like i i have done
[43:54] everything i can i have i have laid
[43:56] before the lord and i've prayed and i've
[43:59] tried and here i am i'm gonna look like
[44:01] a complete idiot
[44:03] i've got 66 books and 1100 messages you
[44:06] couldn't find anything to preach for
[44:07] easter sunday what kind of idiot are you
[44:12] hey man
[44:13] and i'm going there brother bruce you
[44:15] probably related a little bit you're
[44:16] just like pulling your hair out like
[44:18] lord what are you doing to me why why
[44:20] are you doing this to me and listen i i
[44:22] i won't forget it because i was sitting
[44:24] there and i was praying at that moment
[44:25] said lord i i feel i've i've done all
[44:28] these things i've consecrated myself for
[44:30] the people saying i have no idea what
[44:32] you want from me
[44:34] i say i felt like an orphan child and
[44:36] this is what i said i pray i said lord i
[44:37] feel so forsaken
[44:40] and right then god spoke to me said
[44:41] that's exactly what i was waiting on
[44:43] amen
[44:45] god's got a way of saying something to
[44:46] change the whole situation god said
[44:48] that's exactly what i was waiting for
[44:50] that's exactly what i wanted you to feel
[44:52] because that's what i want you to preach
[44:53] about
[44:55] and it begin to dawn and just begin to
[44:57] come together that amen we celebrate
[44:59] this great celebration of easter because
[45:01] god forsook his son jesus christ
[45:06] he offered him up and he made him a
[45:07] sacrifice his soul was an offering for
[45:10] sin amen you and i feel forsaken
[45:12] sometimes by friends by family by the
[45:14] world sometimes we feel forsaken by god
[45:17] but jesus was forsaken
[45:21] if he had not been forsaken there'd be
[45:23] no resurrection listen christ was
[45:25] forsaken by the religious people he came
[45:28] to his own and his own received him not
[45:31] he was forsaken by the religious people
[45:33] he was forsaken by his friends forsaken
[45:36] by the romans forsaken by his own
[45:38] disciples
[45:39] listen that would have been bad enough
[45:41] but they had to hang them between heaven
[45:43] and earth because even the earth in
[45:44] heaven didn't want him and finally the
[45:46] one person
[45:48] the one person you thought would take
[45:49] him in he cries out to his father and
[45:51] his own father
[45:54] turns his face away
[46:03] most of us would have broke under the
[46:04] friends and the disciples and the people
[46:07] amen most of us would just give up
[46:09] but here's christ on a cross and even
[46:11] his father forsakes him amen
[46:17] you imagine being forsaken but god
[46:18] almighty himself
[46:20] amen listen we frequently
[46:23] we meditate on the severity of christ's
[46:25] sacrifice we take the communion we look
[46:28] at his his broken body his shed blood
[46:30] when we do these things in remembrance
[46:31] of him amen we look at the we look at
[46:34] the nails on his hand the nail scars and
[46:36] the stripes on his back we think of the
[46:37] weight of the cross
[46:39] we think of all these things that he
[46:40] endured but i think many times we forget
[46:42] the greatest tragedy was separation
[46:47] amen brother bam says we bypassed the
[46:48] theophany we came here to be tested we
[46:51] don't remember anything before this life
[46:53] we were just in the mind of god we were
[46:54] thoughts of god there was nothing there
[46:56] i mean we've got no memory we've got no
[46:58] recollection listen you and i were born
[47:00] in sin we were shaped in iniquity we we
[47:03] know what that's like
[47:05] we didn't come to this world knowing all
[47:07] things and this you know what i'm saying
[47:09] we we know what it's like we feel that
[47:12] way even now we feel alone we feel
[47:15] abandoned at times amen
[47:18] but listen jesus never bypassed that
[47:20] amen even before the spirit descended on
[47:22] him at the jordan river amen when he was
[47:25] a boy he was teaching the teachers and
[47:27] the temples he said i'm about my
[47:29] father's business
[47:31] he knew who he was he knew where he'd
[47:34] been listen he knew he wasn't just
[47:36] saying because he read it somewhere he
[47:38] said listen i beheld satan fall from
[47:40] heaven like lightning
[47:42] i remember it
[47:44] they said before abraham was i am
[47:47] i was there i remember it
[47:50] that logos that proceeded from the
[47:52] father he'd always been together amen
[47:57] think about this he's never been
[47:59] separate from god we were born that way
[48:02] we're used to it he's never been
[48:04] separate from his father
[48:07] and now
[48:08] all of a sudden
[48:10] he he's he's been in glory he's seen the
[48:12] angels he's done all these things on
[48:14] this cross now even god
[48:18] separates from him yeah and for the
[48:20] first time
[48:21] in all of history
[48:23] jesus is alone
[48:28] amen
[48:30] brother represented that great crucial
[48:32] hour until he suffered knowing all
[48:35] things
[48:36] until the water and blood separated in
[48:38] his body great drops of sweat like blood
[48:41] dropped from his brow brother ram says
[48:43] this he died more death in gethsemane
[48:45] than he did on the cross
[48:47] what do you mean it was there he made a
[48:49] decision not my will
[48:54] listen he didn't he wasn't excited about
[48:56] easter
[48:57] he wasn't excited about good friday oh
[48:59] man i can't wait to get on the cross
[49:01] praise god
[49:03] father if it's possible
[49:06] if there's any way out of this
[49:08] let this cup pass for me nevertheless
[49:12] not my will but thing be done
[49:16] listen he looked at the cross he
[49:18] despised the shame but he endured it
[49:20] because of the joy
[49:22] because the prize was greater than the
[49:24] price
[49:25] the prize was greater than the price to
[49:27] him
[49:29] wants to hang on a cross and suffer and
[49:31] be rejected by everybody hanging on a
[49:33] cross naked to where even god the father
[49:36] forsakes you
[49:37] nobody does that with a you know spring
[49:40] in their step so to speak
[49:44] there is on the cross
[49:45] why
[49:48] why hast thou forsaken me
[49:52] brotherham says this that same sermon
[49:54] living dying
[49:56] he says the love that he had how he
[49:57] expressed it
[49:58] how he had to make his self himself what
[50:00] he was to die to save us his death when
[50:03] he died at calvary there was never a
[50:04] death could be like that death
[50:06] we are told when the roman soldier
[50:08] pierced his side there was water and
[50:09] blood came out of his side i asked a
[50:11] chemist one time ah there's a guy drove
[50:13] me on the way up here his his license
[50:15] plate was like c6 h it was a chemical oh
[50:17] my god must be a chemist i guess i
[50:19] didn't know you could get uh
[50:20] subscriptions on your license plate but
[50:22] i guess you could he had a chemical
[50:23] compound formula or whatever the message
[50:26] yeah that was free
[50:29] i asked the chemist one time was taking
[50:30] place this fellow being a christian he
[50:32] said that was not he said jesus did not
[50:34] jesus did not die because the spirit
[50:36] touched his side
[50:37] or pierced his side said jesus had been
[50:39] dead a long time before that but he died
[50:42] from grief
[50:45] remember no man could take his life
[50:47] he had to lay it down that's why he gave
[50:49] up the ghost you couldn't take it from
[50:51] him
[50:52] the spear the sword didn't kill the
[50:54] cross didn't kill he gave it up he laid
[50:56] it down
[50:58] it was grief that killed him when he
[51:00] looked out upon the ones that he loved
[51:04] and the ones he had worked his miracles
[51:06] on
[51:07] the ones he'd expressed his love toward
[51:09] and had fed and see that they had
[51:11] turned him down
[51:13] he said you and i might be grieved
[51:16] we might grieve
[51:17] but we could never grieve like that
[51:20] because we're not made up of that kind
[51:22] of material that we could have that much
[51:23] grief
[51:24] listen you and i we identify with the
[51:26] idea if we all know what it's like to
[51:27] grieve amen
[51:28] amen christ knows what it's like to
[51:30] grieve he can identify with our grief
[51:32] but we can't really identify
[51:35] with his
[51:36] remember because we we can't experience
[51:39] what he experienced there
[51:41] amen
[51:42] listen he for the first time like i said
[51:44] for the first time ever he's all alone
[51:46] listen you can be a crowd of people and
[51:48] be alone
[51:51] oh you're at a party and everyone's
[51:52] having a good time there's all kinds of
[51:53] people you can be alone
[51:56] listen there's plenty of onlookers there
[51:57] with christ there was thieves there was
[51:59] roman soldiers there was onlookers but
[52:01] he's
[52:02] alone in the midst of all those people
[52:05] and all those watchers he is alone for
[52:06] the first time
[52:09] truly alone amen
[52:12] we know what it's like to be alone but
[52:13] we don't know what it's like to be we
[52:15] might feel like we're that kind of alone
[52:17] but he was that kind of alone
[52:20] we can feel grief but we can't have that
[52:22] kind of grief
[52:23] amen listen we know what it's like to
[52:26] feel forsaken but he knows what it's
[52:28] like to be forsaken by god
[52:33] amen
[52:36] i had one of these weeks
[52:38] my computer stopped working i was trying
[52:39] to help my wife get the sunday school
[52:40] lesson ready my computer died i don't

[53:15] church i felt forsaken but i wasn't
[53:17] forsaken
[53:18] but he said i want you to realize what
[53:19] it's like to feel that way because
[53:20] that's how it was at calvary
[53:23] amen
[53:24] you look at the disciples and what they
[53:26] were going through amen
[53:30] they were they were having a bad week
[53:33] they felt forsaken but they hadn't been
[53:36] forsaken they felt that way but one was
[53:39] forsaken for them
[53:42] those disciples of 2000 years ago on
[53:45] that first easter they had good friday

[53:51] jobs they had given up homes they had
[53:53] given up lands they had they had
[53:55] followed jesus they had been his
[53:57] disciples and now they they see all

[56:20] you won't believe it the bible said they

[56:26] meanwhile the jews have already started
[56:27] their false report they paid some people
[56:29] hey let them know that's all i just made
[56:31] listen fake news didn't just start five
[56:33] or six years ago they had fake news back
[56:35] there at the tomb i don't know if it's
[56:36] brian stealth or what amen one of these
[56:38] fake news pundits put up oh listen they
[56:40] just took his body and buried it or
[56:42] hated her something else amen there's
[56:43] nothing happened there
[56:45] listen the rumor was already busy that
[56:47] morning
[56:48] and crush was already out of the ground
[56:50] the rumors didn't hold him down the
[56:52] roman seal didn't hold him down
[56:54] death couldn't hold him down
[56:56] he was alive he's alive today it don't
[56:59] matter what the world says it don't
[57:01] matter what you tell people to say you
[57:03] can't hold it back
[57:07] even his own disciples didn't believe it
[57:08] didn't stop anything he's still alive
[57:10] whether they believe it or not
[57:14] later that day there's a couple
[57:15] disciples and they're walking on the
[57:16] road to emmaus not knowing church was
[57:19] going to last all afternoon
[57:21] i hope you i hope you brought your
[57:22] pillow if you need something for your
[57:23] back
[57:25] yes i hope servants don't go too long
[57:26] today mess and they they heard it from
[57:28] after the end of the evening
[57:29] that's all they heard for hours
[57:31] amen listen they were walking on the
[57:33] road to emmaus and there you this this
[57:35] man comes by the way somebody starts to
[57:37] draw on there amen they didn't recognize
[57:39] the very one they were sad about
[57:41] the very one that felt forsaken about
[57:43] they didn't realize he was right there
[57:44] the whole time
[57:47] oh i wish you were here his hair if you
[57:49] can recognize that
[57:56] you know i don't know what was in the
[57:58] mind of jesus but jesus but i just have
[57:59] to
[58:00] i just have to think you know god's got
[58:01] a sense of humor
[58:03] it had to be just a little almost
[58:04] amusing
[58:05] because jesus draws an ear and he sees
[58:07] them all sad and down-hearted
[58:09] what manner of communications are these
[58:11] that you're sad
[58:13] oh well
[58:14] are you a stranger in these parts
[58:16] everybody's how do you not know me and
[58:18] this guy don't know nothing
[58:21] are you a stranger and you don't know
[58:22] the news listen this this jesus of
[58:25] nazareth he was a mighty prophet word
[58:27] indeed but our leaders they condemned
[58:29] him and they killed him and and and and
[58:32] we believed he was the salvation of
[58:34] israel and now he's dead and besides
[58:36] this we've had some women come to us
[58:38] this morning and they told us he's alive
[58:40] but we went couldn't find him we just
[58:41] know what to make out of it
[58:44] i've not heard these things jesus says
[58:47] what things
[58:48] tell me about it
[58:51] you know you go to pray sometimes like
[58:52] lord i'm just going through so much like
[58:54] he don't know
[58:56] like he doesn't know already lord you
[58:58] just don't know what i've been through
[58:59] yeah he does
[59:01] the cross proved he knows exactly what
[59:02] you're going through
[59:04] lord i've just gone through so much oh
[59:06] yeah like like what
[59:08] oh lord they forsook you oh all these
[59:10] bad things happen
[59:12] we don't even know whether he's alive
[59:13] why would he be alive they killed him
[59:17] amen oh
[59:17] slow of heart to believe all that the
[59:20] prophets have spoken ought not christ to
[59:23] have suffered these things and to enter
[59:25] into his glory
[59:28] and i love the scripture says he begins
[59:29] at moses and all the prophets and he
[59:32] preaches christ to them amen if you
[59:34] can't see jesus christ in every
[59:36] scripture in the bible go back and read
[59:38] it again
[59:39] because he starts from the very
[59:40] beginning and he goes through and said
[59:41] this was christ can i dramatize this a
[59:43] little bit i hope that's all right
[59:45] we're not worried about our time like i
[59:46] said we've got all afternoon we've got
[59:48] until evening i'm not going to keep it
[59:49] that long
[59:51] we've got till the evening when they go
[59:52] settle down amen mama dramatize us a
[59:54] little bit he began to start with moses
[59:56] and he went through the entire bible
[59:58] maybe he began to preach about the
[59:59] patriarch abraham god's covenant with
[1:00:01] abraham showing that god had made a
[1:00:03] grace covenant with abraham it was an
[1:00:05] unconditional covenant
[1:00:07] abraham didn't have anything to do with
[1:00:08] it god started it god was going to
[1:00:10] finish it god swore by himself he would
[1:00:13] give a promise to the earth the promise
[1:00:15] of abraham the holy ghost has been
[1:00:17] fulfilled through jesus christ
[1:00:20] how god was going to require a sacrifice
[1:00:24] from abraham and then god come and said
[1:00:26] i'll provide myself a lamb
[1:00:28] i provided it three days ago i'll
[1:00:31] provide for myself a sacrifice abraham
[1:00:34] you don't need to do it i'll provide one
[1:00:36] for you you just believe it
[1:00:39] probably come over and preach the
[1:00:40] prophet like unto moses shown moses
[1:00:42] deliver me preach why christ speak god's
[1:00:44] speaking through the message god's
[1:00:45] speaking through all these messages
[1:00:47] talking about how god had commissioned
[1:00:48] moses he had the authority to speak and
[1:00:50] go forward amen preach a second handed
[1:00:53] robe preach about elijah getting
[1:00:54] elijah's robe preparing him for the
[1:00:56] ministry that he given him the preaching
[1:00:58] about isaiah and the influence of
[1:01:00] another how isaiah had looked at that
[1:01:01] great king uzziah how he lifted him up
[1:01:04] as a man but one day isaiah chapter six
[1:01:06] one day after king josh died isaiah saw
[1:01:09] the real king
[1:01:10] he saw the lord high and lifted up and
[1:01:12] his train filled the temple
[1:01:15] isaiah thought that uzziah had been a
[1:01:17] great man he thought he had a great
[1:01:19] political kingdom but in the presence of
[1:01:21] god isaiah realized what was me
[1:01:25] i thought i was a great person i thought
[1:01:26] he was a great person but in the
[1:01:28] presence of that holy god he realized
[1:01:31] woe is me for i am a man of unclean lips
[1:01:34] i dwell in the midst of an unclean
[1:01:36] people but praise god there was a
[1:01:38] servant took a life call off that altar
[1:01:40] and touched his lips he said your
[1:01:43] iniquity is purged your sin is purged
[1:01:46] hallelujah
[1:01:49] hope you see where i'm going with this
[1:01:51] went through the scripture and he began
[1:01:52] to preach messages beginning to go home
[1:01:54] this was christ and that was christ
[1:01:56] joseph a perfect type of christ forsaken
[1:01:58] by his brethren but he was brought to
[1:02:00] redeem they meant it for evil but god
[1:02:03] intended it for god
[1:02:06] everything he had told him it pointed
[1:02:08] not to
[1:02:09] appointed to christ amen
[1:02:12] i believe that's what the message the
[1:02:13] hour is this to us today amen
[1:02:15] listen those men on the road to emmaus
[1:02:17] they understood and they even
[1:02:19] acknowledged everything that jesus told
[1:02:21] him in that form
[1:02:22] amen but they still didn't realize who
[1:02:24] was talking to him until the evening
[1:02:26] time
[1:02:28] amen many people walk along in this
[1:02:30] evening time they hear the message and
[1:02:32] they testify these disciples oh our
[1:02:34] hearts burned within us as they walked
[1:02:36] along the way they think that they
[1:02:38] they've got it oh i just i felt a tingle
[1:02:40] i felt great at church i had this
[1:02:41] burning in my heart
[1:02:43] but brother bram said that the baptism
[1:02:45] of holy ghost is the revelation of jesus
[1:02:47] christ to you personally
[1:02:49] what do you recognize it's christ in you
[1:02:52] the hope of glory that's the baptism of
[1:02:54] the holy ghost
[1:02:56] a lot of people hear the message they
[1:02:57] hear the bible they get excited and
[1:02:59] their hearts burn but when they got in
[1:03:02] that little room in the evening time and
[1:03:04] he began to break the bread and he
[1:03:06] blessed the bread he broke the bread to
[1:03:08] them then their eyes were opened
[1:03:11] brothers and sisters it's not enough for
[1:03:13] us just to get excited and have our
[1:03:15] hearts burn god open our eyes today
[1:03:19] if there'd be one here that doesn't see
[1:03:20] him today let him come and open your
[1:03:23] eyes
[1:03:24] they opened their eyes and they knew
[1:03:25] that was christ he's alive
[1:03:31] see until you see jesus christ
[1:03:33] personally this message is no different
[1:03:35] it's just the words of a man oh it's
[1:03:37] just a man preaching it's just somebody
[1:03:38] some preacher this and that but when
[1:03:40] your eyes are open you realize it was
[1:03:42] god speaking through a man not saith the
[1:03:43] lord
[1:03:44] listen when a prophet has got thus saith
[1:03:46] the lord like in this bible listen when
[1:03:48] he's got thus saith lord it's the same
[1:03:50] thing as god speaking
[1:03:54] it's got to be more than just a bunch of
[1:03:56] learning to us
[1:03:57] listen they understood
[1:03:59] all those things but their eyes weren't
[1:04:00] open amen there's a group of people and
[1:04:02] the bible testifies in the last days
[1:04:05] there's a group of people they're ever
[1:04:06] learning but they never come to a
[1:04:08] knowledge of the truth
[1:04:10] oh they've always got some new doctrine
[1:04:11] they're always picking up some new thing
[1:04:13] oh i've never heard it preached that way
[1:04:14] before probably because it's made up
[1:04:19] oh i had a brother one time he oh
[1:04:22] brother i've never heard anybody preach
[1:04:23] a message like this guy preached he's
[1:04:25] just so fearless and you need to go back
[1:04:27] and hear what he has i've never heard
[1:04:28] this preached before
[1:04:31] okay well let's uh let's go hear what
[1:04:32] it's about hey man i got my red flag up
[1:04:34] here
[1:04:36] now listen
[1:04:37] i'm not talking about if you just come
[1:04:38] to church you never know about somebody
[1:04:40] you study the bible and stuff and just
[1:04:41] got this wild idea nobody's ever had
[1:04:43] this before jesus because it's made up
[1:04:45] that's why you've never heard before
[1:04:48] amen well praise the lord
[1:04:50] this brother's like oh this guy
[1:04:52] you know most preachers that they've got
[1:04:54] too much fear to preach something like
[1:04:55] this guy preached i went back to the
[1:04:56] brother after i listened to his sermon i
[1:04:58] said
[1:04:59] brother i agree with you i i fear god
[1:05:01] too much to preach what that man
[1:05:02] preached
[1:05:03] i i'm not that brave i fear god
[1:05:06] brother what do you mean i'm like if i
[1:05:08] would say that i'd be i'd put my soul in
[1:05:10] hell
[1:05:11] preaching this kind of false nonsense
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:15] i'm not going to tell you what's all
[1:05:16] about but i'm just making the point amen
[1:05:18] lots of people hear things they
[1:05:19] understand things but it's when you see
[1:05:21] christ for yourself that's what makes
[1:05:23] the difference
[1:05:25] it doesn't it's not good for me to tell
[1:05:26] you he's alive if you can't see him
[1:05:28] alive for yourself
[1:05:33] if that's your attitude towards the
[1:05:34] message it'll always just be what
[1:05:35] brother branham said brother branham
[1:05:36] said brother braham said
[1:05:37] what did god say
[1:05:40] god is speaking to us amen
[1:05:42] not the man the man's not god i hope you
[1:05:44] understand him now jesus is jesus was
[1:05:47] god he is god
[1:05:49] but it's more than just a man speaking
[1:05:51] to us
[1:05:52] see a lot of people look at
[1:05:54] they look at the a man's life
[1:05:57] they say well listen this man he he has
[1:05:59] faults
[1:06:00] his failures and mistakes i'm like oh
[1:06:03] you mean like every other man that's
[1:06:04] ever lived besides jesus
[1:06:08] oh well listen this guy lied one time
[1:06:11] just once and he's doing good
[1:06:13] i mean he's not but he is
[1:06:16] hey man i mean some people they lie
[1:06:17] every time they draw breath i know a
[1:06:19] couple of them praise the lord
[1:06:21] if i want to know the truth i just take
[1:06:23] everything they say and believe the
[1:06:23] opposite i'm closer
[1:06:26] you all laughing because you know some
[1:06:28] yourself
[1:06:31] well listen well brother branham he he
[1:06:32] did this wrong and this that brother
[1:06:33] brad makes this statement i really like
[1:06:35] this this all ties into being forsaken
[1:06:37] so don't think i've left my thought but
[1:06:40] the man talks about this in his life
[1:06:42] story he's telling 1959 i believe it's
[1:06:44] at the english
[1:06:45] temple in california but he said it was
[1:06:48] given out that today i was i was to kind
[1:06:50] of talk to you for a while on my life
[1:06:52] story
[1:06:53] he said that that's a hard thing for me
[1:06:57] this would be the first time i've tried
[1:06:58] to approach it for many years and i i
[1:07:00] would not have time to go into the
[1:07:02] details but just part of it
[1:07:04] now what this is what he says
[1:07:05] he says in here i've made many mistakes
[1:07:08] i've done many things that was wrong and
[1:07:10] i'll desire that you in the radio land
[1:07:12] and you that are present you will not
[1:07:14] take my mistakes to be stumbling stones
[1:07:16] but stepping stones
[1:07:18] that bring you closer
[1:07:20] to the lord jesus
[1:07:22] see sometimes people try to take the man
[1:07:24] william branham take his life and his
[1:07:26] mistakes as a man and try to disqualify
[1:07:27] the message well the man made mistakes
[1:07:30] so did abraham
[1:07:32] abraham listen abraham made some big
[1:07:34] mistakes
[1:07:36] so did isaiah
[1:07:38] i like how the prophet says you think
[1:07:40] those proud jews with their heritage and
[1:07:42] their their their ethnic pride do you
[1:07:44] think they would write those things
[1:07:46] about themselves listen there's lots of
[1:07:47] things about your life you would never
[1:07:49] write down to tell anybody
[1:07:52] amen
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:54] abraham writing this listen even moses
[1:07:57] moses has to write down what he did
[1:07:59] wrong you think moses wanted to write
[1:08:00] down oh yeah i murdered an egyptian one
[1:08:02] day oh yeah i got mad and smoked the
[1:08:03] rock twice he didn't want to write those
[1:08:05] things he was inspired
[1:08:08] he said that man made mistakes yeah and
[1:08:09] god was greater than their mistakes
[1:08:12] that's what makes god so great
[1:08:14] nothing took a perfect man and did it
[1:08:16] then he could take us and do the same
[1:08:18] thing
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:23] it's god strong even this is what i want
[1:08:26] you to catch even in our mistakes he'll
[1:08:28] never leave us
[1:08:30] or forsake us you say why was christ
[1:08:33] forsaken so you wouldn't have to be
[1:08:36] you can have a perfect assurance and a
[1:08:38] confidence every day for the rest of
[1:08:40] your life he was forsaken so i will
[1:08:43] never have to be no matter how alone i
[1:08:45] feel no matter how many mistakes i make
[1:08:47] no matter how bad i feel no matter what
[1:08:48] i go through i will never leave you i
[1:08:52] will never forsake you
[1:08:54] christ was forsaken so you never have to
[1:08:56] be
[1:08:58] oh but look how ugly and bad you know
[1:09:00] look look at all these things and god
[1:09:02] still loved him and god still used him
[1:09:04] and god still loves you and god still
[1:09:06] uses you yeah amen
[1:09:08] amen see we look at all these mistakes
[1:09:10] in people's life
[1:09:12] say well okay god use that person and
[1:09:14] then we get our own mistakes like well
[1:09:16] well listen there's there's a perfectly
[1:09:18] valid reason for why i made a mistake oh
[1:09:19] yeah i got it right yeah
[1:09:21] rules for thee but not for me
[1:09:26] praise the lord brother bram tells this
[1:09:28] story about this little girl i love this

[1:10:09] bit of shame said i i don't know who
[1:10:11] this is i don't want to be identified
[1:10:13] with all of her ugliness
[1:10:14] she's got all this ugliness i don't want
[1:10:16] to be identified with it i want to be
[1:10:18] distinct from it and she she pretended
[1:10:20] like she didn't know who she was see
[1:10:22] look she looked at the ugly part of her
[1:10:24] mother she was a shame to be identified
[1:10:26] with that some people do that with the
[1:10:28] bible well listen this guy did this bad
[1:10:29] thing in the bible
[1:10:31] and they look at that and they say well
[1:10:33] then the bible you know these people
[1:10:34] they're not they look at the ugliness of
[1:10:36] it and they don't know the whole story
[1:10:39] they look at all the bad things
[1:10:40] associated with religion they throw out
[1:10:41] religion
[1:10:43] well listen this is not religion this is
[1:10:44] resurrection i'm talking about

[1:10:48] use that and say well let's see there's
[1:10:50] just nothing to it i know a guy one time
[1:10:52] and this is 50 years ago one time one
[1:10:55] guy i prayed for and he didn't get
[1:10:56] better well god's not a healer
[1:10:58] and they'll ignore the thousands of
[1:10:59] times that god's healed people they
[1:11:01] don't even know the whole story but they
[1:11:02] just assume
[1:11:05] they're just looking at the ugliness
[1:11:07] listen if you just look at the cross and
[1:11:09] the ugliness and the reproach of this
[1:11:11] man and you stop there there's nothing
[1:11:13] to it
[1:11:14] but you don't know the whole story
[1:11:17] and that that little girl she she denied
[1:11:19] she even knew who her mother was and
[1:11:21] that train conductor was there he said
[1:11:22] you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[1:11:24] shame on you he said you ought to be
[1:11:26] ashamed how you're treating that's your
[1:11:27] mother he said listen you don't know but
[1:11:30] i know the whole story
[1:11:33] you don't remember because you were only
[1:11:34] six months old when it happened you were
[1:11:36] upstairs one day in the house when you
[1:11:38] were just six months old a little baby
[1:11:40] in the crib and you were upstairs
[1:11:41] sleeping and mama was outside
[1:11:44] she was hanging the laundry on the line
[1:11:45] hanging out on the line outside he said
[1:11:47] she's she was a beautiful the most
[1:11:49] beautiful woman i've ever met far more
[1:11:51] beautiful than you are sweetie
[1:11:55] i threw the sweetie in there
[1:11:58] she's way more beautiful than you are
[1:12:00] she was far more beautiful but she was
[1:12:02] outside one day hanging the laundry or
[1:12:04] you were just asleep a little baby and a
[1:12:05] fire started in the house and the wind
[1:12:07] kicked up and the house just burst into
[1:12:09] flames and all the neighbors come out
[1:12:10] and said something mama couldn't stand
[1:12:12] it she said i got to go in there and
[1:12:14] save my baby and she grabbed a wet a wet
[1:12:17] sheet from the line listen to neighbors
[1:12:18] and these people that tried to stop her
[1:12:20] from getting out you can't go up there
[1:12:23] i think of jesus on disciples you can't
[1:12:24] go to jerusalem you can't do this no i
[1:12:27] gotta go you can't stop me i gotta go
[1:12:30] there's a reason to go
[1:12:31] mama said i don't care she fought her
[1:12:33] way loose took that wet sheet and
[1:12:35] covered herself ran into that burning
[1:12:37] house ran upstairs got to her little
[1:12:40] baby and then she realized
[1:12:43] i got to get this baby out of here but
[1:12:45] i've only got one sheet to do it with so
[1:12:47] she took that sheet that had protected
[1:12:49] her all that time she took that sheet
[1:12:51] she wrapped that baby in that and she
[1:12:53] ran down the stairs and she fought
[1:12:54] through flames and fire and smoke and it
[1:12:57] bitter and it torched her body and the
[1:12:59] flames consumed her skin her cheek sunk
[1:13:01] in and the skin on her flesh melted down
[1:13:04] the bone just figured it for the rest of
[1:13:05] her life almost killed her to save her
[1:13:07] little baby
[1:13:09] and there's that same little baby all
[1:13:10] grown up and she's ashamed of mommy
[1:13:13] but you don't realize
[1:13:16] that man said she became ugly so you
[1:13:18] could be beautiful
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:22] she was ugly so you could be beautiful
[1:13:25] she forfeited everything she had that
[1:13:27] you could live
[1:13:28] brother said that's what christ did for
[1:13:30] us
[1:13:31] he left glory
[1:13:32] he left power he left heaven to be
[1:13:35] wrapped in a swaddling cloth lay on a
[1:13:37] pile of manure be tempted as we are
[1:13:39] afflicted be hungry
[1:13:41] be tired be alone
[1:13:44] be rejected
[1:13:46] he chose to do that he became ugly so we
[1:13:50] could be beautiful
[1:13:52] listen he didn't have to come that way
[1:13:56] the bible says in isaiah 53 he is
[1:13:58] despised this is messiah now
[1:14:02] oh brother people mistreat me and stuff
[1:14:04] listen he was despised
[1:14:07] and rejected of men
[1:14:09] a man of sorrows
[1:14:12] oh man this hitting much of a shot in
[1:14:13] service i guess
[1:14:16] oh he's just always down trout he's
[1:14:17] always all sad listen he had a reason to
[1:14:19] be his man of sorrows hey man look what
[1:14:21] they put him through
[1:14:23] we act like we've got it rough
[1:14:25] and we do have it rough
[1:14:27] but he really had it rough
[1:14:30] a man of sorrows
[1:14:32] this is this is christ
[1:14:36] acquainted
[1:14:37] it was it was not an unfamiliar visitor
[1:14:39] to him acquainted with grief
[1:14:42] and we
[1:14:44] hid as it were our faces
[1:14:46] from him
[1:14:48] like that girl
[1:14:50] he was despised
[1:14:53] we esteemed him not
[1:14:56] surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:14:59] and carried our sorrows
[1:15:01] now you know why he was that way he bore
[1:15:03] your griefs
[1:15:05] he carried your sorrows
[1:15:07] and actually if you look in the hebrew
[1:15:08] he's actually talking about your your
[1:15:09] pains in your infirmities he's talking
[1:15:11] about divine healing
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:13] not not just metaphysically he really
[1:15:16] did
[1:15:17] bear your
[1:15:18] it's the children's bread amen if you're
[1:15:19] sick today
[1:15:20] easter says you can be healed
[1:15:22] so how do i know if he approves whether
[1:15:24] i'll be healed or not easter approved it
[1:15:25] he approved his plan of salvation that
[1:15:28] day at calvary and he he verified on
[1:15:31] that resurrection
[1:15:32] amen what is divine healing it's the
[1:15:34] earnest of our inheritance it's the
[1:15:36] earnest of the resurrection amen amen
[1:15:41] he carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:15:45] him in other words we decided we thought
[1:15:47] of him as stricken
[1:15:49] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[1:15:52] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:15:54] bruised for our somebody say our with me
[1:15:57] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[1:16:00] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:16:03] we are healed
[1:16:07] with his strength this is everything
[1:16:08] christ did he did it for you
[1:16:11] he did not one thing for himself
[1:16:14] that's why a prophet can say eternal
[1:16:16] life is living for others he for us he
[1:16:19] for our everything he did was for you
[1:16:22] why would you be ashamed of that all but
[1:16:24] look how look look at how ugly it looks
[1:16:26] look how disfigured look at how humble
[1:16:28] and petty it looks look at how great it
[1:16:31] is
[1:16:32] he did it for you
[1:16:35] he did it for me
[1:16:36] he was forsaken
[1:16:38] like no man's ever ever could be
[1:16:41] forsaken
[1:16:42] for you and i
[1:16:47] brother brown says the spirit left this
[1:16:49] is rising of the sun 65. the spirit left
[1:16:51] him in the garden against somebody he
[1:16:52] had to die a man remember friends he
[1:16:55] didn't have to do that
[1:16:57] he had a choice in it
[1:16:59] but he submitted his choice
[1:17:01] he didn't have to do that that was god
[1:17:03] god anointed that flesh which is human
[1:17:05] flesh and he didn't if he went up
[1:17:07] there's god he had never died that kind
[1:17:09] of death can't kill god but he didn't he
[1:17:11] didn't have to do that but remember he
[1:17:13] went there with you in him
[1:17:17] see god had never separated the bride
[1:17:19] from the groom yet so when god looked
[1:17:20] down upon the body of christ he saw both
[1:17:23] male and female it was all redeemed in
[1:17:25] that one body they
[1:17:27] are
[1:17:28] one
[1:17:30] i tell you if that don't light your fire
[1:17:32] you would might be wet
[1:17:34] amen you say how we're gonna be one you
[1:17:36] were one back there
[1:17:38] you died with him you were banged with
[1:17:40] him but praise god you rose with him on
[1:17:43] the third day you didn't just raise up
[1:17:46] you have ascended with him into heavenly
[1:17:48] places you were sit down with him
[1:17:52] he has managed to sit down with him who
[1:17:54] is the head of all principality and
[1:17:57] power
[1:17:58] you were dead in sins and trespasses yet
[1:18:01] you has he quickened he has made you
[1:18:04] alive he's made you just sit in heavenly
[1:18:06] places together
[1:18:08] in christ jesus
[1:18:10] there's your resurrection today there's
[1:18:12] your easter today you're already risen
[1:18:14] amen oh hallelujah praise god somebody
[1:18:17] listen you didn't just get saved 10
[1:18:19] years ago or 20 years ago or on a
[1:18:21] certain day you were saved 2 000 years
[1:18:23] ago when christ rose again
[1:18:26] you just recognized one day your eyes
[1:18:29] were open and you saw he was forsaken so
[1:18:32] that god would never leave me amen
[1:18:38] you'd never have to be
[1:18:40] those disciples were so discouraged
[1:18:42] that's when he appeared
[1:18:45] maybe you feel a little dejected today
[1:18:46] maybe you had a week-long guy did you
[1:18:48] say oh praise you know does god even
[1:18:50] love me why do i why do i even try
[1:18:52] sometimes well it had nothing to do with
[1:18:54] your effort in the first place now did
[1:18:55] it now
[1:18:56] you didn't start this
[1:18:57] why are you trying to finish it
[1:19:00] you act like you got all this all you
[1:19:01] have to do is present yourself a living
[1:19:03] sacrifice give it to god
[1:19:06] he paid for it he made a way for you to
[1:19:08] be free
[1:19:14] he appears to his disciples what's he
[1:19:16] say lo
[1:19:17] i am with you always
[1:19:21] no matter where you go don't ever fear
[1:19:23] to go anywhere or do anything the
[1:19:25] unfailing presence of the lord jesus
[1:19:27] christ is with you always as i was with
[1:19:30] moses so shall i be with you amen
[1:19:35] david said will my father and my mother
[1:19:37] forsake me god will take me up
[1:19:41] amen he said his goodness his mercy they
[1:19:44] followed me
[1:19:45] you didn't chase it down they even
[1:19:47] followed you all the days of your life
[1:19:53] i think of the prophet isaiah
[1:19:56] god said sing o heavens and be joyful o
[1:19:58] earth and break forth into singing o
[1:20:00] mountains for the lord hath comforted
[1:20:02] his people aren't you glad he's
[1:20:04] comforted us today he has comforted his
[1:20:06] people he'll have mercy upon the
[1:20:08] afflicted
[1:20:09] but zion said the lord hath forsaken me
[1:20:15] he's like i'm going to comfort you guys
[1:20:16] oh god's forsaking me he's not anywhere
[1:20:17] nearby
[1:20:19] did you just hear what i said he said
[1:20:21] i said i've not forgotten you i'm not
[1:20:23] forsaking you zion says oh the lord has
[1:20:25] forsaken me and my god has forgotten me
[1:20:28] he asked the question can a woman forget
[1:20:30] her sucking child that she should not
[1:20:32] have compassion on the son of a womb
[1:20:35] i used to think that was impossible but
[1:20:37] this world's taught me it's not
[1:20:39] it astounds me i was a little boy when i
[1:20:41] found out
[1:20:42] hey man they found some little baby in a
[1:20:44] dumpster somewhere mommy just tossed the
[1:20:46] baby in the dumpster
[1:20:47] he asked the question can a sucking mom
[1:20:50] forget her child he says they may forget
[1:20:52] but i will not forgive me
[1:20:55] even if mommy can't for if she can't
[1:20:57] keep with you if she forsakes you god
[1:21:00] still won't forget you
[1:21:02] he's the friend that sticks closer than
[1:21:03] a brother
[1:21:07] i will not forget thee behold
[1:21:10] i have graven me
[1:21:12] on the palms of my hands
[1:21:16] amen that's the true meaning of easter
[1:21:18] he's with us
[1:21:19] until the end of the world he promised
[1:21:21] he'd never leave us
[1:21:23] or forsake us he's not just not going to
[1:21:26] leave us in other words he's not just
[1:21:27] going to not be absent it sounds like a
[1:21:29] double negative it's not just that he's
[1:21:31] here he's here and he values you
[1:21:34] he's not going to give you up for
[1:21:36] something better he gave up everything
[1:21:38] to get you
[1:21:40] he'll not forsake you he doesn't look at
[1:21:43] you one day and say i found something
[1:21:44] better he's not looking for a new wife
[1:21:47] he's not look he's not going through a
[1:21:48] midlife crisis he's not looking to
[1:21:50] upgrade he likes his little bride just
[1:21:52] the way he always has
[1:21:54] she's the apple of his eye that's that's
[1:21:56] the very thunder of his heart i'll never
[1:21:59] leave you i'll never forsake you
[1:22:02] i don't want to break into 80s music
[1:22:03] here because that would be unbecoming of
[1:22:05] a minister but let's just stand our feet
[1:22:06] amen

[1:22:09] never gonna
[1:22:10] you know i was gonna touch help me jesus

[1:22:22] first
[1:22:24] he don't say that you know i thought
[1:22:25] about that but for years i used to feel
[1:22:27] bad about that like man i don't love god
[1:22:30] because he loved me first and one day
[1:22:31] the lord's like
[1:22:32] well yeah how are you gonna let me first

[1:22:44] what what a wonderful love affair we
[1:22:46] have with the lord jesus christ amen

[1:26:22] like there was when you gave up the
[1:26:23] ghost and the graves are open so shall
[1:26:25] be again lord i believe our loved ones i
[1:26:27] believe those that have gone on before
[1:26:29] us
[1:26:29] i believe we'll meet them in the air
[1:26:32] and so shall we ever be with you
[1:26:35] wherever you go we'll be there wherever
[1:26:38] we go now you're there
[1:26:40] lord i think of david he said lo i made
[1:26:42] my bed in hell but you were there
[1:26:45] lord at the lowest point of my life
[1:26:48] lord when i had nothing left to live for
[1:26:50] no desire when i cursed the very dead i
[1:26:52] was born
[1:26:54] lord you were there
[1:26:55] you weren't just looking over my
[1:26:57] shoulder or watching from afar off
[1:26:59] you were right there
[1:27:01] you're alive i know you're alive you're
[1:27:04] alive at me
[1:27:06] i should be dead today but there's been
[1:27:07] a a transformation
[1:27:11] by the holy ghost
[1:27:13] lord that's not just my testimony i
[1:27:14] believe there's many here just like it's
[1:27:17] the same jesus christ
[1:27:20] that met them in the garden the same
[1:27:21] jesus christ that talked with them along
[1:27:23] the way you're the same today
[1:27:25] and you do the same things bless these
[1:27:27] people we pray we commit them into your
[1:27:29] hands
