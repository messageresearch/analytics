[32:38] when we're in sync with god
[32:40] verse 17 so then faith
[32:43] cometh by hearing
[32:45] and hearing
[32:46] by the word of god
[32:48] amen that's a good
[32:51] good word amen and then ii timothy
[32:53] chapter four
[32:56] the first four verses there i charge
[32:58] thee therefore
[32:59] before god and the lord jesus christ
[33:03] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[33:05] that is appearing in his kingdom
[33:08] as our captain
[33:10] is telling us to charge
[33:13] and he says
[33:14] go preach the word
[33:17] and be instant in season in out of
[33:20] season in other words be in sync with
[33:22] god
[33:24] reprove rebuke exhort
[33:27] a lot of strong words there with all
[33:30] long suffering and doctrine
[33:33] for the time will come when they will
[33:35] not
[33:35] endure
[33:37] sound doctrine
[33:39] but after their own lusts shall the heat
[33:41] for themselves teachers have an itching
[33:43] ears and they shall turn away their ears
[33:46] from the truth
[33:48] and shall be turned onto fables
[33:50] god bless his word you may be seated
[33:53] before we get into this message today um
[33:58] we have a number of videos coming in
[34:00] from overseas and information and
[34:03] they're just piling up and i'll be
[34:04] honest with you there are some that we
[34:07] have just
[34:09] they've gone by
[34:10] we haven't been able to show them
[34:12] there's just
[34:13] and i i i keep thinking i'm going to do
[34:15] a service just on missions i'm going to
[34:17] show them all from the different
[34:18] countries and for
[34:20] one reason or another it just it doesn't
[34:23] get done so we're we're just going to
[34:26] show them
[34:27] as many as we can as often as we can
[34:31] so we don't miss as many and this one is
[34:33] first from uh
[34:36] honduras
[34:37] the mesquite area and uh we haven't uh
[34:40] we just looked at it one one time
[34:42] there's some repeat uh pictures there
[34:45] it's hard to understand her sister if
[34:47] she's talking she's spanish but she's
[34:49] talking in english
[34:50] but i want you to just focus on the
[34:53] faces
[34:55] these are people that have it much
[34:58] worse than we do in life
[35:01] and um these are people that if you've
[35:03] been supporting the missions these are
[35:05] people that uh you're supporting the
[35:08] work of reaching out to saving souls in
[35:11] the mesquite area is very hard to get to
[35:13] it takes
[35:14] about eight hours
[35:16] by boat
[35:17] to get there
[35:19] uh and it's not an enjoyable ride so
[35:23] um i just want to put faces to your your
[35:26] prayers and

[35:29] what you the church is doing
[35:33] for the kingdom of god amen

[36:10] missionary activity in the mosquito of
[36:13] honduras broker from san francisco felix
[36:16] brother jose francisco palette was a
[36:18] missionary evangelist from the village
[36:20] of our plan kazuri in the department of
[36:22] europe eliza has been supporting the
[36:25] ministry of our brother who together
[36:28] with his wife and other brothers who
[36:30] accompany him has been assisting the
[36:32] missionary work in la mosquitia in
[36:34] honduras and nicaragua after the trips
[36:37] that were made to this area in 2002 with
[36:41] our brothers gary maldonado mia rubio

[37:12] [Music]
[37:15] the gospel has increased in different
[37:17] parts of the mosquito
[37:19] among which some places that already
[37:21] have established churches such as puerto
[37:24] rico which is being attempted before the
[37:27] rafa's that house
[37:28] to perron which is being cared for the
[37:31] brother carmen ramirez
[37:33] gosling a church with several members
[37:36] but no brother in church yet
[37:40] [Music]
[38:17] [Music]
[38:27] [Music]
[38:36] missionary activity in this area is
[38:38] quite complicated due to access to it
[38:41] since there are no words that connect
[38:43] with this part of the country
[38:46] and for that reason when our brothers
[38:48] travel to the area to be able to move
[38:51] sometimes they do it on foot other times
[38:54] on horseback other times by both through
[38:58] the patucka river in the karaska lagoon
[39:02] or by pick-up where possible
[39:04] and sometimes by plane where the price
[39:07] of ticket is quite on yours
[39:18] [Music]
[39:31] [Music]
[39:33] the churches in the places that used to
[39:36] be great and that were already
[39:38] established are like a collection center
[39:42] where the brothers arrive that goes to
[39:44] spread to different communities such as
[39:46] stikiraya sexiwa juanpu serpi aguas
[39:50] bruce laguna zigzagtara and barapa to
[39:53] command others
[39:57] [Music]
[40:15] brother rafael black house does his work
[40:18] as interpreter for our brothers
[40:21] since he is a native of that area in the
[40:24] end in some places they do not speak
[40:27] spanish
[40:29] [Music]
[40:58] we're infinitely grateful to our brother
[41:01] john king martin and sandal and our rich
[41:04] ministry in vettel michigan usaid
[41:07] because without his support this would
[41:10] not be possible god bless you originally
[41:19] [Music]
[41:38] we beg your prayers so that our brothers
[41:40] can continue preaching the gospel in
[41:43] this community that need needed so much
[41:46] and still be able to fulfill what the
[41:48] great teacher told to us
[41:50] go over the wall and preach the gospel
[41:53] to every creature god bless you
[41:58] [Music]
[42:17] [Music]
[42:33] i have a vision over there to reach out
[42:36] for souls and
[42:38] one soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[42:40] and you can't do enough to see one soul
[42:43] saved
[42:44] and the believe the scripture tells us
[42:47] that without a vision
[42:49] the people will perish
[42:51] and so that's something that we want to
[42:53] cultivate
[42:54] um and and know that the mission field
[42:57] is is outside these doors
[43:00] it's the whole world and god can use
[43:02] each and every one of us
[43:04] to help
[43:05] uh
[43:06] to help bring them to christ now i'm
[43:09] going to be honest with you the world is
[43:10] lost
[43:12] and this is the only book
[43:14] that can tell us who we are who they are
[43:18] where they came from
[43:20] and where they're going
[43:22] it's the only book that can do that and
[43:24] god has placed the truth in our hearts
[43:27] and what uh an opportunity
[43:30] we have
[43:31] uh to
[43:33] to help spread the gospel overseas and
[43:36] locally um
[43:38] i will say they they put a lot of time
[43:40] into that and i know it wasn't clear and
[43:43] it wasn't exact and there's some double
[43:45] pictures and things like that but i
[43:48] thank the lord that they wanted to share
[43:49] with us to give us some sort of idea of
[43:53] the work that they're doing and the
[43:54] families that are going down there may
[43:56] god continue uh to bless them
[43:59] amen well as i made mention i want to
[44:02] entitle this message being in sync with
[44:05] god
[44:06] we can't be in sync with god
[44:09] unless we have faith
[44:11] in what god is speaking
[44:13] hebrews 11 verse 6 says but without
[44:16] faith it's impossible to please him
[44:18] for he that cometh to god must first
[44:20] believe that he is and he's a rewarder
[44:22] of them that diligently seek him now
[44:24] this may sound like there's two
[44:26] different subjects but it's really one
[44:28] subject and it's called faith and i want
[44:30] to read it just a little bit different
[44:32] to kind of bring it home to us here in
[44:34] the church and those that would be live
[44:36] streaming
[44:37] but without faith it's impossible to
[44:39] please him for he that cometh to church
[44:42] must first believe that
[44:44] he is the word being preached
[44:48] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[44:50] call upon him
[44:54] in other words we have more to do than
[44:55] just be at church
[44:57] we've got to believe that god is here
[44:59] that god the word is really speaking and
[45:03] it's not a man speaking
[45:05] and that we have a responsibility that
[45:07] when he speaks that we're to call upon
[45:09] him
[45:12] i'm not in sync with god just because
[45:14] i'm a child of god
[45:16] i must have faith
[45:18] and another thing i need
[45:20] is i need to be in sync with god by
[45:23] being in the spirit
[45:25] i have to be in the spirit if i don't
[45:28] walk in the spirit the bible says that i
[45:29] will literally fulfill the desires of my
[45:32] flesh
[45:34] and that i'll i'll bite and devour
[45:37] others
[45:38] just like the devil the devil is seeking
[45:40] whom he may devour that's what happens
[45:43] to us when we're in the flesh we take on
[45:45] the nature of satan
[45:48] john 4 24 says god is a spirit and they
[45:52] that worship him must worship him in the
[45:55] spirit and in truth in spirit and in
[45:57] truth so we just can't worship god in
[45:59] the old way we want you and say god take
[46:00] it or leave it
[46:02] we've got to get out of our flesh and
[46:04] get into the spirit if god is going to
[46:06] receive our worship
[46:08] so being in sync with god is not
[46:11] something that god owes us
[46:14] like like you owe it to me to get me in
[46:17] this to get me in sync with you god
[46:19] don't know us a thing that's right amen
[46:21] god still expects us today to deny
[46:24] ourself
[46:25] to pick up his will that's the cross
[46:29] to pick up his will because his will is
[46:32] usually suffering
[46:34] i got some some quotes here that i
[46:37] wanted to read from
[46:39] the the church age book and last
[46:42] wednesday our brother jonathan we were
[46:44] in the men's meeting and he said
[46:48] brother john you know what we need is
[46:50] we need this quote
[46:53] hanging up in the church and i'm going
[46:55] to read this quote to you it's right
[46:57] here
[46:58] may god begin by his spirit to give us
[47:01] continuous life-giving and prevailing
[47:04] revelation so i just cut that out of the
[47:06] message and i wanted to hang that up
[47:09] here because there's so much into this
[47:11] statement
[47:13] and brother branham he said this he said
[47:16] that faith is a revelation
[47:19] so therefore we can conclude that
[47:21] revelation has
[47:22] substance because faith has substance
[47:26] it's
[47:26] it's it it hope is missing
[47:29] a substance that faith has
[47:32] so revelation isn't just knowledge of
[47:34] the truth
[47:36] it has a substance
[47:38] and that substance brings life to the
[47:41] person that the revelation comes for
[47:43] brother branham also said that
[47:44] revelation is the most important thing
[47:48] that we can pray for
[47:49] so i just want to read this on page 28
[47:53] he says
[47:55] now the true revelation is god
[47:57] interpreting his own word by vindicating
[48:01] what is promise
[48:03] the true revelation of god
[48:05] is the true revelation is god
[48:08] interpreting his own word now remember
[48:10] that
[48:12] man can't give revelation we're all here
[48:15] today
[48:16] god is building his church on revelation
[48:19] and man can't give it to one another
[48:21] you
[48:22] are totally depending on the lord
[48:26] so you come into church and you're
[48:28] depending on the lord not for man to
[48:30] help you
[48:32] but for god to help you
[48:34] now don't let anyone be misled by what
[48:36] i've said
[48:37] and think that i do not believe in the
[48:39] accuracy of the word as we now have it i
[48:41] believe this bible is accurate jesus
[48:44] completely authenticated the old
[48:46] testament when he was here on earth and
[48:48] it was compiled exactly as was the our
[48:51] new testament make no mistakes about it
[48:53] we have the infallible word of god today
[48:56] and no man dares take away from it or
[48:58] add to it but we need the same spirit
[49:01] that gave it to teach us
[49:06] so coming to church and totally
[49:08] depending on our understanding and the
[49:10] ability for the human being that's
[49:12] behind this pulpit to bring across to
[49:15] you the revelation
[49:17] will come
[49:18] utterly short of what is needed it takes
[49:21] god through the power of the holy spirit
[49:24] to reveal true to you
[49:28] oh how we need
[49:30] revelation by the spirit
[49:33] we don't need a new bible
[49:35] we don't need a new translation though
[49:37] some are very good and i'm not against
[49:39] them but
[49:40] but we need the revelation of the spirit
[49:43] amen
[49:45] and thank god we have it have what we
[49:47] need for god
[49:49] wants to reveal his word to us by his
[49:52] holy spirit amen
[49:54] and he goes on to say this
[49:57] may god begin by his spirit
[50:00] to give us continuous life-giving and
[50:02] prevailing revelation may god begin and
[50:06] how is he going to do it by the preacher
[50:09] by his spirit you've got to be in sync
[50:14] with the holy ghost
[50:16] if you're looking for
[50:18] a continuous life-giving and the
[50:22] revelation that helps you to prevail
[50:25] over the trials in your life and the
[50:26] things that you're going through you
[50:28] need
[50:29] god to give you a revelation
[50:32] and i'll tell you we can't depend on
[50:35] church to have it we need it like 24 7
[50:37] the things that we're going through we
[50:39] need god in the scene in our home god in
[50:41] this team in our workplace god in the
[50:43] scene in every situation that's right
[50:46] amen oh if the church could only get a
[50:49] fresh revelation
[50:51] and become by it
[50:53] the living word
[50:55] manifested
[50:59] god
[51:00] god doesn't always
[51:02] want us
[51:03] to speak and have a mountain moved
[51:09] he made the children of israel go
[51:11] through the fire
[51:13] he made daniel go through the lion's den
[51:16] he made job go through what he went we
[51:18] heard that last service
[51:22] sometimes
[51:23] we need to be so full of the holy ghost
[51:26] that we could just go through
[51:29] i'm going through i'm going through
[51:32] we got to manifest the word
[51:34] all right he says let me read that again
[51:35] oh if the church could only get a fresh
[51:37] revelation and become by it the living
[51:39] word manifested we would do the greater
[51:42] works and glorify god our father which
[51:44] is in heaven so god is looking for us
[51:48] to do greater works
[51:51] he that believeth on me the works i do
[51:53] shall he do also god is looking for us
[51:56] to believe to the point that god has
[51:58] manifested in her life
[52:02] romans chapter 10 uh verse verse 11. and
[52:06] i know we read the verse 17 but i want
[52:08] to just kind of go through a few of
[52:10] these scriptures here and i want to
[52:12] start with verse number 11 for the
[52:14] scripture saith whosoever believeth on
[52:17] him shall not be ashamed
[52:21] amen i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[52:25] jesus christ
[52:26] for there is no difference between
[52:29] the circumcision the uncircumcision the
[52:32] jew and the greek
[52:33] for the same lord over all now notice is
[52:37] rich unto all that call upon him
[52:41] now we're this whole thing is going to
[52:43] be about faith but what we're going to
[52:46] see is that we have a part to play and i
[52:48] think if we don't play this part god's
[52:51] not going to move like we want him to
[52:52] move
[52:54] it starts out talking about believing
[52:56] not being in shame and then he says that
[52:59] he is rich to all them what that believe
[53:01] no to them that call upon him
[53:05] we got a call upon the lord we can't
[53:08] just sit in church and expect the
[53:10] revelation to come
[53:11] we got to call upon him we gotta we
[53:13] gotta we gotta express i want you lord
[53:17] yes amen
[53:19] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[53:22] of the lord shall be saved
[53:24] and then he says in verse fourteen
[53:26] how then shall they call
[53:28] how shall they call on him who they have
[53:32] not believe
[53:35] i want you to think now i understand
[53:36] we're all sitting here as believers
[53:37] today but
[53:40] when we come into the church there are
[53:43] certain things in our life that we just
[53:45] don't believe and the fact of that is is
[53:47] shown in what has transpired in the week
[53:49] before
[53:51] and so
[53:52] now we come to church
[53:55] and we need to hear the truth
[53:58] but how are we going to hear the truth
[54:01] if we haven't believed it
[54:03] if it wasn't for the grace of god and
[54:05] the word comes to correct us
[54:08] okay and then how shall they believe in
[54:10] him of whom they've not heard and how
[54:12] shall they hear without a preacher
[54:15] someone's got to bring the truth and
[54:17] then look he says right how shall they
[54:19] preach
[54:20] except they be sent
[54:22] so not all preachers are sent
[54:25] everybody preaches
[54:28] everybody preaches we preach to one
[54:30] another
[54:32] it may not be behind a piece of wood in
[54:34] front of people but we preach
[54:38] but we need to be sent
[54:41] in other words when we're speaking to
[54:43] one another the word of god we need to
[54:45] have the spirit of god with us
[54:48] and we need to be sent by god
[54:50] as it is written how beautiful are the
[54:51] feet of them that
[54:53] peace uh preach the gospel peace and
[54:55] bring glad tidings of good things
[54:59] now that's a message all on its own but
[55:02] it sounds like that's a flowery
[55:03] wonderful sermon doesn't it but it's
[55:07] it's not what you think it is
[55:09] because look at verse 16 but they have
[55:11] not all all obeyed the gospel
[55:16] i mean what do you got to obey if if
[55:18] it's just a gospel of peace and good
[55:20] tidings
[55:21] you understand
[55:24] it says but how
[55:27] but they have not all obeyed
[55:29] the call
[55:31] the call the word that is that has gone
[55:34] out for isaiah's saith lord who have
[55:37] believed our report
[55:40] who's believed it it's been preached
[55:43] but who believes it
[55:46] so then faith comes by hearing
[55:49] and hearing
[55:51] by the word of god
[55:55] faith comes
[55:57] by hearing
[55:59] and the correct hearing
[56:02] is when
[56:03] god speaks
[56:05] when god speaks by his spirit
[56:09] not when man speaks the word
[56:12] not when we read the bible
[56:14] not even when we listen to tapes
[56:18] we've got to hear god speaking to us by
[56:21] his spirit through the reading through
[56:23] the preaching through the tapes
[56:25] we've got to be in sync with god
[56:28] there were 12 spies that heard the
[56:32] message from god
[56:35] and they actually went out
[56:37] and they
[56:39] saw the truth of the report that it was
[56:42] a land that flowed with milk and honey
[56:45] they all said that
[56:48] not just two of them they all said that
[56:50] it was a true report
[56:54] god never did say our only problem is
[56:56] going to be with those giants
[56:59] he never even brought it up
[57:02] that was something that was concocted
[57:04] through reasoning human reasoning and
[57:06] their eyesight
[57:08] that their problem was too big for them
[57:12] there was something
[57:14] something there
[57:16] in ten of those spies that couldn't stay
[57:19] just with the word they got off the word
[57:22] they got off the report they didn't
[57:24] believe the report
[57:28] it was you know what it was happened
[57:30] that reasoning when it took place it
[57:32] happened during the unveiling
[57:35] of the word
[57:37] the unveiling of the promise when they
[57:39] went and spied out the promise
[57:42] that is when reasoning got in
[57:45] it's us sitting in church and hearing
[57:47] the word that reasoning gets involved
[57:59] i'll tell you we when we're sitting here
[58:01] and we're
[58:03] looking at the promise of god's word
[58:06] god's word says you can have joy
[58:08] you you can have joy you just got to
[58:10] keep my commandments
[58:13] you got to have peace but you got to
[58:14] keep your mind stayed on me
[58:17] you you when we're looking into the
[58:19] promises
[58:22] it's then that we begin
[58:24] to reason well you don't know my
[58:26] situation you don't know what i'm going
[58:29] through you don't know how hard you
[58:31] haven't been in my shoes
[58:35] like the giants of your nature are so
[58:37] great
[58:39] that you're scared
[58:42] you're scared to stand up like joshua
[58:44] and caleb
[58:46] and say god gave me peace god gave me
[58:49] joy god gave me love god gave me this
[58:53] the promises are to the believer
[58:56] but you've got to believe it
[58:59] if you can't feel it in
[59:01] and we're here depending on god's spirit
[59:04] to reveal it to us
[59:07] now the difference between the two
[59:09] reports that came back the ten spies
[59:14] they heard from moses the same thing
[59:17] that joshua and caleb did
[59:19] but the ten spies heard it only from
[59:22] moses
[59:23] where joshua and caleb heard by the
[59:26] spirit
[59:28] the bible says they were of another
[59:30] spirit
[59:32] so we could be sitting in church and not
[59:34] being in sync with god
[59:37] we could one some of us could be
[59:39] listening to a man and some of us could
[59:40] be listening from listening and hearing
[59:42] god
[59:45] so then faith cometh by hearing from god
[59:50] personally
[59:52] not hearing brother john preach the word
[59:54] not over and over and over and over that
[59:57] doesn't bring faith
[59:59] faith comes from god which means if
[1:00:02] we're not getting what we want from god
[1:00:03] let's call on god let's call on them
[1:00:05] more who are to say that we've done
[1:00:08] enough
[1:00:09] if you want more get desperate
[1:00:14] good enough to hear the truth of god
[1:00:16] personally from a man
[1:00:20] you must hear it directly from god i'm
[1:00:22] just saying we're just vessels
[1:00:25] if god don't go before you when you go
[1:00:27] to witness to somebody it's just you
[1:00:31] that's why
[1:00:33] jesus told him stay in jerusalem until
[1:00:35] you get in due with power from on high
[1:00:37] and you shall be witnesses after the
[1:00:38] holy ghost has come otherwise you're
[1:00:41] just witnessing
[1:00:43] we got to have god witnessing amen amen
[1:00:47] brother or
[1:00:49] in in matthew chapter 16 verse 17 if you
[1:00:52] turn there with me
[1:00:54] jesus here he testified to peter
[1:00:56] personal his personal revelation he said
[1:00:59] blessed art thou simon bar jonah for
[1:01:02] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[1:01:06] or it hasn't
[1:01:08] it didn't take the cover off of it
[1:01:10] it didn't it it didn't make known
[1:01:14] unto thee it wasn't somebody standing
[1:01:16] behind a pulpit that told you
[1:01:19] but my father which is in heaven
[1:01:22] he's the one that revealed it
[1:01:24] and upon this act of revealing of this
[1:01:28] revealing
[1:01:29] uh from god himself to us as individuals
[1:01:32] i will build my church upon that
[1:01:36] and the gates of hell should not prevail
[1:01:38] against it
[1:01:39] that's why we could come to church hear
[1:01:40] the words say amen but never receive
[1:01:44] faith in it and get blown off
[1:01:47] but when you receive a revelation if the
[1:01:50] gates of hell cannot prevail against it
[1:01:52] then you tell me how you're going to
[1:01:53] backslide from it
[1:01:58] satan if he could he would destroy every
[1:02:00] one of us he wanted us to destroy job
[1:02:03] but he can't
[1:02:08] if the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:02:09] against the revelation what do we got to
[1:02:11] worry about
[1:02:13] we need to stand there on what god has
[1:02:15] spoken and if we feel that
[1:02:18] that we don't have that kind that we
[1:02:20] need to call on god for revelation
[1:02:22] that's all there is to it there is no
[1:02:24] other way
[1:02:25] no other person can give us
[1:02:27] can give us faith
[1:02:29] we're not going to receive it from a
[1:02:31] different preacher we're not going to
[1:02:32] receive it from a different church
[1:02:36] revelation comes from god
[1:02:39] so then faith cometh by hearing
[1:02:42] from god
[1:02:44] so in this
[1:02:45] context that we're speaking of today
[1:02:49] i'll say it like this through a preacher
[1:02:53] because we read how can they how can
[1:02:55] they hear
[1:02:56] unless
[1:02:59] they have a preacher who is sent by god
[1:03:02] so this faith that we're talking about i
[1:03:05] want to just bring it here to church
[1:03:10] how are we going to have faith
[1:03:13] if we don't receive
[1:03:15] god's word
[1:03:17] through the preaching of the word
[1:03:20] we've got to get beyond this this is
[1:03:22] just a man up here trying to tell us the
[1:03:25] best he can on how to live right
[1:03:30] god is in his word
[1:03:34] he's so much in his word a lot of times
[1:03:37] preachers don't even know it
[1:03:40] but god knows he knows what he's doing
[1:03:47] god
[1:03:48] is in control
[1:03:51] his word will get through the preachers
[1:03:54] and it will land into the heart that's
[1:03:56] prepared
[1:03:58] and if it's not prepared it's not going
[1:04:00] to bring forth fruit
[1:04:03] the word falls on all types of ground
[1:04:07] but it needs to be a rock-solid
[1:04:08] revelation
[1:04:11] it's not hearing the gospel alone that
[1:04:12] gives us faith
[1:04:15] it's the source in which we hear it from
[1:04:18] and i'm not talking about the preacher
[1:04:21] i'm talking about his spirit
[1:04:24] what's important uh if i can't do
[1:04:26] anything but to try to uh
[1:04:29] uh
[1:04:30] uh
[1:04:32] help us
[1:04:33] to get more prepared for the word
[1:04:35] tonight then that's what i want to do
[1:04:37] because we've been so used to just
[1:04:39] plopping into church
[1:04:40] wanting to hear from god wanting to be
[1:04:43] blessed by god but doing nothing to
[1:04:45] prepare
[1:04:48] it's like what are we we're mocking god
[1:04:50] we're making we're putting god so much
[1:04:53] lower than us
[1:04:55] what we need to do is humble ourselves
[1:04:57] underneath god and call upon him god i
[1:05:00] need you i need to hear from you there's
[1:05:02] no life in the world i've come to church
[1:05:04] to hear from you directly
[1:05:10] too much looking at this is wrong and
[1:05:12] that's wrong and what about this and
[1:05:13] what about that and i think this
[1:05:16] what about humbling ourselves to hear
[1:05:17] from god
[1:05:20] we must hear the gospel from god himself
[1:05:26] how many times do you hear me say i wish
[1:05:27] there was a veil right here so you
[1:05:28] couldn't see my body
[1:05:31] i want you to hear from god
[1:05:35] no matter how much
[1:05:36] i want you to see something
[1:05:38] have you ever tried to show somebody
[1:05:40] something
[1:05:41] you tried you tried and they just don't
[1:05:44] get it
[1:05:46] so
[1:05:47] it didn't happen because the lack of
[1:05:48] effort
[1:05:53] and when it comes
[1:05:55] to the word
[1:05:56] only god can reveal
[1:06:00] you don't strike it one out of a hundred
[1:06:02] you don't strike it at all only god is
[1:06:05] reserved revelation from above
[1:06:08] only god can reveal
[1:06:12] and a solid way to know whether or not
[1:06:14] you're really prepared for church is by
[1:06:17] analyzing
[1:06:18] your spirit
[1:06:19] and your attitude
[1:06:22] in other words every one of us come into
[1:06:24] church either
[1:06:26] like vashti or like esther
[1:06:29] we're approaching the throne we're
[1:06:31] approaching god we're approaching the
[1:06:34] word
[1:06:35] either with reverence
[1:06:37] and i'm unworthy
[1:06:39] waiting for him to hold out or we come
[1:06:42] in thinking
[1:06:44] i belong here and i deserve this
[1:06:49] you check on that you'll see whether
[1:06:51] you're prepared or not
[1:06:55] that's not just another good story in
[1:06:57] there that's for us for our admonition
[1:06:59] amen
[1:07:00] hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us
[1:07:02] therefore
[1:07:04] fear so what's the end result then
[1:07:07] let us therefore fear
[1:07:09] lest a promise be left us of entering
[1:07:12] into his rest any of
[1:07:14] you
[1:07:15] should seem to come short of it
[1:07:19] so we can come short of entering in
[1:07:24] of entering into the spirit entering
[1:07:26] into god entering into the promises of
[1:07:29] god we come short
[1:07:31] we can want it we can desire it but we
[1:07:33] can come short
[1:07:35] and he goes on and gives us a perfect
[1:07:37] example of this in verse 2 for unto us
[1:07:40] was the gospel preached as well as unto
[1:07:42] them
[1:07:44] but the word preached did not profit
[1:07:46] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:07:50] that what heard it
[1:07:53] so they heard the gospel but they didn't
[1:07:56] hear from god
[1:07:59] they heard from man
[1:08:00] they heard the gospel it was preached it
[1:08:02] was even god sent men
[1:08:06] but they
[1:08:08] didn't get into the spirit
[1:08:11] they didn't feel they needed to give
[1:08:12] anything more to get there
[1:08:15] and the bible was telling us we need to
[1:08:17] fear
[1:08:18] we actually have to have a fear
[1:08:21] of i could miss this i could come short
[1:08:23] i could not be ready for the word
[1:08:28] just let that laodice
[1:08:30] let us see a spirit stay on us when we
[1:08:33] come into the church
[1:08:34] and we expect god to do this and this
[1:08:36] and this and this for us
[1:08:43] he's faithful
[1:08:45] we need to do our part
[1:08:48] the gospel itself didn't bring faith
[1:08:54] but being in sync with god is what
[1:08:57] brings faith amen that's right
[1:09:02] you know people could
[1:09:04] go to colleges and talk about bible for
[1:09:07] years and get degrees to all get out
[1:09:10] and be further away from god than when
[1:09:12] they started brother adam said
[1:09:16] but to be in sync with god
[1:09:18] you know what it's like when your
[1:09:20] wi-fi goes on and all sudden all your
[1:09:23] apps start
[1:09:24] you know
[1:09:25] uh
[1:09:28] re-updating thank you it's like uh
[1:09:31] you're not even it's doing it and when
[1:09:33] it's done is there
[1:09:35] and that's what happens when we're in
[1:09:36] sync with god when we're in the spirit
[1:09:38] when we're full of faith when we're
[1:09:40] hearing from him directly
[1:09:43] we're not allowing the devil to tell us
[1:09:46] about reasoning and all this that we
[1:09:48] don't like and what about this and what
[1:09:50] about i'm here for one thing and that's
[1:09:52] god
[1:09:53] and i need the whole world is going down
[1:09:56] the tubes and if they had the answer
[1:09:57] that jesus christ was the same yesterday
[1:09:59] today and forever if they really knew
[1:10:01] that
[1:10:05] what a difference it would be
[1:10:09] god
[1:10:10] speaks
[1:10:13] directly to all of us
[1:10:17] but we've got to be in tune
[1:10:19] just the frequencies
[1:10:22] get out of the flesh
[1:10:23] into the spirit
[1:10:25] and really it's all a condition about
[1:10:27] heart now i want to make this real clear
[1:10:30] you can be in the flesh
[1:10:32] you can be carnals all get out and god
[1:10:34] could still speak to you
[1:10:36] and he did every one of us when we were
[1:10:38] in the world
[1:10:40] and he can do it any time
[1:10:43] but to the mature believer this is not
[1:10:45] how he operates
[1:10:47] to his bride this is not how he operates
[1:10:49] if he did he would have let vashti get
[1:10:51] away with it
[1:10:53] but she was made an example
[1:10:56] and we need to learn
[1:10:59] to wait on the lord
[1:11:01] we need to stand still in our spirit and
[1:11:04] know that he is god that he's speaking
[1:11:08] and that i will be quiet until i hear
[1:11:10] but one thing i will not do is i will i
[1:11:13] will not stop calling on god my spirit
[1:11:16] my heart my desires the inside the
[1:11:19] invisible is going to be calling on god
[1:11:21] because i need him
[1:11:28] so
[1:11:29] when you're hearing the gospel
[1:11:31] and something just isn't clicking you're
[1:11:33] not
[1:11:34] really hearing from god
[1:11:37] you have a responsibility call upon him
[1:11:41] call upon him don't stop
[1:11:43] don't don't act like beshte i'm not
[1:11:45] doing nothing until i get what i want
[1:11:48] call upon him humble yourself
[1:11:52] and if you hear
[1:11:53] god speak to you
[1:11:56] you know what you have to do
[1:11:58] call upon him
[1:12:00] because that's what the gospel says
[1:12:02] either way you have to call upon him
[1:12:06] because now what he's spoken to you
[1:12:08] he expects it to be manifested and you
[1:12:11] know you can't manifest the word
[1:12:14] on your own
[1:12:15] it takes god in you there's nothing he's
[1:12:18] not going to share his glory with
[1:12:19] anybody
[1:12:20] it's either christ and it's the hope of
[1:12:22] glory or that's it
[1:12:24] either way we have to call upon the lord
[1:12:28] all right go back to romans chapter
[1:12:31] uh
[1:12:32] 17 10 17.
[1:12:36] so then faith cometh by hearing and
[1:12:37] hearing by the word of god but i say
[1:12:40] have they not all heard
[1:12:43] yes
[1:12:44] verily their sound went out to all the
[1:12:46] earth and their words unto the ends of
[1:12:49] the world world so they heard the word
[1:12:52] we come to church no matter what
[1:12:54] condition we're in we hear the gospel
[1:12:59] but i say
[1:13:00] did not israel know
[1:13:02] first moses saith i will provoke you to
[1:13:05] jealousy by them that are no people and
[1:13:07] by a foolish nation i will anger you
[1:13:11] and isaias
[1:13:12] is very bold and saith i was found of
[1:13:16] them that sought me not
[1:13:20] and i was made manifest unto them that
[1:13:22] asked not after me
[1:13:25] the word
[1:13:26] comes
[1:13:28] and it is christ himself
[1:13:31] here
[1:13:32] he made it real clear where two or three
[1:13:34] are gathered in my name i'll be in the
[1:13:35] midst
[1:13:36] there's we should never be doubting
[1:13:38] god's presence what we should be
[1:13:40] doubting is am i really in the spirit am
[1:13:42] i in sync with god am i ready to receive
[1:13:44] him or am i still in the flesh
[1:13:51] verse 21 but to israel he saith all
[1:13:55] day
[1:13:56] long think about this he's with us all
[1:13:58] day long
[1:13:59] i have stretched forth my hand
[1:14:03] unto a disobedient and gang-sane people
[1:14:07] now you say brother john what are you
[1:14:08] preaching that to us we're not like that
[1:14:12] you know what that word disobedient
[1:14:13] means
[1:14:15] it means disbelieving
[1:14:19] disbelieving all day long trying to get
[1:14:21] us to believe
[1:14:23] gang saying that just simply means to
[1:14:25] refuse to contradict to debate to deny
[1:14:29] and even speak against
[1:14:33] all day long that's what god's dealing
[1:14:35] with he's got a hard job convincing us
[1:14:37] that we're wrong
[1:14:38] a very hard job because you know we're
[1:14:40] so right in our own eyes going our own
[1:14:43] direction doing our own thing and nobody
[1:14:45] can tell us that's who god deals with
[1:14:49] that's why we need to fear
[1:14:51] that's why we need to call upon say i
[1:14:53] could be wrong here god speak to me
[1:14:55] reveal to me it is the most important
[1:14:58] thing that we can pray for is revelation
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:02] god ain't gonna just hand it over to us
[1:15:04] because my name is john martin that
[1:15:06] don't mean anything to god that's just
[1:15:08] pride
[1:15:11] but he gives grace to the humble
[1:15:15] he gives more grace to donvo
[1:15:18] i think paul
[1:15:21] humbled himself
[1:15:23] so much that he got abundance of
[1:15:25] revelations
[1:15:26] and then he had to deal with the
[1:15:27] abundance of revelation
[1:15:29] but you know what i'd rather have that
[1:15:30] happen than just be without christ
[1:15:33] honestly
[1:15:35] now we may be perfectly in the will of
[1:15:37] god today
[1:15:38] which we are here
[1:15:40] at our posted duty
[1:15:43] but we need to be in sync with the word
[1:15:46] not just be here at church
[1:15:49] not be just in sync with the church
[1:15:51] attendance
[1:15:52] but be in sync with the spirit
[1:15:55] the spirit not brother john don't have
[1:15:57] to agree with me don't even have to like
[1:15:59] me
[1:16:01] honestly but you need to be in sync with
[1:16:04] the holy ghost because i couldn't give
[1:16:06] revelation if i wanted to
[1:16:08] and if i could i would
[1:16:11] and i'm so glad god's in charge of all
[1:16:13] that
[1:16:14] because he hid it from the wise and
[1:16:16] prudent didn't he
[1:16:18] brother branham said in the message
[1:16:20] revelation of jesus christ it says he is
[1:16:22] not to be known intellectually
[1:16:25] he is known spiritually by spiritual
[1:16:28] revelation now this sounds spooky and
[1:16:31] scary
[1:16:32] but you know what we got to get out of
[1:16:34] just being comfortable being in church
[1:16:36] here
[1:16:37] we've got to get out of the flesh and
[1:16:39] say god i need to be direct with you i
[1:16:42] need direct connection with you
[1:16:45] you got to shake off this lukewarmness
[1:16:47] just shake it off and you know none of
[1:16:50] us have a desire to go get lukewarm
[1:16:53] none of us no we're not guilty of that
[1:16:56] we're guilty of not keeping it off of us
[1:17:00] we're guilty of of not saying
[1:17:04] um god give me isaf to see and clean up
[1:17:08] my ears and help me to hear what the
[1:17:10] spirit is saying to the church today
[1:17:12] that's what we're guilty of we're guilty
[1:17:14] of not calling out to god and saying
[1:17:16] help me this flesh is like it just
[1:17:18] gravitates that this world
[1:17:21] not our heart
[1:17:22] not our spirit
[1:17:24] not the christian inward man that we are
[1:17:26] this outward flesh and before you know
[1:17:29] it we could be so
[1:17:31] encumbered by this giant nature
[1:17:35] we're afraid to deal with it
[1:17:38] we'd rather wander around in the
[1:17:39] wilderness just waiting
[1:17:42] for what
[1:17:43] for what
[1:17:44] the bride is making herself ready
[1:17:48] it's the only way she gets ready for
[1:17:50] rapture
[1:17:52] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14.
[1:17:55] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 but
[1:17:57] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:18:01] of the spirit of god
[1:18:04] for their foolishness unto him how many
[1:18:07] i remember when i first came to this
[1:18:09] truth
[1:18:11] i heard a lot of things
[1:18:13] and i thought it was kooky
[1:18:16] i thought it was foolish
[1:18:19] and i went to church for so long and
[1:18:20] nobody told me how to cut my hair
[1:18:24] nobody told me how to get rid of my
[1:18:25] worldly music
[1:18:28] and i started hearing things
[1:18:30] and they just they were foolishness to
[1:18:32] me
[1:18:34] but i didn't know him
[1:18:37] i didn't know him
[1:18:40] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:18:42] of the spirit of god for their
[1:18:43] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:18:46] them because they are
[1:18:48] spiritually revealed
[1:18:52] that doesn't mean we sit there in a
[1:18:54] carnal state and discern what we think
[1:18:56] is spiritual and what is not
[1:19:01] what that means is we get to a place
[1:19:03] where god can actually deal with us and
[1:19:05] show us tell us something
[1:19:07] tell us more than what we know
[1:19:10] the word the living
[1:19:13] word of god
[1:19:15] is the discerner
[1:19:17] the bible tells us the word of god is a
[1:19:18] discern of the thoughts intents of the
[1:19:20] heart but you know what it's also a
[1:19:21] discerner of and we're all looking for
[1:19:23] that the god comes he just deserves
[1:19:24] certain things that have taken place in
[1:19:26] my in my life today we all want that
[1:19:28] it's like gives you like an extra boost
[1:19:31] but sometimes he reveals and speaks
[1:19:33] something to our heart that is there and
[1:19:35] we don't want it because it's something
[1:19:37] we have to deal with
[1:19:38] and then we don't like that discernment
[1:19:42] and then we begin to reason
[1:19:44] that was brother john
[1:19:46] or that was
[1:19:47] somebody told somebody or whatever
[1:19:51] but you know that word
[1:19:53] is also
[1:19:55] the discerner
[1:19:58] of explaining it to you
[1:20:01] so we're hearing all these things we
[1:20:03] come to church for now and we hear all
[1:20:04] this word being preached and
[1:20:07] we need to get in think with it we can
[1:20:09] have confidence when we look to the lord
[1:20:11] to look to the spirit of god that that
[1:20:14] spirit is the one that can
[1:20:16] reveal it to us to discern what it
[1:20:18] really means the true interpretation of
[1:20:20] the word to your life for your life
[1:20:25] and it happens when we're in sync with
[1:20:27] him
[1:20:28] it's like
[1:20:29] you know that you know that you know
[1:20:33] and you don't even know how you know
[1:20:35] because he just made it known
[1:20:39] and you're like
[1:20:40] what just happened
[1:20:42] but it was him
[1:20:43] it was him and you and it can happen
[1:20:46] more often
[1:20:48] you believe that
[1:20:50] amen all right verse 11. go back up to
[1:20:53] verse 11. for what man knoweth the
[1:20:55] things of a man
[1:20:58] save the spirit of a man that's true how
[1:21:00] many times you sit and watch birds or
[1:21:02] dogs and cats and you you ask what i
[1:21:05] wonder what they're saying to one
[1:21:06] another
[1:21:10] and you know a dog will just look at you
[1:21:12] and go
[1:21:15] you can say this and it'll just still
[1:21:17] stay there
[1:21:18] he don't understand
[1:21:20] no man understands the things of a man
[1:21:23] save a man
[1:21:24] we don't know what a an aunt is thinking
[1:21:26] we can try to think about it
[1:21:29] we can try to think about how uh uh
[1:21:32] bears are and and dolphins are and and
[1:21:35] this is probably what they're doing
[1:21:39] and that's about all we can do when
[1:21:41] we're thinking about the spirit of god
[1:21:44] what the word of god really means
[1:21:47] if we didn't have a prophet that came in
[1:21:49] this age we wouldn't know nothing hardly
[1:21:55] it takes the spirit of god to reveal the
[1:21:57] word that's being preached amen it
[1:21:59] doesn't matter what we know it matters
[1:22:02] only what's revealed to us
[1:22:04] i'd rather know half as much and have
[1:22:08] more revealed to me
[1:22:11] because nothing can happen with just
[1:22:13] knowledge there's not a
[1:22:15] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:22:16] there's no life on it
[1:22:20] but to be able to live more god's more
[1:22:22] pleased with me
[1:22:24] so it's not the knowledge that we're
[1:22:25] after amen it's the spirit of god
[1:22:28] okay let's finish reading it for what
[1:22:30] man knoweth the things of man save the
[1:22:31] spirit of man which is in him even so
[1:22:35] the things of god knoweth no
[1:22:38] man
[1:22:41] but the spirit of god
[1:22:43] our dependency is that god will come
[1:22:47] and go through this
[1:22:50] mind of humanity
[1:22:53] to reveal himself to us that's what our
[1:22:56] dependencies on it's on him
[1:22:58] god is not going to let anybody take
[1:23:00] some glory
[1:23:02] like he figured it out he's you know
[1:23:04] he's got the smarts he had to take paul
[1:23:07] who was very smart saul were very smart
[1:23:09] and then knock him off that mindset
[1:23:12] to a place that he got i know nothing
[1:23:14] except jesus christ and him crucified
[1:23:18] he had an abundance of revelations from
[1:23:19] the crucifixion from calvary
[1:23:22] praise god and that's you're not don't
[1:23:24] get away from calvary
[1:23:26] stay right there stay close to what
[1:23:28] jesus has done for you
[1:23:30] romans chapter 1 verse
[1:23:32] number 15 i just
[1:23:35] romans chapter 1 verse 15 soul as much
[1:23:38] as in me
[1:23:40] i am ready
[1:23:42] to preach the gospel to you that are in
[1:23:44] world wars i have to say this today how
[1:23:47] many is ready to preach the gospel
[1:23:50] how many is ready to be instant in
[1:23:51] season and out of season how many is in
[1:23:54] sync with god because unless he's
[1:23:57] working through you
[1:23:58] now i do believe you got to step out by
[1:24:01] faith and you got to go ye out but
[1:24:03] there's got to be a faith inside of you
[1:24:06] that your
[1:24:07] your steps are being ordered of the lord
[1:24:09] and you're moving in the direction that
[1:24:11] he wants you to
[1:24:14] for i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:24:17] christ
[1:24:18] for it is the power of god
[1:24:22] the power of god is in the word
[1:24:27] and it's not the written word
[1:24:31] it's the spirit that moved on holy men
[1:24:34] of old as they wrote
[1:24:36] as they penned it it was god in the men
[1:24:39] that penned this
[1:24:41] and what we're wanting is we're wanting
[1:24:43] the spirit that wrote the word
[1:24:47] well the true interpretation of what's
[1:24:49] behind it we want that living in me
[1:24:52] not to make sure that i got the right
[1:24:53] knowledge or the right take on it or the
[1:24:56] no
[1:24:56] we need it living inside of us
[1:25:00] so it's the power of god and salvation
[1:25:02] to
[1:25:03] everyone that believeth to the jew first
[1:25:06] and then also to the greek for therein
[1:25:08] is the righteousness of god revealed
[1:25:11] from faith
[1:25:13] to faith
[1:25:15] as it is written
[1:25:19] i live by faith
[1:25:23] if you're just
[1:25:25] you don't live by anything but faith
[1:25:28] i'm just this is the gospel this is not
[1:25:30] the john martin gospel i'm reading out
[1:25:32] of the king james version called the
[1:25:34] bible
[1:25:36] the just shall live by faith
[1:25:39] so we could read it like this
[1:25:43] for therein is the righteousness of god
[1:25:45] revealed from revelation to revelation
[1:25:50] from substance to substance from the
[1:25:51] voice of god spoken to you personally to
[1:25:53] the voice of god's spoken to you
[1:25:55] personally
[1:25:57] that's why i can't i can't live by your
[1:25:58] revelation i can't live off of what you
[1:26:01] think
[1:26:02] i can only live by what god speaks to
[1:26:06] me that's why it's important to know who
[1:26:09] your head is
[1:26:12] i don't know where i'd be without a
[1:26:14] prophet i just don't know
[1:26:20] there's and i'll tell you this is why
[1:26:22] you're going to read the bible
[1:26:24] and you're going to come across things
[1:26:26] that you do not understand that do not
[1:26:28] make sense that just don't seem right
[1:26:30] that seem to be contradictory
[1:26:32] and you're going to see that same thing
[1:26:35] transpire
[1:26:36] when you read the message when you hear
[1:26:38] the tapes
[1:26:40] i thought this i thought that there's
[1:26:42] got to be an absolute somewhere you've
[1:26:44] got to have an absolute
[1:26:46] and i'm telling you
[1:26:48] until you get revelation of any subject
[1:26:54] any subject
[1:26:55] you need to be calling on god with fear
[1:26:58] i mean some people don't want to pay
[1:27:00] tithes okay don't pay dice that's
[1:27:01] between you and god in between me and
[1:27:03] you and god it's between you and god
[1:27:05] but don't just say i'm not going to do
[1:27:07] it because that's not what i think
[1:27:09] i'm literally i get taxes from people
[1:27:11] don't go to this church
[1:27:13] people that have been in this church
[1:27:14] years years years many years ago
[1:27:17] about you don't have to pay ties
[1:27:21] hey that's their business
[1:27:23] but i i i say this
[1:27:25] if you heard it preached
[1:27:28] you listened
[1:27:30] to the message you heard the prophet
[1:27:33] if you're wrestling with it call upon
[1:27:36] god
[1:27:36] humble yourself to call upon god don't
[1:27:39] don't don't just
[1:27:41] you know say i don't have to don't do
[1:27:43] that
[1:27:44] don't do that
[1:27:47] give god a greater chance and when i say
[1:27:50] that what i'm meaning is humility god
[1:27:53] can't help the proud he just actually
[1:27:55] resists it he reads just like king
[1:27:59] resisted vashti
[1:28:03] and as much as he didn't want to do it
[1:28:06] counsel
[1:28:08] told him he had to
[1:28:11] and and counsel tells us that
[1:28:15] we have to stay with the word we can't
[1:28:16] add one thing we can't take one thing
[1:28:18] away we got to stay it's our absolute
[1:28:24] all right
[1:28:27] now how can we live
[1:28:29] by faith
[1:28:31] if we don't receive it
[1:28:33] the just shall live by faith good what
[1:28:36] if i don't receive faith what if i come
[1:28:37] to church and i just feel like i'm
[1:28:39] further away than when i came you know
[1:28:40] brother brandon says when you come to
[1:28:42] church you never leave church the same
[1:28:44] way
[1:28:45] you're either further away or closer
[1:28:50] so what if i don't receive faith
[1:28:52] then how can you live by it
[1:28:55] you know i've seen this you know people
[1:28:56] don't hear they don't they don't hear
[1:28:58] what they wanted to hear so they just
[1:29:00] kind of
[1:29:01] let let everything go
[1:29:03] and they don't realize that if they
[1:29:05] didn't need that word they're going to
[1:29:06] need it
[1:29:09] and their attitude makes all the
[1:29:11] difference in it
[1:29:14] for the wrath look at this for the wrath
[1:29:17] of god is revealed from heaven
[1:29:20] against all ungodliness and
[1:29:23] unrighteousness in or of men
[1:29:27] who hold the truth
[1:29:29] in unrighteousness
[1:29:32] so
[1:29:33] if it's okay with you i'm just
[1:29:35] going to get right down to the living
[1:29:37] room right here
[1:29:41] do you have any ungodliness in your life
[1:29:45] that should be such an easy question to
[1:29:47] answer of course
[1:29:49] but what does the word come for
[1:29:51] it's to reveal that
[1:29:53] it's to reveal that unrighteousness
[1:29:56] so we can take the next step
[1:30:00] you know god isn't just a god to reveal
[1:30:03] to us to meet all of our needs we have
[1:30:06] spiritual needs
[1:30:08] those are more important than our
[1:30:09] natural needs
[1:30:11] as much as i would love to have another
[1:30:14] 500 000 sitting in the bank and i could
[1:30:16] use it right now
[1:30:18] i really could use it
[1:30:20] not because i want to buy things but you
[1:30:22] know i could just
[1:30:23] i need it
[1:30:25] can only borrow so much money
[1:30:28] but you know what he's more interested
[1:30:30] in seeing his life manifested in me than
[1:30:33] anything about work
[1:30:37] i just have a promise if i put him first
[1:30:39] everything else is added
[1:30:42] so don't try to figure out everything
[1:30:44] just make sure he's first
[1:30:49] all right i see sister shirl's back
[1:30:51] there
[1:30:52] and
[1:30:56] which means
[1:30:57] time
[1:30:58] we saw that video we saw the video that
[1:31:01] was about a 20 minute video
[1:31:03] 25 minute i think
[1:31:06] no no but we got a little bit more if we
[1:31:08] could go
[1:31:10] now look verse 19 because that which may
[1:31:13] be known of god
[1:31:15] is manifest in them
[1:31:18] is manifest in them for god have showed
[1:31:20] it on to them
[1:31:24] so
[1:31:25] god when he preaches the gospel
[1:31:27] everybody's going to be without excuse
[1:31:28] on the day of judgment everybody will be
[1:31:31] because it's been preached
[1:31:34] no he hasn't revealed it to them
[1:31:39] but their heart wasn't for
[1:31:42] it i mean
[1:31:45] look at cain's heart his heart wasn't
[1:31:47] for the truth
[1:31:49] but he was told if you do good you're
[1:31:51] going to be accepted and if you don't
[1:31:52] bye bye
[1:31:55] you know and and that's the thing we all
[1:31:57] we got to do is walk in the word or let
[1:32:00] the word be our head
[1:32:03] revelation will bring god
[1:32:06] on the scene
[1:32:07] to what
[1:32:08] manifests that word in her life that's
[1:32:11] the reason it's revealed
[1:32:13] the reason the word is revealed is to
[1:32:16] manifest jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:32:19] today and forever
[1:32:21] it's not so we can become an
[1:32:22] encyclopedia
[1:32:23] not so we can know the mysteries and all
[1:32:25] the knowledge is so we can live the life
[1:32:27] in front of somebody
[1:32:29] god reveals to you that he is the love
[1:32:32] of god that jesus is the love of god
[1:32:34] then you will become that love of god
[1:32:36] for everybody
[1:32:38] that's that's what that's what it's for
[1:32:41] all hell is against revelation
[1:32:46] that's why he'll distract us and do
[1:32:47] everything he can
[1:32:49] all hell is against christ being
[1:32:51] manifested
[1:32:53] again
[1:32:55] satan wants to put the manifestation the
[1:32:58] life of christ back in history
[1:33:02] you know it's not now it's
[1:33:04] back in history
[1:33:06] so if satan can stop you distract you or
[1:33:09] keep you from being prepared then he can
[1:33:11] stop the manifestation of christ in you
[1:33:15] then he don't have to worry about what's
[1:33:16] going to happen when you leave the
[1:33:17] church
[1:33:19] but if you just get one man in his hands
[1:33:22] he'll turn things upside down won't he
[1:33:25] why is satan so against revelation
[1:33:27] because that's the only thing that god
[1:33:29] said he'd build his church on
[1:33:32] he's trying to stop the building of the
[1:33:34] church
[1:33:38] we don't care if there's 5 000 people in
[1:33:40] here
[1:33:42] and in one sense i don't think
[1:33:45] satan cares
[1:33:46] but he don't want one person living it
[1:33:49] amen he don't want one person
[1:33:51] manifesting the truth
[1:33:53] why is satan so against the
[1:33:55] manifestation of christ in life because
[1:33:58] it's only through the manifestation of
[1:34:01] the word that we can literally destroy
[1:34:04] the devil in our lives
[1:34:06] the word has to come to life
[1:34:09] would we say
[1:34:11] satan get behind me
[1:34:13] it's got to come forth from the heart of
[1:34:14] faith
[1:34:16] it can't come to just head knowledge
[1:34:18] are you with me acts chapter 19 verse 13
[1:34:21] will you just let me go on just a little
[1:34:22] bit
[1:34:24] remember
[1:34:26] the wandering vagabonds you remember i'm
[1:34:29] sure you do in acts chapter 19 verse 13
[1:34:31] then certain of the vagabond jews
[1:34:33] exorcists took upon them to call over
[1:34:36] them which had evil spirits
[1:34:39] the name of the lord jesus saying we
[1:34:42] adjure you
[1:34:43] by jesus
[1:34:45] whom paul preacheth in other words we
[1:34:47] want to make it clear which jesus we're
[1:34:49] talking about
[1:34:51] i'll make it real clear it's the one
[1:34:53] that paul talks the one that brother
[1:34:55] branham talks about it's the one that
[1:34:58] your favorite preacher talks about
[1:35:02] and there were seven sons of one skeva
[1:35:06] a jew a chief of the priest which did so
[1:35:09] and the evil spirits
[1:35:11] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:35:14] jesus i know
[1:35:17] and paul i know
[1:35:20] but i don't know you
[1:35:25] i don't know you
[1:35:28] here these evil spirits
[1:35:31] were requiring
[1:35:33] a manifestation of who they were
[1:35:36] no different than jesus many will come
[1:35:38] to me in that day
[1:35:39] he says i never knew you in that
[1:35:42] spiritual realm you've got to take a
[1:35:44] side
[1:35:47] because if you're just going to be in
[1:35:48] the middle
[1:35:50] even though you use the name of jesus
[1:35:51] and you cast out devils and do many
[1:35:53] wonderful works
[1:35:55] or you want to try to use the name of
[1:35:57] jesus without having the life
[1:36:01] and
[1:36:03] you know it's it's you need
[1:36:06] to cha to choose the side you're going
[1:36:08] to be on and stay there
[1:36:10] are you with me
[1:36:12] you don't want to be jesus dealing with
[1:36:15] jesus i know paul i know but who are you
[1:36:17] you don't want to be dealing with the
[1:36:18] spirit that's calling you out
[1:36:20] because he will
[1:36:22] he will
[1:36:24] it's the life behind the name that makes
[1:36:27] the demons trouble
[1:36:29] it's a life behind the name that makes
[1:36:31] the proud more humble
[1:36:33] it was god who devised the plan that in
[1:36:35] all things like a man that he would live
[1:36:37] so he could give
[1:36:39] to us
[1:36:41] the life behind the name
[1:36:44] revelation comes so the word can now
[1:36:46] become manifested that's why it's so
[1:36:48] valuable
[1:36:49] if we
[1:36:50] if we can sit and be content with
[1:36:52] knowledge and then we're not interested
[1:36:54] in manifesting christ enough
[1:36:57] we need to get back to god
[1:36:59] i need you i i'm calling upon you i'm
[1:37:02] not satisfied with the results that i've
[1:37:04] been getting when i've been going to
[1:37:05] church i need to manifest more of you
[1:37:11] remember
[1:37:12] he
[1:37:13] fills those that hunger and thirst after
[1:37:16] righteousness
[1:37:17] but if we're content without the hunger
[1:37:19] how is he going to fill us
[1:37:21] amen
[1:37:22] jesus james said the devils believe and
[1:37:25] they tremble
[1:37:28] look about this the devils believe and
[1:37:31] they tremble
[1:37:32] the weak is christian when he's on his
[1:37:34] knees the devil trembles
[1:37:38] he's not big spiritual with revelation
[1:37:40] but you know what he's doing
[1:37:42] things that we don't do
[1:37:44] getting on our knees and calling upon
[1:37:45] him
[1:37:47] you want to make the devil tremble in
[1:37:49] your life get serious with god i don't
[1:37:51] care how weak or how strong you are just
[1:37:53] get on your knees and start calling upon
[1:37:55] god and the devil will tremble at you
[1:37:59] because you're calling upon the one
[1:38:02] who's who wants to give us life-giving
[1:38:05] and prevailing revelation
[1:38:07] by his spirit
[1:38:11] god is real
[1:38:13] and we need to
[1:38:14] energize and and cultivate
[1:38:18] the life of christ inside of us
[1:38:21] first john chapter 3 verse 8
[1:38:27] this purpose the son of god was
[1:38:29] manifested
[1:38:30] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:38:33] devil
[1:38:34] now you want to destroy the devil in
[1:38:35] your life
[1:38:37] amen amen
[1:38:39] well just think about a soft answer
[1:38:41] turns away wrath
[1:38:44] okay
[1:38:45] when you manifest the word
[1:38:47] you will destroy the obstacles that are
[1:38:50] in front of you
[1:38:52] and and
[1:38:54] god wants to see himself manifested in
[1:38:57] us because god is the only one that can
[1:38:59] destroy the devil
[1:39:04] romans chapter 8
[1:39:06] verse 19. we know that the whole
[1:39:08] creation is growing and travailing in
[1:39:11] pain until now
[1:39:13] now now there's no more time than now
[1:39:16] for this to be man for this to be
[1:39:18] manifested romans 8 19 for the earnest
[1:39:21] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:39:24] the manifestations of the sons of god
[1:39:28] all of god's creation heaven earth
[1:39:30] angels demons everything is waiting for
[1:39:33] the manifestation
[1:39:36] of what
[1:39:38] of a million dollars
[1:39:42] of my third home
[1:39:45] my six car
[1:39:47] my financial
[1:39:48] secure
[1:39:50] business
[1:39:52] no
[1:39:53] all of god's creation is waiting for the
[1:39:56] manifestation of us
[1:40:03] now where are we at in that vision
[1:40:07] where are we at in that vision
[1:40:10] we've got to enter in it
[1:40:12] the bride is in the process of making
[1:40:15] herself ready
[1:40:16] now how is she doing that
[1:40:18] she's preparing herself for the word
[1:40:21] capstone every time she hears the word
[1:40:24] to make sure she's catching the
[1:40:26] revelation of it
[1:40:28] not just being satisfied with hearing it
[1:40:31] with these ears
[1:40:32] but
[1:40:33] being of those who mix that word that
[1:40:36] they're hearing
[1:40:37] with faith
[1:40:39] and you know what
[1:40:40] you can't make faith
[1:40:42] you can't manufacture it
[1:40:44] that comes from god alone and the only
[1:40:46] way you get that is in your relationship
[1:40:49] so when i say call upon the lord spend
[1:40:51] time praying seek god prepare your heart
[1:40:53] you know what i'm talking about i'm
[1:40:54] talking about your relationship
[1:40:57] i'm not referring to
[1:41:00] church attendance
[1:41:02] i'm talking about
[1:41:04] why are you here
[1:41:07] why did you come today what are you
[1:41:09] looking to take home with you
[1:41:15] let's stand together
[1:41:19] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17
[1:41:21] and 18
[1:41:22] we got to give
[1:41:25] liberty
[1:41:27] to the holy spirit
[1:41:29] the bible says now the lord is that
[1:41:31] spirit and where the spirit of the lord
[1:41:33] is there is liberty
[1:41:34] but we all with open face as in a glass
[1:41:38] beholding us in the glass the glory of
[1:41:40] the lord
[1:41:42] we're changed
[1:41:43] into the same image
[1:41:46] from glory
[1:41:48] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:41:53] lord may god begin by his spirit to give
[1:41:57] continuous
[1:41:58] life-giving and prevailing
[1:42:02] revelation
[1:42:05] it's we we need to look to him for what
[1:42:08] we need
[1:42:09] through the spirit and i'll tell you
[1:42:12] it doesn't
[1:42:14] stop it's continuous
[1:42:18] life-giving you know every day we need
[1:42:20] new life we eat
[1:42:21] right we drink we eat we
[1:42:23] we need it to keep going
[1:42:26] so we need not just to read the bible
[1:42:29] but we need
[1:42:31] to receive the spirit of the word
[1:42:34] because that's where the life is at
[1:42:37] otherwise we're just gaining knowledge
[1:42:40] so may the the lord
[1:42:43] move in our hearts to start calling upon
[1:42:46] him more
[1:42:46] we do this in our homes we do it on the
[1:42:48] way to church
[1:42:49] we can we can come here and make sure
[1:42:51] that we take that half hour that we get
[1:42:53] before service and really calling the
[1:42:56] lord
[1:42:57] ready to start activating because we
[1:42:59] want god to move don't we
[1:43:01] amen let's
[1:43:02] just bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:43:04] our heavenly father we come to you
[1:43:07] lord with ourselves we don't have
[1:43:09] anything else to bring we don't even
[1:43:11] have anything to offer

[1:43:17] earth is my footstool what house will
[1:43:19] you build me
[1:43:21] lord the only thing that we have to
[1:43:23] offer you today

[1:43:34] and live inside of
[1:43:36] us and and take what we give you
[1:43:41] but we want you to come in and take
[1:43:42] liberty
[1:43:44] take liberty
[1:43:46] lord our our yearning and our desire
[1:43:51] is to be in your image
[1:43:53] that when the world looks at us they
[1:43:54] they don't see us
[1:43:56] they see a
[1:43:58] your nature coming out of us
[1:44:03] i know through that
[1:44:04] lord we'll have to suffer a lot we'll go
[1:44:07] through a lot
[1:44:09] but in the end
[1:44:10] your word says
[1:44:12] that the sufferings of this present
[1:44:13] world are not worthy to be compared with
[1:44:15] the glory that shall be revealed as
[1:44:18] god we're all looking for that time
[1:44:21] i pray that you would
[1:44:23] bless each one here lord with the
[1:44:25] revelation of just this message
