[10:50] have different situations, but my
[10:52] biggest prayer is that we all draw
[10:54] closer to God
[10:57] by the word that's going to come forth
[10:59] tonight. So, we just pray that God gives
[11:02] us the faith to believe that and that we
[11:04] walk in it when it's uh preached. Amen.
[11:08] He gives us the light, but we need to
[11:10] walk in the light as he gives it to us.
[11:12] Amen. So, let's just remember all those
[11:14] that aren't feeling well for whatever
[11:16] reason. Let's remember our brother Marty
[11:18] with his hip. Um our brother Jonathan
[11:23] with some of the issues that he's
[11:25] having. We're all having some sort of an

[11:32] Our sister Cheryl, good to see our
[11:34] sister Ann back with us. Amen.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Good to see our brother Mike. He hasn't
[11:40] been with us in a while, but praise the
[11:42] Lord. He p took a bus here and uh uh
[11:47] brother John picked him up, I believe.
[11:49] And um so this is the determination that
[11:53] you know, though, no go with me, I'll
[11:56] still follow. So we appreciate
[11:59] uh his spirit and desire to be here.
[12:02] Amen. Just let's remember our keep our
[12:06] sister Donna lifted up. Amen. It's good
[12:09] to see her on Sunday. We pray the Lord
[12:11] strengthen her and that that she can uh
[12:15] come again. Amen.
[12:17] So, uh, we're still in this journey all
[12:20] together
[12:22] and, uh, we just pray that, uh, Lord's
[12:25] with us as we journey through this
[12:27] barren time and, uh, he delivers us.
[12:31] Amen. Let's remember all the
[12:33] missionaries. If anybody has a request
[12:36] in their heart, just let it be known to

[31:57] not man's word that has thought of good
[32:02] things to say or that would be right or
[32:05] about you. But they are literally the
[32:08] word of God that's forever settled in
[32:11] heaven. This word is just as fresh as
[32:14] the day it was written and is just as
[32:16] meaningful today as ever. And Lord,
[32:20] we're asking for your anointing to come
[32:23] amongst us at this time and that you
[32:25] would anoint us all with the Holy Ghost.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Anoint our lips, anoint our ears, anoint
[32:32] our hearts, and Lord, help us to receive
[32:35] the engrafted word that we might learn
[32:38] to lean upon you a little bit more. For
[32:41] we need you, heavenly father. We commit
[32:42] the service, ask your blessings now in
[32:45] the remainder in Jesus Christ's name.
[32:47] Amen.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you. may be seated.
[32:52] But this is a a very it's a very strong
[32:56] statement. Woe to them that go down to
[33:00] Egypt for help. That word woe is a
[33:04] divine pro pronouncement of judgment and
[33:08] impending doom.
[33:10] So it isn't just, hey, you need to think
[33:14] it over. It is. You're in trouble if you
[33:17] go down to Egypt
[33:20] for help.
[33:22] Woe to them that go down to Egypt for
[33:25] help. God brought us all up out of
[33:28] Egypt.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Why would we want to go back there for
[33:31] help?
[33:34] God brought us out of the world.
[33:37] Their way of doing things, their way of
[33:40] handling matters, God brought us out of
[33:42] that. I remember being raised by my dad.
[33:44] He did the best he could. He was a a
[33:47] Catholic and he handled manners in the
[33:51] way that he thought they should be
[33:53] handled. And um no um condemning or
[33:57] anything like that. But when you meet
[34:00] the Lord and you meet the word of God,
[34:02] you have his way of doing things.
[34:06] And there is that tendency if you don't
[34:08] if you don't have a strong relationship
[34:10] with the Lord, you have a tendency of
[34:14] leaning back towards the things of the
[34:16] world. How to handle situations.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; So why would we consider looking to
[34:21] anything in this world for our help?
[34:25] Because we came out of the world. God
[34:27] called us out of the world. He says
[34:29] you're not of the world. and he prayed
[34:32] that he would that we would be kept from
[34:34] the world.
[34:36] I shared this little story in our men's
[34:39] meeting tonight. I've made mention it
[34:40] here from the pulpit when brother
[34:41] Brandham
[34:43] he lost his wife, he lost his daughter
[34:47] and it was the I would say probably the
[34:49] darkest hour because God was even
[34:52] teaching a lesson at that time. uh
[34:55] because God told him to do something and
[34:57] he wanted to do he he he he paid
[35:00] attention uh not to God's word if I
[35:03] could just say it like that and um he
[35:06] was just in the worst time of his life
[35:10] it seemed and someone asked him he said
[35:13] Billy in all this trouble did you keep
[35:16] your religion
[35:20] and he said no it kept me
[35:24] the anchor held.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And so the question is, if what we
[35:29] believe in is so real, it ought to keep
[35:32] us in our trials.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; And if we're not being kept in our
[35:37] trials, we need to get rid of what we
[35:38] got and get what it takes to be held by
[35:41] the word of God.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Because we shouldn't be, you know, going
[35:44] back out into other things than the word
[35:48] of God to try to find our help.
[35:52] In 1 Corinthians chapter 6, Paul
[35:55] addresses the church.
[35:58] And in the first seven verses of 1
[36:02] Corinthians chapter 6, Paul asks nine
[36:05] questions.
[36:07] In in in the first seven verses, what
[36:10] was Paul doing? He was trying to get the
[36:12] church to look at their motive
[36:16] and how they were acting so carnal and
[36:19] how that their relationship with God was
[36:21] not even very strong. And so that's why
[36:24] he poses the questions to the church
[36:27] because he's trying to get them to think
[36:29] out of the box that they were in.
[36:32] See, they believed it was okay to go
[36:34] back down into Egypt to get help. Right?
[36:38] &gt;&gt; They didn't think it was necessary to
[36:39] really rely on God and his word and his
[36:42] way of doing things. They thought it
[36:44] would be better if they just handled
[36:46] things the way they did when they grew
[36:47] up, right? The way their mom and dad
[36:50] taught, the way they things happen in
[36:52] the home. So, they just decided to
[36:55] handle things in a very carnal sense.
[36:57] So, let's pick it up at 1 Corinthians
[36:58] chapter 6 verse one. Dare any of you,
[37:02] dare any of you having a matter against
[37:05] another go to the law before the unjust
[37:08] and not before the saints? Here is Paul
[37:12] putting the church above the government
[37:14] in the world.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Because there is no higher order than
[37:19] the word of God.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the courts say out
[37:23] there. There's no higher order than the
[37:25] word of God.
[37:27] Do you not know that the saint shall
[37:29] judge the world?
[37:31] And if the world shall be judged by you,
[37:34] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[37:37] of matters?
[37:38] Know ye not that we shall judge angels?
[37:42] That's a pretty high a pretty high
[37:44] judgment right there. How much more the
[37:47] things that pertain to this life?
[37:50] If then you have judgment of things
[37:52] pertaining to the slate, set them to be
[37:54] judged who are the least esteemed in the
[37:58] church.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; In other words, the very weakest ones
[38:02] among us ought to be able to judge
[38:04] things the correct way.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; That's what the scriptures saying.
[38:10] And we've we've just got some some
[38:13] things hanging out down here.
[38:16] So, I just say we got we got some
[38:18] growing up to do, right? We got some
[38:20] growing to do.
[38:22] And then he says,
[38:25] um, I speak to your shame. I'm saying
[38:29] this to your shame. Is it so that there
[38:32] is not a wise man among you, know not
[38:35] one that shall be able to judge between
[38:38] his brethren?
[38:41] But brother go to the law with brother
[38:44] and that before the unbelievers
[38:47] going before unbelievers to judge two
[38:49] brothers.
[38:51] You know it just you know God's ways are
[38:54] not our ways.
[38:56] Now therefore there isn't there is
[38:58] utterly a fault among you because you go
[39:01] to the law with one another. Why do you
[39:04] not rather take wrong? Why you do not
[39:07] rather suffer yourselves to be
[39:08] defrauded? Nay you do wrong and defraud
[39:11] and that your brethren
[39:13] it's like you know God's way is turn the
[39:15] cheek
[39:18] &gt;&gt; go the second mile
[39:20] uh except it take you know brother says
[39:22] it takes a bigger man to get underneath
[39:23] the little man
[39:25] you you you sometimes you you just have
[39:28] to humble yourself and and let the other
[39:32] person have his win
[39:35] &gt;&gt; right not go before you know somebody
[39:39] and try to prove who's right and wrong.
[39:40] You don't need the world to do that.
[39:44] And and so there's a carnality when you
[39:46] got to prove you're right. There's a
[39:49] real carnality in that.
[39:52] We don't go down into Egypt for help.
[39:57] We don't get advice from worldly people.
[40:00] We don't get our counsel from worldly
[40:02] people.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; We don't get help from the world. Our
[40:05] help cometh from the Lord.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Our counsel comes from the word of God.
[40:12] Our advice comes from the scriptures.
[40:14] Our help comes from believing the word
[40:17] of God is our road map in this life and
[40:20] in how to get to heaven in both our
[40:23] affairs of this world, our work, our our
[40:26] home issues. Our advice comes from the
[40:28] word of God and how to get to heaven.
[40:31] It's our road map. This Bible is our
[40:33] road map from here to heaven.
[40:36] 2 Timothy 3:16 says, "All scripture is
[40:40] given by the inspiration of God and is
[40:45] profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
[40:48] for correction, for instruction in
[40:50] righteousness, that we, the man of God,
[40:53] may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[40:56] unto all good works." In other words,
[40:58] this Bible is not lacking one thing to
[41:01] get whatever our need would be in life.
[41:05] We have everything that we need. If
[41:07] there's a question, there's an answer in
[41:09] the Bible.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; We're not lacking a thing. God did not
[41:14] leave us lacking.
[41:16] Psalms 119:105 says, "Thy word is a lamp
[41:20] unto my feet and a light unto my path."
[41:24] We look to the word of God to give us
[41:27] light with our situation,
[41:29] to show us where to stand and how to how
[41:32] to be until God comes and takes care of
[41:35] things for us.
[41:38] Did you know
[41:40] God emphasizes the importance of his
[41:43] word
[41:45] 38 times in the book of Psalms 119?
[41:50] Not just this one verse, but 38 times
[41:53] he's emphasizing the importance is the
[41:56] word of God. The word of God. The word
[41:58] of God. And if we can just get that sunk
[42:00] into our minds, every time there's a
[42:02] problem, we go to the word of God and it
[42:04] becomes our lamp, our light.
[42:09] Too often, you know, we've learned to
[42:12] lean on our own ability, our own
[42:15] understanding,
[42:17] our own way of doing things. The And
[42:19] I'll say it like this. We're going down
[42:20] to Egypt for help. We're leaning. When
[42:23] you lean upon your yourself, you're
[42:26] going down to Egypt.
[42:28] And God brought us up out, right?
[42:32] We don't go down to Egypt for help. What
[42:34] we need is a revelation of where help
[42:36] comes from.
[42:38] We need a revelation of how to wait on
[42:40] the Lord in prayer until he does come.
[42:45] And and sometimes we may not have the
[42:48] exact answer what we need to do right
[42:50] away, but if we wait upon the Lord,
[42:53] we'll have strength
[42:55] &gt;&gt; to wait, right? To to to to trust in
[42:59] him. But here's the thing. God knows
[43:02] whether we trust him or not.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And when we trust God, then God can come
[43:07] and do a wonderful thing in our life.
[43:09] But if we don't trust him, it's
[43:11] impossible. We can't even please God.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Like you children know, you you children
[43:19] pay attention. I'm talking to you right
[43:20] now.
[43:22] You children know that when you have not
[43:25] done what you've been asked to do by
[43:27] your parents, the chances of you getting
[43:29] what you want is not very good.
[43:32] Your parents are going to come right
[43:34] back to you and say, "Did you do what I
[43:36] asked you to do?" Or, "Did you stop
[43:39] doing what I asked you to stop doing?"
[43:42] And when you can say, "Yes, I did."
[43:44] Well, then you got confidence. You can
[43:46] get that popsicle. You can go to Uncle
[43:49] Ray's or whatever it is. Some of you
[43:52] like Starbucks. I know that.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And when all your ways please the Lord,
[44:02] he'll make even the enemies to be at
[44:03] peace with you.
[44:06] But when we're I don't know where God's
[44:08] at. I don't know why this is I just
[44:09] don't know what's happening. God is not
[44:12] going to move on our behalf with that.
[44:16] So God wants us to trust him.
[44:19] And the word of God is our absolute for
[44:21] every single problem in our life. So I
[44:23] want you to just think about your life
[44:25] and your problems and the things that
[44:28] are are concerning to you. The things
[44:30] that maybe you've even thought this
[44:34] nobody understands what I'm going
[44:36] through. Nobody cares. Nobody can see.
[44:40] But in reality, God knows all about it.
[44:45] He's so involved in what's going on in
[44:47] your life.
[44:49] You You may not know the voice. You may
[44:51] not know what what what he wants you to
[44:53] do, but I am telling you, God is so
[44:56] involved in your life, but it's he's
[45:00] using everything that happens in your
[45:02] life to build a relationship with you.
[45:07] And the word of God is our absolute for
[45:10] every single problem in our life. Man
[45:11] shall not live by bread alone, but by
[45:13] every word that proceedth out of the
[45:15] mouth of God. God's word is the only
[45:18] thing that the believer uses to fix
[45:22] things.
[45:23] This is a strong statement, but we might
[45:26] as well just anchor it and say amen.
[45:28] Because if we learn to lean upon the
[45:31] word, then we don't care about people's
[45:33] advice. We don't look we don't look for
[45:36] other people. We don't try to get a
[45:38] third opinion, a fourth opinion, a fifth
[45:40] opinion. We don't need any more
[45:41] opinions. We got the word of God. It's
[45:43] the only thing we need.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; So I don't care if we got financial,
[45:49] marital, physical, spiritual, mental,
[45:53] relationships, headships,
[45:54] responsibilities, jobs. I don't care
[45:57] what problem we have. The word of God
[46:00] has an answer.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you can't pick up this book
[46:03] and find out that it says trusted tool
[46:06] or um uh
[46:10] the the name of the company that any of
[46:12] us have ever worked at. Don't have GM in
[46:15] here, does it, Brother Marty? It don't
[46:16] have Ford. Don't have Pratt Miller.
[46:21] But our situations in those companies
[46:23] has every problem that we've had in
[46:25] there of every relationship or every job
[46:27] pro everything. This word has an answer
[46:31] for that.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; And if we can get that sunk into our
[46:34] hearts and minds, then when we got
[46:36] problems in the home, we won't try to
[46:38] have to, you know, work it out with our
[46:40] flesh.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Just do what the word says.
[46:46] I I I mean, when look at the the
[46:49] tendency is when when your siblings are
[46:51] giving you some trouble and you spouses
[46:53] are giving one another trouble, the
[46:56] thing that you want to do is set things
[46:57] in order. Right? There's two ways to set
[47:00] things in order. There's the Egypt way
[47:04] and then there's the God's way.
[47:07] And the Egypt way is who do you think
[47:09] you're talking to?
[47:14] You are the one that started this. It's
[47:16] your fault. Don't be blaming me. And
[47:20] hears about it. She hears about it from
[47:22] her mom and dad
[47:25] the Egypt way. But God's way is a soft
[47:30] answer turns away wrath.
[47:33] Right? So we don't need to get
[47:34] somebody's opinion how to handle
[47:36] something. We just go to the word of
[47:38] God. The word of God says this is how
[47:40] you handle it.
[47:42] The problem is we think we in ourselves
[47:46] we so bad want our neighbor to stop
[47:48] doing that or we want our fellow
[47:50] employee or a family member to stop
[47:52] doing something
[47:54] and it may not happen. Did you know that
[47:58] &gt;&gt; it may not happen? As much as we want to
[48:01] change one another's character and
[48:03] makeup, it may never happen,
[48:07] but God can teach us how to deal with it
[48:11] &gt;&gt; and how to preserve us and how to keep
[48:13] us. And you know, literally, you could
[48:16] be in a home where you could grow into
[48:19] the statue of a perfect man and the
[48:21] person that you're married to is going
[48:22] down the tubes all at the same time.
[48:28] It's the truth. I mean, if Jesus said
[48:30] your own enemies be of your own
[48:32] household, I mean, I think he knows all
[48:34] about it. I'm just saying you don't have
[48:36] to have everything perfectly in order to
[48:38] do the right thing.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And to get problems worked out.
[48:43] But we just got to realize everybody's
[48:45] got a free more agency.
[48:47] And how many times have parents said
[48:49] this about your kids? We should all
[48:51] better raise our hand on this. Well,
[48:53] when you're 18 years old, you can do
[48:55] what you want to do.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Until then, you're under my roof doing
[49:03] my thing.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Why do we say that?
[49:09] Because you're under our free agency
[49:11] until then, right? You're paying the
[49:14] bills.
[49:15] But there comes a time that every person
[49:18] has to make their own decision.
[49:21] And this is the beauty of a parent that
[49:24] that a parent has a parent has to their
[49:27] to to their children are at that age
[49:29] where they want to lead to bring them up
[49:31] in the way they should go
[49:34] &gt;&gt; because after that you don't have that
[49:36] opportunity.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; It's gone. So it's a precious
[49:40] opportunity.
[49:41] Woe to them that go to Egypt for help
[49:45] and stand horses and trust in chariots
[49:48] because there's many and the horsemen
[49:50] because they are very strong.
[49:55] In other words, God doesn't want you to
[49:58] lean upon your arm of flesh.
[50:01] He doesn't want you to lean to your own
[50:02] understanding. He doesn't want you to
[50:05] trust in the worldly way of handling
[50:08] things.
[50:11] But look to the Lord and seek the Lord.
[50:15] Look, when there's a problem, it, you
[50:17] know, the scripture doesn't always come
[50:18] to us, you know, here's the answer.
[50:21] You know, it's not that easy.
[50:24] But, but what we do, what God wants us
[50:26] to do, he wants us to spend time praying
[50:29] and seeking the Lord.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's it. But we don't want to do that.
[50:33] We just want to fix it on our own.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; That to me is going down into Egypt for
[50:37] help.
[50:39] Don't stay on your horse of power.
[50:42] Don't trust in your chariot of safety.
[50:45] And don't rely on other people's
[50:47] opinions being real strong. So, you
[50:49] know, this is what five other people did
[50:51] in their home. Who cares?
[50:53] &gt;&gt; If the word of God says this, stay with
[50:56] it.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa. In other words, God is
[51:03] strongly against it.
[51:05] divine divine pronouncement of judgment
[51:09] and impending doom. You know, God is a
[51:13] jealous God
[51:15] and he just doesn't want to share his
[51:18] glory with the devil.
[51:21] If he's not first and your only choice
[51:23] for help, then the the answer is
[51:27] uh a divine judgment. Think about it.
[51:30] God God just gonna bring judgment upon a
[51:32] home who doesn't put God first.
[51:36] And we can just we should all just say
[51:37] amen to that so we can go on to the next
[51:39] thing because we're gonna say quiet. I'm
[51:40] going to say it over and over and you're
[51:42] going to say, "What's happening by
[51:43] brother John?"
[51:46] Turn with me if you would to Deuteronomy
[51:48] chapter 5.
[51:52] God is a jealous God. He doesn't want
[51:55] you to go anywhere for help except him.
[52:01] It it brings up a jealousy in God when
[52:04] we go to anywhere else for help.
[52:09] Deuteronomy 5:6 says, "I am the Lord thy
[52:13] God,
[52:15] which brought thee out of the land of
[52:17] Egypt from the house of bondage."
[52:22] So going back, he sh brought him out.
[52:26] Doesn't want him to go back for help.
[52:28] Thou shalt have none other gods before
[52:32] me. Thou shalt not make any graven image
[52:35] or any likeness of anything that is in
[52:37] heaven above, or the earth beneath, or
[52:40] that is in the waters beneath the earth.
[52:42] Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto
[52:44] them, nor serve them. For I am the Lord
[52:48] thy God. For I, the Lord thy God, am a
[52:53] jealous God,
[52:56] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[52:59] upon the children unto the third and
[53:02] fourth generations of them that hate me.
[53:10] Now there you understand with God there
[53:12] is no Switzerland.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; There's no I don't hate but I don't
[53:18] love. There's no in between
[53:21] there. There's you're either hot or
[53:24] cold.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; If there if there's a lukewarm, God puts
[53:29] you in a state of cold hate.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And so
[53:37] to to to hate God
[53:42] um
[53:45] is to not love the word.
[53:49] And to not love the word or look to the
[53:52] word for help,
[53:55] it means that you despise that. You're
[53:59] not careful enough to spend time in
[54:02] prayer seeking, desiring. Because look,
[54:05] we come we come to church to find out
[54:08] where we're at with God. But we also
[54:10] come to church to learn.
[54:13] and and God is is teaching us that he
[54:16] wants all of us here to rely on God
[54:19] more.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And and he he's our creator. We should
[54:26] rely on him.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; But the thing is because we don't know
[54:30] him, how do we rely on him?
[54:33] So what we do is we spend time in
[54:35] prayer. We spend time reading the Bible.
[54:37] We spend time God, God, help me to rely
[54:40] on you a little bit more tomorrow.
[54:42] That's how you grow is by making this
[54:45] thing real in your life.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; You you just can't,
[54:50] you know, wake up with some sort of um,
[54:56] you know, feeling that, oh, I know God.
[54:58] No, it's it's a development. If any of
[55:01] you, any of you except brother Bman
[55:05] because he used to work at Trusted Tool
[55:07] and Anne, take those two people out and
[55:11] any of you come and you you fill out a
[55:13] an application, you start working at
[55:15] Trusted Tool.
[55:17] You just can't walk in there and say,
[55:19] "Well, I know Brother John. I know you
[55:20] know what he wants me to do."
[55:23] You don't even know how we do things
[55:25] there. I've never taught you how to we
[55:26] do things there.
[55:28] You don't know the right way or the
[55:29] wrong way of doing things. So,
[55:33] and you you you don't want to go back
[55:36] home
[55:37] or ask somebody off the street for help,
[55:42] right? You you want to get to the
[55:44] source.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; You you could ask somebody inside the
[55:48] shop, right? Like a five-fold ministry
[55:50] for the perfecting of the saints.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. for help.
[55:55] But but but you you you you don't just
[55:57] go back somewhere else, ask them their
[55:59] opinion about your situation. You don't
[56:02] need to do that.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; You got the word of God. You've been
[56:05] you've been introduced to the word. And
[56:07] if you don't know what to do, simply get
[56:09] on your knees and say, "God, I don't
[56:10] know what to do.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; I do that all the time.
[56:15] I don't know what to do. God, show me
[56:17] what to do."
[56:20] And so it is so bad that
[56:24] God is a jealous God and and if you make
[56:26] him jealous and you can do that by
[56:28] simply not trusting him
[56:31] that the scripture says that he's going
[56:32] to visit the iniquity
[56:35] for three or four generations.
[56:38] Think about that. We probably suffer a
[56:41] little bit from what happened in our
[56:42] past.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; You you understand what I'm saying?
[56:47] And we got to be careful about our
[56:49] behavior because it's going to affect
[56:50] our children.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; And this is just God's law. We don't
[56:55] have nothing to do with it. It's just
[56:56] the word of God.
[56:59] It's verse 10.
[57:01] And showing mercy unto thousands of them
[57:05] that love me and keep my commandments.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Well, the commandment is that we trust
[57:12] in God and not go down to Egypt for
[57:14] help.
[57:16] And if we do that, he's going to show
[57:18] mercy.
[57:22] I love the word Psalms 37. Psalms 37.
[57:32] You know, I have a revelation that it
[57:33] doesn't matter if I got one page of note
[57:35] or 12. We never get done.
[57:38] It's just a solid revelation. God always
[57:41] works it out that way.
[57:45] Psalms 37 starting with verse number 23.
[57:49] The steps of a good man, they are
[57:52] ordered by the Lord and he delightth in
[57:56] his way.
[57:59] Though he fall, he shall not be utterly
[58:03] cast down.
[58:05] For the Lord upholdeth him with his
[58:08] hand.
[58:10] And I've been young.
[58:12] Now I'm molded.
[58:15] And yet have I not seen the righteous
[58:18] forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. So
[58:22] here David has this testimony. I was
[58:25] young in the Lord when he chose me
[58:29] and I'm old now and I can tell you that
[58:32] God takes care of his children.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Now never doubt that.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Never doubt it.
[58:41] just testify of it. This is God and he's
[58:44] faithful.
[58:48] He is ever merciful and lendeth and his
[58:53] seed is blessed.
[58:56] So what do we do? We depart from evil
[59:00] and do good and dwell ever more. So what
[59:03] is evil? Evil is simply leaning to your
[59:06] own understanding.
[59:08] That's how strong evil is. Evil is
[59:10] leaning to your own understanding. For
[59:12] the Lord loveth judgment, forsaketh not
[59:14] his saints. They are preserved forever,
[59:17] but the seed of the wicked shall be cut
[59:20] off.
[59:22] God ordains our footsteps.
[59:27] All things work together for the good to
[59:30] them that love the Lord and are the
[59:33] called according to his purpose.
[59:36] So it doesn't matter if
[59:40] how bad a situation is, it doesn't alter
[59:44] the word of God. God's word still
[59:47] remains true.
[59:49] Uh we're going to get into this, but
[59:52] it's during our trials that we must
[59:54] learn to look to Jesus for help.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; And it's the hardest time to do it.
[1:00:01] We're more tempted to lean to our own
[1:00:02] understanding during those times.
[1:00:05] But God uses our life's issues to draw
[1:00:08] us closer to him.
[1:00:11] Everything that's going on in life, you
[1:00:12] could write a list of everything that's
[1:00:14] going going on in your life. What's
[1:00:16] wrong, what you like to see changed, I
[1:00:18] don't care if it's job, finances,
[1:00:20] relationships, I don't care what it is,
[1:00:22] but God is definitely using that
[1:00:24] situation to draw you closer to him.
[1:00:27] Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; God wants
[1:00:33] to use the life issues to build his
[1:00:36] character in our lives.
[1:00:38] The scripture says to build his house
[1:00:41] whose house we are if we hold fast the
[1:00:44] confidence and the rejoicing of hope
[1:00:46] firm to the end. As soon as we let go,
[1:00:51] then God says, "Okay, you called it."
[1:00:58] And and all I'm trying to do if I'm I'm
[1:01:02] not talking about making a mistake and
[1:01:03] falling. I'm not talking about that. I'm
[1:01:06] talking when you make a decision that I
[1:01:08] am just not going to trust God. I'm not
[1:01:10] going to hold the beginning confidence
[1:01:12] anymore. I'm just going to go do my own
[1:01:14] thing. God says, "If that's what you
[1:01:16] want, go ahead." You understand
[1:01:18] everybody that's going to hell is
[1:01:19] because they made a choice to go there.
[1:01:21] They made a choice not to make heaven
[1:01:23] their home.
[1:01:25] And he doesn't force anybody to heaven
[1:01:27] and hell. They're all choices. He's just
[1:01:30] the judgment of the choices they made.
[1:01:32] Because many will come to me in that
[1:01:33] days. Lord, what about this? And I want
[1:01:35] to do this and I should be going here
[1:01:36] and what about this and what about all
[1:01:38] this? And then God's got to show them
[1:01:40] their motives. And you know what I'm
[1:01:41] talking about.
[1:01:43] But I'll say this that God doesn't waste
[1:01:46] our test and our trials.
[1:01:49] He doesn't waste our persecutions and
[1:01:51] our rejections. He doesn't waste our
[1:01:53] sicknesses and our afflictions.
[1:01:56] God uses all of our life's issues to
[1:01:59] build our relationship with him.
[1:02:03] He doesn't waste one experience.
[1:02:07] I really want to emphasize this because
[1:02:08] God is more in your life than you
[1:02:10] realize.
[1:02:13] We think something's wrong when things
[1:02:15] are wrong.
[1:02:19] No, I believe that God is using that to
[1:02:22] to to help us.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:02:27] if he puts Dennis through the same trial
[1:02:29] that he puts me or Brother Ron, the same
[1:02:33] trial, he may be dealing with different
[1:02:35] things in all three of our lives,
[1:02:38] but the same trial.
[1:02:40] So, the trial doesn't really say what's
[1:02:44] happening in your life,
[1:02:46] but it gets your attention
[1:02:49] to where you look to God and you lean on
[1:02:53] him for your situation.
[1:03:00] That's why we're told in the Bible, 1
[1:03:03] Peter 4:12, I'll just quote it. Think it
[1:03:06] not strange concerning the fiery trials
[1:03:09] which is to try you as though some
[1:03:12] strange thing has happened unto you.
[1:03:17] In other words, God knows all about it.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; He's the one that allowed it.
[1:03:25] But rejoice. The Bible says, "In as much
[1:03:27] as you are partakers of Christ's
[1:03:30] suffering,
[1:03:32] that when his glory shall be revealed,
[1:03:34] you may be glad also with exceeding
[1:03:36] joy."
[1:03:39] And James said in First James, verse
[1:03:43] two,
[1:03:44] First James, James chapter 1, you know
[1:03:48] what I mean? There's no First James.
[1:03:50] There's the one and only James. That's
[1:03:52] right.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Well, in the Bible, there was James the
[1:03:56] lesser and James the greater. All right.
[1:03:58] James 1:2 says, "My brethren, count it
[1:04:01] all joy when you fall into diverse
[1:04:04] temptations.
[1:04:06] Knowing this that the trying of your
[1:04:08] faith it works patience." So, we see
[1:04:11] here that, you know, just with the just
[1:04:13] with the mere fact of trials, God
[1:04:16] doesn't waste our trials.
[1:04:18] Like when we go through a a hardship,
[1:04:21] the first thing that we want is that
[1:04:23] thing out of our life. Just resolve it.
[1:04:26] Get it done. What's the quickest way to
[1:04:28] fix this thing? I want it out.
[1:04:31] And God says, "That's not how I'm
[1:04:34] building my character in you."
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; No, we're we're going to get deeper into
[1:04:38] this thing. We're going to pull out some
[1:04:40] things in your life that I don't want to
[1:04:41] see there,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; and I want to make you more like me.
[1:04:45] Yeah.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And so now to get to this, the quicker
[1:04:49] we get serious with God, the quicker we
[1:04:52] can learn.
[1:04:54] But the more we keep
[1:04:57] diverting
[1:04:59] past kicking the bucket down the road,
[1:05:02] passing the buck, however you want to
[1:05:03] word it, then we don't grow up and we
[1:05:06] don't learn. And we still have That's
[1:05:08] why you've got people that are 20, 30,
[1:05:10] 40, 50, 60 years old that have never
[1:05:13] learned.
[1:05:16] Because you don't mature with age.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; You mature with having the right
[1:05:20] attitude.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's how you mature. That's how you
[1:05:24] grow up is by learning to have the right
[1:05:26] attitude about things.
[1:05:34] It's better to know.
[1:05:36] Did you know it's better to know why
[1:05:38] you're sick than to get healed?
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon sent the message, be
[1:05:42] certain of God. Maybe that's the way it
[1:05:44] is with you tonight. You don't know just
[1:05:47] why you're sick. You don't you don't you
[1:05:51] don't know just why or what it's all
[1:05:54] about. But maybe it's a blessing in
[1:05:57] disguise.
[1:06:00] In other words, when we're sick, we just
[1:06:02] want to get healed.
[1:06:05] Rightly so. When we're hurting, we want
[1:06:07] the pain to leave. But I'm just saying
[1:06:10] God doesn't
[1:06:12] he doesn't um our trials are not
[1:06:15] separate from God. Our sicknesses are
[1:06:17] not separate from God. God's involved in
[1:06:20] all of it.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; And God is wanting to bless us in all of
[1:06:25] it.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; But we've got to have the right attitude
[1:06:28] in it.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said the right
[1:06:31] mental attitude towards any divine
[1:06:33] promise of God will bring it to pass.
[1:06:36] But the wrong attitude, you're it's
[1:06:38] you're just going to get on the wrong
[1:06:39] side of God.
[1:06:42] So God doesn't waste our trials or test
[1:06:44] or anything that's happening in our
[1:06:46] life.
[1:06:48] Isn't that comfort to know that God is
[1:06:50] with us?
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It really is. He uses everything that is
[1:06:55] happening in our lives for something.
[1:06:59] And when we love him enough, I'll say
[1:07:01] according to fulfill his purpose in
[1:07:04] life, then we can have confidence that
[1:07:06] that trial is working out for our good.
[1:07:09] Our sickness is working out for our
[1:07:11] good. Somehow it's going to be a
[1:07:14] blessing.
[1:07:17] So, I can't stress enough that God is
[1:07:20] using our current life issues to build
[1:07:24] his character in us
[1:07:27] so we can have the character for him to
[1:07:30] dwell in. Because did you know our
[1:07:32] character is what his house is going to
[1:07:35] what what house he's going to live in is
[1:07:37] our character.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; And character is built in in the trials.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; We want to deal with the trials. And God
[1:07:45] says, "No, you need the trials or I'm
[1:07:46] not going to live in you." I I just I
[1:07:49] just love the word of God. Brother Bam
[1:07:51] said, "Character is the only thing that
[1:07:53] we're taking with us when we leave
[1:07:54] here."
[1:07:56] That's our house.
[1:07:58] That becomes his house. Our house
[1:08:00] becomes his house. Character, he said,
[1:08:03] character is molded in the fiery furnace
[1:08:06] of trials. So, when we're in the middle
[1:08:09] of a trial, there's something, if I
[1:08:11] could say it like this,
[1:08:13] um, I don't like to use the word magic,
[1:08:17] but something supernatural is happening
[1:08:20] in the middle of our trials.
[1:08:23] And that is the there's the switch is
[1:08:25] right there. Right there. It's ready to
[1:08:29] either give you character or you're
[1:08:31] going to fall back in fear. There's the
[1:08:34] switch right there. And you know who
[1:08:35] determines that switch is you.
[1:08:40] Because when the fire and you think
[1:08:42] about the the the three Hebrew children
[1:08:43] when they went into the furnace,
[1:08:47] there was a switch there. The switch is
[1:08:50] you don't have to go on that trial, but
[1:08:51] bow
[1:08:54] and they said, "No, no, we're going. We
[1:08:57] don't know what's going to happen when
[1:08:59] we walk into this trial. I don't know.
[1:09:01] But I know one thing. I'm not bound
[1:09:02] before any other image.
[1:09:04] I'm going to keep God first.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And when they did, it was their faith
[1:09:11] that brought the fourth man
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; in the furnace. Their faith where the
[1:09:17] other men,
[1:09:19] they burned to death. That threw him in.
[1:09:22] So just think about it. Your attitude
[1:09:24] about your trial is going to determine
[1:09:26] whether God meets you in the trial or
[1:09:27] not.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Problems persist all around us.
[1:09:34] We're either going in a trial, coming
[1:09:37] out of a trial, or we're in a trial.
[1:09:42] Trials are always they're here to stay.
[1:09:45] I told my son that. I said, "Trials are
[1:09:47] here to stay. It doesn't matter what you
[1:09:49] do, what job you do, where you go, who
[1:09:51] you talk to, who your friends are, who
[1:09:53] you marry. It doesn't matter. Trials are
[1:09:55] here to stay.
[1:09:57] And the more children you have, the more
[1:09:58] trials you have."
[1:10:02] and and we're staring at blessed is he
[1:10:04] whose quiver is full, but we still got
[1:10:06] all these trials.
[1:10:11] Sometimes
[1:10:14] times are harder than others.
[1:10:18] Sometimes there's more trials than other
[1:10:20] times.
[1:10:22] But God wants us to look to him.
[1:10:25] That's the bottom line.
[1:10:28] Now, we know David, King David, he was a
[1:10:31] man after God's own heart. But I'll say
[1:10:33] it like this. He probably had more
[1:10:35] trials than most people.
[1:10:38] He was a king. He had more trials than
[1:10:42] most people. Yet, he was a man after
[1:10:44] God's own heart.
[1:10:46] So, think about it.
[1:10:48] He learned to lean upon God. He learned
[1:10:51] to look alone to God for help.
[1:10:55] So it wasn't because he had a few trials
[1:10:57] or he was a king because I think he went
[1:11:00] through more suffering than most people.
[1:11:05] All the psalms that he wrote just
[1:11:07] depicted on everything that he dealt
[1:11:09] with in his feelings and his emotions.
[1:11:13] Look at Psalms 27 verse1.
[1:11:19] David said, "The Lord is my light and my
[1:11:22] salvation.
[1:11:24] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[1:11:28] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[1:11:31] afraid?
[1:11:34] So in other words, in this first verse,
[1:11:36] we see that David made a decision
[1:11:41] to look to the Lord for his help,
[1:11:44] for his light, for his salvation, for
[1:11:47] his strength.
[1:11:49] How many times do we wish we had more
[1:11:50] strength? I'll tell you, I get up in the
[1:11:51] morning and I walk from the bed to the
[1:11:54] bathroom and I think, I wish I had more
[1:11:57] strength. Like, maybe I should lay here
[1:12:00] a little bit. Maybe I should sleep a
[1:12:01] little bit longer before I get up. We
[1:12:03] all could use a little bit more
[1:12:04] strength.
[1:12:06] But our strength and help comes from
[1:12:09] God. When the wicked, even my enemies
[1:12:12] and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
[1:12:14] flesh, they stumbled and fell.
[1:12:18] Though a host, not just uh my enemies,
[1:12:21] but if a whole host should encamp
[1:12:24] against me,
[1:12:26] my heart is not going to fear.
[1:12:29] Even if war would come up against me,
[1:12:33] the nation should come up and rise up
[1:12:35] against me. In this will I be confident.
[1:12:42] Confidence.
[1:12:44] And then he says one thing. This is the
[1:12:47] the one thing that I've desired of the
[1:12:50] Lord and that will I seek after that I
[1:12:55] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:12:57] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:12:59] of the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:13:02] temple.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Answers come from God.
[1:13:08] We have to do the seeking.
[1:13:12] We have to do the dwelling.
[1:13:15] We have to do the calling upon God,
[1:13:20] but we don't go back to Egypt to
[1:13:22] inquire.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; We look to the word of God. We we we
[1:13:28] come with an expectation that God is
[1:13:31] going to lead me and help me.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Just the one thing that he desired.
[1:13:40] That's why I'll tell you what, you can
[1:13:42] get rid of every book in the whole
[1:13:43] world, but don't get rid of the Bible.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that'll lead man. I'll
[1:13:49] tell you, if we got rid of all the other
[1:13:50] books and put the Bible back in the
[1:13:52] schools, we'd have better better kids.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; But then we'd have to get teachers that
[1:13:58] believed it
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; and a school board that believed it.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; But it would help. Verse five. For in
[1:14:08] the time of trouble, God shall hide me
[1:14:12] in his pavilion.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; In the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:14:17] hide me, and he shall set me up upon a
[1:14:21] rock.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And now shall my head be lifted up.
[1:14:25] Above my enemies, round about me.
[1:14:27] Therefore, I will offer in his
[1:14:29] tabernacle sacrifices of joy, and I will
[1:14:33] sing. Yay, I will sing praises unto the
[1:14:35] Lord.
[1:14:37] here, O Lord, when I cry with my voice.
[1:14:40] Have mercy also upon me and answer me.
[1:14:44] See, he's still looking for help.
[1:14:47] But he's he's coming to God. He knows
[1:14:49] where his help's coming from. When you
[1:14:51] said, Lord, seek ye my face. My heart
[1:14:55] said within me, your face, Lord, what I
[1:14:58] seek.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; You don't got to tell me twice.
[1:15:03] Hide not thy face far from me. Put not
[1:15:06] thy servant away in anger. Thou has been
[1:15:10] my help. I love that. What a testimony.
[1:15:13] Thou has been my help. Leave me not,
[1:15:16] neither forsake me, oh God of my
[1:15:19] salvation. David did not go down to
[1:15:22] Egypt for help.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't he didn't look to other people
[1:15:28] for help.
[1:15:30] He looked to the Lord.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; What an example. What a mentor for all
[1:15:34] of us. And I like I said, he had more
[1:15:37] trials than we going through.
[1:15:40] When my father and my mother forsake me,
[1:15:44] then the Lord will take me up.
[1:15:47] I'm glad that God did not leave us
[1:15:50] without
[1:15:52] uh alone when not only our mother, our
[1:15:56] father, but our our friends.
[1:16:00] You know, sometimes I I I remember when
[1:16:02] I came to the Lord, you were alone. You
[1:16:05] had to make a decision. This is between
[1:16:07] you and God.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; The Lord will take you up. Teach me thy
[1:16:14] way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path
[1:16:18] because of my enemies.
[1:16:20] Deliver me not over unto the will of my
[1:16:24] enemies. for false witnesses are even
[1:16:27] risen up against me. And they breathe
[1:16:29] out such cruelty.
[1:16:32] I had fainted, would have fainted unless
[1:16:35] I had believed to see the goodness of
[1:16:37] the Lord in the land of the living.
[1:16:41] We're going to trust that the Lord's
[1:16:42] going to help us, right?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people are fainting.
[1:16:45] They're backsliding. They're going back
[1:16:46] in the world. They stop coming to church
[1:16:48] because they didn't stay with the Lord.
[1:16:52] They lean to their own understanding.
[1:16:54] Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage and
[1:16:56] he shall strengthen thy heart. Wait, I
[1:16:59] say on the Lord.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Psalms 121
[1:17:06] uh is is part of uh the song of decrees
[1:17:12] and that's were 15 songs that they
[1:17:16] worshiped and sung as they walked up the
[1:17:19] hill to Jerusalem.
[1:17:23] And so this is one of them as they're
[1:17:25] walking up the hill to Jerusalem, the
[1:17:27] hills of Jerusalem. Psalms 121 verse1
[1:17:30] says,"I will lift up my eyes unto the
[1:17:33] hills from whence cometh my help. My
[1:17:37] help cometh from the Lord which made
[1:17:39] heaven and earth." And I'll tell you, I
[1:17:41] think that's a good song to sing. And
[1:17:44] and and just just get your own melody to
[1:17:47] it,
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; but sing it every day. And and before
[1:17:50] you know it, you inside of you, you'll
[1:17:52] be looking to the word of God more for
[1:17:54] your strength. Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; When we got a revelation of where our
[1:17:59] source of help comes from, then we don't
[1:18:01] need to really look to anybody else
[1:18:02] anymore. We don't need to lean to the
[1:18:04] arm of flesh anymore. We don't need to
[1:18:06] lean to our own understanding anymore.
[1:18:08] There's a big difference between being
[1:18:11] carnal and spiritual. When you look to
[1:18:13] the Lord, that's spiritual.
[1:18:17] When you don't look to the Lord, that's
[1:18:18] carnal. I hate to say that's a pretty um
[1:18:23] down south uh uh definition of of being
[1:18:27] spiritual. Brother B says, "You want to
[1:18:29] be more spiritual? Read your Bible and
[1:18:31] pray. Look to the Lord."
[1:18:35] you you you you you don't want to look
[1:18:37] to the Lord, but you you want to, you
[1:18:39] know, get knowledge on your own. It's
[1:18:41] only going to puff you up.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; So, our help cometh from the Lord.
[1:18:47] Praise God. Proverbs chapter 3. We can't
[1:18:51] do us a message like this without
[1:18:53] getting into Proverbs 3. Proverbs 3 is
[1:18:56] about putting the word first in order
[1:18:58] for the word to actually guide us and
[1:19:01] bless us. Because in our trials, we want
[1:19:04] help. We want guidance. We want God to
[1:19:07] show us what to do. Well, to me,
[1:19:10] Proverbs 3
[1:19:12] tells us to put the word of God first so
[1:19:14] that can happen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; But if we don't put the word first in
[1:19:18] our human life, then the word won't be
[1:19:22] able to do its job.
[1:19:25] Remember, he gives grace to the humble.
[1:19:28] All right. Proverbs 3 verse one. My son,
[1:19:31] forget not my law, but let thy heart
[1:19:34] keep my commandments. So right there,
[1:19:36] verse one puts a the word of God needs
[1:19:38] to be first in your life.
[1:19:41] Verse two, for it will give you length
[1:19:45] of days, long life. It'll give you peace
[1:19:48] in your mind. They shall add to thee.
[1:19:53] So what is the keeping of the law and
[1:19:55] the commandments have anything to do
[1:19:56] with long life peace?
[1:19:59] Because God is in control.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; He's the one that says, "Demons, get out
[1:20:04] of there."
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He's the one that says, "Sickness, get
[1:20:08] out of there. Long life." God is in
[1:20:11] control.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; And the first thing we have to do and
[1:20:14] the only thing we have to do is put the
[1:20:16] word of God first.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Verse three, let not mercy and truth
[1:20:23] forsake thee.
[1:20:25] bind them about thy neck and write them
[1:20:28] upon the tables of thy heart. So we just
[1:20:30] understand this.
[1:20:32] Everybody wants mercy in their life.
[1:20:35] There's never a time you say, "I don't
[1:20:37] want mercy."
[1:20:39] So this mercy that's supposed to be
[1:20:41] bound around your neck, it's not for
[1:20:43] you. It's for the other people you deal
[1:20:45] with.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And so it is truth.
[1:20:51] You know, a lot of people try to go
[1:20:53] through life without the truth.
[1:20:57] In other words, they just
[1:21:02] truth is coming to church and truth is
[1:21:04] what they say and believe, but it may
[1:21:07] not have anything to do with the word of
[1:21:10] God.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; It it's it's their opinions. Right.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Right. How many times did did my dad
[1:21:17] say, "I'm the boss."
[1:21:22] He'd be smoking a cigarette and say,
[1:21:23] "Don't don't smoke. Don't smoke when you
[1:21:25] get older."
[1:21:28] What What is that? It's you're forsaking
[1:21:31] the truth.
[1:21:34] And a lot of times people, they don't
[1:21:36] use the word.
[1:21:39] They don't bind that around their neck,
[1:21:42] but their opinion is what they got bound
[1:21:44] around their neck.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; And that becomes the truth.
[1:21:51] Write them upon the tables of thy heart.
[1:21:53] So shalt thou find favor and good
[1:21:56] understanding in the sight of God and
[1:21:59] man. God has a way of showing favor.
[1:22:03] Amen. Trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:22:08] heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:22:13] understanding. That's the hardest thing
[1:22:14] to do in Egypt. That's all we did.
[1:22:17] That's all we did. That's all I knew to
[1:22:19] do.
[1:22:21] And and you think about it. A child
[1:22:24] when it's um born, it learns very easy
[1:22:28] how to manipulate mom and dad.
[1:22:32] And you know, a a child's favorite
[1:22:34] thing, brother Marty, is to go over
[1:22:36] grandma and grandpa's house
[1:22:40] because they're already schooled to
[1:22:42] spoil those kids more than mom and dad.
[1:22:48] I'm just saying a child has learned from
[1:22:51] an early age to lean to his own
[1:22:52] understanding.
[1:22:54] He knows how to accomplish things and to
[1:22:56] get what they want.
[1:22:58] And a lot of times we do that. We go
[1:23:01] back into Egypt. I know how to fix this
[1:23:03] problem in this home. But we need to
[1:23:05] stay with the word of God.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Stay with the truth. Do things God's
[1:23:11] way, not the way that we think we need
[1:23:14] to do them because that's what gets all
[1:23:16] the trouble.
[1:23:18] This is a I'm going to tell you this
[1:23:20] word here that we're hearing. It's a
[1:23:22] beautiful word.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; It is a beautiful word.
[1:23:28] In all thy ways acknowledge God,
[1:23:33] and God shall direct your paths.
[1:23:36] Be not wise in your own eyes, but fear
[1:23:40] the Lord and depart from evil. And
[1:23:42] that's where I got that from. When you
[1:23:45] lean to your own understanding, you're
[1:23:46] wise in your own eyes. God caused that
[1:23:49] evil. And you got to depart from that
[1:23:51] way of thinking. But rather stay with
[1:23:53] the word, fear the Lord. It shall be
[1:23:56] health to thy navl, marorrow to thy
[1:23:58] bones.
[1:24:01] Honor the Lord. So this is all about
[1:24:03] putting the Lord first. Honor the Lord
[1:24:06] with thy substance, and the first fruit
[1:24:07] of all thine increase. So shall thy
[1:24:09] barns be filled with plenty, and thy
[1:24:11] precious shall burst out with new wine.
[1:24:13] My son, despise not the chastening of
[1:24:16] the Lord, neither be weary of his
[1:24:18] correction. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:24:21] correcteth. even as the father the son
[1:24:24] in whom he delightth.
[1:24:26] God has one thing in mind, building his
[1:24:29] home in us.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; So what is he going to do? He's going to
[1:24:33] be correcting us until we're out of
[1:24:35] here.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't stop when we're 60.
[1:24:41] I mean, that would be a great thing for
[1:24:43] the retirees, right?
[1:24:46] But in reality,
[1:24:49] we're we're here. We got to keep
[1:24:51] pressing on.
[1:24:53] Don't stop, you know. So,
[1:24:56] God is always going to be correcting us.
[1:24:58] Always. Always.
[1:25:01] That just shows that he loves us and
[1:25:04] that he's trying to build his house in
[1:25:05] us. God is on a mission to use every
[1:25:09] single thing that happens in our life to
[1:25:13] build his character in us so we can
[1:25:16] become more in of it in his image. Now
[1:25:19] when we begin to think like that, I
[1:25:21] believe we'll handle our trials the
[1:25:23] correct way.
[1:25:26] So that's why this is so important to
[1:25:27] learn to lean upon the Lord in our
[1:25:30] trials. Problems and trials are needed
[1:25:33] for our growth.
[1:25:35] Turn with me for our last scripture
[1:25:36] reading. It's going to be in Ephesians
[1:25:39] chapter 4.
[1:25:41] Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:25:46] And he gave some apostles, prophets,
[1:25:49] verse 11, evangelists, pastors, and
[1:25:51] teachers. Why did he give those to us?
[1:25:54] that we could be perfected
[1:25:58] and that there would be the the work of
[1:26:03] the ministry among us and that we would
[1:26:06] all be edified as a body of Christ. Now,
[1:26:09] that's why we have church right there.
[1:26:13] Now, here's the thing. I'm going to be
[1:26:15] honest with you.
[1:26:18] Church should not be separated from
[1:26:20] home.
[1:26:23] What we learn here is what we should
[1:26:25] take home.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And then we have a better home and then
[1:26:28] we bring a have a better church. That's
[1:26:31] how it happens. It grows.
[1:26:34] How long do we do this? Till we all come
[1:26:37] into the unity of the faith and of the
[1:26:41] knowledge of the son of God unto a
[1:26:44] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:26:47] statue of the fullness of Christ. In
[1:26:50] other words, our trials are not going
[1:26:52] away. He's going to use everything that
[1:26:54] that that happening in our life for a
[1:26:57] growing process. So, think about what's
[1:26:59] going on in your life now that you're
[1:27:00] not happy. No matter what it is, God is
[1:27:03] staring at you and saying, "I'm trying
[1:27:05] to build my house in you.
[1:27:08] Find me here in this trial."
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is,
[1:27:13] if you think about it, when things get
[1:27:16] real bad, you pray a little bit more.
[1:27:22] That's what God wants.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Okay? Till we henceforth that we
[1:27:28] henceforth be no more children
[1:27:31] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:27:35] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[1:27:36] men cunning craftiness whereby the lay
[1:27:38] to deceive. So, if you think about um
[1:27:43] you know, we just um
[1:27:47] my son had found some um something that
[1:27:50] just I don't know, somehow it just got
[1:27:53] uh blown in on our property,
[1:27:56] but you know, you've seen trash just
[1:27:58] kind of come out of of a trash can and
[1:28:01] lay there on the side of the road and it
[1:28:04] you've seen trash or stuff just blow by
[1:28:07] the wind.
[1:28:09] Well, when you're not established in
[1:28:10] Christ, trials will just, you know,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; you're just here, there, and everywhere.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; It isn't that you don't got an opinion.
[1:28:17] You just don't got a solid foundation of
[1:28:19] what to do with with your situation.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And the the five-fold ministry is to
[1:28:24] help us become strong,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; become uh our eyes are fixed on the word
[1:28:33] of God. David David said, "My eye, my
[1:28:35] heart is fixed."
[1:28:37] And um our our our eyes are like flint.
[1:28:39] We're just our we're just rock solid
[1:28:42] looking to the word for all of our
[1:28:44] problems.
[1:28:45] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:28:49] up into him in all things which is the
[1:28:53] head even Christ
[1:28:56] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:28:59] together and compacted by that which
[1:29:01] every joint supplieth according to the
[1:29:03] effectual working in the measure of
[1:29:05] every part that increasth of every of
[1:29:09] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:29:11] of itself in love. That is, you know,
[1:29:13] that's got to be the one of the most
[1:29:15] complex verses in the Bible. There's so
[1:29:17] much there. Let me just say this.
[1:29:21] I've told you here that I have um a a a
[1:29:24] bad muscle or ligament or something
[1:29:26] here, and I don't know exactly what it
[1:29:28] is, but I know it's enough where I can't
[1:29:30] just, you know, do this with this arm.
[1:29:34] Now, that little muscle and tendon,
[1:29:38] a ligament, whatever is messed up there,
[1:29:43] it's keeping me from being able to
[1:29:45] function and help the rest of my
[1:29:49] my body to do what it needs to do. In
[1:29:52] other words, I can't rely on this arm to
[1:29:54] do as much work as this arm can do. So,
[1:29:57] I have to carry everything like this.
[1:29:59] The thing I'm trying to say to you is
[1:30:01] you all play a part. We all play a part
[1:30:04] in the body and your part is just as
[1:30:07] important because I can guarantee you
[1:30:10] all these muscles around here, they're
[1:30:12] like 20 times as strong and big as that
[1:30:15] one. But that one is it's holding up the
[1:30:18] whole boat.
[1:30:20] And we as a body of believers, we need
[1:30:24] to get stronger for the body, for the
[1:30:27] family,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; for Christ,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; so we can actually give to what's needed
[1:30:32] for the rest of the body because this is
[1:30:35] given it because this is in the
[1:30:37] situation that it is. I can't do what
[1:30:40] all that needs to be done.
[1:30:44] And so I got to take care of that
[1:30:45] problem. And that's what I'm doing. And
[1:30:46] it's hard work. I'm telling you, therapy
[1:30:48] three times a week and I'm barely
[1:30:50] getting anywhere. I think the I took a
[1:30:52] survey the last time I did it, it was at
[1:30:54] 38. The survey I did it before was maybe
[1:30:58] two weeks ago and it was at 36. And I'm
[1:31:01] I'm telling you, I'm growing slow
[1:31:04] and it's hard work, but I'm doing the
[1:31:06] right thing.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's going to get me where
[1:31:10] I got to get to because that's my
[1:31:11] confidence. And so we just need to to
[1:31:14] grow, continue to grow, grow in our
[1:31:16] personal lives so we can have a a
[1:31:18] stronger church. Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I know time's up, but
[1:31:22] can you do one more quote?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I just want to say this. Anytime that
[1:31:27] you take the ores out of the water,
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; you're going backwards. Brother Ram
[1:31:32] said,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; "That's right.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Not your desire to go back in the
[1:31:35] world." That's not what he's saying.
[1:31:37] He's saying if you're not willing to
[1:31:39] fight against the current that's trying
[1:31:41] to pull you into the world,
[1:31:44] then the the world is going to
[1:31:45] automatically pull you there.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Just like when the on on the ground
[1:31:50] where you had um a heart that had the
[1:31:54] things of the world and the things of of
[1:31:56] the word of God, they were both in
[1:31:58] there. What happened? The world choked
[1:32:02] out the word.
[1:32:04] It it's just the only way that you win
[1:32:07] with the word is you become one with the
[1:32:09] word
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; and then you're you're an overcomer. So
[1:32:13] you got to keep roaring oring against
[1:32:16] the current or else you're going to
[1:32:19] backslide. You just can't stop
[1:32:20] believing. Brother Bam said in the
[1:32:22] message the intervail, he says, "I'd
[1:32:24] like to see how many of those Nazarines
[1:32:26] that got sanctified one year and the
[1:32:28] next year was back sanctified again.
[1:32:33] I thought he kept it. I thought he c he
[1:32:36] couldn't go back.
[1:32:39] Oh, brother. Some men so narrow-minded
[1:32:42] you you put a pencil between their eyes,
[1:32:45] it had blind them. That's right. So
[1:32:48] narrowsighted. Sure. Salvation last as
[1:32:52] long as faith last.
[1:32:58] Now I know this really goes against once
[1:33:00] saved always saved. And I do believe
[1:33:02] you're sealed to the day of redemption.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; You don't get sealed.
[1:33:08] Your faith for salvation only lasts as
[1:33:11] long as you believe. That's why the
[1:33:12] Bible says today is the day of
[1:33:14] salvation. Not back then when you got
[1:33:16] saved, but every day you have to
[1:33:19] believe.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And divine healing lasts as long as your
[1:33:24] faith lasts. Oh, I love that.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; You got to believe for divine healing
[1:33:29] every day. That's why brother Brandham
[1:33:30] taught like this. Keep testifying.
[1:33:33] Keep testifying. Keep believing. Keep
[1:33:36] holding to because that is what will
[1:33:39] bring it to pass.
[1:33:42] He says you that's got to experience 40
[1:33:46] years ago. Forget you ever had that
[1:33:48] experience and go out here tonight and
[1:33:50] say I don't even believe it and I'm not
[1:33:53] God's servant no more.
[1:33:56] Watch how long your experience lasts.
[1:33:59] Certainly.
[1:34:01] So what brother Brandham is saying here
[1:34:03] is you got to maintain your testimony.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; He says when the unclean spirit's gone
[1:34:08] out of a man, he walks in dry places. He
[1:34:11] comes back with seven other spirits
[1:34:13] worse than he was. He enters in by
[1:34:16] force. Notice that he enters in by
[1:34:19] force. If the good man of the house
[1:34:21] ain't there to keep him out, get out of
[1:34:23] here. You're not allowed to do that. He
[1:34:26] says, you don't go by your feelings.
[1:34:28] I never was saved by my feelings.
[1:34:31] I wasn't saved because I felt good.
[1:34:35] I'm saved because I met God's promise.
[1:34:40] That's right. The devil can beat you
[1:34:42] around and stump on your feelings, but
[1:34:45] he can't take he can't speak on thus
[1:34:49] sayeth the Lord and condemn it.
[1:34:52] I've done what Jesus said. I'm saved
[1:34:54] tonight because I've met God's
[1:34:55] requirement. I'm healed tonight. So,
[1:34:58] I'll just say it like this. In the
[1:35:00] middle of your trials, have faith that
[1:35:02] God is with you
[1:35:05] and stand with a good attitude and God
[1:35:09] will see you through and teach you more
[1:35:10] and grow you more because now here's the
[1:35:12] thing. You're interested in getting rid
[1:35:13] of the trial. We're all interested in
[1:35:16] get rid of the trial. God is interested
[1:35:19] in building character.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; There's two different scenarios going
[1:35:22] on. So the more you can get on the side
[1:35:24] with God, the more that you can grow in
[1:35:26] Christ. Amen. Let's stand together. God
[1:35:28] bless you.
[1:35:31] God bless you for your patience. I hope
[1:35:33] this was somewhat
[1:35:36] of a blessing or an encouragement to
[1:35:38] help you see that God is is with you.
[1:35:45] I believe he is.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that little chorus. He's all
[1:35:50] I need. He's
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:36:00] all
[1:36:02] I need.
[1:36:04] He's all I need.
[1:36:09] Jesus
[1:36:11] is all I need.
[1:36:16] He's all I need.
[1:36:20] He's all I need.
[1:36:25] Jesus
[1:36:26] is all I need.
[1:36:32] He's all I need.
[1:36:36] He's all I need.
[1:36:40] Jesus
[1:36:42] is all I need.
[1:36:47] He's all I need.
[1:36:51] He's all I need.
[1:36:56] Jesus
[1:36:57] is all I need. One more time.
[1:37:03] He's all I need. He's all I need.
[1:37:11] Jesus
[1:37:13] is all I need.
[1:37:18] He's all I need.
[1:37:22] He's all I need.
[1:37:26] Jesus is all I need.
[1:37:33] It is no secret. Amen.
[1:37:43] It's no secret.
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:50] What God can do.
[1:37:56] What he's done for others,
[1:38:01] he'll do for you.
[1:38:06] With arms wide open,
[1:38:11] he'll pardon you.
[1:38:16] It is no secret
[1:38:20] what God can do.
[1:38:26] It is no secret
[1:38:30] what God can do.
[1:38:35] What he's done for others,
[1:38:40] he'll do for you.
[1:38:45] With arms wide open,
[1:38:50] he'll pardon you.
[1:38:55] It is no secret
[1:39:00] what God can
