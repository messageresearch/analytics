[31:47] hallelujah what a
[31:49] what that's the hour that we're looking
[31:52] forward to
[31:54] never have to come back to these
[31:55] pestilence
[31:57] amen god bless you what a wonderful
[32:00] worship service
[32:02] amen
[32:03] it sounds like
[32:05] you brought
[32:06] praise with you
[32:08] the sacrifice of praise sometimes
[32:11] it's a sacrifice you don't feel like it
[32:14] but
[32:15] it's like the
[32:17] it's like the sun is always shining just
[32:19] sometimes the clouds are in the way and
[32:20] you can't see it
[32:22] god is always worthy of praise just
[32:24] sometimes we don't feel like it
[32:26] but he's still worthy of the same praise
[32:29] amen
[32:31] um
[32:33] turn with me if you would into the book
[32:34] of
[32:35] proverbs chapter 29 we're gonna have two
[32:38] scripture readings
[32:40] uh we're certainly
[32:42] missing um part of our our church and
[32:46] i'm so thankful for the live stream that
[32:48] we have
[32:49] and i'm sure they are as well so we just
[32:52] say god bless you to our precious
[32:53] brothers and sisters in your homes may
[32:55] the lord be with you and bless you this
[32:58] evening
[32:59] we certainly miss you
[33:01] wish you were here praying for you
[33:04] amen
[33:05] proverbs chapter 29
[33:07] just one verse very familiar we'll read
[33:09] a couple of scriptures and then we're
[33:11] going to look to the lord in prayer
[33:13] verse 18 says where there is no vision
[33:16] the people
[33:18] perish
[33:19] but he that keepeth the law happy is he
[33:22] very familiar um i just feel
[33:25] um
[33:27] to be talking about vision for a good
[33:30] quarter of this year anyways because
[33:32] we need the right vision if we're going
[33:34] to move in the right direction amen
[33:38] and in the book of habakkuk
[33:40] if i'm saying that right habakkuk
[33:42] habakkuk
[33:47] i'm
[33:48] is it anybody can pronounce that a
[33:50] little bit better we probably need
[33:52] um
[33:57] exactly
[33:59] chapter two
[34:02] verse number one
[34:04] i if i could just say it like this let's
[34:06] look to the screen up here and read
[34:08] god's word
[34:12] amen
[34:14] verse number one i will stand
[34:16] upon my watch
[34:18] and set me upon the tower
[34:21] and will watch to see what he will say
[34:24] unto me
[34:26] and what i shall answer when i'm
[34:28] reproved
[34:30] and the lord answered me and said write
[34:32] the vision make it plain upon tables
[34:36] that he
[34:37] may run that readeth it
[34:41] for the vision is
[34:42] yet for an appointed time but at the end
[34:45] it shall speak and not lie though at
[34:47] terry wait for it because it will surely
[34:50] come it will not tarry
[34:53] behold my soul
[34:55] behold his soul which is lifted up is
[34:58] not upright in him
[35:00] but the just shall live by his faith
[35:03] amen let's look to the lord in prayer
[35:06] father we come to you
[35:08] very
[35:09] needy
[35:11] lord without you
[35:14] lord
[35:16] we can't
[35:18] hear
[35:21] the spiritual
[35:23] understanding the revelation
[35:27] that your word
[35:29] is given us in
[35:31] letter form
[35:33] we can understand
[35:36] uh the english language but we cannot
[35:38] understand
[35:39] the heavenly language without you
[35:42] and we pray that you would come tonight
[35:44] and the breaking of the bread of life
[35:48] you said where the carcass is there will
[35:49] the eagles be gathered together
[35:52] and we pray lord that you would give us
[35:55] fresh manna tonight
[35:58] lord that you would help us in these set
[36:00] of scriptures that we've read
[36:02] to
[36:03] uh hear from you
[36:05] how our lives need to be
[36:08] lord we commit the service with all of
[36:10] our needs you heard the requests the
[36:13] unspoken
[36:14] just the things that are on our heart
[36:16] lord
[36:17] we pray that you come and meet those
[36:19] knees as we trust in you we ask these
[36:22] things and give you the praise for them
[36:23] all in jesus precious name amen god
[36:27] bless you may be seated
[36:29] one entitled this message
[36:31] uh living god's vision
[36:34] living god's vision
[36:38] the bible says i will stand upon my
[36:40] watch
[36:41] and set me upon the tower
[36:43] and will watch to see what
[36:46] he will say
[36:47] unto me
[36:50] and what i shall answer
[36:52] when i am reproved i want us to think
[36:54] about this
[36:55] coming into to church and hearing god's
[36:59] word brother branham said that
[37:01] we come to church to find out where
[37:03] we're at with god and it's a similar to
[37:06] what our brother is saying here in the
[37:08] scriptures i will watch i will sit upon
[37:12] my tower i will watch to see what he
[37:15] shall say unto me
[37:16] and then also
[37:19] what i shall answer
[37:21] when i'm reproved
[37:24] now it's kind of hard to come into
[37:26] church
[37:27] uh
[37:28] as that we're questioning where we're at
[37:30] with god because we feel we know where
[37:32] we're at with god
[37:33] and we're we're just looking for some
[37:35] new information or some encouragement or
[37:38] perhaps a little bit of direction but
[37:40] but to better come in and find out where
[37:42] we're really at with god it's it takes a
[37:44] real
[37:45] humble heart to do that amen
[37:49] now it's not just what
[37:51] he speaks to us tonight or every time we
[37:54] come to church
[37:55] but how we're going to answer what he
[37:57] does speak to us because brother brandon
[37:59] says it's not the action that
[38:02] is
[38:03] uh what we're concerned about but the
[38:05] reaction so how are we going to react
[38:09] to what he says to us
[38:12] we can say amen that's the truth
[38:15] or we can say
[38:17] so be it in my life
[38:20] because a lot of times we when we say
[38:22] amen we could just say amen that's the
[38:23] truth that's the bible that's the word
[38:25] right
[38:26] but it it really means so be it
[38:29] so be it god so be it so you're
[38:32] answering uh what god is saying to you
[38:35] like
[38:36] let's make this real in my life lord
[38:38] what you're speaking
[38:40] it's a much stronger
[38:43] uh
[38:44] thought
[38:46] now the world that we're living in
[38:49] is blind
[38:52] they really don't know what's going on
[38:55] jesus said the people living in this age
[38:58] were spiritually blind
[39:00] paul said the god of this evil age has
[39:02] blinded the minds of those who believe
[39:05] not who who choose not to believe the
[39:07] word
[39:08] satan has just blinded their minds
[39:10] it's important that we have first a
[39:13] belief and then second an understanding
[39:19] if there was ever a day that we we need
[39:21] to have a vision
[39:23] this is the day
[39:25] where there's no vision
[39:27] people perish
[39:30] what is a vision
[39:32] is it what brother branham had when he
[39:34] saw things in people's lives
[39:38] well
[39:39] that's certainly a vision those are
[39:42] visions
[39:44] um
[39:45] but it's not the only kind of vision
[39:47] that we can receive of the lord i
[39:48] remember when brother johnson was here
[39:50] and he shared with me
[39:52] on the phone when he was in another
[39:55] state and he had a vision
[39:57] and he saw this woman in white
[39:59] and and and and
[40:01] and said come up to ann arbor and help
[40:03] us that was a real literal vision
[40:07] and so brother brandon had literal
[40:09] visions but that's not the only types of
[40:12] visions
[40:13] when jesus saw the multitude in matthew
[40:16] chapter 9 verse 36 he was moved with
[40:19] compassion on them because they fainted
[40:21] and they were scattered abroad as sheep
[40:24] having no
[40:25] shepherd amen
[40:28] now this vision
[40:29] was a burden for souls that didn't have
[40:33] the leadership of a shepherd
[40:36] no one to guide them
[40:39] people just doing their own thing going
[40:41] their own way not wanting to do what
[40:43] they were told and jesus saw them as a
[40:46] sheep having no shepherd everybody needs
[40:48] a shepherd
[40:50] and thank god
[40:52] that
[40:53] we have
[40:55] the chief shepherd amen
[40:58] but
[40:59] we
[41:00] if we didn't have the leadership under
[41:03] the chief shepherd
[41:05] we still
[41:07] wouldn't get
[41:09] proper leadership and i'll say it like
[41:11] this not all of us have the ability
[41:14] to get down and and hear from god like
[41:18] we should not willing to pay the price
[41:20] sometimes we we drift off and we just we
[41:23] think we got it all together and so god
[41:25] has given us
[41:27] um
[41:28] he chose the foolishness of preaching to
[41:30] save man
[41:31] and he's given us a five-fold ministry
[41:33] for our perfection so we have this is
[41:36] the plan that god has now god can speak
[41:38] to anybody at any time
[41:40] but
[41:42] we must learn
[41:43] uh to to to to be subject to god's
[41:47] to god's ministry amen
[41:49] i believe we should
[41:51] now
[41:52] jesus knew
[41:54] that more laborers were needed in order
[41:57] to help all these people that he's seen
[42:00] notice that here is god in flesh
[42:04] can do anything
[42:06] and he's saying
[42:07] we need to pray
[42:09] that the father he'll send more laborers
[42:12] into the field
[42:13] because
[42:14] he couldn't do it himself
[42:17] that's why he's chosen us
[42:20] and
[42:21] and he told his disciples to pray
[42:24] and we we need to have the same vision
[42:27] that jesus
[42:28] has now when a company has a vision
[42:32] statement
[42:35] it's an anchor point of any strategy
[42:39] plan
[42:41] it outlines what an organization would
[42:43] like to ultimately achieve and also
[42:45] gives purpose to existence of that
[42:48] organization now that's just a natural
[42:51] company
[42:52] helps you keep a focus and not get off
[42:55] track
[42:57] so let's uh apply this spiritually now
[43:00] so we can better understand
[43:03] uh when god gives us a vision it would
[43:06] be the anchor point of god's strategic
[43:10] plan not going to deviate from that
[43:13] right
[43:14] it's what we always have to go back to
[43:17] when we start drifting away
[43:19] it helps us keep purpose and a goal uh
[43:23] consistent for us
[43:26] and when we receive a vision from god
[43:29] it's it's an inspiration from another
[43:32] dimension
[43:35] it comes from a spiritual realm that's
[43:37] just beyond us
[43:40] sometimes we get bad thoughts or bad
[43:42] dreams we've all had them nightmares
[43:44] or even visions that we wish we didn't
[43:47] have
[43:49] and they come also from a spiritual
[43:53] around beyond us
[43:57] so just because we get things from a
[43:59] spiritual realm beyond us it doesn't
[44:01] mean it's all from the lord
[44:03] that's the point that i wanted to say
[44:05] they're not all true revelations from
[44:06] the holy ghost
[44:08] ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 says
[44:10] finally my brethren be strong in the
[44:12] lord and the power of his might and put
[44:14] on the whole armor of god
[44:17] that you may be able to stand against
[44:19] the wiles of the devil
[44:21] for we don't wrestle against one one
[44:22] another
[44:24] against you but against principalities
[44:27] and powers and against the rulers of the
[44:29] darkness of this world against spiritual
[44:31] wickedness in high places and sometimes
[44:34] we deal with things from the enemy we
[44:36] just
[44:38] we get woken up by bad uh thoughts and
[44:41] dreams and so we got to put on the whole
[44:43] armor of god amen wherefore take unto
[44:46] you the whole armor of god that you may
[44:48] be able to withstand
[44:50] end the evil day and having done all to
[44:53] stand
[44:55] what we're living in the end of times
[44:58] the world may think that they're
[45:00] fighting against flesh and blood
[45:04] but it's a a wicked spiritual warfare
[45:06] out there
[45:08] the devil knows he has but a short time
[45:11] he's making havoc on everyone
[45:14] and if there's ever an hour that we need
[45:15] to put on the whole armor of god it's
[45:18] today
[45:19] we need to cast down all reasoning all
[45:21] imaginations we need to bring every
[45:23] thought under subjection to the word
[45:26] make sure we're following the word line
[45:28] by line
[45:30] peter said
[45:31] living soberly watching
[45:34] uh vigilantly because our adversary the
[45:38] devil as a wrong line walketh about
[45:40] seeking whom he may devour let me just
[45:43] ask you a question how many has felt the
[45:46] devil attacking you
[45:49] it's just as real as real can be
[45:53] so we need to have a right vision for
[45:55] our lives
[45:57] the right inspiration
[45:59] our vision must be coming from the right
[46:02] source because the devil wants to trick
[46:04] us
[46:10] the inspiration that we get under
[46:13] is what is leading and directing our
[46:16] lives which way we're going to go
[46:19] so
[46:20] just imagine we went to the bar and we
[46:22] just got all drunk and we couldn't think
[46:24] straight
[46:26] well
[46:27] that inspiration would be leading us to
[46:30] do some crazy things
[46:35] now you get in the prayer room and
[46:37] locked into god get caught up in
[46:39] heavenly places his presence is so
[46:41] strong
[46:44] you're going to be directed in the right
[46:47] way
[46:49] just depends on
[46:50] where the inspiration is coming from
[46:54] we need the right direction for our life
[46:57] our family those that are around us
[47:00] so i'll say it's important for all of us
[47:01] to step back from time to time and take
[47:05] a look
[47:06] are we going the direction that we set
[47:08] out to do
[47:10] was my my statement my commitment that i
[47:13] made with god a year ago am i going in
[47:16] that same direction
[47:18] did i get off track
[47:20] because you need that anchor
[47:22] point the harder situations get the
[47:26] stronger our vision must be
[47:29] amen
[47:31] your anchor point must be as strong as
[47:33] the situation that you're going through
[47:35] in order to carry out the strategic plan
[47:41] things are going easy it's it's quite
[47:44] you don't need much of a vision
[47:46] it's it's
[47:48] easy to go to church it's easy to do all
[47:51] these things that god requires but
[47:54] when the
[47:55] things start happening in your life
[47:58] it becomes much more difficult to stay
[48:00] focused
[48:04] in the fall of 2007
[48:07] most of us experienced the housing
[48:09] market collapsed
[48:12] my son when he was looking through some
[48:14] of the records
[48:16] he said
[48:18] i don't know how you survived in 2008
[48:20] 2009. he said i never knew it was so bad
[48:27] most of us know the bottom fell out in
[48:29] the economy
[48:30] we went through what i'll say like a
[48:31] mini depression some of them some people
[48:34] call it that it was worse than the
[48:36] depression
[48:37] now of course
[48:40] we were we're in maybe the the food
[48:43] lines like we were then
[48:45] but the collapse of how much it fell
[48:47] back was greater
[48:50] there were 64
[48:53] 318 businesses that filed bankruptcy
[48:58] gm was one of them
[49:00] chrysler descended towards bankruptcy
[49:02] and michigan was hit the worst out of
[49:05] all the the us
[49:07] i believe it was because it it was the
[49:10] center like the hub of the the auto
[49:12] sector
[49:15] that's where
[49:17] we're involved with a great part of it
[49:20] i had no work
[49:21] i had no money
[49:25] i never took a paycheck
[49:27] for an entire year
[49:31] never took a dime from the church
[49:35] i went personally
[49:37] a quarter million dollars in debt just
[49:39] keeping my employees so that i didn't
[49:41] have to lay them
[49:43] was it a one week or a one month
[49:45] scenario this went on for a quite a long
[49:48] time it took me years to recover from
[49:51] this
[49:58] we had a thousand dollar
[50:01] payment
[50:03] for our house and our barn as as you
[50:06] have seen it
[50:09] we owe a lot but we need to come up with
[50:11] a thousand per month
[50:13] minimum and we were doing that for a
[50:16] long time
[50:18] but it obviously got really really hard
[50:20] during this time because i had no money
[50:22] no money came in
[50:25] and the bank pulled our note and
[50:27] demanded
[50:28] more money or they were going to take
[50:29] her home
[50:34] we barely survived
[50:37] paying a thousand dollars a month and
[50:39] now we had to come up with 4 600 a month
[50:43] each month
[50:47] you know what
[50:49] nobody knew about it
[50:53] nobody knew about it i think there was
[50:55] one
[50:56] couple in the church that we told
[51:01] little bits about i think my wife had
[51:03] talked
[51:04] to the sister
[51:09] the reason they didn't know about it
[51:10] because it wasn't part of my vision
[51:15] it was the situation that i was going
[51:17] through it was real
[51:20] but i didn't make it part of my vision
[51:23] my vision was from god
[51:28] we cannot
[51:31] panic
[51:32] be moved
[51:34] by things that are happening in our
[51:36] lives
[51:38] there's no need for it
[51:40] if god be for us who can be against us
[51:45] my vision was god
[51:47] he is my helper
[51:52] this precious brother said to me he said
[51:56] how brother john reacted to this long
[51:59] crisis was an inspiration to me
[52:04] now i'm sharing this testimony
[52:07] because we need to write the vision on
[52:10] the tables of our heart so people read
[52:12] us and they know how to run they know
[52:14] how to walk
[52:19] and i'll be honest with you i i don't
[52:21] believe i have ever gone through a
[52:22] harder time in my life
[52:26] i if there was a time i felt the lord
[52:28] was just carrying me
[52:30] it was that time
[52:33] but i trusted in god
[52:36] to the point that i didn't allow this
[52:38] long crisis to even affect
[52:42] how i was in church how i preached what
[52:44] i said i wouldn't tell anybody
[52:49] because if i talked negatively about it
[52:51] then those around me would end up
[52:53] suffering
[53:01] when god speaks to our hearts we need to
[53:03] capture the vision of god's inspiration
[53:06] amen when we come to church we can't
[53:09] allow the word to just fall on deaf ears
[53:14] jesus told us about four types of heart
[53:16] conditions that the word falls on amen
[53:19] the first condition is called the
[53:21] wayside heart condition
[53:24] it's a very common condition of the
[53:26] believer who comes to church but they're
[53:28] not in the spirit
[53:33] this believer he accepts the word but he
[53:35] can't quite catch the spiritual
[53:37] understanding of the word and the devil
[53:38] comes and he just reasons the word right
[53:40] out of him
[53:43] just not in the spirit just falls by the
[53:45] side just
[53:47] never quite catches it
[53:50] now the second condition is called the
[53:52] stony heart condition
[53:54] this is also a common spiritual
[53:57] condition of a believer who comes to
[53:59] church with hard spots in his heart
[54:03] the whole heart but they're hard spots
[54:07] and these spots can be caused by a
[54:09] number of situations
[54:11] one way as the believer is is
[54:14] he never
[54:15] got mature enough
[54:18] to get his heart softened because
[54:21] remember we all had stony hearts when we
[54:23] come to christ and he promised to put a
[54:25] new heart a new spirit in us and that
[54:28] would be a heart of flesh and that it
[54:30] could he could
[54:32] deal with it
[54:35] so if if a believer doesn't get to that
[54:37] place where his whole heart changes
[54:41] hard spots remain in there
[54:44] another way a hard spot can come is when
[54:47] uh
[54:48] a believer goes through hard situations
[54:51] and and they cause you to to to get
[54:55] upset or to get bothered or or or or
[54:58] maybe to
[55:00] to to to not forgive somebody
[55:05] just something's transpired to where you
[55:07] you just can't quite move forward
[55:09] because this happened
[55:12] and it causes a little hardness there
[55:17] things like this called harsh cause
[55:20] hard spots in our heart
[55:23] now these believers come to church
[55:25] ignoring their stony heart condition
[55:29] they just ignore it in other words
[55:31] it's soft enough in other areas and they
[55:33] just come to church just thinking on
[55:35] that but they're ignoring that part of
[55:38] their relationship is hardened
[55:42] but they come to church they sit in
[55:43] church they hear the preaching of the
[55:44] word
[55:45] and the bible says they say amen praise
[55:48] the lord i believe it
[55:51] and they receive the word that they're
[55:53] hearing with joy and gladness
[55:57] but because of the existing hard spots
[56:01] in their heart
[56:02] there's not enough room for that word
[56:04] that they said amen to to grow
[56:08] and when they go through trials
[56:10] persecutions
[56:12] having to stand for the message
[56:15] having to stand for perfect love
[56:17] for forgiveness for going the second
[56:19] mile for laying down their lives they
[56:22] become offended they can't do it for
[56:24] some reason they won't go through and
[56:26] they basically they're they stumped
[56:28] their growth all because of hard spots
[56:33] bad condition to have when you come to
[56:35] church
[56:39] now the third condition
[56:42] is called the mixed heart condition
[56:46] mixed heart condition
[56:49] we see this spiritual condition in
[56:50] believers who come to church with other
[56:53] desires in their heart
[56:56] and why they should be there
[56:59] they're excited about the word they want
[57:00] to receive it
[57:02] but because
[57:04] their mixed heart condition
[57:06] has
[57:07] other desires
[57:09] they take
[57:10] precedence over the word that that's
[57:12] heard
[57:16] and the devil tricks them to think
[57:18] the word will be preeminent with these
[57:20] other desires
[57:22] but god will never take second place
[57:26] you can't have mixed desires
[57:29] when you come to church it's got to be
[57:30] i'm all for you god i want to want you
[57:32] take everything out of me that isn't of
[57:34] you
[57:41] jesus said the very cares of this life i
[57:44] say that's the normal things that we go
[57:47] through
[57:48] actually choke out
[57:50] the word that we heard in church
[57:54] in other words it really doesn't do its
[57:57] full potential
[58:00] he said the deceitfulness of wanting
[58:03] things riches is one of them
[58:06] choke the word out
[58:08] and they become spiritually gets this
[58:11] unfruitful
[58:15] they can't bear
[58:17] the fruit of the holy ghost when they're
[58:19] going through a trial anymore
[58:22] they may know the word they they better
[58:24] quote it but
[58:25] they become unfruitful
[58:28] in this condition it's a very serious
[58:30] heart condition
[58:32] it can also lead to carnality
[58:36] to just a form of godliness but deny the
[58:39] power of god in their life
[58:42] terrible condition amen
[58:45] about believers just don't realize that
[58:48] god will never take second place so
[58:50] we've got to get everything else out of
[58:51] there matthew chapter 6 verse 24 no man
[58:54] can serve two masters
[58:57] for either he will hate the one
[59:00] and love the other or else he will hold
[59:02] to the one and despise the other
[59:05] you cannot serve god
[59:08] and mammon
[59:10] that's uncontrolled longing for gain
[59:14] just to get something out of life
[59:16] don't necessarily have to be money
[59:18] don't necessarily have to be popularity
[59:21] there's something that you can't
[59:24] put in this spot and you're just
[59:26] uncontrolled longing
[59:30] we're either pressing to gain god
[59:32] spiritually
[59:34] or
[59:35] gain naturally
[59:39] it's depends
[59:42] so we don't want to mix anything else in
[59:44] our heart besides god amen
[59:47] or become spiritually unfruitful let's
[59:50] take a look here deuteronomy chapter six
[59:52] verse five
[59:53] just trying to catch this
[59:55] same theme that we can't have a mixed
[59:58] heart condition deuteronomy chapter 6
[1:00:00] verse 5 and thou shalt love the lord
[1:00:03] with
[1:00:05] all now notice the word all
[1:00:08] is so
[1:00:09] important here with all thy heart with
[1:00:11] all thy soul with all thy might see you
[1:00:14] can't mix other things in the heart it's
[1:00:16] got to be all god
[1:00:19] and these words which i command thee
[1:00:21] this day
[1:00:22] it shall be in thy heart and thou shalt
[1:00:24] teach them diligently unto their
[1:00:26] children and shall talk of them when
[1:00:29] they'll sit in that house and they'll
[1:00:30] walk us by the way and when the lie is
[1:00:32] down when they'll rise us up and thou
[1:00:34] shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand
[1:00:37] and shall be in the frontlets between
[1:00:39] thy eyes and thou shall write them upon
[1:00:43] the post of the house
[1:00:46] and on thy
[1:00:47] gates now naturally you can go by and
[1:00:50] you can see people put little things on
[1:00:52] their their homes and their their their
[1:00:55] house their their their the gates where
[1:00:57] you enter in
[1:00:59] um but but that's
[1:01:03] we we need to put them in
[1:01:05] this vessel right here
[1:01:07] people need to see that you love god in
[1:01:10] this house
[1:01:13] and it don't matter
[1:01:15] you're a portable house
[1:01:17] wherever you're at amen
[1:01:19] the way that
[1:01:21] it's being described there
[1:01:23] it's the most important thing
[1:01:26] so we can't come to church with a mixed
[1:01:28] heart condition
[1:01:31] now the fourth condition
[1:01:32] that jesus said
[1:01:34] it's called the good heart condition
[1:01:37] good heart condition
[1:01:39] this is a spiritual condition of a
[1:01:40] believer who comes to church in the
[1:01:43] absolute best condition
[1:01:47] he has exercised his heart to believe
[1:01:49] every word of god his heart is so
[1:01:52] prepared when he comes to church he
[1:01:54] can't wait for those doors to be open
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:57] there's something inside i can't wait to
[1:02:00] get there
[1:02:01] that's a good condition to be in
[1:02:05] jesus said that
[1:02:06] this believer's heart is sincere
[1:02:09] honest and good
[1:02:12] something
[1:02:13] different about this condition
[1:02:16] than the other three
[1:02:18] how do we know if our heart is in the
[1:02:20] best condition or not
[1:02:23] but jesus said after we receive the word
[1:02:26] we will have a good spiritual
[1:02:29] understanding that's the first thing
[1:02:31] brother branham said that that's the
[1:02:36] good evidence of the holy ghost is
[1:02:37] having the right spiritual understanding
[1:02:40] of the word
[1:02:44] and brother branham also says
[1:02:46] that um the bride will know what to do
[1:02:51] with the word when the bridegroom gives
[1:02:53] gives her the word
[1:02:55] so what do we do with the word that's
[1:02:57] being preached to us
[1:02:58] we live it right
[1:03:01] we live it we manifest it that's what
[1:03:04] the bride is doing
[1:03:08] and then
[1:03:10] she keeps bearing more and more and more
[1:03:14] fruit it doesn't stop the other ones
[1:03:17] they bear fruit for a time and then it
[1:03:19] stops but this ground it just keeps
[1:03:21] bearing
[1:03:23] it just doesn't stop
[1:03:25] a carnal believer
[1:03:30] he will stop bearing fruit
[1:03:33] but the believer has a good heart
[1:03:35] condition will continue to bear fruit
[1:03:37] more and more he just he won't sit still
[1:03:42] god is against every branch that doesn't
[1:03:44] bear fruit we're told that in john 15 he
[1:03:47] just prunes it up
[1:03:50] but he wants fruit so bad
[1:03:52] that he'll start trimming things
[1:03:55] just to get more
[1:03:56] like he's not satisfied with as much
[1:03:59] fruit as we're given
[1:04:01] his attitude is i want to see more out
[1:04:03] of you so he prunes us even if it's not
[1:04:06] dead
[1:04:10] john chapter 15 verse 8 hearing is my
[1:04:13] father glorified
[1:04:15] that ye bear much fruit
[1:04:18] so shall ye be my disciples so you
[1:04:20] literally have to have a good heart
[1:04:23] condition to become his disciple
[1:04:27] are you with me
[1:04:28] john 15 16.
[1:04:30] you have not chosen me but i've chosen
[1:04:33] you and i've ordained you that you
[1:04:34] should go
[1:04:35] go
[1:04:37] you should leave here
[1:04:39] and bring forth fruit
[1:04:41] and that your fruit
[1:04:43] shouldn't stop
[1:04:46] it should remain
[1:04:49] that
[1:04:50] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[1:04:51] in my name he may give it to you
[1:04:55] so there's like a a little
[1:04:57] clause here that if we want the the
[1:05:00] benefits that god is wanting us to have
[1:05:03] we got to continue bearing fruit amen
[1:05:06] jesus did say by their throats
[1:05:09] you shall know them
[1:05:10] we're all bearing fruit that's true luke
[1:05:12] chapter 8 verse 15 he that receiveth the
[1:05:16] word
[1:05:17] in the good ground
[1:05:18] are they which in an honest and good
[1:05:22] heart
[1:05:24] having heard the word
[1:05:26] they keep it
[1:05:28] and they bring forth fruit
[1:05:30] from what they heard what with patience
[1:05:33] we just can't you know forget what we're
[1:05:36] hearing when god gives us the word
[1:05:40] we got to keep it
[1:05:41] i mean a good how you know you got a
[1:05:43] good heart condition you keep the word
[1:05:45] that you heard amen
[1:05:47] you're not keeping it i'm sorry you can
[1:05:49] say you got a good heart all you want
[1:05:51] but
[1:05:52] you got to you got to go back to the
[1:05:53] word the word tells you what kind of
[1:05:55] heart you have
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:06:00] a good heart condition
[1:06:02] is when a believer's heart is humble
[1:06:05] it's honest and it's prepared for the
[1:06:07] word
[1:06:10] so when you come into church and you're
[1:06:12] hearing the word you catch the vision
[1:06:15] that god has given you
[1:06:18] you catch the vision
[1:06:20] god
[1:06:21] is hid in simplicity
[1:06:25] but he's also
[1:06:26] revealed
[1:06:28] in the same
[1:06:30] our opening scripture the lord answered
[1:06:32] me and said write the vision
[1:06:35] and make it plain upon tables that that
[1:06:39] he
[1:06:39] may run that readeth it there's a
[1:06:43] purpose you need to write this down amen
[1:06:47] and i'm not talking about a piece of
[1:06:48] paper
[1:06:50] i'm talking about write it on your heart
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:53] write it on your heart
[1:06:57] when the believer writes the vision he
[1:06:59] makes it plain amen
[1:07:02] it's important that word says make it
[1:07:04] plain don't make it complex
[1:07:06] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:07:08] mouse
[1:07:09] speaketh right
[1:07:12] i'll say the abundance of the heart we
[1:07:14] manifest who we are
[1:07:17] second corinthians chapter three verse
[1:07:18] one
[1:07:20] do we begin again to commend ourselves
[1:07:23] or need we as some other epistles
[1:07:26] commendation to you
[1:07:28] or letters of combination from you in
[1:07:31] other words
[1:07:32] we shouldn't need to say something about
[1:07:36] how
[1:07:37] great we are
[1:07:39] we we don't need any kind of
[1:07:42] confirmation
[1:07:44] some letter some epistle from you
[1:07:47] about
[1:07:48] someone
[1:07:50] and we don't need uh them from you about
[1:07:54] you
[1:07:57] what do we need
[1:07:59] the life
[1:08:00] paul is talking to us about a life that
[1:08:03] everybody sees
[1:08:05] he said ye are our epistles
[1:08:08] written
[1:08:09] in our hearts known and read
[1:08:12] of all
[1:08:14] men
[1:08:16] for as much as ye our manifesty declared
[1:08:18] to be the epistles of christ ministered
[1:08:21] by us written not with ink but the
[1:08:23] spirit of the living god amen
[1:08:25] not in tables of stone
[1:08:28] but in fleshly tables of the heart
[1:08:34] so when a believer with a good heart
[1:08:36] condition here's the word he catches
[1:08:39] god's vision he his understanding opens
[1:08:42] he sees the reality of god's strategic
[1:08:44] plan for his life and he writes the
[1:08:47] vision in his good heart amen
[1:08:50] he accepts that word
[1:08:52] he puts it there it ain't something that
[1:08:55] goes in one ear and out the other he
[1:08:57] writes it in there becomes a part of his
[1:08:59] life
[1:09:01] and when he writes it he makes it so
[1:09:04] plain that whoever looks at his life
[1:09:06] they know what is written amen
[1:09:11] there's no wishy-washy no
[1:09:14] maybe so maybe not no up and down or i
[1:09:18] believe it today and tomorrow it's a
[1:09:19] question right
[1:09:21] there's no it's important today and
[1:09:23] tomorrow it's not as important like you
[1:09:25] forget it
[1:09:27] right
[1:09:28] there's no i've got a revelation of this
[1:09:30] and not manifest it in your life
[1:09:34] there's no god told me
[1:09:36] and then you're not doing it
[1:09:39] there's no hearing the word in not doing
[1:09:41] it
[1:09:42] there's no there's no beholding
[1:09:44] ourselves in the perfect law of liberty
[1:09:48] and straightway forgetting what you are
[1:09:52] you understand it's plain
[1:09:55] you write a plane there's no confusion
[1:09:57] in people when they read your life
[1:10:02] a good heart condition will make it
[1:10:04] plain in their lives
[1:10:06] they're anchored they're solid they're
[1:10:08] laser focused they're faithful
[1:10:11] first corinthians 15 58 therefore my
[1:10:14] beloved brethren be ye steadfast
[1:10:16] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:10:19] of the lord
[1:10:20] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:10:22] is not in vain in the lord
[1:10:25] it's plain in their lives
[1:10:28] so when a true believer reads their
[1:10:30] lives
[1:10:31] they know
[1:10:33] what to wrong they know how to run
[1:10:37] when people see you and they they see
[1:10:40] you going through a a trial they see how
[1:10:43] you react they say
[1:10:46] i see jesus
[1:10:48] and they run to jesus they they want
[1:10:51] what you got they run to the shores
[1:10:54] where you're leading them to
[1:10:57] oh i hope you can catch this
[1:11:07] if you want people to get saved
[1:11:10] you got to make it real clear
[1:11:13] you got to make it real plain
[1:11:15] that unless they give their heart to
[1:11:17] jesus christ they're going to hell it's
[1:11:18] got to be plain
[1:11:20] it can't be some wishy-washy purgatory
[1:11:23] thing
[1:11:26] cut and dry you got to make things plain
[1:11:28] whatever it is
[1:11:30] if you really want to help somebody make
[1:11:32] it plain
[1:11:38] just be steadfast unmovable
[1:11:41] for the vision
[1:11:42] is yet for an appointed time but at the
[1:11:45] end it shall speak and not lie though
[1:11:47] let terry wait for it because it shall
[1:11:49] surely come
[1:11:51] it will not tarry
[1:11:54] behold his soul which is lifted up is
[1:11:56] not upright in him for the just shall
[1:11:59] live by his faith
[1:12:03] some books
[1:12:05] when you read them
[1:12:07] they're very difficult
[1:12:10] to follow
[1:12:12] or even understand
[1:12:13] you ever get some instructions you just
[1:12:15] want to put this thing together
[1:12:17] some instructions
[1:12:19] and it's like hey look if they were to
[1:12:20] gave this to me i could have like did a
[1:12:22] lot better job yeah
[1:12:26] well
[1:12:27] other books they're just so easy to read
[1:12:31] you just pick it up and boom catch it
[1:12:34] easy to follow but it's no different
[1:12:36] with believers
[1:12:39] some are confusing
[1:12:42] and some are easy to read
[1:12:46] and god wants us
[1:12:49] to be plain
[1:12:51] god is hid in simplicity
[1:12:55] and he's revealed in the same
[1:13:00] for a moment let's just think
[1:13:05] brother mark
[1:13:07] he's calling on brother my we're gonna
[1:13:09] say brother bob brother bob
[1:13:11] goes a month
[1:13:13] and he says i gave up drink i don't
[1:13:15] drink
[1:13:16] next month
[1:13:18] he's drinking he comes to church
[1:13:20] everybody knows about it
[1:13:23] next month
[1:13:26] so i'm done with drinking i you know
[1:13:29] next month is drinking a crime
[1:13:32] see
[1:13:33] it's a confusing message
[1:13:38] and when we come to church god is
[1:13:40] speaking to every single one of us
[1:13:43] it may not be the same exact thing for
[1:13:46] every one of us but guaranteed god is
[1:13:48] speaking to us
[1:13:51] he wants us to take that word
[1:13:54] write it here
[1:13:55] make it plain so everybody that looks at
[1:13:58] your life
[1:13:59] they can run with it
[1:14:02] they know what to do
[1:14:04] they know who to follow paul said follow
[1:14:06] me as i follow christ he made it plain
[1:14:11] if i start preaching something different
[1:14:13] that ain't you know don't follow me
[1:14:15] don't run
[1:14:18] you go back to the original
[1:14:40] praise the lord
[1:14:44] we don't want people looking their lives
[1:14:46] and getting confused
[1:14:49] i'm going to make it plain
[1:14:51] we don't want to be displaying a
[1:14:54] wishy-washy soap opera to people
[1:14:57] because they're going to perish
[1:15:01] we're supposed to be leading them
[1:15:03] to a solid rock
[1:15:08] the word is a solid rock
[1:15:12] but unless it's revealed to us
[1:15:15] personally we cannot become solid
[1:15:21] so when it's revealed to us we can write
[1:15:24] it plain
[1:15:26] we cannot be satisfied with just being a
[1:15:28] hero of the word
[1:15:30] we got to put that thing into action and
[1:15:31] i'll tell you why
[1:15:33] because soon as we get by this month
[1:15:36] this year god's got something more for
[1:15:39] us
[1:15:41] he doesn't want us just staying in one
[1:15:43] spot
[1:15:45] everything you look at in god's nature
[1:15:47] it's
[1:15:47] growing it's going it's moving forward
[1:15:56] and so god has more for us it's up to us
[1:15:58] to come in and find out what he will say
[1:16:01] to us
[1:16:03] and when he speaks
[1:16:05] write it
[1:16:06] write it make it plain say i'm accepting
[1:16:09] this for my life no matter what it is
[1:16:12] don't wrestle with it you'll you'll make
[1:16:14] your vision
[1:16:16] confusing
[1:16:18] and then people that are watching your
[1:16:20] life
[1:16:21] are going to be like this
[1:16:26] and if we're really trying to bring them
[1:16:28] to christ
[1:16:29] to a higher walk in christ
[1:16:32] to
[1:16:33] any part of christ
[1:16:36] we need to remain steadfast
[1:16:39] solid on it it's okay to get it bad once
[1:16:43] i once thought this i believe this but i
[1:16:45] was wrong
[1:16:46] and god corrected me and i believe to
[1:16:49] write this now there's nothing
[1:16:52] absolutely wrong with that
[1:16:54] but there is something wrong if you keep
[1:16:56] hopping back and forth and your whole
[1:16:57] life is like that
[1:16:59] we god is looking for stability
[1:17:03] that's why we come to church to really
[1:17:06] find out where we're at with god and
[1:17:07] he'll make us more stable every time we
[1:17:10] come to church if we're willing to take
[1:17:12] the word on good ground
[1:17:15] but if we come with different types of
[1:17:16] ground we're hearing the same word
[1:17:18] that's establishing one person and it's
[1:17:20] making another person up and down
[1:17:25] begin making excuses
[1:17:29] i don't want my life to be a mystery
[1:17:31] novel
[1:17:38] proverbs chapter 7 verse 1.
[1:17:45] wouldn't it be a blessing to
[1:17:48] get done
[1:17:49] before 60 minutes
[1:17:54] this is a goal of mine
[1:17:58] proverbs chapter 7 verse 1
[1:18:00] my son
[1:18:01] keep my words
[1:18:03] and lay up my commandments with thee
[1:18:06] keep my commandments and live in my law
[1:18:08] as the apple thine eye
[1:18:10] bind them upon thy fingers and write
[1:18:13] them upon
[1:18:15] the table of thine heart
[1:18:22] it's not an option
[1:18:25] if you're going to write it anywhere
[1:18:26] write it there
[1:18:29] proverbs chapter 3 verse 1
[1:18:33] my son forget not my law
[1:18:36] but
[1:18:37] let thine heart keep my commandments for
[1:18:40] length of days and law life and peace
[1:18:42] shall i be let not mercy
[1:18:45] and truth
[1:18:47] for safety don't don't let them escape
[1:18:52] but bind them
[1:18:53] around thy night don't you leave without
[1:18:56] it
[1:18:57] don't you go to work without it don't
[1:19:00] don't you go the store without it don't
[1:19:02] you go over
[1:19:03] and text without it
[1:19:06] or talk to somebody without it
[1:19:08] but write them upon the tables of thine
[1:19:12] heart
[1:19:14] so shall i find favor and good
[1:19:16] understanding in the sight of god
[1:19:18] and man
[1:19:20] trust the lord with all thy heart lead
[1:19:21] not to understanding in all thy ways
[1:19:23] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[1:19:26] path but notice
[1:19:27] these are talking about what we need to
[1:19:30] do first
[1:19:33] we got to do our part first everybody
[1:19:35] wants leadership of god
[1:19:38] we everybody wants it
[1:19:40] and and it isn't like god doesn't want
[1:19:43] to give it he does
[1:19:45] but the thing is
[1:19:47] is it really fair
[1:19:49] to want it
[1:19:51] without doing what god wants us to do
[1:19:55] right
[1:19:56] i just think it's fair if my dad says
[1:20:00] i'm gonna
[1:20:02] buy you a a
[1:20:04] a a new guitar but you have to be
[1:20:06] faithful and and take the garbage out
[1:20:09] and wash the dishes and do your chores
[1:20:12] it's not right for me to expect the
[1:20:14] guitar and not do what he's asked me to
[1:20:16] do
[1:20:18] i know that's how the world's getting
[1:20:20] these days
[1:20:21] which is everything for nothing
[1:20:26] we want to be an example
[1:20:32] if god has revealed
[1:20:33] love to you
[1:20:35] then love everyone unconditionally
[1:20:39] if god has revealed faithfulness the
[1:20:41] importance of faithfulness to you
[1:20:43] then learn
[1:20:45] to be faithful it's not a gift
[1:20:48] you have to learn it you have to
[1:20:50] struggle you have to go through things
[1:20:53] you have to repent and say i'm sorry
[1:20:55] lord you have to get up and do it again
[1:20:57] if a righteous man falls seven times
[1:20:59] he'll get back up he'll keep going

[1:22:03] that's your opinion
[1:22:09] at
[1:22:10] the very least when they look at your
[1:22:11] life they ought to be seeing the same
[1:22:13] thing every time
[1:22:18] where there's no vision the people
[1:22:20] perish

[1:22:24] heart you just can't have it up here in

[1:22:28] got to write it on the tables of your
[1:22:29] heart

[1:22:34] a plain vision in our lives people are
[1:22:37] not going to run to jesus

[1:30:35] thoughts we get
[1:30:37] that are not exactly what the word is
[1:30:40] saying
[1:30:42] it's not necessarily what other people
[1:30:44] are saying to us
[1:30:46] it's what the enemy sometimes speaks
[1:30:48] right to our thoughts
[1:30:51] like
[1:30:52] what he did to eve in the garden
[1:30:55] oh you're not going to die
