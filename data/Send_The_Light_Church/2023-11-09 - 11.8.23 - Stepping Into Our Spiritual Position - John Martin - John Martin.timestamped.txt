[38:32] to be in God's house turn with me if you
[38:35] would to the book of Ephesians chapter
[38:43] 4 last week we spoke on recognizing our
[38:47] spiritual position and uh tonight we
[38:51] want to speak on part two uh stepping
[38:54] into our spirit spiritual position and
[38:58] so we're doing a little series on the
[39:01] function of a healthy
[39:03] body we kind of want to dig into some
[39:06] practical things that we run into and
[39:10] that we want to to try to follow the
[39:13] example in the Bible of how to work out
[39:16] things in the
[39:17] church amen amen let's just we'll read
[39:21] two verses and we'll have a word of
[39:23] prayer and then you'll be seated
[39:25] Ephesians chapter 4 starting with verse
[39:27] 15 and
[39:30] 16 but speaking the truth and love may
[39:33] grow up into him in all things which is
[39:37] the head even Christ from whom the whole
[39:40] body fitly joined together compacted by
[39:43] that which every joint supplieth
[39:45] according to the effectual working in
[39:48] the measure of every part making
[39:49] increase of the body unto the edifying
[39:53] of itself amen let's look to the Lord in
[39:56] a word to pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[39:58] just read these two verses in your book
[40:01] and Lord there's so much into them God
[40:06] we really need you we really need you to
[40:08] break it to us we really need the Holy
[40:10] Ghost to come and make this so real to
[40:13] us Lord that we could be the type of
[40:16] church that you want us to be here in
[40:18] Fenton Michigan Lord we don't want to uh
[40:22] try to replicate as it were some other
[40:25] church but God we want to replicate the
[40:27] Church of God that's in this Bible God
[40:30] we need you the great Holy Spirit to
[40:32] come and break the bread of life to us
[40:35] reveal to us show us all individually
[40:38] Lord that we might be the church that
[40:40] you're pleased with that you could see
[40:42] us fitly joined together functioning in
[40:45] a healthy way when there would be
[40:48] problems that would arise that we would
[40:49] just be able to handle them and take
[40:52] care of them the way that the Holy Ghost
[40:54] does it Grant it father we commit the
[40:57] service to you and we thank you now for
[40:59] Revelation in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[41:02] it amen God bless you may be seated at
[41:06] the beginning of this this chapter it's
[41:10] uh scoffield writes here in in my Bible
[41:15] uh the
[41:17] walk to a to to uh the walk to be worthy
[41:21] the
[41:22] position and we're talking about getting
[41:25] into our spiritual position so he starts
[41:27] out what is worthy to even get into that
[41:30] walk are you with me and he says
[41:33] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[41:35] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[41:38] vocation wherewith you are called and he
[41:40] says with all loneliness and meekness
[41:42] and
[41:43] longsuffering uh forbearing one another
[41:46] in love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[41:48] the spirit in the bond of Peace so this
[41:50] is what it this is part of being in our
[41:53] spiritual position you got to be walking
[41:57] in this and
[42:00] then he says it's not just for one
[42:03] person and he starts to express that
[42:06] there's one body one Spirit you're
[42:09] called into one hope if you're calling
[42:10] one Lord One Faith one baptism one God
[42:13] one father of all who is above all
[42:15] through all and in you all so it sounds
[42:17] like all of
[42:20] us if we're in our spiritual position in
[42:23] Christ we will be fulfilling walk with
[42:26] all loneliness and meekness with
[42:28] longsuffering and forbearance you just
[42:30] simply can't say you're in the spirit
[42:32] and not fulfill these scriptures because
[42:34] you're not walking worthy of the
[42:38] calling and then he goes on in this
[42:41] chapter to say that he had God has given
[42:44] us a five-fold Ministry to help us to do
[42:49] that right for our
[42:51] perfecting so he sends a five-fold
[42:54] Ministry to preach the word so we know
[42:56] how to walk so we so we so we understand
[43:00] what it means to be meek so we
[43:02] understand what it means to be
[43:03] longsuffering because they bring the
[43:05] examples out in the Bible and and breaks
[43:08] it down to us and this is how Moses
[43:10] walked he was the meekest man on the
[43:13] earth till Jesus Christ and and and this
[43:15] is how uh Jonah humbled himself and we
[43:19] see all these examples in the Bible the
[43:21] fful ministry breaks it down so we know
[43:23] how to walk in this age worthy of that
[43:27] calling
[43:28] amen so he said it's for the perfecting
[43:31] of the Saints the work of the ministry
[43:32] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[43:35] till we all come into the unity of the
[43:39] faith get it Unity Unity again unto the
[43:44] measure of the Statue of the fullness of
[43:47] Christ so to get in our spiritual
[43:49] position is to get to be more like Jesus
[43:52] that's the the the fullness of Christ
[43:54] that's what we're all longing for that
[43:56] when we see him we're going to be just
[43:58] like him and and if that's not our goal
[44:02] we we can't really step into our
[44:04] spiritual
[44:05] position we're we're we're we're coming
[44:07] to church for the for for other reasons
[44:10] now we want to take our subject from
[44:12] verse 16 from who the whole body is
[44:16] fitly joined together in order to
[44:21] function as a healthy body number one we
[44:25] must find our spiritual position and I
[44:28] want to I want to say this
[44:30] this um message is so simple it is so
[44:37] simple it is not complex there's not a
[44:39] lot of making it hard to understand but
[44:43] you can miss it you can miss it uh be
[44:47] God's hidden Simplicity and we can miss
[44:50] it but I want to say that we must find
[44:53] our spiritual position first so we want
[44:55] to to talk about what that spiritual
[44:58] position is a little bit more breaking
[45:00] it down it's not a title it's not an
[45:02] office it's not some Duty that you have
[45:04] in the church but it's when we're
[45:07] spiritually positioned meaning the Holy
[45:11] Ghost is controlling us or moving us to
[45:15] actually help the
[45:18] body now it can't get any simpler than
[45:22] that it ain't us helping the body it's
[45:25] the prepared and the Holy Ghost is using
[45:28] us to meet needs in the body amen
[45:32] supplying what every joint is needed so
[45:35] we're actively involved with our
[45:37] brothers and sisters in church we no
[45:39] longer just come to church about me it's
[45:43] about the body now stepping into our
[45:46] spiritual position is not hopping into
[45:48] church at the last
[45:50] minute a spiritual position requires us
[45:54] to be in the spirit to be out of the
[45:56] Flesh in the spirit instant in season
[45:59] out of season prepared for every good
[46:03] work the Bible says having the mind of
[46:05] Christ ready to help being conscious to
[46:08] help somebody see it's about the body
[46:10] that's what it means to be spiritually
[46:12] positioned in the
[46:14] body now we need to ask ourselves how
[46:17] can we be in our spiritual position in
[46:20] Christ if we're not in the
[46:23] spirit God is the spirit
[46:27] so if if we don't prepare
[46:30] ourselves we're
[46:33] exempt we cannot be spiritually
[46:36] positioned if we're not prepared for the
[46:38] Holy Ghost to work through us to move
[46:41] through us when he says hey there's a
[46:44] need you know it you know we've been
[46:47] used to having church more carnal more
[46:50] natural well there's a need oh boy they
[46:53] got a need but do I want to help do I
[46:55] not want to
[46:58] help and we we just try to carnally
[47:01] handle
[47:03] things Christ wants us to be fitly
[47:05] joined
[47:06] together if there's a need whether you
[47:08] want it or not that's your brother
[47:10] that's your sister we we need to do what
[47:13] we need to do to help that's all there
[47:15] is to
[47:16] it well I don't know what to do well
[47:18] that's why we're we're having
[47:23] this we we we're going to need to spend
[47:25] more time praying because the Holy Ghost
[47:27] is really I'm going to be honest with
[47:29] you if you're in your spiritual position
[47:30] the Holy Ghost is never just going to
[47:32] say don't worry about it leave it
[47:36] go I I'm not saying I'm not saying he
[47:40] would not do that once in a while
[47:42] because the Holy Ghost
[47:44] could I'm not saying it but what I am
[47:46] saying is Time After Time After Time or
[47:50] time and you just don't want to deal
[47:51] with things that is not the Holy Ghost
[47:53] that's the the point I'm trying to make
[47:54] and I think you you you see what I'm
[47:58] saying Christ must be
[48:03] preeminent we must be under his unction
[48:06] his authority his control a Believer
[48:09] cannot be spiritually positioned if he's
[48:12] not under proper headship of
[48:16] Christ Colossians 1:18 says and he is
[48:20] the head of the body the church it's all
[48:23] there is to it he is the head now your
[48:26] head tells you what to
[48:30] do if you didn't have a head you
[48:32] wouldn't be
[48:36] functioning and there's a lot of people
[48:38] who go to church that Christ is not the
[48:42] head they're in control well you're not
[48:45] spiritually positioned if you're in
[48:46] control Christ has to be in control so
[48:49] he is the head of the body of the church
[48:51] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[48:53] the dead that in all things he might
[48:56] have the preeminence so we're sitting
[48:58] here today we're in church and we know
[49:00] God's desire I I I can look at you and I
[49:02] have I have no idea what your desire is
[49:05] I don't know what's on your heart I I
[49:07] don't know where you're at but when we
[49:09] look at God today we know he's here he
[49:13] wants preeminence in all of our Lives
[49:15] amen and and if he gets preeminence what
[49:17] did Brother Ram say if he get one man
[49:19] his hand you turn the world upside down
[49:20] we know God is wanting to have
[49:22] preeminence here and if we don't give
[49:24] God that pre we're not too interested in
[49:27] helping the body so we're not
[49:29] functioning as a healthy
[49:33] body so when we're prepared or when the
[49:36] Holy Ghost has preeminence in us I can
[49:38] say like this real simply we're in our
[49:41] spiritual position that's how simple it
[49:45] is when we're prepared for God to use us
[49:48] and at any moment he's he sees a need
[49:50] you and you you got a hunger and a
[49:53] desire to help people your spirit
[49:55] spiritually in your position it is that
[49:59] simple it's not
[50:03] complexed being in our spiritual
[50:05] position is simply being spiritually
[50:08] prepared for God's
[50:10] use well we think about the three steps
[50:12] justification sanctification baptism of
[50:15] the Holy
[50:17] Ghost sanctification is set
[50:21] aside for the Lord to use
[50:24] you spirit position for God to use
[50:28] you now we want to break it down
[50:30] obviously in this series but number one
[50:33] we must find our spiritual position in
[50:36] the body in other words we must get into
[50:39] the place that we're in the
[50:43] spirit God can use us at any moment to
[50:46] meet a need he doesn't have to hit us
[50:49] over the head we're looking to help one
[50:51] another
[50:52] right there it is you're looking you've
[50:55] come with a heart to
[51:00] help number
[51:02] two we must operate according to the
[51:06] word of God whatever we do to help
[51:08] somebody it has to be in line with the
[51:10] word of God you can't do it your way
[51:14] this is the way I see we want to do it
[51:16] the way the Holy Ghost sees it that's
[51:18] why we need to be prepared he told his
[51:20] disciples don't you go out witness until
[51:22] you get filled with the Holy Ghost first
[51:24] because the the Holy Ghost is the one
[51:26] that's got to be the witnessing and I'll
[51:27] say it like this if we're going to
[51:28] function as a healthy body the Holy
[51:31] Ghost has got to be functioning through
[51:33] US
[51:38] am in order to function as a healthy
[51:42] body I want you to think about this one
[51:44] word we need to
[51:47] function it's that simple do something
[51:51] to
[51:54] help do do do something to help you're
[51:58] functioning to help you're not
[52:03] just I'm spiritual no that's not
[52:08] helping you got to
[52:11] function you know a a a word of
[52:17] encouragement grab somebody pray with
[52:19] them a 30 second prayer it don't have to
[52:22] be
[52:22] long let's pray for this need right now
[52:25] let me help bear this burden with you it
[52:29] you're this is how a church becomes
[52:32] healthier when brother Brandon said the
[52:34] sickest body I know is the body of
[52:36] Christ right so it if we're just honest
[52:42] um there's enough needs in here we could
[52:44] be busy all day helping one another but
[52:47] you know what it is we just don't
[52:50] care I'm just being honest we don't care
[52:53] enough I mean just just try to be right
[52:55] down the middle of the the road here we
[52:58] don't want to sit around like a bump on
[52:59] the Rock we want to
[53:02] function now this spiritual position
[53:05] it's described in Ephesians 4:16 Christ
[53:09] is the head of the body he has uh he has
[53:14] free access to move us anytime he wants
[53:18] to us to effectually work through our
[53:20] lives to help somebody because remember
[53:23] brother bam says the devil can't do
[53:25] nothing to you unless he works through
[53:28] somebody is that what he said okay well
[53:32] Christ can't Christ don't want to help
[53:35] somebody unless he's working through
[53:36] somebody we all came to to Christ
[53:39] through somebody bringing Christ to us
[53:43] right so the body washes the body the
[53:46] body helps the body God is trying to get
[53:48] us to function like a
[53:51] body I'm telling you when you're when
[53:54] you're scrubbing yourself and cleaning
[53:57] yourself taking a shower you don't sit
[53:59] there and try to hit the Dirt Off
[54:03] Your it hurts so you know how to get it
[54:07] off nice and
[54:10] easy sometimes we just need to care
[54:13] about one another discern one another
[54:15] discern the body of
[54:17] Christ feel that's what it means to be
[54:20] in your spiritual position is to be have
[54:22] a heart of
[54:24] caring
[54:28] when Christ is preeminent in you he will
[54:31] freely make increase to the body here we
[54:34] know it's God's motive to love and the
[54:36] Bible says that the body edifies itself
[54:39] in
[54:42] love so when we're in our spiritual
[54:44] position we're fitly joined together the
[54:46] entire body what are we doing we're
[54:48] supplying every connection with what it
[54:51] needs so you see this brother you see
[54:54] this sister
[54:55] and you
[54:57] think I I don't know what I can say to
[54:59] to to Brother Bruce it doesn't look like
[55:01] he's got it
[55:02] needs and I he's much more spiritual
[55:06] than I what what Brother Bruce I want
[55:09] you to know I'm praying for you when I'm
[55:12] at
[55:14] home just supplying to that that joint
[55:17] right there supplying to that
[55:23] connection there's always something
[55:25] something we can do the scripture says
[55:27] we're compacted
[55:30] together now what does compacting
[55:34] mean
[55:37] well I would think that brother bman
[55:40] would know what a compactor is is the
[55:43] RADS have to be compacted before you put
[55:45] the cement on
[55:47] them and sometimes you have to
[55:50] compact
[55:51] sand or
[55:53] stone and what that that does is you're
[55:55] making it
[55:57] tighter you're crushing it you're making
[56:00] it
[56:01] stronger so that when you put the
[56:03] concrete on or the paving blocks
[56:05] whatever you're doing they don't just
[56:08] break apart because you got a good
[56:10] foundation now this word compacting in
[56:13] Ephesians it means to drive together to
[56:17] unite to show to teach to gather to
[56:20] instruct to knit together to prove right
[56:25] so it sounds like to me the body what
[56:28] our our our motive here is now we want
[56:30] to come together and help make things
[56:34] better better better for the church
[56:37] better for the
[56:39] body and it's without respect to
[56:43] persons come on God has no respect to
[56:45] persons why should you be right God
[56:48] wants us just helping everyone so we
[56:51] must recognize and move into our
[56:53] spiritual position position by just I'm
[56:56] prepared I am prepared I know why I'm
[56:58] here I know what I want to accomplish
[57:01] want God to use me second we're
[57:05] operating in the
[57:07] spirit we're operating in other
[57:10] words I see the need and I'm walking
[57:13] into it and I'm going to let the Lord
[57:16] just use my mind whatever thoughts come
[57:19] to my mind I'm going to try to just go
[57:21] with
[57:22] that now when we start doing this we're
[57:25] going to fumble and make
[57:27] mistakes things are not going to be
[57:30] perfect but we need to
[57:33] practice every gift that God gives a man
[57:36] or woman it needs to be
[57:38] practiced it needs to be developed this
[57:41] functioning as a healthy body it needs
[57:43] to be practiced you know we've all had
[57:47] pretty much
[57:48] upbringings that wasn't
[57:52] Godly or at least most of us I could say
[57:55] it like that and so we never learn how
[57:58] to function
[57:59] properly we yell we scream we put the
[58:03] fist up and don't you tell
[58:06] me and I remember my my dad bless his
[58:09] heart he's gone on now I shouldn't talk
[58:11] about him but I remember him shaking his
[58:13] hand right in the
[58:16] face yelling at the men at
[58:19] work that's how we function that's not
[58:23] how we function in
[58:25] Christ we shouldn't be doing that in our
[58:27] homes we shouldn't be doing it here and
[58:31] we should be functioning as a healthy
[58:34] body now when we're functioning as a
[58:37] healthy body does you know what we're
[58:39] actually doing we're setting an example
[58:40] of living for others right we really are
[58:45] now there are some things that affect
[58:46] the health of a body I want to speak on
[58:47] one of them because it's a big one and
[58:49] speaking as a whole it's
[58:53] selfishness big
[58:57] big big bad
[58:59] thing selfishness if a person is
[59:03] battling with selfishness he is exempt
[59:06] from being positionally placed in the
[59:08] body he can't be it's an it's an
[59:12] oxymoron um if I could say it like
[59:16] that to be in your placees I'm ready to
[59:19] be used to help somebody else well when
[59:22] you're selfish you're not even thinking
[59:25] about anybody else you're in a position
[59:26] to see what you can get out of the
[59:28] service or being here it's two different
[59:32] things so there may be some that like
[59:36] this service and there's going to be
[59:38] some that can't wait to Sunday
[59:43] service but I want to be clear about
[59:45] when we come to church we all have needs
[59:48] and I want to kind of put our needs in
[59:52] in a three Cate three
[59:55] priorities the first
[59:58] priority when we come to
[1:00:01] church I believe every person needs to
[1:00:03] come to church with humility and love to
[1:00:08] know where they stand with
[1:00:12] God that's got to be the number one part
[1:00:15] because that's what the prophet taught
[1:00:16] us we come here to find out where we're
[1:00:19] at with God so we need a humility what
[1:00:21] does that mean an attitude of I could be
[1:00:24] wrong about this situation I could have
[1:00:26] been walking the whole day and it might
[1:00:28] have not been in the will of God and I
[1:00:29] need to find out this thing I've been
[1:00:31] working on for the last three weeks the
[1:00:33] last two years I may be wrong I need to
[1:00:35] I need to just come and I need to be
[1:00:37] sure and you got to have that love God I
[1:00:40] need to hear from you amen this is the
[1:00:43] first priority why we should come to
[1:00:45] church and all the more as we see the
[1:00:48] day
[1:00:49] approaching now the second priority and
[1:00:52] our motive all to be to help minister to
[1:00:55] our spiritual
[1:00:57] family I know this is really rocking
[1:01:01] some but I'm saying it like it
[1:01:05] is the least we can do is pray for one
[1:01:08] another I remember we got a prophecy one
[1:01:10] time the Lord said that we need to come
[1:01:12] to gather together and pray one for
[1:01:14] another he said that there there
[1:01:16] shouldn't be any isms and schisms in the
[1:01:18] body and the remedy was to come together
[1:01:21] and pray for one
[1:01:23] another
[1:01:26] prayer is the most important thing we
[1:01:28] can do for one another now I want to
[1:01:29] talk about the number three priority
[1:01:31] that somehow we make it number
[1:01:33] one when we come to church there's a lot
[1:01:37] of reasons we can come to church some
[1:01:39] are good and some are
[1:01:40] bad sometimes we come because we have to
[1:01:43] the doors are open and well you know
[1:01:45] it's time to go and I got to
[1:01:47] go that's not a real good reason to come
[1:01:49] to
[1:01:51] church now when we have needs we ought
[1:01:54] to be looking to God in faith for God to
[1:01:58] meet those
[1:01:59] needs if we need healing for our body
[1:02:03] our mind our spirit our our
[1:02:04] relationships our homes our jobs
[1:02:08] whatever it might be if we're Desiring
[1:02:11] direction for something in our life we
[1:02:14] we want the the leadership of the Holy
[1:02:16] Ghost to to to lead us in what direction
[1:02:19] these are not selfish motives I want to
[1:02:23] make that real clear but they're not
[1:02:26] priority one and
[1:02:28] two you come to church and you make this
[1:02:31] your number one priority you are not
[1:02:33] spiritually in your
[1:02:39] position look if I was sitting on that
[1:02:41] front row I'd be saying Amen to this but
[1:02:43] you know I've but I've spent time
[1:02:46] studying
[1:02:50] it now these may not be spiritual
[1:02:53] motives but that doesn't make them
[1:02:55] selfish
[1:02:56] motives they
[1:03:00] needs the thing is we can become selfish
[1:03:03] about them that's the point I'm trying
[1:03:06] to make they're not selfish modes but we
[1:03:08] can become selfish about we can make
[1:03:11] them number one
[1:03:12] priority and that ain't what the prophet
[1:03:14] taught
[1:03:15] us to the
[1:03:19] unbeliever to the
[1:03:21] unbeliever that healing was just the B
[1:03:24] to get the attention of the
[1:03:29] bride and then they get hooked with the
[1:03:32] word and the word becomes their
[1:03:39] absolute then we can get to a place like
[1:03:42] job though he slay me I'm still going to
[1:03:44] trust him I'm hooked my heart is fixed
[1:03:49] this word is my
[1:03:53] everything
[1:03:55] and we're always going to have these
[1:03:56] things in our life they're like trials
[1:03:58] either coming in one you're in one or
[1:04:00] you're going out you're always going to
[1:04:02] have
[1:04:03] needs but we need to keep our priorities
[1:04:06] straight when we come to
[1:04:08] church so this is this service is about
[1:04:11] stepping in to your spiritual position
[1:04:14] you're not there because you were
[1:04:17] saved you're not there because you were
[1:04:19] saved 10 years
[1:04:21] ago you're there because today you made
[1:04:24] a decision to get out of your flesh to
[1:04:27] come to church with the right motives
[1:04:29] and that you got the mindset of
[1:04:31] supplying what is needed because
[1:04:34] everybody can't be up here at the
[1:04:36] pulpit preaching
[1:04:38] right this is where we come to hear from
[1:04:42] God and I'll be honest with you if
[1:04:44] you're not in the spirit hearing from
[1:04:45] God he could be speaking to you and
[1:04:47] you'd miss
[1:04:48] it so I give you another reason to get
[1:04:50] in the
[1:04:51] spirit amen so if we're going to
[1:04:54] function as a healthy body we're going
[1:04:56] to have to learn and put into practice
[1:04:59] to put other people before ours
[1:05:03] ourselves to put other people's needs
[1:05:05] before our own when we come to
[1:05:08] church I'll tell you to putting this in
[1:05:10] practice I see the whole church
[1:05:13] changing this th this is a reality this
[1:05:17] is what the Bible
[1:05:20] teaches and we
[1:05:22] have we have made things about
[1:05:25] herself that's selfishness that that
[1:05:28] will
[1:05:29] hurt the health of a
[1:05:32] church a healthy body works at helping
[1:05:35] others with their needs puts them before
[1:05:38] their own imagine everyone coming to
[1:05:41] church with a selfish
[1:05:43] motive now this shouldn't be too hard to
[1:05:45] do right now should
[1:05:47] it but everybody came to church with
[1:05:49] everything's about
[1:05:51] me if I don't get what I want I'm going
[1:05:54] to pout I'm going to show it I'm going
[1:05:56] to display my sa
[1:06:00] dissatisfaction well
[1:06:03] that's that's not going to be very
[1:06:06] healthy for the body that
[1:06:10] selfishness well why come to church uh
[1:06:13] for my family it's all about my
[1:06:16] family if you never teach your family to
[1:06:19] supply the needs of others at
[1:06:21] church how far is your family going to
[1:06:23] go
[1:06:26] Go That's not healthy for a body
[1:06:31] either why I come to church mainly
[1:06:34] because well I have to you ever come to
[1:06:38] church because you had
[1:06:40] to where there's no
[1:06:43] vision the health of the body perish you
[1:06:47] need a vision while you're coming to
[1:06:49] church you need to get rid of
[1:06:51] selfishness it's strong it is very very
[1:06:57] strong imagine coming to church to get
[1:06:59] something from somebody
[1:07:02] else maybe we're just wanting to get
[1:07:05] attention from somebody look at me look
[1:07:08] what I did look what I know attention
[1:07:12] Grabbers if we're not
[1:07:14] careful we're going to end up coming to
[1:07:16] church esteeming ourself better than
[1:07:20] others and the scripture teaches us
[1:07:22] plainly to esteem others better than
[1:07:25] ourselves it's about lifting one another
[1:07:27] up am it's about helping one another and
[1:07:31] if you're so stuck on yourself you're
[1:07:33] never going to help
[1:07:37] anybody when we think of a healthy body
[1:07:40] it's a body that is actually
[1:07:45] exercising helping others you're putting
[1:07:48] it to exercise I was talking to brother
[1:07:50] Ben about
[1:07:52] exercising it's it's about meeting needs
[1:07:54] it's about taking care of problems it's
[1:07:57] about working through differences that's
[1:07:59] a big one because a lot of times
[1:08:02] something said something's done
[1:08:03] something's misunderstood there's a a a
[1:08:06] a hurt feeling something a and and we we
[1:08:09] don't want to work through it we just
[1:08:10] you know we'd rather go home and talk
[1:08:13] bad about
[1:08:15] somebody that's not healthy just because
[1:08:18] you're spiritual and somebody did you
[1:08:20] wrong that doesn't give you a right to
[1:08:21] go talk about it it doesn't give you to
[1:08:24] feel bad about
[1:08:27] it God's calling you to be the bigger
[1:08:31] person and to to to go help that
[1:08:34] situation get resolved well brother John
[1:08:37] my parents never taught me I don't know
[1:08:38] how to do that we're going to start
[1:08:40] learning amen we're going to start
[1:08:42] learning the biggest thing we got to do
[1:08:44] is face the
[1:08:47] fear face the
[1:08:49] fear Satan doesn't want you to work
[1:08:52] things out Satan wants you to go home
[1:08:54] with a chip on your shoulder with with
[1:08:57] being hurt or offended because the
[1:08:58] pastor didn't shake my
[1:09:08] hand it's not healthy for the body so we
[1:09:11] got to think of the body not about
[1:09:13] oursel I know we're hurt I know we get
[1:09:16] hurt but think about the
[1:09:19] body live for the body live for others
[1:09:22] live to help that person that hurt you
[1:09:24] that offended you or if you know
[1:09:26] somebody that hurt somebody else get in
[1:09:29] there and be a
[1:09:31] peacemaker roll your sleeves up hey
[1:09:33] let's come together I want all three of
[1:09:35] us to pray come on this is the Holy
[1:09:38] Ghost he's hidden Simplicity but you
[1:09:41] know what we made Church different than
[1:09:44] what that Bible told us to make
[1:09:46] it we become so selfish that we don't
[1:09:49] want to put into practice these
[1:09:52] things how is God going to to make us
[1:09:55] into His
[1:09:56] Image I mean when we do something wrong
[1:09:59] doesn't the Holy Ghost come and knock on
[1:10:01] our
[1:10:03] heart they say you need to get that
[1:10:05] thing taken care of he don't just leave
[1:10:10] and and stay
[1:10:13] left I mean he may take his flight on
[1:10:16] the pole and be grieved for a second but
[1:10:19] he'll still speak to our heart and give
[1:10:20] us a chance because that's the love of
[1:10:22] God Amen
[1:10:24] so any kind of selfishness in the body
[1:10:27] will negatively affect the health of the
[1:10:30] body you know it's basically like eating
[1:10:33] processed
[1:10:35] foods with all the GMOs and all the bad
[1:10:38] things that we' you know are told not to
[1:10:40] eat so Safeguard yourself from any kind
[1:10:44] of
[1:10:45] selfishness remember the law of God
[1:10:48] every seed brings forth of its kind amen
[1:10:51] so we got to be careful about what we're
[1:10:52] sewing galaan Ians chapter 6 verse
[1:10:54] number 8 Galatians 6 chapter 6 verse
[1:10:58] number
[1:11:00] 8 I hope you brought your Bibles because
[1:11:03] we're going to get into them here in
[1:11:04] just a little bit for he that sth to his
[1:11:09] flesh this is selfishness I'm just going
[1:11:11] to stick that word in there right now
[1:11:13] for he that sth to his flesh
[1:11:16] selfishness shall reap of the flesh I'm
[1:11:19] sorry shall of the flesh reap corruption
[1:11:25] we're trying to get the corruption out
[1:11:26] of the
[1:11:27] church but he that sth to the spirit
[1:11:31] shall of the spirit reap life
[1:11:33] Everlasting amen when you help the body
[1:11:38] it's giving life to the body it's
[1:11:40] healthier it's stronger it's able to to
[1:11:44] do
[1:11:44] more now look what he says here and let
[1:11:47] us not be weary in doing this for in due
[1:11:52] season we shall reap if we fre how many
[1:11:54] times you said I've tried I tried I'm
[1:11:56] getting so tired of it hey you got a
[1:11:59] scripture right here let us not be weary
[1:12:01] in well-doing for in due season we shall
[1:12:03] reap if we faint
[1:12:05] not now look at verse 10 verse 10 this
[1:12:09] is for us as we have therefore
[1:12:12] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[1:12:17] especially especially unto them who are
[1:12:21] of the household of faith amen praise
[1:12:24] the
[1:12:26] Lord I tell you that just kicks
[1:12:28] selfishness right out the
[1:12:30] window see it's maturity here when
[1:12:33] you're in your spiritual position you're
[1:12:36] you're you're
[1:12:37] mature there's a a a a a spiritual place
[1:12:42] where God can use you to do good onto
[1:12:45] others a and to help as there's
[1:12:48] opportunity and God gives opportunity
[1:12:51] what do we know about opportunity
[1:12:53] opportunity is all around us Thomas
[1:12:56] Edison said it just it's hid because
[1:13:00] it's dressed with overalls and it looks
[1:13:02] like
[1:13:05] work and that's what this is you know
[1:13:08] what I I don't want to do that just not
[1:13:09] into that you know I got things going on
[1:13:11] in my life and I got to get out of
[1:13:14] here okay you know you can't force
[1:13:17] somebody to be spiritual you can't force
[1:13:20] somebody to get in their spiritual
[1:13:21] position it's something that the bride
[1:13:24] just
[1:13:26] does the and the bride is not going to
[1:13:29] not do
[1:13:31] it the bride is going to do it so it
[1:13:34] just it's showing where we're
[1:13:36] standing the word is the acid
[1:13:40] test so God gives us a five-fold
[1:13:43] Ministry for edifying the body till we
[1:13:46] all come into this Unity of doing the
[1:13:49] same thing Christ does in me he does in
[1:13:52] you right to help right to help now I'm
[1:13:56] not saying he says the exact same word
[1:13:59] or does it the same way or Smiles this
[1:14:01] way or puts his hand on the shoulder
[1:14:02] this way no when we sit at the table to
[1:14:05] go eat we got knives and forks and
[1:14:08] spoons
[1:14:09] and but we're still getting the food
[1:14:11] down our stomach you understand so we
[1:14:14] don't have to be um you
[1:14:17] know trying to mimic somebody but we do
[1:14:21] have to step out in faith I'm Lord I'm
[1:14:23] doing this according to your word now
[1:14:25] use me bring the results that you desire
[1:14:27] to bring and if it don't work we hey I'm
[1:14:31] sorry I'm sorry I meant this I meant
[1:14:36] this
[1:14:37] we that to me is love that's love that's
[1:14:41] what we're looking for we're no more
[1:14:43] children tossed to and fro there's
[1:14:46] there's stability now there's maturity
[1:14:49] happening while we're working through
[1:14:51] things and verse 15 of Ephesians 4 but
[1:14:55] speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:15:00] up into him in All
[1:15:05] Things wow I'll tell you you know what
[1:15:08] that right there that's it I just need
[1:15:10] one scripture right there to know that
[1:15:13] I'm going to work the rest of my life to
[1:15:15] fulfill that
[1:15:16] one every scripture I see when I read it
[1:15:20] I feel there's a lot for me to do to to
[1:15:24] come to that place you know we skip over
[1:15:26] things and we think well that's not for
[1:15:28] me that is for us we all got to grow up
[1:15:31] we all God is not marrying some little
[1:15:35] 13-year-old he's marrying a bride a
[1:15:38] mature
[1:15:41] woman and that's what we got to come
[1:15:45] to he's the head we're the
[1:15:49] body now he wants us to be a healthy
[1:15:51] body a healthy mature body
[1:15:54] Paul said when I was a child I spake as
[1:15:56] a
[1:15:57] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:16:01] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:16:05] away childish things I I I I put away
[1:16:08] carnality and and look at me and it's
[1:16:10] it's about me and I'm coming with my
[1:16:12] selfish motives but now I'm a I'm a
[1:16:15] mature
[1:16:17] person and now it's about living for
[1:16:21] others I've caught the revelation
[1:16:25] now look God is
[1:16:26] not he's not taking any church in this
[1:16:32] whole world up in a Rapture not he's not
[1:16:37] taking one whole church in a whole
[1:16:39] Rapture he is taking
[1:16:44] individuals and so when I'm speaking
[1:16:47] here I'm speaking to the
[1:16:50] bride and and and the bride appreciates
[1:16:54] this word hallelujah the bride wants to
[1:16:57] become this word
[1:17:00] amen so as we're
[1:17:03] maturing we're helping to supply the
[1:17:05] needs of one another what can I give you
[1:17:07] can give because Christ is in you you
[1:17:10] have a lot to
[1:17:14] offer you can edify you can add how many
[1:17:19] times have you walked away from the
[1:17:21] church and just be honest with me I'm
[1:17:23] not going to call you out and ask you to
[1:17:24] say them but I want you to be honest and
[1:17:26] answer this question how many times have
[1:17:29] you walked away from the church and said
[1:17:31] well that church
[1:17:36] needs all that that that brother that
[1:17:40] sister
[1:17:41] oh you know what that
[1:17:44] church how many
[1:17:48] times now look if God shows you that God
[1:17:52] has put you you in the place of meeting
[1:17:54] that
[1:17:55] need you start with prayer and then he
[1:17:58] uses you to go meet that
[1:18:00] need but now if that's just Satan
[1:18:04] talking you don't have any kind of Faith
[1:18:08] to meet that need you're just dwelling
[1:18:10] by
[1:18:12] fear there's no confidence you're not
[1:18:14] working to meet that need You' just been
[1:18:17] listening to a devil and you thought it
[1:18:19] was God giving you a revelation how bad
[1:18:20] that church was or how bad that person
[1:18:22] was
[1:18:23] [Laughter]
[1:18:26] help us Lord we got to become fitly
[1:18:30] joined
[1:18:31] together and Supply every joint
[1:18:35] according to the effectual measure in
[1:18:38] every part making
[1:18:40] increase of the body so I say it like
[1:18:42] this if you see a
[1:18:43] need if you see that there is a need you
[1:18:47] become the help to that need because I
[1:18:50] tell you one man can't do it
[1:18:51] all if if if we could then it would not
[1:18:55] be a body but it's a body
[1:18:58] Ministry yes we have a five-fold
[1:19:00] Ministry that that preaches to us
[1:19:04] individually that we how to get ready
[1:19:07] but then we take that word and we
[1:19:09] exercise it amongst the body with a body
[1:19:11] Ministry you're ministering to this
[1:19:13] person you're ministering to this person
[1:19:15] the next day you're ministering to
[1:19:16] another person you go home and you say
[1:19:19] Lord I want you to use me at the church
[1:19:22] I want you to use me to help just one
[1:19:25] person it becomes real and then God lays
[1:19:28] burdens on your heart and you you walk
[1:19:30] in them and you you see God use you
[1:19:33] because you're in his hands and you you
[1:19:35] place in him to use
[1:19:38] you now verse
[1:19:41] 17 this I say therefore and testify in
[1:19:46] the Lord see so this is kind of like a
[1:19:49] conclusion from the first 17 verses that
[1:19:52] ye hence for forth walk not as other
[1:19:55] Gentiles
[1:19:57] walk and how do they walk in the vanity
[1:20:01] of their
[1:20:03] mind they're just
[1:20:06] selfish they're just selfish very
[1:20:09] selfish vain
[1:20:12] thinking that word vanity means
[1:20:15] excessive pride in or Adoration of one
[1:20:19] own appearance or achievements it's all
[1:20:23] about me right that's how people are not
[1:20:28] in their spiritual position walk they're
[1:20:31] walking with the mindset it's about
[1:20:36] them is it okay to preach
[1:20:38] this okay having the
[1:20:43] understanding
[1:20:45] darkened the way they see Church the way
[1:20:48] they see things being alienated from the
[1:20:51] life of God what does that mean
[1:20:54] alienated there's a separation
[1:20:58] right they're not seeing the life of God
[1:21:01] the way that it really is because if
[1:21:03] they did they would be Allowing God to
[1:21:05] work through them
[1:21:07] right so it's through the ignorance that
[1:21:10] is in them because of what the blindness
[1:21:12] of their heart their their love for God
[1:21:15] has has turned away and that's gotten
[1:21:18] more towards the things that they want
[1:21:20] right lovers of themselves more than
[1:21:21] lovers of God amen who being past
[1:21:25] feeling have given themselves over to
[1:21:27] lciv to work all uncleanness with
[1:21:30] what greediness if that ain't
[1:21:36] selfishness selfish
[1:21:39] motives people giving themselves over to
[1:21:43] what they want with all
[1:21:49] greediness now these are not
[1:21:53] Believers in their spiritual
[1:21:56] position they are out of position they
[1:21:58] may be in church because brother B says
[1:22:00] there's all kinds of Believers in the
[1:22:02] church but these are not spiritual
[1:22:05] Believers in their
[1:22:07] position now I love this verse 20 but ye
[1:22:10] have not so learned
[1:22:13] Christ in other words he's speaking to
[1:22:16] two groups here Church natural Church
[1:22:19] spiritual right before we get into the
[1:22:22] other church I just want to go to Jude
[1:22:25] can you let me go to Jude Jude Verse
[1:22:30] 18 still talking about this church
[1:22:32] natural for a second because this is
[1:22:34] what we got to safeguard against if
[1:22:37] we're Church natural when we pop in here
[1:22:39] we're not going to be in our spiritual
[1:22:40] position
[1:22:42] therefore God's not going to be able to
[1:22:44] use us the way we want him to use us how
[1:22:47] that they told you verse 18 how that
[1:22:51] they told you that there should should
[1:22:52] be mockers in the last time who should
[1:22:55] walk after their own ungodly
[1:22:59] Desires in the vanity of their mind
[1:23:02] right these be they who separate
[1:23:06] themselves Central having not the
[1:23:09] spirit what does that mean brother
[1:23:13] John that word separate means to
[1:23:17] disjoin they disjoin themselves from the
[1:23:21] body from the burden of helping from the
[1:23:24] from the opportunities that are before
[1:23:27] them as we have therefore opportunity
[1:23:29] let us do good they disjoin themselves
[1:23:35] from
[1:23:36] that natural Church natural Central what
[1:23:40] does that mean that means natural
[1:23:44] they're sensitive to only the natural
[1:23:47] things in life in other words their
[1:23:49] first two spiritual priorities they
[1:23:51] don't come to church with them
[1:23:56] Central just natural Carly minded having
[1:24:00] not the spirit being alienated from the
[1:24:04] life of God right and they choose this
[1:24:07] they separate
[1:24:11] themselves and this is a wonderful thing
[1:24:13] about serving God in this country we can
[1:24:15] do it from the dictates of our
[1:24:18] heart and you know we're not going to
[1:24:20] have that that that time forever
[1:24:23] Prophet said the doors are going to be
[1:24:25] closed and we're going to have to have
[1:24:27] the goods that's what I'm telling you
[1:24:30] we're going to have to have the
[1:24:34] goods all right verse 20 now here's
[1:24:37] Church spiritual but ye beloved building
[1:24:41] up
[1:24:42] yourselves on the Most Holy Faith I want
[1:24:45] you to
[1:24:46] not look at
[1:24:49] this personally but I want you to look
[1:24:52] at this just for a moment as a body as
[1:24:55] us God is speaking or Jude is speaking
[1:24:58] to the body but ye beloved body building
[1:25:02] up yourselves on the Most Holy Faith
[1:25:05] praying in the Holy Ghost keeping
[1:25:07] yourselves in the love of God not
[1:25:11] yourself yourselves in the love of God
[1:25:13] looking for the mercy of Our Lord uh
[1:25:15] Jesus Christ unto eternal life and some
[1:25:19] having
[1:25:20] compassion making a difference that's
[1:25:22] what makes a difference in a church is
[1:25:24] having the true compassion of God Amen
[1:25:27] and others saved with fear pulling them
[1:25:31] out of the fire hating even the garments
[1:25:33] that are spotted by the
[1:25:35] flesh see the body is working together
[1:25:38] to edify itself in
[1:25:42] love it's so simple God is hid in
[1:25:46] Simplicity it's not complex to get in
[1:25:48] your spiritual position you got one
[1:25:51] enemy standing in your way and that's
[1:25:52] your flesh your flesh don't want you in
[1:25:55] that spiritual position you got to
[1:25:57] crucify it you got to put it under your
[1:26:02] feet all right let's get back to
[1:26:05] Ephesians 4 we just got a few oh my
[1:26:11] my this verse 17 Ephesians 4 this I say
[1:26:15] therefore and testify in the Lord that
[1:26:17] ye henceforth not walk walk not as other
[1:26:19] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[1:26:21] mind having their
[1:26:22] understanding darkened being aliened
[1:26:24] from the life of God through the inance
[1:26:25] that's in them because of their unbelief
[1:26:28] who being past
[1:26:30] feeling past feeling for others have
[1:26:34] given themselves over to themselves to
[1:26:35] work on cleanness with greediness but ye
[1:26:38] have not so learned
[1:26:42] Christ in other words you've been taught
[1:26:45] to not walk as other Gentiles walk in
[1:26:48] the vanity of their mind you've been
[1:26:50] taught to live for others you've been
[1:26:52] taught taught to love and edify one
[1:26:54] another you've been taught to feel for
[1:26:56] the body to to function as a body you've
[1:26:58] been
[1:26:59] taught we haven't alienated ourself from
[1:27:04] the gospel are you with me all right
[1:27:08] let's turn to Philippians chapter
[1:27:10] 2
[1:27:13] and this is
[1:27:17] Paul's uh some verses here uh two
[1:27:22] the Philippian
[1:27:24] church as he he's teaching them so
[1:27:27] you've not so learned Christ so we're
[1:27:30] learning how to function as a body and
[1:27:33] this was this was already in my notes uh
[1:27:36] Brother Joseph when Brother Joseph read
[1:27:38] Philippians chapter 2 verse 7 in his
[1:27:41] Bible study
[1:27:43] today and starting with verse number two
[1:27:45] fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded
[1:27:49] right not the vanity of your own mind
[1:27:51] but to be like-minded and that mind is
[1:27:53] with Christ having the same love being
[1:27:57] of one Accord and of one
[1:28:01] mind oh I love this word let nothing be
[1:28:05] done through Strife or vain
[1:28:08] Glory but in lonliness of Mind Let each
[1:28:12] esteem the other better than themselves
[1:28:15] amen look not every man on his own
[1:28:17] things there it is number three number
[1:28:20] three priority
[1:28:22] it's telling us don't look on the I know
[1:28:24] you have a need but don't don't look on
[1:28:27] your own
[1:28:29] things the scripture is telling us here
[1:28:32] but every man also on the things of
[1:28:34] others if there's a prayer request comes
[1:28:36] in get behind that that prayer request
[1:28:39] in prayer and say God meet that need for
[1:28:41] my brother meet that need for my
[1:28:46] sister let this mind be in you which was
[1:28:50] also in Christ Jesus saw I'll say it
[1:28:52] like this Jesus Christ looked on
[1:28:55] everybody else's things and not his
[1:28:59] own and Paul's telling us to have that
[1:29:02] same mindset come to church with that
[1:29:04] same mindset it's not about what we can
[1:29:06] get out of
[1:29:07] service it's about it's about
[1:29:11] others you know God promised that if we
[1:29:14] put him first that all other things
[1:29:16] would be added and when you put others
[1:29:19] before you before you you're putting God
[1:29:23] that's just scripture who being in the
[1:29:25] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[1:29:27] equal with God but made himself of no
[1:29:29] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:29:32] a servant
[1:29:35] oh came to church with the form of a
[1:29:37] servant and was made in the likeness of
[1:29:40] man and being found in fashion as a man
[1:29:43] he humbled himself even more and became
[1:29:47] obedient not just to coming to church
[1:29:50] but onto death
[1:29:52] even the death of the Cross so no matter
[1:29:54] how much we humble oursel I'm just going
[1:29:56] to say it like this there's probably we
[1:29:58] could
[1:29:59] go
[1:30:01] right the more humble we are the more
[1:30:03] we're going to
[1:30:06] recognize that there's others needs that
[1:30:08] we can that God can use us to help it's
[1:30:11] you know we you know carnally we can
[1:30:13] think being in our spiritual position is
[1:30:15] knowing you know what all the seals mean
[1:30:18] and you know uh the Thunders and
[1:30:22] um quote all these things from the
[1:30:24] prophet and that is not being in your
[1:30:26] spiritual
[1:30:28] position that's just knowledge of the of
[1:30:31] the
[1:30:32] message but you need to take that
[1:30:35] knowledge and start functioning with it
[1:30:38] start functioning with
[1:30:40] it amen Ephesians chapter 4: 21 we still
[1:30:45] have a few minutes
[1:30:48] here I wanted to finish this because in
[1:30:52] here you know Paul is talking about both
[1:30:57] Church natural and church spiritual and
[1:31:00] you'll see that as we go through here if
[1:31:02] so be that ye I'm going start with verse
[1:31:04] 20 but ye have not so learned Christ if
[1:31:07] so be that ye have heard of him and have
[1:31:09] been taught by him as the truth is in
[1:31:12] Jesus so I want to say this who has
[1:31:15] taught you about Jesus has it been John
[1:31:17] Martin or has it been
[1:31:20] Jesus
[1:31:23] I hope Jesus is teaching you because
[1:31:26] that's the only way it's going to stick
[1:31:28] if it ain't on the foundation of Christ
[1:31:30] it won't
[1:31:34] stand that ye put
[1:31:36] off concerning the formal
[1:31:40] conversation the old man which is
[1:31:43] corrupt according to deceitful lust
[1:31:47] selfish selfish put it off and be
[1:31:51] renewed red in the spirit of your mind
[1:31:53] which we just read the mind of Christ be
[1:31:56] renewed in that Spirit by esteeming
[1:31:59] others and that you put on the new man
[1:32:03] which is after God is created in
[1:32:06] righteousness and true Holiness
[1:32:08] wherefore put away lying speaking every
[1:32:11] man truth with his neighbor for we are
[1:32:14] members one of another we're all one
[1:32:18] body we're supposed to be one not hiding
[1:32:21] things from
[1:32:22] somebody come
[1:32:25] on it's going to take the you know who's
[1:32:28] going to do this right here you know's
[1:32:29] going to fulfill the scripture the bride
[1:32:32] they have to the bride will become the
[1:32:36] word that's this is all there is to it
[1:32:39] and I want to encourage you
[1:32:41] bride to start practicing these
[1:32:47] things sometimes you know when it comes
[1:32:49] to
[1:32:50] lying
[1:32:54] they they're called like white lies
[1:32:56] what's a white
[1:32:58] lie but I really didn't want to tell my
[1:33:01] motive and I just you know was just
[1:33:03] trying
[1:33:06] to look we're all liars I'm just as big
[1:33:10] a liar as you
[1:33:13] are all men are
[1:33:19] liars sometimes my wife tells tell me
[1:33:21] we're having dinner at 600 and then at
[1:33:24] 6:00 she says well if you want dinner
[1:33:25] you better go out and get it because you
[1:33:27] know we don't got nothing
[1:33:32] made hey we all fall short but see we
[1:33:35] have scripture to tell us what we need
[1:33:38] to
[1:33:39] do just in front of one another be real
[1:33:42] be honest say it like it
[1:33:46] is all
[1:33:48] right so put away L speak every man
[1:33:51] truth with his neighbor for we are
[1:33:53] members one of another be ye angry and
[1:33:57] sin not let not the sun go down upon
[1:34:01] your wrath neither give place to the
[1:34:03] devil in other words do never leave
[1:34:06] church with a chip on your
[1:34:10] shoulder God don't want the sun to go
[1:34:12] down say well you know I'm just going to
[1:34:14] pray about this for three
[1:34:16] months no just humble yourself to get
[1:34:19] things right well I didn't do nothing
[1:34:22] wrong well then maybe you just need to
[1:34:24] forgive maybe you need to love and
[1:34:26] forgive the person who did you wrong and
[1:34:28] they don't even know they did you
[1:34:30] wrong just you got to function as a
[1:34:33] healthy body because this this being
[1:34:35] Central and separating and kind of doing
[1:34:37] our own thing that's not Christ and as
[1:34:39] much as we think we're spiritual we're
[1:34:41] not in our spiritual position
[1:34:46] am let him that stole steal no
[1:34:50] more
[1:34:52] let's not steal any more Glory from god
[1:34:56] let's give him all the glory but rather
[1:34:58] let him labor working with his hands the
[1:35:02] thing that is good that he might have to
[1:35:05] give to him that needeth isn't that a
[1:35:08] good motive most people work so they can
[1:35:11] get a nest
[1:35:12] egg for the
[1:35:14] future and the scripture is telling us
[1:35:16] that we need to
[1:35:20] give
[1:35:24] we would probably have more today if we
[1:35:26] gave more
[1:35:29] before I believe
[1:35:31] that let no corrupt communication
[1:35:34] proceed out of your
[1:35:36] mouth that's not healthy for the body
[1:35:40] but that which is good to the use of the
[1:35:43] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[1:35:48] the person or people you are talking to
[1:35:52] Minister Grace now I believe we
[1:35:56] all can work on this can you say
[1:36:02] Amen be kind oh let me let me I got
[1:36:06] three verses here and I'm quitting and
[1:36:08] grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:36:11] God because you can't be in your
[1:36:13] spiritual position very long if you're
[1:36:15] going to grieve the Holy
[1:36:17] Spirit whereby ye are sealed unto the
[1:36:20] day of redemption let all bitterness let
[1:36:23] all wrath let all
[1:36:25] anger glamor evil speaking let it be put
[1:36:30] away from you with all malice don't hold
[1:36:35] any
[1:36:36] grudges get it away from you all of it
[1:36:40] it didn't say some of it all of
[1:36:42] it and be ye kind one to another
[1:36:48] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:36:50] as God for Christ's sake have forgiven
[1:36:53] you now that's all if we just fulfill
[1:36:56] that everything's going to be all good
[1:36:58] everything's going to be good but as
[1:37:00] soon as you say well they that wasn't
[1:37:02] fair what they did to
[1:37:04] me you
[1:37:06] just made yourself a lousy excuse not to
[1:37:10] fulfill the word of
[1:37:12] God you just said you know what I'm
[1:37:14] going to get out of my spiritual
[1:37:16] position of following the word and I'm
[1:37:19] just going to carnally serve God my own
[1:37:22] way and that's what you're doing you're
[1:37:25] carnally serving God your way this is
[1:37:28] his way this is the way walk ye in it
[1:37:31] amen just follow it it's the pattern
[1:37:33] it's not me that wasn't my rules this
[1:37:36] isn't this is I'm not preaching from
[1:37:38] some booklet that says Sendel light
[1:37:41] rules this is the
[1:37:44] Bible we don't need anything there's
[1:37:47] nothing better than the
[1:37:49] Bible what we got to do is just humble
[1:37:51] ourself to say I want to start doing
[1:37:53] that am praying about getting in our our
[1:37:57] position first we recognize it this is
[1:38:00] what I need to do I'm recognizing that I
[1:38:02] need to be prepared to help the body
[1:38:06] that's recognizing your position and you
[1:38:08] step into that by saying I now am
[1:38:11] ready and then and then what do we do we
[1:38:15] start helping one another before you
[1:38:18] know it you were going home with your
[1:38:20] feeling so good because you help
[1:38:25] somebody you know how good it is when
[1:38:27] you're helping somebody you just feel
[1:38:29] real good about it it's a blessing when
[1:38:32] you know you help somebody because God's
[1:38:34] just going to give it right back to
[1:38:36] you and so these are the fundamental
[1:38:41] principle of a health function as a
[1:38:43] healthy body are you with me amen let's
[1:38:47] Stand Together praise the
[1:38:50] Lord it's
