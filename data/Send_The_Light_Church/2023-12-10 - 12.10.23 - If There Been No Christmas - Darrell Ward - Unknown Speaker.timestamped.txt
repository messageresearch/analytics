[39:30] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[39:31] the glory of the Lord Shone around about

[39:39] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[39:42] which shall be to all people for and you
[39:45] is Born This Day in the city of David a

[39:50] shall be a sign unto you you shall find
[39:52] the Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths

[39:57] was with the angel a multitude of
[39:58] heavenly hosts praising God and saying
[40:01] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[40:03] peace Good Will towards men and it came
[40:07] to pass as the Angels were going away
[40:09] from them into heaven that the Shepherds
[40:11] said one to another let us now go even
[40:14] unto Bethlehem and see this thing which
[40:17] has come to pass which the Lord hath
[40:20] made known unto us aren't you glad the
[40:23] Lord has made it known unto us
[40:26] and they came with haste and found Mary
[40:28] and Joseph and a babe lying in a manger
[40:32] and Mary might have said something like
[40:34] this how did you know we were
[40:37] here said the angel told us what to look
[40:39] for that's right may the Lord add the
[40:42] blessing to the reading of his word I
[40:43] want to speak to for a few minutes this
[40:44] morning if it's all right on if there
[40:47] had been no
[40:49] Christmas if there had been no Christmas
[40:53] Heavenly Father we love you today today
[40:56] Lord thank you so much for all that
[40:58] you've done for us we submit oursel in
[41:01] this congregation into your hands For
[41:03] Your Glory bless your children this
[41:05] morning we ask in Jesus name Saints said
[41:09] amen amen God bless you you may be
[41:12] seated you know I guess it was the week
[41:15] before
[41:17] Thanksgiving that I first started
[41:18] hearing the songs in the stores the
[41:21] songs of the Season It's the Most
[41:24] Wonderful Time of the Year year
[41:27] Christmas and Christmas to so many
[41:30] people means so many things Christmas to
[41:33] some means a Santa Claus and reindeer
[41:36] and elves to others it means family and
[41:39] Gatherings and food and laughter to
[41:42] others it's a depressing time because of
[41:44] memories of better Christmas has G
[41:48] by or because they don't have the means
[41:51] to provide gifts for their family and
[41:53] their friends but is that all Christmas
[41:56] really is is just a festive holiday just
[41:59] some kind of an event but you see all
[42:01] real Christians knows what the world has
[42:04] made
[42:05] Christmas isn't Christmas at
[42:08] all Christmas is not a
[42:11] celebration but it should be a day of
[42:14] worship Bible readers know that the word
[42:17] Christmas is not even mentioned in the
[42:20] bible but the birth of Jesus is
[42:23] mentioned and we understand that the
[42:25] prophet was not against the true meaning
[42:27] of Christmas but he was against
[42:30] commercializing
[42:32] it for he had this to say about
[42:34] Christmas now it looks like everybody's
[42:37] singing songs about a white Christmas
[42:38] and praying for the same and we may have
[42:40] it it looks like this keeps up we may
[42:43] have the white Christmas and Christmas
[42:44] is the time of year he said I just wish
[42:46] it could be Christmas all the time
[42:49] everybody seems to be so friendly around
[42:51] Christmas time wanting to help one
[42:52] another and everything and everybody
[42:54] down on the street saying how are you
[42:55] brother and other times of the year they
[42:57] won't even speak to you so it'd be good
[42:59] if it stayed Christmas wouldn't it
[43:01] Christmas all the
[43:04] time and the fact of all air and
[43:06] everything there is he says there's
[43:09] something about it that the world tries
[43:11] to make it an
[43:12] exmas you know they try to take Christ
[43:15] out of the whole thing and we know that
[43:17] to be true I was just getting off the
[43:19] plane here at Detroit just a couple of
[43:21] days ago and as I exited the plane the
[43:23] stst there said happy holidays because
[43:26] to say Merry Christmas is Politically
[43:30] Incorrect but no matter what they try to
[43:32] do to Christmas God is still God of
[43:36] Christmas it's somewhere hasn't he the
[43:39] prophet said he sure has he's got
[43:40] something about it that's just the very
[43:42] name and the thoughts of the birth of
[43:45] the Lord Jesus the world puts a Santa
[43:48] Claus in its place and the the world has
[43:50] made it an exmas and the world has made
[43:52] it a happy holiday but not to
[43:55] Christians to the Christian it's
[43:58] still
[44:00] Christmas we have received a kingdom
[44:02] that cannot be moved all these other
[44:05] things are falling apart America is
[44:07] falling apart Europe is falling apart
[44:10] Asia is falling apart this is more true
[44:13] now than it was when the prophet said it
[44:15] back in the
[44:16] 60s world has fallen apart but we are in
[44:19] a kingdom Hallelujah an eternal Kingdom
[44:22] that it cannot be moved for Christmas
[44:26] is every
[44:32] day I told Brother John when I was a
[44:34] young man started preaching they said if
[44:36] you say what the prophet said you'll do
[44:38] well I told Brother John I find out the
[44:40] more I say what the prophet said people
[44:42] get mad at
[44:43] you true but this is what he
[44:47] said where Christmas is every day living
[44:50] in the presence of the king amen don't
[44:52] have to guess about it it's the truth
[44:54] it's God's truth it's God's complete
[44:57] truth he said how I love him for this
[45:00] how good he is to us he said so I
[45:03] appreciate all your prayers and by God's
[45:05] help and Grace a very Merry Christmas to
[45:08] every one of you remember my saying this
[45:10] is not Santa
[45:12] Claus this is
[45:14] Jesus Christmas is for Jesus you see
[45:18] Christmas Means
[45:20] Christ Christmas Means Christ and we
[45:23] were writing last night showing the
[45:25] kitties all the house is decorated and
[45:27] everything which is awful nice but I
[45:28] thought if I had anything on my house
[45:31] that I ever wanted to write it would be
[45:32] a neon sign saying trusting Christ will
[45:36] be in your Christmas that's right put
[45:38] Christ back in
[45:41] Christmas now we all know that Jesus was
[45:43] not born in
[45:45] December the prophet Tau us that he was
[45:47] born sometime in early April or May but
[45:50] the prophet said what difference does it
[45:52] make whether whether it's the December
[45:55] or whether they do it in July or August
[45:57] or whenever it might be that they would
[45:59] designate a time set aside he said it's
[46:01] still a sacredness of remembering that
[46:04] God gave us the hope that we have within
[46:07] us what is Christmas Christmas is the
[46:10] fulfilling of a promise that God made
[46:14] us the Bible said You shall bring forth
[46:17] a son and that shall call his name Jesus
[46:19] for he shall save his people from their
[46:23] sins all this was done that it might be
[46:26] fulfilled which is spoken of the Lord by
[46:27] the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall
[46:29] be with child and shall bring forth the
[46:32] son and they shall call his name
[46:34] Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
[46:38] With Us amen remembering what Christmas
[46:42] did for us and as I was thinking about
[46:45] this and this thought of Christmas then
[46:47] this thought came to me what if there
[46:49] had been no
[46:51] Christmas anybody ever think of that if
[46:54] there had been no Christmas and that's
[46:57] my thought this morning for just a few
[46:59] minutes if there had been no Christmas
[47:02] you say wait a minute brother darl the
[47:04] prophet of God said Jesus never pointed
[47:06] to his birth he pointed to his death the
[47:09] cross and that's exactly the truth Amen
[47:12] in fact the prophet said he never even
[47:15] pointed to Christmas but you see he
[47:18] could not die in the flesh if he wasn't
[47:21] born In the Flesh and if there had been
[47:24] no Christmas that would have been no
[47:26] Calvary
[47:27] amen if there had been no Christmas
[47:29] there would have been no
[47:31] burial if there had been no Christmas
[47:33] there would have been no Resurrection
[47:36] amen if there had been no Christmas
[47:38] there had been no lifting of the curse
[47:41] off of
[47:42] humanity for God the Creator created the
[47:45] first Adam without father or mother
[47:48] that's right and if there had been no
[47:50] Christmas there would have been no
[47:51] second Adam because of the Fall there
[47:54] had to come a second Adam who would be
[47:56] created without an Earthly father or
[48:00] mother you said oh brother darl what
[48:02] about she was an incubator that carried
[48:05] God's
[48:07] seed amen so there had to come someone
[48:11] without an Earthly father or mother that
[48:13] would be on the same basis as the first
[48:15] Adam to restore us back again if there
[48:19] had been no Christmas there would have
[48:20] been no breaking of the room oh my amen
[48:25] think about that if there had been no
[48:26] Christmas there had been no breaking of
[48:28] the womb to lift the curse off of
[48:31] mankind Jesus born of a woman made
[48:34] fashioned like sinful flesh and there to
[48:36] take the sting of death he had to die
[48:38] like a mortal to take away our
[48:42] sins and on that first Christmas morning
[48:45] when Christ was born what was it God the
[48:48] Creator created a second Adam the love
[48:52] of God that God had for Adam in his race
[48:55] how God unfolded himself and became a
[48:59] Christmas
[49:01] package Christmas Means Christ and when
[49:04] Adam left the garden because of sin God
[49:07] said Adam I'll bring you back I'll bring
[49:10] you back home you'll be home by
[49:17] Christmas Hallelujah for Christmas Means
[49:21] Christ and by Christ Adam I will bring
[49:24] you back home
[49:26] amen had first Christmas Shepherds in
[49:29] their
[49:30] fields I received a visitation from
[49:33] angels that told him of this great gift
[49:36] that was given to the world and where
[49:38] they could find the place where the word
[49:39] was made flesh deity revealed in
[49:42] humanity you will find him in a Manger
[49:45] wrapped in swaddling cloth that package
[49:47] didn't look like much it had no beauty
[49:50] that we should desire him but the
[49:51] greatest thing that was ever wrapped in
[49:53] human flesh was w in it God himself
[49:57] wrapped his own self in a Christmas
[49:59] package and sent it to the World the
[50:01] greatest Christmas gift did not come
[50:04] from
[50:05] Amazon
[50:09] Hallelujah it came from God Amen the
[50:13] first one the greatest one the only true
[50:16] original Christmas package if there had
[50:19] been no Christmas this package would
[50:21] have never been delivered Emmanuel
[50:26] God With Us making a way to be God in
[50:30] us for he just didn't want to be above
[50:33] us he just didn't want to be with us but
[50:35] he wanted to be in
[50:38] us if there had been no Christmas there
[50:41] would have been no peace where he said
[50:43] Peace I leave with you my peace I give
[50:45] unto you not as the world giveth give I
[50:47] unto you let not your hearts be troubled
[50:49] neither let it be afraid if there had
[50:52] been no Christmas there would have been
[50:53] no love for God so loved the world that
[50:56] he gave his only begotten son that so
[50:58] whoever so believeth on him should not
[51:00] perish but have everlasting life and
[51:03] this was manifested the love of God
[51:05] towards us because God that God sent his
[51:08] only begotten son into the world that we
[51:11] might live through him amen if there had
[51:14] been no Christmas there would have been
[51:16] no savior a savior for my unbelief amen
[51:20] and your unbelief a savior to save us
[51:24] from ourselves
[51:26] yes we needed saving from
[51:30] ourselves where God sent not his son
[51:32] into the world to condemn the world but
[51:35] that the world through him might be
[51:37] saved amen if there had been no
[51:39] Christmas there would have been no
[51:41] second birth Christmas is not a pagan
[51:44] celebration to us it's a sacred hour if
[51:47] there had been no Christmas there had
[51:48] have been no Resurrection there'd been
[51:50] no Christmas there'd be no love there'd
[51:51] be no peace there'd be no Hereafter for
[51:53] the believer if there' been no no
[51:56] Christmas if there had been no Christmas
[51:59] there would have been no fulfillment of
[52:00] the coming of Messiah spoken by the
[52:03] prophets of old if there had been no
[52:05] Christmas there would have been no super
[52:06] sign for what did Christmas give us it
[52:09] gave us an everlasting sign Jehovah God
[52:13] became man and took our stock crossed
[52:15] himself from God and become a man
[52:17] there's the sign the prophet said he was
[52:20] God he was he was God and became a man
[52:22] not rich man but a poor man this is the
[52:24] super super sign you asked for a sign
[52:27] God said I'll give you a sign a super
[52:30] sign what was the Super sign God
[52:33] manifested in flesh and what is that
[52:35] super sign in this hour God manifested
[52:38] In the Flesh of his bride
[52:41] amen making himself the same yesterday
[52:44] today and
[52:46] forever amen I'll give you one an
[52:49] everlasting son he could have come
[52:51] otherwise as I said a baby but why did
[52:53] he become a baby when that first little
[52:55] toothless mouth opened in the manger on
[52:57] that first Christmas morning in his
[52:59] little manger crib and the first little
[53:01] yell that went from his voice that was
[53:03] God crying Jehovah crying a man come
[53:07] from God and was a man ever WI a man
[53:10] come to the world with nothing but still
[53:12] man what was he trying to do what was he
[53:14] purposing he cried like a baby in the
[53:17] manger he played like a boy on the
[53:18] street he T like a man but yet he was
[53:21] Emmanuel this is the super sign God
[53:24] dwell in in the creation that he created
[53:27] this is the super sign God
[53:30] dwelling in the creation that he
[53:34] created oh my that's the super sign it
[53:38] shall be a sign unto you and on that
[53:40] first Christmas morning what did it do
[53:42] it was an eternal sign to the believer
[53:44] God With Us the super sign he said do
[53:47] you see it God made manifest God
[53:49] presented himself to the world as a
[53:51] fugitive he going to come some other way
[53:53] but he chose to come this way right if
[53:56] there had been no Christmas there would
[53:58] have been no revealing of the name of
[54:03] God Moses said in Deuteronomy the Lord
[54:06] thy God shall raise unto thee a prophet
[54:08] from the midst of thee of thy Brethren
[54:10] liken unto me unto him shall ye hearken
[54:13] but he never gave us his name Isaiah
[54:16] said For unto us a child is born unto us
[54:18] a son is given and the government shall
[54:20] be upon his shoulders and his name Shall
[54:22] be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[54:24] God the everlas Las in Father the Prince
[54:26] of
[54:28] Peace therefore the Lord himself shall
[54:30] give you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[54:32] conceive and bear a son and call his
[54:34] name Emmanuel God With but none of them
[54:37] gave us his name but on that first
[54:40] Christmas what happened an angel came
[54:42] with a message revealing the family name
[54:45] of God behold Thou shalt be conceived in
[54:49] thy womb and bring forth a son and shall
[54:51] call his name Jesus
[54:56] oh that great person of the Lord Jesus
[54:58] he was Jehovah God enveil in flesh the
[55:01] Bible said whatever you do in word
[55:02] indeed do all in his name the Bible said
[55:06] the whole family in heaven it's named
[55:09] Jesus the whole family on Earth it's
[55:11] name Jesus we pray in his name we teach
[55:14] in his name we die in his name we're
[55:16] buried in his name we're baptized in his
[55:18] name resurrected in his name go to
[55:20] heaven in his name that's the name and
[55:23] his bride is named mistress Jesus amen
[55:26] he'll take a people out of the Gentiles
[55:28] for his name's sake and if there had
[55:30] been no Christmas where would we be
[55:33] today where would we be right here at
[55:36] this moment if there had been no
[55:37] Christmas we'd have been alienated from
[55:39] God with no way back that's right lost
[55:45] in the darkness of Le
[55:48] oosa for if there had been no Christmas
[55:51] there would have been no
[55:52] light for Jesus said as long long as I'm
[55:55] in the world I am the light of the
[55:58] world but there but there was a
[56:02] Christmas oh thank
[56:05] God there was a Christmas not a sled not
[56:10] a reindeer not a Santa Claus not a myth
[56:13] not a celebration not a
[56:15] holiday but a reality a promise kelp
[56:19] it's good tidings of great joy what
[56:22] shall be to all people a sacred power of

[56:33] Christmas this year your family might be
[56:35] able to buy you much for Christmas this
[56:37] year but I'm telling you if you can
[56:39] receive what I'm telling you this
[56:40] morning you will receive the greatest
[56:42] gift that anyone could ever receive you
[56:45] don't you don't have to turn it back you
[56:48] don't have to send it back because it
[56:49] don't fit because it's a
[56:51] wrong Hallelujah it'll fit everyone of
[56:56] us amen clothed in his
[57:00] righteousness amen what is Christmas it
[57:03] is the Fulfillment of what God promised
[57:05] Adam in his race he shall bring forth a
[57:08] son and shall call his name Jesus and he
[57:10] shall save his people from their sins
[57:14] and all this was done might it when it
[57:15] might be fulfilled which was spoken of
[57:17] the Lord by the prophet saying bold a
[57:19] virgin shall be with child and shall
[57:20] bring forth a son shall call his name
[57:23] Emmanuel which is interpreted god with
[57:25] us because there is a Christmas there is
[57:28] light there is hope there is peace there
[57:31] is love there is Joy there is a promise
[57:34] for the Hereafter because there is a
[57:37] Christmas there is a
[57:40] Reconciliation you Jesus the Bible says
[57:43] in second Corinthians and all things are
[57:45] are of God who hath reconciled us unto
[57:48] himself by Jesus Christ and have given
[57:51] to us hath given to us the Ministry of
[57:56] reconciliation for if when we were
[57:58] enemies we were reconciled to God by the
[58:01] death of his son much more being
[58:03] reconciled we shall be saved by his life
[58:07] and you that were sometime alienated
[58:09] enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet
[58:12] now hath he reconciled thank you Jesus
[58:16] alienated alienated means to make
[58:19] unfriendly hostile indifferent
[58:21] especially where he was attached forly
[58:26] existed especially where an attachment
[58:29] formally existed you were once attached
[58:33] but you were
[58:35] alienated from the attachment separated
[58:39] how how was we separated by Adam's
[58:43] fall we were alienated separated where
[58:46] we were formerly
[58:48] attached that's why Jesus said all that
[58:51] my father ha given me will come and no
[58:53] man can pluck them out of my hand
[58:57] Amen to reconcile means to completely
[59:00] reconcile the back again to bring back
[59:02] to a formal
[59:04] Harmony that you was once in harmony but
[59:07] you were alienated the fellowship was
[59:09] broke but God said Heath reconciled us
[59:12] through Christ
[59:14] amen and now we can be reattached
[59:17] amen
[59:20] amen hallelujah how could this be
[59:23] accomplished how to be brought back to a
[59:25] formal state of Harmony how could that
[59:28] be because there is a Christmas

[59:35] reconcile us back to
[59:38] himself the three throw mystery God
