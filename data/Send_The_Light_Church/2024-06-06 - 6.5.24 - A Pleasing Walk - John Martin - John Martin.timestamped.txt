[33:49] encourage you to bring your
[33:53] Bibles we were taught by the prophet to
[33:56] check every everything that he spoke
[33:58] with the word because the word is the
[34:00] final
[34:01] Cil
[34:03] amen we're going to read a couple of
[34:07] scriptures verses in Genesis chapter 5
[34:09] and then the second is going to be in
[34:11] Hebrews chapter
[34:13] 11 Hebrews chapter
[34:17] 11 let's look to the Lord in a word of
[34:20] prayer and just ask him
[34:23] to uh open our hearts with re Revelation
[34:28] that he would give us today our heavenly
[34:31] father we come to you humbly as we know
[34:35] how knowing that our total dependency is
[34:39] upon you father we thank you that you
[34:43] have brought us thus far and our our
[34:46] relationship with you that you have kept
[34:50] us we thank you for the keeping power of
[34:53] the Holy
[34:55] Spirit and Lord you have promised us
[34:59] that you would take us all the
[35:02] way sometimes we
[35:04] feel a alone but that's the time that we
[35:09] know to deny our
[35:12] feelings because Thy word says I'll
[35:14] never leave you nor forsake you and that
[35:19] uh is what we're leaning upon Lord we're
[35:21] leaning upon all thy word and so we set
[35:24] aside all of our feelings our thoughts
[35:28] um contrary to your word all of our
[35:31] emotions and Lord we're looking to you
[35:34] tonight would you come and just whisper
[35:38] a word to each of our hearts
[35:41] today Lord that we might draw closer to
[35:47] you and have a greater leading for our
[35:51] lives we ask that you would meet also
[35:55] the needs father that there would be
[35:57] among amongst us and as our brother Ron
[35:59] had said to those that are not here we
[36:03] just pray a special blessing upon them
[36:05] Lord that you would you would meet with
[36:07] them Father and that you would help them
[36:10] and and draw them Close to You Lord we
[36:13] know that we're living in an hour where
[36:16] the spirit is is declaring that there
[36:19] would be is speaking expressively there
[36:22] would be a great falling away and Lord
[36:25] we just pray that that uh fervency and
[36:29] that love and it would continue to grow
[36:32] in our heart that we would draw closer
[36:35] to you in that same time we commit the
[36:39] service to you with all of our needs and
[36:42] we give you praise now for these things
[36:44] in Jesus Christ's holy name
[36:49] amen Genesis chapter 5 starting with
[36:52] verse number
[36:54] 18 the Bible says and Jared live
[36:58] 162 years and he had a baby
[37:02] boy at 162 and his name was Eno
[37:06] amen and Jared lived after he begat
[37:11] Enoch 800
[37:13] years and he begat Sons and Daughters
[37:18] all the days of Jared were
[37:20] 960
[37:22] and2 he
[37:24] died and Enoch lived 60 five years and
[37:28] begat
[37:30] Methuselah and Enoch walked with God
[37:34] after he begat methusa 300 years and
[37:38] begat sons and daughters and all the
[37:40] days of Enoch were
[37:43] 30065
[37:45] years we got 365 days in a year and he
[37:51] he lived
[37:53] 365
[37:54] years and Enoch walked with God God and
[37:58] he was not for God took
[38:02] him amen and then also in the book of
[38:06] Hebrews 11th
[38:10] chapter verses five and six speaking
[38:15] here of
[38:18] Enoch by faith Enoch was
[38:22] translated that he should not see death
[38:25] and was not found because God had
[38:28] translated him and before his
[38:32] translation he had this testimony that
[38:35] he pleased God Amen but without faith
[38:40] it's impossible to please him for he
[38:43] that cometh to God must first believe
[38:45] that he is and that he's a rewarder of
[38:48] them that diligently seek Him amen God
[38:51] bless you may be seated
[38:53] today we want to entitle this message a
[38:56] pleasing walk we we want to talk about
[39:00] Enoch Enoch walked with
[39:05] God for
[39:08] 300
[39:11] years and he went into his own private
[39:16] Rapture that's
[39:17] right and the thing that really caught
[39:21] my
[39:22] attention is what transpired before the
[39:26] rapture
[39:28] the Bible says he had a testimony that
[39:31] he pleased
[39:32] God now we can sometimes foretell what's
[39:36] going to happen right we can predict
[39:38] sometimes the weather if I could say it
[39:40] like
[39:41] that sometimes the we've heard brother
[39:44] brandom talk about the the birds they
[39:46] know when there's a an earthquake coming
[39:49] and a storm and and they they get ready
[39:55] sometimes we can even sense when we're
[39:57] going to have a difficult con
[40:00] conversation with our spouse before it
[40:04] happens uh and and
[40:07] so um before any of us can take a
[40:11] Rapture we've got to have a pleasing
[40:14] walk just like Enoch amen Jude 14 says
[40:19] and Enoch also was the seventh from
[40:23] Heaven prophesied of these saying behold
[40:26] the Lord cometh with 10,000 of his
[40:29] Saints the message the Rapture brother B
[40:32] says now notice Enoch he was the type of
[40:35] the church here he's also typed in the
[40:39] seventh Church age now all the rest of
[40:43] the six men before him they
[40:46] died but Enoch was
[40:49] translated Enoch was Rapture the seventh
[40:52] showing that he's the seventh Church age
[40:54] that takes the Rapture now there's no no
[40:57] doubt we're in the seventh Church age we
[41:00] all know it in the message leadership
[41:03] brother B says look at Enoch he walked
[41:05] with God for 300 years and then he had a
[41:08] testimony that he pleased God and God
[41:11] verified and said there's no need of you
[41:12] dying just come home come up home this
[41:16] afternoon and he went
[41:18] up in the message power of
[41:20] transformation brother BR says Enoch his
[41:23] whole body was transformed Amen to meet
[41:28] a type in God that he was taken to
[41:31] heaven without even seeing death right
[41:36] amen some good some good quotes there
[41:40] about Enoch you know the Bible doesn't
[41:41] say a whole lot about Enoch but you know
[41:44] brother brandom did he said a whole
[41:47] whole lot about him now there's various
[41:49] types of of relationship and he had a a
[41:52] special relationship for sure but we all
[41:56] have some kind of walk with God can you
[41:58] say
[41:59] Amen now some have what I say is a
[42:02] longdistance relationship with God we've
[42:04] heard of you can't have a longdistance
[42:07] relationship with somebody that's
[42:09] overseas or something it it's just hard
[42:11] to have a longdistance relationship well
[42:14] some have a long distance relationship
[42:17] with God they may never openly admit
[42:20] that but they struggle with keeping a
[42:23] daytoday relationship with God right
[42:27] and maybe they get caught up with the
[42:29] cares of
[42:30] life and and and others bury themselves
[42:34] in personal issues their family their
[42:38] work their Hobbies their finances maybe
[42:41] they got a bucket list they just want to
[42:43] they want to do things before uh you
[42:46] know that that the country goes you know
[42:50] too far
[42:51] gone but it seems to be something always
[42:55] keeping them from a closer relationship
[43:00] something keeps them in a longdistance
[43:02] relationship with
[43:04] God some have a a a mediocracy or uh
[43:10] just a a a relationship that's uh Soul
[43:14] so with
[43:15] God they seem to put forth more of an
[43:18] effort to stay involved to stay
[43:21] connected they put more of an effort
[43:23] they have a greater conviction about
[43:25] church
[43:26] attendance they want to help the body
[43:29] but for the most
[43:31] part it's about what they want to get
[43:33] out of the relationship
[43:36] amen and then some have a close
[43:39] relationship with God they're faithful
[43:42] to the things of God they Faithfully
[43:45] communicate with God in prayer and some
[43:47] are even called uh prayer
[43:51] warriors they seem to be steadfast or
[43:53] always abounding in the work of God you
[43:56] can count on them to be there right and
[43:59] it all has to do with a close
[44:02] relationship with God now no matter
[44:05] where we're at in our personal
[44:07] relationship with God I believe with all
[44:11] my heart that there is room for a closer
[44:15] relationship now Enoch exercised
[44:19] daily a relationship where he drew
[44:22] closer to God every
[44:24] day we know the scripture says drawn n
[44:27] to God he'll Draw N to you until one day
[44:30] he was closer to his Heavenly home than
[44:33] he was his own Earthly home right and
[44:36] God just raptured him
[44:39] amen so before Enoch had this great
[44:43] translation he had a wonderful
[44:46] testimony and that he pleased
[44:50] God he had a testimony that we all
[44:53] should be striving for it that we should
[44:56] all be resting into that we should all
[44:58] be fighting for the the the fighting the
[45:02] great fight of Faith amen because it was
[45:05] by faith he was translated it was by
[45:08] faith he went into the Rapture brother
[45:10] bam said in the message only believe he
[45:12] said wouldn't it be nice if we had a
[45:15] testimony like that Brethren wouldn't it
[45:17] be wonderful like Enoch he walked with
[45:20] God 3 years and had a testimony that he
[45:22] pleased God he didn't have to die he
[45:25] just went up he he gives a little
[45:27] illustration here he says so then a
[45:29] little afternoon stro he just started
[45:31] walking out and he just thought well
[45:33] I've been on Earth long enough I'll just
[45:35] walk on up and started by faith he
[45:38] thought well if I've been here long
[45:41] enough I'm kind of tired of being around
[45:42] here I think I'll just Str up and hit
[45:44] the Milky Way and just walk on up knock
[45:47] on the door so that's what he did by
[45:49] faith he did it the Bible said so see he
[45:54] just got
[45:55] tired uh just got tired staying here and
[45:58] he said well I'm just going to go walk
[46:00] up home with God Amen I just went on
[46:04] through the the air walking he did it by
[46:06] faith and the Bible said so so now we're
[46:09] looking we want to look at just some
[46:11] scriptures tonight and just kind of see
[46:14] you know really what it means to walk
[46:16] pleasing to God Amen what what is needed
[46:20] to have a
[46:21] testimony that Enoch
[46:24] had um and I believe that should be the
[46:28] bride's Focus don't you because she's
[46:30] the only one going into the Rapture amen
[46:33] amen I I think everybody else is is
[46:35] content where they're at I I and Enoch
[46:39] was never
[46:40] content he always was pressing for more
[46:45] he never had a revelation you know I'm
[46:50] uh I'm I'm the bride in this hour I'm
[46:52] the I'm the type and I'm going to go in
[46:54] the Rapture you know therefore I'm just
[46:56] going to sit around and wait no every
[46:58] illustration that's given brother
[47:00] brandham said he would just kept walking
[47:02] closer and closer and closer to God
[47:05] until one day he was so close that God
[47:07] said amen giv us the the the the the
[47:11] idea that we had to be doing the same
[47:13] thing because Enoch was a type of this
[47:16] the seventh Church age
[47:19] amen so what is it what is considered a
[47:22] pleasing walk with
[47:25] God would it be
[47:28] to take time out of each
[47:31] day and and and and take a little walk
[47:34] with God as we would maybe taking our
[47:37] our dog for a
[47:39] walk would that be
[47:42] it yesterday I I went on a two mile walk
[47:46] with my son
[47:48] Jonathan and uh trying to exercise and I
[47:52] uh that that was a
[47:54] walk some people go for a walk every day
[47:58] amen is this the kind of walk that God
[48:02] is looking for because Enoch walked with
[48:05] God the Bible says is it just a casual
[48:09] stroll with him the Bible says that
[48:12] Enoch walked with God
[48:14] 300
[48:16] years and let me just say this he held
[48:19] his testimony amen he held his testimony
[48:22] that he pleased God am brother Bram says
[48:25] this in the message questions and
[48:27] answers on the seals he says now notice
[48:30] Moses only served God for 40
[48:33] years he was a 120
[48:36] years the first 40 years he was getting
[48:38] his
[48:39] education the second 40 years God was
[48:42] taking it out of
[48:43] him and the third 40 years he served God
[48:47] right he said all right but Enoch walked
[48:51] with God 300 years before God and was
[48:56] blamed
[48:59] he was just trying to show a type you
[49:02] know Moses did serve God for 40 years
[49:05] but look at Enoch 300 years and he was
[49:08] blameless amen that's a pretty strong
[49:12] word don't you think I just need you to
[49:14] go with me
[49:16] here
[49:18] blameless not responsible for
[49:22] anything that's what it means he could
[49:25] not be accused of wrongdoing or wrong
[49:28] acting he was IR
[49:31] reproachable he was Guiltless he was
[49:35] innocent 300 years is a long time to
[49:38] walk with God and to remain blameless
[49:41] don't you think amen amen and I I'm not
[49:44] trying to set a stage for an impossible
[49:47] walk for us I am not trying to do that
[49:50] don't want to do that but what I do want
[49:52] to do is place before you what we should
[49:56] be driving for there's a difference now
[50:00] Phil Philippians chap 2:12 if you turn
[50:02] with me there Philippians chapter 2
[50:05] starting with verse number
[50:07] 12 what does it mean to walk pleasing
[50:10] what does it mean to walk blamelessly
[50:11] wherefore my beloved as ye have always
[50:16] obeyed not in my presence
[50:19] only but now much more in my absence
[50:23] work out your own salvation
[50:27] with fear and trembling see a lot of
[50:29] people think they don't have to work
[50:31] anything out right right right they
[50:34] think they they quote they Jesus Paid It
[50:37] all he went to Calvary it's not by works
[50:41] right and they got this kind of format
[50:44] to where you don't really have to do
[50:46] anything right un not really lacking
[50:50] really what the relationship is all
[50:53] about but but Paul talks to the
[50:55] Philippians here what's going on he says
[50:57] for it is God which worketh in you both
[51:03] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[51:07] amen amen so what do we actually
[51:12] work what do we actually do what is the
[51:16] work that we're supposed to do we're
[51:17] supposed to listen to God Amen we're
[51:20] supposed to do what he's telling us on
[51:22] the inside right
[51:24] right if we just ignore that then we're
[51:29] ignoring him preparing a place for him
[51:32] to live in when he comes
[51:34] back that's the truth I I want us to get
[51:37] that Revelation he goes to prepare a
[51:39] place for
[51:41] us he's working his he's building the
[51:45] building inside of us amen amen now the
[51:51] first thing he says here he says do all
[51:53] things without murmuring and disputing
[51:55] right
[51:58] in other words when God tells you to do
[52:00] something just do it
[52:05] amen fear the lord tremble when he
[52:08] speaks to you
[52:10] amen don't
[52:12] murmur do all things without
[52:16] grumbling without grudging without
[52:20] uttering
[52:22] dissatisfaction now notice it doesn't
[52:24] say do some things
[52:28] it doesn't say do most things it doesn't
[52:31] even
[52:33] say you're allowed to complain when you
[52:35] think things are really
[52:39] bad if you want to be
[52:41] blameless do not murmur do not
[52:46] complain disputings are discussions
[52:49] accompanied with debate and
[52:52] disagreement Y and the Bible says do all
[52:56] things without it that's right why now
[53:00] notice there's a CO in there
[53:03] right and look at the next verse that
[53:06] you may be
[53:08] blameless that you may be harmless the
[53:12] sons of God without
[53:17] rebuke just like
[53:19] Enoch just like Enoch blameless means
[53:23] irreproachable and faultless right
[53:26] harmless means safe gentle mild
[53:31] wholesome God wants us to be gentle amen
[53:36] mild
[53:38] wholesome look we got all got reasons
[53:41] for acting and talking the way we do
[53:46] right and that's that's fine but if you
[53:49] want to meet up with going into a
[53:52] rapture we got a standard to hold to
[53:55] amen and that's just all there is to it
[53:58] amen this this message is not for
[54:00] everybody this message does not make a a
[54:05] a a
[54:07] um a a foolish virgin make the Rapture
[54:12] right look if we don't get the oil of
[54:15] the Holy Ghost we're not going in this
[54:17] message is only for the Bride of Jesus
[54:20] Christ amen
[54:23] amen that ye may be blameless
[54:26] and harmless the sons of God without
[54:30] rebuke in the midst of a crooked and
[54:35] perverse
[54:36] Nation among whom you shine as lights in
[54:39] the world you know a lot of time we'll
[54:41] start mumbling and complaining because
[54:43] we're staring at something that we don't
[54:45] think is right right that's not fair
[54:48] that's not right that shouldn't happen
[54:50] the governor should have did this the
[54:52] township my neighbor shouldn't have done
[54:53] this we've got a reason yeah
[54:57] yeah to murmur and
[55:00] complain and Paul is telling us I expect
[55:05] you to be blameless and harmless in the
[55:08] midst of a rotten Nation right that's as
[55:12] perverse as I expect you to shine as a
[55:15] light amen amen holding forth the Word
[55:21] of
[55:21] Life in other words even though wrong is
[55:25] being done to you even though harm is
[55:27] coming at you you don't murmur you don't
[55:30] complain you live the word of God right
[55:34] amen amen that that I may rejoice in the
[55:40] day of Christ now we're talking about a
[55:41] Rapture right I mean we're all the the
[55:44] bride is waiting for the
[55:49] Rapture we're waiting for the coming of
[55:51] the Lord amen amen that I may rejoice in
[55:54] the day of Christ that I have not run in
[55:57] vain neither labored in vain now some of
[56:00] us may see well brother John I just
[56:03] can't do
[56:06] that well I will say we've got to
[56:10] straighten up that
[56:14] first
[56:16] amen it it's by faith that Enoch was
[56:20] translated if we don't believe that the
[56:24] Holy Ghost Inside of us has power enough
[56:27] to let us live that word then we need to
[56:29] get back to the ABCs with Christ amen we
[56:33] need to get back to the altar get filled
[56:36] with the Holy Ghost and just start
[56:38] trusting God that we can live this word
[56:40] because we've got to work out our own
[56:43] salvation with fear and trembling you
[56:45] can't wait till the whole nation is
[56:47] doing better before you're going to
[56:49] start living right
[56:52] right we've got to believe what the
[56:54] Bible says
[56:57] for it is God which worketh in us to do
[57:02] of his good
[57:03] pleasure amen turn with me if you would
[57:05] to Romans chapter
[57:07] 8 Romans chapter 8 the we can't live the
[57:13] word on our own amen but when the Holy
[57:17] Ghost comes inside and we yield to the
[57:20] Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost can
[57:22] literally things can be falling apart
[57:25] around you and you won't murmur and you
[57:27] won't complain amen because that's the
[57:30] power of the Holy Ghost God is not going
[57:32] to ask you to do something that he would
[57:34] do right in other words the Holy Ghost
[57:36] doesn't murmur and doesn't
[57:38] complain Romans chapter 8
[57:42] ver7 because the carnal mind is emnity
[57:45] against God for it is not subject to the
[57:47] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[57:49] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[57:51] God obviously Enoch was not in the flesh
[57:55] because he had a testimony that he
[57:57] pleased God right so when we're in the
[58:00] flesh we we're not having the same
[58:03] testimony I mean this is important to me
[58:07] I believe the bride serves God
[58:11] 247 it's not a couple times a week or
[58:15] when it's convenient it's they're
[58:17] serving God with all their
[58:19] heart he says but ye are not in the
[58:22] flesh but in the spirit if
[58:26] so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[58:28] you now if any man have not the spirit
[58:31] of Christ he is none of
[58:33] his okay so we all believe we have the
[58:36] spirit of God in us
[58:37] amen amen but now look the Bible holds
[58:41] us accountable and if the if Christ be
[58:45] in you the body is dead because of sin
[58:50] in other words you're not going to be
[58:51] murmuring complaining right come on cuz
[58:54] it's dead amen
[58:56] but the spirit is life because of
[58:59] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[59:00] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[59:02] dwells in you he that raised up Christ
[59:04] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[59:06] moral Body by the spirit that dwelleth
[59:08] in you so you can you can go through
[59:11] life without murmuring complaining
[59:16] am well I'm having a hard time okay
[59:18] spend time seeking
[59:21] God don't try to be the first one to not
[59:25] murmur and complain without the Holy
[59:28] Ghost don't try to try to live this word
[59:31] be the first one to live the word
[59:33] without the Holy Ghost Inside you it
[59:35] won't work amen it won't work in the
[59:39] message the Easter seal brother ramam
[59:41] says the same power that raised up Jesus
[59:44] from the dead if it dwells in your
[59:45] mortal body see all right notice he said
[59:48] let's take another man with this
[59:50] quickening
[59:51] power there was a man Way Long Ago by
[59:55] the name of Enoch when a new thing came
[59:58] along when something come along and said
[1:00:01] well now we have to go back to the old
[1:00:04] school of this or that or the other
[1:00:06] Enoch walked with God right whatever God
[1:00:10] said do Enoch never missed one
[1:00:15] word he walked with God what was it he
[1:00:19] was a Son of God he was an eagle that
[1:00:22] had been called to that day yeah and
[1:00:25] when when come time he was so full of
[1:00:29] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:31] remember he had walked 300 years or more
[1:00:36] before God and not one time had he
[1:00:40] missed his
[1:00:43] word now I'm telling you to
[1:00:48] me that ought to challenge us to the
[1:00:52] core not one time did he miss behave
[1:00:57] himself not one time did he do but kept
[1:01:02] the testimony everything that God told
[1:01:05] him to do he went and he done it no
[1:01:08] argument about it he just went and done
[1:01:11] it no matter what anybody else thought
[1:01:13] he just went and done it why he was full
[1:01:16] of the quickening power amen and when it
[1:01:19] come time for the old man to die God
[1:01:21] just said down just sent down the ladder
[1:01:24] and he walked on up home right he
[1:01:27] quickened him amen and took his mortal
[1:01:30] body up in a Rapture amen that's the
[1:01:33] quickening power
[1:01:36] right it's a type for us it's a type for
[1:01:42] us see most people Satan has programmed
[1:01:47] most people to grade on a
[1:01:51] curve in other words you're going to be
[1:01:54] okay as long as you're not in a
[1:01:58] denomination as long as you're in the
[1:02:00] message you know you're
[1:02:03] safe but you can't find that in the
[1:02:07] message you just you just hear the him
[1:02:11] in the message saying come out of her
[1:02:13] and be not partakers of her
[1:02:16] sins but look you can take a pig out of
[1:02:20] the mud and put him in the most
[1:02:22] beautiful area but when he gets out of
[1:02:25] church and goes back and lives his own
[1:02:28] way and he's got Liberty to do what he's
[1:02:29] want he's going to go right back and do
[1:02:31] the things that pleases his flesh amen
[1:02:34] so just because we say we're in the
[1:02:36] message we belong to a message chuth it
[1:02:38] doesn't mean we're lining up with with
[1:02:42] with what
[1:02:43] Enoch testimony that Enoch had amen now
[1:02:48] the reward of a pleasing walk comes at
[1:02:51] the end of our walk I need I need us to
[1:02:53] remember that a lot of times you know we
[1:02:55] got to be rewarded real quick you know
[1:02:58] the
[1:02:59] Pharisees they needed a reward real
[1:03:02] quick that's why they they prayed long
[1:03:05] prayers in in front they wanted to make
[1:03:07] everybody know they were fasting that
[1:03:10] they were uh paying their their their
[1:03:13] ties that they were giving they were
[1:03:14] doing all this stuff because they needed
[1:03:16] a quick
[1:03:19] reward they wanted the you know
[1:03:21] recognition from
[1:03:23] others but the bride knows her reward
[1:03:25] towards at the
[1:03:28] end and I want us to keep our eyes fixed
[1:03:32] on that just be faithful to God be
[1:03:34] faithful to the word the Rapture is
[1:03:37] going to happen if you remain faithful
[1:03:39] amen BR said the in the message uh the
[1:03:42] first seal in the first seal he said
[1:03:45] Enoch was translated without death the
[1:03:47] type of the church being caught up with
[1:03:49] those who are asleep to meet the Lord in
[1:03:51] the air and the rest of the church is
[1:03:53] carried over into the tribulation period
[1:03:56] can't make nothing else out of it myself
[1:03:59] Enoch raptured no death and the rest of
[1:04:02] the Dead lived not for a thousand years
[1:04:05] there you are they went through the
[1:04:07] tribulation period so everybody didn't
[1:04:10] hold the testimony think of the foolish
[1:04:12] version they didn't please God they
[1:04:15] might have lived good clean lives but to
[1:04:17] be honest with you they didn't please
[1:04:19] God not in everything because if you
[1:04:22] want to if you really want to please God
[1:04:24] get serious about getting the Holy Ghost
[1:04:25] ghost amen that's what really pleases
[1:04:28] God because now he's able to live inside
[1:04:30] of you and take control of your life
[1:04:33] call the shots amen we're born by the
[1:04:36] will of God to do the will of God we no
[1:04:38] longer have a say of what we're going to
[1:04:40] do with our
[1:04:41] life brother Braham said in the message
[1:04:43] things are to be he said how much more
[1:04:46] abler is he to get it he's a Creator now
[1:04:52] think about how able he is to Pro
[1:04:55] prepare us a body now he's speaking
[1:04:59] about making us fit and
[1:05:03] ready he's talking about his ability to
[1:05:05] get us ready to prepare us a body to
[1:05:08] live like his own glorious body if we
[1:05:12] want to live there is something in us
[1:05:15] cause us to live Now understand we have
[1:05:17] a glorious body that's awaiting us flesh
[1:05:21] and blood is not going to enter the
[1:05:23] kingdom but understand what's happen
[1:05:25] happening in this body is there's a
[1:05:28] development of character that is not a
[1:05:30] gift it doesn't come with church
[1:05:33] attendance it is something that you
[1:05:36] learn on a daily basis to bring this
[1:05:39] flesh under
[1:05:40] control to not let it have its way to
[1:05:43] die out and you yield yourself to God if
[1:05:47] the Bible says do all things without
[1:05:48] murmuring complain you walk out of the
[1:05:50] church and you say Lord help me never to
[1:05:52] murmur and complain again am and when
[1:05:55] you face your first trial and that
[1:05:57] thought comes to you
[1:06:00] you what's happening is character is
[1:06:03] being molded in you but if you just go
[1:06:07] through that test and you try to prove
[1:06:09] the other person's wrong and you
[1:06:10] wouldn't have to do this if they didn't
[1:06:11] do that you don't not have you're not
[1:06:14] building your character
[1:06:16] right what you're doing is you're
[1:06:18] delaying an opportunity for God to build
[1:06:21] inside of you
[1:06:23] amen now there's there is something in
[1:06:27] us that cause us to live and there's
[1:06:30] something in us that cause us to do
[1:06:32] right then God will call somebody on the
[1:06:35] platform or the pulpit and they will
[1:06:38] preach the absolute truth why see it
[1:06:41] shows you then if you're a real child of
[1:06:43] God and you begin to cry out God take it
[1:06:46] away from me circumcise me of this take
[1:06:50] these things away from me
[1:06:52] why it's needed for for your heavenly
[1:06:57] home that you're going to where where
[1:07:00] he's gone to prepare you've got to be a
[1:07:03] real word bride of Christ amen now this
[1:07:07] is so profound to me he said it's needed
[1:07:11] for your heavenly home amen you got to
[1:07:16] get this thing out of you for your
[1:07:18] heavenly home
[1:07:20] right you've got to be serious with the
[1:07:23] things that God speaks to your heart
[1:07:25] amen
[1:07:27] that it it's it's it's no longer just
[1:07:29] coming to church to hear something new
[1:07:31] to hear something it's about you
[1:07:34] becoming
[1:07:37] Christ and there is a part right there
[1:07:39] is a part where we've got to recognize
[1:07:42] who we are but there's another part that
[1:07:46] if we truly do recognize who we are that
[1:07:49] we've got to separate we can't let our
[1:07:51] flesh have its way amen so there is a
[1:07:54] part we can play in that's why I love
[1:07:56] this quote because he's he's gone on to
[1:07:59] prepare he's got you've got to be a real
[1:08:02] word
[1:08:03] bride of Christ not just say I'm bride
[1:08:07] without the word in the message the
[1:08:10] seventh seal brother Ram says the
[1:08:11] kingdom of God is
[1:08:13] coming and it's becoming more from the
[1:08:16] negative to the positive remember
[1:08:19] Brother Bruce sharing a little bit of
[1:08:21] that it's becoming more from the
[1:08:24] negative to the positive
[1:08:27] as it has been
[1:08:31] now that ought to choke
[1:08:34] people he said that ought to choke
[1:08:37] people from justification to
[1:08:39] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:41] Ghost and then here here we're just
[1:08:45] drawing closer to God all the time
[1:08:50] amen I don't know what that means to you
[1:08:54] when I went to high schol school and
[1:08:56] they tried to teach me
[1:08:59] about you name
[1:09:02] it science
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:07] math that is not the way that you get
[1:09:13] closer is to
[1:09:16] knowledge you get closer to God by a
[1:09:21] relationship see I can sit and I can get
[1:09:23] all the knowledge in the world and never
[1:09:25] obey God
[1:09:27] Amen never do what he tells me to do
[1:09:30] amen but be filled with
[1:09:37] knowledge
[1:09:39] God is wanting us to draw closer to him
[1:09:42] all the time
[1:09:45] Enoch he had a vision for Walking with
[1:09:48] God the vision was so real to him
[1:09:52] because it was by faith that he was
[1:09:54] going to be raptured he he knew he was
[1:09:56] going to be raptured amen that he
[1:09:59] decided that I need to walk closer to
[1:10:01] God every day and so he dedicated
[1:10:04] himself to God every day it it it was
[1:10:07] more real to him because you got to
[1:10:09] understand there were other people that
[1:10:10] lived during the time of Enoch amen they
[1:10:13] didn't all get
[1:10:18] raptured Enoch is the type of the Bride
[1:10:21] today the bride in this age I believe
[1:10:23] she has a vision to to walk with God
[1:10:26] closer and closer every day Enoch wasn't
[1:10:30] just some some special person he was
[1:10:33] like extra talented or uh spiritually
[1:10:36] gifted or or or or he was more popular
[1:10:39] than everybody else the thing that made
[1:10:42] him so special is that he had a love
[1:10:45] relationship with God Amen he really
[1:10:48] loved God it was just the bottom line it
[1:10:50] was the it was the foundation of what he
[1:10:52] did right he just loved God
[1:10:56] and I think it takes real love to draw
[1:10:58] closer to God why is that because our
[1:11:00] flesh does not want to do what he tells
[1:11:02] us to do our flesh would rather murmur
[1:11:05] and complain dos and don'ts got to do
[1:11:07] this got to do that why can't I you know
[1:11:09] I'm free from all that you're not free
[1:11:12] from obeying God
[1:11:16] Amen so it takes real love to draw
[1:11:19] closer to God brother baham said in the
[1:11:22] message the unfailing realities of the
[1:11:24] Living God he says you want to belong in
[1:11:28] heaven that's where your affections
[1:11:30] ought to be then see on the things above
[1:11:33] the Bible says set your affections on
[1:11:35] things above not on the things of the
[1:11:37] earth now I know we're all busy we got
[1:11:39] jobs but where's your
[1:11:44] affection they're going to fail stay
[1:11:47] with God stay with the realities God is
[1:11:52] a god of
[1:11:54] reality he has always been in all ages
[1:11:57] anytime that man ever walked with God
[1:12:00] God became a reality amen and that
[1:12:03] reality performs signs and wonders and
[1:12:05] miracles with his people I want to get
[1:12:10] so real with God that I have the same
[1:12:12] testimony that Enoch had and I believe
[1:12:16] I'm going to have to press every day to
[1:12:18] get it amen here's the secret to Enoch's
[1:12:22] translation he worked hard very very
[1:12:25] hard every day I'm pleasing
[1:12:29] God you got to work at
[1:12:31] it you got to work hard on
[1:12:34] it you know we're so
[1:12:36] used to to hearing the word and not
[1:12:41] doing it you know become hearers of the
[1:12:43] word and not doers right because look
[1:12:47] just just to be honest with you you're
[1:12:49] going to you're going to hear from God
[1:12:50] you're going to leave church and you're
[1:12:52] not going to get
[1:12:53] spanked right right you're not going to
[1:12:56] get a flat tire on the way home you're
[1:12:59] not going to get um some bad things
[1:13:02] going to
[1:13:03] happen because God lets his children be
[1:13:09] disobedient if that's what they want to
[1:13:12] do but I'm telling you as the Bride of
[1:13:15] Jesus
[1:13:16] Christ she don't want to be
[1:13:21] disobedient so she is attentive
[1:13:25] this morning I was driving I was going
[1:13:28] to say driving to work but I wasn't
[1:13:29] because I was driving to get my coffee
[1:13:30] then come back and go to work and it was
[1:13:33] behind the semi and it said be
[1:13:36] attentive and I believe the bride is
[1:13:41] attentive she's sensitive to what the
[1:13:44] Holy Spirit would speak to him
[1:13:50] amen all
[1:13:51] right so we want to work real hard at
[1:13:54] that Enoch believed that if he sought
[1:13:58] the Lord
[1:14:00] daily that God would draw closer to him
[1:14:03] that was the faith that he had the Bible
[1:14:05] says that that Enoch believed that he
[1:14:09] when he came to God that God would
[1:14:11] reward him because he was diligently
[1:14:14] seeking him not just once in a while see
[1:14:17] if we only try once in a while just a
[1:14:19] few times a week you know we're going to
[1:14:22] really try with God he's not going to
[1:14:24] reward you
[1:14:26] because that doesn't line up with the
[1:14:27] word
[1:14:29] diligent diligent is diligent now we're
[1:14:31] talking about
[1:14:33] bride it's a whole different set of
[1:14:36] circumstances when we're talking about
[1:14:38] foolish
[1:14:40] virgins turn with me if you would to
[1:14:42] James chapter
[1:14:44] 4 how do I work hard at pleasing God
[1:14:49] James chter 4 the Bible says that God
[1:14:54] gives more GR Grace wherefore he saith
[1:14:57] in verse six God he resists the proud
[1:15:01] but gives Grace unto the humble
[1:15:05] amen you think about all the evil that's
[1:15:07] done in the world right now all the
[1:15:09] people that kill people and they rob
[1:15:12] people and they steal millions of
[1:15:14] dollars of government money and you know
[1:15:16] we all watch the news or heard the news
[1:15:19] and things are happening the there's
[1:15:21] shootings and all these things happen
[1:15:23] and people get away with it
[1:15:27] right and it's wrong but God allows so
[1:15:31] many people to get away from it get away
[1:15:33] with it for a time being you understand
[1:15:36] a time being well don't you think he's
[1:15:39] going to let Believers leave the church
[1:15:41] after hearing the word of God and kind
[1:15:43] of brush it off as it's not no big thing
[1:15:45] and they don't feel that
[1:15:48] conviction why don't they feel that
[1:15:51] conviction because they got a distant
[1:15:53] relationship with the Lord
[1:15:55] it's not real sensitive it's not real
[1:15:58] tender it's like if if if the word isn't
[1:16:01] given to me like this presented like
[1:16:02] this and it makes me feel like this then
[1:16:05] you know what I'm just not going to take
[1:16:10] it do all things without murmuring and
[1:16:13] complaining right amen Enoch received
[1:16:16] more grace than anybody else because he
[1:16:18] was only one
[1:16:19] raptured every there was others that
[1:16:21] received Grace but he received Grace to
[1:16:24] to to go into a Rapture not everybody's
[1:16:27] receiving that
[1:16:29] Grace just those just the
[1:16:33] bride she's going to receive more grace
[1:16:36] than the
[1:16:37] others now the Bible says that he gives
[1:16:41] this grace to the humble so Enoch he
[1:16:43] must have walked
[1:16:48] humbly amen because he walked with God
[1:16:51] 300
[1:16:53] years well the Bible says that God
[1:16:56] inhabits eternity he's the high and
[1:16:58] lofty one but he also dwells with him
[1:17:00] that is of a humble and contrite spirit
[1:17:03] so he does dwell with the
[1:17:06] humble Enoch must have walked
[1:17:09] humbly now I tell you all we got to do
[1:17:12] is just take a second and be honest with
[1:17:13] yourself do we walk
[1:17:15] humbly don't say I walk humbly than this
[1:17:18] brother I walk humbly than this sister
[1:17:21] that's not what I'm asking you
[1:17:27] well let's let's continue reading here
[1:17:30] submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:17:33] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:17:36] you know the devil's the one that's
[1:17:37] telling you to murmur and
[1:17:42] complain he's trying to get youall
[1:17:44] worked up just submit yourself to God
[1:17:47] let it go draw nigh to God and he'll
[1:17:51] draw nigh to
[1:17:52] you cleanse your hands purify your
[1:17:56] hearts ye double-minded be afflicted and
[1:17:59] mourn and weep let your laughter be
[1:18:01] turned to mourning and your joy to
[1:18:02] Heaven is in other words get serious
[1:18:04] about drawing n to God get serious
[1:18:09] amen like it's okay that the whole
[1:18:11] church World wants to go to church and
[1:18:13] be entertained it's okay for them but
[1:18:17] it's not for the
[1:18:19] bride no humble yourselves in the sight
[1:18:22] of the Lord and He will lift you up
[1:18:26] right Enoch got lifted up
[1:18:29] amen amen I believe he humbled himself
[1:18:34] he put on clothes of humility amen he
[1:18:37] dressed every day and he didn't say well
[1:18:39] as long as everything is right with me
[1:18:41] then I'm going to be humble and if not
[1:18:43] I'm going to put you in your
[1:18:45] place I don't visualize Enoch putting
[1:18:48] people in their
[1:18:50] place I believe he believed the word
[1:18:53] which Vengeance belong to God God takes
[1:18:55] care of things we got a job to do do it
[1:18:59] without murmuring do it without
[1:19:00] complaining I mean we look at the
[1:19:02] government I tell you you you don't got
[1:19:04] to look far to know that there's so much
[1:19:08] terrible things that it's easy to murmur
[1:19:10] and complain about the government but I
[1:19:11] don't believe we have scripture to
[1:19:13] murmur and complain about the government
[1:19:14] I don't as bad as it is we
[1:19:22] shouldn't it's you know you got who are
[1:19:25] you you got to
[1:19:27] be what Christ is looking
[1:19:30] for Christ is not looking for a
[1:19:35] spokesman who's going to speak
[1:19:38] out at all the wrong
[1:19:44] politicians he's wanting us to represent
[1:19:46] him
[1:19:48] amen if people want to represent on that
[1:19:52] side right and wrong that's her
[1:19:57] business but the bride she is focused on
[1:20:00] becoming the word that's her
[1:20:05] Focus let's take a look at some
[1:20:08] scriptures here on what it really means
[1:20:11] to put clothes of humility on in
[1:20:13] Ephesians chapter 4
[1:20:15] verse1 Ephesians chapter 4 verse1 I I
[1:20:20] Paul said therefore the prisoner of the
[1:20:24] Lord can you can imagine being a
[1:20:25] prisoner of the Lord he set you free and
[1:20:28] you're a
[1:20:32] prisoner the prisoner of the Lord
[1:20:34] beseech
[1:20:36] you that you walk worthy of the calling
[1:20:42] wherewith you are
[1:20:45] called so in other words many are called
[1:20:48] few are chosen right and there's many
[1:20:52] people not even in this message who say
[1:20:56] they're walking with God and they got a
[1:20:58] close
[1:20:59] relationship but you look at their lives
[1:21:02] and it doesn't take long to see that
[1:21:04] it's not lined up with the word
[1:21:08] amen so Paul was saying look walk
[1:21:13] worthy amen walk worthy compare yourself
[1:21:16] with the word and then he goes on and he
[1:21:19] describes what that is with all
[1:21:23] loneliness
[1:21:25] and
[1:21:27] meekness with
[1:21:28] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[1:21:32] love you just take that one
[1:21:34] verse and you don't even have to go 24
[1:21:38] hours and you can be tested with that
[1:21:40] verse right there to see whether you got
[1:21:43] the clothes of humility on Amen one day
[1:21:47] 24 hours and you'll be tested every one
[1:21:50] of us on that amen
[1:21:56] so I can see where this this comes into
[1:21:58] play do all things without murmuring and
[1:22:01] complaining because if you're going to
[1:22:03] be
[1:22:03] longsuffering you're not going to murmur
[1:22:05] and complain if you're truly going to be
[1:22:08] longsuffering you don't want to murmur
[1:22:10] and complain and say okay that don't
[1:22:13] work with all loneliness with all
[1:22:15] meekness with longsuffering forbearing
[1:22:17] one another love endeavoring to keep the
[1:22:19] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[1:22:22] right now it is so easy easy with me to
[1:22:27] keep Unity with brother
[1:22:30] Ron just for a
[1:22:34] second because brother Ron the only
[1:22:36] thing he's wanting to do is is is is is
[1:22:39] is please me is help me is work with
[1:22:43] me but now
[1:22:45] Bob Bob he's got a problem with
[1:22:49] everything that I practically
[1:22:52] do I can say you you know what I would I
[1:22:55] I I would have no problem having Unity
[1:22:58] with Bob but there's something wrong
[1:22:59] with
[1:23:00] Bob and that's how we all look at at
[1:23:03] whether we're going to try with Bob or
[1:23:06] not but reality if God is in you you'll
[1:23:09] follow the scripture with Bob right you
[1:23:14] will because because the Bible says it
[1:23:17] says ende
[1:23:19] deing trying trying putting forth effort
[1:23:23] working
[1:23:25] now the Bible says live peace be with
[1:23:26] all men as much that lies within you
[1:23:29] that's true but you that doesn't mean
[1:23:31] you don't work anymore you try you
[1:23:36] work because that's the Holy
[1:23:39] Ghost it's not you saying well yeah you
[1:23:42] know I don't know if I look just the
[1:23:44] Holy Ghost doesn't sit there and debate
[1:23:46] the word brother brandham said e
[1:23:48] whatever God told Enoch to do he just
[1:23:51] did it he didn't murmur he didn't
[1:23:53] complain he didn't wrestle with it he
[1:23:56] just went and did it amen and you're
[1:23:58] really free if you can do that right
[1:24:02] you're really free of yourself if you
[1:24:03] can just do it he said there's one body
[1:24:06] one Spirit even as you're called into
[1:24:09] one hope of your calling all right
[1:24:13] Philippians chapter 1 verse 27 we're
[1:24:15] going to have to go quick only let your
[1:24:18] conversation be as becometh the gospel
[1:24:22] of Christ now think about your whole
[1:24:23] conversation not just a part that you
[1:24:27] are thinking about but think about all
[1:24:28] of
[1:24:29] it that whether I come and see you or be
[1:24:32] absent I may hear of your
[1:24:36] Affairs that ye stand fast in one Spirit
[1:24:39] one mind striving together for the faith
[1:24:42] of the Gospel now remember Enoch had a
[1:24:47] testimony that he pleased
[1:24:50] God and Paul talking to the Philippian
[1:24:53] church he says I want to hear of your
[1:24:55] Affairs I want to hear a good
[1:25:00] report that you're you're standing fast
[1:25:03] in one Spirit that's the holy
[1:25:05] spirit with one mind the mind of Christ
[1:25:09] striving together for the faith of the
[1:25:14] Gospel now if we put that on our
[1:25:17] responsibility to do that with every one
[1:25:19] of us I think we have a good testimony
[1:25:23] amen I think we're following the
[1:25:25] testimony of Enoch all right Colossians
[1:25:28] chapter
[1:25:32] 1 verse number seven Colossians chapter
[1:25:35] 1 verse 7 as ye have learned
[1:25:38] eaus and our dear our dear fellow
[1:25:42] servant who is for you a faithful
[1:25:44] minister of Christ who also declared
[1:25:47] unto us your love in the spirit so this
[1:25:52] minister is he declared uh onto Paul
[1:25:57] that that they had a real love in the
[1:26:01] spirit they were manifesting the love in
[1:26:03] the spirit he said for this cause we ALS
[1:26:06] for this cause we also since the day we
[1:26:08] heard of it we heard this report of you
[1:26:10] we do not cease to pray for you you know
[1:26:13] what we're also Desiring that you would
[1:26:16] be filled with the knowledge of his will
[1:26:19] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:26:22] understanding you mean to tell me it's
[1:26:24] not good enough that I'm just I got this
[1:26:26] testimony of of of of of of the love of
[1:26:30] the
[1:26:32] spirit you still got to pray for me and
[1:26:35] and desire that I be filled with with
[1:26:37] with with the knowledge of his
[1:26:41] will that you might walk worthy of the
[1:26:45] Lord unto all
[1:26:48] pleasing wow I I'm I'm looking here at a
[1:26:51] pretty high standard here I I don't see
[1:26:54] Paul saying hey look you got enough just
[1:26:56] stay where you're at that you might walk
[1:27:00] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing
[1:27:03] just like Enoch being fruitful in every
[1:27:05] good work and increasing in the
[1:27:07] knowledge of God strengthen with all
[1:27:10] might according to his glorious gospel
[1:27:13] unto all patience and longsuffering with
[1:27:16] joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father
[1:27:20] which have made us meat to be partakers
[1:27:22] of the inheritance
[1:27:24] of the Saints and light who delivered us
[1:27:26] from the power of darkness and have
[1:27:27] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:27:30] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[1:27:33] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[1:27:35] of sins so I believe before we're going
[1:27:37] to be translated we need to get
[1:27:40] translated into the word of
[1:27:45] God before our bodies are going to be
[1:27:47] taken we've got to get our character
[1:27:50] translated into this word we need to
[1:27:53] become more ser ious about this and
[1:27:55] spend time daily seeking the Lord God
[1:27:59] let me be like you give me the testimony
[1:28:01] that Enoch Lord I I want to find favor
[1:28:04] with you I believe that is the prayer of
[1:28:07] the
[1:28:08] Bride I do because I don't believe the
[1:28:11] bride is just gonna float
[1:28:14] there she's not going to float in she's
[1:28:16] going to keep pressing
[1:28:22] in yeah I want you to write write this
[1:28:24] one down give you some homework
[1:28:27] Ephesians 5: 1-1
[1:28:32] 17 I'm just going to read the two verses
[1:28:34] first two verses be ye therefore
[1:28:36] followers of
[1:28:38] God as dear children so this is what a
[1:28:41] follower of God does and walk in love as
[1:28:44] Christ also loved us and gave himself
[1:28:47] for an offering and a sacrifice to God
[1:28:49] for a sweet smelling savior now you go
[1:28:52] in there and you'll see what it Paul is
[1:28:54] trying to tell the Ephesian Church to do
[1:28:56] how to walk pleasing unto God all right
[1:29:00] 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:29:06] 2 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse number
[1:29:09] eight says so being affectionate
[1:29:11] desirous of you we were willing to have
[1:29:14] imparted unto you not only the gospel of
[1:29:18] uh not the gospel of God only but also
[1:29:22] our own Souls
[1:29:24] because you were dear unto
[1:29:27] us that's that's a love isn't it that's
[1:29:31] love for you remember Brethren our labor
[1:29:34] our travail for laboring night and day
[1:29:37] because we would not be chargeable unto
[1:29:40] any of you we preached unto you the
[1:29:43] gospel of God and your Witnesses and God
[1:29:46] also how holy how
[1:29:49] justly and unblameable we behave saved
[1:29:55] ourselves among you that
[1:30:00] believe wow what a
[1:30:03] testimony Paul had a great testimony as
[1:30:06] ye know how we exhorted and comforted
[1:30:10] and charged every one of you as a father
[1:30:12] does his own children that you walk
[1:30:14] worthy of God who have called you unto
[1:30:19] his kingdom and glory for this cause
[1:30:22] also thank we god without ceasing
[1:30:26] because when you receive the word of God
[1:30:28] which he heard of us you received it not
[1:30:31] as the word of men but as it is TR the
[1:30:35] word of God which effectually works
[1:30:38] worketh also in you that
[1:30:43] believe the word don't work if you don't

[1:31:10] their path you just keep flashing the
[1:31:13] light in
[1:31:14] humility and sweetness that's how he
[1:31:18] describes the capital l i g HT flash
[1:31:22] over their path in humility and
[1:31:25] sweetness amen let's all grow closer to
[1:31:29] God Amen by humbling
[1:31:32] ourselves don't forget this Tabernacle
[1:31:36] will lose its strength

[1:31:43] Satan has got every gun in Hell trained
[1:31:45] on it he'll cause one person to do
[1:31:49] something that's contrary to what
[1:31:51] another one thinks he's doing
[1:31:54] that he is up to it that's his business
[1:31:58] if he can get somebody to say something
[1:32:01] somebody to talk about another say well
[1:32:05] listen did you know so and so did he
[1:32:09] says don't you listen to it don't you

[1:32:28] them and don't pray in a selfish way say
[1:32:33] I know it's my duty I've got to pray for
[1:32:36] that

[1:32:56] you to that person restoring them
[1:32:59] helping them getting them back in
[1:33:02] line cuz all after all we're all headed
[1:33:06] towards the setting of the
[1:33:09] Sun the Lord Jesus will be coming one of
[1:33:12] these days and you know I think it'll be
[1:33:17] sudden and so

[1:33:24] 100th of
[1:33:26] 1% of the whole world will never will
[1:33:31] never know when the Rapture takes
[1:33:34] place it would just go so quick quietly
[1:33:38] and nobody would know nothing about it I
[1:33:42] don't know brother Bruce and I think
[1:33:44] about being up here and and ministering
[1:33:47] to the Bride of Jesus Christ you're
[1:33:50] really preaching to 1%
[1:33:55] of 100th of

[1:34:05] us into this messag amen that we got
[1:34:08] what we need to make the Rapture if
[1:34:11] we're willing to take the word amen and
[1:34:14] start living it start putting it into
[1:34:16] practice start start humbling yourself
[1:34:19] more in the message demonology religious
[1:34:23] brother B says a humble submitted heart
[1:34:26] in the Simplicity is what brings you to
[1:34:32] God and that's true amen a humble heart
[1:34:36] God loves now no matter if you don't
[1:34:39] know your ABCs that don't make any
[1:34:41] difference just a humble heart God
