[35:29] I believe our I believe it's the desire
[35:32] of every Christian to want to be his
[35:34] best for the Lord. Amen.
[35:37] And God I believe the bride is great
[35:41] because God chose her to be the bride.
[35:44] Amen. And what an honor and a privilege
[35:46] it is to be counted in that
[35:49] number. And we know that that number is
[35:53] a servant of all. Amen. And as the song
[35:56] goes, God bless you today. I want to say
[35:58] it's really good to see everyone that uh
[36:01] labor to get out today to service. Amen.
[36:05] Uh may the Lord bless you. May his
[36:08] presence comes. May the word be open to
[36:10] you. May you leave here with more than
[36:12] when you came. And I believe God is here
[36:15] to do exceedingly above all that we
[36:17] would ask of him to do. How many desires
[36:20] something special from the Lord today?
[36:22] Let's look to him in a word of prayer.
[36:24] Our heavenly father, Lord, as we stand
[36:27] before you just as humble as we know
[36:34] how. Lord, we thank you that you've made
[36:36] it possible for us to come in contact
[36:38] with
[36:40] you. that it's not necessarily being
[36:43] inside of a
[36:44] building and it's not necessarily
[36:47] opening the Bible, but it's getting out
[36:50] of our flesh and entering into the
[36:52] spirit of
[36:53] God. Today, Lord, we thank you that
[36:55] you've made that possible for us. And
[36:58] Lord, you've heard our hearts in every
[37:01] song that was
[37:03] sung. The
[37:05] expression of our love to you, our
[37:09] desire to be all that you'd want us to
[37:12] be and for you to be all that you want
[37:16] to be inside of our lives. And Lord, we
[37:19] ask now that you would you would look
[37:22] beyond our faults and failures. you look
[37:26] beyond our flesh and that you would
[37:28] cover us with your blood of
[37:31] every every unbelief, every sin, every
[37:35] shortcoming. Lord, we all stand here
[37:38] today knowing that we need your blood to
[37:42] make us pure in your sight. And we ask
[37:46] that your blood would cover this
[37:48] congregation.
[37:49] Amen.
[37:51] cover cover us Lord that we that your
[37:54] presence may come in the furtherance of
[37:56] this service
[37:58] and uh may your word be broken to us
[38:03] that we may leave here with the bread of
[38:05] life inside of our hearts that we may be
[38:07] able to have sustaining strength and
[38:10] spiritual strength and energy to combat
[38:13] the ws of the enemy. Lord, we commit
[38:16] oursself to you and this service
[38:19] committed into your hands and just ask
[38:21] you now to bless your word to our
[38:22] hearts. We humbly pray in Jesus Christ's
[38:25] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[38:28] evening. Turn with me if you would to
[38:30] the book of Revelations chapter
[38:33] 3. And
[38:36] uh it's a little bit warm in here, isn't
[38:38] it? How many feels warm? A little bit
[38:39] warm.
[38:42] You know, I have not seen you this
[38:44] excited this whole evening until right
[38:48] now. I I I apologize that um that
[38:53] Brother Marty's not here. No, it's I
[38:55] take responsibility. Brother Marty's
[38:56] probably listening and laughing on that.
[38:58] Honestly, I forgot to turn the the AC on
[39:01] and it is a little bit warm in here, but
[39:03] within a few minutes, within time, you
[39:07] know,
[39:10] right? Right? Because it's hard to get
[39:13] just the right
[39:16] warmness as we enter into the scriptures
[39:19] now because we're going to be talking
[39:20] about that. Right? Revelation chapter 3
[39:22] starting with verse number 14. Talking
[39:24] to our church age and unto the angel of
[39:28] the church of Leodysia, write these
[39:30] things thee, amen, the faithful, the
[39:32] true witness, the beginning of the
[39:34] creation of God. I know thy works, that
[39:38] thou art neither cold nor hot, I would
[39:41] that thou art cold or hot. So then,
[39:44] because thou art lukewarm, and neither
[39:46] cold or hot, I will spew thee out of my
[39:48] mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich,
[39:50] and increased with goods, and have need
[39:51] of nothing, and knowest not that thou
[39:53] art wretched, miserable, and poor, and
[39:56] blind, and naked. And I counsel thee to
[39:58] buy of me gold tried in the fire, that
[40:01] thou mayest be rich in white raignment,
[40:03] that thou mayest be clothed, and that
[40:06] the shame of thy nakedness do not
[40:08] appear, and anoint thy eyes with eyes,
[40:11] that thou mayest see. As many as I love,
[40:15] rebuke, and chase, and be zealous,
[40:16] therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand
[40:19] at the door and knock. If any man hear
[40:21] my voice and open the door, I will come
[40:24] in to him and will s with him and he
[40:27] with me. To him that overcomemeth grant
[40:30] to sit with me in my throne. Even as I
[40:33] overcame and sat down with my father in
[40:36] his throne. He that have an ear, let him
[40:38] hear the spirit saith unto the churches.
[40:42] Amen. God bless you. May be seated. We
[40:43] want to title this message the
[40:45] overcomer. And notice the end of the
[40:47] church age. He's speaking to the
[40:49] overcomer. Amen. So the beginning is
[40:52] what we have to overcome.
[40:55] That's right. Amen. And he calls this
[40:57] this church age. Brother Brandon said it
[40:59] was actually the worst church age. He
[41:01] God Jesus actually did not have anything
[41:03] good to say about it. That's how bad it
[41:05] was.
[41:07] And uh Luke he he calls this Jesus is
[41:10] describing the problem of the church
[41:13] member. This is the one I want to focus
[41:14] on the church
[41:16] member because it is obviously a spirit
[41:19] of lukewarmness. It which is not on fire
[41:22] yet really not totally out in the world
[41:24] either. So somewhere in between being a
[41:27] Christian and being an infidel this is
[41:29] where the belie the person is at this
[41:32] believer. It's an awful condition that
[41:35] actually Jesus described it. It affects
[41:37] the blindness of a person that they
[41:39] actually cannot see spiritually. So no
[41:41] matter what they're being told other
[41:43] they cannot understand it. It just kind
[41:45] of goes in one ear and out the other.
[41:47] Thou and thou knowest that thou are
[41:49] wretched and miserable, poor, blind and
[41:51] naked. And they don't know it. They
[41:53] don't know that they're in this
[41:55] condition. So they literally have to be
[41:58] told.
[42:00] And those who have this spiritual
[42:04] disease, they must believe the word
[42:07] above how they feel
[42:09] because their feelings are telling them
[42:11] that they're okay, that they're really
[42:14] not in this kind of shape.
[42:16] They have to lean not to their own
[42:19] understanding, but trust the Lord for
[42:21] their recovery out of this disease.
[42:22] That's the only way they're going to get
[42:23] out of this disease. Amen. Amen. So
[42:26] Jesus stands at the door and he knocks
[42:28] and he expresses the condition to us
[42:31] individually. Come out of her my people
[42:33] that you be not partakers of their sins
[42:35] that you receive not of her place. So
[42:38] the message is to the individual
[42:40] speaking come out of her. Come out of
[42:41] this condition.
[42:43] Overcome this condition.
[42:47] God is speaking to his bride.
[42:51] God is speaking to his bride. And I
[42:53] don't know if I've got uh I'm going to
[42:55] try real quick here to see if I can get
[42:59] the information I I need
[43:03] was I'm sorry I I cannot find it. But I
[43:06] do know that there was one of the
[43:08] epistles in the New Testament
[43:11] that that Paul said, "Make sure the
[43:14] church of
[43:15] Leodysia, this this letter gets to
[43:17] Leodysia." And I don't know which letter
[43:19] that was. I thought it was the book of
[43:21] Ephesians, but it may be the Colossians
[43:23] or something. But
[43:25] nevertheless, this is ironic that this
[43:28] church, this church age is so bad that
[43:31] God doesn't have anything good to say
[43:32] about it. Yet, in this saved church age,
[43:34] he has a bride that's higher than any
[43:37] other church age that comes out into the
[43:40] image of God. Yes. Yes. which shows that
[43:43] this bride has something so powerful to
[43:46] combat and overcome this lukewarmness
[43:49] that the other church agents didn't
[43:51] have. Amen. So, how brother Brandham
[43:54] described it with the seals is that the
[43:55] enemy would come out on a horse of great
[43:57] deception and he would try to come
[44:00] against the church of God, but God gave
[44:02] the word to the bride of that age to
[44:04] combat it, right? To combat that force.
[44:07] And so in this church age, God has got a
[44:10] word for us to overcome this
[44:12] lukewarmness. Amen.
[44:14] So God's speaking to the
[44:17] bride here to come out of her, my
[44:20] people. So does her represent a church
[44:25] or a man-made system?
[44:28] I got some questions here for you
[44:30] because we're supposed
[44:33] to come out and we know that the
[44:37] prophet called the Leodysa
[44:41] uh uh the the lukewarm leodysia the
[44:45] denominational come out of the man-made
[44:47] system the denomination right and so we
[44:50] understood at that time that we were
[44:52] coming out of the denomination out of a
[44:55] man-made system and coming into the the
[44:58] message of the hour which was Jesus
[44:59] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[45:01] forever. And we got churches popped up
[45:02] everywhere because of this message.
[45:04] Amen. And so my question is, does her
[45:07] come out of her uh my people, does her
[45:11] represent a
[45:12] church or a man-made system? Does it
[45:16] really represent a denomination or does
[45:18] it represent the system that man-made?
[45:21] Because brother Brandon said there's
[45:23] good people in the system. It's the
[45:24] system that's wrong. That's right.
[45:28] Does she represent a denomination or
[45:30] does she represent a man-made faith?
[45:35] Because I think it's more than a church
[45:37] building. It's more than a
[45:39] denomination. Because right inside
[45:41] message churches, we have denominational
[45:44] spirits. We have man-made systems. We
[45:46] have man-made preachers. We have
[45:48] man-made people that are sitting in the
[45:50] congregations feeling comfortable that
[45:52] they're in the message and they're
[45:54] making the message of denomination. Even
[45:56] though the prophet said the true message
[45:57] will never become a denomination. It
[46:00] can't be because it's a living word. But
[46:02] see what happened? What happened? What
[46:05] happened with every church age when God
[46:07] brought them out when when that's right
[46:11] sister when when Luther came out of the
[46:13] Catholic church and and separated from
[46:15] that and said no God's in in the light
[46:17] of the word. What happened? They they
[46:19] made a denomination and they stopped
[46:21] right there. Brother Brandham said and
[46:23] they went on to the Wesley. What is no
[46:25] different in this church age? That's
[46:27] right. It's the truth. That's right.
[46:29] Because God is calling a bride to take a
[46:31] rapture. But there's so many people that
[46:34] have just settled for God is in the
[46:36] message and he's not in the
[46:38] denominations and they never received
[46:40] the message in their heart. That's
[46:42] right. So Paul lived by the faith of the
[46:45] son of man, not by man-made faith.
[46:49] That's right. So are we okay being in a
[46:52] message church?
[46:55] Can we still be sitting in a message
[46:57] church and have our own man-made ideas
[47:00] or our own main man faith? I believe it
[47:03] this I look at it this way. This is the
[47:05] way I think it is. A man-made faith is
[47:08] anything that isn't the word of God or
[47:10] the message of the hour. Amen. That is
[47:12] what a man-made faith is.
[47:15] The message of the hour has opened and
[47:17] really restored to us what the word was.
[47:19] It's not something different. Amen.
[47:28] Somebody had to bring it.
[47:31] Somebody had to bring the 14 books of
[47:33] the New Testament that Paul wrote.
[47:34] Somebody had to bring it. And we read
[47:36] it. I don't look at it as Paul. That's
[47:39] right. I don't look at as a word of
[47:40] Paul.
[47:42] It's the word of God. Paul penned it.
[47:45] And ain't no
[47:47] different. It ain't no different. The
[47:49] book of Acts is still being written.
[47:51] It's a continuation book. It's the life
[47:54] being lived since this time happened.
[47:57] God has been doing the works of the acts
[47:59] since the time of the apostles. God is
[48:02] not dead. God is alive. He's the same
[48:04] yesterday, today, and forever. It's just
[48:06] not being written here. But I'm telling
[48:07] you, when we get on the other side,
[48:09] they'll be they'll be just displaying
[48:11] all the works of God for zillions of
[48:14] years. Amen. Amen. Not here.
[48:18] Because the the book said that if every
[48:22] if
[48:22] if everything that was written that
[48:24] Jesus did, the books could not contain
[48:27] it. That's right.
[48:29] But it doesn't mean the word is not
[48:31] being lived today. That's right.
[48:34] Jesus said, "Behold, I stand at the door
[48:37] and I
[48:39] knock." And he's looking for one person,
[48:44] person that will overcome. Amen. because
[48:47] he's interested in sitting with them on
[48:49] the
[48:50] throne. And then he says to this person,
[48:54] he that have an ear, let him hear what
[48:56] the spirit is saying to the churches. So
[48:59] it is nothing that the the person behind
[49:02] the pulpit is saying. It's the spirit
[49:05] behind what's being said behind the
[49:07] pulpit that is really being spoken to
[49:09] the church.
[49:11] that spirit.
[49:12] That's why you can have a five-fold
[49:15] ministry, but yet the same
[49:17] spirit. And so this spirit is speaking
[49:21] to whoever will be listening. That's why
[49:23] it's important to be prepared. Oh, you
[49:25] know, the the voice of God could be
[49:27] right here and we'd miss it. Just like
[49:28] brother Brandon says, there's TV waves
[49:30] and and radio waves going, but there's
[49:32] nothing here to pick it up. Well, God's
[49:33] spirit could be going right through here
[49:35] and there's nothing there to pick it up.
[49:36] But if we're prepared, then we can pick
[49:38] it up. Amen. And that's why he said, "He
[49:41] that have an ear, let him hear." That's
[49:43] why it's important for us to humble
[49:45] oursel and say, "God, I can't hear
[49:47] unless you give me ears." That is I I I
[49:50] can't even know what's going on unless I
[49:52] have a heart that can can catch it. So
[49:55] God, I'm humbling myself before you.
[49:57] That's right, man. That is right.
[50:01] So what does the church
[50:04] have to overcome to him that
[50:07] overcomemeth? What does the church have
[50:09] to overcome? It's the spiritual lukewarm
[50:12] condition that we battle every single
[50:15] day of our lives.
[50:20] Jesus identified it as neither on fire
[50:22] for God and not cold, not ice
[50:27] cold. Each individual believer must
[50:30] overcome the spirit in himself.
[50:33] It's not out there. It's right here.
[50:36] Amen. It attacks us. It tries to pull us
[50:39] down, not get interested, not read our
[50:41] Bible, not pray, get away from the
[50:43] things that we should be doing to stand
[50:45] fire for God.
[50:47] And puts us in a lukewarm condition. And
[50:50] see, Jesus is standing at the door and
[50:52] he's knocking at our hearts and he's
[50:55] offering help to us.
[50:59] and we get to uh maybe a little bit more
[51:03] what that help is at the end. But I want
[51:05] to talk I want to identify a little bit
[51:07] more about this this lukewarm spirit in
[51:11] in in that that's in this age that's
[51:13] neither on fire for God and and it's
[51:15] it's not ice cold against God. And we
[51:18] see this all the time. We see this
[51:21] condition all the time. Amen. If a
[51:23] person is is considered to be on fire
[51:26] for God, then he's considered a real
[51:28] believer.
[51:30] And if we see somebody who's just
[51:32] doesn't want to go to church, doesn't
[51:33] care, has a bad attitude, we look at him
[51:36] as a unbeliever.
[51:39] And what the devil wants us to do is
[51:41] say, you know, we're all believers and
[51:43] it doesn't matter what we're doing.
[51:46] And unfortunately, that is not what
[51:47] Jesus identifies here. He's identifying
[51:50] a lukewarm
[51:56] condition. Jesus is
[51:59] speaking to the
[52:02] makebeliever. If somebody that's on fire
[52:05] is a believer and if somebody that is
[52:08] ice cold is an unbeliever, then somebody
[52:11] that's lukewarm is a makebeliever.
[52:14] Are you with me? Amen. Now, I've never
[52:16] said this before, so this is fresh.
[52:21] A makeel believer is neither hot nor
[52:23] cold.
[52:26] He makes as if he believes, but he's
[52:28] fake. He's phony. He's bogus. There's
[52:31] not genuine. It's not
[52:33] sincere. Expresses a form of godliness,
[52:36] but has no power, no life, no fire.
[52:39] Amen. But yet he goes to church. Amen.
[52:42] Yet he he looks, he acts, he he talks.
[52:48] He has a form.
[52:52] So he doesn't have the fire, the life.
[52:56] He's not ice cold, not caring. He's in
[52:58] the middle with a form without the life.
[53:01] Are you with me? This is the spirit
[53:04] that's attacking the church. This is the
[53:06] spirit that the bride has to overcome.
[53:10] A makebeliever appears to believe but
[53:12] comes short in laboring to exercise
[53:14] what? All of the word. He exercises part
[53:18] of it but not all of it. And Jesus
[53:20] describes the attitude of this lukewarm
[53:23] believer as someone who
[53:25] just has need of nothing.
[53:30] Like I don't need to listen. If I don't
[53:32] want to listen, you can't tell me what
[53:33] to do. Who are you?
[53:36] Like in
[53:37] reality, God can use a 5
[53:41] to 100%.
[53:48] And that if that statement is true,
[53:50] which it is, that ought to cause us to
[53:52] always be humble. No matter who we're
[53:53] talking to,
[53:57] Paul described that he needed to press
[53:59] towards an image of Jesus Christ. after
[54:02] 33 years, he's still pressing towards an
[54:04] image. But this church age, this spirit
[54:06] is I don't really need to do that.
[54:09] I got I got what I need. Because that's
[54:12] what that's what Jesus described this
[54:14] church is. They're okay. They don't
[54:18] really need to do anything more than
[54:19] what they're doing. Coming to church,
[54:20] sitting there, listening to the word,
[54:22] and go home, and that's it.
[54:24] And they're okay with that, right? But
[54:27] Jesus is identifying them as lukewarm.
[54:29] In other words, make believe. We're
[54:32] supposed to take the word home and live
[54:34] it. Amen.
[54:37] Amen.
[54:40] When Paul described this, I press
[54:43] towards the mark, he called that a
[54:46] perfect attitude. He said, this is a
[54:48] perfect attitude and this is what we all
[54:51] need. And if you don't have it in
[54:53] something, God God's going to reveal it.
[54:56] And so what if you've already come to
[54:58] certain things? you've already overcome
[54:59] them in your life. You still need to
[55:01] have that attitude.
[55:03] There's like no excuse for not pressing
[55:05] into more of God. And that's what it
[55:06] takes in this age. That's right. That's
[55:08] right. Now, Lucifer said, "We don't need
[55:12] this gospel in heaven anymore.
[55:16] That's what he said. We don't need to
[55:18] live by it. We don't need to abide by
[55:20] it. We don't need to follow it." That is
[55:22] exactly what he preached to all the
[55:24] angels. But did you know he only won a
[55:27] third of all the angels he talked to?
[55:30] The other twoird said, "No thank you.
[55:32] I'm staying with the word. I'm staying
[55:34] with the word." But he actually won a
[55:37] third of them over with his attitude
[55:40] that the same attitude that Leosia has.
[55:42] I'm in need of nothing.
[55:45] I'm going to do it my way. The Frank
[55:47] Sinatra way.
[55:50] In fact, we don't even need the word of
[55:52] God anymore. We don't we don't need to
[55:55] act like Christ anymore. We don't need
[55:56] the word of God in our home. We don't
[55:58] need to do what the Bible says.
[56:04] In fact, I'm going to exalt my throne
[56:06] and my will above whatever God wants me
[56:08] to do.
[56:10] Same attitude as Leodysia, the
[56:13] makeeliever, having need of nothing.
[56:18] Jesus expressing basically his disgust
[56:22] with this
[56:23] makeeliever and says, "I wish I wish you
[56:28] weren't claiming to be a Christian and
[56:30] just serve the devil." That's the truth.
[56:32] That is the truth. You're being a makeel
[56:34] believer telling me you're a Christian.
[56:38] I would have more respect for you if you
[56:40] were over there. In other words, I got
[56:42] more respect for the devil than I an
[56:44] unbeliever than I do a a makeel
[56:47] believer. Because he's making pretense.
[56:53] God says my gospel is real. Come and
[56:57] prove me if this will not live in your
[56:59] life. Believe it and it will live in
[57:02] your life. That's where God is at. But
[57:04] the makebeliever
[57:06] says, "I just want to make sure I make
[57:08] it to heaven. That's all that really
[57:09] matters to I don't care what kind of
[57:10] life I'm living. Yeah.
[57:13] So, I guess I just got to fake it here
[57:15] when I'm around this person and fake it
[57:16] over here. That is the truth.
[57:21] We can't make it in in
[57:23] makebelie. We've got to overcome this
[57:25] spirit for oursel.
[57:28] And overcoming the spirit is not
[57:29] belonging to a message church. That's
[57:31] right. That is not overcoming it. Amen.
[57:34] Because look, you know this. How many
[57:35] times have you sat in church, you were
[57:37] mad as a hornet?
[57:38] How many times you sat in church, didn't
[57:40] want to even be in church, but you were
[57:41] there. So don't tell me the devil don't
[57:44] come here, too. He comes here and he
[57:46] wants you to get lukewarm. He wants you
[57:48] to say, "Oh, you don't got to do that."
[57:50] He's just being a little strict.
[57:53] He should be a little more encouraging.
[57:56] If this word don't encourage you, I'm
[57:58] telling you, you ain't going to make it.
[58:00] That's right. Amen. Because there ain't
[58:03] nothing after this.
[58:06] This isn't plan A. And God's got a plan
[58:08] B for you. This is it.
[58:15] It'd be better to serve the devil and
[58:17] mean it
[58:19] than to act like you're serving God but
[58:21] don't mean it. That's right.
[58:25] I mean, there there's literally when you
[58:28] see somebody that's out in the world. I
[58:29] mean, we got some kids coming in to our
[58:31] our
[58:33] um our men's our men's meeting and
[58:36] they're being introduced to the gospel
[58:39] and some of them never stepped in church
[58:41] before. Some of their parents have never
[58:42] gone to church maybe one
[58:45] time. I have more hope for somebody who
[58:48] doesn't know the gospel. Amen.
[58:51] Amen. Than somebody who's been around
[58:53] the gospel that but refuses to walk in
[58:55] it.
[58:57] Amen. Amen.
[59:00] But yet the the mate believer who does
[59:02] that, he's looking down his nose at the
[59:04] others who are not doing what they're
[59:06] doing. That's right. That's because
[59:08] there's a religious spirit that goes
[59:09] with make believe. That is right.
[59:14] But Jesus said, "You don't even know
[59:16] that thou art wretched, miserable, poor,
[59:18] blind, and naked. Therefore, I will spew
[59:22] this lukewarm makeeliever out of my
[59:24] mouth. I don't want nothing to do with
[59:26] him." Everybody has had lukewarm water
[59:29] before when you wanted something cold
[59:31] and you're like, I wish I had some ice.
[59:35] So God don't like lukewarmness. And it's
[59:38] up to you to shake yourself. I'm going
[59:40] to come into church and I'm going to be
[59:42] serious with God this time. Amen. I'm
[59:45] I'm just going to be real with him. I'm
[59:47] going to be raw. I'm going to be open.
[59:49] Yes, sir. I'm going to let God convict
[59:51] me. Oh, that's a good one right there.
[59:54] I'm going to let God convict me. Because
[59:55] a lot of times we don't want the
[59:56] conviction, right?
[59:59] Let's take a look at what lukewarm
[1:00:04] means. This word lukewarm means
[1:00:06] tippid, which means only slightly
[1:00:11] warm. Or showing little enthusiasm. See
[1:00:15] if this hits anybody here. Or lacking
[1:00:19] passion. True. I mean, I understand
[1:00:22] sometimes we can be tired, right? When
[1:00:24] we come to church, but but when there's
[1:00:28] no effort being put forth that you're
[1:00:29] really not enthused about being there,
[1:00:31] you're really identifying what you are.
[1:00:34] It is the truth.
[1:00:37] Brother Bram said in the message, the
[1:00:38] church age, he said, they have gotten
[1:00:40] away from the word. They've gotten away
[1:00:43] from the word. They are no longer
[1:00:46] fervent about it. Amen. They are
[1:00:49] lukewarm about it. Amen. They're
[1:00:51] lukewarm about the word. So, in other
[1:00:53] words, it doesn't really matter what you
[1:00:54] preach. It doesn't matter. It doesn't.
[1:00:57] Have you not been praying that God is
[1:00:59] going to speak to you exactly what you
[1:01:00] need to hear? Amen. Yes. See, they
[1:01:03] they've left the realness of it. Brother
[1:01:06] Benson, the message, the separation from
[1:01:08] unbelief. He said, "A lukewarm believer
[1:01:11] is worse than an infidel."
[1:01:15] He says, "That's right. God hurry in the
[1:01:18] day when every man will either be a
[1:01:20] Christian or a sinner and stay the same.
[1:01:24] I like how he said that. Stay the same.
[1:01:29] Because when you look at an unbeliever,
[1:01:30] when you really see I'm sorry. When you
[1:01:32] see a makeeliever, there's always a
[1:01:35] question. Yes, sir. Is this real? Not
[1:01:38] real. How long is this going to last?
[1:01:40] But when you see a genuine believer, you
[1:01:42] don't question. When you see a real
[1:01:44] unbeliever, I haven't believed this
[1:01:46] ever. There's no question there. The
[1:01:49] question comes to the mate believer,
[1:01:51] right? Because sometimes you see him
[1:01:53] like this and sometimes you see him like
[1:01:55] that.
[1:01:57] So the word infidel comes from the word,
[1:01:59] believe it or not, unfaithful.
[1:02:02] Meaning a person who does not believe or
[1:02:05] someone who does not share a common
[1:02:08] belief.
[1:02:10] So a a make believer has to act like
[1:02:13] he's sharing. I believe this message. I
[1:02:15] believe what this church believes. I
[1:02:17] believe what the prophet said. They have
[1:02:19] to act like that. But then when they go
[1:02:23] home, they don't put it into practice.
[1:02:25] That's right.
[1:02:27] So this is the spirit that we need to
[1:02:30] overcome. Brother Brandon would say he'd
[1:02:32] give some examples of lukewarm uh
[1:02:35] lukewarm believers. And he said Ahab was
[1:02:38] a type of the lukewarm believer. Today
[1:02:41] in the message kinsman redeemer he said
[1:02:43] orpha was a type of the lukewarm church
[1:02:45] that started outright a type of a church
[1:02:48] that won't go all the way. Now talking
[1:02:50] about a lukewarm believer they won't go
[1:02:52] all the way. They stop.
[1:02:55] She said that sounds pretty good. So she
[1:02:57] kissed her mother-in-law and returned
[1:02:59] back. Right. Yes. And a man because of
[1:03:03] popularity, he can't hold the Bible, but
[1:03:05] will kiss the church, kiss the message,
[1:03:07] kiss Christ goodbye and go back to where
[1:03:11] he was hollowed out of orpha, lukewarm,
[1:03:13] excommunicated, right? In the message,
[1:03:17] Jehovah Gyra, brother Ram says, and Lot
[1:03:19] was a type of the lukewarm believer.
[1:03:21] Amen. He was a
[1:03:25] believer. He left his home land. be
[1:03:28] sojourned with God but always never
[1:03:31] fully surrendered. There is the
[1:03:34] difference between the
[1:03:36] believer and the makebeliever. Amen. A
[1:03:40] makebeliever, he starts out the
[1:03:42] surrender. He repents. He gets baptized.
[1:03:44] He starts going to church. Things begin
[1:03:46] to happen in his life. He begins to
[1:03:48] testify. He they they whole family goes
[1:03:51] in a certain direction. Then after a
[1:03:53] while, it stops.
[1:03:56] This is a very common thing that
[1:03:59] happens. And they hear the preaching of
[1:04:01] the word and they either snap out of it
[1:04:04] and get back on or they stay in that
[1:04:06] condition.
[1:04:11] And brother Brandham said, they never
[1:04:14] fully surrender. And that's what the
[1:04:17] trouble in the full gospel church
[1:04:19] tonight along with the rest of them is
[1:04:21] people who's left the world and and and
[1:04:24] keep out the world. They don't want to
[1:04:26] go gamble. They don't want to drink.
[1:04:28] They don't want to carry on. They are a
[1:04:29] believer but have never made a complete
[1:04:33] surrender. Right. That's right. So they
[1:04:36] can look at things they've got they
[1:04:37] walked away from but they never
[1:04:39] surrendered to all the word. Because I
[1:04:40] want you to think about this. God wants
[1:04:42] to marry somebody who's in love with
[1:04:44] him. Amen. Amen. And that's the heart.
[1:04:47] And if the heart loves the world or the
[1:04:48] things of the world, the love of God's
[1:04:50] not in them. So it don't matter if you
[1:04:52] give up those things. Amen.
[1:04:55] A lukewarm
[1:04:57] believer is never
[1:05:01] made a complete surrender.
[1:05:08] And a complete surrender would be
[1:05:10] considered
[1:05:15] hot with God. If you completely
[1:05:17] surrender your life to God, you're on
[1:05:19] fire. There's nothing standing in your
[1:05:21] way. Amen. A person who's who won't
[1:05:24] surrender one bit. No, I won't go to
[1:05:25] church. I won't read the B. I'm not
[1:05:27] going to pray with you. I don't believe
[1:05:28] that stuff. They haven't surrendered
[1:05:30] anything. But this lukewarm believer
[1:05:32] right in the middle, he partially
[1:05:34] surrenders and partially doesn't.
[1:05:37] This is the spirit that we need to
[1:05:39] overcome, saints. Amen. Brother Brand
[1:05:41] said, "Lot was a wishy-washy borderline,
[1:05:44] right? Got enough religion to make him
[1:05:47] sick. He pitched his tent towards Sodom
[1:05:49] and become a great man and backslid down
[1:05:52] there." That's why it's important not to
[1:05:54] get so carried away about getting money.
[1:05:57] But Abraham, the man of
[1:06:00] God, gave Lot his choice to take what
[1:06:04] was left and and I'm sorry, to take his
[1:06:07] choice and then he take what was left.
[1:06:10] Oh, I just love that a real believer
[1:06:12] will give you your choice.
[1:06:15] He's willing to take what's left.
[1:06:18] There's no selfishness in a real
[1:06:20] believer. Not at all. Amen. And isn't it
[1:06:24] strange that a lukewarm believer Lot
[1:06:27] would go down to the best place that he
[1:06:29] could find, the most beautiful place he
[1:06:31] could find? He took the road of ease.
[1:06:35] And isn't it
[1:06:37] strange strange thing that sometimes
[1:06:40] people who say they believe God, they
[1:06:43] want to take the road of luxury.
[1:06:46] They want to take the road where there's
[1:06:48] no trials.
[1:06:50] They want to take the easiest way out.
[1:06:53] They want to take the way where there's
[1:06:54] no persecution. That's right. They want
[1:06:57] to take the road of ease. They're just a
[1:07:01] lukewarm believer. He says,
[1:07:07] So, brother Brandham describing a
[1:07:09] lukewarm believer as wishy-washy,
[1:07:11] selfish, looking for luxury, choosing
[1:07:12] the easy way, no trials or persecution,
[1:07:15] never made a complete surrender, kisses
[1:07:17] the church, the message, and Christ
[1:07:18] goodbye. This is all I'm doing. I have
[1:07:20] need of nothing.
[1:07:22] I don't need a surrender anymore.
[1:07:28] You can say amen to the word. The truth.
[1:07:31] I'm not saying you're excited about
[1:07:34] this. What I'm saying and I'm not saying
[1:07:36] that you're here. I'm not saying that it
[1:07:38] either. Just makes you understand that I
[1:07:39] love you. I'm with you. I'm supporting
[1:07:42] you. I prayed for every one of you this
[1:07:43] morning.
[1:07:45] But this is a spirit that's attacking
[1:07:47] us.
[1:07:49] And if we don't get serious with it,
[1:07:50] it's going to overtake us.
[1:07:54] And I'm tell you, anybody that misses it
[1:07:56] from this church will not be because
[1:07:57] they didn't hear the word.
[1:08:00] It's because they chose to take the easy
[1:08:03] path like Lot.
[1:08:05] Amen.
[1:08:07] And believe me, there's a lot more
[1:08:08] makebelievers than there are believers.
[1:08:11] That's true. So Jesus is standing at the
[1:08:14] door of every individual with a message
[1:08:16] to overcome the spiritual lukewarm
[1:08:20] condition. And I will grant that you
[1:08:22] would sit with me on my throne. If you
[1:08:24] overcome this spirit, you'll get to sit
[1:08:26] next to me as I overcame the same spirit
[1:08:31] and sat down with my father in his
[1:08:33] throne.
[1:08:35] We'll get to this. And he that have an
[1:08:37] ear, let him hear what the spirit is
[1:08:39] saying to the churches. So, we're
[1:08:40] listening to the voice of God, the voice
[1:08:42] of the Holy Spirit speaking. And where
[1:08:45] is it speaking to? Not here, not these
[1:08:47] ears, not our intellect, not our
[1:08:50] understanding, but speaking right here.
[1:08:52] Like it's there's something here that
[1:08:54] just believes this is right.
[1:08:57] Where you know if he's just speaking
[1:08:59] here I don't I don't know. I don't know.
[1:09:04] I'm not sure. You know what I'm saying?
[1:09:06] There's that reasoning leaning to your
[1:09:08] own
[1:09:11] understanding. To him that overcometh.
[1:09:14] If any man will hear my voice and open
[1:09:18] the
[1:09:22] door, I will come into him and s with
[1:09:24] him and he with me. We'll get to that in
[1:09:26] a second. But if any man hear my voice
[1:09:28] and open the door.
[1:09:31] In other words, to him that
[1:09:33] overcomemeth, the only way you're going
[1:09:35] to overcome is get the overcomer inside
[1:09:37] of you. That's right. That's right. So,
[1:09:39] how do we come this spirit of self-will?
[1:09:43] let more of the Holy Ghost inside of us.
[1:09:45] That's the only way. He said, "I will
[1:09:48] come in to him. I will come inside of
[1:09:53] him and will s with him and he with me."
[1:09:57] And this sapping this, here's what my
[1:09:59] word says. Just do this. Follow me. You
[1:10:02] do this. You draw nigh to me, I'll draw
[1:10:04] nigh you. Then you'll have power to
[1:10:05] resist the devil and he'll flee from
[1:10:07] you. Amen. Amen. There's this working of
[1:10:10] you and God in a realness inside. Amen.
[1:10:13] There's no more putting peacock feathers
[1:10:15] on and acting like a Christian when
[1:10:16] you're not living like one. And
[1:10:18] everybody knows about it anyways. That's
[1:10:20] right. I'll say it again. Everybody
[1:10:22] knows about it anyways. Amen.
[1:10:26] The thing is we're not going to fool the
[1:10:27] devil. I mean, we're not going to fool
[1:10:29] God. Right?
[1:10:32] So God wants to come inside
[1:10:35] because he wants to
[1:10:37] overcome inside of you. Right? Just like
[1:10:40] he overcame in his corporate body, he
[1:10:43] wants to overcome inside of us.
[1:10:46] So we need we need to focus on loving
[1:10:48] God and we need to focus on receiving
[1:10:51] more of the living word which is the
[1:10:53] Holy Ghost. Amen. Focus on loving God
[1:10:56] and receiving more of the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:58] And that only happens, I'm gonna tell
[1:11:00] you, by choosing. That's right.
[1:11:02] Choosing. Amen. Hey. Hey, Lot. Which way
[1:11:05] do you want to go? Well, I I don't I
[1:11:08] just I'm not I I'd rather take the easy
[1:11:11] way. Okay,
[1:11:14] go. But maybe you're here saying, "I
[1:11:17] don't want the easy way. I I don't want
[1:11:20] to just come to church twice a week. I'm
[1:11:23] interested in becoming Christ." Amen.
[1:11:26] I'm interested in having the the power
[1:11:28] of the Holy Ghost living in me to
[1:11:31] controls my temper. It controls my
[1:11:33] attitude. It controls me. It helps me to
[1:11:36] lay down my life for others. That's what
[1:11:38] I'm choosing. I'm choosing the harder
[1:11:40] way. God told the prophet, "Because
[1:11:42] you've chosen the harder way, a a large
[1:11:45] portion of heaven awaits you." Amen.
[1:11:53] Jesus said in Revelation 3:18, "I
[1:11:56] counsel
[1:11:57] thee." This is how we're going to
[1:11:59] overcome. I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:12:01] gold tried in the
[1:12:03] fire. In other words, when I come into
[1:12:06] you, you are getting the gold that's
[1:12:08] tried by
[1:12:10] fire. When I come inside of you, it's no
[1:12:13] longer you trying to be a Christian.
[1:12:18] I'm going to be a Christian inside of
[1:12:19] you. Amen. I will put my spirit in you.
[1:12:22] I I will do it. Amen. And so what do we
[1:12:26] what do we have to overcome? We have to
[1:12:28] overcome this flesh that says, "You mean
[1:12:31] I got to seek for more than what I got?
[1:12:33] I don't I just I don't know if I'm not
[1:12:34] interested in
[1:12:35] this. That's what we got to overcome.
[1:12:38] We're not going to overcome by not
[1:12:40] leaving the message
[1:12:43] until the rapture happens." That is not
[1:12:45] overcomer. That's right. An overcomer is
[1:12:50] overcoming your flesh that's standing in
[1:12:52] the way that's keeping you from doing
[1:12:53] all God's will. Jesus had overcome it.
[1:12:58] He said, "Father, if it's possible, let
[1:13:00] this cup pass from me." But he said,
[1:13:02] "Nevertheless, not my will, my personal
[1:13:06] will. Not my will, but thy will be
[1:13:08] done." Amen. And he overcame. That's
[1:13:11] right. Why does the father love him?
[1:13:14] Because he lays down his life. That's
[1:13:17] why the father loved him. And now we
[1:13:20] have to follow suit. We're we're
[1:13:22] following the great shepherd Jesus
[1:13:24] Christ, right? Whose voice goes out
[1:13:27] through the ministry, through the spirit
[1:13:29] of the through through the spirit in the
[1:13:31] church speaking to
[1:13:34] individuals. Will you choose to lay down
[1:13:37] your life and take up my word
[1:13:40] and follow me or are you going to pick
[1:13:42] and choose what you want? Because that's
[1:13:44] what a makebeliever does. A makeeliever
[1:13:47] picks and chooses what he wants.
[1:13:50] But Jesus didn't. He said, "I always do
[1:13:54] that which pleases the father." Amen.
[1:13:56] Amen. I counsel thee by me. Go try in
[1:13:58] the fire that thou that you may get
[1:14:00] rich. This not money. Jesus is not
[1:14:04] preaching a prosperity gospel here. He's
[1:14:07] talking about being rich with the Holy
[1:14:11] Ghost, rich in character, rich in the
[1:14:14] rich with the the the image of Jesus
[1:14:17] Christ, you you now have power to live
[1:14:20] the life. That's what he's talking
[1:14:22] about. And white remnant, if thou mayest
[1:14:25] be clothed
[1:14:27] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:14:29] appear. We all got nakedness, do we not?
[1:14:31] We all have it today. Look at We all got
[1:14:34] clothes on, right? Today we got natural
[1:14:36] clothes on because if we didn't have
[1:14:38] them on, we would be weirdos here in
[1:14:40] this church. But the point that I'm
[1:14:43] trying to say is spiritually God sees
[1:14:46] us, right? Everything's open before him.
[1:14:48] The Bible says, and we need the life of
[1:14:51] Christ to cover us.
[1:14:54] We need the life of Christ, not Oh,
[1:14:56] here's my badge right here. Here's my
[1:14:58] badge. I'm in the message. That is not
[1:15:00] the covering. Amen.
[1:15:04] We need gold tried in the fire. That's
[1:15:07] deity. That's God himself.
[1:15:10] That the shame of the nakedest do up
[1:15:11] here and anoint thine eyes with Isa that
[1:15:14] thou mayest. How many before coming in
[1:15:16] the church said, "Lord, today I know
[1:15:18] that I can't see your word straight, but
[1:15:19] I pray that you take my eyes and help me
[1:15:21] to see your word." How many's prayed
[1:15:23] that in some fashion, form or way today?
[1:15:25] Amen. Because un unless we're seeking
[1:15:29] God to give us what we need, we're not
[1:15:32] going to see. We're only going to think
[1:15:34] we see. How many times did you ask
[1:15:36] somebody, "Okay, what was said at the
[1:15:39] service?" And you said,
[1:15:41] "Well, you know God's
[1:15:45] word, but but what did he
[1:15:48] speak?" Well, you know, you were there.
[1:15:52] He he he was talking there in
[1:15:55] Revelations. He's talking about the the
[1:15:58] lukewarm believer.
[1:16:02] There is the difference. That's the
[1:16:04] difference between hearing with our ears
[1:16:07] and hearing what the spirit is saying to
[1:16:08] the church.
[1:16:10] It takes so much more heart to hear what
[1:16:14] the spirit is saying from the church.
[1:16:16] True. And most people, I'm going to tell
[1:16:17] you just just if you can catch this,
[1:16:21] you'll see this obviously that like
[1:16:24] makes a lot of sense. So in the world,
[1:16:26] people want to go to church and they
[1:16:28] want to be entertained. That's life.
[1:16:31] They want to have fun. They they want
[1:16:33] they all this stuff they want to have
[1:16:38] because in that I don't need to hear
[1:16:41] what the spirit is saying to the church
[1:16:44] because really what I want to see in the
[1:16:46] church is what I'm seeing and feeling
[1:16:47] and this is really good. Let's do this.
[1:16:50] There's no effort needed in the heart to
[1:16:53] hear what the spirit is saying. Yeah.
[1:16:56] So, it's the nature of man wanting the
[1:16:58] outside to be visual
[1:17:02] church to them. What they think church
[1:17:04] should be ain't no different in a
[1:17:06] message church. That's right. Amen.
[1:17:09] Ain't no different. The spirit's the
[1:17:11] same.
[1:17:14] But the devil's got to be more clever
[1:17:16] with us than out there in the
[1:17:19] world. He's going to make us think we're
[1:17:21] okay
[1:17:23] because we're in the we're in the
[1:17:24] message church. Brother John ain't going
[1:17:26] to preach anything wrong,
[1:17:29] right? And as long as I I'm there and I
[1:17:33] hear it and I say amen. And I I I I
[1:17:36] believe I'm hearing what the spirit is
[1:17:38] saying to the church. And our lives are
[1:17:40] never changing. Our lives are not doing
[1:17:42] what the word is telling us to do.
[1:17:44] That is right. Look at saints. This
[1:17:47] message
[1:17:48] here is for the overcomer.
[1:17:51] That's all it's for. It's for the
[1:17:52] overcomer. It's not for everybody. It's
[1:17:54] for the overcomer.
[1:17:57] And then he says in verse 19, "As many
[1:18:00] as I love," How many think God loves
[1:18:03] you? Amen.
[1:18:05] And what about the rest of
[1:18:07] you? Yes, you know God loves you.
[1:18:11] Part of God's love is correction.
[1:18:15] He says, "I rebuke and I chasen." This
[1:18:18] is the only way you're going to
[1:18:19] overcome. Yes. Is if you do what my word
[1:18:22] says. So I'm telling you that what
[1:18:23] you're doing right now ain't going to
[1:18:24] work. It ain't going to have you being
[1:18:26] overcomer. You're not going to make it.
[1:18:28] You got to get out of that make believe
[1:18:29] and become a real believer.
[1:18:32] I rebuke. I chasen. Be zealous. Be
[1:18:35] passionate. Yes. Don't be in this well,
[1:18:38] you know, I'm a churchgoer.
[1:18:41] Be zealous, therefore, and what? Repent.
[1:18:44] It means get away from where you're at
[1:18:46] to where you need to go to. Amen.
[1:18:49] It's not like, "Brother John, I thought
[1:18:52] this this really means to, you know,
[1:18:53] repent that you're in the denomination
[1:18:55] and you finally got out of the
[1:18:56] denomination and now you're in the
[1:18:58] message church and we don't really need
[1:18:59] to hear that message anymore."
[1:19:03] But that's how some I'll tell you I
[1:19:06] believe that was the message for all
[1:19:08] those that were in the denomination
[1:19:10] because they didn't even understand they
[1:19:12] were in a man-made system.
[1:19:15] But
[1:19:16] today you can be in a message church and
[1:19:19] have a man-made system in your home and
[1:19:20] you can have a man-made system in your
[1:19:23] mind when the word is coming across and
[1:19:25] that's why you're going to pick and
[1:19:26] choose what you're going to take.
[1:19:31] Now Jesus gave us a key to overcome when
[1:19:33] he said I need to move real fast. Luke
[1:19:37] chapter 9 verse 22 saying the son of man
[1:19:40] must suffer many things and be rejected
[1:19:44] of the elders and the chief priests and
[1:19:46] scribes and be slain and be raised the
[1:19:48] third day. Notice this. He must suffer
[1:19:53] many
[1:19:55] things. He also told his disciples
[1:19:57] they're going to suffer many things.
[1:19:59] And to be honest with you, the only way
[1:20:01] we'll overcome is be willing to suffer
[1:20:03] and not do our will.
[1:20:06] That's the suffering. Amen.
[1:20:09] And he said to them all, "If any man's
[1:20:11] going to come after me and is going to
[1:20:13] sit with me on my throne, let him deny
[1:20:17] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:20:20] me."
[1:20:21] That's the only way we're going to
[1:20:22] overcome.
[1:20:24] He's speaking to the overcomer in this
[1:20:26] age.
[1:20:30] We have to overcome. We have to pick up
[1:20:32] our cross. We have to deny oursel.
[1:20:34] That's a big one. Deny our will.
[1:20:37] Pick up the word daily and follow him.
[1:20:41] That's the only way. My sheep hear my
[1:20:42] voice and they follow me. They take the
[1:20:44] word seriously. They're not sitting
[1:20:47] there and acting trying to act learn how
[1:20:49] to be a better actor as a as a makeel
[1:20:51] believer. I'm sorry. That's just not the
[1:20:53] sheep of God.
[1:20:56] I love you. I'm going to rebuke you. I'm
[1:20:58] going to chasen you. Be zealous,
[1:20:59] therefore, and turn around. Turn around
[1:21:01] from the condition that you're in and
[1:21:03] start walking in the direction that I
[1:21:05] just told you to do. Walk with the word.
[1:21:08] Don't walk with leaning to your own
[1:21:10] understanding, but walk with all the
[1:21:12] word. Not part of the word, all the
[1:21:13] word.
[1:21:15] God is always wanting us to turn around.
[1:21:18] Always. There's always things in our
[1:21:20] life that he would like to see
[1:21:21] different.
[1:21:23] I mean, I believe that he's pleased with
[1:21:24] the decisions that we've made to where
[1:21:27] we're at. I believe he's happy with
[1:21:29] that.
[1:21:31] But I think more than that, he wants us
[1:21:34] to overcome all things. Amen. Amen. I
[1:21:38] got a couple amens out of that. It's the
[1:21:40] truth. John 16:12, I kind of quoted this
[1:21:44] in our our men's meeting. John 16:12, I
[1:21:47] have yet many things to say unto you,
[1:21:49] but you cannot bear them now. How be it
[1:21:51] when he the Holy Ghost has come,
[1:21:54] right? He's speaking to the church. He
[1:21:56] that's got a ear to hear. Amen. He will
[1:21:58] guide you into all truth. For he shall
[1:22:00] not speak of himself, but whatsoever he
[1:22:02] shall hear, he shall speak, and he shall
[1:22:04] show you things to come.
[1:22:06] He will show you the way. He will teach
[1:22:08] you. He will lead you. My sheep hear my
[1:22:12] voice. In other words, they stop what
[1:22:14] they're doing. Right? Amen. That's when
[1:22:18] you know you heard the voice of God.
[1:22:20] Amen. True. Because God is not going to
[1:22:22] speak to you all the time and just say,
[1:22:23] you know, you're the best thing since
[1:22:25] sliced bread. Keep doing what you're
[1:22:26] doing. That is the truth. God is
[1:22:28] interested in building a bride. He wants
[1:22:30] a bride without spot, without wrinkle.
[1:22:33] We have a part to play with that. And
[1:22:35] that's by doing what he tells us to do.
[1:22:39] So God wants us to be zealous and follow
[1:22:41] after whatever he said. Just I mean, a
[1:22:43] lot of times we hear the word of God and
[1:22:45] we don't like it because it don't feel
[1:22:46] good. Like I I can imagine that maybe
[1:22:49] this word isn't real enjoyable to our
[1:22:52] flesh today. It's good though.
[1:22:56] And not that I was trying to bring a an
[1:23:00] enjoyable message, but honestly there
[1:23:03] was a burden to overcome this spirit. So
[1:23:05] we have to talk about it. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:08] Amen. Amen. But the thing is a lot of
[1:23:11] times we come to church and we hear the
[1:23:12] word and we're not zealous about it.
[1:23:15] We're not like, "Amen. So be it in my
[1:23:18] life." Like when I get that, you know
[1:23:20] what? I'm putting this in I'm putting
[1:23:21] this into practice when I get home. I'm
[1:23:24] going to get my family. We're changing
[1:23:25] things around here. That's right. We
[1:23:28] don't do that. We just want to sit
[1:23:29] there, say, "Amen." Take the message and
[1:23:33] go on our way.
[1:23:35] True. And I say there there
[1:23:42] God wants us to overcome. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:45] And I'll just say if you got a ear to
[1:23:47] hear,
[1:23:49] follow what the what what that spirit is
[1:23:51] saying to your heart. All right. James
[1:23:54] chapter 4. James chapter 4 verse one. I
[1:23:57] think um I'm going to just try to go
[1:23:59] through this as quick as I can. Time is
[1:24:01] running away and it's Wednesday and I
[1:24:05] have a lot of things that I want to say,
[1:24:07] but I'm feeling that you can't bear it
[1:24:10] now.
[1:24:14] Amen.
[1:24:16] I finally heard from from brother
[1:24:18] Jonathan.
[1:24:19] [Laughter]
[1:24:23] All
[1:24:24] right, just please bear with me, but
[1:24:27] tell me
[1:24:28] that it's worth listening to this even
[1:24:30] if it takes a little longer.
[1:24:33] So, we've got to overcome this spirit of
[1:24:36] lukewarmness. And is everybody feeling a
[1:24:38] little bit cooler? Wonderful. Because
[1:24:41] I'm sweating. I am sweating, but I'm
[1:24:43] glad you're cooler. James 4:1, from
[1:24:45] which comes wars and fightings among
[1:24:47] you. Well, that's pretty simple. It's
[1:24:50] it's it's my husband, my my wife, my my
[1:24:53] my mom and my dad, my my my son, my my
[1:24:56] daughter, my my my coworker, my brother
[1:24:59] and sister.
[1:25:01] No. From once come wars and fightings
[1:25:04] among you. Come they not hence even of
[1:25:06] your lust in that war in your members.
[1:25:11] Right. Amen. You lost and have not. You
[1:25:13] kill and desire to have and cannot
[1:25:15] obtain. You fight and war and yet you
[1:25:16] have not because you ask not. You ask
[1:25:18] and receive not because you're not
[1:25:20] asking for the right motives. Right?
[1:25:23] That ye may consume it upon your lust.
[1:25:25] Amen. And then he says, you adulterers
[1:25:27] and adulterers, know ye not the
[1:25:28] friendship of the world is enmity with
[1:25:30] God. Wherefore whosoever therefore will
[1:25:33] be a friend of the world is an enemy of
[1:25:35] God.
[1:25:36] Now what is the world doing? Dog eat
[1:25:38] dog. Go after what you want. Yeah. Climb
[1:25:40] on whoever you got to climb over.
[1:25:42] Whoever.
[1:25:45] That's the spirit of the world. Well,
[1:25:46] the spirit of God is you lay down your
[1:25:49] life for the person next to you. That's
[1:25:50] right. That is right. Two different
[1:25:53] spirits. Do you think the scripture
[1:25:55] saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth
[1:25:57] in us lest to
[1:25:59] envy? So what do I have to do to
[1:26:02] overcome? He gives more grace. He giveth
[1:26:05] more grace. Number four, he saith, God
[1:26:08] resists the person that says, I am in
[1:26:11] need of nothing. Right? Amen.
[1:26:16] Don't tell me what to do. Amen. But he
[1:26:19] giveth more grace to the humble. Right.
[1:26:22] The Bible
[1:26:24] says that common people heard him
[1:26:26] gladly. So the humble are are going to
[1:26:28] be they're going to be glad to hear the
[1:26:30] word. Amen.
[1:26:33] And so what do we got to do? What does a
[1:26:34] humble person do? He submits himself
[1:26:37] therefore to God. Whatever the spirit is
[1:26:40] saying to the church, he just submits
[1:26:42] himself to that and then he resists the
[1:26:45] devil and he will flee from you. That
[1:26:47] that that nature that's trying to keep
[1:26:49] you in this bondage of a of a of a
[1:26:51] makebelieve system. Amen. He says,
[1:26:54] "Look, you're in this situation. Draw
[1:26:56] nigh to God. He'll draw nigh to you."
[1:26:58] Yes. So, how do I do that? You cleanse
[1:27:01] your hands, you sinners. You purify your
[1:27:03] heart. you double-minded. Be afflicted.
[1:27:05] Mourn, weep. Let your laughter be turned
[1:27:07] to mourning and your joy to heaven. In
[1:27:09] other words, don't sit there with an
[1:27:11] attitude, I'm okay.
[1:27:13] That's right. I'm in need of nothing.
[1:27:15] I'm pretty good where I'm at. I mean,
[1:27:16] just don't don't try to, you know,
[1:27:19] humble yourself in the sight of the
[1:27:22] Lord, and he shall lift you up. Amen.
[1:27:25] And I'll tell you what, if the Lord
[1:27:27] lifts you up, Yeah. you don't need to
[1:27:29] worry about doing it. That's right. The
[1:27:32] Lord can lift you up to a place honestly
[1:27:35] that you don't care if anybody knows
[1:27:38] about it, but you're in heavenly places
[1:27:40] with him. You don't need a reputation.
[1:27:42] You don't need anybody to know. Amen.
[1:27:45] Because God will dwell with you when
[1:27:47] you're humble. He promised that God
[1:27:49] dwells in a high and lofty place and
[1:27:51] also with him of a humble and contrite
[1:27:53] spirit. That is right.
[1:27:55] So humble yourself
[1:27:58] in the sight of the Lord and he shall
[1:28:01] lift you up. Brother Ram said in the
[1:28:02] message the voice of God in the last
[1:28:04] days. He said if you Pentecostal people
[1:28:07] grouping yourselves out in the creeds
[1:28:09] again in worldliness having a form of
[1:28:11] godliness and denying the power of
[1:28:13] before you have to raise in the
[1:28:16] resurrection to be
[1:28:18] condemned. to be condemned. He said,
[1:28:21] "Because the voice of God that speaks to
[1:28:24] you now through the word will condemn
[1:28:27] you in that day."
[1:28:30] That's why there's been such a
[1:28:33] push to reverence the sanctuary.
[1:28:37] Because the word that's being preached
[1:28:39] is really going to meet you on the day
[1:28:41] of judgment.
[1:28:43] That's right. And we need to take it
[1:28:44] seriously. We can't look at church as if
[1:28:46] it's our living room and we can just
[1:28:48] talk and act any way we want to in our
[1:28:50] living room. It ain't like that.
[1:28:54] He says if you're just a lukewarm
[1:28:56] believer, the voice of God cries in your
[1:28:58] heart this morning, you're a lukewarm
[1:29:00] believer, you better repent.
[1:29:04] Amen. We know, we know in our heart if
[1:29:08] we're
[1:29:08] feeling that God is calling us to
[1:29:12] overcome.
[1:29:13] Amen.
[1:29:15] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10. Now, I'm
[1:29:18] not going to have all this time. You
[1:29:19] know what? I'm just going to have you
[1:29:20] read
[1:29:21] that. Read Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10
[1:29:25] through18. It's basically the armor of
[1:29:27] God. We don't fight against flesh and
[1:29:28] blood. We're not fighting against one
[1:29:30] another. The devil wants us to think so,
[1:29:32] but we're not. We're fighting against a
[1:29:34] spirit that's trying to get to our
[1:29:37] spirit.
[1:29:40] The whole battle is to overcome
[1:29:42] ourselves from standing in the way from
[1:29:45] following God with all of our heart.
[1:29:47] That's the battle. Amen. Amen. And if we
[1:29:50] can get a clear picture what the battle
[1:29:52] is, then we know what to overcome. Amen.
[1:29:54] It's no longer, oh, this person in the
[1:29:57] church, they shouldn't have done that.
[1:29:59] That's right. Or why do we got a problem
[1:30:00] with this over here? That's right.
[1:30:02] Right.
[1:30:06] The main thing
[1:30:07] is everybody in the church could not
[1:30:10] make it. But you have to have the
[1:30:12] attitude if brother says if nobody makes
[1:30:15] it in this city, I'm going to make it.
[1:30:18] And of course, if you are the one person
[1:30:19] in the city that's going to make it, I
[1:30:21] can guarantee that you go to some
[1:30:22] church.
[1:30:24] Amen. And if you're the only person that
[1:30:26] makes it in the city and you go to that
[1:30:28] church, that means everybody in that
[1:30:29] church ain't going to make it. Are you
[1:30:31] with me? Are you catching what I'm
[1:30:33] saying? It just doesn't matter. What
[1:30:35] matters is that you surrender your life
[1:30:37] to God. Amen.
[1:30:40] Amen. We must follow him into our
[1:30:42] promised land. We must follow him into
[1:30:44] the regeneration. We must follow him
[1:30:46] into the completion of the new birth. We
[1:30:48] must follow him into the image of the
[1:30:50] son of man. We must follow him all the
[1:30:53] way. Hold your beginning confidence
[1:30:55] steadfast to the end. That's what it
[1:30:57] means to overcome. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:02] Now, we've been promised. We've been
[1:31:04] predestinated to be conformed into his
[1:31:06] image. That's right. I know a lot of
[1:31:09] times it doesn't seem like it's going to
[1:31:10] happen.
[1:31:14] That's why the Bible says we got to
[1:31:16] claim it. We are the sons of God. It
[1:31:18] does not yet appear what we shall be,
[1:31:19] but we know that when he shall appear,
[1:31:20] we shall be like him. For we shall see
[1:31:22] him as he is. And every man that
[1:31:24] believes this, that that that has this
[1:31:26] hope, he purifies himself even as he is
[1:31:29] pure. Amen. Amen. Not taken away as
[1:31:31] puress,
[1:31:33] but he wants to be more. And so there's
[1:31:36] this attitude of more of God in my life.
[1:31:38] Amen.
[1:31:40] 2 Corinthians
[1:31:42] 3:15. This is really important. And and
[1:31:46] thank you for bearing with me. But but
[1:31:50] even unto this day when Moses is read,
[1:31:55] the word of God is read, the veil is
[1:31:59] upon their heart. That's right. In other
[1:32:01] words, there's something on the heart
[1:32:03] that's keeping them from seeing. Just as
[1:32:05] we know that um God blinded the eyes of
[1:32:12] Israel that the Gentiles could come in.
[1:32:14] Right. Right. So there was a veil on the
[1:32:17] Jews so that they could not see Christ
[1:32:21] until the Gentiles come in. Now we know
[1:32:23] one day, brother Brandon said, when that
[1:32:25] rapture when the rapture happens, not
[1:32:27] one more Gentile can come in. But God
[1:32:31] will be turning to the Jews one day.
[1:32:34] It's going to happen. It's got to
[1:32:35] happen. It's the word of God. And at
[1:32:37] that point, the veil will be taken off
[1:32:40] their heart and they will see Jesus
[1:32:41] Christ who is it will be the same
[1:32:43] message that we're listening to today.
[1:32:46] Truth. Amen.
[1:32:49] He said, "Nevertheless," verse 16, "when
[1:32:52] it shall turn to the Lord, the veil
[1:32:54] shall be taken away." What turned
[1:32:56] towards the Lord?
[1:32:59] The heart. Yes, sir. The heart has to be
[1:33:02] turned towards the Lord. If our heart is
[1:33:04] not turned towards the Lord, we will
[1:33:06] stay in a lukewarm condition the rest of
[1:33:08] our life.
[1:33:11] Now, the Lord is that spirit, and where
[1:33:13] the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[1:33:14] liberty. Think about that.
[1:33:19] Amen. We we know we're not going to go
[1:33:21] into a a a bar and and they're going to
[1:33:25] be worshiping Jesus Christ in
[1:33:29] there. God don't have liberty there. you
[1:33:32] know, they're smoking, they're drinking,
[1:33:34] they're doing all this stuff. There's no
[1:33:35] liberty, right? So, you're not going to
[1:33:37] find them there. And you're not going to
[1:33:40] find God in the heart of a lukewarm
[1:33:43] believer who won't let him have his way.
[1:33:47] I'm sorry. He's standing at the door and
[1:33:49] he's knocking to come in
[1:33:55] cuz he he wants liberty. He wants about
[1:33:57] to tell you when when you he that have
[1:34:01] an ear to hear, let him hear what the
[1:34:02] spirit is saying to the church. When the
[1:34:04] he speaks to your heart, right? He wants
[1:34:08] you to open the door. He wants you to
[1:34:11] open the door and give him liberty to
[1:34:13] come in. And say, "Okay, I will follow
[1:34:17] what you say to do."
[1:34:19] But you know, people will walk around
[1:34:21] and they'll just they'll fight. Yeah,
[1:34:22] God's with me. But then they don't have
[1:34:25] a life to choose God's with them.
[1:34:28] And I'm so glad for this message to help
[1:34:31] us know the difference. Right? Amen.
[1:34:33] This message has really taught us now.
[1:34:36] We all with open face beholding in a
[1:34:40] glass the glory of the Lord are changed.
[1:34:44] We're changed
[1:34:46] into the same image of God from glory to
[1:34:49] glory. Amen. Even what? as by the spirit
[1:34:54] of the Lord. It's not by well, you know,
[1:34:57] I accept it in my mind or I went to
[1:35:00] church. No, God's spirit comes into our
[1:35:04] heart because we open the door. We let
[1:35:06] him in. We gave him liberty. He comes in
[1:35:09] and he changes us. Amen. Amen. And we're
[1:35:13] a church that believes in in in our
[1:35:15] natures being changed and not remaining
[1:35:18] in the same condition. That's right.
[1:35:20] Year after
[1:35:21] year.
[1:35:23] We should be being changed to become
[1:35:24] more like Christ year after year
[1:35:27] according to the gospel. Amen. But God
[1:35:29] stands at the door.
[1:35:33] He's knocking. And we've got to be able
[1:35:35] to say, "Lord, not my will. Thy will be
[1:35:38] done. Come on in. Come on in my heart."
[1:35:45] More. The
[1:35:47] overcomer is here wanting to overcome
[1:35:50] inside of us.
[1:36:02] You know, it's only one minute past.
[1:36:04] That is amazing. I think we have time
[1:36:07] for another half hour. What do you
[1:36:09] think?
[1:36:11] I'm going to go through this real quick.
[1:36:12] It won't be a half hour. I was just
[1:36:13] kidding on that. Romans 8. And believe
[1:36:17] me, I'm skipping some stuff here.
[1:36:20] If Christ be in us, which he
[1:36:23] is, when he's abiding, I'll say it like
[1:36:26] this. Who can be against us?
[1:36:35] Now, we know, we've heard this. I don't
[1:36:38] really know what's true, but we've heard
[1:36:40] this. We can understand the the gist of
[1:36:42] it that more wars are fought over
[1:36:45] religion than anything else. Amen. We
[1:36:47] know a lot of wars have been fought over
[1:36:49] religion. Amen. But in
[1:36:52] reality, when I watched Jesus with his
[1:36:57] disciples saying, "Put thy sword away."
[1:37:00] He did. If you live with the sword,
[1:37:01] you're going to die with those. I I
[1:37:03] don't see that God wants me to fight you
[1:37:06] because you don't believe what I
[1:37:07] believe. I don't believe the Holy Ghost
[1:37:09] is going to say to me, "Let's kill uh
[1:37:14] 94,000 pro. I can't remember how many
[1:37:16] how many 64 million 64 million
[1:37:20] Protestants to prove that God is with
[1:37:24] me. I I don't think we prove we're right
[1:37:27] by fighting.
[1:37:29] Right. That's right. That is right.
[1:37:33] But if truly God is inside of
[1:37:36] you, you don't have to worry about a
[1:37:38] thing. Amen.
[1:37:40] Amen. That's right. All right. Romans
[1:37:43] chapter 8 verse 8. So then they that are
[1:37:45] in the flesh cannot please
[1:37:47] God. Right? Make believers in the flesh.
[1:37:52] But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
[1:37:53] spirit. If so be the spirit of God
[1:37:56] dwells in you. Now if any man have not
[1:37:59] the spirit of Christ, he's not of his.
[1:38:00] Point blank.
[1:38:03] And if Christ be in you, the body is
[1:38:05] dead. That's right. Because of sin.
[1:38:08] Amen. But the spirit is life because of
[1:38:10] righteousness.
[1:38:12] So if Christ is in you, he's got
[1:38:14] liberty. You don't get your you're not
[1:38:15] doing what you want to do. That's right.
[1:38:18] You have learned to discipline yourself.
[1:38:19] You're a disciple of Christ. You're
[1:38:21] doing what he wants you to do. But if
[1:38:24] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:38:25] from the dead, if he dwells in you, then
[1:38:28] he that raised up Christ, he's going to
[1:38:30] also quicken your mortal body by the
[1:38:34] spirit that what dwells in you, not
[1:38:35] that's going to come in you later.
[1:38:38] This is a present tense change that
[1:38:40] happens in our nature. That's right. And
[1:38:43] so at the end of of chapter eight, I
[1:38:45] like to go there. We're going to close
[1:38:47] um with a couple scriptures after this
[1:38:50] one. That was supposed to be funny, but
[1:38:53] at the end of chapter
[1:38:55] [Laughter]
[1:38:57] eight, see that's why I'm so against
[1:38:59] just joking, you know, at the b doesn't
[1:39:02] work. Okay. At the end of chapter 8,
[1:39:05] Paul asks 13
[1:39:07] questions. 13 questions. At the end of
[1:39:11] chapter 8, what he's trying to do is
[1:39:14] trying to shake us from our thinking and
[1:39:17] get us to think like the mind of Christ.
[1:39:18] Amen. That's what he's doing. Start here
[1:39:21] with verse 31. What shall we say to
[1:39:23] these things? If God be for us, who can
[1:39:26] be against us? He that spared not his
[1:39:28] own son, but delivered him up for us
[1:39:30] all. How shall he not with him also
[1:39:32] freely give us all things? Who shall lay
[1:39:35] anything to the the charge of God's
[1:39:37] elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is
[1:39:39] he that condemnth? It is Christ that
[1:39:41] died rather is risen again. And who who
[1:39:43] is even at the right hand of God who
[1:39:44] maketh intercession for you and
[1:39:46] I? Who shall separate us from the love
[1:39:49] of Christ? Question. Shall tribulation?
[1:39:52] That's another question. So distress,
[1:39:55] persecution, famine, nakedness, peril,
[1:39:58] sword. Are any of these
[1:40:01] things going to separate us when Christ
[1:40:03] is inside of us?
[1:40:06] No. It can't be his love for us, right?
[1:40:09] Because Christ loves everybody, right?
[1:40:12] It has to be him living inside of us.
[1:40:14] The love of Christ inside of us, abiding
[1:40:17] in us.
[1:40:20] Because when Christ is in you, it don't
[1:40:21] matter what you go through. We got
[1:40:22] examples of that. We got the three
[1:40:24] Hebrew children. We got all these
[1:40:25] example. Daniel the lion's done it. It
[1:40:27] just doesn't matter. When God is in you,
[1:40:29] everything is okay. Amen.
[1:40:33] As it is written, for thy sake, notice
[1:40:35] this. And we'll need this for the next
[1:40:38] verse. And I promise we're going to
[1:40:39] stop. As it is written, for thy sake we
[1:40:41] are killed all the day long.
[1:40:45] We are counted as sheep for the Why does
[1:40:47] it have to be there? Why is that verse
[1:40:49] stuck in here right in the middle of not
[1:40:52] being separated from the love of God?
[1:40:54] It's just like it doesn't even have a
[1:40:56] place. It has a place. Yes, it does.
[1:40:58] Because if you don't keep
[1:41:00] yourself dead, Christ love can't love
[1:41:03] inside you. Amen. Because this is how
[1:41:05] most humans are. I want the love of God
[1:41:08] here, but don't you make me lay down my
[1:41:10] life for anybody. I'm selfish. I'm going
[1:41:13] to do what I want to do. That is right.
[1:41:15] But we want to claim, you know, God's
[1:41:17] with us. For thy sake, we are killed all
[1:41:20] the day long. We are counted as sheep
[1:41:22] for the slaughter. Nay, in all these
[1:41:24] things, we are more than conquerors
[1:41:27] through him. Through him that loved us.
[1:41:31] For I'm persuaded that neither death,
[1:41:33] nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:41:34] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[1:41:37] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[1:41:39] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[1:41:40] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:41:42] God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[1:41:45] And if Christ Jesus our Lord is inside
[1:41:48] of
[1:41:49] us, nothing is going to separate you
[1:41:52] from doing his will. Right? The truth.
[1:41:56] Last scripture, Revelation 12:10.
[1:42:01] And I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:42:04] heaven, "Now is come the salvation and
[1:42:08] strength and the kingdom of God and the
[1:42:10] power of his Christ. For the accuser of
[1:42:13] our brethren is cast down.
[1:42:18] Let's identify who he is. He accuses
[1:42:21] them before God day and night."
[1:42:25] You know, you know what he does, James?
[1:42:28] The devil will come to you and he'll
[1:42:30] say, "You know what I want you to do? I
[1:42:31] want you to go do this bad
[1:42:33] thing." And then he says, "You're bad.
[1:42:36] You shouldn't have done that bad thing."
[1:42:39] And then he goes before God and he says,
[1:42:41] "Did you see James?" Exactly the truth.
[1:42:47] That's what the devil does.
[1:42:51] Now, what we need is to overcome that.
[1:42:54] Amen.
[1:42:55] And we need to overcome. I'm serious.
[1:42:57] The spirit of lukewarmness
[1:43:00] because we're ending in this verse here.
[1:43:01] And they overcame him by the blood of
[1:43:04] the lamb, by the word of their
[1:43:05] testimony. And they love not their lives
[1:43:08] unto that. Why is that in there? Why
[1:43:10] can't I just claim the blood?
[1:43:13] Does that have a testimony? I believe
[1:43:16] God. How will we ever overcome if we
[1:43:19] remain in love with oursel, our will,
[1:43:23] our desire?
[1:43:25] How will we overcome if we have a
[1:43:27] testimony that is not a word testimony?
[1:43:31] Remember Joshua and Caleb had a word
[1:43:34] testimony.
[1:43:35] They said we are more than able to take
[1:43:37] the land because that's what the word
[1:43:38] said. Yeah, right. That is right. They
[1:43:40] had a word
[1:43:41] testimony. Look, the prophet of the hour
[1:43:44] said that this is what we do. I believe
[1:43:46] in the word that the prophet of the hour
[1:43:48] said and they stayed with it. And God
[1:43:51] says, "As I was with Moses, I'll be with
[1:43:53] you." They had a word testimony. Amen.
[1:43:57] If the word said I can do all things
[1:43:59] through Christ, then I got that
[1:44:01] testimony. Amen. If the if the word says
[1:44:04] laid down your life for the brethren, we
[1:44:06] all laid down our life for the brethren,
[1:44:07] then I can do it. If the word says love
[1:44:09] our enemies, I have that testimony. I
[1:44:11] can love my enemy. Amen. We need a word
[1:44:14] testimony.
[1:44:16] You can't have the testimony that those
[1:44:18] others that didn't make it,
[1:44:20] they murmured. They complained.
[1:44:24] They said, "It'd be better if we just
[1:44:25] were in the world." You know, we could
[1:44:26] just do our thing. We not going to feel
[1:44:28] this condemnation all the time.
[1:44:34] Don't murmur and complain and think that
[1:44:36] you got a word testimony. Amen.
[1:44:39] Scripture says, "Do all things without
[1:44:41] murmuring and complaining that you may
[1:44:43] be blameless, harmless, the sons of
[1:44:44] God." That's right. So, you want to
[1:44:47] overcome? You want to be an overcomer to
[1:44:49] him that overcomemeth?
[1:44:51] Don't complain. Don't murmur. Have a
[1:44:53] word
[1:44:55] testimony. And love not your life unto
[1:44:58] the death.
[1:45:00] Love not your life unto the death. Amen.
[1:45:05] How are we going to overcome if we don't
[1:45:08] honor the blood? Right? We're going to
[1:45:11] overcome by the blood of the lamb. Now,
[1:45:13] I'm going to just say this real clear.
[1:45:16] That is not just saying, "I plead the
[1:45:19] blood.
[1:45:23] What that means is honor the blood.
[1:45:27] The blood was spilt that this word could
[1:45:31] get to you. Amen.
[1:45:35] So when you trample over the word,
[1:45:37] you're trampling over the blood.
[1:45:40] And you're not going to make it if you
[1:45:42] don't hold the word in honor. If you
[1:45:45] don't respect the blood. Amen. You don't
[1:45:48] respect the word. Amen. You can't go
[1:45:51] ahead and plead the word if you're not
[1:45:53] respecting it.
[1:45:56] Bible says if we we walk in the light as
[1:45:58] he is in the light, the blood of Jesus
[1:46:00] Christ cleanses us from all sin.
[1:46:03] So this is what we need to overcome. We
[1:46:07] need the need to honor the blood, honor
[1:46:10] the word of God, have a word testimony,
[1:46:13] and and keep ourselves crucified. Amen.
[1:46:16] If you don't do that, you're going to
[1:46:18] end up just, well, that's too hard to
