don't wanna this is the only place I want to be right now amen we can be in a lot of places we can be even having a good time I'd rather be having a bad time being convicted of the Holy Ghost and being his presence amen because with God there is hope yeah because he lives that's right we appreciate brother Alex in the ministry that God and he has been a bit of too many many people many churches amen and we're grateful that he's young remember will be able to continue to be a blessing to family glad to have him back I didn't realize it it's been since April since he's been here but uh we just want as our brother Mark said to pull on the word let's not leave here empty-hearted amen amen let's receive what God intended us to receive and correction is just as good as a blessing amen amen and I'll be honest with you correction is a blessing as many as I love I rebuke I want to be loved if that's the way God wants to love me today that's just showing me I belong to him and we just want Grace to receive it amen let's let's just come on Brother come on up here we're only believing we're only believing amen God bless you this morning we love you take your your Liberty in the Lord thank you man well it's you all again um brother John's really set me up to correct you oh I don't know that I was planned to do that but I mean we'll see and another thing you know so no uh whatever the Lord wants for us we want to receive it amen uh you know no no correction seems joyous at the time the Bible says but it brings forth the Peaceable fruits of righteousness and so we're just grateful that God is shaping our character you know Brothers said that we've been invited to shape our character into his and so um what what a great thing that is amen so we are just like I said happy to be with you this morning kind of all joy and uh yeah I I was going to say so many things and it doesn't matter what I have to say anyway it matters what he has to say so why don't we just uh why don't we just go ahead and bow our heads for word of prayer this morning Heavenly Father Lord we are so thankful Lord we have so much to to thank you for Lord and and many times we are careless about that many times we forget about the many good things you've done in our lives we see the bad so easily and we forget the good so often but I'm grateful that you don't forget us Lord we're engraved in the palms of your hands and Lord today as we just bow our heads reverently towards you our our eyes look with expectation toward Heaven from whence Our Savior cometh once again we're thankful that you even now have gathered us together and you're with us by your spirit in this place and we just ask now as we have our heads bowed that in the name of Jesus Christ you would come and take them ministering the word of God today and take our lives and our hearts and fulfill your great purpose and will in each one of us Lord we are looking for great things in our lives maybe not great as the world sees it but we know that this heavens and earth that are now they will not remain forever the way they are but we look with expectation for our new heavens and a new Earth and Lord we are a great thankful for our part in that not just to be part of the economy of it but but to be part of your family to be the Sons and Daughters of God even as we are today Lord I just pray you bless each one that's here today bless those that could not make it help our sister and different ones in need Lord You're a faithful God we just commit these needs now and this service into your hands as a loving and faithful Creator the father of lights and whom is no variableness or shadow of turning and we thank you now bless each one we pray and bless the reading of your word and the utterance thereof in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you if you have your Bibles today we're going to look in the Book of Revelation the 21st chapter again we're going to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are uh we're just uh we're happy in the Lord today amen God is good um man I just it's so good brother Mark how you doing man man you're just looking better all the time I'm going to look good one day well maybe not real good but like I look better than I do now anyway you know you're talking about being young and I I don't feel as young as I used to I guess that's probably most of us so I was talking to a good friend of mine while about a few weeks back here brother and he's in his he's in his 50s and he was talking to his Pastor who I believe is 10 years older than him or something like that man I feel like I'm only in my 50s but I feel like I'm in my 60s he's like how do you know how that feels brother so so he's like well I guess I don't and so you know you never know until you get there um so you know we could sit here and we could worry about back pains and feet and this and that but you know what that's all it's all settled amen it's it's a temporary thing our light afflictions here they're not worthy to be compared to the glory that will be revealed in us do you believe that today so I just want to encourage you today to press the battle God is faithful let's just look here in Revelation the 21st chapter we'll read the first five verses and then I'll have you be seated here the scripture says this and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away I love this next part and he that sat upon the throne said behold I may call things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful may the Lord bless the readings word you may be seated this morning so my title I handed it back there to him this morning my title for this morning is Mundus Novus it is a Latin phrase no we're not Catholic don't get worried there's a reason moon is Novus it's uh it's a it's a Latin phrase um to give you the the history of it or the idea behind it when Christopher Columbus landed in the Western Hemisphere and discovered what he thought was an alternate route to India you know a great deal of speculation began to take place as to what he had actually found and while most people were pretty certain he didn't actually find India they were persuaded perhaps he found the eastern part of Asia that he'd actually found something further east than even India and so he himself insisted this up until the time of his death in 1506 and at one point near the end of his life Columbus asserted that he he saw the beauty of of of the Western Hemisphere thinking it was the eastern part of Asia and he believed he'd found the garden of Edens what I actually thought he insisted for whatever reason that he found it up to the time of his death whether it was for fame or whatever but he insisted he'd found the Garden of Eden it was so beautiful and it was so pristine and Untouched by man that he looked there and believing he was in the East the scripture said that God put a garden in the East towards Eden so he thought well this must be the Garden of Eden and so that was his contention and about three years prior to his death another Explorer from Florentine Amerigo Vespucci he had wrote to one of his friends now he had also traveled over to this continent since that time he'd been there a couple different times and he made a bunch of different claims and some are a little more outrageous than others but he uh he writes to a friend of his that this was not Asia but in fact it was a new continent and he calls it uh Mundus Novus or a new world Amen it's a new world and so his writings they they put it in Latin because that was the the academic language at the time he wanted everybody to know amen that that was a new world and so it began to get circulated and it became accepted it became popular that they called this the new world and so it makes sense to me the reason I say all this is you know in a world that was largely unexplored in this side of the hemisphere this side of the world at the time you know it's understandable that men would be looking for a physical location to find the Garden of Eden amen they thought well if we could search it out and find it and we think about even Abraham and brother bam speaks about it in the future home message that Abraham he was looking as the scripture says for a city whose Builder and maker is God now why was he looking for it because he met the king of it already so he's looking thinking brother bam said it must be on the earth now that was his belief it's somewhere right now today on the earth and so he's looking for it and Men we're looking for even up to the time of Columbus they're looking for Eden they're looking for a physical location and it makes sense that they would do that they're they want to find it amen but we understand today what we're looking for we're not going to find it on Google Maps I mean you're not going to search it out by your human ability it's just like when they went into outer space when men went into space they were disappointed that God was up there waiting on them well God was no more up there than he is here today he's all around us it's just moving a little bit faster so it's not a matter of a physical geography or trying to locate it by some sort of a a latitude or a longitude or some sort of cardinal direction but we realize that God is going to bring this future home down from heaven as a as a bridegroom adorned for his bride as a bride rather Dawn for his bridegroom amen God's gonna bring it down amen so if if it was something that you and I could find it would be up to us to do it but this is something that God is going to bring to pass and since only God can do it you can't find it that way amen praise the Lord so it's to know him the one that's going to bring it down that's how you're going to find it amen praise the Lord so we look at the new heavens and the new Earth that we just read about here and God is going to bring it passed in a certain season and in his time and we understand according to the word of God and according to the message it's not a new lump of clay he's not going to take this Earth and dissolve it into like a million pieces and Scattered about and make a new one it's the same lump of clay it's the same attribute of God it's the same framework but he's going to renovate it with Holy Fire amen we know he can do it because he's done it in our lives we are the first fruits of a new creation today amen we're the firstborn of the Church of God hallelujah so we know what the Holy Fire can do because it's done something in our lives amen we weren't looking for God but God come to us God put his life in US amen when we were Sinners when we had gone astray like sheep there wasn't one of us looking for God God kept looking for us and we recognize today that just as the new heavens and the new Earth it's God's workmanship Jesus said I've gone to prepare a place for you amen just the same he has done things in your life God prepared things in your life God put gifts in your life amen before he formed you in the belly he knew you amen you ordained you for a purpose he brought you here today amen it wasn't whatever vehicle you wrote In God brought you here today whether you recognize it or not so what does our attitude or our response towards it today recognize that God has done this we could take credit for it if we wanted we could think that we did something we could recognize at the same God that's going to bring all these things to pass he's done something in our lives amen so we understand it's not a new Heaven or and a new Earth like a completely different uh framework and we look at the scripture in second Peter the Bible talks about the old world was destroyed by the waters amen what wasn't a different planet it's the same one but that Cosmos or that order or that system that was there at the time was destroyed by water just as the one that we're in today will be destroyed by Holy Fire amen and so when the new the New Jerusalem it comes down there's a there's a place on the earth over in the East amen that city is going to come down on brother Brandon said that heaven and Earth Kiss the Earth will push up and the city will come down not a square but a mountain Mount Zion the holy place of God so that means there's an attribute in heaven to display it but there's also an attribute in the earth amen we let me say this way we are the attribute in the Earth today of this generation that God has displayed himself in amen you're more than just a Pew warmer today you're more than just another church member you're more than just another Holy Roller you're the attribute of God out of the earth that he is pulled up from the clay and the calcium and the potash and the minerals in you God put in your mother and your mother's mother and all through the time and through history because he had an attribute of himself to display in this generation and you're that attribute so that makes you more than just another person that goes to church that makes you different than the church down the street you're the attribute of God in this generation God can no more fail to display himself in your life than he can the new heavens and the new Earth because there isn't a new heavens and a new Earth without a new people to dwell in it amen so it's not a new a completely new element plate so we could say this so it's a new paradigm it's a new it's a new uh expression of the things that are there and so we read the scripture and it sounds much like what the prophet Isaiah prophesied of if you if you have your Bibles you don't have to turn there if you want but it's in Isaiah it's the 65th chapter and uh really for the sake of time I'm not going to read the whole thing but the Bible says this in Isaiah 65 verse 14. he says behold my servants shall sing for Joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall how for vexation of spirit talk about those that have rejected him and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the Lord God shall slave thee and call his servants by another name that's us that he who blesseth himself and the Earth shall bless himself from the god of Truth and he that sweareth in the Earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hit from mine eyes for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come to mind now this is what I want us to consider today I want to to look at this for a little bit it's it's it's remarkable and remarkable to me I've been preaching about the different Redemptive names of God and and probably all of us have looked at some point or another hopefully but you know he's Jehovah shama Jehovah Jireh different things and and I've been ministering that a lot lately and uh you know there's there's many things about God that he displays and he continues to display them in the new heavens and the new Earth amen he continues to be a Healer of the Nations and the new heavens and the new Earth amen all that he expresses himself here he doesn't cease to be those things there but an expression remains of who he is and so the reason I'm saying this is that God expresses himself in these attributes and the Bible tells us here that the former things will not be remembered and I got to thinking you know it's a very mysterious thing because we could look at that one way or another amen you know what what is actually remembered and what is not remembered and I had a brother come to me years ago it's pretty funny he's uh he's the same guy that threw him out of a golf cart but that's a whole other story uh I had a brother coming years ago and he said no I was looking at the message and and brother Brahms talking about the Redemptive names of Jehovah and he mentions Jehovah Jireh and this that and brother bear says Jehovah Manasseh is one of the names and he's like well that's not one of the Redemptive names of Jehovah and so we've got to talking about it and then the name Manasseh means to forget or to cause to forget and I got pretty excited not because I found some new revelation that nobody's ever found before but you know I'm not here to preach the eighth name of Jehovah today but uh but it's it's interesting because you know brother man is 17 times the message I'm sure you could really spiritualize that but uh you know I'm not here to promote my new doctrine today but if you want to buy my book afterwards we can talk about it because of Jehovah Manassas and I think it's interesting because that's one of the attributes of God that we see here in the scripture God causes to forget certain things the former things will not be remembered and so I begin to think about it what does that actually mean because I think we get this idea sometimes which is not biblical that we're just going to get over there and have no recollection of anything that ever happened but that's not what the Bible the scripture is talking about and so if you look in the Book of Genesis the 41st chapter and the 51st verse this is where we see the name manasa now Joseph we all know the story of Joseph hopefully but Joseph you know he was the uh he was the second youngest of Jacob you know he was the Rachel's son and he was the favorite son he had the the coat of many colors you know uh and and brother Branham loved the story so much he named one of his kids after it even he loved the story of Joseph Joseph's a type of Christ amen a type of redemption he was clothed with many colors he was hated by his Brethren rejected and sold into slavery by his Brethren and he goes in the house of potiphar and and he's he's put in prison from there and Joseph's life up to that point didn't look anything like the dream was going to come to pass but God threw a butler in a baker he causes pharaoh to have a dream he takes Joseph and he elevates him to a place where he's the vice for always the he's the second hand man in Egypt he's he's basically King next to Joseph amen so you look at Joseph's story and look at all the hardship that he goes through and all the difficulty of being hated by his Brethren rejected left for dead put in prison and at the end of all these things Joseph he begins to prosper and he takes himself a wife there in Egypt and he has a son and the Bible says this Joseph called the name of his firstborn Manasseh for God said he hath caused me to forget all my Toil and all my father's house amen so this is his own testimony about God everything I went through and all the pain and all the suffering all the hardship now I'm in a place where I'm blessed now I'm in a place where I have fulfilled the will of God in my life and he's caused me to forget my toys cause me to forget my father's house now I want to stop for a second now the Bible says this he says he forgot his father's house but I want you to understand what his Brethren came to me recognized him hey man he didn't forget their existence that's not what it's saying amen you follow me now he didn't say Amen who are these strange people never met them before you know how it is you see somebody at the store and you're like man I don't know I'm just pretending I don't know who they are shame on you for that first of all I'm just going to pretend I don't know who they are listen he knew who they were he recognized them right he remembered what they'd done to him even amen but he forgot not not the knowledge of what had happened but but all the pain and the trouble and the toil that was attached to it amen it had bothered him it had troubled him and he acknowledges even when he meets his Brethren what they did they remember and it's interesting because if anybody had a right to be upset it would be Joseph and when they recognize their brother they despair they get worried they get scared but he Comforts them think about that he Comforts them when they're overwhelmed he says don't be grieved don't be angry with yourselves God sent me before you to preserve life what you meant for evil God meant it for good now the man that should have bothered it didn't bother he's comforting his persecutors now he knew what they did he remembered but on that side of his trial it didn't have the same effect on him amen see when you finally understand it better by and by it changes your whole perspective you look at trials you went through that kept you up at night you look at situations you went through that that drove you to your knees and about destroyed you and now you look back and it only brings a smile hey man did you look back and it was like it never happened what did that God did that for you sometimes we we look at our lives we grew up in maybe a bad home maybe we come from a bad church maybe we were mistreated whatever it is and we ask ourselves why was I treated this way why did I grow up in this situation why did I go through those things why was I treated that way why'd I have to deal with that sickness maybe God sent you that way because he knew that was the only place the only way to get you where he needed you to go hey man he couldn't get Joseph to the right hand of pharaoh without sending him through prison through rejection through a pit in the ground and Joseph probably wasn't sitting there shouting about it every day he got up in jail praise God I woke up in prison again today man it's been 13 years and they forgot about me two years ago glory to God well let's get real for a second people we don't look at our trials that way the Bible says it's worth more than gold trying to fire amen when was the last time you went to the bank and tried to cash in your trials to get a down payment on a new house the world don't see it that way and you probably don't see it that way but that's how God sees it and when you get on the other side that's how you'll see it you know what it was worth it all along or a light Affliction it really wasn't worthy to be compared to the glory that's to be revealed in US well it's easy to say that when it's not my trial I'll tell you that about your trials with a Joseph's trial man man look at what he went through wasn't that great well he didn't think it was so great at the time you don't think it's so great at the time amen you know and that's the thing that didn't affect how God treated Joseph well Lord maybe I just have to have a better attitude listen God understands the Bible says he pities us his small children he remembers a frame that we're but dust we we can get more down on Earth we get down on ourselves and we get down that we're down well I shouldn't be so discouraged I'm discouraged that I discouraged that's what we do we beat ourselves up and all the wild God's saying I've got something better for you if you just if you just hold fast just recognize there's a purpose you're not like the rest of the world I've got a purpose when you go through things I'm bringing something out you might have had to wait a long time for your blessing but I'll bring it Abraham had to wait a long time but he got his Blessing God's speaking to him you're a father of Nations and I ain't got one kid what are you talking about he laughed about it Sarah laughed about it God still give him a son I'm saying this they don't don't put confidence in your confidence put confidence in God we lose confidence in our confidence amen you just you see what I'm saying it's like it's like brother bazarus said don't put faith in your faith well I wish I had don't put faith in your faith put faith in God it's God that's gonna do it amen so God sends us listen we go through things sometime why do I have to go through this because you're going to meet somebody it's going to go through the same thing and they're going to need somebody like Joseph to encourage them you know what it all works out in the end for good man it's all for a purpose you might not know what it is you might not know in this life what it even is but you will find out amen Abraham didn't see all the nations that he was the father of and this in his first life when he come up out of the graves that when Jesus hung on the cross he saw a whole city around him he saw that you know what God was faithful to what he promised it might take a long time but God knows what he's doing amen amen so in this book of Isaiah 65 when it talks about the former things not being remembered several times in the in the chapter prior says the former troubles amen it's the former troubles the toil the thing that Joseph talked about the The Suffering The Pain that's the thing that's not remembered it's not that there's a complete lack of knowledge that it never exists in the first place amen in other words how if that was the case how would you tell me your story on the other side amen see in order for you to have a testimony you'd have to remember what God did for you in this life amen I love it because I've been reading out of the book of Nehemiah a bunch lately but Nehemiah I love this about him he he he goes through things and this man he he's you know he's got it rough from the time he rebuilds the wall That's when his trouble started is when he got done building the wall you would have thought that hey he's done the work's done we've got a restoration God's restored everything that's when the enemy really lays it on Amen and he's just wrestling with one thing after another but I love because Nehemiah he cries up to God God remember me for good God don't forget the thing that I did for you for good Lord I know there's lots of things you could remember about me for bad but I'm asking God remember me for God remember when I when I did something for your children remember when I laid it on the line for your purpose so don't forget me for good remember me for good amen praise the Lord so God remembers it's interesting because God can remember certain things and forget certain things amen he asked the same the same God that he asked to remember what he did for good he says remember what they did for evil I'll pray to the Lord that's that's the Jewish way of doing it amen well that's true you know they're crying out how long until you Avengers Lord right Revelation 18 says this I heard another voice from Heaven saying come over my people and be not ye partakers of our sins that you receive none of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath to remember her iniquities it's interesting because here you know some years back just a few years ago in the last decade you know you had this movement this charismatic movement they got the new pope in and all these Pentecostals and all these denominational preachers they're all saying you know what Luther's their votes over we're all going to be one group we're all going to be one church and these Pentecostals and all these people they all want to join up at the Catholic church and I'm thinking did you forget what they did a hundred years ago that it killed you if they could get away with it right see they forgot all the things that that Wicked system has done to the people of God they forgot about Dark Ages and persecutions but you know who didn't forget God didn't forget men forget but God didn't forget that part amen the Bible says God doesn't forget your labor of love praise the Lord amen isn't that amazing he can call us to forget he doesn't forget your labor of love but he does forget all your sins amen he remembers theirs but he forgot yours praise the Lord now it's like you never did it in the first place now remember it's not that you never did it it's like you never did because he has no recollection of it Amen brother Brandon says if we have confessed that he is we've been in his presence and we have confessed our sins they are blotted out of his book of his memory there's nobody but God could do that that's why he's Jehovah Manasseh listen you can't just do that on your own you deal with it every day probably you wake up and you remember stuff maybe you're going to happen it's funny it just hits you at the weirdest times oh man I remember I did that thing 30 years ago or whatever it is that's how the human memory is true nobody could do that but God he says now you can do anything to me I'll forgive you but I'll remember it if I do anything to you you'd forgive me but you'll remember it but God can forgive and forget think of that don't even remember it he says that makes me feel good praise the Lord I feel pretty good about that massage right now oh my my when it's not even remembered anymore nothing can do it but God nothing but God can do it he said he would blot it out of his memory book I can't do it you can't do it because we've got these little finite senses but he's infinite God he absolutely forget that it was ever done thank you Jesus so God actually possesses the power to cause himself to forget your sin now remember against it's not that there's no knowledge that you ever sin per se because he knew that about you before the foundation of the world that's why there was a lamb slain for you before the foundation of the world he knew there would be a need or a provision for it amen but the penalty of it in the attitude that would go with it he's forgotten all that amen that's why that lamb was prepared it has the power of the blood has the power today Amen to divorce or completely remit sin he's not just covering it up today he's not just whitewashing it he is separating the power of Sin from your past and from your soul and from your identity that's not who you are thank you Jesus it doesn't even come into His thought about you he actually never has because he sees you through the blood of Jesus Christ amen again brother Bram says in the Rapture 1965 he says for instance if brother green heard that I'd been drinking I've been doing bad things and he found out that I didn't do it he'd come say I forgive you brother random you forgive me I never done it what are you forgiving me about see if I'm guilty I can be forgiven but I'm still not just because I did it but the word Justified it's though you've never done it at all Justified and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse he says his cleanses us so from sin till it's put in God the book of God's forgetfulness he is the only one can do it now I keep emphasizing that for a reason because when we try to do it ourselves it doesn't work well I'm just going to pretend I don't know this listen you need God's help to do that you can't overcome bitterness through your willpower you can't overcome resentment through your own human ability God's got to do that for you how's he going to do it he's not going to erase the idea that ever happened he's going to give you a perspective he's going to change your outlook and realize you know what what was meant for evil God used it for good God takes trouble and he harnesses it and puts a bit in his mouth and he uses it to bring you closer to him closer to your purpose closer to what he saw you as before the foundation of the world [Music] amen he says this in the sight of God the bride is Justified she never done in the first place amen standing there married to The Virtuous Son of God never sin in the first place why she was four ordained she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous amen brother man says that's just like this little song that's a different sermon but just like this little song he used to hear Minister and his wife sing not as Mortals forgive one another Jesus forgives and forgets see we can't forget but he can he is God he can forget it it never was put in the sea of forgetfulness and not even remember it he's God he can take it from his complete memory but we can't do that see he can so he says we can't do that but he can now he can cause us to forget things and like I said it's not it's not the idea that we have no knowledge that took place amen that's what the new heavens and new earth we've read about it now that the former things won't be remembered it's not a lack of knowledge that they ever happen amen there's a memorial there and His Hands he has his scars nail scarred hands amen they the only man-made thing in heaven today is the scars of Jesus Christ amen there there's a memorial about the things he did we can talk about these reductive names and all these different things and and brother Brown lays us out the idea of the law of contrast why did God permit a fall in the first place because he was a Healer because he was a savior he was a deliverer but he couldn't tell Adam these things Adam listen I'm your healer I'm your savior he has no idea what he's talking about so by the law of contrast God permits a fall he permits it to happen to express himself and Redemption now what would the point of that be if he's going to cause you to forget that ever happened there's no point in expressing these attributes if he's going to erase the knowledge that he was ever a redeemer so there must be a recollection of what he's done there must be recollection that he was the Savior on Earth that you you had things happen but now you're over here and you look back and realize but God was in control the whole time God was faithful amen God was greater than sin not as the offense so much more is the gift of righteousness to us what he's done for us it's greater right it eclipses it it surpasses it amen so we we understand amen something the Angels don't understand when we sing Amazing Grace it means something to us I once was lost but now they have no idea what that means we do and we will amen we continue to have an understanding of that that before there was a sickness amen there was a Healer he didn't become the Healer when sickness said and he always was the Healer and he always will be the healer before there was one sickness he was the Healer before there was one sin he was always a savior and God permitted it all to magnify these attributes to show his love because without contrast you never know you'd never really understand amen you never know that he could he could bring life to death if he hadn't been in that situation amen so he did all these things to prove himself a redeemer to test your character then what profit would there be if the knowledge of that were to Simply disappear and that's why it continues to remain so when the scripture talks about him forgetting when the things that were former things are forgotten it's not that it never happened but it was superseded that's why I keep calling it it's it's not just another world Amen it's not just a new world it's a greater world and man this is the negative we get so we get so stuck on the material we see this Pulpit we see this church we look at these things this is just the shadow this is not the this is not the the real thing the things which you're seeing they're made up of things not seeing we're in the negative listen this is as negative it's never going to get for you if you're a Christian you're just moving towards the positive all the time amen and listen now the young people won't understand because we just do digital stuff nowadays but you know how I my my grandmother years ago you they used to them slides you probably know I'm not little things there in the little the wheel you look at the pictures well they have all the negatives well nobody looks at the negative when they get the positive you use the negative to develop the positive you don't keep them around like man look at that really dark smudge there it's only used to develop the positive because the positives what you're going to look at the positive is the memory you're going to see not the negative see it's just not developed yet but when it's developed in the way that God wants it to be you're looking at a completely different way amen amen Jesus says this a woman when she's in travail hath sorrow because her Hours come but as soon as she's deliberative no I'm not a woman so I'm just taking the Lord's word for it here so but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remembers no more her anguish for Joy than a man is Born Into the world and now he he says ye now have therefore sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and know and your joy no man taketh it from you amen now I don't know how my wife feels about it I didn't ask her this morning and perhaps I should have but when she looks at her four kids well they probably cause her different kinds of troubles than they did when they were born but I don't you know you don't look at your children and you know I've talked a little bit about the different difficulties that they had being born I don't look at them and say man that was awful what I went through I look I look at him and say what a blessing that they're here today I don't I don't I didn't forget that it happened but it's not it's not foremost in my mind right I look at the blessedness of it that God has blessed me with four healthy children they love the Lord that means something to me amen it eclipses it has caused me to forget the trouble that was behind it amen amen it's the same thing what Jesus is talking about you know Paul himself says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehend it but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto the things which are before I press towards the mark for the prize the High Calling well see supposed to forget the former things but Paul also says in Ephesians chapter 2 God who is rich in Mercy for his great love or worth he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus why that in the ages to come not just this one but in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for right Grace you're saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any mentioned boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember I thought I was supposed to forget well now he says remember now the Bible's not contradicting yourself it's all a matter of perspective remember that and being that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ in other words remember that one time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope you remember when you had no hope yeah but now you got hope don't bother you now because you got hope you hadn't been there remember what it's like not to have hope because now you've got it having no hope without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ amen so see when it comes to where you come from in this life remember where you come from but when you talk about where you're going forget where you come from remember where you're going amen don't let where you come from stop you from pressing towards the mark where you come from is not meant to stop you to get where you're going it was meant to propel you to where you're going amen so that's all I'm out of perspective you can look at your trials and see trials and see problems or you can see the glory of God you can see a testimony you can see a message of overcoming I live in brother Graham's life story because brother Brown himself now some people don't agree with this brother by himself said I made many mistakes in my life well I can you you can either look at a profit and say well man that guy made mistakes as a man and get discouraged by that or you could say oh praise God I made a few too he said I don't want them to be stumbling Stones that's what people done don't let them be stumbling Stones let them be stepping stones see it's all how you want to look at it you can let it stop you or you can let it Propel you it's all how you're gonna take your attitude towards it amen don't forget where you come from because God brought you out of it that's not where you are today remember what God did for you what you were is not where you're going to be that's not your final destination because God saw you before there was that little hiccup there called time God saw you in the Eternal thought as Victorious as holy as accepted [Applause] so whatever you went through was God using it as a stepping stone to propel you to where you're at say don't forget where you come from but do remember where you're going love amen now like I said we don't have any more power to forget that in ourselves than Joseph did but that's God's power to do that yes you know what's interesting about this and I'm I just want to take a few moments on this you know I've been talking about God has the power to forget but God also has the power to remember things and to cause us to remember things amen that we forgot that we were supposed to remember now I'm talking about brother man's life story you know it absolutely astounds me what God remembers not because I thought he had a bad memory it astounds me what God remembers because God remembers certain things God finds certain things valuable that maybe we didn't think were so valuable and I was looking at this story you know brother and talks about when when Sharon Rose died and you know brother Brown he was just in a real bad way we'll just say it that way you know he had he had been so discouraged about his wife sister hope Diane then Sharon Rose died and you know he just couldn't go on without his little girl he was working as a lineman one morning he probably mostly know the story but he was he was working on his alignment one morning he was up there on the poll working on that and he's seeing his shadow it looked like a like Christ on the cross and he began to think about about on a hill far away right so an Old Rugged Cross and he began to think about that and he saw that shadow get cast there he remembered the cross of Jesus but then he got to remembering his little girl he said God you've got my little girl you know brother Brandy just couldn't take it he went to grab that line the next thing you know he was sitting on the ground it should have electrocuted him to death it should have broke every bone in his body when he fell but there he was he was just whole and so it's around Christmas time and you know brother Miami goes into his house he goes to grab the mail the first envelope he sees is Miss Sharon Rose 80 cents Christmas savings now I know some people aren't whatever about Christmas but that's what brother Brown saw there's 80 cents for Miss Sharon Rosie he sees that that envelope for his little girl 80 cents and you know that 80 cents might not be worth a lot to you and I today but it meant something when he saw his daughter's name on that envelope and it started all over again you know if you ever lost somebody real close to you a family member whatever you know how did you it's it's when you're not ready for it amen holidays and stuff you know you you know they're not there their birthday or whatever but when you just going through your daily life and there's just some little reminder that's when it hits you I mean we didn't ask to remember that see that's that's the thing with our memory we don't command its ability to work and not work when we want like God can do he just remembers that and it sets him off again and he just wasn't expecting it it hits him and he he's devastated he goes and he grabs his 38 Special he loads six rounds and it puts to his head and brother Brandon begins praying Our Father Who Art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done and he goes to pull that trigger and now if you know anything about a revolver they're not prone to misfiring amen but he pulls it just as hard as he can and it never Falls and I've I thought about it one day I said you know he prayed the opposite he said thy kingdom come thy will be done well for his will to be done he can't pull that trigger no matter how hard he wanted right no matter how bad he wanted to go on to the next life he's praying thy kingdom come thy will be done and he can't do it frosting he throws the gun down it discharges and the property he falls in the bed he's crying he said I couldn't remember I went to sleep or what but he's just crying on the bed he's overwhelmed with the memory of his grief so of course you know another message he next thing he knows he's he's gone beyond the time he's walking along down the Prairie and he's you know he's got his hat on sees the Wagon Wheel this that and he said there's this beautiful young blonde-headed woman just standing there and her hair is blown and she's dressed in white so the prettiest girl I've ever seen I tip my my hat said how do you do sister and she said hi Dad how looked around said dad said yes I said well I don't understand you call me daddy she said Dad don't you know where you're at this is heaven Donald how was your little Sharon Rose I love this don't you remember you're teaching on immortality now that blows my mind because she probably heard it when she's like three months old she's not gonna remember that but she remembered it she said don't you remember it how does she know because that's how it works there don't you remember what you thought about immortality I remember it and I was a little girl man I teach that there won't be little babies like that in heaven we'll all be one age and one size Immortal you have to always be that way there'll be no real old people no real little bitty babies were all just one age the youth forever said don't you remember you're teaching of immortality she said you're not Sharon yes daddy well sharing honey I don't understand she said where's Billy Paul she remember she had a brother see she remembers it then forget where's Billy Paul said well I left him just a while ago but I don't understand daddy mother's waiting for you up home home honey I've never had home brenhams are vagabonds like I've never had a home but Daddy you've got a home up here turn look this way I look back I've seen the glory of God coming up I've seen a great big pretty mansion there so that's your home Daddy my mother's waiting for you you go on mother wants to see you I want to wait here for Billy well that's what she's waiting on I well praise the Lord I took right up through there I got to the door and she'd come out to meet me and she always did not sickly not all dried up eat up with tubercular she come out with her arms out of that black hair hanging down her back dressed in white held on her arms and run to me grabbed by grabbed her by the hands and knelt down I said oh hope honey I met Sharon didn't our darling make a pretty woman yes Bill she says you're worrying too much honey now listen any of us would have understood hopefully I was worrying so much but she's over there he said you're worrying too much worried how could I keep from worrying I said look you're just worrying about Sharon and I don't worry about us we're so much better off than you are my my changes your perspective doesn't it we're better off than you are well honey everything's been going wrong and everything she said I know all about it see she wasn't ignorant they was going through things she was totally aware I know all about it well listen I'm looking at it different than you are I know all about it she says this now stand up and I stood up and I looked at her I said I look like she did the night she looked like she did the night I married her I looked at her building she said won't you sit down now ah this is this is something else he says I looked and there was like one of them great big Morris chairs sitting there I looked over her said she said I know what you're thinking he begins to tell this story and I'll just I'll paraphrase it here for the second time but he wanted to go buy this chair while he's on Earth and it I think it was 17 he didn't have 17 so he paid a dollar a week and he paid for this chair and he couldn't afford it one week they come and took the chair and so he come home and she's she was worried he was going to be upset so she makes some cherry pie says hey let's go fishing and finally's like he catches on like what's going on you've been real nice to me what's going on and she said well they come in they took that chair and stuff and and uh and he and she said let's he said let's go to the front room and she she says I want to go fishing first he said I know what it was I walked I got up started walking to the door and she'd come put her arms around me they'd come got my chair I worked all day and preach half the night and I'd sit in this chair and study where I'd rest and goes to sleep they'd come gotten it I owed money on it couldn't pay it they'd come to get it and I never will forget how we felt she recognized when we got there standing talking said do you remember that chair they come and go I said yes honey they'll never come and get this one sit down she said promise me you won't worry she put her arms around me said honey I promise you I'd never worry again what's funny to me is you read some of the other life stories is there's one here in particular they come and take his chair brother man tells his wife says sweetheart I just don't care about that chair just let it go now I don't know if he was trying to convince himself or he really didn't whatever but I'm saying this for a reason he had this chair on Earth it got reponey he didn't have a stone he got repossessed and yet he's got the same chair in heaven this is a man's chair I'm not talking about just his kids or whatever the man's chair is there he forgot about it said I don't care about it even but God so cared about a man's chair that he put it in heaven and when he got there oh Hallelujah he gets there and sees his chair that he didn't care about it wasn't a big deal he said don't worry you can sit in this one they won't come and take this one why it's paid for already my my he said well that's up in heaven well will that still exist in the new you know I got to thinking about that that's heaven but what about the new heavens and the new Earth well this one's paid for amen God didn't pay for it to get rid of it in fact you know what Jesus said you lay up your treasure up there and nothing will get to it see if we let our treasure up on the earth moths and and dust and rust can corrupt it but if you lay it up there God will preserve it I believe whatever brother Brennan is doing right now he's going to tear up there somewhere now that sure might not mean a lot to you that might not mean a lot to me but it's not enough to God to put him in his chair in heaven and we're worried how's God going to get this done well my loved ones are going to make it is this going to happen listen if he cares about a man's chair and his dog and his horse God will get you there God will get everything you need to have God will not forget one thing God remembers the things that you forgot but man probably forgot all about that chair amen but God remembered it so that means enough to me to put it there for him don't tell me God is forgetful of our Labor of Love Don't Tell Me God's not got you in the palm of his hand he knows exactly what he's doing he remembers things about you you forget and his in his life he would sit there and be like man I haven't done nothing for God I haven't done this and that man that one around the world seven times a man that brought him maybe a million souls to Christ he sees them beyond the curtain of time it's so easy for us to forget it's so easy for us to get weird and well doing because we forget what we have done what God has allowed us to do and we get discouraged and say you know what I ain't done nothing God remembers everything remembers a chair man I tell you what that's pretty humbling I had a brother coming a while back and he likes shooting his crossbow like brother you know I know that we're supposed to love the Lord first I love him too but and I really like my crossbow do you think I have in heaven I'm like well I don't know hahaha it seems silly but you get to read the message you think about what God is like that's not silly I don't know what he's going to have there exactly I'm not hearing him prophesy but uh God cares enough about little things and I really like that that chair or whatever and God put it there amen I was cleaning the house here a few weeks back brother Doug Siebert and I we were down in we were down in Dayton in this house like a half a million dollar home in Dayton and uh there have been a woman she was older she was living there couldn't take care of herself anymore and so they put her in the nursing home and her and her husband they're pretty well to do as you can probably gather from what I said already you know they had a bunch of money he traded stocks and stuff back in the 90s made a just a killing on on day trading I guess but uh they had all kinds of money and stuff and so we go in this house and it's got a basement and it's a first story a second story she wasn't able to go up and down the stairs for years so stuff just sat there there's all kinds of tools and equipment hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in this house it's it astounded me how much dust was on this stuff hey man all this money and all the stuff that they spent it's just collecting dust amen her husband's in another place and she they don't get along they had two kids a daughter and a son they're grown up the son lives in Japan and the daughter I think she lives in Hawaii or something like that they never come to see Mom and Dad they have nothing to do with them there's all kinds of pictures and family keepsakes and stuff and they come back didn't want any of it and uh you know it hits you a little bit you're sitting there you know they they made all this money they did all this stuff and yet they've got nothing to show for it at the end of the day and I got to thinking about brother Brandon you know he he married two young couples one was a couple of some rich people and he goes up to the house and they're fighting carrying on and then he goes down there in the valley goes that boxcar that poor couple they did the wedding for and you know they they didn't have enough money to buy a dress or do anything but you know what they had love in their home brother asked the question which one of them is the rich one William bran if you could take one of their places who just whose would you take I'd choose that one down there see friends it's all about where we lay our treasure up Martin Luther said I've held many things in my hand in my life and I've I've lost every one of them not holding one of them now but is it everything I've ever put in God's hands he's never lost what does it profit us to gain the world if we lose our soul what's it profit us to lay up treasure down here and get so worried and frustrated as brother Rand would say frustrated it's a couple it's hillbilly word there I guess but we get so frustrated we get so worked up friends lit Treasures where they matter that's why we're that's why we're here today that's right we believe if this has Eternal value to us amen when we get discouraged we we wonder we we lose sleep why but you're laying up treasure all the time friends there's dividends that pays out of the end amen God's mindful about that chair that you like amen God's mindful about that little thing in your life that maybe you even think it's insignificant amen but God says it's important I think of the thief on the cross in Luke 23 one of the male factors they rail against the Lord Jesus this criminal this man that was guilty and he knew he was guilty the first thing he says is don't you fear God that's quite a time to have a revelation you ought to fear God says the guy hanging on the cross because he's a thief he end up where is all said don't you fear God listen we deserve this this man's done nothing wrong and he looks at God he looks at the Lord Jesus and he what does he say he doesn't say listen can you can you coach me into this can you get me a 12-step program can you send me to a good church you know give me some more tapes he says remember me amen listen if you'll remember me there then I know I'll make it Remember Me this day in paradise like Nehemiah if you remember me Lord I know it'll be for good Lord if you remember nothing else please remember me and what does Jesus time this day you will be with me in Paradise Remember Me Lord forget my son I pray forget my failure forget what I've done on my pride and my arrogance but Lord remember me for good Lord if he can't remember anything else if there's one thing Lord please I cling to it in the name of Jesus Christ remember me for good didn't look like there was much for him to remember but Jesus remembered him he remembers us he can't forget us amen this day you'll be with me in Paradise perhaps perhaps if things had gone different that man's life maybe he would have spent his life serving God I don't know it's hard to know what he went through or how he got there and when he was getting ready to get crucified that day he probably wasn't planning to have an encounter with the divine but you know what God give him an opportunity remember me in your kingdom you know it's important today that we know the Lord but it's more important that he knows us we're known of him amasso Paul told the Galatians he knows you he remembers you he knows things about you you don't know about yourself he remembers things about you you don't remember about yourself amen I pray today for each of us God this church this assembly of these people remember us for good Lord help us to remember the good things you've done in our lives Lord help us to remember the things that we can be happy about in our lives we get so distracted with our own failures and our own abilities or what people have done to us Lord help us to remember the things that you remember help us to see things from your perspective I want to have a perspective like Sharon Rose like hope amen I want to see things the way God sees them today in my life in your life listen the older you get that more that means to you amen God remember me because I don't remember it myself I don't remember we'll put my keys half the time God remembers amen God forgives and he forgets but God remembers so whatever your trusting in Him today if he can take care of a chair he can take care of you that's my desire today my prayer for each of us I trust you be I trust you're comforted today amen we don't come asking for some great riches or some particular blessing we come today and we remember what he has done for us yes we have a memorial today God has been faithful in our lives he's been faithful to us Lord remember us and Lord help us never to forget you to always remember you everything you've done everything we go through in life it's all worth it in the end you believe that today God bless you stand to your feet it's a new world it's a better world this one will be remembered as a stepping stone to a greater glory a greater time it's very hard for us it's hard for me in this life to look at the things I go through every day and appreciate the the rough things that you go through why would you none of us enjoys it no no chastening seems Pleasant but think how different it would be if you never went through the trials you went through that's true if you never had a problem you never know that God could solve them you never know what faith in God could do amen how much is that worth for you to know that today was it worth what you went through listen it might not seem like it's worth what you're going through but wasn't worth what you went through already right that it's going to be worth whatever you're going through today that's right amen let's just pray father I pray you just take this simple thought Lord I think of your kindness to me Lord I think of your grace because I stood in that home with my son Lord I have a wife and a family there's men in this world that have got Untold riches they they can't even count their own money that's so there's so much wealth so much that they've achieved that they've accumulated but they don't have peace in their home we don't have the love of God in their home Lord that means more to me than all the money in the world Lord to have brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith here today they love you Lord they love this message they love the Gospel of Jesus Christ they want to serve you they want to they want to do right by you they testify that you've done right unto them you've been faithful Lord that means so much more to me today than money means more to me today than popularity means more to me today than anything the world can offer Lord I pray we just take a moment to remember all the good that you've done to us Lord as we go through trials Lord as we sometimes worry like the prophet worried maybe sometime in our life we felt like giving up like he did I don't know where each one's at today but I do know this if we saw the way that you see it Lord it would be all worth it to us Lord I pray you'd comfort each one in their trial may you encourage each one in the suffering they're going through Lord I'm not here today to marginalize what somebody's going through to tell them it's not a big deal it is a big deal I'm not here to make that to make light of that but I'm here today to magnify that whatever we go through you're greater and you're worth it you remember us for good you've forgotten all our yesterdays you forgot all of our heart and hearts and our bad attitudes and our sins and our iniquities which are many you've washed as wide as as wool white as snow today Lord I'm I pray you help us just to each get a little glimpse of what it's like I think of how it changed the prophet's own perspective he was worrying so much about it when he got over there there was nothing to worry about so many of our problems in our trials we make them bigger than they are father I pray you just help us today to be a little more grateful than we were yesterday to have a little more compassion than we did yesterday to to remember you a little more than we did yesterday Lord we we we ought to always just rehearse and remember we spend so much time in prayer asking for things and how often we forget to thank you how many times in our lives what have you brought to pass that thing that we were praying for and we forget all about what you did for us oh lord it's so easy for us we we're so forgetful at times we're so on grateful at times that I pray he'd help us today just to be a little more mindful our perspective is what changes everything Joseph's perspective changed his entire attitude towards his Brethren towards his circumstances I pray that the Mighty God of Joseph the the god of Manasseh may you cause us to forget our toils and our troubles for just a moment today it was we remember and look to you as being faithful and it's true your words they're true and faithful bless these people I pray I pray their hearts are encouraged you remember them for good just as you remembered a prophet's chair remember us I pray and we thank you father in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you today oh pray just memories how they linger how so they ever fill my soul in the Stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold is it precious to you today you just take a moment and thank the Lord for what he's done in your life if you got love in your home you ought to thank the Lord today even if you have a desire to serve God today you ought to thank him I know you've been through things we've been through things I haven't been what you've been through and you haven't been what I've been through but we're all witnesses that he is faithful please please please don't
