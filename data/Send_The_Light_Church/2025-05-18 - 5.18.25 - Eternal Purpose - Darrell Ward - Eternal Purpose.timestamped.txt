[35:45] Uh this song I'm going to sing, the
[35:48] first time I ever heard it was from
[35:50] Canadians. Brother uh Hild Debrandt's
[35:54] daughter sang this song uh back in a
[35:57] camp meeting if you remember years
[36:01] ago and it was called Time After
[36:08] Time, Time After Time. I hear people say
[36:15] to
[36:16] me, "Why don't we see
[36:20] miracles like they used to
[36:23] be?" I still believe in
[36:27] miracles. God hears us when we
[36:31] pray. For God was God back
[36:35] yesterday and God is God today. God can
[36:41] do it
[36:43] again and again and again. He's the same
[36:50] God today that he's always has been
[36:57] yesterday and
[36:59] forever. He's always the same. And
[37:04] there's no reason to doubt. My God can
[37:09] do it
[37:11] again. You ask God to meet your needs,
[37:15] so why not trust in him?
[37:20] God has done it all before. He said
[37:23] he'll do it all again. Amen. He's
[37:27] willing, much more willing than I could
[37:31] ever say to perform a mighty
[37:37] miracle within your life today. God can
[37:42] do it
[37:44] again and again and again. He's the same
[37:51] God today that he's always has been
[37:57] yesterday and
[38:00] forever. He's always the
[38:05] same. So God bless you. I just
[38:10] God can do it again.
[38:13] Thank you, brother Ray. Praise the Lord.
[38:16] That was perfect. Amen. He is the same
[38:18] yesterday, today, and forever.
[38:23] And if we just we always remember that
[38:25] through the course of the day. Every
[38:27] time the enemy comes and tries to say
[38:29] no,
[38:30] say yes, he's the same yesterday, today,
[38:32] and forever, he can do it again. Amen.
[38:35] Yeah. I think we trust in the blood of
[38:37] Jesus Christ. Every day we ask God to
[38:41] forgive us of our sins and to cleanse
[38:42] us. Every single day. And we do not
[38:45] doubt that. We have to believe him for
[38:47] the rest of the word, right? Not just to
[38:50] forgive us, but that he can help us. He
[38:53] can deliver us. He can meet every single
[38:55] need. Amen. Well, we're we're going to
[38:58] stand together and uh invite Brother
[39:00] Daryl to come and give us the bread of
[39:03] life to us today. Um I want to welcome
[39:07] each of you. I should have said this
[39:09] before. This is our 24th
[39:12] anniversary. 24 years. and some who's uh
[39:16] who's been here from since the
[39:19] beginning. One, brother Ron, sister
[39:22] Lori, God bless this Lord. She's feeling
[39:23] better. God bless you. So, praise the
[39:26] Lord. They that endure to the end. And I
[39:30] I I'll say it like this. There's many
[39:32] that have come and gone.
[39:35] And they've seen
[39:37] them. Some have stayed a while and left.
[39:41] But praise God for the predestinated
[39:44] seed.
[39:46] Amen. And we just appreciate each and
[39:49] every one of you that has made this your
[39:51] home church. And my prayer is that God
[39:53] would give you rapturing faith to get
[39:55] out of here.
[39:57] Amen. And give you the revelation that
[39:59] is needed. Amen. Amen. Let's sing Only
[40:03] Believe as our brother comes to give us
[40:05] the words of life. Amen.
[40:09] Only
[40:12] believe.
[40:14] Only
[40:17] believe. All things are
[40:21] [Music]
[40:22] possible.
[40:24] Only
[40:27] believe.
[40:28] Only
[40:31] believe.
[40:33] Only believe.
[40:36] Believe all things are
[40:40] possible.
[40:42] Only
[40:45] believe.
[40:46] Lord, I
[40:49] believe.
[40:51] Lord, I
[40:54] believe. All things are
[40:58] possible. Lord, I believe.
[41:02] [Music]
[41:17] Lord, I believe.
[41:23] Praise the Lord.
[41:25] Isn't he good?
[41:27] Amen.
[41:29] Just such a warm,
[41:32] sweet spirit in here this morning.
[41:33] Hallelujah. Amen. And you know, we're
[41:37] living in such a troublesome time.
[41:43] Wars and rumors of wars and pestilence
[41:45] and famines and violence in the land and
[41:48] all these things that he said would be
[41:50] here are here. Amen. Amen. Yeah. But the
[41:54] most wonderful thing about that is that
[41:56] the one who told us those things would
[41:58] be here also said in the evening time
[42:03] there shall be light. And I'm so
[42:05] grateful that we're not part of the
[42:07] darkness. But we have been called out of
[42:09] the darkness into his marvelous light by
[42:12] the grace of almighty God. Amen. Is that
[42:14] not true? There's nothing that we ever
[42:16] done but only by his grace. Amen. And so
[42:21] we stand here this morning by his grace.
[42:23] Amen. Knowing that he'll keep every
[42:26] word. Thank you, Jesus. Every word he'll
[42:28] keep. Is that not true? Nations will lie
[42:31] to us. Governments lie to us.
[42:33] Politicians. Oh, God.
[42:37] Even sometimes people closest to us will
[42:39] lie to us. True. But the word of God
[42:42] will never lie to us.
[42:45] And that's where I anchor today. Not not
[42:47] on an organization, not on a
[42:48] denomination, but I anchor my soul on
[42:51] the word of God. Amen. For heavens and
[42:53] earth will pass away, yet the word of
[42:55] God shall never fail. Amen. Amen. God
[42:58] bless you. Certainly good to be here
[42:59] today. If you have your Bibles, turn
[43:00] with the book of Ephesians. We want to
[43:02] read from one verse there.
[43:04] Ephesians chapter 3 11. Greeting the
[43:07] name of the Lord Jesus. We count it an
[43:09] honor that brother John allowed us to
[43:11] come and be a part of the anniversary
[43:13] meetings here this weekend. And so we
[43:15] want to kind of take a thought along
[43:16] those lines and we trust it'll be a
[43:18] blessing to you. Appreciate each one
[43:19] coming out and the folks from Canada. My
[43:21] my brings back some good memories of
[43:23] being up there ministering with you in
[43:24] Canada. We always enjoy those times and
[43:26] certainly good to see everyone today.
[43:28] Amen. I want to read now from Ephesians
[43:30] chapter 3 verse 11. Do you love him?
[43:36] Amen. The Bible says
[43:39] this. according to the eternal
[43:42] purpose which he purposed in Christ
[43:45] Jesus our Lord. Now that word eternal
[43:49] means without beginning and end which
[43:51] always has been and always will be.
[43:55] Without beginning, without end, never to
[43:58] cease,
[43:59] everlasting. Amen. You say, "Brother
[44:02] Daryl, that's not much scripture." It's
[44:04] enough. Let us bow our heads. I want to
[44:07] speak to you for a few minutes this
[44:08] morning on God's undefeable
[44:11] eternal purpose. Amen. Heavenly Father,
[44:16] thy word is true. We commit this
[44:19] congregation and oursel into your hands
[44:22] for your glory in Jesus name. God bless
[44:25] you saints. You may be seated this
[44:27] morning.
[44:29] Now, if you don't mind me reading from
[44:31] the prophet of God, he says, "Now, I
[44:32] want to draw this first into your mind.
[44:35] That there's not one thing that can
[44:36] destroy us until the purpose of he who
[44:40] created us has been fulfilled. There
[44:43] could be nothing that will destroy us
[44:45] until his purpose for us, amen, has been
[44:48] fulfilled." So then we find out this
[44:50] morning, we are made for a purpose. This
[44:53] church was built here for a purpose. The
[44:55] foundation was not dug. The building,
[44:57] the roof, and the interior was not put
[44:58] here just to see if it could be done,
[45:00] but it was put here for a purpose. Your
[45:03] home that you live in was not just
[45:04] accidentally put there by somebody just
[45:07] wasting their time, but your home was
[45:09] made for a purpose. And I don't know
[45:10] about you, but I'm glad I've got one
[45:12] this morning. Amen. Your home was made
[45:14] for a purpose. It was made to serve a
[45:16] purpose. The automobile that you drove
[45:18] here in this morning was not made just
[45:20] to see if it could be made. But the
[45:22] material was not wasted by man. It was
[45:24] made for a purpose and to serve a
[45:26] purpose. And I'm glad it was. It was a
[45:28] lot better than walking. Amen. The
[45:30] clothes that you wear was not just put
[45:32] on or not just fashioned to see if
[45:34] somebody could fashion something, but it
[45:36] was put there for a purpose. And we're
[45:38] certainly glad of that this morning. The
[45:40] food that you eat was not grown on the
[45:42] earth just to see if it could be grown.
[45:44] But it was grown for a purpose. Amen.
[45:47] And God does not make a tree just to
[45:49] make a tree just to see if he can make a
[45:51] tree. But he made a tree for a purpose.
[45:54] And so if we see that with the house and
[45:56] the car and the automobile and the
[45:57] fashions in the trees and we know that
[46:00] God, oh my. And God did not make you
[46:03] just to see if he could make you. But he
[46:06] made us for a purpose. Therefore,
[46:08] there's a purpose for all of us being
[46:10] here this morning. You're not here just
[46:12] to be another human being. You are here
[46:15] because God made you for some purpose.
[46:18] Amen. You're not here just to eat the
[46:19] food that God grow. You're not here just
[46:21] to live in the house that man made or to
[46:23] wear the clothes that someone fashioned.
[46:24] But you are here for a specific purpose.
[46:27] The trees, God did not make trees like
[46:29] that. He made them that way because
[46:31] that's the way he wanted them. He could
[46:32] have made a tree out of anything he
[46:34] wanted to make it out of. But he made it
[46:36] for a purpose. Amen. He could have made
[46:38] the flowers any way he wanted to make
[46:40] flowers, but he made them for a purpose
[46:42] to give witness. To give a testimony.
[46:45] Amen. You see, the nature was put here
[46:47] as a witness. as a testimony that we
[46:49] serve the true and living God. Amen. The
[46:53] prophet said he made them to bear
[46:55] witness for they are God's witnesses.
[46:56] They are a true witness that all other
[46:58] religions is false.
[47:01] Amen. Let me say that again. All other
[47:04] religions is false and Jesus Christ is
[47:07] right. Why? Because nature itself
[47:10] teaches of a death, a burial, and a
[47:12] resurrection. Amen. It gives witness
[47:14] that we are not dead eternally but we
[47:17] live again. Amen. Amen. It shows us
[47:20] supreme intelligence. Look at the sun.
[47:22] You watch the sun when it comes up in
[47:24] the morning. What happens to the sun?
[47:26] It's a little baby born in the morning.
[47:29] Amen. Rising up in the east. About 10:00
[47:32] it's a teenager. About noon it's in its
[47:35] strength. In the afternoon it's middle
[47:37] age. In the evening time it's gone. It
[47:41] sets. Is that's the finish? Is that all
[47:43] there is of the sun? No. God's got a
[47:46] purpose for the sun. So what does the
[47:48] sun do? It comes back again. It rises
[47:51] again. And the next morning it comes
[47:53] back up again. What does it speak of?
[47:55] Birth, life, death, resurrection.
[47:58] And it goes to show it was made by a
[48:00] great supreme intelligence to serve a
[48:03] purpose. It's here for a purpose. And I
[48:06] say this morning, if that's true for the
[48:08] trees, if that's true for the flowers,
[48:10] if that's true for the
[48:12] sun, then what about you?
[48:17] No matter how little you are, how big
[48:20] you are, how important you are, how
[48:22] unimportant you are, you are here to
[48:25] serve a purpose. Just as my finger is
[48:29] here for a purpose, the nail on my
[48:31] finger is for a purpose. my eye, every
[48:33] part of our bodies is to serve a
[48:35] purpose. It was not just put here to see
[48:37] if it could be put here just to see what
[48:39] it would look like. But it was put here
[48:41] to serve a purpose. It was God's divine
[48:44] plan to do so.
[48:48] And if we're put here for a purpose,
[48:50] then there is nothing that can destroy
[48:51] us until God's purpose is fulfilled.
[48:56] Nothing can harm us until the purpose
[48:58] that God has put us here for has been
[49:00] made manifest. No matter how much
[49:02] trouble we have, he never said we
[49:04] wouldn't have trouble. He never said we
[49:06] wouldn't have problem. He never said we
[49:07] wouldn't have sickness. He never said we
[49:09] wouldn't cry. Is that true? He never
[49:11] said that. He never promised smooth
[49:13] sailing. But he did say, "I'll be with
[49:15] you even in you." Hallelujah.
[49:19] Amen. No matter how much sorrow we have
[49:21] or trouble we have or what we go
[49:23] through, all these are reasons. There's
[49:25] a reason for it. But nothing we face in
[49:27] life will defeat the purpose that God
[49:30] has put here for your life. The
[49:32] undefeable eternal purpose of God. God
[49:35] placed you here. We are a true witness
[49:37] of God that all other religions is false
[49:40] and Jesus Christ is right.
[49:43] Amen. Hallelujah. We was put here to
[49:46] show a purpose. We was put here to prove
[49:48] that the religion that we serve, the God
[49:50] that we serve is the true and living
[49:53] God.
[49:54] Amen. Go with me for a minute in your
[49:57] minds. Let's just go back for a moment.
[50:00] Before there was ever an angel, before
[50:02] there was a star, a
[50:05] planet, there was no air, there was no
[50:07] light, there was no stars, there was no
[50:09] world, there was nothing
[50:11] else. It was just God
[50:14] and God alone. Ella, Elah, which means
[50:18] the self-existing one. There was nothing
[50:21] else existed but him. a self-existing
[50:25] one that we called God. But before he
[50:27] was ever anything to worship him, before
[50:31] he was even known as a God, he was the
[50:34] selfexisting one. And this self-existing
[50:37] one had a desire. He had a purpose,
[50:39] something that he wanted to achieve. And
[50:41] he purposed within himself that he would
[50:44] do this thing. And he spoke, "Let there
[50:46] be light." And there was light. Why? He
[50:49] purposed it. And the darkness, oh God,
[50:52] the darkness could not stop the light
[50:55] from coming forth. No matter how
[50:57] mysterious it seems, God always keeps
[51:00] his word. No matter how unreasonable it
[51:03] may seem to be to people, God will keep
[51:06] his word. Thank you, Jesus. In 1954, God
[51:11] spoke through the lips of a prophet and
[51:13] said, "There will be a pope come out of
[51:15] the United States."
[51:18] This day, this prophecy has been
[51:20] fulfilled.
[51:22] Is that right? God's word will never be
[51:25] defeated. If God says it, it will
[51:27] happen.
[51:28] I remember many years ago when my
[51:30] daughter after we came through the
[51:32] accident and all that the Lord had done
[51:33] for her, I got a call from the insurance
[51:35] company and this woman, she said, "Mr.
[51:37] Ward," I said, "Yes, ma'am." She said,
[51:39] "I I know this is kind of unusual." She
[51:41] said, "But I know you're a man of
[51:42] faith." And she said, "I I want to ask
[51:44] you something." I said, "Yes, ma'am."
[51:46] She said, 'We've got this uh little boy
[51:48] and he got choked on a hot dog and
[51:50] suffered a brain injury and said his
[51:52] father is a pastor of a church and his
[51:54] his mother and said his mother's telling
[51:56] everybody that God told her before the
[51:59] boy turns three he will speak. And I
[52:03] said, "Yes, ma'am." And she said, "Well,
[52:04] Mr. Ward said his birthday's just a
[52:06] couple of days off and there's no
[52:08] indication at all that the boy will ever
[52:11] speak again. He's severely brain injury
[52:13] from a lack of oxygen." And she said,
[52:15] 'I'm afraid when it don't happen that
[52:17] it'll destroy this woman because she's
[52:19] telling everybody. And she said, 'What
[52:21] do you think?' And I said, 'Well, ma'am,
[52:23] you know, I'm I'm not really that smart,
[52:25] but there's one thing I know. If God
[52:27] said the boy will talk before he's
[52:29] three, it may be one second before his
[52:31] third birthday, but the boy will speak
[52:33] because God does not lie.
[52:38] Hallelujah. God keeps his word. And if
[52:40] God makes a promise of anything, God
[52:42] will keep that promise. Now you and I
[52:44] will make a promise but things happen
[52:46] that we have to break it. Is that not
[52:48] true? But not with God. Amen. God being
[52:51] infinite then when he knows of the
[52:52] future from the beginning and he doesn't
[52:54] make a promise unless he knows what's
[52:56] going to happen. And he always keeps his
[52:59] promise. God don't make a promise unless
[53:01] he knows he's going to keep it. And God
[53:03] purposed to prove his word to be the
[53:05] truth. Amen. The prophet said, "I don't
[53:08] believe God heals the people just to
[53:10] show his power to heal. But I believe he
[53:12] heals people to show that he fulfills
[53:15] his word and keeps his promise. And when
[53:18] he came on the earth the first time, he
[53:20] said he did this that it might be
[53:22] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[53:24] prophets. Because all of God's word must
[53:28] be fulfilled. Amen. Amen. And God's
[53:32] purpose can never be defeated. There is
[53:34] nothing that can defeat it. So how happy
[53:37] we ought to be. Amen.
[53:40] Are you happy?
[53:42] You ought to let your face know.
[53:44] Hallelujah. Smile a little bit. It ain't
[53:46] going to hurt us. Amen. Amen. You ought
[53:50] to be happy.
[53:53] Amen. Praise the
[53:55] Lord. Amen. Do you love him this
[53:57] morning? Amen. How happy we ought to be
[54:01] resting upon the beautiful revelation of
[54:03] the word of the living God that there's
[54:05] neither things present. There's neither
[54:07] things that can come. There's no
[54:08] sickness, no sorrow, no death, no pearl,
[54:11] no nothing else can separate us from the
[54:14] purpose of the living God. What God has
[54:16] imagined in his mind, what God has
[54:18] purposed in his heart to bring to pass.
[54:20] There is no demon, there is no power,
[54:22] there is nothing that can ever separate
[54:24] God's great immortal eternal plan. It
[54:28] must be as God hath said. Amen.
[54:31] Hallelujah. God said, "Let a virgin
[54:34] conceive and bring forth a child." And
[54:36] it was as God said. God said, "Behold, I
[54:38] send you Elijah the prophet before for
[54:40] the coming and great and dreadful day of
[54:42] the Lord." And it was as God said. And
[54:45] God said, "There'll be a bride. It shall
[54:47] be bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh,
[54:49] spirit of my spirit, life of my life."
[54:52] She is him. And it is as God hath
[54:56] said. Amen. Do you think that God, the
[55:00] heavenly father, will ever be defeated
[55:02] in his purpose? Even though Satan has
[55:04] done what he's done, it's an
[55:06] impossibility. He will not be defeated
[55:10] and he's given us perfect assurance
[55:14] that we have nothing to be scared about.
[55:17] Oh, they're talking about nuclear
[55:18] holocaust. Let them push the button
[55:20] before the bomb ever hits this nation.
[55:23] The bride will be gone.
[55:25] Don't ain't worried about nuclear war. I
[55:27] ain't worried about these. I ain't
[55:28] worried about plagues. He said they
[55:29] would be here, but he said I'll not
[55:31] leave you. Amen.
[55:34] He's given us perfect assurance, we got
[55:37] nothing to be scared about. What the
[55:39] Father has purposed in your life can
[55:42] never be defeated.
[55:46] Amen. You say, "You got any scripture
[55:48] for that?" I sure do. I appreciate you
[55:49] asking. Look at David. David was
[55:52] anointed by this pro great prophet
[55:55] Samuel. Is that right? Yeah. To be a
[55:58] king. That's right. Anointed by the
[56:01] prophet Samuel to be a king. And between
[56:03] the ages of 10 and 15 years old, he was
[56:06] just a
[56:07] teenager. And this giant by the name of
[56:09] Goliath, made this great boast. And
[56:13] David, just a boy standing before
[56:15] Goliath who was 9 foot 9 in tall. And
[56:20] even Saul the king, tried to discourage
[56:23] David by telling him, "You're just a boy
[56:27] and Goliath is a warrior. since he was a
[56:30] boy.
[56:32] Everything around him tried to
[56:34] discourage him. Oh God. But the giant
[56:37] that stood before David didn't see the
[56:39] God who stood with David.
[56:42] If he would have done that, he'd have
[56:44] been on his knees. For God done said,
[56:46] "David would reign as a king. And how
[56:49] can he die by a giant as a boy and reign
[56:52] as a king?"
[56:54] So David took God at his word. And as
[56:56] far as the word was concerned, Goliath
[56:59] was defeated before the battle ever
[57:01] started.
[57:03] Hallelujah.
[57:04] Before D well, brother, he picked up
[57:07] five stones. Yes, he did. But not in
[57:09] case he missed four times.
[57:13] He picked up five stones.
[57:17] Because Goliath had four brothers and
[57:20] David said, "I'll just kill them all."
[57:22] Amen.
[57:24] Amen. Amen.
[57:26] Amen. God's purpose for David's life
[57:29] could not be defeated by a giant. And no
[57:33] giant that tries to rise over your
[57:35] lifeless
[57:37] can defeat God's purpose for your life.
[57:41] Don't be afraid of the giants.
[57:45] Shadrach,
[57:46] Meso, when they heated up the furnace
[57:49] seven times hotter than it had ever been
[57:52] heated before.
[57:54] And they said, "We don't know whether
[57:56] God will or not, but there's one thing
[57:58] we do know. Our God is able to deliver
[58:02] us, and nonetheless, we will not bow our
[58:05] knee to an image." You see, God had
[58:09] someone who would serve him, and his
[58:11] purpose would not be defeated. Amen. You
[58:14] what that tells me? Fire. They threw him
[58:17] in the
[58:18] furnace. And what did they do? They took
[58:20] a Sunday afternoon stroll. They was
[58:23] walking in the fiery furnace. Amen. And
[58:26] the king said, "Didn't we throw three of
[58:28] them in there? I see four."
[58:32] Hallelujah.
[58:35] God had someone who to serve him. And
[58:37] the fire could not defeat the purpose of
[58:39] God's plan. Oh, and I'd like to say this
[58:42] morning, all the hydrogen bombs in this
[58:44] world can never defeat the resurrection
[58:47] of his church. Amen.
[58:50] All the explaining away, all the
[58:51] mathematics, all the intelligence of
[58:53] this world disguised as a purpose to do
[58:56] something to destroy the faith of God's
[58:59] children. All this believe the sign
[59:01] nonsense and all this books that they
[59:03] got on Amazon, no matter what they put
[59:05] on the internet, it will never never
[59:08] defeat God's purpose. That faith that
[59:11] God placed in our hearts will live on
[59:14] forever. Amen.
[59:17] Amen. as it was written of Moses when it
[59:20] was taught in all the wisdom of the
[59:22] Egyptians.
[59:24] Yet he knew God had a purpose in his
[59:26] life. Yeah. And it was Yose his mother
[59:30] who took her darling baby. Think about
[59:32] this. A little baby and she put him in
[59:35] an ark and shoved him out into the Nile
[59:37] where the crocodiles were fat on Hebrew
[59:39] children. Now, why would a mother in her
[59:42] right mind ever place her baby in a
[59:44] basket and put him into the river where
[59:46] the crocodiles had been eaten? Hebrew
[59:48] children. True. Why would she do that?
[59:52] She took her baby and shoved it right
[59:54] out into the jaws of death, knowing that
[59:56] God's purpose, hallelujah, would never
[59:59] be defeated. Yes, sir. That the God of
[1:00:02] Abraham would take care of her baby.
[1:00:04] There wasn't enough crocodiles in all
[1:00:05] the world that could have swallowed him.
[1:00:07] He was God's chosen vessel. Amen.
[1:00:11] Hallelujah. And he was called for that
[1:00:13] purpose.
[1:00:15] Glory. Hallelujah. And we are God's
[1:00:18] chosen today who believe in the
[1:00:20] resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And
[1:00:22] there's no bomb. There's no hell. There
[1:00:24] is nothing else that can destroy God's
[1:00:27] purpose. Amen.
[1:00:30] Amen. We've got to go in the
[1:00:32] resurrection.
[1:00:34] Cuz God promised we would. Thank you,
[1:00:37] God's undefeable, eternal purpose. Think
[1:00:41] of Joseph and Mary. And God said the
[1:00:43] child was to be born in Bethlehem.
[1:00:47] Is that right? Not on the road to
[1:00:50] Bethlehem. Not on the hill outside the
[1:00:53] city of Bethlehem. Not at the welcome to
[1:00:56] Bethlehem
[1:00:57] sign. No. No. It had to be Bethlehem
[1:01:02] because God said so. Yes, sir. Don't be
[1:01:06] afraid of the journey.
[1:01:10] Don't worry about the mule dying. Don't
[1:01:12] worry about the thieves on the road.
[1:01:14] Journey to the purpose. The child will
[1:01:17] be born in Bethlehem. The word will
[1:01:19] become flesh in Bethlehem. Oh little
[1:01:23] bride, don't be afraid of the journey.
[1:01:25] We were born for a purpose to do what?
[1:01:27] To reproduce Jesus Christ in the flesh
[1:01:30] again. Not in a quote book, not in a
[1:01:32] tape player, but in my flesh, in your
[1:01:34] flesh. That's what God pro that's what
[1:01:37] the message was sent for. Amen. We were
[1:01:40] born for a purpose to reproduce Jesus
[1:01:42] Christ in the flesh again. And God
[1:01:45] watched over the magi because they had
[1:01:47] the appropriate gifts to identify his
[1:01:49] presence on the earth. And God will
[1:01:51] watch over this bride. For we have the
[1:01:53] appropriate gifts.
[1:01:58] Hallelujah. To identify his presence on
[1:02:02] the earth.
[1:02:04] There was nothing that would stop those
[1:02:05] magi from getting to Jesus. They were
[1:02:08] born to identify him on the earth. Oh,
[1:02:12] are you hearing me this morning? They
[1:02:14] were born to identify him here on the
[1:02:17] earth.
[1:02:18] Then what have you been put here on the
[1:02:20] earth to do?
[1:02:22] Just to go to church when you feel like
[1:02:24] it. Read your Bible when you feel like
[1:02:26] it.
[1:02:28] We were born for a purpose. God could
[1:02:30] have put you in any age he wanted to put
[1:02:32] you in. He could have put you in
[1:02:33] Luther's day or Wesley's day or
[1:02:35] Pentecost restoration of the gifts. But
[1:02:37] God placed you in this end time message,
[1:02:40] in this end time age for a purpose.
[1:02:42] Amen. And all the ages, he could have
[1:02:45] put us here and we could have followed
[1:02:46] Jesus. We could have walked right behind
[1:02:48] him as he walked on the shores of
[1:02:49] Galilee. But God purposed within himself
[1:02:52] to place you in this age. And let me
[1:02:54] tell you, saints of God, he did not
[1:02:55] place us here to give up. He did not
[1:02:57] place us here to fail. He did not place
[1:02:59] us here to denominate. But he placed us
[1:03:02] here to reproduce Jesus Christ in the
[1:03:05] flesh again. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:03:09] Amen. We have been put here to identify
[1:03:11] him on the earth again. When you really
[1:03:14] realize that God has revealed to you the
[1:03:16] truth of the thing, there's nothing in
[1:03:18] the world that's going to defeat you in
[1:03:19] it. You are absolutely undefeable.
[1:03:23] Amen. I'm not talking about this flesh.
[1:03:25] This flesh. I'm not talking about that.
[1:03:27] But I'm talking about the God that's in
[1:03:29] you. Amen.
[1:03:32] Not Christ, not the body, but the word
[1:03:34] that was in him. Not Mary,
[1:03:37] but the word that was born from her.
[1:03:39] Then let's go from here this morning
[1:03:41] with this understanding. We will not be
[1:03:44] defeated. There is nothing that is
[1:03:46] coming. There is nothing that Satan is
[1:03:48] bringing that can stop this bride.
[1:03:52] She is unstoppable, undefeable. For she
[1:03:54] was born for a per. We may have trials.
[1:03:57] We may have troubles. But there is
[1:03:58] nothing that'll stop this bride from
[1:04:01] fulfilling the purpose of God. I make a
[1:04:04] Baptist shout for this bride will not be
[1:04:08] defeated and God's purpose will not be
[1:04:12] defeated. He has given us perfect
[1:04:15] assurance that we the bride will not be
[1:04:19] defeated. We have nothing to fear.
[1:04:25] Hallelujah. You were made for eternal
[1:04:28] purpose. Amen. because you're the
[1:04:30] manifestation of an attribute that was
[1:04:32] in God before the foundation of the
[1:04:36] world. The prophet of God said he wrote
[1:04:38] your name with Jesus and put it in the
[1:04:41] lamb's book of life before the
[1:04:43] foundation of the world. Now, why would
[1:04:46] he associate your name with Jesus?
[1:04:48] That's why Jesus is not ashamed to call
[1:04:50] you brother. Praise God. Because we have
[1:04:55] the same daddy. Yes.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:05:01] I I I like genealogy to see where you
[1:05:03] come from. You know,
[1:05:06] you got to have a brave heart when you
[1:05:08] do that. I'm telling you.
[1:05:10] You know, you you have your DNA, right?
[1:05:13] Do you know you get 50% of your DNA
[1:05:14] comes from your daddy and 50% of your
[1:05:17] DNA comes from your mama? That's why
[1:05:19] some people look at you and they see
[1:05:20] your daddy and others say, "No, you look
[1:05:22] just like your mama." You know why? cuz
[1:05:24] you got you share in their DNA. Well, if
[1:05:27] that's true in the natural, it's true in
[1:05:30] the spiritual. Yeah. So, I thought,
[1:05:32] well, if that's true, there must be
[1:05:33] something. The Bible, the answer to
[1:05:34] every question lays in the Bible. So, we
[1:05:37] find out that the prophet of God said
[1:05:40] that we drink from the breast of El
[1:05:42] Shadi. Hallelujah. So, that makes God
[1:05:44] our mother.
[1:05:47] And then we find out that God is our
[1:05:49] father. So, 50% of my spiritual DNA
[1:05:53] comes from my mother. and fill them.
[1:05:56] And 50% of my spiritual DNA come from my
[1:05:58] daddy. Then what does that make you? It
[1:06:00] makes you all God. God manifested in
[1:06:03] your flesh. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:05] Hallelujah.
[1:06:07] Oh, do you love him? We have nothing to
[1:06:10] fear. Think about that. You were made
[1:06:12] for eternal purpose. God thought of you
[1:06:14] and expressed you and he made this
[1:06:16] earth. Thank you, Jesus. To take you out
[1:06:18] of it, to make you a human being. Every
[1:06:21] man that comes to Christ must first be
[1:06:23] childrained for the purpose that God has
[1:06:25] ordained for you. And remember, if you
[1:06:28] can just be still, keep quiet. He's
[1:06:30] called you for this, there's nothing
[1:06:32] that'll keep it from happening. There's
[1:06:34] not enough devils in torment, but what
[1:06:36] God's word will be made manifest.
[1:06:40] Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] You were born for a purpose and nobody
[1:06:44] can take your place.
[1:06:49] Nobody. I can't take brother Brandham's
[1:06:52] place, but brother Brandon can't take my
[1:06:53] place. I can't take brother John's
[1:06:55] place, but brother John can't take my
[1:06:57] place. Well, I can't pray like brother
[1:06:58] John, but he can't pray like you. Oh,
[1:07:00] God. God made us each way. He wants to
[1:07:03] use us.
[1:07:05] Amen. You may have everybody tried to
[1:07:07] boy. Everybody wants to be like brother
[1:07:08] John. That's impersonation. Just be what
[1:07:11] God made you.
[1:07:13] Amen. Amen. That's where every Christian
[1:07:16] ought to stand knowing trials will come
[1:07:17] up and seem every way for you. But
[1:07:19] remember, God has a purpose and it will
[1:07:22] all work out right. The desert places,
[1:07:26] the bitter water, it will all Don't you
[1:07:29] understand, friends? God told Moses,
[1:07:30] "When you bring the children out of
[1:07:32] Egypt, they shall worship me upon this
[1:07:34] mountain." Then there ain't no desert.
[1:07:36] There ain't no bitter water. There ain't
[1:07:37] no There ain't no Pharaoh's army. There
[1:07:40] ain't nothing that'll stop them from
[1:07:41] getting there. Because as far as God was
[1:07:43] concerned, they was already there. And
[1:07:45] as far as God is concerned, we've
[1:07:47] already raptured.
[1:07:51] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:53] Hallelujah. Amen. Trials will come up
[1:07:56] seem every way for you, but God has a
[1:07:58] purpose and it will all work out right.
[1:08:01] What was Jesus manifested for? Why was
[1:08:03] he manifested? To show God.
[1:08:07] Did not he say, "When you see me, you
[1:08:09] see the father, for I am the father of
[1:08:11] one." What was he manifested for? To
[1:08:14] show God. And he sent that life that he
[1:08:16] lived by back to the church. We call it
[1:08:20] the Holy
[1:08:22] Ghost purpose. What was God's purpose in
[1:08:25] sending the Holy Spirit? God's purpose
[1:08:28] was sending it was to find the mind. He
[1:08:30] sent it for one purpose that God himself
[1:08:33] might dwell in his church. Amen. And
[1:08:37] continue his plans through that church.
[1:08:42] He sent the Holy Ghost not just so we'd
[1:08:44] shout, though I like to shout. Not just
[1:08:46] so we jump, though I like to jump. But
[1:08:48] he sent it for a purpose.
[1:08:51] That the life he lived might be
[1:08:53] continued. Amen. In a body called the
[1:08:56] bride. Lord, oh God. that God himself,
[1:09:00] think of it, not an organization, not a
[1:09:03] denomination, not an apostles creed, but
[1:09:06] God himself
[1:09:08] dwelling in his church. God was in
[1:09:12] Christ, continuing his plans through
[1:09:14] Christ and out of Christ into his
[1:09:16] church,
[1:09:17] continuing his work through his church.
[1:09:21] He was God. He had to be. No man could
[1:09:23] die. No prophet could die. He was God.
[1:09:25] He was the God of the prophets. Speaking
[1:09:27] of Christ, he was the prophet. He was
[1:09:29] the kings. He was the history. He was
[1:09:31] that was to come. He was that that is
[1:09:34] and that was to come and that's to be in
[1:09:36] this day. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:39] forever. He was manifested for that
[1:09:42] purpose. You see, if we have to go back
[1:09:45] to 65 to find God, he's the God of
[1:09:47] history. True. Is that not true? But we
[1:09:50] don't have to go back to 65. He's here
[1:09:53] right now. He's healing right now. He's
[1:09:56] raising the dead right now.
[1:10:00] Amen. Oh God, thank you Lord.
[1:10:04] Amen. And through this purpose, he
[1:10:07] achieved a church that the fullness of
[1:10:09] God might bring to pass every promise of
[1:10:12] God in these last days when he gets the
[1:10:16] preeminence. You see, God don't need my
[1:10:18] education. God don't need my ability.
[1:10:20] God don't He just needs my skin. Amen.
[1:10:26] He just wants to dwell in this tent.
[1:10:29] Yes.
[1:10:31] That his purpose could be achieved for
[1:10:33] the church that they might express him
[1:10:35] in his fullness. The primitance in the
[1:10:38] church, the position that he placed in
[1:10:39] the church. He that believeth on me, did
[1:10:42] not he say, "He that believeth on me,
[1:10:44] the works I do, there shall they do
[1:10:45] also, and greater works than these shall
[1:10:47] he do?" Amen. What's greater than
[1:10:50] raising the dead? What's greater than
[1:10:52] casting out? What's greater than
[1:10:53] creating bread and fish, right? But that
[1:10:56] greater doesn't mean something greater
[1:10:57] than what he done. But that greater
[1:10:59] means more. Because you see what he
[1:11:02] done, he done it in a body called Jesus.
[1:11:04] One man performing miracles. But now
[1:11:06] that same anointing is in a many
[1:11:08] membered bride. And more works are being
[1:11:10] done around the world.
[1:11:13] Why more works, greater works? Because
[1:11:15] it's a many membered body now
[1:11:17] manifesting that same life Christ
[1:11:20] manifested. Amen.
[1:11:23] Amen. Amen. Today, he wants to get
[1:11:26] somebody that can so see it that they
[1:11:29] can let the word manifest through them.
[1:11:34] Amen. You see, the gift is not how hard
[1:11:37] you study. The gift is in how much you
[1:11:40] can yield.
[1:11:42] Amen. How much you can allow the spirit
[1:11:45] of God to manifest through you. Amen.
[1:11:51] Amen. Jesus so seen it. He was so
[1:11:53] perfectly born for the day until God
[1:11:55] think about this. God expressed every
[1:11:58] move that he made. He was God's
[1:12:00] revelation. He was God revealed.
[1:12:04] Did not he say, "Have not I been with
[1:12:06] you all this time and yet you don't know
[1:12:07] who I am?" Right? He was God's
[1:12:11] revelation. He was God's thoughts being
[1:12:14] manifested. Hallelujah.
[1:12:16] Amen. He was God revealed then this
[1:12:20] ransom church of the last day purposed
[1:12:22] by God to be here. I want you to
[1:12:24] understand we are not here by mistake.
[1:12:27] No, he purposed us here. What is she?
[1:12:30] Not a creed, not a dogma, not a cult.
[1:12:32] She's God's revelation. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:36] She's God revealed in flesh. Once again,
[1:12:40] Christ, the mystery of God revealed. All
[1:12:42] God was, he poured into Christ. Right.
[1:12:44] All Christ is, he has poured into his
[1:12:46] church. Then Christ is the mystery of
[1:12:49] God revealed. But the bride is the
[1:12:51] revelation of where Christ is.
[1:12:56] A little while the world will see me no
[1:12:57] more, but ye shall see me. For I'll be
[1:13:00] with you even in you. Then where is he
[1:13:03] at? Oh, I wish I could see Jesus. He's
[1:13:06] sitting right beside you.
[1:13:11] I know I've told you this before, but
[1:13:12] it's so good. You remember when we all
[1:13:14] had to wear the mask? Yeah, y'all didn't
[1:13:16] have to up here. I should have moved up
[1:13:19] here. And so I
[1:13:21] went made myself laugh. So I went to
[1:13:23] this store. I was going somewhere to
[1:13:25] preach. And I went to the store and I
[1:13:27] went in, you know, to get some gas and
[1:13:28] get a Pepsi and a a Moon Pie, you know.
[1:13:30] That's why I look the way I do, you
[1:13:32] know. When you're driving, you eat
[1:13:33] because you're bored, you know. So I
[1:13:35] stand over by the tater chip rack cuz
[1:13:38] you had to be six foot apart, you know.
[1:13:40] And so I'm standing there and this guy
[1:13:42] walks in and the girl behind the cash
[1:13:44] register, she looks, he goes, "Why,
[1:13:47] John? You've changed your
[1:13:49] mask." And apparently John had wore this
[1:13:52] mask for months, but today he put on a
[1:13:55] different mask and it so stood out to
[1:13:57] her that it caught her attention. She
[1:13:59] said, "John, you've changed your mask."
[1:14:02] When she said that, something struck me
[1:14:04] like a light in a boat. I about shouted,
[1:14:05] "Pastor Dr.
[1:14:08] peppers because you see that's exactly
[1:14:11] what he did. The God that was veiled
[1:14:14] behind the mask of Jesus, that same God
[1:14:17] has now veiled himself behind the mask
[1:14:20] of his bride. He's just changed his
[1:14:23] mask. Remember, Brother Bam talked about
[1:14:25] the play that Rebecca was in and he said
[1:14:27] he went to it and said this one guy
[1:14:29] played three or four different roles and
[1:14:31] he went behind the veil. He went behind
[1:14:33] the curtain and changed his costume, but
[1:14:36] it was the same one all the time. Not
[1:14:38] just God above us, not just God with us,
[1:14:41] but now God in us. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:14:47] Hallelujah.
[1:14:48] Oh, there will be a time come forth that
[1:14:51] he'd express himself in the fullness of
[1:14:54] his godhead, deity through his church,
[1:14:57] and have the preeminence in this church.
[1:14:59] Look, the anointed man, Christ, the
[1:15:02] anointed man, but now the anointed
[1:15:06] people.
[1:15:10] Lord, hallelujah.
[1:15:12] Oh, God. Just keep looking at it. It'll
[1:15:15] catch you one day. I'm not beside
[1:15:17] myself, friends. This is what the
[1:15:19] prophet told us. You say you're reading
[1:15:21] a lot. I want you to know this is not my
[1:15:23] thoughts. I'm only telling you what the
[1:15:24] prophet said. The anointed man. Now the
[1:15:28] anointed people to bring about the
[1:15:30] anointed bride. Hallelujah. Why? To
[1:15:33] unite with the bridegroom. What did
[1:15:36] brother Ben say in choosing of the
[1:15:37] bride? He said you want to see what a
[1:15:39] man really is? Look at what he married.
[1:15:41] Hallelujah. Then what must Christ take
[1:15:44] for his bride? He must take someone who
[1:15:46] expresses himself.
[1:15:49] Hallelujah.
[1:15:51] Anointed. Why? by accepting what Eve
[1:15:53] turned down and Adam coming back with
[1:15:56] the anointing of the word because he
[1:15:58] said my word is spirit anointed with the
[1:16:00] word. What Eve turns down he comes back
[1:16:03] and we accept it. Notice the second
[1:16:06] manifestation Christ in you the hope of
[1:16:08] glory that the great manifested God in
[1:16:10] Christ. Now Christ manifested in you.
[1:16:15] Are you ready for this?
[1:16:17] Well, one person is anyway.
[1:16:20] What was once Think about this. what was
[1:16:22] once God's great secret. God's great
[1:16:26] mysterious secret that was in his
[1:16:29] mind, but it's not there no more. No, it
[1:16:33] was once in God's mind. Angels couldn't
[1:16:36] even look. Nobody knew nothing about it
[1:16:38] because it was in God's mind. And who
[1:16:40] could go into God's mind? Moses could
[1:16:43] only go back to the beginning. He could
[1:16:46] He couldn't go into God's mind. Moses
[1:16:48] only went back and he wrote in the
[1:16:49] beginning because that was far back as
[1:16:51] he could go. No one could get into the
[1:16:53] mind of God. So this great mysterious
[1:16:56] secret that was in God's mind but it
[1:16:59] ain't there no more. Amen. Where is it
[1:17:02] at? Hallelujah. Where's the mystery
[1:17:06] at? The angels don't have it. No. The
[1:17:10] sages don't have it. Where is it at?
[1:17:13] God's great secret. God's great
[1:17:15] mysterious secret that was in his mind
[1:17:19] is now put in the hearts of the
[1:17:21] believers.
[1:17:23] Where is this secret? It's in your
[1:17:26] heart.
[1:17:29] That's the body of Christ. What was once
[1:17:31] God's great secret in his mind before
[1:17:34] the foundation of the world is now made
[1:17:36] manifest, is now made known, is now
[1:17:39] revealed where? In you. Hallelujah.
[1:17:44] Hallelujah.
[1:17:46] How could that be? How could that be?
[1:17:49] Because God promised it and he keeps his
[1:17:53] promises and he cannot fail. His
[1:17:55] promises are always true.
[1:17:59] Plus, anybody ever seen that picture of
[1:18:01] the light, the angel of the Lord, the
[1:18:02] pillar of fire? They've got it.
[1:18:04] Scientist has it. Washington has it.
[1:18:07] Right. Yeah. It is. It's there. I know
[1:18:09] these critics, you know, get on there
[1:18:10] and say that brother Brandon was lying
[1:18:12] when he said it was there. But we went
[1:18:13] to DC, me and my wife, I was preaching
[1:18:15] up there, my family, and we went into
[1:18:17] the Library of Congress, right? And we
[1:18:19] walked on the floor where the picture
[1:18:20] was. And as soon as we walked in, the
[1:18:22] lady that was running the library there
[1:18:24] told us where it was because she knew
[1:18:26] who we were because of the way my wife
[1:18:28] was dressed.
[1:18:31] Oh, God.
[1:18:33] We didn't even have to ask. She said,
[1:18:35] "Oh, you're looking for the pillar of
[1:18:36] fire. Go to this cabinet over here." I
[1:18:38] thought, "How did she know that?" Then I
[1:18:39] looked at my wife. I said, "Oh, yeah."
[1:18:43] She didn't look at me and say that. She
[1:18:45] looked at her. G. Hallelujah.
[1:18:49] Let them laugh at you, sister. Let them
[1:18:51] make fun of you. But you're serving
[1:18:52] God's purpose. Amen.
[1:18:56] We go into Walmart. So these people with
[1:18:58] 17 different color hair, and they got so
[1:19:00] much metal in their face, they can't
[1:19:02] even go out in a lightning storm. And
[1:19:04] they look at us cause because my wife
[1:19:05] has a dress and no makeup and long hair
[1:19:07] like we're weird. True. Really? We're
[1:19:10] weird. That's not weird. That's normal.
[1:19:12] I told my wife one day, I said, "I want
[1:19:14] to tell you how much I appreciate the
[1:19:15] way you dress cuz you Oh my. You look
[1:19:18] like a lady." Come on, brothers. You
[1:19:19] ought to Amen. Our sisters go through a
[1:19:21] lot. You need to tell them we appreciate
[1:19:23] it that you dress like a lady and walk
[1:19:26] like a lady and look like and you're
[1:19:27] not. Oh my. Thank God for the revelation
[1:19:31] of God's mind in this hour. True. He
[1:19:34] said that picture in Washington DC, he
[1:19:36] said they've got it in picture, but the
[1:19:38] church has got it in reality.
[1:19:41] You've got it in reality. It's here with
[1:19:43] us now. They didn't bury the pillar of
[1:19:45] fire in Jeffersonville. They buried the
[1:19:47] prophet. The pillar of fire is still
[1:19:48] with the church.
[1:19:51] It's leading us as it led Israel. It's
[1:19:53] still leading the church.
[1:19:56] There's not a wind strong enough to stop
[1:19:59] this bride. Hallelujah.
[1:20:02] It will not stop us. There's not a
[1:20:04] sickness. There's not a plague. There's
[1:20:06] not a trial that'll keep us from
[1:20:07] achieving God's great purpose for our
[1:20:10] lives. There's something in us. There's
[1:20:12] a fire that's burning. A light that's
[1:20:14] been lit by God. And no breeze can blow
[1:20:18] it out. There's no cold spell in the
[1:20:21] church. There's no indifference among
[1:20:22] the people. There's no persecution of
[1:20:24] the world that can blow out the flame
[1:20:27] that God has lit in our soul for it's
[1:20:29] God's purpose. It's his torch light of
[1:20:31] freedom and it will burn until the
[1:20:33] coming of the Lord. There's no power
[1:20:35] that can blow it out. It will only no
[1:20:37] matter how much they try to stop this
[1:20:39] message and to degrade this prophet and
[1:20:41] it will only make the word burn
[1:20:43] brighter.
[1:20:46] Cuz I been touched by a fire. Let the
[1:20:48] world come and watch me burn.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah. Amen. You see him in the
[1:20:56] promise for this day. This day. Then you
[1:20:59] hear his voice say it in his eye, be not
[1:21:01] afraid. Amen. Be not afraid. Amen. You
[1:21:06] think the heavenly father will be
[1:21:07] defeated in his purpose. Even Satan has
[1:21:09] done what he's done. It is an
[1:21:11] impossibility. Amen. He will not be
[1:21:14] defeated. And he's given us perfect
[1:21:16] assurance. We have nothing to be scared
[1:21:19] of. Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:22] Can I have just a few more minutes?
[1:21:23] Amen.
[1:21:25] Listen, my some of my my people are
[1:21:28] Melundian. You ever heard anybody ever
[1:21:29] heard the term
[1:21:31] Melenian? Melundian is a group of people
[1:21:34] down in where we're from. It's a
[1:21:35] tri-racial people. Black and Native
[1:21:38] American and white. And so that's where
[1:21:41] my people come from. I I took, you know,
[1:21:43] as I said, I genealogy and you know, I
[1:21:45] can go to any continent on earth and be
[1:21:47] at
[1:21:48] home. I'm certainly a Hines 57, you
[1:21:51] know. So that that's my people. They're
[1:21:53] Melundians. the the call it was it was
[1:21:55] kind of a derogatory term that they
[1:21:56] called us but now they you know it's
[1:21:58] kind of become popular again they wrote
[1:21:59] books the resurrection of proud people
[1:22:00] and all this but anyway they was having
[1:22:02] a melundian reunion so I didn't want to
[1:22:05] go but my brother did no I'm just
[1:22:07] kidding so we went to this reunion now I
[1:22:09] knew a guy by the name of Alfred Hall
[1:22:11] he's gone to glory now used to preach
[1:22:12] the gospel brother Hall was the darkest
[1:22:14] white man I've ever seen in my
[1:22:17] life and so me and my brother was
[1:22:19] walking over at the campus in Wise
[1:22:20] Virginia where they was having a reunion
[1:22:22] cuz Brent Kennedy had wrote a book,
[1:22:23] Resurrection of Proud People. And he was
[1:22:25] there signing the book. And so we was
[1:22:28] walking down the street and I told my
[1:22:29] brother Dwayne, I said, "If anybody is
[1:22:31] at this reunion, it'll be Alfred
[1:22:33] Hall." And when we turned the corner,
[1:22:37] here come Brother Hall down there
[1:22:38] packing that book under his arm. And he
[1:22:40] was laughing when he saw me. He said,
[1:22:42] "The man that wrote the book said, I'm
[1:22:43] one of them."
[1:22:46] And you say, "Why did you say that?"
[1:22:48] Because the things I've been preaching
[1:22:49] to you, I've come to tell you. I'm
[1:22:51] telling you this because the man that
[1:22:53] wrote the book said, "This is who we
[1:22:55] are."
[1:22:57] Hallelujah. The man that wrote the book
[1:22:59] said, "We was predestinated before the
[1:23:01] foundation of the world." The man that
[1:23:03] wrote the book said, "Your name was
[1:23:05] placed in that book of life before there
[1:23:06] was ever a star. Before there was ever
[1:23:08] an hour, your name was there with him."
[1:23:10] Amen. The man that wrote the book said,
[1:23:12] "We've already raptured." The man that
[1:23:14] wrote the book said, "I'll send you
[1:23:15] Elijah." The man that wrote the book has
[1:23:17] kept every promise of his word.
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:22] whom he predestinated he did call. Whom
[1:23:23] he called, he justified. And whom he
[1:23:25] justified, he hath glorified. Then what
[1:23:26] shall we say to these things? If God be
[1:23:28] for us, who can be against us? He that
[1:23:32] spared not his own son, but delivered
[1:23:34] him up for us all, how shall he not with
[1:23:35] him also freely give us all things? Who
[1:23:38] shall anything to the charge of God's
[1:23:40] elect? It is God that justifieth. What
[1:23:43] is he? Who is he that condemnth? It is
[1:23:45] Christ that died, yay, rather, that is
[1:23:46] risen again, who is even at the right
[1:23:48] hand of God, who also make intercession
[1:23:50] for us. Who shall separate us from the
[1:23:53] love of Christ? Shall tribulation or
[1:23:56] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:23:58] nakedness or peril or sword? As it is
[1:24:01] written, for thy sake we are killed all
[1:24:03] the day long. We are counted as sheep
[1:24:05] for the slaughter. Nay, in all these
[1:24:08] things we are more than conquerors
[1:24:11] through him that loved us. For I am
[1:24:14] persuaded that neither death, nor life,
[1:24:16] nor angels, nor principalities, nor
[1:24:18] powers, nor things present, nor things
[1:24:21] to come, nor height, nor death, nor any
[1:24:23] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:24:26] from the love of God, which is in Christ
[1:24:29] Jesus our Lord. Then what should we be?
[1:24:33] What should we be on the anniversary of
[1:24:35] this church? What should we be? Not just
[1:24:37] a building. Not just a building with all
[1:24:39] this beautiful decorations. It's not
[1:24:41] that's not what it is. No, you're the
[1:24:44] temple. You're the church. And when we
[1:24:46] go out those doors into the darkness of
[1:24:49] this age, you are that light.
[1:24:53] You see, the evening light I'm closing.
[1:24:55] The evening light is not just the name
[1:24:57] of the church.
[1:25:00] The evening light is you. Amen. Jesus
[1:25:04] said, "I am the light of the world." And
[1:25:06] then he said, "You're the light of the
[1:25:07] world." Did he have dementia? Did he
[1:25:09] forget what he said? No. He was giving
[1:25:11] you a revelation. He said, "I'm the
[1:25:13] light of the world, but you shall be.
[1:25:15] You are the light of the world." Why?
[1:25:16] Because I'll be in you.
[1:25:20] The evening light is expressed not on a
[1:25:23] church sign, but in the flesh of his
[1:25:26] church. We are the children of the
[1:25:28] promise. And being dead in Christ, we
[1:25:30] are Abraham's seed and hes with him in
[1:25:33] the promise. You see, you can't have you
[1:25:35] can't be the seed of Abraham without
[1:25:37] having the faith of Abraham. And Abraham
[1:25:39] believed for the impossible.
[1:25:41] No matter how much sickness comes, how
[1:25:42] kind of death we die, how much poverty
[1:25:44] we go through, God's purpose cannot be
[1:25:47] defeated, he will raise us up again.
[1:25:50] Because he said, because I live, shall
[1:25:52] you live also. No weapon formed against
[1:25:55] you, no weapon formed against you shall
[1:25:59] prosper.
[1:26:03] Every tongue that shall rise against
[1:26:04] thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn.
[1:26:07] This is the heritage of the servants of
[1:26:09] the Lord, and the righteousness is of
[1:26:12] me, saith the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:26:15] Hallelujah. Amen. So, as you start your
[1:26:18] 25th year of a
[1:26:20] church, send the light. Send the light
[1:26:24] by going forth and letting that light
[1:26:27] express through you. That that Walmart,
[1:26:30] that own your job, that wherever you're
[1:26:32] at, at the red light,
[1:26:34] let them see Jesus. Let them see Jesus.
[1:26:38] You know, I heard the story as I close.
[1:26:40] I think I've told it here before, but it
[1:26:41] just come to my
[1:26:43] mind. There some men who they lived in
[1:26:47] New Jersey, but they worked in New York
[1:26:49] City. And every Friday, they would catch
[1:26:52] a what we call a puddle jumper, a little
[1:26:54] plane, and they'd fly from New York back
[1:26:55] to to to New Jersey, and they would get
[1:26:58] together with their wives and have
[1:26:59] something to eat. So, it was just a
[1:27:00] routine that they done. But this
[1:27:02] particular Friday, they were late. and
[1:27:04] getting to the airport. They were late.
[1:27:06] And there's only one way to get to the
[1:27:08] gate when you're late, and that's run.
[1:27:10] So, they run trying to get to the gate
[1:27:12] because they promised their wives they'd
[1:27:13] eat supper with them. So, they come
[1:27:16] around the corner and they saw this
[1:27:17] girl, but it was too late. She was
[1:27:19] selling apples and they run all over
[1:27:21] her. Knocked the apple cart everywhere.
[1:27:23] Knocked the apples everywhere. But they
[1:27:25] went on because they was late. But when
[1:27:26] they got to the gate, this particular
[1:27:28] one kind of felt bad. He told the guys,
[1:27:31] he said, "You all go on home." Said,
[1:27:32] "I'm going to go back and check on that
[1:27:33] girl." said, "I just don't feel right
[1:27:34] that we done that to her." And they
[1:27:35] said, "You better come on. Your wife's
[1:27:37] expecting you," he said, "Tell her what
[1:27:38] happened. Tell her I catch the flight.
[1:27:39] I'll see her later tonight." And he goes
[1:27:41] back and when he goes back to where the
[1:27:43] girl was, anybody been in New York City,
[1:27:45] you know, they're not too they're not
[1:27:47] too kind up there, I hate to say, but
[1:27:48] it's the truth, you know. So, people
[1:27:50] just walking by, not paying any
[1:27:51] attention, kicking her apples and
[1:27:53] everything else. And he saw her and he
[1:27:55] noticed for the first time she was
[1:27:57] blind. And she's going, "Please, Jesus,
[1:28:00] help me. Jesus, would you help me? And
[1:28:03] he walked up and he said, "I'll help
[1:28:05] you." And he set up the chair, said,
[1:28:06] "You sat right there." And he picked up
[1:28:07] the apple cart, set it up. He picked up
[1:28:09] all the apples and everyone that was
[1:28:10] bruised, he set them off to the side.
[1:28:12] And everyone that wasn't Bruce, he wiped
[1:28:13] them off and stacked them back up. And
[1:28:15] then he pulled $20 out of his pocket.
[1:28:17] And he said, "Now look." Said, "Me and
[1:28:18] my friends, we didn't mean to do that.
[1:28:19] We're sorry. We apologize to you." He
[1:28:20] said, "But but now you're okay and
[1:28:22] you're back in business and here's $20.
[1:28:24] I put the apple bruised apple so you
[1:28:25] won't sell a bad apple. They're over
[1:28:27] here to the side and here's $20. It's
[1:28:28] more than enough to cover the apples
[1:28:30] that was bruised." and said, "We're so
[1:28:31] sorry that we done this to you and uh
[1:28:33] but you're okay." And she spoke. She
[1:28:36] said, "Sir," he said, "Yes." She said,
[1:28:39] "Are you Jesus?"
[1:28:43] And he goes, "Well, I know. Why? Why
[1:28:45] would you say that?" She said, "Because
[1:28:48] I was in the floor walk." So, I was in
[1:28:50] the floor crying and I said, "Jesus,
[1:28:52] please help me." And I heard you say,
[1:28:53] "I'll help you." I said, "I was just
[1:28:56] wondering if you were Jesus." Oh, he
[1:29:00] said, "No, but I I serve him." And all
[1:29:03] the way home on the airplane, looking
[1:29:04] out the window, he thought about those
[1:29:07] words,
[1:29:08] "Mister, are you Jesus?" Amen. And I
[1:29:12] wonder this morning as I close. Amen. Is
[1:29:16] Christ expressed through me enough that
[1:29:18] if my neighbor was blind, they couldn't
[1:29:20] see our our cloud pins? They couldn't
[1:29:22] see our Malachi 4 license plate, you
[1:29:24] know, all the things that we have as
[1:29:25] message believers.
[1:29:29] If my neighbor was blind, do I live such
[1:29:31] a life? True. That they could still see
[1:29:34] Jesus.
[1:29:36] Because you see, that's the reason he
[1:29:38] came. That he could express himself
[1:29:41] through us. Thank you, Father. That the
[1:29:43] age we're living in would not be without
[1:29:46] a witness, but that they would know that
[1:29:49] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:29:51] today, and forever. How would they know
[1:29:52] that? Not by book but by the life we
[1:29:57] live. Do I live such a life that my wife
[1:30:00] sees Jesus? Do I live such a life that
[1:30:02] my children and my grandchildren see
[1:30:04] Jesus?
[1:30:05] I don't want them to see a creed. I
[1:30:07] don't want them to see a dogma. I don't
[1:30:08] want to see him some kind of form of
[1:30:10] churchity. Right? I want them to see
[1:30:12] him.
[1:30:14] But you see my brother, my sister,
[1:30:16] that's what he has purposed in our life.
[1:30:18] And all he needs for us to do is to
[1:30:20] yield to his word. Because the man that
[1:30:22] wrote the book said, "This is who you
[1:30:25] are."
[1:30:26] The devil will try to tell you
[1:30:28] everything, but we know he's a liar.
[1:30:30] Listen to the one who wrote the book.
[1:30:32] The man that wrote the book said,
[1:30:34] "You're predestinated. An undefeable
[1:30:37] purpose, eternal purpose of the living
[1:30:39] God, that he would have a body in the
[1:30:41] last day that he could have the
[1:30:43] preeminence in that the world once more
[1:30:45] would hear from Christ."
[1:30:48] Oh God, I say this morning, let it be
[1:30:51] me, Lord. Let it be me. Is that your
[1:30:53] desire? Let's just bow our heads this
[1:30:56] morning.
[1:30:57] Amen. Oh, God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:02] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] Amen. Oh Lord, this morning
[1:31:08] God, Lord, that 90 90% of this message
[1:31:12] was quotes from your prophet so the
[1:31:15] people would know, Lord, it's not my
[1:31:17] word, but just rehearsing as as it's
[1:31:21] written in thy word that we'd be a good
[1:31:22] steward if we remind the brothers of the
[1:31:24] things that's been spoken. Father, I've
[1:31:26] tried to do that today that this was
[1:31:28] come from a vindicated prophet in this
[1:31:30] hour, Lord, who has told us this is who
[1:31:32] we are.
[1:31:34] And Lord, we know that the children of
[1:31:35] old in the bondage of Egypt 400 years
[1:31:37] they'd been beat and smacked around and
[1:31:39] treated
[1:31:41] horribly. But oh God, you sent Moses
[1:31:43] down there to tell them. You said, "Go
[1:31:46] tell
[1:31:46] Pharaoh that Israel is not your slaves.
[1:31:50] Israel is my son." Amen. And you sent a
[1:31:53] prophet to tell him who they were, Lord.
[1:31:55] And
[1:31:56] father, oh, torn clothes is all right if
[1:31:59] you're in slavery, but it was not fit to
[1:32:01] go into the presence of a king. So you
[1:32:03] gave him a new garment. You gave him a
[1:32:05] change of clothing. And oh God, that's
[1:32:07] what you've done. You clothed us in this
[1:32:09] hour, not in a creed, not in a dog, but
[1:32:11] in the revealed word of the hour
[1:32:14] because it's time for us to go into the
[1:32:17] presence of the King. But oh God, may we
[1:32:20] be ready. May there not be a person
[1:32:21] within the sound of my voice this
[1:32:23] morning miss that, Lord.
[1:32:25] But whatever it takes, God, may we lay
[1:32:27] aside every weight, every feather, every
[1:32:29] besetting sin, every weakness. May we
[1:32:31] just lay it aside, Lord, that you could
[1:32:34] have the preeminence in our lives. Grant
[1:32:36] it today, God. I pray. Lord, I believe
[1:32:39] these words will not return it to you
[1:32:40] void, but it will accomplish that which
[1:32:42] you sent to do.
[1:32:44] For the man that wrote the book said so.
[1:32:47] And I believe it, Lord. Oh, God. Grant
[1:32:50] it today. Amen. Grant it today, Father.
[1:32:54] If you're here and you say, "Brother
[1:32:55] Daryl, that's my prayer also." I wonder
[1:32:56] if you just slip your hand up and say,
[1:32:58] "Lord, remember me. That's what I
[1:33:00] desire. Lord, these things I heard
[1:33:02] today. I don't want it just to be a
[1:33:03] sermon, but Lord, I want it to be
[1:33:05] lifechanging. I want it to come into my
[1:33:07] heart and express itself." Amen. God
[1:33:09] bless the hands that are up in this
[1:33:11] building.
[1:33:13] Oh, God. Blessed are they do hunger and
[1:33:15] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:33:17] shall be filled.
[1:33:20] Oh Lord, grant it today. We pray father
[1:33:24] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:26] Hallelujah. Lord I seek
[1:33:30] you. Help me find
[1:33:33] you. How I need your
[1:33:39] touch. Find my dry and broken
[1:33:45] places. Thirsty for your love.
[1:33:49] [Music]
[1:33:51] Lord, forgive me if I've
[1:33:56] wondered. Far away from
[1:34:01] you. You are all I've ever
[1:34:07] needed. Come and make me
[1:34:10] new. Pour your spirit out on me. Fall
[1:34:15] just like the rain.
[1:34:19] saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall
[1:34:23] aresh on me. Fill my cup
[1:34:28] again. Heal my heart and make me
[1:34:33] whole. I need you now. Pour your spirit
[1:34:39] out.
[1:34:41] Oh God, grant it today, Lord. We've
[1:34:44] raised our hands to you, God. we've
[1:34:46] gathered here on this anniversary
[1:34:48] weekend, Lord, of this church. I pray,
[1:34:50] oh God, in the name of Jesus, may send
[1:34:53] the light always be a light in the
[1:34:55] darkness here in Michigan. Lord, may
[1:34:57] every person in this building be filled
[1:34:59] with the Holy Ghost, let revival fire be
[1:35:01] burning in ever so pour your spirit out
[1:35:03] upon us like the rain, dear God. Oh,
[1:35:06] Father, in this hour that we're living
[1:35:07] in when they say you don't move no more
[1:35:09] and they put it on Time magazine, is God
[1:35:11] dead? Oh, Father, I'm so glad that we're
[1:35:13] gathered here with a group of people
[1:35:15] that know you're not dead, but you're
[1:35:16] alive and well, living in the hearts of
[1:35:18] your people, expressing yourself, even
[1:35:20] said you would do. And today, oh God,
[1:35:22] forgive us of our sins. Forgive us of
[1:35:24] our shortcomings. Forgive us of our
[1:35:26] weaknesses, Lord. We bow in your great
[1:35:28] presence this morning. You see the hands
[1:35:29] that was raised, God. Lord, I don't
[1:35:31] believe they raised their head just
[1:35:32] because I asked them to do. I believe
[1:35:34] they raised their hand because they
[1:35:35] wanted more of you, Lord. And Father, we
[1:35:37] know the prophet taught us that your
[1:35:38] spirit draws near us. that will cause us
[1:35:40] to raise our hand, Lord. And oh God,
[1:35:42] receive it today, God. Receive it today,
[1:35:44] Lord. Hear our cry of our heart, Lord.
[1:35:46] Pour your anointing out upon us. Pour
[1:35:49] your spirit up on. Fulfill your purpose
[1:35:51] in our life. Even said you would do,
[1:35:53] Lord. May we go forth from this not
[1:35:55] fearing, Lord, not troubled, God, not
[1:35:56] upset, no matter what happens in the
[1:35:58] world. I'm not looking to the Democrats.
[1:36:00] I'm not looking to the Republicans to
[1:36:02] solve the problems. I'm looking to you,
[1:36:04] Lord, for you said these things with me.
[1:36:06] But when they begin to come to pass to
[1:36:08] lift up your head, your redemption
[1:36:09] draweth nigh, God, we see, Lord, how the
[1:36:12] Catholic Church now is in the
[1:36:13] Washington, Lord. It's in the the
[1:36:15] bureaucrats there. Most of Trump's
[1:36:16] cabinet is Catholic, dear God. And the
[1:36:18] new pope from America has said, Lord,
[1:36:20] that he wants to work in unity and
[1:36:22] peace. And oh, Father, they're saying
[1:36:24] now that more Catholics will come out of
[1:36:25] America because that pope come out of
[1:36:27] what is it's the fulfilling of what you
[1:36:29] said, Lord, of the beast in the image of
[1:36:31] the beast. Revelations 13. Oh, God,
[1:36:34] we're living in the hour, Lord Jesus. We
[1:36:36] don't have to wait 800 years to see a
[1:36:38] prophet's word come to pass. Oh, Father,
[1:36:40] within 70 years, what the prophet spoke
[1:36:42] has come to pass, God. We're living in
[1:36:44] this hour of the manifestation of the
[1:36:46] sons of God. Oh, Father, may we lay
[1:36:48] aside everything, Lord, to become that
[1:36:51] which you said we would be. Lord, grant
[1:36:53] it today. Father, I ask your blessings
[1:36:55] upon brother John. I ask your blessings
[1:36:57] upon his family. I ask your blessings
[1:36:59] upon his children, God. May every one of
[1:37:01] them come in, Lord. May there not be a
[1:37:03] one left behind. I ask the blessings,
[1:37:05] dear God, upon every family here. May
[1:37:07] their wives and their children and their
[1:37:08] grandchildren, oh God, today pour out
[1:37:11] your spirit upon us, Lord God. Let us go
[1:37:14] forth with the revelation of who we are
[1:37:16] in this hour that no devil, no demon, no
[1:37:19] spirit can ever stop this purpose from
[1:37:21] coming forth. It's an undefeable,
[1:37:23] eternal purpose of God. And it will be
[1:37:26] as you have said, Lord. Grant it today,
[1:37:28] God. May we just simply let go, God, and
[1:37:31] let you have your wonderful way. Grant
[1:37:34] it today, Lord. Grant it today, Lord.
[1:37:37] Pour your spirit out upon us. We pray in
[1:37:40] Jesus name. In Jesus' name, grant it
[1:37:44] today, Lord. Let the fire fall. Set us
[1:37:47] on fire, God. Grant it we pray, Lord, in
[1:37:51] Jesus name. Amen and amen.
[1:37:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But do you love
[1:37:59] him this morning,
[1:38:00] friends?
[1:38:02] Listen, one time talking about being set
[1:38:06] on
[1:38:07] fire here. A few years ago, I was
[1:38:09] burning some leaves out in the backyard.
[1:38:11] I had an old pair of jeans on that was
[1:38:14] raggedy. And I was watching it burn out
[1:38:17] there. Had my hand on a hoe handle, you
[1:38:18] know, was just watching it burn. And so
[1:38:20] I went and kicked up some leaves back up
[1:38:22] into the fire so it would burn a little
[1:38:23] bit more. And I standing there and all
[1:38:26] of a sudden I thought, "My leg feels
[1:38:28] awful
[1:38:30] warm." And I looked down. I thought,
[1:38:32] "Jimy crickets, I'm on fire." I was
[1:38:34] jumping and screaming. I was one second
[1:38:36] away from taking my britches off. But
[1:38:39] here I'm saying this, every person
[1:38:40] around me knew I was on fire.
[1:38:45] What are you saying? I pray God sets us
[1:38:47] so on fire that everybody around us
[1:38:50] knows we're on fire. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:53] Now, if I would have been burning, fire
[1:38:55] coming up my leg and I said, "Well,
[1:38:57] praise the Lord. Look at
[1:38:59] that. I'm on
[1:39:01] fire." Hallelujah. You said, "That guy's
[1:39:04] crazy. He's on fire."
[1:39:06] Oh, set me on fire, Lord. That I've got
[1:39:08] to move. That I've got to move. Oh, you
[1:39:12] love you this morning. Amen. God bless
[1:39:14] you, brother John Cub. God bless you,
[1:39:16] saints. Thank you for listening to us.
[1:39:18] Amen.
[1:39:21] Thank you, brother Daryl.
[1:39:23] Wonderful word. Yes. I just want to know
[1:39:27] who's going to leave here on fire.
[1:39:31] Praise God.
[1:39:34] Amen.
[1:39:35] We been identified today who we are.
[1:39:39] Sir,
[1:39:42] not that we're just Miss Jesus, but
[1:39:44] we're eternal Miss Jesus.
[1:39:48] And that God is going to work out
[1:39:50] everything.
[1:39:52] Not only for our good but for his
[1:39:54] purpose.
[1:39:56] We should walk away from here with such
[1:39:59] confidence
[1:40:01] that no matter what happens to us
[1:40:03] tomorrow, what trial we go through,
[1:40:05] right, the bottom falls out,
[1:40:08] the car breaks,
[1:40:11] we should be able to come back to this
[1:40:13] message that we heard today. Praise God.
[1:40:16] And know that we have some greater
[1:40:18] purpose than whatever we're going to be
[1:40:20] going through. Because I believe the
[1:40:22] word that we heard today is to help us
[1:40:24] tomorrow. It's to help us with our
[1:40:26] everyday life. Amen. It's to
[1:40:31] solidify. There's nothing that's going
[1:40:33] to stand between us and what God is
[1:40:36] calling us to do.
[1:40:38] What a wonderful word we heard today.
[1:40:40] Let's stand together and let's
[1:40:43] sing. Let's sing. I've got a revelation.
[1:40:46] Amen.
[1:40:51] I've got a
[1:40:54] revelation of
[1:40:58] predestination. I've got a
[1:41:02] revelation. God is my
[1:41:06] father. I know
[1:41:08] where I came from. Tells me
[1:41:12] where I'm going. And the gates of hell
[1:41:17] can never prevail
[1:41:20] again.
[1:41:23] Still I've got a
[1:41:27] revelation of
[1:41:31] predestination. I've got a
[1:41:33] [Applause]
[1:41:35] revelation. God is my
[1:41:39] father. I know where I came from. tells
[1:41:44] me

[1:41:56] it. I've got a
[1:42:00] revelation of
[1:42:04] predestination. I've got a
[1:42:07] revelation. God is my father.
[1:42:12] I know
[1:42:13] where I came from. Tells me
[1:42:17] where I'm going. And the gates of hell
[1:42:22] can never prevail
[1:42:25] against
[1:42:29] it.
[1:42:31] Amen. Nothing can prevail against it.
[1:42:34] Um, I will not be denied.
[1:42:42] When pains of death stun my soul unto
[1:42:48] the Lord, I
[1:42:51] cried. Till Jesus came and made me
[1:42:56] whole. I would not be denied.
[1:43:02] I would not be
[1:43:06] denied. I would not be
[1:43:11] denied till Jesus came and made me

[1:43:40] word. I would not be denied.
[1:43:46] I would not be
[1:43:50] denied till Jesus came and made me. Oh,
[1:43:56] I would not be

[1:45:47] mine. The Holy Ghost is mine. The Holy
[1:45:51] Ghost is mine. The Holy Ghost today is
