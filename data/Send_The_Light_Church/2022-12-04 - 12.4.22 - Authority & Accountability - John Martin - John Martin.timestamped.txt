[19:42] if you like to come up brother
[20:04] seems like there's some miss it
[20:07] either way I'm so happy to be here
[20:12] uh
[20:13] I had a choice of
[20:17] spending the day with my wife my my
[20:20] daughter spent all night with her
[20:23] and Mark he tried to see her last night
[20:27] and
[20:29] they would let him
[20:30] go because she was still in the
[20:33] emergency part of the hospital
[20:36] and so
[20:39] uh
[20:40] they only allowed two
[20:42] two visits all day
[20:45] in the emergency but they moved to a
[20:49] room because when they heard that Lucia
[20:52] wanted to spend the night with her
[20:55] they
[20:57] they quickly got a room
[21:00] and so
[21:02] Lucille spent the night Marx
[21:05] spending this morning I'll be spending
[21:08] all afternoon I just want to let you
[21:11] know I I had the address of the hospital
[21:16] in case somebody wanted to send her a
[21:19] card
[21:19] but I couldn't find it when I got here
[21:23] so anyway it's the U of M
[21:26] oh
[21:27] I hear
[21:30] uh
[21:31] only say my wife really has enjoyed
[21:35] coming to the church here she's felt
[21:38] welcome
[21:40] and she's enjoyed the ministry
[21:44] and uh
[21:46] so because
[21:48] when they
[21:50] when they sold the church that I
[21:53] pastored for 65 years
[21:56] ah I was very hurt
[21:59] ah
[22:02] but
[22:05] I'm not going to dwell on
[22:08] on
[22:10] tribulation or disappointments
[22:14] uh but I've been feeling like a fish
[22:19] out of the water you know how fish when
[22:23] it's out of the water and this
[22:25] well that's the way I felt because God
[22:28] sent me to Ann Arbor by Vision in 1954 I
[22:34] was praying with two young men in Tupelo
[22:38] Mississippi in a prayer room at the
[22:41] Bible school where I met my wife
[22:44] and uh
[22:46] man that was a great treasure
[22:50] and we're we're now we're now working on
[22:55] our 70th year
[22:58] amen so she's been so faithful but uh
[23:03] I I just need your prayer because this
[23:08] morning I woke up between four and five
[23:10] o'clock
[23:12] praying for Taiwan
[23:16] I don't know what that means that's one
[23:18] country I've never been to I was invited
[23:22] to Hong Kong probably 10 or 15 years ago
[23:26] and I'm so sorry now I didn't go there
[23:30] because
[23:31] it's not free now
[23:34] but my cow
[23:36] their country makes to China
[23:40] which is only two hours from Hong Kong
[23:43] there
[23:45] they're now
[23:48] allowing preachers to preach in the
[23:51] street and we have two Filipino brothers
[23:54] that are going there and preaching and I
[23:58] need you to really pray that God will
[24:01] direct them
[24:02] uh
[24:03] about 20 years ago
[24:07] I I had such a burden for Macau said I
[24:12] learned about a radio station and so
[24:15] I I sent tapes over there for three
[24:19] years
[24:20] ah
[24:22] but I didn't have anyone to put the
[24:26] tapes in this into
[24:29] Chinese language and so it wasn't a
[24:34] waste of money because we got
[24:36] we got mail that
[24:38] even some in prison received the Lord
[24:42] amen but uh uh God said his word
[24:47] wouldn't return void but I still got
[24:50] those tapes if I can get if I can get
[24:54] them translated into Chinese there'll be
[24:58] a simple message not a whole lot of
[25:01] introduction of brother Brennan but you
[25:04] know Saints
[25:06] let me just tell you
[25:08] brother branham's Ministry
[25:11] is something special
[25:14] you've heard brother John uh you know
[25:18] referring and and I appreciate brother
[25:23] Sean Martin
[25:25] we're here because this was the this was
[25:29] the one church that I felt brother John
[25:33] was so faithful when he attended was a
[25:36] deacon in the church for many years and
[25:41] and uh
[25:43] well
[25:46] anyway he would want me to say a whole
[25:49] lot but a special request for brother
[25:52] Eric Rogers
[25:55] uh
[25:56] he he came to the Lord about four years
[26:00] ago
[26:01] and uh
[26:03] receive the Lord
[26:06] but he needs the Holy Spirit and he was
[26:10] he promised me he would be at my house
[26:13] this morning
[26:15] at 9 15
[26:18] now
[26:20] 8 45 to come with Brother Bruce and I
[26:25] and that was one reason I wanted to be
[26:28] here
[26:29] to introduce you to him but
[26:32] pray for him because he's
[26:36] he needs to have a revelation of baptism
[26:41] he didn't he doesn't resent the name of
[26:45] Jesus baptism but maybe you don't
[26:48] understand the importance he that
[26:50] believeth and is baptized should be
[26:54] saved makes it pretty important
[26:57] you know but uh let's let's just pray
[27:02] that he'll come
[27:05] uh Brother Bruce not going to be able to
[27:07] drive very much longer but he has a car
[27:11] and he asked for the address this
[27:14] morning
[27:15] so I think he'll be coming here so pray
[27:20] for him he's uh ah he's a little less
[27:25] than 50 years old but he's like a young
[27:28] man he's one brother that's been a great
[27:30] a great blessing to me uh so I gotta
[27:35] hurry here because I'm looking forward
[27:37] to hear the word this morning saying
[27:39] about a hunger for the word
[27:42] Hallelujah
[27:44] so uh
[27:47] just remember
[27:50] uh brother Hart is leaving for the
[27:54] mission field within a week now
[27:58] he's going to be spending three months
[28:01] in the Philippines
[28:03] and by the heart
[28:05] came to me probably
[28:08] 35 40 years ago
[28:12] complaining because he had no more to
[28:15] preach
[28:16] he was just a young preacher
[28:19] come out of Vietnam
[28:21] and and he
[28:25] he said the brothers in this message are
[28:29] so
[28:30] studied and they can preach the word and
[28:34] quote brother Branham and so forth and
[28:37] he felt he felt unneeded I said to him
[28:42] have you considered the mission feel
[28:47] Oh my he was shocked
[28:51] but he prayed for a solid year maybe
[28:55] even longer
[28:57] call me up said I'm gonna have to go to
[28:59] the Philippines
[29:01] because I I said hey they they speak
[29:06] English there
[29:07] anyway he went through a breakdown
[29:10] because his wife well I'm not going to
[29:14] go into any details but anyway his wife
[29:18] has been dead now several years and and
[29:21] he almost had a breakdown but he's
[29:26] reconsecrated his heart and life to the
[29:29] Lord and he's he's actually sacrificing
[29:34] a lot of personal money
[29:38] that they work and send to the
[29:42] Philippines
[29:43] remember him and I want to let you know
[29:47] I guess brother John's not in yet but
[29:52] Mission money that we left here for
[29:55] brother
[29:56] Stephen Queener uh it didn't get there
[30:01] in time
[30:03] so they closed the radio broadcast that
[30:07] I've been sponsoring for quite a while
[30:10] remember brother Stephen Queener uh
[30:15] his family is just one of the most
[30:18] precious he's got five children
[30:21] but he he went as a refugee over to
[30:27] Ghana which is two countries over from
[30:30] Liberia where he lived when they were
[30:33] having Civil War and a lot of people
[30:36] fled the country because of the war was
[30:40] all over the country and I went there
[30:44] with the burden to preach and I got
[30:47] there to the airport and the Holy Spirit
[30:50] said this is not the time
[30:53] I said Lord I'm here
[30:57] this is not the time and I thought maybe
[31:00] it was because the war had come into the
[31:04] capital city because I had flown into
[31:07] the capital
[31:08] so I stayed one night
[31:11] I left
[31:13] but the Lord let me go back and so we've
[31:17] been able to minister to about five
[31:19] churches in the country but uh brother
[31:24] queena
[31:26] received the Lord over in Ghana and as
[31:30] soon as they a war that was over he come
[31:34] back to his country with his five
[31:36] children
[31:37] maybe he didn't have five right then but
[31:41] anyway he preached in the first big city
[31:47] and has some converts he baptized them
[31:51] then he didn't want to leave him so he
[31:54] stayed in that City and anyway I could
[31:58] tell you a lot of things about it but
[32:00] I'm not going to I'm just going close
[32:03] with maybe the first three verses of of
[32:07] a Hebrews this morning and I'm going to
[32:12] sit down I'd appreciate the opportunity
[32:15] to say a few words I do want to say that
[32:20] I have a promise that the brothers
[32:24] oh the ministry that took the
[32:28] congregation away from Ann Arbor they're
[32:32] about 30 miles away probably but they've
[32:36] promised to sit down with me and I just
[32:41] want to have peace with all people
[32:44] I just I just I will not allow
[32:48] bitterness to come in my heart no matter
[32:51] what people do because we're too close
[32:56] to the end time
[32:58] but my heart's bleeding
[33:01] to try to win some souls and so
[33:08] let's keep praying for brother Larry you
[33:11] know he
[33:12] got a track somehow from our church
[33:16] when he was in prison
[33:20] and uh
[33:21] he hailed that track for 40 years
[33:25] and finally decided to look up the
[33:28] church
[33:29] and I was coming right in behind him
[33:32] and I said welcome because I knew they'd
[33:36] never been there before welcome and he
[33:41] said do you know anything about guanum
[33:44] and
[33:46] I said you mean William Branham
[33:49] yeah and he pulled this truck out he
[33:52] said I've been hanging onto this track
[33:54] for 40 years
[33:56] he said
[33:58] so it was a little track
[34:01] that the Lord uh put upon brother writes
[34:07] to he was working for a printing company
[34:11] and they give him permission to print
[34:14] the tracks uh not old company time but
[34:18] if he wanted to work at night or
[34:22] Saturday or Sunday and he was living in
[34:25] Mississippi didn't have a home Church
[34:28] there but he was printing messages then
[34:31] he moved to Ann Arbor and the last he
[34:35] told me they were he counted the
[34:38] countries that we'd sent the tracks to
[34:42] and
[34:44] there was 77 countries

[43:14] helped
[43:16] Ann to figure that out and uh
[43:20] um we can have a little bit more

[43:30] um also there's an address card in the
[43:34] back for brother Iran Huskers family
[43:38] Dawns his wife if we want to send a
[43:43] sympathy card to the family
[43:47] I know they would appreciate it or she
[43:50] said her children would appreciate it so
[43:52] brother Ron was as faithful as he could
[43:56] be
[43:57] to the church
[43:59] and uh I'm looking forward to seeing him
[44:03] on the other side
[44:04] and uh I believe it would just be
[44:07] encouraging to the family the testimony
[44:10] as well
[44:12] um if you would feel in your heart to
[44:14] send them a card amen
[44:17] brother Jason Demars had
[44:20] contacted us and said that he is setting
[44:23] up some meetings in Egypt in February so
[44:28] if you could be in special prayer about
[44:30] those meetings amen
[44:32] amen amen let's stand together for the
[44:35] reading of the word we
[44:36] appreciate brother Johnson
[44:38] and let's uh be in prayer about that
[44:42] work
[44:43] um God doesn't close for brother queen
[44:46] of God does not close any doors without
[44:48] opening heaven in mind to open a new
[44:51] door and he opens a door that no man can
[44:54] close so we just trust the leadership of
[44:56] the Lord
[44:57] but we're we're it just to me we're
[45:00] fortunate to find people who are willing
[45:03] to work for the Lord
[45:05] and we just want to support and and help
[45:08] them the best that we can
[45:10] amen and if we could turn to the Book of
[45:13] Romans chapter 13 I want to say it's
[45:16] good to see everyone here this morning
[45:18] God bless you
[45:20] should have said that the very first
[45:21] thing
[45:24] but I'm so I I so often forget to read
[45:28] the announcements and things that
[45:31] so
[45:34] that's that's why amen Romans chapter 13
[45:38] we're going to read two verses here the
[45:40] first two verses and have a word of
[45:42] Prayer
[45:44] let every soul be subject unto the
[45:46] higher powers
[45:49] for there is no power but of god the
[45:51] powers that be are ordained of God
[45:54] whosoever therefore resisteth the power
[45:57] resisteth the ordinance of God in they
[46:00] that resist shall receive to themselves
[46:02] damn Nation
[46:05] amen let's just buy our hearts in a word
[46:07] of Prayer
[46:09] Heavenly Father we're bowing not on
[46:11] AirHeads but our hearts to the higher
[46:13] power this morning
[46:16] we want to thank you for your presence
[46:19] in this place that we could come and
[46:22] hear testimonies of all that you're
[46:25] doing Lord to to hear prayer requests to
[46:28] those that we need to be praying for
[46:30] and to be gathered together with those
[46:32] of light precious faith and to have the
[46:35] opportunity to worship you with one
[46:39] another Lord we thank you for this great
[46:42] privilege that you've given us
[46:44] and we thank you Lord that you've given
[46:47] us the
[46:49] this
[46:51] wonderful privilege to open the Bible
[46:54] and to read these holy words unworthy to
[46:57] look upon them Lord but you said that we
[46:59] would be blessed if we would just read
[47:01] them and we've read them today and Lord
[47:04] we're asking Lord for your blessings
[47:06] upon this word to our hearts Lord we're
[47:09] here because we want to be closer to you
[47:12] we want to be ready in that hour that
[47:14] you would call us now pray for every
[47:16] heart Lord not only here but those that
[47:19] are watching the live stream May there
[47:22] may there be just a faith special for
[47:26] them their situation drop into their
[47:28] Heart Lord
[47:29] that needs could be met father
[47:33] Lord we commit ourself and we commit
[47:36] this service we pray that Lord that you
[47:40] would reveal yourself to us this morning
[47:43] we thank you for all these things and
[47:44] give you praise in Jesus precious name
[47:47] amen amen God bless you may be seated
[47:52] amen
[47:55] the word is the highest power
[47:59] it's the spiritual supreme justice of
[48:02] everything it's our absolute it's what
[48:05] will judge God's creation in the last
[48:08] day
[48:09] even Jesus himself said in Saint John
[48:11] chapter 12 I've not come to judge the
[48:14] world
[48:15] but to save the world
[48:17] but he that rejecteth me and rejecteth
[48:20] my word have one that
[48:22] uh judgeth him the word that I've spoken
[48:25] the same shall judge him in the last day
[48:28] so the word is the highest power
[48:32] amen this message this morning is to
[48:34] really help us with our spiritual walk
[48:37] with God
[48:38] and if we struggle at times with
[48:40] authority and accountability I believe
[48:43] God wants to help us I don't don't you
[48:45] believe we all struggle with it from
[48:47] time to time
[48:48] amen I may if you're if you're you're
[48:51] honest uh I believe you agree with that
[48:54] statement
[48:55] Jesus prayed that with his disciples
[48:58] would become one with him as Jesus was
[49:01] with the father and that requires being
[49:04] under subjection to the higher powers
[49:07] brother Brandon said in this age there's
[49:08] an invisible Union taking place with a
[49:12] the Earthly bride and the spiritual
[49:14] bridegroom and it requires being under
[49:17] subjection to the higher powers to come
[49:19] into that Union
[49:22] I want this message to help stir Us in
[49:24] the right direction I like to entitle it
[49:26] Authority and accountability
[49:29] Authority and accountability
[49:32] everyone wants to see others held
[49:35] accountable
[49:37] husbands want to see their wives held
[49:40] accountable
[49:41] wives want to see their husbands held
[49:44] accountable
[49:45] parents want to see their children held
[49:47] accountable
[49:49] children want to hold their appearance
[49:51] accountable
[49:52] I mean
[49:54] everybody said well I'm not going to
[49:55] raise my children like my parents did
[49:59] employers want to hold their employees
[50:02] accountable and employees want to hold
[50:05] their employer accountable that's that's
[50:07] why we got uh
[50:09] what do they call that
[50:11] Union
[50:13] right the government wants to hold the
[50:16] people accountable pay your taxes the
[50:18] people want to hold the government
[50:20] accountable don't take advantage of us
[50:23] so everyone wants to see others held
[50:25] accountable
[50:27] but when it comes to holding ourselves
[50:28] accountable accountable our carnal
[50:31] nature wants to avoid Authority
[50:37] marriage without accountability is
[50:40] missing the important aspect of love
[50:43] think about that marriage without
[50:45] accountability is missing an important
[50:48] aspect of love
[50:52] home without accountability family
[50:54] without accountability a church without
[50:55] accountability is missing an important
[50:58] aspect of love
[51:00] we don't have to be afraid of
[51:02] accountability
[51:04] we don't
[51:07] John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[51:09] that he gave his only begotten son
[51:12] that whosoever believeth him should not
[51:14] perish but have everlasting life we
[51:15] think about God's great love
[51:19] Jesus said no greater love than this
[51:21] than a man laid on his life for his
[51:23] friends
[51:25] for God so love the world that he gave
[51:31] but there's a part of God's love that we
[51:33] don't like to think about
[51:35] and Revelation 3 19 tells us what that
[51:37] is as as many as I love I rebuke and
[51:41] chasten
[51:42] these Alias therefore and repent
[51:45] so when God rebukes us when God chastens
[51:48] us when God speaks to us about something
[51:51] he wants change it is truly God loving
[51:56] man and and we we look at too much as a
[52:00] negative thing and we need to look at it
[52:02] as a positive thing
[52:05] amen now a Believer who's walking with a
[52:07] carnal mindset has a tendency of
[52:09] thinking that all the ways that God
[52:11] would be uh towards them should be ways
[52:13] of blessing them and helping them and
[52:15] just meeting their needs and this is how
[52:17] God shows love
[52:20] it's often missing in indebtedness for
[52:22] what God has already done for them
[52:24] because when you feel that indebtedness
[52:26] you automatically want to give more back
[52:29] to God you want to obey more of the word
[52:31] you want to be a servant
[52:35] now if we fail to view God's law
[52:37] balanced
[52:39] will always be battling that we don't
[52:42] have to do anything more than what we're
[52:44] doing
[52:46] amen remember God's unconditional love
[52:48] will always be coupled with correction
[52:52] which means there's always something
[52:54] more that God wants us to do
[52:56] the reason is True Divine love never
[52:59] wants us to remain the same way we are
[53:02] character building is on God's mind for
[53:05] us
[53:06] for his bride
[53:08] and they that have the mind of Christ
[53:10] will be pressing towards that Mark
[53:12] so as many as I love I rebuke and Chase
[53:15] and be zealous therefore and repent this
[53:19] is not just for Sinners but it's for the
[53:22] church
[53:23] and I'll say it like this is especially
[53:25] for the bride
[53:27] she will receive the most correction out
[53:30] of all believers the bride will
[53:33] she will repent more
[53:36] she will be good
[53:38] at repenting
[53:41] Jesus told his own disciples after
[53:44] walking and teaching them three and a
[53:46] half years
[53:49] I have many things to say unto you
[53:52] but you can't bear it now think about
[53:55] that three and a half years after all
[53:57] the teaching
[54:00] there's a part of God's love that's hard
[54:02] to accept
[54:02] [Music]
[54:04] and it really comes against our carnal
[54:06] nature
[54:09] and if we're not careful our carnal
[54:11] nature will blind us for what true love
[54:14] is
[54:14] and then we'll always have a negative
[54:16] feeling and be negative about correction
[54:21] verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of
[54:24] Truth is come
[54:26] he will guide you into all truth
[54:30] for he will not speak of himself
[54:33] for whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[54:35] he's speaking that he will show you
[54:36] things to come he you know a lot of
[54:39] times Spirits are speaking to us and
[54:41] they're always speaking the devil is
[54:44] always trying to pump us up it's always
[54:47] trying to get us to think about us
[54:50] but when the spirit of truth comes it's
[54:52] not
[54:53] it's going to be lifting up Christ
[54:57] and it's going to be lifting uh uh it's
[55:01] going to be bringing us more under
[55:04] subjection to the word they become more
[55:06] like the word because he's going to be
[55:09] leading us into all truth but here's the
[55:12] thing we can't bear all the truth
[55:16] the wonderful thing is now
[55:18] the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy
[55:22] Ghost now you can you can take more
[55:25] you're not so bothered you're not so
[55:27] offended you're not so well what's this
[55:30] again
[55:31] the Holy Ghost is what Embraces all the
[55:36] truth it's the only thing that can take
[55:38] it amen for as many as I love I rebuke
[55:41] and Chase and be zealous therefore and
[55:43] repent
[55:45] flesh really doesn't like this part of
[55:47] God's love true we don't enjoy it we
[55:51] don't like it preached we don't want to
[55:53] talk about it we don't want to discuss
[55:55] it we don't even want to think about it
[55:58] all leading to have the tendency to
[56:01] forget
[56:02] about the Holy Ghost intimacy that he
[56:06] has with us
[56:08] think about it it takes you know a lot
[56:11] of times we're afraid to tell somebody
[56:13] something
[56:16] because
[56:18] we don't want them gone right
[56:22] all right
[56:26] and to know that the Holy Ghost has
[56:29] Liberty
[56:31] to speak to us about our things that we
[56:34] need to correct
[56:35] that to me is intimate
[56:38] because when you know you can just talk
[56:40] to anybody talk to someone about
[56:42] anything you know there is a closeness
[56:44] there
[56:46] and God if we are his bride there's
[56:50] something special that there is between
[56:52] you and God and intimacy where he can
[56:54] come and speak to you about the things
[56:57] that he needs to see corrected in your
[56:59] life
[57:02] let every soul be subject unto the
[57:06] higher powers
[57:09] for there is no power but of God and the
[57:11] powers that be our ordained of God
[57:15] naturally we're supposed to be under
[57:17] subjection to the laws of the land
[57:20] and spiritually we're supposed to be
[57:23] under subjection to the word of God
[57:25] so whosoever therefore resisteth the
[57:28] power resists the orns of God and they
[57:31] that resist shall receive to themselves
[57:34] damnation now a good example of this is
[57:37] the the children of Israel when they
[57:40] were in the wilderness
[57:42] they uh resisted
[57:45] the powers of God they resisted
[57:47] following the word and the word just
[57:50] honestly kept saying go get the Holy
[57:52] Ghost go get the Holy Ghost go get the
[57:54] Holy Ghost that is what the word was
[57:56] saying
[57:57] and it just it their hearts became hard
[58:01] and their ears became dull of hearing
[58:03] and they they wanted to do their own
[58:05] thing right but after saving the people
[58:09] that came out of Egypt the Bible says he
[58:12] destroyed them that believed not
[58:15] right and hear the scriptures saying
[58:17] they that resist shall receive to them
[58:19] self damnation so we see there is a
[58:21] there's a there's a fear there this
[58:24] should should put a fear of God inside
[58:26] of us to make sure that we don't miss
[58:28] one thing that the word is speaking to
[58:30] us
[58:32] now Authority is a good thing
[58:34] but it can also seem like a bad thing
[58:37] because a bunch of examples here
[58:39] we're glad when Authority is stopping
[58:42] some threat to burn down our school
[58:45] but we're not so happy when that same
[58:47] school sends extra homework home that
[58:49] requires our help with the children
[58:52] amen
[58:54] we're glad when Authority will pull
[58:56] someone over for a road rage but we're
[58:58] not so glad when when we're pulled over
[59:03] for speeding
[59:05] same Authority right but we're viewing
[59:08] it different
[59:09] we're glad when the government gives us
[59:11] a stimulus check
[59:13] but we're not so happy when that same
[59:15] Authority demands us to pay our taxes
[59:21] some may want to defund the the police
[59:23] for various reasons but they'll probably
[59:25] come a time that they wish they had the
[59:27] police to help them
[59:31] we're glad when the authority lets us
[59:33] off
[59:35] with just a warning for speeding anybody
[59:38] ever got that before
[59:40] but we're not so happy when that same
[59:42] Authority holds us accountable to obey
[59:45] the law
[59:47] we're glad when the authority of Jesus
[59:49] gives us unmerited Grace for our sins
[59:52] his mercies are new each day
[59:54] but we're not so glad when that same
[59:56] Authority demands us to keep his
[59:58] Commandments
[1:00:05] see you're the the very the very uh
[1:00:10] result of your amens proves what I'm
[1:00:12] saying
[1:00:13] [Laughter]
[1:00:20] we want the authority of God's word to
[1:00:22] Deliver Us From The Devils that torment
[1:00:24] our lives
[1:00:25] but we're not very interested in coming
[1:00:27] in subjection to the authority of that
[1:00:29] same word when it speaks to us what we
[1:00:31] need to be doing
[1:00:35] some people want God to bless them with
[1:00:37] a lot of money but they struggle with
[1:00:40] giving that money back to God
[1:00:44] some people want God to supply their
[1:00:46] needs but they struggle with putting God
[1:00:48] first in their lives and helping others
[1:00:52] right we could say Authority
[1:00:54] is a two-edged sword
[1:00:56] sometimes it's in favor of our flesh and
[1:00:59] sometimes it's not in favor of our flesh
[1:01:08] but God's Authority is actually sharper
[1:01:11] than any two-edged sword
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:15] most people do not enjoy authority over
[1:01:18] them it's understandable
[1:01:22] but some refuse Authority they hate it
[1:01:26] they just can't handle someone over them
[1:01:28] telling them what to do
[1:01:31] you'll find them being critical or
[1:01:33] finding fault or looking for some reason
[1:01:35] not to be subject
[1:01:38] Lucifer was the first one to hate
[1:01:39] Authority he was the first one to use
[1:01:42] his influence against Authority
[1:01:46] to undermine Authority
[1:01:48] his selfish goal was to undermine and
[1:01:51] disrupt true Authority
[1:01:54] in order to get others to follow him
[1:01:56] instead of following God's order
[1:01:59] the fact is we cannot be in order with
[1:02:01] god without being under Authority
[1:02:05] remember that statement God always has
[1:02:08] an order in his kingdom and it won't
[1:02:09] change
[1:02:11] brother Brandon said that if
[1:02:15] if you are a prophet on this side you're
[1:02:16] going to be a prophet on that side
[1:02:21] every parent wants their children to
[1:02:23] obey
[1:02:26] in order for things to be right there
[1:02:28] has to be Authority and accountability
[1:02:31] one without the other will not be
[1:02:33] successful
[1:02:35] it'll bring confusion
[1:02:38] well Dad Mom said it was okay for me to
[1:02:40] do it
[1:02:42] well I'm telling you it's not okay
[1:02:44] understand confusion
[1:02:51] God's word is the same yesterday today
[1:02:54] and forever
[1:02:55] there should be no confusion with God's
[1:02:58] word if you're finding confusion with
[1:03:00] God's word get back on your knees get in
[1:03:03] his presence go back and read it go back
[1:03:05] and listen to it
[1:03:08] God is not the author of confusion
[1:03:12] children are commanded to obey their
[1:03:14] parents
[1:03:16] that their days would be extended
[1:03:20] and children need to learn to obey
[1:03:24] regardless if they agree or not agree
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:30] in other words God loves to see respect
[1:03:33] yes regardless if the parent is right or
[1:03:36] wrong
[1:03:38] wives are commanded to obey their
[1:03:40] husbands in all things
[1:03:42] even when they are wrong
[1:03:46] God loves to see respect amen he loves
[1:03:50] to see order in the homes
[1:03:54] and God will correct the husband
[1:03:59] he will correct the husband
[1:04:02] mothers are commend to love their
[1:04:04] children properly
[1:04:08] to love their father
[1:04:11] to love their children's father to be a
[1:04:14] keeper of the home
[1:04:16] mothers play an important part
[1:04:19] all these are requiring
[1:04:22] Authority and accountability
[1:04:26] husbands are committed to love their
[1:04:27] wives
[1:04:28] to the same degree that Christ loved the
[1:04:31] church
[1:04:32] and gave himself for it
[1:04:35] to dwell with them in wisdom and to meet
[1:04:38] their every need
[1:04:40] praise God Amen amen fathers are command
[1:04:43] to love their children not to provoke
[1:04:45] them to anger
[1:04:47] in a church it's no different
[1:04:50] the Holy Ghost is our head
[1:04:53] the word is our Spiritual Authority
[1:04:57] brother Brandon preached Church order
[1:04:58] and that is was to stop
[1:05:01] the confusion that was in the church
[1:05:03] that's what it was for foreign
[1:05:06] and he told us that we just go back to
[1:05:08] that he said there wouldn't be a new one
[1:05:10] in 2020.
[1:05:12] right right no
[1:05:15] God is the same yesterday to him forever
[1:05:19] God has given the church the office of a
[1:05:22] pastor
[1:05:24] brother Brandon said is that that office
[1:05:26] will lead you through
[1:05:30] now God uses this office more than we
[1:05:33] realize to speak to us many things
[1:05:38] but we limit God when we limit the
[1:05:43] office
[1:05:46] I'll tell you write that down
[1:05:48] you that struggle
[1:05:50] you limit God when you limit the office
[1:05:56] when God uses this office
[1:06:03] God ought to be respected
[1:06:08] with accountability
[1:06:11] to what he is speaking
[1:06:13] because it's a Spiritual Authority it's
[1:06:17] not the man
[1:06:20] you got to get your eyes off the man
[1:06:23] because that's the hiccup
[1:06:28] and I don't say any one of us here got
[1:06:30] these problems but look for instance if
[1:06:32] you can't respect your pastor if you
[1:06:34] don't like your pastor if you don't
[1:06:36] agree with your pastor it's going to be
[1:06:38] extremely difficult for you to be under
[1:06:40] subjection to the Spiritual Authority
[1:06:43] that that office holds amen amen that's
[1:06:47] why you're hindering yourself because
[1:06:49] you're being carnal with what's being
[1:06:52] preached
[1:06:55] as much as we might find fault or
[1:06:57] disagreement or dissatisfaction God has
[1:07:00] an office where he speaks to us
[1:07:02] and you can't be little well I'm just
[1:07:04] going to get it off the tapes you know
[1:07:06] when you with that attitude you know
[1:07:08] when you listen to those tapes you're
[1:07:10] just cherry picking what you want to
[1:07:12] hear
[1:07:13] because if you weren't when you're
[1:07:15] listening to those tapes I'll tell you
[1:07:17] take you to your knees and repent and be
[1:07:19] zealous to say God help me fill me with
[1:07:22] your spirit today
[1:07:25] preach
[1:07:30] I always believe that if a person
[1:07:31] believes that God has led them to the
[1:07:33] wrong pastor
[1:07:35] then they really need to pray until they
[1:07:37] find the leadership to get to the right
[1:07:39] one because that man is ordained to lead
[1:07:41] you through
[1:07:46] God wants us in order under a Spiritual
[1:07:49] Authority not under a man
[1:07:52] but under the holy ghosts operating
[1:07:54] through the different offices amen
[1:07:59] now what is your pastor's responsibility
[1:08:04] now I want you to be honest with me and
[1:08:06] I just want to grab your attention and
[1:08:09] is it to help help us with all of our
[1:08:12] natural needs
[1:08:15] is it to fix all of our natural problems
[1:08:19] is it to supply all that we naturally
[1:08:21] are lacking
[1:08:24] no
[1:08:27] but do we look at our pastor
[1:08:33] that way
[1:08:35] have we looked at our pastor have we
[1:08:37] gone to our pastor for the natural
[1:08:41] right be that the shows were staring at
[1:08:45] that office in a natural way
[1:08:51] and this is I just want to be down to
[1:08:52] earth and and connect with us
[1:08:56] very seldom to somebody come to me and
[1:08:59] say
[1:08:59] I have a spiritual need with My Soul
[1:09:05] all right but what is the pastor for
[1:09:09] what what's he for
[1:09:13] a pastor's office is a spiritual office
[1:09:16] it holds a Spiritual Authority for
[1:09:19] Spiritual needs
[1:09:22] sometimes that office brings consolation
[1:09:24] and comfort
[1:09:28] as we're being fed or one-on-one and
[1:09:32] sometimes that office will hold us
[1:09:34] accountable to the word
[1:09:36] correct
[1:09:37] God uses this office for the ministry of
[1:09:41] our souls
[1:09:43] that is why we're here
[1:09:45] we're here for our souls
[1:09:48] but we don't focus on that much
[1:09:51] we come to church because we're supposed
[1:09:53] to come to church we don't come to
[1:09:54] church to feel like our soul needs
[1:09:56] anything my soul got saved like you know
[1:09:58] five years ago 20 years ago what do I
[1:10:00] need I don't need help with myself it's
[1:10:02] saved but I'm telling you the nature
[1:10:05] needs to change it got started but the
[1:10:08] nature needs to become like Christ and
[1:10:10] that's why we're here
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:13] find out where we're at
[1:10:19] yes we're saved but we're not ready yet
[1:10:22] we're still in the process of
[1:10:24] manifesting all of his nature amen and
[1:10:26] if we limit this office to meeting only
[1:10:28] our natural needs
[1:10:31] our wants things that we prefer then
[1:10:34] we're actually limiting God when he's
[1:10:36] trying to speak to your soul
[1:10:42] it's why many believers they never get
[1:10:44] further established in Christ
[1:10:47] because they're not
[1:10:49] focusing on what the ministry is for
[1:10:54] and if you if you don't focus on that
[1:10:57] you're going to have that tendency not
[1:10:58] to be held accountable to the word
[1:11:00] that's why this is where we're going
[1:11:02] with this now
[1:11:04] you've got to believe the word is trying
[1:11:07] to hold us accountable
[1:11:10] if the if the word says pray without
[1:11:13] ceasing that our hearts need to be
[1:11:15] pricked Lord I'm going to put more
[1:11:17] effort in praying
[1:11:19] if if if I need to to have a burden one
[1:11:23] for another if I I need to lay down my
[1:11:25] life I need to go help someone uh
[1:11:27] brother Johnson stand up here and saying
[1:11:29] I I I I I got a burden on my heart I
[1:11:32] need to do this he's just obeying the
[1:11:35] Holy Spirit
[1:11:37] and this is what God wants to operate
[1:11:40] through our lives and we we get so
[1:11:42] natural that we're missing God dealing
[1:11:45] with our souls
[1:11:48] do you know uh
[1:11:51] in my position
[1:11:53] God deals with me with every one of
[1:11:56] these messages that you hear
[1:11:59] before you get them he's dealing with me
[1:12:04] I'm not up here saying you got needs
[1:12:08] that I do not
[1:12:09] no I'm up here saying I have these knees
[1:12:12] this is what God has for us
[1:12:19] but we don't want to be in a place where
[1:12:21] we dislike being under Spiritual
[1:12:24] Authority
[1:12:25] don't like hearing certain things
[1:12:29] you like disagree what's being done or
[1:12:31] who's doing it
[1:12:34] if we're going to mature and grow our
[1:12:37] character
[1:12:38] we're going to have to Humble ourselves
[1:12:40] and come under subjection to Spiritual
[1:12:42] Authority
[1:12:45] now God has put in charge of our souls
[1:12:52] someone is in charge of our souls to
[1:12:56] feed our soul to direct her soul into
[1:12:57] the nature of Christ to correct our
[1:13:00] souls
[1:13:02] when it's getting out of order
[1:13:05] right and I want you to look at your
[1:13:06] soul as your nature
[1:13:09] how you act
[1:13:11] when you get
[1:13:13] out of
[1:13:16] when you get wild
[1:13:18] when you want to do your own thing
[1:13:21] that's the thing that God is trying to
[1:13:25] get under subjection and he will use the
[1:13:28] holy spirit will use the office
[1:13:33] to bring us to give us the word and
[1:13:36] bring us back to where we need to be to
[1:13:38] get us back in order to direct us into
[1:13:40] all truth
[1:13:43] habakkuk habakyak two forces behold his
[1:13:47] soul
[1:13:48] which is lifted up
[1:13:51] is not right in him but the just shall
[1:13:53] live by faith
[1:13:55] so the soul that gets lifted up and says
[1:13:57] well I don't need to do that
[1:14:00] that's just you know brother soul and
[1:14:02] soul that's just his opinion
[1:14:05] well
[1:14:07] right there
[1:14:09] the soul is not right
[1:14:12] it it it it gets lifted up
[1:14:16] our souls come from God
[1:14:18] they belong to God
[1:14:21] Ezekiel 18 forces behold All Souls are
[1:14:24] mine I've read this before as the soul
[1:14:26] of the father so the soul the son is
[1:14:28] mine the soul that sinneth it shall die
[1:14:32] now our souls have a chance to sin every
[1:14:37] day in fact brother Brandon says we
[1:14:38] backslide every day
[1:14:40] so this is not about your loss and you
[1:14:44] need to get saved again we're not
[1:14:45] talking like that
[1:14:47] what we're talking about is where have
[1:14:50] we been this last week I'm subjecting
[1:14:53] myself to the word so the Holy Ghost can
[1:14:56] speak to me and get me more in order so
[1:15:00] we need to fine-tune what's happening in
[1:15:03] our souls
[1:15:06] Romans 13 1 again let every soul be
[1:15:09] subject unto the higher powers for there
[1:15:10] is no power but of God and the powers
[1:15:12] that be ordained of God whosoever
[1:15:14] therefore resisteth the power resist the
[1:15:16] the ordinance of God and they that
[1:15:19] resist
[1:15:20] shall receive to themselves
[1:15:24] trouble
[1:15:28] you don't want to resist the word no
[1:15:30] matter how much you think everything's
[1:15:33] okay
[1:15:35] true
[1:15:41] according to the scriptures here when
[1:15:42] you're not being subjects it's not
[1:15:44] you're not being subject to Brother John
[1:15:46] you're not being subject to God
[1:15:51] because
[1:15:52] the Bible says for there is no power but
[1:15:55] of God but the powers that be are
[1:15:56] ordained of God Amen
[1:16:00] amen so when you're resisting you're
[1:16:01] really not resisting Brother John
[1:16:04] you're resisting God I want you to know
[1:16:06] that I want to sink in
[1:16:09] because our our our conscience
[1:16:13] can become
[1:16:15] so hardened
[1:16:17] right right if we're struggling with
[1:16:19] coming under subjection to the higher
[1:16:21] Powers we just simply need to pray more
[1:16:24] just just humble yourself pray pray
[1:16:26] helps bring a balance in your life
[1:16:29] if we claim to have the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:31] not lining up with the word that when
[1:16:33] God gives it then we need to pray more
[1:16:35] for more holy ghosts
[1:16:38] we need to fight for the Promised Land
[1:16:41] not just I don't need it
[1:16:45] if that spirit that raised up Christ
[1:16:48] from the dead dwells in you it'll
[1:16:50] Quicken your mortal body in other words
[1:16:52] it will bring your body into subjection
[1:16:55] to the word
[1:16:57] right amen so if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:17:01] the word should be there
[1:17:03] the love for the word the love to to to
[1:17:06] reach out to others to to help the body
[1:17:09] to grow
[1:17:11] and if the Holy Ghost is missing
[1:17:14] well then we're back doing the things
[1:17:16] that we want to do
[1:17:19] so let every soul be subject unto the
[1:17:22] higher powers
[1:17:24] for there is no power but of God
[1:17:28] the powers that be are ordained of God
[1:17:33] who so therefore resisteth that power
[1:17:35] he's resistant the ordinance of God and
[1:17:38] they that resist shall receive to
[1:17:40] themselves damnation for rulers verse 3
[1:17:43] for rulers are not a terror to Good
[1:17:46] Works
[1:17:47] but to evil
[1:17:50] in other words if you're coming to
[1:17:52] church
[1:17:54] you're here in time you're you're
[1:17:55] preparing you're entering into his gates
[1:17:58] with Thanksgiving
[1:18:00] you're you're doing all that you all the
[1:18:03] good works that you know that you can
[1:18:06] well there's nothing to be afraid about
[1:18:08] when you come in and you hear the word
[1:18:09] of God
[1:18:13] it's only when you're not following the
[1:18:15] word
[1:18:19] will thou then not be afraid of that
[1:18:23] power
[1:18:24] do that which is good
[1:18:26] and thou shalt Praise of the same
[1:18:31] for he is the Minister of God to thee
[1:18:34] for good
[1:18:36] but if thou do that which is
[1:18:39] your own
[1:18:41] be afraid
[1:18:43] for he beareth not the sword in vain
[1:18:47] for he is the Minister of God a Revenger
[1:18:50] to execute Wrath
[1:18:53] upon him
[1:18:54] that doeth evil
[1:18:57] my
[1:18:59] I don't think you can preach that verse
[1:19:02] in a lot of churches right
[1:19:04] together
[1:19:08] but God is interested in a bride without
[1:19:11] spot a wrinkle
[1:19:13] he's focusing on a bride that's just
[1:19:16] perfect
[1:19:17] and he has many things to say unto that
[1:19:19] bride just like he did his disciples
[1:19:22] and we have to be able to take that word
[1:19:25] receive it be accountable to it begin to
[1:19:29] walk in the light of it and then come to
[1:19:31] the next service and look for more
[1:19:33] because like his brother Johnson said
[1:19:36] there's not much time left
[1:19:39] and if we're interested in a Rapture I'm
[1:19:42] telling you don't wait
[1:19:44] there's not time to wait
[1:19:49] wherefore ye must needs be subject
[1:19:55] ye must needs be subject not when you
[1:19:59] want to not when you agree not when you
[1:20:01] think not when you feel not when it's
[1:20:04] convenient not when it lifts you up
[1:20:07] not when it helps your reputation
[1:20:10] ye must these be subject
[1:20:14] not only for Wrath but also for
[1:20:17] conscience sake
[1:20:21] you don't want
[1:20:22] God to be
[1:20:26] bothered with you
[1:20:30] but also you want to be walking out of
[1:20:32] church with a clear conscience
[1:20:35] I've done your bidding Lord I've done
[1:20:38] what you've asked me to do I want to I
[1:20:41] want to leave here and I want to put
[1:20:42] these things into practice and I want to
[1:20:44] come back and I want to Rejoice because
[1:20:46] I followed through with what I said last
[1:20:47] service
[1:20:50] now the key is learning to be subject to
[1:20:54] the word this is it's real simple the
[1:20:55] key is learning to be subject to the
[1:20:57] word
[1:20:58] the Bible says the fear of the Lord is
[1:21:00] the beginning
[1:21:01] of wisdom
[1:21:03] Proverbs 15 5 says a food despiseth his
[1:21:07] father's instructions
[1:21:10] we don't want to despise our father's
[1:21:12] instructions and don't let the devil
[1:21:13] tell you that's just brother John
[1:21:16] right Proverbs 13 13 whosoever despises
[1:21:20] the word
[1:21:21] shall be destroyed
[1:21:24] but he that feareth the Commandment
[1:21:26] shall be rewarded amen praise God it's
[1:21:29] an either or there's no Switzerland here
[1:21:32] Proverbs 3 11 my son despise not the
[1:21:36] chasing of the Lord
[1:21:38] neither be weary of his correction
[1:21:47] don't despise it
[1:21:51] let God love you
[1:21:54] in this very intimate way that most
[1:21:56] people cannot receive
[1:21:59] most people can receive
[1:22:01] Calvary
[1:22:03] John 3 16 but they can't receive the
[1:22:06] intimacy remember when Jesus says I have
[1:22:08] many things to speak unto you but you
[1:22:10] can't bear it now that was in his most
[1:22:12] intimate hour in his with his disciples
[1:22:13] going into the upper room he was there
[1:22:16] having an intimate communication with
[1:22:18] him spoke things that just before he
[1:22:21] left that there were the most important
[1:22:23] things that had to do with his
[1:22:24] relationship and he was reminded them to
[1:22:26] stay in the vine stay connected be one
[1:22:29] keep it going
[1:22:31] amen
[1:22:33] no there's a lot of things are going to
[1:22:35] be coming
[1:22:36] right now you can't handle it
[1:22:38] he says but they're still coming
[1:22:41] they're still going to come
[1:22:43] the word is still going to come and if
[1:22:45] it don't come from me God will send
[1:22:47] somebody by here to make sure it comes
[1:22:50] because the the bride has got to receive
[1:22:53] the word that she needs
[1:22:55] a five-fold Ministry we'll get this
[1:22:58] bride ready
[1:23:05] verse 6 for this cause
[1:23:07] Peggy tributes
[1:23:09] also
[1:23:11] for they are God's ministers attending
[1:23:13] continually upon this very thing
[1:23:16] now if you're wondering
[1:23:18] what I'm doing with my extra time
[1:23:21] you know we all got extra time
[1:23:24] just ask my wife what I do with my extra
[1:23:26] time
[1:23:29] God's ministers attending continually
[1:23:32] upon this very what very thing
[1:23:36] the souls
[1:23:40] the souls that need
[1:23:42] shin
[1:23:43] that need
[1:23:45] to reflect the character of Christ
[1:23:50] we can know all the Mysteries
[1:23:52] we could have all the faith
[1:23:54] we can give our bodies but what we need
[1:23:56] is divine love which is the nature of
[1:23:59] God
[1:24:04] we're not only supposed to be subject
[1:24:07] but we're supposed to actually honor
[1:24:11] and to be thankful for God's ministers
[1:24:13] can you say Amen
[1:24:15] render therefore all their dues
[1:24:20] wow
[1:24:22] I didn't think I owed anything
[1:24:26] see
[1:24:29] that's how people look at Christ I don't
[1:24:31] owe them anything he did it all it's not
[1:24:33] by works
[1:24:36] tribute to whom tribute do is due
[1:24:38] accustomed to him custom
[1:24:40] honor to honor
[1:24:43] I mean just in every possible way oh no
[1:24:47] man anything but to love one another for
[1:24:50] he that loveth another have fulfilled
[1:24:52] the law
[1:24:53] God doesn't want us owing anything
[1:25:03] I think a lot of people do owe
[1:25:07] I really do
[1:25:09] yes I'm thankful for the amens there
[1:25:12] the thing is I feel a lot of people oh
[1:25:14] God
[1:25:17] not a Payback
[1:25:19] not you can't pay anything back for
[1:25:22] Calvary
[1:25:23] but you can give them the only thing you
[1:25:25] have to give which is your life
[1:25:28] and he that giveth his life the Jesus
[1:25:32] said I shall save it
[1:25:35] and he that keepeth it from South shall
[1:25:38] lose it
[1:25:40] Hebrews 13 16.
[1:25:44] but to do good
[1:25:46] and to communicate
[1:25:48] forget not
[1:25:51] for what such sacrifice is God Is Well
[1:25:53] pleased
[1:25:54] I'd rather get in trouble for saying
[1:25:57] thank you to someone too much than to
[1:26:00] even come close to the borderline of
[1:26:02] missing it
[1:26:08] yeah
[1:26:09] you know people might think that
[1:26:12] it's not real if you say it too much
[1:26:16] but you know your heart
[1:26:19] and your life will follow what what how
[1:26:22] real it is it really will
[1:26:26] all right verse 17 obey them that have
[1:26:29] the rule over you
[1:26:31] and what's the word submit yourselves
[1:26:36] for they watch
[1:26:38] for your what
[1:26:50] foreign
[1:26:58] watch for your souls
[1:27:04] when
[1:27:06] you're talking
[1:27:09] or when I'm talking to you no matter
[1:27:12] what we're talking about there is a good
[1:27:15] chance I'm staring at something
[1:27:16] different
[1:27:20] I'm peeking at something different
[1:27:23] I'm interested in something that's
[1:27:25] different
[1:27:29] I love Fellowship
[1:27:32] but I have a responsibility
[1:27:35] I have a responsibility and it the
[1:27:38] responsibility was not given by you
[1:27:41] and God didn't ask you if it's okay for
[1:27:44] me to be here
[1:27:46] it's between
[1:27:48] God
[1:27:50] and look you you parents
[1:27:54] your children don't understand all the
[1:27:56] time while you tell them what they need
[1:27:58] to do
[1:28:00] but they need to be subject to you you
[1:28:02] know that
[1:28:04] and it's hard because sometimes they
[1:28:05] don't want to
[1:28:07] right now when they're young it's okay
[1:28:09] because you can spank them all the way
[1:28:10] to to doing it
[1:28:12] but after they get older you need to win
[1:28:14] them
[1:28:16] there's no longer spankings they don't
[1:28:18] work
[1:28:19] and it becomes harder
[1:28:22] but we're adults here
[1:28:27] the more you love God the more you'll
[1:28:29] come subject to the word
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:34] for they watch for your souls
[1:28:38] as they that must give an account
[1:28:44] they have to actually give an account to
[1:28:46] God for all the dealings
[1:28:49] that they may do it with joy
[1:28:52] and not with grief
[1:28:55] for this is unprofitable
[1:28:57] for you
[1:28:58] so
[1:29:00] you know
[1:29:01] it's like a love triangle
[1:29:05] I mean
[1:29:07] I got a responsibility to God
[1:29:09] to give you the word
[1:29:13] you have a responsibility to follow that
[1:29:16] word because that's your relationship
[1:29:18] with God
[1:29:19] you see how that goes
[1:29:22] God said he'll do nothing except he
[1:29:25] first revealth his Secrets unto the
[1:29:26] prophets
[1:29:28] so God will always use a prophet to
[1:29:31] bring the word
[1:29:34] and then that five the rest of that
[1:29:36] FireFold Ministry who takes that word
[1:29:37] breaks it down and and gives it to the
[1:29:40] people
[1:29:50] do you feel okay
[1:29:54] don't let the tension be too
[1:29:56] strong in here
[1:30:02] there's a number of scriptures that
[1:30:04] we're going to have to escape because of
[1:30:07] of time
[1:30:09] but I want to talk about a couple things
[1:30:11] if I could
[1:30:13] and Jude talks about those that despise
[1:30:16] Dominion
[1:30:18] and he said well unto them for they have
[1:30:20] gone the way of Cain
[1:30:24] now Cain was a man that actually had a
[1:30:27] meeting with authority
[1:30:29] Authority came to him and told him what
[1:30:32] to do if thou do as well won't thou be
[1:30:35] accepted
[1:30:36] and if you don't well send lieth at the
[1:30:39] door
[1:30:40] right damnation to them that don't
[1:30:42] follow
[1:30:45] but Cain rejected accountability
[1:30:49] this is the danger he was okay he felt
[1:30:52] okay to sit in church and listen to the
[1:30:54] preaching
[1:30:56] he was willing to do that but he wasn't
[1:30:59] willing to be accountable just like Cain
[1:31:01] said listen to the preaching of God
[1:31:06] we don't want to reject Authority
[1:31:11] part of Cain's way was being a murderer
[1:31:14] just like his father
[1:31:17] brother Branham taught us to try to hurt
[1:31:19] somebody's influence is the Same Spirit
[1:31:22] it's the way of Cain
[1:31:26] Romans 2.
[1:31:28] verse eight look what happens in the
[1:31:30] spiritual realm here Romans 2 8 but unto
[1:31:33] them that our contentious Cain was
[1:31:36] contentious
[1:31:38] and do not obey the truth
[1:31:41] but obeying righteousness indignation
[1:31:43] and wrath tribulation and anguish upon
[1:31:47] every soul of man that doeth evil
[1:31:51] of the Jew first and then the Gent and
[1:31:53] also the Gentile
[1:31:54] but glory honor and peace to every man
[1:31:57] that worketh good to the Jew first and
[1:32:00] also to the Gentiles for there's no
[1:32:01] respect of persons with God
[1:32:04] I love
[1:32:07] brother Johnson said I want to be at
[1:32:09] peace with all men
[1:32:13] because this is what the Life of Christ
[1:32:16] is all about
[1:32:19] I don't I don't really care about her
[1:32:21] past I don't care what's transpired what
[1:32:23] I care about is what's happening from
[1:32:25] here moving forward
[1:32:26] because that's what God is interested in
[1:32:35] the beautiful thing about being under
[1:32:36] God's Spiritual Authority is that you
[1:32:39] get the benefits
[1:32:42] too many people want to use the word for
[1:32:45] their own benefits
[1:32:50] man you'll come to me in that day and
[1:32:52] say Lord Lord did not this they used for
[1:32:55] their own benefit but they didn't even
[1:32:57] want to follow the word right now the
[1:33:01] first benefit I want to mention is the
[1:33:03] unveiling of gods John 14 21.
[1:33:07] this is a great benefit for being under
[1:33:09] subjection to the word John 14 see too
[1:33:12] much this is what happens I think in the
[1:33:14] majority of churches
[1:33:16] the people
[1:33:18] give out what they want to give out and
[1:33:21] they're not focusing on helping the
[1:33:23] people have a relationship with God
[1:33:27] and this is the most important thing
[1:33:31] he that have my Commandments and keepeth
[1:33:34] them
[1:33:35] he it is that loveth me right
[1:33:37] and he that loveth me shall be loved to
[1:33:39] my father and I will love him and what
[1:33:41] will manifest myself to him well I'll
[1:33:45] tell you this just kicks out the
[1:33:47] knowledge right out listen all the tapes
[1:33:49] read all you want it ain't about
[1:33:52] knowledge friends it's about God said
[1:33:54] I'll build my church upon the unveiling
[1:33:57] of himself from the father
[1:34:02] it's got to be real
[1:34:04] Judah saith unto him not a scary Lord
[1:34:07] how is it that thou will manifest
[1:34:09] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[1:34:10] and Jesus answered and said unto him if
[1:34:13] a man loved me he will keep my words
[1:34:17] and my father will love him and we will
[1:34:20] come unto him and make our abode
[1:34:26] there's too many people are focusing on
[1:34:27] I got the Holy Ghost I've got the Holy
[1:34:29] Ghost they should be focusing in I want
[1:34:32] to obey more of the word I want more of
[1:34:34] the word I want to live more of the word
[1:34:35] because automatically Christ will
[1:34:39] manifest himself in you
[1:34:41] look at this benefit here in John 15 7.
[1:34:44] if he abide in me and my words abide in
[1:34:48] you ye shall ask what you will and it
[1:34:50] shall be done unto you
[1:34:52] when you allow the authority of the word
[1:34:55] to come inside your life
[1:34:58] when you come under subjection to the
[1:35:00] word you are receiving Authority
[1:35:08] not by just listening to it
[1:35:10] it's the doers that are Justified not
[1:35:12] just the hearers
[1:35:14] when we obey the word we are becoming
[1:35:16] one with the word we're becoming one
[1:35:19] with a Spiritual Authority
[1:35:23] I believe the Bible says let the word of
[1:35:25] God dwell in you richly dwell there
[1:35:28] there are benefits
[1:35:30] for letting Authority for coming under
[1:35:33] subjection to Authority
[1:35:35] he's able to make all grace abound to us
[1:35:38] the Bible says he's able to do
[1:35:40] exceedingly above all that we would ask
[1:35:42] or think if we would just seek first the
[1:35:46] kingdom not our own
[1:35:48] not our own things
[1:35:52] for not getting what you want
[1:35:54] look for ways to obey God's word more
[1:35:57] because he is able to make the grace
[1:36:00] that you're looking for abound in your
[1:36:02] life
[1:36:05] we don't have time but I want you to
[1:36:08] read it uh it's Matthew chapter 8 verses
[1:36:11] 15 through 13. this is the story of the
[1:36:14] Centurion and he had a revelation of
[1:36:16] Spiritual Authority
[1:36:20] he said I am a man under Authority
[1:36:27] amen and what did he say right after
[1:36:28] that I go tell a man this and he doeth I
[1:36:31] tell a man that and he do it I say come
[1:36:34] and he cometh but his first word was I
[1:36:37] am a man under Authority
[1:36:39] now I'm a man that gives
[1:36:42] that that
[1:36:43] tells people what to do right
[1:36:47] he was saying I understand Authority I
[1:36:49] understand how it works when you're
[1:36:51] subject to the one above you you do what
[1:36:54] he says and that if you're over someone
[1:36:56] you tell them what to do and they do it
[1:37:00] and now God I know that you're you are
[1:37:02] in control of all the spirits all the
[1:37:06] spiritual Realm
[1:37:08] and if you just speak the word
[1:37:11] my servant will be healed
[1:37:14] that's the beauty of being under
[1:37:17] subjection to Authority you don't have
[1:37:19] to be afraid of the word
[1:37:23] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:37:25] shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:37:28] that is that is not natural death that's
[1:37:30] spiritual death
[1:37:32] right that's why the first verse says
[1:37:34] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:37:38] amen he is leading us to do his will
[1:37:46] amen we don't want to pick and choose
[1:37:50] just want to give it all to Jesus
[1:37:54] God has given us spiritual authority
[1:37:56] over the devil
[1:37:57] I think we let him push us around too
[1:38:00] much
[1:38:03] tries to put us in a box of
[1:38:06] of hopelessness flooding our our minds
[1:38:09] with just negativity
[1:38:12] tormenting us with doubts and fears
[1:38:16] but God has given a spiritual authority
[1:38:18] over the devil
[1:38:20] to hold him accountable to the same word
[1:38:24] that we're accountable to yeah
[1:38:26] yeah think about that
[1:38:28] don't try to use the word when you're
[1:38:30] not accountable to it
[1:38:32] Jesus I know Paula no but who are you
[1:38:36] right but when you're under subjection
[1:38:38] to it you are you are a man under
[1:38:41] Authority you can say to the devil get
[1:38:45] thee behind me Satan
[1:38:52] in other words you have the authority to
[1:38:55] cast down imaginations
[1:38:58] and every High thing that exalteth
[1:39:00] itself against the knowledge of God
[1:39:03] and bringing into captivity every
[1:39:05] thought to The Obedience of Christ see
[1:39:09] that and look at verse 6 and having a
[1:39:12] readiness
[1:39:13] to Revenge all Disobedience when your
[1:39:16] obedience is fulfilled
[1:39:20] so see how it's connected
[1:39:23] Authority and accountability
[1:39:28] this word has given us spiritual
[1:39:30] authority over the devil Mark 16 verse
[1:39:33] 17 and these signs shall follow them
[1:39:35] that believe in my name shall they cast
[1:39:37] out devils they shall speak with new
[1:39:40] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:39:42] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:39:44] not hurt them
[1:39:45] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:39:48] they shall recover
[1:39:50] we just need to have faith like that
[1:39:52] Centurion
[1:39:57] you've got to believe the word
[1:40:00] Christ is our example
[1:40:03] and I'm going to be ending with this
[1:40:04] okay
[1:40:05] Christ is our example he took upon him
[1:40:09] the form of a servant amen the Bible
[1:40:11] says he humbled himself and became
[1:40:13] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:40:15] the cross
[1:40:17] were for God
[1:40:20] also highly exalted him and given him a
[1:40:23] name which is above every name
[1:40:25] that the name of Jesus every knee shall
[1:40:27] bow and every of things in heaven and
