[33:04] those needs
[33:06] and we pray that faith would reach out
[33:09] and touch the hem of your garment today

[33:38] amen amen second peter chapter one
[33:42] starting with verse number three
[33:43] according as his divine power have given
[33:46] unto us all things that pertain into
[33:48] life and godliness
[33:50] through the knowledge of him that have
[33:51] called us to glory and virtue
[33:55] hereby are given to us great
[33:58] exceedingly great and precious promises
[34:01] that's right
[34:01] that by these you might be partakers of
[34:04] the divine nature having escaped the
[34:06] corruption that is in the world through
[34:08] lust
[34:09] now let's just look at the divine nature
[34:14] right here and besides this giving all
[34:17] diligence
[34:17] add to your faith virtue virtue
[34:20] knowledge knowledge temperance
[34:21] temperance patience
[34:23] patience godliness and godliness
[34:24] brotherly kindness
[34:27] and to brother kindness charity
[34:30] amen this is the divine nature of god
[34:33] for if these things be in you
[34:35] and abound they make you that you shall
[34:37] neither be barren or unfruitful in the
[34:39] knowledge
[34:40] of our lord jesus christ amen god bless
[34:42] you may be seated
[34:52] eve was beguiled by the serpent
[34:57] and as eve beguiled
[35:02] as eve was beguiled to take or partake
[35:05] of the tree of knowledge god
[35:09] wants us to partake of the tree of life
[35:12] today
[35:14] amen and we've been invited
[35:18] through these scriptures here in
[35:21] in peter we want to entitle this message
[35:24] partake
[35:25] with me now at that time that
[35:29] adam and eve partook of that tree they
[35:31] would have done anything
[35:33] they could to get back and partake of
[35:35] the tree of life
[35:37] but they couldn't flaming swords went up
[35:39] to protect it
[35:41] that's right amen and now today men have
[35:44] a chance
[35:45] to partake of the tree of life and they
[35:47] don't want nothing to do with it
[35:50] but jesus said whosoever will let him
[35:52] come and drink of the waters of life
[35:54] freely we have
[35:55] a chance to partake of the tree of life
[35:59] god invites us for a subject we want to
[36:03] talk about standing
[36:04] on the promises of god amen
[36:07] he's given us exceedingly great and
[36:09] precious
[36:10] promises and that by these promises we
[36:13] might be
[36:14] a partaker of god a partaker of the
[36:17] divine
[36:17] nature a partaker of the tree of life
[36:21] one thing is sure that god keeps his
[36:24] word
[36:26] he keeps his promises and god has made
[36:30] it possible for us to partake of those
[36:32] our human nature cannot we cannot keep
[36:36] our word completely
[36:40] right not completely every man's a liar
[36:43] we just get little thoughts and we won't
[36:45] share exact motives and we try to hide
[36:48] things and
[36:49] that's the nature of humanity but god
[36:51] keeps his word amen
[36:54] i want to just lay a little foundation
[36:56] as we get
[36:57] into this further that with abraham and
[37:00] god made abraham a promise in genesis
[37:03] chapter 12
[37:05] when he was 75 years old
[37:09] and in verse 1 now the lord had said to
[37:11] abram get thee
[37:12] out of thy country and from thy kindred
[37:15] and from thy father's house
[37:16] onto a land that i will show thee now
[37:18] notice this is a very good type
[37:20] of the believer we have to separate
[37:24] when we come to god and i will make thee
[37:27] notice
[37:28] a great nation
[37:31] and i will bless thee and make thee a
[37:32] great name and thou shalt be a blessing
[37:34] and i will bless them that bless thee
[37:36] and curse them that curse thee
[37:37] and in thee shall the families of the
[37:39] earth be blessed the original promise
[37:42] that god made
[37:43] was i will make thee a great nation amen
[37:48] not nations but a great nation
[37:53] and abram separated from his family but
[37:56] he took a lot with him
[37:58] and after a number of years god had to
[38:00] separate from him as well
[38:04] genesis chapter 13 verse 14. i'm going
[38:06] to go through a lot of scriptures today
[38:08] i want to encourage you
[38:09] don't get too involved with writing them
[38:11] all down you can
[38:12] but there's just a lot i want you to
[38:14] catch i want you to catch
[38:19] and abram said and the lord said to
[38:21] abram after the
[38:22] lot had separated from him lift up now
[38:25] thine eyes and take and look from the
[38:28] place where thou art northward south or
[38:30] eastward westward
[38:31] for all the land which thou see us to
[38:32] thee i will give it and to thy
[38:35] seed singular right forever
[38:39] and i will make thy seed singular as the
[38:41] dust of the earth so
[38:43] uh that if a man can number the dust of
[38:45] the earth
[38:46] then shall this thy seed also be
[38:49] numbered
[38:50] so about 14 or 15 years after lot had
[38:53] pitched his tent
[38:54] towards the worldly things the world had
[38:56] consumed him
[38:58] it took a while but he pitched his tent
[39:00] towards worldly things
[39:02] now during these many years as abraham
[39:05] was becoming more holy
[39:06] and more perfect la soul was being vexed
[39:10] daily that's what the bible tells us he
[39:13] was
[39:14] being oppressed wore down plagued
[39:17] tormented troubled provoked that's what
[39:19] that word means
[39:20] seeing and hearing the filthy
[39:23] communications
[39:25] of the world right pay attention to what
[39:27] you're
[39:28] looking at when you pick up that phone
[39:30] because it will vet you it will bring
[39:32] you down
[39:34] you know what eventually happened he was
[39:37] eventually
[39:38] taken captive right i'll say stay away
[39:42] from the world
[39:44] but what did abram do when he heard that
[39:46] his nephew
[39:47] was captured he went after him amen
[39:50] he had a burden he loved him and he put
[39:53] his
[39:54] own life in rest getting him
[39:57] and in genesis chapter 14 verse 16 and
[40:00] he brought
[40:01] and he brought back all the goods and
[40:03] also
[40:04] brought again his not his nephew
[40:07] his brother think about that
[40:11] his brother amen
[40:15] what a what a burden and his goods and
[40:18] the women also on the people
[40:20] he restored his brother lot
[40:23] right amen god was so pleased
[40:26] with abram's labor of love that that he
[40:29] actually met him on the way back
[40:32] in the form of melchizedek paid tithes
[40:35] he was pleased with him
[40:37] i'll say god god is pleased when you
[40:39] labor
[40:40] for the lord amen amen
[40:43] abraham was still without a natural seed
[40:48] but i believe he had the spiritual seed
[40:52] if we could understand the difference
[40:54] here the seed of faith
[40:56] and this the natural seed we can see why
[40:59] things happen the way they did more in
[41:01] the bible
[41:04] and it's hard to become a great nation
[41:06] without having a son to continue
[41:08] to multiply in genesis chapter 15 verse
[41:11] 3 abraham said
[41:13] behold to me
[41:16] thou has given me no seed that was given
[41:20] no seed and lo the one that born in my
[41:21] house is not my heir
[41:23] and the word of the lord came unto him
[41:25] saying this shall not be
[41:27] thine air but he that shall come forth
[41:30] out of thy own bowels
[41:31] shall be thy heir it's just
[41:34] if i could read verses five and six if
[41:37] you could just go to the next verse
[41:38] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[41:42] look now to the heaven and tell me of
[41:43] the stars that thou can be numbered
[41:45] and he said unto him so shall thy
[41:48] seed singular be
[41:52] and he believed in the lord and it was
[41:54] come to him to righteousness
[41:57] so he had the seed of faith he did
[42:00] believe
[42:01] amen in the in the promise that god gave
[42:04] him
[42:04] amen just didn't understand how it was
[42:06] going to come
[42:10] amen next they had hagar
[42:14] now that eventually brought a lot of
[42:16] trouble in the house
[42:18] she got kicked out and while hagar
[42:21] was alone struggling in genesis chapter
[42:25] 16 verse 10 the angel of the lord said
[42:27] unto her
[42:28] i will multiply thy seed exceedingly
[42:32] the same thing he told abraham
[42:36] that it shall be numbered that shall not
[42:38] be numbered
[42:39] for multitude now this is a different
[42:43] seed
[42:44] it's not the same seed
[42:49] and the angel of the lord said unto her
[42:52] in verse 11
[42:53] behold thou art with child
[42:56] and shall bear a son and shall call his
[42:58] name ishmael
[43:00] because the lord have heard thy
[43:02] affliction
[43:03] and he shall be a wild man look at the
[43:07] type of this seed
[43:15] is a wild man
[43:18] and every man hand against him
[43:22] and he shall dwell in the presence of
[43:24] his brethren
[43:28] it's it's a different seed
[43:32] amen
[43:36] i will multiply thy seed exceedingly
[43:40] abraham was 86 years old when his son
[43:44] ishmael was born 86
[43:48] and abraham and ishmael they bonded
[43:51] together
[43:51] for about 13 years and god appeared unto
[43:54] abram again in genesis chapter 17
[43:57] verse 1 and when abram was 99
[44:00] the lord appeared unto abram and said
[44:03] unto him i
[44:04] am the almighty god walk be walk before
[44:07] me
[44:08] and be thou perfect this
[44:11] is 24 years after he left
[44:15] separated and god's still telling him to
[44:17] be perfect
[44:19] i say don't you ever entertain a spirit
[44:22] that that that says you don't have to
[44:25] press in to be perfect
[44:26] don't listen to that thing amen
[44:29] verse two and i will make my covenant
[44:31] between me
[44:32] and thee and will multiply thy seed
[44:35] exceedingly
[44:41] speaking of sarah now in verse 16 and i
[44:44] will bless her and give
[44:46] thee a son also of her yea and i will
[44:49] bless her
[44:50] and she shall be a mother nations king
[44:52] of the people
[44:53] shall be of her and abraham fell on his
[44:56] face and laughed and said in his heart
[44:58] shall a child be born unto unto him
[45:01] that is a hundred years old and sarah
[45:03] that is 90
[45:04] years old there
[45:08] and abraham said unto god oh that
[45:10] ishmael
[45:11] might live before thee
[45:16] now it shows this statement really shows
[45:19] where abraham was
[45:20] was at he believed in the promise
[45:24] that he was going to have a son he
[45:25] believed that god was going to give him
[45:27] a son
[45:28] he believed what god had told he just
[45:30] didn't understand how it was going to
[45:31] happen
[45:33] it's a lot of times we we we believe the
[45:35] message we're
[45:36] we we believe this is the nh we we
[45:39] believe that we're going to be
[45:40] we just don't know how this stuff's
[45:42] going to happen
[45:44] but we believe it
[45:50] verse 19 and god said sarah thy wife
[45:53] shall bear thee a son indeed and thou
[45:55] shalt call his name
[45:56] isaac and i will establish my covenant
[45:59] with him
[46:00] for an everlasting covenant and with his
[46:03] seed
[46:04] after him nothing to do with ishmael
[46:07] gonna multiply that seed
[46:12] gonna bless her naturally but the
[46:15] covenant is established with this seed
[46:19] now god is speaking of the seed of faith
[46:23] that's what this seed is not
[46:26] a natural seed because ishmael
[46:30] was the natural seed
[46:33] esau was the natural seed
[46:37] even though same mom and dad it was
[46:39] still natural seed
[46:41] god is referring to the seed of faith
[46:43] that's in you
[46:46] and that seed is christ in ephesians
[46:49] chapter 3 verse 17
[46:50] says that christ may dwell in your
[46:52] hearts by
[46:54] faith that seed of god is in there by
[46:57] faith
[46:59] verse 20 and as for ishmael
[47:02] i have heard thee though and i blessed
[47:04] him
[47:06] and will make him fruitful and we'll
[47:08] multiply him exceedingly
[47:10] 12 inches shall be begot and i will make
[47:13] him a great nation so here it is of
[47:16] course
[47:16] that nation became other nations and
[47:19] many nations eventually but you notice
[47:24] the covenant is with not ishmael and his
[47:26] seed
[47:27] it's not in the natural it's by the seed
[47:30] of faith amen
[47:32] abraham went 25 years without a clear or
[47:35] complete understanding
[47:37] of how this promise was going to come to
[47:38] press
[47:40] but abraham he kept believing he kept
[47:42] obeying
[47:43] he kept pressing towards perfection
[47:46] until
[47:47] a complete surrender and that happened
[47:49] when he was ready
[47:50] to kill isaac and the lord stayed his
[47:54] hand
[47:56] but then he received his promised son
[47:59] in which abraham became not only the
[48:01] father of many nations through ishmael
[48:04] but became the father of our faith
[48:08] which is a holy nation amen
[48:13] that's the nation we're interested in
[48:15] first peter chapter 2 verse 9 says
[48:17] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[48:20] priesthood
[48:21] a holy nation amen
[48:24] i percue your people that you should
[48:26] show forth the praises of him
[48:28] that have called you out of darkness
[48:30] into his marvelous
[48:31] just as god called abraham out god is
[48:34] calling us
[48:35] out amen amen to be a holy nation
[48:39] what makes us a holy nation we believe
[48:43] god's promised word amen
[48:46] that's what separates us from the
[48:48] natural believer
[48:52] first ten which in times past
[48:55] were not a people but are now the people
[48:58] of god
[48:58] which have not which had not attained
[49:01] mercy
[49:02] but now have obtained mercy
[49:06] all through faith isn't that beautiful
[49:10] as abraham was predestined to bring
[49:12] forth his
[49:13] seed through isaac so have we been
[49:16] predestined
[49:17] to bring forth the same seed amen which
[49:21] is jesus christ
[49:23] the same seed amen spiritual seed
[49:26] amen abraham had two
[49:30] seeds one was sown through the flesh
[49:33] to his efforts
[49:36] without any help of god
[49:40] and it brought forth ishmael
[49:43] the other was sold through faith in god
[49:45] and it brought forth isaac
[49:49] and brother bran made it real clear in
[49:51] this message
[49:53] that when you mix yourself with the word
[49:56] it becomes a hybrid and it cannot bring
[49:58] forth the son of god
[50:00] amen we must believe the word for what
[50:04] it is
[50:06] galatians chapter 3 verse 16 now to
[50:08] abraham and to his seed
[50:11] was the promise made he saith not
[50:14] intercedes
[50:16] as of many but as of one
[50:19] and to thy seed which is
[50:24] christ
[50:28] god only made the covenant through the
[50:30] seed that was sown in faith
[50:32] amen he did not make the covenant that
[50:35] was sold
[50:36] to the flesh now god still blessed the
[50:40] natural seed of abraham
[50:42] that was sown in the efforts of fish and
[50:43] that was ishmael
[50:46] inside of eve they're laid as we know
[50:50] two seeds one of god that was able
[50:54] and one of the devil and that was cain
[50:57] one was sowed in the flesh her own will
[51:01] to bring forth the lust of the flesh now
[51:03] catch this
[51:04] the other was sold by faith it was the
[51:07] will of god
[51:08] to bring forth salvation because if
[51:11] if hey if adam would not have gone in
[51:15] to eve and had that relationship
[51:18] eve would have been annihilated
[51:23] it was inside of adam the seed of god
[51:28] to bring restoration to make a way of
[51:31] redemption for his wife
[51:33] amen just as as christ made a way for
[51:36] us to redeem us at calvary it was inside
[51:40] of him
[51:40] and there was no way that the angels or
[51:43] anybody could see the expression of the
[51:45] attributes
[51:46] of salvation unless man fell
[51:53] isn't that beautiful two seats
[51:57] a seat of faith
[52:05] genesis chapter 3 verse 15 and i will
[52:07] put enmity
[52:08] between thee and the woman
[52:12] and between thy seed and mercy now they
[52:16] both lied in there
[52:17] notice her seed her seed
[52:22] it was the seed of god
[52:26] it shall bruise thy head and thou shall
[52:28] bruise his heel
[52:32] i am sorry but something's going on
[52:41] inside of god
[52:45] is everything he does is by faith
[52:48] everything amen we're so used to
[52:52] everything
[52:52] happened with understanding
[52:56] with your building block you start at
[52:58] the bottom you build your way up and
[53:00] here it is
[53:01] we cannot see beyond understanding
[53:05] but faith don't need to see anything
[53:09] it just needs to believe it amen
[53:12] and that seed of faith is so important
[53:16] that it lies within us to believe the
[53:18] word of god for what it says
[53:21] because it's by the promises of god that
[53:24] we obtain
[53:25] the nature of god amen
[53:28] i just want to go through romans chapter
[53:30] 4 quickly
[53:32] very quickly
[53:47] what shall we say then that abraham our
[53:50] father
[53:50] as pertaining to the flesh have found
[53:53] for if abraham would have been justified
[53:55] by works he aware of to glory but not
[53:58] before god
[54:00] what saith he the scriptures would saith
[54:02] the scriptures
[54:03] abraham believed god it was accounted
[54:05] him for righteousness
[54:07] for to him that worketh is the reward
[54:09] not reckon
[54:10] of grace but of debt but to him that
[54:12] worketh not but believeth
[54:14] on him that justifieth god the right the
[54:16] faith is counted for righteousness so we
[54:19] must
[54:20] believe even as david also described the
[54:23] blessedness of the man
[54:25] who god imputeth
[54:28] righteousness without work saying
[54:29] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[54:32] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[54:33] blessed is the man whom the lord will
[54:36] not impute sin
[54:38] cometh this blessedness then upon the
[54:41] circumcision only or upon the
[54:43] uncircumcision also for we
[54:45] say that faith was reckoned to abraham
[54:48] for righteousness
[54:50] how was it then reckon when he was
[54:53] in circumcision or in uncircumcision
[54:56] so it's not to the circumcision but to
[54:59] the uncircumcision notice
[55:02] it he he was circumcised afterwards
[55:06] and he received the sign of circumcision
[55:09] a seal of righteousness of faith which
[55:12] he had yet
[55:13] being uncircumcised that he might be the
[55:15] father of all them
[55:17] that believe that's you and i
[55:21] though they be not circumcised that the
[55:24] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[55:26] also
[55:26] and the father circumcision to them who
[55:29] are not of the circumcision only but
[55:31] who all this is us but who also walk
[55:34] in the steps of that faith
[55:38] of our father abraham which he had being
[55:41] yet uncircumcised are we walking
[55:44] in the steps of that faith we don't need
[55:47] to understand how god's going to do
[55:48] things
[55:49] we just need to believe it we need to
[55:52] believe that
[55:53] it does not yet appear but we know that
[55:55] one day we're going to be just like him
[55:57] amen we don't know how but we believe it
[56:00] we believe it because we're walking in
[56:02] the steps of
[56:03] that faith amen for the promise that
[56:07] he should be the heir of the world was
[56:09] not to abraham or to him
[56:11] to a seed to the law but to the
[56:13] righteousness of
[56:15] faith for if they which are of the law
[56:18] the heirs faith is made void and the
[56:20] promise made of none of that because
[56:22] the law worketh wrath but where no law
[56:25] is there is no transgression therefore
[56:27] it is a faith that it might be of grace
[56:29] to the end the promise might be sure to
[56:31] all the
[56:32] the seed seed
[56:36] one seed seed of faith not to that only
[56:39] which is of the law
[56:40] but to that which is of the faith of
[56:42] abraham who is the father of us all now
[56:45] don't get mixed up
[56:46] when i say seed of faith it is the seed
[56:49] of christ
[56:49] but it is one and the same it is one and
[56:53] the same
[56:55] i mean you can divide it but don't
[56:57] divide it
[57:02] and then you'll understand more
[57:06] as it is written i have made thee a
[57:08] father of many nations
[57:10] before him whom he believed even god who
[57:13] quickeneth the dead
[57:14] and calleth those things which be not as
[57:17] though they were
[57:18] who against hope believed in hope that
[57:19] he might become the father of many
[57:21] nations according
[57:22] to that which was spoken so shall thy
[57:26] seed be and being that weak
[57:29] in faith he considered not his own body
[57:31] now being dead
[57:33] when he was about a hundred years old
[57:35] neither the deadness
[57:37] of sarah's womb
[57:41] now look a lot of times the lord will
[57:43] speak something to us
[57:44] we read in the bible where there was a
[57:49] a question there was
[57:52] how is this going to be and it takes
[57:55] time
[57:57] for that seed sometimes to to get
[57:59] planted
[58:04] brother branham said when he saw that
[58:06] vision of that bride and he saw the
[58:07] bride
[58:08] get out of step he yelled out get back
[58:10] in line does that mean she wasn't bright
[58:12] doesn't mean she wasn't filled with the
[58:13] holy ghost it doesn't mean that she
[58:15] wasn't
[58:16] um predestined to become conforming to
[58:19] his image what it meant is that there's
[58:20] times that there's a staggering that
[58:22] takes place
[58:28] he staggered not at the promise of
[58:31] god through unbelief but was strong in
[58:36] faith giving glory to god
[58:38] and being fully persuaded that he that
[58:40] had promised
[58:42] what he had promised he was able to
[58:45] perform
[58:47] amen now i know this hum
[58:50] we've all been promised things did you
[58:54] know
[58:54] everybody in the world is promised
[59:00] us something good by doing their own
[59:04] will
[59:06] is that the truth everybody
[59:10] in other words the devil makes promises
[59:13] right god makes promises
[59:21] and the bible tells us that the devil
[59:22] sits on the throne
[59:25] acting like he's god oh i'm going to
[59:28] give you this
[59:28] i'm going to give you that
[59:33] and sometimes we don't know which is
[59:35] which
[59:38] and i just say it like this there's a
[59:40] reason that we've been taught
[59:44] god interprets his word by bringing it
[59:46] to pass
[59:47] amen there's a reason for that there's a
[59:50] reason we've been taught
[59:52] the same with dreams what is
[59:54] interpretation
[59:55] we will know when it comes to past why
[59:58] do we need to know it before
[1:00:00] because we can still exercise faith
[1:00:03] trust i believe in you lord thy will be
[1:00:07] done
[1:00:07] amen i'm sorry
[1:00:10] i am not spiritual enough i am not even
[1:00:13] close to being spiritual enough to
[1:00:15] discern
[1:00:16] every single thing that goes on inside
[1:00:18] my brain
[1:00:22] and nobody is that's why we say if it's
[1:00:25] the lord's will
[1:00:27] we shall go here we shall go there we
[1:00:28] shall do this we should do that
[1:00:31] we make plans like we know we don't know
[1:00:35] i'm not saying sometimes we don't
[1:00:36] sometimes we do amen
[1:00:41] a lot of times we don't that's true
[1:00:46] i'm just saying here we've got to trust
[1:00:48] god
[1:00:50] amen so all the times that i thought
[1:00:53] that we thought how many has ever
[1:00:56] thought something
[1:00:58] was from god and found out that it
[1:00:59] wasn't
[1:01:01] i mean it's i say countless
[1:01:08] countless
[1:01:10] it's just the devil trying to get us off
[1:01:12] track amen
[1:01:13] the one thing god remains faithful he's
[1:01:16] true he's never lied
[1:01:18] amen he will bring us through
[1:01:24] and being fully persuaded what he has
[1:01:28] promised
[1:01:28] he was able also to perform
[1:01:34] now the devil can't perform it
[1:01:38] but god can and therefore was imputed
[1:01:43] unto him for righteousness
[1:01:44] and now it was not written for his sake
[1:01:48] alone
[1:01:49] that it was imputed to him but for us
[1:01:52] but for us also to whom it shall be
[1:01:54] imputed
[1:01:55] if we believe on him that raised up
[1:01:58] jesus our lord from the dead
[1:01:59] who was delivered for our offenses and
[1:02:02] was raised again
[1:02:04] for our justification isn't that
[1:02:07] beautiful
[1:02:08] romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if the
[1:02:10] spirit of him that raised up jesus from
[1:02:12] the dead dwell in you
[1:02:14] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:02:16] shall also quicken
[1:02:17] your mortal bodies by the spirit that
[1:02:20] lives inside of you
[1:02:21] and it lives by faith by faith not by
[1:02:25] works
[1:02:28] therefore brethren we're debtors not to
[1:02:30] the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:02:33] for if we live after the flesh you shall
[1:02:35] die but if you through the spirit do
[1:02:36] mortified the deeds of the body
[1:02:38] you shall live for as many as are led by
[1:02:40] the spirit of god they are the sons of
[1:02:42] god
[1:02:42] this spirit will never ever lead you to
[1:02:46] live after the flesh amen that's right
[1:02:48] amen it will always lead you to mortify
[1:02:52] the deeds of the body
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:56] why so god can have free course amen
[1:02:59] he wants he wants to have his way in her
[1:03:01] life he just wants a vessel that he can
[1:03:04] use
[1:03:05] abraham let's turn to romans chapter 8
[1:03:08] verse 29
[1:03:10] abraham kept believing
[1:03:13] he kept surrendering he kept obeying he
[1:03:17] kept mortifying the deeds of his flesh
[1:03:19] he kept pressing towards the promise
[1:03:21] that god gave him
[1:03:22] and one thing we do know that god has
[1:03:25] promised us
[1:03:25] is right here he promised us that we
[1:03:27] should we'll be like him
[1:03:29] amen that's really all that really that
[1:03:33] really matters when it's all when it's
[1:03:34] all said and done
[1:03:36] nothing else is going to matter
[1:03:42] we can hold to that promise
[1:03:46] romans chapter 8 verse 29 for whom he
[1:03:49] did for
[1:03:50] know he also did predestinate to be
[1:03:52] conformed to the image
[1:03:53] of his son that we might be the
[1:03:55] firstborn among
[1:03:56] many brethren we're going to have the
[1:04:00] same nature as christ
[1:04:04] romans chapter 8 verse 22 for we know
[1:04:07] that the whole creation
[1:04:09] groaneth and travaileth in pain
[1:04:12] until now why what's happening and not
[1:04:15] only they but ourselves
[1:04:17] also inside of us we're groaning
[1:04:20] which have the first fruits of the
[1:04:22] spirit even
[1:04:24] uh even we all also ourselves groan
[1:04:28] within ourselves waiting
[1:04:29] for the adoption to with the redemption
[1:04:32] of our body
[1:04:33] we're waiting for completion to happen
[1:04:36] amen
[1:04:36] there's a there's a deep calling there's
[1:04:38] got to be a deep to respond
[1:04:42] and so this is the climax of what
[1:04:45] what heaven's waiting on what the whole
[1:04:47] creation is waiting for
[1:04:49] it ain't waiting to see who's going to
[1:04:51] be the next president or if they're
[1:04:52] going to take us into socialism
[1:04:54] or what the world is going to be
[1:04:56] happening
[1:04:59] i mean do we really want to hear the
[1:05:01] news of what was happening in sodom and
[1:05:03] gomorrah
[1:05:05] when the two angels went down there do
[1:05:08] we really want to know
[1:05:09] the ins and outs of what was happening
[1:05:12] does it really matter
[1:05:15] let's just escape amen let's just escape
[1:05:20] praise the lord
[1:05:23] verse 18 for i reckon that the
[1:05:26] sufferings of this present time
[1:05:28] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:05:30] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:05:33] amen for the earnest expectation of the
[1:05:36] creation creature
[1:05:37] waiteth for the manifestation of us
[1:05:43] they're waiting for a manifestation of
[1:05:46] us
[1:05:47] that's where our focus should be
[1:05:49] manifesting christ
[1:05:51] amen while the world is going insane
[1:05:53] trying to figure out what's happening
[1:05:56] is this the end trying to make has your
[1:05:58] tails out of things
[1:05:59] the bride is focusing on manifesting
[1:06:02] christ it's the only way she'll be ready
[1:06:05] it's the only way she makes herself
[1:06:08] ready
[1:06:09] while the creation is waiting for this
[1:06:11] to happen there's an invisible union
[1:06:13] taking place between the bride and the
[1:06:15] bridegroom amen
[1:06:17] so let's not waste any more time let's
[1:06:19] start partaking
[1:06:20] of the promises of god that we can have
[1:06:22] as divine nature
[1:06:24] amen according this is divine power i've
[1:06:27] given to us
[1:06:28] all things that pertaineth unto life and
[1:06:30] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:06:31] that
[1:06:32] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[1:06:34] are given unto
[1:06:35] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:06:39] that by these promises we might be
[1:06:41] partakers of the divine
[1:06:44] nature of god
[1:06:47] our avenue to becoming more like jesus
[1:06:51] is through the promises of god amen it's
[1:06:54] through them
[1:06:55] that we become more like god we can't do
[1:06:57] it on our own
[1:06:59] amanda's very best is all vanity we need
[1:07:02] something greater and that's god's
[1:07:03] promises
[1:07:05] it's no different for our healing the
[1:07:06] avenue uh to healing
[1:07:08] is through the promises of god that's
[1:07:11] right god's word
[1:07:12] says that uh by his stripes we're healed
[1:07:15] it's a promise
[1:07:16] it's through that promise that we obtain
[1:07:18] healing yes
[1:07:19] amen we have to personally believe
[1:07:22] god's promise for our healing we know
[1:07:24] the word is true
[1:07:26] we know the debt was paid we know one
[1:07:28] person can be healed by believing it and
[1:07:31] another person not by not believing it
[1:07:34] amen we have to believe the word of god
[1:07:37] personally
[1:07:38] amen so our avenue to become more like
[1:07:42] jesus is through the promises of god
[1:07:44] as well number one god
[1:07:47] has given to us promises and he keeps
[1:07:50] his promises
[1:07:53] we've all failed to keep our word but
[1:07:55] god has never failed
[1:07:56] one time god cannot lie right amen
[1:08:00] heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:08:02] god's word will never pass away
[1:08:04] it will never fail god keeps his
[1:08:09] number two god's promises are not
[1:08:12] christmas gifts
[1:08:15] there are gifts that are attained they
[1:08:17] are gifts
[1:08:18] but they're only obtained through faith
[1:08:22] without faith we can't reach them
[1:08:27] we need faith to better cash in on the
[1:08:29] promises of god
[1:08:31] don't you think about the children of
[1:08:33] israel they were delivered
[1:08:34] out of the egyptian world but they never
[1:08:37] used faith
[1:08:38] to enter into the promised land which is
[1:08:40] a type of the holy ghost
[1:08:42] which is a type of god's divine nature
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:46] yes and god
[1:08:51] he got us out of the world amen he got
[1:08:54] us out of the world
[1:08:59] but you need faith to enter into the
[1:09:00] promised land right
[1:09:04] it's you willing to deny yourself
[1:09:07] and go after the nature of god
[1:09:12] it's not a gift
[1:09:16] without faith it's not a gift without
[1:09:19] faith
[1:09:21] you've got to believe for hebrews
[1:09:22] chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore
[1:09:25] fear last a promise
[1:09:28] being left us of entering into his rest
[1:09:31] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:09:32] it for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:09:34] as well as unto them but the word
[1:09:36] preached did not profit them not being
[1:09:38] mixed with what
[1:09:39] faith in them that heard it we must
[1:09:43] we must mix this gift that god's given
[1:09:46] us
[1:09:46] with faith to receive it amen and we
[1:09:49] need to literally
[1:09:50] fear fear coming to church fearing
[1:09:54] less a promise being left us at church
[1:09:57] when we leave and go back home
[1:09:59] amen you need
[1:10:02] faith to pick up that promise of god you
[1:10:04] need faith to walk out and say
[1:10:06] it is mine it is mine i'm holding to it
[1:10:11] sometimes i'm afraid because we're not
[1:10:14] using
[1:10:14] the promises of god to kick the devil
[1:10:18] out of our life
[1:10:22] let the devil hang around in our minds
[1:10:26] bother us keep us down the bible says in
[1:10:29] my name
[1:10:30] you'll cast out devils
[1:10:33] the promise of god says submit yourself
[1:10:36] therefore god
[1:10:37] resist the devil and he'll flee
[1:10:39] sometimes you've got to tell the devil
[1:10:40] get behind me
[1:10:41] in the name of jesus when's the last
[1:10:44] time you said that
[1:10:46] i'll tell you say it more often you'll
[1:10:47] feel better because the devil will stay
[1:10:49] there as long as you let him to stay
[1:10:50] there
[1:10:52] now god has given us this promise that
[1:10:55] the devil will flee
[1:10:56] if we resist them if we rebuke them
[1:10:59] but we got to take that promise by faith
[1:11:02] and apply it to our lives
[1:11:07] as any promise of god
[1:11:10] god fore knew that the children of
[1:11:12] israel would not
[1:11:14] continue their walk with god
[1:11:17] to overcome and enter in the promise god
[1:11:20] knew that he foreknew that
[1:11:24] yet when they were standing at the red
[1:11:27] sea
[1:11:28] and they couldn't go any other way god
[1:11:31] still provided for them
[1:11:33] yes a way of escape amen
[1:11:37] amen but after a while god says
[1:11:40] you need to start believing in me
[1:11:44] that's it and he deserves that he's god
[1:11:48] he created us he is our creator we are
[1:11:52] his creation
[1:11:53] we were created to please him without
[1:11:55] faith we can't please him
[1:11:57] god expects us to take him at his word
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:03] now god would do that for someone who
[1:12:05] would turn their back on
[1:12:07] god how much more shall he avenge his
[1:12:09] own lack that cried day and night for
[1:12:12] him
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:15] he says i tell you that i will avenge
[1:12:18] them speedily
[1:12:20] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:12:23] shall he find faith on the earth right
[1:12:28] the promises of god are yeah amen
[1:12:31] but our faith has to be gay and amen
[1:12:33] those promises
[1:12:35] let us therefore fear last a promise
[1:12:39] being left us of entering into his rest
[1:12:43] and if you should seem to come short
[1:12:47] partake of the promises of god don't let
[1:12:50] one promise behind claim it
[1:12:53] stand on it stand on the promises
[1:12:57] in this laodicean age our common faith
[1:12:59] must grow
[1:13:00] into what is called a rapturing faith
[1:13:04] a perfect faith for rapture now enoch
[1:13:08] was the type of the bride in this last
[1:13:10] age
[1:13:11] hebrews chapter 11 verse 5 says by faith
[1:13:15] enoch was translated that he should not
[1:13:17] see death
[1:13:18] amen and was not found because he had
[1:13:22] because god had translated him
[1:13:26] but before the translation he had a
[1:13:29] testimony
[1:13:31] and that testimony was that he pleased
[1:13:34] god
[1:13:36] we cannot go into a rapture without the
[1:13:38] same testimony
[1:13:41] we need to please god amen how do i do
[1:13:44] that brother john
[1:13:46] i mean i'm coming to church paying my
[1:13:49] tithes
[1:13:51] you could come to church and pay your
[1:13:52] tithes and not have faith in god
[1:13:58] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:14:01] please
[1:14:01] him amen for he that cometh to god must
[1:14:04] believe that he is
[1:14:05] look at and that he's a rewarder of them
[1:14:08] that diligently
[1:14:09] seek him
[1:14:12] this is important because we want to
[1:14:15] cash in on the promises of god
[1:14:17] that we might obtain the nature of god
[1:14:19] the divine nature of god
[1:14:21] and if we we don't if we don't know that
[1:14:24] god's a rewarder
[1:14:26] we may not get it but we know he's a
[1:14:28] rewarder all we got to do is believe
[1:14:32] believe the word believe the promises
[1:14:35] god is faithful he's not slack
[1:14:37] in his promises amen
[1:14:41] he loves to hand out rewards
[1:14:44] i mean as a they they say as a leader
[1:14:47] a leader is always looking for
[1:14:49] opportunities
[1:14:51] to congratulate somebody on something
[1:14:53] that they've done right
[1:14:56] leaders do they look because you can't
[1:14:59] reward the wrong thing
[1:15:01] hey good job for coming in late today
[1:15:04] you know it just doesn't work but you're
[1:15:06] looking you're looking
[1:15:08] for things to reward and god's the same
[1:15:11] way amen
[1:15:13] he's a reward of them that are
[1:15:15] diligently seeking him amen
[1:15:17] i love that all right number one god has
[1:15:19] given to us promises that he keeps
[1:15:21] it insults him when we doubt or don't
[1:15:24] trust him
[1:15:25] he keeps his promises amen
[1:15:29] number two god will reward you if you
[1:15:31] keep diligently
[1:15:32] seeking him number three
[1:15:36] don't try to squeeze god in
[1:15:40] don't try to squeeze god in your life
[1:15:43] seek the promises of god first make time
[1:15:47] for god first jesus never encourages
[1:15:50] to lay up treasures here on the earth
[1:15:52] that's right amen
[1:15:54] matthew chapter 6 verse 33 but seek ye
[1:15:56] first
[1:15:57] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[1:16:00] and all these things shall be
[1:16:03] added unto you so we got to seek him
[1:16:07] first
[1:16:08] even when jesus taught us to pray he
[1:16:10] taught us to seek
[1:16:11] the promise of his kingdom first
[1:16:14] in matthew chapter 6 verse 10 thy
[1:16:17] kingdom
[1:16:18] come in his prayer thy will be done
[1:16:21] in earth as it is in heaven thy kingdom
[1:16:24] come right amen
[1:16:28] and when the kingdom does come it comes
[1:16:31] inside of us
[1:16:33] jesus on the inside working on the
[1:16:36] outside
[1:16:38] oh what a change that's right amen
[1:16:42] divine nature inside of me amen
[1:16:45] the kingdom of god cometh not with
[1:16:47] observation
[1:16:48] behold the kingdom of god is within you
[1:16:51] amen that's what jesus said number three
[1:16:54] seek first
[1:16:55] the promises of god's divine nature
[1:16:58] seek god's kingdom first
[1:17:03] no peter handed out the keys to the
[1:17:05] kingdom of god's divine nature
[1:17:07] in acts chapter 2 verse 38
[1:17:11] repent be baptized
[1:17:14] and you shall receive god's divine
[1:17:15] nature
[1:17:18] so i want to say this it requires
[1:17:21] humility
[1:17:23] repentance is a humility it's a dying to
[1:17:27] self
[1:17:29] it's a picking up of god's will for your
[1:17:32] life
[1:17:32] amen so following the instructions of
[1:17:35] repentance and baptism through faith
[1:17:37] will inherit god's divine nature it's
[1:17:41] the beginning of your walk
[1:17:42] with the lord now it's no different
[1:17:47] key for this last age same key
[1:17:50] jesus said i counsel thee to buy of me
[1:17:52] gold tried in the fire
[1:17:53] what do we do be zealous repent
[1:17:58] be zealous in other words get
[1:18:00] effectually hot
[1:18:03] and repent sure it means turn around
[1:18:07] but it's a humility you got to be humble
[1:18:11] if you want to receive from god follow
[1:18:12] god's instructions
[1:18:14] through faith and we inherit gold
[1:18:17] amen the deity of god the life of god
[1:18:20] the nature
[1:18:20] of god he's the only one that can give
[1:18:24] us him amen
[1:18:26] it's him it's no different today
[1:18:31] wherever you are at with god your walk
[1:18:33] with god
[1:18:34] first peter chapter five verse five
[1:18:36] likewise younger
[1:18:38] submit yourselves to the elder yay all
[1:18:41] of you
[1:18:41] just every one of you be subject one to
[1:18:44] another
[1:18:45] and be clothed with humility
[1:18:49] amen that should be first and foremost
[1:18:53] not
[1:18:54] fitting them in right for god
[1:18:57] resists a proud nature
[1:19:00] and he gives his grace to the humble
[1:19:04] right amen the conclusion verse 6
[1:19:08] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:19:10] mighty hand of god
[1:19:12] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:19:15] amen grace to receive god's divine
[1:19:19] nature requires the respect of humility
[1:19:25] god expects us to humble ourselves
[1:19:29] and die out to ourself
[1:19:32] and as we follow his instructions for
[1:19:34] the respect of humility
[1:19:35] he will re we will receive more grace
[1:19:40] he giveth grace to the humble more grace
[1:19:44] more i want to be more like jesus
[1:19:48] not in power to go zim boom boom
[1:19:52] but the power to handle the devil who's
[1:19:57] got me in such a rotten place
[1:20:02] that i can defeat the devil in my mind
[1:20:05] amen
[1:20:06] that i can overcome all things
[1:20:11] that's the divine nature i want
[1:20:16] seek first the promises of god's divine
[1:20:18] nature
[1:20:19] with much more humility
[1:20:23] galatians chapter 6 verse 9 let us not
[1:20:25] be weary
[1:20:26] in well-doing for in due season you
[1:20:29] shall reap
[1:20:30] if you faint not so there is a period
[1:20:34] where we're going to be tried before we
[1:20:37] receive the promises of god
[1:20:38] amen amen
[1:20:42] as we have therefore opportunity
[1:20:46] let us do good unto all men especially
[1:20:48] unto them
[1:20:49] whoever the household of faith yes amen
[1:20:52] do you have opportunity to do good unto
[1:20:55] all men
[1:20:57] you know a lot of us kind of avoid
[1:21:01] well-doing
[1:21:05] i've always agreed with thomas edison he
[1:21:08] said opportunity is missed by most
[1:21:10] people because it's dressed in overhauls
[1:21:12] and it looks like work
[1:21:17] but i'll say partake with me
[1:21:20] don't be weary in well-doing you see
[1:21:24] look for opportunities because god is
[1:21:26] pleased
[1:21:28] god is pleased when you labor for him
[1:21:32] amen we have precious promises
[1:21:36] and if we're not weary we're going to
[1:21:38] reap if we faint not well
[1:21:40] revelation chapter 3 verse 20. look at
[1:21:42] this promise behold i stand at the door
[1:21:45] and knock if any man hear my voice and
[1:21:48] open the door
[1:21:48] i will come into him and i will sup with
[1:21:50] him and he with me
[1:21:52] now that's what's really important here
[1:21:56] is that fellowship with jesus amen
[1:21:59] it's a promise amen
[1:22:03] to him that overcometh why grant to sit
[1:22:05] with me on my throne even as i overcame
[1:22:07] this
[1:22:07] with my father in israel what a promise
[1:22:09] amen
[1:22:12] that that promise is going to take you
[1:22:14] all the way
[1:22:15] [Laughter]
[1:22:17] don't let the devil steal your peace
[1:22:22] john 14 verse 27 peace i leave with you
[1:22:25] my peace i give unto you
[1:22:30] that's a promise
[1:22:34] he is our peace that divine
[1:22:38] nature of god living inside of you
[1:22:41] he is our peace that's christ in you
[1:22:46] faith in that word gives you peace
[1:22:52] faith in the promises of god helps
[1:22:55] brings back brings to you the partaking
[1:22:58] of the divine nature of god
[1:23:01] come on amen philippians chapter 4 verse
[1:23:05] 9 those things which you have both
[1:23:06] learned received heard and seen in me do
[1:23:09] and the god of peace shall be with you
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:13] isaiah 26 3 thou shalt keep him in
[1:23:16] perfect peace
[1:23:17] whose mind is staying on thee because he
[1:23:19] trusteth in thee
[1:23:20] this is god inside of you amen
[1:23:26] as our trials can discourage us
[1:23:29] rob us of our joy
[1:23:33] first peter chapter 1 verse 7 that the
[1:23:34] trial of your faith
[1:23:36] is being much more precious than gold
[1:23:38] that perish
[1:23:40] though it be tried and fire might be
[1:23:41] found into the praise and on and the
[1:23:43] glory
[1:23:44] at the appearing of jesus christ
[1:23:48] whom having not seen you love him
[1:23:51] amen in whom though now you see him
[1:23:54] not you believe with all your heart
[1:23:58] and you believe so much that you rejoice
[1:24:03] with joy unspeakable
[1:24:06] and full of glory amen amen
[1:24:10] receiving the end of this faith even the
[1:24:13] salvation
[1:24:14] of your souls john chapter 15 verse 10
[1:24:19] if you keep my commandments he shall
[1:24:21] abide in my love even as i have kept my
[1:24:23] father's commandments and abide in his
[1:24:24] love
[1:24:25] these things have i spoke unto you that
[1:24:27] my joy might
[1:24:29] remain with you right amen that your joy
[1:24:32] might be full
[1:24:33] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:24:35] another as i've loved
[1:24:37] you sometimes
[1:24:40] we just need a restoration of the joy
[1:24:42] that we once had amen
[1:24:44] amen david prayed one time he said
[1:24:46] restore unto me
[1:24:47] the joy of my salvation so i say partake
[1:24:51] with me
[1:24:52] whereby are given to us exceeding great
[1:24:54] and precious promises that by these we
[1:24:56] might
[1:24:56] be partakers of joy of peace
[1:25:01] receiving joy sometimes requires
[1:25:04] humility amen remember he giveth more
[1:25:08] grace to the humble
[1:25:09] our shortcomings can make us feel
[1:25:11] resentful and our trials
[1:25:13] can make us feel bitter sometimes
[1:25:19] i'm glad somebody's saying amen to the
[1:25:21] word because it's true
[1:25:23] despite david's shortcomings he moved
[1:25:25] forward
[1:25:26] with humility
[1:25:32] he was willing to submit to the work of
[1:25:35] the kingdom of god again
[1:25:36] now i want to give you scripture for
[1:25:38] that psalms 51 verse 12
[1:25:41] and 13 verse 12 says restore unto me
[1:25:44] the joy of my salvation and uphold me
[1:25:48] with thy free spirit look at the very
[1:25:50] next verse
[1:25:51] then then then then
[1:25:55] will i teach transgressors thy ways
[1:25:59] and sinners shall be converted unto thee
[1:26:03] wow his motive for joy
[1:26:08] he wanted to you can you imagine trying
[1:26:11] to win somebody over to the lord
[1:26:13] amen i just it really stinks you know
[1:26:15] what i'm going through but
[1:26:17] hey you know
[1:26:20] you want to serve the lord with me
[1:26:25] but if you've got something
[1:26:29] if you've got joy they want joy we're
[1:26:31] living in a world where there's hardly
[1:26:33] no joy there's hardly no love there's
[1:26:35] hardly no peace
[1:26:37] but i'm telling you god hasn't changed
[1:26:38] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:26:41] forever
[1:26:41] and we can obtain this to his promises
[1:26:44] and we just believe the word for
[1:26:45] ourselves
[1:26:46] it doesn't matter what happens to the
[1:26:47] right what happens to the left who
[1:26:49] leaves who stays what happens
[1:26:51] it is for me and my house i will serve
[1:26:53] the lord
[1:26:55] we can't let these promises slip
[1:27:00] their precious promises romans chapter 8
[1:27:04] verse 1 there is now
[1:27:06] no condemnation to them that walk
[1:27:09] which are in christ jesus who walked not
[1:27:11] after the flesh
[1:27:13] but after the spirit see the two
[1:27:15] different seeds
[1:27:17] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:27:19] christ jesus
[1:27:20] it has made me free from all my efforts
[1:27:24] of trying to do right and wrong
[1:27:26] galatians 5 16 this i say
[1:27:29] walk in the spirit and you should not
[1:27:31] fulfill the lust of the flesh now this
[1:27:33] is a promise of god
[1:27:34] amen i want to be able to express the
[1:27:38] divine nature of god
[1:27:40] and if i walk in the spirit i'll not
[1:27:42] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:27:45] it's through this promise i can have his
[1:27:47] divine nature
[1:27:48] it's important to the bride to have the
[1:27:50] nature of christ
[1:27:53] whereby are given to us exceeding great
[1:27:55] and precious promises i say partake
[1:27:57] with me partake of this promise with me
[1:28:01] partake of philippians chapter 4 verse
[1:28:03] 13 i can do all things through christ
[1:28:06] which strengtheneth me amen all things
[1:28:10] the divine nature of christ in me i can
[1:28:13] do all things
[1:28:14] i can overcome i can believe when
[1:28:16] everything is
[1:28:17] is stacked against me like abraham
[1:28:20] against hope believed in hope and then
[1:28:22] he's staying out of the promises of god
[1:28:24] through unbelief we are the children of
[1:28:28] abraham through faith
[1:28:30] not through sight not through feelings
[1:28:32] not through emotions
[1:28:34] it doesn't matter i want to stand like
[1:28:36] job he had that divine nature
[1:28:38] he said though the lord slay me yet
[1:28:41] while i trust him
[1:28:43] something inside of him was willing to
[1:28:45] stand with the word
[1:28:46] regardless if he didn't understand why
[1:28:48] he was being slain
[1:28:51] he's faithful to the lord
[1:28:54] psalms 46 verse 1 god is our refuge
[1:28:59] and our strength a very present
[1:29:03] help in trouble partake with me this
[1:29:06] promise
[1:29:07] don't let it don't let it slip don't let
[1:29:10] it just be a word
[1:29:12] don't let it be seen like idle tails
[1:29:15] do you believe he's a present help in a
[1:29:17] time of trouble
[1:29:20] don't make god a liar he's not a liar
[1:29:22] he's a present help in a time of trouble
[1:29:25] if he's not for you it ain't because god
[1:29:28] isn't
[1:29:29] right it means you're not believing for
[1:29:31] it i'll say do you get in trouble
[1:29:33] sometimes
[1:29:36] you could use this scripture right here
[1:29:38] you could use the divine nature of god
[1:29:40] because i tell you when i'm in trouble
[1:29:42] i really want god on the scene i want
[1:29:45] god oh
[1:29:46] at very least you're trouble i mean you
[1:29:49] caused it
[1:29:50] you sinned you're bad you're in trouble

[1:29:54] you need the divine nature of mercy
[1:29:57] of grace of longsuffering
[1:30:01] of god be patient with me
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:08] psalms 32 7 some of these
[1:30:11] some of these we haven't heard before
[1:30:13] thou art my hiding place
[1:30:16] thou shalt preserve me for trouble thou
[1:30:19] shalt come past me about with songs of
[1:30:22] deliverance
[1:30:22] amen you ever get thoughts in your head
[1:30:26] they just seem to come
[1:30:28] bombard you and all sudden you start
[1:30:30] singing a song
[1:30:33] song of deliverance the devil just
[1:30:35] leaves
[1:30:36] and all of a sudden you're free from
[1:30:37] that negativity
[1:30:39] amen songs of deliverance i will
[1:30:42] instruct thee
[1:30:43] now look at this promise i will teach
[1:30:45] thee in the way
[1:30:47] which thou shalt go that's right
[1:30:50] and i will guide thee with my eye yes
[1:30:53] these
[1:30:54] promises are yea and amen we've got to
[1:30:57] believe them
[1:30:59] i i understand
[1:31:08] we all honestly we all have things in
[1:31:11] our life
[1:31:15] that seem unbearable
[1:31:18] can you say amen to that just want to
[1:31:21] make sure that you're with me
[1:31:26] but god said he'd not put anything on
[1:31:28] you
[1:31:30] that could bring you down
[1:31:33] he'd make a way of escape did he not
[1:31:36] he'd make a way so you could bear that
[1:31:38] situation
[1:31:39] you you it may not vanish
[1:31:43] but greater is he that's in you that
[1:31:45] divine
[1:31:46] nature than he that's in the world and
[1:31:49] the thing is
[1:31:50] if you don't stand up by faith and say
[1:31:53] it is mine that
[1:31:56] demon will stay there because it is not
[1:32:00] god there's only two there's only two
[1:32:04] seeds one's the flesh
[1:32:05] one is spirit right
[1:32:08] you gotta take a stand amen
[1:32:12] well brother john i just don't feel like
[1:32:14] it well
[1:32:15] it's not my feelings if
[1:32:19] i if the gospel was by feelings i would
[1:32:21] never step up here

[1:32:28] i said you know when i first started out
[1:32:30] i used to tell a lot of stories
[1:32:33] my whole message was just one story
[1:32:35] after another
[1:32:38] but it just seems that i've gotten so
[1:32:40] far away from that
[1:32:44] but stories and things they really help
[1:32:46] you feel good
[1:32:47] help you feel like believing
[1:32:52] but if you're not going to have faith
[1:32:54] based on the word of god what good
[1:32:56] is feelings helping you believe right
[1:32:59] right
[1:33:00] amen that's right

[1:33:06] you're not love with this
[1:33:08] you're not in love with this person
[1:33:10] you're not loved the way he
[1:33:12] speaks you not love the way he looks
[1:33:14] you're not the way
[1:33:15] in love with the way he delivers you're
[1:33:19] in love

[1:33:23] doesn't matter
[1:33:24] the the uh who god uses to bring you the
[1:33:28] word
[1:33:30] what matters is that you love the word
[1:33:33] with all your heart with all your soul
[1:33:35] with all your might
[1:33:37] and you believe it it's for you
[1:33:38] personally because it's your relation
[1:33:41] you have a relationship with the word
[1:33:44] now your feelings the relationships with
[1:33:48] you with the word of god
[1:33:51] joshua chapter 1 verse 5 there shall not
[1:33:55] any man be able to stand before thee

[1:34:21] telling you
[1:34:22] before god came along moses was a
[1:34:26] scaredy cat
[1:34:28] but when he got in the presence of the
[1:34:30] holy ghost
[1:34:31] he could stand there in the face of the
[1:34:34] head
[1:34:34] of the whole world right amen fearless
[1:34:40] even when things was happening in front
[1:34:42] of him
[1:34:43] that god didn't tell him about right
[1:34:46] he still believed god was with him he
[1:34:48] still believed greater was
[1:34:50] god inside of him than what was ever

[1:35:29] thy god is with you whatsoever thou
[1:35:31] goest now that word
[1:35:34] dismayed means bewildered
[1:35:38] about something ever been bewildered
[1:35:41] about something i can't believe
[1:35:44] brother john just did that
[1:35:48] why did he do that i'm bewildered

[1:35:58] wheresoever you go with right amen

[1:39:09] and he rewards you with himself amen
[1:39:12] his divine nature
[1:39:16] and it's something more lasting than
[1:39:18] just listening to a song
[1:39:23] don't let the promise of healing for our
[1:39:25] body
[1:39:26] our spirit or our soul
[1:39:29] get left behind we have promises
[1:39:33] first peter chapter 2 verse 24 first
[1:39:35] peter chapter 2 verse 24
[1:39:37] who his own self bare
[1:39:40] our sins in his own body on the tree
[1:39:45] that we being dead to sins should live
[1:39:48] unto righteousness
[1:39:50] by whose stripes we were healed
[1:39:54] right amen we were
[1:39:57] already healed
[1:40:00] we don't have to wonder if god
[1:40:04] is in favor of our healing
[1:40:08] he already said i'm in favor i would
[1:40:12] above all things that thou may prosper
[1:40:15] and in being health even as i so
[1:40:17] prospered
[1:40:18] right amen isaiah 53 verse 5
[1:40:22] but he was wounded for our transgression
[1:40:25] he was
[1:40:26] bruised for our iniquities talk about
[1:40:27] healing for body soul and spirit here
[1:40:30] amen the chastisement of our peace was
[1:40:33] upon him
[1:40:34] and with his stripes we are healed amen
[1:40:39] by this promise we can be a partaker
[1:40:44] of god's divine nature i say partake
[1:40:46] with me
[1:40:48] don't leave this promise here take it
[1:40:49] with you
[1:40:51] luke chapter 11 verse nine we're we're
[1:40:56] we're we're coming down to a close here
[1:40:58] i know it's a few minutes extra
[1:41:01] but i hope to you it's worth it amen
[1:41:04] luke chapter 11 verse 9
[1:41:06] and i say unto you ask and it shall be
[1:41:09] given to you
[1:41:11] seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:41:13] shall be open unto you
[1:41:14] for everyone that asketh he receives and
[1:41:17] he that
[1:41:18] seeketh finds and he that knocks
[1:41:22] it shall be open amen just if you
[1:41:25] haven't got what you wanted
[1:41:27] keep asking keep seeking keep knocking
[1:41:32] if abraham did it for 25 years
[1:41:35] you should be able to do it for well you
[1:41:37] fill in the blank
[1:41:39] your children of abraham you're just
[1:41:41] going to keep asking you're going to
[1:41:42] keep seeking
[1:41:43] you're going to keep believing in god
[1:41:45] it's his word
[1:41:48] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[1:41:52] that is a father
[1:41:53] all right this is to the fathers good
[1:41:56] example
[1:41:58] would you give him a stone and say ha ha
[1:42:00] ha ha
[1:42:03] or if you ask a fish would you give him
[1:42:06] a serpent and say ha ha ha
[1:42:09] i don't think so
[1:42:12] or if he ask an egg would you offer him
[1:42:16] a scorpion
[1:42:18] fish for serpent egg instead of
[1:42:22] a scorpion instead of an egg wow
[1:42:26] no one in the right mind would do that
[1:42:29] no one
[1:42:31] yet if you then being evil
[1:42:35] know how to give good gifts to your own
[1:42:38] children how much more shall your
[1:42:41] heavenly father
[1:42:42] give you the divine nature if you ask
[1:42:45] for it
[1:42:50] so i'm saying we live in a world where
[1:42:51] people don't even want the divine nature
[1:42:53] of god
[1:42:56] it's so sad they're very content with
[1:42:59] their own will
[1:43:02] but god has promised us the holy ghost
[1:43:05] and jesus invites us to partake of the
[1:43:07] tree of life
[1:43:09] partake of the divine nature it's
[1:43:12] through the promises of god that we can
[1:43:14] be a partaker
[1:43:16] of god's nature and i'll ask this
[1:43:18] morning invite you this morning
[1:43:20] partake with me
[1:43:23] get into the word start going through
[1:43:26] this word
[1:43:27] there's so many promises in here
[1:43:30] thousands
[1:43:31] there's thousands of promises
[1:43:34] that through these promises we might be
[1:43:37] partakers
[1:43:38] of god's divine nature i want to be like
[1:43:39] god i'm gonna be honest with you
[1:43:42] it's not that i'm worried about what
[1:43:44] some man is gonna do to me i don't want
[1:43:45] the devil slapping me around
[1:43:47] right right i'm just being honest with
[1:43:50] you
[1:43:52] because that all happens up here
[1:43:55] i want to be so full of god's divine
[1:43:58] nature
[1:43:58] that i just put in order his disorder
[1:44:02] when he comes to my mind tell them to
[1:44:05] get out of here
[1:44:06] this is god's property this is god's
[1:44:09] sanctuary
[1:44:09] amen amen and through
[1:44:13] and though our flesh is weak we may
[1:44:16] want to say oh that ishmael might live
[1:44:19] in other words
[1:44:20] our fleshly will might live
[1:44:23] but as abraham was predestined to bring
[1:44:25] forth a son
[1:44:28] that was naturally impossible for him to
[1:44:31] do
[1:44:32] so are we predestinated to bring forth
[1:44:35] the son of god which is naturally
[1:44:38] impossible to do
[1:44:40] but through the same faith that he had
[1:44:44] to bring forth isaac is the same faith
[1:44:47] that will bring forth the second isaac
[1:44:49] through us
[1:44:50] christ we exercise that same faith
[1:44:53] and it's much harder now no
[1:44:57] we're not old in age going through that
[1:45:02] trial but we're in the hardest age there
[1:45:04] ever was
[1:45:05] you got every distraction that's could
[1:45:08] be thrown at you
[1:45:09] trying to get you off track of becoming
[1:45:12] like christ
[1:45:13] amen satan's got a deck of cards just
[1:45:16] you know whatever you want whatever you
[1:45:17] want whatever you want
[1:45:21] and he spends all week just flooding our
[1:45:23] minds with doubts
[1:45:24] fears
[1:45:27] read the news never lifts you up
[1:45:32] never makes you feel better
[1:45:35] just vex is your soul but god has given
[1:45:39] us precious
[1:45:40] promises that by these promises
[1:45:44] we can be a partaker we can
[1:45:47] have the divine nature of god that we
[1:45:50] can
[1:45:51] add to our faith virtue virtue knowledge
[1:45:54] and knowledge temperance patience
[1:45:55] godliness
[1:45:56] probably kindness to probably kind of
[1:45:58] love we can have that
[1:45:59] inside it won't be something we just
[1:46:02] read about on the pages
[1:46:03] or we just hear about at church we can
[1:46:05] now say
[1:46:06] i am the living word of god it dwells
[1:46:09] inside of me today
[1:46:12] amen the whole
[1:46:15] earth is in travail let's stand together

[1:46:26] of god
[1:46:28] to bring forth this divine nature as
[1:46:30] sons of god
[1:46:32] now the bride is making herself ready
[1:46:34] how she doing it
[1:46:36] she's partaking of these promises
[1:46:39] because it's by these promises that we
[1:46:41] become his divine nature

[1:46:49] and rejoice and give honor to him

[1:46:57] and his wife have made
[1:47:01] herself ready amen

[1:47:19] that denomination but she made herself
[1:47:23] ready by believing the promise that god
