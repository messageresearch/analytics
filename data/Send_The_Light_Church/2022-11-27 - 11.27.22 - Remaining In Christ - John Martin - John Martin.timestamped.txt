[35:51] it's a great honor to put the flesh down
[35:53] to crucify it and and have our souls go
[35:56] to the house of the Lord and be with
[35:58] brothers and sisters of light precious
[36:00] Faith before we begin reading here in
[36:02] first Thessalonians chapter four let's
[36:04] look to the Lord in a word of prayer and
[36:07] just ask His blessings on this part of
[36:09] the service Heavenly Father
[36:11] Lord we love you we thank you that you
[36:14] you made it possible that we could be
[36:16] gathered together we thank you for the
[36:18] love and the Holy Spirit and the fire
[36:20] that you uh that is in each one of us
[36:24] that each one brought here to the
[36:26] service just to make this service better
[36:29] and we pray that you would come and
[36:31] consume our sacrifice Lord that you
[36:35] would burn it with the fire of God and
[36:37] may you Reveal Your word to us and may
[36:39] you draw us closer to you and may there
[36:42] be healings that take place not just in
[36:45] our bodies and but in our spirits and in
[36:48] our souls and every part of us Lord that
[36:50] need to be revived to be strengthened
[36:53] and to be helped to be encouraged father
[36:56] we also pray that you would direct Our
[36:57] Lives direct us into all truth Lord you
[37:01] know where we've been you know where
[37:03] we're at and Lord you know where you're
[37:06] leading us to we just pray that as a
[37:08] church you'd give us ears to hear what
[37:10] what you're speaking to us Lord father I
[37:13] pray that you'd close my mouth if I
[37:15] would go to say anything that would be
[37:17] of myself Lord let it not happen but I
[37:20] prayed Lord that you would use these
[37:22] lips you would use this mind you would
[37:23] use this heart and Lord that you would
[37:25] speak the Word of Life the wonderful
[37:27] Words of Life to each of your children
[37:30] here your elect your bride father we
[37:33] commit the service into your hands and
[37:35] we pray that you blessed now the reading
[37:37] of your word and give you the praise for
[37:40] it all in Jesus Christ's precious name
[37:42] amen amen first Thessalonians chapter 4
[37:46] starting with verse 13.
[37:49] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[37:52] Brethren concerning them which are
[37:54] asleep that ye sorrow not even as others
[37:57] which have no hope
[37:59] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[38:02] rose again even so them also which sleep
[38:05] in Jesus will God bring with him
[38:09] for this we say unto you by the word of
[38:12] the Lord that we which are alive and
[38:15] remain unto the coming of the Lord
[38:18] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[38:23] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[38:25] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[38:27] the Archangel with the trumpet of God in
[38:29] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[38:32] then we which are alive and remain
[38:36] shall be caught up together with them in
[38:39] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[38:41] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[38:45] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[38:48] words
[38:49] amen God bless you may be seated we want
[38:52] to entitle this message remaining in
[38:54] Christ
[38:57] and for a subject I want to have
[39:00] remaining alive
[39:02] in Christ
[39:05] and so we're going to talk a little bit
[39:07] about the difference here
[39:09] and I hope that you've come
[39:12] expecting to receive
[39:15] from the Lord amen and that you're
[39:18] you're here in the spirit
[39:20] because uh that's where you can really
[39:23] receive from God is when you are in the
[39:26] spirit Amen brother Branham said in the
[39:28] message the seed shall not be air with
[39:31] the shock he said not everyone is going
[39:33] into a Rapture but we're believing unto
[39:36] the coming of the Lord he says we are
[39:39] under great expectations for two things
[39:41] I listen to these two things one for the
[39:44] coming of the Lord and two for lost
[39:47] souls to come in to be ready for the
[39:50] coming of the Lord I mean his whole
[39:53] expectation
[39:54] is about the coming of the Lord for
[39:57] himself and for those that need to be in
[39:59] it and I'll tell you that's a good frame
[40:01] of mind to be in when the world's
[40:04] pulling on you we want to just get our
[40:07] Compass back towards where it needs to
[40:09] be amen
[40:11] it's hard to keep believing the
[40:13] scriptures
[40:16] as the scriptures teach us
[40:19] to keep that expectation in this age
[40:24] it's the hardest age to live in
[40:27] the Bible says that we're living in the
[40:30] greatest hour of apostasy that's been
[40:33] known to history
[40:36] iniquity in immorality are escalating in
[40:39] our society
[40:41] the world standard of right and wrong is
[40:45] changing at enormous speeds
[40:49] second Thessalonians 2 3 says let no man
[40:52] deceive you by any means for that day
[40:54] shall not come except there come a
[40:57] falling away first
[40:59] and the man of sin be revealed the son
[41:01] of perdition
[41:03] when Believers began to Fall Away
[41:06] from walking in truth that is when sin
[41:11] begins to be revealed
[41:13] as soon as we begin to walk away from
[41:16] truth that's when sins become revealed
[41:19] now that word falling in May Falling
[41:21] Away means detection from the truth or
[41:25] not detection deflection
[41:27] defection from the truth apostasy
[41:30] forsaking or switching sides
[41:34] Lucifer switch sides
[41:37] he defected from the truth he got the
[41:40] Angels he got Eve to do it and he's
[41:43] working greatly in this age that we're
[41:45] living in to defect more and more people
[41:48] from the truth
[41:50] now we think well how does this have to
[41:54] do with us where does where do we come
[41:56] in what are you trying to say Brother
[41:57] John
[41:59] I'm trying to say
[42:01] that every demon in hell is fighting
[42:04] against us is trying to get us to to
[42:08] backslide into this lukewarmness
[42:12] amen and Cheryl had told me about the
[42:15] something she had read about the second
[42:16] largest denomination in the U.S they're
[42:20] embracing immortality in in Morality
[42:23] right now
[42:25] and because of it 20 percent of the
[42:27] people about 20 percent have decided to
[42:29] leave the church
[42:32] nearly 80 percent are remaining in the
[42:35] church
[42:37] now that doesn't mean that all 80
[42:39] percent is lqb TQ analysis i a
[42:44] foreign
[42:46] we can distinguish between two types if
[42:49] of immorality one is wickedness and one
[42:53] is weakness
[42:55] remember Jesus said the fearful and the
[42:58] unbelieving end up in the same place
[43:03] so one we accept and embrace it that is
[43:06] wickedness we accept it we embrace it we
[43:08] become part of it
[43:10] but the other is we don't embrace the
[43:13] ACT
[43:14] but we're too weak to remove ourselves
[43:16] from it
[43:18] and a good example of that is lot
[43:21] right he pitched his tent toward Sodom
[43:24] towards the world and we learned that
[43:26] Sodom grew up around lot and he didn't
[43:29] separate from it then as it were embrace
[43:33] it but it was too weak and so it is a
[43:36] form of immorality a weakness
[43:39] I think believe the Bible says that his
[43:41] righteous Soul was vexed daily
[43:43] another example is Lot's wife
[43:48] she left finally had to leave because it
[43:52] was destruction and she left
[43:55] but in her heart she never left
[43:59] she left in her body but her heart
[44:01] didn't turned around
[44:04] and and so there's two ways that we
[44:07] could
[44:10] uh enter into apostasy
[44:14] and and the one is real deceptive you
[44:16] don't even know what's happening
[44:18] but God is calling his elect out
[44:22] we know the scripture come out of her my
[44:24] people and be not partakers of our sins
[44:26] and one way to look at
[44:28] um
[44:29] these people that have came out of that
[44:31] denomination because they were believing
[44:33] in something that wasn't scriptural
[44:35] we can look at it that it it they they
[44:38] came out of a man-made denomination and
[44:40] and and and now it's it can be a
[44:43] man-made non-denomination
[44:45] it doesn't matter if it's denomination
[44:47] or or non-denominational there could
[44:50] still be man-made
[44:54] but another way we can look at this is
[44:56] that we're coming out of man
[45:00] uh man's own man-made sin in his own
[45:05] life
[45:07] because we ourselves are a church
[45:10] and uh we have control what's in our
[45:14] church
[45:15] and uh
[45:19] either way we must take a stand against
[45:21] the immorality that's trying to come
[45:23] against us
[45:25] from the world or just you know inside
[45:27] of us
[45:28] the devil's always trying to get us to
[45:31] to compromise
[45:34] now we are promised in the last days
[45:36] when the gravity of sin is pulling the
[45:38] church down that there's a tiny little
[45:40] group that's going to remain faithful
[45:41] unto the coming of the Lord
[45:44] then we which are alive and remain shall
[45:47] be caught up together with them in the
[45:49] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[45:51] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[45:54] I would like to take a minute and talk
[45:56] about the word remain Webster defines
[45:59] remain as staying in the same place
[46:02] or with the same person or the same
[46:04] group
[46:05] as a verb it means to abide dwell tarry
[46:08] hang around or stick around
[46:12] Cambridge Dictionary defines remain as
[46:16] to stay in the same place or in the same
[46:18] condition
[46:20] those of you that are Hunters when you
[46:22] go out to hunt you often face a decision
[46:25] am I going to stay here and be quiet
[46:27] believing that something's going to come
[46:29] or should I go to another place where I
[46:32] think they might be
[46:34] are you with me amen all right everyone
[46:37] who rides a bus needs to remain at the
[46:41] bus stop until the bus comes
[46:43] right so this is the way that we we look
[46:45] at the word remain
[46:48] but there's more to remaining unto the
[46:51] come to the Lord than just sticking
[46:52] around
[46:55] or staying in the same place
[46:57] look at the ten virgins
[47:00] ten remain unto the coming of the Lord
[47:02] but only five were caught up
[47:05] amen the five that were caught up
[47:09] or the five that weren't caught up
[47:11] they still went to church
[47:14] they were faithful they gave offerings
[47:17] they remained living a good clean life
[47:24] they even remained in the message
[47:27] but they did not remain alive
[47:34] they didn't take the only thing that
[47:35] could keep them alive and that was more
[47:37] Holy Ghost I like what brother Mark said
[47:39] today
[47:40] he said you want to stay on fire get
[47:42] more Holy Ghost that's what he said
[47:44] and there's a there's a truth to that
[47:46] because you take any oil any gas that
[47:49] you're trying to burn a furnace or burn
[47:51] a a wood fire you need to keep putting
[47:54] the wood to it you need to keep putting
[47:55] the gas to it
[47:57] and and you got to remember we have the
[48:00] Holy Ghost in portion
[48:02] that means we need more to keep burning
[48:08] five of them thought they had enough
[48:12] that's how Wicked that spirit is
[48:16] Church Believers are remaining in many
[48:19] things but they're not remaining alive
[48:21] in Christ
[48:23] the remaining
[48:24] they're keeping their confession
[48:27] but some have defected from even coming
[48:29] to church we know believers who sat with
[48:31] us that are not coming to church what is
[48:34] happening
[48:36] right we that are here
[48:39] are told to admonish those that are not
[48:45] to be here and all the more as we see
[48:47] the day approaching that's what God
[48:49] wants us to do to them now will they
[48:52] come I don't know some will some won't
[48:54] but we got a job to do amen amen
[48:57] amen some Believers are remaining a
[49:00] church but they have defected from
[49:03] humbly preparing their hearts
[49:08] some remain listening to The Taste but
[49:10] they defect it from pressing into living
[49:12] with a tape of saying
[49:16] so you're alive in Christ
[49:20] when you move forward in him
[49:23] that's what it means to remain alive in
[49:26] Christ is to remove to go forward what
[49:29] he's speaking to you amen
[49:32] five virgins kept moving forward in the
[49:34] Holy Ghost
[49:36] the other five did not
[49:39] they did not get on uh to getting all
[49:42] that they needed to to be accepted as
[49:46] God's bride because see God is the one
[49:47] that does the choosing
[49:50] and we know Satan is very good at
[49:52] telling people who don't have the Holy
[49:54] Ghost that they got it
[49:56] and he even tells people who got the
[49:58] holy ghost that they don't got it
[50:00] so he tells the people who's not elect
[50:02] that they're elected and tells the
[50:03] people who are elected they're not elect
[50:05] he is the god of confusion is true
[50:13] we don't want to be relying solely on
[50:16] the doctrine of predestination
[50:20] or just relying on that that God's love
[50:23] is not going to separate me and him
[50:29] I don't know how those foolish virgins
[50:33] were
[50:34] but they felt they had enough
[50:38] they felt all they had to do was remain
[50:40] unto the coming of the Lord
[50:43] right are you with me
[50:45] living the life that they were living
[50:47] but when it came time for the catching
[50:50] of the way catching away
[50:52] they weren't called
[50:54] they weren't called up or they weren't
[50:57] chosen however you want to say it
[51:00] because look I I think when the day
[51:04] comes when when the Rapture happens
[51:05] everybody's not going to know about it
[51:07] ain't like everybody's going to be
[51:08] called at that moment
[51:10] it's only those who are ready
[51:13] right the calling is now amen the
[51:17] calling is now the Rapture is the the
[51:19] actual proof that you were chosen now's
[51:22] the time that we believe that we're
[51:24] chosen but we that are chosen we follow
[51:29] what the word says that's how we know
[51:31] we're chosen
[51:34] the brand gave us some good advice
[51:37] about the Holy Ghost he says when you
[51:39] come up to the Altar and you're seeking
[51:41] the Holy Ghost and you think you got it
[51:43] he says you stay there and you keep
[51:45] praying for more
[51:48] and you just stay there longer until
[51:52] you get more
[51:54] he says and then after you get that
[51:57] you stay there more
[52:00] he was sending us a message Saints
[52:04] because Satan is always I mean just
[52:07] think about this when you get down to
[52:08] pray you're not even seeking the Holy
[52:10] Ghost but you're just getting down to
[52:11] pray to say your prayers or whatever
[52:13] you're getting down there to pray for
[52:16] and it isn't long before you hear Satan
[52:19] come by and say you prayed enough
[52:21] it's true it's time to get up and go on
[52:24] with the day
[52:28] but the holy spirit is the one that's
[52:30] telling us to wait upon him
[52:32] to wait on the Lord that's where the
[52:34] strength comes the longer you wait
[52:37] the more strength you get
[52:39] amen amen we can't stop moving forward
[52:42] we can't sit idle
[52:44] we can't remain alive in Christ without
[52:47] moving forward and manifesting Christ
[52:49] without manifesting the word that he's
[52:52] given us
[52:53] I think one of the biggest tricks the
[52:55] devil
[52:56] polls on Believers is that no matter
[52:58] what their choices are they're still
[53:00] remaining with God
[53:01] this is a it's a terrible trick we've
[53:06] seen too many people defect switch sides
[53:08] who who we believe we're solid enough
[53:11] that we're going to stay in the message
[53:12] they were going to stay in church
[53:15] and then they're gone
[53:19] that's scary
[53:21] so don't rely on a false sense of
[53:24] security
[53:26] Jesus warned us about remaining in the
[53:29] Vine
[53:31] that a branch can can be connected to
[53:34] the vine and yet it have no life in it
[53:37] brother Mark and I were talking about I
[53:40] believe it was brother Mark talking
[53:41] about trees with dead limbs in them
[53:44] they're still in the tree but there's no
[53:47] life in it
[53:48] and and Jesus talked about those uh
[53:52] branches that that weren't bearing fruit
[53:55] that he would actually
[53:56] prune it off the vine he'd get rid of it
[54:01] so you can be connected
[54:03] as it were
[54:05] in one way to Christ but not bearing
[54:08] fruit
[54:09] and it's a trick
[54:11] Jesus said without me you can do nothing
[54:15] without me you can't bear fruit
[54:18] except you abide in the Vine
[54:21] the moment that you're not abiding The
[54:23] Life of Christ is the moment that your
[54:25] spiritual life will begin to wither
[54:28] that the fruit of joy and peace and love
[54:32] for one another
[54:33] come on we're living in an age where
[54:35] iniquity is abounding the love of many
[54:38] is waxing cold everything's becoming
[54:41] selfish and unthankful
[54:44] every branch in me that beareth not
[54:46] fruit he said is taken away
[54:49] so we can be in Christ and not bear
[54:52] fruit it's a very very tricky
[54:56] so we don't want to just remain in
[54:58] Christ we want to remain alive
[55:02] at a place where we're bearing fruit and
[55:04] how do we know that
[55:05] we've got to allow the Holy Ghost to
[55:07] speak to us
[55:09] and I know it it seems a little bit
[55:12] discouraging uh when we hear that uh we
[55:17] didn't hit the mark that we're not
[55:19] perfect that we're we we're we're not
[55:22] where we need to be I understand that's
[55:24] discouraging but that's the job of the
[55:27] Holy Ghost he has many things to say
[55:29] unto us
[55:32] we got to let him speak amen now that's
[55:35] not John Martin speaking
[55:37] all right I'm sorry John Martin has
[55:38] nothing to do with what God's doing in
[55:41] your life
[55:44] he can use anybody
[55:45] he can use a donkey to speak to us
[55:50] look at the children of Israel they all
[55:52] came out of Egypt
[55:53] they all drank from The Rock they all
[55:55] ate Manna From Heaven they all had
[55:57] testimonies they all remained with the
[55:59] prophet the message of the hour but they
[56:02] stopped moving forward what the prophet
[56:04] spoke
[56:05] amen
[56:06] they all remain followers of the pillar
[56:09] of Fire the cloud by day but they stop
[56:12] moving further in truth
[56:17] God kept telling them to move forward in
[56:19] faith but they didn't want to
[56:23] complaining was their go-to character
[56:28] that was their default character
[56:31] we can't remain alive without moving
[56:34] forward in Christ
[56:36] he doesn't sit still
[56:38] he's still working on getting the last
[56:40] seed in
[56:42] too many people say that they're being
[56:44] led by God but they aren't willing to
[56:46] walk in the light that God gave them
[56:50] God is here to lead and guide us into
[56:52] all truth and I want that I want that
[56:54] for my life
[56:56] remember this statement there's no
[56:58] remaining in Christ without moving
[56:59] forward
[57:01] there's no remaining in Christ without
[57:03] moving forward
[57:05] the only way to not go backwards as a
[57:08] Christian is to keep moving forward
[57:10] see Satan wants us to think you know as
[57:13] long as we're doing this as long as
[57:14] we're doing that we're okay that is such
[57:16] a lie God is on a mission to see the the
[57:19] fullness of his the the fullness of the
[57:23] the statue of a perfect man inside every
[57:25] one of us
[57:27] that's where he's at that's what he's
[57:29] he's trying to get us to do to see that
[57:34] so when you get on fire for God don't
[57:36] allow the devil to tempt you to a bed of
[57:39] ease
[57:40] to take it easy I'll just say keep the
[57:43] pedal to the metal
[57:45] and keep going forward don't let up
[57:48] don't turn around don't take a minute
[57:52] I'll tell you I hate that phone
[57:57] what a distraction
[58:00] this is on sale
[58:03] Black Friday Cyber Monday Saturday 20
[58:07] off more than it was Black Friday
[58:11] something to get our attention
[58:15] why did brother Brandon say you'll never
[58:17] leave the church the same way you came
[58:19] in
[58:21] he said well either get closer to God or
[58:23] further away from him
[58:25] and sometimes we think we're feeling the
[58:27] way we're feeling because of the
[58:28] preacher
[58:30] or the song leader or somebody in the
[58:32] church did something wrong
[58:36] we'll either accept the truth
[58:39] of where we're at
[58:42] of where we're at what the Holy Ghost
[58:45] has said to us what he wants us to do or
[58:49] will reject it truth amen amen and
[58:52] that's what determines whether we're
[58:54] closer or further away
[58:56] not about how we feel
[59:00] we can feel close
[59:02] sometimes we wake up feeling like a nut
[59:04] and sometimes we don't
[59:06] million bucks
[59:09] a million in a hole
[59:11] in debt
[59:13] the only way not to go backwards is to
[59:15] keep moving forward
[59:17] that's all there is to it
[59:19] the spirit of this age is lukewarm right
[59:23] it's not denying the truth Christ the
[59:27] word
[59:28] or the message of the hour
[59:30] it's compromising
[59:33] it's compromising in what God's given
[59:35] right
[59:37] right that's the apostasy
[59:39] and that's why it's so hard for people
[59:41] to see it because they say I believe I
[59:44] believe I believe but they're
[59:46] compromising with something in their
[59:47] lives
[59:50] and they're falling in that same
[59:52] apostasy
[59:54] right that's true they're neither cold
[59:58] or hot
[1:00:01] they're not ice cold they're not in
[1:00:03] total denial of God
[1:00:04] but they're neither walking in the
[1:00:06] spirit
[1:00:07] right hunting for God's right
[1:00:12] they're not ice cold and denying the
[1:00:14] Bible is God's word or God sent a
[1:00:17] prophet or but the message of the hour
[1:00:20] but yet they're confessing Believers are
[1:00:22] not willing to tally up with what he
[1:00:25] said what the Bible says they can hear
[1:00:27] the word preached and they won't change
[1:00:31] they won't do nothing
[1:00:33] and I'll tell you one of the greatest
[1:00:35] things that we can have sitting in the
[1:00:36] church is a heart that's pricked by the
[1:00:38] Holy Ghost
[1:00:41] a conscience that says oh God I want to
[1:00:43] please you more give me that over every
[1:00:46] perfect Sherman that makes me feel good
[1:00:48] because that will never get me where I
[1:00:51] need to go
[1:00:56] neither cold or hot not completely dead
[1:00:59] to God
[1:01:01] but not alive walking in the spirit
[1:01:02] either
[1:01:04] here is God's message to the lukewarm
[1:01:06] believer
[1:01:08] I would thou work cold or hot how would
[1:01:12] you just choose a side
[1:01:14] because when we're in a in the middle to
[1:01:18] where we don't choose a side we become a
[1:01:20] stumbling block to everybody that looks
[1:01:21] at our life
[1:01:23] I could see why God's saying that
[1:01:27] he finally told Lucifer hey if you do
[1:01:30] not want to be what I have created you
[1:01:33] to be to do the job that you were doing
[1:01:35] for I don't know how many thousands of
[1:01:37] years then you get out
[1:01:41] choose the side
[1:01:43] don't sit here and try to act this way
[1:01:45] in front of me go behind my back and
[1:01:47] talk to the other angels
[1:01:49] try to deceive them
[1:01:53] so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[1:01:56] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:01:59] out of my mouth
[1:02:02] because a Believer chooses to be
[1:02:05] lukewarm God chooses
[1:02:08] not
[1:02:11] to have them as bride
[1:02:16] he gets rid of them
[1:02:20] see we make the first choice
[1:02:23] it's okay whatever condition we're in is
[1:02:26] always okay
[1:02:29] what's the most important thing is when
[1:02:32] God speaks you say yes Lord
[1:02:35] and if he says get hot get cold
[1:02:37] I'm telling you think about it if you
[1:02:39] just turn cold from hot
[1:02:41] he'd be happier
[1:02:45] because lukewarm you've already made
[1:02:47] your decision and you don't know it
[1:02:49] that's why
[1:02:54] and and I'm speaking I believe
[1:02:58] from the holy spirit that it is not in
[1:03:01] none of our hearts to be legal lukewarm
[1:03:05] to be in a state of uncaring or
[1:03:08] departing from God but I'm speaking to
[1:03:11] the spirits that deceive us
[1:03:13] in making us think that we're okay
[1:03:17] in compromising
[1:03:24] you just can't keep pointing God will
[1:03:26] never leave us nor forsake us when we're
[1:03:29] the one leaving him
[1:03:33] just can't say Amen about being
[1:03:34] pre-decied to leave in a Rapture when
[1:03:37] we're not even preparing to leave in a
[1:03:40] rapture
[1:03:42] we're we're preparing to stay
[1:03:45] yeah we're saying amen we're going into
[1:03:48] rapture
[1:03:50] each time Jesus said he that have an ear
[1:03:53] let him hear what this spirit is saying
[1:03:55] to the church he was expecting them to
[1:03:59] turn around from their situation and
[1:04:01] start walking in truth
[1:04:04] every time he said it
[1:04:08] when the Church of Ephesus left their
[1:04:10] first love
[1:04:11] Revelations 2 5 he says remember
[1:04:13] therefore for once Thou Art Fallen
[1:04:17] and repent and do the first works
[1:04:21] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[1:04:24] and remove thy Candlestick out of his
[1:04:27] place except thou repent
[1:04:32] he's talking to the church he ain't
[1:04:34] talking to the world
[1:04:36] he's talking to a group of people who
[1:04:39] who love God first in their life at one
[1:04:42] time
[1:04:45] and then begin
[1:04:47] to defect switch sides
[1:04:49] to compromise and didn't realize it
[1:04:53] but he's letting him know return
[1:04:56] when the church and pergamists began to
[1:04:58] compromise and tolerate the wrong
[1:04:59] spirits
[1:05:01] in verse 16 he said repent or else I
[1:05:04] will come quickly and will fight against
[1:05:06] them with the sword of my mouth so he
[1:05:08] was wanting the church to turn around
[1:05:11] from their condition that's what the
[1:05:13] spirit is saying to the church and so
[1:05:16] that's what brother Branham was meeting
[1:05:18] him as we come to find out where we're
[1:05:19] at with God and when we find out
[1:05:21] wherever God is just an easy we just
[1:05:23] turn Friday
[1:05:25] isn't our whole life is bad it's just
[1:05:27] something he's dealing with
[1:05:29] me wants to say to work on that
[1:05:33] praise the Lord
[1:05:35] do you know what
[1:05:38] Jesus told the church to program us
[1:05:41] he said I have a few things against thee
[1:05:46] you know he told the Church of thyatira
[1:05:49] notwithstanding I have a few things
[1:05:51] against thee
[1:05:54] tolerating a compromising Doctrine
[1:05:59] mm-hmm it only takes a little
[1:06:01] compromising in our lives
[1:06:04] that God is against us
[1:06:08] even though we're his child
[1:06:10] even though we're his bride
[1:06:12] we can't do that
[1:06:14] see we're in the place of our building
[1:06:16] our territory because brother Ryan said
[1:06:19] that's the only thing we're taking with
[1:06:20] us
[1:06:21] so we come to church and we hear a
[1:06:23] strong word we hear things being spoken
[1:06:25] what's happening is it takes that strong
[1:06:28] word to build character
[1:06:30] because we have got to say I'm not going
[1:06:33] to do this in the middle of our trial
[1:06:34] that's where character is built
[1:06:37] instead of allowing the enemy to to to
[1:06:40] trick us
[1:06:41] a little 11 11th the whole lump
[1:06:45] remember apostasy isn't just leaving God
[1:06:47] but it's embracing
[1:06:49] sins
[1:06:50] embracing unbelief
[1:06:56] we can
[1:06:58] tolerate sometimes a compromising spirit
[1:07:03] true
[1:07:04] that it's okay
[1:07:06] in our lives now I'm speaking
[1:07:09] it's easy to
[1:07:10] to look at anybody
[1:07:13] and say this is your problem this is
[1:07:15] your problem this is what you need to
[1:07:17] fix
[1:07:18] you're compromising I'm not talking
[1:07:20] about that I'm not talking about us
[1:07:22] being judges of others
[1:07:24] I'm talking about us humbly judging
[1:07:26] ourselves
[1:07:29] that's something there's places that
[1:07:31] this the devil is trying to get us to
[1:07:33] compromise and that's just as much as
[1:07:35] just outright leaving God it's the
[1:07:38] beginning of leaving God
[1:07:41] right it's the same thing he says Jesus
[1:07:43] said you've heard whosoever uh
[1:07:46] committeth adultery is it should be
[1:07:49] stoned by saying to you that whosoever
[1:07:51] looketh upon a woman to lust effort is
[1:07:54] already committed adultery in his heart
[1:07:56] so he's taken this to the root of where
[1:07:59] it starts
[1:08:01] an apostasy starts with compromising
[1:08:06] an Open Door
[1:08:09] that he can get in and get you to become
[1:08:11] laxed lukewarm
[1:08:15] not hot not cold are you with me
[1:08:19] do you love me I love you amen amen all
[1:08:21] right we're just trying to get the devil
[1:08:23] out
[1:08:24] when God is dealing with someone
[1:08:26] something in their lives I say we don't
[1:08:29] want to take it lightly
[1:08:31] that's the Holy Spirit leading us into
[1:08:33] all truth
[1:08:35] and so the only way to move forward
[1:08:39] in Christ is is is not to stand still
[1:08:42] not to if you if you stand still you're
[1:08:45] going backwards because you you don't
[1:08:48] there is no standing still in Christ if
[1:08:49] I could say it like this you're you're
[1:08:51] either moving forward or going backwards
[1:08:53] you never remain the same when you come
[1:08:55] to church
[1:09:00] if you don't move forward
[1:09:02] by default you will begin to go
[1:09:04] backwards
[1:09:07] turn with me if you would to first
[1:09:08] Thessalonians chapter 2 the only way to
[1:09:11] remain alive unto the coming of the Lord
[1:09:13] is to remain moving forward with God
[1:09:18] I'll say Amen to that
[1:09:21] because if if somebody don't say Amen
[1:09:23] I'm going to read it again
[1:09:28] all right I just kind of want to bring
[1:09:31] everything I said now that I just said
[1:09:33] through the scriptures first
[1:09:35] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 19 and 20.
[1:09:38] for what is Our Hope or Joy or a crown
[1:09:42] or rejoicing are not even you in the
[1:09:46] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ at his
[1:09:49] coming
[1:09:51] for ye are our glory and our joy so now
[1:09:55] this this whole thing is talking about
[1:09:58] the coming of the Lord and he's talking
[1:10:01] about you you that that your change life
[1:10:04] your change nature you you turning
[1:10:07] around and saying I accept Christ as my
[1:10:10] savior yes that is our joy that is our
[1:10:12] whole that is our crown or rejoicing of
[1:10:15] rejoicing he says
[1:10:18] first chapter 3 verse 1 wherefore when
[1:10:20] ye would no longer forbear we thought it
[1:10:24] good to be left at Athens alone and sent
[1:10:26] to malthius our brother and minister of
[1:10:28] God and our fellow labor in the gospel
[1:10:30] of Christ to want to establish you now
[1:10:32] they're already saved
[1:10:34] and to comfort you concerning your faith
[1:10:36] that no man should move be moved by
[1:10:40] these afflictions for yourselves know
[1:10:42] that we are appointed there and two so
[1:10:44] just catching this that these men are
[1:10:47] saved
[1:10:48] there are we read in in chapter four
[1:10:52] they're going to be raptured they that
[1:10:54] are alive they're remaining unto the
[1:10:55] coming of the lord they're part of the
[1:10:57] elect group but I want you to see what
[1:11:00] Paul is TR is is having them do until it
[1:11:04] happens
[1:11:05] are you with me
[1:11:08] verse 4
[1:11:12] or verse verse oh yeah okay verily when
[1:11:15] we were with you we told you before that
[1:11:18] we would should suffer tribulation yes
[1:11:22] we all do even as it came to pass and
[1:11:24] you know for this cause when I could no
[1:11:27] longer forbear I sent to you to know
[1:11:30] your faith lest by some means the
[1:11:32] tempter have tempted you and our labor
[1:11:35] be in vain
[1:11:37] but now when timothius came from you
[1:11:40] unto us and brought us Good Tidings of
[1:11:42] your faith and charity that ye have uh
[1:11:45] good remembrance of us always Desiring
[1:11:48] greatly to see you as we also to see you
[1:11:51] therefore brethren
[1:11:53] we were comforted over you in all our
[1:11:56] afflictions and distresses by your faith
[1:12:00] you wanna
[1:12:01] Comfort somebody
[1:12:03] believe
[1:12:05] believe for them
[1:12:06] in all their distresses whatever is
[1:12:08] going on their afflictions believe for
[1:12:10] them that's a comfort to them
[1:12:12] for now we live
[1:12:16] if we stand fast in the Lord so here's
[1:12:19] our looks to me like a warning
[1:12:21] that there's there's no uh a once saved
[1:12:25] always saved do whatever you want
[1:12:27] for now we live talking about being
[1:12:30] alive and remain to the coming Lord if
[1:12:32] ye Stand Fast in the Lord
[1:12:35] for what things can we render to God
[1:12:37] again for you for all the joy we're with
[1:12:40] we joy for your sake before God before
[1:12:42] our God night and day praying extinctly
[1:12:45] that we might see your face and might
[1:12:48] perfect that which is lacking
[1:12:51] in your faith
[1:12:54] Viking
[1:12:56] well I I thought I'm gonna be saved I'm
[1:12:59] going in a Rapture and why do I have to
[1:13:01] be concerned about what's lacking
[1:13:06] I why I Think Jesus said to the church
[1:13:12] there's a few things that have against
[1:13:14] me
[1:13:16] there's a few things what do you tell
[1:13:17] the the Rich Young Ruler that that kept
[1:13:21] all the Commandments
[1:13:23] one thing they'll like us
[1:13:25] God is interested in the things that we
[1:13:28] don't think about
[1:13:29] that's where he's at
[1:13:31] that's why when we hear the word and it
[1:13:33] seems like brother John that doesn't
[1:13:35] help me that doesn't come for me well
[1:13:37] I'll tell you it didn't help the Rich
[1:13:39] Young Ruler either he walked away
[1:13:40] sorrowful right
[1:13:45] but we got to deal with it because he's
[1:13:48] bringing us to perfection
[1:13:51] and and Paul is speaking here that uh
[1:13:55] he's praying exceedingly that we that
[1:13:58] that we might see your face and might
[1:14:01] perfect that which is lacking in your
[1:14:06] faith
[1:14:07] no God himself and our father and our
[1:14:10] Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto
[1:14:13] you and the Lord make you to increase
[1:14:15] and to Bound in love one towards another
[1:14:18] and towards all men even is we do
[1:14:22] towards you
[1:14:23] what
[1:14:25] what I gotta increase more aren't you
[1:14:28] satisfied I gotta bow more love what's
[1:14:31] wrong with my love
[1:14:33] ain't it good enough
[1:14:36] and I got to do it towards all men that
[1:14:39] means my enemies
[1:14:42] right oh what what is this gospel saying
[1:14:44] I thought I'm just we which are alive
[1:14:46] and remain are going
[1:14:49] God is calling us to a place
[1:14:53] he's calling us higher than where we're
[1:14:55] at
[1:14:57] verse 13 to the end he may establish
[1:15:02] your hearts unbelievable in Holiness
[1:15:06] before God even our father at the coming
[1:15:09] of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his
[1:15:11] Saints see this whole thing is pointing
[1:15:14] us to them which are alive and remain
[1:15:17] unto the coming Lord shall be caught up
[1:15:19] but we have a job to do till then
[1:15:23] and that means when we can look at
[1:15:25] ourselves and say you know what I'm not
[1:15:27] there
[1:15:29] I had a thought I shouldn't had
[1:15:31] and I dwelt on that too long
[1:15:34] in fact I carried that the next day
[1:15:37] when the love of God thinketh no evil
[1:15:40] when I had these little things start
[1:15:42] coming out of my mouth when the person
[1:15:45] wasn't there
[1:15:46] that I said about
[1:15:48] I mean come on we think everybody does
[1:15:50] it and it's okay it ain't okay
[1:15:52] right it ain't okay because if somebody
[1:15:55] as soon as somebody hears about it it's
[1:15:58] going to put a a it's gonna
[1:16:04] God is calling us to be alive
[1:16:11] not to keep our heart beaten
[1:16:14] right not to be on some life support
[1:16:18] he's wanting the spirit to be alive
[1:16:21] inside of us to be dealing with things
[1:16:23] to know to learn how to deal with life
[1:16:27] because if we don't
[1:16:30] that Devil's going to get so many people
[1:16:32] to compromise and Fall Away
[1:16:38] furthermore
[1:16:40] oh am I verse chapter 4. furthermore
[1:16:44] then when we beseech you Brethren exhort
[1:16:47] you that by our Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:16:50] as ye have received of us how ye ought
[1:16:52] to walk
[1:16:54] and to please God
[1:16:57] so ye would abound more and more so they
[1:16:59] went to church and they hear they had to
[1:17:01] do it more and more too
[1:17:03] foreign
[1:17:04] I thought you know Paul had been handing
[1:17:07] out the compliments that day
[1:17:09] he says no I want you to I want you to
[1:17:11] Bow more in walking more pleasing to God
[1:17:17] for ye know what Commandments we gave
[1:17:19] you by our lord Jesus for this is the
[1:17:22] will of God even your sanctification
[1:17:24] that you should abstain from fornication
[1:17:28] that every one of you should know how to
[1:17:30] possess his vessel and sanctification
[1:17:32] and honor not the lust of uh
[1:17:35] a longing desire even as the Gentiles
[1:17:38] which know not God that no man go beyond
[1:17:41] and defraud his his own brother
[1:17:45] you know we have a tendency of just
[1:17:47] overreaching
[1:17:50] instead of just praying with them
[1:17:53] in any manner in any manner because that
[1:17:56] the Lord is the Avenger of all such as
[1:17:59] we also have forewarned and test and
[1:18:02] forewarned you and testified for God
[1:18:04] have not called us unto uncleanness but
[1:18:07] unto Holiness there's many ways that we
[1:18:10] can be unclean you know just unclean
[1:18:12] things can come out of our mouth
[1:18:14] and I'm not just talking foul language
[1:18:18] I'm saying little things that we just
[1:18:21] try to give a dig a little dig
[1:18:25] I'm going to send this message
[1:18:28] that's unclean
[1:18:30] is that right
[1:18:33] and he's called us to go beyond that
[1:18:38] he therefore that despiseth despiseth
[1:18:40] not man but God he's actually doing it
[1:18:43] to God he don't know it because he's not
[1:18:46] walking in the spirit right
[1:18:48] who have also given us his holy spirit
[1:18:52] think about that God has given us his
[1:18:55] Spirit but we're not
[1:18:56] yielding to it amen amen but his
[1:18:59] touching brotherly love you need not
[1:19:01] that I write unto you for yourselves are
[1:19:03] taught of God to love one another
[1:19:06] and indeed you do it to all Brethren
[1:19:08] which are in Macedonia
[1:19:10] oh praise God
[1:19:13] let's put a period on that and go home
[1:19:16] that's not what Paul did did he he says
[1:19:18] but we beseech you Brethren that you
[1:19:21] increase more and more
[1:19:24] what a message the holy spirit is
[1:19:27] getting across to the church
[1:19:29] to stay alive in other words to remain
[1:19:32] growing to remain abounding more and
[1:19:35] more in the love of God in other words
[1:19:37] when you come to church next month
[1:19:40] there should be more love in your heart
[1:19:42] seen by everybody
[1:19:44] there should be less isms less schisms
[1:19:47] less talking about other people behind
[1:19:49] people's back there needs to be a
[1:19:51] growing in Christ
[1:19:54] somebody's got to believe this word
[1:19:56] don't stand around waiting for the whole
[1:19:58] church to become what you think it needs
[1:20:00] to be you become what the word says you
[1:20:03] may be the only one brother bear said
[1:20:04] they're only one in that City you make
[1:20:06] sure you're that one
[1:20:10] it's got to be real to us
[1:20:13] verse 11 and that ye study to be quiet
[1:20:18] there's a message in that line I'll tell
[1:20:20] you
[1:20:21] and to do your own business
[1:20:24] don't be a busybody
[1:20:25] and to work with your own hands
[1:20:28] as we commanded you
[1:20:31] and that that ye may walk honestly
[1:20:34] toward them that are without
[1:20:36] and that ye may have lack
[1:20:38] of nothing you serve a God who supplyeth
[1:20:42] all of your needs
[1:20:45] he's not a God that's sometimes hits it
[1:20:48] and sometimes don't
[1:20:51] if anything is lacking in my life
[1:20:55] it's because of me
[1:20:58] it's not because of God he is faithful
[1:21:00] to his word
[1:21:01] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[1:21:04] Brethren concerning them which are
[1:21:06] asleep that ye sorrow not even as others
[1:21:09] which have no hope
[1:21:10] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:21:13] rose again even so them which sleep in
[1:21:15] Jesus will God bring with him
[1:21:19] but we know in that statement not that
[1:21:22] everybody died
[1:21:24] is bride right
[1:21:26] there was bride in every age
[1:21:29] but only
[1:21:31] the elect
[1:21:34] only the bride
[1:21:37] is going to rule and Reign a thousand
[1:21:39] years right sit with him on the throne
[1:21:41] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:21:43] the Lord that we which are alive amen I
[1:21:47] like that quickened
[1:21:49] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[1:21:52] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:21:54] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:21:56] heaven with a shout that's the message
[1:21:58] of the hour the voice of the Archangel
[1:22:00] that's Christ and the trumpet of God
[1:22:02] shall uh the trumpet of God and the dead
[1:22:06] in Christ shall rise first there's a an
[1:22:09] announcement to the marriage supper amen
[1:22:11] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:22:15] be caught up together with them in the
[1:22:17] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:22:19] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:22:21] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[1:22:23] words
[1:22:24] there
[1:22:26] this is should be this is what we should
[1:22:29] be under expectation
[1:22:31] we should be right with the prophet amen
[1:22:33] amen if we were in the prophets uh
[1:22:36] meeting and he spoke these words I feel
[1:22:38] that that is where the church should be
[1:22:40] under expectation of the coming of the
[1:22:42] Lord because it is so easy to get to
[1:22:45] drift back in in a uh laodicea spirit
[1:22:48] where you're just kind of in your own
[1:22:50] life doing your own thing going your own
[1:22:52] places and we really need to share that
[1:22:54] burden of of getting Souls into Christ
[1:22:56] while we have an opportunity
[1:22:59] what an embarrassing thing it's going to
[1:23:01] be to stand before the Lord and know
[1:23:03] that we wasted our time
[1:23:05] come on
[1:23:09] I don't say that because I'm against you
[1:23:11] I say that because I'm your brother
[1:23:14] this is where I need to be this is where
[1:23:17] we need to be amen
[1:23:19] the only way to remain unto the coming
[1:23:23] of the Lord is to remain alive in his
[1:23:25] word
[1:23:26] to keep moving forward with Christ to
[1:23:28] keep growing higher and higher in
[1:23:31] increasing more and more and abounding
[1:23:34] in his love more and more in loving more
[1:23:36] and be able to look back from last month
[1:23:38] last week however you wanted to say it
[1:23:41] and you see that there's a spiritual
[1:23:42] growth taking place in your life
[1:23:45] not of knowledge
[1:23:47] not had learned more
[1:23:50] but I'm living it more
[1:23:52] I'm living it more it's just happening
[1:23:54] I'm giving my life away
[1:23:57] that's what needs to transpire that's
[1:23:59] how you know you're alive
[1:24:03] and if you're in that state when he when
[1:24:05] he comes I'm telling you you're going to
[1:24:06] go up
[1:24:09] praise the Lord don't stay idle
[1:24:12] don't focus on what you've done what
[1:24:14] you've achieved
[1:24:16] I like that brother Brandon's laying in
[1:24:18] his bath his hands folded behind his
[1:24:20] bounties thing if I'm going to do
[1:24:21] anything for the Lord I better do it
[1:24:23] quick he wasn't staring at the hundreds
[1:24:25] or or millions of people that he is
[1:24:27] saved
[1:24:29] he was looking forward
[1:24:31] he was looking at what he had with his
[1:24:33] life
[1:24:35] and he think we need to forget the
[1:24:37] victories which are behind us now
[1:24:39] and press towards press towards for more
[1:24:43] this is God's message
[1:24:45] to the church
[1:24:47] he that have ears to hear Let Him hear
[1:24:49] what the spirit is saying
[1:24:54] after Paul told the Philippian Church
[1:24:56] First Corinthians 1 6. you don't turn
[1:24:58] there but you've heard it being
[1:25:00] confident of this very thing
[1:25:02] that he which had begun a good work in
[1:25:04] you will perform until the day of Jesus
[1:25:06] Christ we all love that scripture
[1:25:08] but look what happens three verses later
[1:25:12] he says in this I pray that your love
[1:25:14] may abound yet more
[1:25:17] and more
[1:25:19] in knowledge
[1:25:21] and in all judgment
[1:25:23] I'll tell you if there's something
[1:25:24] missing in our judgment is love
[1:25:30] too often we judge Without Love
[1:25:32] and that's it's just totally unrighteous
[1:25:37] that ye may approve things which are
[1:25:39] excellent
[1:25:40] and that you may be sincere without
[1:25:41] offense without offense
[1:25:45] sincere and without offense to the day
[1:25:49] of Christ
[1:25:52] that that's a that's a that's a lot to
[1:25:54] live
[1:25:56] come on
[1:25:58] being filled with the fruits of the
[1:26:00] spirit
[1:26:01] which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory
[1:26:03] and praise of our God I believe to
[1:26:06] remain in Christ we need to grow more
[1:26:09] and more abound more and more and just
[1:26:11] keep his love growing amen
[1:26:16] Jesus told us to abide or to remain in
[1:26:19] his love and you can read about it and
[1:26:22] uh John 15 when you get time but in this
[1:26:25] age the love of many is waxing cold
[1:26:28] we think that it don't affect us but the
[1:26:31] spirit you know we may have came out of
[1:26:33] laodicea
[1:26:35] but I'm telling you that spirit is all
[1:26:37] around us
[1:26:38] sometimes we bring it into the church
[1:26:40] right right sometimes we can't even
[1:26:42] enter his Gates properly
[1:26:43] come on
[1:26:46] Jesus said he that abideth in me and I
[1:26:48] and him the same bringeth forth much
[1:26:50] fruit
[1:26:52] Karen is my father glorify that ye bear
[1:26:56] much fruit so shall he be my disciples
[1:27:00] and in verse 16 he says you have not
[1:27:02] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[1:27:03] ordained you that you should go forth
[1:27:05] and bring forth fruit
[1:27:07] and that your fruit should remain
[1:27:12] now you know what happens when you take
[1:27:17] an apple
[1:27:19] or pear or peach or a banana and you let
[1:27:24] it remain on the counter too long
[1:27:29] you don't want it
[1:27:32] that's not the remaining
[1:27:34] that Jesus is looking for
[1:27:37] he wants us to keep bearing the fruit
[1:27:39] amen fresh fruit
[1:27:43] that whatsoever you asking the father in
[1:27:45] my father's name he will give it to you
[1:27:47] these things I command you that you love
[1:27:50] one and I believe that fruit has to do
[1:27:52] with his love I believe that
[1:27:56] walking forward in the love of God
[1:28:00] in the hardest age requires a continuous
[1:28:03] dine out to the flesh
[1:28:07] don't try walking a Christian walk
[1:28:09] without denying yourself
[1:28:11] you'll never be successful our flesh
[1:28:13] will always Savor us or entertain the
[1:28:16] things that belong to our first nature
[1:28:18] it's never changing it's never changing
[1:28:23] we're changing but the flesh never
[1:28:24] changes
[1:28:26] the mind of the flesh will always
[1:28:28] exercise the things that belong to our
[1:28:31] first nature that's why it has to be
[1:28:33] crucified you can't give an inch it'll
[1:28:35] take a mile
[1:28:36] you take a moment say I just want to
[1:28:38] look at that just one that before you
[1:28:40] know it you're looking at it longer
[1:28:44] that's just the way the flesh is it's
[1:28:46] not you it's the flesh
[1:28:50] if we don't keep dying out to the flesh
[1:28:52] how can we give God Liberty to use us
[1:28:55] for his kingdom amen
[1:28:58] amen how can we remain alive unto the
[1:29:00] coming of the Lord
[1:29:02] look at Balaam he never thought he left
[1:29:04] God
[1:29:07] no sir I'll only say what God tells me
[1:29:10] to say you can't curse
[1:29:13] something that God has blessed
[1:29:16] speaking the word he never thought he
[1:29:18] left God
[1:29:21] he never thought he was going into
[1:29:23] apostasy
[1:29:24] defecting switching sides
[1:29:27] but he got too weak and what did he do
[1:29:30] he began to compromise
[1:29:33] which is the other form of apostasy
[1:29:39] he was unwilling to keep his flesh
[1:29:41] crucified
[1:29:42] and if you don't keep your flesh
[1:29:44] crucified you will backslide and that's
[1:29:46] exactly what he did
[1:29:50] and he was a prophet of God
[1:29:52] he was much higher than me
[1:29:55] and if he could backslide where does
[1:29:57] that put me
[1:29:58] are you with me
[1:30:00] this is a this is a real a real thing to
[1:30:03] be alive is alive
[1:30:06] too often we use God
[1:30:09] and the Liberty he's given us for
[1:30:11] ourself
[1:30:13] and that's not what he gave it for for
[1:30:14] our desires and our flesh Galatians 5 13
[1:30:17] and I'm trying to hurry so the more that
[1:30:19] you get into this word the more I'll
[1:30:21] hurry
[1:30:22] for Brethren you have been called unto
[1:30:25] Liberty only used not Liberty for
[1:30:27] occasion of the flesh well what am I
[1:30:29] supposed to do with it then serve me
[1:30:34] serve one another
[1:30:38] what are you doing with your Liberty
[1:30:40] who are you serving
[1:30:42] Oh Brother John you know I I just I'm so
[1:30:44] bad I got I don't know but
[1:30:47] hey don't defect from this truth
[1:30:50] stay with the word get back to it turn
[1:30:53] around and get back to it you think it's
[1:30:55] not that big a thing but that's because
[1:30:57] you've been so far away from the Lord
[1:30:59] you don't hear his voice you don't you
[1:31:01] don't catch it when he's speaking to you
[1:31:04] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:31:07] even this thou shall love thy neighbor
[1:31:08] as thyself
[1:31:10] man let's start practicing that around
[1:31:12] here
[1:31:13] let's start practicing it
[1:31:15] give a little bit more than you want to
[1:31:17] give say something nicer than you
[1:31:19] usually want to say Don't just walk out
[1:31:21] so much into yourself that you don't
[1:31:23] care about others that ain't Christ
[1:31:27] he says but if ye bite and devour one
[1:31:30] another take heed that ye be not
[1:31:32] consumed one of another
[1:31:34] great man this I say then walk in the
[1:31:38] spirit and it'll take care of everything
[1:31:40] and you shall not fulfill that lust
[1:31:43] of dividing and devouring one another
[1:31:47] for the flesh lusteth that the spirit
[1:31:49] and the spirit after the Flesh and these
[1:31:51] are contrary once in the so that you
[1:31:52] cannot do the things that you would
[1:31:54] we must stay in sync with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:58] in order to successfully walk in harmony
[1:32:00] with the Holy Ghost we must learn to
[1:32:02] separate the two spirits that are in us
[1:32:04] let's just get real there's two of them
[1:32:05] in US
[1:32:06] there's two Natures that are constantly
[1:32:08] at bat with one another and if we don't
[1:32:11] learn to call them out
[1:32:14] if we never learn them we're always
[1:32:16] thinking we're just doing the right
[1:32:17] thing every man's right in his own eyes
[1:32:20] we must recognize the two Spirits
[1:32:22] constantly
[1:32:23] and if we fail to do that we'll be
[1:32:25] blinded by the wrong spirit and begin we
[1:32:28] won't we won't have a problem saying
[1:32:29] these things it won't even bother us
[1:32:31] get to a point what was true
[1:32:34] is right
[1:32:35] they deserve it and don't even feel the
[1:32:39] conviction
[1:32:41] that's why we gotta understand what's
[1:32:44] happening
[1:32:46] if we don't continue to crucify our
[1:32:49] flesh we'll end up walking in it
[1:32:51] will become judgmental
[1:32:54] lawyers
[1:32:56] judges
[1:32:58] sentencing our own brothers and sisters
[1:33:00] to hurt
[1:33:02] becoming spiritual cannibals biting and
[1:33:05] devouring
[1:33:08] not even recognizing what's going on
[1:33:12] blinded by our pride
[1:33:15] we need to Humble ourselves under the
[1:33:17] mighty hand of God
[1:33:18] serve one another
[1:33:20] remain crucify your flesh that's how you
[1:33:24] remain alive in Christ Romans 8 chapter
[1:33:27] or chapter Romans 8 verse 10 I'm trying
[1:33:30] to hurry see my wife back there
[1:33:33] that means that's like hanging up a big
[1:33:35] sign services needs to be ending
[1:33:39] not really
[1:33:41] he wouldn't do that to me
[1:33:43] listen
[1:33:46] until I get to the restaurant
[1:33:50] all right and if Christ being you the
[1:33:54] body is dead
[1:33:56] because of sin
[1:33:59] but the spirit is life because of
[1:34:01] righteousness
[1:34:03] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:34:04] Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[1:34:06] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:34:08] shall also Quicken
[1:34:11] make alive your mortal bodies by his
[1:34:14] spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:34:17] and this is why you you hear the word of
[1:34:19] God and it's being preached and you
[1:34:21] think it doesn't mean very much because
[1:34:23] it's kind of minor compared to your
[1:34:24] relationship with Christ it's not that
[1:34:27] way
[1:34:28] because that word is Christ and when you
[1:34:31] you make light of this particular
[1:34:33] message that God's trying to get across
[1:34:35] you you're making light of your
[1:34:36] relationship with God
[1:34:39] so when you receive the word
[1:34:41] that Holy Spirit the life of that word
[1:34:44] now becomes manifested inside of you it
[1:34:47] is simply a saint Lord I believe that
[1:34:49] word I believe that you speaking that's
[1:34:51] you speaking to me now the spirit will
[1:34:53] Quicken you
[1:34:55] don't wait for the quickening before you
[1:34:57] start saying I'm a Believer
[1:34:59] believe the word as it's preached and it
[1:35:01] will be quickened to you
[1:35:05] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:35:08] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[1:35:11] we live after the flesh ye shall die
[1:35:12] there it is but if he through the spirit
[1:35:15] do mortify the Deeds of the body you
[1:35:18] shall live see it's a continual process
[1:35:20] until the coming of the Lord
[1:35:23] for as many as beloved of the spirit of
[1:35:25] God they are the sons of God remain
[1:35:27] walking in the Holy Spirit amen and you
[1:35:31] will be alive unto the coming of the
[1:35:34] Lord
[1:35:35] walk humbly
[1:35:36] keep a abounding in his love more
[1:35:39] increase daily keep moving forward
[1:35:43] not knowledge not just popping on a tape
[1:35:49] but to where just one word God spoke to
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:53] and you're you're starting to follow it
[1:35:56] that's where life comes from
[1:35:59] and this
[1:36:00] this may seem strong to some and I don't
[1:36:03] mean to make as songs sound strong or be
[1:36:06] strong to you but this let me just tell
[1:36:08] you where this burden is at
[1:36:12] there are so many people that are
[1:36:14] falling away
[1:36:16] some we see and some don't even realize
[1:36:19] what's happening
[1:36:21] and I know there's a lot of terrible
[1:36:22] things in the world
[1:36:24] but I'm concerned about our souls I'm
[1:36:28] concerned about those that are are are
[1:36:31] going backwards instead of forwards
[1:36:34] I mean I think we should be hearing more
[1:36:36] testimonies I believe the love of God
[1:36:38] has shed abroad My Heart by the Holy
[1:36:40] Ghost and I'm loving more than I ever
[1:36:41] have in my life I think we need to hear
[1:36:43] testimonies like that that by nature is
[1:36:46] changing I'm able to handle situations
[1:36:49] without blowing up
[1:36:50] without creating another problem
[1:36:54] I mean God is still alive and he needs
[1:36:57] to be alive in us and this is a
[1:36:59] beautiful opportunity for us to take
[1:37:01] God's word amen and grow
[1:37:05] last scripture First Corinthians 15
[1:37:07] verse 58.
[1:37:09] therefore my beloved brethren
[1:37:12] be he steadfast unmovable
[1:37:15] always abounding in the work of the Lord
