that you're doing right now in the midst of each person's life we love you and thank you lord jesus christ and we pray amen brother john would like to up amen amen uh how many's uh wondering what i'm doing here one two three four five how come the rest of you aren't you know voting well we have asked brother johnson to come and minister for us she may be seated just a moment yes um we're going to ask him to come i i'm thinking that he's sees me in the room or hears me but we want to welcome him yes when you read chapter 11 in the book of hebrews we hear about all the patriarchs of the old testament and i believe that brother johnson is a patriot of the new testament of this century that we're in and none of us have uh the full scope of what this patriarch has done for the kingdom of god but i say with all my heart that we are privileged to have him amongst us and um like all of us we're human but is god in us the hope of glory and i'm just so grateful to have come under brother johnson's ministry and to learn the importance of having a right spirit over the right doctor because it was lived in our brother and um we just want him to take his his liberty and i want to i want to learn i want to grow i want to become another uh another higher up in in the lord you know what i'm trying to say so um how many is going to pull the word amen i believe the word is hid in his heart and if we just help pull the word out i believe it'll feed our soul and give us what we're looking for because we're not looking to the man to feed us we're looking to the god in the man to feed us and it's the same god lives the same god that lives in you lives in me and lives in one another just different portions right amen so uh god bless our sister so good to have her and um back when we miss him when they're not here and um we're just gonna ask our our brother johnson to come forward let's just sing um only believe only believe as our brother comes to minister oh only believe let's stand together now only believe things are possible [Music] what i believe [Music] oh [Music] let's look to the lord again in the word of prayer heavenly father we feel so grateful for the privilege to be here with this congregation tonight and stand in this position but lord i can't feed them you must do that i give myself to you let the word of the lord come forth lord fully and completely and may you come and anoint the word so we'll understand the word in the precious and wonderful name of jesus amen now i don't know uh is everyone hearing me okay maybe i should say is there anyone that can't hear me properly all right that's good i won't need to have that then praise the lord all right you may be seated let's turn in our bible hallelujah amen all right let's turn to the 12th chapter of the book of exodus i did want to say that brother martin has been fair kind and he's always just giving out roses and and it's been so nice to have brother bruce be a chauffeur for me uh he came and offered that what a blessing special nights like tonight and uh they're gonna be working on the road but uh uh and i was so happy to see brother larry again he's been showing up pretty often we really miss him when he's not here uh brother larry has quite a testimony of how one little track he had the address to the church in an arbor and he read it but he he held on to it for 40 years before looking up the church but that encouraged me for we have sent millions of tracks out by the help of the brothers in ann arbor and uh so that just encourages me uh the word will not return voice it will accomplish that to which it is sent so just remember that amen and uh it's good when you're going to the store to town just to pray a little prayer lord let me be able to testify to someone amen because you just don't want to try to stop everybody on the isle but yet it's such a blessing to get to tell someone about the lord and it won't return void and we'll be happy when we get over there amen we'll be happy all right i'm going to turn in the bible now and and read uh from the book of exodus chapter 12. i had it marked but that's okay the word of god hadn't changed and it'll still be in chapter 12. although this was probably this was probably recorded uh well it was spoken by moses way back before israel came out all right amen so if if anyone cannot hear me you have my liberty to just put that a little closer amen all right we got one saying he thinks it'd be good so uh oh that's that's even better hey man the lord said he would supply every need amen and so he's doing that all right now you can hear me better way back in the back amen and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb foreign house and if the high soul be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his leading shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish do you know why sure you do because it was a type of the lamb of god that took away the sins of the world it had to be a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening you may be seated and i just don't want to keep you standing too long but i love i love this story hey man it's such a story and uh notice it was to be the this month he said shall be unto you the beginning of months now the reason i believe to them it was the beginning of months remember god had already told abraham that israel would be under bondage for 400 years is that right but actually they were there for 403 you know the the critics sure do like to make out like god didn't know what he was what he was saying or he missed it no he didn't miss it joseph had saved their lives and the lives of all of his loved ones jacob's family so it was gonna be a a new a new month a new life a new liberty a new victory and a new walk a walk they had never made before amen so ah it's the first month i like that and he said you just speak to the congregation to take the lamb out of the flock from out of the goats or out of the sheep of course the lamb would have to come from the sheep amen but they were usually in one great area and was watched over by the family and so it was on the 14th day of the month that this lamb was to be slain why 40 days because it was to be the 10th day they were to pick out that lamb but the 14th day because it had to be inspected they had to be sure there was no blemish nothing wrong with it if it had a broken leg it wasn't it wouldn't be ready because remember in jesus body not one bone was to be broken amen and even this lamb they were not to break one bone in its body because it's a perfect type of the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the lamb of the lord he said your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year if you'll notice uh probably you've seen pictures of little little lambs little goats little horses that are bored and when they first are born they sure seem very unstable they just you know but as soon as their mother can have time to start licking with the tub amen cleaned it up and so that little fella though if you see him about six months later i'll tell you what you'll be running circles around the mama all around showing his his his love of liberty the love of being able to do something he had never been able to do before amen i believe god makes them that way amen amen and they shall take of the blood it says that they shadowed the 14th day and they shall strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses where they shall eat it notice they they had to eat the lamb in the house where the blood was supplied amen when you when you partake of the bread and the wine or the supper of the lord or the breaking of bread whatever you call it amen it's it has to be eaten in a clean house the houses are qualified till the blood is supplied now the israelites didn't want it they they knew that israel was putting blood on their doorposts they never asked for it except there might have been a few that are called mixed multitude oh god help us never to be mixed up neither in or out you know all the way just you know kind of in between help us lord brother john's been giving us some good lessons and a lot of scriptures of how the lord wants us to grow in grace and in knowledge of the son of god real good advice and that's why we're here that's why we come amen to be fed to the word of god amen and god is trying to help us let's let's listen carefully if something you know something is spoken that you don't understand write a question and talk to brother the preacher uh brother john or if there's someone else uh this feasting if i say anything to you that mixes you up tonight i would i'd be happy for you to to ask me before i leave you now i'm just going to take my time and that's the reason i wanted you to sit down because you'll be able hopefully to grasp and i didn't feel quite right to be setting out and you stand it out amen in fact i didn't like preaching set down and i still don't have quite the liberty of the voice but i found where jesus told peter bring your boat and when he brought the boat pete jesus got in the boat he went out a little ways in the shore he spoke to thousands of people there because he didn't need a microphone because water is a reflector of the voice and so the lord knew that because he made it that way he knew that someday he'd be preaching on the water hallelujah amen and if you hadn't been to the water you know all you need to do is just take care that you ask him to take your sins away amen and meet it from your heart and show that you meet it by being faithful in prayer and that's one thing all of us all of us need to do more the lord's been talking to me about it i hope i can just spend more time in prayer all right listen eat he said now they shall eat the flesh in the night roast with fire unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it amen would you come to eat the word leaven is a type of false doctrine if you remember when jesus said to the disciples beware of the leaven of the pharisees he was referring to their doctrine be worse amen so it's a type of of a misunderstood word or a type of disobedience to the word that we know is written in the scriptures you know many years ago when my first son was born and you know after a while they grow up and they have to go to school and so he had been going to school a week till he come he would come home for lunch he had to run almost a mile not quite maybe and uh so anyway he came in just patting and blowing and said hey what's happening oh he said two boys threatened to beat me up he said i just outrun him amen i said we're not gonna talk about it before you eat we're going to eat first then we're going to go talk to the lord about it so we eaten and i finally said let's go and have a little prayer in the living room and a scripture while i'm praying came to me i don't know how long it had been i don't remember ever preaching on that scripture but it's a good scripture if all of thy ways please the lord he'll make even thy enemies to be at peace with you boy i love i love the answer and so i told john what the answer was i said john maybe you haven't been too friendly maybe you need to kind of lighten up a little bit be a little nicer i said tell you what if somebody needs a pencil even one of those boys give him one of yours if he needs one piece of paper give him two amen and so and so i didn't hear anything about two weeks passed i said uh sean what about the the two boys boys said one of them's my best friend i said what happened he said well he needed a piece of paper and i give him two and he said now he's my best friend see he i didn't i didn't know the little fella would need some paper but the lord knew amen the lord knows ahead of time exactly what's going to happen but i've thought about that and you know sometimes some some people don't want your friendship but you can you can act nice don't don't become stuck up you're not the first one that somebody's turned their nose up amen but i've always been told if you turn your nose up and it rains you might get too much water amen all right i'm going to try to hurry he said now he said he did not raw nor satan at all with water brother john mead taught me that he said you know when you you take meat home after you hunt don't don't put a lot of water on it and that's he said but roasting with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinents thereof when i come to the word perturbance i thought i knew what it meant and so i have a little bible at home that that brother mother colin fisher gave me it's a jerusalem bible so i said i wonder you know what they so they they used the word intrus well we understand that for sure but that's what i thought it was i had never looked it up but uh anyway if you see a word you don't understand write it down check it out amen uh quite often i think of something i appreciate it brother brother martin's message separating in the bible the word love comes from two words in the greek and both of them are loved but they're not the same kind of love he tried to show us the difference but the video love is love i have for my wife love that i have for all of you and love for the people of god that's trying to serve god and trying my best to love my enemies amen because the holy spirit and one way you can tell when you really truly love someone that's really treated you're wrong and that's what you pray for when you pray for lay not the sin to their charge i want to just tell one little thing that happened to me many years ago it's a testimony i haven't mentioned it quite a while but one night you know i had moved to california and pastored there for two and a half years and uh so when i came back it was actually i came back in 63. this was in january of 65 so i hadn't heard from them i really had written too many letters to them i did get one letter from one little sister that got so mad at me and she come up for prayer there was about five people that come up and the whole it seemed like something said don't lay hands on her and so i took a little walk around on the platform i i wanted to hear that a little a little plater he said don't lay hand shoulder so i said lord please help me you help me to know what i can say to her because she's gonna be upset she was one of our best friends and so uh i said sister you want to be here yes that's why i'm here i said go pay your vows and it'll be all right oh the way she walked back to her seat i i knew she wasn't happy you know people do have a way of letting you know when they aren't happy and so anyway i went in talked to the lord because i knew there'd be a phone call coming and so i told her exactly what the lord told me after he told me i even remember hearing her pray one time and i heard her pray help me doctor gossip anymore and i thought that's a good prayer amen you know we all could use that amen and so anyway i prayed for her and about a week pass maybe two weeks i got a phone call and it was my little widdle sister who was a widow and she was in her 60s i would think and so ah i got a phone call brother johnson which you come i'll be right there i was waiting for that i mean i didn't waste no time and she said the sun was shining it was such a lovely temperature in l.a and said she had never felt better in her life and all of a sudden she just lost all strength and fell to the ground and the first one she thought about was me she should have been thinking about jesus but she called me right away and we had a prayer meeting and uh after i got back here i got a letter from her saying i'm so glad you did what you did because i wasn't ready to meet the lord but i've made my peace with the lord now thank you thank you for being honest with me and so the lord knows just how to do it amen i'm going to try to be heard hurry up thus shall you eat it with your loins skirted your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand hey did you come prepared all of you to i'm glad i got mine because you know your staff in your head anyway i'm not i'm not wanting you to have to have one of those they they really they really get in your way and they're always trying to walk without me if i lean it on something it'll fall you know all right but you shall eat it with your loins skirted i want you to notice the four things i believe he beats and sure loin skirted shoes on your feet staff in your hand you shall eat it in haste ah when you come to eat the word hey be bold i don't don't listen just part of the time try to you know mark those scriptures because they'll help you but i in other words they had to be ready for a journey to a promised land and that's what we have to do we've got to stay ready we don't know what day what hour we don't uh one time i mentioned brother branham had said something about 77 and uh i thought man that would be something if god would tell him but i i spoke it one time the holy spirit said don't put no date on it and i thanked him a lot of churches lost about half of their congregation when he didn't come in 77 so i told the lord i'm not putting no date brother branham i thought he'd give us a good little uh lesson when he said live for him like he's coming today work for him like you got 40 more years amen you know that's good advice real good all right so be ready to travel because actually that very night they they left out of the land that very night of the passover in fact the egyptians begged them to go get out of here even pharaoh said hey take your cattle take take everything you need to make your sacrifices but get out of here but god knew that he would change his mind but it never stopped the children of israel but for five seconds maybe just long enough for moses to say stand you still and see the salvation of the lord amen when you can't move it's always safe to stand still amen then have a little prayer meeting they had looked the pillar of fire moved from before them and stood between them behind israel so that they they could not see the egyptians neither could the egyptians but it was where israel could still see the light how to walk amen they were able to walk in the light but not for the egyptians oh i tell you god just he knows how to help the believer for he said i passed through the land of egypt this night i'll spite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast have you noticed that the beasts also he said and against all the gods of egypt hallelujah you know god god knows how to take care of them gods amen one time they brought one into the philistines god and set him in front of their god and their god lost his fell on the floor so they stuck him together put him back in there and the next time he broke they didn't try that again hey amen all right and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the pledge shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt when i see the blood oh hallelujah and that's what he has to give every one of us amen and this day shall be unto you a memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations and you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever amen amen now i want to mention that we learned by the prophet there's three ordinances that brother branham said and one of them is to break the bread break the bread one of his foot washing and the other one was marriage is that right marriage amen some of you are looking at me like you're not sure well you look it up correct me because i take correction i learned long ago if i say anything contrary to the prophet just go ahead and say it right i don't have to repent amen if i don't know what to say i just won't say nothing but the reason this means so much to me this subject is the passover was just the beginning and the ending was in the new testament and jesus eat it with his disciples just before he was crucified amen so it was it was the start and it wasn't the finish now when i was a little fella uh my dad thought that he had maybe found scriptures that he didn't he didn't think he needed to take the literal bread and the wine well number one we couldn't buy wine in there in the town that we lived in not even in the county so anyway anyway one day i told my wife i said brother brenham taught serpent seat he was right i was wrong i didn't understand it he taught evidence of the holy ghost he was right he taught the the everything that the new testament church had is available for the believers today everything amen without any faith so i said i'm going to go and head for the woods you can pray in the woods and you might hear the squirrel spark at you but it seems like heaven says amen amen isn't it good to get an answer just keep praying amen if you haven't got the answer that's okay just keep praying amen so i headed for the for the wilderness uh we had rented a campground for our first camp meeting before we went to christ lake and so anyway they gave me a bed just i told her what i was going to do and they said just go right ahead it won't cost you anything so i went there for two days but the third day they were coming in to clean the whole place and the rooms and i didn't i didn't want to be [Music] in a lot of traffic among a lot of people so i just got in my car and drove over to sac rider hill does everybody know where secretary hill is you know where grassland is well if you turn south instead of toward christ's lake within a mile there'll be a park in space there and there'll be an old path going up to an old rugged cross and it's big and it's tall so i thought that'd be a good place i've never found anybody up there when i went but i know there's other people to visit it so i took an old blanket threw it on the grass that was about this tall just knelt toward the cross and as soon as i knelt i felt a little breeze you know what i'd wondered how brother brother knew but i'll tell you when it's him you'll know you'll know and as soon as that breeze came in and i began to weep and while i'm winking i heard a voice inside what does that remind you of i said oh lord it reminds me of your death on calvary for my sins and the sins of the whole world amen and i said lord that piece of wood can't save me and that's true that piece of wood there couldn't save me but it sure happened and so and so the lord you know i just said lord i i have taught the people your word takes the preference over everything show it to me in the book and we'll cover that we'll cover that cause i gotta hurry i'm not gonna i don't wanna i all right i'm going to turn you over to the 12th chapter verse 32. also take your flocks and your herbs as ye have said and be gone and bless me also he that was when pharaoh called moses can you imagine pharaoh finally won a blessing from moses he had run him off a they threatened to kill him but he decided to find his way to another country and there he found his bride amen a gentile bride that's amazing in it amen he said the egyptians were urged upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men [Music] hallelujah they became believers i'm going to skip all the way to 46 in chapter 12 of exodus in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall you break a bone thereof amen that's a prophecy because of the messiah amen amen our bone was to be broken amen hallelujah well now i better just i could say a lot but i'm just going to take you over i'm going to take you over to first corinthians chapter 10. and so if somebody's putting it on the board some of you might not have your bible but i'm taking you to first corinthians amen paul's first letter as far as we know hallelujah does everybody find it i've got a marker but you don't have to find it except i want you to be able in the in the 10th chapter first i want to read that this is this is a little help to understand the spiritual way that we partake of the lord in the spirit moreover brethren i would not that she should be ignorant how that all of our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ and i'm wonderful but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lustered neither be your idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and shriek and rose up to play you remember that's when aaron had took the gold and and they made a golden calf neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand lord deliver all of your children everywhere neither let us step christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye that's good advice as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all of these things happen unto them for in samples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come now in the 11th chapter where i got mixed up you see i couldn't understand it says in verse 18 of the 11th chapter for first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lord's supper and if you go to strong's concordance it just says you cannot eat the lord's supper the reason is the lord's already eat his supper and the disciples when he did he served them he said but i want to here's a spiritual lesson for us for in eating everyone taketh before other his own supper one was hungry another's drunken oh my what have you not houses to eat and to drink it or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say unto you shall i praise you in this i praise you not so when i said lord show it to me in the scriptures he told me to come in this book and start reading right there for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was portrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heat this is my body which is broken for you amen this is my body which is broken for you hallelujah he said take heat this is my body which is broken for you this do ye in remembrance of me then the holy spirit just stopped me right there and said to me what are you going to stop partaking of the lord spiritually the lord i hope never because my eternal life depends on my eternal relationship with you now he said read the rest amen so after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this to ye i said how long are you going to stop take it particularly spiritually i said lord i don't ever stop but notice here he said this do you as soft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come amen hallelujah i'm going to go just a little further wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord so you need to start praying and keep praying all the time that if there's anything between you and him get it all out of the way amen because you're going to find out the reason why he said let a man examine himself now the devil would like to have you examine everybody else don't let him get you into that examine himself so let him eat of that bread let him drink of that cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and tricketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause listen to this many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep to get out of fellowship with one another is dangerous to get out of fellowship with the lord is very dangerous for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged amen but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home so we we don't come to eat to feel a hunger on the breaking of bread amen see he said let him eat at home that she come not together under condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come i wish we had that business meet but i believe this is sufficient amen it's important i'm going to show you now god told moses if israel doesn't take the 11th bread and keep the passover he is not he is not to be called an israelite anymore amen think of that and if they eat leaven now as far as i know the best bread in the whole world is right here it's not mixed with any false doctrine but it does warn you there will be false prophets amen hey let your roots go downward let your arms stay up amen love the lord with all your heart amen and get ready for it for brother john's already told us it's gonna be pretty soon amen and so i'm gonna try to close some time is there anyone here tonight that you've been praying about a certain thing just just lift your hand amen all right now heavenly father here we are in your presence here we are having feasted on some things from the old testament some thinks from the new testament and they're both true they both applied at a certain time for certain people but by your grace you have crafted a sin that we might be children of the kingdom the same kingdom of god that israel's going to be a part of you have different plans for both of us perhaps but the main thing all of us want eternity with you credit lord if there's any anything in our heart against any brother just let us have the courage and the faith to pray for that brother until there's no bitterness in our heart whatsoever and the lord will take it away and may god bless you and if you need the holy ghost hey make it known hallelujah just let's really pray for naomi's husband his name is tim is that right jimmy so let's remember him in prayer i i felt i was so glad several come and prayed with him and before i left he came back and slept by me and i had a little prayer meeting with him and there was tears so i believe he really is meaning business just pray for him that god will fill him full of that spirit very soon god bless you thank you brother john amen [Applause] that word was so timely there was so many things i was could be said um and wish uh they they could have been said because they're all good and edifying the the story that you had about uh forgiving you know showing the difference between uh affiliate love and agape love lay not this into their charge and just so many wonderful stories but um getting into um the importance of communion that will be taken and the reverence and to make sure that our hearts um are are right before the lord um when we when we think so often we allow little thoughts and feelings and things to to be there thinking it's not that big a difference and in reality it is it is because when jesus makes this statement that he will not forgive us if we don't forgive one another and and in all honesty i know that there's a big bullseye on me because i'm up here all the time i say things and i'm not perfect and decisions have to be made and they're not always perfect um so it is it is easy um to um to get in trouble uh but we we need to uh bear one another pray for one another love one another uh and and uh sometimes we just got to love covers a multitude of sin and that has to prevail that has to prevail because if you think about it our relationship with the lord it always ends with this if it wasn't for the grace of god i wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the love of god i wouldn't be here and so it is an honor for the lord to be inside of us doing the same thing one to another just loving one another beyond reasoning or understanding but just the holy ghost loving others through you amen let's sing um when i uh see the blood um i do we know that one okay when i see the blood amen amen amen christ our redeemer died on the cross died for the sin paid
