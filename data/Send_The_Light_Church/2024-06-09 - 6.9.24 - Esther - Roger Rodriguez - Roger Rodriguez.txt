am amen I believe the holy spirit is here to feed us amen and when any man is Anointed by the Holy Ghost and you've come for the purpose of being fed God will always make sure that he has a word for you now sometimes we just have to pay attention to the whole Service uh and that's my best advice is listen from one end to the other and you'll leave here fed spiritually and uh you'll be able to be strengthened for what purpose to stand against the Ws of the the enemy amen because he's trying to keep us uh keep us from all getting to Heaven amen I really appreciate that worship service and what a privilege it is for us to come and gather together so good to see sister Debbie and brother Charlie with us in the B God bless you both amen and it's good to have brother Bill Sanchez again amen we we were blessed to have him just a little bit ago and uh we're just thankful for him his friendship over the years and his steadfastness for the Lord he loves the Lord Jesus loves to help his people and our special speaker today brother Roger Rodriguez um from uh two places originally from Venezuela but he's been living in Tennessee and uh he's got a good memory um he knows when he was at the other church he knows when he was here last and um he's been praying just like you have for the service today and it's we were praying for probably a few months this was in the works for a while and I believe something special is going to happen today just I believe that and God bless our our wonderful Holland family amen God bless you we heard you had wonderful Services amen yesterday and they had two services in Holland yesterday um all Spanish no interpreting it was it was like they were like in heaven there and and you know I say God bless them for every time they come here and they struggle to hear the word um may God just bless you is our sincere prayer amen well we're just going to welcome our Brothers to come forward let's sing only believe as they come to give us the word of life amen only believe only believe all things [Music] only God bless you you may the Lord keep you I'm really happy to be here with you once again and to see you as a people of God it was about two years ago that I was here with you and you had just bought the building and I can see you renovated pretty good and I'm really happy because of that and it shows the love that you have for the work of God amen amen so I'm real happy I'm tired we had two Services yesterday one in the afternoon at 1 and one at 6 but we had a special time with Fellowship around the word and around the Chinese food and around the word of God again and the brother was talking to us about shrimp so we're going to try to prepare some shrimp with different seasonings may God keep you and we're going to directly to the word then we're going to go to the Book of Esther he didn't give me this scripture I'll just read I'll just Esther chapter 1 and verse uh 29 and verse 19 I was really happy yesterday with the brothers and sisters from [Music] Holland I was very moved when we were there before the service uh singing to see all those young uh men brothers where you know there's young people young men that are trying to go into the world and uh just getting away from the from the gospel but there's a group of young men that are seeking of God so I very I was very happy yesterday because my work in Venezuela I worked with the youth we had about 100 youth there and you know at the age of 11 and and and 20 so it was a because this was a big church I went to so when I got there to that uh youth meetings yes so it was two grandpas talking to young people because I'm a grandpa I've been a grandpa now for four months and it's a very different experience I have a little granddaughter she's uh half Spanish and have American my son married a a American sister he always liked them blonde that he was a young [Music] man and she always like the the Hispanic so they when they saw each other was L at First Sight and two years later they got married and two years after they got married now we have a little beautiful granddaughter we're very happy and now he knows what that is so we're gonna read we're going to read from Esther chapter 1 and verse 19 before we we read the word we're going to go to the author of the word and pray Lord Jesus we grateful for your presence and your your how good that you are to us we need your your that you accompany us today so we give our lives to you and now we put our own being aside and you can use us any way that you wish to we want to speak what you want us to speak so be with us Lord there's a people here that are hungry and we want to be the waiters this morning we want you to be the chef you fix something already in the kitchen so we're bringing it from the kitchen to their table in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you Lord sorry we're GNA read this verse and Esther we know when King hasah heris we know that he was a great king he was in the med he between the media and the Persians and he made a great feast and he made his f for many days and in the six days in that or number seventh day he was very happy the wine made him very happy so he sent for his Queen Queen he called for his Queen to show him to his other his princesses and he wanted to show her off to the governors now the queen vashti she didn't want to come to the presence of the king [Music] so the king stopped her for being Queen so when we read verse 19 now we know that there was a federal order from the government now verse 19 says but but it seems good to the king make a Royal Decree and write it between the the writings of Persia so it will not be broken the Vash will not come anymore before the king and that the king will make a Queen instead of Vy another queen amen may be seated we know that this is the story of that [Music] Kingdom now when you read the book of [Music] Esther is it like brings you to curiosity because the the the book is has a certain point Amen in between the historical books and the poetic books and it's right in the middle of that now we're speaking about a queen okay two queens a queen which was beautiful she had greatness because the King was very uh proud of Vash because he wanted to bring her to show her off in front of the other Governors because he saw her his wife or the queen very perfect he saw her very beautiful because she was a representation of the Kingdom like a a a royal reality now you can imagine that Queen and your own mind goes to the universe or beyond the world and those beautiful places and that you find in today you know Miss Miss Universe and Miss World yeah Miss Universe and Miss World because those certain Beauties those those uh computations of [Music] beauty will bring us to that point in this story here that the King was showing off his Queen so you in your mind you say wa she was a beautiful woman and a woman that was very well prepared and perhaps when when she would speak she would had good character perhaps she was she just didn't have a pretty face perhaps she had preparations of uh uh Beauty perhaps she was very educated she had degrees she was just not any kind of woman because when she would speak she would she would represent his King her King she would demonstrate what the King was and what the kingdom was so they called for her to come she did not want to come so there you saw that she had a little spot a little fault she thought she was bigger than the king [Music] she she was trying to demonstrate that she was higher high higher up let him wait for me I'm busy I'm in my own way I don't want to go I woke up [Laughter] grumpy so she didn't want to come before the king now if we see the story very well we know that she was very busy too because she was having she was having Banquets and and feast because she was having Feast for King for the other uh queens and and and princess of the governors so she was also attending the feminine part of the of the feast know that she was busy you know when our wives are busy at home and you want to bring her some kind of news you know what happens I don't even have to tell you you know what happens my wife is busy doing something fixing and cooking and you want to come and bring in a joke or something and you're going to get yelled at that's going to be the way it is because she's busy so they're thinking about organiz organizing this taking care of this if you went and and make groceries and you brought boxes of food she's taking care of put them in the cabinets put in the new things in the in the back and the things that are older to the front and fixing the refrigerator and you come and you want to tell hey I want to I want to change uh cars she doesn't want to hear nothing about you changing cars she wants you to help or put away groceries and that's the way this queen was so the king sent for V perhaps she was she was uh organizing the Banquets and didn't care of this those that were serving she did not want to come to the presence of the king because she wasn't willing to now we know that the king went to to get another queen amen now we come to this very solemn point she's put away [Music] so now the king starts like a trying get himself a new wife perhap someone that have all the characteristics of vashti did not have that effect that Vash demonstrated that she would be willing to come to the presence of the king any time that he would ask for her so the the king started seeking he sent Messengers all over the kingdom hey the king is looking for a new Queen and there was Messengers all over we're looking a new for a new Queen for the king if you find find yourself in a good condition come so there was a a organized a group of those that were going to take care of them so they were going to bring these virgins they were candidates to be a queen and they were going to bring it to to a specific place to begin to train them and to tell them how the king likes things done so that training began to happen so these men they were selected these men were picked specially these men could not have their Unix they couldn't have their own seed they were picked physically they were not able to touch these virgins these men will come and and present to them the spirit of the king and the way that the king acted the way that he was and what the king liked and how the king likes things to be done they were going to show them how the king would like them to to act or you know behave themselves they were going to teach them how to dress before the king and the way that that she walked before the king and how the king liked the way they cooked and how the king liked the way they for them to do things it was a training they were going to go through so they had to take care of them and they had to uh give him beauty treatments and to get him ready in in every aspect she was going to be the queen she was going to be the most important woman in the Kingdom months went by during that training so now we know here comes Esther she was of the descendants of [Music] Israel and we know that the kingdom ofer was not Israelites it was a gentile Kingdom there was paganism there they believed in all kind of different uh customs [Music] so she had to be trained so she can please the king so we know that she was very beautiful and as beautiful as vashi but she was not trained so this Unix they were training this woman they were doing this work and today we know that there's Unix that are doing that work today in the churches the pastors they are doing the work the the the work of a unic they're transmitting to the chosen of God because God's been choosing a bride so he can he can uh be be engaged to God wants to get [Applause] married with a a a lady that's very well trained by the Unix so we have Unix behind this Pulpit they're trying to teach you to teach his girl look what God wants them to do now remember the Unix in the Old Testament they were they were modified so they would not have seed of their own they could not plant in that girl their seed because they didn't have any so we need that the Unix of today do not plant your own seed but for that BR that girl that's chosen by God that lady that God is showing through the Unix so she can be prepared for a wedding am today the Lord is Seeking a bride the Lord wants to get married but we know that this bride is very particular because this bride she's going to demonstrate a certain being or way that she is that no other candidate has there's many candidates because Esther had to compete with many thousands can you imagine thousands of women beautiful young virgins wanted to be Queen and that was a lot of work for the Unix how would that that move movement must have been give him food to the women all the time where to sleep where to bathe don't where to get them ready and how to they had to learn how to walk before the king and even learn how to comb their own [Music] hair they had to learn to do their own things so we have a God that's preparing a group of Unix they are doing that kind of a work today it's a logically it's a spiritual work [Music] we got men that have good caliber and doing the work of preparation and doing the work of a unic but sometimes you know that someone gets behind sometimes and sometime there was one that was not a unic and get in there and he finished having a scandal bringing a problem there was a notice that came out he put a seed that he was supposed to put because that process of months because that young woman the chosen one the one that would come to the to the end of the competition had would had to be proven proven in all aspects she could not bring a hidden seed from somebody else because months would go by that she would not be get pregnant in hiding so they haven't they haven't they haven't enclosed nobody could get to them perhaps that the Lord hasn't come yet waiting for his bride is chosen and P and sealed and not bring and bring the wrong seed she's not supposed to bring for it that the Bible says when the husband was coming in late all the virgins fell asleep and that's going to happen and perhaps it's happening today but there's some Unix they're always watching don't fall asleep wake up oh your eyes are closing oh look at look the the the husband he he's coming put your ear hear the call because there going to be a trumpet coming sounding and you can hear the wheels uh turning be ready and the Bri and all the virgins are tired and the Unix are hitting them trying to wake them up hey hey wake up don't don't don't don't lose your step stay in step and that is the work of the Unix to keep those virgins alert so they can go into the into into the the wedding but you know what the most beautiful thing is seeing that the process of election is being given they're still seeking new girls or [Music] Maids perhaps you heard oh that message God wants somebody to marry the the husband is looking for a wife perhaps you you felt that call in your heart and perhaps you put breaks some for a minute but today is a good day to hear the call and to accept that invitation because Lord still looking for someone to marry we are in that process seeking preparation election because the Lord because the Lord wants to see his people and his people are his bride we we we speak in type because the people of God is the bride and the bride that the Lord is in is training and yet that people are uniting because there are virgins that are waking up and the people of God keep growing until that last one comes in the bride is not going to be completed and when she's completed it's when the bridegroom comes the election of the Bride it doesn't give it doesn't come at the end not until all the girls are well trained and there come a time when the Unix and the the the main principal Prince of the Unix and he would come to the king and said hey everything's ready all the girls are already well trained they know everything and we T we taught them everything you want us to teach them so that now is the final election the election so the one that had the last word was the king now the king came forward and started looking at them perhaps he saw them walking oh perhaps you seen him praying and looking at their Bible and reading so the King was the one that's going to change uh get his bride the queen perhaps the the king had many wives but to him there was one special one which would be the queen and so this morning we're speaking to that special one that chosen one which is the only one and she's the only one that's going to take that place on the throne the king yeras he wanted you to come and dress with that chronis Splender she didn't want to come we know there's a special Crown when she's going to present herself before the king when she's in her daily activities she has she wears another type of crown but when she comes in the presence of the king she has to use the main crown and the King wanted to present her with that crown and that would show that Crown would show that she was the the the the the queen of the king no one else could wear that that crown and that Crown was not uh made late before it was personalized they would they would come and measure her head with the form of her skull once they placed that crown on her head she couldn't walk around holding on the to the crown it had to be placed just right she had to walk and that Crown could not move to any to any side because it had to be a personalized especially made for her that woman amen now today the Lord knows who his wife is and he's making he's making that personalizing that Crown he's personing that Crown himself the day will come of the coronation and that beloved of his will be there and that act well they're place that Crown our head and there we will be we're going to be that Queen chosen of God and that Crown is going to fit on head perfectly and it's going to appear in the head of that bride because the Lord got her already Chosen and they just preparing the final details and preparing the adornments on the dresses year before that it was just like a a natural comp competition that is a a spiritual competition a spiritual [Music] competition before before they would put all kinds of you know perfumes and all kinds of things on them they would fix their hair and their nails but today it's a spiritual application because God the Lord is preparing the character that bride or that chosen Queen and that's what we're doing today in that final run race of details oh the dress needs a little Stone here oh look there's a little thread hanging so those small details those little final touches now you know when when someone the sculptures the the uh the work of art they take a giant piece of marble and they start they start hitting and knocking out pieces of that marble and they start with big chisels and now once that marble starts taking form now you they're using the smaller chisels smaller ones and more delicate because it's giv form to the little smaller details let's say they're making the the face of of of a man and they they're you looking at their wrinkles well they can't use a big chisel to do that so he can cut off the nose so they're using very uh small details little small tools and perhaps maybe something out of rubber and perhaps maybe a little piece like nails and those little final details so we can compare this final bride like a like a masterpiece that is been uh finishing the work has been finishing so now we see this culture we saw this scultpture we see the artist and making those final details some people have seen the statue of Moses they see even the the the veins popping out of Moses's arm and they see the wrinkles when they make this they see the statue of David Mel but you see that in that statue there are very many fine details even the the the drops of sweat up here because they see all little detail you can even see the the ve like if you if you would stand there in front you alive that's why Michelangelo hit that the knee and says speak because he saw that before so [Music] perfect and he his and he hit that knee and in that moment our greatest sculpture is with us and he's making those final details for us because he wants to see us in Perfection be you perfect even as your father is perfect and we know that we're not in that perfection oh we see we see ourselves so twisted and we see ourselves with so much so many defects but when the Lord sees you he doesn't see you as you see yourself he see you through different to some different lens and that lens is the blood of Jesus so he through those he see you through those red lens sees you perfect he doesn't see that you have any stain he doesn't see any wrinkles because that blood is standing before you that and and having made the Lord see you perfect and that was the the value of the sacrifice at Calvary at the cross but better than that sacrifice was the resurrection that mon that Sunday morning the resurrection marked it's like when you go to a store and you take the receipt that you bought something you take it back to the store and we know that the the payment was made at Calvary like when you pay when you pay your uh a bill by internet I'm GNA pay online but I'm going to go pickup so you pay pay online you receive the receipt on your telephone so you go where you go where you paid could be Walmart could be Sam's Club you go with your receipt and that Sunday in the morning that the Lord Jesus came with the receipt and he reclaimed us you are mine and I'm going to perfect you and I want to do in them what I want to do in them come un next and train this girl this girl for me and teach her what I like and show her the manual of uh norm and process you know like those that have a let's say you go to to a a workshop you have preparations and they teach you not to go to certain places in that building and the signs and warnings in that building so you have a theoretical preparation first so they take you to the place you're going to work then you remember there's a yellow line here I I I can't step here oh there there's a channel here I I can't pass there or somebody will hit me with a with a tow truck somebody might hit you so we have a a theoretical process we come here to receive preparation theoretically now when we go outside in that in the street here we're receiving burdens not like when we receiving a charge right now when you take two batteries right and you know the batteries got full charged but the battery has to be recharged and you had to put it on use so when we go outside those doors our real preparation starts we want to see if the theory was right we go out there was a stop sign I did it I didn't make he didn't make the Stop and I take I open my window say hey you didn't stop what's the matter with you I failed that I I failed the first teaching and now we go to the street that happens at at your job site a boss you have boss is mean or or or a fellow worker that has it with you or or one that's jealous at you and you had to deal with that and even your own neighbors because we have we live in a in a a country with a lot of respect you have your neighbor the neighbor knows where your line of property is and you know where your property is he's a good neighbor as long as you don't cross over his property because people are inside their home but they're looking outside what's going on too they're in Tennessee I don't I'm not talking about Michigan i w talking about I'm talking about Tennessee yeah very conservative state in Tennessee they fought the Civil War if you put place your foot in somebody else's property and you look at the at their window and there's a rifle pointing at you and that happens in Tennessee you got to be very careful those that make deliveries and not go to the wrong house because they can take the take the boxes to the wrong house and it's not I somebody come out with a weapon what are you doing here it's it's it's it's strange so you have to be very careful to revise everything when you go out the house so you can be sure because you have to uh respect somebody else's property I don't know why I went that way there we're putting in practice what we saw here we have to be very careful with others respect them to respect one another the scripture said to do things right and not to break the law of men someone's going to break them what are you going to do when somebody breaks a law against you you're G to go fight them you're going to shoot them or you're going to forgive them don't worry go on forward no problem and sometimes in supermarkets they go with their little shopping cart and they and hit the other person with a shopping cart I'm tall and and they've hit my little C too oh no it's okay take it easy fine no problem what if I start a a battle with them and somebody's watching me what kind of fruit am I producing why do I follow the gospel if I go on the street and fight with people I got to be different because the word that I'm listening to is changing me it has to change me because a supernatural word and the word changes from inside out because it's something very [Music] different we're a lady or we're a chosen people we are the chosen of God Esther she could not be the same as the other ones she couldn't she had to be special right she could not be like vashy they were looking for somebody that better than VY the king had had a had a queen before and now he's seeking one that's better than the other one and this one has to give much better fruit and better characteristics better character and better all and better way to administer the things that God gives her very different and be a blessing to everyone else and to help others because she's bigger she's greater she has a higher position and and and John seen that and John says I saw the bride she was coming down out of Heaven the heaven of Jerusalem and it was a city coming down and she looked like a bride Adorn as a bride for her husband perfect no no stain or wrinkles and that's what is is showing to us in this age God is want us Perfection look us people that are very imperfect and God is saying to you no you're going to be perfect that's why we need we need the Unix and we know we need the the the the Manual of of of of procedures andali so we are in training oh no I'm afraid of the Gospel it's very he ask too much of me I'm GNA be bored and we're more happy than anybody else because we have understood many things many people look for happiness because they're empty and look for things in like in uh drinking or whatever but we we're happy and we're filled that way we have to give the Lord says for us to give what we have to teach to give us today we can say that we are that tree in the garden of there was a tree people come to eat of that tree we are that tree in this age people come hungry people come with habits people come with chains chains of Oppression they're going to come here because they want a little bit of what you got because that's different you look different you act different you're like an you're like an oasis to the people that come around you people are thirsting you're the Oasis for them your house should be full of your neighbors because your neighbors are going to see something in you that's very different oh when I talk to that lady or that man I feel so good my soul is so happy I heard some preaching uh these these days and it was called the the next door the next door Christian it talks about how uh the preacher talks about a neighbor for years he was his neighbor and everybody in town thought that that man was in drugs or or in dealings in Bad Business no one knew about that neighbor or his family no one knew about them so that preacher his dad died and all the people in that in that town came to show forth their you know their condolence you know 20 years of a neighbor and so that that supe that suspicious neighbor he came to pay condolence so found out that he was a Christian he was a preacher no one knew there they found out that he was a Christian never had no contact with other neighbors they didn't even know his name I don't believe you're like that I believe that you people in your neighborhood see something different about you I believe so something different is about you or they see your always a there's a blessing in that house I believe it that's talking about Tennessee not here I don't know how high it is over here Venezuela is like that too no they don't do like that or Michigan they don't do that like that and that's what we have today God is asking of us a higher position he sent to us a different message [Music] Esther had someone that would help her prepare there was not among the Unix and she would follow the counseling of that person and that was her uncle the uncle would tell Esther things that he would not tell to the other virgin Esther the king would see her different someone they someone talk to her ear oh look look my daughter the king is this and this and that and those were secret messages so she can prepare herself and the other one didn't have that Uncle so Esther was selected the queen that was elected and that that filled the heart of that King so much she pleased him so much even more than uh vashi pleased him so when Esther had problems we know that the the story is very long so I got my my phone my my watch has uh Tennessee hour so to me it's only 10 o00 over there today they woke me up with the the hour in California and now I got the hour Tennessee so I cannot talk about the whole story some stories were beautiful which actually gives an account of what's going on today but that Queen Esther she had a problem and she did something that should have she shouldn't have done she came before the presence of the king without being called and she came so so uh given up so so beaten she was willing to die for the problem that she had amen and we we have that Liberty to come into the presence of the Lord any time we don't have no problems not only in those moments 24 hours anytime we can come before his presence and sometimes we're wasting that that opportunity to to come and present yourself the throne is open why don't you come there's going to come a day you want to come before the throne and you're not going to be able to bash was called she didn't want to come Esther went because she had a need and she was accepted what need that you have today what need that you have bring it to the king and the king is going to help you and the king is going to open doors for you and he's going to he's going to extend his his the scepter and give you an opportunity to live if someone would come in without being called and he extend acceptor that person would die but today the scepter is extended come and and and touch the scepter and receive the benefit in front of the king amen God bless youu [Applause] he tells us to come boldly he had an uncle a good uncle I think that Uncle probably whispered to Esther do not add anything to what the Chamberlain said because all the other ladies added something more than what the chamberlains told but Esther was the only one that stayed with the word we've been given a pure word of God take away and he wants us to come as we are anyone who wants to spend some time Before the Throne you want someone to pray our brothers will pray with you amen let's sing he's coming soon he's coming soon H okay that's that's a good time to play it in these CL of time what Joy the Glorious hope of that soon oh wondrous Tru sublim he shall reign king of kings and Lord of Lord he's coming soon he's coming soon with joy we welcome his [Music] return it may be mourn it may be night or noon we know he's coming soon the signs around in Earth and heav or painted on the Starlet Sky God's faithful Witnesses declare that the coming of the Savior draweth not he's coming soon he's coming soon with joy we welcome his return it may be more it may me night
