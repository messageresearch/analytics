[34:42] for we need you every day
[34:45] bless Thy word now Lord as we give you
[34:47] praise and honor wait furtherance on
[34:49] thee in Jesus Christ and we pray amen
[34:53] amen we're going to start reading here
[34:56] in verse number 17 and this is when Paul
[35:00] is coming back uh uh from his he
[35:05] preached the gospel a lot and he was
[35:08] coming to the the Elders of Ephesus the
[35:11] most uh spiritual church if I could say
[35:14] uh and this is the message that he that
[35:18] he has and starting with verse number 17
[35:20] I hope you have your Bibles with you
[35:21] amen amen and from uh maltus he sent to
[35:27] Ephesus and called
[35:29] the Elders of the church
[35:31] and when they were come to him he said
[35:34] unto them ye know from the first day
[35:36] that I came on into Asia after what
[35:40] matter I have been with you at all
[35:44] seasons notice he's he's the same person
[35:47] winter spring summer and fall
[35:50] serving the Lord with all humility of
[35:53] mine
[35:54] amen with many tears and temptations
[35:57] which he befell me which befell me by
[36:01] the lane and weight of the Jews
[36:04] and how I kept back nothing that was
[36:07] profitable unto you
[36:09] but have showed you
[36:11] and have taught you publicly
[36:14] and from house to house
[36:16] testifying both to the Jews and also to
[36:19] the Greeks repentance towards God and
[36:21] Faith toward the lord Jesus Christ and
[36:24] now behold I go Bound in the spirit
[36:29] unto Jerusalem
[36:31] not knowing the things that shall befall
[36:33] me there
[36:34] say that the Holy Spirit witnessed in
[36:36] every city saying that bonds and
[36:40] afflictions abide me
[36:43] well that would just kind of make me
[36:45] want to avoid going there
[36:48] but none of these things move me
[36:50] neither count I my life dear unto myself
[36:53] so that I might finish my course with
[36:56] joy in the ministry which I have
[36:59] received of the Lord Jesus to testify
[37:01] the gospel of the grace of God
[37:03] and now behold I I know that ye all
[37:07] among whom
[37:09] and now behold I know that that ye all
[37:13] among whom I have gone preaching the
[37:16] kingdom of God shall see my face no more
[37:20] wherefore I take you to record this day
[37:23] that I am pure
[37:25] from the blood of all men in other words
[37:29] he said it all for I have not Shone to
[37:33] declare unto you all the god counsel of
[37:38] God
[37:39] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[37:42] to all the flock over which the Holy
[37:44] Ghost have made you overseers to feed
[37:46] the Church of God which he hath
[37:48] purchased with his own blood
[37:51] for I know this that after my departing
[37:53] shall grieve his wolves enter in the
[37:55] among you and Sperry not the flock also
[37:58] of your own self shall men rise speak in
[38:00] perverse things to draw away disciples
[38:03] after them therefore watch and remember
[38:05] that by the space of three years I cease
[38:08] not to warn every one night and day with
[38:11] tears and now they're now Brethren I
[38:14] commend you to God
[38:16] and to the word of his grace which is
[38:18] able to build you up and to give you an
[38:20] inheritance among all them which are
[38:21] sanctified
[38:23] I have coveted no man's silver or gold
[38:26] or apparel yea yourselves know that
[38:30] these hands have ministered unto my
[38:32] necessities and to them that were with
[38:36] me
[38:37] I have showed you all things
[38:40] how that Soul laboring you ought to
[38:43] support the weak
[38:45] to remember the words of Our Lord the
[38:47] Lord Jesus how he said it is more
[38:50] blessed to give
[38:51] than to receive
[38:53] and when he had thus spoken he kneeled
[38:57] down and prayed
[38:58] with them all
[39:01] and they all wept Shore and fell on
[39:03] Paul's neck and kissed him souring most
[39:06] of all for The Words which he spake that
[39:08] they should see his face no more and
[39:11] they accompanied with him unto the ship
[39:15] amen I want to take our text from verse
[39:19] number 27 for I have not Shone to
[39:24] declare unto you
[39:26] all the counsel of God Amen God bless
[39:30] you may be seated this morning
[39:34] how many appreciate the Lord Jesus in
[39:36] your life
[39:37] man where would we be without him
[39:42] for a little subject we want to talk
[39:44] about our Tendencies to shun part of the
[39:46] part of the word
[39:49] now we're going to say some things that
[39:52] obviously are not for you
[39:56] they may be for somebody else
[39:59] so
[40:01] where the shoe fits you wear it and
[40:03] where it don't fit you can't wear it
[40:05] right
[40:06] right right so
[40:10] um we're just thankful for every part of
[40:12] the word that God has revealed to us and
[40:16] that we're living
[40:18] and that we're declaring
[40:21] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[40:23] David forever he's alive
[40:25] he still lives in the heart of his
[40:27] people there are people that believe the
[40:28] gospel from cover to cover amen
[40:31] but we've all been guilty of shunning
[40:33] part of the Gospel when someone has
[40:35] spoken it to us
[40:37] amen our flesh is enmity with the spirit
[40:41] of the Gospel the Bible tells us it it
[40:44] doesn't want to die out
[40:46] and there's usually something that God
[40:48] is dealing with all of us with in our
[40:50] lives because it's the job of the Holy
[40:53] Spirit to lead and guide our character
[40:56] into all truth
[40:58] not just leading God or lives or make
[41:02] sure we're into the correct Doctrine
[41:04] but the holy spirit is leading our soul
[41:07] into having the proper characters that
[41:10] we might be in the image of God
[41:13] one of the greatest parts of the Gospel
[41:15] that a lot of men shun is when Jesus
[41:18] declares that
[41:21] a a major part of us has to leave in
[41:25] order to have a personal walk with him
[41:26] and that's basically our will amen
[41:29] we have got to uh basically hate or love
[41:33] less everybody on the planet even our
[41:36] own family members
[41:37] and and put him first or we can't be his
[41:40] disciple amen we we we got the Bible
[41:44] Jesus said even hate our own lives
[41:49] amen and and
[41:50] um we we got a bear own pick up our
[41:54] cross
[41:55] or we we can't have this personal
[41:57] relationship with him and yet our our
[42:00] life our body is always looking uh for
[42:03] another way to have a relationship with
[42:05] God and still hold on to the things that
[42:07] we want to but we can't make a Rapture
[42:10] with shunning part of the Gospel
[42:13] if Jesus spoke it it's required of us
[42:17] the Bible says that the word of God is
[42:20] forever settled in heaven it cannot
[42:23] change no more than God can change
[42:26] the Locust the word Jesus Christ we're
[42:29] taught is the same yesterday today and
[42:31] forever
[42:33] and since God cannot lie that means the
[42:35] word
[42:36] cannot lie
[42:39] the word can't fail
[42:41] Jesus can't fail it will never return
[42:45] void whatever God has spoken it will
[42:48] come to pass
[42:50] we can say from cover to cover this is
[42:54] the whole Council of God
[42:56] there's nothing missing in it it is
[43:00] given to us that we may know that we
[43:02] have eternal life
[43:05] it is given to us so we know how to live
[43:07] by amen amen Paul told Timothy in second
[43:10] Timothy that the scriptures are able to
[43:13] make thee wise onto salvation through
[43:16] faith you got to have faith and you got
[43:18] to believe it
[43:20] that all scripture is given by the
[43:22] inspiration of God and it is profitable
[43:25] we all want profit don't we
[43:27] you don't ever invest in something
[43:29] without hoping to get profit for it yes
[43:31] you wouldn't invest in it all scripture
[43:34] is given by the inspiration of God and
[43:36] it is profitable for a Doctrine for
[43:38] reproof for correction for instruction
[43:41] and righteousness that the man of God
[43:43] may be perfect
[43:45] right amen not a dead statue but
[43:49] thoroughly furnished onto all good works
[43:54] it's not just for us to know
[43:56] is for us to do good works by
[43:59] Jesus said for man shall not live by
[44:01] bread alone but by every word that
[44:03] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[44:05] it is the whole Council of God in
[44:08] Revelations chapter 22 verse 19 says I
[44:12] want you to read this with me that's why
[44:13] it's up on the board if any man shall
[44:15] take away from the words of the book of
[44:17] this prophecy God shall take away his
[44:20] part of the book of life and out of the
[44:22] holy city and from the things which are
[44:24] written in this book amen we don't want
[44:27] to take anything away amen
[44:30] but that's not only it look at Verse 18
[44:32] for I testify unto every man they
[44:34] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[44:35] this book If any man shall add his ideas
[44:38] his thoughts his opinions
[44:41] unto these things God shall add unto him
[44:44] the plagues that are written in this
[44:45] book so we need to be careful about our
[44:48] interpretation amen our opinions and our
[44:51] ideas we must stay with the word and
[44:54] only the word it must be the word from
[44:56] cover to cover it is the whole counsel
[44:59] of God
[45:01] now in a world full of people's ideas
[45:04] what's right what's wrong what's what's
[45:06] wrong with this I like what our brother
[45:08] said I I probably made mention if I did
[45:11] I'm sorry but he just we we're living in
[45:13] a time where everything's okay
[45:16] but everything isn't okay
[45:19] but in this world where everything seems
[45:21] to be okay we have a word to tell us
[45:24] what really is okay and what is not okay
[45:28] the Bible says the word of God is given
[45:30] to us as a lamp for our feet and a light
[45:32] for our path
[45:35] Jesus said in John chapter 12 verse 46
[45:38] he said I am come into the world
[45:42] that whosoever believeth on me
[45:46] should not stay as he is
[45:53] Amen in other words he should not abide
[45:56] in the darkness that he's in
[45:59] and any and if any man hear my words and
[46:01] believe not I judge him not for I came
[46:04] not to judge the world but to save the
[46:07] world
[46:08] that is no different than you talking to
[46:12] your children coming into the room and
[46:14] saying to them I'd like you to do your
[46:16] chores
[46:19] and if you don't do your chores
[46:22] that's fine
[46:24] but one day when I come back from
[46:27] vacation
[46:28] you're going to answer
[46:32] he said he in verse 48 he that rejecteth
[46:35] me and receiveth not my words have one
[46:38] that judgeth him the word that I have
[46:40] spoken the same shall judge him in the
[46:44] last day
[46:47] we don't have to accept the word but the
[46:50] word will judge us at the Judgment bar
[46:55] so the word comes to us with a
[46:58] responsibility
[47:00] amen we can't get rid of it whether we
[47:02] accept it or not we're going to be
[47:04] judged by it
[47:06] in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10
[47:09] we're just laying a foundation this
[47:10] morning for we must all appear before
[47:13] the Judgment seat of Christ
[47:15] that everyone may receive the things
[47:18] which he's done in his body according to
[47:19] what you have done whether it be good or
[47:22] bad we can't avoid it see we're all
[47:25] going to the Judgment seat of Christ now
[47:28] the wise the wise will appear before the
[47:32] Judgment seat of Christ here at church
[47:38] now the foolish they will deflect a void
[47:42] and not yield to the word
[47:45] and they'll have to face the word at the
[47:48] white Throne judgment where you can't
[47:49] just leave and you know kind of go do
[47:52] what you want to do after church you
[47:53] won't bound to do that
[47:55] you will have to face the word then
[48:00] verse 11 knowing therefore the terror of
[48:03] the Lord
[48:04] we persuade men
[48:08] we persuade men
[48:10] because we care about other people
[48:14] you're not going to persuade somebody
[48:15] you don't honestly don't care about them
[48:17] I'll be honest with you
[48:20] but we are made manifest unto God and I
[48:24] trust also made manifest in your
[48:26] conscience
[48:28] so the word of God is a two-edged sword
[48:32] it cuts in both directions
[48:35] it cuts towards you and away from you
[48:39] in other words the word of God is for
[48:41] your life and it's for the life of
[48:43] others
[48:46] the sword is not just to cut the devil
[48:48] up
[48:49] event all right
[48:51] but it's to cut your will out of your
[48:54] life that God's will could be done
[48:58] to help others see that they're not
[49:00] walking in the whole Council of God
[49:03] knowing the terror of the lord we
[49:05] persuade men
[49:06] by using the whole counsel of God now
[49:09] here's the thing when you speak the word
[49:11] to somebody it needs to be spoken by the
[49:14] Holy Ghost
[49:19] Amen in other words speak the truth in
[49:21] the love of God not speak the truth in
[49:22] the love of a human
[49:24] because the love of a human has limits
[49:28] it can't it you know something can
[49:30] bother you so much that you just can't
[49:32] take it you're done with it you're going
[49:33] to just give them a piece of your mind
[49:36] well they need the mind of Christ they
[49:38] don't need your mind
[49:40] so you need to speak the whole counsel
[49:43] of God with the whole spirit of God Amen
[49:46] so the word of God comes with a
[49:48] responsibility to obey it and to help
[49:51] others obey it
[49:53] so we need to walk in the light of the
[49:54] word and we need to persuade other
[49:56] people to walk in the light of the word
[49:59] this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ we
[50:02] can't do nothing about it we can't just
[50:03] pick and choose what we're going to take
[50:07] we need the whole counsel of God
[50:11] amen now we live in a world of Darkness
[50:13] complete darkness
[50:15] Jesus said in John 3 19 and this is the
[50:19] condemnation that light is coming to the
[50:22] world and men they love Darkness
[50:25] rather than light
[50:28] because their deeds were evil
[50:32] amen for everyone that doeth evil hateth
[50:35] the light and neither cometh to the
[50:36] light lest his deed should be reproved
[50:39] in other words people love to stay in a
[50:42] place of no accountability
[50:45] they don't want to be accountable they
[50:47] want to deflect talk about anything else
[50:50] but don't talk about what they need to
[50:52] be accountable to in fact let's talk
[50:54] about the things that I'm doing
[50:58] so why do people want to stay in that
[51:00] place of not being accountable because
[51:01] they actually love that place that
[51:04] Darkness
[51:06] they love being their own head
[51:09] nobody telling them what to do
[51:13] they love the choice of Darkness rather
[51:15] than light verse 21 but he that doeth
[51:19] truth cometh to the light that is D that
[51:23] is these may be manifest that they are
[51:25] wrought of God see when we choose when
[51:27] somebody tells us something and we
[51:30] choose to walk in it it is proving that
[51:34] you love God
[51:36] it shows that you're walking with him
[51:38] that you love truth
[51:40] but when you try to deflect from it
[51:47] you're shunning the gospel
[51:54] now we're living in the very hour where
[51:56] people are shunning the gospel more than
[51:59] they ever have
[52:00] of course there's more darkness in the
[52:02] earth than there ever has been it
[52:06] they're shunning out of our schools our
[52:08] our workplaces our governments our
[52:11] churches
[52:13] Paul said now the spirit speaketh
[52:15] expressively that in the latter times
[52:17] some shall depart from the faith
[52:20] giving heed to seducing spirits
[52:25] in doctrines of devils can you believe
[52:28] the devil is religious enough to have a
[52:30] Doctrine
[52:33] for the time will come when they will
[52:36] not endure sound Doctrine
[52:39] but after their own lust shall they Heap
[52:42] to themselves teachers
[52:43] having itching ears
[52:47] and they shall turn away their ears from
[52:49] the truth
[52:50] and shall turn unto Fables
[52:53] people are wanting the gospel to preach
[52:56] the way they want it to be preached that
[53:00] has never been meant how the gospel
[53:02] should God intend the gospel to be
[53:04] preached never
[53:06] God don't cater it to anybody
[53:10] but God is interested in us coming under
[53:14] subjection from cover to covered for the
[53:17] whole counsel of God so if we don't want
[53:19] to talk about this we'll talk about that
[53:21] God just wants us to walk in the light
[53:23] [Music]
[53:25] we're living in perilous times
[53:29] Christians today
[53:32] are becoming more in love with pleasures
[53:38] love for God is slipping
[53:42] now despite the dark world that we're
[53:44] living in and despite that the love that
[53:48] people have for the world we have a
[53:51] responsibility
[53:53] to declare the counsel of God to them
[53:56] and not just part of it but all the
[53:59] counsel of God that is our
[54:01] responsibility
[54:03] and it's been given to us by God
[54:06] that is not just the church telling you
[54:09] this is what you need to do I'm sorry
[54:11] but this is what God is telling me and
[54:14] you to do
[54:16] but a lot of times we hold back from
[54:18] sharing part of the Gospel
[54:20] [Music]
[54:21] maybe we're afraid of rejection
[54:25] losing a friendship
[54:28] I'm not sure which shoe is going to fit
[54:31] you
[54:32] but we're going to find one
[54:37] maybe we're afraid of even being
[54:39] ridicued
[54:41] Fiona shame
[54:44] despised or looked down upon has anybody
[54:47] ever felt this before
[54:49] all right so we all got the shoes fit
[54:52] now we can just let that go
[54:56] we're always being tempted by the devil
[54:59] to avoid or deflect from our god-given
[55:01] responsibilities
[55:04] we've all been tempted to hold back from
[55:06] sharing the whole counsel of God with
[55:08] somebody because we're afraid of just
[55:09] what they're going to think right
[55:14] right when it comes to a personal
[55:15] responsibility to help others we have a
[55:18] tendency to shun those responsibilities
[55:20] like that's not my job
[55:24] or they don't listen to me anyways
[55:28] somebody besides me needs to tell them
[55:30] or that's really the job of the pastor
[55:33] can you imagine that you're so good to
[55:36] define the pastor's job
[55:39] that's pretty good that God has inspired
[55:42] you
[55:43] to know what the pastor should be doing
[55:45] yet you can't come under subjection to
[55:47] the pastor
[55:53] we can become too selfish like Cain
[55:55] avoiding or deflecting his
[55:58] responsibility am I My Brother's Keeper
[56:03] the Holy Ghost is what equips us and
[56:06] leads us into action to start declaring
[56:09] the whole Council of God and helping
[56:10] others
[56:12] we just got to get used to loving one
[56:14] another enough to try to help somebody
[56:16] yes it isn't about you just going around
[56:19] telling people how wrong and how bad
[56:21] they are but it's having such a burden
[56:24] for their soul a burden for their
[56:26] character that you just want to help
[56:27] them get to Christ
[56:33] Paul did not hold back
[56:38] he knew it took all the word to make it
[56:41] and that's why he gave all the word
[56:44] and he wasn't afraid to being persecuted
[56:47] was he
[56:48] wasn't afraid to be in stone or beaten
[56:51] with rods
[56:53] he wasn't he wasn't afraid about trouble
[56:56] every side that he turned no matter who
[56:58] he taught you there was going to be
[56:59] trouble
[57:01] he wasn't afraid of being perplexed or
[57:03] cast down that's what the scripture
[57:05] tells us
[57:06] and it didn't matter that the Holy Ghost
[57:08] was even witnessing in every city saying
[57:11] bonds and afflictions abide me
[57:15] Paul
[57:16] was always bearing about in his body the
[57:20] dying of the Lord Jesus
[57:23] he said none of these things removed me
[57:25] neither count I my personal life dear
[57:30] unto me
[57:31] so that I might finish my course with
[57:35] notice Joy
[57:37] Joy
[57:39] not oh I gotta do this
[57:42] but there was a joy in his heart
[57:45] and the ministry which I've received of
[57:48] the Lord Jesus to testify
[57:50] the gospel of the grace of God wherefore
[57:54] I take you to record this day I am pure
[57:58] from the blood of all men how do you get
[58:00] pure from the blood of all men
[58:02] you don't hold back anything
[58:09] you let them know everything that God
[58:12] has told you to tell them
[58:16] for I have not shown to declare unto you
[58:19] all the counsel or the will of God you
[58:23] know I understand that as soon as you
[58:25] step into this scripture here about
[58:29] declaring the whole word of God you're
[58:31] going to lose friendships
[58:33] you're really going to lose friendships
[58:35] and you're going to lose family members
[58:40] but it is the truth
[58:42] all right
[58:45] because Darkness and Light Clyde
[58:52] when the light turns on Darkness
[58:54] scatters
[58:56] and and if people love Darkness they're
[58:59] going to get out of this light
[59:04] so Satan is not done with the temptation
[59:07] of trying to offer
[59:10] your will to do whatever you want in
[59:13] this age
[59:14] it's the age of Rights
[59:19] but God has called us like he's called
[59:22] Paul
[59:24] to declare the whole Council of God
[59:31] amen the word shun means to withhold
[59:35] if you look that up to withhold under or
[59:38] out of sight
[59:40] to cower to shrink
[59:42] to conceal to reserve to draw back to
[59:46] keep back
[59:48] or to withdraw from
[59:51] to avoid evade Escape elude
[59:56] prevent to dodge to deflect well we got
[1:00:00] a lot of words
[1:00:01] should not be a problem understanding
[1:00:07] Paul did not withhold the truth
[1:00:10] he didn't keep back part of it because
[1:00:12] well they just couldn't take it
[1:00:15] he didn't conceal it or re reserve it
[1:00:18] neither did he cower down or Shrink from
[1:00:21] his responsibility he said for I have
[1:00:25] not shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:00:29] Council of God and I'll tell you where
[1:00:31] would you and I be today if 14 books of
[1:00:35] his letters were were not written
[1:00:39] we wouldn't know how to have church
[1:00:41] order we would not have Deacons
[1:00:46] if if it wasn't for the 14 books
[1:00:50] there would be a something missing that
[1:00:53] God wanted us to know and that's why
[1:00:54] it's in the word
[1:00:57] I'm so glad I'll tell you everyone that
[1:01:00] goes on the other that makes another
[1:01:01] side that comes up to brother random
[1:01:04] they're going to say I'm glad that you
[1:01:06] came and you gave me the word hey amen
[1:01:10] because that's the only ones that make
[1:01:11] it the ones that take all the word amen
[1:01:14] amen I thought of this letter when I was
[1:01:16] reflecting on this statement that Paul
[1:01:18] made for I have not shunned to declare
[1:01:20] unto you the whole counsel of God
[1:01:24] it was written by a young preacher in
[1:01:28] Zimbabwe Africa following his Martin for
[1:01:32] his faith in Jesus Christ he says I
[1:01:35] quote his letter verbatim and I might
[1:01:38] have read this in the past in the other
[1:01:41] Church
[1:01:43] maybe I think I did he says I'm part of
[1:01:47] the Fellowship of the unshamed
[1:01:52] I have the Holy Spirit power
[1:01:55] to die has been cast I have stepped over
[1:01:59] the line the decision has already been
[1:02:01] made I am a disciple of his
[1:02:05] I won't look back let up slow down back
[1:02:09] away or be still
[1:02:12] my past is redeemed my present makes
[1:02:15] sense my future is secure
[1:02:18] I'm finished and I'm done with low
[1:02:21] living
[1:02:24] sidewalking
[1:02:26] smooth knees
[1:02:29] colorless dreams
[1:02:31] tame Visions worldly talking
[1:02:35] cheap giving
[1:02:37] in dwarf goals
[1:02:40] I am no longer I no longer need
[1:02:43] preeminence
[1:02:46] prosperity
[1:02:47] position promotions
[1:02:50] plods or popularity
[1:02:53] I don't have to be right
[1:02:55] first tops recognized
[1:02:59] praised regarded or rewarded
[1:03:04] I now live by faith
[1:03:07] lean in his presence walked by patience
[1:03:10] and uplifted in prayer
[1:03:13] and I labor with power
[1:03:16] my face is set
[1:03:18] my gate is fast
[1:03:21] my goal is heaven my road is narrow my
[1:03:24] way is rough my companions are few
[1:03:28] my guide is reliable
[1:03:30] my mission
[1:03:32] is clear
[1:03:35] I cannot be bought
[1:03:37] compromise
[1:03:38] deterred
[1:03:40] lured away
[1:03:42] turn back
[1:03:43] deluded or delayed
[1:03:46] I will not flinch in the face of
[1:03:48] sacrifice
[1:03:50] hesitate in the presence of the enemy
[1:03:53] Ponder at the pool of popularity
[1:03:56] or mean mender at the Maze of mediocracy
[1:04:01] I Won't Give Up
[1:04:03] shut up let up until I have stayed up
[1:04:06] stored up prayed up and paid up preached
[1:04:10] up for the cause of Christ
[1:04:13] I am a disciple of Jesus
[1:04:16] I must go till he comes
[1:04:19] give till I drop
[1:04:22] preach to all know and work
[1:04:26] till he stops me and when he comes for
[1:04:29] his own he will have no problem
[1:04:32] recognizing me my bat my banner will be
[1:04:36] clear
[1:04:37] I'm a part of the Fellowship of the
[1:04:40] unshamed
[1:04:42] Paul was sold out
[1:04:45] hooked Line and Sinker we might say he
[1:04:48] wasn't ashamed of the Gospel
[1:04:51] he not only accepted his
[1:04:53] responsibilities
[1:04:54] but he welcomed it he pursued it he not
[1:04:58] only uh accepted it but he embraced it
[1:05:03] he felt in debt to his responsibility in
[1:05:08] debt to God in debt to do his will now
[1:05:10] there's a difference
[1:05:13] people don't do things
[1:05:16] if they don't
[1:05:18] a lot of times people don't do things
[1:05:20] until they feel indebted
[1:05:23] the Commandments of God are not Grievous
[1:05:25] but if you have to do something that you
[1:05:29] don't want to do it becomes Grievous
[1:05:33] and this this message just being
[1:05:35] preacher we've never
[1:05:37] believed in manipulating anybody
[1:05:41] or forcing anybody in church to do
[1:05:43] something or not to do something
[1:05:47] it is a personal relationship between
[1:05:50] you and Christ you make the decision of
[1:05:52] what you want to do and what you don't
[1:05:53] want to do
[1:05:56] but
[1:05:57] we believe the word from cover to cover
[1:06:02] and when you're sold out to that word
[1:06:04] you're in debt to the word
[1:06:07] Paul said in Romans chapter 1 verse 14
[1:06:09] he said I am
[1:06:13] debtor
[1:06:15] both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians
[1:06:17] to the wise and to the unwise
[1:06:21] so as much as
[1:06:23] in me is I am ready to preach the gospel
[1:06:28] to you that are at Rome also I just
[1:06:33] wonder
[1:06:34] are we ready to preach the word
[1:06:37] wherever we go whoever we're talking to
[1:06:40] whoever we're texting
[1:06:43] are we ready
[1:06:44] amen for I am not ashamed of the gospel
[1:06:49] of Christ
[1:06:50] for it is the power of God unto
[1:06:53] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:06:56] the Jew first and also to the Greek
[1:07:00] I'm so glad for the person that came to
[1:07:03] me and shared the gospel
[1:07:05] name it
[1:07:07] because I know there's a lot of people
[1:07:08] that are ashamed and don't want to talk
[1:07:10] about it
[1:07:12] they kind of justify well God just has
[1:07:15] to deal with them
[1:07:19] yeah God has to deal with them
[1:07:23] but why don't you let God use you to lay
[1:07:25] some seeds
[1:07:30] well I'm afraid that you know
[1:07:35] they're going to think I'm strange
[1:07:38] I'm an oddball
[1:07:40] that I'm not the person who they thought
[1:07:44] I was
[1:07:46] I just say you're ashamed of the Gospel
[1:07:50] and you don't know it
[1:07:54] you've got to pick up this word
[1:07:56] pick up this sword and love their soul
[1:07:59] more than that
[1:08:04] there's so needs to mean more to you
[1:08:06] because it does to God than your
[1:08:09] personal relationship does with them
[1:08:12] Paul wasn't worried about popularity and
[1:08:15] having friendship and having more people
[1:08:17] in his church
[1:08:18] amen
[1:08:21] he was interested in their soul being in
[1:08:24] the image of Christ and it takes the
[1:08:26] whole word of God for that
[1:08:33] I don't believe he coward or shrinked
[1:08:37] verse 17 for therein is the
[1:08:39] righteousness of God revealed from Faith
[1:08:41] to Faith as it written the just shall
[1:08:44] live by faith
[1:08:46] not think
[1:08:49] not know
[1:08:50] but live
[1:08:52] Hallelujah this is a gospel that is
[1:08:54] supposed to be lived amen for the raft
[1:08:57] of God is revealed from Heaven against
[1:08:59] all ungodliness
[1:09:01] and unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:09:06] truth in unrighteousness so you see the
[1:09:09] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:09:11] always has a little bit of Truth
[1:09:13] people are walking around with a little
[1:09:15] bit of Truth
[1:09:17] they're holding the truth but
[1:09:20] but in a heart that's not righteous
[1:09:24] and it's our job
[1:09:26] to give them the light
[1:09:28] come on now amen I'm not saying make an
[1:09:31] enemy out of everybody I'm just telling
[1:09:33] you declare the gospel
[1:09:36] I know that the enemy's probably not uh
[1:09:40] being favorable this message
[1:09:42] I'm I'm
[1:09:45] trusting that the holy spirit will get
[1:09:47] the word the way it is to our hearts
[1:09:53] all right verse 19 because that they
[1:09:58] which may be known of God is Manifest in
[1:10:01] them for God have showed it on to them
[1:10:04] we still need God to show them
[1:10:08] we do but let God use you
[1:10:11] let God use you to give them the word to
[1:10:13] lay that seed
[1:10:15] we ought to always be feeling in debt to
[1:10:18] God enough to go share the word with
[1:10:21] others
[1:10:22] that's why Jesus said his last
[1:10:24] commission was go yelled preach the
[1:10:27] gospel
[1:10:29] whatever I've taught you teach them
[1:10:32] from cover to cover don't don't just
[1:10:34] stop
[1:10:36] don't be lazy
[1:10:38] don't say I'm too busy I don't got time
[1:10:41] it's not my calling I just only time I
[1:10:44] got is to enough to come to church
[1:10:46] is that all you got for God
[1:10:49] said oh you love him
[1:10:53] we're running out of time what
[1:10:55] difference does it make what you get on
[1:10:57] this planet
[1:10:58] [Music]
[1:11:00] we need to win a soul it's worth more
[1:11:02] than anything you could make
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:05] first Thessalonians chapter one
[1:11:08] verse 1.
[1:11:10] honestly this is this the very
[1:11:12] scriptures that this whole message came
[1:11:14] to me on
[1:11:17] Paul and silvanus
[1:11:19] and tamalthius
[1:11:21] so there's three of them here
[1:11:23] unto the Church of the Thessalonians so
[1:11:27] let's just put our name there unto the
[1:11:29] Church of Fenton Michigan
[1:11:32] which is in God the father and in the
[1:11:34] Lord Jesus Christ Grace be unto you and
[1:11:38] peace from God our Father and the Lord
[1:11:41] Jesus Christ we give thanks to God
[1:11:43] always for you all making mention of you
[1:11:47] in our prayers remembering without
[1:11:49] ceasing your work of faith and labor of
[1:11:52] love and patience of Hope in our Lord
[1:11:55] Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our
[1:11:57] father knowing the Brethren beloved
[1:12:02] your election of God
[1:12:06] for Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[1:12:10] only
[1:12:12] but also in power
[1:12:16] and in the Holy Ghost
[1:12:19] and in much assurance
[1:12:22] as you know what manner of men we were
[1:12:26] among you okay so now here is Paul is
[1:12:31] making this statement Paul Savannah's
[1:12:34] into mothius
[1:12:37] they had not just a word but they lived
[1:12:41] a life
[1:12:43] they had power to live the word
[1:12:48] and and it just got done describing what
[1:12:53] the word does it lives for others the
[1:12:57] greatest power that I feel we could have
[1:12:59] is the power to lay down our life to
[1:13:02] live for somebody else
[1:13:05] because it's our will that's always
[1:13:07] wanting something it isn't trying to
[1:13:09] justify what we want is okay friends
[1:13:11] that don't mean nothing
[1:13:14] the whole thing is doing God's will
[1:13:17] amen if I was out there and say Amen to
[1:13:19] that the whole thing is wanting to do
[1:13:22] God's will to win a soul that's where
[1:13:25] his his purpose is on Earth
[1:13:33] and look at this and you
[1:13:36] became followers
[1:13:39] of us
[1:13:40] notice
[1:13:42] he said us
[1:13:46] and of the Lord
[1:13:52] somebody is following you
[1:13:58] somebody is following you and you're
[1:14:01] following somebody
[1:14:04] it's the truth
[1:14:06] and ye became followers of us and of the
[1:14:10] Lord having received the word in much
[1:14:15] affliction
[1:14:17] with joy of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:21] of course if you're going to receive
[1:14:23] this word
[1:14:24] You're Gonna Lose Friends
[1:14:27] that's right
[1:14:30] if you you sisters
[1:14:34] you
[1:14:35] you when you came to the truth I'm sure
[1:14:38] you cut your hair all the time
[1:14:41] and when you come to the message and you
[1:14:44] start letting your hair grow out you
[1:14:47] will just have friends Fall Away
[1:14:51] you start wearing dresses you men stop
[1:14:53] telling jokes like you used to friends
[1:14:55] will just fall away
[1:14:59] and there's affliction
[1:15:02] but you know there's joy in the Holy
[1:15:04] Ghost
[1:15:07] so this word when it proclaimed out of
[1:15:11] your life
[1:15:12] the gospel is proclaimed out you will
[1:15:15] get people following you to Christ
[1:15:18] that's what this scripture is telling me
[1:15:20] here
[1:15:23] the fruit of you declaring the gospel
[1:15:27] is that Souls will come through your
[1:15:29] ministry amen
[1:15:31] I believe that with all my heart
[1:15:34] and look at this verse 7 so that ye were
[1:15:37] examples
[1:15:40] to all that believed in Macedonia and
[1:15:43] acchaiah
[1:15:49] so the gospel came to them
[1:15:51] they received the gospel
[1:15:55] they became Follies you know I'm going
[1:15:56] to follow Paul I'm going to follow
[1:15:57] Timothy
[1:15:59] I'm going to follow
[1:16:02] and I'm going to follow
[1:16:04] not like this
[1:16:06] wherever they go
[1:16:08] I'm going to follow their example and
[1:16:10] I'm gonna go over here and I'm going to
[1:16:12] start spreading the gospel like they did
[1:16:19] the whole Council of God look at verse 8
[1:16:22] now
[1:16:24] for from you sounded the word of the
[1:16:27] Lord not only in Macedonia in
[1:16:30] I don't want to say that a Kaya but also
[1:16:34] in every place your faith to God word is
[1:16:37] spread abroad so that you don't there we
[1:16:39] need not to to speak of anything
[1:16:42] there's there's just things happening
[1:16:45] because of you
[1:16:47] for they themselves show of us what
[1:16:50] manner of entering in we had unto you
[1:16:53] and how that you turned from Idols to
[1:16:58] serve the living and the true God
[1:17:05] when you get people to turn from the
[1:17:07] things of this word world
[1:17:09] and turn to God
[1:17:11] that means you had an impact in their
[1:17:13] life
[1:17:15] and to wait for his son from Heaven whom
[1:17:18] he raised from the dead even Jesus which
[1:17:19] delivered us from the Wrath to come now
[1:17:22] I just want to talk a little bit about
[1:17:25] these examples because you know the
[1:17:27] examples are kind of close to one
[1:17:28] another
[1:17:30] Jesus did say in the last day the two
[1:17:32] Spirits would be so close and that if it
[1:17:35] were possible it deceived the very elect
[1:17:36] now we're all following someone right
[1:17:39] and behind that someone is a spiritual
[1:17:42] voice
[1:17:43] it's it's leading us
[1:17:46] if it's God it's leading us to the
[1:17:48] straight narrow and if it's not of God
[1:17:51] it's leading us to compromise
[1:17:55] it's not going to lead us to the bar
[1:17:58] it's going to lead us to compromise
[1:18:02] just Veer off a little bit
[1:18:04] and the Thessalonian Church chose to
[1:18:08] follow Paul and the Lord in the Church
[1:18:10] of Fenton has chosen to follow Paul and
[1:18:14] the Lord
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:16] this is the gospel that is preached here
[1:18:19] and it it shall forever be preached here
[1:18:23] we as individuals choose this same
[1:18:26] gospel that's preached here
[1:18:28] or we choose to follow
[1:18:31] something compromised
[1:18:34] we either follow Paul and the Lord or we
[1:18:37] fall apart of Paul and the Lord
[1:18:44] so as an example I want to give here to
[1:18:46] kind of drive this home
[1:18:48] and it's the children of Israel they
[1:18:51] followed
[1:18:53] the prophet of that hour which was Moses
[1:18:56] and the Lord out of Egypt yes
[1:19:00] God LED them to the Red Sea and the way
[1:19:02] of the wilderness
[1:19:04] God literally LED his children by day
[1:19:08] and by night and through this whole
[1:19:11] journey he actually was teaching them
[1:19:13] how to trust him
[1:19:16] now they they didn't they didn't listen
[1:19:18] very well but he was still teaching
[1:19:21] he was still teaching them God was
[1:19:24] faithful to meet all their needs during
[1:19:26] this time
[1:19:28] even though they murmured and they
[1:19:31] complained he still gave them water
[1:19:33] and and Mana right and didn't Paul say
[1:19:36] these are the things that we should be
[1:19:37] content with
[1:19:39] amen did he say that God LED them to the
[1:19:42] promised land
[1:19:43] more than once
[1:19:47] they were truly followers of the Prophet
[1:19:50] Moses and the Lord can you say Amen to
[1:19:52] that they were followers
[1:19:57] but let's look at number 32 and see what
[1:19:59] happened at the end of them that were
[1:20:01] following
[1:20:04] number 32 verse 11.
[1:20:07] surely none of these men
[1:20:10] that came up out of Egypt
[1:20:13] from 20 years old and upward
[1:20:16] shall see the land
[1:20:19] which I swear unto Abraham and Isaac and
[1:20:21] unto Jacob because here it is because
[1:20:25] they have not holy
[1:20:29] followed me
[1:20:32] or we just went through all the ways
[1:20:34] they followed him and that was amazing
[1:20:37] they were following
[1:20:39] but they were not holy following
[1:20:42] they took part of the Gospel
[1:20:45] but they didn't take the whole gospel
[1:20:47] they shunned part of the Gospel
[1:20:51] well we know there were two
[1:20:55] there were two that proclaimed it
[1:20:57] we're more than able to take it
[1:21:02] because if you go back and you look at
[1:21:04] the reading they came back from the
[1:21:05] promise and said oh yeah it's a land
[1:21:06] that fills with milk and honey and it's
[1:21:09] it's just like it says but
[1:21:13] we know God's real we've seen the power
[1:21:15] of God but
[1:21:17] to have that life in me to where I'm
[1:21:19] sold out
[1:21:21] living for God every day
[1:21:24] just can't do that
[1:21:26] the giant want in my life is too great
[1:21:29] so I'm going to look for a spiritual
[1:21:32] I'll just say it like this a religious
[1:21:34] way to compromise
[1:21:37] I'll still go to church I'll still pay
[1:21:39] my ties
[1:21:42] but to live for others
[1:21:45] I'm afraid
[1:21:47] I'm afraid I'll lose my life
[1:21:51] that's why the children of Israel didn't
[1:21:53] want to take the promised land they were
[1:21:55] afraid they were going to lose their
[1:21:56] life if they knew that they knew that
[1:21:58] they knew that they were not going to
[1:22:00] lose their life they would have went in
[1:22:02] but they were afraid and that's why
[1:22:04] Jesus said if you don't give up your
[1:22:06] life you could gain the whole world
[1:22:07] you're still going to lose your soul
[1:22:11] I believe we're blessed
[1:22:16] God's children followed the Lord and the
[1:22:18] prophet of the hour but not completely
[1:22:21] not entirely they followed to a point
[1:22:24] but you know to a point they became
[1:22:28] ashamed
[1:22:30] they were ashamed it wasn't worth giving
[1:22:33] their all it wasn't worth
[1:22:35] surrendering everything to follow what
[1:22:38] the prophet said
[1:22:40] it wasn't even worth fighting for you
[1:22:43] know a lot of times we we read the
[1:22:45] message of the hour we listen to the
[1:22:48] tapes and we
[1:22:50] cherry pick
[1:22:52] what we're going to talk about
[1:22:56] what we're going to emphasize what we're
[1:22:58] going to say that is important
[1:23:01] when really the whole word is important
[1:23:03] the whole message is important
[1:23:07] but we need to have that
[1:23:10] that heart
[1:23:12] to want all the counsel of God
[1:23:16] to have a heart to be part of the
[1:23:19] fellowship
[1:23:21] of the unshamed
[1:23:25] I want to be with Joshua and Caleb amen
[1:23:28] look I may not be able to preached like
[1:23:30] him but I'm going to support him
[1:23:35] I'm going to live my life the better
[1:23:37] very best I can I don't know who I was
[1:23:39] telling I think I might have been
[1:23:40] telling this Brother Joseph over here I
[1:23:42] can't remember but you know I just I
[1:23:45] don't imagine Jesus being a fiery
[1:23:48] evangelistical preacher evangelist I
[1:23:50] just don't
[1:23:52] but yet it's part of the fivefold
[1:23:54] ministry
[1:23:56] he chose it to be part of it amen
[1:23:59] see what was important was the word
[1:24:03] Joshua and Caleb were attracted to the
[1:24:06] word
[1:24:07] that was the absolute for them
[1:24:10] and the bride is attracted to the word
[1:24:13] not how the word is delivered
[1:24:17] not the excitement of the word because I
[1:24:20] don't care how exciting it is you still
[1:24:21] got to go out there and deny yourself
[1:24:24] and live for others so have all the good
[1:24:26] time you want in here I'm okay with that
[1:24:29] I wouldn't want to stop it but don't let
[1:24:32] it stop at the doors and go live any way
[1:24:34] you want to live give your life and go
[1:24:37] win the soul for Jesus let that word
[1:24:39] sink down deep in your soul
[1:24:42] because that's what it's for
[1:24:48] the children of Israel who follow the
[1:24:50] prophet and who were blessed along the
[1:24:53] way never receive the original
[1:24:57] blessing that God had promised which was
[1:25:00] the Promised Land they were ashamed to
[1:25:02] follow the lord wholeheartedly Jesus
[1:25:05] said in Mark 8 38 whosoever therefore
[1:25:08] shall be ashamed of me
[1:25:10] and of my words and this adulterous and
[1:25:12] sinful generation of him also
[1:25:16] amen this God who loves us shall be
[1:25:20] ashamed shall the son of man be ashamed
[1:25:22] when he cometh
[1:25:24] in the glory of his father with his holy
[1:25:28] angels
[1:25:32] you know I am
[1:25:36] ashamed of my life
[1:25:39] I am ashamed of the mistakes I've made
[1:25:45] I am ashamed that I haven't taken time
[1:25:50] when the Holy Spirit whispered talk to
[1:25:53] this person
[1:25:54] I'm ashamed of that
[1:25:57] I am ashamed of myself
[1:26:01] but I am not ashamed of the Gospel
[1:26:05] it is perfect
[1:26:08] it's pure
[1:26:10] it's holy it's righteous it's correct
[1:26:13] it's right even when it tells me I'm
[1:26:17] wrong it's still right
[1:26:20] amen I'm not ashamed of that I'm not
[1:26:22] ashamed of Jesus Christ
[1:26:27] no wonder Jesus gave us good advice when
[1:26:29] he told us we need to deny ourselves
[1:26:31] because it's the only thing that stands
[1:26:34] in the way of us living the word
[1:26:37] is ourself
[1:26:40] now even though God's children follow
[1:26:42] the lord the Bible says with many of
[1:26:44] them he was not pleased
[1:26:47] the Lord's anger was kindled the Bible
[1:26:49] says against Israel and he made them to
[1:26:53] wander in the wilderness for 40 years
[1:26:56] until all the generation that had done
[1:26:59] evil in his sight of the Lord was
[1:27:01] consumed
[1:27:03] and none of the men that came out of
[1:27:05] Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall
[1:27:07] see the land which God had promised to
[1:27:10] Abraham's seed because they had not
[1:27:12] wholly followed me
[1:27:16] verse 12 save Caleb
[1:27:19] the son of
[1:27:21] June uh
[1:27:25] the Canaanite kuzanite kanzanite kensan
[1:27:31] Joshua those are the two guys right
[1:27:33] there
[1:27:36] for they
[1:27:38] they were different
[1:27:41] they holy follow the lord
[1:27:43] that's the only difference in those two
[1:27:45] verses
[1:27:48] they were all they all went to church
[1:27:50] they all were under the cloud all
[1:27:53] all experience the same thing
[1:27:56] the Bible tells us that Joshua Caleb had
[1:27:58] another spirit that Spirit Led them to
[1:28:01] follow the lord all the way
[1:28:03] amen
[1:28:04] where the spirit that the other ones had
[1:28:07] was a compromising spirit amen
[1:28:10] amen it's like a lot
[1:28:13] lot
[1:28:14] chose the easier path
[1:28:19] well to us lot is just the easier path
[1:28:22] in a city
[1:28:24] for us to go
[1:28:26] put our house towards
[1:28:28] it's the easier path that we're all
[1:28:30] tempted to take every day
[1:28:33] and this gospel is not easy
[1:28:36] it's hard
[1:28:38] but that's the calling
[1:28:40] and the bride I think accepts it because
[1:28:43] our light Affliction for a moment isn't
[1:28:44] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:28:46] that shall be revealed in US
[1:28:49] we just got to keep our eyes on the
[1:28:52] prize
[1:28:54] and your your hardship to win One Soul
[1:28:57] you'll never regret it
[1:28:59] you'll never regret it up there you'll
[1:29:01] never say you know what I wish I would
[1:29:03] have took on another job
[1:29:06] I wish I would have got that that that
[1:29:08] third house
[1:29:11] that that new car
[1:29:15] it'll net you'll there won't be one
[1:29:17] person in heaven that says that
[1:29:20] even if you love hunting
[1:29:23] [Laughter]
[1:29:25] where brother Branham compared it just
[1:29:27] to a pig
[1:29:31] become a human would you want to go back
[1:29:33] and be a pig no matter what great things
[1:29:35] we could have down here there's nothing
[1:29:37] that can be compared to winning one soul
[1:29:40] to the Lord
[1:29:46] we have to hurry time is slipping away
[1:29:52] the children
[1:29:54] of God or the children of Israel were
[1:29:58] ashamed they were ashamed of the Gospel
[1:30:00] they were stand up they were ashamed to
[1:30:02] stand up and say like Joshua and Caleb
[1:30:04] we're more than able to take it the lamb
[1:30:07] they wanted to kind of sit back and let
[1:30:10] somebody else build the atmosphere in
[1:30:12] the church
[1:30:15] right
[1:30:17] you know I do my part
[1:30:19] you do
[1:30:21] well maybe God's calling you to do more
[1:30:23] I think Joshua and Caleb stood stuck out
[1:30:26] like a sore thumb
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:29] who are we to say I've done my part tell
[1:30:32] me who
[1:30:33] how do you know God don't want you to do
[1:30:35] more
[1:30:38] maybe that's what we're waiting on is
[1:30:41] for you to do your part
[1:30:45] maybe maybe the children of Israel they
[1:30:48] were ashamed some of them might have
[1:30:50] been ashamed to to pay their ties
[1:30:58] maybe they were ashamed to really come
[1:31:00] to church early enough to prepare their
[1:31:02] heart because because
[1:31:06] if we can't be ashamed
[1:31:09] amen we need to take the sword
[1:31:12] and allow that sword to cut our will to
[1:31:15] follow the pattern that God sent in a
[1:31:17] prophet in this age
[1:31:19] and we need to get serious about
[1:31:20] following it and not just following the
[1:31:23] part we want to and think and call
[1:31:25] ourselves a Christian that is not a
[1:31:27] Christian
[1:31:29] a Christian will take the whole word
[1:31:32] and when you say I am taking the whole
[1:31:35] word then I know it's cutting you
[1:31:39] I say that's a Christian
[1:31:42] not a modern Christian
[1:31:45] but old-time religion
[1:31:48] that's what we need
[1:31:50] we need old-time religion
[1:31:54] so the question
[1:31:56] this morning is are we setting the
[1:31:58] example of holy following the Lord
[1:32:02] are we studying the example
[1:32:06] of just following the Lord
[1:32:10] I didn't hear one Amen on that
[1:32:12] [Laughter]
[1:32:16] we all feel like we're following the
[1:32:17] Lord
[1:32:19] but are we holy following them
[1:32:22] it's easy to say we are but are we
[1:32:28] are you are you telling this gospel to
[1:32:32] Every Soul
[1:32:34] that you can or you holding back because
[1:32:37] you're afraid to lose a relationship
[1:32:40] or because you're you don't want them to
[1:32:43] look at you kind of strange
[1:32:50] we should care more about a relationship
[1:32:52] with God than one another
[1:32:59] don't shun part of the Gospel
[1:33:01] don't shun part of the message don't be
[1:33:04] ashamed
[1:33:06] declare it
[1:33:08] take a stand
[1:33:10] we need to keep running this race
[1:33:13] and I'll tell you you need patience
[1:33:15] because you're going to get up tomorrow
[1:33:17] you've got to do it all again
[1:33:19] you're gonna have to go through it again
[1:33:21] we need to keep pressing towards the
[1:33:24] mark amen
[1:33:25] we need to be looking for the
[1:33:27] predestinated we don't know who they are
[1:33:30] right
[1:33:32] God doesn't did God ever tell anybody
[1:33:35] here who was predestinated to go to them
[1:33:38] their predestinated give them the word
[1:33:40] no he wants us to preach it to Every
[1:33:43] Creature just preach the word get it out
[1:33:46] there
[1:33:48] we didn't we need to make our church
[1:33:50] better
[1:33:52] we need to be an example here that we're
[1:33:56] holy following this message
[1:33:59] the word of God
[1:34:01] from cover to cover
[1:34:03] we need to be interested in helping
[1:34:05] those
[1:34:07] who are who are not
[1:34:12] how do I do that Brother John it starts
[1:34:15] with One Thing Called Love
[1:34:17] love I love I love God and he wants me
[1:34:22] to help them
[1:34:24] and I'm going to help them in love
[1:34:28] I am not going to correct them in my
[1:34:30] self-righteous indignation
[1:34:33] that'll do more harm than good
[1:34:37] but I am going to get down and I'm going
[1:34:39] to wash my feet
[1:34:40] washed their feet
[1:34:42] I'm going to get my hands dirty
[1:34:45] I'm going to declare unto them the whole
[1:34:47] counsel of God
[1:34:50] ye which are spiritual go to such a one
[1:34:55] in the spirit of meekness
[1:34:57] considering yourself
[1:35:01] we gotta we got a responsibility here in
[1:35:03] church and we got a responsibility
[1:35:05] outside the church
[1:35:07] we got a responsibility to one another
[1:35:09] we got a responsibility to our lives
[1:35:13] we got a responsibility to this word
[1:35:15] that we give it to somebody
[1:35:18] and if God gives you another few days to
[1:35:21] live what are you going to do with it
[1:35:23] are we going to live it for ourselves
[1:35:26] are we just going to Humble ourselves
[1:35:29] before the Lord and say God have your
[1:35:31] way with me
[1:35:32] amen let's Stand Together
[1:35:39] my my my my my
[1:35:41] I want you to know I got many scriptures
[1:35:44] but you know what you can do you can
[1:35:45] just go home and read the Bible and
[1:35:47] you'll see those scriptures
[1:35:51] you know Paul told thank you Paul told
[1:35:55] Timothy to be an example to the
[1:35:59] Believers
[1:36:03] we have such an opportunity
[1:36:06] to help one another
[1:36:09] but I'll say it like this when you come
[1:36:10] to those doors every service
[1:36:13] have a motive to help somebody amen
[1:36:18] something about God that we reap what we
[1:36:21] sow
[1:36:22] if you just put the kingdom first he
[1:36:24] just seems to bless you
[1:36:27] but if you come in with selfish Spirits
[1:36:29] just all about yourself about your life
[1:36:35] because look I'll be honest with you I I
[1:36:38] feel I have so many needs
[1:36:41] that I I don't even got time to
[1:36:45] help anybody
[1:36:49] seriously
[1:36:53] but our life isn't for ourself and our
[1:36:56] needs we're always going to have needs
[1:36:58] we're always going to have something
[1:37:01] that we want and need help with that's
[1:37:05] just the way life is
[1:37:07] but if we spend our time helping others
[1:37:12] that touches the heart of God that's
[1:37:14] missionary work and it's always in the
[1:37:16] will of God living for others
[1:37:19] May the Holy Spirit help us amen
