[15:10] Well, we just have a few announcements.
[15:13] Uh let's remember the uh potluck that's
[15:17] out there. It's on the signup sheet.
[15:19] There's a few open spots. Uh
[15:23] all you have to do is be willing.
[15:26] You know, you don't have to be a great
[15:27] cook. You just have to be willing to
[15:31] pray and then the Lord will lead you.
[15:34] So, let's just remember that it's always
[15:37] a good time for fellowship. We have our
[15:39] time here with the Lord, but it's good
[15:42] time to have fellowship with one
[15:44] another. Amen. So, let's just be praying
[15:46] for that and um I'm sure the Lord will
[15:49] reward us. Also, um if you haven't seen
[15:52] it on the board, this is a new
[15:54] announcement.
[15:56] Most of us know the Fontaine family.
[15:59] Um uh they're great musicians.
[16:03] They're brother Paul's a good preacher.
[16:06] I mean there I can't I don't think you
[16:08] can say enough about them. Uh so we
[16:11] don't have an opportunity to go down to
[16:13] their church because we come here. We
[16:15] fellowship with the Lord here. But um
[16:18] they're going to come on uh September uh
[16:21] 13th.
[16:22] So this is just a really good
[16:24] opportunity to introduce people that
[16:28] have never been here to our church. So,
[16:31] let's just um grab a flyer as we go out.
[16:35] Um tell somebody
[16:38] we got to spread the good news.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; We know we have the truth.
[16:43] So, um

[16:48] blessed. Uh so, we need to bless the
[16:52] other people. Um time's running out.
[16:57] So
[17:00] we know the we know the parable about
[17:02] the foolish virgins. So uh a lot of
[17:05] people are going to be caught unaware
[17:08] and uh it should be on our hearts desire
[17:11] to just not feed ourselves but also feed
[17:14] the multitudes. So, let's just um grab a
[17:20] flyer, be diligent about um
[17:24] spreading the good news.
[17:26] Amen. We can't be a a quiet Christian,
[17:30] right? We need to be

[18:05] her and um she could find deliverance in
[18:09] that. So, let's remember her in prayer

[30:13] today?
[30:15] &gt;&gt; You can't please him without faith.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is believe and he
[30:21] will give. Amen. Hallelujah. But let's
[30:24] just stand. We're going to change order
[30:26] of service as our brother comes
[30:29] and one day we'll the redeemed will be
[30:32] gathering in. How many is looking
[30:34] forward to day that day? Amen.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; I am thinking of a rapture in this
[30:41] blessed home on high when they reign
[30:45] are gathering in.
[30:48] I will raise the heavenly anthem in that
[30:52] city in the sky. When the redeemed
[30:56] are gathering in that shoe. When the
[31:00] redeemed
[31:02] are gathering in
[31:05] wash like snow
[31:07] and free from all sin.
[31:10] How we'll shout
[31:13] and how we'll sing
[31:16] when the redeemed
[31:18] are gathering in.
[31:21] There will be a great possession over on
[31:25] the streets of gold. When the redeemed
[31:29] are gathering in.
[31:32] Oh, what music? Oh, what singing on the
[31:35] city will be rolled. When the redeemed
[31:40] are gathering in.
[31:42] When the redeemed
[31:45] are gathering in,
[31:48] washed like snow
[31:50] and free from all sin.
[31:53] I will shout hallelujah. And how we'll
[31:56] sing
[31:58] when the redeemed
[32:01] are gathering in.
[32:04] Saints will sing redemption story with
[32:07] their voices clear and strong. When the
[32:09] redeemed
[32:11] are gathering in,
[32:14] then the angels will be silent for they
[32:18] cannot sing that song. When the redeemed
[32:22] are gathering in.
[32:25] When the redeemed
[32:27] are gathering in,
[32:30] washed like snow
[32:32] and free from all sin.
[32:36] How we'll shout
[32:38] and how we'll sing.
[32:41] When a redeemed
[32:43] are gathering in,
[32:46] then the Savior will give orders to
[32:49] prepare the banquet board when the
[32:52] redeemed
[32:54] are gathering in.
[32:56] And we'll hear his invitation. Come ye
[33:00] blessed of the Lord, when the redeemed
[33:04] are gathering in.
[33:07] When the redeemed
[33:09] are gathering in,
[33:12] washed like snow
[33:14] and free from all sin.
[33:18] How will we shout
[33:20] and how we'll sing
[33:23] when the redeemed
[33:25] are gathering in?
[33:28] Hallelujah.
[33:30] Hallelujah. As our as our brother comes
[33:32] and as our brother John comes and gives
[33:34] us the word of life. Amen. Let's just
[33:37] sing.
[33:38] Amen. Know ye not. Amen. We are a temple
[33:42] of God. Amen.
[33:44] Know we not. Know ye not. Ye are a
[33:48] temple.
[33:50] Knowing not. Knowing not ye are a
[33:54] temple.
[33:56] Knowing not knowing that ye are a
[33:59] temple.
[34:01] Ye are a temple of the Holy Ghost.
[34:07] Yes, I know. Yes, I know. I am a temple.
[34:12] Yes, I know. Yes, I know. I am a temple.
[34:18] Yes, I know. Yes, I know I am a temple.
[34:23] I am a temple of the Holy Ghost.
[34:29] Walk ye up seven steps to perfection.
[34:34] Walk ye up seven steps to perfection.
[34:39] [Music]
[34:45] Ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[34:50] Full of praise, full of power, and full
[34:53] of glory.
[34:56] Full of praise, full of power, full of
[34:59] glory.
[35:01] full of praise, full of power, and full
[35:04] of glory.
[35:06] I am the temple of the whole. Amen.
[35:10] Let's sing that like we believe it now.
[35:12] Full of praise, full of power, and full
[35:15] of glory.
[35:17] Full of praise, full of power, and full
[35:20] of glory.
[35:23] Full of praise, full of power, and full
[35:26] of glory.
[35:28] I am the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[35:34] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for filling
[35:36] us up.
[35:40] Amen.
[35:42] Praise God.
[35:45] I'd rather be a vessel for God than a
[35:48] vessel for the devil.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; We're one or the other. We are one or
[35:53] the other.
[35:54] Um, men may think, "No, I don't want
[35:57] nothing to do with either of them." But
[36:00] in reality,
[36:02] there's only two spirits. Amen.
[36:05] What a privilege it is to be a temple
[36:08] for the Lord, a sanctuary for God to
[36:12] dwell in, and so he can through us. As
[36:16] brother Ron was so graciously saying,
[36:20] share Christ with the world.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's our responsibility until
[36:25] we're out of here. Amen. To be doing
[36:28] that. Well, God bless you today. It's
[36:31] good to be in the house of of God's
[36:33] prayer. Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I believe that we have uh
[36:38] Evelyn Lorie Sister and and Doug, God
[36:41] bless you. Good to have you here today.
[36:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[36:48] Amen. And what a blessing it is to see
[36:53] Um, Sister Brooke and
[37:00] you got you never had that one time
[37:01] where there's like a blanker.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Tyler, that's right.
[37:08] Blair, too. I know. That's That's just
[37:10] terrible. Well, God bless you, Blair.
[37:14] God bless your precious family. We think
[37:16] of you often. Pray for you. And it's
[37:18] good to have you back home. Amen. back
[37:21] in the house of the Lord. Um, you can
[37:24] see uh Doug and Evelyn that I'm not I'm
[37:28] not embarrassed. I'm not afraid to be
[37:29] embarrassed
[37:32] because that's just who I am.
[37:35] Amen. Well, let's turn in our our Bibles
[37:38] today to Matthew chapter 7.
[37:43] And really what that that is, Brother
[37:45] Tyler, is is is it's like you just got
[37:48] that little stage fright there. I still
[37:50] have that feel like the first time I've
[37:52] been ministering every time I come up
[37:54] here.
[37:55] Yes. It's a well we we trust we can't
[37:59] can't help it. Turn with me if you would
[38:01] to Matthew chapter 7. We're going to
[38:02] read just two verses there. Have a word
[38:05] of prayer and enter into the word of the
[38:07] Lord. Pray that this service will be an
[38:10] encouragement to all of us today.
[38:14] Amen. Jesus speaking here in St. Matthew
[38:17] chapter 7 verse 13. Enter ye in at the
[38:21] straight gate, for wide is the gate, and
[38:23] broad is the way which leadth to
[38:25] destruction, and and many people be
[38:29] which go in there at. Because straight
[38:32] is the gate, and narrow is the way which
[38:33] leadth unto life, and just a few people
[38:36] there be that find it. Amen. Very
[38:39] sobering. Let's look to God in prayer.
[38:41] Our heavenly father, we thank you, Lord,
[38:44] that there is a place that we can gather
[38:46] as brothers and sisters in Christ. that
[38:48] we hold the same precious faith, that we
[38:52] love you, that we love your salvation,
[38:56] that we're crying, "Grace, grace, grace,
[38:58] and full of praise, full of power, and
[39:02] full of glory, all because of your
[39:04] amazing grace today." And Lord, we thank
[39:07] you that we could express oursel in in
[39:11] this worship through song and chorus.
[39:13] And Lord, we just invite you now through
[39:17] not only the ministry of the word, but
[39:20] the receiving of the word. We need you
[39:22] for both. Lord, be the inspiration of
[39:25] our heart. Help us to get out of the way
[39:27] that you may speak to your people that
[39:30] you may nurture, strengthen, and guide
[39:32] them today, Lord, through thy word.
[39:35] Father, we ask that you'd remember um
[39:38] Lord our sister uh uh Amanda today that
[39:41] you just touch your body and that you
[39:44] would uh bring uh wellness to her body.
[39:47] We pray and Father, we just ask that
[39:49] you'd meet every need as we commit the
[39:52] service now into your hand in Jesus
[39:54] Christ's precious name. Amen. Amen. To
[39:57] God be all the glory. You may be seated.
[40:01] We want to entitle this message the road
[40:05] to wellness. No, the I'm sorry. The well
[40:08] the road to Wellville.
[40:10] It's a town. It's a place.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Wellville.
[40:16] Have you ever heard of it?
[40:19] Just know.
[40:22] It's not paved.
[40:25] And um Jesus here speaking in these
[40:28] scriptures entering at the straight
[40:30] gate.
[40:34] So it's a very narrow to even enter in
[40:38] the gate because there's only one way
[40:40] that leads to life. And narrow is the
[40:43] way.
[40:46] In other words, it's not paved. It's not
[40:49] easy. The word narrow here it means
[40:53] crowded with afflictions.
[40:56] So Jesus is saying enter the straight
[40:58] gate. It's crowded with afflictions
[41:01] with tribulations, troubles, pains,
[41:04] sorrows, challenges, afflictions.
[41:07] It's not easy, but it is the way which
[41:10] leadth to life.
[41:13] And the very fact that it's filled with
[41:15] all this stuff, not very many people are
[41:16] going to find it.
[41:19] It's not because Jesus is hard to get
[41:21] to. It's just the way to follow Jesus is
[41:25] not easy on the flesh.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; If a person wants to enter eternal life,
[41:32] it's more than just expressing a
[41:34] personal belief. It's more than just
[41:36] expressing um a repentance and baptism.
[41:40] It is u it's it's a difficult road to
[41:43] travel. If all we had to do was
[41:45] something at the beginning and then kind
[41:47] of go on living our life, it would be
[41:48] quite easy to enter in.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "It's he that endureth
[41:53] to the end, the same shall be saved, not
[41:56] he that starts the race."
[41:59] Starting is easy, but it's it's he who
[42:02] finishes the race.
[42:05] Let's say you're on the road to losing
[42:07] weight.
[42:08] Would you rather be able to take one
[42:12] pill a day and keep all the eating
[42:15] habits that you got?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Or would you rather change your complete
[42:20] diet,
[42:22] suffer throughout the day with all your
[42:24] cravings, have to exercise, have to make
[42:27] sure you're looking at food and
[42:28] constantly resisting? Oh, no. I can't
[42:30] have it. I can't have it. Which would
[42:32] you rather do?
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Take the one pill. I mean, it's just
[42:36] natural. is no different spiritually.
[42:39] Statist statistics show that many people
[42:43] stop their diets early. We all know that
[42:45] because we we're one of them. We're one
[42:47] of the statistics
[42:49] with one survey finding 40% of the
[42:52] people quit within a week.
[42:55] Four out of 10 people quit within a week
[42:59] and only 20% reaching the threemonth
[43:03] mark.
[43:05] So the road to Wellville is is not an
[43:09] easy road.
[43:13] What is needed to make it to the end
[43:17] is perseverance
[43:20] is uh dedication.
[43:22] I is is commitment is is faith is
[43:26] confidence.
[43:27] It's it's optimism. It's a right mental
[43:30] attitude. It will bring it to pass. The
[43:33] prophet said it's our way to get to
[43:35] Wellville. Mark Jesus said in Mark 9
[43:39] verse 23 if you want to write it down.
[43:41] Mark 9:23 if thou canst believe all
[43:46] things are possible to him that
[43:49] believeth.
[43:51] Whatever all things are possible if we
[43:55] can believe.
[43:57] Now that is
[43:59] that's that's so beautiful.
[44:02] That just opens the door of excitement.
[44:06] That opens the door to happiness.
[44:09] That opens the door to uh the pressure
[44:12] off
[44:14] because we have to walk this road that's
[44:16] this hard road and we got a lot of
[44:20] distractions and problems. But to know
[44:22] that the end result is as sure as God is
[44:25] sure, that's encouraging.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Does anybody remember the children's
[44:30] story book from the early 1900s, the
[44:33] little engine that could?
[44:37] &gt;&gt; There was a need to get some cargo train
[44:39] over the mountain and they needed an
[44:41] engine to pull it and they asked a few
[44:46] great engines that were very well known.
[44:50] engine one, they asked, "But he was too
[44:53] proud
[44:54] and he was concerned about his
[44:57] appearances to to go over the mountain."
[45:01] The big freight engine was too busy and
[45:05] bothful to take on the challenging task,
[45:08] and the rusty old engine was too tired
[45:10] and believed he couldn't move another
[45:13] inch.
[45:14] Now, when the locomotives didn't have
[45:16] the courage to go over the mountain,
[45:18] they asked this little blue engine. And
[45:20] this little blue engine had never faced
[45:22] a challenging task like this before. It
[45:24] had never pulled heavy a a heavy train
[45:27] before. And neither did it ever go over
[45:29] that mountain before. It wasn't built to
[45:32] haul heavy freight or or passengers and
[45:34] things like that.
[45:36] But with tremendous courage,
[45:39] determination, it a positive attitude to
[45:41] accept the challenge. And up the hill it
[45:44] went. And you know what it was saying
[45:45] when it was going up the hill, right?
[45:48] I think I can. I think I can. And it
[45:54] started out slow,
[45:56] but it started getting momentum.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Word upon word, faith upon here a
[46:03] little, there a little. I think I think
[46:05] I can. It started going and as it
[46:07] finally got the steam to get to the top.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; And when it got there, it said,
[46:16] "I knew I could.
[46:18] I knew I could."
[46:22] And we're all on this road. We've never
[46:24] been there before. We never got there.
[46:26] Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; But we've got to have the same
[46:29] confidence.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Because there's troubles and problems
[46:34] standing between us and Wellville.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Mark 11:24, "Therefore I
[46:41] say unto you, whatsoever things you
[46:44] desire when you pray, believe that you
[46:45] shall receive them, and ye shall have
[46:48] them."
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Whatever you desire
[46:52] when you pray,
[46:54] just believe and you'll have it. Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Now, it won't be easy and it won't be
[46:58] the next day,
[47:01] but God doesn't lie.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Put the desire of your heart on the
[47:07] table with God and believe for it. If
[47:11] you think you can, then you can.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; But if you don't think you can, you
[47:16] can't.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; It's It's really up to us.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; There were two blind men following Jesus
[47:23] desiring to be healed.
[47:25] cry and say, "Thou son of David, have
[47:28] mercy on us." I wonder how many times
[47:30] we've cried that in our lives. Have
[47:33] mercy upon us. And Jesus saith unto him,
[47:37] believe that I am able to do this.
[47:43] And they said unto him, "Yes, Lord." And
[47:47] Jesus touched them and saying,
[47:50] "According to your faith, be it unto
[47:54] you." Amen.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with me. Nothing to do
[47:57] with these unbelievers over here.
[48:01] But whatever you believe, be it unto
[48:04] you.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; You know what that does? It just it
[48:08] takes all the pressure off of me of
[48:10] worrying about what brother and sister
[48:12] are thinking about me
[48:15] &gt;&gt; or where they're going to make it or not
[48:17] going to make it. Though none go with
[48:19] me, I still I will follow.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] because I'm go I'm on my road to
[48:26] Wellville.
[48:30] Jesus can get us there.
[48:33] He can get us there. A Canaanite woman
[48:36] had desired for her her daughter
[48:40] a healing and and she cried unto Jesus
[48:43] these same words, "Have mercy on me, O
[48:46] Lord. Have mercy on me."
[48:50] She was in she cared about her children.
[48:54] Amen.
[48:55] And she was saying, "Have mercy on me
[48:57] because I love my children. I love my
[48:59] daughter." She was grievously vixed. And
[49:00] the Bible says that she worshiped Jesus,
[49:04] &gt;&gt; saying, "Lord, help me." Sometimes we
[49:06] come to church and we can't even lift
[49:08] our hands.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; We come to church as if we don't got any
[49:11] needs or something.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; I mean, we just need to get serious with
[49:14] God. We have not because we asked not.
[49:17] But we need to ask for God to help us.
[49:20] Amen. And even though Jesus did not come
[49:23] to meet her need, it's a true statement.
[49:26] She still had a a right mental attitude.
[49:30] And she said, "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs
[49:32] eat the crumbs which fall from the
[49:34] master's table." And Jesus said unto
[49:36] her, "Oh woman, great is thy faith. Be
[49:39] it unto thee, even as thou will.
[49:46] Be it unto you as you will.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; If you think you can, you can.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; If you don't think you can, you can't.
[49:54] If you think that I'm able to help you,
[49:56] I can. If you don't think I'm able to
[49:58] help you, then I can't.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change who God is.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Just changes the outcome for our lives.
[50:08] Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.
[50:12] Whatsoever things you desire when you
[50:14] pray, believe, and ye shall have them.
[50:18] Jesus can help us on the road to
[50:20] Wellville.
[50:23] Jesus saith unto the father who who was
[50:25] caring about his son, if thou canst
[50:27] believe, all things are possible to him
[50:30] that believeth. And straightway the
[50:31] father of the child cried out and with
[50:34] tears the Bible says, "Lord, I believe.
[50:37] Help thou my unbelief."
[50:40] &gt;&gt; I'm a human. I I know what I'm dealing
[50:42] with. It's not perfect in here, but you
[50:45] know what? I'm stepping out in faith.
[50:47] Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; We got to step out in faith. go beyond
[50:54] the complacency of our easy life that
[50:57] we're living
[50:59] because God is calling us
[51:02] to a greater thing.
[51:05] We're going to get into it the second
[51:06] half of the service, but he's I'll just
[51:08] say it like this. He's calling us to be
[51:10] in his image.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; We have to work through our unbelief. We
[51:16] have to work through our our
[51:17] afflictions, our troubles, our pains,
[51:19] our sorrows, our our our challenges, our
[51:22] difficulties. We have to work our way
[51:24] all the way to Wellville. I think I can
[51:28] all the way. Press towards the mark. The
[51:31] the ang that voice told brother Brand,
[51:32] "Keep pressing in. Keep pressing. There
[51:35] is nothing else to do. We got to press.
[51:37] As soon as you stop pressing, I'm going
[51:39] to tell you what happens. When you stop
[51:41] pressing, you go backwards.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; You do not stand still. You never stand
[51:47] still." The prophet of God says, "You
[51:49] never leave church the way you came.
[51:52] There is no standing still. It's either
[51:55] closer to God pressing in or you're
[51:57] backsliding. Don't even realize it.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 23:7 says, "As for as a man
[52:07] thinkketh in his heart,
[52:10] &gt;&gt; so is he." Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; If you truly know,
[52:19] if you know, you you say, "I think I
[52:23] can. I think I can. I think I can. I
[52:27] know I can."
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And you can. But if you think in your
[52:32] heart,
[52:35] "I don't think I can ever get rid of
[52:36] this problem.
[52:39] This thing's been with me too long.
[52:42] I just don't think I can ever forgive.
[52:46] I just don't think I can love with an
[52:49] unconditional
[52:50] love, a perfect love. I just I don't
[52:53] think I can, you know, really be what
[52:56] I'm supposed to be. I I I I don't think
[52:59] I can I can do what is being asked of
[53:03] me. If that is what you think in your
[53:07] heart, so is it.
[53:12] But if there's someone here today
[53:16] &gt;&gt; with some confidence that can go beyond
[53:19] their human intellect and look to the
[53:22] word of God, all things are possible to
[53:25] him that believeth.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say in your heart
[53:31] &gt;&gt; as a man thinkketh in his heart. It's
[53:33] why it's important to guard your heart.
[53:38] Don't let doubt, though some may dwell
[53:40] where these abound, my prayer, my aim is
[53:43] higher ground.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ who
[53:50] strengthenth me. If that's in your
[53:52] heart, then you can do all things.
[53:57] God told Joshua, "Nothing shall be
[53:59] nothing shall ever nothing shall be able
[54:02] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[54:03] life.
[54:06] Wherever the souls of your feet shall
[54:08] tread upon, it shall be yours. If you're
[54:10] thinking that mountain is mine, then you
[54:13] you go after it and that mountain will
[54:15] be yours.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; But if you say those giants, they're a
[54:19] little too big for me. I can't handle my
[54:21] problem.
[54:23] You can't handle the problem then.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; What you're saying is God is not strong
[54:28] enough in me. Because I'm telling you,
[54:30] God is able to do exceedingly above all
[54:33] that we would think or ask of him to do.
[54:36] That's the God we serve. We don't serve
[54:39] some dead God.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; He's a living God.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; He's got power. And we just sung the
[54:47] song. It wasn't just a nice song to
[54:49] sing. There was a message in it. Full of
[54:52] grace, full of power, full of glory.
[54:56] We're full of God today, saints.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; In our heart, we should be full of God.
[55:02] There should be There's Is anything too
[55:05] hard for the Lord?
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Nothing's too hard for God.
[55:17] Philippians 1:6, "Being confident of
[55:20] this very thing, that he which have
[55:22] begun a good work in you will perform it
[55:25] until the day of Jesus Christ."
[55:28] Remain confident that Jesus Christ will
[55:31] see you all the way to Wellville.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is that you're
[55:35] desiring, what it is that you want, God
[55:37] will see you through.
[55:40] You have, but as you thinkketh in your
[55:43] heart, so shall it be. This has nothing
[55:46] to do I'm going to just get this real
[55:48] straight. This has nothing to do with
[55:52] God's will.
[55:56] This has everything Jesus said it has
[55:58] everything to do with your faith. It has
[56:01] everything to do with your confession.
[56:05] The Bible tells us that he is the inter
[56:09] intercession and it he intercedes upon
[56:11] the profession of our faith.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; So if we're saying he can then he can if
[56:18] we're saying I don't know it may not be
[56:20] God's will.
[56:24] That sounds to me like I'd rather go
[56:26] down drowning
[56:29] &gt;&gt; claiming God's will
[56:32] &gt;&gt; because he told me to.
[56:34] He didn't say, "Look, I made you all
[56:36] smart. You figure out what the will of
[56:37] God is for all the for all the
[56:39] promises." No. Every promise in the book
[56:43] is mine. Every chapter, every verse,
[56:45] every line, it's the devil that tells
[56:48] you you can't have victory.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; It's God saying there's victory ahead.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; It's at Wellville. You just keep
[56:55] marching forward. And I'm going to tell
[56:56] you, I'd be honest with you. I know this
[56:58] road is hard. We just read it. But the
[57:01] thing is, you know how you build up
[57:04] momentum
[57:05] that train
[57:07] that arm just I think I can
[57:13] I can when you go and you overcome one
[57:18] thing you're just faithful to get up and
[57:20] pray whatever it might be. Yeah. One
[57:23] thing it just now you got some momentum.
[57:25] You don't have to try as hard the second
[57:26] time. Amen.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; It's you're building self-esteem.
[57:32] You're building your confidence. You're
[57:34] building yourself up. Look, you either
[57:36] let the devil tear you down or you'll
[57:38] fight the good fight of faith and you'll
[57:40] press in. That's it.
[57:44] We can't sit here and and expect God to
[57:47] do it all.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; God's looking for the one thing he can't
[57:52] do, and that's go through your free
[57:54] moral agency.
[57:56] But when your freemore agency can agree
[57:58] with the word of God and say for me in
[58:01] my house I'll serve the Lord.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Then all things are going to be possible
[58:05] in home.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; We sing that song. I am one of the few.
[58:10] Yes, one of the few. And by faith in
[58:13] God's word I can claim it. Though the
[58:17] way may seem long to Wellville
[58:22] and the opposition is strong for the
[58:25] bride there's a way provided.
[58:29] But just to hope
[58:32] it will not do. We must be fully
[58:36] persuaded
[58:37] to follow the Lord. How do we do that?
[58:40] By obeying the word and just believe
[58:43] that I am one of the few.
[58:46] I mean, we sing these songs, but do we
[58:48] realize the message in these songs?
[58:52] &gt;&gt; You could literally come to church and
[58:54] have a double sermon
[58:55] &gt;&gt; just entering into the message of the
[58:57] worship.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Paul told Timothy in his hour of fear
[59:03] when he was ashamed of suffering
[59:05] afflictions because of this straight
[59:08] this narrow this straight a gate narrow
[59:11] way.
[59:13] So he didn't he didn't like suffering as
[59:15] a Christian and he was fearful and he
[59:19] got ashamed and Paul told him in 2
[59:22] Timothy 1:12
[59:24] for the which cause I also suffer these
[59:29] things. So Paul suffered the same things
[59:32] as Timothy.
[59:33] For the which cause I also suffer these
[59:36] things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I love that. Sister Linda, I am not
[59:43] ashamed. I am not ashamed.
[59:47] For I know whom I have believed and am
[59:52] persuaded that he is able to keep that
[59:54] which I have committed unto him against
[59:57] that day.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, he's going to Wellville.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And he was persuaded he was going to get
[1:00:03] there. He wasn't going to allow um some
[1:00:08] afflictions, some persecutions,
[1:00:10] some some some things that were hard. I
[1:00:14] know they're hard, but to keep them
[1:00:16] down,
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; you got to be determined. I'm one of the
[1:00:20] few. I'm going through.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; You must be fully persuaded. You can't
[1:00:25] be halfway.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; You can't say, you know, I'm thinking,
[1:00:28] you know, I'm thinking about trying this
[1:00:30] out. Put my foot in the water.
[1:00:34] Make a decision. Dive in or don't.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet said. He said,
[1:00:40] "If you can't come hook, line, and
[1:00:43] sinker,
[1:00:46] then don't come at all."
[1:00:49] Because it takes that to make it. There
[1:00:52] are so many people who started the race
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; that fell out along the way.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; There is very few that go to the end.
[1:01:03] Now, there will be many that come to him
[1:01:05] and say, 'Lord, Lord, didn't I do these
[1:01:07] things? How about me? There'll be those.
[1:01:11] But that ain't making it to the end.
[1:01:13] Because the end is when we come to
[1:01:16] church and we hear all the word. Man
[1:01:19] shall live by every word of God that p
[1:01:22] that every word that proceeds out of the
[1:01:24] mouth of God. Whatever that message
[1:01:26] said, we're we believe it. And when you
[1:01:29] take in the word of God and you don't
[1:01:31] leave part of it out, that's you getting
[1:01:34] to the end of Wellville
[1:01:36] because the world is full of
[1:01:39] denominations and the people become
[1:01:41] their own denomination. Well, this is
[1:01:43] what I believe.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; This is all I have to do.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; God knows my heart.
[1:01:49] Like God's looking to see for fruit. In
[1:01:52] fact, he wants your fruit to remain.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; He wants you out there on the front
[1:01:57] line.
[1:01:59] sharing Jesus Christ and the love of God
[1:02:01] with others. Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:19, Abraham speaking here. He
[1:02:07] says,"Abraham being not weak in faith,
[1:02:11] he considered not his own body, now
[1:02:14] being dead when he was a hund years old,
[1:02:16] neither the yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:02:18] womb." The Bible says, "He staggered not
[1:02:21] at the promise of God through unbelief,
[1:02:24] but was strong in faith, giving glory to
[1:02:27] God."
[1:02:29] I love this testimony. And being fully
[1:02:32] persuaded
[1:02:33] that what he had promised, he he was
[1:02:36] able also to perform what he promised.
[1:02:40] And therefore, it was imputed unto him
[1:02:42] for righteousness. It wasn't just,
[1:02:44] "Well, I repented and I got baptized and
[1:02:46] I'm righteous now."
[1:02:48] No,
[1:02:51] God made him go through the test of what
[1:02:55] 25 years.
[1:02:57] And through the 25 years, he had to
[1:03:00] remain strong.
[1:03:02] He had to remain fully persuaded. He had
[1:03:05] to remain having the testimony that I
[1:03:08] think I can. I think I can. I think I
[1:03:10] can. Brother Bram used to illustrate
[1:03:14] when he's talking to Sarah. Sarah, do
[1:03:15] you feel anything moving inside? No, I
[1:03:17] don't. Would you just keep making those
[1:03:19] booties because he is for sure coming.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; The promise is coming. And that's what
[1:03:24] we need a little bit more in our homes
[1:03:26] is headship. Come on. We need headship
[1:03:28] in our home saying God is going to bring
[1:03:31] his promises to pass.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Have too much jellyfish stuff going
[1:03:36] around.
[1:03:41] Don't stagger
[1:03:44] at any promise of God through unbelief.
[1:03:47] Be strong in faith. Fight the good fight
[1:03:49] of faith. Give glory to God with every
[1:03:52] step on the road to Wellville.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Learn to testify every day. Get up. God
[1:03:59] gave me breath. He's still not done with
[1:04:01] me today.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Give him glory.
[1:04:05] Walk
[1:04:07] with persuasion.
[1:04:09] Walk with confidence.
[1:04:11] Don't walk with pride. Don't walk with
[1:04:14] arrogancy. Don't walk with an ego. Don't
[1:04:16] walk with thinking you're something. No.
[1:04:19] Walk knowing God is inside of you.
[1:04:23] You be humble and confident at the same
[1:04:25] time.
[1:04:27] How many are marching in the footsteps
[1:04:29] of Abraham,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; right? To the to the road to Wellville.
[1:04:34] Because the Bible says that that we walk
[1:04:36] in the steps of our of our father
[1:04:38] Abraham, then we are literally children
[1:04:40] of Abraham by doing one thing, walking
[1:04:42] in the steps of our father Abraham. And
[1:04:45] what were those steps? He just believed
[1:04:47] God.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; And when you believe God, that is the
[1:04:50] evidence that you're a son of Abraham.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Keep walking.
[1:04:58] I want to get to an important part of
[1:05:00] the message and that's about right. It's
[1:05:02] about half. So, we're about midway. This
[1:05:04] is just just turned out perfect.
[1:05:08] Now, as long as the second half just,
[1:05:10] you know, doesn't get extended. You
[1:05:11] know, that can sometimes happen.
[1:05:14] I want to make this statement. I want to
[1:05:17] embraed in your heart and your brain. We
[1:05:22] become the express image of what we
[1:05:24] believe.
[1:05:26] We become the express image of what we
[1:05:29] believe.
[1:05:31] What we believe in our heart is what we
[1:05:34] will become.
[1:05:37] If we have an image in our mind that we
[1:05:39] can't overcome something, then we won't.
[1:05:42] If we have this image that we don't see
[1:05:45] ourselves victorious, then we probably
[1:05:46] never will.
[1:05:48] If we have this image that we can't
[1:05:50] love, then we probably can't love. I
[1:05:53] can't get rid of this hatred. I then we
[1:05:55] can't get rid of it. We become the
[1:05:58] express image of what we believe. Why
[1:06:01] that is so important to know what you're
[1:06:04] believing.
[1:06:09] John said in 1 John 11 verse 11 just
[1:06:13] that's where this hole next to the rest
[1:06:15] is just going to be on this so you don't
[1:06:18] have to try to wonder where I'm at. He
[1:06:20] came unto his own his own people and his
[1:06:23] own did not receive him. They said nope.
[1:06:29] But as many as did receive him, which
[1:06:32] were not his own, but as many as
[1:06:36] received him, to them, to that group of
[1:06:38] people, he gave power to become the sons
[1:06:42] of God, even to them that believed
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; on his name.
[1:06:49] You become the express image of what you
[1:06:52] believe.
[1:06:56] You know, the whole world, the whole
[1:06:58] world that goes to hell,
[1:07:01] not one of them will be there
[1:07:06] because they didn't have a chance.
[1:07:11] God gives everybody a chance. And if I
[1:07:14] understand God in my life, he gives me
[1:07:17] more chances than what I deserve.
[1:07:19] Brother Orlando,
[1:07:24] This statement is so crucial that we
[1:07:27] become the express image of what we
[1:07:29] believe. We must believe what the word
[1:07:31] says about us more than how we feel
[1:07:34] about oursel.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; So when you believe what the word tells
[1:07:38] you that greater is he that's in me than
[1:07:41] he that's in the world. When you feel
[1:07:44] like man I don't even feel like anything
[1:07:46] today. I feel like a wet noodle.
[1:07:48] I don't feel like I got anything. You
[1:07:51] say what the word says.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; You deny your feelings. You deny your
[1:07:56] emotions.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You you deny that intellect, that that
[1:08:00] tree of knowledge of good and evil that
[1:08:02] says um
[1:08:05] that you're you're not going to make it.
[1:08:11] And you humble yourself to the word of
[1:08:12] God.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; And you say, "By the grace of God, I'm
[1:08:16] going to make it.
[1:08:18] I'm going to overcome
[1:08:21] because greater is he that's in me.
[1:08:29] If we do not have the correct image in
[1:08:31] our mind of what we're to become,
[1:08:35] I say this, no matter how much it hurts,
[1:08:38] humble yourself and change the image
[1:08:40] that's in your mind. Amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; I've talked to people and I you try
[1:08:45] telling them something and they don't
[1:08:47] want to hear it.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And all you're trying to do is tell them
[1:08:52] what the image is,
[1:08:58] but it's like they don't want it.
[1:09:01] How are you going to become How are you
[1:09:03] going to hit Wellville if you don't get
[1:09:05] in your heart and mind what Wellville
[1:09:07] really is?
[1:09:11] And I want that to sink in very deep.
[1:09:13] We've got to be serious about changing
[1:09:16] how we think about what the image of God
[1:09:20] is for our lives.
[1:09:24] It is serious to understand that we must
[1:09:27] have the correct image in our mind. We
[1:09:29] must have the correct image of Christ.
[1:09:31] We must have the correct image of what
[1:09:33] we're to become. We must have the
[1:09:34] correct image of what we should be
[1:09:36] doing. It should be clear as day. We
[1:09:39] shouldn't be walking around floating
[1:09:41] wondering who am I, where am I at, how I
[1:09:43] should be living, what should I be
[1:09:45] striving for, is this okay, is this not
[1:09:47] okay?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; We we barely have time to get ready. I
[1:09:52] if I understand the scriptures, if if um
[1:09:56] the righteous scarcely make it,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; yeah. So, if they scarcely make it, that
[1:10:02] means they are pressing in. God, show me
[1:10:06] what I need to be doing.
[1:10:09] They don't they don't you know the the
[1:10:11] righteous don't get in f uh 20 you know
[1:10:14] 20 years before the rapture and they
[1:10:16] coast the last 20 years
[1:10:20] you know well I got baptized I repented
[1:10:22] I'm saved no matter what you know once
[1:10:23] saved always saved can you show me that
[1:10:25] scripture
[1:10:27] you know you may better to take some
[1:10:29] certain scriptures and try to prove that
[1:10:31] point but when you do that you literally
[1:10:34] have to deny other scriptures
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:10:39] And that's why the whole word or our
[1:10:42] doctrine must dovetail from cover to
[1:10:45] cover.
[1:10:47] Now Jesus not John said in 1 John 3
[1:10:51] verse number one
[1:10:54] talking about the image. Now we're
[1:10:56] staying in this this theme. How many's
[1:10:58] with me? Say amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold what manner of love the
[1:11:03] father has just bestowed upon us. all of
[1:11:06] us here that we should become the that
[1:11:10] we should be called the sons of God.
[1:11:13] Therefore, the world out there, the
[1:11:16] worldly people knoweth us not because it
[1:11:19] knew him not. And I do want to say this,
[1:11:22] not just the worldly people out there
[1:11:24] don't know us, but this worldly nature
[1:11:28] in here doesn't know Christ. Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; So there is a very vast difference to my
[1:11:36] carnality in God's spirituality.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Beloved, now are we the sons of God. Now
[1:11:43] are we the sons of God. But let's be
[1:11:46] honest, it does not yet appear what we
[1:11:48] shall be.
[1:11:50] But we know that when he comes down to
[1:11:53] get his bride,
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; we shall be like him. For we shall see
[1:11:59] him as he is.
[1:12:01] That's why it's important for us to see
[1:12:03] him as he is.
[1:12:06] Who is he? How is he? Is he what I
[1:12:09] think? Is God what I think? Is God what
[1:12:12] brother Ben thinks?
[1:12:16] God is what the word says God is.
[1:12:20] That's this is
[1:12:23] Bible says that Jesus Christ is in the
[1:12:25] image of God. Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; And God sent a prophet to let us know
[1:12:31] what this really says, the
[1:12:33] interpretation of this.
[1:12:36] And you know, it dovetales.
[1:12:39] It doesn't hit any walls.
[1:12:42] It doesn't It's not a new doctrine. It's
[1:12:45] not an addition to the Bible.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Nothing like that. It's the opening of
[1:12:50] the word to the bride
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; because man shall add shall not add one
[1:12:56] word to it or his part will be taken out
[1:12:59] of the book of life and he shall not add
[1:13:02] to the word or plagues will be added to
[1:13:06] his life.
[1:13:09] This word
[1:13:11] is what the bride is looking at who she
[1:13:14] is.
[1:13:16] Now, it doesn't yet appear because
[1:13:18] obviously there's certain things in our
[1:13:19] lives that are not reflecting the word.
[1:13:22] But her attitude is this is really
[1:13:24] important to me. I'm going to go to
[1:13:25] church. I'm going to get prepared. I'm
[1:13:26] going to get serious because I want the
[1:13:27] revelation of the word so I can become
[1:13:29] the word.
[1:13:31] You know, where you go down the road,
[1:13:33] brother Ron's telling me he's passing
[1:13:34] churches and they're flooded with
[1:13:36] people,
[1:13:37] but you know, it's a false image of what
[1:13:41] they're looking to become.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] the blind are leading the blind. They're
[1:13:46] all going to fall in the ditch.
[1:13:51] I remember
[1:13:54] when I was wanted to know God, I tried
[1:13:57] church after church after church. Even
[1:13:59] in the churches, I was having meetings
[1:14:01] with the priest and wanting to get in
[1:14:03] the word and have a Bible study. And all
[1:14:05] I could really get from him was the
[1:14:08] pope. The pope. The pope. Like, forget
[1:14:10] about what Jesus is saying. And the Pope
[1:14:12] has supernatural authority over the word
[1:14:14] of God.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And something inside of me says, "Look,
[1:14:18] I'm not basing my salvation on a man.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; I'll stay with the word.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Been the best decision I've ever made.
[1:14:34] But now are we the sons of God." I want
[1:14:36] to read that again. And it does not
[1:14:37] appear what we shall be, but we know
[1:14:39] that when he shall appear, we shall be
[1:14:41] like him, for we shall see him as he is.
[1:14:43] Now, you got this image here. And every
[1:14:45] man that has this hope inside of him,
[1:14:50] he's actually purifying himself even as
[1:14:53] he's pure. In other words, he's becoming
[1:14:55] into the image that he sees.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; He's not afraid to go to church and say,
[1:15:02] "I want to knock off some of this flesh
[1:15:04] today.
[1:15:06] He's not afraid to go to church and say,
[1:15:08] "I want to be changed from glory onto
[1:15:11] glory. I want to become more like Jesus,
[1:15:13] to be like Jesus." He sings that song
[1:15:15] from his heart.
[1:15:19] There's a realness there to the
[1:15:20] believer. The bride of Christ
[1:15:25] has something inside of her. And that's
[1:15:27] I see the image of who God is. And now I
[1:15:30] am to become like that.
[1:15:34] And if you think you can, you can.
[1:15:38] And if you don't think you can, you
[1:15:41] can't. And all the encouragement of the
[1:15:44] world can't get you there.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You can have all the encouragement of
[1:15:50] the world. It can't get you there.
[1:15:53] Encouragement is really meant to be
[1:15:56] short-lived.
[1:15:58] What will get you there is faith. I'll
[1:16:00] get back to that. Faith is what gets you
[1:16:02] there, not encouragement.
[1:16:05] God told Joshua, "Look, I'm with you.
[1:16:08] Wheresoever you goeth. Don't be afraid.
[1:16:10] Don't be dismayed. I am with you."
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; God was encouraging him. But you notice
[1:16:17] that was shortlived because he had to
[1:16:19] step back and he had to go into the
[1:16:21] battle. He had to go take the land. He
[1:16:24] had to face the giants himself.
[1:16:30] God gives but man has to take.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for encouragement. But you
[1:16:37] know what? We're living in a world where
[1:16:38] we hardly get encouragement.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; You know what we get, sister? We get
[1:16:42] discouragement.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; We get dis discouragement. Everybody
[1:16:47] discourages us.
[1:16:50] I can't believe you're not living for
[1:16:52] me.
[1:16:56] You know what, brother Ben? The Bible
[1:16:59] says you got to live for me. You better
[1:17:02] do it. I'm going to let you know. And
[1:17:04] you're not living for me. It discourages
[1:17:06] me.
[1:17:09] It's amazing how Satan likes to take the
[1:17:11] word and twist it.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Twist it.
[1:17:18] But a pure heart, blessed are the pure
[1:17:20] in heart, for they shall see God.
[1:17:24] They that have this hope in they that
[1:17:26] have this hope inside of them. They that
[1:17:28] are they want to purify themselves.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You know, it's time for us to to get
[1:17:35] more serious with God. Don't you think?
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I think it's late in the hour or living
[1:17:40] in a late hour.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Honestly, no matter what we got going on
[1:17:44] in life, nothing is more important than
[1:17:46] making a rapture. Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And before we make a rapture, we can we
[1:17:52] got to get into his image because God is
[1:17:54] not going to marry some I don't care
[1:17:57] bride.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; He's going to marry a bride without
[1:18:02] spot, without wrinkle. And it's going to
[1:18:05] be more than his blood doing it.
[1:18:11] She's going to have to fall in love with
[1:18:13] what that blood
[1:18:16] paid for. Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; God gave his life
[1:18:24] that his word could come and live inside
[1:18:25] of us.
[1:18:28] And if we're each day not embracing that
[1:18:32] word and saying, "God, come into my
[1:18:34] heart. God, I love you. God, I want more
[1:18:36] of you." Because it can come. Now,
[1:18:38] before Calvary, it couldn't came.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; But that word can come in. He said,
[1:18:42] "I'll write my laws in their hearts and
[1:18:44] in their minds.
[1:18:46] I'll put my spirit in them. But if say,
[1:18:49] "No, I don't want to do that. I want to
[1:18:50] do my own thing. I just want to do it my
[1:18:53] way." Well, your way is not going to get
[1:18:56] you to Wellville.
[1:19:00] Your way is going to get you to unwell.
[1:19:05] Everyone that goes to hell is not
[1:19:07] excited.
[1:19:09] I don't think there'll be one person.
[1:19:11] I'm so glad I went my way. I'm so glad I
[1:19:14] didn't listen to my mom. I didn't listen
[1:19:16] to my dad. I didn't listen to the word.
[1:19:18] I didn't listen.
[1:19:20] There ain't anybody's going to be Come
[1:19:22] on, everybody. Hell, let's let's just I
[1:19:24] want to encourage you. You made the
[1:19:25] right decision.
[1:19:31] The devil's out to get us.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; He's vicious. He don't care. Anytime you
[1:19:36] see a spirit of I don't care, it is the
[1:19:39] devil in flesh.
[1:19:42] It is the manifestation of the spirit of
[1:19:46] evil in flesh. Don't ever have a spirit
[1:19:49] of I don't care. Never. I don't care
[1:19:52] what anybody ever does to you.
[1:19:57] Jesus never said I don't care.
[1:20:01] He never projected an attitude of I
[1:20:04] don't care.
[1:20:06] He was hanging on the cross suffering.
[1:20:09] And he cared about his mother. He cared
[1:20:12] about his disciple John.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; For the joy that was set before me
[1:20:18] endured the cross. He cared.
[1:20:23] I'm telling you, you feel, you know,
[1:20:25] because there's feelings, right? We all
[1:20:27] have feelings. When you start to feel a
[1:20:30] feeling of I don't care, run. That's the
[1:20:32] devil inside.
[1:20:37] Call that thing out and say, "Satan, get
[1:20:39] out of my mind. Get out of my body. Get
[1:20:41] out of my feelings. I choose to care."
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Because that's the image of God.
[1:20:51] That is the image of God is to care. God
[1:20:55] cared. For God so loved the world that
[1:20:58] he gave.
[1:20:59] That is the image of God.
[1:21:03] And if we're to become that same image,
[1:21:05] then we're supposed to care.
[1:21:08] Care about everything.
[1:21:11] Care about our family. Care about souls.
[1:21:16] Care about our brothers and sisters.
[1:21:19] Care about the lost.
[1:21:21] Care about the hurting.
[1:21:26] Care care about Well, brother John, what
[1:21:29] if somebody hits me in the, you know,
[1:21:30] hits me with their attitude? What do you
[1:21:32] expect me to do? Just stand there and
[1:21:34] take it? I don't expect you to do that.
[1:21:37] The word expects you to do that.
[1:21:39] Turn the cheek.
[1:21:42] Offenses are going to come. Wo to them
[1:21:44] by who they come. But remember, it's not
[1:21:47] the action but the reaction.
[1:21:49] The image of Christ is for us to lay
[1:21:51] down our life and live for others.
[1:21:54] Now, I know it's a hard pill to swallow.
[1:21:56] That's why the prophet said, "Whatever
[1:21:57] you do, lay aside everything that you
[1:21:59] think's important going on in your life
[1:22:01] and get perfect love. Get to a place
[1:22:03] where you can love everybody, even your
[1:22:05] enemy."
[1:22:08] Now, I know it's a hard pill to swallow,
[1:22:10] but if you don't keep that image there,
[1:22:12] you won't be trying. You'll be making
[1:22:14] excuses of why you don't do what you do.
[1:22:18] Genesis 1 26. Now, now you got to put on
[1:22:22] your prayer your prayers for me because
[1:22:27] I think I just put like four pages of
[1:22:28] notes on it. I
[1:22:31] left my my path to Wellville.
[1:22:35] Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, let us
[1:22:38] make man in our image
[1:22:42] after our likeness, and let he let them
[1:22:45] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[1:22:47] over the fowl of the air, the cattle,
[1:22:49] and the all over the earth, and all and
[1:22:52] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:22:54] upon the earth." So God created man in
[1:22:56] his own image, and the image of God
[1:22:58] created he him, male and female created
[1:23:00] he them. A lot could be said about this,
[1:23:02] but the main point I want to bring here
[1:23:04] is that God said, "Let us make man in
[1:23:06] our image," not a different image, not
[1:23:09] half human and half God,
[1:23:12] not half sinful, half holy. Let us make
[1:23:16] man in our image. And God blessed them.
[1:23:20] And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and
[1:23:22] multiply, and replenish the earth, and
[1:23:25] subdue it. Have dominion over the fishes
[1:23:27] of the sea, the fowl of the air, and
[1:23:28] every living thing that moveth upon the
[1:23:30] earth." God's original intention was to
[1:23:33] have a bunch of humans walking around on
[1:23:35] earth that are just like him.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; That was God's original original plan.
[1:23:47] Now
[1:23:50] his intention and his plan has never
[1:23:53] changed.
[1:23:56] He doesn't have a plan B.
[1:23:59] Well, that didn't work.
[1:24:04] Well, we might as well just let him be
[1:24:06] sinful. That'll be, you know, good
[1:24:08] enough. Like a teacher grading on a
[1:24:12] curve because the whole class did bad.
[1:24:15] or God never said, "Well, if we can't if
[1:24:18] we can't beat them, you know, let's join
[1:24:20] them."
[1:24:24] Well, there isn't no, "Well, we'll just
[1:24:27] settle for the best that we can get out
[1:24:28] of them." He never said that. He never
[1:24:31] thought that. When God's word goes
[1:24:34] forth, it will not return unto him void.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And no matter how much Satan messed up
[1:24:40] the plan, God will have a bride in his
[1:24:44] image. He will have a bride without spot
[1:24:47] and without wrinkle before he returns.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; And you know who it's going to go to?
[1:24:51] It's going to go to those who believe in
[1:24:54] the same thing that God said.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He's not calling favorites. He's not
[1:24:59] calling me because my name is John
[1:25:01] Martin and you know he's got blue eyes.
[1:25:05] It really doesn't matter if I wear a
[1:25:08] tie, don't wear a tie. Doesn't matter if
[1:25:10] I'm fit, not fit.
[1:25:13] Nothing matters. Does it matter?
[1:25:16] I like
[1:25:18] Chevrolet or Ford,
[1:25:21] apple pie or peacon pie, chocolate chip
[1:25:24] cookies or molasses.
[1:25:27] The only thing matters is does my life
[1:25:29] line up with the word.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; And the only way that's ever going to
[1:25:34] happen is not by what's preached behind
[1:25:36] this pulpit,
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; but what's inside your heart to become.
[1:25:42] What image is inside of you? What are
[1:25:44] you visualizing as a man? Think it so is
[1:25:47] he?
[1:25:51] We must have the correct image of who
[1:25:54] God is.
[1:25:56] How else will we know what to become?
[1:25:59] If we think God is some daddy old
[1:26:01] grandpa that, you know, whatever,
[1:26:04] whatever, whatever you want, I'll just
[1:26:06] give it to you. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to
[1:26:07] spoil you. Some Santa Claus. Give, give,
[1:26:11] give, give. Meet all your needs.
[1:26:15] Just, just it's all about you. It's not
[1:26:18] about me.
[1:26:20] But Jesus said, if you love me, it is
[1:26:22] about me. You'll keep my commandments.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It's a relationship.
[1:26:30] Remember, every seed brings forth of its
[1:26:32] kind, including God's seed. That means
[1:26:36] if we are the seed of God, we're going
[1:26:39] to become like God.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he
[1:26:48] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:26:51] the image of the of of this I'm sorry.
[1:26:57] Uh of the son. I'm just going to get it
[1:27:00] up here. The image of his son. My word
[1:27:03] got cut off. that he might be the
[1:27:04] firstborn among what? Many brethren.
[1:27:09] So, they're going to be just like Jesus.
[1:27:14] If we've been predestinated, then we're
[1:27:16] going to be conformed.
[1:27:20] That doesn't mean lay back on a hammock.
[1:27:24] It means
[1:27:27] jointly form. That's you agreeing with
[1:27:31] God about who you are.
[1:27:37] That's God saying to each one of us
[1:27:39] individually, if you can believe, be it
[1:27:42] unto you as as thou believe, as thou
[1:27:46] wilt. If you believe that you're my
[1:27:49] daughter, that you're my son, be it unto
[1:27:52] you.
[1:27:57] I believe what we need is to take a
[1:28:00] stand. Because if you don't take a stand
[1:28:03] against the devil, he's going to lay
[1:28:05] he's going to just
[1:28:07] cradle you in Le Oysia.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Nothing matters. You don't even have to
[1:28:13] go to church.
[1:28:15] You just do what you want to do. You're
[1:28:16] still
[1:28:20] Brother Brandham said, pinch your
[1:28:22] conscience.
[1:28:24] Pinch it.
[1:28:28] There's a people who believe this. They
[1:28:30] believe they're predestined. They're
[1:28:32] called. They're chosen. They're elected
[1:28:33] by God's fornowledge to be in the same
[1:28:36] image. They have the correct image of
[1:28:39] what God is. Therefore, they have a
[1:28:41] correct vision for their lives because
[1:28:43] they know who God is. They have a hope
[1:28:45] inside of them that's purifying them by
[1:28:47] the word of God. They are meditating
[1:28:49] upon the word day and night. They're
[1:28:51] working out their own salvation with
[1:28:52] fear and trembling. The bride of Christ
[1:28:56] doesn't sit around without a vision what
[1:28:58] they should be doing. They are being
[1:29:01] conformed to the image of Jesus Christ
[1:29:06] because Jesus wants to be the firstborn
[1:29:09] among many brethren.
[1:29:14] It's awful quiet in here.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; So if we don't start saying amen, then
[1:29:19] we're going to step up and do what do
[1:29:21] they call that where you're doing
[1:29:22] exercises? calisthetics.
[1:29:27] Remember, just like the children of
[1:29:28] Israel coming out of Egypt, it was a
[1:29:30] mixed multitude.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; So, the church in the last days
[1:29:35] coming out of a worldly denomination.
[1:29:38] The world worldly church feels this I'm
[1:29:42] in need of nothing lukewarm, complacent
[1:29:45] feeling, not recognizing fully that
[1:29:48] they're wretched, miserable, poor,
[1:29:50] blind, naked. Don't tell me what to do.
[1:29:54] I can make it without oil in my lamp. I
[1:29:56] don't need to be counseledled. You know,
[1:29:59] they got this attitude when you try to
[1:30:01] tell them what the word is expecting of
[1:30:03] them that that they got this defiant
[1:30:05] attitude.
[1:30:09] But God gave them some counsel. Anyways,
[1:30:12] in Revelations 3:18, he says, "I counsel
[1:30:15] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:30:18] that thou mayest be rich
[1:30:21] and white raignment that thou mayest be
[1:30:23] clothed, and that the shame of thy
[1:30:25] nakedness do not appear, and anoint
[1:30:27] thine eyes with eyes, that thou mayest
[1:30:29] see. And as many as I love, I rebuke and
[1:30:33] chasten. Be zealous, therefore,
[1:30:36] and repent." I'm so glad that God cares
[1:30:40] enough about me to correct me.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; I think the I think this is what I mean,
[1:30:49] hell is going to be terrible because
[1:30:50] it's knowing that you'll never see the
[1:30:52] Jesus again, the face of Jesus, the
[1:30:54] presence of God, but it's also that
[1:30:56] knowledge that you you do not have a
[1:30:58] chance to come back, right? You don't
[1:31:01] have a chance. In other words, God
[1:31:04] finally said, "Okay, I've called long
[1:31:06] enough. I've invited long enough. You
[1:31:09] would not come. Okay, you're not coming.
[1:31:12] That is such a horrifying thought to me.
[1:31:18] The bride of Christ is the one really
[1:31:21] who has repented,
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; who comes out of their own image and
[1:31:26] they come into the image of God. See,
[1:31:29] you're you're not just repenting about
[1:31:30] coming out of a denomination. Oh yeah,
[1:31:32] I'll start going to a message church.
[1:31:34] But you're you're repenting of coming
[1:31:36] out of your own image because you know
[1:31:39] you've been called to the image of
[1:31:40] Christ. You've been predestinated to
[1:31:41] come into his image. They have traded
[1:31:44] their lives for gold which is the deity
[1:31:46] of God. You give up your will for God's
[1:31:49] will and they come into the same image
[1:31:52] of God. The bride of Christ has heard
[1:31:54] the voice of her husband speaking to
[1:31:57] come out
[1:31:59] and be ye separate from your first
[1:32:01] nature and receive the second nature of
[1:32:03] God.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Come out of your own image and come into
[1:32:06] the image of Christ. And he continues on
[1:32:09] in Revelations 3:20. Jesus saying,
[1:32:11] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:32:13] If any man hear my voice
[1:32:17] and open the door of their heart,
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; I will come into him and I will s with
[1:32:23] him and he with me and to him that
[1:32:26] overcomemeth to him that says I think I
[1:32:29] can. I think I can. I think I can.
[1:32:34] I will grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:32:37] even as I also overcame and has sat down
[1:32:39] with my father in his throne.
[1:32:42] And then this word goes out to
[1:32:44] everybody. He that have an ear, let him
[1:32:47] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:32:50] churches. And we just think about this.
[1:32:53] Many of us are thinking, brother John's
[1:32:55] speaking, our pastor speaking.
[1:32:59] He's just gathering some stories and
[1:33:00] sharing his thoughts and, you know,
[1:33:03] trying to convey what he feels.
[1:33:06] But in reality,
[1:33:08] he that has an ear, let him hear what
[1:33:10] the spirit, what the Holy Ghost spirit
[1:33:12] is saying to the church.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Because it's not me. It's got to be
[1:33:19] Christ that you're hearing.
[1:33:22] The only place I'm going to lead you
[1:33:26] is to the restaurant so you can buy me
[1:33:28] dinner.
[1:33:32] But when he, the Spirit of truth, come,
[1:33:35] he will lead and guide you into all
[1:33:37] truth.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ is taking her
[1:33:41] husband's word for instructions on the
[1:33:45] road to Wellville through the straight
[1:33:48] gate along the narrow way that's crowded
[1:33:50] with afflictions and problems. Just
[1:33:53] taking the word. You know, a lot of
[1:33:55] people when there's a problem, you know
[1:33:56] what they do? Does anybody know what
[1:33:59] most people do when there's a problem?
[1:34:02] Most people, what do they do? Huh? Run
[1:34:06] away. Okay.
[1:34:08] Huh?
[1:34:10] Deny it. Good. Who? Whoever said deny
[1:34:12] it.
[1:34:14] Ignore it. Good.
[1:34:17] Complain.
[1:34:20] People who love to be on welfare,
[1:34:23] they want the government to take care of
[1:34:25] everything for them.
[1:34:30] But God has made his wife
[1:34:34] is an overcomer.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Everybody else that didn't make it, they
[1:34:40] were not overcomers. They went part way.
[1:34:44] They lived good, clean lives. We know
[1:34:46] the parable about the 10 virgins. Five
[1:34:48] were wise, five were foolish.
[1:34:54] Brother Brandon gives this illustration,
[1:34:56] the choosing of a bride.
[1:34:59] He talks about all these women that
[1:35:01] thought that they were going to be the
[1:35:03] ones going to marry this cowboy.
[1:35:07] And most of them were just bragging.
[1:35:10] But you know what? They didn't want to
[1:35:12] work.
[1:35:14] They didn't want to overcome.
[1:35:17] They didn't want to they didn't want to
[1:35:18] suffer. I'm just going to stay behind
[1:35:20] and I'm just going to work. They wanted
[1:35:22] to be out there and party and look at me
[1:35:24] and you know I'm a great Christian.
[1:35:29] But that cowboy came back for character.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; And character is overcoming your flesh.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; It's overcoming your flesh.
[1:35:45] 2 Timothy 3:16.
[1:35:48] All scripture is given by the
[1:35:50] inspiration of God, and it is profitable
[1:35:53] for reproof, for correction, instruction
[1:35:56] in righteousness, that the man of God
[1:35:58] may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[1:36:00] onto all good works.
[1:36:02] It's profitable for the direction to
[1:36:06] Wellville, for the reproof when we stop
[1:36:09] moving forward, for correction when we
[1:36:11] start going the wrong direction, for
[1:36:12] instruction how to become in the image
[1:36:14] of Jesus Christ. This word of God must
[1:36:17] become our absolute, not just something
[1:36:19] that we say we know it's true.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; But it needs to be true for our lives.
[1:36:25] We need to take it. He that believeth on
[1:36:28] me, the works I do shall he do also.
[1:36:33] Got some cults on that, but I'm not
[1:36:34] going to read it. I just want to read
[1:36:36] Romans chapter 12. I know we have to
[1:36:38] skip some stuff here. Romans chapter 12,
[1:36:41] verse one. The bride of Christ is not
[1:36:44] allowing the world to hold her back. She
[1:36:48] is pressing through all of her trials,
[1:36:50] all of her tests to become in the image
[1:36:52] of Christ. I beseech you therefore by
[1:36:55] the mercies of God that you present your
[1:36:57] bodies a living sacrifice,
[1:37:02] holy and acceptable unto God, which is
[1:37:04] your reasonable service. God is showing
[1:37:07] us how to walk on the road to Wellville.
[1:37:12] because it is God that workketh in you
[1:37:14] both to do of his good pleasure. Amen.
[1:37:17] And be not conformed to this world, to
[1:37:20] this worldly nature. But be ye
[1:37:23] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:37:27] mind. I think I can. I think I can. I
[1:37:29] can be an overcomer. I can be a
[1:37:30] Christian.
[1:37:32] I can live the way he wants me to live.
[1:37:34] Be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:37:36] mind. Think differently about yourself.
[1:37:42] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:37:44] acceptable and perfect will of God for
[1:37:47] your life.
[1:37:48] We are changed from glory unto glory.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Can I just do a couple
[1:37:54] quotes?
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in this church
[1:37:59] age, he says, "A child of God can go a
[1:38:03] long time before they recognize who they
[1:38:05] are."
[1:38:06] Can go a long time. And he would go on
[1:38:09] to tell the story about uh the eagle who
[1:38:14] uh uh the farmer took an eagle egg and
[1:38:18] pl placed it under one of the hens and
[1:38:22] it got enough heat. It had enough
[1:38:24] atmosphere to be to come out and be the
[1:38:28] new birth started.
[1:38:30] Uh but he was inside this uh chicken pen
[1:38:35] or or this down here with the chickens
[1:38:38] in the manure and you know if anybody's
[1:38:41] got chickens, you know, you just throw
[1:38:42] some corn out there and they just start
[1:38:44] digging and you throw it right on the
[1:38:46] manure. They just start eating it. You
[1:38:48] know, they don't they don't say, "No, I
[1:38:49] want a clean plate." Anything like that.
[1:38:52] And so, you know, this is what the the
[1:38:56] eagle was looking at what was happening.
[1:38:58] And it just seemed so disgusting to him
[1:39:02] that he he just found it very difficult
[1:39:05] to be doing. He felt like he was out of
[1:39:07] place. He just looked odd to himself. I
[1:39:11] know I'm going to church. I got to go to
[1:39:12] church. I got to go somewhere.
[1:39:14] But something inside just felt
[1:39:17] uncomfortable.
[1:39:18] And one day
[1:39:21] he heard the eagle.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Heard a scream from above.
[1:39:26] It was mama eagle.
[1:39:29] calling down saying, "Come up out of
[1:39:33] your will.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Come out up out of man-made religion.
[1:39:40] Come up out and fly. You're an eagle."
[1:39:46] And it was when this eagle recognized
[1:39:49] that he was an eagle that he started
[1:39:51] flying.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; But he was an eagle to begin with,
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; but he just didn't recognize it.
[1:39:57] And when you recognize that you are the
[1:40:00] word of God in flesh,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; then you'll start following the word
[1:40:05] like you've never followed it before.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said in the rising of the
[1:40:11] sun, he said, "And God knows,
[1:40:12] hallelujah, he's got a predestinated for
[1:40:15] ordained church. He known he's got sons
[1:40:18] and daughters and a bride waiting
[1:40:20] somewhere. And when the Holy Spirit
[1:40:22] begins to fly over it and wave that
[1:40:24] sheave, oh my, he's the same yesterday,
[1:40:27] today, and forever. Not some mis uh
[1:40:29] mythical story, but a reality. And when
[1:40:33] we see not a denomination, not a good
[1:40:35] neighbor, but a son of God molded into
[1:40:37] the image of God with the dynamic power
[1:40:40] of God to answer the request of this day
[1:40:42] that he is the same yesterday, today,
[1:40:44] and forever. that ain't that uh there
[1:40:47] ain't no hen going to hold you.
[1:40:50] He hunts his mama. He's an eagle to
[1:40:53] begin with. He recognizes this eagle
[1:40:55] recognizes the call of God's word. Why?
[1:40:59] He's an eagle. An eagle to an eagle. The
[1:41:02] word before the foundation, the word to
[1:41:05] the word. The word predestinated to the
[1:41:08] word written for the hour. You realize
[1:41:11] your possession. You realize your
[1:41:13] position and you hunt for it.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; And the revelation of Jesus Christ, I've
[1:41:21] quoted this before, but it's real
[1:41:24] important. I believe worth repeating.
[1:41:26] Now, remember this. Christ is the true
[1:41:30] church in the continuation
[1:41:33] of the book of Acts. Christ in the true
[1:41:36] church is the continuation of the book
[1:41:38] of Acts. But the book of Revelation
[1:41:42] shows how the Antichrist spirit would
[1:41:44] come into the church and defile it,
[1:41:46] making it what? How do you defile a
[1:41:48] church? Make it lukewarm,
[1:41:51] formal, powerless.
[1:41:54] It exposes Satan,
[1:41:56] revealing his works, attempting
[1:41:58] destruction of God's people, and
[1:42:00] discrediting God's word right down to
[1:42:03] the time he's cast into the lake of
[1:42:05] fire. He fights that. He cannot stand
[1:42:07] it. He knows that the He knows that if
[1:42:11] the people get the true revelation of
[1:42:13] the true church and what she is,
[1:42:18] what she stands for and she can do the
[1:42:21] greater works, she will be an invincible
[1:42:24] army.
[1:42:25] See, recognizing
[1:42:28] who she is,
[1:42:30] that's why it's important for us to
[1:42:32] recognize who we are. The sooner the
[1:42:34] better because you will when you
[1:42:37] recognize you're a true son of God, a
[1:42:39] true daughter of God, a true child of
[1:42:40] God, Satan can't do nothing to you.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; He's powerless.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Didn't the prophet say that the
[1:42:49] Christian, the weakest Christian on his
[1:42:51] knees, the devil trembles?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Because the weakest Christian is going
[1:42:57] before his heavenly father saying,
[1:42:59] "Father, I need thee." And God, you
[1:43:01] know, he's faithful.
[1:43:08] If they can get the true revelation of
[1:43:10] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:43:12] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:43:16] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:43:18] spirit, Satan will be powerless before
[1:43:22] her. He will be as he will he will be as
[1:43:25] definitely throtted today as when Christ
[1:43:29] withtood every effort to gain power over
[1:43:31] him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates this
[1:43:35] revelation. He hates revelation. But we
[1:43:37] love it.
[1:43:40] With true revelation in our lives, the
[1:43:42] gates of hell cannot prevail against us,
[1:43:45] but we will prevail against them.
[1:43:49] Amen. One quick quote from Christ, the
[1:43:51] mystery of God revealed. And here it is.
[1:43:53] You can stand to you can stand if you'd
[1:43:55] like. And here he is today in his word
[1:43:59] manifesting the same thing he did there.
[1:44:03] She can't recognize another headship. No
[1:44:07] sir. There is no bishop, no nothing. She
[1:44:09] recognizes one headship. That's Christ.
[1:44:12] And Christ is the word. Oh my. R. I love
[1:44:15] that.
[1:44:16] We recognize Christ as our headship. We
[1:44:19] recognize this word as our headship. You
[1:44:22] know, a lot of people they go to church
[1:44:24] and they look at they they go to church
[1:44:26] and they say, "Well, the Bible is there
[1:44:28] to kind of help you become a better
[1:44:30] person so you can treat your neighbor
[1:44:31] better and uh just just be a a little
[1:44:35] bit better person." They view coming to
[1:44:38] church for that reason.
[1:44:41] But we, the bride, knows that this is
[1:44:44] the word of God that's going to judge
[1:44:45] them in the last day.
[1:44:47] And the word is so much more serious and
[1:44:49] important to them.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And I believe that we have an excellent
[1:44:55] opportunity to become in the image of
[1:44:57] Jesus Christ
[1:44:59] because we know what that is here.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And all as we're doing all God has given
[1:45:05] us opportunity to get serious with the
[1:45:08] word when we go home and spend time
[1:45:10] reading, spend time praying and say,
[1:45:13] "God, I want to make it to Wellville.
[1:45:16] Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Whatever you desire, whatever you want,
[1:45:18] you want healing in your body, you want
[1:45:20] victory over uh some uh device in your
[1:45:23] life, whatever it would be, there is a
[1:45:26] way to get there.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; You got to have the attitude, I think I
[1:45:32] can.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that chorus. I am I am
[1:45:37] one of the few.
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:44] I am one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the
[1:45:49] few. And by faith in God's word, I can
[1:45:53] make it.
[1:45:55] Though the way may seem long and the
[1:45:59] opposition strong for the bride there so
[1:46:03] away provided
[1:46:06] if I plan to go through just to hope
[1:46:10] will not do I must be firmly decided
[1:46:17] to follow the Lord by obeying his word
[1:46:22] and believe that I'm one of the few.
[1:46:26] What do you believe? I am one of the
[1:46:29] few. Yes, I'm one of the few. And by
[1:46:33] faith in God's word, I can claim it.
[1:46:38] Though the way may seem long and the
[1:46:41] opposition strong for the bride, there's
[1:46:45] a way provided.
[1:46:48] If I plan to go through just to hope
[1:46:52] will not do, I must be firmly decided
[1:46:59] to follow the Lord by obeying his word
[1:47:04] and believe that I'm one of the few.
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:14] Amen.
[1:47:16] And believe. How many believes you're
[1:47:17] one of the few?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder if there's anybody here
[1:47:23] today that says, "Brother John, I have
[1:47:27] really been living underneath the
[1:47:31] privileges that God has given me to
[1:47:33] claim all his word for my life." And you
[1:47:36] would like to have prayer before we go
[1:47:38] to him in prayer. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:47:42] Lord. I believe in the power of God.
[1:47:46] I believe that God has power
[1:47:50] to take us. His word will not return
[1:47:53] void. And all we're doing is agreeing
[1:47:56] with what he said.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; We're not making our own word up. We
[1:48:01] don't got power in our word. We just got
[1:48:03] power in believing in God's word. Amen.
[1:48:06] Let's go to God in prayer. Our heavenly
[1:48:10] father, Lord, I thank you for your bride
[1:48:13] here.
[1:48:16] for your sons and your daughters and
[1:48:19] those that you have you have
[1:48:21] predestinated
[1:48:22] all of us to be in your image.
[1:48:27] And Lord, we're here today, Lord, asking
[1:48:31] through this word that you have given
[1:48:33] us, God, would you help us to step up to
[1:48:37] the plate with more confidence,
[1:48:41] with more assurance,
[1:48:44] with with a right attitude,
[1:48:47] with a a right testimony, a right
[1:48:50] profession, a right confession
[1:48:54] without
[1:48:57] a laxadesico but with Lord I care with
[1:49:00] all my heart. I want to become like you.
[1:49:04] Bless your people with an inner strength
[1:49:07] Lord.
[1:49:09] Lord you said they that wait upon the
[1:49:11] Lord shall renew their strength. We need
[1:49:13] strength on a road to Wellville.
[1:49:16] There are many obstacles, things we're
[1:49:18] facing, things all over
[1:49:21] that one another don't know what we are
[1:49:24] going through.
[1:49:25] Lord, you know,
[1:49:28] Lord, thank you for being greater in us
[1:49:31] than all of our trials, all of our test.
[1:49:34] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:49:36] Lord, we want to we want to tap into
[1:49:38] more of the promises of God. And Lord,
[1:49:41] we're asking, Father, that you would
[1:49:43] help our unbelief.
[1:49:46] Take our doubts away, our fears away,
[1:49:49] our shame away,
[1:49:51] and help us to stand up for you as you
[1:49:53] stood up for us.
[1:49:57] You lay down your your life
[1:50:01] that you may come down to our level.
[1:50:04] Help us to lay down our life now to come
[1:50:07] up to your level.
[1:50:10] Bless your people now, Lord. We commit
[1:50:13] them in with their desire. You see the
[1:50:15] desire in their heart.
[1:50:18] We see the commitment they're making
[1:50:20] right now. I pray Lord
[1:50:24] Lord let let it grow in such a way
[1:50:29] that they can look back to this moment
[1:50:32] and know Lord is because
[1:50:36] you said to them be it unto you
[1:50:38] according to thy will and they said Lord
[1:50:41] I want to be just like you grant it
[1:50:44] father we thank you and we give you
[1:50:46] praise with all of our heart in Jesus
[1:50:48] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. I
[1:50:51] just want to thank the Lord for that
[1:50:53] prayer. Thank the Lord for doing that.
