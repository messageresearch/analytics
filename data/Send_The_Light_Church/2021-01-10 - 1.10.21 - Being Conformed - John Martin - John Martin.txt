be in that number amen praise the lord everyone i say god bless you in the name of jesus amen brother branham said that's the most the best thing that we could say to one another is to ask god to bless one another amen amen if you would turn with me to the book of romans chapter 12. it's good to see everyone here it's especially good to see sister ali it's been a while since we've seen her and we're excited for this great day of baptism for brother james it's just a wonderful celebration and we're i've just been excited about it uh and i trust that each and every one is as happy as heaven is amen because heaven is is happy amen before we begin reading in the book of romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2 let's look to the lord in prayer this time our dear heavenly father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your faithfulness lord your word declares that when we're unfaithful you still remain faithful amen and we thank you for your faithfulness today we thank you for the price that you paid at calvary that the sins that we've sinned uh yesterday or this morning lord were paid there at calvary we just asked lord if there would be anything in our lives that just is not right shouldn't be there we just pray that the blood of calvary at this moment would cleanse us wash to sanctify us and set us aside for this service that we're we're about to have lord that we're in the midst we've brought an offering of praise of thanksgiving we've shared a heart of how much we appreciate you lord and now lord we are humbling ourselves before thy word and we pray that lord you would uh put in order our thoughts our minds that they be centered upon you take away any thoughts of of the past of of the future and lord let them just be centered on what you would have for us today bless each one lord and we pray above all the things that you would grant to us lord that you would give us the revelation of your word that your church might be built in us but lord forget not our afflictions forget not all the other uh leadership that we need in our life and the guidance may you come and meet every need according to your riches in glory we commit now this service in your hands and please lord we humbly ask that you would have the preeminence now in jesus christ's name amen amen romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen and then one more scripture before you seated romans chapter 8 romans chapter 8 starting with verse number 28 29 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among all of us amen god bless you may be seated uh harmony is excited in one way for church order amen that's so good to hear praise the lord continue to pray about that last wednesday we laid a solid foundation for church order with the message that god is a god of order amen today we want to take a little break uh from that and and god willing continue this wednesday please do not miss any of the services uh for church order if you have go back and listen to the one prior because this is for our church amen today we want to take a fall in our opening scriptures here about being conformed and i got looking on uh on the internet it appeared to me that um yesterday on january 9 2007 is when steve jobs introduced the first iphone the iphone put the internet in everyone's pocket course we know what the devil had in mind with that when steve jobs first unveiled the iphone he described it as a revolutionary mobile phone the original iphone set the stage for modern smartphones ushering in an error which pocket-sized touchscreens computers are the norm so look how it it kind of changed things another thing happened on that same day but it was 231 years before that on january 9 1776 the writer thomas paine published the pamphlet common sense setting forth his arguments in favor of american independence and although little used today pamphlets were an important medium for the spread of the ideas in the 16th through the 19th centuries originally published anonymously common sense advocated the independence for american colonies from britain and is considered one of the most influential pamphlets in american history credited with uh uniting average citizens and political leaders behind the idea of independence much different than today sense played in a remarkable role in transforming a colonial squabble into the american revolution pain fundamentally changed the terror of the uh the tenor i'm sorry not the terror the tenor of the colonist argument with the crown when he wrote the following this new world have been a solemn for the pro for the persecuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from every part of europe how things have changed common sense today is that the world is insane people are wondering if there's going to be a second american revolution i know people today who are buying unregistered guns because of the unknown and i'm talking automated weaponry elon musk now the world's richest person is selling all his possessions so people know he's serious about putting a colony on mars he's serious about it he he he's he uh he wants to die there but he doesn't want to die when he lands right he doesn't want to die from a crash landing there but he wants to it's amazing how everybody just wants to be god of something ann had sent me a quote yesterday he says if you're a common sense person you probably don't feel you have a home in this world right now and if you're a christian you know where you never were meant to our home is from another place amen the world has fallen apart the hope for a better future is becoming extinct with the realization that the world is running out of control satan knows he has but a short time left and is manifesting lawlessness throughout the world brother brandon preached the world is falling apart today we can say the world has fallen apart people are rapidly losing hope for their future as they watch the world unravel into a complete insanity there's no hope for this world there's no chance of things coming back or or working out for their good but a bible believer's hope isn't in this world or this world's leaders even if you get a halfway decent leader in office satan will make sure he moves the rest of the world to get him out of there satan is the god of this evil age and he's conforming people to the pinnacle of his selfish nature i want you to catch that he's moving the world to become so selfish so full of hate for one another that they're willing to kill to get what they want brother or brother ron said earlier today he said that god has an agenda no matter what's going on in this world god's got an agenda i like to title this message being conformed and for a subject be not conformed to this world but into the image of god we're being conformed one way or the other paul said be not conformed to this world because that we've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of jesus christ and to those who understand predestination means we still have a part to play we don't lay back and do whatever we want to do no sir because if we do we're just going to fall to the conformity of this world we must allow the mind of christ which is the word of god to come inside of us transform the way that we think into the mind of christ that our whole life can be conformed into what we've been predestined to be conformed to and that's jesus christ it's there if there was ever a time that we needed to get serious about a relationship with god now say our love relationship with god this is the hour god is revolutionizing his bride he's changing her radically little by little line upon line word upon word isaiah chapter 9 verse 5 for isaiah chapter 9 verse 5 for every battle of a warrior i think there's another war coming i really believe that for every battle of a warrior is with confused noise we know armageddon's coming don't we and garments rolled in blood they said the blood will be so high it'll be at the the horse's bridle the blood will be that that much blood in that valley for every battle of a warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but this shall be with a burning and a few of fire for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father and the prince of peace there's another way to win a battle remember when peter wanted to draw his sword jesus says put that away he even had to testify to to to pilot if or who i i'm pretty sure it was pilots is that my subjects were of this world that they would have have fought but they're not of this world we don't battle against flesh and blood it's a spiritual warfare while the world is fighting the devil from the outside the bride is fighting the devil from the inside the world is fighting the devil in everyone else right this political party says this and that political party says this this country says it's that country that country says is that country the world is fighting the devil and everyone else but the bride is overcoming the devil inside of her and i'll tell you that's the most important place how is she doing it with a fire of the holy ghost it's burning up all the dross all the world all that is that evil nature amen that she was born with she's continuing to be born again and when the holy ghost comes he will reprove the world of sin his job is to let us know what isn't like christ inside of us now the benefit of falling in love with jesus and working according to his eternal purpose is that all things are going to work together for the good regardless of what happens to you in this world or the rest of the world it really doesn't matter the world doesn't have assurance that things are working out for it's good you talk to people out there and they they don't have anything but the world to rely on and that's why they're getting more down and more depressed didn't but the bride does she has a revelation of the assurance that no matter what happens to her to her she is in a place she's fulfilling the purpose of god she knows that everything's going to work out for the good amen and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose she not only is in love with god but she's found her calling in god's purpose brother branham said in the message stand still he said hell will be made up of church members wow hell will be made up of church members no wonder he could preach there's three types of believers in every church in the message the un unconditional covenant that god made with the people brother braham says you might live good all your life and you go to hell brother in the message christ is revealed in his own word he says you can love and even love god and still not be right we need more than just to love god we need to be called according to his purpose loving god is crucial but it varies from person to person from believer to believer but loving god with all your heart with all your mind with all your spirit all your soul that's really what's commanded of us it's a it's a degree of love that goes beyond it's the highest degree of love would anybody get excited i i you know we all have things that we like about somebody right especially if you've looked uh on on movies or movie stars actresses uh actors um you know all the vain people the singers and all that stuff that we we kind of like the way they sing you know when they're talking you really like that little part they do and whatever it might be we all have those little things would you i mean just if we just had like a little chance right now everything's kind of blank and you get to move forward and marry or get to you marry whoever you want and just pick them out yeah they've checked lists and you got exactly what you're you're looking for would you want to marry that person if there was a part of them that really didn't love you just a part i think god is looking for a bride that loves him with all her heart regardless that's why we can't be satisfied with i love god amen can be satisfied with that amen we've got to live according to god's purpose because we've been predestinated to fulfill god's purpose we've been predestinated if we don't we don't have the confidence because it's only half of the relationship or part of the relationship oh i i love brother mark but i'm not going to you know do things for him i'm not going to be nice to him i'm not going but i still love him this just doesn't make sense to me we may view god as having many purposes he has a purpose for your life and my life he has a purpose for you working at your job he has a purpose for me working at my job perhaps he has a purpose for the house that you live in and and he has a purpose for the house that i live in but i want to focus this morning on god's eternal purpose not just one of many purposes but the one purpose that is the same for you and i for every one of us it's the same thing paul describes a mystery in ephesians chapter 3 and if you ever get time read chapters one through three but paul describes a mystery in ephesians chapter three which was hid from the foundation of the world and was recently made known just two thousand years ago that the gentiles should be fellow heirs of the same body and paul calls this an eternal purpose god wanted to take out a bride out of the gentiles for his wife she would be chosen of him or elected by him i want you i got three different quotes from three different church ages i love this all talking about the same thing in the sumerian church age brother branham says you can't read it any other way the heart purpose now he calls it the heart purpose get right down to the middle of the purpose the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself in other words he purposed it in himself as being eternal and was decreed before the foundation of the world so god had this all inside of him way before anything was created watch carefully now and and see this before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god god is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially god and he was known only as an eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not he said the eternal thoughts of god and the message the ephesian church age brother branham says now the word must definitely set forth that form set forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god was to share his eternal life with man i wasn't satisfied with just angels who never fell there was something about the appreciation of some human being that was born in sin and would appreciate him through eternity that god wanted to feel and express have that expressed to him and that's why god never likes coming into a cold former church god wants a church on fire that loves them will worship him in spirit and truth in the message the sardarian church age brother brahm said it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him so this is really between you and god it is not between you god and the person you're sitting next to or between you and your pastor it's between you and god this situation it didn't have anything to do with the angels it didn't have anything to do with lucifer didn't have anything to do with anybody except god god's desire god's purpose amen and all things work together for the good to them that love god and who are the called according to his purpose god's mind is still on his eternal purpose today chapter 2 verse 5 says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus was not the mind of christ to fulfill the father's will i do nothing except what pleases the father the father loveth me because i laid on my life he was working with the purpose the eternal purpose of god it hasn't stopped it has not stopped the holy ghost is the mind of christ john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things i don't think he's and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you amen you just go back and look at all the words in red and that's exactly what the holy ghost is speaking and bringing to your remembrance amen did not he say go ye out did not he say terry in jerusalem until you being due with power for mine did not he say i give you power this is what he brings to our remembrance this is the mind of christ look what happens when we get the holy ghost second corinthians chapter 5 verse 9 because that's what really matters i want proof i have to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god to prove what the purpose of god is second corinthians chapter 5 verse 9 says wherefore we labor that whether we be present or absent we may be accepted of him it is impossible to be accepted by god if you don't labor naturally speaking naturally you shouldn't eat if you don't work is what the scripture says spiritually it's no different if we don't partake of the will of god the purpose of god do the things that god has told us to do we're not going to be accepted for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one of you may receive the things that he's done in his body according to what i have done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore the terror of the lord we try to be a good person and be uh you know a good christian and be nice to one another and uh no that's not what it says is this knowing that we're all going to stand before god and be judged we better get busy persuading other people but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also may manifest to your conscience for we commend not ourselves to get unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may know somewhat to answer them which glory and appearance and not in heart but whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or it would be sober it is for your cause for the love of christ it constrains us i hope you're not here today because it's church and you have to be here or you're afraid you're going to get a phone call from somebody if the love of god is not constraining you to be here you need to be working on your love relationship because there is no way that i'm going to be able to stand before god on the day of judgment and say look out of the 1600 different times i had a chance to go to church i made it 15 950. is that good enough i think he's interested in my love affair a love affair now that love affair will constrain you to come to church i don't want to get a church order right now but we will be getting into that forsaking not the sampling of ourselves together and what all the more how many sees the day approaching this world's going insane and this is making it even harder for people to come to church they got more excuses it's the love of christ that constrains me to be here because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves you know when you're not here and you could be you're living for yourself don't you tell me this came up and that came up that's okay once in a blue blue moon but after a while your blue moons are happening every month so every month's a blue moon amen and that if he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him that died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth we know no man after the flesh yeah though we have known christ after the flesh yep no more no more we don't look at jesus in some natural carnal fleshly way it's a spiritual relationship when the when jesus comes into your heart verse 17 says therefore if any man be in christ if jesus comes into your heart he is a new creature old things have gone by by behold all things are fresh our new are exciting are different are changing and you know it's not like we're in the world and i know brother marty you know brother marty and i could really sit together and who knows i know when i was listening to the moody boos it was you know dark and uh moody exactly well said sister well said but when i get done that it isn't like you change from that music to neil diamond yeah or to seals and crawf or kenny rogers or that's the same old old there's just a lot to choose from in the broad way but when you become a new creature it's a new spirit you feed on new things it's a new message in the music amen it's a message of hope amen a message that makes you want to lay down your life not feel like i'm so cool and tough it's a different message therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new well what's so different about this newness verse 18 tells us all things are of god now different message in the music who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ he reconciled us to himself by jesus christ in other words we've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of jesus christ he's reconciled us to himself but it doesn't stop there there's not a period we don't go on to another subject there's a comma and there's an an and it says and have given to us a the ministry of reconciliation that is exactly the same ministry that jesus had when he was on earth to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and not imputing their trespasses onto them we're not interested in in telling people about their their trespasses and saying you're going to hell bye no we want to let people know that the situation the condition that they're in is that there is a reconciliation for you god has committed unto us now the word of reconciliation i'm telling you saints this is the eternal purpose of god god did not stop with me brother mark and said oh yes i got my bride i don't care about anybody else what kind of spirit would that be you know what that would be that's a selfish spirit that's i'm saved that's all that matters can you imagine jesus i'm not going to cross i'm saved that's all that matters i'm not i don't need to die i'm saved but because he looked at you knew you wouldn't get to be with him he was willing to suffer if that same god lives in you won't he feel the same way today that's his eternal purpose you want things to work out for the good you're called to that purpose not your own purposes not your private purposes i'm talking about an eternal purpose that was in the mind of god before anything was ever created you were there but not only you the people you should be talking to the people you should be reaching out to the people that don't know him yet you've been given a ministry of reconciliation but brother john it's a little bit hard with this coping and i don't even you know i can't even really you know go to the store today i can't even like eat a wrap you know what get the heart of god god will make a way he'll work through your texting he'll work through your prayers he'll work through your phone he'll work through you if you're willing if you got that burden if the ministry is inside of you he'll use that ministry but you know the problem is we need more holy ghosts that's what the problem is we just need more holy ghost amen more of god did not the prophet said if he could just get one man in his hands what he could do lord have thine own way have your way fill me with your spirit amen it's not for somebody else to do when you have that thought you're saying god you're not worthy of me giving myself to you it's exactly what you're saying if i was gonna hire brother mark to come work for me he stepped his steps inside the door and he says i'm here to work but i just want to let you know i'm going to do what i want to do i'm going to labor the way i want to labor choose my kind of jobs it's a lot of christians today i'm going to serve god my way according to my purpose oh i love him i know but you got to get called according to his purpose this is his purpose it hasn't stopped because as soon as somebody gets filled with the holy ghost in 2020 god puts them on fire to serve him to win souls he gives them a ministry of reconciliation it ain't just for us friends when we get to heaven there's going to be other people there just as important as you part of the same family when we receive god the holy ghost become born again a new creature god puts us in harmony with his eternal purpose and you may not feel like it but you should say amen to that and he gives us the same ministry of jesus christ reconciling others back to god giving them eternal life that's what you possess inside of you why would you want to hang on to that and say it's all for you i don't deserve to have it i don't deserve to stand here today i don't deserve to say anything i'm just as evil and rotten amen who am i to stand here and tell somebody what they need to do i should be there and honestly there ain't a minister standing amen he chose the foolishness of preaching to save men amen he took a a a vessel that's not right not perfect to bring perfection to a bride so that this ministry is not of man this ministry is of god the word is of god he would not share his glory with a human being look what happened on the day of pentecost they all received the ministry of reconciliation as soon as they were filled with the holy ghost amen he sent them out immediately gave him the furtherance of his ministry he didn't say now you boys you you go have your own ministry out there no he didn't do that he said you wait till you get filled with me and then you'll know how to properly witness you know how to stand the test they exercised and used and brought souls to jesus with the ministry they just didn't say we believed in it they actually walked in it they actually used the ministry the exorcist they gave their life and produced souls were added to the church daily daily you mean i got to think about i i'm so used to just thinking about this stuff when i come to church brother john get filled with god you can't get it off your mind get renewed in the spirit get a fresh anointing it's there look what happened to paul born out of due season yet when the new birth took place in his life he unselfishly became all things to all men for the purpose of winning some of them amen it's the purpose of god being fulfilled and he was so in love with this situation that he wasn't discouraged by sufferings by afflictions today in 2021 god's purpose is still moving forward did not we sing that song brother ron that song about battle hymn of the republic his truth is marching forward his ministry is marching forward amen the holy spirit will always put you in harmony with god's eternal purpose of getting the rest of your family saved and getting his bride ready for him it always will i come from a larger family not myself but i mean i had some a few children and it always stuck in my mind those who were always trying to help the others versus those who only cared about [Music] themselves do you think anyone in the bride is not going to care about others here's abraham willing to lay down his life to go fight for lot lot wasn't even a type of bride see my friend we don't need to sit here and try to figure out hope that we're bright all you gotta do is look at her life what have i been doing the last month the last two months the last two years what am i doing you are living what you believe we're either being conformed to the world or we're letting this word transform the way we think so we can be called so we can be uh conformed to the image of jesus christ now if jesus was here today he would not be and he'd be here if he was here for sure he would not be saying brother john you need to put your stocks in you know apple because they're really going or uh he'd be saying look up our redemption draws nigh we need to get things in order we need to get salt the rest of the family in because when it's over people will be thinking they're still getting saved up here but he's oh it's over for the gentiles i can't put enough emphasis in being serious with god i know this is just church we only got an hour you know soon it's going to be over we're going to be doing our own things watching on football games whatever it might be but i'm telling you the hour is nigh we need to be serious about getting our hearts our lives in order you have a family out there it's a spiritual family you don't know her yet maybe but god has called you to get her you can't expect brother branham he's gone you can't expect paul he's gone you can't expect jesus the body of jesus christ in you the hope of glory the only hope that the world's god is christ in you you are his hands you are his arms you are his eyes you are that mouthpiece to get the prophet to them to get the message to them that's why the prophet would confidently say that missionary work is always in the will of the lord because it's his eternal purpose he said we're all called to be a missionary which means we're all called to be sent out not wait for the door to open let me ask you brother ron if you were going to wait til somebody called you and said hey would you like to go fishing you might be waiting longer than if you called somebody and said hey you want to go fishing if you're gonna wait for god to bring some soul to you you might be waiting longer than if you fulfilled the scripture and go yelp for that soul amen so it's where your heart's at where your mind is at see too much of us are involved in too much of our purpose and we're missing the big picture the big picture is god's purpose that involves every one of you the same i don't live in your neighborhood you don't live in mine you i don't work at your place you don't work at mine we don't live in the same house we don't have the same rules but i'll tell you we got the same god with the same eternal purpose calling us to do the same work it's a tall order to go out and bring him in especially in this age but i want to say it's his order it's a great commission it's his eternal purpose if god was willing to die for his enemies to save the enemies his enemies from hell wouldn't he be doing the same thing today in us i think it's easy for for me to judge whether i've got the mind of christ romans chapter 8 verse 28 we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose because we're all called right many are called have you been called to his purpose his heart purpose his eternal purpose have you been called to what was actually in the mind of god before the foundation of the world then tell me how could not every single thing that happens to you not work out for the good we don't need to question what's going on in our life he's got it under control seek ye first the kingdom all other things are added put your attention to god's eternal purpose he'll take care of everything else amen all heaven rejoices over one soul that is returning back to him than the 99 just people amen his heart is for those that are out that's the priority right now that's the priority there's coming a time when we're going to enjoy our honeymoon with him we're going to enjoy heaven with him but for now we need to work we need to labor what's light we need to be in harmony with the purpose of god today [Music] because when it's over it's over you love god to the extreme that his love constrains you to do god's own purpose you know everything is going to work out for your good now at the same time you're busy working according to god's own purpose and not your own purpose he is making sure that you're being conformed into the image of his son i love that because to have this weight on me of having to figure everything out and do this and don't do that and time here and just put god first every single trial that you're going through is working out for your good philippians chapter 2 verse 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling in other words don't you ever entertain a thought that i got it all under control that i'm so close so one with god i don't fear nothing either just either just lay out a seal so work out what's already worked out well it might be worked out yesterday but this is a new day today is the day of salvation it needs to get worked out i'm not talking about dealing with this i committed i got baptized james i don't want to scare you but the heater wasn't plugged in all the way last night it's a little bit chilly trying to warm it up now brother branham said that you make a commitment to god you raise your hand you make that commitment in your heart you're just as saved as save can be you repent you get baptized you're just as saved as save can be but you have another day to walk in the light and if you're truly saved you'll continue to walk in the light but at any time because we got free more agency we can say no i'm taking a break that's dangerous ground that's dangerous ground so that's where that fear and trembling comes in that's the importance of just making sure that that i'm really in harmony with god's purpose for my life amen for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of all of your good pleasures but isn't that the way we think a lot of times i want to do this i want to do that i want to go here i want to go there i'm going to do this what about the purpose of god for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so in other words when you come to church and you hear what you need to do to get in order with god do it without murmuring without disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god so when god tells you to reach out don't murmur about it don't dispute i don't have to do that god didn't call me it's not my calling not a minister you listen to those tapes and brother brahm talks about that old old couple i don't know if they think they were in their 90s i can't remember their names right now it's on there kid i think it might be they would take the rio to reel machine and they would go to houses and they would play tapes so other people could hear the prophet you don't got to stand behind a pulpit to be in the ministry of reconciliation all you got to do is offer your time to god because he can't do anything with you if you're not offering don't expect god to put you in a headlock and drag you to do his will he's not that kind of man he's a gentleman he says come on i'll give you my word sunday morning i'll tell you my heart if you're in love with me follow me this is the way walking in it hallelujah that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation that's us isn't it the world we're living in among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain god is working inside of you with a fuel of fire he's revolutionizing your life your desires your plans your wishes and day by day you're becoming more in his image now it may not appear from the outside in fact the more i look in the mirror the more i'm looking the opposite direction i was trying on these new glasses yesterday and i had the mask on you know because you gotta have the mask on and during these brushes and sister laura you know what i've seen i seen all my wrinkles right here that's all i seen was these wrinkles and i'm thinking oh my it's been a long time since i put coconut oil on my face but i need to put some on but i'll tell you on the inside our our heart our nature our spirit we should be coming more conformed into the image of god of jesus christ who lay down his life daily he lived for others don't murmur don't complain first peter chapter 4 verse 12 says beloved think it not strange concerning that we're talking about all things working together for the good amen amen beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial you ever been a trial that wasn't just a little trial but it was fire i mean this battle that's happening inside of you you think it's about something else you think it's about your boss you think it's because you don't got enough money you think it's because you have a problem with your neighbor but really what's happening is god just he's so multi-talented he takes every situation and he's working on your character he's bringing you into the conformity of this word using every situation if we can recognize what's really happening beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened unto you but rejoice and as much as you are partakers of christ's suffering now if you just stop there it's just like who in the world wants to be partakers of anybody's sufferings but it's the sufferings in which you have a chance for character to groan because character is not a gift you're not going to be given the gift of the image of jesus christ you're going to have to let your mind be transformed into letting god tell you the right way to be when you're in the middle of that trial it's the truth that when his glory shall be revealed he may be glad also with exceeding joy the holy spirit is trying to conform us into god's image we don't make it into god's image by joining the church or by coming to church or by saying i'm in the message or by listening to the tapes i wonder how many people listen to those tapes that really never get rapturing faith because the prophet said rapturing faith in those tapes how many people listen to him and are never going to get rapturing faith so it's not just listening to tapes it's not just coming to church friends we've been called to a relationship with god and this relationship is you are the second born jesus christ is the firstborn among many brethren we've been called to be like him either i don't somewhere down the line it's got to happen i am not of the belief that i have to sit here and go to church all my life listen to the word of god be preached and i'm only going to change when i go on the other side after the rapture something is missing with that mentality god gave us a fivefold ministry for the perfecting god is working in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure as the world is going insane god's bride is coming into a sound mind with christ brother bam she know said she knows what to do with the word when it's given when the word is preached to her she knows what to do with it she takes it she puts it into action she says i'm gonna be this word by the grace of god i'm gonna live it i don't know i'm just gonna have the right mental attitude i'm gonna march forward with it the world is becoming more like hell the bride is becoming more like heaven the world is becoming into the image of the beast the bride is becoming more into the image of christ the world is falling apart at the seams but god's bride is walking seven steps up to perfection the more you can stay out of what's happening in the world the better chance you've got to focus on staying with the lord the world is fighting every day to get ahead but the bride is laying down their lives every day to win another soul she does not care about what happens in this world so at the same time that you're busy working out god's purpose god is conforming you into his image day by day oh i just love that everything has already been set for god's elect from the foundation of the world god give us time this morning because we haven't even got to the good part yet i can't help it time is up but i got all the good parts so it's up to you do you want the good parts you want to go home no we've heard we've heard good parts there was no bad parts this morning the word is word for we know that all things work together for the good to them that love the lord and are called according to his purpose amen that's what the scripture reads and for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified now as you continue to read this he is talking not about just those who are saved he's talking about the elect because many are called fewer chosen i'm so glad god's called everybody he's a fair god he's a fair god but you know you how many knows any of the bride of jesus christ okay you you know some people that are in the bride right has any of them ever told you that they found where brother branham they could pinpoint exactly from the bible or the message that they were part of the bride do you understand what i'm saying you know that you are when something in here is pulling you to be all the word something is happening the problem is we want to mentally psychologically try to believe that we are up here and do what we want to do down here and that's where all the confusion comes in that's why when we come to church we hear this and we feel like we're getting beat over the head and that wasn't right and you know i feel like he's not making me feel like i'm the bride when i come here i want to feel like i'm the bride why don't you just be the bride that way you can be in a fiery furnace you're still the bride there you can be in lion's den you're still the bride there you can be in church and you're still the bride there what's happening inside you your mouth it's where you're at with god i can't put you in the bride and i can't take you out [Music] i just want to give the word if you believe the word you will become the word i'm so sorry but there's so much stuff many are called to the marriage but only a few come the rest of them are too busy with what their own purposes got my business i married a wife got built in the house own purposes and he says you're not worthy is that what he said both esau and jacob were called i'll tell you what made this real confusing the fact was that his father isaac which is one of the fathers of our faith right i'm the i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob isaac loved esau and prayed with his personal intent to see all esau take the birthright so naturally everything looked in order but god did not love esau he hated him because he sold out to his own purpose he sold out to his own purpose his own life that's why we have to be born again to do the will of god jacob on the other hand he was a little deceiver oh you little devil you but he was willing to do whatever it took to get in harmony with god i love that what a what a scene are you willing to do whatever it takes to get in harmony with god's plan that's what god looks at that heart and says oh yeah i love that person i love the heart of that person god sees in her heart he sees whether we got a heart to lay down her life for him or he sees that we got a selfish heart come on now i know this says send the light out here i know we're part of a church but look the real church is inside of you we don't know who's who all i can do is look at a life so all i can do is look at life jesus said you don't you don't know who's just look just look at the fruit you'll know them by the fruit we all want that little badge in fact anybody ever question it pull it out look you may doubt but i don't i got the badge what do you mean you don't like the act here's the badge i saw you spoke i got the badge all right when we have in our fingertips 24 hours a day to live for jesus to lay down our life to love everyone to to win souls that's the holy ghost badge [Music] no wonder god could say before they were born in romans chapter 9 verse 11 for the children being not yet born neither having done good and evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved and esau have i hated it doesn't matter if you've been baptized or that you're in the message not a good time to be talking about doesn't matter if you're baptized if you understand what i'm trying to say because we got a baptism today but baptism as we know repentance and baptism is just the beginning so on this light here if you're despising the god-given right to be born again and despise being conformed into his image and the calling to god's eternal purpose god is still not pleased we can't be satisfied with just he's calling us to a higher calling this is just the beginning i've been spending a lot of time with church order just a lot of time and i got these thoughts this morning when i was back there in the office i thought there are so many things to say they wouldn't be out of bear at all in one service and immediately thought came to me i have many things to say to you but you can't bear it now so god just says take the first step get baptized walk with me i'll show you one step at a time he promised not to put anything on us that would be so heavy we couldn't bear it the problem comes is when he asks us to do something and we've refused to walk in it and then confusion comes in we have to come to church always with defending our belief defend we need to earnestly contend for the faith of what was already said not our new belief my i want to at least finish reading these scriptures in romans chapter 8. i can forget all my other notes i just don't want to forget the word of god here verse 31 of romans chapter 8 what shall we then say to these things that we just learned about if god be for us who can be against us that ought to give us confidence right there he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also free to give us all things i think about where paul did not spare his own life but gave but it was christ in him just like it was christ and moses it was christ and paul he didn't spare his life he didn't count it dear to himself he said i i have i have not shunned to declare on you the whole gospel of god he gave us this gospel that we could be strong that we could put on the whole armor of god that we can overcome the enemy who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify it so it to me it don't matter what you've done god is standing in your behalf god is standing in your behalf now don't expect the world to agree with god don't expect the world to agree with you but it doesn't matter what matters is your faith in this word that god is the one that justifies you and i'm telling you he doesn't look at you like okay here's the line right here as long as your sins don't go beyond that line i'm going to be honest paul was the chiefest of us all right according to the word of god the chiefess he made it anything above that we're in just don't blaspheme what god is doing don't blaspheme what god's doing we don't have a scripture for that but look stop looking about how bad the bads are start looking at how good the goods are that's all that matters who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness perilous sword as is written these things are happening for our sake right for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep as for the slaughter we don't want to go through it but we know that character is being molded in us and satan don't like us when we're living for others so this stuff's going to happen but it doesn't matter our security is in christ day in all these things we are more than conquerors we're not going to let anything stop us more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities or powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature any other creature especially that most subtle beast shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord hang on to the love of god hang on to the love of god let god's love constrain you to fulfill god's purpose god's eternal purpose and that is to win souls the love of god the bible tells us is shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit so let that flame of fire inside of you that burning burn within you to win souls for christ i got one quote brother branham said christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present 2021 i put that party it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in other words it's still burning today it's still burning it's burning the world out of you but it's also fueling you to win souls let me read it again christina's everyday rugged life living for god in this present world it is a constant burning of the fire and love of god in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts to christ he said responsibilities end of quote now that's what the holy ghost does do we have time for god's eternal purpose let him conform you into his image don't be conformed to the world because the world is just doing what it wants to do and when you are being conformed into his image that eternal purpose to get the rest of the family in i'm telling you can have confidence that everything that's going on in your life is somehow some way gonna work out for your good amen let's stand together god bless you thank you for your patience i don't know if this would be an encouragement to you but we didn't read all the notes we didn't get through everything even though it went longer than what we wanted to i say thank you for your patience there's nothing more important than the word of god amen nothing more important and the last thing i ever want to do is stand here and take your time up with something that i thought was just not of god it's always on my heart to want to bring the word of god to you amen let's sing i i love him i love him because he first loved me i love him i love him because he first loved me and purchased [Music] [Music] love him just love him i love him because he first loved me [Music] her just [Music] trees amen we love him because he first loved us and now we can fulfill his purpose which is to let god love somebody else through us through other vessels to fulfill his purpose amen i'm going to live the way he wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more to give i'm going to love love till there's just no more love i could never ever lord i'm gonna amen make the declaration to him he wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more to give i'm going to love love to there's just no more love i could never ever out love our lord amen she continues to play that if i could get you to now your heads with me and just close your eyes for just a few moments before we pray maybe there would be someone here today that wants to move in the direction of fulfilling god's eternal purpose you know that you haven't been yielding to it maybe thinking about it but something today spoke to you something real you want to respond to the word of god that was ministered to you today say brother john i want to unite with that word i want to i want to march forward and i want to i want you to pray with me i know that god is behind this message and i want to fulfill the purpose of the eternal purpose of god that god would use me just raise your hands and i'm going to pray with you praise god look at see god sees this praise the lord praise the lord now let's believe with all of our heart we don't got to shout we don't got to jump up and down but we have to believe because god was here to give us his message and his heart there's still work for us to do that's why the rapture hasn't taken place yet amen let's believe heavenly father i lift my hands with my precious brothers and sisters today [Music] lord we want to fall upon that rock it may hurt to give up our will give up our time give up our plans but god today we're taking a stand against our will taking a stand against our our flesh that's trying to conform us into this selfish way of living and god we want to spend more time looking looking for those that need to be reconciled with you you've given us this great ministry lord it's not our ministry it's your ministry this ministry of reconciliation you placed it within our hands you placed it within our heart and now lord we want to yield to it lord we want to find out reach out to our brothers and sisters and we know that we might have to do it to many people to become all things to all men but lord if we could just win those that you have ordained your eternal life use us lord we place ourselves into your hands lord give faith and and give us strength and encouragement and lord give the power of the holy spirit to everyone lord that's lifted their hands lord use them for your honor and your glory hallelujah hallelujah oh granite lord jesus we thank you for saving our souls lord we're in debt to you not to live on our self but lord to let all things become you in our life father bless every heart and every life now we thank you in jesus christ precious name amen amen let's sing it [Music] i am so needy lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin i am so needy lord to be pure within let's sing it one more time and mean it with all of our heart i am so needy of you [Music] i am so needy lord to be more like [Music] right away in this world of sin i am so needy lord to be pure with him amen god any river think are uncrossable god any mountains [Music] lies is in things thought impossible and he will do what no other friend can do [Music] amen are you thankful that we serve a god that can do anything anything and that should just set us free amen praise his life hey let's give him a praise offer he's worthy of it today praise the lord thank you lord jesus [Applause] amen amen let's sing that uh song um one on one of them and at this time we're going to ask our brother james if he hasn't already to get prepared for the baptism amen the water baptism there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame with the fire that fell at pentecost cleansed and made them clean it is burning now within my heart all glory to his name i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them one of them one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them
