amen the bible says that he picks up the righteous when they fall amen amen he's willing to help all that just reach out to him amen well praise the lord turn with me if you would to the book of galatians chapter 3 for opening scripture and before we begin reading if we could just look to the author just ask his blessings and the remainder of this service heavenly father we thank you for your presence here we thank you for each one that has brought you here today lord we have something greater now among us than we had individually in our homes with coming together we just thank you for your presence this morning we thank you lord for your precious promises in your word and today lord we just ask that you would forgive us of all of our our fears and doubts and questions lord in anything lord that his any sin in our life any unbelief any things that we've said that were wrong or just things that we thought that were wrong lord we just pray that your blood would cover us cleanse us wash us and lord that we could enter into this part of the service and and have an intimate time with you this morning lord come and minister to each of our hearts lord lift us up into a heavenly realm that lord we're receiving revelation from you god we pray that you'd anoint this word now as we read as we look into it join it to our hearts with the same anointing that was written let it be heard therewith we give you the praise and honor for these things for we pray them in jesus name amen amen galatians chapter 3 verse number 16 now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ dropping down to verse 26 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond or free neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus and if ye be christ then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise amen god bless you may be seated how many has ever heard things that i said that were didn't quite seem right how many is heard things that you just didn't understand we can't get away from that completely we can't but that shows us that we really need the lord one thing that i really really enjoyed about brother aaron for many years since the beginning i i told him that his experience he's gifted he's just he is gifted and but i told him as an experience as a lawyer you know you have to convince the others of what you're saying and he he knows how to lay it out and and it's just easier to follow um but everybody is not gifted in that realm moses was not gifted in that realm that he had an errand um peter was ignorant and unlearned paul was it was schooled but we know that uh well brother brandon he only had a seventh grade education and um it's just the way that god has ordained it it can't be perfect naturally but we can be in the spirit we can be connected to this to god who's using the vessel brother branham said this in questions and answers in 62 he says and i can say one thing and i'm so misunderstood or say it this way it's the way it's this way or that way one gets it way on this side and way it is you say that right straight towards the point one hears it this way and tells another and he leans a little further the next one leans a little further and then a little further and then it's got plumb out of cater all because of misunderstanding one hears it the other way he goes this way that way and then that way see you get away and that's the way it is in the meetings and so forth you really are driving it right to the spot now the elect would hear that spot they get that spot they know because because i said it exactly what i was meant like that that's just the message it's just exactly now that's what i say it seems like there's more misunderstanding all the time continually tell me we're not going to quite get away from well i wouldn't quite say it like that brother john a lot of times when we've had ministers come through there they have a point that they want to bring and it may not be balanced like i'd like to see it but they're bringing a point and you got to support the point you understand i'm saying you you just can't just throw it out because it ain't balanced the way you want it or it it's it's not said just the way you want um we've got to understand that god's got many different vessels and he uses them and just because it's not quite the way we see it um it doesn't mean it's it's not of the lord but this i will say because of the situation because there brother branham saying there's there's so many misunderstandings and more and more all the time and continually we need to be more ready to hear the word to be in the spirit when we come into church and and not just you know put it all on the natural right but to enter into the to the spirit amen amen well this morning we want to talk about the seed of abraham and for a subject the two seeds of abraham now brother branham again if you if you studied the message you see brother branham talked about uh two c's one was isaac and and uh one was um um was abraham i'm sorry there were two seeds one was isaac and one was ishmael another place he said one was isaac and one was was uh christ and in another place he said that that he had three seeds and so if you just take one of them and go to seed on it you can get in trouble but but but understanding the point that he's bringing so i want to talk about the two seeds the ones that we're aware of uh and that was ishmael and isaac can can you go with me for for just a moment okay brother brandon he starts off in this message uh abraham's grace covenant he said now our heavenly father we thank thee for every gracious word that's written in the bible it seemed that we're compassed about with such a a great cloud of witnesses two and a half million people died yet perishing in the wilderness of unbelief and only two that believed were permitted to go over he said father god i pray you to help us to see that and to look to what it means let us not be disbelievers in thy word but may we be not only hearers not only hearers but doers of the word granite amen so the the the message came that we could be doers of the word and learn and learn from the word amen now abraham had two sons isaac and in ishmael one son isaac he was supernaturally birthed by the spoken word of god the other son ishmael he was birthed by the natural will of man yet they were both seeds of abraham abraham really wanted ishmael who was born by his own will to be the son in which the spiritual promise would come we understand that even though god declined him that desire that that he would have when he spoke all that ishmael might live before thee god still promised to bless ishmael and in genesis 21 verse 17 and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hague or out of heaven and said unto her what aoeth hagar fear not for god have heard thy voice had heard the voice of the lad where he is so god hears our voice no matter where we're at and god sees our distresses and our pains and our hurts and his ears are open to the cries of his people god pours out his his mercy to them who are humble and of a broken contract spirit we can see here that both hagar and and ishmael they were they were broken and the angel of god said fear not use the words fear not the the same words that the angel said to mary fear not the same words that jesus said fear not little fly it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and it's encouraging to know that when we're suffering we're going through something that god is there saying fear not verse 18 arise lift up the lad and hold him in thy hand for i will make him a great nation what a comfort that must have been in that moment of distress that there was a future and not just a an okay future but this was a he was going to make a great nation out of ishmael it was the promise of god yes it was the same promise that he told abraham here in genesis 17 verse 20 and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i will bless him and i will make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great i i'd just say that would be the the thing that every father and mother would want to hear about their their children something like that uh no doubt god has blessed ishmael blessed ishmael and his descendants but i'll say naturally great arab nations today that hold all the mo a lot of oil and diamonds and rubies and silk and just many many blessings have come out from ishmael the reason why is because god established as it were i'm just saying as it were like a covenant but it was a natural covenant he promised to bless them but they weren't spiritual blessings they were natural blessings this was not an everlasting covenant it was a temporal covenant established on natural things and it was the prosperity of this life this natural life behold i will bless him and make him fruitful multiplying because any twelve princes shall he be get and i will make him a great nation you could say just like jesus said the the the rain falls on the just and the unjust the blessings of god falls on on on the just and the unjust now he blessed ishmael in a mighty way and even though god's blessings uh even though god blessed abraham's natural seed god told abraham in genesis 17 20 21 but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear god made an unconditional covenant with abraham and it at times it just it was out of the scope out of the reach or out of the understanding of abraham at times because he just kept waiting nothing was happening he was getting older as he was waiting things were just getting harder getting further away his understanding was it was telling them that things are getting further away and it's hard for us believers when we're going through our tests and our trials how am i ever going to be like christ when it just seems to be getting harder and harder with the spirits in this age getting worse and worse but we've got to be believers we are the seed of abraham we are the believers just like abraham now abraham was chosen by god to bring forth this spiritual seed god foreknew isaac he was predestinated he was the elected by the sovereign will of god abraham never concocted it was it was it was god that told uh abraham what was going to happen it was an unconditional uh covenant with um with spiritual blessings god tells abraham in genesis 17 verse 19 i will establish my covenant with him for an ever lasting covenant and with his seed after him now he never said this about ishmael he never said this about the natural seed but i praise god he said it about abraham's spiritual seed which is us what do we have to fear amen we're believers of god there's nothing to fear if god's force who's going to be against us why should we be questioning our position in christ we we shouldn't let the devil push us around in our minds i mean we're a family we belong to christ and we protect and help our family does there anybody here that has a family member you just feel like i could care less about no and when you're the true seed of christ cares about the true seed of christ so who can separate us from christ we're just as much a part of this everlasting covenant as abraham and isaac were yes sir amen because we're the same seed and that seed is christ and it's through faith it's the seed of christ through faith now you might say brother john how do i know i'm really of that seed if i just if i just knew then you know i could just relax it's really simple you believe like abraham believed that's it right amen if you're looking for the evidence be a believer like he believed amen romans 4 verse 16 says therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure the promise might be sure to all the seed not to them only which are of the law but to them also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all simply believe like abraham believed brother brandon said in the message jehovah jibril he says now we are abraham's seed if we are in christ and then if you are abraham's seed you have the same faith as abraham had so if you are in christ you have a supersede a a super to what abraham was because you come by the royal seed christ if you are dead in christ then you are abraham's children if you're dead in christ you're abraham's children and you have abraham's seed and abraham's faith and abraham's faith was in god's word regardless of what took place he called those things which were not as though they were because god says so what a promise we have face final resting places in the word and we just have to take god's word and just don't lean to our own understanding don't try to figure things out don't don't try to you know have it to be so perfect in here because the devil will confuse your mind he's the author of confusion you just got to take that word and believe it and let everything let the dominoes fall where they're going to fall now both of these seeds are holding on to the promises that god made their father abraham they want to be great they want to be fruitful they want to multiply they want god's blessings in their life both seeds believe in god both seeds believe that abraham is their father of their faith both seeds believe that god had made a covenant with them both seeds believe in serving and following the god of abraham can you say amen to these things now one seed is a spiritual seed and it was started by god through faith the other seed is a natural seed and it was started by man it was man's desire for god's promise but it was without total reliance on god there's the difference still wanting the promise of god but it wasn't a total reliance on god it was missing the substance of faith and we know that without faith it's impossible to please god so god wasn't pleased with that right we can be see we can we can see that there's there's similarities and there's differences here jesus speaking of our day he says the two spirits would be so close that if it were if it were possible the very elect would be deceived but we know the elect cannot be deceived because you can't deceive god and the elect are a part of god now we all got an opinion we all got opinion but i'll tell you it's it's not very easy to see who's seed and who's not should we even be thinking who is seed and who is not no we don't know we don't know we don't know but sometimes we think we know sometimes the devil tells us and gets our minds going in certain ways brother branham said that they're both religious they're both fundamental they both believe in worship and offerings and sacrifices look at genesis 21 verse 20 says god was with ishmael think about that god was with ishmael and he grew and he dwelt in the wilderness and he became an archer god promised him i'm going to bless him i'm going to make him a great nation he's going to have 12 princes god was with him and the believers are not careful they can focus too much on the natural in other words being content that god's with them and having these natural blessings being content with their their spiritual condition that there's really not a need to press towards the mark for anything more no need to labor to enter in to the rest of god's nature now i'll tell you this is not nothing that we would verbally say this is not like anything that we'd verbally talk about but these are thoughts that the devil puts in her head and that's what causes lukewarm laodicea to become so strong in our nature come on amen now god was with ishmael and his children and he blessed them god was with the children of israel for 45 years and he blessed them we know their shoes didn't wear out that god just met their needs physically but it seemed that they were content living outside of the promised land just how far can god bless the natural seed of abraham how just how far can the blessings of god go to the natural seed of abraham they can never be heir with the spiritual seed galatians chapter 4 verse 22 is this i just want to know is this seen what i've said this so far does this seem to is it is it easy to understand what i'm saying okay for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondwoman the other by a free woman but he was born of the bondwoman uh was born after the flesh but he that was of the free woman was born by promise i'm sorry yeah okay verse 30 you're with me nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman should not be heir with the son of the free woman so we see here that there was a separation the blessings only go so far with ishmael right but but with isaac they go into eternity they're eternal blessings we're talking about nature a nature change ishmael there there's nothing in there about nature change it was just the blessings of god the blessings to the natural seed of abraham they're limited but the blessings to the spiritual seed of abraham they are limitless now it doesn't mean i like this testimony that we heard of uh brother mark this morning about healing uh the scripture tells us a wonderful testimony don't forget this thought here brother branham said that every redemptive we have claims to every redemptive promise he paid for it and naturally we all want to be perfectly well ex especially those of us that battle some sort of horrible sickness and god paid for that healing i want you to think about these problems surely he bore our griefs and carried our sorrows he was wounded for a transgression bruised for iniquities chastisement our peace was upon and with his stripes we are healed now that healing can be natural or spiritual but if we don't take if a man doesn't take advantage of a nature change what good would it do to be forgiven of your past when your future continues to be what your past was so the spiritual promise is for a nature change it is nothing to do with ishmael's promise but we get natural blessings and spiritual blessings if you think about it abraham was he was blessed right he was blessed naturally but he was blessed spiritually where ishmael you might not appoint yeah he's blessed naturally but he wasn't blessed spiritually in fact abraham had to separate kept kept having to separate separate from la separate well lot didn't man i'll tell you as long as lot stayed with abraham he was better off as long as lot stayed with abraham he was spiritually better off but soon as he separated from that he began to pitch his tent towards the world i'm not saying that he didn't grow naturally in blessings he became the mayor right but spiritually it his righteous soul was vexed daily now both seeds were promised blessings yet there was a separation between the two one the blessings were tied now catch this to this natural life the other one the blessings were connected to a spiritual life in other words they were heirs with god heirs with god and this is what i love about this is because i can't have the nature of jesus christ i can have greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world i can have the overcomer living inside of me where i can fear nothing out there god never said i am the god of abraham ishmael and his twelve sons he said i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob he bore witness of whose heirs were who he was connected to oh that's what i want today for me you know when they came out of egypt they were a mixed multitude but when they went into the promised land it was only the elect god bore witness to his heirs joshua and caleb numbers 14 24 says but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and have followed me fully him will i bring into the land wherein he went and his seed shall possess it so here it was god was making a separation they were both his children he called both of them his children but he made a separation and it was because those that followed him holy they got the promise those that followed him partially didn't get all the the spiritual promise amen i hope you can see yourself in the scriptures i want to be identified with god's spiritual promises amen now our promised land is the nature of christ living inside of each and every one of us it's the promised land that that god lives inside he's completely got control now here's the thing none of us can say i'm a i'm a perfect illustration of jesus christ but but here's the thing as the seed of abraham that should be our goal that should be our focus that's what we should be looking to it should mean a lot to us that's why we come to church find out where we're at in that aspect because we're after that we're not after just the natural blessings and and not much of a focus on that nature change see too much satan has got so many people just oh you know you've got the holy ghost you're saved you're in now just build your natural life it's a trick i will not be satisfied until i awake in his his lightness his nature until he can handle things the way he handles them until i can overcome like he overcome like i can and and and become love joy peace long-suffering gentle because that is the air that's the the spiritual uh promise the the the the heir of of abraham's seed it's it's christ well what is christ christ in you the the hope of glory it is the the nature change where where people look at you and you're no longer seen you're seen as miss jesus that's christ in you the hope of glory romans 8 chapter 15 15. uh romans 8 chapter 15. that doesn't make sense romans chapter 8 verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby your your something is happening inside now when you we've had our grandchildren over we had this week a number of grandchildren we had over and two of them were babies and they cried and i'll tell you there is a when there is a crying baby um they want something strongly they don't know quite how to go after it but like any baby that's wanting something they get cry they cry and then they get the attention and that's what we have to do we have to cry abba father but what what are we wanting what are we wanting are we wanting these natural things are we focusing on the nature change see the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god spiritually speaking now something inside the spirit inside that lives in us is bearing witness that we're connected to the to the spiritual promises of god there's a yearning to be in the image of god there's something crying out oh that it might be like jesus you know we do a situation and we we stumble we fall we say things we shouldn't we do things we shouldn't and we just kind of like kick it like that and keep walking but something inside the spiritual seed of god says i want to be a just like jesus i want to better handle that situation just like jesus and it's a constant crying it's a constant journey it's a it's a deep calling to the deep that their eyes are fixed on the spiritual promise we are the seed of god we are the of the faith of abraham and our focus is on the spiritual not the natural and if children verse 17 then were heirs heirs of god joiners with christ if so be that we if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now why in the world would they just drop this little thing about suffering in here when we're having such a good time talking about being joint heirs with jesus christ because what it takes if we don't mortify the deeds of the flesh if we don't not willing to die out deny our will how can we become in the nature of jesus christ for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us that we will be able to see christ manifested in the flesh once again that's the glory that shall be revealed in us not to us in us in what you know it's what we live for the earnest expectation of the creature or the creation it's waiting for this manifestation to take place waiting no wonder we the seed of abraham are crying out i'm a father fill me with your spirit we're not lost in laodicea content with what we have spiritually and then just trying to build our lives naturally we're not of that natural seed we have the spiritual seed of christ it's recognizing your position the natural seed focus on natural blessings the spiritual seed focus on spiritual blessings the spiritual blessings of the nature change we are changed from glory unto glory amen we're looking to our desires to be more look like our heavenly father you know satan has really tricked a lot of people into thinking that somehow that just happens on rapture mourning we all want to be changed and the more that we're willing to deny this flesh who always wants to be king in la in our life the more we're going to die out to that ishmael nature that we were born with right we were born uh we're shaping in iniquity the more we can die out to that thing crucify it the more god has liberty and the more we'll just be like him i mean yes one day we're going to wake up and we're going to be in heaven it's going to happen we're going to be we're going to go on a rapture we're going to be in heaven we're going to be like christ but isn't it exciting to the believer who just wants to wake up and be a little bit more like him that day isn't there just something that's just not satisfied there's a yearning and a calling to me that's the spiritual seed it's looking for that promise now i'm thankful for all the victories that christ has given me in my life but i'm by far not satisfied because my flesh has gotten in the way too many times so it's a battle but branham said in in the message a greater than solomon is here he said and jesus said a sower went forth and he sold seeds and some sold good seeds and and and an evil man sold tares and the husbandman which is the pastor said shall we pull out the tares and he said well if the pastor said it's probably in the church right and he said you'll up the wheat with it he said let them grow together let them grow together so there's no separating church natural and church spiritual but the church spiritual is the elected church it's the called out it's the set aside by god alone and they are the ones that will hear the word of the lord there's nothing we don't have scripture to make decisions who is and who isn't and to take out and to pull in brother branham says you there's no way of separating the church natural and the church spiritual not our job but god distincts the difference god distincts the difference romans 9 verse 6 not as though the word of god have taken none effect for they are not all israel which are of israel what does that mean not all jews are jews not all christians are christians not all believers are believers not they are not all of israel which are of israel neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh they are not the children of god amen now that's a strong scripture it's a strong word that didn't come from brother john that's just the word amen they that are the children of the flesh they are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed that's why we must be born again it's why we must rot out to this a this nature that that that doesn't want to go through we've got to be born of the will of god we've got to take on the seed of god by faith that believes that i will become like christ john said he came to his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power hallelujah power to become a son of god even to them that believe on his name you know what it's like when you you meet somebody's son that you haven't seen for a while or somebody's daughter that you haven't seen for a while or or a baby and the first thing you're doing is you're trying to look to see if there's some resemblance you're looking for a resemblance look like mom or dad i mean if we're a son and daughter of god there's a looking for some resemblance we're looking for some resemblance but it's see it's in character and they're going to come with sign lines and wonder signs and wonders and but there but there's if you focus on a complete new birth if you let that be your focus you're focusing on the right thing i'm glad that god has started the new birth in me and i can say by faith i'm born again but i also also have to say i'm not completely in his image i don't completely look like him but i am pressing towards that mark for the prize of the high callings and it's it's it's what i believe the spiritual seed is focused on jesus said you must be born again the natural seed of abraham cannot be heirs with the spiritual seed that's why our first birth can enter in it's basically an ishmael birth we were all born by the will of man just like ishmael was that's why we have to be born again be born by the promise of god by the spiritual promise of god by faith that's how it happens it doesn't well when i begin to see jesus a little bit more inside of me then i'll have confidence no no no no you believe it before it happens just like abraham because you're the seed of abraham god is god is looking for his seed to be like him we're we're being called back to the image of christ amen now we the seed the spiritual seed are longing for spiritual blessings and the spiritual blessings that i'm talking about is a nature change i mean i'm i i love when god's presence comes sometimes you're just you're in prayer sometimes you're listening to some song sometimes you hear a test something happens to you and a blessing just falls on you it's his presence and it's it's just wonderful and and and honestly nothing can compare with god's presence but i if i understand the scriptures that same blessing can fall on the just and the unjust brother i've talked about the tares say praise the lord praise the lord but see something that gives you victory it's your walk it's what happens on a regular basis it's how you handle the devil it's how you handle the devil when he comes to your mind he tries getting in your home he tries getting into your church he tries getting into your workplace it's how you handle the devil i'd rather have that i'd rather have that than all the blessings have fallen on this natural guy because i need god on on the inside of me i need him on the inside because when you're facing a demon when you're facing you know like brother brandon says when you get off that plane you got to have thus saith the lord you you you you are facing demons that are attacking and he's after this message and he's after the the ministry and i just want to say i thank each and every one of you that have a burden to pray for the minister here now say with the ministry the family because um it's one thing to say it's one thing to say oh lord just bless the ministry there you know bless brother john in the ministry there and it's another thing to know that there's so many uh guns pointed at them and to be able to enter in to a uh it's one thing to say oh moses he needs his hands lifted up somebody needs to help him but it's another thing to go over there and actually help his hands stay up it's it's it's a greater effort it's easy to say well the pastor needs this and the pastor needs that and he does oh boy this past this pastor i know this pastor this i can testify this pastor needs help needs help needs prayer every time i i've never come up to the pulpit in my life ever feeling worthy to be here ever there hasn't been a time had a dollar for every thought that i had i would just love to sit down and support i i'm i honestly i feel like i'm such a good supporter such a good servant but this leadership role you just can't seem to appease everybody you know what i'm trying to say here and uh so i appreciate your prayers and i want to say is at this moment thank you for for your long suffering with me thank you for bearing with me thank you for for believing in the word above me but we're looking for the spiritual blessings we're wanting to move forward in the new birth not unborn again but move forward in it move forward into this which says he that hit which had begun a good work in you shall perform it okay the the new birth started but let's continue in it amen till old things are passed away and all things become new and all things are of god now that's the spiritual seed of abraham first peter chapter 1 verse 22 senior purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren my see that you love one another with a pure heart once in a while fervently being born again not of the corruptible seed but of incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever amen i'm looking for that jesus christ the same yesterday and forever inside of me now the spiritual seed is looking for spiritual blessings of the nature change first john chapter 3 verse 2 beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear but we know that when he show up here we're going to be just like him we're going to see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him what does he do wow he purifies himself he actually is doing something all because of this he has a hope to to manifest christ inside of them it's not that we're not pure we are pure but we want to be pure it's it's not that we're not like christ we just want to be more like christ this is how sometimes our ministry can be misunderstood the spiritual seed is purifying their souls in obeying the truth it's through faith it's not through ability it's not through i know i'm something no we know we're nothing we we we need god's grace so i'm just gonna i'm gonna believe god i'm gonna i'm gonna purify my my myself i'm gonna i'm i'm gonna obey the word that i heard at church i'm gonna go home and i'm gonna spend time in prayer praying that god would move anything out of the way that's keeping me from fulfilling the word of god for my life it's that simple it's it's your relationship with god that you're getting down to business now the natural seed is looking for natural blessings without the nature change they're not they're not focusing on the nature change they're they're not focused on it their main focus is just on natural blessings the blessings of the family i mean ishmael's family was blessed god promised me 12 princes we're going to have 12 nations focus not worrying about the character in the home not worrying about any are we praying like we should are we are we talking about other people in our homes come on now now here's the thing it's got to change sometimes this the seed the spiritual seed there are so many i i can take any one i can take any person here and i can talk to you and talk to anybody about you except a couple of these little guys jonathan i don't know much about you and but but for the most part i know enough about you that i can say some negative things about you right but what good would that do what [Music] but good and we could we all could do that we all could do that because we we see one another we know one another's faults and at the end of the conversation that we spoke the truth what good would it do what is it edified what is it helped i'm not going to better preach everything anyway so i'm also just saying what i want to say satan is the accuser of the brethren and i i mean the scripture to the spiritual seed you know where's we're supposed to put that stuff away the scripture says put it away just put it away i know it's bothering you i know it's true put it away if you are really bothered about somebody or something this is what you do you get down on your knees and you pray until god shows you how to help how to help and don't limit yourself to i can't help don't do that you're not you know you may be limited but god ain't limited all you're doing is testifying of how much god's in you and if that's how you feel then you need to stay there until you get more of jesus inside of you because somewhere down the line even if you're not to go to them god will use your faith in prayer to take care of the situation because you're of the seed of abraham you're the faith of abraham we're just following in our father's footsteps amen but where it's not it's not a uh some you know god didn't give us something private faith for just us if he did then we wouldn't be associated with a spiritual family with spiritual needs we we if god shows you something in the body let god use you to help that need yes i'm telling you you let me just say this in your own personal family if there was a problem did did the arguing and fighting ever work no did proving who was right who was wrong did that ever work did you ever feel good even when you won the argument oh even when there's a problem in the home you you come together and you pray and even though there may have not been a a swift confession at that moment god began to start something he began to work on this situation because god honors when we humble ourselves and say god you know we can't handle this i know we need you and all you're doing is manifesting christ you're manifesting christ i love this word amen now time is up and i won't keep you i won't keep you another hour can i give you some scripture street all right oh my my there's so much here well let me ask you this question well now that's the see this is the situation sometimes when you're preaching you're just you you have too much i'm going to give you the scriptures john 8 33 through 44. now here in these scriptures jesus begins to deal with the natural seed and the spiritual seed can we at least do this one can we at least do this one okay the rest of the scriptures galatians 4 28-31 galatians 5 16-26 luke 13 10 through 17. now what i'll tell you about this i remember i told you that god always bears witness of his of his heirs that's what luke 13 10 is and then john um 8 31 31-37 say it again the galatians yes galatians 5 16-26 luke 19 1 through 10. what you're going to see here when you read these scriptures is that there's the uh natural seed the spiritual seed you're going to see that god identifies himself with the seat of abraham he calls a woman she's a daughter of abraham calls uh uh zacharias he did all these bad things taking advantage of people and then he says jesus said he's the son of abraham and he be he changes he changes he he wants to give back fourfold everything he took of anybody and his his nature began to change because he was the seed of abraham and the reason i want to go through john chapter 8 if i could and just take a few minutes on here because this this can be kind of difficult to catch it but starting here with verse 33 they answered him we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free verse 36 if the son shall make you free then you should be free indeed now that's what i want i don't want to be controlled by some overpowering hate some overpowering jealousy some overpowering uh anger some overpowering frustration i want to be set free the thing is i need the i am a present help in a time of trouble with me not a god of the past not a god of the future but the i am with me know that ye are abraham's seed so hear jesus come out and he confesses i know that you're abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word have no place in you he's acknowledging their abraham seed but the fact that he's saying that you seek to kill me now he's starting to show that there's two there's two different seeds here there's two different seeds of abraham i speak that which i seen with my father and you do that which you see with your father you can be of the natural seed of abraham and be of the spiritual seed of satan religious you know and brother bran teaches us in the message verse 39 um they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abraham's children he would do the works of abraham so now he's trying to say i you can certainly be identified whether it's natural cedar spiritual seed here that's what he's saying at this point they're confessing to be heirs of the coming of the promise the spiritual seed that's what they're confessing but jesus says no but now ye seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham so he's saying yeah you're the seed of abraham i'm okay but the spiritual seed don't do this the spiritual seed don't kill just just because they don't kill period you know brother brandon talked about saying things to other people behind someone's back it's called murdering them killing their influence killing some influence that they could have with that person down the road but you decided to say something he says that's the same thing as murder that's what the prophet told us so we see that and of course before we were born again we were doing that stuff all the time but by faith being born again receiving the spiritual seed the being born by the will of god we just don't do that no more we just don't do it and when we do we make it right i know this may seem to be strong and hard but listen this we're we're just going off what what jesus said this did not abraham nor his spiritual seed it was the natural seed of abraham that did this jesus was taking their natural seed of abraham and bringing it back to the spiritual seat of the enemy the devil you do the deeds of your father verse 41 they said they said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god see how religious and strong they are and you know they're pointing a finger at jesus you're a fornicator you were born a fornication that's what they were doing they were calling them out because he was born out of wedlock in their eyes we were not born a fornication your mother your mother found you before you were married come on this is not pointed at anybody this is just just stating the facts jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me think about that if we are god's spiritual seed we will love right amen amen proceeded forth and came from god neither came i myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word jesus told pilate everyone that is of truth heareth by voice my sheep hear my voice and they follow me we're hearing the word of god what god wants us to do hmm last verse ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do. he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not the truth because there is no truth in him where he speaketh the law he speaketh what of his own for he is a liar and the father of it amen it's scary because these these people were the most religious people on the planet at that time there was nobody they were even identifying themselves they could prove they were of the seed of abraham but yet they they weren't of the covenant the spiritual covenant it was the natural but not the spiritual and so i just want to saints as we move forward to focus let's put our attention on what god has really promised the heir of abraham the heir of god what has he made his joint heir with he's taken us back to his nature let us focus on that let that become the most important thing let's let that be the thing that we talk about at the dinner table the things that we talk about you know if we just say you know we all need to be more like christ let's pray for so and so and let's let's help so and so let's intercede for so and so we all need the nature of christ i'm telling you this will get the train down the track this will help us to to grow like like god is calling us to grow amen let's stand together and those scriptures that i gave you they were not all homework by the way that's just that's just extra curriculum you know how you if you did extra work you got extra points and i i believe that god will just give you extra blessings if you spend some time just seeking that nature of christ now we are the seed the spiritual seed of abraham by faith all of us every one of us believe it no matter what don't wait till you see it believe it because we're all in the process of becoming more like jesus and i i want to continue to be born or manifested from that original birth that took place amen praise the lord amen let's sing a couple songs i wasn't um how many got something out of the message and praise the lord may jesus bless each and every one of us and and those that are not here you know they're they're sick they're afflicted there's a number a number of people that would rather be here i'm sure brother ron husker would rather have his health strong enough to be here than being in bed and brother marty and sister kathleen and brother jonathan and and others so let's just remember remember to pray for them amen let's let's sing um a child of the king a child of the king how many how many is a child of the king let's sing it like you believe it amen that's enough that's all i know oh yes i'm a child of the king his royal blood now flows through by vain and god who is red and found now can sing praise god [Music] god i'm praise of the king oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king royal blood now flows through my bank and i who was wretched and violent now can sing praise god praise god i'm a child of the king one more time oh yes oh yes have a child of the king let him know his royal blood now flows through my veins and god who is wretched and vow now can sing praise god praise god i'm a child of the king amen every promise in the book of mine you want to claim it every promise whatever you're desiring claim it every promise in the book is my every chapter every verse every lie i am trusting in his love divine promise in the book is mine every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse [Applause] [Music] what's on your mind every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every lie i am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine [Music] amen i would not be not deny that's in c as i was going through the songs i thought i'd write them down i wanted to stay an f and try to help but you know i just we need to claim what we're after we need to claim what we're after amen when pains of death is gone my soul to the lord i cried till jesus came and made me holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] till jesus came and made me holy [Music] as jacob in the days of old i dressed [Music] i would not be [Applause] till jesus came and made me [Music] oh satan said my lord was [Music] but praise the lord the work is done and christ the lord is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus came and made me oh i would [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen let's sing that third verse again oh satan said my lord was gone and could not hear my prayer but praise the lord the work is gone [Music] you
