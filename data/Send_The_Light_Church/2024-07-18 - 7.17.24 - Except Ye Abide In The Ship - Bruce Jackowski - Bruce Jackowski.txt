amen amen that's a good place to put your faith amen amen if you uh turn with me this afternoon this evening evening to Acts chapter 27 praise the lord it's nice and cool in here Don and I were walking across the front and the breeze was coming across the field I said we just tell everybody come out here and sit down with some blankets and I'll preach out here my voice is loud enough acts 27 uh verse 14 but not not long after there arose against it a temptu wind called uren and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive and running under a certain Island which is called Claudia we had much work to come by the boat which when they had taken up they used helps under ging the ship and fearing lest they should fall unto the quicksands they stri the sail and so were driven and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship and the third day we cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship and when neither Sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small Tempest lay on us all hope that we should ever be saved was then taken away by our heads for a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord thankful for your word we're thankful that there's an example there's always an answer to every question in your scriptures Lord in perilous times Lord Paul made this journey but you were with him and I pray tonight Lord as we look into your word that father we'll see the answer to so many questions and we'll see Lord how you want us to live I just pray that you forgive us of our sins forgive us of our short comings may you just come and walk with us Lord break the bread of life Lord may you speak to every heart in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated so I like to speak to you for a while on except you abide in the ship so we find out that our scene opens here that they had just started on a little journey and it got very dangerous the wind was blowing and the sea was contrary and and what's this uh Ura uren means it's a strong easterly Mediterranean wind it it came in unexpected of them and the ship was tossed and and the Bible says there in verse 15 it says so when the ship was caught and could not bear into the wind we gave up we just let her drive because the wind was contrary we couldn't we couldn't control we couldn't say well we were going to go here today or we're going to go there tomorrow or we we just let it go with the wind because we didn't have any choice it was so it was a temptu wind and if you've ever seen in I mean those movies when the storm comes up and the waves I mean 70 foot waves and the wind you in the Mediterranean had some really horrible storms a year ago there was a a they called it a Mediterranean hurricane and we're not used to a Mediterranean hurricane but it it hit Libya and it blew out a dam and a whole city washed into the sea it just washed into the sea and here's Paul and and these people on this boat and and the wind was so contrary everything was just it was such a disaster and he says so he said we we we couldn't e we couldn't be we couldn't even drive our ship so we just we just let her go and running under a certain Island which is called Claudia we had much work to come by the boat so they were struggling there was it was a temptu time there was there was the water was coming it was blowing on them there lightning was flashing rain it was horrible and which they had taken up they used helps under ging the ship and and Don and I have seen some of these these old movies you know from the 1800s and the 1700s when the ship and the water starts to come in the bottom of it in fact we were up uh in Lake Erie we're up coming up on Buffalo and we went on and we stopped and we saw where they had built a fort and and the ship the ship it start when the water gets you know they build the ship with dry wood but then when it gets wet it swells shut but when the storm gets too strong the water can come in through there and then they have jacks they have Jacks and things and and they they stretch it across the the bow of the ship inside where the ribbing is and everything and they try to make sure that it will hold fast and that's what he's talking about here you got to get the picture that this was a rough rough rough time it was a horrible time so they undergirded the ship fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands they stri the sail which means they lowered all the sails and they still were driven they were afraid for their lives they couldn't figure out what was going to happen they didn't know what was going on they knew where they wanted to go but they couldn't get there amen and we being exceedingly tossed with the Tempest the next day they lightened the ship and the third day we cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship they started to throw the the seats overboard anything that was not tied down they threw it overboard because they wanted to survive and the waves were still contrary everything was such a disaster for them amen and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship and when neither Sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small Tempest lay on us and hope that we should be saved was taken away Amen brother brandham said when Paul was out on the ocean that night 14 days nights without moon or Stars why all hopes was gone is that right no hope at all on those seamen oh though men with Barnacles on them almost they'd been in the sea so long and they said all hopes is gone if they should ever live and even he said' look at Paul when he was Shipwrecked out there why he had lost his hopes too Paul lost all hope the waves everything it looked terrible it was horrible time and they had gotten very discouraged but verse 21 Paul says but after long absence Paul stood forth in the midst of them I'm so glad that Paul didn't give up on prayer everything his hope everything everything was gone and he went down and he got down and he prayed he got down and asked the Lord what is it you'd have me to do we spend so much time looking at all the things going around in the Tempest and the wind and the rain and everything else when God says get down on your knees and pray and I will hear from heaven and Paul had lost all his hope but he had his rest in a God that had saved him somebody he had met on the Damascus Road he had that that Assurance in his heart if I get down and I pray he will hear from Heaven he will answer me amen amen after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and he said s you should have hearkened unto me and not have Lo loose from CRE and to have gained this harm and loss you should have [Music] listened and now I exhort you to be of good share for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve and the angel said fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore s be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as he has told me praise the Lord amen but standing down in the galley well wait a minute say so all hopes Paul his hopes was gone the little old ship was water logged 14 days and nights no moon stars or nothing you look at that from verse 19 up there it says in the third day we cast out everything and it was 14 days storm water nothing to eat they had things to eat but was afraid to eat because you know when you eat on a boat that's doing like this and going like this you're going to throw it right back up and then nothing to drink 14 days but Paul he went down and he cried out to God Amen that little old ship was water and they couldn't see no Knights there was no moon no stars or nothing the little boat tossed about in the waters and everything and Paul said well I guess all hopes is gone so he didn't know Paul gave up and he and he went down into the into the belly of the ship and he prayed till he got a hold of God brother Brenham said but standing down in the gallery that night praying pring a vision come before him and he saw the angel of the Lord come and said Don't Fear Paul don't fear there's something I've got to you to do you're going before Caesar there's something God has for us to do don't fear don't get all caught up in the Tempest and the storm and the wind and everything blowing Every Which Way oh it looks horrible but pray to God amen amen that's right and lo God give all these that sail with you is given to you so therefore you be of good courage and you go on out and have good courage and little old Paul right in the middle of the storm just think of it a water flying everywhere I wish I had a a fire hose just throw it on you and have the water everywhere salt water and lightning and wind and it's cold and everything and Paul goes out in the midst of that and says be of good cheer brother John be of good cheer sister Linda be in good cheer everything's blowing up when God gets a hold of a man he acts contrary to all the circumstances around him amen little old Paul right in the middle of the storm he run on the outside shaking his hands and screaming at the top of his voice saying be of good courage brethren for there stood the angel of God before me last night saying don't be scared oh yeah my brother you know this is oh this oh oh look what you got your eyes on amen amen don't be scared we are going going to come right before Caesar and I tell you there's not one of you is going to die not one hair of the head is going to perish but we're going the ship's going to be wrecked somewhere and in the vision I seen it sitting on the shore wrecked somewhere but there's nothing going to harm us let's take something and eat amen I believe God verse 25 that it shall be even as he has told me and how be it we must be cast Upon A Certain Island but when the 14th day was come as we were driven up and down in adaa and adri that's a adrionic sea and that's a if you don't know where the adrionic sea is it's that it's that body of water between the heel of Italy and the Balkans it it goes up in there where Italy becomes like a peninsula and that's where they were at and he says so we were up up and down in the adrionic sea and about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country oh the wind was still blowing the storm was still going on but they they they said we we believe we're getting close to some land and they sounded and found it 20 fathoms and when they had gone a little farther they sounded again and they found it 15 fathoms and then fearing lest they should have fallen upon the rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day amen and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship they still didn't believe Paul they didn't believe him they were still looking at all the circumstances they were still trusting in the arm of Flesh oh if I can just put the anchor out here we can survive and then it got to the point where they thought for sure they couldn't survive and they were getting off every man for himself you know that's how it is today every man for himself get do whatever you got to do brother I don't care just do what you got to do they cast four anchors out of the stern and they wish for the day amen and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the Lifeboat they let it down into the Sea Under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the force ship Paul said he turned to the C tan and to the soldiers and he said except you abide in this ship you cannot be saved you've got a decision to make amen amen and while the day was coming on Paul besought them all to take meat saying this day is the 14th day that we have carried and continued fasting so they hadn't eaten in 14 days having taken nothing and wherefore I pray you to take some meat for this is for your health for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you and it's like he's preaching to deaf ears amen amen he's preaching to DEA ears brother said oh they they was afraid to do it and Paul went and he got a sandwich and he made it and he started eating why he wasn't scared because God had said so and that anchored in Paul's heart amen amen he says for there shall not a air a hair fall from the head of any of you and when he had thus spoken he took bread and he gave thanks to God in the presence of them all he didn't hide it he didn't just stand off in the corner but in the presence of them all he said Thank You Lord and the wave hit him thank you Lord and the rain and the Thunder was still clattering thank you Lord for this bread I'll eat it and all of them standing there looking at him this man is out of his mind amen amen and he had and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat and then were they all of good cheer because of his attitude in the midst of the storm because of his faith all these discouraged men felt encouraged you think you can't do anything but your attitude in the life that you live and how you present yourself God will reward you for that amen they was afraid to do it Paul went and got the sandwich he made it he started eating why he wasn't scared God done said so and it anchored in Paul's sh heart and I don't care the ship was pitching just as hard as it could there was no stars no moon days passed on by that didn't work Paul didn't worry Paul a bit I imagine one sandwich after another walking up and down the deck saying glory to God we're not far from Land Brothers another wave another thing you know another and the wind is contrary everything's going wrong but Paul had his eyes focused on the Unseen amen amen there you are no matter how dark it got the whale might have come up to turn the ship over the Sharks following them by the hundreds and that didn't phase Paul no sir he knew what God had said he believed what God had said he said wherefore Brethren be of good courage for I believe God praise the Lord I don't care what happens I believe God what do you believe well I don't know I believe this and I believe oh I did you see this did I so I'm sh oh oh oh we we better oh you know and people are so tossed about I believe God and that it'll be just as he has showed it to me and that's Faith amen verse 36 he says and they were then they were all of good cheer and they also took some meat and they takeen and they eat and eating and they got encouraged because they believed what did they believe they believed Paul's testimony cuz I'm going to show you they still was really afraid but they believed T Paul's testimony and he was able to lift them all up out of their fear to get be encouraged it was able to do that because they believed Paul believed that what God told him was the truth and now it was several days before they were ever shipwreck yeah the evidence everything was against what he was saying but yet Paul believed God every everything that you could put your hand on was shaken everything that you could look at all the circumstances everything but Paul said God has told me I must go to Caesar amen it was several days before they were ever Shipwrecked or gone on the island but God God brought it to pass because they believed it don't you fear amen I want you to look at Psalms 2 1-6 praise the Lord amen amen amen why do the heathens rage and the people imagine a vain thing they all thought they were going to sink why were they all upset cuz their trust wasn't in the Lord the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed against Paul against the anointed they oh they we've got armies we got Authority I got power we can do all these things let us break their bands aunder and Cast Away their cord from us let's get rid of those those crazy Believers and he that sth in the heaven shall laugh yeah he that sit in the heaven will laugh the Lord shall have them in derision they'll be all confused won't know what's going I mean everybody's all confused on wonder but the God's anointed they've heard a sure word praise the Lord then shall he speak unto them this is the Lord in his wrath and Vex them in his sore displeasure yet have I set my king upon my holy hell in Zion God shall lift you up amongst your brethren God will lift you up in the community where you live God will lift you up above everyone if you trust in him oh oh yeah but you know whatever word you want to fulfill that's the part if you're all mad if you're all confused God will stand against you amen let's look here at Matthew 24 praise the Lord amen praise God Amen in Matthew 24:33 he says so likewise when you shall see all these things what things all the things that we're seeing right now all these things know that it is near even at the door verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away amen God sent an angel to Paul because Paul prayed in the midst of the storm and God gave Paul a sure word and when Paul believed that word he went and testified of that word am and he even caused those around him to be encouraged because they could see in Paul that he believed what he said amen Amen brother Bram said so he he said he will keep his promise to Abraham and his seed amen and the promise was given unconditionally I like that we need to start believing that you know that means there's no conditions God said I will I will do it he tried it before brother B said he tried it he tried it with adamy just gave him a little bit of word to keep and it fell he gave it to the next guy and it fell and it fell and it fell but when he came to Abraham he said Abraham come on I'm taking you out of ir ches I'm taking you a place you've never seen before and I will bless you and there's nobody going to stop it because I'm going to do the blessings and it's unconditional it doesn't dependent on how many times you fall it dependent on on how it's I am God and when he could swear by no other he swore by himself right amen and brother random said so what we're trying to do here he was starting a a healing campaign he says is to get fear out of people's hearts and mind that's the greatest curse that's in the church today is the people who are afraid but what are they afraid of to lay hold of God's word not what Instagram says or X or truth social or what the news says or that news channel not what they say but what God's word says we're all tossed about because we've forsaken the word of God the greatest curse that's in the church today is people are afraid afraid to lay hold of God's word the promise how can God ever take back one of his words it would be easier as we said last night for all the stars to just vanish out of the Skies the Sun the moon the Earth to pass away but you see God's word can never pass away it's Eternal and it's forever right and how I love to rest my weary Soul upon every word of it it's just seems like when you could just hang it up there and say there it is it's got to happen because God said so and if God promised it God has to keep his word God has to keep his word amen let's go back to acts let's see what's going on here praise the Lord and they were all of good cheer and they also took meat and we were in all in the ship 260 and 16 Souls so that's 276 people and Paul Paul's influence was so strong that he convinced them to be of good cheer that's influence you have that unless you don't believe you're the seed of God and and when they had eaten enough I'm going to show you see they were still afraid they lightened the ship and they cast out the weed into the sea they took the last provisions of food that they had they threw that overboard because the storm was still very strong amen and when it was day they didn't even recognize where they were at but they discovered a certain Creek within the shores so they're looking and there's there's big rocks where you because they were afraid that they were going to get thrown into the Rock so they put down the four you know they put down the um the four anchors then they said okay I ain't standing with this boat we're dead and they got the Lifeboat already and and Paul looked at the Centurion and he said you know let me tell you he says you have to stay in the ship and one of the soldiers said you know I kind of believe this guy I don't there's no evidence as you read all that there is no evidence that Paul was anything he just just words didn't do a miracle before them he didn't do anything he's just he's still probably still in Chains and and there he was and when they looked they saw that there was a place there was a creek you know if you've been along a seashore there sometimes there's a tributary that goes in and where the water comes down a stream comes down and and it empties out in the sea and they saw this Safe Haven they said you know if we could get there we'd be okay and then went verse 39 so and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain Creek with a Shore into which there they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the ship and when they had taken up the anchors look at what they did they committed themselves under the sea I think I'd have committed myself under God but these guys were just they're unbelievers I mean you know they committed themselves to the Sea amen and loose the rudder bands and hoisted up the main sail in the wind and said let's do it jonal they just blindly were we're going for it they Hil hoisted up the main sail in the wind and they made toward the shore and falling into a place where the two Seas met they ran the ship around and the four parts struck fast and remained unmovable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the Waves you see the storm just because Paul got them to eat didn't mean the storm went away the storm was still there the storm was still just as violent as it had been for 14 days and the soldiers took counsel to kill all the prisoners now if they believe that Paul they wouldn't have threatened to kill him so the soldiers took counsel to kill all the prisoners unless any of them should swim out and Escape but the Centurion willing to save Paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they should all that they which could swim should cast themselves into the sea and get to land and the rest some un boards some that were on broken pieces of the ship and so it came to pass they escaped all safe to land because they listened amen Matthew 10 has a scripture that we've all heard before 10 verse 41 it says and he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward when they received Paul's message they received Paul's reward right Amen brother brandham said in questions and answers he said so brother brandom if you have time please explain Matthew 10:41 I'd like to know what a prophet's reward is well now Jesus said whosoever receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet receiveth a prophet's reward and a prophet's reward is to be a friend with the prophet whosoever receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receives a righteous man's reward is that right and if they want to know what a prophet's reward is well that's to be the friend of the Prophet the Centurion became friends and when he accepted the prophet you know Paul was a prophet right he was the first church age messenger he was a Divine interpreter of the word all the scriptures that were hidden in the Old Testament Paul revealed he wrote them all loud he wrote him in on the books don't you know who Paul was the angel to the first church age when the Centurion respected that gift in Paul he received the same reward that Paul received and that was his life and so all the 276 people that were in that boat when they received Paul's message they all got to safety doesn't mean they all got salvation but they all got to safety because they believed the voice of a Prophet so brother bandom said a prophet's reward is to be a friend of the Prophet see there's a reward he's your friend like the schite woman it might come in handy sometimes see it did with her brother M him says you see Watch God's servants amen people so quickly forget the place of the seventh angel messenger and where God has placed him in the economy of God you know when brother brandham went across the curtain at time and brother brandham got there and and the angel he said well I'm want to see Jesus and he talk about the white Throne judgment and everything else and he said well Paul well all of are these all bandoms and he said no that's your converts and he said he said well he said said will Paul be judged and he said yeah Paul will be judged and all of Paul's when Paul receives his reward all of his converts get the same reward when brother brandham said he said to me he said well praise the Lord he said I preached just what Paul said and all those that can't preach like brother brandom said one thing we are resting on that amen the only way you're getting in this thing is if you believe everything that that Prophet said that's right how do you know you were baptized right Prophet said so how do you know you got the Holy Ghost Prophet told me how to how do you know he's got the Holy Ghost he told me how what it would act like how do you know your right Prophet said so how do you know seven angels came and so on Prophet said so I believe him and God will bring that to pass but we're real quick because the storm is so strong and the winds are so contrary to all of our thinking if we will receive a prophet in the name of a prophet we will receive a prophet's reward amen praise the Lord amen what should we do now so let's go let's take a little let's take a look at the Centurion I want I want to show you some things so we're going to start at verse one of chapter 27 amen and it was determined that we should sail into Italy they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners under one named Julius a centurion of augustus's band brother brandham said well a centurion he said that's a man uh the right word would be over a century which would be a 100 men so he a he was pretty high up and entering into a ship of adrum we launched meaning to Sail by the coast of Asia one artius and Macedonian of thessalonica being with us and the next day we touched at sidon and Julius courteously entreated Paul he was he was kind to him showed him kindness gave him Liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself but he was still a prisoner the Centurion didn't know who Paul was praise the Lord and when he had launched from then we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary and when we had sailed Over the Sea of sisila and pamilia and came to Myra a city of liia and and I looked for all those places and they just said it's part of the Mediterranean Coast in Asia Minor and there the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing unto Italy and he put us thereon and when we had sailed slowly many days because the wind was starting to pick up you know 10 years ago the wind wasn't so bad 15 years ago it wasn't so bad but there's some place we got to go and the wind is getting contrary now and the waves are getting bigger and then War it's getting a little more temptu and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were some over Against cetus the Wind not suffering us we sailed under cre and over against um salmone and hardly passing it we came into a place which is called the fair Havens n weing to was the city of lassia I like that fair Havens you know that's kind of a nice safe place you know things look well them that are asleep in Zion right they forsake their own you know everybody thinks ah this is great you know but the Lord is coming the Lord's coming and we're wh it's going to be great it's going to be great and when the time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already passed Paul stood up and preached the message to them false anointed ones at the end time this day the scriptures fulfilled yeah he got up and he started preaching them marriage and divorce he started preaching the Seven Seals who is this MDC he admonished them and sent to them sir I perceive that this Voyage will be with hurt and much damage you don't have to listen to too many tapes before brother brandham starts telling you that not only of the leading and everything that we hold precious and the ship but also our lives nevertheless the Centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul the life that you you now live is fulfilling that scripture who do you believe I want to turn to Matthew 8 amen Matthew 8 we find another centu another man of authority another man of of renown and I want you to notice that every Centurion every one of them in the New Testament is a gentile there are no Jewish centurions they're all Gentiles and this German or this Gentile in verse 5 of Matthew 8 it says and when Jesus was entered into capernium there came unto a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the py grievously tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him and the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should comest under my roof because the Gentile realized the Jew looked at him as a dog and even though God has no respect of me or respect of you to even hear our prayers I plead the blood of the Lamb of God and he will hear my voice that's what the scripture says I am not worthy Lord that you'll even come into my RO into my roof but speak the word only and my servant will be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and I say to another one come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he does it and when Jesus heard that he marveled and said unto them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith not in Israel and look at the next verse and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven and those that are from the East and the West are the Gentiles we are not of the economy of God but if we believe God God will do great things for us Amen brother renam says so now look jeras he said come jerius now it's the Jew he said come and lay your hands on my daughter that was his faith because he was a Jew and they were taught laying out of hands but the Roman he didn't want that he said I'm not worthy you come under my roof just speak the word I'm a man to under Authority I'm a centurion I have a hundred men under me they have they have to do everything that I tell them if I tell one to go and another one to come they just do as I tell them I have my power and authority over them and he says and what was he saying to Jesus he wasn't telling Jesus I'm the guy that's got the power he said I recognize your power and when the church recognizes his power God will do for us what we ask amen praise God Amen he was telling Jesus I recognize you to be God In the Flesh and that's right I recognize that every disease every sin is in your power hallelujah it's under your jurisdiction you can speak it that's all you have to do and every devil will mind you amen praise God Amen speak the word Lord my servant will be healed my servant he'll live that Roman Centurion knowed he was a man under Authority and he know that whatever came underneath him whatever he said they had to do it he said I say this to this man come he comes say to that man go he does it I say to this man and he says I'm a man of authority and everything under my authority obeys me and Lord I'm not worthy that you come in my house just speak the word so we see there in our story tonight in the history we see that that Centurion disrespected the voice of God for his hour because he believed the ship's owner over the Vindicated voice voice of the Prophet what are we doing we take our own opinions we take brother so and so's opinion with everything else when we've got a Vindicated voice amen let's go here to acts 10 let's take a look at this one this is another Gentile in Acts 10 verse one it says and there was a certain man in cesaria called Cornelius a centurion of the band called The Italian band and he was devout and he feared God with all of his house amen Gentile he feared God who do you fear I hope so he feared God and he gave much alms to the people and he prayed to God always and he saw a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming into him and saying unto him Cornelius amen what a man not he brother benam says even a gentile not even a Jew he was a gentile a centurion over a century a 100 men but he was a God-fearing man God has always God has always among the gentile people found God-fearing men and here is a centurion the house of Cornelius look how God so arranged it God arranged it look at how God has arranged everything in your life every step that you take God has arranged it every trial God has arranged it everything that every Everything God's arranged it and we fail to see that we fail to see that when the things go wrong in life and the Storm and The Tempest is blowing around us we give up on God we give up on a prophet we give up on these things we rush on our arm I'm G to strike in this ship I'm GNA put this thing over here this no I'm not going to wreck I'm in fact I'm going to get in this other light boat here and I'm going to try to swim to shore before the storm kills me out here Paul said don't do that stay in the ship amen stay in the message amen he prayed always he gave arms to the people you never do nothing worthwhile this is even to the unbeliever you never do nothing worthwhile but what God puts it to your record even to the unbeliever that's right Catholics get healed Pentecost you know Methodist get healed God answers prayer amen you don't do anything worthwhile but God will put it to your record he prayed he gave arms to the people he was a great man and one day while he was in prayer in the house there came an angel into the room where he was at you believe in angels the angel come into the room where he's at and he said Cornelius raise up and go down to japa and ask for one named Peter who dwells in the house of one called Simon and he'll tell what to do amen that's the only kind of voice I want to hear I'm just looking for that day when God says hey Bruce get up get in your car I want you to drive around over here and you'll find somebody and then go over here and then there'll be somebody over there and and then I'll tell you what to do when you get there don't think no thought about it because I already told you in my word take no thought about what you should say when you brought it before magistrates and kings and and up potentates he says because in that hour I will put my word in your mouth but to us it's it's a poly parrot thing it's a scripture we've memorized but we don't we fail to live it Paul when he stood up there in the midst of the storm brother B he come on the ship in the storm he's soak and wet and he's hungry and he says be of good cheer be of Courage we're going to Rome we're going to a Rapture oh brother if you only knew how bad it was if you could only see what's going on it all I'm going to tell you about this over here and people are so upset they're so the wind is blowing Every Which Way amen amen praise the Lord let's go back to acts 27 think I got a yes so verse 11 says nevertheless the Centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul and because the Haven was not commodious to Winter in the more part it the more part advised to depart then also if by any means they might obtain to fenus and there to Winter which was an Haven in cre and which lith towards the southwest and the Northwest they were still trusting in their own own ability when Paul had already told him guys I'm going to tell you right now stay here don't leave and they listened to their arm of Flesh and they left anyways and the Bible says and when the south wind blew softly they said see you see we don't have to follow everything or Prophet said feel that nice breeze things are going to be good friends we're going to get a new Administration in and things are going to be good a soft Breeze this everything's everything's going to be fine it's going to be fine supposing that they had obtained their purpose yeah loosing V they sailed close by Creed 1 Thessalonians 5 verse one says but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write to you about you know which Centurion are you going to be which Gentile are you going to be for ye yourselves no per perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night yeah you yourselves know that you know he's not going to tell you I took that quote Oh yeah I got it here I I got it I yeah well I'll read it people live today as though just before the coming of the Lord Jesus like he's going to send down a host of angels down on all the newspapers and for a year or so announce it throughout all the world in a newspaper say such a such date Jesus is going to arrive and I'm going to have it broadcast by the radio and put on the televisions and everything and it'll be on our phones just the day and just the hour that he's coming and that's how people live today but God has said in his word it would be like a thief in the night for ye yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night but when they start to say peace and safety just just like acts 27 they said oh look look we yep we don't Paul come on look the weather's good we're going on in the crate it was the storm was so bad it discouraged Paul brother Brenham said so Paul got discouraged they all thought they were going to die people today they they they think everything is going so bad and everything else and the first thing they forget to do is pray that's the first thing they forget they think go they sit down and they oh I got to call my financial adviser I got to talk to somebody I I'll call my dad I got to do this do that next thing God doesn't say why do you go and and put money and bags that got holes in them he says why do you go he says you know he told that one that one king it was a good king and the King was dying and he sent down to baale he sent down to baale to get an answer in the him and said is there not a God here is there not a God here tonight is there not a don't you believe that there was an angel that came and spoke to brother Brenham don't you believe that amen stay in the boat for when they shall say peace and safety a southerly wind good everything's going better now oh I'm so happy oh a lot less turmoil life is so much better then sudden destruction will come upon them as a travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape we are not going to escape what's coming you have a choice you can be the Centurion that trusts in the arm of Flesh and and all the data that you can gather together or you can be the guy that said Lord you're you're not even worthy to hear my prayer but I'm I'm crying out please do something for me right but you Brethren you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief praise the Lord Ephesians 4:14 says this that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive you brothers and sisters stay in the boat well I mean if you want to leave you can go ahead if you don't want to listen to what God has said he like brother John says he said not not going to force himself on you but I'll tell you this if you're elect by time he gets done whipping you you'll say yes Lord I'll do whatever you ask because it's better to it's better to obey than it is to just you know kick against the Pricks Paul found that out you know Paul said Paul said what what is going on here and he says it's hard to kick against the Pricks isn't it Paul then Paul said wait a minute I I'm not kicking against the the I'm not I'm not doing that I'm just trying to I'm trying to do the work of the Lord he says you're kicking against the pricks I I got it figured out no you're kicking against the Pricks it'd be better if you would just yield to me and just to show you that you're spiritually blind I'm going to make you physically blind see and he was wasn't he he was blind he was when that scripture about balum it says and the Mad Prophet because he was so sure that God had send him down there to curse the children of Israel it was all one he says I'm going to get a good retirement and a good PL and have a big church and everything this is going to be great he said that mad prophet he says and that donkey looked at him and said are you out of your mind I sometimes wonder what I mean I can count up the years I mean so Donna is testifying about us being married 48 years and I'm just thinking wow in 76 when we came in we got saved we thought wow we thought the world was coming to an end in 1980 wow we thought the world was coming to an end in 200000 wow we thought it we thought it was going to coming in in 2001 when when the World Trade Center come down and we went wow and everything else and now we're at 24 and we're still in the storm and the storm is still blowing everywhere and Jesus is just saying peace be still put your trust in me put your faith in me like Paul the boat it's going everywhere and Paul he's going I you know I can't even take it anymore all these people they stand against me they don't believe anything that I say he went down and he prayed and God came and answered his prayer amen except except you abide in the ship amen let's all stand together let's bow our heads dear Lord we have all been that unbelieving Centurion at some point in our life we don't mean to be that Lord sometimes we're just flesh sometimes we just get frustrated sometimes we don't know where to turn but I pray father that you'll cleanse us of our unbelief you'll cleanse us you'll cleanse us father you'll forgive us and that you'll bring us into that safe harbor harbor Lord bring us into that place close by you when Jesus stood and he looked at Jerusalem and he wept he says oh how I would have I would have held on to you I would have protected you and everything else but you would not and now your day has come our day is coming let us be pliable in your hands Lord forgive us of our sins help us help us heavenly father to just put our trust trust and hope and everything into your hands because Lord You're the one we've received a prophet and we expect a prophet's reward Heavenly Father help us to stay in the ship forgive us but may you just move by your spirit bless your word Lord this simple thought may it trouble us may it trouble Us in the night in the day what kind of a centurion am I help us father in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
