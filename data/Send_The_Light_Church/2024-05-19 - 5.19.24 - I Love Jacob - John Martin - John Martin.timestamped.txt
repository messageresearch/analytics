[37:36] are no matter what you're going to you
[37:39] got to remember who you are
[37:42] amen we were reminded Wednesday that
[37:44] this jacob guy he was a deceiver and a
[37:50] liar and and he really and he and he
[37:53] really was but honestly God loved this
[37:55] man Jacob amen I want to title this this
[37:58] morning I love Jacob
[38:01] amen I want us to remember that no
[38:03] matter how bad things get in our lives
[38:05] at
[38:07] times no matter what's going on there's
[38:09] something that will always attract the
[38:12] love of
[38:15] God even to an unconverted
[38:20] Soul amen and that is the willingness to
[38:23] do whatever is needed to get a complete
[38:26] nature change and that's why brother
[38:28] Bram said that mission work was always
[38:29] in the will of God that's why there's no
[38:32] other place in the Bible where it states
[38:36] that all the Angels Rejoice over one
[38:38] sinner that comes to repentance because
[38:41] it is the beginning of a nature change
[38:47] amen now Jacob had a brother and his
[38:51] name was Esau and they were twin
[38:53] boys they had Godly Parents Isaac and
[38:58] Rebecca and their grandfather and
[39:01] grandmother were also
[39:03] Godly their grandfather was the father
[39:06] of their faith and the father of our
[39:07] faith that was Abraham
[39:09] amen Abraham had two sons one by faith
[39:14] and the other by the flesh The Works of
[39:17] the
[39:18] Flesh and I want us to back up and just
[39:21] get a little background here in Romans
[39:23] chapter 9 verse 6
[39:28] the Bible says not as though the word of
[39:31] God had taken none
[39:34] effect the word doesn't affect everybody
[39:36] the same right the same word preached to
[39:41] 10 different people can affect them
[39:43] differently
[39:45] that's
[39:46] so it's just Jesus told us about having
[39:49] four different heart conditions in which
[39:53] if if our heart is a little bit Stony
[39:56] you know we're the the word is not going
[39:58] to be able to Avail in our life if it's
[40:01] mixed with thorns and the things of the
[40:03] world the cares of this life thing being
[40:06] bothered about things the word of God's
[40:08] not going to grow in our life if we just
[40:11] happen to be here because it's Sunday
[40:13] and it's time for church we we're coming
[40:15] to church without a purpose well the
[40:17] word of God is not going to help us it's
[40:19] not going to take the effect we've got
[40:20] to have what's called good ground amen I
[40:23] trust this morning that we all have good
[40:26] ground this morning amen
[40:28] he says for there for they are not all
[40:31] Israel which are
[40:34] Israel so there's an Israel of the flesh
[40:37] it's the natural Seed of Abraham and
[40:39] it's it's by their their natural DNA you
[40:43] can know who they are Ishmael was the
[40:45] first
[40:47] one and there's a Israel of the spirit
[40:51] of God which is the spiritual Seed of
[40:54] Abraham amen and by the spiritual DNA
[40:58] which is the faith of Abraham you can
[41:01] know them right amen is that is that
[41:04] simple one is of faith and one is as of
[41:07] the flesh amen verse seven neither
[41:10] because they are the Seed of Abraham
[41:13] other words the natural Seed of Abraham
[41:15] are they all the children are they all
[41:19] children but in Isaac shall they thy
[41:22] seed be called so here in this verse
[41:24] we're seeing that even though they came
[41:26] forth from Abra it doesn't mean they're
[41:28] the the the the CH a CH a child of God
[41:32] that's right a child of the promise
[41:35] ishmail was born by the will of the
[41:38] flesh Isaac was born by the will of
[41:41] God both sons of Abraham one the natural
[41:45] of the flesh came forth by the efforts
[41:47] of the flesh the other uh the seed of
[41:50] God came forth by faith in what the will
[41:54] of God not just Faith but faith in the
[41:57] will of
[41:59] God it has to be the will of
[42:03] God verse eight that in that is that
[42:08] they they which are the children of the
[42:11] flesh these are not the children of God
[42:16] it's a strong statement for
[42:18] ishmail but the children of the promise
[42:20] are counted for seed for the seed for
[42:23] This Is The Word of Promise at this time
[42:26] will I come and Sarah shall have a son
[42:28] now that was the will of God and he
[42:30] spoke it and Abraham believed it amen
[42:33] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[42:36] had conceived by one even by Our Father
[42:41] Isaac for the children being not yet
[42:43] born neither having done good and evil
[42:46] that the purpose of God according to
[42:47] election might stand not of works but of
[42:51] him that calleth it was said of her that
[42:53] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[42:56] is written Jacob have I loved and Esau
[43:01] have I
[43:02] hated such a contrast when we think of
[43:06] God we don't think of of him as someone
[43:08] that
[43:09] hates because God we we've heard more
[43:11] than ever that God loves everybody amen
[43:15] but here in the scriptures we find out
[43:17] that God hated Esau there was a reason
[43:20] for
[43:21] it and this deceiving boy this boy boy
[43:27] that went to
[43:29] extremes to trick his I can't imagine
[43:33] going to such extremes that's good to
[43:36] deceive my
[43:38] father but there was something about
[43:41] this boy that God
[43:44] loved now they were they were twins Esau
[43:48] uh was actually born first amen and then
[43:54] uh Jacob came out now with
[43:58] when Esau's last foot came
[44:02] out Jacob was was holding onto the
[44:06] heel and it was a
[44:11] sign it it was a
[44:14] sign now because Esau was born
[44:19] first it meant that he would get the
[44:22] inheritance of his father
[44:24] Jacob now what that really meant is he
[44:27] would get a greater inheritance than
[44:30] Jacob would get the first born was
[44:33] entitled to a double portion of his
[44:35] father's
[44:37] inheritance the firstborn was given
[44:39] power and authority over the family when
[44:42] he was
[44:44] gone he would take on the priesthood of
[44:46] the family and take care of Family
[44:48] Matters it was a great honor to be a the
[44:51] firstborn and to take on the family name
[44:54] it brought also a greater resp respect
[44:58] right to uh to to them so this is what
[45:03] Esau was already predestinated to get
[45:08] right I mean his father loved
[45:11] him yes it was sure as anything you're
[45:14] the firstborn you're getting it it was
[45:17] the Talk of the Town it was the talk of
[45:19] the
[45:20] family it wasn't like uh uh um Isaac
[45:25] didn't uh like Esau but he loved
[45:30] him and they must have talked about uh
[45:34] what you would be getting inherited when
[45:37] I was gone because he was getting
[45:39] older amen but when Jacob was
[45:45] born he came out
[45:49] second you heard Wednesday that he was
[45:51] he kind of an awful
[45:53] man an outright liar a Deceiver amen if
[45:57] you look it up it means a
[46:00] schemer a trickster a
[46:03] swindler but there was something about
[46:05] Jacob that God
[46:07] loved he was a
[46:10] supplanter that means in one place that
[46:13] he took by the
[46:15] heel he took by the heel that's what he
[46:18] was and that's what happened when he was
[46:20] born he took by the heel but what it
[46:23] meant spiritually now Jacob was able to
[46:27] restrict or restrain Esau from getting
[46:30] the
[46:32] birthright Jacob circumvent circumvented
[46:36] Esau he sees the
[46:39] birthright Jacob found a way around the
[46:42] problem to overcome and and take care of
[46:47] the first birth
[46:49] problem amen I hope you're with
[46:54] me I believe this is why God God said I
[46:57] love
[46:59] Jacob Jacob was willing to go to the
[47:03] extremest ends to get the
[47:07] birthright to get the rights of being
[47:09] born again to get the inheritance the
[47:13] double portion the power the authority
[47:15] to get the name to get the blessings of
[47:18] God Jacob was willing to do whatever he
[47:20] needed to do to get it right amen Jacob
[47:24] have I loved but ES saw I hate
[47:29] it Jacob was already in the position to
[47:32] receive the
[47:34] inheritance might say that he testified
[47:37] I'm
[47:38] predestinated to get
[47:42] it because he was right in order he was
[47:46] told by his father that he
[47:50] was being born
[47:53] properly yet God allowed the birthright
[47:57] to be stolen from
[48:00] him why did God actually hate
[48:06] Esau Esau loved his flesh more than he
[48:10] loved the benefits of his father's
[48:16] inheritance Esau despised the benefits
[48:19] that come from being the firstborn just
[48:23] like a lot of Believers today I believe
[48:25] despise the benef benefits that come
[48:27] along with being born
[48:29] again turn with me if you would to
[48:32] Genesis
[48:33] 2527 as we go through this the Bible
[48:37] says in Genesis
[48:38] 25:27 and the boys grew and Esau was a
[48:42] cunning Hunter a man of the field and
[48:44] Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
[48:48] we might say that you know we know that
[48:50] Esau was kind of hairy not kind of but
[48:53] greatly hairy and a hunter you know we
[48:56] might say he was a real
[48:59] He-Man he would be say there's a real
[49:01] man
[49:03] there and Jacob he didn't have much hair
[49:07] on him he was a plain man might say he
[49:10] was more of a Mama's
[49:13] Boy and Isaac loved
[49:17] Esau now look at the reason because he
[49:20] did eat of his venison in other words
[49:23] his father loved him for natural reasons
[49:27] but Rebecca loved
[49:30] Jacob I believe that his mother could
[49:33] see the motive yes that Jacob
[49:38] had and I think it's real important our
[49:40] motives
[49:41] today amen and Jacob S or cooked up some
[49:45] pottage and Esau came from the field and
[49:48] he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed
[49:51] me I pray thee that with that same red
[49:54] potage for I am faint
[49:57] therefore was his name called Edom and
[50:00] Jacob said sell me this day thy
[50:04] Birthright in other words you want me to
[50:06] feed you let's make a deal amen and Esau
[50:10] said behold I am at the point to die
[50:15] what does it matter if I go to
[50:16] church what does it matter if I read the
[50:19] word listen to the tapes what does it
[50:21] matter if I try anymore
[50:24] right hold I'm at the point to die and
[50:27] what profit shall this Birthright do to
[50:30] me that's right I say here in is the too
[50:34] many Believers have the same attitude
[50:36] that Esau had or Esau did amen they
[50:40] don't want to die out to their own will
[50:44] right I'm I'm I'm I'm about to to die
[50:47] out and I can't take this anymore I just
[50:49] got to do my own
[50:52] will what profit shall this Birthright
[50:54] do to me right now
[50:58] how is this Birthright going to help my
[51:02] business my
[51:04] marriage my
[51:06] livelihood my life my
[51:11] dreams I only have so much time to live
[51:15] brother John I got to get everything I
[51:18] can get out of this life
[51:21] amen and Jacob verse 33 said swear to me
[51:26] this day and he swear unto him and he
[51:29] sold his Birthright unto
[51:33] Jacob he took the mark of the
[51:37] beast then Jacob gave Esau bread potage
[51:42] of lenos and he did eat and drink and
[51:45] Rose up and went his way and Esau
[51:48] despised his Birthright
[51:53] amen Esau dis esteemed his
[51:57] Birthright because to him it had no
[52:01] value right he didn't value it he valued
[52:06] what was the pain that he was suffering
[52:09] with right now more important than a
[52:11] nature
[52:18] change that word despise it means to
[52:21] regard with content to distaste to
[52:24] disgust to disdain scorn or
[52:28] Loaf in other words this new birth was a
[52:33] back burner this inheritance was a back
[52:35] burner for him maybe sometime down the
[52:38] road but right now I've got other things
[52:41] on my
[52:42] mind Esau despised his
[52:46] Birthright now how can we despise our
[52:49] Birthright today how can we despise the
[52:53] new birth or being born again with a new
[52:55] nature how can can
[52:59] we know too many people think that
[53:03] they're born again when they repent they
[53:06] get
[53:08] baptized the Holy Ghost comes upon them
[53:10] they speak in tongues and they think
[53:12] they're born again brother brandham said
[53:15] quoting he said that is only the
[53:20] beginning that is only the begin in
[53:22] other words there's a midle and there is
[53:24] an end to the new birth
[53:27] praise God the new birth is not just a
[53:30] one minute
[53:32] decision it's where our nature is
[53:34] constantly changing to be more like
[53:38] his amen now I think that that all make
[53:41] the Christian the more the most happiest
[53:43] and excited person on the planet right
[53:46] there it's the process of God's life the
[53:49] Holy Spirit coming and setting up his
[53:51] kingdom inside of
[53:54] us in Luke 17 verse
[53:58] 20 and when he was demanded by the
[54:01] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[54:04] come he answered them and said the
[54:06] kingdom of God cometh not with
[54:09] observation in other words you're not
[54:11] going to see
[54:13] it neither shall you say Lo
[54:17] here or or low
[54:20] there amen behold the kingdom of God is
[54:25] inside of you yes amen it's
[54:29] inside it's within
[54:33] us now how could God's Great massive
[54:37] Kingdom all fit inside of each one of
[54:43] us he's
[54:47] Mighty he created this whole world that
[54:49] we know the all the galaxies and the
[54:52] planets and
[54:54] everything that we see was made by
[54:56] something he
[54:58] created and yet he's so powerful that he
[55:02] can dwell in the heart of a
[55:05] man that's the god that we
[55:10] serve it's the Holy Spirit which is I'll
[55:13] say it like this the Living Word of God
[55:16] you've got the written word that doesn't
[55:18] live it and then you've got the Living
[55:20] Word that lives it
[55:27] I think it's so misunderstood in
[55:32] churches but the New Birth really is but
[55:36] I'll say the kingdom of God is being
[55:38] ministered to us every time we come to
[55:41] church Peter said in second Tim second
[55:45] Peter
[55:51] 1:1 that we
[55:53] need to to be serious about making sure
[55:57] that we got all the kingdom that we're
[55:59] supposed to
[56:00] have for so in entrance shall be
[56:03] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[56:08] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and our
[56:11] Savior Jesus Christ see in entrance is
[56:14] being ministered so as the word comes
[56:16] forth it's speaking to us what we need
[56:20] to do to allow God to come more into our
[56:22] heart see it has to go through free more
[56:24] agency
[56:26] that's what the ministry of the word's
[56:28] for wherefore I will not be negligent to
[56:33] put you always in remembrance of these
[56:35] things though you already know them and
[56:39] be established in the present truth we
[56:41] still have to be reminded amen amen how
[56:45] can we despise our right to be born
[56:49] again and and and despise the right of
[56:54] the new birth which God has promised
[56:56] every
[56:57] believer it's real simple by
[57:00] despising part of the word amen I just
[57:05] want to make it real simple for us how
[57:07] we despise our Birthright is by
[57:09] despising just part of this word it's
[57:13] it's so
[57:15] simple no one despises the blessings of
[57:19] God no one does nobody despises the
[57:22] promises of God we want them
[57:26] right but we despise
[57:28] correction that's right exhortation
[57:30] direction for our our our lives
[57:33] spiritually and this is how we can
[57:35] despise the new birth or our nature to
[57:39] be completely changed turn with me if
[57:40] you would to Hebrews chapter 12 and I
[57:43] want to read quite a few verses in here
[57:46] but you see we all feel that we're like
[57:52] Jacob and we're not like Esau in this
[57:55] the scenario
[57:58] but I'm telling you we The
[58:02] Inheritance understand that God had an
[58:07] inheritance for the children of Israel
[58:11] when they came out of Egypt amen and
[58:13] that was to go into the promised land
[58:16] now they received the blessings they
[58:19] went out they went on the other side of
[58:21] the uh of uh the river and they rejoiced
[58:25] and they were excited about being freed
[58:28] from the devil they could say that I'm
[58:30] I've been out I'm C out of the world and
[58:33] so they were in this place being out of
[58:36] the world but not yet into the Holy
[58:38] Ghost not into the promised
[58:40] land and in this place where you don't
[58:43] got enough Holy Ghost you're always
[58:46] murmuring and complaining and bothered
[58:48] about this and bothered about and God
[58:49] you should be doing this and it just
[58:51] been better if you would have never
[58:52] called
[58:54] me come on true I I I I hope there's
[58:57] somebody spiritual this morning in this
[58:59] church because it's the word of God and
[59:02] you know what when they came up to the
[59:04] promised land they
[59:06] despised what God had promised
[59:12] them a lot of people they're willing to
[59:14] go to church willing to get entertained
[59:18] they'll go as far as paying their
[59:20] TI
[59:22] amen but they're not willing to get a
[59:24] nature change
[59:27] that is how we can
[59:29] despise our
[59:31] Birthright Hebrews 12:5 says and ye have
[59:34] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[59:36] unto you as unto children my son despise
[59:40] not the chastening of the
[59:43] Lorden nor faint when thou art rebuked
[59:48] hey that's if there's any father that
[59:50] will not chasen his children nor rebuke
[59:54] his children I would say that that
[59:56] father is missing
[59:58] something and to ever have a God that
[1:00:01] you you just re you just dislike when he
[1:00:05] rebukes you something's wrong with your
[1:00:06] relationship with him amen right for
[1:00:10] whom the Lord loveth he
[1:00:13] chasteneth and scores every son whom he
[1:00:21] receiveth if you endure chastening God
[1:00:24] deal with you as son for what son is he
[1:00:27] to whom the father
[1:00:29] chasethe be without
[1:00:32] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:00:34] of it right but if you if you're without
[1:00:39] it you don't want nothing to do with it
[1:00:41] then you're you're bastards and you're
[1:00:44] not really children of
[1:00:46] God furthermore we've had fathers of our
[1:00:49] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:00:52] them reverence shall we not much rather
[1:00:56] be subject unto the father of spirits
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:00] live amen for they verily for a few days
[1:01:04] chasing us for their own pleasure by the
[1:01:09] way I'm glad I'm glad it's being honest
[1:01:11] you know you can get so mad at your kids
[1:01:14] that's true you get so mad at your kids
[1:01:16] that you'll correct them for the purpose
[1:01:18] because you're mad at
[1:01:20] them that's for your own pleasure that's
[1:01:23] right but that is not the way God never
[1:01:25] cracks like that he has something
[1:01:28] greater in mind and it's our own
[1:01:30] interests it's the our character our
[1:01:34] soul he says shall we not okay okay but
[1:01:39] uh I'm sorry for very few days chase us
[1:01:41] after their own pleasure but he for our
[1:01:46] profit that we might be partakers of his
[1:01:51] Holiness God wants us to be more like
[1:01:54] him that's why he corrects us
[1:01:56] now no chastening for the present seem
[1:01:58] to be joyous but it's Grievous
[1:02:01] nevertheless afterwards it yield of the
[1:02:04] Peaceable fruits of righteousness unto
[1:02:06] them which are exercised thereby and
[1:02:08] this is what I
[1:02:10] say the word's going to come forth at
[1:02:13] this Pulpit whether you're here or not
[1:02:17] here the word is going to be preach the
[1:02:20] same whether you love God or don't love
[1:02:24] him amen whether you long for
[1:02:27] chastisement or you just I'll never take
[1:02:31] it nobody's going to tell me what to
[1:02:35] do God will remain the same it's up to
[1:02:39] us to be identified with what Spirit we
[1:02:42] are of
[1:02:45] am I think it's one of the most silliest
[1:02:47] things for us to
[1:02:49] act or to talk like we're a child of God
[1:02:54] and act like like we are
[1:02:57] not come
[1:02:59] on let the word be
[1:03:02] word every seed shall bring forth of its
[1:03:05] kind it's a I think it's about time for
[1:03:07] us to get more serious with the word of
[1:03:12] God we've got to exercise we've got to
[1:03:15] be exercised in this if God speaks we
[1:03:18] need to be more than hearers of the word
[1:03:19] but doers and if we become a doer of it
[1:03:23] then we're going to be more like Christ
[1:03:25] when it's all
[1:03:26] done so he concludes here wherefore lift
[1:03:30] up the hands which hang
[1:03:32] down and the feeble
[1:03:35] knees and make straight paths for your
[1:03:39] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[1:03:42] out of the way but let it be rather
[1:03:45] healed follow peace with all
[1:03:50] men does your bible say that
[1:03:54] right right follow peace with all men
[1:03:58] even my
[1:04:01] enemies I this is not my
[1:04:05] opinion we're not here to hear Brother
[1:04:08] John's
[1:04:09] opinion this is why I like
[1:04:11] scriptures they put us all on the right
[1:04:14] page amen amen follow peace with all men
[1:04:18] and Holiness without which no man shall
[1:04:20] see the
[1:04:21] Lord so we need this we need this
[1:04:24] correction to become more more holy or
[1:04:26] we won't see the Lord now look at this
[1:04:29] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:04:33] the grace of God lest a any root of
[1:04:37] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[1:04:42] thereby many be
[1:04:47] defiled many can be defiled by just one
[1:04:53] root of bitterness inside
[1:04:58] someone all right Sami colon verse 16
[1:05:01] lest there be any
[1:05:05] fornicator I'll just say spiritually
[1:05:07] right now or profane person as
[1:05:12] Esau who for one morsel of
[1:05:15] meat sold his
[1:05:20] Birthright
[1:05:22] amen one decision that we
[1:05:26] make can change your Eternal
[1:05:35] Destiny you look what Esau needed was to
[1:05:39] get more serious about his Birthright
[1:05:42] get more serious about his inheritance
[1:05:44] not just say well I'm the firstborn
[1:05:46] Daddy loves me too bad Jacob I'm sorry
[1:05:49] that ain't going to
[1:05:52] work there is a reason that God loved
[1:05:55] Jacob
[1:05:58] for ye know how that
[1:06:01] afterwards when he would have inherited
[1:06:03] the
[1:06:04] blessing he was
[1:06:07] rejected for he found no place of
[1:06:11] repentance look it though he sought it
[1:06:14] carefully with
[1:06:17] tears brother sister we can cross a
[1:06:21] line I'm not being judgmental but look
[1:06:27] we're running out of time to get serious
[1:06:29] with
[1:06:30] God I think this is the
[1:06:33] hour we need to be
[1:06:35] seeking that nature
[1:06:37] change that means getting serious with
[1:06:40] God because he's the only one that can
[1:06:42] give it coming to church don't give you
[1:06:44] a nature
[1:06:45] change you've got to believe the word as
[1:06:48] it comes forth youve got to apply it to
[1:06:50] your life the B the Bible says uh um um
[1:06:54] they it did the word did not profit them
[1:06:56] not being mixed with faith everybody's
[1:06:58] got faith that the word is
[1:07:00] true but who's got faith that the word
[1:07:02] is for
[1:07:03] you there's the difference it's got to
[1:07:07] be personally for
[1:07:08] you all right Joshua
[1:07:11] 24:2 Joshua is gathering all the tribes
[1:07:14] of Israel to shikim and Joshua said unto
[1:07:18] the people thus sayith the Lord God of
[1:07:21] Israel your fathers dwelt on the other
[1:07:24] side of the flood in old time even
[1:07:27] Tara and uh the father of Abraham and
[1:07:30] the father of Nicole and they served
[1:07:33] other
[1:07:34] gods in other words Abraham came out
[1:07:38] from the world he didn't have Godly
[1:07:40] Parents and I took your father Abraham
[1:07:44] from the other side of the flood and led
[1:07:47] him through all the land of Canaan and
[1:07:48] multiplied his seed and gave him
[1:07:52] Isaac and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and
[1:07:56] Esau and notice here I gave unto Esau
[1:08:00] Mount seir to possess it but Jacob and
[1:08:05] his children went down into
[1:08:09] Egypt
[1:08:11] oh did I read that
[1:08:14] right
[1:08:16] okay I thought I thought maybe I I I
[1:08:18] read that wrong but Jacob and his
[1:08:20] children went down into Egypt and I sent
[1:08:22] Moses also and Aaron and I plagued Egypt
[1:08:26] according to all that which I did among
[1:08:28] them after as I brought them out so
[1:08:30] notice He blesses Esau with Mount
[1:08:35] seir to possess it and then it takes
[1:08:40] Jacob and he sends them to Egypt where
[1:08:43] they's
[1:08:47] plagued now Esau despised his Birthright
[1:08:50] yet God blessed
[1:08:51] him amen naturally
[1:08:56] Jacob loved the
[1:08:57] birthright he loved the right to be born
[1:09:01] the proper
[1:09:04] way because that's the only way you can
[1:09:06] get the blessings of God is to be born
[1:09:09] the proper way yet he sends them down
[1:09:11] into Egypt and there he's
[1:09:14] plagued but look what happened to Esau
[1:09:16] in Malachi chap 1:2 Malachi 1: 2 I have
[1:09:21] loved you sayeth the Lord yet ye say
[1:09:24] where in H has thou loved us was not
[1:09:28] Esau Jacob's brother sayeth the Lord yet
[1:09:31] I love Jacob sir verse three and I hated
[1:09:35] Esau and laid his mountains and his
[1:09:40] Heritage waste for the dragons of the
[1:09:45] Wilderness
[1:09:48] amen why would you want to mess with a
[1:09:52] pot some something down here
[1:09:55] and
[1:09:56] miss all the spiritual things that God
[1:09:59] has for
[1:10:01] you look if all if if all you had to do
[1:10:05] was come to church and say Amen to the
[1:10:07] word and you would become more like
[1:10:10] Christ and I would be preaching that
[1:10:13] message but what we
[1:10:15] need is to get serious with the word
[1:10:18] that's being
[1:10:21] preached Jacob have I loved but Esau
[1:10:25] have I
[1:10:27] hated Esau have I hated despised his
[1:10:31] Birthright despised his inheritance and
[1:10:34] it became a
[1:10:38] waste too many Christians are not
[1:10:42] willing to die out to get into the
[1:10:45] promised
[1:10:46] land now I'll say it like
[1:10:51] this we're not trying to enter a kingdom
[1:10:56] we're trying to get the kingdom to enter
[1:11:00] us and the only way it's going to enter
[1:11:02] us is if we die out to the kingdom that
[1:11:05] we're in amen we're all born in sin
[1:11:09] shapen in
[1:11:10] iniquity and we got this nature that
[1:11:14] have you ever looked in the mirror and
[1:11:15] literally hated I don't necessarily mean
[1:11:18] a real mirror but when you start taking
[1:11:20] a look at the way that you act your
[1:11:23] behavior the things the decision you
[1:11:25] make do you ever look at yourself and
[1:11:27] you say you are just
[1:11:31] terrible okay so these are called
[1:11:35] Giants a giant ugly nature that you
[1:11:39] don't want inside of you
[1:11:42] amen and we
[1:11:44] want to get the Giants
[1:11:47] out so we can possess the land so the
[1:11:51] Holy Ghost can have his way with love
[1:11:55] joy peace
[1:11:57] longsuffering that's our inheritance
[1:12:00] amen this is what God has forced on this
[1:12:03] side it's not just about on the other
[1:12:06] side look why are we worried about the
[1:12:09] other side if we're not willing to get
[1:12:10] what we need on this side to get to the
[1:12:11] other
[1:12:14] side praise the
[1:12:16] Lord
[1:12:18] Jacob was loved by
[1:12:23] God God loved Jacob because he wanted
[1:12:26] the
[1:12:29] birthright I don't care if you
[1:12:31] feel like you're a bad
[1:12:35] person Jacob
[1:12:37] did I don't care if you feel unworthy I
[1:12:40] don't care if you've deceived
[1:12:42] somebody I don't care if you feel like
[1:12:44] an
[1:12:46] outcast like you're walking in the flesh
[1:12:49] sometimes when you turn your heart to
[1:12:52] wanting the new nature change inside of
[1:12:55] you God will pour out his love upon
[1:12:59] you but you've got to turn your heart
[1:13:02] towards the nature change nothing else
[1:13:05] Works nothing else
[1:13:08] Works what good would it be to read the
[1:13:11] Bible if you're not interested
[1:13:14] in becoming the
[1:13:18] Bible right you might as well go read
[1:13:20] some other heal health help self-help
[1:13:23] book
[1:13:26] right if you want to know how to put
[1:13:27] Small Engines together you can get a
[1:13:29] book on small
[1:13:31] engines you could get uh small engines
[1:13:35] for
[1:13:37] dummies and then you can know better
[1:13:41] I'll say we read the Bible so we can
[1:13:43] become more like Christ
[1:13:45] amen I'll say it like this it's all our
[1:13:48] motive what's our motive what's our
[1:13:52] motive are we putting everything that we
[1:13:55] could be putting into becoming changed
[1:13:59] or are we satisfied with where we're at
[1:14:01] with
[1:14:03] God yes in the message impersonation of
[1:14:07] Christianity brother Bon says but Jacob
[1:14:10] have re recompense that that uh
[1:14:13] Birthright and regardless of what anyone
[1:14:16] called him if I could say it you excuse
[1:14:19] the expression you could call him a Holy
[1:14:22] Roller fanatic or whatever they wish to
[1:14:24] but he had respect to that
[1:14:27] Birthright and this is what he said
[1:14:31] that was his whole
[1:14:34] motive his whole motive isn't that what
[1:14:37] Jesus said that we need to do forsake
[1:14:40] everything and to put him
[1:14:43] first amen and I to really put God first
[1:14:47] is not to to walk around with the flag
[1:14:50] and say yes I'm in the message I belong
[1:14:52] to Jesus I go to church I'm a Christian
[1:14:56] Christian what that really really
[1:14:59] means is Christ is living in me what
[1:15:04] will it produce living for others it's
[1:15:07] that simple you don't want to hurt
[1:15:09] anybody you want to help
[1:15:10] them in fact you want to help them to
[1:15:13] the degree brother Ben that you want to
[1:15:14] love your enemy love your enemy that's
[1:15:18] what Christ inside of a person will do
[1:15:22] sir that that's what is whole motive no
[1:15:26] matter what it cost him he wanted the
[1:15:29] birthright and when we want God that
[1:15:32] much that is what will bring God's pour
[1:15:35] out his love upon
[1:15:39] you Esau sought to save his life and he
[1:15:42] lost it right and that's what Jesus said
[1:15:45] if you seek to save your life you'll
[1:15:46] lose it right Jacob paid the price and
[1:15:49] God said I love
[1:15:51] Jacob not all Israel is Israel not
[1:15:56] all message
[1:15:59] Believers are the
[1:16:03] bride but the true bride in the message
[1:16:08] will manifest the word of God there's
[1:16:11] the
[1:16:12] difference and I don't think we should
[1:16:14] stop short until we see it manifested in
[1:16:16] our life amen
[1:16:18] amen uh brother Gideon sent me this
[1:16:20] quote this
[1:16:22] morning no that's a wrong statement
[1:16:26] my daughter sent me
[1:16:27] this this
[1:16:30] morning in the me in the message Christ
[1:16:32] is the mystery of God revealed but the
[1:16:35] only way that you can actually be a
[1:16:37] Christian is for Christ to identify
[1:16:40] himself in you yes right that that's
[1:16:44] strong he says he says we got a stinger
[1:16:46] there I hope everybody on the tape gets
[1:16:49] that too that's why I'm reading that the
[1:16:52] only way we can actually be a Christian
[1:16:55] is for Christ to identify himself in you
[1:17:01] yes so it's not us saying we're a
[1:17:03] Christian it's us living that
[1:17:06] life that humble Godly holy life learn
[1:17:11] of me for I'm Meek lowly in heart you
[1:17:15] shall find rest for your souls it's when
[1:17:19] Christ identifies himself in
[1:17:23] us are they're getting sent me this
[1:17:25] quote this morning in the eagle in her
[1:17:27] nest he said businessmen what about you
[1:17:31] one of these days you're going to leave
[1:17:33] your
[1:17:34] business no matter how prosperous you
[1:17:36] are you're going to leave that business
[1:17:40] every penny you've made will be
[1:17:42] scattered among your
[1:17:45] relatives and it'll be fussing and
[1:17:48] fighting and carrying
[1:17:50] on then how much treasure have you got
[1:17:53] up yonder in heaven
[1:17:56] what do you know about
[1:17:59] Christ do you just know him as a blesser
[1:18:03] that blesses your
[1:18:05] soul he said Remember the rainfalls on
[1:18:08] the just and the unjust
[1:18:10] alike but I mean do you know Christ he
[1:18:14] says amen oh you say I know the Bible
[1:18:17] pretty good he said to know the Bible is
[1:18:20] not
[1:18:21] life it's not about knowing anything
[1:18:25] just want to follow that up with this
[1:18:28] scripture here that I already had before
[1:18:31] brother Gideon sent that 2 Corinthians
[1:18:33] chapter 5:1 17 therefore If any man be
[1:18:38] in Christ he is a new
[1:18:43] creature new
[1:18:45] creature it doesn't he doesn't know
[1:18:48] everything he's just a new
[1:18:51] creature the old creature
[1:18:55] old things are passed away the only way
[1:18:57] the old things are going to be passed
[1:18:59] away is the Nature has to
[1:19:01] leave because if if if you don't get the
[1:19:04] nature out you can wash up that pig put
[1:19:06] perfume on him put a bow on
[1:19:09] him all clean he's never been in his
[1:19:12] life since the day he was
[1:19:14] born and he'll run right back out to the
[1:19:17] old nature
[1:19:19] things so old things are passed away
[1:19:22] behold all things are become new new and
[1:19:27] and all things are of God now who's
[1:19:31] there who's
[1:19:35] there okay you know what really
[1:19:40] matters
[1:19:41] is do you have the desire like Jacob had
[1:19:46] to get
[1:19:50] there because Jacob was willing to do
[1:19:53] whatever he needed needed to do to get
[1:19:56] there and I'll tell you I I can't make
[1:19:59] it without God and if I'm going to find
[1:20:02] favor with God I've got to want what God
[1:20:04] wants for
[1:20:07] me I say we need to keep pressing
[1:20:10] on we need to keep fighting the good
[1:20:12] fight of
[1:20:14] Faith press towards the Mark we need to
[1:20:16] go on to Perfection to have that love in
[1:20:19] our lives that we need to
[1:20:21] have I'll tell you when it's there Jesus
[1:20:23] said that's my identification when
[1:20:27] all when you have loved one for another
[1:20:30] amen then shall all
[1:20:32] men not just people in the church but
[1:20:35] all men shall know you're my disciples
[1:20:39] when you have love one for
[1:20:42] another all right Romans chapter 8 we're
[1:20:45] going to need to go through this kind of
[1:20:48] quickly are you getting something out of
[1:20:49] this all right praise the Lord Romans
[1:20:52] chapter 8 H do you believe God is
[1:20:53] leading the
[1:20:55] church you believe God's leading you
[1:20:58] amen Romans 8 ver14 for as many as are
[1:21:01] led by the spirit of God they are the
[1:21:03] sons of God that's right for we have not
[1:21:07] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:21:09] fear but we have received the spirit of
[1:21:10] adoption whereby we're crying ABA
[1:21:14] father so what's going on here what what
[1:21:17] what's happening the spirit itself is
[1:21:20] bearing witness with our spirit that we
[1:21:24] are not the children of the flesh but
[1:21:26] we're the children of
[1:21:28] God and if children then heirs Heirs of
[1:21:32] God join ears with Christ if so be that
[1:21:34] we suffer with
[1:21:35] him that we may be also glorified
[1:21:39] together now why is they sticking that
[1:21:40] in there if so be that we suffer with
[1:21:44] him that we may also be glorified
[1:21:47] together if we're going to break through
[1:21:50] this
[1:21:51] nature that we were born with in into
[1:21:54] the nature of Jesus Christ it will not
[1:21:57] happen without
[1:22:00] suffering the children of Israel when
[1:22:04] they came up to those giants they had to
[1:22:06] face their fears they had to walk they
[1:22:09] had to step over they had to say greater
[1:22:11] is he that's in me than this old nature
[1:22:14] that I was born with and they had to go
[1:22:16] after those
[1:22:18] Giants and if we're not willing to do
[1:22:21] that if we just don't want to deal with
[1:22:22] that part of our life
[1:22:25] you're really not manifesting yourself
[1:22:27] as a child of God that's right
[1:22:31] amen for I reckon Verse 18 for I reckon
[1:22:36] that the
[1:22:37] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:22:41] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:22:43] that shall be revealed in us so how can
[1:22:46] you
[1:22:48] compare how can you
[1:22:52] compare I just think about Esau all he
[1:22:55] had to do is take a
[1:22:57] second God wasn't going to let him
[1:23:00] die though I walk through the valley of
[1:23:02] shadow of death I shall fear no
[1:23:05] evil I I know sometimes it seems so hard
[1:23:08] that you really got to come to the Altar
[1:23:10] and get serious with God and repent and
[1:23:12] and reconsecrate yourself to God you
[1:23:15] just need to get serious with God Amen I
[1:23:18] I know it seems like it's it's like I I
[1:23:21] could I could do it without doing that
[1:23:25] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:23:26] present time are not worthy to be
[1:23:28] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:23:30] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:23:33] expectation
[1:23:35] of the creature is waiting for the
[1:23:39] manifestation of the sons of
[1:23:42] God now the spirit of the Holy Ghost is
[1:23:45] leading us to manifest Christ right
[1:23:49] amen there's a part we play and there's
[1:23:52] a part he plays
[1:23:55] if we play our part no matter how we're
[1:23:58] all
[1:24:00] Jacobs we're all Jacobs but we learned
[1:24:03] Wednesday we're all israels
[1:24:07] right the thing is don't despise what
[1:24:11] you need to do don't despise that nature
[1:24:14] change don't despise well I don't really
[1:24:17] need to do that God hasn't called me to
[1:24:20] that I don't feel that I don't feel led
[1:24:23] to do that
[1:24:24] brother sister you don't know what
[1:24:26] you're
[1:24:28] saying you've got to come under
[1:24:30] subjection to the word if you're a child
[1:24:31] of
[1:24:33] God take the word of God as your
[1:24:36] absolute your ideas or whatever you've
[1:24:38] been taught or that don't mean anything
[1:24:40] in the past you got to throw it all
[1:24:42] behind Saul had to throw it all behind
[1:24:45] we got to throw it all
[1:24:47] behind don't be satisfied with just
[1:24:50] claiming you're predestinated amen
[1:24:53] predestination will always lead you to
[1:24:56] the manifestation of the word we've got
[1:24:59] to fix our eyes on becoming the word
[1:25:01] Romans 8:29 says for whom he did for no
[1:25:05] he also predestinated to be conformed to
[1:25:07] the image there it is the image of his
[1:25:09] son that he might be the firstborn among
[1:25:15] us we're we're we're part of the many
[1:25:21] Brethren praise the Lord
[1:25:25] I'm predestinated somehow I'm going to
[1:25:27] be just like Jesus it does not yet
[1:25:31] appear but when he
[1:25:33] comes I know I'm going to be just like
[1:25:37] him for we shall see him as he is the
[1:25:40] Bible says in the Samaran Church age
[1:25:43] brother B says be careful here and see
[1:25:45] this be careful here and see this it is
[1:25:49] not the person that comes predestinated
[1:25:53] eternally from
[1:25:56] God he said it is the word or the seed
[1:26:01] now this is this was shocking when I
[1:26:04] read this to me it is not the person
[1:26:07] that comes to predestinated
[1:26:11] eternally from God it is the word or the
[1:26:14] seed in other words it's not well I'm
[1:26:16] just going to choose him I'm going to
[1:26:17] choose him and I predestinated them and
[1:26:19] I'm predestinated no what's really
[1:26:23] predestinated is is the
[1:26:25] word that is the
[1:26:27] seed and if you are the word then you're
[1:26:32] predestinated it's not you becoming the
[1:26:37] word the word's already in you
[1:26:40] right it's you yielding to what's
[1:26:43] already inside of
[1:26:45] you you dying out brother B says what we
[1:26:48] got to do is just lay out in the
[1:26:50] presence of the sun he says we're not
[1:26:52] willing to die out there lay in the Sun
[1:26:54] long enough to mature to
[1:26:59] ripen he said that is it way back there
[1:27:03] too far back for human and mind to grasp
[1:27:06] the Eternal god with eternal thoughts
[1:27:09] thought and and decreed Jacob have I
[1:27:12] loved and Esau have I hated and neither
[1:27:16] was born neither had done good and evil
[1:27:19] see it was the thought and then that
[1:27:22] thought became expressed and God brought
[1:27:25] back Jacob because Jacob alone was
[1:27:29] seed yes Jacob alone was seed and that's
[1:27:34] why he had respect to the birthright and
[1:27:37] to the Covenant of God if you are uh
[1:27:40] true seed you will hear the word and the
[1:27:43] spirit will baptize you into the body of
[1:27:45] Christ filling you and empowering you
[1:27:48] and you will receive the word for your
[1:27:50] day and your age amen he said see how
[1:27:54] clear the true evidence becomes when the
[1:27:57] word is revealed to you amen how
[1:28:01] beautiful in the message hear ye him
[1:28:04] brother B says notice now when a baby
[1:28:06] son was born into the family of his
[1:28:08] father he was born a son but yet he had
[1:28:11] no inheritance just as a son now there's
[1:28:14] where I think a lot of Full Gospel
[1:28:16] people let down a bit on our
[1:28:18] Doctrine see we can take a person and
[1:28:21] say well now he's filled with the Holy
[1:28:23] Ghost I think I might have quoted this
[1:28:25] when he speaks with tongues that he said
[1:28:28] that's
[1:28:30] it the person says well now he's filled
[1:28:33] with the Holy Ghost he speaks with
[1:28:34] tongues and that's it he said no he says
[1:28:38] you just only
[1:28:40] began you just been born into the family
[1:28:43] that's all that's the reason today our
[1:28:45] churches is not progressing the way that
[1:28:47] they should
[1:28:49] be I mean think about it how many times
[1:28:53] have you done something children
[1:28:55] husbands your wife's ask you to do
[1:28:57] something your mother asked you to do
[1:28:59] something they said I would like you to
[1:29:01] do
[1:29:03] this brother Marty can remember this
[1:29:06] when sister Kathleen would ask for
[1:29:08] something to be done maybe something in
[1:29:11] the
[1:29:12] garden and you did it and she said you
[1:29:15] have not completed
[1:29:18] it you don't clean your room by shoving
[1:29:21] all the toys under the bed
[1:29:24] see a lot of people well I I got this
[1:29:26] experience with God I spoke in tongues I
[1:29:29] danced I did all this and you know I'm
[1:29:33] in if you wake up tomorrow I'll say it
[1:29:36] like this today is the day of
[1:29:39] salvation we God is a living God he
[1:29:42] ain't a dead
[1:29:43] God we don't serve him I did this in the
[1:29:47] past no we we have new testimonies every
[1:29:50] day we're seeing the nature of God
[1:29:53] manifested in her life through trials
[1:29:55] every day am He's Alive and
[1:29:58] Well in that same me message he says
[1:30:01] we're children of God but we're losing
[1:30:04] our inheritance by our
[1:30:09] conduct the things that we do and the
[1:30:11] things that we permit to be done and the
[1:30:14] way we live and act and so forth we're
[1:30:18] living millions of miles below our
[1:30:22] privilege
[1:30:26] look if we listen to
[1:30:30] this we're going
[1:30:33] down this tells us we're
[1:30:36] right and what we got to
[1:30:39] do is deny
[1:30:42] this and remember the
[1:30:45] word this will keep us on track
[1:30:49] am I love Jacob he had a fight in him
[1:30:55] he had a real fight in
[1:30:57] him you
[1:31:00] know I could say
[1:31:02] this the natural seed had a fight in
[1:31:05] them
[1:31:07] too out of
[1:31:09] ishmail came the TW the 12 the Arab
[1:31:13] Nations they got to fight in
[1:31:16] them but their fight is
[1:31:19] physical it's outwardly
[1:31:24] but
[1:31:26] Jacob
[1:31:29] see we don't fight against flesh and
[1:31:31] blood right but we fight against
[1:31:35] principalities and spirits and you know
[1:31:36] where they're
[1:31:38] at they dwell inside of us
[1:31:41] often and if they're not dwelling in Us
[1:31:44] in that old
[1:31:45] nature it wants to come and anoint
[1:31:50] us and we need to recognize the fight is
[1:31:54] not here the fight is
[1:31:56] here Jacob had a fight here I don't care
[1:32:00] how good your fight is
[1:32:04] here The Battle Belongs to the Lord yes
[1:32:08] we've got to fight the good fight of
[1:32:11] Faith to get the nature change that's
[1:32:13] what we're fighting we don't want to
[1:32:16] become complacent with our old
[1:32:20] nature if we
[1:32:22] do I think think don't misunderstand me
[1:32:25] but just according to the scriptures
[1:32:27] that we're reading here if we become
[1:32:29] complacent about the nature change we're
[1:32:33] not going to find favor with
[1:32:36] God I don't want to be replaced with
[1:32:39] Esau just because I become complacent
[1:32:42] and not that big a deal if I get the
[1:32:44] nature
[1:32:47] change Jacob he held on to that heel I'm
[1:32:51] not going to let the blessings go right
[1:32:54] amen amen oh my my we're running we're
[1:32:59] running out of
[1:33:02] time you know what hopefully you're able
[1:33:07] to keep running just a little bit
[1:33:09] longer Romans chapter
[1:33:12] 8 Romans chapter 8 verse 5 I'm just
[1:33:15] going to try to read these scriptures
[1:33:17] and they which are the children of the
[1:33:21] flesh are not the children of God that
[1:33:23] what we in our opening scripture okay
[1:33:25] now this can
[1:33:27] transpire each and every day for
[1:33:30] us Romans 8 verse5 for they that are
[1:33:33] after The Flesh they do mind the things
[1:33:34] of the flesh but they that are after the
[1:33:36] spirit the things of the spirit but to
[1:33:38] be Carly minded is death but to be
[1:33:40] spiritually minded is is what life and
[1:33:43] peace because the carnal mind is enity
[1:33:45] it's against God it's against the word
[1:33:49] for it is not subject to the word
[1:33:51] neither indeed can it be right so then
[1:33:55] they that are in the flesh they can't
[1:33:57] even please
[1:33:59] God so how is God going to say I love
[1:34:01] you when you're in the
[1:34:06] flesh now don't misunderstand me I'm not
[1:34:08] trying to bring division here about
[1:34:12] God's love but what I am trying to say
[1:34:13] is we got to be
[1:34:16] honest we've got to be
[1:34:19] honest if our dealings it just doesn't
[1:34:22] matter about acting the right way living
[1:34:25] the right way how are we going to find
[1:34:27] favor with
[1:34:29] God Paul said to the galatian church
[1:34:31] this I say walk in the spirit and you
[1:34:33] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:34:37] so we have a a a part to do and he goes
[1:34:40] on and he's talking about this battle in
[1:34:42] verse 17 for the flesh lusteth against
[1:34:44] the spirit and the spirit against the
[1:34:45] Flesh and they are contrary to one
[1:34:47] another so that you cannot do the things
[1:34:49] that you would now you take any two
[1:34:51] people that when they're fighting
[1:34:55] think about all the divorces that have
[1:34:57] happened when they're fighting let me
[1:35:00] just say how often have you ever heard
[1:35:03] hey let's get into a fight I know I'm
[1:35:06] wrong it just don't
[1:35:10] exist every man's right in his own
[1:35:15] eyes but we got to understand there's a
[1:35:17] way to fight the right way
[1:35:25] Vengeance don't belong to
[1:35:27] us it belongs to God Amen God just wants
[1:35:31] us to represent
[1:35:33] him represent
[1:35:36] him if the whole world is condemning
[1:35:39] somebody don't you be added on be like
[1:35:42] Jesus where's your accusers neither do I
[1:35:45] condemn thee but we're in a battle I
[1:35:48] just want you to know we're we're in a
[1:35:49] battle that battle is inside amen the
[1:35:52] kingdom of God cometh not not with
[1:35:54] observation but it won't come without a
[1:35:58] fight Matthew 11:12 and from that from
[1:36:02] the days of John the Baptist until now
[1:36:06] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:36:09] and the violent taketh it by force
[1:36:13] that's exactly the type of what Jacob
[1:36:17] did we got to take on the nature of God
[1:36:20] by force because our old nature stand
[1:36:23] standing on the outside is too proudful
[1:36:26] it don't want to yield itself it don't
[1:36:28] want to Humble itself before the mighty
[1:36:30] hand of God it wants to act like it's a
[1:36:33] it's a Christian when it's when it when
[1:36:35] it's really not acting like
[1:36:39] one fight the good fight of Faith lay
[1:36:41] hold of eternal
[1:36:43] life lay hold of our inheritance amen
[1:36:47] take it by
[1:36:50] force Genesis chapter 32
[1:36:56] now I do want you to
[1:36:59] know that I didn't start on time
[1:37:02] today so I get a few extra
[1:37:05] minutes and just because of that a
[1:37:07] little extra time I can have all the
[1:37:10] time I want
[1:37:12] now no it's not true all right Genesis
[1:37:16] chapter 3 to verse 24
[1:37:27] Jacob was willing to
[1:37:30] fight to get what he
[1:37:33] needed and Jacob was left
[1:37:36] alone and wrestled with a
[1:37:39] man with him until the breaking of the
[1:37:44] day now that wasn't just a
[1:37:48] man he wrestled with
[1:37:51] God do you ever get in the prayer
[1:37:54] closet with God and
[1:37:58] you you needed
[1:38:03] him and a lot of times we get in the
[1:38:05] prayer closet we'll just go through our
[1:38:07] prayers and then you know we don't feel
[1:38:08] the presence of God we'll just like okay
[1:38:10] go on with our day I did my
[1:38:13] prayers yet we have needs yet we're just
[1:38:16] telling everybody about our
[1:38:20] needs or we're just wallowing because
[1:38:23] we've got these needs and nobody seems
[1:38:25] to want to help
[1:38:26] us now Jacob had a
[1:38:29] need he didn't get the whole church
[1:38:33] together he got alone with
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:36] God and he
[1:38:42] wrestled he wrestled until the presence
[1:38:45] of the Lord
[1:38:48] came and when he
[1:38:51] saw that he prevailed prevailed not
[1:38:54] against
[1:38:56] him this man was not prevailing against
[1:39:00] Jacob that he was real serious he
[1:39:04] touched the hollow of his thigh and the
[1:39:06] hollow of Jacob's uh he touched his
[1:39:09] thigh in the hollow of Jacob's thigh and
[1:39:11] was out of joint as he wrestled with him
[1:39:14] now notice when you spend the time that
[1:39:18] you need with God your life will change
[1:39:20] forever
[1:39:22] because Jacob's always his walk was
[1:39:26] never the same they say he always had a
[1:39:29] different walk and the only one that can
[1:39:32] change our nature is Jesus Christ amen
[1:39:36] and we've just got to get serious and
[1:39:38] really serious wrestle with them I'm
[1:39:40] sorry if coming to church made you a
[1:39:42] Christian then when you come over to my
[1:39:44] barn you either come goats or chickens
[1:39:47] or
[1:39:50] cats or chicken eggs
[1:39:56] we've got to go beyond being in church
[1:39:59] right we've got to start getting serious
[1:40:01] with the word
[1:40:04] Saints and he said let me go for the day
[1:40:08] breth and he said I will not let thee go
[1:40:12] except thou bless me now that's what has
[1:40:16] to happen when you want your nature to
[1:40:18] be changed Lord I'll not let you go
[1:40:20] until you change me amen
[1:40:24] amen we don't get to that place change
[1:40:26] ain't
[1:40:30] coming Jacob have I loved Esau have I
[1:40:34] had that's why God loved Jacob because
[1:40:38] he was willing to fight right and we're
[1:40:42] fighting not to enter a kingdom but to
[1:40:44] get the kingdom inside of us and God
[1:40:47] wants to give us the Holy Ghost more
[1:40:48] than we could ever want it
[1:40:51] amen he's pressing to get it in but our
[1:40:54] own nature says no I don't I don't think
[1:40:56] I want to do that I don't want it to die
[1:41:00] out but we have received a kingdom don't
[1:41:05] be scared don't be scared there's
[1:41:08] nothing to beared
[1:41:11] about imagine having peace when
[1:41:15] everything around you is blowing up how
[1:41:18] can you put a price tag on that
[1:41:23] how about when everybody's hating you
[1:41:26] but you have nothing but love coming out
[1:41:27] of
[1:41:32] you turmoil everywhere but you've got
[1:41:35] joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's
[1:41:38] God's kingdom inside of you amen now
[1:41:42] that's there we just got to yield to it
[1:41:45] if the seed is in there you yeld to it
[1:41:49] Hebrews 12:28
[1:41:51] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[1:41:54] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[1:41:56] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:42:00] reverence and godly fear one more
[1:42:04] scripture First Peter chapter 1 verse 22
[1:42:07] seeing ye have purified your souls in
[1:42:11] obeying the truth so the word's coming
[1:42:12] forth over the pulpit you're believing
[1:42:14] it you're saying amen with a
[1:42:17] heart in obeying the truth through the
[1:42:21] spirit unto UNF unfeigned love of the
[1:42:24] Brethren see that you love one another
[1:42:28] with a pure heart don't be a don't be
[1:42:30] some
[1:42:31] fake a pure heart and do it fervently
[1:42:35] yes sir look at this verse being born
[1:42:38] again a new nature change not of the
[1:42:41] corruptible seed but of Incorruptible
[1:42:45] amen by what the word of God not by
[1:42:49] Church attendance by the word of God
[1:42:52] which liveth and abideth
[1:42:55] forever for all the flesh is grass and
[1:42:57] all the glory of man is the flower of
[1:43:00] the grass the grass wither and the
[1:43:01] flower thereof falleth

[1:43:27] musicians the majority of them got
[1:43:29] caught up in
[1:43:33] drugs
[1:43:35] true yeah there was Glory of man but it
[1:43:37] was like the flower of the
[1:43:39] grass that withth and falleth away it's
[1:43:45] gone but the word of the Lord endureth
[1:43:48] forever and this is the word which by
[1:43:51] the gospel is preached un to you yes
