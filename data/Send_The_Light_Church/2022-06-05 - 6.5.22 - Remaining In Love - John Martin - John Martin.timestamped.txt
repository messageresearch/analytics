[31:12] a privilege it is to be

[31:20] but to dwell
[31:22] i'll be a living sanctuary we come here
[31:26] a couple times a week and gather
[31:28] together and this is called church in a
[31:30] sanctuary but
[31:33] god wants to have church all the time in
[31:34] our lives in our hearts and

[31:40] be singing

[32:57] real thing with god amen
[32:59] we
[33:00] we show the lord's death until he comes
[33:03] he wants us to remember calvary
[33:06] and and
[33:07] um
[33:09] so please be in prayer
[33:11] for one another concerning that amen
[33:13] amen
[33:14] um
[33:15] turn with me if you would to the book of
[33:17] saint john chapter 15
[33:23] we're going to we've
[33:26] been doing a little series on
[33:28] remaining with god
[33:31] and uh this morning we want to entitle
[33:34] this message remaining in
[33:36] love
[33:38] remaining in love you know a lot of
[33:40] times god is doing things in her life
[33:42] and we have no idea what he's doing
[33:45] and after a while we see it
[33:48] and i think that's how it is
[33:51] with the ministry too
[33:54] he's
[33:55] the one ministering the worst thing that
[33:56] we could do is think that's brother john
[34:00] that's the worst thing that we could do
[34:01] because that will never usher in faith
[34:04] never
[34:05] it will bring doubt but if we can
[34:07] believe that it's god
[34:10] then god can deal more with our hearts
[34:12] amen and before we begin reading here
[34:15] let's just ask god
[34:17] come and bless his word to us heavenly
[34:19] father
[34:22] we are all standing with one thing in
[34:24] common that as we're needy of you
[34:28] we need you lord that we could prosper
[34:31] in your word that we could
[34:33] remain
[34:34] faithful remain
[34:35] fruitful and remain in love with you
[34:38] where
[34:39] our dependency is upon you and we pray
[34:42] today lord that everything
[34:44] in our thoughts of the world in our life
[34:47] and what's happened in the past
[34:49] could all be set aside at this time and
[34:52] that
[34:53] our focus could just be on you lord
[34:57] bring us in to a place where
[35:00] lord your word is
[35:03] speaking to our heart we know it's you
[35:07] speaking
[35:09] lord for
[35:10] we want to love you more than
[35:13] than ever before and we need to in this
[35:15] hour and we need your help for that lord
[35:19] your word declares that the love of god
[35:22] is shut about in our heart by the holy
[35:23] ghost we prayed this morning that you
[35:25] would fill us with more of the holy
[35:28] ghost and we know that your word
[35:30] your word
[35:34] the living word is the holy ghost and we
[35:36] pray for the the word that is spoken to
[35:39] become
[35:40] living inside of us real to us a
[35:42] personal way today
[35:45] pray that you would meet all the needs
[35:47] that would be here amongst us lord for
[35:49] we're
[35:51] very needy and
[35:52] multiple needs in our lives and our our
[35:55] loved ones but you're a god that's
[35:58] able to to meet every one of them to
[36:01] exceed our expectation with them because
[36:04] of the mighty power
[36:06] that you have lord and that you are and
[36:09] we pray that you'd be with those that
[36:10] are not present today
[36:13] lord we ask that you would go forth
[36:15] and
[36:16] go before them and
[36:18] meet their need today lord protect them
[36:22] and
[36:23] bring them back safe and sound father we
[36:26] commit the service in your hand and ask
[36:28] you now that you bless the reading of
[36:30] the word to our hearts we humbly pray
[36:32] for this revelation in jesus christ's
[36:34] name amen
[36:36] amen just two verses in saint john 15
[36:40] verses 9
[36:41] and verses 10.
[36:44] as the father have loved me so have i
[36:47] loved you
[36:48] continue ye
[36:50] in my love
[36:52] if you keep my commandments
[36:55] you shall abide in my love even as i've
[36:57] kept my father's commandments and abide
[37:00] in his love god bless you you may be
[37:02] seated
[37:04] amen
[37:06] well
[37:07] it's good to see
[37:09] everyone today
[37:11] amen and we want to welcome a very
[37:14] special guest with us
[37:16] um but jim powers of course i think
[37:20] you're called jimmy a lot of times
[37:23] and i do remember you i do remember you
[37:26] it's so good to have you it's an honor
[37:27] to have you may the lord jesus bless and
[37:30] strengthen you this morning amen we
[37:32] certainly appreciate
[37:34] brother batman sister batman just
[37:38] grand people
[37:40] love the lord and
[37:42] uh
[37:44] we're just grateful what god can do for
[37:46] a human being
[37:48] and and change our very our our nature
[37:53] but we want to continue in this series
[37:55] not knowing
[37:56] uh how long it will go or where it will
[37:58] go i had a thought maybe this would be
[38:01] the final one
[38:02] and then just something just
[38:04] i just felt not to not to say that
[38:07] but
[38:08] there's a lot to remaining with god
[38:13] first john 4 8
[38:15] and 16 describe god is love
[38:20] just the foundation here love is not
[38:22] just part of god but he is love
[38:26] he is the very essence of the love and
[38:29] the instinctive nature of the divine
[38:32] agape love
[38:34] he is the source he is the author of
[38:37] agape love
[38:39] now
[38:40] this love of god is the most powerful
[38:43] force that there is in existence
[38:47] god literally changed the the formality
[38:50] of a perfect setting in heaven to be
[38:53] able to express all the love
[38:57] all the power that there is in the love
[38:58] of god and he allowed a completely
[39:01] different nature to be birthed just to
[39:04] exhibit and display this love
[39:07] because with without it he wouldn't be
[39:09] able to display it now this other nature
[39:12] that he let be birthed it was a a lesser
[39:14] love it was a a self-love a love for
[39:17] self and self-will
[39:20] and it took us
[39:22] self-centered love
[39:25] for god
[39:28] to fully express
[39:30] his love for his creation now think
[39:32] about that
[39:33] he had to have a contrast to how things
[39:37] are perfect in order
[39:39] for a full manifestation of what was
[39:42] perfect to be expressed
[39:47] like that song that we heard this
[39:48] morning
[39:51] a verse
[39:53] a line in that verse said show me things
[39:56] i've never seen before
[40:00] and that's what we're longing for we're
[40:02] longing to see more of god amen and the
[40:05] way that we do that is is to say i need
[40:08] i believe there's more forming
[40:12] where our flesh wants to feel like we've
[40:14] attained we've made it i've heard that i
[40:17] have read that
[40:18] and yet
[40:20] god wants to express something that we
[40:22] haven't seen on it and and revelation is
[40:25] um
[40:26] progressive we can get a revelation on
[40:28] the word a revelation of his love and
[40:31] and yet it just opens up more and more
[40:33] to us amen
[40:36] now a god who is holy and righteous and
[40:39] true he's never lied and yet
[40:42] he's the author of divine love and this
[40:45] love is described in the bible as is is
[40:47] a love that bears all things believes
[40:50] all things hopes all things endures all
[40:52] things and it never never never not once
[40:55] has failed amen right amen
[40:59] it is the love of our redemption of our
[41:02] salvation
[41:05] a love that is not self-centered it's
[41:08] not puffed up it doesn't vaunteth itself
[41:11] it doesn't seek it its own
[41:14] if i can say these two loves in one
[41:16] sense are a contrast to one
[41:18] another yes
[41:22] it's a love that seeketh after the
[41:24] well-being of others
[41:28] that's why the prophet could
[41:30] say that eternal life was truly living
[41:32] for others it wasn't a cliche it wasn't
[41:36] a saying
[41:37] it was a manifestation
[41:39] it's a love that's manifested in living
[41:41] for others
[41:43] and this love will bear
[41:46] all things
[41:47] and it's it's been
[41:48] uh it will give all things it is willing
[41:51] to suffer all things in order to see a
[41:55] soul
[41:56] prosper
[42:00] in fact there's no greater love than a
[42:02] man lay down his life for his friends
[42:05] for god so loved the world that he gave
[42:08] his only begotten son
[42:12] the love was so great
[42:14] that he gave and imagine if there was no
[42:18] lesser love no selfish love
[42:20] no
[42:21] uh no sin as we've been taught
[42:24] then god would never be able to express
[42:27] so great a love by giving because
[42:29] there'd be nothing to give to
[42:32] god is love and he so loved that he gave
[42:36] his perfect son
[42:41] so what does god expect back from us
[42:46] does this great love
[42:48] divine request expect or demand
[42:52] something back
[42:54] how can it be freely given and yet
[42:59] there'd be some sort of expectation
[43:02] right
[43:03] like a string attached
[43:08] now we can accept
[43:10] what his love has did for us or we can
[43:13] accept his love into our hearts
[43:17] it's two different things
[43:20] because everybody will accept salvation
[43:23] except except
[43:25] escape from hell
[43:31] he would that none would perish
[43:35] god's intention was not to just save us
[43:38] from hell
[43:39] he really wants to have a relationship
[43:41] with us
[43:45] now he would that none would perish but
[43:47] we will perish without a relationship
[43:49] amen
[43:52] because it isn't just grace for the
[43:54] whole world the whole world's saved no
[43:56] matter what
[43:58] no we've got to come to that place of a
[44:01] real relationship with god amen
[44:04] and as the prophet taught us there's no
[44:06] shirttail experiences
[44:08] we've got to have it personal for
[44:10] ourselves
[44:12] first john chapter 4 verse 11 says
[44:14] beloved first john chapter 4 verse 11
[44:17] beloved if god so loved us
[44:20] we ought also to love one another
[44:27] now what does that word ought mean just
[44:29] think about that
[44:32] if i said brother ryan you
[44:34] you ought to be sitting in some other
[44:35] chair
[44:39] he's not going to feel like he has to
[44:41] sit in another chair
[44:43] because it's just ought
[44:46] don't have to it's just ought
[44:50] it's not quite what it means
[44:52] no man have seen god at any time if we
[44:55] love one another god dwelleth in us
[44:58] and his love is perfected in us now
[45:01] notice if we love one another
[45:06] that's the key
[45:09] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[45:11] he and us because he's given us his
[45:13] spirit
[45:14] right
[45:15] and and the love of god is shared
[45:16] brought in their heart by the holy
[45:18] spirit
[45:20] first john 3 16 hereby perceive we
[45:23] the love of god because he laid down his
[45:25] life for us
[45:27] and we ought there it is again and we
[45:30] ought to lay down our lives for the
[45:31] brethren
[45:34] now john expressed that we ought to lay
[45:36] down our lives but jesus said it was a
[45:38] commandment
[45:41] john 15 12 says this is my commandment
[45:44] that ye love one another as i have loved
[45:47] you
[45:50] the same way
[45:55] every parent wants their children to
[45:58] follow them
[46:02] if
[46:03] a parent teaches a child to
[46:07] their manners to say please to say thank
[46:09] you
[46:10] to say excuse me to say i'm sorry
[46:16] that parent wants that child to follow
[46:18] that
[46:19] it's just a natural thing
[46:25] and god wants us to follow
[46:29] what he's teaching us
[46:32] and that's truly to love one another
[46:34] exactly the same way amen
[46:37] now how false is it for a parent to
[46:40] teach his child
[46:42] i just thought it was so ironic in my
[46:44] life growing up not quite knowing
[46:48] god but seeing that
[46:50] my dad
[46:52] would tell me not to smoke while he had
[46:55] a cigarette he was smoking on
[47:05] any decent parent thinking knows that
[47:08] he's got to do what he's asking his
[47:10] children to do
[47:13] not to make light of my father but if
[47:16] you don't understand
[47:20] you really don't have god you can only
[47:23] do your best so you've got to do what
[47:25] you're asking your children to do
[47:28] and it's never too much
[47:31] it's never too much
[47:35] so is it too much that we love others
[47:37] the way that god has loved us now we
[47:39] can't do that with filial love we can't
[47:41] do that with our own abilities our own
[47:43] mind our own efforts
[47:45] it takes god living inside of us to be
[47:48] able to do that
[47:56] this is my commandment that ye love one
[47:59] another as i have loved you
[48:05] we're no longer
[48:07] just
[48:09] god's love is no longer just to benefit
[48:12] us
[48:13] it might have at the beginning
[48:16] right because we needed salvation
[48:19] but after a while there's an expectation
[48:23] we've been commanded by the son of god
[48:25] to manifest the same love now to others
[48:28] and he said in verse 13 that greater
[48:31] love have no man than this than a man
[48:33] lay down his life for his friends
[48:37] he came from eternity to show that
[48:40] and now he's saying you're here on earth
[48:42] and you just you just you start doing
[48:44] that to one another
[48:47] and then he says you are my friends if
[48:49] you do whatever i command you
[48:54] to love others with a self-centered love
[48:56] and yet proclaim christianity is false
[49:05] and he says that you're my friends if
[49:10] condition
[49:12] he's the only one that can make
[49:14] conditions
[49:19] how many times have you made conditions
[49:21] with your children
[49:23] yes you can play outside if you clean
[49:24] your room
[49:26] we've all made them
[49:28] and it's normal it's right how many
[49:30] times our kids say this isn't fair
[49:33] joe or tim's or sally's mom and dad
[49:36] don't make him do that
[49:39] comparing with
[49:41] and the devil just wants us to compare
[49:44] we can do what we want we don't have to
[49:45] go serve god
[49:51] jesus told his disciples that the very
[49:53] identity of a man's relationship with
[49:56] god would be expressed through the
[49:58] manifestation of the same love
[50:03] john 13 34 a new commandment i give it
[50:06] unto you that you love one another as i
[50:08] have loved you that ye also love one
[50:10] another and by this
[50:13] shall all men know
[50:15] that you're my disciple
[50:17] if you have love one for another amen
[50:21] it's the very identity of a man's
[50:24] relationship with god
[50:29] it's not what we know it's not what we
[50:32] say it's not what we quote it's not
[50:34] where we go it's what we manifest
[50:41] now to remain in a place that god will
[50:43] call you as disciples friend you've got
[50:45] to remain in love
[50:48] there's no other way the word is the
[50:51] only way the only truth and the only
[50:53] life there's there is no other way
[50:57] of course the world is full of different
[50:58] churches and dominations that try to
[51:01] point us in a way different other than
[51:04] the full word now all of them have a
[51:06] portion of the word
[51:10] but none of them have all the word
[51:14] and he's in his word he will always back
[51:17] up the word
[51:19] john 15 9 as the father have loved me so
[51:24] have i loved you
[51:26] so it is a trinkle dino down effect
[51:30] as the father's love me so i have loved
[51:33] you
[51:33] and i'm going to continue to love you
[51:35] right to the end i'm going to die for
[51:37] you and he says continue ye in my love
[51:40] just continue in it don't let it stop
[51:45] i'm just lock it up
[51:47] and if you keep my commandments you
[51:49] shall abide in my love even as i've kept
[51:52] my father's commandments and i abide in
[51:54] his love
[51:57] now if we don't abide in the commandment
[51:59] and what he's teaching us and telling us
[52:02] and whispering to our hearts there comes
[52:04] a separation between us and god
[52:07] and the and the thing of it is that
[52:09] that many believers don't even recognize
[52:12] it's happening
[52:14] because they're they they feel it's okay
[52:18] because nobody's perfect you know
[52:19] brother branham said that after the
[52:20] rapture happens people will be coming to
[52:22] the altar thinking gentiles will be
[52:23] coming to the altar thinking that
[52:25] they're getting saved and it'll be too
[52:26] late
[52:27] but they're still going through the
[52:29] formality of it
[52:31] but in themselves they think they're
[52:33] right they're doing the right thing
[52:36] so you see that we can still the devil
[52:39] has got the ability to convince
[52:41] humans
[52:43] church people church goers that they
[52:45] love god and they don't have to keep the
[52:47] commandments
[52:50] but i'll say this the elect will not be
[52:52] deceived
[52:52] [Music]
[52:54] that's the only group that that doesn't
[52:56] buy that
[52:59] the only group
[53:03] we were to ask most people
[53:05] who we know personally in our life think
[53:07] about them ask them this question do you
[53:10] love god or do you hate god
[53:14] now most people
[53:16] may not answer i love god
[53:20] but they certainly would never say i
[53:23] hate god
[53:25] so by default
[53:26] they feel they love god
[53:31] some people feel they love god all the
[53:33] time
[53:35] no matter what they do in life
[53:40] most people would not
[53:43] express
[53:46] with their own mouth a separation
[53:48] between them and god
[53:52] they don't want to cut them off
[53:55] they look at jesus
[53:57] as someone they're fond of
[54:00] even though they really don't know him
[54:04] even though they don't spend much time
[54:05] together
[54:07] maybe the same way they would look at
[54:09] their favorite singer or their movie
[54:11] star
[54:12] an athlete or some superhero
[54:15] they would say they just love them
[54:17] but they don't even spend time with them
[54:21] we've all been guilty of saying oh i
[54:23] love him i love the way he yeah he's a
[54:26] good one don't even know him
[54:28] a lot of times how people look at jesus
[54:32] many people love god with their natural
[54:34] female love and it feels like god's love
[54:38] but it's simply not right
[54:41] we want to remember what jesus taught us
[54:43] and if i could just paraphrase this
[54:46] if you love me it's not just a feeling
[54:49] it's a discipline of keeping my
[54:51] commandments
[54:53] it's a discipline
[54:56] it's not a feeling
[54:59] so forget the feelings
[55:00] forget the excuses
[55:02] focus on the direction that we need to
[55:04] be walking in
[55:07] jesus is always showing us how to live
[55:10] more for others
[55:12] we all believe in it
[55:14] we all say we're doing it
[55:17] but i'm telling you
[55:21] we need to do it more
[55:22] we need to do it more and jesus is
[55:24] constantly showing us more
[55:28] he's bringing all things to our
[55:30] remembrance
[55:32] as the devil is trying to always get us
[55:34] to compromise just like he did eve
[55:36] we've got to recognize
[55:38] the hiss of the serpent
[55:41] like that compromiser
[55:44] brother branham makes this statement he
[55:45] says we could love god
[55:47] every day
[55:48] of our lives
[55:49] and still
[55:51] miss it
[55:53] still miss it
[55:55] that means
[55:56] we've got to love god with his love
[56:00] that our love for him is not good enough
[56:03] we've got to love him back with the
[56:05] divine agape love
[56:07] and that only comes it only comes by the
[56:10] holy ghost and i don't understand why
[56:12] we're not seeking more holy ghost
[56:16] how else can we get filled with the love
[56:18] of god amen it's not something that we
[56:21] intellectually get
[56:23] and one of the hardest things that we
[56:25] could i feel it's more detrimental to us
[56:27] than good when we say i've got the holy
[56:30] ghost how about saying i need more holy
[56:32] ghost
[56:34] i'm not going to take away for what we
[56:36] have
[56:37] but if what you have has caused you to
[56:39] lay down your life for everybody until
[56:42] you die i'll say stay with it but if you
[56:44] see that you could be giving yourself
[56:46] more to the cause of christ then then
[56:49] seek the holy ghost and ask for more of
[56:51] the holy ghost because it's only christ
[56:53] in you that can do it
[56:59] ezekiel chapter 11 verse 19
[57:05] god's love
[57:07] will keep his commandments
[57:09] my love won't
[57:13] ezekiel 11 verse 19 and i will give them
[57:16] one heart and i will put a new spirit
[57:18] with in you
[57:21] and i will take oh take the stony heart
[57:23] out of you out of your flesh and i will
[57:26] give you a heart of flesh
[57:29] you ever look at somebody
[57:31] the way they're acting
[57:33] just say
[57:35] they just seem to be cold
[57:38] cold hard
[57:41] right
[57:42] well god promised us to take that out of
[57:45] us
[57:47] and to give us a heart
[57:49] of flesh in other words when you when
[57:51] you've ever seen a heart beat
[57:54] on tv we've all seen them
[57:57] it's pumping
[57:59] it's not
[58:01] it's moving
[58:05] our love needs to be moving amen
[58:12] that they may walk in my statutes that's
[58:14] the kind of walk the moving that needs
[58:16] to be happened
[58:18] so he puts us in us and he he says and
[58:21] keep my ordinance and do them they will
[58:24] walk in my sister keep my ordinance and
[58:26] do them and they shall be my people and
[58:28] i shall be their god all because he put
[58:31] a new spirit in us
[58:33] and that spirit will generate the love
[58:36] of god amen in our hearts
[58:41] it was just like
[58:45] mary
[58:46] was
[58:47] conceived and brought forth a son a
[58:49] supernatural experience that no man can
[58:51] explain
[58:53] that's exactly the same way that happens
[58:55] inside of you and me
[58:57] we can't explain it we try to figure it
[58:59] out we try to define it we try to say i
[59:02] got it we we try but you know what we
[59:05] can't we're just human beings
[59:07] it's god that does the supernatural in
[59:10] our lives
[59:11] if we can love one another without
[59:14] respect to persons brother sister that
[59:16] is not you anymore that's god in you the
[59:19] hope of glory
[59:23] but it's for them whose heart walketh
[59:25] after the
[59:26] uh whose heart walketh after the heart
[59:29] of their
[59:31] detestable things detestable things and
[59:34] their abominations
[59:36] basically after their own desires and i
[59:38] will i will recompense their way upon
[59:42] their own heads saith the lord god
[59:47] we've got to surrender our will
[59:51] ezekiel 36 26
[59:53] a new heart also i give you
[59:56] and a new spirit well i put within you
[59:59] and i will take away the stony heart out
[1:00:02] of your flesh and i will give you a
[1:00:03] heart of flesh
[1:00:05] and i will put my spirit within you and
[1:00:07] cause you
[1:00:09] to walk in my stats did you ever wonder
[1:00:11] i just can't see i don't feel like doing
[1:00:13] that i don't want to do that that's
[1:00:15] understandable that's the nature of our
[1:00:17] flesh
[1:00:18] that's why we just simply seek more of
[1:00:20] god we will automatically want to do it
[1:00:23] we want to walk in his word and keep his
[1:00:25] commandments and love one another and
[1:00:27] lay down our life because it's no longer
[1:00:29] us
[1:00:31] it's christ in us
[1:00:34] and we'll give him the glory for it too
[1:00:37] i will put my spirit within you and
[1:00:39] cause you to walk my statutes and to
[1:00:40] keep my judgments and to do them and ye
[1:00:44] shall dwell in the land that i
[1:00:46] give to your fathers and ye shall be my
[1:00:49] people and i
[1:00:50] will be
[1:00:52] your
[1:00:53] god
[1:00:54] it looks like god wants to do more than
[1:00:57] just save us from hell
[1:00:59] it looks like there's a relationship
[1:01:01] he's interested in
[1:01:03] it's no longer the
[1:01:05] the the preacher telling you the do's
[1:01:08] and don'ts of how to be a christian
[1:01:11] amen
[1:01:12] it's about god speaking to our hearts
[1:01:15] and
[1:01:15] calling us to a place with him that
[1:01:18] he wants us to abide in and to to dwell
[1:01:21] in and to to stay there to remain there
[1:01:25] we've all had experience with with god
[1:01:27] no doubt
[1:01:29] and how many of us wish they would
[1:01:31] continue
[1:01:33] amen well they they're not a gift
[1:01:36] if they were a gift then god would not
[1:01:39] count it as a relationship
[1:01:43] because all the angels in heaven are
[1:01:45] doing what god created them to do
[1:01:49] he wants to see
[1:01:51] someone
[1:01:52] with a choice
[1:01:54] to deny their own will
[1:01:57] for the will of god amen
[1:02:00] that's a love affair
[1:02:02] it's a real love affair
[1:02:06] if we're wanting
[1:02:07] more of the love of god in ours we ought
[1:02:10] to be seeking more of the holy ghost
[1:02:14] you can't
[1:02:16] separate the two
[1:02:19] in fact there's a lot of people that say
[1:02:21] they got the holy ghost but they don't
[1:02:22] love the bible tells me that they're
[1:02:24] a liar they're false
[1:02:27] now that's what the word says
[1:02:30] so i i don't mean to disappoint
[1:02:34] my
[1:02:35] disagreement with you
[1:02:38] but i'd rather stay with the word
[1:02:42] the word created us the word created the
[1:02:45] the world that we live in every morning
[1:02:48] i get up and i give god thanks for
[1:02:50] another day of life that i don't deserve
[1:02:54] i don't deserve to live today
[1:02:59] it makes me want to give more back to
[1:03:01] him
[1:03:04] the holy ghost will bring the divine
[1:03:06] nature of god's love into our heart it
[1:03:08] just will
[1:03:10] and when the love is projected brother
[1:03:12] branham says
[1:03:13] sovereign grace will take over
[1:03:16] so we need to project god's love
[1:03:19] i think too often when we're rejecting
[1:03:21] our own love
[1:03:22] our own thoughts our own desires our own
[1:03:24] wishes
[1:03:25] but we need to project his love amen
[1:03:29] and grace
[1:03:32] grace
[1:03:34] he supplieth all of our needs
[1:03:37] his grace will supply all of our needs
[1:03:39] according to his riches in glory
[1:03:44] let me say this too many people rely on
[1:03:46] past experiences
[1:03:48] that they've had with god as being good
[1:03:50] enough
[1:03:52] as if it's some sort
[1:03:54] of
[1:03:55] um
[1:03:56] identity about their relationship with
[1:03:59] god but jesus never said that right amen
[1:04:02] jesus never said because this
[1:04:05] great
[1:04:06] experiences and i used you
[1:04:09] it proves that you're my disciple
[1:04:12] he never said that
[1:04:14] we're saying that but he never said that
[1:04:18] he said when you manifest the laying
[1:04:20] down of your will your time your life
[1:04:23] your money to get some soul to a
[1:04:26] relationship with jesus because that's
[1:04:28] what he's doing he's knocking on the
[1:04:30] door wanting a relationship wanting to
[1:04:33] come in
[1:04:35] i mean he could take any one of us at
[1:04:37] any given time and use us
[1:04:42] to to lay hands on somebody to see them
[1:04:45] healed to speak with tongues to cast out
[1:04:47] a devil he could use any one of us at
[1:04:49] any time
[1:04:53] but none of it would show a relationship
[1:04:55] with god
[1:04:58] i mean if the devil used me what's
[1:05:00] what's greater than he uses the devil
[1:05:03] i'm comparing myself with the devil
[1:05:07] it's not god using
[1:05:10] it's you abiding in his love that's
[1:05:12] what's important
[1:05:14] that's what the focus needs to to remain
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:22] has warned us that even though we are
[1:05:24] connected at one time in bearing fruit
[1:05:28] that we need to stay connected
[1:05:31] we need to stay in the vine or we get
[1:05:33] separated
[1:05:35] he said abide in me abide in my love
[1:05:37] without me you can do nothing
[1:05:39] if you don't bear fruit you're going to
[1:05:41] be cut off
[1:05:43] so these are just their warnings
[1:05:46] so jesus wants us to keep bearing fruit
[1:05:48] and the only way we can keep bearing
[1:05:50] spiritual fruit is to keep abiding
[1:05:54] spiritually in his love now i'll say it
[1:05:56] like this don't don't try to love god
[1:05:59] anymore with your natural love amen
[1:06:02] that's one minute you love them one
[1:06:04] minute you don't
[1:06:05] it's getting the old daisy out
[1:06:07] he loves me he loves me not he loves me
[1:06:10] she loves me not
[1:06:13] it's north pole south pole love live for
[1:06:16] others live for self
[1:06:18] you've got to abide in the love of god
[1:06:21] just remain there burning on fire for
[1:06:24] god
[1:06:25] continue in my love jesus said abide in
[1:06:28] my love even as i've kept my father's
[1:06:30] commandments and abide
[1:06:33] in his love he didn't leave he didn't
[1:06:35] lead the father's love right
[1:06:37] and that word abide
[1:06:40] that was just the foundation that we're
[1:06:41] starting the service
[1:06:44] the word abide is a verb
[1:06:48] not a noun
[1:06:51] meaning to stay
[1:06:54] in a given place
[1:06:56] a state a relationship
[1:06:58] or expense expectancy
[1:07:02] it means to continue to dwell to endure
[1:07:04] to be present to remain
[1:07:08] that's what it means to abide
[1:07:11] but in the midst of all that
[1:07:14] we have a choice
[1:07:17] we have a choice whether we're going to
[1:07:18] abide or not abide
[1:07:22] god does his part god said i'll never
[1:07:24] leave you i'll never forsake you
[1:07:28] but the bible doesn't say you'll never
[1:07:30] leave me and you'll never forsake me
[1:07:35] he said no man can pluck you from my
[1:07:38] from the father's hand no man can pluck
[1:07:40] you from my hand that doesn't mean we
[1:07:43] can't jump out and do our own thing
[1:07:48] he said nothing can separate you from
[1:07:50] the love of god
[1:07:52] but you can
[1:07:55] you can fall in love with other things
[1:07:57] and do your will
[1:07:59] you can change your mind
[1:08:02] you can go from one place to another
[1:08:04] place
[1:08:05] so i'll tell you this this thing that we
[1:08:08] emphasize here about a relationship it
[1:08:10] is the hottest thing
[1:08:15] i'll tell you brother johnson if there's
[1:08:16] anything i learned
[1:08:18] in your church there's anything i
[1:08:20] learned in this message
[1:08:22] it was about a relationship
[1:08:24] i don't know where anybody else was at
[1:08:26] i don't know where their thoughts or
[1:08:28] what they were wanting or what they
[1:08:29] wanted to get out of coming to church i
[1:08:31] don't know
[1:08:32] i don't know but to me it was about a
[1:08:34] relationship
[1:08:36] and i'm so thankful i i as
[1:08:39] brother branham says i'm so glad that he
[1:08:41] got a hold of me before the church did
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:50] you
[1:08:50] know for even a man at his very best
[1:08:54] trying to help us
[1:08:57] not to belittle that
[1:09:00] but it ain't good enough a man that his
[1:09:01] very best is all vanity and a man stand
[1:09:03] behind the pulpit trying to do his best
[1:09:05] to help you is not good enough we need
[1:09:07] god in that man because it's got to be
[1:09:09] god speaking to us god's got to help us
[1:09:12] if god don't build the church they that
[1:09:14] labor labor in vain amen it's got to be
[1:09:17] him
[1:09:20] now we have a choice where we go to
[1:09:22] church
[1:09:23] the food we eat the friends we have
[1:09:26] what we're going to do with our lives
[1:09:29] we certainly have a choice
[1:09:31] in whether we're going to remain in
[1:09:33] god's love or not just don't let the
[1:09:35] devil tell you that it's automatic right
[1:09:40] all you got to do is look at your spouse
[1:09:44] and for a moment you give me an answer
[1:09:46] is it okay if your spouse does whatever
[1:09:48] she wants or whatever he wants all the
[1:09:49] time that they do it and expect that to
[1:09:52] be love abiding in that love
[1:09:54] no you would never have that
[1:09:57] in fact after a while they're not doing
[1:09:58] what you want them to do you say excuse
[1:10:02] me
[1:10:07] there's two to this marriage there's two
[1:10:10] to this relationship
[1:10:12] we can't go do what we want and say
[1:10:14] we're abiding in god's love it just
[1:10:16] doesn't work
[1:10:18] satan wants us to think it works but it
[1:10:20] doesn't
[1:10:23] don't automatically happen
[1:10:25] bible says we've got to fight the good
[1:10:27] fight of faith
[1:10:31] satan is always trying to steal our
[1:10:33] faith right so we got to fight for it
[1:10:36] well as we gotta fight for faith we
[1:10:38] gotta we gotta fight to stay in love
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:43] every time you watch something on tv
[1:10:46] tell me you get off from watching what
[1:10:48] you watched on tv and you feel you're so
[1:10:50] more in love with god
[1:10:53] you got everything in this brother
[1:10:55] trying to pull you away from a
[1:10:57] relationship of a burning love with
[1:10:59] jesus christ
[1:11:02] the brandon said in the message a man
[1:11:04] running from the presence of the lord
[1:11:07] he's speaking about responsibility as a
[1:11:09] true christian he says it's a constant
[1:11:12] burning of the fire and the love of god
[1:11:14] in the heart that sets you of fire and
[1:11:17] puts you out yonder with people making
[1:11:19] converts uh to cry so the next time that
[1:11:22] you want to answer if you're in love
[1:11:25] with god
[1:11:26] i want you to define if you are are
[1:11:29] experiencing this in your life
[1:11:34] because i think what a lot of message
[1:11:36] people want to do they want to redefine
[1:11:38] christianity than what the prophet said
[1:11:46] do you got the constant burning
[1:11:50] is it fire and love
[1:11:52] in your heart can't be in your head
[1:11:55] got to be in your heart
[1:11:57] and what does it do when it's so strong
[1:11:59] in your heart it sets you of fire and
[1:12:02] puts you out yonder it makes you go
[1:12:04] places that you wouldn't normally go
[1:12:06] makes you do things you wouldn't
[1:12:08] normally do
[1:12:09] and it isn't about you anymore it's the
[1:12:11] same thing that
[1:12:13] the father did through jesus when he
[1:12:16] gave his only begotten son and what
[1:12:18] jesus told his disciples to do to abide
[1:12:20] in my love to continue in my love and
[1:12:24] and to lay down your lies for one
[1:12:26] another keep it going
[1:12:28] don't just agree with it but keep it
[1:12:30] going keep it going you're not doing it
[1:12:32] for the church you're doing it for your
[1:12:34] relationship with jesus christ because
[1:12:36] that's all that matters the church
[1:12:38] doesn't matter but your relationship
[1:12:39] with christ that matters
[1:12:41] that matters to god
[1:12:44] we've got a whole world full of churches
[1:12:46] that people are married to the church we
[1:12:48] want to be married to christ
[1:12:50] married to the word
[1:12:52] bring forth sons and daughters of god
[1:12:56] with real with a real burning in their
[1:12:58] heart
[1:13:02] we all know it's harder to remain in
[1:13:04] love
[1:13:05] with god today
[1:13:08] than ever before
[1:13:10] we're living in the most hateful hour in
[1:13:13] the history of mankind
[1:13:14] the most hateful hour
[1:13:18] even church goers
[1:13:20] are more in love with themselves
[1:13:25] than at any other time
[1:13:27] they're more in love with themselves
[1:13:29] than in love with god
[1:13:32] but there's a little group
[1:13:34] that has received a revelation of how to
[1:13:37] overcome
[1:13:39] in their life
[1:13:42] and revelations tells us they lay they
[1:13:44] love not their lives unto death
[1:13:49] it is not a gift god is not going to
[1:13:50] hand you a gift of just hating yourself
[1:13:54] because every day you wake up and you
[1:13:57] get in front of the mirror and you're
[1:13:58] hoping that you look better than you did
[1:14:00] the day before
[1:14:04] it's in
[1:14:05] our instinctive nature to want to
[1:14:09] be good look good to love ourselves and
[1:14:12] to have others look at us and
[1:14:14] and say wow you're the greatest thing
[1:14:17] since sliced bread
[1:14:22] after a while you just get all toasted
[1:14:24] up and
[1:14:28] but if there's one revelation we need we
[1:14:30] need the revelation of not loving our
[1:14:33] lives to death now jesus said if any man
[1:14:35] come after me he's got to deny himself
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:39] to to let go of his will
[1:14:43] because if we seek to save it we're
[1:14:44] going to lose it
[1:14:46] and you've got to maintain that in your
[1:14:48] relationship right to the end of your
[1:14:50] death
[1:14:53] all the way through and the more that
[1:14:55] you can maintain it the more of the
[1:14:57] fruit of god can come in your life
[1:15:05] today believers are in love with
[1:15:06] pleasures
[1:15:08] more than they're in love with god
[1:15:13] sarah thought while you could do this
[1:15:15] it's not a big thing
[1:15:17] come on
[1:15:18] before you know it you're doing more of
[1:15:20] it and doing more of it
[1:15:22] and
[1:15:23] before long you're looking forward to it
[1:15:28] and then before you know it you're
[1:15:30] making sacrifices that you could be
[1:15:32] spending time with god just to do it
[1:15:35] it just keeps
[1:15:36] growing now this is church people
[1:15:40] second timothy chapter 3 verse 2 says
[1:15:43] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:15:45] self
[1:15:47] covetous bolsters proud unthankful
[1:15:51] this is the condition that the devil has
[1:15:53] gotten the church into
[1:15:56] now we know the bible says that satan
[1:15:59] he's weakening the nations the whole
[1:16:01] world is being weakened right now
[1:16:04] not just our nation
[1:16:07] we're the strongest nation
[1:16:09] becoming the weakest
[1:16:14] but he's also weakening the churches
[1:16:18] and how is he doing it
[1:16:20] by giving them what their flesh wants
[1:16:24] you want entertainment you want to be
[1:16:26] you want to enjoy a good happy time in
[1:16:29] church
[1:16:30] want your flesh to say yeah that was a
[1:16:32] good one or i he's funny or or
[1:16:35] are they they they got the great voices
[1:16:38] in their singing and the lights and you
[1:16:40] know i just love the way that
[1:16:43] nothing about the word
[1:16:46] nothing about the attraction of the word
[1:16:48] the bride is attracted to the word
[1:16:50] that's all she's looking at is all she
[1:16:52] wants
[1:16:54] because one day she's going to manifest
[1:16:56] it
[1:16:59] now the thing is
[1:17:01] don't let satan tell you
[1:17:04] you'll manifest at all
[1:17:06] at the end
[1:17:10] what you've got to believe is god has
[1:17:11] given us the word today to manifest it
[1:17:13] tomorrow amen amen
[1:17:17] and if you don't believe it it can't
[1:17:18] happen but you've got to receive that by
[1:17:20] faith
[1:17:23] when jesus was describing the end of the
[1:17:24] world in matthew chapter 24 verses 10
[1:17:28] through
[1:17:29] 13 he says and
[1:17:31] then shall many be offended
[1:17:36] many shall be
[1:17:38] offended
[1:17:40] i don't think it's just going down the
[1:17:42] road and somebody kind of cuts in front
[1:17:44] of you and you get all worked up
[1:17:47] i'm i'm i'm saying it's in church i see
[1:17:50] it
[1:17:52] people just get offended about
[1:17:53] everything
[1:17:55] you go one minute after 60 minutes
[1:18:01] not true i'm not saying that
[1:18:05] but the bible says jesus said and shall
[1:18:08] betray betray one another
[1:18:11] people would become so
[1:18:13] bothered
[1:18:14] they're actually going to betray someone
[1:18:18] you know when you kill somebody they got
[1:18:20] different degrees right
[1:18:22] a
[1:18:23] man's right first degree and one of
[1:18:25] them's premeditated
[1:18:28] that's real bad you premeditate it you
[1:18:30] you know then you're really in trouble
[1:18:35] imagine betraying somebody
[1:18:38] you're consciously thinking i am not
[1:18:41] going to try
[1:18:43] to keep in unity
[1:18:45] with this brother
[1:18:50] it's not what we think
[1:18:55] and shall hate one another
[1:18:58] jester i love him
[1:19:00] i love him
[1:19:01] just a little bit less
[1:19:06] because i i don't want to say just
[1:19:08] outright
[1:19:10] because then i know i'd be wrong i feel
[1:19:12] convicted
[1:19:14] i don't want anybody know that
[1:19:16] i just do it a little bit
[1:19:18] how about love with god's love
[1:19:21] it's without respect to persons it lays
[1:19:23] down its
[1:19:24] life for its enemies
[1:19:28] now offended means entrapped tripped up
[1:19:31] enticed to sin or fall away into
[1:19:34] apostasy
[1:19:36] many shall betray one another and hate
[1:19:39] one another we're not exempt from the
[1:19:42] end times
[1:19:45] it isn't like you're so special that the
[1:19:47] devil is not going to come to you and
[1:19:48] bother your mind
[1:19:50] he's going to try to get in you
[1:19:53] to get in between somebody and call some
[1:19:55] division
[1:19:57] but when you learn to be so connected to
[1:19:59] god so in love with god that the devil
[1:20:02] can't use you for hate for a lesser love
[1:20:08] invite this more of the spirit of god in
[1:20:11] you don't be satisfied with how much you
[1:20:13] got
[1:20:16] always want more
[1:20:17] and he says here in verse 11 many false
[1:20:19] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[1:20:21] many
[1:20:22] many people are going to arise
[1:20:27] and deceive many in other words uh so
[1:20:30] you got these people that are offended
[1:20:31] betraying one another and hating one
[1:20:33] another
[1:20:35] and they think it's okay
[1:20:40] there must be a spirit that's letting
[1:20:43] them think
[1:20:44] it's justifiable
[1:20:47] they still love god they still go they
[1:20:48] still believe the message they still
[1:20:50] sing and shout and praise god and talk
[1:20:53] about
[1:20:55] but they're deceived
[1:20:59] and it says and because iniquity shall
[1:21:02] abound
[1:21:04] the love of many
[1:21:06] shall wax
[1:21:08] cold
[1:21:15] love is an act of
[1:21:18] an act it's an active thing
[1:21:22] if it's not you might also say i loved
[1:21:25] at one
[1:21:26] time but to love is active
[1:21:31] it's not on hold
[1:21:33] you don't put love on hold
[1:21:38] if it wasn't for god loving us
[1:21:40] unconditionally we'd be in trouble
[1:21:42] and we got to love the way he loves amen
[1:21:49] believers are not abiding in god's love
[1:21:51] today
[1:21:54] they have a whole lot of expectation for
[1:21:56] others or what they should be doing and
[1:21:58] how they should be giving and how they
[1:22:00] should be laying down and loving
[1:22:03] but they themselves are
[1:22:05] cold
[1:22:09] so it's like they have a knowledge of it
[1:22:10] but they don't possess the spirit of it
[1:22:14] they're not really generating the warmth
[1:22:16] of god's love
[1:22:18] we've all heard the the saying you can't
[1:22:20] get
[1:22:21] warmed by a painted fire
[1:22:24] some beautiful
[1:22:26] picture of a nice fire
[1:22:29] oftentimes
[1:22:30] uh ann will send me a a picture of her
[1:22:33] fire that she's got at the camp and it's
[1:22:36] it's like a video
[1:22:38] even moves and
[1:22:40] you see the sparks and you can hear it
[1:22:42] because i feel no warm
[1:22:45] a lot of times people say they're
[1:22:47] christian they got the holy ghost but
[1:22:49] you feel no
[1:22:50] warm no warmth
[1:22:56] i don't know what message that is but it
[1:22:58] is not the message that we heard from
[1:23:00] the beginning
[1:23:03] we got to stay with the message
[1:23:05] to love one another amen
[1:23:10] our enemies should be feeling the warmth
[1:23:12] they should be
[1:23:16] think about it you're in such a control
[1:23:18] tower that you will hold back your love
[1:23:21] from somebody what does that tell you
[1:23:23] tells you god's not in control but you
[1:23:25] are
[1:23:26] because if god had his way in your body
[1:23:28] you would be loving unconditionally no
[1:23:31] matter what they did i don't care if
[1:23:32] they slapped your face taught behind
[1:23:34] your back stabbed you it don't matter
[1:23:37] it's god in you still loving them amen
[1:23:40] and if ain't happening seek more of the
[1:23:42] holy ghost
[1:23:47] by this
[1:23:48] uh but he said in verse 13 but he that
[1:23:50] shall endure to the end
[1:23:52] the same shall be saved
[1:23:55] and the way to endure through all the
[1:23:56] garbage that we're living in today is to
[1:23:58] remain in love with god it's a simple
[1:24:00] thing
[1:24:01] but you got to remain in love it's got
[1:24:02] to be your first and most motive
[1:24:07] jesus said the way that we remain there
[1:24:09] is to remain to keep his commandments
[1:24:12] right if you keep my commandments you
[1:24:14] shall abide in my
[1:24:16] love even as i kept my father's
[1:24:18] commandments therefore i'm abiding in
[1:24:20] his love the commandments are important
[1:24:23] but too often spirits will convince
[1:24:26] believers
[1:24:28] that they can still do what they want
[1:24:29] and abide in god's love it starts with
[1:24:32] that thought in their head
[1:24:35] i'll say these these spirits fascinate
[1:24:38] believers by falsely representing that
[1:24:41] they are the holy ghost inside of them
[1:24:44] they are the inspiration of the holy
[1:24:46] ghost
[1:24:48] and they won't back up their actions
[1:24:50] with the word
[1:24:52] lord help us
[1:24:54] galatians chapter three verse one oh
[1:24:55] foolish galatians who have bewitched you
[1:24:58] that you should not obey the truth
[1:25:03] i say this persuasion hasn't come from
[1:25:05] above it's from below
[1:25:10] if you keep my commandments you shall
[1:25:12] abide in my love
[1:25:15] now jesus isn't just referring to the
[1:25:17] ten commandments or just certain things
[1:25:21] but all the commandments
[1:25:25] what has jesus been commanding you
[1:25:27] brother
[1:25:28] sister let me just ask you can you
[1:25:30] identify what jesus has been commanding
[1:25:33] you
[1:25:37] what's he been command you lately see
[1:25:40] we've got tumors that generality i'm
[1:25:42] just trying to do everything i can just
[1:25:43] do be the best christian i can be
[1:25:49] let's identify has he spoken to us
[1:25:53] what has he commanded
[1:25:56] god is not the author of confusion he
[1:25:58] works with us as individuals on things
[1:26:01] in our lives amen that's right amen
[1:26:05] and we should be able to identify what
[1:26:07] those are because of our relationship
[1:26:10] you know we all want to say god told me
[1:26:12] this and god told me that and god showed
[1:26:14] me this thing god showed me that well
[1:26:15] can you tell me what god's telling you
[1:26:17] to do in your life
[1:26:19] and not right now i can't but i tell
[1:26:22] everything else
[1:26:25] it's just it's
[1:26:27] we don't even recognize a lot of times
[1:26:30] there's spirits that speak to us
[1:26:34] but can we personally identify what he's
[1:26:36] been commanding us to do
[1:26:43] i don't want some
[1:26:44] i'm just generality
[1:26:47] that if you give me a generality you're
[1:26:50] telling me that your relationship is
[1:26:51] just general
[1:26:53] just a general christian just generally
[1:26:55] trying to do my best and generally just
[1:26:58] you know trying to help whoever i can
[1:27:00] help and you know
[1:27:02] general
[1:27:04] god don't want a general relationship
[1:27:08] he wants an intimate relationship
[1:27:11] something specific
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:16] something like job
[1:27:19] have you considered my servant job
[1:27:21] there's none like him
[1:27:25] does everything i tell him to do
[1:27:28] he'll stay he'll abide with me
[1:27:33] oh satan no he won't just you know
[1:27:35] do this do that you know he'll just
[1:27:38] he'll be he'll cut himself off from the
[1:27:40] relationship with you he'll curse you
[1:27:46] don't think there's not a spiritual
[1:27:48] battle going on
[1:27:53] we got to be so in love with god that
[1:27:56] nothing can separate us amen
[1:27:58] now these are important questions to
[1:28:00] abiding in his love
[1:28:03] when he commands us to do something we
[1:28:05] don't want to be thoughtful lazy about
[1:28:07] it we don't want to be it's not that big
[1:28:08] a thing it's not the most important
[1:28:11] we can't have that attitude
[1:28:13] when he tells us to do something we've
[1:28:16] got to have that that respect
[1:28:20] we've got to we've got to have that
[1:28:22] godly fear about what he's spoken we've
[1:28:24] got to put forth some effort
[1:28:29] he expects us to follow through
[1:28:33] god is never going to let your
[1:28:35] relationship just sit around
[1:28:38] god doesn't have any sit around
[1:28:40] relationships
[1:28:42] it's it's always active
[1:28:45] it's always keep moving forward
[1:28:47] even in the middle of a trial
[1:28:49] tell the children of israel to move
[1:28:51] forward
[1:28:52] i'm with you go through go forward
[1:28:56] don't make excuses why you're not
[1:28:59] being strong for the lord today why
[1:29:00] you're not having that burning that love
[1:29:03] to reach out for your soul don't make
[1:29:05] any excuses
[1:29:08] god is not wasteful
[1:29:10] he doesn't let his relationships just
[1:29:12] deteriorate
[1:29:15] he does his part
[1:29:17] we've got to do our part
[1:29:22] he wants us to keep growing day deeper
[1:29:24] deeper in the love of jesus as the song
[1:29:26] goes jude chapter 1 verse 17
[1:29:30] now
[1:29:33] my
[1:29:35] i
[1:29:36] i am halfway there i can just stop
[1:29:40] i suppose i could just stop but i don't
[1:29:41] want to stop
[1:29:49] you know taking a vote never works
[1:29:52] it never works
[1:29:54] no one
[1:29:56] is
[1:29:58] it works for one person
[1:30:00] it works for the person who really wants
[1:30:02] the word and they want to keep preaching
[1:30:04] other than that it don't work for
[1:30:06] anybody else
