[34:58] now we we're going to have communion
[35:01] today I just want to share a little bit
[35:04] about my heart about communion
[35:08] um
[35:09] there in my heart I desire everybody to
[35:12] be in communion
[35:13] come on
[35:15] and my
[35:17] my thoughts were
[35:19] um
[35:20] that we'd have more people on Sunday
[35:22] morning
[35:24] that could have communion then on
[35:26] Wednesday
[35:28] just Naturally Speaking more people come
[35:30] on on Sundays plus it's harder for some
[35:32] to not drive at night
[35:35] I also had a desire to have communion
[35:38] before Brother Bruce went into surgery
[35:41] and then I wanted to have wanted to wait
[35:43] till brother Ron got back from his
[35:46] vacation and so you see I know my heart
[35:49] was just wanting us all to be together
[35:55] um
[35:56] but
[35:57] it I believe it is pleasing to the Lord
[36:01] to to have it in the evening the time it
[36:05] should be and and to to make it to to
[36:10] have as many make it as they can now if
[36:12] someone really really wants to come and
[36:14] you want to ride well
[36:16] between brother Mark and I we got a
[36:19] couple Brothers brother Ron he lifted
[36:20] his hand he's willing to come pick
[36:22] anybody up
[36:23] so if you want to be here and but you
[36:27] can't you want to ride we can make that
[36:29] happen amen
[36:31] um communion is important so I just
[36:34] wanted to share my heart why we changed
[36:36] it

[36:39] service here to to refresh and some
[36:42] really needs to to to to learn about

[37:08] bringing us into fellowship with you
[37:11] and this morning Lord as we enter into
[37:13] the scriptures many things can be said
[37:15] about communion

[37:42] confusions and whether somebody's worthy
[37:44] or not to take it and and Lord that you

[38:08] start with verse 25 of Matthew 27.
[38:13] and this is just uh going through the
[38:18] actual crucifixion uh a a Calvary and
[38:24] and because this is what communion is
[38:27] all about sorry what verse 25 then
[38:30] answered all the people and said his
[38:33] blood be upon us and upon our children
[38:35] and then they released
[38:38] Barabbas unto them and when he had
[38:41] scourged Jesus he delivered him to be
[38:44] crucified then the soldiers of the
[38:47] governor took Jesus into the common Hall
[38:50] and gathered unto him the whole band of
[38:53] soldiers imagine this put yourself right
[38:55] there and they stripped him they put him
[38:58] on a Scarlet robe on him and when they
[39:00] had plated a crown of thorns they put it
[39:03] upon his head and read in his right hand
[39:06] and they bowed the knee before him and
[39:10] mocked him
[39:11] saying hail King of the Jews and they
[39:14] spit on them took a read and smold him
[39:17] on the head
[39:18] and after that they had mocked him and
[39:22] took the robe off from him and put his
[39:25] own Remnant on him and led him away
[39:28] to crucify him
[39:31] verse that's dropped down to verse 45.
[39:36] now the sixth hour
[39:38] now from the sixth hour there was
[39:40] Darkness over all the land unto the
[39:44] ninth hour
[39:46] is very similar to one in Egypt now and
[39:50] about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
[39:54] loud voice saying Eli Eli Lama
[39:59] Sabah
[40:02] tatini and I'm sorry can I not pronounce
[40:04] it that is to say my God my God why has
[40:08] Thou forsaken mean verse 40 Jesus when
[40:12] he had cried again with a love voice
[40:14] yielded up the Holy Ghost amen God bless
[40:18] you may be seated
[40:20] we want to entitle this message
[40:22] remembering Calvary
[40:25] remembering Calvary and for a subject
[40:28] entering into fellowship with the
[40:30] sufferings of Christ
[40:33] entering in to fellowship with the
[40:36] sufferings of Christ now we want to keep
[40:38] it simple today we want to stay with the
[40:40] word
[40:41] we we do not believe like some Churches
[40:44] believe when they take the bread they
[40:46] think it turns into the literal Body of
[40:49] Christ and it does not
[40:51] we want to keep it simple stay with the
[40:53] word it is a representation of Christ
[40:56] being broken on our behalf that we might
[40:59] uh that we would that door would be open
[41:02] that the Holy Ghost could come into our
[41:04] soul
[41:08] now we probably should have heard some
[41:10] more amens on that but hopefully as we
[41:12] go on through the service we'll be able
[41:14] to see them
[41:16] communion takes place
[41:18] brother Brandon says when two parties
[41:20] are talking to one another we can't
[41:22] communicate with the TV we can't
[41:24] communicate with a radio but we can
[41:27] communicate on a telephone one with
[41:29] another face to face
[41:32] communion isn't when one person does all
[41:35] the talking right amen that's right
[41:38] well the Branham said in the message
[41:39] communion he said so really the real
[41:42] communion is the holy spirit speaking
[41:44] back
[41:45] when you ask him and he speaks back this
[41:49] is correct communion
[41:51] is being associated with something
[41:53] that's talking back to you
[41:56] in the message remembering the Lord
[41:58] Brother Brandon said then as we come to
[42:00] the table of the Lord the table of the
[42:01] Lord as I've explained it before is the
[42:04] taking of the bread we place the right
[42:07] thing in the wrong place
[42:10] it isn't the bread that matters
[42:13] it isn't the wine that matters
[42:16] that's just the kosher bread and the
[42:17] wine but the thing that is communion
[42:21] means to talk to
[42:23] and talking to him remembering him
[42:28] I think it's the most blessed time of
[42:31] the services see every hour of our life
[42:34] ought to be a communion
[42:37] A communion's continuing to quote a
[42:40] communion with the Lord is like an oasis
[42:43] in the desert it's like the spring
[42:45] underneath the pond it's a is when a
[42:48] traveler comes by he stops and drinks of
[42:50] the water until he quenches his thirst
[42:52] that's remembering the Lord amen
[42:56] God wants us to remember
[42:59] him in communion what he done for us
[43:02] it's not a one-sided ritual where we
[43:04] just come in and do this thing right
[43:07] right neither it is and about us asking
[43:10] the Lord for all the things that we want
[43:12] or that we need or that we desire
[43:15] but it's about our personal relationship
[43:18] with Christ
[43:18] [Music]
[43:20] amen God wants to have communion with us
[43:22] on the basis of his will for our lives
[43:26] that's what he wants communion to be for
[43:29] so we want to ask him where
[43:34] we're not pleasing him the way that we
[43:37] need to
[43:38] that that needs to be done
[43:42] because to whom much is given much is
[43:44] required you know we're so used and I
[43:47] say like this our flesh is so used to
[43:49] coming to church hearing the word and
[43:51] doing what you still want to do that's
[43:53] true that's called iniquity
[43:56] and they that name the name of the Lord
[43:58] let him depart from iniquity so we need
[44:01] to take the word of the Lord more
[44:03] serious amen
[44:07] we need to learn to wait upon the Lord
[44:11] now this communion is about what Christ
[44:13] did for us and the effect that it has on
[44:17] our personal lives in our relationship
[44:21] I'm going to give you the John Martin
[44:22] definition of communion
[44:24] communion is entering into fellowship
[44:26] with the sufferings of Christ
[44:30] that's what it really is and that's why
[44:33] it's it's such a a sobering moment if I
[44:36] was to ask
[44:38] and and just try to be as honest as you
[44:41] can in this statement with me I'm going
[44:42] to ask you a question
[44:44] what do you think about when I say or
[44:48] when you hear it's time we're going to
[44:50] have communion what's the first thing
[44:52] you think about
[44:54] huh
[44:56] coming together okay there's no wrong
[44:57] answer I just want to hear
[44:59] huh
[45:01] across okay
[45:04] under the Lord okay okay yes
[45:08] getting your heart right that is that is
[45:10] that's that's the first thing I think
[45:13] about I think about am I ready for
[45:16] communion
[45:17] because I just
[45:24] because he died for me
[45:28] and he's he's asked me to give my life
[45:31] to him
[45:33] and have I really done that with
[45:35] everything that's within me well
[45:37] communion brings us to that table
[45:40] and it calls us to evaluate ourselves in
[45:45] our relationship with Christ and I'm
[45:47] telling you when we take communion it
[45:50] should bring us closer to God and closer
[45:52] to one another
[45:54] that's what true communion does
[45:57] it's not a time we come together and
[45:59] have a ritual and just think oh yeah my
[46:01] relationship is okay with God it's just
[46:03] going to be a ritual and that's not it
[46:09] and I in my opinion I believe Calvary is
[46:12] the greatest pivoting point in the
[46:15] history of humanity amen yes sir brother
[46:19] Andrew brought us
[46:21] he brought us brought a point out to us
[46:24] how Lucifer
[46:26] it was right next to Jesus
[46:28] and watched every detail about Jesus so
[46:31] he knows all his characteristics
[46:34] and and knows exactly how to mimic
[46:38] everything right
[46:40] and he knows all all about him and I
[46:43] just believe he brought out some mighty
[46:45] great things but there were some things
[46:47] that were completely hid from Lucifer
[46:50] amen
[46:51] amen he never seen Jesus redeem anybody
[46:54] in heaven
[46:56] he never seen Jesus save anybody in
[46:58] heaven he never seen anybody he never
[47:01] seen Jesus heal anybody in heaven or
[47:03] restore anybody because it never
[47:06] happened in heaven so he couldn't see it
[47:08] right
[47:11] it took a Man created in God's Own image
[47:15] to Fall From Grace
[47:17] to be restored back into Fellowship
[47:19] again
[47:21] see Satan never seen how great God's
[47:24] mercy really was until until the
[47:28] understanding came of what Calvary was
[47:31] all about
[47:32] course it was hid from them at the
[47:34] beginning or else he wouldn't ever
[47:35] allowed it
[47:37] but after he starts seeing all these
[47:39] people change all sudden their nature
[47:42] that they were born with all sudden they
[47:45] weren't having that nature or anything
[47:46] their eyes came open that it was God
[47:49] coming back into human flesh again
[47:52] see Satan never seen how great a love
[47:56] wherewith he loved us and changed our
[47:58] lives
[48:03] communion is not just about remembering
[48:06] Calvary
[48:08] it's about entering into the fellowship
[48:10] with the sufferings of Christ at Calvary
[48:14] Paul said in Philippians 3 10 that I
[48:17] might know him and the power of his
[48:21] resurrection
[48:22] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[48:27] being made conformable unto his death
[48:31] see it is we've got to if we do not pick
[48:34] up our cross we do not deny ourselves
[48:36] you might as well kick out your religion
[48:39] because
[48:41] it's not Christianity Christianity is
[48:44] dying out to yourself that Christ may
[48:45] live inside of you
[48:48] so we've got to know Christ in The
[48:50] Fellowship of his sufferings being made
[48:52] conformable unto his death if by any
[48:55] means if by any means I might attain to
[48:57] the resurrection of the Dead
[49:02] God not only wants us to remember the
[49:05] sufferings of Christ until he comes
[49:08] but he wants us to remember when we're
[49:12] in heaven
[49:14] because there will be scars on his hands
[49:17] for us to remember what he did see
[49:20] Calvary is the pivoting point of the of
[49:23] of of history of humanity
[49:26] everything pointed to it
[49:28] and our whole salvation is based on it
[49:31] and when we get to heaven we will be
[49:34] casting ours
[49:35] our crowns down we will be shouting
[49:38] Glory Glory Thou Art Worthy you paid the
[49:41] price that I could be here today it's
[49:44] all about Calvary
[49:50] personally
[49:51] we were all separated from God
[49:54] and he made a way back for us
[49:58] everything points to Calvary
[50:05] God displayed eternal life
[50:08] to mankind
[50:10] and Calvary
[50:12] he displayed it for God so loved the
[50:15] world that he gave
[50:17] it was the manifestation of God's love
[50:21] although the whole world was blind to it
[50:25] it's so so blind even his own disciples
[50:28] scattered what's going on
[50:34] that's why we should never give up if we
[50:36] don't understand something
[50:39] we don't understand doesn't make it not
[50:41] real
[50:42] does it not make it not true but what we
[50:44] got to do is learn to wait on the Lord
[50:46] amen
[50:47] everything points to Calvary
[50:50] Calvary was in the mind of God before
[50:52] there was ever a world
[50:54] First Peter 1 19 says that when we were
[50:57] redeemed we were redeemed with the
[50:59] precious blood of Christ as of the Lamb
[51:01] without blemish and without spot who
[51:03] verily was foreordained before the
[51:06] foundation of the world so see think
[51:09] about this this great attribute was in
[51:12] the mind of God before there was ever a
[51:14] world
[51:15] there was something in him that wanted
[51:17] to express
[51:20] his redeeming qualities How Great Is Our
[51:23] God Amen How great is our God
[51:30] it was first revealed
[51:33] or record it if I could say it in
[51:35] Genesis 3 15 that the seed of God would
[51:38] make such a Blow To The Head of Lucifer
[51:40] that nothing could stop God's seed from
[51:43] coming forth
[51:46] amen Satan took over the whole Earth but
[51:48] the seed of God is still going to come
[51:51] forth in Revelations 13 8 the Bible says
[51:53] all that dwelleth upon the Earth shall
[51:55] worship Him whose name are not written
[51:58] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[52:01] from the foundation of the world if any
[52:04] man have an ear let him hear
[52:08] so this
[52:10] everything pointed to Calvary
[52:13] everything points to Calvary
[52:17] even Paul said for I determine not to
[52:20] know anything among you save Jesus
[52:22] Christ and him crucified that's where he
[52:25] put his mind and his thoughts
[52:30] Calvary is where he brought us back to
[52:33] him
[52:34] Calvary is now where he can say you are
[52:37] bought with a price you're not your own
[52:40] you belong to Christ amen
[52:44] we need to keep our minds more in
[52:46] Calvary
[52:48] on the price he paid on the suffering he
[52:51] surrendered himself to do
[52:53] Jesus said therefore doth my father love
[52:55] me because I lay down my life for the
[52:58] Sheep
[53:01] if you would let's turn with me to
[53:05] um Isaiah chapter 53 just this great
[53:08] recording I think it Bears witness
[53:10] reading I don't know it's a familiar
[53:12] scripture
[53:14] Isaiah 53 just remembering Calvary look
[53:18] verse 1
[53:19] who have believed our report and to whom
[53:21] is the arm of the Lord revealed for he
[53:24] shall grow up before him as a tender
[53:27] plan and as a root out of the dry ground
[53:29] he have no form of comeliness and when
[53:33] we shall see him there's no beauty that
[53:34] we should desire him imagine that when
[53:36] we talk to one another
[53:39] you know
[53:40] when we meet somebody
[53:42] when we talk to somebody give her order
[53:44] at Tim Hortons and then we go up to the
[53:46] window and we're surprised that they
[53:47] look like that
[53:49] you know what I'm saying they got this
[53:51] voice like this but then you see him and
[53:53] they go whoa is that what I imagined it
[53:54] to be well
[53:58] Jesus don't want to appear as something
[54:01] That's mighty on the outside because
[54:04] he's not trying to attract our flesh
[54:07] our Flesh and Blood our flesh is not
[54:10] going to inherit the Kingdom it's that
[54:12] Soul that's inside so the inside of
[54:14] Christ is speaking to the inside of us
[54:18] there's a deep calling to the Deep amen
[54:22] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[54:26] of Sorrows acquainted with griefs and we
[54:29] hit him and we hid as it were our faces
[54:32] from him
[54:33] he was despised
[54:36] and we esteemed enough I want you to put
[54:37] yourself in these scriptures surely he
[54:41] bore our Greeks and he carried ourselves
[54:42] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[54:46] of God and afflicted
[54:48] he was wounded for John Martin's
[54:52] transgressions
[54:53] he was bruised for her iniquities the
[54:56] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[54:58] and with his stripes we are healed amen
[55:03] how grateful we all to be
[55:06] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[55:09] have turned everyone to his own ways and
[55:12] the Lord had laid upon him the iniquity
[55:15] of us all
[55:18] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[55:21] yet he opened not his mouth he didn't
[55:24] have any regrets and he didn't fight
[55:26] back and he didn't say you know you
[55:28] shouldn't be doing this
[55:30] his heart was on you
[55:32] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[55:35] as the Sheep before the shears is dumb
[55:37] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[55:40] from prison and from the Judgment who
[55:42] shall declare his generation for he was
[55:45] cut off out of the land of the living
[55:47] for the transgressions of my people was
[55:49] he stricken
[55:51] and he made his grave with the wicked
[55:54] and with the rich in his death because
[55:56] he had done no violence neither was any
[56:00] deceit in his mouth
[56:02] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[56:07] he had put him to grief
[56:11] when thou shall make his soul see here
[56:15] it is his soul in offering for sin
[56:19] he shall see his seeds praise God he
[56:22] shall prolong his days and the pleasure
[56:24] of the Lord shall prosper in his hand
[56:27] and he shall see the travail of his soul
[56:29] and and shall be satisfied by his
[56:31] knowledge and shall my righteous servant
[56:34] justify many
[56:36] for he shall bear their iniquities
[56:40] amen therefore I divide him a portion
[56:44] amen I will divide him a portion with
[56:49] the great and he shall divide the spoil
[56:53] with the strong because he have poured
[56:55] out his soul unto death and and he was
[57:00] numbered with the transgressors and he
[57:02] bear the sin of many and made the
[57:04] intercession for the transgressors
[57:08] he divided himself for us
[57:12] we have a portion of God inside of us
[57:16] because of what he did at Calvary
[57:26] everything points to Calvary
[57:29] brother Brandon said in the message
[57:30] communion 57 he said that communion
[57:34] was held first way down in Egypt
[57:39] the first communion
[57:41] the children of Israel if you want to
[57:43] turn their Exodus chapter 12 we're going
[57:44] to read some scriptures there the
[57:46] children of Israel in the land of
[57:48] bondage we're to take a lamb slay it
[57:51] apply the blood eat it
[57:53] and this lamb was to be without blemish
[57:56] just like Jesus Christ was without
[57:58] blemish but you know his bride is going
[58:02] to be without blemish without spots and
[58:05] without blemish and I'll tell you it
[58:07] takes not just the covering of our sins
[58:10] for that but it takes the Life of Christ
[58:14] Living inside of human flesh again
[58:17] pressing towards that Mark
[58:20] you know I understand that
[58:24] we can only do so much
[58:27] living the life of a holy person I
[58:30] understand that
[58:31] but why do we limit God because of our
[58:35] unbelief
[58:37] why don't we just spend more time with
[58:39] God and say God would you fill me with
[58:41] more of you because I know you can live
[58:44] the life Lord
[58:46] why do we want to take Church such a a
[58:49] separate part from the life
[58:52] this is where we come to get life
[58:54] amen this is where we come to receive
[58:56] the revelation of Christ
[58:59] that we can take it out and live it
[59:01] because this is what communion is all
[59:04] about
[59:06] Exodus chapter 12 verse number 7 says
[59:09] and they shall take of the blood and
[59:12] strike it on the two side poles and the
[59:15] upper door pulse to the of the houses
[59:18] wherein they shall eat it
[59:21] notice they eat the lamb inside the
[59:24] house now
[59:28] what's inside your house is a soul
[59:33] and that is where you eat Christ amen
[59:37] that's where you receive the word
[59:41] that's where you come
[59:43] communion is in the soul not the flesh
[59:48] now
[59:50] your soul eats the lamb
[59:53] but
[59:55] the blood is applied on the outside
[59:58] so that the whole world can see the Life
[1:00:01] of Christ what's inside of your soul
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:07] and that's why I made mention that you
[1:00:09] don't have to tell anybody you got the
[1:00:11] Holy Ghost it is on display
[1:00:16] for the whole world to see
[1:00:22] but if you're having to convince
[1:00:25] feeling you're having to convince I say
[1:00:28] this spend more time and ask God to fill
[1:00:31] your soul with more of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:33] because you can't help to Bubble it out
[1:00:36] it can't help to come out
[1:00:39] let's drop down to verse 10 and ye shall
[1:00:42] let nothing of it remain unto the
[1:00:45] morning
[1:00:46] and that which remaineth of it until the
[1:00:50] morning ye shall burn it with fire
[1:00:55] and thus shall you eat it with your
[1:00:58] loins gerd your shoes on your feet your
[1:01:00] staff in your hand you shall eat it in
[1:01:02] haste it is the Lord's Passover
[1:01:06] in other words this is a serious
[1:01:09] situation we're leaving that Egypt we're
[1:01:12] leaving this world Amen we're going in a
[1:01:15] rapture
[1:01:17] amen it's the Lord's Passover
[1:01:23] Pride will pass through the land of
[1:01:25] Egypt this night and will Smite all the
[1:01:26] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[1:01:29] and Beast and against all the gods of
[1:01:31] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[1:01:34] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:01:36] token upon the houses where ye are and
[1:01:40] when I when I notice who has to really
[1:01:43] see the blood when I see the blood I
[1:01:46] will pass over you
[1:01:49] God is demanding to see the Life of
[1:01:52] Christ
[1:01:53] all over us
[1:01:56] he's got to see it so it doesn't matter
[1:01:58] what we do in front of one another
[1:02:01] doesn't matter what we try to put
[1:02:04] peacock feathers on or actors certain
[1:02:06] way we've we've got to have that blood
[1:02:09] applied in the sight of God at all times
[1:02:13] I will pass over you and the plague
[1:02:15] shall not be upon you to destroy you
[1:02:17] when I smite the land of Egypt and this
[1:02:20] day shall be here it is then this day
[1:02:22] shall be unto you for a memorial
[1:02:26] not a ritual but a memorial
[1:02:30] that ye shall keep it a feast to the
[1:02:34] Lord throughout your generations and ye
[1:02:36] shall keep it a feast by an ordinance
[1:02:39] forever
[1:02:43] forever
[1:02:47] now we can take any one of these and
[1:02:50] really dive into it but we we just have
[1:02:53] a lot of ground to cover so we're
[1:02:56] obviously we're missing saying certain
[1:02:59] things but I want to stand the subject
[1:03:01] brother Brian said the message questions
[1:03:02] and answers 59 it he cannot issue taking
[1:03:06] communion and turn around and say
[1:03:09] there's no need to take it
[1:03:11] he says you've got to do it it's an
[1:03:14] order forever with God
[1:03:18] so we've got to take communion
[1:03:20] we don't want to be in a spot where
[1:03:23] well you know I just not doing real good
[1:03:26] and I don't think I should take no you
[1:03:28] can't do that what you do if you do that
[1:03:31] you're separating yourself from God
[1:03:35] well brother John I don't want to take
[1:03:37] it and take it unworthily so so I can't
[1:03:40] take it know what you need to do is you
[1:03:43] need to get right and take communion
[1:03:44] that is not an excuse you're separating
[1:03:47] yourself from God Amen
[1:03:51] you separate yourself from God it's just
[1:03:54] the same thing
[1:03:58] when the blood's not applied you've got
[1:04:00] to apply that blood to your life
[1:04:02] you just got to
[1:04:06] the Lord's Passover is a very serious
[1:04:08] thing
[1:04:09] imagine each one of you having a
[1:04:11] firstborn
[1:04:12] is going to die
[1:04:14] if you didn't take and kill a lamb
[1:04:18] apply the blood and eat that lamb in in
[1:04:20] the house you ever put yourself in this
[1:04:23] position
[1:04:26] now every one of us
[1:04:28] was a firstborn
[1:04:31] every one of us was the first I don't
[1:04:34] care where you were born in category you
[1:04:36] were born a firstborn
[1:04:39] we all must take Christ The Life of
[1:04:43] Christ into our soul and let him change
[1:04:45] our nature into the Life of Christ or
[1:04:49] the death angel is is not going to pass
[1:04:52] over us
[1:04:56] God has provided
[1:04:58] a chance
[1:05:00] to pass over us
[1:05:03] we've got to take
[1:05:05] the blood we've got to
[1:05:08] take the the meat of God's word no
[1:05:12] matter what he speaks to us to me it's
[1:05:13] meat
[1:05:14] because Jesus said my meat is to do the
[1:05:16] will of him that sent me and when God
[1:05:19] speaks to you I don't care how small it
[1:05:21] is how great it is that's God's meat
[1:05:23] being given to you you must take it you
[1:05:25] must eat it amen
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:28] Jesus said we must be born again or we
[1:05:33] cannot enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:05:37] that nature change has to come
[1:05:40] we must have a nature change
[1:05:44] it's not some intellectual understanding
[1:05:46] of Calvary right it's not some carnal
[1:05:49] ritual of communion
[1:05:51] we must receive the very Life of Christ
[1:05:54] into our nature
[1:05:57] and that life must be on display in
[1:06:00] order to escape the oncoming judgment
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:05] brother Branham said many people
[1:06:07] take communion who will die and will not
[1:06:11] make it
[1:06:16] I just really don't care
[1:06:21] about what does that matter
[1:06:23] who we fake out
[1:06:25] who we're trying to impress
[1:06:28] we need the Life of Christ manifested
[1:06:31] that can only come
[1:06:34] from him living in our souls
[1:06:36] because
[1:06:38] here's the thing we all could get the
[1:06:40] Life of Christ anointing our flesh doing
[1:06:44] great marvelous things and obviously
[1:06:46] that isn't us that's Christ but that
[1:06:49] what doesn't mean it's ever going to
[1:06:50] change in nature
[1:06:52] are you with me
[1:06:55] so we're not looking to the outside
[1:06:58] some manifestations
[1:07:00] for a period of time
[1:07:03] and say I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:06] the Holy Ghost is a nature change
[1:07:10] you're not selfish anymore
[1:07:13] it's not about you anymore you live for
[1:07:17] others you don't have respect to persons
[1:07:20] you don't you're not ill towards
[1:07:22] somebody
[1:07:23] we're talking about the very nature
[1:07:25] that's inside that's on display with
[1:07:27] what you do with your time
[1:07:30] see Satan has deceived a lot of people
[1:07:36] true with me if you would to John
[1:07:37] chapter 6. Jesus shared this message
[1:07:40] with Nicodemus and his disciples and the
[1:07:42] Jews that followed him this this great
[1:07:45] message that you need a nature change
[1:07:48] you must be born again
[1:07:51] and the only way we can do it is through
[1:07:53] Christ starting with verse 52 and the
[1:07:55] Jews therefore strove among themselves
[1:07:57] saying how can this man give us his
[1:08:01] flesh to eat that was the question
[1:08:06] how can it be
[1:08:07] Nicodemus said how can I enter into
[1:08:10] my mother's womb again be born again
[1:08:14] so we need our spiritual thinking caps
[1:08:16] when we come to church
[1:08:20] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[1:08:22] I say to you except ye eat the Flesh of
[1:08:25] the son of man and drink his blood you
[1:08:28] have no life in you
[1:08:34] many will come to me in that day
[1:08:40] I want the Life of Christ I don't really
[1:08:42] care about anything I don't care why
[1:08:44] anybody looks at me thinks about me I
[1:08:47] don't mean it wrong but if I don't have
[1:08:49] that life in me nothing else matters
[1:08:54] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:08:57] blood have eternal life and I will raise
[1:09:00] them up at the last day for my flesh is
[1:09:02] meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
[1:09:05] he that eareth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:09:08] blood here it is
[1:09:10] dwelleth in me
[1:09:12] and I in him
[1:09:15] now do you see where the spirit of God
[1:09:18] could come upon somebody and anoint them
[1:09:20] to all get out and yet they not be in
[1:09:23] Christ
[1:09:30] now we know this is not some natural
[1:09:32] cannibalism
[1:09:34] right
[1:09:36] communion is not
[1:09:39] naturally eating the body and drinking
[1:09:42] the blood by some sort of thinking that
[1:09:45] is happening when you're doing it
[1:09:48] it's a representation of Christ being
[1:09:50] broken on our behalf that we could
[1:09:53] receive his Spirit into our soul and
[1:09:56] have the true communion
[1:09:58] because see God is a spirit and they
[1:10:02] that worship me must worship me not in
[1:10:05] your mind
[1:10:06] not carnally
[1:10:08] but in spirit and in truth that's the
[1:10:12] fellowship that he's looking for that's
[1:10:14] why we you know we can come to church a
[1:10:17] lot of times and just pop in and pop out
[1:10:19] nothing really goes on
[1:10:20] but I'm telling you true communion with
[1:10:22] the Lord is you've got to get in
[1:10:24] Fellowship he talks he talks you listen
[1:10:27] you talk back you respond yes God I will
[1:10:31] do what you tell me to do I'm having
[1:10:33] communion with you
[1:10:35] man
[1:10:38] Jesus said the words that I speak unto
[1:10:41] you they are Spirit they are life the
[1:10:44] flesh profiteth nothing
[1:10:46] I say natural communion Prophet nothing
[1:10:51] it's just like
[1:10:53] getting baptized
[1:10:55] without any change in Direction in your
[1:10:58] heart you go down a sinner you come up a
[1:11:00] sinner
[1:11:02] it is the spirit that quickeneth amen
[1:11:05] the spirit that's why we need the spirit
[1:11:07] of the word
[1:11:10] now when you receive the spirit of
[1:11:12] Christ the word you're actually eating
[1:11:15] spiritually
[1:11:16] come to the house of God every time
[1:11:18] these doors are open to feed upon the
[1:11:20] word of God
[1:11:21] we have precious opportunities to
[1:11:24] commune with the word of God as as he
[1:11:28] speaks to us we respond back with a amen
[1:11:31] so be it in my life Lord amen
[1:11:35] eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:11:37] drink his blood he that eateth my flesh
[1:11:40] and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and
[1:11:44] now I in him the only way that Christ
[1:11:48] could be in US is through his word
[1:11:53] The Living Word is the Holy Ghost are
[1:11:56] you with me
[1:11:57] right we can go to a seminary spend five
[1:12:01] years in the Seminary and know less
[1:12:03] about God than when we first went in
[1:12:05] there because when we first went in
[1:12:07] there there was a yearning God I want to
[1:12:09] know you when we come out oh we just
[1:12:11] think we're something
[1:12:13] we're further away
[1:12:18] John Chapter 14 verse 20. at that day
[1:12:22] John 14 20 at that day you shall know
[1:12:25] that I am in the father and you and me
[1:12:27] and I and you
[1:12:29] and he that hath my Commandments and
[1:12:32] keepeth them here it is the word
[1:12:34] becoming real to us
[1:12:36] he it is that loveth me and he that
[1:12:39] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[1:12:40] and I will love him and will manifest
[1:12:44] myself to him
[1:12:48] there's that life
[1:12:51] Judas saith unto him not ascariot Lord
[1:12:54] how is it that thou will manifest
[1:12:56] thyself unto us and then not unto others
[1:13:01] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[1:13:04] man loved me it's where the criteria
[1:13:07] starts right there
[1:13:09] he will keep my words
[1:13:12] and my father will love him
[1:13:15] and will come unto him
[1:13:18] and make our Abode with him
[1:13:25] communion starts
[1:13:28] with love
[1:13:31] we've got to love God
[1:13:34] you can't have a relationship with God
[1:13:37] without you loving God Amen
[1:13:40] amen God is not going to be some Tyrant
[1:13:43] that places
[1:13:46] his will Upon Our us when we really
[1:13:50] would rather just do what our flesh
[1:13:52] wants to do
[1:13:54] are you with me
[1:13:56] so that's what I'm saying we need to
[1:13:58] cultivate love yes
[1:14:00] things
[1:14:01] that build off of love
[1:14:07] we got to get perfect love
[1:14:09] we got to get to the place where we can
[1:14:11] love our enemies
[1:14:13] we got to build amen that ain't gonna
[1:14:15] happen some Christmas gift right
[1:14:18] it's a relationship it's we take service
[1:14:20] seriously when we come to the house of
[1:14:22] God when we pick up our Bible we we
[1:14:25] listen to the tapes we're interested in
[1:14:28] building a love relationship
[1:14:31] and then the manifestation will come yes
[1:14:34] Luke chapter 22 remembering Calvary Luke
[1:14:38] chapter 22.
[1:14:41] I don't often take a sip of water but I
[1:14:44] need water
[1:14:49] are you getting something out of this
[1:14:53] starting with verse 13 and they went and
[1:14:56] found as he had said unto them
[1:14:59] and they made ready the Passover
[1:15:03] and when the hour was come he sat down
[1:15:06] and The Twelve Apostles with him
[1:15:08] and Jesus said unto them with now notice
[1:15:11] this with desire I have desired to eat
[1:15:16] this Passover with you before I suffer
[1:15:23] the Lord's Passover here has to do with
[1:15:28] the sufferings of Christ at Calvary
[1:15:31] so true communion is entering into the
[1:15:34] fellowship with the sufferings of Christ
[1:15:39] no
[1:15:41] he tried telling them
[1:15:43] what's going to happen
[1:15:46] and they didn't want to hear it
[1:15:49] and a lot of times we come to church and
[1:15:51] we don't want to hear that part that
[1:15:53] part of suffering
[1:15:55] that part of laying down your life we
[1:15:57] want to hear something that's
[1:15:58] encouraging and that just picks us up
[1:16:01] I want that too I do it's natural
[1:16:05] but look if you want to have True
[1:16:06] Fellowship with Christ you've got to
[1:16:08] learn to die out to your will
[1:16:10] stall there is to it
[1:16:14] Christ surrendered his will for you
[1:16:18] he said father if it's possible let this
[1:16:20] cup pass from me
[1:16:23] but he said nevertheless not my will but
[1:16:25] thine be done he gave up his will that
[1:16:27] you could have fellowship with him and
[1:16:30] we've got to give up our will to have
[1:16:31] fellowship with him we just got to if we
[1:16:35] don't that's what makes us Unworthy of
[1:16:37] the blood of Christ
[1:16:44] verse 16 for I say unto you I will not
[1:16:47] anymore eat thereof until it be
[1:16:50] fulfilled in the kingdom of God
[1:16:55] look at this
[1:16:57] the Fulfillment happens in the Kingdom
[1:17:03] God still wants us to remember Calvary
[1:17:06] when we're up there I say up there you
[1:17:08] know what I mean in that other dimension
[1:17:10] that's 18
[1:17:11] inches from us
[1:17:15] he wants us to remember he was committed
[1:17:18] to suffering amen amen and his bride
[1:17:21] will be the only ones that's committed
[1:17:24] to suffering because if we do not suffer
[1:17:27] with him we will not reign with him
[1:17:30] we've got to know him in the fellowship
[1:17:33] of his sufferings
[1:17:37] communion
[1:17:39] with him
[1:17:42] is remembering the great love that he
[1:17:45] has towards us that he was willing to
[1:17:48] suffer
[1:17:49] to have that fellowship with us
[1:17:53] this is what communion is verse 17 and
[1:17:56] he took the cup and he gave thanks and
[1:17:58] said take this and divide it among
[1:18:04] yourselves
[1:18:06] now if
[1:18:09] I don't want to take this one because I
[1:18:11] drink out of it
[1:18:13] but I'm going to take this one and if I
[1:18:15] took this I opened it and gave each of
[1:18:18] you a part of this
[1:18:22] would any of you have something
[1:18:24] different than the other one
[1:18:27] it would all be the same
[1:18:31] Same Love
[1:18:36] Same Spirit
[1:18:39] same forgiveness
[1:18:43] this this stuff about well I don't need
[1:18:46] to do that or I don't have to do that or
[1:18:48] you don't know what they did to me you
[1:18:49] know what you're telling me you're not
[1:18:51] partaking of Christ
[1:18:55] because when you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:18:57] will do what the Holy Ghost does
[1:19:00] amen we're trying to be the Holy Ghost
[1:19:03] don't try to be the Holy Ghost say God
[1:19:05] fill me with you you will automatically
[1:19:09] forgive
[1:19:11] love lay down your life and be
[1:19:16] everything that Christ is because you
[1:19:19] you have partook by one Spirit we're all
[1:19:22] baptized into the body of Christ yes
[1:19:28] all right what verse we on here verse
[1:19:31] 18.
[1:19:33] for I say unto you I will not drink
[1:19:35] of the fruit of the vine until it the
[1:19:37] kingdom of God shall come and he took
[1:19:39] the bread and gave thanks and he break
[1:19:42] it
[1:19:43] he break it now this bread that he was
[1:19:46] breaking when he said take this is this
[1:19:50] is uh my body which is broken for you
[1:19:54] that piece of bread that he was breaking
[1:19:57] was not his body
[1:20:00] do you understand that
[1:20:03] it was not his body he didn't transfer
[1:20:06] him to that bread
[1:20:09] it was a representation of him and what
[1:20:12] was going to happen at Calvary
[1:20:17] that when you come together and you
[1:20:19] break bread and you take it
[1:20:21] that that you have a visualization a
[1:20:25] representation a memorial of what
[1:20:27] happened at Calvary
[1:20:30] um
[1:20:33] and he gave unto them saying this is my
[1:20:36] body which is given
[1:20:37] for you
[1:20:39] this do and remember I'll tell you if if
[1:20:42] that bread that he broke was him
[1:20:48] yeah exactly where do we fit in just
[1:20:51] does it make Calvary what it really
[1:20:52] really is
[1:20:55] but we just want to keep it simple right
[1:20:56] stay with the word likewise also the cup
[1:20:59] after supper after supper see
[1:21:03] after supper saying this cup is the New
[1:21:06] Testament in my blood which is shed for
[1:21:08] you but behold the hand of him that
[1:21:12] betrayeth me is with me on the table so
[1:21:15] here he is having communion first and we
[1:21:18] find in Egypt in a mixed multitude and
[1:21:20] here it is communion the Passover
[1:21:23] and he's having it with somebody that's
[1:21:25] unworthy
[1:21:27] are you with me you're gonna have three
[1:21:30] types of Believers in every Church
[1:21:33] you're going to have some taking it that
[1:21:35] that shouldn't be taken it because they
[1:21:37] need to get their heart right first
[1:21:39] amen right
[1:21:40] you just can't do nothing about that but
[1:21:43] what we can do is encourage one another
[1:21:47] right we're a body Ministry we do not
[1:21:49] have to wait to come to the house of God
[1:21:52] to help somebody
[1:21:54] you know you're all disciples what do
[1:21:56] Disciples do they disciple amen
[1:21:59] we're all disciples we need to help one
[1:22:02] another we need to get our hands dirty
[1:22:04] and talk to one another and help one
[1:22:07] another become more what Christ wants
[1:22:09] them to be I believe that
[1:22:11] I believe that with all my heart
[1:22:14] so we're going to talk about preparing
[1:22:16] our hearts for communion just a little
[1:22:19] bit
[1:22:21] communion is sacred
[1:22:24] just like Calvary was sacred
[1:22:26] the brand said in the message
[1:22:28] desperations he says I believe that
[1:22:30] communion is one of the most solemn
[1:22:32] sacred sweetest worships
[1:22:36] that there is in a church service
[1:22:42] he says but there there were three
[1:22:44] things left the Lord's Supper baptism
[1:22:46] foot washing was the three orders that
[1:22:50] was left
[1:22:51] to the church
[1:22:55] God suffered and was broken for the
[1:22:58] whole world
[1:22:59] but the whole world is too proud too
[1:23:02] arrogant to disbelieving to receive it
[1:23:07] but to us he's precious
[1:23:10] he's beautiful
[1:23:12] we have a revelation of what Christ did
[1:23:15] for us
[1:23:17] he redeemed us that we could live
[1:23:19] eternally with him so I say this that we
[1:23:23] need to take communion seriously
[1:23:27] we do not want to take communion just
[1:23:29] because we're supposed to
[1:23:32] or just because we were baptized
[1:23:34] or just because Mom and Dad does
[1:23:38] we don't want to take communion
[1:23:41] with our lives and our attitudes being
[1:23:45] wrong
[1:23:51] I say to the children young believers we
[1:23:54] need to remember this
[1:23:57] if we're old enough to take communion
[1:24:00] we're old enough to suffer the
[1:24:02] consequences of not taking it right
[1:24:06] so we need to take it seriously
[1:24:19] one of the most disheartening things is
[1:24:22] is when how
[1:24:27] imagine a 20 year old coming to Christ
[1:24:31] he says he wants to give up the world
[1:24:34] get baptized
[1:24:36] and he gets baptized repentance rep gets
[1:24:39] baptized and then leaves Church
[1:24:43] that's such a sad thing to me
[1:24:45] what's different about that than a
[1:24:49] a younger child
[1:24:53] doing the same thing
[1:24:56] but his heart isn't here at church
[1:24:59] come on
[1:25:01] come on parents we have a responsibility
[1:25:05] we do now when they reach that age when
[1:25:08] they're going to make their own decision
[1:25:09] that's different
[1:25:12] but until that age we have a re Brothers
[1:25:14] says you are the Holy Ghost to them
[1:25:16] until they get the Holy Ghost
[1:25:21] so they need to be taught all serious
[1:25:23] communion as well
[1:25:26] brother Brian said the message key to
[1:25:28] the door he said so communion is for
[1:25:30] Christians that's born again by the
[1:25:34] spirit of God
[1:25:37] foreign
[1:25:39] again does not necessarily mean now that
[1:25:43] you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:25:48] well this is getting rich
[1:25:52] he says now remember
[1:25:54] many now many
[1:25:57] teach that
[1:26:01] so
[1:26:03] the new birth there's the beginning and
[1:26:06] then there's a growth
[1:26:09] and we've been taught about the tutor
[1:26:12] uh uh be in the Holy Spirit
[1:26:16] when you finally get to the place where
[1:26:18] he can turn to the father and say he is
[1:26:21] ready now to step into his position
[1:26:24] even though he was a a son from the
[1:26:27] beginning he's not able to be in that
[1:26:30] position
[1:26:31] so there's like a growth and so I say to
[1:26:34] you that have repented you that have
[1:26:36] been baptized and you're still wondering
[1:26:38] why things are going on the what what's
[1:26:40] going on in your life you need to press
[1:26:43] into Christ that is your answer there is
[1:26:45] no other answer do not wait and do the
[1:26:48] same thing because if you do you always
[1:26:49] do what you've always done you're always
[1:26:51] going to get what you always got you've
[1:26:53] got to press in more to Christ
[1:26:56] that's what brings the results to a to a
[1:26:59] Christian
[1:27:01] pressing in
[1:27:03] now if you're planning on taking
[1:27:04] communion
[1:27:07] your relationship with Christ the word
[1:27:11] needs to be in order
[1:27:19] that's between you and Christ
[1:27:23] like if you've got a distant
[1:27:24] relationship between you and God there's
[1:27:26] hardly any
[1:27:30] I think you need to spend more time
[1:27:33] to your my sheep hear my voice and they
[1:27:36] follow me
[1:27:40] because
[1:27:41] he doesn't want us coming up and
[1:27:43] haphazardly taking communion when we
[1:27:46] don't really even think about what he
[1:27:48] the price he paid for us
[1:27:50] right it wasn't so we could just go live
[1:27:52] the life of Riley
[1:27:55] he wants our life turned around
[1:27:59] it didn't stop a year after we got
[1:28:02] baptized he still wants it turned around
[1:28:04] more
[1:28:10] and I know why this this is not a
[1:28:14] enjoyable but
[1:28:18] but I don't ever believe that this
[1:28:20] ministry was
[1:28:24] for the mate believer I never believed
[1:28:26] that
[1:28:27] we've got to come out of unbelief
[1:28:29] brother Brian preached a message that
[1:28:31] God's God calls for a separation from
[1:28:35] all unbelief and we've got to come out
[1:28:37] of of the things that we get sucked into
[1:28:40] see
[1:28:42] we all get sucked into them
[1:28:48] sometimes I see too much playing around
[1:28:50] in the church
[1:28:54] too much getting up and leaving I can
[1:28:57] guarantee this statement if Jesus Christ
[1:28:59] was here literally in the flesh you
[1:29:02] would not get up and leave the church
[1:29:06] you would be so glued to what he's
[1:29:08] saying
[1:29:10] but your very actions prove that you
[1:29:13] don't believe Christ is here
[1:29:16] and that he has an order
[1:29:20] that he expects respect
[1:29:27] you know it is when you're talking to
[1:29:29] somebody
[1:29:30] imagine if you're talking to somebody
[1:29:34] I'm going to talk to this brother Ben
[1:29:35] because
[1:29:36] Brother Joseph then
[1:29:39] so I'm always talking to you and I'm
[1:29:41] talking to you my precious brother and
[1:29:44] we're having a good time fellowship and
[1:29:46] also and I just
[1:29:50] now what is he going to think
[1:29:54] what's he gonna think
[1:29:57] it won't be any oh that's great keep
[1:30:00] walking
[1:30:01] that's right
[1:30:02] and do you think Jesus says yeah keep
[1:30:04] walking keep going just leave here keep
[1:30:06] going go do now I understand
[1:30:10] that there are times that we have to
[1:30:13] leave I understand that
[1:30:15] but there's so many times we don't have
[1:30:17] to that we ain't trying hard enough to
[1:30:20] get ready and prepared for the service
[1:30:22] so we don't have to walk out two times
[1:30:24] during the worship
[1:30:25] come on
[1:30:32] we're not taking Church the way God
[1:30:36] intended it to be
[1:30:42] no
[1:30:44] if you don't want to take communion
[1:30:48] because well I'll just say this you
[1:30:51] don't want to be taking communion if
[1:30:52] you're gossiping
[1:30:55] if you don't mind gossiping you don't
[1:30:56] want to take communion
[1:30:58] if it don't bother you to say negative
[1:31:00] things
[1:31:03] if it doesn't bother you to miss church
[1:31:05] miss your post of Duty
[1:31:07] if it doesn't bother you to ignore your
[1:31:10] responsibilities
[1:31:11] if it doesn't bother you to have respect
[1:31:14] to persons and to love others more than
[1:31:17] others
[1:31:19] it doesn't bother you to hold back your
[1:31:22] ties and your offerings and not you know
[1:31:24] that's between me and God brother you
[1:31:26] don't want to be taking communion like
[1:31:28] that
[1:31:31] brother Branham talked about a poor
[1:31:33] believer he could hardly make at the
[1:31:35] church
[1:31:37] he just
[1:31:39] he had to call a cab to come and get him
[1:31:42] we would probably call them Ubers
[1:31:47] and as he could he didn't have much
[1:31:49] money and he didn't have a vehicle but
[1:31:52] when communion came for church he really
[1:31:56] really wanted to make sure he made it
[1:31:57] for that when he's walking out to get in
[1:32:00] his car and his neighbor stops by and
[1:32:02] says hey where are you going he says oh
[1:32:05] I'm going to church to take communion to
[1:32:08] take the bread and the wine
[1:32:11] and his neighbor I'm just going to pick
[1:32:14] it up right here in the testimony of a
[1:32:16] true witness he said oh I had some too
[1:32:19] said I had a pan full of biscuits and a
[1:32:21] quart of whiskey
[1:32:26] and on his table right immediately he
[1:32:31] fell into a heart attack
[1:32:35] they were looking for him to go at any
[1:32:37] minute
[1:32:39] he said don't be ear
[1:32:42] religious irreligious don't be
[1:32:45] irrelevant I think that's what he meant
[1:32:47] to say the first time don't be
[1:32:49] irrelevant see respect the word of the
[1:32:53] Lord
[1:32:55] for we don't know
[1:32:57] what minute we're going to be called on
[1:33:01] to answer back to God
[1:33:04] so we need to be serious about communion
[1:33:07] serious about a relationship
[1:33:11] communion has everything to do with your
[1:33:13] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:33:16] amen you can't be ill towards people
[1:33:21] I just say it like this if you have
[1:33:23] something
[1:33:24] all you got to do is make it right
[1:33:26] just make it right move forward
[1:33:29] you must discern that the people that
[1:33:32] you have a problem with
[1:33:33] could very well still be the Lord's body
[1:33:38] can you believe that
[1:33:40] is that really even possible
[1:33:43] well you got problems you could have
[1:33:47] kicked them out you might as well kick
[1:33:48] yourself out
[1:33:52] we must discern the Lord's body
[1:33:55] now I know the Lord's body
[1:33:58] is the word but we've also been taught
[1:34:01] that the Lord's body is inside his bride
[1:34:04] his people
[1:34:07] so communion has everything to do with
[1:34:09] our relationship with Christ
[1:34:11] you're pressing in with all of your
[1:34:14] heart now to love one another
[1:34:17] you're not just saying okay well I don't
[1:34:18] got nothing
[1:34:20] ill against anybody I guess I could go
[1:34:22] no you're actually wanting to do what
[1:34:24] the word tells you to do what you've
[1:34:26] been taught with what brother Brandon
[1:34:27] said lay everything aside until you get
[1:34:29] perfect love you're actually doing that
[1:34:32] brother John you're really raising the
[1:34:34] bar standard
[1:34:37] what to whom much is given much is
[1:34:38] required
[1:34:40] why is it just you know up for the the
[1:34:44] pastor that he has to well I'll tell you
[1:34:46] I'll be the first to tell you I am not I
[1:34:49] am not worthy I don't believe any of us
[1:34:51] are worthy
[1:34:54] I think his blood makes us worthy to
[1:34:58] take communion amen
[1:35:02] amen the Bible says if a righteous man's
[1:35:05] fall seven times seven times he gets
[1:35:06] back up
[1:35:09] you can't just stay down 49 times
[1:35:14] and get up when it's communion right
[1:35:17] God is looking for I don't know who I
[1:35:20] was talking to I don't know who it was I
[1:35:22] don't even want to think about it right
[1:35:24] now but
[1:35:26] really
[1:35:28] it's pretty easy to do about anything
[1:35:31] I think
[1:35:34] for God
[1:35:37] if you've got to help somebody you gotta
[1:35:40] make something right you can do it
[1:35:44] you got to go to you can do it you can
[1:35:46] go to church but you know what's hard
[1:35:49] is faithfulness to do it over and over
[1:35:52] and over and over and be faithful that
[1:35:55] is hard to do
[1:35:57] because you no longer can muster up the
[1:36:00] energy to do it once or twice or three
[1:36:03] times
[1:36:06] like you may be able to turn your cheek
[1:36:08] one or two times if somebody hit you
[1:36:11] what if they keep doing it
[1:36:14] come on
[1:36:16] and be faithful
[1:36:18] to love them anyways
[1:36:21] see faithfulness is a very hard thing
[1:36:25] but God has called all of us to be
[1:36:28] faithful
[1:36:30] communion has everything to do with that
[1:36:32] striving to please the Lord You're
[1:36:34] sincerely trying to obey every word of
[1:36:36] God
[1:36:38] because his words are spirit and their
[1:36:41] life to you
[1:36:42] now when your heart is in the right
[1:36:44] condition I say you're ready to move
[1:36:46] forward with taking communion can you
[1:36:49] say Amen
[1:36:51] we should have had a lot more amens on
[1:36:53] that
[1:36:55] we just don't want to take communion
[1:36:57] haphazardly
[1:37:01] because we'll just make our life worse
[1:37:04] I don't know it just God don't want it
[1:37:07] and it's up to him he's able to make all
[1:37:09] grace abound to us he's able to withhold
[1:37:11] it
[1:37:13] so
[1:37:15] we we are the ones that deceive
[1:37:18] ourselves by not obeying the word we are
[1:37:19] the ones that bring con damnation to
[1:37:21] ourselves
[1:37:24] so we're in control of this situation
[1:37:28] like I said before if you don't take
[1:37:30] communion you're disconnecting yourself
[1:37:31] from God you're disconnecting yourself
[1:37:34] from Calvary
[1:37:36] you're showing that there's something
[1:37:37] wrong with your relationship with Christ
[1:37:39] if you don't take communion
[1:37:44] we don't want to separate do we
[1:37:46] I say just take care of it move forward
[1:37:50] take care of it that should be much
[1:37:53] easier than being disconnected from God
[1:38:01] it's if I could say communion is like a
[1:38:04] showdown
[1:38:07] for the lukewarm believer
[1:38:09] he's got to get things right
[1:38:11] and if he doesn't
[1:38:13] then it's just showing everybody
[1:38:17] come on
[1:38:19] I believe God's blood can take care of
[1:38:21] any situation
[1:38:24] I believe he's capable of putting us all
[1:38:27] together United under Christ
[1:38:31] his blood can do it
[1:38:33] but we've got to confess
[1:38:36] we've got to say Lord I'm sorry help me
[1:38:39] with this
[1:38:40] I'm putting it I will strive to be all
[1:38:43] that you'd have me be okay First
[1:38:44] Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:38:46] my my and I'm going to try I will I will
[1:38:49] by the grace of God
[1:38:51] with his help and with this this
[1:38:53] scriptures here in
[1:38:56] First Corinthians chapter 11 start with
[1:38:58] verse 17.
[1:39:01] now in this that I declare unto you I
[1:39:07] praise you not
[1:39:08] that you come together not for the
[1:39:12] better
[1:39:14] but for the worse
[1:39:17] have you ever been in church
[1:39:20] and either either I'll just take it home
[1:39:24] first
[1:39:25] well have you ever been to church and
[1:39:26] heard somebody say Amen
[1:39:30] with a pitchfork
[1:39:35] all right oh yeah that was for hope they
[1:39:38] got it
[1:39:40] aim
[1:39:44] how many times
[1:39:46] have we been guilty
[1:39:49] of using a pitchfork
[1:39:53] that's not for the better
[1:39:59] it's one thing to have a burden for
[1:40:01] somebody to care about somebody it's
[1:40:03] another thing to use God's house to
[1:40:07] Pitchfork the word unto somebody
[1:40:13] so I think we should just say Amen so be
[1:40:17] it Lord I want to do it
[1:40:19] I want to do it Lord I want to live your
[1:40:21] word
[1:40:23] for first of all when you come together
[1:40:25] in the church I hear
[1:40:28] that there be divisions among you
[1:40:32] and I partly believe it
[1:40:36] so division
[1:40:38] sets you out of the boundaries of
[1:40:40] communion
[1:40:41] I just want to make that clear
[1:40:45] get rid of Divisions and I'll say it's
[1:40:48] real easy get rid of them
[1:40:52] out of your heart
[1:40:56] and and wise up to not think
[1:40:59] the thoughts that Satan would give you
[1:41:01] negative about somebody else
[1:41:05] when you get a thought about somebody
[1:41:06] get on your knees and say God
[1:41:09] may you move in this brother sister's
[1:41:11] behalf
[1:41:12] may you bless them with such a blessing
[1:41:15] that they be all that you would have
[1:41:16] them to be and forget about trying to
[1:41:20] dissect how bad and wrong they are amen
[1:41:24] that never brings anything out of you
[1:41:27] that's of Christ
[1:41:32] any kind of division
[1:41:35] puts us outside of true communion
[1:41:37] because communion Calvary brought us
[1:41:40] into Fellowship Calvary is what broke
[1:41:42] down the middle wall of tradition
[1:41:44] Calvary is what brought us together and
[1:41:47] who are we to take communion with some
[1:41:50] of the separation with another person
[1:41:59] for there must be also heresies among
[1:42:02] you
[1:42:05] that they which are approved may be
[1:42:08] manifest among you when you come
[1:42:10] together therefore into one place this
[1:42:13] is not to eat the Lord's supper now I
[1:42:16] can imagine some people would have had a
[1:42:18] problem with that scripture
[1:42:20] because when they had the first
[1:42:21] communion
[1:42:23] they were having suffer
[1:42:27] and Jesus just
[1:42:29] right there before it was over took
[1:42:32] bread and broke it
[1:42:36] and so here he was
[1:42:41] people that knew about really what
[1:42:43] happened
[1:42:44] with the Lord's Passover could have been
[1:42:47] saying it's okay to eat
[1:42:49] to come to church and eat and have
[1:42:51] communion at the same time
[1:42:53] because Jesus did he's our example
[1:42:57] but you know
[1:42:58] Paul was setting things in order
[1:43:02] and I'll tell you why Paul did that I
[1:43:04] believe I don't know why
[1:43:05] but you know what I think what happens
[1:43:08] is there's too much mixing
[1:43:12] see Jesus had the attention of his
[1:43:14] disciples
[1:43:16] King we're not doing dinner right now
[1:43:18] we're going to talk about something
[1:43:20] different
[1:43:21] but sometimes when you just blend them
[1:43:23] together one loses how real important it
[1:43:27] is
[1:43:28] so Paul was just setting order in the
[1:43:31] church we're not going to come together
[1:43:32] and eat now like they did we're gonna
[1:43:35] just you're gonna eat eat at home we're
[1:43:37] coming together for the Lord's Supper
[1:43:43] all right for in eating every one of you
[1:43:47] taketh before another his own supper and
[1:43:49] one is hungry and another is drunken
[1:43:51] what have you in a house has he eat and
[1:43:53] drink in despise ye the Church of God
[1:43:55] and shame
[1:43:57] and shame them that have not
[1:44:00] what shall I say to you shall I praise
[1:44:02] you for this I do not Praise You For
[1:44:05] This
[1:44:06] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:44:09] which also I delivered unto you
[1:44:12] that the Lord Jesus the same night which
[1:44:14] he was betrayed took bread and when he
[1:44:16] had given thanks he break it and said
[1:44:19] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:44:21] for you this do in remembrance of me
[1:44:29] which part of Jesus do you want to
[1:44:32] remember
[1:44:34] here
[1:44:36] the part which was broken for you
[1:44:41] that's the part
[1:44:43] that he wants you to remember
[1:44:46] until
[1:44:48] he comes
[1:44:50] and then it'll I believe he'll still
[1:44:54] want us to remember what he did for him
[1:45:00] and I believe we should be taking
[1:45:02] communion more often
[1:45:08] the thing is I don't want to take
[1:45:10] communion too often to where it doesn't
[1:45:13] really become real to us
[1:45:16] common
[1:45:19] so it was up all of us got to work
[1:45:21] together for that
[1:45:22] right
[1:45:26] and the same manner also he took the
[1:45:29] copy of what he had stopped saying this
[1:45:31] cup is the New Testament of my blood
[1:45:33] this do
[1:45:35] this Duty as often as ye drink it in
[1:45:39] remembrance of me
[1:45:44] is all about him suffering for you to be
[1:45:48] where you're at today
[1:45:49] to be where you're at today and to be
[1:45:52] where you're going to be before he
[1:45:54] returns it does not yet appear what we
[1:45:56] shall be but we know it when he shall
[1:45:57] appear we shall be like him we shall see
[1:46:00] him as he is we're going to be just like
[1:46:01] him verse 26 for as often as you eat
[1:46:04] this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:46:08] show the Lord's death
[1:46:12] till he comes
[1:46:18] beautiful
[1:46:20] wherefore what whosoever shall eat this
[1:46:22] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:46:24] unworthily
[1:46:27] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:46:28] blood of the Lord
[1:46:33] and here it is but let a man examine
[1:46:36] himself
[1:46:39] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:46:42] drink of that cup
[1:46:43] we've got to examine ourselves
[1:46:47] and we're just going to take a few days
[1:46:48] now and just really really examine
[1:46:53] I don't I don't mean it wrong
[1:46:58] I don't want you to examine one another
[1:47:02] I don't
[1:47:04] I want you to examine yourself
[1:47:08] but what you are allowed to do and
[1:47:10] should do is pray one for another
[1:47:16] for he that he is a drinketh and drink a
[1:47:19] damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:47:21] Lord's body
[1:47:23] for this cause many are weak and sick
[1:47:27] among you and many sleep now there has
[1:47:30] been a lot of stuff that has gone on a
[1:47:34] lot of sickness a lot of covet a lot of
[1:47:37] stuff that has happened and there's been
[1:47:40] a lot of people that are sick a lot of
[1:47:43] people that have been weak
[1:47:46] you got to remember this was spoken way
[1:47:48] before Colvin right right before all
[1:47:50] that but I say this to you look at your
[1:47:53] life
[1:47:54] do you feel like you're weak in the Lord
[1:47:58] do you feel like there's some sickness
[1:48:01] whether it's spiritual whether it's
[1:48:03] physical
[1:48:05] that there's just too much and you just
[1:48:07] can't gain the victory
[1:48:10] this is part of an examination
[1:48:14] you want to take this to heart you don't
[1:48:17] want to say well you know what I'm not
[1:48:18] sick today so I must be doing okay in
[1:48:21] the Lord that is not nothing to do with
[1:48:22] it right

[1:48:28] I believe the Lord would be pleased if
[1:48:30] we would do this
[1:48:33] here it is for if we would judge
[1:48:35] ourselves
[1:48:37] we should not be judged
[1:48:40] but when we are judged we are chasing of
[1:48:42] the Lord
[1:48:43] that we should be that we should not be
[1:48:46] condemned with the world in other words
