actually comfortable and what we want to do is just keep worship him keep praising him he promised to fill the hungry and the more we can hunger the more will eat amen um this is a Bitter Sweet service it's sweet because we have our brother Mark here is it bitter because we're not going to have our brother Mark here but it's weet we got brother Mark's family here I think don't do you think it'll just help us here if the family comes when Amen brother Mark's gone I think it'll help us it'll help us not to hurt as much amen uh I really love brother Mark I can say that I trusted him immensely and there was one thing that helped that trust to be as great as it is because it can only be God is was his faithfulness to the word of God he was just faithful and when you're faithful to the word you don't have to worry about getting hurt can you say amen amen amen so we just appreciate the life that he's lived here and uh through everything I mean what a wonderful privilege to see him grow up spiritually and what a privilege it is to see him obey what he feels in his heart and have faith to to leave everything that means so much to him honestly and so we're just grateful that he's a man of Faith he's uh plunging out and uh we need to pray for him more uh because we're not here to encourage and put our arm around him and say I love you and it's good to see you so we got to pray more that God is with them wherever you go amen amen I think we we need to call brother Mark up here at this time amen let's stand together and we want to pray for the offering and I feel would be in order uh to take up a little offering for our brother Mark uh I'm sure he's going to need some help down the road and so uh whatever you God puts on your heart and any way you like to help I'm sure as you do it unto the least of these Jesus says you do it unto me amen let's bow in the word Ouray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness we thank you for brother Mark we thank you for the for changing his nature for making him uh what you have called him to be Lord we thank you for the work that you've started Lord we believe we' Got Confidence that you're going to finish that work Lord and father as we bow before you we thank you for all each and every time that we have been blessed because of the life of brother Mark we've all been touched of many services and many men's meetings after Services before Services the the words of of caring and encouragement and Lord all the things that he's expressed and the word he's given us and just his faithful example Lord we want to thank you for every one of those right now we worship you and we praise you for it and Lord as we bow before you we just pray that your spirit father would go with them and and meet every need but we just pray that you would bless this offering Lord that we take up for our brother we pray Lord that you would bless those that give those that desire to give but are are lacking everything they

Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here Jes Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus amen am I definitely don't feel worthy of those compliments I really don't I I appreciate them thank you so much uh for each and every one of you who's been a part of my life all of you guys have been a part of my life for all the prayers and support for all these years this helped me made me the man I am today each one of you and I just thank God for each one of you and I'll never forget you know where God shaped me and molded me here in Michigan it's send the light um so I really appreciate that and this this is get into the word we'll bow our heads oh dear heavenly father we just thank you for this Precious Moment Lord it just felt like this day just came up so quick Lord amen Lord as we're just here tonight Lord I pray you just move in such a mighty way Lord may you bring your word to life like only you can Lord may you move me out the way Lord I'm nothing without you lord I pray that you speak to your children tonight Lord may you just bring each quote to life scripture to life Lord and may we just be able to say that we met with you Lord personally tonight we ask all these things Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen so if we turn to our Bibles in uh Philippians chapter 1 amen and we go over verse 6 get there myself getting used to a mic and a iPad and a Bible at the same time bear with me good practice So reading uh chapter 1: 6 very familiar scriptures we all read before so it says Paul speaking being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Christ Jesus you may be seated amen so we see that God has started a work in us and so what do we have to worry or fear if God has started that work all you have to do is trust that if God has called you if you can see in your life where God has just moved mightily just your nature changed your attitude changed then you got to have faith that God can handle anything and everything in your life and so the title of this uh little sermon is don't give up CU we've all been tempted to give up in life whether it's been a job or whatever it is family whatever it is we've been tempted to give up but if you give up the victory will not come and so whatever you're doing if it's a workout goal if it's a diet goal whatever it is you have to not give up to succeed in it so we don't have to worry all we have to do is trust in God your life is in his hands he has a plan for you and let's go to Jeremiah 29 so God has a plan for each one of us and it's up for us to find out what that plan is personally your plan is not my plan and my plan is not your plan so it's a custom plan that God has for each one of us so Jeremiah 29 111-113 we've heard this many times but we really need to just get the the spirit behind what God is trying to tell us in here so verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected End Amen so God wants to see you prosper he wants to see you blessed not not just financially but spiritually see God wants to work at the inside and the outside let's go to verse 12 then you shall call upon upon me he shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and now it get really into depth in 13 it's talking about you know he has plans to prosper you but how do you go about finding that out and it says in verse 13 and he shall seek me and find me when ye search for me with all your heart so it's a personal thing you have to search it out you have to ask God what is your plan for my life because you can live a life of L luxurious riches and all these things but that's not necessarily the plan that God has for your life you can't place riches against God's plans cuz Prosperity doesn't mean you're prospering with God we have all these mega churches out here and all these other these things but doesn't mean that they're prospering with God so riches is not always a sign God can bless you Abraham was a rich man Solomon was a rich man but they didn't desire after these riches God blessed them for faithfulness amen he said ye shall seek me and find me when ye search me with all my heart so that's the part that you and I play you have to seek and in search what God has for your life God promis you'll be the best thing you ever done in your life I can testify of that and we all can testify of that amen now be found of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I'll gather you from all nations from all the places whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord so amen so God has a plan for your life I love that let's go to Deuteronomy 4 verses 29-31 amen how many love the word tonight amen amen so 29 but if from thence Thou shalt seek the Lord thy God look it's talking about seeking God again that's how important that is to God cuz he's a Gentleman Just As You Like Somebody's knocking at the door of your house you have to let them in and the same thing with God you have to invite him into your heart he's not going to force himself but he's waiting for you to let him in so he can up with you to have fellowship with you it's a personal Affair but if from then Thou shalt seek the Lord thy God thou shall find him so it's saying if you truly seek God with all your heart he will be found he'll make known himself to you because he sees the motive and intent of your heart to know him amen it says with all thy heart and with all thy Soul so you have to put your all into it if you put your all into it God is going to be known to you personally look what ver vers 30 says when thou are in Tribulation amen and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou see if is a conditional statement so something is if you do this if thou turn to the Lord thy God and shall be obedient unto his voice so obedience is key just as a a parent is raising a child they expect the child to be obedient and if the child is not being obedient he's not going to get rewarded because you don't reward bad hav with good things because you become a spoiled brat so for the Lord thy God is a merciful god so we serve a god of Mercy a god of love and grace but we also serve a god of judgment so you don't want to spurn the grace of God you don't CU he's given each one of us a chance to serve him to get to know him in a personal way but you have to take that step you have to take that leap of faith it may not you may understand it because you can't understand god with human intellects cuz you weren't meant to understand god with human intellects his ways are past understanding distrust believe amen amen so he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he swear unto them amen see the problem is a lot of times we want God in our own terms and own conditions but you got to come to God in his terms and conditions and and the thing is we we want all the benefits we want all the blessings we want all our bank accounts full we want our house payment full all these things but if you're not going God's way then how is he going to reward you he rewards faithfulness if you're faithful to God he will be faithful to you simple as that don't make it complicated God is hidden simplicities you don't have to put your name on the book or give give money to this and that but just give God your heart that's all he asked and I promise you'll be the best thing you've ever done in your entire life I promise you but are we willing to pay the price are we willing to surrender oursel are we willing to let him take control of the driver's will see you can't hold on and let God and God is going to hold on at the same time God is waiting for you to let go and sit in the backseat and prepare for the ride let him be the pilot of let him take you to the destination he wants you to go to amen let's go to Second Timothy Chapter 2 chapter 2 veres 1-4 thank you Jesus see we we've come too far to give up we've come too far in our walk with the Lord to let something Sidetrack us and we got to get back we got to get back in the groove of things put your foot pedal to the metals they say so second Timothy read verse chapter 2 amen let me get there myself amen and we'll start with verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus that promise is to you and to me to Timothy my dearly beloved Son grace and mercy and peace from God the father in Christ Jesus our lord I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembered of thee in prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see that being mindful of the tears that I may be filled with joy verse 5 when I call to remembrance the unfin faith that is in thee which dwell first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother inise and I am persuaded that alt thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of hands look what verse 7 says right here for God ha not given us the spirit of fear so when we fail to give up that's not God telling you to give up that's the enemy speaking lies to you to give up cuz it said my Bible says here that God has not given us the spirit of fear but what but of Power of Love of a sound mind says verse 8 be thou therefore be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of Goden amen and then let's go to uh amen now we go to chapter 2 verses 1- 4 that was verse that was chapter 1 so thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus so notice Paul isn't saying be strong in the politics that you're watching or be strong in the trends and the fashion statements and the movie stars but he said be strong in Christ Jesus because that's the only strength that's going to last Heaven and Earth will pass away but word will not pass away so you can put all your eggs in a basket on on stocks I'm not not getting stocks stocks are good not saying that but you don't put all you have into stocks put all you have into Jesus cuz that's the only investment that will never fail see investments will go up and down but Jesus Christ won't he's the same yesterday today and forever so he's un he doesn't change he told us that amen let's go to verse two and the things that thou has heard heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who should be able to teach others also so look what the motive is when you give your heart to God and you start growing you want to be able to teach somebody the same thing that God has taught you teach them to be a leader teach them what surrendering really is what a Christian Life really is your life needs to be a Bible to somebody not you can't just cram the Bible down people's throats what you believe you should be living it and people should be able to see that organically see a sheep does not manufacture wool but a sheep Bears wool and the same thing with this gospel you have to bear it let the Lord just bear the gospel in you that's the that's the desire of every Christian is to let let Let Jesus be saw in me in you amen let's go to verse three thou therefore endured hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ so we're we're in a a Heavenly Army a Heavenly military amen so so we're soldiers and we get and there's going to be hardness there's going to be pressure there's going to be uh sufferings there's going to be hardships that's part of a Christian Life verse four no man that worth entangle himself with the fairs of this life that he may please him who had chosen him to be a soldier so our desire and our goal is to please our Lord and savior because the end of the day that's all that's going to matter not how much you have in your savings account not not you that that you can retire at 45 or 55 it doesn't matter cuz tomorrow is never promised I this could be my last day you ever seen me again I could die the next day you never know and so you want to make sure that every Stone's unturned that your heart is right with God tonight because at the there's no you can't if you're dead there's no you can't make anything up you can't go back in time so make it right tonight tonight's the right night amen amen 1953 brother Brandon speaking here now along this journey he promised to supply every need we have so God knows every need you'll have from from last week until the end of your journey so don't think God doesn't know the Bible tells we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so he was watching human flesh like you and me he knows what pain he knows what what sadness is he knows what hunger feels like he knows what homelessness feels like he knows all these things he said the son of man is on place even to lay his head and so God understands how you feel amen amen he says whatsoever you will ask in my name that will I do whatsoever things mark 11:24 whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it now the thing is I want to add this to this now you can't just say hey Lord can I have five fleets of Cadillacs it doesn't work that way it no it doesn't work that way so the thing is it's the motive and attitude of your prayer that's going to touch the heart of God that's what's going to touch it not not how much he can bless you with this and that but what are you going to do that with that prayer that you ask God with when he answers it that's the key he's looking at now he gave us check this out he gave us the strongest weapon that there is it's not a nuclear bomb it's not a missile not a AK-47 not a tank but check what it is he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world that's prayer prayer is what changes things the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has check this out when he kneels on his knees before who the almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize that what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's word is true remember that let's go to 2 Corinthians 12 Amy man read verses 9- 11 amen so it says to another I'm in the wrong book second I'm in First Corinthians amen amen so right here this is Paul asked for something he had this uh this issue in his life and he asked God three times and Look What the Lord answer was he said we start pick up in verse eight for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me verse n and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather Glory glory in my infirmities amen glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me verse 10 therefore I take pleasure and infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distress for Christ sake for I am weak then I am strong so we say the way up with God is down you got to humble yourself before the Mighty God don't think you have everything figured out because I promise you you don't and know it all does not have it all figured out I've been there before so it won't it won't solve anything in fact it'll get you into more trouble than you realize so amen let's go to verse 11 I became a fool in gloring you have compelled me for ought to have been commended of you for nothing am I behind the very cheses of the Apostle though I be nothing to if to recognize that we came into this world with nothing and anything we have is by God's tender hand of grace and mercy that we have it we woke up today we woke up today not everybody has that testimony they woke up today God is giving you breath in your lungs he let you get out of bed thank you Lord he's giving you the health that you have maybe not be the health that you want but it's a people would kill to have the health that you have right now I promise you that there's people in a hospital bed laying on their back can't even move but we have the God has given us the ability to move to to work to pay our bills to drive to have a nice beautiful church so we got to be more thankful be more grateful amen look at it don't stop looking at the things that you don't have but be thankful the things that you do have cuz when you start looking the other direction you start you start becoming ungrateful you start murmuring you start complaining about everything then before you know it it gets contagious and the next person gets it's attitudes can be contagious it's like a basketball team you can have the best basketball players together but if they're all if if one has a rotten attitude it begins to spread and it ruins the whole team like one app a rotten apple with a bunch of Good Apples they start to spoil the other ones amen let's go to uh let's go to Mark 11 verse 22 so Look what Jesus said this this one simple statement right here and Jesus answering sayth unto them have faith in God that one statement but it's so powerful think about that have faith in God we read this already but we read it again for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain so it's not saying you got to be black you got to be white you got to be Asian you got to be Hispanic but saying who shall ever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart so maybe somebody needs healing tonight maybe somebody needs Deliverance tonight you got to not doubt in your heart you got to believe that God can supply the need that you have amen the channel is open tonight but you have to be willing to get into that channel you be willing to say God I believe what your word says help my unbelief because I know you are God be thou removed and be cast in seed but shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatso ever he saith verse 24 therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and look at verse 25 says right here and when you stand praying forgive if you ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you for your trespasses look at verse 26 says but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses forgiveness is one of the hardest things that a human being could ever do especially when somebody did you so wrong that it's not even funny but the thing is you got to be able to let go and the thing is you can't let go of it alone you need God to help you but you got to be willing to say God I want to get rid of this I want to make this a peace but lord I can't do it without you Amen on see you can't hold on to and expect God to do something you got to be willing to let go and let God have his way to give you that Spirit of forgiveness cuz he sees your heart Isaiah 49 how many love the word tonight it's his words not mine so we at 13- 16 amen second amen second let me find it I think I got the wrong one I'm read a quote real quick I said Do you believe the seven Redemptive names so I want now let's get into the I the Lord just led me to this there's seven Redemptive names I'm not going to get a chance to get into all of them but there'll be maybe Lord willing when I come back be a part two so I really want us just to just realize what we have at our fingertips in God he's so many things to us I think a lot of times we don't just recognize how powerful and mighty God is how awesome he really is we just look at it like one channel of he's this but he's all over he's omnipresent he's everything amen do you believe the seven Redemptive names compound names belongs to Jesus if he wasn't and didn't fulfill in him was the seven compound names he was Jehovah J there is Jehovah Gyra God's provided sacrifice and you have to admit that or say that he wasn't the Son of God then then if he is Jehovah gy he is Jehovah rapi the Healer also for all seven compound names our Victory amen check that our Banner our Shield our buckler our healing our Salvation our provided sacrifice all laid in him think about that and when he died on Calvary he spoiled principalities raised up throwed his hands out said it's finished Hallelujah Devils trembled hell shook it's a type of every way and he rose up on Easter morning I am he that was dead and is alive again there he is Jehovah RFA Jehovah Manassa Jehovah jyra God's provided sacrifice couldn't have a word to say Amen so let's go to go to Genesis 22 so the first compound Redemptive name that we know him as is Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide see God can provide at any time any way but you got to have faith that he can provide for you God can provide the very need that you have right now but if you can't trust that he can do that then how can he ever provide that need for you so you got to have faith that God is going to come through in the clutch he will come in as time and time again allow him let him be God in your life that's the key if you don't let God be God then he can never show you that Redemptive name right there Jehovah Gyra so we go to Genesis 22 and read verses 7 through 8 amen so it says so it's after so Abraham had a son Isaac we all know the story and uh they were going up to the mountain and uh he had to sacrifice his son and look what uh Isaac asked his father here and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father father and said my father he said here I am thy son he said behold the fire in the wood but there's where is the Lamb for the burnt offering verse 8 and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and how many are thankful for Jesus Christ tonight he was that lamb that God provided for us he was that lamb that gave you a way to life more abundantly the lamb that gave you a chance for deliverance gave you a chance for healing I know I can't speak for everybody but we all had past maybe some worse than others but we can all testify that God delivered us from that dark past not nothing that we did nothing that we could ever do or Merit but it's what he did so why would you denounce something that's free it's free to everyone amen let's finish verse 8 so they went both of them together together so God has provided a lamb let's go to Philippians 4:19 amen amen look what it says right here so but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and the glory by Christ Jesus I'm going to say that one more time but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus so Christ knows you have the need he knows whatever you're going through he knows it so stop doubting stop looking everywhere else but him and just believe that he's going to supply your need God knows we have spiritual needs physical needs but the most important need that you have is what's in here cuz if in here is supplied then the other is going to but seek ye first what the kingdom of God and what his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you let's go to Matthew 6:25 we all know this we can all Quote this but I think a lot of times if we we got to be able to know it personally in the trial that we're going through because it's it's good if you can quote it but it's it being manifested in your life in the time of a trial cuz that's the most important time if it's that because if I if I can just quote it it's not going to do me any good but if I can live it that's when it's going to benefit me the best amen verse 25 therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink for for your body what you shall put on it's not the life more than the meat and the body than a Remnant behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father Feth them so God cares about the birds how much more does he care about you his child his son his daughter amen verse 27 say he even says are verse 26 he says are ye not much better than they verse 27 which of You by taking thought can add one cubid unto a stature how many can grow from 5 foot to six foot by themselves nobody in here nobody I bet we all wish we probably could at certain points in our life but you can't so verse 28 and why take ye thought for the remnant the lies of the field sometimes we get so focused on the problem that's going on in our life and the trial that we take our eyes off of Jesus and the key is if you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ your perfect sacrifice your lord your savior then you won't be wondering how I'm going get out of this what can I escape at but you're going to just be saying Lord what is the direction you want me to go in this trial what are you trying to just mold and shape in me I want to be able to find it I don't want have to go around the mountain again and again and again I want to be successful in this trial and go to another trial it's like leveling up in a video game you hit these levels you keep going but each level is a little harder it has to be like that one of my friends said this statement new levels new Devils it's the truth so go to verse go to verse 29 now let's finish 28 that's true brother and why take ye thought for the remnant consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spend and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which is today and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you of little faith so God is going to we said this he's going to come through he knows exactly when to give you the thing you need at the very time you need it see a lot of times we want something from God and if he gave it to you that time that you wanted it it would mess you up you would you would you wouldn't use it properly so God that's why God withholds certain things from us to a perfect time and so we got to trust that God knows the right time to give you something it's like with Daniel he prayed for 21 days straight God didn't give it to him in day 19 or day 18 but he waited after 21 days so this and you got to realize too sometimes something can be happening spiritual warfare and that's what the angel told him I was fighting and that's why I didn't get there on time so you got to hold the faith amen verse 31 therefore take no thought saying what we shall eat or what we shall drink whether we should be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things he does he knows the needs every single you can give me a list of needs God knows it amen you can give me a novel God knows it so look what verse 32 says or verse 33 I I love this is one of my favorite verses in the Bible amen but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness that's so check it out the first thing you have to do is seek first the kingdom of God seek his will for your life seek his will seek his kingdom and his righteous look what it says right here and all these things shall be added unto you spiritual natural you you you fill in the blank God is going to supply those needs but you first have to seek Him trust him believe him amen believe who he says he is because he is who he says he is verse 34 take therefore no thought for the tomorrow for the marrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof amen let's go to John 6 so we have to exercise our faith we got to apply it like with the hup it was a simple common plan but you got to it's like you getting in your car you have faith when you get in the car is going to start that's the same type of faith when coming to God it's believe that God is who he is that's all you have to do just imagine getting in a car same type of Faith you have John 6 29-36 amen Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on him who have sent that's how simple it is God's Not trying to confuse you or get you to solve a mass equation or or or or go to catechism school or do all these things but he says this is the work of God that you believe on him just believe him from your heart not intellectually but really believe from your heart believe it then they said unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see see man is always trying to see something see see see see see I got to see this I got to see this that's not what God didn't say if thou can see it he said if thou can believest take God of his word test him say prove me he said our fathers that eat man in the desert as is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father give you that true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth his life unto the world I love that Jehovah Gyra the per perfect sacrifice that bread that came to us from heaven was Jesus Christ amen 34 they said unto them Lord ever more give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger see in each one of us every person in the entire world God has placed a a hunger a thirsting for him and the thing is you get to choose what you feel it with right you can fill it with what womanizing you can fill it with alcoholism pornography but it will never satisfy you gambling addictions it will never satisfy because you'll be going to Pillar To Post trying to find some form of happiness but never being satisfied because you need more to even quench what's inside of you but when you come to God you don't have to keep searching because that's I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord 2017 I got that Revelation that it was he who completed me I had joy unspeakable I wasn't constantly searching anymore for for pleasure for happiness cuz it was right there in front of me joy was right there in front of me the whole entire time and I missed it and that's something each person has to experience personally the pastor can't push you into it I can't push you into it brother Jonathan can't push you into it but you have to experience yourself personally and it'll be the best experience you ever had in your life life Amy man I forgot where I'm at now verse 35 and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father shall give giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me will I in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which has sent me check this out that all which he ha given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day see God's desire he wishes that everybody would come to believe who he is but he knows that not everyone is going to come so but he still gives an opportunity a outreached hand to every single person because the day of judgment no man can say that God was not merciful and gracious unto them and so you have the choice right now you have the power of decision right now God is placed in your hands the power of decision right now this very moment and you got to choose what you're going to do with that decision I can't do it for you brother John can't do it for you sister an can't do it for Joseph can't do it for you but you have to make that choice amen the Lord will provide you just have to trust no matter how bad it gets just keep being faithful keep praying keep digging God will come through and don't just stop at only wanting him as a provider see a lot of people just follow him for the lows and Fishes a lot of people just follow him for Lord that's it bless me in this area help me pay this bill help me do this but after they get the bill paid they forget all about God see the thing is it's easy to serve God when you're you're you're flowering through the flowers when everything is good you're in the mountain top but when you're in the Valley can you serve God the same way is that same desire that same love there see that that's that's the real test right there if you have a relationship with God CU you should be able to praise God just as much on the mountain top as in the valley that should the cir the situation shouldn't change the circumstances of your praise it shouldn't your praise should just it should be a a perfect gradual increase if I can say it that way in fact you should be praising God even more I believe on the Mountain Top cuz if you can praise him on the mountain top then the Valle is are going to surprise you see a lot of times God has to get us in that Valley to really recognize who he really is cuz we think it's us that we do everything but if God takes his hand off of you you'll be sick your health won't be as good and the thing is we don't want that and and job didn't even have a choice but job still remained faithful to God his wife said won't you curse God and die his friends called him a secret sinner but yet he said the lord giveth the Lord take itth away blessed be the name of the Lord so during his darkest time his praise was still there his praise was still turned up he could still say Lord I love you Lord I Praise You amen and so we got to have that same type of attitude in our darkest trials because that's going to touch the heart of God he said my son isn't to serve me for Loaf and Fishes but he served me because he loves me amen amen beautiful let's go to John 6 and the thing is God isn't asking you to be able to understand everything he's not cuz we can't understand everything it'd be impossible let's go John 6: 6 67-69 so this this is uh thousands of people were following Jesus at this time they they they saw the Miracles he did the healings the Loaves and Fishes they saw multiply of the bread they saw all these things they they were Witnesses healing the sick lame being raised all these things that they witnessed they could say that I saw Jesus do this but when Jesus really started to get deep see that was the bait in the hook he started to get deep into what he was here for then we'll see what happened let's see what happened right here then said Jesus unto the twel will ye go also go away look what Simon Peter said then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou has had the world's thou Hast sometimes this Old English gets me thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are assure notice that we believe and are sure it's been made personal to them it wasn't made personal to the other followers the thousand people that follow Jesus even gave them power to heal the sick and cast out demons to all those people and they still didn't stay with him that's true think about that I can see why um um the Rich Young Ruler and the Lazarus how he said Abraham you think one rais from the dead will will persuade them he said not even one raised from the dead if they don't believe the prophets that's right so cuz these people saw what Jesus could do they knew even the Pharisees said we know that our man sent from God so it's not about seeing things it's about believing things amen amen and we believe and are sure that thou are Christ the son of the Living God you could ask pet can you explain all these things he said about eating flesh and all these things like no but I believe it amen amen Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of them is a devil he spake of Jews the ISAT isar that the son of Simon for he is what should betray him being one of the 12 amen we're going get into our next uh compound Redemptive name next it ain't coming because that lays in Calvary it's already been done one one thing any man can do is is point you to what's already been done amen I can't do anything for you but I can point to you to who can do something for youz I have no power I'm weak undone I make mistakes I make bad decisions but I can point you to who changed my life and is still changing my life amen amen beautiful that's right he is Jehovah Gyra he is God's provided sacrifice and everything that you have need of him Lays in him so you have to go searching out in the world politics I'm not saying politics is bad to not keep informed but I think a lot of times we get so involved in what's going on in the world we forget about if I read the back of the book I win right so you know so doesn't matter what man can do to me God has a final say so that's right God has a final say so so let's not worry about Russia and all these things it's going to come to pass but let's let us be found hid in Christ be found hid in the word of God cuz that one thing will never pass Jesus told us is Heaven and Earth will pass but my words will not pass so we got to be found in the word that's why I want be found at is in the word of God let's go to Psalms 103 how we doing on time read verses 1- six bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me so we're talking about Jehovah RFI the Lord the Healer bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name that's some worship right there bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits so there is benefits to serving God and and David is going to talk about a little bit right now who redeemed says who forgiveth all thy iniquities who Health all thy diseases so we serve a Healer that he can heal any disease no matter how terminal it is no matter how bad it is no matter whatever it is God can heal that very thing cuz that's the kind of guy he's a great physician for a reason says who redeemeth thy life from destruction so that's two things he's talking about forgiving your iniquities he's a Healer says he's a redeemer says who redeemeth thy life from destruction so we can all testify at one point in our life we were in the path of destruction and God plucked us up and put us on Solid ground and he redeemed us thank you Lord says who crowneth thee with loving kindness so loving kindness is favor is Grace and Tender Mercies his his mercies are new every day every morning verse five and there some more benefits he's talking about who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like eagles verse six the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he has made his ways known unto to Moses his action to the children of Israel the Lord is merciful more benefits and gracious he's slow to anger and I love this right here and plantless in Mercy he will not always CH neither he keep his anger forever Heath not dealt with us after our sins who's thankful that God doesn't judge you according to what you've done in the past but he said if you truly repent he throws it in a sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again amen he would not always verse 11 for as the heavens is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear him so the type of fear we're talking about is a reverence is a respect that's the type of fear God just desires just respect him reverence him just lift his name up on high he's worthy of his praise and glory let's go to Psalms 107:20 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction I'm going to read one more time he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions there's so many promises in this Bible that are for you the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass so all these you got to put your name in the Bible that he was wounded for your for transgressions and by his stripes you are healed you got to put your name and say that this by he's talking to you each one to you personally but you got to make it so personal he has to be he said last last time we ministered my God my Fortress my righteousness my healer my deliverer he has to be all these things to you personally because he's not all these things personally you can never experience what God truly is amen let's go to Exodus 15:26 1526 amen so it says and said if thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon you which I have brought unto the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health thee amen so it's so simple all God requires is obedience he's not asking you to cut your arm off or or do the Double Dutch or whatever he's not asking all these complicated things but all he's asking is just believe me just listen to me that's all he's asking literally it's all he's asking and sometimes we make it so hard we get so caught up in all these other things just take God's word and believe him simple as that simple we go to 53 Isaiah 53: 4-8 then we'll jump to got time for maybe one more Redemptive name like I said before if we really did an in-depth study we'll be here all night and a year from now too 53: 4-8 surely Heath borne our griefs so he put your name surely Heath borne Mark Cosby's griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him he was stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for Brother John Martin's transgressions he was bruised for sister Linda's iniquities the chastising of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed put your name in there that's for you personally this is a love letter written back to you put your name in there and believe that it's written just personally for you verse six and all like sheep we have gone astray I can I can definitely say I've done that and we have all turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all thank you Jesus he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth for you he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before his shears and dumb so he opened not his mouth he was humiliated for you so that cuz he he knew back in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve did that that sin or they disob obeyed God's voice he made a way he made a way a provided way it it took thousands of years because that's how it had to go be the perfect Plan of Redemption but when Jesus Christ rose on that Easter morning he made a way for all that to happen no matter how how what you did if you murdered somebody whatever whatever you've done God has made a way to cleanse you to redeem you thank you Lord so don't think you're too far gone because you're not Paul murdered murdered Christians Moses killed a man but look what look what they it's not about how you start it's about how you finish say say one more time it's not about how you start it's about how you finish amen he was taken from prison from the judgment and who shall declare this his generation for he was cut off the land of the living for my the transgression of my people was he stricken he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he put him the grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his SE he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand amen we go to Jo Jehovah roigh the Lord my shepherd it was funny that brother Jonathan mentioned Psalms 23 because it's on my notes I was like wow I love how the Lord just gives us Little Golden nuggets just that's the scripture he want us to read so let's go to we'll finish off with Psalms 23 verses 1 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want so you have to make the Lord your Shepherd the head of your life and it says he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters what what's weird to me sometimes is I don't know understand why they read this at funerals because to me it looks like it's talking about somebody who's living right now because it's kind of hard for the Lord to to Shepherd you if you're already dead cuz you know you can't just Shepherd a bunch of dead sheeps just saying so he make me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake so God is in the restoration business so he's see he doesn't do a one thing but he's constantly restoring you he's trying to make you of what the perfect image of he saw on Calvary of what you were so he's constantly trying to he just why he's leading you beside Still Waters he's shepherding you through these trials for a reason because he sees the potential in you he's trying to make that potential known it's like with gold when you first see gold you got to beat beat the gold until you see your image and we see the reflection that's what he's trying to do is seeing the reflection of himself inside of us amen I forgot where I was at verse verse four ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death so I want you to check this out when you're walking through the valley of the shadow of death in order for there to be a shadow there has to be light so there's light in that Valley keep walking until you he hit that light that full amen so y though I walk through the valley the shadow of death I will fear no evil say it with me I will fear no evil for thou are my rod thou are my staff they comfort me God is your greatest Comfort not binge watching shows which I'm not saying that's bad but don't look for comfort in other places because it's only going to give you temporal Comfort vacations are good but they're going to go away Monday morning is going to come so quick and you're going to say that vacation like it never happened and so your comfort has to come from God cuz Jesus said come unto me all you that labor labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest he said rest unto your soul cuz that's the only rest that's going to hold it's going to stand the test of the time is rest unto your soul verse five thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever so I just I just love that Psalm 23 it just it means a lot to me and we'll just we'll read one more scripture and we'll close here John 10 sh R verse n so Jesus says I am the door by me so he said he's the door he's the only way you can go through you can try to go through the Cellar Door the back door and that door may seem good cuz every way of a man is right in his own eyes but he's the only door that you can go through says I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy so the devil's job is to steal to kill and to destroy and he said Look what Jesus says right here I am come that they might have life and they may have it more abundantly so he died so you can have life more abundantly you don't have to live below your privilege God has called us to live such higher than what we think we're so scared to take God as where we're so scared to claim what it says in here claim it believe it live it cuz God wants to fulfill it in your life but you have to be willing to go out in that limb take that leap of faith take the leap of faith God's going to come through every time amen well this will rise to our feet it's little little song I want to sing um we'll just sing it you guys probably don't know it God is able to do just what he said he would do he's going to fulfill every prise to you don't give up on God cuz he won't give up on you God is able to do just what he said he would do he's going to fulfill every prise to you don't give up on God cuz he won't give up on you sing with me God is able to do just what he said said he would do he's going to fulfill every prise to you don't give up on God cuz he won't give up on you one more time God is able to do just what he said he would do he's going to fulfill every prise to you don't give up on God cuz he won't give up on you closing statement don't give up on God don't give up keep pushing keep pressing keep fighting he's right there in your corner we we didn't give we didn't get to one of the compound names but it talks about he's a present God he's right there right here say I promise be with you and in you to the end of the world so don't give up keep holding to that promise got to keep holding on until it comes to pass is have that have that that Faith the unmovable Faith because if you have that unmovable faith God is going to come through cuz God God God doesn't know what giving up means he's never done it so we got to we got to be like God don't give up Amen Let bow our heads maybe sister sh could play something softly for us oh Lord Jesus you've been so good to us Lord you been we can just say surely good and mercy has followed us all the days of our life Lord somebody could give us a a blank notebook Lord and we could just fill it up Lord just of all the things that you've blessed us with Lord all the testimonies that you've given us Lord you've been so good to us Lord I'm just as guilty Lord sometimes we get in such a pickle that we think we can't get out of it Lord and sometimes we forget I remember your servant David Lord when he stood the hardest trial of his life Goliath he looked back and saw what you did for him you gave him the strength and power to to kill a bear and to kill a lion and he he knew that the same God that gave him the strength to do that was going to give him strength to kill this uncircumcised Philistine Lord may we have faith like David may we not know what giving up means cuz I see this enemy that we have the devil and he is so persistent he doesn't give up trying to always poke at us and Lord may we be so persistent Lord and and getting in that Refuge that you are may we be so persistent Lord just giving more of oursel to you every day Lord may we open more doors of our heart to you may we just welcome you into our heart every day oh God forgive us Lord for even thinking about times of just turning back around and giving up Lord but father something in us just anchors and holds us Lord and it's you Lord you give us the strength to get back up if a righteous man falls seven times he get back up lord it's because of of you Lord you've given us that fight youve given us that strength Lord to just keep getting up Lord and father it's by your grace and by your mercy Lord that we're not consumed Lord father you protected us so much over these years Lord just to think who we were before Lord and who we are becoming now it's because of your Mighty hand Lord and father I don't know who's here tonight maybe somebody's here is
