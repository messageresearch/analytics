[29:44] father we thank you that we could come
[29:46] to a place
[29:48] that there is a a a building a little
[29:51] room that's been set aside that we could
[29:54] come
[29:55] and believe that your presence would be
[29:58] there because
[29:59] there's a little group of people that
[30:01] believe the entire word of god from
[30:03] cover to cover
[30:05] and that's what you told
[30:08] so many people to believe through the
[30:10] ages

[30:17] believe

[30:21] we pray that lord that we not question
[30:24] your word and that through the faith in
[30:27] your word lord that
[30:29] um that all things would be possible in
[30:32] our grips lord that we could have the
[30:34] things that we have need of
[30:36] lords we come before you today i pray
[30:39] that
[30:40] lord as we've we sound these songs these
[30:43] choruses our hearts are prepared a
[30:46] sanctuary
[30:47] lord may your word come and be revealed
[30:50] to us
[30:50] that when we would leave here that we
[30:53] would be
[30:54] more like you more in your image drawn
[30:56] closer to you better
[30:58] equipped to meet and face the enemy lord
[31:02] lord we all have needs we're all going
[31:04] through trials
[31:05] wrong desiring leadership for our lives
[31:08] i pray lord that somehow through the
[31:11] power of the supernatural spirit that
[31:14] you would come and meet the knees that
[31:15] be amongst us
[31:17] we commit the service with every one of
[31:20] these needs
[31:21] into your hands now we trust you for
[31:23] them for we ask it all in jesus christ's
[31:25] name
[31:26] amen amen god bless you turn with me
[31:29] if you would to the book of jeremiah
[31:31] we've got two scripture readings one is
[31:32] in jeremiah
[31:33] chapter 29 and one is in james chapter
[31:37] 5.
[31:40] as you're turning there we want to
[31:44] take another service on questions and
[31:46] answers
[31:48] and this is going to be our part six and
[31:50] we want to talk about
[31:52] approaching god approaching god
[31:56] and i want to combine actually two
[31:58] questions
[31:59] that were given i'd like to read these
[32:01] now before we read the scriptures
[32:04] and the two questions are one is what is
[32:07] the best way
[32:08] to approach the lord in prayer
[32:12] that's the first question i want to
[32:14] combine it with this question
[32:15] how to combat thoughts when trying to
[32:18] seek god
[32:20] when speaking the word to satan
[32:24] i like to approach uh combine these two
[32:27] and try to try to get them both if we
[32:30] could starting here with
[32:31] jeremiah chapter 29 verse
[32:34] number 12 then shall ye call
[32:37] upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me
[32:40] and i will hearken unto you and ye shall
[32:44] seek me and find me
[32:45] when you shall search for me with all
[32:47] your heart amen and then jared
[32:50] and then james chapter 5
[32:53] just one verse there verse number 16
[32:57] confess your faults one to another
[33:00] and pray one for another that ye may be
[33:03] healed
[33:04] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[33:06] righteous man
[33:07] availeth much god bless you may be
[33:10] seated
[33:13] approaching god is not easy and all you
[33:17] got to do is look at the last time you
[33:19] prayed
[33:21] and you didn't feel like praying
[33:24] didn't feel like much was getting
[33:26] accomplished
[33:28] and that pretty much sums up that
[33:31] approaching
[33:32] god is not real easy
[33:37] satan isn't going to just lay down and
[33:39] let you communicate with god
[33:41] and allow the the presence of god just
[33:44] to come in your
[33:46] your area every gun from hell is pointed
[33:50] against you
[33:51] when you set out to pray every force of
[33:54] evil
[33:54] is going to press against you and make
[33:56] it hard
[33:59] i just want you to kind of
[34:02] uh flow with me if you would as we go
[34:06] through some of these experiences that
[34:08] we've had
[34:09] satan has many tools that he uses when
[34:12] we approach
[34:13] god in prayer and
[34:18] he'll try many different lures now lure
[34:21] is a distraction
[34:24] when you set out to go fishing
[34:27] the lure attracts the fish fish is that
[34:31] right and brother branham said that
[34:33] healing was actually the bait right did
[34:36] it
[34:36] attract the person to christ healing
[34:39] does
[34:40] well well satan has lures too and he's
[34:43] trying to lure
[34:44] us away from approaching god from
[34:47] praying
[34:49] and he'll he'll use work
[34:52] you ever get down your knees and all of
[34:54] a sudden you're thinking about work
[34:57] how about the honeydew list one of our
[35:00] many responsibilities
[35:03] a project or a goal that we have
[35:06] or you had a rough day and it's time to
[35:10] relax unwind and and and
[35:13] hey even be entertained
[35:16] and these are all lures
[35:19] to keep us from approaching god in
[35:21] prayer
[35:24] and if you can overcome all those
[35:27] then the devil may use another bait
[35:31] like i'll pray as i'm driving there
[35:37] or i'll pray when i'm doing this or
[35:40] doing that
[35:42] and i believe we should always be
[35:44] praying no matter what but you know we
[35:46] need to
[35:47] to have designated time for prayer as
[35:48] well
[35:51] or he'll say it doesn't seem to make a
[35:54] difference when i pray anyways
[35:57] things really don't change for me and
[36:00] all those
[36:01] things keep us from approaching god
[36:04] amen well i'll just ask somebody else to
[36:07] pray for me
[36:09] i know they'll pray if i ask them that's
[36:12] a good one
[36:12] to keep you from approaching god
[36:16] satan pat you on the back and says you
[36:18] got this handled you don't even need to
[36:20] pray about it
[36:22] how about that one that's a good one
[36:26] oh i'll wait and i'll just pray
[36:29] when i get to church i'll pray later
[36:34] but that don't happen either
[36:37] how about god knows my heart i talk to
[36:39] him all the time
[36:46] there ought to be to me more people
[36:48] saying amen to all this stuff i don't
[36:53] just because you have this pure desire
[36:56] to pray doesn't mean the devil
[36:58] is going to roll over and let it happen
[37:00] without a fight
[37:05] the third this is i just want to catch
[37:07] your attention this the third from the
[37:09] last thing the devil wants
[37:11] is for you to approach god i know you've
[37:14] never heard that statement before
[37:16] the third from the last thing we're
[37:19] going to talk about the third and the
[37:20] second
[37:21] and god willing monday we'll talk about
[37:22] the first
[37:26] in the message jesus christ is saying
[37:27] yesterday and today and forever
[37:30] brother branham says when you fall to
[37:32] your knees in prayer
[37:34] even the devil's tremble to the weakest
[37:37] of them
[37:38] amen he said think of it
[37:41] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[37:46] well the devil doesn't want you
[37:48] approaching god
[37:50] that's why he works we don't think we
[37:52] think it's just all this
[37:53] other stuff that's going on out here
[37:56] that's really not it what it is is the
[37:58] devil's working on all this
[38:00] external stuff and then he begins to
[38:02] work in the mine
[38:05] because he don't want you in contact
[38:08] with god
[38:10] he isn't scared of us right no sir not
[38:13] at all
[38:14] he's scared of the one who we're
[38:16] approaching
[38:20] so all the guns are pointed at us to
[38:21] keep us from even
[38:23] starting in prayer
[38:26] so always bear in mind when you set out
[38:28] to approach god in prayer
[38:30] you're entering a war zone you're going
[38:32] to encounter
[38:34] spiritual warfare amen
[38:38] you don't just pray when you feel like
[38:40] it right
[38:42] you don't just pray when you need to
[38:44] pray but you pray always
[38:48] it's it's it's it's a part of a
[38:50] christian's life
[38:51] amen is true so when you settle to pray
[38:54] prepare yourself
[38:55] for battle you must be
[38:59] violent take possession
[39:02] of your time by force don't allow all
[39:06] these excuses
[39:08] to get in your way be violent take take
[39:11] possession of your time
[39:13] you must not let things stand in your
[39:15] way you're going to make up your mind
[39:17] you've got to be determined
[39:19] press into the kingdom
[39:23] even though it's the father's good
[39:24] pleasure to give you the kingdom
[39:26] it won't be handed over to you you've
[39:28] got to press into it
[39:30] amen so don't let things distract you
[39:33] and keep you away from approaching god
[39:36] in prayer now once
[39:39] you're determined and you have started
[39:40] your approach i say
[39:42] fasten your seat belts the ride is going
[39:46] to get turbulent
[39:48] i stated the third from the last thing
[39:50] the devil
[39:52] doesn't want you doing is approaching
[39:54] god the second from the last thing
[39:56] is he doesn't want you to continue to
[39:58] approach god
[39:59] so you enter into the spirit
[40:02] he'd rather have you just you know being
[40:04] carnal in your prayers
[40:07] he don't want you praying but god forbid
[40:11] that you would enter into the spirit of
[40:13] god he'd really be in trouble then see
[40:17] this is where the battle picks up this
[40:18] is where it rages
[40:20] this is when we begin to recognize the
[40:23] spiritual warfare that's going on in our
[40:25] minds
[40:26] the imaginations and the reasonings take
[40:29] a front seat in our thoughts
[40:33] like god isn't going to listen to me
[40:36] anyways
[40:38] god isn't going to answer my prayers
[40:42] it doesn't matter anyways what's the use
[40:45] now these are real thoughts that happen
[40:49] when you finally get down and you get
[40:51] down your knees and you say i'm gonna
[40:53] pray
[40:54] the devil ain't gonna lay back this is
[40:56] the stuff he starts throwing at you
[40:59] he'll throw at you well you don't feel
[41:01] his presence he must not be here
[41:06] i feel the same way as when i don't pray
[41:08] so what's the use
[41:11] my my prayers don't seem to be very
[41:13] effectual they're not getting anything
[41:14] accomplished
[41:17] our minds often can drift off into some
[41:21] unintentional location
[41:24] you ever had that happen it's like what
[41:26] am i doing over there
[41:28] i thought i made a decision because that
[41:31] isn't
[41:32] that's satan he doesn't want you to
[41:36] press in
[41:38] but you can't get it in the spirit
[41:40] unless you press in amen
[41:42] his spirit ain't going to come just
[41:44] because you're a believer in the message
[41:49] we end up thinking unintentional
[41:51] thoughts
[41:52] you ever start thinking negative about
[41:54] somebody
[41:55] read in prayer write in prayer
[42:02] sometimes we can just drift off in some
[42:04] place that we end up saying lord i'm
[42:06] sorry for thinking those thoughts
[42:08] and here we are getting ready to sit
[42:10] down or
[42:11] kneel down and and pray
[42:14] because a weak mind a mind that is not
[42:17] focused a mind that is so uh
[42:21] open to anything
[42:24] it's just an easy
[42:27] easy attack for the devil
[42:32] the spiritual warfare goes from outside
[42:35] things that i got to do to inside
[42:39] to real
[42:43] just to me hideous thoughts that god
[42:46] doesn't hear me
[42:47] it doesn't make a difference
[42:52] because these last ditch efforts to try
[42:55] to keep us
[42:56] from pressing in
[42:59] currently it's easy to just oh yeah i
[43:01] got to do that oh yeah
[43:04] take care of those things
[43:07] i'll just pray when i'm working on it
[43:10] i went over to the church the other day
[43:11] before i started working i said i'm
[43:13] going to pray first
[43:16] just pray first sure you can pray while
[43:19] you work
[43:20] but spend some time with the lord press
[43:24] it
[43:26] satan will throw thoughts at you to
[43:28] combat
[43:29] every thing that you try to do
[43:32] to pray and we have to learn
[43:35] to cast them down amen that's all there
[43:38] is to it
[43:38] whoever wrote this question i just want
[43:40] to say it like this
[43:43] satan is allowed to come to you and
[43:45] battle you
[43:47] it's up to you to cast the thoughts down
[43:50] amen
[43:52] imaginations the distractions of the
[43:55] mind
[43:56] the reasonings
[44:00] to not lead your own understanding you
[44:02] ever do that in prayer
[44:04] lean to your own understanding don't
[44:07] lean to your own
[44:07] understanding it's time to engage
[44:11] in the heat of the battle and put your
[44:14] faith and trust in god and not lean to
[44:16] your own understanding
[44:18] trust the lord because if you're ever
[44:22] going to enter into the spirit when you
[44:23] pray you're going to have to press
[44:26] it just don't happen when you get down
[44:28] to pray you're not automatically in the
[44:30] spirit
[44:34] i say start praying like your prayers
[44:37] are what's going to get the job done
[44:40] pray like your prayers is really what
[44:43] it's going to take to get the job done
[44:46] pray like things are going to fall apart
[44:48] without your prayers
[44:53] pray like your prayers are what's
[44:55] keeping things
[44:56] going as good as they are going
[44:59] pray like you're a child of the king
[45:02] amen
[45:03] don't forget who you are don't let the
[45:08] devil try to feed you a bunch of garbage
[45:10] because that's what he's doing
[45:12] don't let him try to steal your identity
[45:15] if thou
[45:15] be a son of god then why did this happen
[45:18] to you
[45:20] if that'll be a son of god why why'd you
[45:22] get so upset
[45:24] why'd you fly off the handle why do you
[45:26] keep missing church
[45:30] why did you stop going to church
[45:34] if thou be a son if thou be a daughter
[45:42] prayer works prayer works
[45:47] sure it don't feel like it does but it
[45:49] works
[45:51] if we really knew how our prayers
[45:55] were effective in the spiritual realm if
[45:57] we could really see that
[46:00] we just got to believe
[46:04] prayer is a vital part of a christian
[46:05] walk jesus said men ought to
[46:08] always pray and not to faith
[46:13] always pray prayer sustains the believer
[46:17] it gives him spiritual strength you stop
[46:20] praying and you get weak
[46:25] isaiah chapter 40 verse 30. now i'll say
[46:28] this i don't know
[46:28] how you're feeling today i don't really
[46:30] care how you're feeling today
[46:32] i am speaking to the believers to sons
[46:34] and daughters of
[46:35] god amen that believe
[46:39] you say amen to the word amen not to
[46:43] your feelings
[46:44] don't lower yourself to say amen to how
[46:46] you feel
[46:47] amen stay with the word isaiah chapter
[46:50] 40 verse 30
[46:51] even the youths shall
[46:54] faint and be weary
[46:58] and the young men shall utterly
[47:02] fall so it doesn't matter how old you
[47:04] are
[47:05] this thing that happens it happens to
[47:07] the young amen
[47:09] verse 31 but they that wait upon the
[47:12] lord
[47:13] shall renew their strength
[47:20] you're spending on time in prayer
[47:23] waiting for the spirit to come
[47:26] come on now he's here he's everywhere
[47:29] but that doesn't mean i'm connected to
[47:31] him doesn't mean i'm in the spirit
[47:36] so you got to wait upon him you wait
[47:38] there long enough you start getting
[47:40] stronger
[47:41] you start to feel his presence
[47:44] now let's look at verse 29 he giveth
[47:47] power to the faint
[47:49] to them that have no might he increaseth
[47:54] strength so it doesn't matter today
[47:57] where you feel you're at with god and
[48:00] how low you
[48:01] are you can have no strength no power
[48:03] but
[48:04] god promised to give it to you
[48:07] all you have to do is follow the word
[48:09] wait on the lord
[48:11] amen i don't care if you don't feel like
[48:13] it
[48:15] make a decision be determined the rest
[48:18] of verse 31
[48:19] they shall mow up with wings as eagles
[48:22] they shall run and not be weary
[48:24] and they shall not
[48:27] and they shall not faint they shall walk
[48:30] and not
[48:30] faint amen what a promise
[48:35] now sometimes you know when we're going
[48:37] through tests and trials
[48:39] we don't even feel like doing anything
[48:40] we ain't got strength to do anything
[48:42] right we just can't wait for this thing
[48:45] to be over
[48:47] but here's a promise that we can go
[48:49] through our trials
[48:51] with strength yes amen we can we can be
[48:54] egos because we are an ego
[48:58] so let's act like it amen i don't feel
[49:01] like it
[49:03] so did jesus ever say does thou feel
[49:07] right never said it
[49:10] men ought always to pray and not
[49:14] faint so prayer
[49:17] puts us in a category of being strong in
[49:20] the lord
[49:20] amen but laodicea makes it hard for all
[49:24] of us to pray
[49:26] lazy believers who focus is
[49:30] on well jesus paid it all
[49:34] jesus takes care of everything jesus is
[49:37] in charge
[49:41] it's as if they don't know their
[49:43] position with god they don't
[49:45] understand where prayer comes in
[49:50] god moves according to our confession
[49:54] according to what we confess what we
[49:58] profess
[49:58] how we pray if thou canst believe
[50:01] all things are possible but if you just
[50:04] like nothing matters anymore
[50:07] that's laodicea nothing matters
[50:12] lazy believers we're not lazy
[50:18] jesus said take heed to yourself that
[50:21] there's a snare coming upon the face of
[50:23] the earth
[50:25] the whole earth there's a a snare coming
[50:29] well if this ain't the beginning of it i
[50:31] hate to see when it does come
[50:34] luke chapter 21 verse 36 watch ye
[50:37] therefore
[50:38] and what did jesus say pray
[50:41] always that ye may be accounted
[50:46] things that shall come to pass and to
[50:48] stand before
[50:49] the son of man now
[50:53] any moment that you say i can't pray
[50:57] it's too hard to pray i'm struggling
[51:00] to pray as soon as you say that as soon
[51:03] as you confess that did you know
[51:05] it's going to be that much easier not to
[51:07] pray the next time
[51:09] that's right as soon as you give the
[51:13] devil an
[51:14] inch he's going to be ready to get two
[51:17] and then three and then before and then
[51:19] before you know it you can hardly pray
[51:21] about anything amen
[51:25] don't let it be an excuse pray always
[51:29] regardless regardless
[51:33] now i'd rather see you pray
[51:37] not even be in the spirit and pray then
[51:40] not pray at all
[51:44] but don't be satisfied with just praying
[51:46] in the flesh
[51:49] get on to the second thing get in
[51:52] contact with god pray in the spirit
[51:53] there's a difference
[51:55] there's a difference one you're praying
[51:56] from your heart you just can't hardly
[51:58] stop it
[51:59] because it's god inside praying the
[52:02] other
[52:02] is just thoughts and yes
[52:10] when we approach god in prayer we're
[52:12] setting out to unite
[52:14] with god by praying in the spirit see
[52:17] when you get in the spirit you're
[52:19] actually uniting with god
[52:20] amen when you're praying in the flesh
[52:22] you're not
[52:23] united with him your flesh is enmity
[52:26] with him
[52:26] no matter if you're saying the right
[52:28] words
[52:30] you've got to get in the spirit and i
[52:32] know if we're not used to this we need
[52:33] to practice it that's why we need to
[52:35] pray more
[52:35] amen we want to become a spiritual
[52:38] church we need to pray in the spirit
[52:41] it's not getting head knowledge it's
[52:44] getting knee knowledge
[52:48] all day today i was walking around with
[52:49] my knee pads everywhere i went to the
[52:51] store my knees pads around and with the
[52:53] guys in my knee pad
[52:54] i went back to work my knee pads run
[52:58] if you don't have those knee pads when
[52:59] you're working your knees go to
[53:02] especially somebody at my age your knees
[53:05] your knees brother marty knows about the
[53:07] knees
[53:12] i think one thing that we should do is
[53:13] have brother branham talk
[53:15] about having holes in her knees and
[53:18] her pants because we spend a lot of time
[53:22] on our knees
[53:23] say our hearts need to be showing
[53:26] our spirit needs to be showing that we
[53:28] spend a lot of time
[53:29] in prayer our spirits need to be showing
[53:32] that that we're
[53:33] a humble heart
[53:38] so he's not scared of us the devil's not
[53:40] scared of us he's scared of the one
[53:42] we're uniting with
[53:45] greater is he that's in you than he
[53:48] that's in the world see the devil
[53:49] is afraid of the devil i mean the devil
[53:51] is afraid of
[53:53] god that's inside you you know if i
[53:57] if i never said anything right i know
[54:00] you'd get the message
[54:02] i know you still get it
[54:10] and when we get in the spirit i just
[54:11] want to say there's much greater results
[54:14] of the effectual fervent prayer of a
[54:16] righteous man it avails much
[54:19] prayer is such a vital part to a
[54:22] christian
[54:23] but praying in the spirit i'll say it
[54:25] like this is essential
[54:27] if we expect to be the bride of christ
[54:29] we've got to get in the spirit
[54:31] god is the spirit they that worship god
[54:33] must worship him in spirit we must
[54:35] pray in the same vein where god is at
[54:37] amen
[54:38] romans chapter 8 verse 36
[54:41] romans 8 verse 26
[54:44] likewise the spirit also helped with our
[54:48] infirmities
[54:50] for we know not what we
[54:53] should pray for as we
[54:57] ought that is so contrary to carnal
[54:59] thinking
[55:00] amen carl thinking says i know how to
[55:03] pray i know what i need to pray
[55:04] i know exactly i know how this
[55:08] that's carnality that's like taking away
[55:12] the mind of god
[55:14] but the spirit itself maketh
[55:17] intercession
[55:18] for us with groanings
[55:22] which cannot be uttered
[55:26] and he that searcheth the hearts
[55:30] knoweth the mind of the spirit because
[55:32] he maketh
[55:33] intercession for the saints according
[55:37] to the will of god
[55:42] but we're going to think we know
[55:45] the will of god when we're praying for
[55:48] somebody
[55:55] i'll tell you you know there's a good
[55:56] chance that you're in the spirit when
[55:58] you're actually praying for somebody
[56:01] because the scripture just told us that
[56:04] the spirit
[56:05] maketh intercession for the saints
[56:10] that goes along with the nature of
[56:12] christ living for others
[56:15] caring for others thinking about others
[56:18] i'll tell you i'll just be this is just
[56:21] my personal testimony
[56:23] i'm struggling you start praying for
[56:25] somebody
[56:28] and all of a sudden you'll feel the
[56:30] presence of god
[56:33] but you're stuck praying about yourself
[56:35] something you got going on some needs
[56:37] you got
[56:37] i'm telling you sometimes it's hard but
[56:40] you begin to pray with others it seems
[56:42] like you touch the heart of god
[56:45] all suddenly he just comes and he shows
[56:47] he's pleased
[56:48] with your prayer and it's according
[56:52] to this scripture right here he maketh
[56:56] intercession for the saints according to
[56:58] the will of god
[57:01] if we pray continue
[57:05] if we continue to pray in our flesh
[57:07] we'll never break through to the spirit
[57:11] so we got to recognize it's good that
[57:12] we're praying it's good that we're here
[57:14] it's good that we took time
[57:15] from our busy day it's good that we're
[57:18] uh
[57:18] trying to battle all these thoughts in
[57:20] our head and continue to pray
[57:22] putting in our time but don't stop there
[57:26] don't stop until you get into the spirit
[57:30] ephesians chapter 6 verse 18
[57:34] praying always with
[57:37] all prayer and supplications
[57:40] in the spirit well brother john
[57:44] you do you just you never taught us how
[57:47] to do that
[57:52] i am not the teacher of that
[57:56] i am the teacher that tells you pray
[57:59] until the spirit comes
[58:06] god will come and when he comes you will
[58:09] automatically know the difference
[58:11] when he's not there
[58:15] watching there unto with all
[58:18] perseverance
[58:19] and supplication here it is again for
[58:22] all saints
[58:23] god is interested in all of us yes
[58:26] god is interested in what we're all
[58:28] going through
[58:37] billy graham told the
[58:42] true meaning of prayer when he said
[58:43] prayer is a simple
[58:45] two-way conversation between you and god
[58:50] but praying in the flesh is just us
[58:53] talking
[58:55] one way it is not the body's posture
[59:00] but the heart's attitude that counts
[59:02] when we pray
[59:04] prayer is not using is not
[59:07] our using of god i love this prayer
[59:10] is not our using of god it is more often
[59:14] puts us in a position
[59:15] where god can use us yes
[59:20] he's the powder we're the clay amen
[59:24] prayer can be a tough battle when we're
[59:27] praying with a carnal mind
[59:29] romans 8 verse 7 says because the carnal
[59:31] mind is enmity against god for it is not
[59:34] subject to the law of god
[59:35] neither indeed can it be so then they
[59:37] that are in the flesh
[59:38] cannot please god so when you're
[59:41] you know you're in the flesh
[59:44] and you're praying and that's all that
[59:47] you're going to do is stay in the flesh
[59:49] i'm telling you your prayer is not even
[59:50] making god happy
[59:54] but if you stay there in your carnal
[59:56] mind
[59:57] and you say i am not happy
[1:00:00] with the thoughts that i'm thinking the
[1:00:02] things that are going through
[1:00:04] my half-hearted prayers just trying to
[1:00:06] put in my time i am determined
[1:00:08] to get beyond this that's when you will
[1:00:10] bring happiness to god
[1:00:12] when you will please god when you break
[1:00:14] through that thing
[1:00:21] it's not the action of how hard it is to
[1:00:25] pray but it's the reaction
[1:00:27] that counts what are you going to do
[1:00:29] with that
[1:00:31] the goal of every prayer warrior ought
[1:00:33] to be
[1:00:35] to labor until he enters into the spirit
[1:00:39] because that's what makes your prayers
[1:00:41] effective
[1:00:42] is when the spirit is making
[1:00:44] intercession through you
[1:00:46] amen whatever you say
[1:00:51] well i don't want honestly
[1:00:55] i don't want to pray without god praying
[1:00:58] through me
[1:01:00] because i don't know how to pray brother
[1:01:03] john how long have you been serving the
[1:01:05] lord
[1:01:06] long enough to read this bible that
[1:01:08] tells me i don't know how to pray
[1:01:12] and i am just dumb enough to believe it
[1:01:16] stay with the word amen god
[1:01:19] wants to pray through us
[1:01:23] we should want it as much
[1:01:29] praying through just doesn't happen
[1:01:31] after 15 minutes
[1:01:35] everybody's got their routine of prayer
[1:01:37] right i've got my routine
[1:01:42] and when you're done doing your routine
[1:01:46] sometimes you feel like it was just a
[1:01:50] routine
[1:01:52] and you should break the routine and
[1:01:55] pray
[1:01:56] until he comes and then sometimes you
[1:01:59] pray
[1:02:00] and you feel his presence
[1:02:05] we're grateful for that but it just
[1:02:08] doesn't happen automatically
[1:02:10] sometimes we're battling these thoughts
[1:02:13] how to combat
[1:02:15] these thoughts that are happening you
[1:02:18] have to combat them amen
[1:02:20] you have to press through them you have
[1:02:23] to say i'm not settling for this i'm not
[1:02:25] listening to this
[1:02:27] i'm believing for a personal contact
[1:02:31] with my savior
[1:02:36] when we approach god we need to get into
[1:02:38] the spirit
[1:02:40] we need to be determined to press
[1:02:42] through all those carnal thoughts
[1:02:44] they're not going away on their own
[1:02:46] we've got to cast him down as we said
[1:02:49] second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3
[1:02:51] all these these thoughts that we get
[1:02:53] when we're praying
[1:02:53] they're just strongholds they're trying
[1:02:56] to keep us from entering
[1:02:57] in to the spirit and just you know what
[1:03:00] it's like just to be in prayer and
[1:03:01] you're worshiping you're crying
[1:03:03] and you're just so in love with him you
[1:03:04] just do anything you want you to do
[1:03:08] come on when you get in the spirit you
[1:03:12] tell me are you really battling
[1:03:14] those thoughts of
[1:03:17] you know you're not really
[1:03:20] isn't going to matter his presence is so
[1:03:23] strong
[1:03:24] you would never entertain those thoughts
[1:03:29] it's it those thoughts bother you when
[1:03:31] you haven't
[1:03:32] entered into that place and that they're
[1:03:34] there for it
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:36] there's something else that happens
[1:03:38] after you get into the presence of the
[1:03:39] lord though
[1:03:40] see satan he don't quit he don't quit
[1:03:44] we're in a battle that's right we're in
[1:03:46] the battle second corinthians 10 3
[1:03:48] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:03:50] not war after
[1:03:52] the flesh for the weapons of our warfare
[1:03:54] they're not carnal
[1:03:56] but they're very very mighty through god
[1:04:00] to the pulling down of strongholds so
[1:04:02] when you say
[1:04:03] how many times have you been in prayer
[1:04:04] and these thoughts just keep coming
[1:04:06] you're oh i wish i wouldn't think i just
[1:04:07] got
[1:04:08] oh and you're trying to not think them
[1:04:10] and then you
[1:04:11] you try and then you go right back to
[1:04:13] them has that ever happened to you
[1:04:16] am i just preaching to myself okay
[1:04:20] well you need something stronger than
[1:04:22] you just well you know i don't i guess
[1:04:24] you gotta try a little bit harder
[1:04:26] stand up and say in the name of jesus
[1:04:27] christ get behind me satan
[1:04:30] verbally say it get serious with it
[1:04:35] because god will honor your stand
[1:04:40] casting down imaginations
[1:04:44] and every high thing that exalteth
[1:04:47] itself against the knowledge of god what
[1:04:49] is the knowledge of god pray in the
[1:04:50] spirit
[1:04:51] that's the knowledge of god right now we
[1:04:54] have that knowledge
[1:04:56] and if anything tells you well you don't
[1:04:58] got to do that just you know god hears
[1:04:59] your prayers no matter what you do
[1:05:01] that's a high thing that's a high thing
[1:05:04] that's exalting
[1:05:05] itself against the knowledge of god we
[1:05:07] need to take serious the importance
[1:05:09] of praying in the spirit amen
[1:05:12] and bring into captivity every thought
[1:05:16] to the obedience of christ
[1:05:20] that is literally the responsibility for
[1:05:22] every believer
[1:05:24] to harness your own thoughts
[1:05:28] and having in a readiness to revenge
[1:05:32] all the disobedience that we've done
[1:05:35] when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:05:39] is that beautiful it's hard praying
[1:05:44] until you break through the flesh into
[1:05:45] the spiritual realm it is hard
[1:05:48] it's a battle there's a lot of
[1:05:50] turbulence
[1:05:51] that we may encounter
[1:05:54] just like chuck yeager some of you know
[1:05:57] chuck yeager
[1:05:59] he was a u.s air force captain who was
[1:06:02] the first person to fly faster
[1:06:04] than the speed of thumb mr yeager
[1:06:07] he actually died last year he was the
[1:06:10] first one to experience
[1:06:11] breaking the sound barrier in 1947
[1:06:15] despite having just suffered several
[1:06:18] crap
[1:06:19] cracked ribs during a fall from his
[1:06:22] horse
[1:06:23] jaeger was remarkable had great
[1:06:26] courage and was determined to push
[1:06:28] through new limits
[1:06:30] and during the test flight he ignored
[1:06:33] listen to this
[1:06:34] the terrifying turbulence that was
[1:06:37] all around him and shattered forever the
[1:06:40] myth
[1:06:41] of an impenetrable sound barrier
[1:06:45] and that's the way you need to look at
[1:06:47] it when you want to enter into the
[1:06:49] spirit
[1:06:51] there's a lot of turbulence getting
[1:06:53] there but once you enter in
[1:06:56] there is peace sublime it's calm
[1:07:00] it's a beautiful atmosphere
[1:07:03] and it was worth pressing in
[1:07:07] i want us to type the breaking through
[1:07:08] the sound bearers breaking through
[1:07:10] our carnal mind our carnal thoughts and
[1:07:12] entering into the spiritual realm of
[1:07:14] prayer
[1:07:16] we need to ignore the terrifying
[1:07:18] turbulence in our minds when we're
[1:07:19] praying
[1:07:20] just ignore it don't give to it
[1:07:24] ignore it and with courage press
[1:07:27] in to new to to to tune limits to a
[1:07:30] place
[1:07:31] where maybe it's been a while since you
[1:07:33] prayed in the spirit
[1:07:35] maybe you've been listening to the enemy
[1:07:37] saying well as long as you pray that's
[1:07:38] all that matters
[1:07:40] man don't listen to that thing before
[1:07:42] you know it he'll get you in a bad habit
[1:07:45] this is a bad habit i want us to have a
[1:07:49] testimony i pray through
[1:07:51] i pray for you because when you pray
[1:07:52] through you'll get the victory you'll
[1:07:54] get joy unspeakable
[1:07:56] full of glory you'll feel you're on
[1:07:58] cloud nine it won't be hard to give up
[1:07:59] your life give up your will
[1:08:04] but you pray in the flesh you still hold
[1:08:06] on to your will
[1:08:08] here's some quotes of chuck yeager
[1:08:11] he said i noticed that the faster i got
[1:08:15] the smoother the ride
[1:08:18] suddenly that mock needle began to
[1:08:20] fluctuate it went up to
[1:08:22] 0.965 mock well
[1:08:25] probably need brother bruce or brother
[1:08:27] uh
[1:08:28] marty to tell us what all that means
[1:08:32] mark wants to speed us up see there you
[1:08:34] go i told you
[1:08:35] i told you you don't even got to study
[1:08:38] that's something about you just you got
[1:08:39] it you know it
[1:08:42] he said then tipped right off the scale
[1:08:45] he says we were flying supersonic
[1:08:49] it was as smooth as a baby's bottom
[1:08:54] that's what he said he said grandma
[1:08:56] could be sitting up there
[1:08:58] sipping lemonade
[1:09:02] that's what happens when you break
[1:09:04] through to the spirit
[1:09:07] there's no more turbulence you're flying
[1:09:10] faster you're an eagle you're flying
[1:09:12] above the things of the world
[1:09:14] these little things down here aren't
[1:09:15] bothering you anymore that used to
[1:09:17] bother
[1:09:17] these little things these little things
[1:09:19] people did people said
[1:09:21] little thoughts that we're having you
[1:09:24] get up there
[1:09:25] nothing matters because you're in the
[1:09:27] mind of christ now that spirit will just
[1:09:30] make intercession whatever
[1:09:31] god will put on your heart what to pray
[1:09:33] at that time
[1:09:35] god is in control
[1:09:40] he said you don't concentrate on the
[1:09:43] risk
[1:09:44] what if i don't pray through i'll just
[1:09:46] get let down again
[1:09:48] he said you don't concentrate on the
[1:09:51] risk
[1:09:52] you concentrate on the results so you
[1:09:55] keep your vision
[1:09:57] on praying through to that other realm
[1:10:01] who cares about the battle all the
[1:10:03] noises everything that's going on
[1:10:06] he said what good does it do to be
[1:10:09] afraid
[1:10:10] he says it doesn't help anything right
[1:10:14] don't be afraid don't be afraid
[1:10:18] well what if i don't pray through don't
[1:10:19] be afraid
[1:10:21] don't be afraid of that think about
[1:10:24] yesterday when you didn't even try as
[1:10:25] hard you're going to get that much
[1:10:28] closer
[1:10:30] david had to pray 21 days to get an
[1:10:32] answer
[1:10:35] yeah you know we're not going to make it
[1:10:37] on the floor we've got ease
[1:10:40] one thing that i admire about
[1:10:44] uh what they teach in the armed forces
[1:10:47] is disciplined
[1:10:49] they teach you duty and they teach you
[1:10:51] responsibility
[1:10:54] it has nothing to do about how you feel
[1:10:58] they don't come out and say how do you
[1:10:59] feel today
[1:11:01] unless they got something sarcastic to
[1:11:03] say afterwards
[1:11:08] but chuck yeager said the one word you
[1:11:11] use
[1:11:11] in the military flying is duty it's your
[1:11:14] duty
[1:11:15] you have no control over the outcome no
[1:11:18] control
[1:11:18] over pick and choose is duty
[1:11:22] so i'll say it like this men ought
[1:11:24] always to pray
[1:11:25] and not faint it's a duty look at it as
[1:11:29] a duty
[1:11:30] amen don't look at it as labor to see it
[1:11:32] you got a choice
[1:11:35] because the devil will talk you out of
[1:11:37] it amen
[1:11:39] unchanging certain fact he said the best
[1:11:43] the most skillful pilot has the most
[1:11:46] experience
[1:11:48] in other words the more you pray the
[1:11:50] more experience you'll have
[1:11:52] at battling the devil and entering into
[1:11:54] the spirit amen
[1:11:57] brother branham says when he got down
[1:11:59] and he heard
[1:12:00] uh annie pray
[1:12:04] you know what i'm talking about
[1:12:07] uh aunt jemima i think he might have
[1:12:09] called her
[1:12:11] he says when she got down to pray he
[1:12:13] said one thing was for sure
[1:12:16] he knew that she had talked to her
[1:12:18] before
[1:12:20] and i'll tell you when the more you pray
[1:12:22] in the spirit the better you get
[1:12:25] at praying in the spirit because you
[1:12:27] have to deny the flesh
[1:12:29] you have to give up will you have to you
[1:12:31] have to seek god
[1:12:33] with everything you shall seek me and
[1:12:34] find me when you search for me with all
[1:12:36] your heart god wants to see
[1:12:38] more of you amen
[1:12:42] maybe not the i i was talking to david
[1:12:44] bailey
[1:12:46] oh i mentioned his name that's okay it
[1:12:48] doesn't matter
[1:12:50] he got back from a two-week vacation i
[1:12:52] asked and it was not really a true
[1:12:54] vacation it was a vacation where
[1:12:56] he had baseball tournaments and he took
[1:12:58] he's in charge of a key
[1:13:00] team and he took them all down there and
[1:13:03] um he was telling me about
[1:13:06] uh some of the parents you know came to
[1:13:09] him and were complaining to him
[1:13:11] because their kid didn't get to play
[1:13:12] very much
[1:13:15] and of course you know you you you do
[1:13:17] your best and
[1:13:19] and he told him you know ahead of time
[1:13:21] you know everybody's not going to get
[1:13:22] that play this is not low league
[1:13:23] we don't do a little league where
[1:13:24] everybody just get the plays equal
[1:13:26] these are big kids this travel team
[1:13:32] and um
[1:13:35] so some of them uh got to sit out
[1:13:41] but there were certain kids who did not
[1:13:44] have
[1:13:44] much talent oh but they played with a
[1:13:48] big heart
[1:13:50] they played with so much heart he
[1:13:52] actually played them more
[1:13:53] right why because they put more of their
[1:13:56] heart
[1:13:57] into the game
[1:14:02] i think god will use this more when we
[1:14:04] put our heart into the game
[1:14:07] he said when you search for me with all
[1:14:09] your heart he's looking to play those
[1:14:11] people not how much talent we got
[1:14:15] not our our position or what we think
[1:14:19] but heart he said the best pilots fly
[1:14:23] more than others that's why they're the
[1:14:24] best
[1:14:26] i say we need to put on the whole armor
[1:14:28] of god when we're getting ready to
[1:14:29] approach god put on the whole
[1:14:31] armor of god pray always with all
[1:14:33] supplication
[1:14:34] for all the saints amen
[1:14:38] satan doesn't want us to pray he
[1:14:40] trembles when the weakest
[1:14:42] of us begin to pray amen
[1:14:46] and if we do pray he certainly doesn't
[1:14:47] want us to enter into the spirit
[1:14:50] that's going to even make it harder
[1:14:53] so i like to keep in mind a fixed goal
[1:14:56] when i pray
[1:14:59] i notice a long time ago if i just pray
[1:15:03] quietly when i'm not in the spirit when
[1:15:06] i'm
[1:15:07] in the carnal flesh my mind has a
[1:15:09] tendency
[1:15:10] of drifting yeah before you know it i'm
[1:15:13] thinking
[1:15:14] so many things that you must just not
[1:15:17] even be praying about just sit and think
[1:15:18] about those things
[1:15:21] so as a a small discipline
[1:15:25] i forced myself to pray
[1:15:28] a little bit loud so i can hear now what
[1:15:32] that does
[1:15:32] it forces me and holds my me too
[1:15:35] accountable to the words i'm saying i'm
[1:15:37] actually having to think about him now
[1:15:41] now eventually you'll begin
[1:15:45] to pray from the heart
[1:15:49] at that point you can pray quietly
[1:15:52] at that point if you want to but you
[1:15:55] need
[1:15:56] something to get you praying and getting
[1:15:59] you in contact with god
[1:16:02] amen although other than that it's just
[1:16:04] going to be a a
[1:16:06] quiet thing
[1:16:10] our minds can wander we got to be strong
[1:16:14] that's one way to help it help me
[1:16:18] first be determined to meet god in his
[1:16:21] presence
[1:16:21] when you approach him in prayer be
[1:16:24] determined
[1:16:26] be serious about it second
[1:16:30] always remember to approach god with
[1:16:32] more respect than you
[1:16:34] think yes
[1:16:38] with more respect than you think in
[1:16:40] other words give him
[1:16:41] more than what you think give him
[1:16:46] your heart the right way give them
[1:16:49] your spirit right give them a right
[1:16:51] attitude
[1:16:54] god don't need your arrogant spirit
[1:16:56] around his throne
[1:17:00] he doesn't need your great abilities and
[1:17:02] achievements being flashed before him
[1:17:05] lord i'm glad i'm not like this one and
[1:17:07] i don't and i do this and i he don't
[1:17:09] need that around his throne
[1:17:14] i thank thee lord i'm not like brother
[1:17:15] so-and-so in the church
[1:17:19] oh i paid my ties all last year i even
[1:17:22] gave more than i wanted to
[1:17:25] what does that mean
[1:17:31] if you're not given from your heart it
[1:17:33] ain't going to matter anyways
[1:17:34] god loves a cheerful giver amen
[1:17:38] he doesn't need well at least came to
[1:17:41] church lord
[1:17:42] yeah approach god
[1:17:45] with the greatest respect that you have
[1:17:48] amen smote your breast
[1:17:51] acknowledge that you're not worthy to
[1:17:54] even approach him
[1:17:57] now i know the bible says come boldly to
[1:17:59] the throne of god
[1:18:01] but it doesn't mean come any old way you
[1:18:03] want right
[1:18:04] what that means is god has provided a
[1:18:07] way
[1:18:08] through calvary for you to come that's
[1:18:09] what that means
[1:18:12] he rent the veil for you he made a way
[1:18:15] for you to approach but you still
[1:18:16] have to come before him with respect
[1:18:22] he demands respect amen now think about
[1:18:26] this here we are going through tests
[1:18:27] we're going through trials we're having
[1:18:29] a hard time pressing through
[1:18:30] it doesn't seem like we should even uh
[1:18:33] even try because it
[1:18:34] it doesn't make a difference we feel so
[1:18:36] down on the dumps and
[1:18:37] you know we just don't even feel like
[1:18:39] trying but yet we need to
[1:18:41] respect him when we come
[1:18:46] that's a tall order god's asking why
[1:18:48] isn't he just looking down at me in my
[1:18:50] pitiful condition and just
[1:18:51] take me as he is
[1:18:55] because god deserves more respect than
[1:18:57] that
[1:19:01] you want help for your condition stay
[1:19:04] there till he comes
[1:19:05] wait on the lord he is faithful
[1:19:08] he's a rewarder to them that diligently
[1:19:11] seek him
[1:19:13] but we need to respect him
[1:19:18] we live in an age where people's
[1:19:19] character is lacking respect
[1:19:23] while hate and disrespect are escalating
[1:19:26] in the world
[1:19:27] the love of many are waxing cold right
[1:19:30] in the church
[1:19:32] people are in so in love with themselves
[1:19:35] that they don't have
[1:19:36] time to respect others
[1:19:41] the problem with thinking you can
[1:19:43] respect god without respecting other
[1:19:45] humans
[1:19:45] is insane
[1:19:50] it's insane and it's impossible god is
[1:19:52] no respecter persons
[1:19:55] we saw that with judas he chose judas
[1:20:00] three and a half years just let him be a
[1:20:03] part of whatever he wanted to be a part
[1:20:05] of
[1:20:09] we are told to honor all men especially
[1:20:13] of the household of faith
[1:20:18] that's why when we approach god in
[1:20:20] prayer and we remember
[1:20:21] some
[1:20:25] have ought against us
[1:20:29] or we have ought against another human
[1:20:31] being
[1:20:32] we're supposed to not even offer our
[1:20:34] gift to god
[1:20:36] but to leave it there and first go and
[1:20:39] make things right with other humans
[1:20:42] before we approach god with our gifts is
[1:20:45] that true
[1:20:47] so god is really wanting us to be
[1:20:49] respectful
[1:20:50] amen and jesus says if we don't forgive
[1:20:53] those who trespass against us
[1:20:54] then our heavenly father's not going to
[1:20:56] forgive us
[1:20:59] so we must approach god with respect
[1:21:02] if we're not willing to get serious and
[1:21:04] take care of those things
[1:21:06] then we're not serious enough for god
[1:21:10] how is god going to rain down his spirit
[1:21:12] on you
[1:21:14] no he's he may do it
[1:21:17] he you know he he his rain falls on the
[1:21:19] just and the unjust but
[1:21:20] i wouldn't want that to be my testimony
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:31] god never looks at us as having
[1:21:36] uh disrespect towards him
[1:21:40] he looks at us as having disrespect
[1:21:42] towards others
[1:21:43] and that's disrespecting him
[1:21:49] god looks at us as having the character
[1:21:51] of respect
[1:21:56] or he looks at us as not having the
[1:21:58] character of respect
[1:22:00] it's not something you put on some
[1:22:03] people may have this mentality
[1:22:05] of pushing the pause
[1:22:08] or play button with respect well i'm
[1:22:12] going to respect no i'm not going to
[1:22:13] respect here i'm going to
[1:22:15] respect now but not over here
[1:22:18] but that's not what god
[1:22:22] expects from us and demands from us
[1:22:26] he wants us to respect all the time he
[1:22:29] wants us to be a respectful person to
[1:22:31] one another
[1:22:33] how we think about people
[1:22:36] what we say behind closed doors
[1:22:47] because how you are is really how you
[1:22:49] are when you come to god you just don't
[1:22:50] think it
[1:22:56] don't hit the pause play buttons
[1:22:59] just live a life of respect
[1:23:03] people are listening to what you
[1:23:06] say about others
[1:23:09] i don't care if it's true
[1:23:13] if it's true let me just say this if it
[1:23:16] is true
[1:23:18] you are duty-bound to go wash their feet
[1:23:25] what god didn't tell me but god told you
[1:23:27] to talk about him
[1:23:30] that's how messed up your mind is
[1:23:32] thinking you've got the leadership of
[1:23:34] god
[1:23:34] amen it's not even the nature of god
[1:23:39] try the spirit all right
[1:23:42] learn to live peaceably the bible says
[1:23:45] with all men
[1:23:47] all amen i love this romans 16 verse 20
[1:23:51] and the god of peace shall bruise satan
[1:23:54] under your feet shortly the god of peace
[1:23:59] shall bruise
[1:24:00] satan under your feet
[1:24:03] shortly notice not the god of vengeance
[1:24:06] right the god of peace
[1:24:11] our god is a good god amen
[1:24:14] the bible says that we're to shout our
[1:24:16] feet with the preparation of the gospel
[1:24:17] peace
[1:24:19] jesus said in mark 9 verse 50 have
[1:24:23] sought to your in yourselves
[1:24:24] and have peace one with another amen
[1:24:30] now the god of peace be with you
[1:24:33] all i'll just say it like this you
[1:24:36] respect god when you respect one another
[1:24:39] amen and it's important when you're
[1:24:40] approaching god
[1:24:42] all your relationships that you've had
[1:24:43] out here with people
[1:24:45] you think it don't mean anything but it
[1:24:47] means everything
[1:24:48] yes amen approach god with the utmost
[1:24:53] respect
[1:24:53] and genuine humility humility is the
[1:24:57] best approach
[1:25:00] now humility is not the way you approach
[1:25:03] but a condition of your heart when you
[1:25:05] approach
[1:25:07] there's a difference
[1:25:10] condition of your heart is something
[1:25:11] that is before during
[1:25:14] after right approach could be
[1:25:17] oh yeah i got a yield right now a little
[1:25:20] bit and then after i'm done i can do
[1:25:21] what i want to do
[1:25:23] right but humility
[1:25:26] is who you are
[1:25:30] it's who you are
[1:25:33] he giveth more grace to the humble amen
[1:25:37] not to somebody that approaches him
[1:25:40] humbly and then just acts any way they
[1:25:42] want to afterwards
[1:25:46] god gives more grace to the person whose
[1:25:49] character
[1:25:50] is actually just like him that's what
[1:25:53] he's saying
[1:25:54] there he gives more grace to the
[1:25:56] character that's just like him
[1:25:59] learning me he's lowly in heart
[1:26:05] he's humble we should be too
[1:26:09] a humble and broken spirit
[1:26:12] he would not despise now we're talking
[1:26:15] about
[1:26:16] our approach to god it means everything
[1:26:21] where our motors are at when we get down
[1:26:22] on our knees
[1:26:25] god hates a proud look brother mark
[1:26:29] that was already in my notes when he
[1:26:31] said that today
[1:26:32] amen sowing discord among the
[1:26:36] brethren is another one that was brother
[1:26:38] mark talked about
[1:26:40] in fact he made me read that one he
[1:26:42] didn't even know
[1:26:43] he made me read that but sowing discord
[1:26:47] among uh the people is also something
[1:26:51] god
[1:26:52] hates
[1:26:57] humility will seat god with all its
[1:27:00] heart
[1:27:02] but a proud heart will only give up so
[1:27:04] much
[1:27:06] will only seek god so long to go so far
[1:27:09] and then for whatever reason
[1:27:13] it stops then ye shall call upon me and
[1:27:17] you shall go and pray and i will hearken
[1:27:19] unto you and you shall seek me and find
[1:27:21] me when you search for me with all
[1:27:23] your heart
[1:27:27] let's take a look at the centurion's
[1:27:29] approach he was very humble
[1:27:31] and very respectful he said lord i am
[1:27:34] not worthy
[1:27:34] that thou should has come under my roof
[1:27:36] i am not worthy that your presence
[1:27:38] should come here when i'm praying
[1:27:43] but he is also full of faith
[1:27:46] yes he was humble yet full
[1:27:50] faith don't get it mixed up with
[1:27:52] arrogancy
[1:27:55] and thinking that well i'm just coming
[1:27:58] boldly
[1:28:01] he said but speak the word only and my
[1:28:05] servant shall be healed
[1:28:07] lord just let your presence come and
[1:28:09] pray through me for all your people
[1:28:12] because that's the will of god that's
[1:28:14] the written word of god
[1:28:16] well i don't want to do that i just
[1:28:17] don't have a burden for that that's just
[1:28:19] not where i'm at
[1:28:21] well get where you need to get to right
[1:28:24] amen that's all i can say stay with the
[1:28:27] word get back to the word
[1:28:31] mark chapter or matthew chapter 8 verse
[1:28:33] 10 and when jesus heard it
[1:28:35] when he heard this man and his attitude
[1:28:37] speaking to him
[1:28:39] he marveled and said to them that
[1:28:42] followed
[1:28:43] verily i say unto you i have not found
[1:28:46] so great of faith
[1:28:48] no not in israel amen
[1:28:51] so if he came today and he checked all
[1:28:53] of us out
[1:28:57] i'm sure he's looking for faith
[1:29:01] amen when you're
[1:29:04] when you when you get into this spirit
[1:29:06] you've got faith
[1:29:09] because he's there it's just getting
[1:29:12] there
[1:29:13] there's a bunch of doubts rolling in
[1:29:14] your head right amen
[1:29:16] and you got to press through that
[1:29:19] matthew chapter 15 verse 22. i'll try to
[1:29:22] get through a few of these this here
[1:29:24] phoenician woman's approach
[1:29:27] and behold a woman of canaan came out of
[1:29:30] the
[1:29:30] same coast and cried unto him saying
[1:29:33] look at this look at the approach have
[1:29:35] mercy on me
[1:29:36] that's right oh lord thou son of david
[1:29:40] my daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:29:41] devil
[1:29:43] but have mercy on me
[1:29:47] even praying for someone have mercy on
[1:29:49] me because my burden is for
[1:29:52] amen but he answered her not a word
[1:29:56] you ever feel like that when you're
[1:29:57] praying
[1:30:00] we got some scripture here and his
[1:30:02] disciples came and besought him saying
[1:30:04] send her away for she crieth after us so
[1:30:08] there were some other voices
[1:30:13] that were kind of getting on the
[1:30:16] bandwagon
[1:30:17] of ignoring this need
[1:30:20] you ever get a lot of voices coming into
[1:30:22] your head say well it doesn't matter
[1:30:23] your mother just stop praying
[1:30:25] ain't going to make your mouth so just
[1:30:27] go away
[1:30:32] he's doing too many important things to
[1:30:34] to help you
[1:30:39] but he answered and said i am not sent
[1:30:42] but unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:30:45] israel i am not sent
[1:30:46] to help you with your problem i am too
[1:30:49] busy
[1:30:50] helping the bride of jesus christ
[1:30:57] sounds like some things that we've heard
[1:30:59] is it
[1:31:02] but i love her attitude she came
[1:31:05] then came she and what did she do
[1:31:09] she worshipped she's saying
[1:31:12] lord help me she was determined when she
[1:31:15] got on her knees to pray
[1:31:18] she didn't let some little mind battle
[1:31:21] just keep her
[1:31:22] from entering in and receiving what she
[1:31:24] got on her knees for
[1:31:29] but he answered and said it is not meat
[1:31:31] to take the children's bread and just
[1:31:33] you know cast it to you and your your
[1:31:35] little situation
[1:31:39] and she said truth lord
[1:31:43] that's the answer that's the answer the
[1:31:46] lord
[1:31:47] is never wrong whatever he says
[1:31:50] we may not understand but he's never
[1:31:53] wrong
[1:31:54] truth lord yet the dogs they eat the
[1:31:56] crumbs were troubling the master's table
[1:31:58] i mean was she quick-wetted or what
[1:32:03] i think her attitude was a humble
[1:32:07] attitude that had nothing but more
[1:32:10] and more respect to the lord
[1:32:17] then jesus answered and sent to her oh
[1:32:19] woman
[1:32:20] you got my attention great is thy faith
[1:32:24] be it unto thee even is thou will
[1:32:28] and her daughter was made whole from
[1:32:29] that very hour amen
[1:32:32] your devil is is not going to just roll
[1:32:35] over because you get down on your knees
[1:32:36] or you have a thought i'm going to pray
[1:32:38] and i'm going to
[1:32:39] press in i'm saying you got every demon
[1:32:41] coming at you you're going to try to
[1:32:42] stop it
[1:32:45] but prayer is very vital for us
[1:32:51] be determined when you pray keep your
[1:32:55] respect for god no matter what he does
[1:32:57] no matter what he says no matter how you
[1:32:59] feel keep your respect
[1:33:01] for god
[1:33:05] blind better turn with me if you would
[1:33:08] to
[1:33:09] mark chapter 10.
[1:33:13] what an approach he had when jesus got
[1:33:16] to a place where there was a blind man
[1:33:19] there was a physical need basically
[1:33:21] blind bartimaeus began to cry out
[1:33:24] saying jesus thou son of david look the
[1:33:26] same words
[1:33:27] have mercy on me now the reason i'm i
[1:33:31] want to bring this
[1:33:32] is a lot of times when we approach god
[1:33:34] do we really come with the heart of lord
[1:33:36] have mercy on me or do we feel like
[1:33:40] we're a little bit beyond that it's
[1:33:42] really good
[1:33:44] don't get beyond that don't always plead
[1:33:48] for the mercies of god
[1:33:51] in verse 48 mark chapter 10 verse 48
[1:33:55] many charged him that he should hold his
[1:33:58] peace
[1:33:59] here he goes more voices but what did he
[1:34:02] do
[1:34:03] he started praying out loud a little bit
[1:34:05] more and he cried the more a great deal
[1:34:08] thou son of david have mercy on me i
[1:34:10] don't care all this is praying i'm gonna
[1:34:12] i'm gonna just get a holy god i don't
[1:34:16] care what's happening i don't care what
[1:34:17] my
[1:34:18] thoughts are i don't care how i'm
[1:34:19] feeling all the more i'm gonna cry out
[1:34:24] and jesus stood still and commanded him
[1:34:27] to be called
[1:34:30] but if you just quit you're not seeking
[1:34:32] them with all your heart
[1:34:36] and they called the blind man saying
[1:34:38] unto him be of good cheer
[1:34:39] arise he calleth thee and he casting
[1:34:43] away his garment rolls and came to jesus
[1:34:45] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:34:48] what will thou that i should do unto
[1:34:50] thee
[1:34:50] the blind man said unto him lord that i
[1:34:53] might receive my sight
[1:34:55] there's a healing a physical need in his
[1:34:57] body
[1:34:59] and jesus said unto him go thy way
[1:35:02] thy faith may thee whole
[1:35:07] we need faith when we approach god
[1:35:10] don't leave that out don't just bring
[1:35:13] your need
[1:35:14] without faith
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:18] because without faith it's impossible to
[1:35:20] please him even though the need is great
[1:35:22] and he has compassion on you
[1:35:23] you must bring faith that he will take
[1:35:25] care of that need
[1:35:28] that's i think a lot of times where we
[1:35:30] fail when we don't
[1:35:32] bring faith we're not really respecting
[1:35:35] god
[1:35:38] all right luke chapter 8 verse 40. let's
[1:35:41] take a look at the woman with the blood
[1:35:43] issue her approach
[1:35:49] and it came to pass that when jesus was
[1:35:51] returned the people gladly received him
[1:35:53] for they were all waiting for him
[1:35:57] and behold there came a man named jarius
[1:36:00] and he was a ruler of the synagogue and
[1:36:02] he fell down at jesus's feet and he
[1:36:03] besought him
[1:36:04] that he would come into his house for he
[1:36:07] had
[1:36:08] one only daughter about 12 years of age
[1:36:11] and
[1:36:12] she lay a dying but as
[1:36:15] he went the people thronged him
[1:36:19] so there's a lot of noise happening
[1:36:21] right now a lot of
[1:36:23] noise happening you have a loud noise
[1:36:26] happening when you're praying
[1:36:28] like i just wish all these thoughts
[1:36:30] would just stop right
[1:36:32] and a woman having an issue of blood
[1:36:35] again 12 years which
[1:36:39] had spent all of her living upon the
[1:36:42] physicians
[1:36:42] neither could be healed of any so you
[1:36:45] know
[1:36:46] she's coming with all her heart
[1:36:51] he came behind him and touched just the
[1:36:54] border of his garment
[1:36:55] and immediately her issue of blood was
[1:36:59] stenched and jesus
[1:37:03] being a man said who touched me
[1:37:08] who touched me when all denied
[1:37:12] peter and they that were with him said
[1:37:14] master
[1:37:15] there's a multitude of people here
[1:37:19] they're pressing me they're throwing
[1:37:22] thee and you're saying
[1:37:24] who touched me
[1:37:29] notice this had everything to do with
[1:37:31] the woman
[1:37:34] it wasn't the 12 disciples the church
[1:37:37] they all got together
[1:37:39] here's what we're going to do we're
[1:37:40] going to pray over this one person
[1:37:44] there's ways that you can approach god
[1:37:46] in your home
[1:37:49] come on now there's a way to approach
[1:37:51] god
[1:37:52] in your home when there's a lot of stuff
[1:37:54] going on and
[1:37:55] you can still touch the hem of god's
[1:37:58] garment amen
[1:37:59] amen you just need the same thing she
[1:38:02] needed she had
[1:38:03] what did she have she had something with
[1:38:06] that touch
[1:38:08] it was a faith that's why we want to
[1:38:12] get in the spirit that'll touch the
[1:38:14] handle of his garment
[1:38:16] press into that spirit get beyond those
[1:38:20] voices and all that thing that's trying
[1:38:22] to throng and and interfere with you and
[1:38:25] distract you and lure you away from just
[1:38:27] giving up
[1:38:29] press through that thing amen amen
[1:38:34] jesus said somebody had touched me
[1:38:38] for i perceive that strength
[1:38:41] has gone out of me
[1:38:45] god has strength for us he said he would
[1:38:47] renew our strength if we wait upon him
[1:38:51] praise the lord and when the woman saw
[1:38:52] that she was not hit she came trembling
[1:38:54] falling down before him
[1:38:56] she declared unto him before all the
[1:38:58] people for what cause she had touched
[1:39:00] him
[1:39:00] and how she was healed immediately
[1:39:04] and he said unto her daughter be of good
[1:39:07] comfort
[1:39:08] thy faith have made thee whole go
[1:39:12] in peace in peace
[1:39:16] i say be determined when you pray be
[1:39:19] respectful be
[1:39:20] full of faith amen
[1:39:23] think about this this woman it was
[1:39:26] between her and god nobody else needs to
[1:39:28] know about it
[1:39:28] amen i do believe in laying
[1:39:32] on hands and praying and coming up to
[1:39:34] the altar and two or three again
[1:39:36] agreeing and touching i believe in all
[1:39:38] that one all that
[1:39:39] but i also want us to believe in god
[1:39:43] that we us and him are the majority
[1:39:46] that's all that's needed
[1:39:50] brother how many times do we hear
[1:39:52] brother branham say you can have
[1:39:53] whatever you ask for right there right
[1:39:55] where you're standing
[1:40:00] but you can't be in a carnal mindset and
[1:40:02] receive from him
[1:40:04] you can't come to church and expect to
[1:40:07] get
[1:40:08] some revelation
[1:40:11] receive from the lord carnally
[1:40:14] god is a spirit i believe his bride is a
[1:40:17] spiritual being
[1:40:20] and we're trying to conform to what
[1:40:24] god is calling us to
[1:40:28] now say if we could just put into
[1:40:30] practice
[1:40:32] these things that we heard tonight
[1:40:34] because one thing that we all do
[1:40:37] every day is pray this should be real
[1:40:40] easy to practice
[1:40:42] because we do it right well brother john
[1:40:46] i'm already would you spend some more
[1:40:47] time praying for me because there's a
[1:40:49] lot of demons out
[1:40:50] after me pray for one another
[1:40:53] have a get a burden you know i'll say
[1:40:55] this if you don't have a burden
[1:41:03] how many is grateful for the one that
[1:41:06] cooks in your home
[1:41:11] can you imagine going to the table all
[1:41:13] the time and never being thankful
[1:41:17] right
[1:41:21] if god is behind the pulpit
[1:41:25] then we are duty bound to be thankful
[1:41:29] now if it's just a man i understand
[1:41:35] but is god speaking or is it a man
[1:41:38] speaking
[1:41:39] you understand
[1:41:44] you respect god by respecting one
[1:41:46] another
[1:41:49] you're respecting the god inside of one
[1:41:51] another
[1:41:55] i believe if we begin to exercise a
[1:41:58] greater respect
[1:41:59] a greater humility towards one another i
[1:42:01] think our prayers
[1:42:03] with god will be more effective
[1:42:08] and if i'm wrong come and bring me
[1:42:10] scripture bring me quotes and show me
[1:42:13] but you know it's the gospel and
[1:42:16] the devil would just assume us
[1:42:22] try to be divided
[1:42:27] come on and be okay with it
[1:42:33] but there's something about unity
[1:42:37] that god loves and that's why he wants
[1:42:39] us to pray for all saints
[1:42:42] to pray one for another and don't leave
[1:42:44] out the person
[1:42:45] that you hate the most
[1:42:52] i'm okay with waiting till you get into
[1:42:54] the spirit before you start praying
[1:42:56] for that one
[1:43:01] but that's that's they say
[1:43:04] your character is who you are when
[1:43:06] nobody's looking
[1:43:10] could our respect be really our respect
[1:43:14] really be who we are the most
[1:43:16] disrespectful to
[1:43:20] come on because that's what we need to
[1:43:22] grow and we need to have
[1:43:24] total respect
[1:43:28] are you with me let's stand together oh
[1:43:31] we've got a quote here i want to read
[1:43:34] brother branham said jesus christ the
[1:43:38] same yesterday day and forever
[1:43:39] well the scripture i believe some place
[1:43:42] says that the devils tremble when the
[1:43:44] weakest saints go
[1:43:46] to their knees and he says now what a
[1:43:48] power
[1:43:50] and a privilege has been given to the
[1:43:54] church of the living god
[1:43:56] when you fall on your knees in prayer
[1:44:00] even the devils tremble to the weakest
[1:44:02] of them
[1:44:06] so if you are feeling like you ain't
[1:44:09] nothing's really going on
[1:44:11] when you're praying like just know
[1:44:14] you're shaking
[1:44:15] hell
[1:44:18] and i'll tell you i i i like how
[1:44:22] uh is it brother alex he
[1:44:25] he he says uh he he lets the devil know
[1:44:28] he's going to give him trouble
[1:44:31] and that's that's the determination you
[1:44:34] need to have
[1:44:35] i don't i don't care what god says i
[1:44:37] don't care how long i gotta wait
[1:44:41] i don't care if i'm a dog i don't
[1:44:42] nothing matters
[1:44:44] i i'm i'm identified with christ
[1:44:48] and if i stay here long enough my faith
[1:44:53] is going to touch the hem of his garment
[1:44:54] it's going to bring the results
[1:44:56] amen can we can we say my faith looks up
[1:44:59] to thee
[1:45:03] amen so i hope that helps answer the
[1:45:05] question
[1:45:11] about combating thoughts we can't get
[1:45:14] rid of them but we can press through
[1:45:15] them
[1:45:16] amen amen my
[1:45:19] faith looks up to thee
