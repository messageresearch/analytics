[0:01] brother
[0:03] mentioned uh
[0:05] forsaking not the assembling of
[0:07] ourselves together Lord we want to thank
[0:09] you that you've given us a desire to be
[0:11] here today
[0:13] Lord to not forsake your ways and we
[0:16] pray Lord as we
[0:19] are here today we're for the purpose of
[0:22] of getting strength from you getting
[0:25] direction for our lives to to be
[0:28] encouraged to be led and all the things
[0:31] that you have for your people we're here
[0:33] today at the post of Duty father we pray
[0:35] that you'd come in the ministry of the
[0:38] word that you give us ears to hear what
[0:40] the spirit is saying to us may they look
[0:43] beyond the the flesh the natural the man
[0:46] and may they see you in in your word as
[0:48] you present yourself to us uh through
[0:52] the word father you said thy words are
[0:56] Spirit in their life and now we invite
[0:59] them to come into our heart to make us a
[1:02] bold there inside of us that it could
[1:04] bring forth the fruit that is needed
[1:06] Lord we love you we commit disservice to
[1:09] you and we give you the praise now for
[1:11] what you will do in the name of Jesus
[1:14] Christ we pray amen
[1:16] amen Judges chapter 6 starting with
[1:19] verse 11 we're going to talk just a
[1:21] little bit about Gideon this morning and
[1:24] there came an angel of the Lord and sat
[1:27] under an old which was in orphra
[1:31] that pertaineth unto joash the adversite
[1:38] and his son Gideon
[1:40] threshed Wheat by the wine press
[1:43] to hide it from the midianites and the
[1:47] angel of the Lord appeared unto him and
[1:49] said unto him the Lord is with thee thou
[1:53] Mighty Man of Valor
[1:55] and Gideon said unto him O My Lord if if
[1:59] the Lord be with us then
[2:02] why then is all this befalling us
[2:07] and where be all the Miracles which our
[2:09] fathers told us saying did not the Lord
[2:13] bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord
[2:16] have forsaken us and delivered us into
[2:19] the hands of the midianites
[2:23] and the Lord looked upon him and said go
[2:28] in this thy might and thou shall save
[2:32] Israel from the hand of the midnights
[2:34] have not I sent thee amen God bless you
[2:40] may be seated
[2:41] I want to entitle this message if the
[2:44] Lord be with us
[2:47] it's a question I think that we've
[2:49] we've asked ourselves
[2:53] and Gideon
[2:55] had been going through some some hard
[2:58] trials
[2:59] and uh he was hiding
[3:02] he would be threshing this weed he'd
[3:07] take this wheat that had been cut and
[3:09] dry then he was shaken the weed off and
[3:11] then he had to hide all the wheat
[3:13] because the midianites would come and
[3:16] they would steal it so he had to hide it
[3:18] and and no one wants to spend all their
[3:21] time laboring to help feed and then
[3:24] somebody else come along and just steal
[3:26] the labors amen
[3:28] but Gideon had gone through a long trial
[3:31] of persecution in in hardship and he had
[3:35] been manipulated he'd been despised he'd
[3:39] been uh used by the midnights and and
[3:42] the enemy had caused such a fear to come
[3:45] upon him and upon them in the midst to
[3:47] the point that they they felt forsaken
[3:51] forsaken even by God they they felt that
[3:54] their their future was was insecure
[3:58] The God Who once it delivered them from
[4:00] Egypt had now delivered them into the
[4:03] hands of the midianites amen
[4:05] so Gideon was discouraged to say the
[4:08] least amen
[4:10] amen he was depressed because of his
[4:11] situation
[4:13] I think to be honest we could all put
[4:15] ourselves in Gideon's shoes at one time
[4:16] or another
[4:18] there are times we find ourselves in
[4:20] similar situations to where we feel that
[4:23] we've been mistreated
[4:25] despitefully used by others
[4:27] maybe misunderstood or or despised
[4:31] disrespected or or even persecuted
[4:36] leaving sometimes relationships to be
[4:40] broken
[4:41] or even forsaken
[4:44] trials can
[4:45] raise a lot of questions in a man's mind
[4:49] to the point that we could think that
[4:51] actually something is wrong
[4:53] this shouldn't be happening something's
[4:55] wrong the scripture tells us beloved
[4:57] think it not strange concerning the
[4:59] fiery trials which is to try you as
[5:01] though some strange thing has happened
[5:04] unto you
[5:06] often we can let our our feelings Trump
[5:09] the scriptures in other words I know the
[5:10] scripture says that but I still feel
[5:12] something's wrong I still think that's
[5:14] strange
[5:16] the trials that we go through can make
[5:18] us feel forsaken by God
[5:21] questioning his faithfulness
[5:24] wondering where he really is in all this
[5:29] and often if we're not prayed up we'll
[5:32] be attacked by the devil that's right
[5:35] he likes to present us with these
[5:37] questions
[5:39] put us in a box make us feel like
[5:42] something is uh
[5:46] he wants to make us feel like we're less
[5:48] than what we are
[5:50] less than we're a child of the king
[5:53] lest they were his son his daughter his
[5:56] bride he wants to and the thing is that
[5:59] the more that he can present God is away
[6:01] from you
[6:03] the less that you'll have confidence in
[6:06] what you're doing right
[6:09] so we need to this morning we need to
[6:12] position ourselves in the word of God
[6:15] the word tells us who you are
[6:18] and where you're positionally at right
[6:21] now
[6:22] and where he wants you to be
[6:25] that's what the word does and that's why
[6:27] the word is important no human being can
[6:29] tell you
[6:31] it takes the Holy Ghost
[6:34] that's why your your attention is to God
[6:37] speaking to you and not a man
[6:40] we have to get our eyes off the man
[6:42] because the man is going to fail as sure
[6:46] as anything man is going to fail
[6:49] but God is here to see us through amen
[6:52] amen so regardless of our feelings we
[6:54] need to to be at our pulse to duty even
[6:56] brother Johnson had made mention of this
[6:58] but we need to be prepared and we need
[7:02] to be executing our duties
[7:06] when we get to the church we need to get
[7:08] in the prayer room
[7:10] and we need to stay there until the Holy
[7:12] Ghost comes
[7:14] and reminds us
[7:17] Who We Are
[7:18] that we're a mighty man of value
[7:22] that God is really with us
[7:25] but we have to stay there till the Holy
[7:27] Ghost comes and tells us that
[7:30] amen it can't be our own thoughts can't
[7:32] be our own mind and it can't be our
[7:34] feelings because someone shook her hand
[7:36] right
[7:37] we have to stay there and get prepared
[7:40] for the word
[7:42] we need to hear from God Amen
[7:45] one wandering into church without the
[7:48] mind of Christ it's like wandering in
[7:50] the wilderness that's right
[7:52] you're amongst God's people but without
[7:55] the spirit of Joshua who wholly followed
[7:59] the Lord
[8:00] it was a mixed multitude they all went
[8:03] to church
[8:05] Jonas uh Jonas Jonas
[8:09] Jonas get it out of the way that's the
[8:12] way I talk sometimes don't mean to but
[8:14] it's just me that's why you got to take
[8:16] your eyes off me
[8:19] um Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost
[8:25] and he led Caleb to his Mountain
[8:28] to the promised land
[8:31] and the Holy Ghost is here to lead us to
[8:34] the promised land but the word has to
[8:37] fall on good ground
[8:40] it just can't you just can't wander into
[8:42] church I'm here at church and you know
[8:44] the word I'm going to just receive the
[8:45] word and it's going to grow it can't it
[8:47] won't be like that it falls on four
[8:48] different types of ground you are the
[8:50] only one that can make sure that the
[8:52] ground of your heart is good ground
[8:53] today that you're here to believe every
[8:56] word of God you're not going to pick and
[8:57] choose and have a smorgasbord but you're
[8:59] going to take the word of God because
[9:00] man must live by every word that
[9:03] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[9:05] right
[9:06] now the Holy Ghost can't force you into
[9:08] the Promised Land
[9:09] it can only lead you
[9:13] to it you have to be the one to wholly
[9:15] follow it
[9:17] without the mind of Christ our thoughts
[9:20] can wander in the wrong places
[9:23] like why is this happening to me
[9:26] why am I being taken advantage of
[9:29] why doesn't anyone seem to care anymore
[9:31] why doesn't anybody love me
[9:34] come on it's awful quiet there there we
[9:38] all feel those things we all we all get
[9:40] those questions we all we all feel
[9:43] negative right true
[9:46] without the mind of Christ we can be
[9:49] left wandering just like Gideon did
[9:52] the Lord be with us why then has all
[9:56] this befallen us
[9:58] if God is really here
[10:01] be all his miracles
[10:03] which our fathers told us
[10:06] and if God is here then why am I
[10:09] struggling am I struggling to worship
[10:11] why am I struggling to receive why am I
[10:14] struggling to hear from God
[10:17] why haven't I been healed
[10:20] we'll be all the Miracles
[10:23] without the mind of Christ Satan will
[10:26] put you in a box with his questions
[10:31] we can become very disheartened very
[10:34] discouraged and sometimes ended up being
[10:36] judgmental
[10:39] towards others kind of blaming others
[10:41] for the way we feel
[10:43] maybe uh I don't like the the songs
[10:46] they're singing they're not helping me
[10:48] another preach I don't like the the
[10:50] preaching
[10:51] I like the way they make me feel
[10:57] how important it is to have the mind of
[10:59] Christ
[10:59] [Music]
[11:00] we've got to get back to our post to
[11:02] duty and it's not just church attendance
[11:04] it's Church preparation it's Church
[11:07] preparation that's needed that's staying
[11:09] in the prayer room until the Holy Ghost
[11:11] comes and says the Lord is with you
[11:13] you're a Mighty Man a value you're a
[11:15] mighty Christian of value
[11:19] we must learn to wait upon the Lord
[11:23] amen God is not in the business of
[11:25] appeasing our flesh
[11:27] he's in the business of being Lord over
[11:31] more of Our Lives that's what he's here
[11:33] for he's here to gain more control
[11:39] amen I appreciate our brother Johnson
[11:41] saying that it's good that we're
[11:43] Justified he come to justify us as if
[11:46] we've never sinned but we must go on now
[11:49] we must go on to receive more of the
[11:52] Holy Ghost so he can become more Lord of
[11:55] our life
[11:58] the scripture instructions instructs Us
[12:01] in Isaiah chapter 40 verse 29 he giveth
[12:04] power to the faint and to them that have
[12:07] no might he increaseth strength
[12:12] he I don't care if you feel faint if you
[12:16] have no power he's here to take care of
[12:18] you amen
[12:19] amen verse 31 but they that wait upon
[12:23] the Lord they shall renew their strength
[12:25] they shall Mount up with wings as he
[12:27] goes they shall run and not be weary and
[12:31] they shall walk you know what they're
[12:33] not going to faint
[12:36] but we got to wait in prayer
[12:40] we got to pay the price to wait in
[12:42] prayer until God comes and he comes in
[12:45] that still Small Voice and he speaks to
[12:48] us that God is really with us no matter
[12:50] how we feel and that we are his elect
[12:55] if we go by feelings of who we are one
[12:58] day we're gonna oh yeah yeah I'm a I'm
[13:01] I'm a child of the king and telling
[13:03] everybody and this is what's happening
[13:05] the next day it's like I don't even feel
[13:07] like going to church
[13:10] shut up that's what happens when you're
[13:13] operating by feelings
[13:16] but Christians don't operate by feelings
[13:18] they want by faith is what the word says
[13:22] it's what matters
[13:25] now we're all living busy lives another
[13:27] thing brother Johnson mentioned he had a
[13:29] mini sermon today
[13:31] wrong going to and fro Brother Bruce had
[13:35] made mention Wednesday
[13:37] trying to accomplish things trying to
[13:39] make increase for our lives
[13:42] it's very easy
[13:45] to get sidetracked and forget
[13:47] that God is trying to take the reins of
[13:50] our life amen
[13:51] amen we can forget to let him take the
[13:54] reins and just uh presumptuously
[13:58] assuming that God Is With Us in every
[14:00] decision that we make
[14:02] instead of taking time to say I could be
[14:04] wrong the fear of the Lord I could be
[14:07] wrong Lord is this your will or should I
[14:09] put this aside and spend more time with
[14:12] you
[14:13] busyness can leave us wandering where is
[14:16] the Lord when I want to feel his
[14:19] presence
[14:21] Isaiah or not Isaiah Psalms chapter 46
[14:24] verse 7.
[14:28] I want you to feel encouraged today
[14:30] but we also have to face the things that
[14:33] are getting in our way amen
[14:35] Psalms 46 verse 7 the Lord of hosts is
[14:39] with who
[14:42] do you believe that
[14:43] it it the Lord G the Bible says that God
[14:47] lives in our heart by faith
[14:52] of course we love to feel them love it
[14:56] but he don't live there by feelings
[14:58] is by faith
[15:00] so the moment that you're questioning if
[15:03] he's here what's happening
[15:05] without faith you can't even make him
[15:07] hot you've got to believe that he's with
[15:09] us
[15:10] the god of Jacob is our refuge
[15:13] come Behold The Works of the Lord what
[15:16] desolations he have made in the earth he
[15:18] maketh Wars to cease unto the ends of
[15:20] the Earth he breakth the bow cut the
[15:23] spear and thunder he burnt the Chariots
[15:25] and Fire
[15:27] how do we Behold The Works of the Lord
[15:29] Brother John I mean look this world's
[15:32] going insane it looks like just the
[15:33] opposite of this scripture
[15:38] in fact we heard that the Earth is going
[15:41] to burn with fervent fire we're gonna
[15:43] and the righteous are going to walk over
[15:45] the the ashes of the wicked
[15:48] so how do I Behold The Works of the Lord
[15:51] Brother John
[15:53] verse 10 be still and know that I am God
[15:58] I will be exalted among the Heathen I
[16:02] will be exalted in the Earth
[16:04] the Lord of hosts is with us but we just
[16:09] have to learn to be still
[16:11] to get alone with God to make it real
[16:15] if I can convince you of anything that
[16:18] doesn't mean anything
[16:20] because there's a lot of people who are
[16:21] much smarter than I can come by and
[16:24] convince you out of it
[16:25] but when the Lord speaks to you no man
[16:28] can take it from you
[16:31] we just have to learn to be still get to
[16:34] know God a little bit more
[16:37] we all have situations that are
[16:39] happening in our lives that will want to
[16:41] try to
[16:42] try us right to the core it's then we
[16:45] need to to really put into action that
[16:48] the the faith that we have and just
[16:51] regardless of how we feel I'm standing
[16:53] here the Lord is with me
[16:55] I'm going to be still I know the Lord is
[16:57] with me amen I am a mighty Christian in
[17:01] God's Army today
[17:04] that God
[17:06] is waiting to speak to me when I get to
[17:09] my post of Duty
[17:12] question and
[17:15] here God was talking to Gideon I Am with
[17:18] You thou Mighty Man of Valor
[17:21] but it seemed just like Idol Tales yes
[17:25] it just it just seemed like I don't
[17:27] Tails oh my Lord if the Lord was with us
[17:30] look at if
[17:32] if why then is all this befallen us and
[17:34] we're all the Miracles which our fathers
[17:36] told us did not the Lord bring us up
[17:38] from uh from the things of the world but
[17:42] now the Lord have forsaken us and
[17:44] delivered us into the hands of my enemy
[17:49] if we're not careful We can question or
[17:52] doubt when God is speaking to us
[17:57] here here the Lord we're speaking to him
[17:59] and he was debating with him he just she
[18:02] should have just said amen to the word
[18:04] amen so be it
[18:07] thank you Lord for the encouragement
[18:10] but you know he didn't do that
[18:13] if it's if it's true what you're saying
[18:15] then why am I feeling the way I'm
[18:17] feeling
[18:18] why has all these things happen to my
[18:20] life I'm still thinking it's strange
[18:26] have you ever asked these questions
[18:28] before
[18:30] where's all the Miracles
[18:32] why are these things befalling me
[18:35] can you put your feet in Gideon's shoes
[18:38] this morning
[18:41] okay I want you to put your feet and
[18:43] brother branham's shoes this morning
[18:44] want your feet to be shot with the
[18:47] gospel he said in the message if God be
[18:50] with us then where's all the Miracles he
[18:52] said believe the word of God and you'll
[18:55] see the miracles of god
[18:58] now this is personal he didn't say if
[19:01] your church believes the word of God
[19:03] you'll see the word of God you'll see
[19:05] the Miracles
[19:06] it's a personal
[19:09] believe the word of God and you'll see
[19:11] the miracles of god
[19:13] but you have to believe it first
[19:16] and further on in the message he said
[19:19] but act upon the word of God
[19:22] if you want to see the miracles of god
[19:26] so you you have
[19:28] to believe
[19:30] then you have to act
[19:34] not act like you believe
[19:38] but do the actions of what belief is
[19:43] live it like you believe it
[19:46] testify of it like you believe it go
[19:49] through the the hardships as if you
[19:51] believe it
[19:53] the whole reason that we want Miracles
[19:56] is because we need the Miracles
[19:59] we want the healings we we want to see
[20:02] things transpire
[20:04] so we have to believe for them
[20:07] take action to what God is speaking
[20:13] think about this
[20:15] we're taught by the message that God
[20:18] chose you one out of a million
[20:22] it was just Joshua and Caleb out of
[20:24] everywhere that came out of Egypt that
[20:26] were of a certain age and older that
[20:28] made it into the promised land think
[20:30] about it why wasn't one of the others
[20:33] because God chose them they were
[20:35] predestinated
[20:37] and they had another Spirit the Bible
[20:39] says they they went on to get the Holy
[20:42] Ghost amen if I could say it like that
[20:44] they weren't just just feeling good
[20:47] enough Justified being out of Egypt
[20:51] amen they wanted to go on to the
[20:53] promised land and they were willing to
[20:56] fight for it
[20:59] God help us to fight for it
[21:02] amen amen
[21:05] God wants to speak to us but we need to
[21:07] take action
[21:08] in what he's speaking to us
[21:11] now what he's speaking to you may not
[21:13] have anything to do with the miracle
[21:19] it may be something else
[21:21] but you may be the one that God chose in
[21:24] this church
[21:27] to bring that Miracle to pass
[21:33] as if you know we can easily say well
[21:36] you know it should be so and soul doing
[21:39] it
[21:41] it's easy it takes the responsibility
[21:43] off of us
[21:45] but it's
[21:46] we are a church body we function as a
[21:50] body
[21:51] there's no big eyes or a little use
[21:55] and in fact the way that God says that
[21:58] if you if you're gonna be great
[22:00] then you've got to be the least
[22:04] you've got to do the serving you've got
[22:06] to you got to present yourself as
[22:08] nothing
[22:09] if you really that's in God's thinking
[22:12] so in our thinking it we we just don't
[22:16] have big eyes in little use we're a body
[22:21] so think it not strange that God would
[22:24] choose you to bring the miracle to pass
[22:31] if you've got a revelation
[22:35] if you've got a revelation
[22:37] of what this church needs
[22:41] with every Revelation comes a
[22:43] responsibility
[22:45] then you take upon you the
[22:47] responsibility of making that come to
[22:49] pass
[22:51] that shows a maturity
[22:57] easiest thing to do is sit back and
[22:59] judge others for a situation
[23:03] the hardest thing to do is to take
[23:05] action upon the word right
[23:07] God help us to do that
[23:10] yes sir in the midst of all of our
[23:12] doubts and questions and fears God said
[23:14] I'll never leave you and I'll never
[23:16] forsake you Hebrews 13 Verse 5 says let
[23:20] your conversation be without wantingness
[23:28] you ever been talking to somebody and
[23:30] just
[23:30] you know
[23:32] we just need to be careful about our
[23:34] conversations
[23:36] and be content with such things as you
[23:39] have
[23:40] for he have said I will never leave thee
[23:43] nor forsake thee
[23:46] according to the scriptures we should
[23:48] never be doubting that God is with us
[23:53] I mean biblically speaking the Bible
[23:56] says it regardless of what my feelings
[23:58] tell me
[23:59] if I touch something cold and say oh
[24:02] that's cold if I touch something huh
[24:03] it's going to be hot and you can see
[24:05] there's a contrast between hot and cold
[24:07] and so there are with feelings God is
[24:09] with us God is not with us that's why we
[24:11] don't go by feelings we're Believers
[24:14] here we're Believers in the house of God
[24:17] we're Believers of the economy of God
[24:21] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[24:24] helper the Lord is my helper I will not
[24:29] fear what man shall do unto me
[24:32] praise the Lord
[24:35] brother John I'm struggling
[24:38] I'm feeling alone like Gideon
[24:43] feel like the Lord's forsaken me
[24:48] since when
[24:50] do we go by feelings
[24:53] how can you belittle God
[24:56] how can you belittle God
[24:59] to lower his word to your feelings and
[25:03] your feelings being the head of your
[25:05] life
[25:08] he's touched by the fetus of our
[25:09] infirmities but the word is our head not
[25:12] our feelings
[25:14] it's what the word says about me you've
[25:16] got to believe what the word says about
[25:18] you more than what you think about
[25:20] yourself
[25:23] because the word is going to
[25:26] the word is going to straighten our
[25:27] lives out it's going to put us in
[25:29] Balance if we're too much to this side
[25:32] or too much of that side the word puts
[25:34] us right where we need to be
[25:36] but our feelings oh it's like a pendulum
[25:38] clock this is back and forth every
[25:41] minute every hour don't know what's
[25:42] going to happen when I talk to them next
[25:48] God wants us standing on the word
[25:51] [Music]
[25:54] John I feel God has God is mad at me you
[25:57] feel God's mad at you
[26:00] I've sinned I've I've
[26:03] I'm
[26:03] backsliding I'm stuck in the able to see
[26:06] I don't even feel like trying
[26:11] I don't care what you've done
[26:13] Calvary paid the price for every one of
[26:17] our personal situations
[26:19] we we're not in a church that believes
[26:23] that half the things that are happening
[26:26] Christ didn't pay for it and there's no
[26:29] way out we do we don't believe that
[26:31] Christ is here to meet every need he has
[26:34] paid the price for it at Calvary all we
[26:36] have to do is believe it that's it just
[26:38] believe it don't feel it don't wait for
[26:40] the the bad feelings to leave just
[26:43] believe
[26:44] [Music]
[26:44] [Applause]
[26:47] I don't care how long you've been away
[26:48] from God Be Still yes sir
[26:51] yes sir be still wait on and watch him
[26:53] be exalted in your life
[26:57] the blood is here this morning to cover
[26:59] our past mistakes
[27:02] the blood is here to do its job to do
[27:05] what only he can do
[27:10] there's power in the blood
[27:12] and his blood shall never lose its power
[27:17] he will always have power we need to
[27:20] testify of that power
[27:23] you know that'll just get the devil
[27:25] leaving you know that
[27:27] you need to take advantage of God's
[27:29] blood
[27:30] not just this morning but every morning
[27:33] his mercies are new every morning
[27:36] brother van taught us a pardon is not a
[27:39] pardon unless it's received as a pardon
[27:42] so if the Lord is here pardoning us
[27:46] we have to receive it we have to be the
[27:49] one to stand up and say I believe I've
[27:52] been pardoned
[27:53] foreign
[27:55] unless that transpires if you're waiting
[27:58] for your feelings to dictate it to you
[28:00] again you're putting your feelings above
[28:02] the word and that's such an insult to
[28:04] God
[28:06] we've got to receive God's pardon
[28:09] better receive it by faith
[28:11] make him happy
[28:16] you got to believe God
[28:19] he got to believe God that he loves you
[28:23] he he
[28:25] wants to forgive us he wants to
[28:30] uh
[28:32] strengthen us
[28:33] he wants to to make us not remain as
[28:37] Gideon was why why did God come to
[28:41] Gideon
[28:42] didn't want him staying in that state of
[28:46] feeling forsaken
[28:48] feeling like God to just given us to
[28:51] this all these problems of the world
[28:54] God don't want us like that
[28:57] he wants us to to come and lay claims
[29:01] lay claims to our inheritance amen
[29:05] and if all we have to do is believe we
[29:08] have to trust that God loves us that's
[29:10] all we have to do
[29:13] God loves us
[29:15] God loves us
[29:18] how real is that to us
[29:21] God loves us God loves us so much that
[29:24] love covers a multitude of sin
[29:28] a multitude
[29:30] you can't even number it
[29:33] that's how much God loves us
[29:37] for God so loved us
[29:42] that he gave
[29:44] that we that you and I could become born
[29:47] again
[29:48] that we could gain his nature that we
[29:51] could become in His image
[29:53] his love covered so we could become him
[29:57] no man
[30:01] men don't
[30:03] man's love isn't doesn't cover
[30:08] man's Love Don't cover in fact man's
[30:11] love uncovers
[30:15] but I'll tell you if the love of God is
[30:18] in a man's heart he'll cover your sins
[30:20] just like God does
[30:22] God is Not different in you than he is
[30:25] in his word
[30:26] if God is in you he will act the same
[30:28] because he is the same yesterday today
[30:31] and forever
[30:33] okay
[30:35] love covers a multitude of sin I don't
[30:37] care where God is at
[30:40] it'll do the same thing
[30:45] Satan's accuser of the brethren
[30:48] you can identify him quickly
[30:51] because he's accusing
[30:54] he's not covering
[30:57] he's accusing
[31:00] another John I have a a certain per
[31:03] particular situation going on in my life
[31:08] just be still
[31:11] God is here to meet our needs
[31:14] we've got to exercise faith
[31:17] he is capable of hand on the worst
[31:20] disaster
[31:22] he's he's able to handle the worst
[31:25] situation if we sin we have an advocate
[31:28] with the father
[31:29] if we confess our sins he's faithful and
[31:32] just to forgive us and to cleanse us
[31:34] from all unrighteousness
[31:37] If any man lacks wisdom let him ask of
[31:40] God who giveth liberally to all that ask
[31:43] Amen in faith
[31:45] but we've got to ask it in faith James
[31:48] the ones verse 6 says but let him ask in
[31:51] faith not wavering
[31:53] for he that waiveth is like the wave of
[31:56] the sea driven with the wind and tossed
[31:59] feelings basically amen
[32:02] but let them but let not that man think
[32:06] that he shall receive what
[32:09] anything
[32:10] of the Lord
[32:13] a double-minded man is unstable in a l l
[32:21] all his ways
[32:23] how important it is to exercise faith in
[32:26] our life
[32:28] that's 24 7. all of our all of our ways
[32:31] not just when we come to church try to
[32:33] have faith in church try to have faith
[32:34] in the word is it being no all of our
[32:37] Lives it needs to become God in all my
[32:40] life
[32:41] Philippians 4 19 says but my God shall
[32:44] supply all your need according to his
[32:48] riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen
[32:51] that's the God we serve right that's the
[32:54] God we need to testify of that God right
[32:56] there the one that's of the word
[33:00] but we got to seek first the kingdom
[33:03] and his righteousness
[33:05] and then all other things will be added
[33:07] unto us
[33:09] so if your question if God is really
[33:11] with you
[33:13] remember he said I'll never leave you
[33:16] I'll never forsake you
[33:18] if your question if God is here in the
[33:20] ministry of the word
[33:22] if you're wondering where all his
[33:23] miracles get alone with God
[33:27] he is the doubt remover
[33:33] maybe he's calling you to be that one to
[33:37] bring it to here wouldn't it be
[33:38] wonderful you know how it feels when God
[33:40] uses you to help somebody right
[33:44] wouldn't it be wonderful
[33:46] if God used you to bring forth a miracle
[33:52] you would just be rejoicing
[33:55] but that takes harder that's much harder
[33:57] work
[33:59] than to sit back and say
[34:02] why isn't there
[34:06] why isn't there
[34:11] I don't want to be among those that are
[34:13] why isn't there
[34:16] I want to be among those who believe
[34:19] who believe on two
[34:22] who remains faithful
[34:24] until he comes and does the work that he
[34:28] promised to do
[34:35] consider
[34:36] whatever you feel is lacking in the
[34:39] church and become that
[34:42] become that
[34:44] and what you're doing is you're finding
[34:46] your place in the body
[34:48] you're positioning yourself in a place
[34:50] to help the Bible says
[34:54] um
[34:55] where every joint supplyeth what it
[34:58] needs to to to function together and to
[35:01] grow together and to to be a body that
[35:05] the devil just can't easily come in
[35:07] through and to disrupt things
[35:11] we need to be strong
[35:13] in the Lord
[35:14] in the powers might
[35:16] we need the mind of Christ yes
[35:19] we need to take the sword of the spirit
[35:21] which is the word of God the Bible tells
[35:23] and just believe for it believe for the
[35:26] Miracles
[35:27] believe for things to change in your
[35:29] life Ephesians 6 verse 16 above all
[35:31] taking the shield of faith
[35:35] Shear to Faith
[35:38] that'll quench those questions
[35:40] we're with you shall be able to quench
[35:43] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[35:46] that's those questions where you feel
[35:48] left in a box with no answers
[35:51] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[35:54] sword of spirit which is the word of God
[35:58] [Music]
[36:00] see the sword of the spirit
[36:03] there here's the wit the written word
[36:06] and this this word is going to judge the
[36:11] world right amen
[36:15] Jesus said I came not to judge the world
[36:17] but to save the world but he that
[36:19] rejecteth me and rejected rejected the
[36:22] words that I have spoken the same shall
[36:24] judge him in the last day
[36:27] we're not here to receive
[36:30] the natural word of God
[36:33] for the letter killeth
[36:36] what we're looking for is the spirit
[36:38] that wrote this word the spirit of this
[36:41] word that's what we're trying to invite
[36:43] into our heart
[36:45] the spirit of the word
[36:51] now the question will come to all of us
[36:53] if God be with us
[36:57] if God before us
[36:59] if God is amongst us the question is
[37:02] going to come to us that's the devil's
[37:04] job right
[37:05] to put the questions in her mind
[37:08] but it's how you're going to answer
[37:10] that's going to bring the results that's
[37:12] right
[37:14] that's right you can feel defeated
[37:16] forsaken alone without direction for
[37:18] your life know what to do or you can get
[37:21] down to business and get still with God
[37:24] get still and know with know with
[37:27] confidence that God is with you and you
[37:29] stay there till he comes and tells you
[37:31] God is never going to meet you in the
[37:33] prayer room and tell you to get out of
[37:35] here
[37:36] that's right
[37:40] no he's just going to tell you're going
[37:42] to hear those words when you're away
[37:44] from God
[37:47] but you got to get in the presence of
[37:49] God
[37:55] he hasn't left
[37:59] you've got to have faith in Christ
[38:02] amen you got to believe greater is he
[38:04] that's in you than he that's in the
[38:05] world
[38:06] amen you've got to believe it I can do
[38:09] all things through Christ who
[38:10] strengtheneth me
[38:12] it's not through the church
[38:14] don't don't put it on the church
[38:18] how much can Church do for you
[38:21] what's your definition of church
[38:29] Christ is not going to share his glory
[38:31] with anyone
[38:33] he wants every one of us to look to him
[38:36] he's knocking he wants us to open the
[38:40] door and let him come in and know that
[38:43] Christ in US can't do all things
[38:47] I can do all things to Christ
[38:51] I want you to think about this these
[38:54] questions now of God before us Romans
[38:56] chapter 8 verse 29
[39:00] for whom
[39:02] did he for whom he did foreknow God
[39:05] foreknew us
[39:07] he also did predestinate
[39:12] for what
[39:13] very important here
[39:15] what did he predestinate to
[39:18] to be conformed to the image of his son
[39:22] that he might be the firstborn among
[39:25] many brethren
[39:27] so God has an expectation for more of
[39:30] him
[39:31] he just has that expectation this is
[39:33] what I'm wanting I I want to duplicate
[39:36] I want more of me
[39:40] that's what we've been predestined to we
[39:42] haven't been predestinated to have all
[39:44] of our wants met right
[39:47] all of our days to be sunny
[39:50] our friends to always understand us
[39:53] all of our dreams to come true we
[39:55] haven't been predestined to that we've
[39:58] been predestinated to be conformed into
[40:01] the image of his son's nature
[40:06] the nature amen that's right that word
[40:09] conform means jointly formed that is
[40:12] similar in nature fashioned like unto
[40:16] I'll tell you that's what this going to
[40:17] church is all about
[40:19] it that's what the reading the Bible
[40:20] That's why God introduced the message to
[40:22] you that is why the message came to us
[40:27] I wish we could get a revelation of that
[40:30] we need to be focusing on what God's
[40:33] plans are for us if he hasn't expected
[40:36] end we need to be focusing on that
[40:38] expected end
[40:41] verse 30 moreover did whom he did
[40:43] predestinate them he also called
[40:48] and whom he called I want to know did
[40:50] you did you hear the call of God
[40:53] the fact that you're here today
[40:57] shows
[40:59] that he called you
[41:02] amen not a mistake not an accident
[41:06] you may Wonder
[41:08] you may have wondered when this thing
[41:11] was introduced to you
[41:14] but it wasn't a mistake
[41:17] it wasn't like we even went calling on
[41:20] God
[41:22] I remember distinctly in my life not
[41:25] caring about God
[41:27] only caring about what I wanted to do
[41:29] and what I wanted to do wasn't pleasing
[41:31] to the word
[41:34] and then God called
[41:37] so we didn't choose him he chose us
[41:40] we didn't call on him he called us
[41:44] and the Beautiful Thing If you can say
[41:46] that I know that he called me
[41:50] whom he called them he also Justified
[41:54] and whom he justified then he's also
[41:59] glorified so no matter what we feel no
[42:02] matter what the situation he's looking
[42:05] at a finished product that you're
[42:07] already glorified
[42:08] I see you as a finished product
[42:14] so now look at if you could just believe
[42:16] that scripture we don't have to care
[42:19] about how we feel about it
[42:21] we're just believers
[42:23] Are You The Feelers are you the
[42:25] Believers
[42:28] you know every Church you got feelers
[42:30] and believers
[42:32] you got to stand up and say I'm believer
[42:34] not a feeler I'm a Believer I remember
[42:37] brother Bill talking to us about a
[42:41] situation back in brother Johnson's
[42:43] church and
[42:44] brother Hankins was there
[42:47] and uh so brother brother bill went up
[42:50] to brother Hankins and he told Brother
[42:53] Hankins he said brother Hankins I just I
[42:56] just lost my job
[42:58] and brother Hankins look at him just to
[43:00] a minister of great wisdom of the Lord
[43:03] he says what do you do you want me to
[43:05] worry with you or do you want me to pray
[43:06] with you
[43:08] this the Simplicity of which side you're
[43:12] going to take it's easy to say I'm such
[43:14] a Believer when all your needs are met
[43:16] and everything's great and you're
[43:18] getting patted on the back but when the
[43:20] chips are down and think you're going
[43:22] through the test and trials that's when
[43:25] you got to stand and say I'm a Believer
[43:27] I believe in prayer I Believe In Christ
[43:31] I believe in the word I believe he's
[43:33] going to see me through amen
[43:35] foreign
[43:38] what shall we say to these things
[43:42] if God be with us why do we feel
[43:45] forsaken
[43:48] is that where Gideon said
[43:53] here
[43:54] God told him the Lord is with you
[43:57] you're a mighty man of value
[44:00] but Gideon said
[44:03] the Lord's with us why am I forsaken why
[44:06] are all these things happening
[44:08] see the question is going to come to us
[44:12] but it's how you're going to respond
[44:15] how are you going to respond when the
[44:17] question comes
[44:19] you're going to respond by feelings or
[44:20] by faith
[44:22] if God before us who can be against us
[44:27] not the medianites not anyone not any
[44:31] Spirit nothing can be against us because
[44:35] greater is he that's in us than he
[44:37] that's in the world
[44:39] thank you Jesus
[44:41] all these Spirits are trying to to bring
[44:44] us down they are
[44:45] but they're nothing to God
[44:49] what we have to do is take a stand with
[44:51] the word
[44:53] not just to staying on your own home no
[44:56] I'm bigger than no you're not but God in
[45:00] you is take a stand with the word I'm
[45:03] standing with Christ I'm standing with
[45:04] the word
[45:07] you got to put your faith
[45:10] to the test
[45:13] to the test
[45:16] if God before us who can be against us
[45:20] verse 32 he that spared not his own son
[45:23] but delivered him up for us who oh
[45:29] every one of us amen everyone one person
[45:33] left out here
[45:34] how shall the father not with Jesus also
[45:38] freely give us all things whatever your
[45:42] need is
[45:44] now I don't know any person that God has
[45:48] given him everything their flesh ever
[45:50] wanted
[45:51] I don't think that's what that scripture
[45:53] is really referring to
[45:55] turn with me to Second Peter we'll come
[45:58] back to this
[46:00] second Peter chapter one
[46:03] so what what what things is he referring
[46:05] to
[46:06] I believe the scripture will help us
[46:08] second Peter chapter one verse three
[46:10] according as his divine power have given
[46:14] unto us all things that pertaineth unto
[46:19] life and godliness
[46:23] through the knowledge of him that have
[46:25] called us
[46:26] amen we just got done reading we're
[46:29] called
[46:30] us to glory and to Virtue amen whereby
[46:36] are given unto us all of us all of us
[46:39] not I mean anybody left out you just got
[46:42] to receive it whereby given us this
[46:44] exceeding great and precious promises
[46:47] then brother brother Johnson tell us at
[46:50] the beginning of the service that
[46:51] there's a lot of promises in this world
[46:53] we got to get in and read it
[46:56] exceeding great and precious promises
[46:58] that by these ye might be partakers of
[47:02] what
[47:03] the divine nature
[47:10] that's what he's interested in that's
[47:12] what we've been predestinated to
[47:14] having escaped the corruption that is in
[47:17] the world through lust
[47:20] God has given us what we need for the
[47:23] nature change
[47:25] that's why we've got to take these
[47:27] promises and apply them in our life for
[47:29] our nature change
[47:31] that's what the promises are there for
[47:33] now I'm not saying there's not promises
[47:35] for other things there are
[47:37] there are
[47:40] but
[47:42] God wants to see us ultimately with a
[47:45] nature change and that is by far the
[47:46] most important thing
[47:48] and I think sometimes we we we forget
[47:51] what the call is to
[47:56] and we get sidetracked to how we could
[47:58] build our kingdom down here
[48:01] how we can get what we want what makes
[48:03] us feel good what makes what we're
[48:05] looking for and the thing is that's not
[48:08] what the word is for
[48:11] it's for life and godliness
[48:16] her life and godliness
[48:19] we need to keep building
[48:23] our walk with the Lord our spiritual
[48:25] house
[48:26] until we come into His image
[48:29] now that's our our goal is our
[48:32] relationship with Christ that's what
[48:33] this church was really built on
[48:36] second Peter chapter one verse 5 let's
[48:38] continue reading and besides this giving
[48:42] all diligence
[48:43] add
[48:45] to your faith
[48:47] virtue
[48:48] I have it add
[48:50] to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[48:54] knowledge I believe brother Johnson was
[48:57] gonna
[48:59] no brother Johnson were you going to
[49:01] bring this by or is that something
[49:03] different
[49:04] but these are the the steps here that we
[49:07] need to go virtue knowledge and to
[49:10] knowledge Temperance and Temperance
[49:11] patience into patience godliness and to
[49:13] Godliness brotherly kindness into
[49:15] brotherly kindness the love of God
[49:19] now I'll tell you I don't I I don't
[49:21] think we should stop until you see the
[49:24] love of God
[49:25] in fact brother Brandon said like this
[49:27] you better just lay everything else
[49:28] going aside that you got going just lay
[49:30] it aside until you get perfect love keep
[49:33] building until you get it
[49:35] that should be our Focus
[49:37] and don't just think it's going to come
[49:39] and you can go do whatever you want to
[49:40] do it's going to come no matter what
[49:41] that is the wrong type of predestination
[49:44] that's right
[49:45] you got to go after it
[49:48] you got to build you got to add you got
[49:50] to do something about it
[49:54] no that's another message
[49:56] you just believe it just believe it
[49:59] that's all I can say just believe it
[50:00] Believe It Or we don't believe it
[50:03] Romans 8 verse 32 he that spared not his
[50:06] own son but delivered him us for all how
[50:09] shall he not with him also free to give
[50:11] us all things who shall lay anything to
[50:14] the charge of God's elect
[50:17] so you know what it really doesn't
[50:19] matter what anybody says about you
[50:22] true
[50:25] even if it's true
[50:28] even if it's true it doesn't matter
[50:32] because whatever they say isn't going to
[50:36] condemn you
[50:41] because it is they're not the judge
[50:44] they're not the justifier
[50:46] [Music]
[50:48] he became Our Savior and our judge
[50:53] our protector
[50:55] the final say so
[50:58] his blood
[51:00] isn't strong enough
[51:03] to take care of your sins
[51:05] but not somebody else's
[51:08] that's not the God we serve
[51:10] that's not the revelation
[51:13] of who God is
[51:15] The God Who we know if he can forgive us
[51:18] can forgive others
[51:20] if he can justify us he can justify
[51:23] others
[51:24] that's the God we serve that's why the
[51:27] Bible says
[51:30] um judge not that you be not judged
[51:35] and that if you uh blessed are the
[51:38] merciful for they shall obtain Mercy
[51:41] if if you judge others with little Mercy
[51:46] you will be judged with little Mercy
[51:50] now who here who here
[51:54] only needs little Mercy let me see your
[51:56] hands
[51:57] anybody here only needs a little Mercy
[52:02] we need a lot of Mercy don't we
[52:05] we need mercies every single morning
[52:09] every single then you know what
[52:12] we should be being merciful to everyone
[52:14] every single morning
[52:20] Christ in you would do the same thing to
[52:22] others as Christ does to you
[52:28] and our if we believe
[52:31] you hunger for that you thirst for that
[52:34] God will come in in a mighty way and
[52:36] just glorify himself through your life
[52:39] but it's hard to be merciful to somebody
[52:41] if they haven't done something wrong
[52:44] so something has to happen
[52:47] something has to be said about you
[52:49] something they have to do something
[52:50] wrong to you
[52:52] in order for you to fulfill the
[52:54] scripture see
[52:57] anybody can love those that love them
[53:00] but when you can love those who spear
[53:03] you in the back
[53:06] come on that's the mighty God we serve
[53:11] greater is he that's in us than he
[53:13] that's in the world we need to continue
[53:15] on who shall lay anything to the charge
[53:17] of God's light it is God that justifieth
[53:20] who is he that condemneth
[53:22] it is Christ that died for us yeah
[53:24] rather is risen again who's even at the
[53:27] right hand of God who maketh
[53:28] intercessions for us
[53:31] to make it in our sessions for us why
[53:33] Satan and his cohorts
[53:37] are accusing us
[53:40] Jesus is making an intercession for us
[53:42] right
[53:45] think about it
[53:52] who shall separate us from the love of
[53:55] Christ
[53:56] verse 35 show tribulation
[53:59] shall distress shall persecution shall
[54:01] famine nakedness Peril soar the
[54:03] Mennonites the roly Knights
[54:06] some harsh words that someone slandered
[54:09] you with are you going to let that stand
[54:12] between you and the love of God
[54:17] no
[54:19] these situations happen to us for a
[54:22] purpose
[54:23] per purpose
[54:28] for thy sake as it's written we are
[54:31] killed all the day long
[54:37] we are counted as sheep
[54:40] for Slaughter
[54:42] I believe God is teaching us to Shear
[54:46] all of our rights away
[54:50] share all of our pride away everything
[54:53] that we think of ourselves that's great
[54:55] in dignity
[55:00] we're not going to overcome the way that
[55:02] we overcome Revelations tells that they
[55:04] were came by the blood of the Lamb by
[55:06] the word of the testimony and they love
[55:08] not their lives unto death that's how
[55:10] you're going to overcome is when you
[55:12] really allow God just to
[55:15] have his way in your life
[55:19] nay and all these things we're more than
[55:21] conquers
[55:22] see there it is to him that loved us for
[55:27] I am persuade that neither death nor
[55:29] life nor angels or principalities Powers
[55:31] things present or things to come
[55:34] are you persuaded
[55:36] amen nor height in your death nor any
[55:38] other creature shall be able to separate
[55:41] us
[55:43] from the love relationship of God
[55:46] which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[55:50] though he slay me yet
[55:53] I trust him
[55:55] because there's a love affair
[55:58] we've been
[55:59] predestinated to God's nature
[56:02] nothing's going to separate us from the
[56:04] love of God
[56:07] we're more than conquerors I believe God
[56:10] has equipped us
[56:12] with everything that we need
[56:15] and brother Brandon makes this statement
[56:16] that inside of us
[56:20] is enough power to go create a world and
[56:23] go live on it
[56:25] so if we have a portion of the Holy
[56:30] Ghost
[56:31] there's a lot of power in that portion
[56:35] but we have to exercise it we have to
[56:38] utilize to it and and who am I to say
[56:40] you don't got to do this and you don't
[56:42] got to do that or you got to do this and
[56:43] you go I can't I can't be the one
[56:46] telling you what you need to do
[56:49] to have that power executed
[56:52] but if you listen to that still Small
[56:54] Voice and when he speaks to you through
[56:56] the word what you do just do it be as
[56:58] Mary said whatever he say do it
[57:01] just do it because it will bring results
[57:03] in your life
[57:06] now at one time the scripture was
[57:09] fulfilled in Matthew chapter 1 verse 23
[57:11] Behold a virgin shall can shall shall be
[57:15] shall be with a child and shall bring
[57:17] forth a son and shall call his name
[57:20] Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
[57:23] With Us
[57:25] God With Us
[57:30] but God didn't want it just to remain in
[57:32] one man
[57:34] God wanted to come inside of us
[57:37] in John chapter 7 verse 37 in the last
[57:41] day that great day of the feast Jesus
[57:44] stood and he cried saying if any man
[57:46] thirsts let him come unto me and drink
[57:52] thirst is the first requirement
[57:55] thirst you got to come to church with
[57:57] the thirst
[57:58] and then you got to drink
[58:02] if you were thirsty
[58:06] and say oh yeah I'm so thirsty I mean we
[58:09] were digging digging digging digging
[58:10] digging digging trenches
[58:14] brother Mark thought he was out working
[58:16] on the railroad
[58:18] it was so hot sweat
[58:21] I was so thirsty
[58:24] I asked Anne and please get me an orange
[58:26] juice
[58:28] she went and got me an orange juice
[58:30] but if I didn't drink it it wouldn't do
[58:32] me any good right
[58:35] right and you know how hard it is to
[58:37] drink when you're not thirsty
[58:40] and you know how hard it is to eat when
[58:42] you're not hungry
[58:46] so you have to activate
[58:48] The Thirst
[58:50] you have to activate it that the Bible
[58:51] says
[58:52] if they the hunger and thirst after
[58:54] righteousness shall be filled
[58:58] right so what do we do after we thirst
[59:00] and drink
[59:02] believe
[59:05] verse 3 he that believeth on me as the
[59:07] scripture said out of his belly shall
[59:10] flow rivers of Living Water
[59:15] now
[59:16] we're talking about well let's read the
[59:18] next verse but this speaking of the of
[59:20] the spirit which they that believe on
[59:22] him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[59:23] was not yet given because Jesus was not
[59:25] yet glorified so it's not so much a
[59:28] matter of God being in the church
[59:31] it's a matter of God being
[59:33] in the church
[59:37] it's not a so much a matter of the
[59:39] Miracles being out here it's a matter of
[59:42] the Miracles being right here
[59:45] where are you looking for the Miracles
[59:48] to take place
[59:51] what are you attracted to
[59:53] what is the word for
[1:00:05] I'm trying to provoke you to hunger for
[1:00:08] God inside of you
[1:00:09] amen because if you've got God inside of
[1:00:13] you you'll bring the miracle to church
[1:00:16] and you will be the one blessing this
[1:00:19] church
[1:00:21] you got to get off the seat of the
[1:00:22] scornful
[1:00:25] it's easy to sit back and say this is
[1:00:27] what missing this is what's missing this
[1:00:29] is what's missing
[1:00:31] but if you could come to church and say
[1:00:32] God's using me here
[1:00:34] God's using me here God is gonna God is
[1:00:37] going to do Miracles through me here God
[1:00:39] is calling me here
[1:00:42] that's what God's looking for for
[1:00:43] someone to stand up and say I'll be the
[1:00:45] one
[1:00:46] I'll be the one
[1:00:49] if God before us who can be against us I
[1:00:53] just want to close with this lesson of
[1:00:55] scripture second Corinthians chapter 4
[1:00:57] verse 7. God is inside of us to meet
[1:01:01] every need
[1:01:04] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 but
[1:01:06] we have this treasure in Earthen vessels
[1:01:12] it's no longer just in the church it's
[1:01:13] in me
[1:01:15] amen that the Excellency of the power
[1:01:19] may be of God and not of us
[1:01:25] I come to church to see God in you
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:31] amen that's what I come for
[1:01:35] it's not a social Gathering
[1:01:37] right not a place for Fellowship
[1:01:40] it's a place to meet God
[1:01:42] we are troubled on every side now I
[1:01:45] think this thing about Gideon here we
[1:01:47] are troubled on every side but your
[1:01:49] attitude is one of faith
[1:01:52] troubled on every side yet not
[1:01:54] distressed
[1:01:56] perplexed we are not we're we're I'm
[1:01:58] sorry we are trouble don't ever say yet
[1:02:00] not distressed we are perplexed but not
[1:02:03] in despair
[1:02:05] were persecuted but we're not forsaken
[1:02:09] we're cast down but we're not destroyed
[1:02:17] it's just part of a Christian walk
[1:02:20] always bearing about in the body in our
[1:02:24] body
[1:02:26] the dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:29] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:02:33] made manifest in our bodies unless
[1:02:35] you're willing to crucify the flesh how
[1:02:37] can the glory of God be seen in you
[1:02:39] right how are Miracles going to come
[1:02:40] forth if you do not allow this flesh to
[1:02:43] be totally dead if you're speaking ill
[1:02:45] of others how is God going to be
[1:02:48] manifested in you
[1:02:50] right you know God ain't going to be
[1:02:51] manifested through our knowledge
[1:02:53] through what we say it's the life that
[1:02:56] we're living
[1:02:58] so then death worketh in US
[1:03:03] but life in you see you want to perform
[1:03:06] a miracle die out let God have his way
[1:03:08] inside you
[1:03:14] amen we having the same
[1:03:17] self I'm sorry Same Spirit of faith I
[1:03:20] love that
[1:03:21] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:03:24] according as it is written I believed
[1:03:27] and therefore have I spoken
[1:03:31] we also believe
[1:03:32] and therefore speak
[1:03:36] so it's quite easy all you got to do is
[1:03:39] not so much what the question comes to
[1:03:41] you is it will come
[1:03:43] the questions will come to you where is
[1:03:46] God
[1:03:47] but
[1:03:48] you got to have the same Spirit of faith
[1:03:51] and answer back
[1:03:54] I believe the Lord is with me
[1:03:57] amen
[1:03:59] and if you know the Lord's with you what
[1:04:02] is there to fear
[1:04:04] what is it there's nothing to fear
[1:04:06] he's taken us through to the expected
[1:04:09] endless verse knowing that he which
[1:04:12] raised up the Lord Jesus
[1:04:13] shall raise up us also by Jesus and
[1:04:17] shall present us with
[1:04:20] you
[1:04:22] praise the Lord let's stand together if
[1:04:24] God be for us then who can be against us
[1:04:31] let's leave here living our lives like
[1:04:34] we're a real child of the king
[1:04:43] amen
