uh pray for that baby um and let it be just a miraculous healing and that we can give the Lord glory and and credit for that um also there was a Gabrielle wanted to have a testimony where's Gabrielle okay we'll skip that one for well have oh is she coming oh you got the baby there okay dad go fill in you want to come up here as much as I could talk to any of you personally and not be nervous I always get up here and immediately get nervous so forgive me um I was talking to somebody uh the other day and some things have transpired in in our life my life personally my walk with the Lord um but a lot of things that have affected my family and I was telling this person that I feel like I need to give a testimony but I I don't want to jump the gun if the Lord's got um a specific way that it's going to be shared or or what have you and this morning I woke up an hour and a half before my alarm went off and the song that I sang Over The Summertime with reys um God Will Make A Way is what I woke up to just in my mind and I could just like hear it like it was on a radio and um I was like all right lord well if you want me me to get up and and share these things then this is what I'll do so that song was on my heart if you haven't heard it I I uh encourage you to go find it and just listen to it because I stood here in front of all of you and sang that song just knowing that the Lord was going to make a way for me and my family and the things that I've been dealing with um so just a really abbreviated testimony there's so many things I can tell you but I just want to encourage you that whatever whatever it is that you're going through right now the Lord cares and we you might not see immediate results all the time but when it happens you're going to be moved amen um so nobody tells you when you first surrender your life to the Lord and you get baptized you may have dealt with hard things before but it's going to get harder and only by the grace of God can you make it through and um the Lord is just he's faithful okay so last summer I sang this song believing that the Lord was going to make way for me with these different situations and I just thought Lord I've already dealt with a lot of hard things how could it get any worse but it did and I kept saying to people that I would talk to and just share these trials with that were praying with me that I'm so boldly made the stand that I'm not backing down and I'm not going to stop coming to church I'm not going to keep making this stop making the sacrifice to have my children here especially on Wednesday nights when it would be so easy just to stay home and the Lord has been faithful we uh have had some real serious Financial struggle struggles and the Lord has been faithful we've had struggles with vehicles and the Lord has proven to be faithful I'm currently dealing with a situation with my children that I can't see a way out but he can and he has proven to be faithful amen we um that's right we we can try to figure out all these things on our own and we can you know go here or go there but if it's not his will it's not his what he has for us the door is going to continuously be closed and if that happens we know that we just do all that we can do and then we stand and just trust the Lord amen and every time I try to do something and I just don't have an open Avenue I just keep all right Lord whatever it is that you have with me and he has proven time and time again that he's faithful and brother Marty thank you for sharing that because I am a child of God and that is such a good thing to just remember and how wonderful is that we're his children he cares about the things that we care about amen so whatever you guys are going through right now whatever it is remain faithful because the Lord is faithful to us that's the truth amen amen praise the [Applause] Lord thank you sister Gabrielle um yeah all of us have something in our lives that is just very Troublesome uh I mean there's a lot of examples there that probably each and every one of us have had that situation and uh it's great to have that testimony just to rely on the Lord amen because he's the only one every time I've ever gotten involved in making a decision and it was only on me it's always failed 100% of the time I'll tell you um so I finally have learned that I can't relay on myself that's for sure um uh brother Orlando would you uh if we could just stand and uh pray for these requests that we uh spoke e heart are if uh brother Dennis could pray over the offering dear father to to chur amen you may be seated I do want to make a comment about the tithes and offerings that um I want to encourage everybody here we're all faced with a lot of bills every month and and sometimes it just seems overwhelming but um sister Kathleen and I got the Revelation about that many many years ago when we were first saved and I would encourage you to make that your first payment in the month before any of your bills even though it seems like you won't be able to uh do it but every time we did that we didn't have the money we didn't know where it was going to come from but somehow the Lord said prove me and uh he always did was through coupon or something it was just we found it was a way and and uh just be faithful and he will reward you for that so amen amen let's sing Sweet By and By amen there's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it a far for the father Waits over the way amen to prepare us a Dwelling Place there in that sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful Shore in the Sweet By and By we shall meet on that beautiful Shore shall sing on that beautiful Shore the melodious songs of the bless and our spirit shall sorrow no more not a sigh for the blessing of Rest In the Sweet By and By we shall meet on that view beautiful Shore in the Sweet By and By we shall meet on that beautiful Shore to our Bountiful father above we will offer our tribute of praise for the Glorious gift of his love and the blessings that hallow our days in that sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful Shore in the [Music] Sweet By and By we shall meet on that beautiful Shore amen praise the Lord that's going to be a great day amen uh let's sing When the Roll is Called Up Yonder your name's going to be on that [Music] roll when the when the trumpet of the Lord and the morning when the sa Shall Gather over on that other Shore and the roll is called Called Up Yonder I'll be there amen When the Roll is called up y When the Roll is Called Up [Music] Yonder

his ease and work his way up and uh I just might be there a little ahead of you guys amen praise the Lord um let's all stand and uh invite our pastor to come up he's been toiling hard I know many days and uh a lot of times we're all doing our thing and a lot of times I'll think about what is Brother John doing and you know he's over there studying for the next sermon so just want to show our appreciation to him and a blessing on him and his family amen so let's sing uh I love him as he comes I love him love him because he first loved me and purchase my Sal un breath tree I love him I love

[Music] calary Amen how many he thankful for the Lord Jesus for God so loved us that he gave himself at Calvary amen amen well God bless you this morning I'm going to be over here hope you don't stretch some of you stretch your necks a little bit to this side for for today God bless our our visitor again thank you for coming may the Lord Jesus bless you and bless each and every one of you we're very grateful for brother Marty just uh filling in just taking the Bow by the horns and helping um we got a call late from uh Brother Bruce he was on his way here maybe maybe about a third to a half of the way in and he started having uh car troubles and he had to turn around he made it home safe just after um the song service started and and we trust he's uh with us on the live stream this morning um I don't know if a request got in but let's pray for his vehicle and the situation God give him wisdom there on how to handle that I could say if uh of assuredly the devil did not want this service today I'm more sure of that than any other service I've ever attended and I've tended a lot to know that he is there but Satan is so against the service today but praise the Lord we're on The Winning Side amen turn with me if you would to the Book of Matthew chapter 28 we're going to read two scriptures one in Matthew 28 and 1 in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and in both of those set of scriptures we're going to read three verses 18 through 20 amen well usually you know this is the Super Bowl we're all probably not not may maybe some of us never thought about it but a lot of the world has woken up today thinking about that and I'll say probably all over the world it's a well-known thing but today we're going to talk about a super Great Commission amen amen a super Great Commission amen we'll read these scriptures and then have a word of prayer Matthew 28:18-20 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even until the end of the world amen amen and then second Corinthians chapter 5 God is given us a Ministry to send the light to all the world he said go ye out and preach the gospel to every creature that was the last commission the Great Commission and we call it a super Great Commission this morning 2 Corinthians chapter 5: 18 God speaking of what happens after we become Born Again become a new creature we get a new nature then he gives us a Ministry and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation or restoration to Wi that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God Amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer our heavenly father Lord as we approach you this morning there's a Thanksgiving in our heart this morning for all that you have done for us for that great sacrifice at Calvary Lord that today we could all stand here with a confidence and a faith knowing Lord that we are saved by the sacrifice that you made at Calvary Lord that we are trusting completely in your word that you cannot lie you've never failed and Lord by your grace you have shined your your spirit into our lives you've changed our nature we are in the midst of being changed more that's why we've come this morning to receive more of your Holy Spirit and father as we enter into this service we just pray that you'd forgive us of our trespasses our sins you cleanse us from anything that would be of disbelief or Lord that would be against the word of God we pray that you'd cover us with your blood that we could there be nothing standing between us and you as your word word would come forth and Lord as we'd hear these testimonies Lord may they just Inspire us may they just cause us Lord to be a greater Ambassador for you to work Lord to to to reach out to others to let them uh know Lord that uh what you've done for us that you can do for them bless each one now father we commit the service everything that be said and done for your honor into your hands and For Your Glory we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated this morning we uh we do have a lot on the plate today but this super thank you sweetheart I also want to thank Ann who spent so much time making this um presentable for for us to see she's put together a a a a PowerPoint presentation for us but we want to entitle this message the super great commission for our subject a mission report for 2023 now we live in a very big world out there and there's a lot of bad things happening amen it is so easy to get caught up in the things that are happening in the world and it can cause us to be over involved in those things but it can also cause us to recline and seclude F and come into a shell and only think about oursel to protect ourselves I don't want to get stuck living for myself amen I don't think we completely realize just how important this commission is I believe we need to make sure that we catch the vision we maintain the vision and then we carry out what Christ has asked us to do Bible says where there's no vision the people perish we're on a timetable we only got so much time to play our role brother Marty was talking about uh some of us are going to go by the way of the grave and and some are going to make a rapture we don't know when it's all in God's hands but I'll say this whatever time that you have on this Earth you want to make sure that you played the role that God wanted you to play for his kingdom because you play any role for anything down here it will accomplish it will matter nothing on the other side now don't misunderstand what I'm saying a cup of of cold water are given in his name is good but you can spend all your time working on the things of this world and it won't save one soul and and and and and God is interested in the saving of a soul and the changing of a nature that it can be ready for the other side now that's where God is at that's where his heart is at that's where I want to be amen so we must carry out the role that God has ordained for us brother Brandon says we must accept our responsibility to get the message out that Jesus Christ is coming soon and I love the Simplicity of that message the thing that we have because of this message we know what that means it's more than just a mouth confession it's it's it's more than just getting dunked in water it's more than just putting your name on the book it's more than just saying yes I'm in the message no it's a change of nature to where all things become Christ my brother here had asked me uh some some little time ago uh what I did did with the mission money and that's kind of what prompted this whole service today and uh I I I I would think there would be uh some others here that could benefit that didn't maybe know what we did with the mission money amen amen are you with me am man I wonder if there' be anybody here who knows what we do with the mission money who has an idea what we do with the mission money okay all right so we got a little we got a little mixture our our sister Gabrielle made mention uh yesterday that she she remember that when she was a little child she remember we would do these reports at the other church and I have not done these on a faithful basis but what I have tried to do to share is when we do get some reports in uh that periodically we would show them on the screen and this is what's happening in this country and this is this brother but we haven't just did a full report and by the grace of God we wanted to do that but when I was when that brother had had asked me about that I just said the first thing I was thinking about is I I I really don't uh like to let my right hand know what my left hand's doing you know Jesus said but what thou do when thou doest thy alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thine alms may be in secret and thy uh and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly in other words it's between us and God and that's the way it should be but we can't do that with other people's money when somebody gives you money to do something with you got to keep that open and you got to make that sure that's there and so I really really respect that this morning as we provide a report for 2023 I want to First Express my sincere gratitude to each of you that have given for missions in support financially and in your prayers because no matter what what amount that you've given it makes a difference it makes a difference and you're giving for the saving of souls amen amen May our heavenly father bless you for that I believe it's important that we store up Treasures in Heaven for 2023 this church has given a total of $ 7,426 for Missions let's take a look where your money has gone you want to do that amen and we're going to see a number of Brothers here on the board and each one of these brothers have taken time to put this together because I requested it and I want to thank them for their time that they did this for us and also uh they every each one of them wanted to send their uh Thanksgiving their appreciation to each of you for your prayers and for your support for them and they they pray for us and I I hope as we watch this that we'll get a a a a greater burden to pray for them amen all right I guess I am I supposed to start this all right oh no that's that all right all right now this is a very new uh brother to our support and um his name is seras serenus chinelli and he's from the same area or the the area that brother Samson shady is from and uh We've uh he for quite a long long time he has kept in uh connection with us and has never asked for money this has been wonderful but when he told of a need one time we we gave him some money to meet that need what he did it he there was a some poor people that needed some some clothes and um uh and some bibl so he I just sent him some money and he took it and he right away he got it and he he he he shared with the people and this brother goes out numerous times a week and he just shares the gospel with people it's it's a it's been a huge blessing uh to me because he's never asked for anything it it's it's that you you you you catch that and it it's so he'll just send reports and so um and here's just a a little a little video of just just a little uh uh Taste of what's Happening Here in India where we at right over here so we're FR over here and he's over here and I just think that's wonderful to to support um here is a brother now I just if I if I can you bear with me this is what he said about this brother greetings in his precious name the Lord Jesus Christ Our soon coming king after attending a prayer meeting I was returning home by a walk and I saw one unknown person walking on the other side of the road with a Bible in his hand when I saw that person the Holy Spirit told me go and speak the word of God and I walked across the road uh Road and I preached God's word to him for 10 minutes and then he started crying after listening to God's word I asked that brother why are you crying and he said that he had a lot of financial problems and he was going to commit suicide after listening to him I strengthened him in the word of God and made him stronger he said God has sent you to sent you to me to survive am I have explained I I had I have explained about water baptism acts 238 and he come out of the denomination and he accepted acts 238 was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe what the prophet of God said one soul is worth 10,000 worlds and he is believing the message of the hour and is standing for the truth in his area pray for him and his family and I just thought this is a wonderful testimony and he he he goes to so many many places and when I had inquired whether he was getting support he he didn't he said he wasn't getting support so um and I I believe him and I'll tell you why this right here uh we just you know we woke up uh going to say it might have been last Saturday I woke up and I was in prayer and just a burden for this man came on my heart and I just I went got some money and I sent it to him immediately I just knew that what the Lord wanted me to do and I didn't say what it was for or nothing I just I just wanted to support him because he just working for the lord well some about a week later uh or eight something like that maybe five days later he sends this picture and he bought this little sound system so he could go out and preach the gospel so he said he's going to use it in his and also when he goes out in both places like well he don't even have one you know so I just I was very thankful that this brother is seems to be a true brother I want you to pray for him uh know we've supported a number of Brothers in in India um and and brother one that we've supported a lot you all know is brother brother Boaz let me see all right so brother Boaz is also in India we're going over there right now where he's at and as you all know that he's taking care of Orphans and widows and lepers he's introducing the message to many not just people but uh pastors of denominational churches um baptized many and uh and I just got we got some pictures here I just wanted to bring to you and this is one of the brothers that we show periodically you see how dirty that water is but they still want to get baptized because we need to be baptized AP ized amen so we got some this is another time brother Boaz really seems to be working for the Lord now this uh video is you remember brother Moses he's the brother that passed away that he had he helped shared the message came out of the denomination and most everybody in his congregation left but he stayed true for like four years and started having the problems in the I think kidneys and liver and uh he had passed away he lived in this house never complained never asked for anything he's left the wife and two daughters and I want us to pray for them um because brother Bo feels that burden to take care of them I just just just a short video they don't look this is what they got for their their floor just a short clip that's that's it how many is going to pray with me all right all right let's go over to Africa you all remember brother Timothy Shan he's been here all right he he he was he wants God bless you um brother John and God bless you to little group uh over there in Flint Michigan and uh I just want to say thank you for all your support that

a he it's it's not a she it's not a he it's a them it's perverted so and he didn't want we don't want to buy those Bibles so we did find out that they're running they got more Bibles in just the regular NIV and I believe it's better to have the NIV than no Bible at all right can't get the King James and um so right now we're we're we're we're praying and we're g to probably do a joint effort with brother Donny Reagan and brother Ron Gilliam for 2,400 Bibles it's going to cost about3 $30,000 so I want us to be in prayer for God's leadership on that because if you don't get the word into somebody's language they're not going to understand so that's the one thing about doing lots of different missions in different areas they speak different languages so you got to make sure they get the Bible in their language amen so let's remember to pray for the bride there in Mala um that's just another picture of that now this here we're going to go over to the Philippines now I'm just going to say this about the Philippines in the past we've done a lot of work in the Philippines with brother roel um this last year we did not do as much uh we worked a little bit with sister Chi-Chi's wife and uh we helped construct um some you camp quarters we sent some money for that we've sent some money uh for for for sister uh uh Chi-Chi her home it was for for leaking and had some termite situation we also sent some money um uh I'm speaking just of 2023 to help uh the needs of their Church to help the church that she attends which was um brother Ro's Church to help with that building uh we're just trying to get um to befriend the new pastor and to try to help in that Mission Outreach because brother Ro had a very special burden for Souls a very special burden he did a lot of Outreach and uh it it's it it was wonderful so in the past you know we've we helped I think maybe the year before with some victims that went through the Hurricanes there so let's just pray for the Philippines pray for our sister and pray uh that we could uh be connected to help with what God would have us to help with there all right now we're going to go these are some before and after where we helped with uh I think we did show these you know prior so this is just hurricane victims that had we put the roof back on help their buildings okay this is Brother Jason dears now we're going into the Middle East here and uh brother Jason has been very uh he's had a burden on his heart for the Middle East and so we've helped support mission trips to Turkey meetings among the Persian churches we've also supported a trip to Egypt for some special meetings we've helped further the work of putting the revelation of the spoken word into the Arabic language and he's pictured here with brother Meli uh he's a pastor that is helping with the translation work and if you remember he was sentenced to prison and his sentence was not overturned in fact it's on delay uh to be to to go up in the spring and we need to keep him up in in prayer for when that happens he he just basically went into a building before they said okay you can go in as the construction was done so it's a real small technicality it isn't like there's any problems but um you know in certain places if you don't just told the line you can get in trouble right um our church has supported the translation of of the messages how the angel came to me his commission God of this even age into the Arabic language and we've also uh helped or did the printing uh supplied the funds for the printing messages of the Rapture and birth pains so I'm thankful to be associated with the work in the Middle East amen we've heard of enough bad things going on there it's good to uh be not overcomed of evil but overcome evil with good God God's going to get the seed to the predestinated he's just going to do it um want to read a letter now about our brother George Smith he's a brother that we've been uh supporting uh on a monthly basis and um you just please bear with me as you know there's a lot going on today we got to get to uh where the letters are at right can you say amen amen all right right uh can I just read one about brother Boaz first all right he said the church here is in prayer since the last two weeks especially for the Outreach to reach uh the last sheep for the kingdom of God we have been also praying for the needs of the Bible and the reason I'm reading this because I want us to pray for brother Boaz in this request for a Bible in Hindi and the g gura language in the remote tribal Village villages we we're they're visiting many of the people are asking for the message books in Hindi and the telu languages also brother and humbly ask you Saints to pray please remember the needs in your prayers that's why I want to read it because he want he's asking you to pray amen uh we sure appreciate your love prayer support all these years thank you for standing with us and the Bride of Jesus Christ in the Heathen country of India amen God bless you all right this is a just a letter that uh brother um our brother George Smith he's been with us we've tried to at times to uh help him in in in various ways but one way is is is just a monthly support he says dear brother martin is with great love that I greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus our lord um in these past 12 months we have seen seen many changes great and small and the difference between the wheat and the non-wheat has never been so clear amen um as we each fulfill our part in that final drama of the book of Acts it is a glorious hour for the Believers in deep appreciation for your continued prayers and support we have been able to print and distribute these much needed books in English and Spanish in many countries in particular in exposition of the seven Church ages the Seven Seals and other individual sermons we sincerely appreciate the invaluable help that our brother Barry coffee has rendered in helping with the printing so we brother brother Barry coffee does a lot of missionary work he's done uh is doing work there in Tanzania as as well um one of the larger outlays of the funds has been in the relief work telling us where the money's going where we are involved in Venezuela they are simply in a humanitarian crisis where a doctor may be paid $100 a month and a teacher may earn $75 a month and the less fortunate are regarded as slaves so we are helping groups of Believers in four different locations with food clothing medicine and shelter brother Brandon mentions the Barefoot missionaries I know many of those Gallant soldiers we are helping them as they carry out the orders of the Masters as recorded in Mark 16:15 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature we are consecrating our efforts in ven Venezuela ma Malawi and Honduras in each case they are baptizing new Believers every week by the God's grace no by God's Amazing Grace uh we were privileged to minister in these countries this past year Australia Chile Colombia Ecuador Mexico and many churches in US and Canada we conducted what may possibly be our last tour to Israel in June God is watching over his people we may return when there is peace in Jerusalem May God richly bless each of you as you display the fruit of the Gospel in dark leoda let me know if we can help you in any way isn't that beautiful oh we just appreciate our brother and all that he is doing uh speaking of Israel um see if we can get a this is Brother Colin he's just it's a it's an older picture but um right now the war in Israel has had effect on everyone there he said that the Believers are exhausted from the war so we know how to pray they've had to deal with rockets and explosions they're always having to contend with the sound of war and their thoughts but God has kept them he said and by the grace of God they have only missed a few Sabbath meetings although they are only meeting occasionally on their midweek which is Tuesday the church body is transitioning more into a Hebrew type of a Hebrew Service uh and they have started to do some online Outreach materials he said brother Colin has requested prayer uh that God would give him wisdom and Leadership uh for a church building because the it's extremely challenging uh What uh there in finding what they need with everything that's going on and he said we simply need a miracle so let's pray that God would bless brother Colin amen all right this is Brother Bill Sanchez I just I just wanted to put this every year he he's in he works with individual uals in different areas and he'll contact me and say this brother needs Bibles this this the this Widow uh she needs some money for this and so we'll we'll send him some money and and and he'll he'll funnel it so but we just appreciate him this is the brother you've been praying for that's bad on cancer in his throat he's been an interpreter uh for many many uh ministers but we appreciate the work that he has done to help individuals amen all right you happy all right we want to go into uh Honduras and uh we're going to go to tuser right now this kind of like the center hub from what we work out of down there there's a group uh called the alusma down there it means send the light in Spanish and our work in Honduras started many many years ago through brother mesic um he's you've heard me share some of the testimonies of him but we're not going to see any any pictures of him but he's really the root of everything that we're going to see here that's transpired To This Day 26 years ago I believe it was when it started with him amen this is Brother Carlos we're going to see a number of video clips now just do your best there we couldn't get the like a mail so you're going to hear a female interpreter um and but this brother here has been from the beginning when we went there he's the one that's kind of been in charge of all the distributions making sure that where it does go go is going a legitimate place um everything's backed up everything's on the board all the churches know about it down there there's nothing hid and there is a very very uh transparent transparency down there with with the money and he's just going to be greeting us but he's kind of spearheaded the work of a for a lzma he's been a faithful Steward our Lord Jesus Christ bless you Bel love Brothers hoping in his grace and mercy that each and everyone of you will enjoy his riches and most aident blessings my name is Carlos Omar el el and I'm an active member of the Spring Light VI Ministry an institution that has been a great blessing to many brothers and churches here in our country in Nicaragua in Costa Rica and in various places in our country as well since 2004 I have been elected to receive and deposit the aid we received from the sand the light Ministry through our brother JN Martin also the work he carry out is to withdraw the money make the transfer for the payments of radio programs General missionary works such as in CA Rica and Nicaragua missionary works also here in our country and the missionary work also Carri out by the biblical Tabernacle Church in the same way also when Aid comes for the assistance of established churches or the assistance for churches that are in the process of construction or what are the new fields that have emerged from the Evangelistic works that we carry out in the biblical Tabernacle Church as well as the help that must be given for the missions and Evangelistic campaigns that arise during all these activities currently I also serve as Secretary of the spreading light V Elma Ministry a Ministry that has been a great blessing since it has been this means for many souls to reach the feet of the Lord and many churches were established in the year 1998 our brother J Martin has been thly providing inconditional support for the missionary work here in the biblical Tabernacle in through the biblical Tabernacle to different parts of the country and different parts of Central America thanks you very much brothers for the great work for that great support that you give us and in that way together we can fulfill that great commissions throughout the world and announce their gospel to every catur and to those who believe and our Baptist will be saved God bless you all thanks amen praise the Lord I really love that he's such a precious brother yeah that that that country is a real it's a country that's filled with violence a lot of bad things have happened there and to be able to live a Godly life amongst evil is really wonderful it's beautiful amen um and is it okay to show these videos I know they're not like entertaining you know they're but their information they let you know where your money's going amen um alusma was what we set up at the very very beginning so we could make we just send the money there we know it's controlled I don't have to worry about you know the hundreds hundreds and hundreds of places it would go because I don't speak that language I don't know them but if I can just get it in the hands of somebody who will make sure it gets into the right place then God can do what he needs to do I've really tried to stay away from being controlling uh in that scenario as long as God puts it on my heart this is where it's got to go and we see the fruit of it that's all that's mattered to me now from the beginning we'd had a great bre when this was set up that the money would be used to reach new Souls into establish and that was the main thing I wanted to try to stay away as much as I could from established church churches because there's always need in churches we look at brother Stan this church is established but brother Stan is making this church better every time you come in you see construction Works been on since we've been done here and the reason I'm okay with that is when you come in I want you to believe that when you come to church you're coming under the construction of always getting better so when you see brother St working on something you see Works being done just know that we believe in continuous Improvement but uh not that we haven't helped establish churches we we've had but most of it has been starting from the beginning you send the radio uh we been doing radio broadcast since probably around 2,000 maybe even a little bit before um I'm pretty sure before we have but we got two brothers that have been with us the early uh 2000s 2003 and the radio goes out then we send uh Evangelistic ministers out there to to campaign in that area that here because you know you they when you hear on the radio you call in we here come to us they go and they get a group and they begin to evangelize there and establish and eventually they get a pastor and then you get you purchase land then you start building a church and so it's a continual work it's nothing that's done you know in three months but it's it's a vision it's a long-term vision and so that's what we've been doing there in uh the country of Honduras uh mainly but also we been in the other Central uh America countries as well so this is a one of the radio uh uh bro who just does radio broadcasting and Fact one time when I went down there and did a radio broadcast you got to be gifted to do that I mean I I when I'm when I'm talking to somebody about the Lord I want to look in their eyes you know I want I want to make sure they're paying attention to me but when you're doing a radio broadcast and you're just you know you're sitting in a room looking at somebody that doesn't understand the language that you're saying he's just you know you got an interpreter there's nothing there there's nobody to respond amen sometimes you know it's like it's here no there's no response so I had a hard time with that but you know when you're called to do a a a work on the radio you it's a special calling and this brother has it all right I'm sorry I got another one God bless you brother at this moment this is the brother Salvador Samora director of the program L and right now we are carrying out the radio program through the boys of the West and we are going on 923 and we are also on the internet we have reports from different places from here in the western part of H huras in both way on 923 and also online well for all over Honduras we also have reports from brothers who are listening and friends from the United States we still have reports from Spain Italy and Peru radio go who have reports to us that they are present and like the radio program mentioning a little about a hisory of the radio program l in was born there in the month of January 22 and we put the radio program on institution radio it was a great blessing and we had from 100 to 1,000 listeners because it covered several Departments of Hondas from here from the west and well at the at the time brother and Martin sent us Bibles and we gave them to the brothers and sister who request them that did not have a Bible every Monday I carry a box to give to the brothers and sister they were very happy in total we distribute only here on the radio program 2,250 Bibles includings of course in nango because gave them some to the brothers as well that they needed and the rest well to the listeners of the radio program we are very grateful to the brother Jen Martin who has supported us as I said at the beginning since the year 2000 back in the month of January and as I as I said at the beginning as well the brother has support us in a big way so we thank you very much and may the Lord bless you for the Bibles that you sent to give to these hearing brothers and also for that support that you just have greatly given to this program and to lose and man likewise we want to thank the brothers Inus galpa they s us shipments to the Brother Carlos orar El we thank you that the Lord bless you and we're very grateful for the support of the radio ministry here in the west God bless you all before we started in 2000 we had a number of Brothers doing radio broadcast we could have like eight or 10 radio broadcasts going with different brothers and it was kind of hard that was really where my heart was just to get it out get the word out but it was hard and all of a sudden we started having less and less less and less so I said brother brother M like what's going on and he and he says it just was not bringing forth the fruit that we needed to see and uh it's better to put your money where the fruit's coming you know because you don't got money to do all that you want to do right so you got to you got to use those coupons and do whatever you got to do to to make your money spread as far as it it can go all right and this is this is another brother who's also been he's an evangelist Pablo Mendoza and he's also um radio may God bless you brother Johan Martin for me it's a privilege to greet you in the name of Jesus Christ is Pablo Alexi Menda my name is Pablo Alexis mendosa evangelist from the Lord the Bible Tabernacle of Honduras I'm working in this since uh 2003 with the help of the Lord and the support of the pastor m mici Francis Moran we stting the missionaries work of the the department of Francisco [Music] Moran we establish a church on the place of with on Tabernacle Church and the church is there already Franc after that God allow us to go to kurar another place and start another work there is that beautiful so we have a building there uh in 90% the building done already so there are 42 uh Brothers uh coming to the church in that place so God bless us a lot in that place we also open another uh campus in another community in the same place of Kur so one place to the other place is between three hours of trip so the Lord also help us to start another H Church uh in Savana Grande Grande so we also b a land to build another uh building in that place okay so now these these brothers have been supported on a monthly basis from the beginning from from 2000 um and they're established they know how to do it and they're they keep on working for the Lord so this is where your your money goes your prayers uh are for for the missionaries for the work that's being done in Honduras now I'm not going to be able to to go through all these and we had to actually cut a number of these short because they're they're they're long um this is a brother um he's a field worker we need field workers right his name is brother Caesar Legos and he is working with a group introducing the the the message to them uh and and baptism and getting them established and we just appreciate that we're going to kind of skip him um and just please bear with me because of the time Factor here this

he prayed for a pastor and there was a pastor a pastor came and then the work began to to spread and we appreciate all that he's doing and I'm sorry to cut anything short um but we can listen to them at at any time that you would like to because we got so much on the agenda today and I don't know how much time I'm going to have with you but I also at the same time uh want to let you know the burden of what's behind in the mission field where our heart is at um this is uh a brother uh MCU uh Rubio and he's been with us for a a a long time God bless you brother J Martin I agreed you in the

church that has for example to have Sunday school and if the Lord will take time as I repeat to have meetings apart from with the with the young people is the desire of our hearts and our point is

Nicaragua is a is a country with uh needs and I just uh I just want to read what he said we give thanks to the Lord Jesus Christ for his Mercy because he has called us to speak the good news of the Gospel in different places and rough areas here in the country of Nicaragua we feel honored to share your vision and work for the kingdom of God we can testify in a greater way that the support we receive from you has been a blessing to families that believe this precious message we have baptized and prayed for miracles and every single time we have seen the Lord Is With Us responding to every need and people are repenting and giving their hearts to the Lord amen the missionary work is an inspiration to our hearts in such a way that we feel burden in our heart to continue preaching the message of the hour that the Lord sent to us to prepare a BRI PR for his coming receive our gratitude for the great work you are doing and we ask for your prayers for our church and the missionary work here in Nicaragua sincerely brother Nelson uh ronial ronial and so we appreciate him and the work that he's doing all right now this one this is a is is a clip here we're not going to play the whole thing but this is in Costa Rica we've been supporting this brother uh also uh um Faithfully for a number of years now and he's working in Costa Rica is hard because it's you know it's it's it's it's difficult area for whatever the reason certain areas are easier than other areas Costa Rica is a harder area we're just going to come over here to Costa Rica for a second and just here just a little bit Shalom beloved Brothers we greet you you in the Glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ with deep gratitude we report the war Carri out during 2023 in the Emanuel Tabernacle as you remember we were in the city of Gracia Costa Rica to this date we reach our 18th anniversary and during this year we have made an effort to improve the conditions of the annex bu building which we built at the end of 2019 and started using in January 20120 since then we have made partial improvements to house the ministerial offices the bookstore and the Sunday School there while the work is still in process we found a need to provide preventive maintenance on the roof because was the inclement of winters in the country in addition to investing in the electrical installation which until then we had not been able to carry out as you can see we proceed to supply electricity to the entire building is it is it just a little clip we can't do them all we just can only do a little bit but you got a taste there uh and he didn't really share his Outreach but they're reaching out they're baptizing they're getting the word out but he's been a faithful a faithful brother now this is just a piece of where your money is going for the mission field there's other places I'm sure there's other testimonies many of which I don't even know I'll be honest with you but I know on the other side we will we will find out amen now that seems to be a lot of mission work for 7,000 , 426 don't you think remember God can take what little you give and multiply it yes I remember one year we sent a whole a whole semi full of Bibles down and um we thought we were doing good when we could buy the Bibles for like three and a half bucks but if you keep working and you got a heart for Missions you can come up with a way to save a lot of money we were able to get on a program where you could buy buy H buy one and get one free after you buy so many we were able just to set a whole semi I mean hundreds we've sent hundreds of thousands of Bibles overseas and you just got to have a heart for you know the all the semis we've done the golf outings and things of the past but um we did help some of course with this we were able to add to that 7,000 another $ 78,79 well brother John you probably gave out of your abundance well no I have a $360,000 mortgage I have a car payment I have monthly payments just like you I could easily use that money for myself this year brother John you must have had a good year no not necessarily we're actually L lot a lot like half that we were last year as you already know I don't believe in doing my alms before people the fact that somebody had asked me what I do with my money shows that I don't talk about much about it remember a minister came back one time after doing a missionary trip and he came and he said I have to go overseas to find out what brother John is doing in my backyard overseas because I just don't talk about it but I want to encourage you to know and also to have a scope of the missionary work that we do here the scripture says to know them that labor among you in one sense I want you to know who I am and what I do in another sense it's between me and the Lord but I believe our family has spent hundreds of thousands and I'll say this at one doubt me if it's Millions honestly millions of dollars since I've started overseas and that's not money that had come in and been given to me well brother John how did you make that happen it's real simple you are just consistent in giving just be consistent don't wait till you get a lot don't wait till you get just start giving get start with giving your time your prayer remember brother Dan daisley at the beginning he told me he says if you're going to work for the Lord you better have tough skin because the devil is going to be against it and so is everybody else amen and I tell you that's why I say the devil was against this morning he really was I heard the prophet say missionary work is always in the will of God I've invested in in a number of things I've invested in people and businesses but I'll tell you one thing the one investment that's been true has been the right investment for me has been investing in the kingdom of God I've never regretted it I believe this super Great Commission of God is always in the will of God that we should be reaching out I've had people who criticize but I also have those that encourage me as well I that people who criticize me but if the Lord be with you who can be against you that's right I've always preferred taking the back seat to others but I'll say it like this it has never stopped me from working in the back seat for the Lord amen because I'm not much I'm not anything I've to this day I don't want to be behind a Pulpit and preach it's not in my desire to stand in front of people and to talk but there's an overwhelming desire inside of me has been from the beginning to help people it's a love in my heart to help people and that's why I'm here I love working for my savior and I can't wait to meet him Amen to see him face to face do you got time if I read just a couple prophecies where this this all started amen this is 27 years ago um and these prophecies have all been signed as of the Lord verily verily I say thus sayeth the Lord thy God oh thou son of the Living God I knowest thy coming in thy going out how thou Dost walk uprightly before me Y how thou whom I have put a burden upon thine heart to do a work for Mission sayeth the Lord it is no secret that thou has this desire sayeth the Lord yay verily I say unto thee Oh thou son of the Living God is it not written in my word yay that without a vision the people Shall Perish yay I say unto thee yay I say unto the church so now he's he's talking to the church to thee and to the church and I don't know I'd like to say that sister Genie might have been there for that prophecy I say I say unto thee I say Toto the Church of the Living God yay where is the burden for lost souls where is the burden for one another sayeth the Lord thy God y for many are preoccupied doing this and doing that that going to and fro and seemingly have lost

Living God continue ye in this work for the Lord thy God yay for It is Well pleasing in my sight yay Thou shalt be rewarded beyond measure Thou shalt see the manifestation of the glory of God in this thus say the Lord thy God now the thing that has always stuck with me all these years was continue continue it is so easy to just work up some energy to do something for God and say okay I did something I'm going to just go do live my life and do my thing but if your life belongs to God yield it unto God he'll use whatever you give him if you want to be a lot he'll use a lot you want to be an Abraham he was an Abraham he said it took a 100 lots to be one Abraham I'll just say it like this you got a life give it to God and and he'll bless it next one verely verely I say and this is you know maybe near nearly a year later later verely verely I thus sayith the Lord thy God oh th son of the Living God yay I know I knoweth a burden upon thine heart for the mission field sayeth the Lord yay I say unto thee be thou not persuaded by man be thou not in infuence my man sayith the Lord thy God now this is where the money is going to go and God's telling me don't be persuaded by man don't be influenced by man yay for there would be some that are not sincere that's just the bottom line God knows who but would have you to contribute to their cause sayeth the Lord thy God everybody's got their own agenda yeay therefore I say unto thee be thou patient and wait upon the the Lord thy God for I knoweth the burden upon thine heart yeay the bird that thou Hast for the mission field in that area I shall make that burden stronger sayeth the Lord thy God Thou shalt and thou shalt know what to do in that hour sayeth the Lord thy God ye for I shall lead thee by my spirit sayeth the Lord and that decision shall come from me and I shall lay it upon thine heart thus sayeth the Lord thy God now I believe in the realness of God leading every one of our lives but it can't just be this is what I want this is what I imagine this is what I feel like doing and that's God no that ain't God you'll know it's God when you can't do nothing but that and then God backs it up right we got too much of this uh uh this is what I feel and I think and you need to be sure be sure all right a little more than a year later here the next one I just going to read four and I because it's the foundation of you given to missions here what you know I want you to know what's behind this verily I say unto thee thus sayith the Lord thy God oh thou son of the Living God I know the desires in thy heart to do a work for me sayeth the Lord yay verily I say unto thee that thou art already doing a great work for me sayeth the Lord but in thine heart thou desirous to do more what is wrong with me I can't help it it's there yay verily I say unto thee it is written in my word make thy calling election sure sayeth the Lord thy God yay I shall not hinder thee sayeth the Lord whatsoever thou doest uh whatever thou doest uh whatever thou desirest to do excuse me for the Lord thy God yay verily I say unto thee put thy hand to the plow sayeth the Lord thy God for my fields are already white unto Harvest but the laborers are few ah I'm so sorry that I was quoting the scripture then let me let me reward that yay for the fields are already white unto Harvest but where are the laborers question mark so he's asking the question where is the labor thus saith the Lord th god well that you're feeling in your heart you're feeling in your heart to do something for God I'm just going to say start doing it don't wait we're running out of time you believe that don't you brother Dennis yes amen all right little more than a year later verily verily I say unto thee thus sayith the Lord thy God oh thou son of the Living God it is written in my word that without a vision the people Shall Perish yay but ver I say unto thee that thou has a vision sayeth the Lord thy God thou has a vision for lost souls a vision that not many have in this day sayeth the Lord thy God for this and for this I and well pleased and with the work that thou art doing for me sayeth the Lord thy God yay verily I say unto thee yay be thou Not Afraid when an opportunity Now you listen to me you you young people you listen to me everybody brother Dennis I know you believe this verely verely I say to thee be thou Not Afraid when an opportunity would come to thee to witness for me and to speak for me sayeth the Lord thy God yay for verily I say unto thee for Moses was afraid therefore I say unto thee be thou not afraid for as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee sayith the Lord thy God y verily I say unto thee that that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and I am leading thee by my spirit yay for thou has a burden for law Souls yay and I say unto thee I will give thee Souls through the fruits of thy labor thus sayeth the Lord thy God I used to it's been years it's been a number of years that I went to Wal a game but I went one a number of times I I would take my computer and I'd be working on my uh my my my notes and I take my Bible and I'd be working on a sermon and I would sit there many times and I'd look at all these people and I would think they have no Shepherd amen they have no Shepherd and I be it would just it would just burden me and I'd cry about it and and and what I've learned is that people don't want a Shepherd they don't want somebody watching over their soul they want somebody for what they can get from them naturally what they could get when they help me with this help me with that but that that is not the call of a Shepherd it's not just but you have to take care of those things as well but notice it's about souls it's not just getting somebody saved it's getting them to the nature of Christ which takes a lot of cooperation now you know tithes and offerings are part of every service we come and we pray over the offerings and I think we just kind of get through that real quick I think we should really really put our heart to the mission field now I'm not here to say you need to get give more than you're given I'm not I'll be honest if nobody gave anything I know what I'm doing next year I know what I'm doing the year after if God would te I know where I'm going I know what God wants me to do as brother Bruth was talking about finding your place in the scriptures I found my place in the scriptures but I want to inspire you because I do believe that some of you are ignoring the things that God wants you to do so I think when we take up an offering we should really really be sincere and pray over that and some of you might know I've never taken anything out of the ties and offerings for myself or my family it's the god truth I never have when I would go and preach in another church they' give me an offering I'd say no but if they made me take it I'd put it right back into the missions I've never used a penny from the people if I can just say this I have been here for one reason and that's to serve you Amen to serve your family to help you to help you make a Rapture to get to the other side as the prophet said the scripture says to watch over your soul and to be an example of what it really means somebody has to take the oversight make sure no evil spirits deceptive Spirits get behind the pulpit somebody's got to do that Amen to be an example of what it really means to live for others I've been here for you God's given me the ability to work and you know if anybody's ever worked with me you know I like to work I love to work I'm thankful that you know there are people that don't have their legs or arms they can't do things you know what I mean I'm just grateful that I still have them I want to keep going as long as I can now you just bear with me okay we're almost done can you is that okay thank you brother BR said in the message the my life story he says now I've I I never took up I tried to take up an offering in my life I and I failed on that but I I never would let me do it I never wouldn't let me do it I worked and I pastured the brandham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville which is a inter denominational institution I worked every day sometimes with a pack and a shovel a pick and a shovel sometimes a patrol sometimes in the line work and so forth worked 12 years in Pastor a church and never received one penny not one cent now what I chose to do never had anything to do I just got this quote honestly about uh about about a week ago this quote but it's between you know people that I'm going to say this your ties go to the ministry your ties that's what the prophet taught that's what it should do you should pay your tie you should give offerings to make sure the light stay on you should get a burden for souls for the mission field because there's people overseas that are are searching they given their life searching for the for the seed amen now he says not not as I got anything against against anyone a minister he's he's to live by the gospel but I was young and I was healthy why shouldn't I work and not to be obligated to the people that's just how I feel not because that there wouldn't be there wouldn't do it they would they would be glad to do it but I just felt like if the rest of them worked then I'd work also so I worked and paid my ties right at the church I believed in paying ties and God is has blessed it to me millions of times and I never would take up offerings I told you believe the other day how I tried to take up my first offering wife and I would get a tough spot where we couldn't make the ends meet many of you know what I'm talking about so I told her I said well I'm just going to take up an offering over at the church and she said well I'm going to come over and watch you do that and she sat down in the back a a little piece from me a little piece from me the way they talk back then and all the time my heart was failing I just kept talking around different things directly I said oh I forgot I said I I got to take up an offering tonight for myself I said I hate to ask but I just got in a snag and I got to get through and I looked around and blessed their hearts I knew some of them that are in here here this afternoon were there and I I have happened to look and sitting to my right and a little old mother uh was wearing a little old gingham I guess and whatever kind of clothes I don't know nothing about the goods that women wear so the little old dresses on and you know the little pockets beneath her apron and she went down there like that like Grandma used to have and she uh brought out one of them little old pocket books you know that you snap over the top and she was reaching down uh after those nickels and I looked around and I thought oh my that would haunt me as long as I lived if I took that I just couldn't do it the Deacon then went and he got my hat and was going to pass the hat and I I looked at that and my I felt a big lump come up and I said well I said now look I was just teasing you but I really didn't mean that I just wanted to see what you would say he just couldn't do it and my wife looked at me I just I just when I'm reading this I'm thinking just like when Jesus looked at Peter when he denied him you know like I knew and we really had an obligation that had to be met but you know what I had an old bicycle over home and I went and sold that old bicycle and went and and we got uh we got to meet the that obligation didn't have to take up an offering after all so I never want myself tied to any Earthly thing I Want to Be Free where I can study the word of God amen amen amen God loves a cheerful Giver amen he loves a cheerful Giver uh it's been my greatest honor to serve the Lord amen most of which is just not done here honestly we all can be working for the Lord more than just the little time that we're here at the church don't you believe that I want to read a scripture here in 1 Corinthians 15:57 and 58 we're closing it up here but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord I mean when you read the Bible you've got to believe that that scripture is speaking to you you don't want to read the Bible like some Ouija board you don't want to read the Bible like oh maybe there's only three scriptures are for me you got to fall in love with that word fall in love with the whole word man shall live by every word of God I'm grateful all these years to know that trusted tool really belongs to God Amen he just he had me be just a little Steward over it and you know he just said one thing to me occupy till I come occupy so by the grace of God that's what I've been doing with all my money for my money outside of the money that you see over there and the money that I'm going to have to work more to pay off the mortgage you know what I'm trying to say but every year it's been able to support God's missionaries and it's been a great honor for us the last scripture I want to give you is in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 if you want to stand Hebrews chapter 6:9 but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and the things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed towards his name in that ye have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire now here it is that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope on to the end and that you be not verse 12 that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen I trust that you've been encouraged inspired to give more to the Lord I would never ask you to give money but I am asking you to give your life God will take care of the rest let's labor in prayer let's labor in love support his work if you just come here and you're dedicated to pray a half hour before service you know what that shows me you're serious yes it shows me that you're serious and and that's what makes you more spiritual you see brother BR says you want to be more spiritual read your Bible and pray amen it's real simple ABCs but you got to take time to do that make time give all that you have to the Lord give your heart give your life and I'll say this give a life full of your heart because where your treasure is there will your heart be if your treasure is winning souls for the Lord you're going to put your heart to go there to it don't make God serving God Church some sort of offshoot or bu just a a little arm of your life make Christ the center of your life because cuz he's just looking for one man one man in his hand can turn the world upside down now you may not about to turn this whole planet but you can turn your world around amen you can do a lot for the Lord amen let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer maybe with every eye closed if there' be someone here today says brother John I want to catch that Vision I want to maintain that vision would just lift up your hand I'm going to pray for you amen God bless these hands amen amen amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the your people Lord the the desire that you placed in their hearts Lord my hands are lifted with theirs Lord I pray that you would increase the burden for lost souls Lord a love the same love that you have for them place that in our heart that we could love them the same Lord there's so many things that we could get involved with down here in this Earth but Lord where we want to be involved is in the things that are Eternal our time our effort remember your Prophet talking about that Queen of Sheba going down just said that if I found the truth I'd give everything to support it I'd give my time Lord I pray that you would bless your people give them the desire of their heart you saw their hands were lift you see the desire that they have one day Lord we're all going to meet you we all stand before you we all give an account what we did with our time our money Lord I pray that you'd make us more mature Lord that we could work together that we could put shoulder toosh shoulder prayer to prayer heart to heart and that we could reach out to as many Souls as possible Lord whether it be through the finances of this church or Lord whether it be just our own time when we're not at church to make a phone call to meet somebody in the store the gas station Lord lay Souls upon our heart when that soul through US Lord use us for your honor and for your glory Lord may you continue Lord to inspire each and every one of us Lord though we don't talk
