[38:30] you today to to to hear from you Lord
[38:34] and I I pray for the anointing of the
[38:36] Holy Spirit may it be upon each of us
[38:39] Lord may you break the bread of life to
[38:41] us may you help us to get out of the way
[38:43] that you may speak words of life into
[38:46] each one of us let us leave here
[38:49] today Lord so much more powerful than
[38:53] when we came in equipped to face the
[38:55] enemy at every turn am just grow to that
[39:00] statue of a perfect man as Brother Bruce
[39:01] had said just to overcome that we can
[39:04] wear a crown Grant it Lord we commit the
[39:07] service bless these scriptures and may
[39:09] they be accompanied with salvation we
[39:11] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[39:15] Hebrews chapter 6 verse number
[39:18] n but beloved we are persuaded better
[39:22] things of you and the things that
[39:25] accompany salvation
[39:28] though we thus speak amen we'll be
[39:31] coming back to this chapter but we want
[39:33] to read just a few in Colossians chapter
[39:36] 3: 8- 10 Colossians chap 3:
[39:42] 8-10 so we see here there's certain
[39:45] things that accompany a man that is
[39:47] saved and here Paul is saying in the
[39:50] book of
[39:51] Galatians there is we we do away with
[39:54] certain things and we add on certain
[39:57] things verse 8 says but now ye also put
[40:00] off these anger wrath ra malice
[40:05] blasphemy filthy communication out of
[40:07] your mouth lying not one to another
[40:10] seeing you put off the old man with his
[40:12] deeds and have put on the new man which
[40:17] is renewed in knowledge after the image
[40:21] of him that created him amen God bless
[40:25] you you may be seated so we see here we
[40:27] could just look at verse number 12 put
[40:30] on therefore as the elect of God holy
[40:33] and beloved bows of mercy and kindness
[40:36] humbleness of Mind meekness
[40:39] longsuffering forbearing one another and
[40:42] forgiving one another If any man have a
[40:44] crow against any even as Christ forgave
[40:47] you so also do ye and above all these
[40:50] things put on charity which is the bond
[40:53] of
[40:54] perfectness so we see here that there's
[40:57] a there's a putting off of certain
[40:59] things and then there's a putting on of
[41:01] certain things and we're going to go
[41:03] back here to the book of of of of
[41:05] Hebrews and we see here um that there's
[41:08] things that accompany
[41:10] salvation many people want to say
[41:13] they're saved and they don't think about
[41:15] anything else they just claiming that
[41:16] they're saved based on a few things so
[41:20] here this this this book of Hebrews is
[41:24] really a to me it's a great book about
[41:27] you need to continue to move forward yes
[41:30] the whole book is we see here chapter 6
[41:33] this is verse one therefore leaving the
[41:34] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[41:36] us go on unto Perfection right and not
[41:42] just laying hands of the uh laying hands
[41:45] uh laying again the foundation of
[41:46] repentance from dead works and Faith
[41:49] toward god of the do doctrine of
[41:51] baptisms and of laying on of hands and
[41:53] of the resurrection of the dead and
[41:55] eternal judgment in this will we do if
[41:58] God permit for it is impossible for
[42:02] those who were once enlightened and have
[42:04] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[42:06] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[42:08] tasted the good word of God and the
[42:10] powers of the world to come if they
[42:12] shall fall away to renew them again and
[42:15] to repentance seeing they have crucified
[42:17] to them themselves the Son of God aresh
[42:18] and put him to an open shame for the
[42:20] Earth which drinketh in the rain and
[42:22] cometh often upon it and bringeth forth
[42:24] herbs meat uh for them by whom it is
[42:27] dressed receiveth the blessings from
[42:30] God but that which is uh what beareth
[42:33] thorns and Briars is rejected is nend to
[42:36] curse him whose end is to be burned but
[42:38] beloved we are persuaded better things
[42:40] of you the things that accompany
[42:42] salvation though we thus speak so we see
[42:44] here
[42:45] that so many start on with Christ they
[42:49] they they repent they get baptized they
[42:51] say I'm going to be a Christian I'm
[42:52] going to serve God my life's going to
[42:54] change my life's going to become new
[42:58] and then there's this great battle the
[43:00] same battle to me that the children of
[43:02] Israel had when they came out of Egypt
[43:04] to continue moving marching through all
[43:06] the trials until they hit the promised
[43:08] land and we our promised land is the
[43:10] nature of God inside of us that is then
[43:13] that is our Promised Land it isn't
[43:15] saying I got the holy ghost that is not
[43:19] it because until we see it manifested in
[43:22] our life till All Things become like him
[43:24] I say we need to keep marching forward
[43:28] and if we just have that kind of
[43:31] attitude but we see here that that
[43:34] there's this tendency to try to stop but
[43:36] yet the blessings still come the rain
[43:38] still comes down it falls on the just
[43:40] and the
[43:41] unjust and and and and and and fruit
[43:45] comes but the ones where it's the Briars
[43:48] and the Thorns you know they get blessed
[43:52] but remember at the end they get
[43:54] burned they don't make it
[43:58] so the the the the message comes out
[44:00] it's like a warning a Stern warning look
[44:02] there's there's better things they're
[44:04] persuaded of you don't go by them don't
[44:08] live like
[44:09] that there's things that accompany
[44:12] salvation and we need to put away the
[44:14] old
[44:15] man we need to start acting like
[44:19] Christians that's what the word is for
[44:22] it isn't just there well yeah that's a I
[44:24] I see that's a good book and that's what
[44:25] we should be doing but it's not that
[44:27] Bigg a thing no it has to be there's not
[44:30] going to be any Christians up there that
[44:31] are full of anger that truth like want
[44:35] to punch somebody's eyes out and
[44:37] gossiping and and this and that that
[44:39] won't be up in
[44:43] heaven one thing that accompanies
[44:45] salvation is the spirit that brought us
[44:49] salvation the Holy Spirit should be
[44:51] accompanied with us amen Jesus said I'll
[44:55] send back the comforter of the the Holy
[44:58] Ghost in Galatians 5:22 says that the
[45:01] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[45:03] long suffering gness goodness Faith
[45:05] meekness Temperance so this should be
[45:08] accompanying us amen true if the I I I
[45:14] if the Holy Ghost brought us salvation
[45:16] the Holy Ghost is with us and this is
[45:18] the fruit of the Holy Ghost
[45:21] right Jesus said in Matthew 7:16 ye
[45:24] shall know them by their fruit
[45:28] yes well we just read what the fruit of
[45:31] the spirit is and he says do men gather
[45:34] Grapes of thorns or figs of
[45:36] thistles absolutely not even so every
[45:40] good tree bringeth forth good fruit
[45:42] every crup tree bringing forth evil
[45:43] fruit amen now that's pretty clear but
[45:48] here's the big deal here's the big deal
[45:51] it's that great area in
[45:53] between every good tree cannot bring
[45:56] forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt
[45:58] tree bring forth good
[46:00] fruit every tree that bringeth forth not
[46:03] good fruit is he down and cast Into the
[46:05] Fire wherefore You by their fruits you
[46:07] shall know them now here's the
[46:09] thing there is the possibility I'm going
[46:12] to just say a mixed tree is not good
[46:16] tree true it is an evil tree now when we
[46:19] look at evil we look at his pure devil
[46:22] black evil there ain't no good in it but
[46:25] remember the two trees that the two
[46:27] spiritual trees that were in the garden
[46:29] one was a mixed tree it was a tree of
[46:32] knowledge of Good and Evil so there was
[46:35] good in it so there is the possibility
[46:38] of Believers being good but yet being
[46:40] evil and and and Jesus is saying you'll
[46:43] know them by their fruits right so here
[46:46] again the scripture is pointing us that
[46:49] we need to go on to Perfection we need
[46:51] to we need to continue to knock off the
[46:53] old man that that's still there and not
[46:56] being s satisfied with with whatever
[46:59] we're looking
[47:02] at so we're not we're not excited about
[47:05] a tree where we see two
[47:08] Spirits bearing two fruits two
[47:11] Spirits
[47:13] amen wherefore by their fruit you shall
[47:16] know them for God has not given us the
[47:19] spirit of
[47:20] fear right that doesn't accompany
[47:23] salvation but of power and of love and
[47:25] of a sound mind that's right amen don't
[47:29] you think God gives us more than a form
[47:31] of
[47:32] godliness absolutely he gives us power
[47:34] to
[47:36] overcome he gives us love to live for
[47:38] others he gives us the mind of Christ
[47:40] let the mind that was in Christ be in
[47:42] you amen so this is this this is what
[47:46] accompanies salvation and we have every
[47:48] right to demand it in our
[47:52] life you know excuse me for saying you
[47:55] know I I don't ever like saying you know
[47:57] but I say you know isn't that
[47:59] terrible of course you don't know my dad
[48:02] used to
[48:03] say but I say you know dad he says no I
[48:06] don't know you're telling this one so
[48:08] tell me so I do
[48:17] know and I completely lost my train of
[48:20] thought on that so we're all on the same
[48:24] page together
[48:27] I am not going to fake that
[48:35] one it came back it came back God said
[48:38] it gives grace to the
[48:39] [Laughter]
[48:42] humble we have such a tendency of of
[48:46] being able to see where other people are
[48:49] at or at least we got a good opinion
[48:53] right but the thing is this gospel is
[48:55] for me yes amen right do I have a sound
[48:59] mind yes do I have power do I have love
[49:04] not noticing when other people aren't
[49:06] showing it because the quicker we get
[49:10] to uh where God wants me to be the
[49:13] quicker we are actually be able to help
[49:16] people because our words telling people
[49:18] just don't help people it's the life
[49:21] it's the life that the demons tremble
[49:24] but God is persuaded better things of us
[49:27] the things that accompany salvation one
[49:30] thing that should accompany salvation is
[49:32] a good attitude yes because it took a
[49:36] good attitude to actually get
[49:39] salvation we had to Humble
[49:43] ourselves I I mean we didn't care
[49:45] nothing about God we didn't go looking
[49:47] for God and God knocked on the door and
[49:48] said you're going straight to
[49:50] hell he got our attention somehow we saw
[49:54] the goodness of God amen and we had to
[49:58] repent that's a good
[50:00] attitude repentance is a good
[50:05] attitude and we know what happens if a
[50:08] good attitude does not continue to
[50:10] accompany salvation I want to tell you
[50:12] this Hebrews 3:14 for we are made
[50:15] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[50:19] beginning of our confident steadfast to
[50:21] the end we must maintain a good attitude
[50:27] now our attitude can seem like an
[50:30] insignificant element in our lives but
[50:32] it makes a great
[50:35] impact oh but brother John I focus on
[50:38] faith I believe Faith does I say yes my
[50:42] dear brother and sister but you can't
[50:44] have faith without a right
[50:47] attitude you can't just have a negative
[50:50] attitude and say you got faith you it's
[50:54] impossible God is not going to bless us
[50:57] with faith when we're murmuring
[50:59] complaining gossiping being negative not
[51:03] caring not trying just have a bad
[51:05] attitude and we expect God to give us
[51:07] Faith about
[51:10] situations we've heard attitude is a
[51:12] small thing that can make a big
[51:14] difference brother bam said the right
[51:16] mental attitude towards any Divine
[51:18] promise of God will bring it to pass so
[51:20] if a right attitude can bring the divine
[51:23] presence down from heaven in our have
[51:27] what will a wrong attitude
[51:30] do it will bring down the presence of
[51:33] the Demonic world to work against
[51:37] us think about that if a right attitude
[51:40] will bring the Divine Promises of God to
[51:42] pass what would what will a bad attitude
[51:45] do it will bring the Demons of Heaven
[51:48] down to destroy your
[51:52] life but we don't think about it like
[51:55] that how can it work one way but not the
[51:58] other Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not
[52:01] against flesh and blood but against
[52:03] principalities against Powers against
[52:05] the rulers of Darkness of this world
[52:06] against spiritual wickedness in high
[52:09] places now those are what comes down
[52:11] when our attitude is I don't really
[52:15] care I don't feel like
[52:17] trying I don't care what he says I don't
[52:20] care what she
[52:22] says you are bringing down hell right to
[52:25] you with a bad
[52:29] attitude great quote from Charles Sendo
[52:32] attitude is more important than
[52:34] facts it's more important than the past
[52:36] than education the money circumstances
[52:39] than failures and
[52:41] success than what other people think say
[52:43] or do is more important than appearance
[52:47] ability or skill it will make or break a
[52:52] business a home a friendship in
[52:57] organization the remarkable thing is I
[53:01] have a choice every day of what my
[53:04] attitude will
[53:06] be I can I cannot change my
[53:09] past I cannot change the actions of
[53:12] others around
[53:14] me I cannot change the
[53:17] inevitable the only thing I can
[53:20] change is my
[53:23] attitude life is 10% what happens to me
[53:27] and 90% of how I react to it but notice
[53:32] how we react is how we think it really
[53:39] is and we should be focusing on us the
[53:44] other 90% yes sir not about what we see
[53:47] out
[53:48] here because you can't change a lot of
[53:51] stuff out here especially when you just
[53:53] brought down hell
[53:57] when negga when you're when we're
[53:58] negative we can't deal with stuff you
[54:00] know what I'm talking about how many
[54:01] times you just had to walk away just
[54:03] walk
[54:04] away right but with the sound mind you
[54:07] can give a soft answer and turn away
[54:11] wrath because you got the power of God
[54:13] right
[54:15] there a quote I I
[54:18] read it they give the credit to Thomas
[54:22] Jefferson but they say it's incorrect
[54:25] but that's all we could fine says
[54:27] nothing can stop the man with the right
[54:29] mental attitude from achieving his
[54:33] goal and nothing on Earth can help a man
[54:37] with a wrong mental
[54:39] attitude nothing can help him
[54:44] true the power of our attitude that's
[54:47] the name of our service today the power
[54:49] of our
[54:51] attitude people with the wrong mental
[54:53] attitude are really troublemakers
[54:59] they cause problems in the church home
[55:02] the workplace road rage in the store
[55:05] we've seen
[55:08] it how many times you you you I'm I'm
[55:11] it's been a while but I I remember going
[55:13] to the going places and hoping the kids
[55:15] didn't act
[55:17] up all right don't be a troubl
[55:22] maker I'll say this a wrong mental
[55:25] attitude
[55:27] really brings about making
[55:30] trouble but it's it's not always how we
[55:34] think there are peacemakers they have
[55:36] the right mental attitude there are
[55:38] troublemakers they have the wrong mental
[55:41] attitude peacemakers they care they want
[55:44] peace and they're willing to lay down
[55:46] their life to get it we're troublemakers
[55:50] they don't care they're selfish and they
[55:53] cause trouble around others they don't
[55:55] care people are affected by how they
[56:01] act and you're not both I am telling you
[56:04] you're not
[56:07] both your heart is one or the other it's
[56:11] either it cares a lot or it doesn't
[56:12] really
[56:14] care the random said in the message God
[56:17] projecting his love he said there are
[56:19] two different types of
[56:22] love two different types of love
[56:26] and I'm almost sure that many of us have
[56:29] been deceived with having fial love and
[56:32] thinking it was a go
[56:35] love fial love he said is
[56:41] intellectual agape love comes from the
[56:48] heart that's human love affectionate
[56:51] love and godly love Godly love doesn't
[56:53] question human love reasons but Godly
[56:55] love doesn't it's perfect in its trust
[56:59] it's perfect it just produces faith when
[57:02] you really love so the key is love God
[57:05] you'll trust
[57:06] him intellectual says no you got to
[57:09] prove it first no you're got to make me
[57:12] feel it I got to see it all these three
[57:14] things gotta line all this got to have
[57:16] and then I'll
[57:17] believe see because it's in the head it
[57:20] reasons amen now to face an audience
[57:24] like this of s several hundred
[57:27] people then someone would say do you
[57:30] mean that you would just read those one
[57:34] that one little verse of
[57:37] scripture brother BR says well there is
[57:39] enough in that verse of scripture and
[57:40] he's referring to John
[57:42] 316 to send you to heaven or to condemn
[57:45] you
[57:47] forever and if I had power I will in no
[57:50] wise change
[57:52] it if I would be offered all the money
[57:54] in the world or to be a king of the
[57:57] universe and a and a million years to
[57:59] reign in health I still wouldn't change
[58:02] one word of that
[58:04] text because it's God's word and it can
[58:07] never change no matter how small it is
[58:09] it's the same it's got the same value in
[58:12] it as the entire book has got and he
[58:15] says your action or your attitude
[58:19] towards this little piece of scripture
[58:22] will seal your Eternal Destiny and this
[58:25] is what I want to say today I want you
[58:26] to pay attention to this it's all about
[58:29] your
[58:30] attitude your attitude church one
[58:32] scripture can seal your destiny and we
[58:35] don't think about it because we're
[58:37] thinking about other
[58:39] things but if you want your life to
[58:42] change the key is in your
[58:45] attitude the key is in your attitude
[58:48] it's not in somebody's ability to make
[58:49] you feel good when you're at
[58:52] church it's in the ability of you
[58:55] believing the scripture and having an
[58:57] attitude that knows it's
[59:00] God and that if the whole world didn't
[59:03] believe it you would still stand there
[59:04] and believe it that is what will change
[59:07] your life
[59:09] am in the message here you him brother B
[59:12] says so now the Lord bless you as I read
[59:14] for just a little short text the Lord
[59:17] willing in chapter 17 of St Matthew's
[59:20] gospel and the last three
[59:23] words of the fifth verse he you
[59:27] him these little words but you say
[59:31] that's an awful small text brother
[59:34] brandom but it isn't the size of the
[59:37] text it's the context of it it it's what
[59:42] will determine your Eternal Destiny
[59:44] every man that hears it and his
[59:47] attitude towards it amen we know the
[59:51] word is
[59:52] perfect but what is the attitude towards
[59:55] it yes that's what's
[59:59] important we're going to get into some I
[1:00:01] think we're going to have some rich
[1:00:03] stuff this morning God helping us our
[1:00:06] attitude has everything to do with where
[1:00:08] we're at life where we're at with God
[1:00:12] has everything to do with our happiness
[1:00:14] the Bible says he gives more grace to
[1:00:16] the humble amen and he resists the
[1:00:20] proud and gives grace to the humble so
[1:00:23] if you want more from God have a good
[1:00:24] attitude to me a person that's proud
[1:00:27] does not have a good
[1:00:29] attitude a proud Spirit which you can
[1:00:31] see a mile away you've heard The Strife
[1:00:34] was so thick you can cut it with a knife
[1:00:37] when you see pride it is so thick it is
[1:00:40] not
[1:00:42] transparent you see
[1:00:44] it because it's manifested in so many
[1:00:47] ways and a a proud spirit is a wrong
[1:00:52] attitude you're not going to get much
[1:00:54] grace like that why because God re
[1:00:57] resists that thing because that's what
[1:00:59] Lucifer
[1:01:01] has so we're told to submit to
[1:01:05] God take the right mental attitude and
[1:01:09] God will help you draw nigh to God he'll
[1:01:11] draw nigh to you amen it's all about the
[1:01:14] attitude we choose we choose to draw
[1:01:16] nigh to God or we don't we choose that
[1:01:19] I'm going to take this word my life is
[1:01:21] going to change or we're going to choose
[1:01:23] to just well when when is service over I
[1:01:25] got some things going on today I'm
[1:01:27] looking forward to
[1:01:30] it God is humble his nature is humble
[1:01:33] learn of me I'm meek and lowly I dwell
[1:01:35] with them of a humble and contrary
[1:01:37] Spirit humility is a choice of attitude
[1:01:41] when you see somebody and you say oh
[1:01:43] that's a humble sister that's a humble
[1:01:45] brother I am telling you that's a choice
[1:01:48] that they
[1:01:49] make they have a right attitude they're
[1:01:52] they're choosing to resist all the
[1:01:54] negative evil that come into their head
[1:01:56] all their judgmental thoughts that come
[1:01:58] into their head they're choosing to say
[1:01:59] I'm not going to think on that and they
[1:02:01] choose to be
[1:02:04] humble too much we look at that we say
[1:02:07] oh that's just their personality sir but
[1:02:09] I tell you I wasn't born like
[1:02:16] this I wanted to knock somebody's head
[1:02:21] off I wanted to hurt people that's right
[1:02:26] I wanted to well I did drink and all
[1:02:28] that
[1:02:32] stuff humility is a choice it's not
[1:02:35] something you're born with or not born
[1:02:37] with in fact we're all born without
[1:02:41] it we're all B born with a proud selfish
[1:02:46] spirit and if you don't put that thing
[1:02:48] off it'll stay there and it'll stay
[1:02:51] there and it'll stay there in
[1:02:53] church it'll stay there in church it may
[1:02:56] not rash out but it'll stay there in
[1:03:01] church we're going to talk about how
[1:03:04] that's stopping us but Jesus just kind
[1:03:08] of want to show how the importance of an
[1:03:10] attitude here John 939 John 9:39 Jesus
[1:03:14] said for judgment I am coming into the
[1:03:16] world that they which
[1:03:19] see not might see and they which see
[1:03:24] might be made blind
[1:03:27] so God has come to deal with people's
[1:03:32] attitude and some of the Pharisees which
[1:03:35] were with him heard these words and they
[1:03:36] said oh are we blind also are you going
[1:03:39] to tell me that I'm
[1:03:41] blind and Jesus said unto them if you
[1:03:44] were blind you should have no
[1:03:48] sin but now you
[1:03:51] say we
[1:03:52] see Therefore your sin REM ath
[1:03:58] amen it's all attitude because you say
[1:04:02] no different than Le to
[1:04:04] seal because you say you're in need of
[1:04:09] nothing you're actually naked blind you
[1:04:13] need so much you need to come by and me
[1:04:15] gold Tred in the fire because of your
[1:04:17] attitude I'm going to tell you this age
[1:04:19] that we live in this the the spirits
[1:04:22] that we rub shoulders with every day
[1:04:24] it's the spirit that's of a of of of a
[1:04:27] um double-minded it's not hot it's not
[1:04:30] cold it's
[1:04:31] lukewarm it can't make a decision I'm
[1:04:33] going to stay here a little bit for God
[1:04:36] a little bit for my will a little bit
[1:04:39] for
[1:04:42] lukewarm God looks at that says I'd
[1:04:45] rather have you one or the other he
[1:04:47] doesn't say well I'd rather have you be
[1:04:49] hot with me he doesn't say
[1:04:51] that because he he respects Choice he
[1:04:55] madees man he made the Devil with a
[1:04:59] choice you know what he finally stuck
[1:05:02] with
[1:05:05] it I think the de God has more respect
[1:05:08] for the devil than a lot of so-called
[1:05:09] lukewarm
[1:05:13] Believers at least he can look at the
[1:05:15] Devil and say that's a
[1:05:16] devil you look at some half-hearted in
[1:05:19] and out and I'm a Christian but no I'm
[1:05:21] not no holding
[1:05:24] accountable no taking on no
[1:05:26] responsibility to become the statue of a
[1:05:28] perfect
[1:05:35] man the spirit that's in the people in
[1:05:38] this age is the spirit is is is speaking
[1:05:41] to me that it's lacking the new
[1:05:44] birth which is the Holy Ghost the deity
[1:05:46] of
[1:05:48] God people don't people don't even like
[1:05:50] talking about the New
[1:05:53] Birth that is the they're not serious
[1:05:56] about coming to the Altar and seeking it
[1:05:58] they they feel they already got it in
[1:06:01] need of
[1:06:02] nothing they don't even realize what
[1:06:04] spirit's on
[1:06:06] them Jesus said you must be born again
[1:06:11] right and the word is the only thing
[1:06:16] this is the only thing in in spirit form
[1:06:20] this in spirit form is the only thing
[1:06:23] that can change our nature amen
[1:06:27] it's not learning what it says not
[1:06:30] learning the message not qu it's not
[1:06:33] intellectually having it it's the spirit
[1:06:36] of the word coming inside of your
[1:06:40] heart where the nature really is coming
[1:06:43] from and changing it and that's the new
[1:06:49] birth Peter said in 1 Peter 1:23 being
[1:06:53] born again
[1:06:56] not of in not of corruptible seed but of
[1:07:01] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:07:04] liveth and abideth
[1:07:10] forever so when you're born again you're
[1:07:13] not born again
[1:07:16] of a little bit better seed than
[1:07:21] corruptible like I I I was able to stop
[1:07:24] smoking
[1:07:26] yeah but I'm still doing this that's not
[1:07:31] the seed you're born
[1:07:33] with so if you stop smoking praise God
[1:07:36] but you stare at what yet has to be done
[1:07:39] and you keep moving and believing for
[1:07:42] it not saying well you know we're we're
[1:07:44] all going to be you know you know none
[1:07:46] of us are
[1:07:48] perfect where's that can to lead us to I
[1:07:51] don't see that pressing towards any
[1:07:54] Mark and it's going to drag you the
[1:07:56] wrong way see it's your attitude that's
[1:08:00] important now brother Brandon said the
[1:08:02] natural birth types the spiritual
[1:08:07] birth we have the natural seeds and
[1:08:10] spiritual seeds Genesis tells us that
[1:08:13] every seed brings forth of its kind but
[1:08:16] it must meet the right conditions in
[1:08:18] order to bring forth life real important
[1:08:21] because we're talking really in this
[1:08:23] that I'm going to be going we're talking
[1:08:24] about us bringing forth the
[1:08:26] word and in order for the word of God to
[1:08:29] bring forth life today it must meet the
[1:08:32] right requirements see we know that this
[1:08:35] word is perfect the spirit of God is
[1:08:39] perfect the spirit of the word is
[1:08:41] perfect the preaching we can say of the
[1:08:44] word is
[1:08:45] perfect what has to get
[1:08:49] perfect it's the receiving of the word
[1:08:52] amen that's what has to get perfect amen
[1:08:56] has to be
[1:08:57] conditioned now a natural male human
[1:09:01] seed enters the female
[1:09:05] womb but if it stays there it will
[1:09:11] die that seed needs to continue moving
[1:09:17] forward and the Egg th of the female
[1:09:22] must come and meet them
[1:09:26] they must meet that male cell and that
[1:09:30] egg must open itself to receive the male
[1:09:35] word amen it has to if it don't life
[1:09:39] will not come forth from the seed
[1:09:42] entering into the womb are you with me
[1:09:45] can you say Amen we got to get past this
[1:09:47] natural part for a second just so we
[1:09:50] understand how this thing works it's no
[1:09:54] different with the spiritual
[1:09:55] word seed of God it must enter the womb
[1:10:01] of the
[1:10:03] church brother Braham talked about the
[1:10:06] mind being the womb of the Soul or the
[1:10:08] spirit it starts in the mind but
[1:10:12] understand if the word just stays in
[1:10:16] your head it will never bring forth life
[1:10:19] it must continue going towards the
[1:10:22] heart and inside your heart there is a
[1:10:25] desire and that that intentions and that
[1:10:28] motive it's going forth to meet that
[1:10:31] word that desire to have it manifested
[1:10:34] and if you open yourself up to that word
[1:10:37] that is when life will come manifested
[1:10:38] in you Hallelujah but if you sit there
[1:10:41] and church and you hear the word you say
[1:10:43] Amen to the word but in your heart you
[1:10:45] never receive it it'll never bring forth
[1:10:49] life it'll just be like having sex
[1:10:59] we're here because we want to be
[1:11:01] manifested sons of God we don't want to
[1:11:04] just have some put on some form of
[1:11:06] godliness oh this is what the church
[1:11:08] plays I guess I got to act like
[1:11:10] this no this is what God's calling us to
[1:11:13] he's calling us to put off these
[1:11:16] things he's calling us to put on these
[1:11:18] things I can't do that within myself if
[1:11:21] I could I wouldn't need the gospel
[1:11:25] so I need him to do it and he ain't
[1:11:29] going to do it here it is unless that
[1:11:32] desire inside of you is not going to
[1:11:34] come up and reach that word that's in
[1:11:36] your
[1:11:40] mind that word has to drop down to your
[1:11:44] heart and your desire has got to reach
[1:11:46] that it's got to open up and say come on
[1:11:48] in Lord I want this for my
[1:11:52] life and there there's a bond that's
[1:11:54] made right there in those two cells they
[1:11:56] just fuse together what happens life
[1:11:59] comes forth that's what it means to be
[1:12:01] born again not joining a church not
[1:12:05] saying I've been serving the lord so
[1:12:06] long not saying I'm in the
[1:12:10] message but we got to be seeing things
[1:12:12] that accompany our Salvation accompany
[1:12:14] the new
[1:12:15] birth there needs to be change happening
[1:12:18] year after year you can't be looking at
[1:12:20] your life and saying I see the same old
[1:12:22] thing that I saw a year ago that's true
[1:12:27] now can you
[1:12:29] imagine a woman being
[1:12:33] pregnant we understand that it takes
[1:12:36] about nine
[1:12:40] months can you imagine after four months
[1:12:44] five
[1:12:45] months that she just
[1:12:49] stops takes a
[1:12:51] break for a year later nothing goes on
[1:12:55] on no
[1:12:59] growing no once the seed
[1:13:02] starts it keeps
[1:13:07] going we don't hear of a mother stopping
[1:13:11] that stopping with her baby inside it's
[1:13:14] not growing for a
[1:13:16] year come
[1:13:18] on it don't work like
[1:13:21] that the natural birth types A Spiritual
[1:13:24] birth
[1:13:27] amen we need to understand that the
[1:13:29] devil's doing everything he can to stop
[1:13:32] that seed from reaching what it needs
[1:13:35] to he's got distractions he wants the
[1:13:38] word to fall on four different types of
[1:13:39] ground we understand what the devil's
[1:13:42] devices are but what we need to do is be
[1:13:44] humble and have the right attitude and
[1:13:47] say am is this accompanying my life or
[1:13:50] am I just trying to be a better a better
[1:13:53] Christian than everybody who's not
[1:13:57] I don't want to be better than somebody
[1:14:00] I want to be the word he's coming for a
[1:14:02] word bride
[1:14:05] amen it must connect with the egg inside
[1:14:10] of the Bride did it
[1:14:15] will the word of God travels beyond our
[1:14:18] mind reaches towards our
[1:14:23] heart and that word of God God must
[1:14:26] reach the greatest desire of our heart
[1:14:28] now here's what I'm going to say with
[1:14:29] this you know you ever been talking to
[1:14:32] somebody they're talking to you they're
[1:14:34] talking about one thing but their motive
[1:14:36] is something different you know what I'm
[1:14:38] talking about
[1:14:42] deceitful it's like what do you got up
[1:14:45] your
[1:14:46] sleeve you know what I'm talking
[1:14:48] about we can have many desires we can
[1:14:52] have a desire for God we can have have
[1:14:55] lovers of pleasure or the lovers of God
[1:14:58] we can have love for so many different
[1:15:00] things we have a desire to do so many
[1:15:02] things but you know God will not receive
[1:15:07] you until you want him more than
[1:15:09] anything amen theuth you shall seek me
[1:15:12] and find me when you search for me with
[1:15:13] all your heart and until that desire
[1:15:16] gets there the new birth will not
[1:15:19] happen yeah you can repent and you can
[1:15:21] get baptized that's right you can start
[1:15:23] you go to church and things can start to
[1:15:26] happen but if you do not continue on if
[1:15:30] you do not go on to Pro if you do not
[1:15:32] keep doing what the preaching is telling
[1:15:34] you to do you don't dig into the word
[1:15:36] you don't say God make me what I ought
[1:15:38] to be and you don't press in with all
[1:15:40] your heart I am telling you you will
[1:15:41] come short of the new birth be those
[1:15:44] that start to build their house they
[1:15:46] didn't have they didn't pay the price
[1:15:49] enough to finish it right they didn't
[1:15:51] consider the cost well what's the cost
[1:15:53] the cost is all your heart that cost is
[1:15:55] all your life amen God is not going to
[1:15:58] accept you into the kingdom and you only
[1:16:00] give 50% of your life to
[1:16:03] him why thought all had to do is repent
[1:16:05] get baptized and I'm
[1:16:08] saved search the scriptures for in them
[1:16:12] you think you have eternal life they are
[1:16:14] they that testify of me we need the
[1:16:16] whole book Amen to understand what it
[1:16:18] really means to
[1:16:21] believe really to do anything to repent
[1:16:25] amen Jesus said I stand at the door of
[1:16:30] our
[1:16:32] heart so the the word the word comes in
[1:16:36] is standing there at the door what has
[1:16:38] to happen we have to open the door amen
[1:16:42] that's our
[1:16:45] desire now we all know this we want to
[1:16:49] open the door that says God this is
[1:16:53] where all the blessings come right
[1:16:57] here but then there's another door to
[1:17:00] the rest of the
[1:17:03] house that door we don't want God to go
[1:17:07] in but God is knocking at the door to
[1:17:10] your house
[1:17:13] amen and when you say God I really want
[1:17:15] my life to change right I don't want to
[1:17:19] go down the path of the world because if
[1:17:21] you love the world or the things of the
[1:17:23] world the love of God ain't even in you
[1:17:25] amen you can't do both that desire has
[1:17:28] to be all for God yes and I know this is
[1:17:32] strong preaching but we need
[1:17:33] it we need it oh my my I got a quote I
[1:17:37] haven't even read the whole thing but I
[1:17:39] grabbed it right at the end brother
[1:17:41] brandham said in the spoken word is the
[1:17:42] Original Seed he says and the only way
[1:17:46] that we can ever be born again is first
[1:17:49] in the womb of the Mind receive the
[1:17:53] word then the Spirit comes on top of
[1:17:57] that and brings it to
[1:18:00] life there you are that's what it does
[1:18:03] the real gospel teaching brother I
[1:18:05] believe it if St Paul was standing here
[1:18:07] today he'd be teaching the same thing
[1:18:10] that I do in this
[1:18:12] hour well we know that to be the
[1:18:17] truth God's spirit the life of God has
[1:18:23] to come and
[1:18:25] Unite with
[1:18:28] that desire that's inside of us now we
[1:18:32] know that we could sit all day and
[1:18:36] learn boy about anything we could learn
[1:18:38] about cars we learn about um money we
[1:18:42] can learn about taxes we can learn about
[1:18:45] the Bible and the next day don't even be
[1:18:48] thinking about it so we have the ability
[1:18:51] to get the word in our
[1:18:52] mind but if that does not come down into
[1:18:55] the
[1:18:57] heart and meet with life brother Braham
[1:19:01] talks
[1:19:02] about um the chickens that lay the
[1:19:07] eggs but they never hatch out and he
[1:19:10] said the reason they don't is because
[1:19:12] that hen was never with the
[1:19:15] rooster can you say
[1:19:17] amen and so therefore it doesn't have
[1:19:20] the life to bring
[1:19:21] forth we've got to we've got to get
[1:19:24] serious with God we got to meet God and
[1:19:27] we got to stay in our fellowship and
[1:19:28] stay connected to the vine Le you abide
[1:19:31] in me and I abide in you he said you can
[1:19:34] do nothing without me nothing we can't
[1:19:38] even be a Christian we can't even stop
[1:19:40] ourselves from getting angry and yelling
[1:19:41] at somebody we can't even stop oursel
[1:19:44] from having an attitude true we can't
[1:19:46] even stop oursel from we we don't even
[1:19:49] want to forgive somebody
[1:19:57] our attitude plays such an important
[1:19:58] role in manifesting the word of God we
[1:20:01] don't ever think you don't have to have
[1:20:03] a good attitude and you manifest the
[1:20:04] word of God it is so you're you're so
[1:20:07] deceived I'll say that you're so
[1:20:09] deceived if you think
[1:20:11] that the Bible says if we hear the word
[1:20:14] and don't do it we deceive
[1:20:17] ourselves we need the right attitude for
[1:20:22] growing in Christ for maturing for
[1:20:26] overcoming even for
[1:20:30] adoption if our attitude is well I
[1:20:33] really don't care what God is saying
[1:20:34] right
[1:20:36] now then our desire will never connect
[1:20:39] with God
[1:20:41] Amen and the word of God will never
[1:20:43] bring forth life to us well I don't need
[1:20:45] this I don't need this church I don't
[1:20:47] need I don't need this message I can
[1:20:49] just you know I can stay home and go
[1:20:51] online and watch whatever I want to
[1:20:53] watch and you tell me God is going to
[1:20:56] take that attitude into a
[1:20:58] Rapture you think God's going to say
[1:21:00] yeah I want to get married to that I
[1:21:02] want to spend eternity with that kind of
[1:21:04] attitude you know God is the type of God
[1:21:07] that wants to see you are you willing to
[1:21:11] suffer he is right if you don't suffer
[1:21:15] you don't
[1:21:16] reain Christ laid down his life for us
[1:21:19] we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:21:21] others he is our example Christ is he is
[1:21:25] our example of suffering that we should
[1:21:27] follow in his steps Peter
[1:21:29] said just a a couple examples many of us
[1:21:33] know of the story of non in Second Kings
[1:21:37] non was a a captain of a Syrian Army he
[1:21:41] was a the Bible says he was a Mighty Man
[1:21:43] Of
[1:21:44] valure Because by him the Lord had given
[1:21:47] Deliverance unto Syria he was a great
[1:21:50] and honorable man so but he had leprosy
[1:21:53] so we know that there is so much good
[1:21:55] about this man he just had leprosy he
[1:21:57] had a problem non and his wife had a
[1:22:00] maid who who had taken captive from the
[1:22:03] land of Israel and she knew about the
[1:22:05] prophet
[1:22:06] Elisha and she told her mistress I would
[1:22:09] God that my Lord were with the prophet
[1:22:13] that was in Samaria for he would recover
[1:22:15] him or non of his leprosy right so the
[1:22:19] word got to non and non came with his
[1:22:23] horses and his chariots and he stood
[1:22:26] outside the door of the House of Elisha
[1:22:28] this is 2 Kings 5:9 and verse 10 and
[1:22:31] Elisha sent Messengers unto him he
[1:22:33] wouldn't even come to the
[1:22:35] door came all traveled all that way and
[1:22:38] he stayed
[1:22:40] in another
[1:22:44] room you would think that's kind of
[1:22:47] disrespectful and Elisha sent a
[1:22:50] messenger unto him saying go and wash in
[1:22:52] Jordan seven times and thy flesh shall
[1:22:55] come again to thee and thou shalt be
[1:22:58] clean and non was wroth verse
[1:23:03] 11 now he just
[1:23:06] received the
[1:23:08] word he just received the word what to
[1:23:11] do to get his healing but instead he got
[1:23:17] angry and he went away offended at the
[1:23:20] word of the prophet and said behold I
[1:23:22] thought he would surely come out to me
[1:23:25] and stand and call the name of the Lord
[1:23:27] is God and strike his hand over the
[1:23:29] place and recover the
[1:23:33] leper you know we all got preconceived
[1:23:35] ideas too don't
[1:23:37] we I think the church should do this and
[1:23:39] the preacher should do that the pastor
[1:23:41] should do he shouldn't do this and he
[1:23:42] shouldn't and the prophet you know I
[1:23:45] just that word Roth it means crack off
[1:23:49] to burst out in Rage and to be angry non
[1:23:53] had
[1:23:54] the message of the hour all figured
[1:23:58] out why have so many people left the
[1:24:01] message they left you know a lot of them
[1:24:04] left in
[1:24:05] Wrath right they you can't hardly find
[1:24:09] any that walked away just humble they
[1:24:11] won't say anything they they just walk
[1:24:12] away wouldn't say no they got to be
[1:24:14] outraged against
[1:24:17] it Same
[1:24:20] Spirit nonon had a wrong mental attitude
[1:24:27] and I'm telling you if he would have
[1:24:29] kept it life would have not came forth
[1:24:31] and he would have been a leper died a
[1:24:33] leper and that's a truth because he
[1:24:36] received the word of the Lord it was in
[1:24:38] his mind but it never dropped down to
[1:24:41] his heart it was in his mind and he
[1:24:44] began to reason with it intellectual
[1:24:46] love you know what I'm talking about
[1:24:48] that's and he goes on to say are not
[1:24:52] Abner and far par rivers of Damascus
[1:24:56] better than all the rivers of Israel may
[1:24:59] I not wash in them and be
[1:25:03] clean he had a different
[1:25:05] Revelation so he turned and went away in
[1:25:09] a rage that means hot displeasure it it
[1:25:12] is so strong if you look it up the word
[1:25:14] means
[1:25:16] poisoned that's how bad it
[1:25:18] was and his servants came near and spake
[1:25:21] unto him said my father my father if the
[1:25:24] prophet had bid thee to do some great
[1:25:27] thing would has thou not done
[1:25:30] it how much
[1:25:32] rather than when he saith to thee wash
[1:25:35] and be
[1:25:37] clean his servants taught nonon how to
[1:25:41] have a good
[1:25:44] attitude how important it is when we're
[1:25:47] trying to help one another have a good
[1:25:50] attitude believe the word that's come
[1:25:53] forth at the church or the tape that
[1:25:56] you're listening to or the Bible that
[1:25:58] you're
[1:25:59] reading let it drop down into your
[1:26:02] heart because that's exactly what was
[1:26:05] happening his servants was trying to get
[1:26:08] that word that he knew up here to drop
[1:26:10] down here
[1:26:15] yes I'm telling you they knew his
[1:26:18] attitude was going to make or break
[1:26:22] it those servants had a reel ation that
[1:26:25] if they did not change non's attitude
[1:26:30] that he was going to continue to be a
[1:26:32] leper so they actually had a
[1:26:35] burden they convinced him then went he
[1:26:39] down and dipped himself seven times in
[1:26:41] Jordan according to the saying of the
[1:26:43] man of
[1:26:44] God and his flesh came again like unto
[1:26:47] the Flesh of a little child and he was
[1:26:51] clean does not the Bible say believe in
[1:26:54] the the Lord so shall you be established
[1:26:56] Believe In His prophets so shall you
[1:26:59] prosper it's a
[1:27:01] promise take it seriously I am telling
[1:27:04] you there's not another book in the
[1:27:05] world that you can read and have
[1:27:07] confidence like the word of
[1:27:10] God now understand we you know we we
[1:27:12] prayed and we tried and we we we we did
[1:27:15] all these things and we thought you know
[1:27:17] you know somehow that God failed us but
[1:27:18] we don't want to say it but yet we
[1:27:20] believe it right it's a difference
[1:27:22] between trust and not trust
[1:27:27] brandom said in the message the ins sign
[1:27:29] he says how do you do
[1:27:32] lady I believe that she's up at the the
[1:27:34] podium going across being prayed for how
[1:27:37] do you do lady do you believe me to be
[1:27:40] his servant Do You Believe Me Do you
[1:27:43] believe that he is here now do you
[1:27:45] believe that the spirit's here to make
[1:27:47] you well he says you're a stranger here
[1:27:50] in this city too he says you're from
[1:27:53] Toledo sorry I couldn't find one that
[1:27:55] was of Michigan with
[1:27:58] this is that
[1:28:01] right and aren't you a
[1:28:03] minister it's a lady and he says aren't
[1:28:06] you a minister he says your husband's a
[1:28:08] minister too now notice the spirit is
[1:28:11] not correcting this right now this is
[1:28:14] the Holy Ghost In Charge is not
[1:28:16] correcting that
[1:28:19] situation he says that's right sitting
[1:28:21] right
[1:28:23] here uh-huh never seen you in my life
[1:28:27] but you got heart trouble haven't you he
[1:28:29] says you're healed God bless you go on
[1:28:31] your way see your mental attitudes quite
[1:28:37] a difference between you and the lady
[1:28:40] that just passed here and he must have
[1:28:41] been looking at somebody else when he
[1:28:44] said
[1:28:45] that he calls he didn't say nothing here
[1:28:48] about faith right he did say you you
[1:28:51] know do you believe but he said it was
[1:28:53] your attitude
[1:28:55] that made a quite a big
[1:28:57] difference one is humble and one is not
[1:29:00] humble enough to believe God's
[1:29:02] word now someone who just got upset at
[1:29:05] the truth and didn't change his attitude
[1:29:07] was Cain yeah right that's right the the
[1:29:11] the the same word is
[1:29:12] used but unto Cain this is Genesis 4:5
[1:29:16] but unto Cain into his offering he had
[1:29:18] no respect and Cain was what
[1:29:21] WTH got upset and his countenance fell
[1:29:24] and the Lord said unto Cain why are they
[1:29:26] rough why are you upset why are you
[1:29:27] jealous why are you
[1:29:29] angry why is th countenance Fallen if
[1:29:33] thou doest well Thou shalt be accepted
[1:29:35] and if thou doest not well sin lith at
[1:29:37] the door and thou and th and they sh I'm
[1:29:39] sorry and unto thee shall be his desire
[1:29:42] and thou shalt rule over him so he had
[1:29:45] an
[1:29:46] opportunity is he had an
[1:29:51] opportunity he had a choice to
[1:29:54] choose to do what the word
[1:29:57] said had a
[1:29:59] choice to change his
[1:30:02] attitude to put off a bad attitude to
[1:30:06] put on a new attitude he had that choice
[1:30:10] God gave Cain that
[1:30:12] choice you know what but Cain went home
[1:30:14] and he continued to get upset continued
[1:30:17] to get angry continued to fill his mind
[1:30:20] with how much he was displeased with his
[1:30:23] brother amen that
[1:30:25] is and eventually it came
[1:30:28] out because you got something against
[1:30:31] somebody I'm telling you if you don't
[1:30:33] sincerely forgive him from your heart
[1:30:36] it'll stay there and rot you
[1:30:49] poisoned Cain acted like there was no
[1:30:52] consequences to his choices
[1:30:58] Luke Chapter 13 verse1 please bear with
[1:31:01] me we just may go a few minutes extra if
[1:31:03] that's okay with
[1:31:05] you amen and for those that it's not
[1:31:07] okay you can
[1:31:10] quietly we're going to continue on Luke
[1:31:13] 13:1 there was president at the season
[1:31:17] I'm going to just we're going to talk
[1:31:18] about the importance of repenting
[1:31:21] correctly
[1:31:24] when you repent you're exercising the
[1:31:26] power of your attitude there were
[1:31:27] present at that season some that told
[1:31:29] Jesus of the galileans whose blood
[1:31:32] pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
[1:31:34] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:31:36] suppose ye that these uh galileans were
[1:31:40] Sinners above all the
[1:31:44] galileans because they suffered such
[1:31:46] things you ever look at somebody and
[1:31:48] said oh wow
[1:31:54] and this is what Jesus said about that
[1:31:56] and I tell you nay but except you repent
[1:31:58] you shall likewise
[1:32:00] perish or of those 18 upon whom the
[1:32:04] tower and Shalom fall and slew them
[1:32:06] think ye that they were Sinners above
[1:32:08] all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem and
[1:32:10] I tell you nay but except you repent you
[1:32:12] shall all likewise perish so we see here
[1:32:14] that repentance is the right attitude
[1:32:17] always repentance is the right attitude
[1:32:21] amen and if we back exite 100 times a
[1:32:24] day we we ought to be repentant 100
[1:32:25] times a
[1:32:26] day you know not me brother John the way
[1:32:29] that I do it I I'm such you know what I
[1:32:31] do is I just kind of just wait to the
[1:32:32] end of the day you know just do it all
[1:32:35] one time you know because I'm real
[1:32:38] busy what if you don't make it to the
[1:32:40] end of the day what if you don't make it
[1:32:42] to the end of the
[1:32:44] day blessed are the merciful for they
[1:32:47] shall obtain
[1:32:50] Mercy if we don't forgive men their
[1:32:52] trespasses God will not forgive us our
[1:32:54] so our attitude towards other people
[1:32:56] determines our destiny think about that
[1:32:58] that's true my attitude towards others
[1:33:01] determines where I'm going right wow I
[1:33:05] thought I could have any old kind of
[1:33:06] thoughts about anybody and I'm still
[1:33:08] okay NOP that's a lie of the devil
[1:33:11] amen Mercy is another thing that
[1:33:13] accompanies salvation
[1:33:16] amen that's going to be my last quote
[1:33:19] brother BR said painted face Jezebel in
[1:33:21] the message painted face Jezebel he says
[1:33:23] now if we see what God did back there to
[1:33:28] those people upon certain attitudes that
[1:33:31] they had
[1:33:32] taken towards God and then if we find
[1:33:36] out if we'll take that same attitude
[1:33:39] that they
[1:33:40] did we will receive the same reward they
[1:33:44] did it's right brother you can just
[1:33:47] expect CU God never changes he's just
[1:33:51] the same he's his Blessing is the same
[1:33:55] and his penalties are the same Jesus
[1:33:57] Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:33:59] forever so I just want to say this why
[1:34:01] don't we just seek to have the same
[1:34:06] attitude learn learn how namon got his
[1:34:10] life turned around had a miraculous
[1:34:13] healing just because his attitude maybe
[1:34:16] God is asking us to do something are you
[1:34:20] with me amen amen the power of our
[1:34:23] attitude ude is a choice that that will
[1:34:25] make a difference in our life amen so we
[1:34:29] have a choice to separate from certain
[1:34:32] things be not unequally yolked together
[1:34:35] right put off the things of the world
[1:34:37] put off malice and anger and hatred you
[1:34:39] know about those things that we think
[1:34:41] you know are not that big a thing
[1:34:42] they're kind of private they're just
[1:34:43] between me and my husband me and my wife
[1:34:46] me and my children me and my boss who I
[1:34:48] hate and sometimes you know me and my
[1:34:50] neighbor that you know no put it off be
[1:34:54] Christ to that
[1:34:57] evil I'm going just say like
[1:35:01] this Christ is calling
[1:35:05] us to
[1:35:07] overcome and you know what really does
[1:35:09] it it's
[1:35:12] love
[1:35:14] love is what overcomes it it's not
[1:35:17] proving to the other person how wrong
[1:35:19] they are and what they're doing it's
[1:35:21] helping them like the Servants of nonon
[1:35:24] helped
[1:35:26] non to choose the right way that that's
[1:35:29] why the Bible says if a brother be
[1:35:30] overtaken to fall ye which are spiritual
[1:35:32] go to him in a spirit of meekness and
[1:35:33] fear considering yourself lest you also
[1:35:35] be tempted it takes someone with the
[1:35:38] love of God to help somebody most people
[1:35:40] when they see there's a problem you know
[1:35:42] what they
[1:35:45] do they walk
[1:35:49] away and I'll tell you I'm going to say
[1:35:52] this if Christ lives in you how is
[1:35:57] Christ allowing you to walk away when he
[1:36:01] walk towards you am this does it make
[1:36:06] sense so I say that God is calling
[1:36:10] us to be more like him
[1:36:14] amen let your salvation be ACC company
[1:36:17] with the right mental
[1:36:21] attitude but beloved we are persuaded
[1:36:23] did better things of
[1:36:25] you things like
[1:36:29] respect do you think respect accompan
[1:36:35] salvation
[1:36:39] amen how many testimonies have we heard
[1:36:41] over the years people said you know I
[1:36:44] used to do this and I used to do that
[1:36:46] and I didn't care about
[1:36:47] this I mean I was I was tearing down
[1:36:50] buildings before I was converted
[1:36:54] then after I got converted I I don't
[1:36:56] know how many churches we
[1:36:59] built because you
[1:37:02] respect when you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:37:08] respect I know because at one time I
[1:37:10] didn't
[1:37:11] respect I didn't care what my dad
[1:37:14] said I didn't care what people thought I
[1:37:17] didn't even care if they were right and
[1:37:19] I was wrong that's how bad it was
[1:37:24] but respect accompanies Salvation And if
[1:37:26] you're not respecting you need to look
[1:37:28] and get
[1:37:31] saved you need to esteem others better
[1:37:33] than
[1:37:37] yourself amen let's Stand
[1:37:41] Together
[1:37:43] respect accompanies salvation
[1:38:07] I know this is a challenging message
[1:38:13] today but I'll say to encourage
[1:38:17] you you're where you're at with
[1:38:21] God because of choices that you made so
[1:38:25] when you were out in the world you'd
[1:38:26] still be there if you didn't make the
[1:38:29] choice that you made to get where you're
[1:38:32] at I want you to be encouraged with that
[1:38:35] but I do want you to know that God is
[1:38:38] calling all of us unto Perfection now
[1:38:41] there's only one group of people that's
[1:38:42] going to go there that's the
[1:38:45] bride the rest are going to stay and
[1:38:47] they're going to just wallow in the
[1:38:49] wilderness murmur and complain and I
[1:38:53] just say like like this from my heart I
[1:38:55] love
[1:38:56] you and I want to provoke you to good
[1:39:02] works I want us to look at our lives in
[1:39:05] a personal
[1:39:07] way and make sure
[1:39:09] that the things that accompany the holy
[1:39:12] spirit is accompanying Our
[1:39:15] Lives we don't want to be in that side
[1:39:18] that the whole church world is that they
[1:39:20] say they got God
[1:39:23] but that's not accompanying their
[1:39:27] life we want to be Christ to others
[1:39:29] that's how we
[1:39:30] know when when when we're being Christ
[1:39:34] to others that's how we know that the
[1:39:38] right things are accompaning Sal
[1:39:40] accompanying salvation for our
[1:39:43] lives we're not going to preach uh uh uh
[1:39:48] a a death s uh bed a bed confession or
[1:39:52] on the cross at the last minute that's
[1:39:55] not what this ministry is for this
[1:39:57] ministry is to help a bride get ready to
[1:39:59] get serious with the word and to allow
[1:40:01] it to come into the heart and change a
[1:40:03] man from from Death onto life and you
[1:40:06] know what's exciting I think for a
[1:40:08] Christian he never stops changing amen
