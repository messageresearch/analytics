[33:59] only
[34:00] uh he's a great preacher a great

[34:14] and
[34:16] to
[34:17] not swear
[34:22] he he taught me
[34:24] those things
[34:29] but what he
[34:31] taught me
[34:32] it was things that only his life
[34:36] could interpret
[34:39] so when he said
[34:41] we need to love one another
[34:45] it was his life that interpreted that to
[34:48] me

[35:30] somehow we're all connected
[35:32] because we're all the family of god
[35:35] and i'm sure of this when we get there
[35:38] there's going to be
[35:40] a bright light

[35:44] it's going to be bright it's going to be
[35:46] many souls attached to him

[40:40] blessing
[40:41] upon you
[40:42] when you suffer for his namesake
[40:46] amen
[40:48] he's been so
[40:49] so very good to me so one of these days
[40:54] it's going to all be over
[40:56] hey man

[41:04] if he wants to let me live to be a
[41:07] hundred it's okay
[41:09] amen
[41:11] if he wants to take me before then it'll
[41:14] be okay too
[41:16] because
[41:17] we've got a place waiting
[41:20] he said i go and prepare a place for you
[41:24] if i go and prepare a place for you i
[41:27] will
[41:28] come again
[41:29] and receive you unto myself
[41:32] and where i am
[41:34] there you may be
[41:36] in the midst
[41:38] amen
[41:39] i
[41:40] i just
[41:42] i just want to
[41:44] take a scripture over in the book of
[41:46] psalms
[41:47] if you
[41:49] would like to
[41:51] turn with me it'll be fine
[41:53] but it's going to be psalms 41
[41:56] and verse 1.
[42:00] this scripture just
[42:02] was given to me last week
[42:05] and i thought
[42:06] that'll be something i'll share
[42:09] with the folks here tonight
[42:11] he said blessed is he
[42:14] that considereth the poor
[42:17] the lord will deliver him
[42:20] in time of trouble
[42:24] and he's been faithful to that promise
[42:26] to me
[42:28] amen
[42:30] he's certainly been faithful
[42:32] and
[42:33] you know
[42:35] anytime we serve
[42:38] the people of god
[42:40] it's on the record
[42:42] as though we serve god
[42:45] himself
[42:46] amen
[42:48] no reward
[42:50] no reward will be lacking
[42:52] on that day
[42:54] when we meet him
[42:56] i just wish i could still
[43:00] give what i feel in my heart
[43:03] you know
[43:04] sometimes you think
[43:06] you just better sit down
[43:09] but then it's like fire shut up in your
[43:12] bones
[43:13] and you can't hold it
[43:15] you know
[43:16] i'm not ashamed
[43:18] of what he done for me and i want to
[43:20] thank him for his great
[43:23] salvation
[43:26] i gave my
[43:27] heart to the lord at a very young age
[43:31] and i've never regretted
[43:33] the time
[43:35] uh
[43:36] i just
[43:37] i just am so happy that
[43:41] when i called on him he heard me
[43:44] remember he made a promise
[43:47] that whoever would call upon him
[43:50] should be saved
[43:52] and he keeps his promises
[43:56] all of his promises
[43:58] he keeps them
[44:00] amen i want to read some other
[44:03] scriptures now
[44:05] in the ninth chapter of the book of
[44:07] matthew
[44:08] if you'd like to
[44:10] turn with me
[44:11] we'd like to read something
[44:14] from there tonight for the glory
[44:17] of the lord
[44:19] i'm going
[44:21] i'm going to
[44:21] start with
[44:23] verse 38 35
[44:26] verse
[44:27] 35
[44:29] and 9th chapter
[44:32] verse
[44:33] 35
[44:35] amen
[44:36] he said and jesus
[44:39] went about all
[44:41] the cities and villages
[44:43] teaching
[44:45] in their synagogues
[44:47] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[44:52] and healing
[44:54] every sickness
[44:56] and every disease
[44:58] among the people
[45:00] what a faithful lord
[45:03] we have
[45:05] amen
[45:06] one man said lord if you will
[45:09] you can
[45:11] cleanse me of this leprosy
[45:14] and the answer came
[45:15] i
[45:16] will amen
[45:19] he didn't make it complicated
[45:22] i will
[45:23] and he cleansed the man
[45:26] of his leprosy
[45:28] he said when he saw the multitudes
[45:31] he was moved
[45:33] with compassion
[45:35] on them
[45:36] because they fainted
[45:39] and they were scattered abroad
[45:42] as sheep having
[45:44] no shepherd
[45:47] then saith him to his disciples
[45:51] the harvest truly
[45:53] is plenteous
[45:56] but the laborers
[45:58] are few
[46:00] pray therefore
[46:02] the lord of the harvest
[46:04] that he will send forth labors
[46:08] into
[46:09] his harvest
[46:11] and i think that should be a prayer and
[46:14] we pray a lot more than we do
[46:17] amen
[46:19] send forth labor us
[46:22] into the harvest
[46:24] amen
[46:26] it's ready
[46:28] and
[46:29] you know
[46:30] he can't come until we find the last
[46:33] predestinated seed isn't that right
[46:37] he cannot come he will not come
[46:40] until the last one
[46:42] has come in
[46:44] and so
[46:46] the hardest truly
[46:48] is plenteous
[46:50] um
[46:51] i was pastoring
[46:53] in
[46:54] california
[46:56] when
[46:57] i had a burden
[46:59] to help the brothers
[47:01] in honduras
[47:03] the missionary that we had had to send
[47:07] down there
[47:08] he had come back to visit
[47:11] the brothers in the states and visit
[47:13] some churches
[47:15] and he was killed
[47:17] in a car accident
[47:20] and it was such a loss to all of us we
[47:24] we loved this brother ernest mccarthy
[47:27] was his name
[47:30] and
[47:31] so
[47:32] anyway in my burden
[47:35] to do something for the people
[47:38] we we became
[47:40] aware of a little machine called
[47:43] portable preacher
[47:45] it was a
[47:47] it was made by some businessmen
[47:50] out in california
[47:52] and it had the ability of playing
[47:55] 78 rpm records
[47:58] of playing
[48:00] a large uh
[48:02] tapes two hour tapes you know the big
[48:05] reels
[48:06] with two hour tapes
[48:09] and uh
[48:10] so
[48:12] it was
[48:13] operated by flashlight
[48:16] batteries so
[48:18] because there
[48:19] where i was going to send it
[48:22] they had no electricity
[48:24] so i needed to send something that they
[48:27] could use
[48:28] immediately
[48:29] without waiting for
[48:32] maybe not knowing how long before the
[48:35] electric came thank the lord they have
[48:37] it
[48:38] now
[48:39] but anyway
[48:41] i boxed it up took it to the post office
[48:46] i wanted to insure it for 200
[48:48] because
[48:49] that
[48:50] is what it had cost
[48:52] uh the church
[48:54] that was buying it
[48:57] and uh
[48:58] so they said we don't ensure
[49:01] thanks going to honduras
[49:04] central america
[49:06] and
[49:08] i said why they said well
[49:11] maybe the postman along the way decides
[49:15] he wants it
[49:16] and it never arrives
[49:18] at where
[49:20] it is supposed to go
[49:23] and i said i'm not going to send it
[49:26] but i had made a promise
[49:29] that was why
[49:31] the offering was taken was for this
[49:35] so
[49:36] i think it's always necessary that we
[49:38] keep our promise
[49:41] and the one way i could keep the promise
[49:44] was take it
[49:45] myself
[49:47] and that was how the lord got me the
[49:50] first time
[49:51] on the mission field
[49:54] and the blessings were so great
[49:57] the interests were so tremendous
[50:00] the results
[50:01] of that was
[50:04] you know we
[50:06] had brothers that were called to preach
[50:08] and went out to preach the message and
[50:12] uh
[50:13] according to brother lisandro
[50:16] one of the first missionaries
[50:18] we sent out there
[50:21] there were a hundred groups
[50:24] receiving the message
[50:27] amen
[50:28] and i believe most of them are still
[50:31] going
[50:32] by the grace of god
[50:34] amen they're still going on
[50:37] because one of the tests
[50:39] of the work of the lord is
[50:42] that the labor will remain
[50:45] that the work will go on
[50:48] amen
[50:50] we don't want to start in this give up
[50:54] but
[50:55] it's something only the lord can do
[50:59] we can preach the truth
[51:01] but only god can save the loss
[51:05] amen
[51:06] and that's the reason
[51:08] for the gospel for
[51:10] if this gospel is hid
[51:13] the bible said
[51:15] it's hid from them
[51:17] that are lost
[51:19] amen
[51:20] so
[51:21] that's so very true
[51:24] i want to go now to the 10th chapter
[51:27] of the book of
[51:29] matthew
[51:30] if you would
[51:32] uh
[51:34] i would like to read something there for
[51:37] the glory
[51:39] of the lord we're going to try
[51:41] to give some of the testimony
[51:43] the 10th chapter
[51:46] all right
[51:47] i want to
[51:48] read verse 40
[51:50] verse
[51:51] 41
[51:54] listen to what the scripture says
[51:58] he that receive if you
[52:00] receiveth me
[52:03] he that receiveth me
[52:05] receiveth him that sent me
[52:09] he that receiveth the prophet
[52:13] in the name of a prophet
[52:16] shall receive a prophet's
[52:19] reward
[52:21] and he that receiveth the righteous man
[52:25] in the name of a righteous man
[52:28] shall receive
[52:29] a righteous
[52:31] man's reward
[52:33] someone asked brother branham one time
[52:36] what was
[52:38] the prophet's reward
[52:40] he said to be a friend
[52:43] of the prophet
[52:44] amen
[52:46] i counted a great joy
[52:48] amen
[52:50] i'm so grateful that my
[52:52] my dad went to hear him
[52:55] uh in
[52:56] 1946
[52:58] again in
[52:59] 1948
[53:01] and both times when he came back
[53:04] he had a testimony that stirred my heart
[53:08] that thrilled my spirit and soul
[53:12] and
[53:13] i thought it sounds like
[53:16] that
[53:17] bible days are here again
[53:20] amen
[53:22] and once
[53:23] you met that prophet
[53:25] i'll tell you
[53:26] there was no one that could thrill the
[53:29] soul of a real believer
[53:32] like him
[53:33] amen
[53:35] he gave you such confidence
[53:38] and such
[53:40] hope
[53:41] in the one that calls you
[53:43] out of darkness
[53:45] into the marvelous light
[53:48] of his word
[53:50] uh
[53:51] just want to give you a little testimony
[53:54] of some things that happen
[53:56] different places
[54:00] i remember
[54:02] i remember one time i was praying in my
[54:06] office
[54:07] about
[54:09] whether the lord wanted me to go to the
[54:11] philippines
[54:13] and
[54:14] he spoke back to me
[54:17] and he said to me
[54:19] if you don't go soon
[54:21] your invitation
[54:23] is going to be cancelled
[54:26] that's all i needed
[54:29] amen
[54:30] i've been waiting two or three years
[54:32] just to hear from heaven because i don't
[54:35] want to go on my own
[54:37] inclination i want to i want to know
[54:40] that it's his time
[54:43] amen
[54:44] i
[54:45] i
[54:46] i've only go to one country
[54:49] and when i got there
[54:51] the lord told me this is not the time
[54:54] and that was the country of liberia i
[54:58] had a burden for the country i prayed
[55:01] for the country
[55:02] and uh
[55:04] but
[55:05] i didn't
[55:06] i i just couldn't get rid of the burden
[55:09] so i thought well i'll go
[55:13] and uh
[55:14] as soon as the plane landed
[55:17] the lord in his mercy
[55:20] and in his grace he said
[55:22] this is not the time
[55:26] i said lord i'm here
[55:28] he said this is not the hour
[55:32] but he said just
[55:35] continue the burden amen
[55:38] and so since then i've been privileged
[55:41] to go back
[55:43] about three times
[55:44] and every time we've seen souls
[55:47] come to the lord
[55:49] in prayer
[55:50] and there's quite a few churches now
[55:54] that are bearing the word
[55:57] of the lord
[55:59] and i'm so grateful to the lord for that
[56:03] amen
[56:05] he said
[56:07] he said
[56:10] i want to tell you about one country i
[56:13] went to because sometimes
[56:16] if you feel a burden and you don't know
[56:19] anybody in that country
[56:22] and you don't want to go
[56:24] unannounced and just
[56:26] you know you you'd like to
[56:28] write some letters so
[56:31] i called the
[56:32] voice of god and they give me a couple
[56:35] of addresses
[56:37] and so i wrote them immediately
[56:41] and told them that i'd be coming to
[56:43] their country and about what day
[56:46] i would be
[56:47] arriving in their particular country i
[56:50] was actually
[56:52] visiting about six different countries
[56:55] in africa
[56:57] at that particular trip
[56:59] and so
[57:02] i uh
[57:04] one of the countries was
[57:07] uh
[57:09] was uganda
[57:11] so
[57:12] i never got a reply
[57:15] but i'd already had my ticket to go
[57:18] there
[57:20] so i just continued the
[57:22] itinerary
[57:23] i had the names of the brothers that
[57:26] have been given to me
[57:28] so when i got to the
[57:30] to the city
[57:32] the first city to preach
[57:34] i asked the brother i wrote you
[57:37] about two months ago i never heard from
[57:41] you
[57:42] so
[57:43] i was just wondering if you got my
[57:45] letter
[57:46] he said no
[57:48] we didn't get your letter
[57:50] but we knew you were coming
[57:53] well how did you know
[57:55] i was coming
[57:57] there was a man that lives out of the
[58:00] city that had a vision
[58:02] and
[58:03] he said there's two men coming
[58:06] he said
[58:07] they've got a bible under their arm
[58:10] and the word of the lord said they'll be
[58:12] a blessing to the bride i said that's
[58:16] better than my letter
[58:18] amen
[58:19] amen
[58:21] so
[58:22] after i got finished there
[58:25] i went to the other city in fact
[58:27] in fact there was such an urge
[58:30] that
[58:33] i went down to the bus station i sent
[58:36] one monday
[58:37] one brother to the airport i sent
[58:40] another brother to the train station
[58:43] but the
[58:45] fastest way i could get there was the
[58:47] way i was going to go and so
[58:51] anyway
[58:53] uh
[58:54] we
[58:55] we got about halfway and the driver said
[58:58] we're not going any further today
[59:01] tomorrow we'll be going to the capitol
[59:04] well the capitol was off to the west
[59:07] but i was still going further north
[59:10] because i wrote them a letter and i'm
[59:13] just
[59:14] fulfilling my promise
[59:16] so uh
[59:19] when i got there
[59:21] i told the brother that was with me
[59:25] i said grab the first taxi but get the
[59:29] fare first if you don't get the prayer
[59:32] first sometime it's double
[59:36] and so
[59:37] get the prayer first so when he told me
[59:40] how much
[59:41] i said let's take it let's go
[59:44] so he took us out to the
[59:48] it was actually a bible college
[59:51] and
[59:52] the believer
[59:53] was one of the professors
[59:56] in the bible college
[59:58] and the pastor came out
[1:00:00] of the church when he saw
[1:00:03] us in her
[1:00:05] uh come
[1:00:06] come out of the car
[1:00:08] so he came out
[1:00:10] and i said brother i wrote you a letter
[1:00:13] about two months ago
[1:00:15] and he said
[1:00:18] i didn't get your letter but i knew you
[1:00:20] were coming
[1:00:22] how did you know i was coming
[1:00:25] and i said he said he said the lord gave
[1:00:30] me a dream
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:33] that you were going to come
[1:00:36] and bring the word of the lord to us
[1:00:38] will you preach this
[1:00:40] morning amen
[1:00:43] so the door was open
[1:00:46] but one thing that happened on that trip
[1:00:49] on my way from kenya
[1:00:52] going to uganda
[1:00:55] uh
[1:00:56] there was a young man that was going to
[1:00:59] travel with history because he he knew
[1:01:02] the brothers in uganda
[1:01:04] so he was going to travel with me
[1:01:07] and
[1:01:08] so
[1:01:09] we got to a certain city called el
[1:01:12] dorette
[1:01:14] and
[1:01:14] the driver said uh
[1:01:19] the bus
[1:01:20] the bus will not be going on today
[1:01:25] but
[1:01:25] there'll be another bus to take you on
[1:01:28] to where you're going
[1:01:30] and uh thank the lord
[1:01:33] anyway
[1:01:35] while i'm standing there
[1:01:37] the lord had told me to put a track in
[1:01:41] my pocket that morning that's the only
[1:01:43] time in the whole trip
[1:01:45] that he had told me to do that
[1:01:48] so
[1:01:49] i was i just stuck it in there and
[1:01:52] forgot all about it
[1:01:54] but while we were waiting at the bus
[1:01:56] stop
[1:01:58] a man came up
[1:02:00] warning at the track
[1:02:02] saying may i have that
[1:02:04] i said sure if you promise to read it
[1:02:08] and share it with others he said i will
[1:02:12] yeah
[1:02:13] and uh so i gave it to him
[1:02:16] and
[1:02:17] somebody else happened to see it from a
[1:02:20] distance
[1:02:21] and here they come running
[1:02:23] what about me
[1:02:26] so i reached in my briefcase
[1:02:29] and i got about half of all the tracks i
[1:02:32] had
[1:02:33] left
[1:02:35] we had given
[1:02:36] we had given so many tapes and tracks
[1:02:39] out along the way
[1:02:41] but uh anyway
[1:02:45] anyway
[1:02:46] the crowd just started coming from every
[1:02:49] direction
[1:02:50] and i said only one to the family i
[1:02:53] don't have enough for every individual
[1:02:57] but i gave
[1:02:58] one to every family
[1:03:01] that
[1:03:02] was represented there
[1:03:05] and so uh
[1:03:06] anyway
[1:03:08] brother peche from
[1:03:10] canada he was with me
[1:03:12] traveling with me on that trip
[1:03:16] and i said to him i'm going to have a
[1:03:19] street meeting in this city
[1:03:22] before i leave
[1:03:24] kenya
[1:03:25] and
[1:03:27] so
[1:03:28] he said
[1:03:29] my they're hungry
[1:03:31] and i said yes
[1:03:33] you know i said
[1:03:35] they've been taught communism
[1:03:39] probably some were given plenty to read
[1:03:42] but
[1:03:43] we haven't given
[1:03:45] very much of the gospel
[1:03:48] that they could read and understand
[1:03:51] the way to be saved
[1:03:53] anyway
[1:03:54] we
[1:03:55] we told the pastor
[1:03:57] that night
[1:03:58] that we were going to be
[1:04:00] closing the meeting at least one day
[1:04:04] sooner
[1:04:05] and
[1:04:06] so he asked us why
[1:04:09] when we told him what city we were in
[1:04:12] and we had a desire to go back there and
[1:04:15] preach
[1:04:16] he said wonderful
[1:04:19] wonderful we used to have a church there
[1:04:22] but he
[1:04:24] went into false doctrine
[1:04:27] i said well that's where i'm going amen
[1:04:31] and so
[1:04:33] the lord
[1:04:36] opened the door
[1:04:38] i had a little
[1:04:39] pa system that run on
[1:04:42] of
[1:04:43] batteries that i could just turn it on
[1:04:46] and off
[1:04:47] and so
[1:04:48] uh
[1:04:49] i had the brother that
[1:04:51] one of the brothers that
[1:04:53] was at the meeting the night before from
[1:04:56] the same city
[1:04:58] and
[1:05:00] he lived just outside of the city
[1:05:03] so i had him to sing a song
[1:05:06] he sang a song and people began to
[1:05:09] gather
[1:05:11] i mean in five or ten minutes we had
[1:05:14] about 200 people
[1:05:17] gathered
[1:05:18] very close
[1:05:20] we didn't have no trouble reaching them
[1:05:22] because the loudspeaker had reached a
[1:05:26] half a mile
[1:05:28] and so
[1:05:29] when they
[1:05:30] some heard it inside the stores
[1:05:33] so they came and stood at the door
[1:05:36] they couldn't leave the store but they
[1:05:39] come to hear
[1:05:40] from at the door
[1:05:44] anyway
[1:05:46] the first meeting
[1:05:48] the results was we
[1:05:50] we baptized
[1:05:52] 42 people
[1:05:54] out of that crowd
[1:05:57] so
[1:05:58] after we baptized them i said hey
[1:06:01] when you go fishing
[1:06:02] you don't get them all
[1:06:04] just one
[1:06:06] one saying
[1:06:07] you gotta
[1:06:10] you gotta try again
[1:06:12] let's go back and have another meeting
[1:06:16] we're right back to the same spot
[1:06:20] started preaching
[1:06:21] but a little further deeper in the
[1:06:23] message
[1:06:25] another crowd gathered
[1:06:27] and out of that group there was
[1:06:29] 25 or 27 i can't remember exactly
[1:06:34] that said they wanted to be baptized
[1:06:37] also so
[1:06:39] you know
[1:06:40] the wonderful thing was that
[1:06:43] one of the ones that give their hearts
[1:06:45] to the lord
[1:06:46] in those meetings
[1:06:49] became the pastor
[1:06:51] of the church
[1:06:53] and the very next
[1:06:56] two years later when i went back to
[1:06:59] visit
[1:07:00] they had 500 believers
[1:07:03] attending that church
[1:07:06] so
[1:07:07] they were standing true to the word
[1:07:10] isn't god wonderful
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:14] but on our way from one city to the
[1:07:18] other
[1:07:19] uh when the bus driver wasn't going any
[1:07:22] further
[1:07:24] i
[1:07:26] i was a little disappointed but
[1:07:28] anyway i had a brother with me
[1:07:31] uh that said don't worry there's a
[1:07:34] there's a church here in this city
[1:07:37] if we can find out where it is
[1:07:40] and uh so
[1:07:43] anyway i got off of the bus
[1:07:46] and there was
[1:07:47] a group of young people
[1:07:49] right in front of the bus
[1:07:52] begin to ask me questions
[1:07:54] you know where you're from
[1:07:57] what is your name
[1:07:59] uh
[1:08:01] where
[1:08:01] where are you going
[1:08:03] i said i'm going to heaven
[1:08:05] anybody want to go with me
[1:08:09] and
[1:08:10] this is
[1:08:11] what i'm said sir we don't know the way
[1:08:15] and there was a big
[1:08:17] big tree just in a park
[1:08:20] about
[1:08:21] 30 feet from where we were i said step
[1:08:25] over under the tree i'll tell you all
[1:08:28] about it we don't want to be in town
[1:08:31] five minutes here i am preaching
[1:08:36] and while i'm preaching two young men
[1:08:38] came up
[1:08:40] and asked by my god
[1:08:43] what's happening here
[1:08:45] so he said
[1:08:46] this man's from
[1:08:48] michigan in
[1:08:50] usa and he's preaching
[1:08:52] so
[1:08:53] he asked them
[1:08:55] where the pastor was
[1:08:58] that
[1:08:59] that
[1:09:00] was having services believing this
[1:09:03] message
[1:09:04] so ah he gave him
[1:09:08] the
[1:09:09] the sister that knew all about it
[1:09:12] said just call this number and she'll
[1:09:16] tell you
[1:09:16] because
[1:09:18] she's been reading some literature
[1:09:21] from
[1:09:22] the pastor
[1:09:23] and so uh
[1:09:25] praise the lord
[1:09:26] he he knows just what he's doing
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:31] i'll tell you he's so faithful
[1:09:34] to us
[1:09:36] sometimes
[1:09:38] you know
[1:09:40] we
[1:09:41] we just have to
[1:09:42] we just have to
[1:09:44] go by faith
[1:09:46] amen just by simple
[1:09:50] faith
[1:09:51] uh
[1:09:52] leave the results up to him
[1:09:56] amen
[1:09:57] but
[1:09:59] god always has a purpose and
[1:10:03] so when he
[1:10:05] when he
[1:10:07] told me
[1:10:08] if i was
[1:10:09] going to go to the philippines i better
[1:10:12] go
[1:10:13] very soon
[1:10:15] i just want to tell you a little bit
[1:10:17] about what happened
[1:10:18] a missionary
[1:10:21] had invited me to go there
[1:10:24] and i prayed
[1:10:26] but i hadn't felt the urge
[1:10:29] but
[1:10:30] i had i had sent him
[1:10:33] the church age book
[1:10:35] and asked him to read it
[1:10:38] when he read that
[1:10:40] i said in the church of
[1:10:42] the seal book
[1:10:44] and asked him to read it
[1:10:47] and he
[1:10:48] wrote back after he read it he said i'm
[1:10:52] going to have to read it again
[1:10:55] he said some things i don't understand
[1:10:59] and anyway
[1:11:02] anyway
[1:11:03] uh
[1:11:04] he
[1:11:06] he did not accept the message
[1:11:09] he had a lot of truth and had a good
[1:11:13] life
[1:11:14] behind him
[1:11:15] but the thing is
[1:11:18] the lord opened two bible schools
[1:11:21] the first trip
[1:11:23] that i went
[1:11:25] and wide open
[1:11:27] for me to preach
[1:11:28] the message
[1:11:30] in them
[1:11:31] and so
[1:11:33] of course
[1:11:34] of course
[1:11:36] when the organizations heard
[1:11:40] what i was preaching
[1:11:42] they became upset
[1:11:44] and they began to work against
[1:11:47] you know
[1:11:48] but
[1:11:50] so
[1:11:52] anyway
[1:11:53] anyway
[1:11:54] they had been
[1:11:56] writing some reports evil reports
[1:12:00] and things
[1:12:01] and so
[1:12:03] uh
[1:12:05] the lord
[1:12:09] the lord spoke to the head of the school
[1:12:13] he called all the students that we
[1:12:15] preached to
[1:12:17] and took them into a room
[1:12:19] i went in with them he said now
[1:12:23] he said this man is preaching us the
[1:12:26] truth
[1:12:27] said
[1:12:28] if you don't want to follow it that's up
[1:12:31] to you
[1:12:32] but i've already signed my resignation
[1:12:36] to come out of the organization
[1:12:39] and
[1:12:40] those who want to come out with me
[1:12:43] just sign
[1:12:45] your name on the same sheet of paper
[1:12:48] amen and i forget exactly but i believe
[1:12:52] it was 48 people
[1:12:55] that signed up
[1:12:57] and the 48 now didn't all get the whole
[1:13:01] revelation
[1:13:02] but some of them stayed faithful
[1:13:05] stayed true
[1:13:07] preached the word with all their heart
[1:13:10] and gave themself
[1:13:12] and so
[1:13:14] i was able
[1:13:16] on the first trip to baptize
[1:13:19] about 25 people
[1:13:22] and then
[1:13:24] and then uh
[1:13:26] the second trip
[1:13:28] there was more
[1:13:30] and
[1:13:30] about oh five years later
[1:13:34] they had a convention in
[1:13:36] manila the voice of god
[1:13:39] invited all the believers
[1:13:43] and so we had cooperated with them
[1:13:47] and so
[1:13:49] they had 800
[1:13:52] people
[1:13:53] that came to the convention
[1:13:56] that said they believed the message
[1:13:59] they were preaching the message
[1:14:02] now
[1:14:03] you know
[1:14:05] i didn't i didn't meet them all
[1:14:08] it's impossible
[1:14:10] the philippine
[1:14:12] islands has
[1:14:13] 38
[1:14:15] islands that are populated
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:20] and they're scattered over
[1:14:22] a
[1:14:23] 1500 mile
[1:14:26] radius
[1:14:27] so it's not easy to get to all of them
[1:14:31] but god has a way
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:35] hallelujah pray the lord of the harvest
[1:14:39] that he'll send
[1:14:41] a harvest
[1:14:43] uh some of you might remember our
[1:14:45] testimony
[1:14:48] about
[1:14:49] two years after we went to honduras
[1:14:53] now
[1:14:54] the first trip that i took there
[1:14:58] uh
[1:14:59] there were seven preachers that had
[1:15:02] already received a call
[1:15:05] but this was the first time
[1:15:07] i had met any of them
[1:15:10] so instead of me picking out
[1:15:14] i asked those ministers to pick out
[1:15:17] one
[1:15:18] i said we cannot send everybody
[1:15:22] but we would like to send one
[1:15:24] full time
[1:15:26] into the field
[1:15:28] and uh
[1:15:29] so they chose
[1:15:31] brother lesandro hernandez
[1:15:34] he had already been out
[1:15:36] he had already had people baptized
[1:15:40] and uh
[1:15:42] just had a wonderful spirit
[1:15:45] and uh so anyway
[1:15:48] uh
[1:15:49] he came
[1:15:50] from one of his missionary trips that he
[1:15:53] had been
[1:15:54] in honduras preaching in different
[1:15:56] churches
[1:15:58] and uh
[1:16:00] when he got off of the bus
[1:16:03] there were people standing there
[1:16:05] waiting to
[1:16:07] receive him and greet him
[1:16:09] and notify him
[1:16:11] that his mother
[1:16:13] had passed away
[1:16:15] just a few hours
[1:16:17] before this
[1:16:19] and so he asked
[1:16:21] some of the brothers would they go down
[1:16:24] to his house
[1:16:26] to pray
[1:16:28] for his mother
[1:16:30] and so they prayed
[1:16:32] and brother lisandro
[1:16:35] he prayed like this
[1:16:36] lord
[1:16:38] i i don't want to bear my mother
[1:16:41] without at least a box
[1:16:44] and you know i spent all my money
[1:16:47] out preaching your word
[1:16:49] and
[1:16:50] i don't have money to build
[1:16:53] a wooden box to bury her in
[1:16:57] and
[1:16:58] but i remember your word said that
[1:17:00] you're the resurrection
[1:17:02] and the life
[1:17:04] and when he
[1:17:05] prayed that scripture and quoted that
[1:17:08] scripture
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:11] she came back out of her death
[1:17:14] amen
[1:17:16] hallelujah
[1:17:18] and she said yes she had crossed over
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:23] but she lived about 15 more years
[1:17:29] hallelujah
[1:17:30] after that
[1:17:32] they never buried a dead person until
[1:17:35] they had a prayer meeting first
[1:17:38] amen
[1:17:40] imagine if we do that more we'll see
[1:17:43] more
[1:17:44] results
[1:17:47] i i happen to be familiar with
[1:17:50] the last report i got there were eight
[1:17:54] people had been raised from the dead
[1:17:57] hallelujah
[1:17:59] amen god is faithful isn't it
[1:18:02] hallelujah
[1:18:04] we
[1:18:05] we
[1:18:06] we heard about a brother who lived in
[1:18:09] liberia
[1:18:11] his name was brother stephen
[1:18:14] and
[1:18:15] the brothers in nick
[1:18:18] in nigeria
[1:18:19] said be sure to visit him
[1:18:22] he lives a long ways from the capital
[1:18:25] and most of the churches are in the
[1:18:28] capital
[1:18:29] area
[1:18:30] and he said be sure said he's a faithful
[1:18:33] brother
[1:18:35] i have met him personally
[1:18:37] well
[1:18:39] good recommendation
[1:18:41] sure enough he was at the meeting
[1:18:44] and of course
[1:18:46] it didn't take long for him to invite me
[1:18:50] to his place
[1:18:52] so
[1:18:53] one of the brothers
[1:18:55] uh
[1:18:56] in there was only i think one pastor
[1:18:59] in the whole group that had a vehicle
[1:19:04] so he agreed to
[1:19:05] take me to
[1:19:07] brother steven's place
[1:19:10] and so we went there
[1:19:13] and began to preach
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:18] he had actually
[1:19:20] been a refugee
[1:19:23] in the country of
[1:19:26] ghana
[1:19:28] and
[1:19:29] he uh
[1:19:31] he had heard the message
[1:19:33] while he was a refugee
[1:19:35] he believed the message
[1:19:37] they had given him books
[1:19:39] he had read the books he believed
[1:19:43] he believed the report amen
[1:19:47] so when finally the war was over that
[1:19:50] was
[1:19:50] that was why so many fled the country
[1:19:53] there was just war
[1:19:55] all over the country
[1:19:58] and many had fled the country
[1:20:02] but so when he got to go back
[1:20:06] to his country
[1:20:09] the first big city
[1:20:11] he stopped in
[1:20:14] he had his family with him
[1:20:16] but he said
[1:20:19] before i leave this city i'm going to
[1:20:21] preach
[1:20:23] and so he began to preach right on the
[1:20:26] streets
[1:20:27] and people began to gather
[1:20:29] and listen to it he had about 20 that
[1:20:33] was baptized
[1:20:37] very soon very quickly
[1:20:40] so then he couldn't leave the town
[1:20:43] he didn't want to leave behind
[1:20:45] so
[1:20:46] someway
[1:20:48] one of the city officials had told him a
[1:20:51] lot
[1:20:52] that he could build a temporary church
[1:20:55] but he said it'll have to be temporary
[1:20:58] because
[1:21:00] they're gonna
[1:21:02] they're gonna come through there and put
[1:21:04] a street
[1:21:06] in this area
[1:21:08] and uh
[1:21:09] but
[1:21:11] he he asked him not to tell nobody
[1:21:14] he told him it was okay
[1:21:18] well
[1:21:19] he had told him he might have two years
[1:21:23] but in reality he had about 10 years
[1:21:28] to preach
[1:21:30] in that place
[1:21:32] and he had a nice little congregation
[1:21:36] but
[1:21:38] after i had visited him the first time i
[1:21:42] heard that they were going to come
[1:21:44] through and bulldoze
[1:21:46] the the buildings that were
[1:21:49] there that they will worship again plus
[1:21:52] this house
[1:21:54] that he had built he had a family of
[1:21:57] five
[1:21:58] and uh
[1:22:00] so
[1:22:02] the
[1:22:03] lord put it on my heart to go back to
[1:22:06] his city
[1:22:08] and and so
[1:22:11] uh
[1:22:12] we didn't know how long
[1:22:14] uh they said it could be
[1:22:16] any day
[1:22:18] they would be bulldozing the place
[1:22:21] but uh the lord gave us time
[1:22:26] they had already bought two lots
[1:22:30] one for the pastor
[1:22:32] and the pastor had bought one and the
[1:22:35] church had bought one
[1:22:37] and so
[1:22:39] uh
[1:22:40] the one that the
[1:22:41] church had bought
[1:22:45] was bigger
[1:22:46] but it was not in uh
[1:22:49] quite a nicer location
[1:22:52] as the other
[1:22:54] so
[1:22:55] they traded lots
[1:22:57] and
[1:22:58] so the lord had
[1:23:00] blessed the people in ann arbor
[1:23:03] to bless me with
[1:23:05] missionary offerings
[1:23:07] and i was able to take
[1:23:10] and
[1:23:11] and
[1:23:12] i told him to start
[1:23:14] making the blocks
[1:23:17] amen so they started making blocks
[1:23:22] we
[1:23:23] we went down and
[1:23:26] all we had was a was a motorcycle to
[1:23:29] pull the iron
[1:23:31] to put in the foundation
[1:23:34] but we was able to pull it from the from
[1:23:37] the place to the place where was going
[1:23:40] to build the church and they poured the
[1:23:43] concrete foundations and
[1:23:45] and began to lay the blocks and
[1:23:49] the lord helped us until we were able to
[1:23:53] get the doors
[1:23:54] on the church
[1:23:56] and the windows
[1:23:57] amen
[1:23:58] the church is still going on amen
[1:24:03] so just pray
[1:24:05] there's another church in
[1:24:07] in liberia that we
[1:24:10] would like for you to pray for
[1:24:12] they have
[1:24:14] they've put the walls up
[1:24:17] but they've come
[1:24:19] to the roof
[1:24:20] and
[1:24:21] uh they've run out of money
[1:24:24] and of course
[1:24:26] they let me know that
[1:24:28] but i told them that we'll have to pray
[1:24:31] and let the lord
[1:24:33] supply the need
[1:24:35] and so we have been able to send
[1:24:38] some money to them
[1:24:40] but they need just the roof now
[1:24:42] primarily the roof
[1:24:45] would kind of finish it to where they
[1:24:47] could start worshiping
[1:24:49] in the building
[1:24:50] otherwise they have to rent a building
[1:24:53] until
[1:24:54] so
[1:24:56] be in prayer for that brother
[1:24:58] his name's brother william
[1:25:04] excuse me
[1:25:06] amen
[1:25:08] oh
[1:25:11] it's hard to tell the whole story
[1:25:16] the lord's been so faithful
[1:25:20] he's been so good
[1:25:25] we
[1:25:26] were having services in the philippines
[1:25:30] and
[1:25:32] it was in a university
[1:25:35] uh
[1:25:36] auditorium that we were able to rent
[1:25:39] to have the services
[1:25:41] and two or three of the pastors joined
[1:25:44] in
[1:25:45] with me
[1:25:46] and
[1:25:48] supplied the music for the services and
[1:25:52] so
[1:25:55] none of them had cars
[1:25:58] so we all had to catch the bus
[1:26:01] to go back in time so we stood out on
[1:26:04] the street
[1:26:05] waiting for the bus to come
[1:26:09] and uh
[1:26:10] so
[1:26:12] there were some people that come by and
[1:26:14] so forth
[1:26:16] but
[1:26:18] after they had passed us
[1:26:21] and going up
[1:26:22] about
[1:26:23] oh
[1:26:24] no more than a city block
[1:26:26] from where we were standing
[1:26:29] uh
[1:26:31] the driver of the taxi
[1:26:34] a jeepney i guess you'd call it
[1:26:38] uh
[1:26:39] they make them in the philippines
[1:26:41] and he happened to see some of the men
[1:26:45] had machetes
[1:26:47] and
[1:26:49] so
[1:26:51] he drove
[1:26:52] up about
[1:26:54] 50 yards
[1:26:56] and there were policemen there that
[1:26:58] stopped them
[1:27:00] so he stopped
[1:27:02] and and then
[1:27:05] uh
[1:27:07] the driver jumped out of the vehicle
[1:27:11] with the keys
[1:27:14] and
[1:27:16] and
[1:27:17] he said car nappers car nappers
[1:27:21] so the police come running
[1:27:24] and those people got out of that vehicle
[1:27:28] but
[1:27:29] we were coming
[1:27:30] actually they were one vehicle ahead of
[1:27:33] the one we got in
[1:27:36] you know
[1:27:37] they were intending to rob the people
[1:27:40] but god was merciful
[1:27:43] god was very good
[1:27:45] and very merciful
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:48] he's always kind
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:55] i
[1:27:58] i want you to know that
[1:28:02] when we're doing his service
[1:28:04] remember
[1:28:08] the bible said
[1:28:12] those that die
[1:28:15] without
[1:28:16] knowing the truth
[1:28:18] you know
[1:28:20] they have no chance
[1:28:23] they've got to hear the word
[1:28:27] and we have a responsibility
[1:28:30] to do all within our power
[1:28:33] to bring him to the knowledge
[1:28:35] of the truth
[1:28:38] because
[1:28:41] who's going to hear
[1:28:42] without a preacher
[1:28:44] and how they're going to preach
[1:28:46] except they be sent
[1:28:49] hallelujah
[1:28:51] one of the greatest blessings that we
[1:28:53] can have
[1:28:54] is to know
[1:28:56] that he has sent us
[1:28:58] hallelujah
[1:29:01] and then we can go in confidence
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:06] we can go in confidence
[1:29:08] knowing that he's sinners
[1:29:11] hallelujah
[1:29:12] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:29:17] hallelujah
[1:29:19] but remember there will be persecutions
[1:29:23] there will be criticisms
[1:29:26] there will be some enemies
[1:29:29] of the true gospel
[1:29:31] amen
[1:29:32] but we need not to fear
[1:29:35] because greater is he that is within us
[1:29:40] and he that's in the world
[1:29:43] hallelujah
[1:29:44] he's the one
[1:29:46] that protects
[1:29:48] he's the one that guides
[1:29:51] one of the
[1:29:52] one of the meetings that we
[1:29:55] didn't get to advertise
[1:29:57] greatly
[1:29:58] we just put it over the radio
[1:30:01] for a short time
[1:30:03] it was going to be in a in a building
[1:30:07] that we were able to rent
[1:30:10] kind of
[1:30:11] on the
[1:30:12] spur of the moment
[1:30:13] then the only way we could advertise it
[1:30:16] was on the radio
[1:30:18] and uh
[1:30:20] so the people gathered there was quite a
[1:30:23] good number they gathered together
[1:30:26] we gave the invitation
[1:30:30] 14 people came
[1:30:32] forward to the altar
[1:30:35] and we just prayed for him one by one
[1:30:40] and i can say
[1:30:41] if i could understand what happened to
[1:30:44] them all 14 of them received the baptism
[1:30:49] of the holy ghost
[1:30:51] there were more people heard the message
[1:30:54] but these 14 believe the message
[1:30:58] amen they were new
[1:31:01] to the faith
[1:31:02] they was new to the word
[1:31:05] but the churches are still growing
[1:31:08] amen pray for brother larry heart
[1:31:12] he is
[1:31:13] beginning to go over
[1:31:15] every year
[1:31:17] and
[1:31:18] and spread the word
[1:31:20] and god has used him
[1:31:22] god excused him greatly in the past
[1:31:26] and
[1:31:27] he's really rededicated himself
[1:31:31] to the lord
[1:31:33] and
[1:31:34] so
[1:31:35] the lord has
[1:31:37] has given favor with the people
[1:31:40] and
[1:31:41] to hold him up because he still spread
[1:31:44] the word
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:48] hallelujah
[1:31:49] we got to go into areas
[1:31:52] that we had never
[1:31:54] been
[1:31:55] before
[1:31:56] remember
[1:32:00] all we have to do is obey his word
[1:32:06] hallelujah
[1:32:09] the fields are white to harvest
[1:32:13] and the lord said
[1:32:17] pray he
[1:32:19] the lord of the harvest
[1:32:22] that he will send more
[1:32:25] into the harvest
[1:32:27] and that's one thing all of us can do
[1:32:30] we can all pray
[1:32:33] we can all ask god
[1:32:36] to speak to hearts
[1:32:39] because he has to stir their hearts
[1:32:43] to be willing to do whatever he calls
[1:32:46] them to do
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:49] and then
[1:32:51] he'll make it
[1:32:52] clear that's the wonderful thing about
[1:32:56] the lord
[1:32:58] he makes it clear
[1:33:01] what he wants us to do
[1:33:04] it's such a joy
[1:33:06] to see souls come
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:11] to know him
[1:33:13] in the power of his resurrection
[1:33:16] even in the fellowship
[1:33:19] of his suffering
[1:33:21] amen
[1:33:23] yes
[1:33:24] we were
[1:33:25] we were preaching with brother
[1:33:27] dan williams
[1:33:30] from arizona while he was pastoring
[1:33:33] actually in louisiana
[1:33:36] his he and his father
[1:33:39] went with us
[1:33:41] and
[1:33:43] so
[1:33:44] uh it had rained all day long
[1:33:47] and i remember praying asking god to
[1:33:51] stop the rain
[1:33:53] before the service started so people
[1:33:57] most of them did not have a vehicle
[1:34:00] they had to walk
[1:34:02] or if they had money they could ride a
[1:34:05] bus
[1:34:07] and so
[1:34:08] and so
[1:34:10] we should have prayed
[1:34:12] we should have prayed for the lord not
[1:34:14] only to stop the rain
[1:34:16] but to keep the rain stopped
[1:34:20] after we met
[1:34:23] we
[1:34:24] began to
[1:34:26] preach the word
[1:34:28] and it began to
[1:34:30] rain just not real hard
[1:34:34] a lot of them had umbrellas and those
[1:34:36] who had umbrellas
[1:34:38] put their umbrellas up
[1:34:41] and
[1:34:42] so when i came to preach
[1:34:44] i just prayed
[1:34:46] oh god of elijah
[1:34:49] you can send the rain but you also
[1:34:52] can stop the rain
[1:34:54] and these that have come to hear the
[1:34:57] word to be able to enjoy the word more
[1:35:01] if you will
[1:35:03] just in the rain and we just started
[1:35:05] preaching
[1:35:07] and
[1:35:08] no more than 10 minutes
[1:35:11] the rain
[1:35:12] stopped and another 10 minutes or 15
[1:35:18] uh the umbrellas went back up but not
[1:35:21] from the rain the sun came out so bright
[1:35:26] hallelujah amen
[1:35:30] hallelujah
[1:35:31] so
[1:35:34] you know it was a
[1:35:36] blessing to them that night
[1:35:39] we did not call a prayer line for the
[1:35:41] sick
[1:35:42] but
[1:35:44] we called for sinners
[1:35:46] but after the service
[1:35:51] i had told
[1:35:53] of a dream
[1:35:56] that a brother in my church
[1:35:58] had had before i left
[1:36:02] and
[1:36:03] i had not i had not told it
[1:36:06] to but one other church
[1:36:10] and i've been to several churches
[1:36:12] already
[1:36:14] but anyway
[1:36:16] anyway
[1:36:19] this sister
[1:36:22] she she asked
[1:36:25] one of the deacons to come
[1:36:27] and ask me
[1:36:29] to come and pray for her
[1:36:33] and so i looked for my daughter since it
[1:36:36] was a sister but i couldn't see her she
[1:36:39] was kind of swallowed up in the crowd
[1:36:42] but i did see brother brother williams
[1:36:46] he's
[1:36:47] about six inches taller than me
[1:36:51] and so it was easy to find him
[1:36:54] so i said you better come and go with me
[1:36:56] brother
[1:36:57] there's someone calling for prayer
[1:37:01] amen
[1:37:02] and
[1:37:03] she was in such pain
[1:37:06] she was just rolling
[1:37:08] in pain
[1:37:10] and
[1:37:10] so we prayed
[1:37:13] and
[1:37:15] so i said sister
[1:37:17] in the name of the lord
[1:37:19] stand
[1:37:20] on your feet
[1:37:22] and
[1:37:23] she got up
[1:37:25] she said i tried to get up a little
[1:37:27] while ago
[1:37:29] and i couldn't get up
[1:37:31] but she was able to get up
