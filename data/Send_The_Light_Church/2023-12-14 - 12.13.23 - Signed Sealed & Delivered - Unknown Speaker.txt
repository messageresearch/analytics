going to make it or negativity or whatever the devil has to present I want to be Standing on the Promises of the Lord amen I certainly appreciate that worship service amen amen you know it's a good worship service when you're in the back and you want you wish you were in in there amen amen well let's turn in our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4 we're going to read a verse of scripture there and let you be seated amen well we're thankful for the Lord uh touching amariah amen we just are thankful for his grace and he's he's Among Us amen we never want to forget that no matter what we're going through God is Among Us amen amen Let's uh just ask God's blessings and the reading of the word this part of the service Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace where would we be if it had not been for your grace in our lives today Lord we thank you for the grace you've given us today thank you for your mercies that you had upon us even this day Lord our thoughts are about that incident that that took place that that man that came against uh Israel so publicly that lost his life God we know that nothing is goes un seen by you Lord as we stand here today we ask that you would cleanse us of our sins anything that might be displeasing to you Lord as we approach your holy word today we just ask Lord that you would sanctify us cleanse our minds and give us the mind of Christ Lord we want to see the scriptures the way that you spoke them Lord as they were written we pray heavenly father that you come amongst us and just help each and every one of us today that we might leave here Lord with the direction of your word for your word is a light it's a lamp it it directs Us in the path that you wouldd have us to take and we're asking you that You' lead and guide all of us father bless this word now Lord as we commit uh the service and all of our lives in to your hands for your honor and Glory we pray these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and turn with me if you would to the book of Ephesians chapter 4 we're going to read just one verse there and that is verse number 30 Ephesians 4:3 says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption amen God bless you may be seated there's a lot of things we could take from the this scripture but we want to entitle this message Sign Sealed and Delivered amen Sign Sealed and Delivered now there are are different types of seals and when we hear the word seal we might be thinking of the animals that live in the water sea lions and there's 34 species uh living and they say that there's uh more than 50 that are extinct of those little guys we could also be thinking about an elite group of the Navy military called the seals amen amen um dictionary tells us it's a device or substance that's used to join two things together as to prevent them from coming apart or to prevent anything from passing between them amen our our vehicles that we drove here has seals in them amen uh but this word sealed in this verse means to stamp with a signate or a private Mark for security or perservation by implication to keep a secret to attest to set a stop now that's what it means and of course when God seals us it's a a private Mark it's the he's the one that's puts the stamp on it amen and we're just for him amen now often uh seals just in life are required by the state or federal laws and even some corporations uh require uh a seal and if you've ever had any a notary republic had a need for that that they have to be present when you're signing something and so they can put a seal on it that it every everything they have to make sure all the papers are in order and then they can uh e execute a final uh stamp or or seal and sometimes uh we've been asked to provide our birth certificates uh or marriage license to get things you ever have to do that you know where you should be saying amen these are not hard hard things uh but there are times that when and they ask for these things that they cannot use a copy they need an original with a original seal upon it and I'm sure if you've ever bought property or house you know how many there's a lot of documents that you have to go through amen and there there must be a clear abstract of the the title de before we can ever receive um uh a clear deed to be handed over to us to say it's ours now and when it is then they can put a seal of uh aity a authenticity yes one of those seals on there saying that it is good to go and uh a seal it brings a a certificate uh to the documents that everything is guaranteed and is in order amen now court of law sometimes will actually seal up certain documents that contains sensitive information uh they call it classified and when God you know covers Us with the blood it just it seals up amen and and our sins are put in the in the SE forget from us we they can't even be brought up anymore right amen and uh even though the devil you know he remembers them and he tries to you know bring them to our our thoughts but we must remembered that God can't even remember them it's sealed amen the Bible says that the foundation standeth sure having this seal the foundation of God s Sure having this seal it's a seal the Lord knoweth them that are his amen it's a seal God just knows you don't ever have to wonder if God knows that you belong to him he knows in fact Jesus said all that the father has given me will come and I'll lose nothing right so if you belong to God God knows about it don't worry about it amen now God literally puts a spiritual seal upon believers who have all their spiritual documents in order in other words they have applied the word of God to their lives amen not just some of the word not just most of the word but man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now we know a man can have some of his documents in order but not have all of them in order in other words a man can be justified completely have a signed document wrot in the blood of Jesus Christ this man is Justified as if he never done it and still not have his sanctification documents in order right man can be justified and Sanctified in the sight of God and still be waiting for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen and I'll just say like this we all should be saying Amen to the Scripture it just say I receive it Lord a man can can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in his life on the outside Realms and still miss it that's right amen that's in the in the message leadership a man can have the Holy Ghost working in his life and still be waiting for the Seal of the Holy Ghost so I'm trying to bring a distinction to the seal not only that but a man can be saved and Justified and he can still lose his salvation so you can be justified Sanctified still waiting for the seal but you can also be justified and Sanctified and you can lose your salvation I know this is strong but look we've got to stay with the scriptures Revelations 3:5 says our names can be blotted out of The Book of Life so we need to go on and get the seal because it's only the seal that holds us to the day of redemption amen so I believe in eternal security but I believe you need to be sealed to have that right amen now remember before God ever seals anyone he has to make sure he does make sure that everything is in order that this person has met all the scriptural requirements amen the Bible says he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obeys him right so he's the one that determines whether we've obeyed him enough I don't you don't he does it's up to us to say Lord have I have I done everything that you've asked me to do is there anything more you want me to do because it's in that process of Lord here's my heart I want to please you more that that God is able to to to reveal to you what he wants you to do next and this is vital because if we don't go on to get the seal we're not going to make a Rapture amen amen amen we he makes sure that all the worldliness is out of us that the old Nature's been stripped away and that a man has died to himself G Brenham said in the message the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals he says now you just went to the borderline and come back you're still lusting for the things of the world you never went all the way over into Canaan you see across Jordan which is death to South amen remember the children of Israel that came out of Egypt they went so far with God but they were afraid to go all the way because in honest they were afraid of losing their life and what happens to most Christians that don't go all the way they're afraid they don't want to give up their will right they're afraid to give up their will they're afraid of the Giants what's going to happen if I can't do what I want to do anymore in my life in the message the law having a shadow brother Brandon says for you're sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of redemption and you are dead amen and your life life is hid in God through Christ and sealed there by the Holy Ghost now that's all one sentence I love it and the next sentence only two sentences this quote he said your destination is determined right then when you are sealed by the Holy Ghost this is this is to me can be confusing because we know that we've been predestined from the foundation of the world right right but he says here your destination is determined right there Then when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost so what's what is God getting across to us that we shouldn't just go by a a a understanding or a mental belief that we've been predestinated and we know where we're going right God does not want us to determine our destination until we've received the Seal of the Holy Ghost amen and then that itself is the proof of where you're going right come on we don't want to sit here and try to you know make well because we're in the message we're going and because they're not in the message they're not going no we have scripture the scripture says when we're sealed then we know we're going amen so we stay with the word don't leave the word because Satan wants us to get us to reason bam talked about a train inspector how he had to inspect every box card to make sure that everything was in order before he sealed it you remember that amen and the seal could not be broken until it reached it its final destination either can the seal be broken if God seals us it can't be broken this ought to make us the happiest people on the planet in the message Jehovah jbra brother BR says before a car can be sealed a box car just everything has got to fit in their good and tight that's the reason so many don't get the Holy Ghost because they're too loose think about that I'm sure most of you remember in January 28th of 1986 the Challenger broke apart just 73 seconds after it took off and all seven of the crew Men lost their life because of a faulty seal right amen and I'll tell you I think there's a lot of people who think they're sealed but if you don't get the seal you're going through tribulation amen the seal is the only thing that's going to bypass tribulation it's not being in the message it's not knowing god son a prophet right it's not whatever you want to fill in the blank there is only one thing that can fill in the blank and the Bible says You must be sealed with the Holy Ghost amen that is the only thing amen amen because if there was an easier way we would all take the easier way but there isn't God identifies us here on this side before the other side I cannot emphasize how important it is to keep moving on and receive more and more of the Holy Ghost don't settle for what you have that's right become sost that's right hungry thirsty inoculated with the Holy Ghost that nothing but God comes out amen amen amen we're not automatically sealed with the Holy Ghost when we're serving the lord that's not what sealed means we get too too comfortable with how much of God we got and when we look at somebody that you know maybe doesn't have as much as we have we feel okay but that is the worst thing if if there if there isn't a Hunger for More that's the first thing you need to deal with Amen in the message Jehovah Gyra brother B says brother that's the only way that God ever makes you a Seed of Abraham ever makes you a Seed of Abraham I thought we when the spirit of Christ comes into you then you become a Seed of Abraham now it's just just as pure and right is the Bible tells us that by faith we're children of Abraham through faith we're children of Abraham well it's when you believe but this belief is is not just I believe but it's when God comes and he testifies of your faith right by giving you his Spirit into your life amen the way that brother random expressed it is that when we get baptized that's us saying I accept you Lord right but it's not until God fills you with the Holy Ghost that he's saying to you I accept you into the bride Genesis 15:6 says and Abraham believed believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness that's right amen so Abraham had faith and his faith Justified him amen but I want to say it like this his faith was not made perfect until he offered up Isaac and that was many years different are you with me okay we're going to prove that James chapter 2 ver 2 says but will thou man will thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar see thou how Faith wrought his works and by works his faith was made perfect so amen we see before he even had Isaac he had faith and he was justified before God but it wasn't until his faith turned into Works down the road that God said okay it's perfect are you with me verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which sayith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only right you know I'm so glad for all the word it's hard to get a good understanding if you're only looking at part of the word you need the whole word right now we know that Abraham obviously believed in God at at age 75 when he was called out of the earth of the chales is that right amen and Abraham was probably in his 80s when God said that his faith was counted unto him him for righteousness there in Genesis CH 15 and a little bit later in his age when he was 86 years old ishmail was born now Abraham didn't receive the sign or the Seal of circumcision until he was 99 years old think about that and then the promise you talk about Standing on the Promises it was then that the promised son was manifested amen we're never going to manifest Christ completely until we are sealed with the Holy Ghost and it's Christ that has the preeminence in our lives amen we've got to go on we've got to go on Saints receive more of the Holy Ghost amen don't you determine you have enough don't do do that let God be the one that determines it you keep hungering you keep thirsting you keep saying Lord I need to manifest more of you I see it my life I see it my thoughts I see it my action I see it with my selfishness how I spend so much time just doing what I want to do you just be honest with God that's right Galatians chapter 3 verse 5 says he therefore that miners to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you he asked the question doeth he by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith God is working amongst us God does things in our lives we hear we've heard some testimonies and I'm so thankful for the testimonies that we're hearing so the question we could ask does does God is God doing that by The Works of the law or is he is he doing it by the hearing of Faith it's when God speaks right God speaks that's Faith amen amen even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted unto him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before the uh preach before the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham Bible says the just shall live by faith look at verse 14 that the blessing that the blessing this is such a powerful verse to me that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith amen God wanted Abraham to continue on yes he didn't say you know uh it was counted unto you for righteousness and you know everything's going to be okay you're going to be uh you're going to be a father many nations and you don't have to do anything more there were still more for 25 years he was being tried and somehow he had to get up in the morning as the prophet said anything yet to Sarah Sarah just kept making the booties getting ready for the sun to come and yet he went through the trial well maybe you know maybe I got to do this and maybe we got to do that maybe we got to help make this thing come to pass God don't need anything us to do except be obedient to the word and he will bring it to pass amen that's right when we get involved outside of the word of God trouble Calamity problems happen every time we triy to do something outside of the word Romans chapter 4:10 now was Abraham's Faith then reckoned how was Abraham's Faith then reckoned it's a question when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision so Abraham's Faith was reckoned before he ever received the Seal of circumcision just like our faith can be reckoned before God before we ever receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost that's why we can be yet in our sins God come down and say I you belong to me you need to uh give up your life Surrender Your Life uh or or or you're going to miss it you're going to go to hell and at that point something happens yes there's a connection I belong to God something inside of me is bearing witness with this truth that I belong to God and I need to give my get my life straight I give my heart to God and it's at that time in your uncircumcision that God can justify you he can sanctify you it doesn't mean we've receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost anything in the Old Testament is a type to the New Testament this is what Abraham went through it's assigned to us and this is you know brother Brenham dealt with this with ministers during his time and I'm afraid that there's too many people that are stopping short of getting the seal the Holy Ghost and they're wondering what's going on and why it brings so much confusion in their lives there's more for us yes there's more for the people of God Amen let's not let a promise slip us let's go on Amen verse 11 and he received the sign of circumcision see it's a sign then he calls it a seal of righteousness of Faith which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of them all that believed though they be not circumcised that the righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but this the Gentiles but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had been yet uncircumcised so no matter where we're at we can take the first step and come into justification amen amen men for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed uh through the law but through the righteousness of Faith just believing that God provided a way for us okay verse 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to them also which is of the faith of Abraham who's the father of us all the promise is sure to all the seed that's right and we must walk in the steps of Our Father Abraham the first step we take is in our uncircumcised State he will forgive us and he will justify us in that state of being uncircumcised he has to but the next step is a step of of Grace also and this is sanctification it's a step and that's where our nature becomes cleansed and we're set aside for the service of God where he can use us this is in the second step of Grace are you with me this is walking in the steps of our father abraam brother Bram actually goes through these the next step of Grace is receiving the the Holy Ghost I'm going to say this no matter how much Holy Ghost you've received don't stop seeking more you will on the other side you will never find one person there that made it in the Rapture that said you know I put the pedal to the metal too much and I was I didn't really have to seek all that but you will find many who miss it will say I wish I would have sought God more amen I wish I would have sought more of the Holy Ghost so don't stop seeking don't stop seeking until you know that you know that you know that you're sealed that's right all you just be honest all you got to do is look at your life and look at the times that the Satan has lied to you deceived you you thought you were right and found out you were wrong amen that's enough evidence to make me want to be sure are you with me I don't want to gamble on that I don't want to gamble on that I'd rather be seeking more of God am in the message the Masterpiece what a wonderful message brother man says now notice here the life that was in the in the stalk and in the tassel all gathers in the seed yes and the light that was in the stalk went one went into the other justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in into Perfection amen back to the word again Amen to manifest itself amen see why the whole world is just looking at Calvary and saying Lord thank you for Calvary thank you for dying for me thank you for saving me that's all I need there's a bride that wants to manifest Jesus Christ amen amen that life comes back into her changes the nature All Things become of God Amen now when the Holy Ghost seals you you're sealed to the day of redemption that means God himself will not break the seal the seal that he's put on your life he will not break it his word is forever settled in heaven it will not return void if he said it cannot be broken it it won't be broken he won't break it no matter what you do because you will fall you will make mistakes right it's really good but the seal is there and it he won't break it there's not a human being in the world that can break that seal Jesus said no man can pluck you from the father's hand no hand no man can pluck you from my hand right that's what he said amen here's the big one the devil can't break the seal he'll try everything he can to get into your life brother bam said when you're sealed with the Holy Ghost the devil sealed out I like that so when he comes to your mind and he tries to torment you up here just remember there's a seal you don't have to listen to [Music] that St will try to steal your joy and steal your peace and if you let him in your mind he will do it right but the seal right keeps that stuff out come on the holy let me just say it like this the devil already got kicked out of heaven that means God didn't want him there doing any more stuff that he was doing he already disrupted if the Holy Ghost is in you sealed in you do you think he wants the devil coming in there no so when he comes to your mind you already matically know what God wants you to do amen and it's we're free more agencies now we're not robots it's a joint meeting you and God Have Become One amen don't expect God don't expect God to do what you can do and and God don't expect you to do what only he can do that's why we use the name of Jesus Jesus amen that's he has given his power right all power is given unto me and he gives his power over the enemy and when God is sealed in you don't have to listen to devil I don't care what he's saying just say you're sealed out in my life now when you fall and you will you can be a righteous man sealed with the Holy Ghost and fall but you'll get back up amen right you'll get back up amen that's a good indication where you're standing because the Holy Ghost Inside of You says don't stay down get back up now when the Holy Spirit is sealed inside you to the day of redemption that means everything that comes with the Holy Ghost is already inside of you so peace is inside of you Joy Bo is inside of you love is everything that is of god is in you when you receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost now that's how come we can see people sometimes you know sometimes they're on cloud nine they're praising and shouting and you know God is with me and and then the you know next week they're just down in the dumps when you're sealed you're sealed and I think we need to make sure we don't got any faulty seals we need to make sure we got a good seal amen um check everywhere hold yourself accountable let the Holy Ghost inside of you hold you accountable now when Satan starts flooding us with negativity The Living Word is going to stand up against it the Bible says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him amen well if the Holy Ghost is in you then you're going to raise up that standard you're not going to allow this enemy the enemy to come and just torment you with negativity and tell you that things are you know things aren't going to work out and things are bad and you know you might as well just quit and you know nobody's listening all that stuff is not of God it's not of God don't wait for God out here to change your circumstances that ain't the way he raises up a standard let me say it like this this man that said the wrong thing and died can you imagine every time we had a wrong thought what would happen to us if the grace of God wasn't there amen God is wanting to raise up the standard inside of us and say devil I'm not listening to you anymore the devil wants to try to break that seal if you're sealed the devil wants to break it he does look if he could talk to Jesus the way he did if if if he could do that to the Green Tree how much would he do that to the dry tree look the devil's out to destroy us and it's a real thing we just need to tell them I'm sealed to the day of redemption amen I I I'm I'm not turning back I'm going to press in all the more as I see the day approaching amen amen because that's what the word tells me to do the devil tries to get us to doubt question bring confusion unravel us but remember we're sealed that's right brother R remember we're sealed we've got to remember we're sealed we know where we stand brother bam said in the message the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals he said a seal signifies is a finished work amen a finished work and that only be done at the end time right to the day of redemption you're sealed to the day of redemption another thing is Seal signifies is ownership see the seal has a mark on it it shows ownership when you're bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything that pertained to the world you are owned by God another thing is a seal is security seal means that you are secure so we must receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost the Seal of the Holy Ghost is our token that the price has been paid we belong to God Amen we're secure now no most people accept Jesus uh Christ and what he did for them at Calvary they accept the blood because it washes away their sin and that's what every Christian Church preaches but the life that was in that blood hardly ever comes back upon the believer right because you've got to die out God is not going to come on you if you're not he's not going to share the throne room of your heart with selfishness it's like accepting the gift of God's love and sacrifice but they never want to accept the word that he spoke how can you accept Christ how can you accept Christ and not his word amen see so what they're doing is they're taking out a page of the Bible and says you know uh St John 3:16 he died for me God love me that he died for me and I accept that but there's more to it than that amen but that's why so many people believe that but their life doesn't change if the Life of Christ doesn't come upon a person he's just a beast he's just a literal Beast right remember the Old Testament they killed an animal in the Old Testament to cover their sin didn't remit them but covered them brother brandham taught us it's because the light that was in that animal could not come upon the human right amen and if Christ Spirit doesn't come upon us we're just a beast to him I think the Bible calls it brute Beast an animal life cannot come upon a a a a a self-willed human being only the life of the Holy Spirit coming into a human heart can destroy a self willed nature and you got to be in unison with god with that you've got to say God I don't want my life what I want is you am where the majority of the church world that's confused they want God but they want their will that's the confusing thing and so they look for a church that fits them well they believe the way that I believe and you don't got to do this and you don't got to do that and you can do this and you can do that in church and so they really have taken their soul which is worth 10,000 world and they put it on a roulette t a knowing the terror of the lord it's our job to persuade men most people accept the sacrifice that Christ has done for them but they never go on to apply the blood to their life amen that's it they think that God has accepted them but their nature never changes so my question is has God really accepted them I do believe this that if someone truly repents they accept Christ as their savior in two seconds later they die they're gone amen but if they God gives them more time to prove how much they're they've repented how much theyve want to turn their life around and they don't choose to walk in the light the scripture says the blood of Jesus Christ will not cleanse you that's what the Bible says when we walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all our sins so this is a real serious situation amen God requires his life to come and live back inside of us amen it's a requirement he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you and it's a requirement today when God sees the spiritual Life of Christ coming back and living inside then he will pass over us what does that mean we don't have to go through tribulation that's what that means we don't have to stand before him on the on the Judgment the token is the Life of Christ in a human being amen it's a sign that the blood has been applied to our personal life brother Braham said it this token must must be on displayed for everyone to see right and he said be sure the token is showing so this thing about being personal God knows my heart no it needs to be on display right in the message the token brother B asked the question what is a token he said the token is a sign of a debt been paid a price required has has been paid the price of our Salvation was death see and no one could pay it but Christ amen so my question to you is how do you know your debt has been paid how do you know that your personal debt has been paid the Bible I believe that with a Bible question there's got to be a Bible answer right all right the only way we can know is if the Life of Christ comes back upon us that's the only way how many believe that how many struggling with that one well remember when we accept Christ is our savior that's us our faith in God we're accepting Christ but it's not until he gives us the holy ghost that Christ has accepted us amen so am I saying that if you don't get the Holy Ghost you're going to hell that is not what I'm saying I'm saying you will stand before God in judgment after going through tribulation if your alive and you will plead your cause and you'll be between you and God at that time you'll never be able to call your best friend your best pastor your most Spirit person who spiritually counseled you to come and help you at that time it's going to be between you and God but if you want the assurance that you will make it you must receive the Life of Christ today that is the only way right in other words you've got to find his acceptance on this side of death not wait till you get on the other side and you can find it on this side when he comes and seals you with the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord in the message desperation brother Bram said the token is the token that sound sounds like something I would say he said it's you and Christ as persons together see it's the Holy Spirit the life is in you working his own life through you right that's the token he said this morning the message this morning it was called the token he's saying this in the message desperation in the evening he said was to me the Highlight message of my entire Ministry and I know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to that place that was the capping off time of it you see so I'm going to say here that whatever he's going to say has a lot of weight to it to me he says now I'm sure or hope that you got what the token meant see the token is the sign that the blood has been applied okay we I accept Jesus at Calvary okay everybody's saying that I've been born again everybody's saying that but the token is the proof that has been that you that that been applied without it you're just talking the token is a sign that the blood has been applied that the price that's been asked for required of God Jesus Paid the price by the shedding of his own blood he did that then from him from his life came the Holy Spirit and when the blood is applied to you the holy spirit is the to token that your that your price personal price is paid God has received you and that's the token yes amen so God vindicates us that we've been forgiven that we've been we've been accepted by him I love that God has given me time to seek more of him to get more of him in my life that he just didn't leave me in in a denominational Church which most of us probably were and and and with the thought process all is I got to do is accept John 3:16 and never know the person of Christ never know what he really wants out of me all right God has received you and that's the token now remember that that is the token now there is many people who doesn't they don't know what the token is see and you have to make it like nobody knows it so they all get it amen I got a lot of quotes is that okay all right praise the Lord in the message a token brother Braham says and the Holy Ghost is our identification that's right it's what identifies us as Christians not our membership in our churches not our understanding of the Bible not how much we know about the Bible it's how much you know about the author see how much the author is living in you yourself is gone you're no more you reckoned yourself dead and the token is what lives in you and it's not your life life it's him yes wow it's a lot more than just going to church couple times a week isn't it or on Sundays or once a month or what people do out there all you little people my brother sister get under the token quickly don't take no substitute don't don't don't don't do that see don't just imagine it don't stay there until you he says you stay there until you know that the token is applied right until your whole the mind that was in Christ is in you until all the nonsense Of The World Is Gone amen see until the whole heart's desire is him then you know then you know something is happening now the token is a sign that the purchase has been made and has been accepted I love that has been made and has been accepted right now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way that you're going to pay the price is pay it pay it pay it I thought I I had to do is except Calvary what he did for me if you want the token you've got to pay it you like that I like that he said that's right now he's going to explain how you pay it that's right what he said believe it accept it full obedience to the word of God will entitle you to the Token yes amen full obedience he says not part of it but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ oh I love the word and the church identification today is to manifest the promised word of this day yes amen by The Same Spirit that manifested and Quicken the word then the Same Spirit quickens the word to the Believers today and manifests the same thing showing that the to is on this person which is the resurrected life of Jesus Christ Living in his believer all that ought to set the church a fire amen he said and that's true just as true as could be oh I love it that token that's a great message you know a lot of times we when we read the message we're listening to the tapes we should really take the time to think about what's being said I know a lot of times we're we're looking for certain things things you know looking for maybe help encouragement Faith uh looking for direction in our lives looking for S but I tell you it's important to sit there and just say Lord I I need to be on the same page that you're at with me I I need to find out what you want me to do right now and I pray that you tune me into that when I put when I put the tape on or I'm reading all right now we have to identify ourselves with the sacrifice we have to identify him in his death when a Jew placed his hand upon the sacrifice he was ident he identified himself transferring the sins to that sacrifice and the sacrifice died now we place our hands by faith upon Jesus Christ and identified with him in his death not only is death but if we are accepted but if we are accepted we are identified not only in his death at Calvary right but in his resurrection by the light that was in him is sent back upon the believer as a token a memorial that his death has passed from it and God has sealed you into the kingdom until the day of your Redemption we need the Seal of the Holy Ghost amen now as always there's many things that I cannot say because we don't got time the usual but I do want to get one more quote from from this if I can in the token brother BR says I said but he gave him the Seal of circumcision as a confirmation of his faith amen and if he has never given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet he hasn't confirmed your faith that you say You have see the token is the confirmation now do you see where I was getting to when I said what I said I say I've got the money I paid it in the office down there but you've got to show the token that's right when I show the token I got a right and when I can show the token of the Holy Spirit you've got the right to purchase anything that Jesus Christ died for it's the token watch just a moment as we close hold the token over your unwavering faith in the promised word I believe that Jesus said ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it hold your token over the promised word and walk right to it I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases he was wounded for my transgressions with the stripes I am healed take my token of the Holy Spirit that's in me hold it up hold it over my prayer and say Lord God you promised it remember Standing on the Promises when I see the token I will reward you I promise to do it he can't do nothing else but he looked right through the blood of his own son there is the token applied he has to do it because he promised it let's stand together he signed your pardon with his own blood amen he sealed your life with the Holy Ghost and he promised to deliver you to your destination God is going to see you through he which be be begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen let's sing I'm going through I'm going through we we can all say this Lord I have started amen amen Lord I have started to walk in the light shining upon me from heaven so bright I've made the world and it's fies AO I've started in Jesus and I'm going through yes I'm going through I'm going through I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll way with the Lord's amen not very many through Jesus I'm going through oh there are many who start in the race but with the light they refuse to keep Pace others accept it because it is new but not very many expect to go what about you I'm going through yes I'm going through and I'll pay the price well whatever others do I'll take the way with the Lord's despise you I'm going through Jesus I'm going through I'd rather walk with Jesus alone and have for a pillow like Jacob a stone living each moment with his face in that shrink from my pathway and fail to go through oh I'm going through yes I'm going through I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll take the way with the Lord's despise you going through Jesus yes I'm going through oh brother now will you take up the cross give up the world and count it as cross sell all thou H and give to the poor then go through with Jesus and those who endure I'm going through yes I'm going through I'll pay the price whatever others do I'll take the way with the Lord's dispite I'm going through Jesus I'm going through amen I'm going through amen don't you feel that way amen let's let's go to the Lord in prayer God sees your heart sees your desires he's sees what's burning now inside your heart what's there God knows the foundation of God say sure God knoweth those that are his you belong to him it was God that inside you that Drew you to this place to the truth of his word and he is calling us to receive more of him and we've been we've been taught in the scriptures it's been hid in the scriptures but God has revealed it that the Life of Christ can come back upon us and not just change a few things in our life but change our nature so much take over our life that our will and our desire becomes his that all that we desire to do is is what he wants us to do we've we've heard from the prophet don't miss it he said don't don't don't don't don't take a substitute don't imagine it don't don't miss it lay aside everything whatever God has placed on your heart I want you to believe it as we go before him in prayer just follow his leading follow his leading Heavenly Father we come to you this evening we thank you Lord for your word and we thank you that you sent a prophet in this age to open the word to us that we might know all that you would expect of us Lord and Lord we are we're thankful that you paid the price at Calvary that there was no way that we could pay there was no man worthy and to think that before we accepted you there was no way that we could ever be saved but Lord because of you giving your life that perfect sinless life at Calvary now Lord not only our sins could be forgiven but that your spirit could come back Upon Us Lorden father each one of us that are here and those that are on the live stream those that couldn't make it Lord your Prophet taught us that even justification is a work of the Holy Spirit and all of us have a portion of you Lord there are some here that have been sealed with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah there are some here that have been Justified and I praise you for it Lord there are some here that have been Sanctified there's some here that that have had the Holy Ghost on on them around them but Lord today Lord we want all that you have for us Lord I humbly pray that you would seal everyone that's not sealed Grant it Heavenly Father Lord may it be the very longing desire of each one to press towards the Seal of the Holy Ghost as we know Lord that your coming is nigh the world has fallen apart Lord and we need all that we that you have for us in order to make the Rapture so I pray Lord I pray that you would seal each and everyone and father those that you have sealed I pray Lord this message Lord would in increase their faith to take a stand when the enemy would try to come in and discourage them in any way try to steal their Joys try to steal their peace God may they remember that they've been sealed with the Holy Ghost and take a stand against the enemy Lord you inside of us as a majority father we
