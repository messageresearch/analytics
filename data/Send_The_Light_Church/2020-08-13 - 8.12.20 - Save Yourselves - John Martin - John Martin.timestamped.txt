[33:14] been in our heart
[33:16] through the day and before the service
[33:19] lord asking that you would intervene and
[33:22] uh and lord that you would move into
[33:25] behalf of those needs as well for your
[33:28] god that can do
[33:29] exceedingly above all that we would ask
[33:31] or even think

[33:53] give you the praise for these things
[33:54] lord
[33:55] in jesus name we ask amen
[33:58] amen turn with me if you would to the
[34:01] book of acts
[34:02] chapter 2 what um
[34:06] provoked the service today is we had a
[34:10] brother approach us last service um
[34:13] about wanting to be baptized
[34:17] and there's uh on a a few others in the
[34:22] church
[34:22] that need to be baptized and
[34:27] but this service i want to make it real
[34:30] clear
[34:31] is for everybody in here
[34:35] so that's i'm just letting you know
[34:37] where where it started from
[34:40] and we want to go through uh some
[34:43] scriptures here
[34:44] that talk uh that guide us into baptism
[34:48] it's something that we want to
[34:51] walk forward in amen amen starting in
[34:55] acts chapter 2 and num and verse number
[34:59] 37
[35:01] the question was asked how do we be
[35:04] saved
[35:04] now when they heard this they were
[35:07] pricked in their heart
[35:09] and said unto peter and to the rest of
[35:11] the apostles
[35:12] men and brother what shall we do
[35:16] and then peter said unto them repent
[35:19] and be baptized every one of you
[35:22] in the name of jesus christ for the
[35:25] remission
[35:26] of sins and ye shall
[35:30] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[35:33] for the promise is unto you and to your
[35:36] children
[35:38] and to all that are far off even as many
[35:41] as the lord our god shall call
[35:43] and with many other words did he testify
[35:46] and exhort saying save yourselves from
[35:49] this onto a generation
[35:51] and then they that gladly received the
[35:53] word were baptized
[35:55] the same day were added unto them about
[35:57] 3 000
[35:58] souls and they commune steadfastly in
[36:02] the apostles doctrine
[36:04] and fellowship and in the breaking of
[36:06] the bread
[36:07] and in prayers amen god bless you may be
[36:12] seated
[36:17] i'm sorry i did not get a request in
[36:21] before service but if we could remember
[36:24] to continue to pray for brother daryl
[36:25] ward
[36:27] and then also for brother donnie reagan
[36:29] and his family they have
[36:30] also caught the culvert and
[36:35] there there is a very great need
[36:39] with his daughter and
[36:42] that the family there and if we could
[36:44] just remember
[36:45] brother donnie the church and his his
[36:48] his daughter and their
[36:50] her family um they've stopped having
[36:53] services um nothing
[36:57] live streaming or anything and so i know
[37:00] they're they're going
[37:01] we've heard they're going through some
[37:02] trials so if we could remember
[37:04] to pray for our precious brother amen
[37:09] um we want to entitle this message save
[37:12] yourselves save
[37:15] yourselves and for a subject
[37:19] playing your part we have a part to play
[37:23] with
[37:23] with salvation so
[37:27] god does not cast a magic wand over and
[37:31] decide who he's going to save and who
[37:33] he's not going to save
[37:36] it isn't god uh
[37:39] making all the choices
[37:43] you've got to save yourself i mean this
[37:46] is what the scripture
[37:47] said with many other words that he
[37:49] testify exhorting
[37:51] saying save yourselves many
[37:54] other words they testify and exhort
[37:56] saying save
[37:58] your cells
[38:02] so somewhere down the line we have a
[38:04] part to play
[38:05] in salvation amen
[38:08] and it was an on toward generation at
[38:12] that time and that means
[38:14] warped or perverse or or crooked world
[38:16] and today
[38:18] it is worse than ever amen
[38:21] and we need to save ourselves today we
[38:24] don't want to wait
[38:25] around waiting for somebody else to save
[38:28] us
[38:30] we've got to take charge of it just like
[38:33] your health we've heard that
[38:34] you don't want to put your health in
[38:36] some doctor's hands
[38:37] who's taking care of a lot of patients
[38:39] who doesn't got a lot of time
[38:41] and you can't give you the the the
[38:43] personal private attention that you need
[38:45] all the time and so you must take
[38:47] your health into your hands
[38:51] it's true the doctor just can't give you
[38:53] enough time to take care of what your
[38:55] needs are
[38:56] you need to go see another doctor you
[38:57] need to get some you need to get a
[38:59] second opinion sometimes you you need to
[39:01] see a specialist and
[39:02] so you need to take your health into
[39:04] your own hands
[39:06] brother says if you're not going to
[39:07] listen to the doctor don't go
[39:09] right right so i say it's the same way
[39:12] with your salvation right
[39:13] amen that's why brother bran was so
[39:16] it was so important to get the point
[39:19] across that we need
[39:20] when we're choosing a church we we can't
[39:22] choose a church just like we would
[39:24] choose what we'd want to choose for our
[39:26] life
[39:30] can i word it like that so i don't work
[39:32] the other way you know what i'm trying
[39:33] to say
[39:35] so we we because the church
[39:39] that is what leads our soul in the
[39:42] direction that god wants it to be
[39:44] and there's so many churches out there
[39:46] that leaden have
[39:47] so many mixed motives
[39:52] and to find we know that jesus he's
[39:56] interested in our soul amen
[39:59] he has no ulterior motives amen he's not
[40:02] wanting to mix
[40:04] anything in with it right but when
[40:06] churches
[40:07] are worried about other things
[40:11] and we want a church that puts
[40:14] not just the priority but but
[40:17] only our our character and our soul
[40:20] being built to the place that we can
[40:22] make a rapture
[40:23] that's all that matters everything else
[40:26] is going to be vain
[40:29] amen so don't let anybody tell you
[40:34] that you don't have anything to do with
[40:36] salvation
[40:39] if you think that so much this
[40:42] predestination so much you won't lift a
[40:45] finger to do anything for you
[40:47] to help yourself the bible says save
[40:51] yourselves for brother john i was always
[40:55] told
[40:56] that i was saved by the grace of god
[40:59] let's go to the scriptures ephesians
[41:00] chapter 2 verse 7.
[41:03] we want to make sure we got a right
[41:05] balance in the sermon
[41:08] ephesians chapter 2 verse 7 that in the
[41:10] ages to come
[41:12] he might show the exceeding riches of
[41:15] his grace
[41:16] in his kindness towards us
[41:20] through christ jesus how many has felt
[41:22] the kindness
[41:23] of the lord jesus amen
[41:27] for by grace are you saved
[41:31] it's through faith and that not
[41:35] of yourselves it is the gift of god
[41:39] amen not of works lest any man should
[41:42] most
[41:43] for we are his workmanship
[41:47] created in christ jesus on two good
[41:49] works
[41:50] which god hath before ordained that we
[41:53] should walk
[41:54] in them that's right so it is god's
[41:58] grace that saves us amen
[42:02] and we are his workmanship
[42:05] he's in control
[42:10] but if we don't have anything to do with
[42:12] it then all he's got is a
[42:14] bunch of robots for a relationship with
[42:17] us
[42:19] you cannot save yourself without god
[42:23] right and god cannot save you without
[42:27] yourself
[42:29] you play a part god plays a part amen
[42:32] i want to talk about god's part god
[42:35] recognizes you
[42:39] he recognized you when you are horribly
[42:42] selfish
[42:45] a sinner didn't care about god
[42:49] you were hell bound
[42:53] and there was nothing that you could do
[42:56] to even help yourself because you were
[42:58] blind to your condition amen you thought
[43:02] you were
[43:03] pretty good you didn't need any help
[43:06] thank you
[43:09] but then jesus he come knocking on the
[43:11] door
[43:12] amen and he helped you
[43:15] to see your condition
[43:19] he declared on to you that he was the
[43:22] only way to eternal life
[43:24] there was no other way to make it
[43:28] and the thing is you didn't have one
[43:31] thing to do
[43:32] when god came to you he chose
[43:37] to meet you he chose to knock
[43:40] on your heart amen so that is grace
[43:44] that is grace
[43:45] [Music]
[43:48] he went to the cross before you were
[43:52] even born right
[43:53] amen to pay the price that you would
[43:56] have
[43:57] a chance to receive eternal life to have
[44:02] your sins washed away
[44:03] amen that is the grace of god that's why
[44:06] it's not of yourselves
[44:08] it is the gift of god not
[44:11] of works you can't even you can't attain
[44:14] to some sort of merit of having it
[44:17] through doing anything it is
[44:19] truly the grace of god
[44:22] you couldn't earn god's goodness or his
[44:25] favor
[44:29] amen amen isn't even aware
[44:33] of god until god begins to deal with
[44:36] your heart
[44:37] now you that have just been coming to
[44:40] the church not for very long
[44:44] and something is beginning to take place
[44:48] in your heart i just want to make this
[44:49] real clear that
[44:51] is god when we need to
[44:54] to recognize that this is god this is
[44:57] the way that god deals with us how he
[44:59] speaks to our heart
[45:01] in john chapter 6 verse 44
[45:05] the bible says jesus said no man
[45:09] can come to me except the father
[45:12] which have sent me draw him and i will
[45:15] raise them up the last day
[45:17] so we can't even come to god unless he
[45:20] draws us first
[45:22] so he begins to speak to our heart he he
[45:25] he puts a little tug in there a little
[45:28] nudge in there and and we we get our
[45:30] attention we begin to listen a little
[45:32] bit more at church and
[45:34] that is god drawing us to heal amen
[45:39] verse 65 the same chapter and then he
[45:42] said
[45:44] therefore said i unto you that no man
[45:46] can come unto me
[45:48] except that we're given unto him of my
[45:50] father
[45:52] so god's grace this is his part
[45:56] he draws us to him amen
[45:59] and and we we can't be saved without
[46:01] that part
[46:02] but we need to respond to that part
[46:06] so we don't do the choosing
[46:09] god chooses us amen it is his grace
[46:13] alone that chooses us
[46:16] it is not of ourselves it is the gift of
[46:19] god right
[46:20] god is the great master builder he's
[46:23] orchestrating this whole thing
[46:24] amen before i i knew god before i knew
[46:28] brother
[46:29] bruce i was doing my thing but god knew
[46:32] today would happen
[46:34] amen many years afterwards he's the
[46:37] master build he's
[46:38] he's he's got a big plan involved he
[46:41] says i know
[46:43] i know the thoughts i think towards you
[46:46] saith the lord thoughts of peace
[46:48] to give you an expected in to finish the
[46:51] work that he started he's
[46:53] building a church inside of each one of
[46:55] us
[46:59] ephesians chapter 2 verse 7 says that
[47:02] in the ages to come that's these ages
[47:05] this is this age
[47:07] 2020 here at sun delight he might show
[47:10] the exceeding riches of his
[47:13] his grace in his kindness towards us
[47:17] through christ jesus
[47:18] his grace is amongst us praise god his
[47:21] kindness is amongst us god has showed
[47:25] his kindness to us he has saved us
[47:27] through jesus christ
[47:29] acts chapter 4 verse 12 says neither is
[47:32] there salvation
[47:33] in any other for there is none other
[47:36] name under heaven given among men
[47:38] whereby we must be saved amen
[47:41] praise the lord praise the lord
[47:44] this is the part that god plays
[47:48] where you don't have one thing to do
[47:50] about this choice
[47:52] he knocks on your heart or you might got
[47:55] invited to church
[47:56] you might have got invited to to
[47:59] to to to to some bible study to
[48:02] to do some reading
[48:06] but it really it was god
[48:09] who is orchestrating you to be
[48:12] introduced to him
[48:13] amen amen see see god
[48:16] god can just speak to you when you're
[48:18] sleeping when you're laying down
[48:20] he can he you can sit there and look at
[48:23] the mountains look at the
[48:24] the waves and and begin to think about
[48:27] god that god chose the foolishness of
[48:29] preaching
[48:30] god chose man to bring the gospel
[48:32] because man brought the gospel to me
[48:38] and that's how it works isn't that
[48:41] beautiful
[48:43] i mean it it took humans to bring forth
[48:46] our children
[48:47] took a union to bring four children
[48:50] and when god unites in your heart as
[48:54] brother bran says if
[48:55] if god lights your candle yes
[48:58] you're obligated to go like somebody
[49:00] else's
[49:04] now just because he chose you
[49:08] chose to love you while you were yet a
[49:10] sinner
[49:13] that doesn't mean you're automatically
[49:14] saved
[49:16] no sir you have a part to play in the
[49:19] salvation
[49:20] army amen and if you don't play your
[49:23] part you won't be saved
[49:25] amen and that's why
[49:28] peter said save yourselves
[49:33] play your part we've got a part to play
[49:37] to save ourself
[49:38] as soon as you feel or you recognize the
[49:42] tug in your heart
[49:43] you've got to respond back and do
[49:45] something
[49:47] you cannot sit there you cannot just
[49:51] do nothing about it right you've got to
[49:54] do something about you can't ignore it
[49:57] that is god tugging
[49:58] on you he put that there he's calling
[50:00] you he's dealing with you
[50:02] amen now the first thing you have to do
[50:05] when you
[50:05] feel that to save yourself
[50:09] is you have to believe amen you have to
[50:12] believe that this is not just me
[50:14] or my thoughts this is just you know
[50:16] some feeling this is just something uh
[50:18] the teacher's teaching me no you've got
[50:21] to believe that this is god dealing with
[50:23] you inside
[50:24] he that cometh to god must first believe
[50:27] you've got to believe
[50:29] it's god it starts with believing
[50:32] and then we've got to believe the gospel
[50:35] from cover to cover amen
[50:38] i believe hebrews chapter 11 verse 6
[50:42] says but without faith it's impossible
[50:46] to please him
[50:47] for he that cometh to god must believe
[50:49] that he is and that he's a rewarder of
[50:51] them that diligently seek him amen
[50:54] believe what he's speaking to your heart
[50:56] now what he's speaking
[50:57] on your heart is not what he's speaking
[51:01] on everybody else's heart right because
[51:03] god's dealing with us
[51:05] with issues and things in our life he
[51:07] knows what we need
[51:08] amen the same
[51:11] word can be preached over the pulpit and
[51:14] dealt with all of our hearts
[51:15] just slightly differently
[51:21] first thing we have to do to save
[51:23] ourselves is believe
[51:26] we don't have to understand the gospel
[51:28] we don't have to memorize the gospel
[51:31] we don't have to quote it recite it we
[51:33] just have to believe it
[51:35] amen say amen to the word of god
[51:38] it's for me i i receive that word amen
[51:42] when god draws a man to be saved
[51:45] the man must come to the understanding
[51:48] that he is lost
[51:50] without him that's the first thing
[51:52] that's got to happen
[51:55] amen the lord creates
[52:00] the reality we're born in
[52:03] shape and and we think we're something
[52:07] every man's right in his own eyes
[52:10] comparing yourself with others that are
[52:12] worse to make you feel better
[52:18] but god has to take the blindness off of
[52:20] us open our eyes to the light
[52:23] the light not that not that
[52:27] just jesus is the truth
[52:31] not just that so we can sit in church
[52:34] and say
[52:35] yes jesus is the truth but we've got to
[52:38] come to the light
[52:39] of how dark we are how evil we are how
[52:42] wrong we are amen i
[52:53] yes we've got the wrong birth yes we
[52:55] were born in sin
[52:56] shape and iniquity
[53:00] that happened to me and i didn't think i
[53:02] was a bad person for the longest time in
[53:04] my life
[53:05] my parents told me i was a nice kid the
[53:08] neighbors the relatives my cousins
[53:14] my grandma called me a snake in the
[53:15] grass because i was growing marijuana
[53:18] under her nose with her plants under the
[53:20] lamp
[53:22] but other than that most of people
[53:23] thought i was pretty decent
[53:28] you know she was just one out of many
[53:31] she was more accurate than the rest of
[53:33] them
[53:41] we've got to come to the understanding
[53:43] of our awful condition
[53:45] amen amen every
[53:48] man and woman is born with an evil
[53:52] nature
[53:53] amen romans chapter 1 verse 18 for the
[53:56] wrath
[53:57] of god is revealed
[54:01] from heaven against all ungodliness
[54:05] and unrighteousness of men
[54:09] the wrath of god
[54:12] no one is going to be saved without
[54:15] being born again
[54:17] amen
[54:20] that's just not going to happen romans
[54:23] chapter 3 verse 10
[54:24] as it is written there is none righteous
[54:28] no not one amen
[54:32] there is none that understands there is
[54:33] none that seeketh after god
[54:36] i wasn't seeking after god when i was
[54:38] asked to go to church i thought i didn't
[54:39] want to go
[54:41] right i did it it was
[54:44] boring i i didn't feel close i didn't
[54:49] see god
[54:49] and i saw a church full of hypocrites
[54:56] because i was there with a judgmental
[54:59] attitude see
[55:02] like why would they ask me to go and do
[55:05] something
[55:05] when they're not doing it
[55:10] there is none that seeketh after god
[55:15] they're all gone out of the way they are
[55:17] all
[55:18] together become unprofitable there is
[55:21] none that doeth good
[55:23] no not one amen
[55:26] that's where god has to bring every
[55:29] sinner
[55:30] to that place to recognize this
[55:34] otherwise he doesn't know what to repent
[55:36] of right
[55:39] i i can't repent for you you cannot
[55:42] repent for me
[55:47] so i've got to see my sin you've got to
[55:49] see your sin right
[55:50] amen i can't save you and you can't save
[55:55] me
[55:56] we've got to save ourselves
[55:57] [Applause]
[56:00] when god calls a man to be saved the man
[56:03] must come to the understanding that he's
[56:05] a sinner
[56:08] so he can repent of his sinful condition
[56:12] we've got to believe jesus is calling us
[56:15] to repentance
[56:18] that's the call right because it's the
[56:21] first step
[56:23] now there's we know that jesus told us
[56:25] many parables and things in the bible
[56:27] where people try to get into heaven
[56:31] another way right amen without
[56:33] repentance
[56:36] and works don't save you
[56:41] we need to repent of our sins jesus said
[56:44] in
[56:44] john 8 24 for if ye believe not that i
[56:48] am he ye shall die in your sins
[56:52] now he was talking to the most religious
[56:54] people that day
[56:56] amen
[56:59] and what about us right i know i was
[57:04] i think i was talking to brother stan
[57:06] brother stan so good to see you today in
[57:07] the house of the lord
[57:09] he's talking do we do we have time to
[57:11] put up a picture
[57:15] this is brother stan we were loading the
[57:18] wood today
[57:19] for the new church praise god brother
[57:21] stan's i want to give him a hand clap
[57:24] for all he's doing for the lord
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:27] yeah he didn't know i took that picture
[57:29] [Laughter]
[57:32] and i don't know where i was before i
[57:34] started talking about that but
[57:38] we before we came to the lord we were
[57:40] not
[57:41] monks and priests that's what was that's
[57:43] why i thought he we
[57:45] brother brother uh stan said well it'd
[57:48] be hard to be a monk
[57:50] today and i said i don't really believe
[57:54] god has called us to be monks
[57:58] i think that is a man-made effort god
[58:00] wants us to be out there
[58:02] living the life with other people so
[58:04] they can see christ
[58:12] jesus was god manifested in the flesh
[58:17] saint john chapter 14 verse 6 i am the
[58:20] way
[58:21] the truth and the life no man cometh
[58:24] unto the father
[58:25] but by me we have to come
[58:29] through jesus jesus paid the price for
[58:32] god so loved the world that he gave his
[58:34] only begotten son whosoever believeth in
[58:37] should not perish but have a
[58:39] everlasting life god
[58:42] showed us his amazing grace
[58:46] at calvary now it's up to us
[58:51] to do our part to accept that grace
[58:55] and to follow what jesus told us to do
[59:01] you cannot sit around
[59:06] what is laodicean doing
[59:09] sitting around they're not on fire
[59:12] they're lukewarm
[59:16] we've got to believe as the scriptures
[59:19] teach
[59:19] us to believe in other words our belief
[59:23] can't be of any private interpretation
[59:25] well this is what i think
[59:28] do not say this is what i think
[59:31] i want to find out what the scriptures
[59:33] got to say about it
[59:35] because it's got to line up with the
[59:37] gospel amen
[59:38] we can't just believe with a mental
[59:40] faith and intellectual
[59:42] faith we've it's it's not a book of
[59:45] knowledge and facts
[59:48] it's the word of life amen and and we've
[59:52] got to believe it with our heart
[59:55] james chapter 2 verse 19.
[59:58] how many believes that there's only one
[1:00:01] god let me see your hands
[1:00:03] i want you to understand you believe as
[1:00:05] much as the devil believes today
[1:00:09] now believe is that there is one god
[1:00:11] thou doest
[1:00:12] well right the devils also believe
[1:00:16] and they tremble right because there's a
[1:00:20] they know there's a realness to god
[1:00:24] but will thou know
[1:00:27] o vain man that faith without works
[1:00:32] is dead yes so you know we see the point
[1:00:35] that we're not
[1:00:36] saved by works
[1:00:39] of all works but us responding to the
[1:00:44] call of god
[1:00:46] you can't just say i believe and do
[1:00:48] nothing and sit there
[1:00:50] you've got to respond with works
[1:00:56] amen if you say that you're a believer
[1:00:59] but your life has no works then your
[1:01:01] faith or your belief
[1:01:03] is dead it's considered
[1:01:06] all in vain and you should bury it
[1:01:11] james chapter 2 verse 26 for as the body
[1:01:14] without the spirit is dead
[1:01:16] so your faith without works
[1:01:20] is dead also
[1:01:25] verse 18 james said i
[1:01:28] will show thee my faith by
[1:01:32] my works yes praise the lord r
[1:01:38] got to work out our own salvation amen
[1:01:42] we've got to save ourselves we show our
[1:01:46] faith in the gospel by following through
[1:01:48] what god requires of us
[1:01:50] to save ourselves there would be no
[1:01:54] reason
[1:01:55] for me to ever get baptized if i don't
[1:01:58] repent
[1:02:02] there'd be no reason for me to ever go
[1:02:05] and seek the holy ghost
[1:02:06] if i haven't repented god just won't do
[1:02:09] that
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:11] so we we we've got to put the right
[1:02:14] steps first
[1:02:18] repent or perish that's a choice
[1:02:23] we've got to make that choice we can't
[1:02:26] sit there
[1:02:27] and not make the choice
[1:02:30] joshua chapter 24 verse 15.
[1:02:34] and if it seems evil unto you
[1:02:37] think about this personally you that
[1:02:40] battle
[1:02:41] jumping in wherever you're at
[1:02:46] on the spectrum that you are with the
[1:02:47] lord it doesn't matter how long you've
[1:02:50] been serving the lord here
[1:02:52] if it seem evil unto you
[1:02:56] to serve the lord choose you this day
[1:03:00] whom you will serve
[1:03:03] every time god comes every every time
[1:03:06] god presents to us the word
[1:03:08] he's expecting us to make a choice
[1:03:13] either serve that word that he gave us
[1:03:18] or if it seemed evil in your sight or
[1:03:21] not necessary
[1:03:23] come on amen choose you this day whom
[1:03:27] you will serve whether the gods of you
[1:03:29] which your father served and i know the
[1:03:31] gods that my father served
[1:03:35] i mean they are
[1:03:40] don't say it john we all we all know
[1:03:42] about your dad
[1:03:46] which your father served that were on
[1:03:48] the other side of the flood or the gods
[1:03:50] of the amorites
[1:03:52] in whose land you dwell but as for me
[1:03:56] and my house we will serve the lord
[1:04:00] now this is the choice that we make
[1:04:03] praise god
[1:04:04] to save ourselves right amen
[1:04:07] we've got to serve the lord in our homes
[1:04:10] we've got to serve the lord with our
[1:04:12] lives
[1:04:13] it isn't we serve the lord at church
[1:04:17] the church is where we we get the word
[1:04:20] we take this word
[1:04:21] and we take it home when you
[1:04:26] choose to repent from serving the gods
[1:04:29] of this world you're choosing
[1:04:32] to save yourself
[1:04:36] you're choosing to follow jesus christ
[1:04:39] the truth
[1:04:40] the way the life now we can't say
[1:04:44] we believe and never repent
[1:04:50] you've got to repent romans chapter 10
[1:04:53] verse 13 for whosoever shall call upon
[1:04:56] the name of the lord
[1:04:58] shall be saved amen you got to call in
[1:05:01] the name of the lord there's
[1:05:03] your part to play to save yourself is
[1:05:06] call on the lord that you can't do that
[1:05:08] if he never called you
[1:05:10] there was a time in my life that i was
[1:05:12] doing everything that you can imagine
[1:05:16] and i was still going to a
[1:05:17] denominational church
[1:05:22] it was just the thing to do you just go
[1:05:23] to church it was church time you went to
[1:05:25] church
[1:05:27] that was it but when god began to knock
[1:05:30] on my heart
[1:05:32] said you're going to hell if you
[1:05:36] don't get saved right that was that real
[1:05:38] to me
[1:05:39] amen and i had to make a choice
[1:05:43] amen and i began to call on the name of
[1:05:46] the lord
[1:05:48] and you can do it without your voice
[1:05:52] you can do it without a church altar
[1:05:55] right now
[1:05:56] but you need to do it amen you need to
[1:05:59] call on the lord
[1:06:00] amen if you don't call in the name of
[1:06:03] the lord he ain't going to come
[1:06:04] he's a gentleman he'll let you sit there
[1:06:08] all your life
[1:06:09] yes right
[1:06:12] right right inside of a church
[1:06:16] we've heard so many stories about it
[1:06:20] we've got to save ourselves second
[1:06:22] corinthians chapter 5 verse 10
[1:06:25] for we must all appear before the
[1:06:28] judgment seat of christ
[1:06:30] that everyone may receive of the things
[1:06:33] done in his body according to what you
[1:06:35] have done whether it be good
[1:06:36] or bad verse 11
[1:06:40] knowing therefore the terror of the lord
[1:06:44] we persuade you amen we persuade you
[1:06:51] and as though god did beseech you by us
[1:06:55] i pray you in christ
[1:06:57] stead be reconciled to god
[1:07:02] now this is what god is calling every
[1:07:04] one of us to do is to be reconciled
[1:07:08] well brother john man i repent i got
[1:07:11] baptized so long ago
[1:07:17] are you telling me that you're perfected
[1:07:21] then there is some reconciling to do
[1:07:23] with your savior
[1:07:25] with your husband amen
[1:07:31] that's why this message is for everybody
[1:07:35] save yourselves from this entre
[1:07:37] generation
[1:07:39] repent and be reconciled but we don't
[1:07:42] want to stop with repentance
[1:07:47] we want to move on to baptism
[1:07:50] that's the next step right repent and be
[1:07:53] baptized
[1:07:54] every one of you for the remission of
[1:07:57] sins it is a
[1:08:01] part of obedience
[1:08:04] baptism is a part of obedience to save
[1:08:07] yourself
[1:08:09] your faith in god will always lead you
[1:08:12] to obeying more of the gospel
[1:08:14] right amen if you have true faith it
[1:08:17] will always lead you
[1:08:18] to obey more you know really backsliding
[1:08:25] is not moving forward
[1:08:29] in the sight of god it is
[1:08:32] eventually you will be going backwards
[1:08:37] and you want the thing about it is
[1:08:38] you'll never know it right
[1:08:40] you'll never know it until it's too late
[1:08:43] all of a sudden you're saying well i
[1:08:45] haven't had joy in so long
[1:08:46] why it was so hard for me to forgive
[1:08:48] that person
[1:08:51] how come i just wasn't patient with him
[1:08:54] where did all the fruits go
[1:08:58] and we didn't even realize it
[1:09:02] jesus said in mark 16 16
[1:09:05] he that believeth and is baptized
[1:09:09] shall be saved
[1:09:14] but he that believeth not right
[1:09:17] shall be damned
[1:09:20] we have to move forward amen we have to
[1:09:24] save ourselves
[1:09:25] nobody's going to baptize us let me just
[1:09:27] say something here
[1:09:30] if you think god would put his trust
[1:09:34] in all the human race that they would
[1:09:36] all baptize their children
[1:09:41] in order to be saved
[1:09:45] god wouldn't do something so foolish as
[1:09:46] that
[1:09:51] you've got to save yourself not your
[1:09:52] parents
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] our parents can't baptize us the priest
[1:10:00] can't baptize us
[1:10:02] the pastor can't baptize a child
[1:10:08] he doesn't even know how to believe
[1:10:10] doesn't even know
[1:10:11] about his sins
[1:10:15] i remember one time james
[1:10:18] forgive me for talking about this
[1:10:22] one time we went to savannah and we had
[1:10:24] two condos and the kids stayed in one we
[1:10:26] stayed in the other
[1:10:30] and uh well some of the kids stayed with
[1:10:32] us we couldn't fit them all in one condo
[1:10:34] you know and uh so
[1:10:37] somebody got into the donuts
[1:10:43] and no one was confessing
[1:10:47] to who bit the donut
[1:10:52] and so he took that donut brother
[1:10:55] she like donuts are here
[1:10:58] they took that donut and they had
[1:11:00] everybody take a bite
[1:11:02] of a donut so i could remember
[1:11:09] and even after proving
[1:11:12] who bit the donut there still was no
[1:11:16] confession
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:21] you have to confess
[1:11:26] you have to confess you can't move
[1:11:27] forward amen
[1:11:31] i'm a sinner amen i want to be saved
[1:11:34] amen you know
[1:11:37] there i am in no wise any better than
[1:11:40] any one person in this
[1:11:42] church at this moment
[1:11:46] i'm a sinner saved by grace
[1:11:54] i'm not saved yet repent be baptized
[1:11:58] the promise is unto you amen
[1:12:02] amen now i'll just talk about baptism
[1:12:05] for a moment there are two
[1:12:06] baptisms that we read about in our
[1:12:08] opening scripture
[1:12:10] the first is water baptism and the
[1:12:13] second is
[1:12:14] spiritual baptism both are
[1:12:17] required of the believer
[1:12:20] amen to water baptism is the part that
[1:12:23] you play
[1:12:24] to save yourself water baptism is not
[1:12:28] some church ritual
[1:12:32] it is the beginning of you working out
[1:12:35] your salvation with fear and trembling
[1:12:38] after you repent you need to get
[1:12:40] baptized
[1:12:43] water baptism is one of the keys that
[1:12:46] peter
[1:12:46] gave us on the day of pentecost
[1:12:49] he later explained in his letter
[1:12:54] of first peter chapter 3 when once the
[1:12:56] long-suffering
[1:12:57] of god waited in the days of noah
[1:13:01] while the ark was preparing were in few
[1:13:03] that his eight souls
[1:13:05] were saved by water now verse 21 of
[1:13:08] first peter chapter 3 says
[1:13:11] the light figure
[1:13:15] where unto even baptism does
[1:13:19] also now save us
[1:13:25] save yourself not the putting away
[1:13:29] of the filth of the flesh but the answer
[1:13:33] of a good conscious towards god
[1:13:36] by the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:13:38] water baptism
[1:13:39] doesn't put away the filth of our flesh
[1:13:44] only the blood of calvary can do that
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:49] the holy spirit is the only thing that
[1:13:51] can purge us
[1:13:54] and take away our sin and sanctify us
[1:13:57] it's through calvary where the sacrifice
[1:14:01] of your your personal sins
[1:14:05] were paid your sins were paid there
[1:14:09] not just everybody else's
[1:14:13] and to know that yours were paid there
[1:14:16] that's awesome jesus died for you
[1:14:20] he died to take your sins and put them
[1:14:22] in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:14:26] amen now this process of sanctification
[1:14:30] can take a long time
[1:14:34] it it all depends on how honestly
[1:14:38] how serious you are with god amen you've
[1:14:40] got to work out your
[1:14:42] own salvation with fear and trembling
[1:14:44] and i'll say it like this
[1:14:45] the more fear and trembling you have the
[1:14:48] quicker you're going to get it
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:51] and the more you think well i've
[1:14:53] repented i got baptized i'm here i'm
[1:14:55] just going to i do this and i do that
[1:14:58] then
[1:14:58] if there's no fear if there's no
[1:15:00] trembling when you come into god's house
[1:15:06] how can god deal with you we come here
[1:15:09] to find out what we're out with god but
[1:15:11] if you don't
[1:15:11] have that fear that reverend said lord i
[1:15:14] just want to be pleasing to you
[1:15:16] [Music]
[1:15:18] water baptism is the answer
[1:15:22] that we're looking for in our heart to
[1:15:25] be
[1:15:26] right with god
[1:15:29] it's an outward expression that you do
[1:15:33] in front of everybody
[1:15:36] that really expresses an inward
[1:15:40] work of faith in your heart
[1:15:44] something is happening here i want to
[1:15:46] express it out here
[1:15:49] and it's when a baptism is something
[1:15:52] that can
[1:15:53] help you look back to it any time in
[1:15:56] your walk with the lord when the
[1:15:58] when the enemy would try to come and hit
[1:16:00] you over the head
[1:16:01] and beat you up and and tell you you
[1:16:04] really aren't a christian
[1:16:05] you just look back and i made a decision
[1:16:08] there
[1:16:09] and i repented and got baptized in the
[1:16:11] name of jesus christ and i'm moving
[1:16:13] forward
[1:16:17] it's a it's where you took a turn
[1:16:21] in your life you turned around
[1:16:26] acts chapter 2 verse 37 now when the men
[1:16:29] heard the gospel preached they were
[1:16:32] pricked in their hearts and they said
[1:16:34] unto peter and the rest of the apostles
[1:16:36] men and brethren
[1:16:37] what shall we do to be saved yes
[1:16:41] peter is saying if you really want to be
[1:16:44] if you really want to save your souls
[1:16:46] from going to hell
[1:16:47] then you need to repent amen you need to
[1:16:50] get baptized
[1:16:52] every single one of you i don't care
[1:16:55] how religious you are nicodemus
[1:17:00] unless you're born again you're not
[1:17:02] going to make it amen
[1:17:04] amen
[1:17:08] and we get baptized we repent
[1:17:12] and get baptized for the remission of
[1:17:15] sins
[1:17:18] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:17:20] holy ghost
[1:17:21] jesus said in revelations chapter 1
[1:17:23] verse 18 he says
[1:17:25] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:17:27] behold i am alive forevermore
[1:17:29] amen and have the keys of hell
[1:17:32] and of death
[1:17:35] but jesus placed those keys in peter's
[1:17:39] heart on the day of pentecost
[1:17:42] matthew chapter 16 verse 17 and jesus
[1:17:45] answered and said unto
[1:17:47] peter blessed art thou simon by jonah
[1:17:49] for flesh and blood have not revealed
[1:17:51] it unto thee but my father which is in
[1:17:53] heaven and i say unto thee that thou art
[1:17:56] peter and upon this rock i'll build my
[1:17:57] church and the gates of hell
[1:17:59] shall not prevail against it and i will
[1:18:02] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[1:18:05] of heaven
[1:18:06] and whatsoever thou bind on earth shall
[1:18:09] be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt
[1:18:10] loose on her shall be loosed in heaven
[1:18:12] right amen and peter took the keys that
[1:18:17] god gave him the inspiration
[1:18:19] came at that moment
[1:18:23] i don't think he had it when he went
[1:18:24] into the upper room
[1:18:28] but inspiration hit him and when the
[1:18:30] time came and somebody wanted to know
[1:18:32] what to do to be saved
[1:18:34] peter was right there saying what you
[1:18:36] need to do is repent of your sins
[1:18:38] get baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:18:41] the titles won't work and you shall
[1:18:44] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:18:50] we must be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:18:53] christ amen there's no
[1:18:55] other name given among men whereby we
[1:18:58] must be saved
[1:18:59] amen amen that's right
[1:19:04] acts chapter 2 verse 39 the promise
[1:19:08] of the second baptism we talked about
[1:19:10] the first the water baptism
[1:19:12] and now the second baptism for the
[1:19:14] promise
[1:19:15] of the holy spirit which is god living
[1:19:18] inside of you
[1:19:19] yes amen promise is unto you
[1:19:23] and to your children the whole family
[1:19:26] amen and and to all that are false even
[1:19:30] as many
[1:19:31] as the lord our god shall
[1:19:34] call
[1:19:38] now we got a lot better chance of our
[1:19:41] loved ones
[1:19:42] feeling the call
[1:19:46] if we're living the life
[1:19:50] that the more that jesus can shine out
[1:19:54] of you
[1:19:55] the more people are going to be thinking
[1:19:56] about jesus
[1:19:59] the more you keep them kind of tucked
[1:20:00] inside
[1:20:02] in a ziploc in the
[1:20:06] tupperware
[1:20:12] the more they're going to see you amen
[1:20:16] i know you if you're like me
[1:20:20] at your very best it's all vanity right
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:27] john chapter 7 verse 37 in the last day
[1:20:31] that great day of the feast jesus stood
[1:20:34] and cried saying
[1:20:35] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[1:20:39] and drink
[1:20:40] amen and he that believeth on me as the
[1:20:42] scripture have said
[1:20:44] out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:20:47] of living water this is this is
[1:20:51] the promise of the holy spirit just
[1:20:54] bubbling out
[1:20:55] enjoy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:21:00] this spake he of the spirit
[1:21:03] which they that believe
[1:21:06] they that believe on him should receive
[1:21:10] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:21:12] because jesus
[1:21:14] was not yet glorified yes but
[1:21:17] the holy ghost has been given amen the
[1:21:20] holy ghost is here
[1:21:21] amen and we can have as much as we can
[1:21:24] believe for
[1:21:26] no matter how many times we've been
[1:21:29] filled
[1:21:29] he wants to to to give us some more
[1:21:33] holy ghost amen he has more force
[1:21:38] it does often take some crucifying of
[1:21:41] the flesh
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:44] god doesn't want to share his holy
[1:21:46] spirit
[1:21:47] with the other spirit right he wants to
[1:21:50] fill your flesh
[1:21:52] but he doesn't want that other nature
[1:21:54] there
[1:21:56] acts chapter 3 verse number 40
[1:22:00] and with many other words did he testify
[1:22:03] and exhort saying
[1:22:05] save yourselves from this untoward
[1:22:08] generation amen
[1:22:09] we need many other words
[1:22:14] in fact we need
[1:22:17] all the word amen we need all the words
[1:22:20] written in here
[1:22:21] amen jesus said in
[1:22:24] matthew chapter 4 verse 4 he's talking
[1:22:26] to the devil
[1:22:27] if he's talking to the devil how much
[1:22:30] more it would be for us
[1:22:32] it is written men shall not live by
[1:22:34] bread alone
[1:22:36] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:22:39] the mouth of god amen
[1:22:40] we need every word of god especially
[1:22:43] this
[1:22:44] hour this wicked hour that we're living
[1:22:46] in
[1:22:47] it's horrible you can't watch the news
[1:22:50] without
[1:22:51] feeling yucky
[1:22:55] there's no hope in the world
[1:22:59] second timothy chapter 3 verse 13 but
[1:23:02] evil men and seducers shall worse
[1:23:05] shall wax worse and worse deceiving and
[1:23:07] being deceived
[1:23:09] but continue thou in the things which
[1:23:13] thou has
[1:23:14] learned and been assured of knowing of
[1:23:17] whom those learned them and that from a
[1:23:18] child that has known the holy scriptures
[1:23:20] which are able to make the
[1:23:21] wise unto salvation
[1:23:25] through faith which is in christ jesus
[1:23:28] all scripture is given by the
[1:23:31] inspiration of god
[1:23:32] and it is profitable for doctrine
[1:23:34] reproof correction
[1:23:36] instruction of righteousness that the
[1:23:38] man of god
[1:23:39] may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto
[1:23:41] all good works
[1:23:43] yes every time we come to church
[1:23:47] we should have a heart to be working out
[1:23:50] our salvation with fear and trembling
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:53] amen i don't mean to be belittling
[1:23:56] anybody's
[1:23:57] strong walk with the lord i don't mean
[1:23:59] that and one
[1:24:00] slightest of my thoughts but i do
[1:24:03] feel that god always has something more
[1:24:06] for us
[1:24:08] a lot of times we miss it
[1:24:11] we miss it because we're
[1:24:14] battling in our minds
[1:24:18] something that we're hearing that we
[1:24:20] don't think we should have to do
[1:24:26] and pretty soon we get stuck over here
[1:24:28] something that happened a month ago and
[1:24:30] we're wondering why we can't get
[1:24:32] anything out of
[1:24:33] we got to go back amen
[1:24:36] it's important to what god speaks to you
[1:24:38] is important can you imagine talking to
[1:24:40] your children
[1:24:40] about something that's really important
[1:24:42] to you and there's
[1:24:47] you're like yeah
[1:24:53] i believe when god speaks it's important
[1:24:56] amen who am i to say it's not that
[1:24:59] important
[1:25:01] it's important i'd like to show
[1:25:04] a little video about the
[1:25:08] importance of keeping yourself in the
[1:25:11] bible reading the bible the scriptures
[1:25:13] given to us
[1:25:14] that we can be perfect be what god wants
[1:25:18] us to be so we need to continue
[1:25:20] in the word of god just turn that up if
[1:25:23] you could too
[1:25:30] this is what i look like underneath my
[1:25:38] skin
[1:25:44] we can crank that off if we can
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:50] there was a recent study by the center
[1:25:52] for bible engagement
[1:25:53] where they pulled 40 000 uh
[1:25:57] general population in the u.s from eight
[1:25:59] to eighty
[1:26:00] and they just wanted to see how we are
[1:26:02] engaging with scripture
[1:26:04] right and they discovered something that
[1:26:07] actually became
[1:26:08] kind of the profound discovery of the
[1:26:10] entire study they weren't even looking
[1:26:11] for this and this is kind of
[1:26:13] became the highlight of study right um
[1:26:16] when we're in the scripture one time a
[1:26:17] week and that could be church on sunday
[1:26:19] that's
[1:26:20] pastor saying you open your bible we
[1:26:22] hear the message
[1:26:23] one time a week had negligible effect on
[1:26:26] some key areas of your life so
[1:26:27] i'm gonna spell that out more here in a
[1:26:29] moment two times a week
[1:26:32] negligible effect now at three times a
[1:26:34] week there was a blip on the map like
[1:26:37] there was a heartbeat
[1:26:38] something happened again
[1:26:41] a heartbeat but here was a profound
[1:26:43] discovery
[1:26:44] when we're in the scripture four times a
[1:26:46] week it literally spikes off the turtle
[1:26:49] you would expect that it'd be one two i
[1:26:51] mean there'd be a
[1:26:52] gradual link line on the effect and
[1:26:54] impact that would have in your life
[1:26:55] but it was literally one two three four
[1:26:58] something radically happened
[1:27:00] okay you got my curiosity to this extent
[1:27:02] what kind of behavior is being affected
[1:27:03] feeling lonely throughout
[1:27:04] thirty percent wow eight four times a
[1:27:07] week four times a week in the bible okay
[1:27:09] anger issues dropped 32 percent
[1:27:12] uh bitterness in relationships marriage
[1:27:14] a relationship with your kids and so on
[1:27:17] drops 40 percent alcoholism
[1:27:20] drops 57 feeling spiritually stagnant
[1:27:24] you know if there was
[1:27:25] one area when i'm talking with people
[1:27:28] that that they'll be honest about is
[1:27:30] they just feel spiritually stagnant
[1:27:32] ask them the question how much time do
[1:27:34] you spend in the scripture
[1:27:36] if they're in the scripture four times a
[1:27:37] week or more it drops 60 percent
[1:27:39] wow viewing pornography dropped 61
[1:27:43] that's very important now on a flip
[1:27:46] positive side
[1:27:47] sharing your faith jumps 200 percent
[1:27:50] wow because you have a confidence in
[1:27:51] god's word and then discipling others
[1:27:54] jumps 230
[1:27:55] that's that's amazing right there
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:09] make a difference in your life in so
[1:28:12] many different
[1:28:18] but it could help us yeah and we don't
[1:28:21] even realize it because
[1:28:23] the devil is trying to keep us away from
[1:28:25] reading the word
[1:28:28] we need to save ourselves we need to
[1:28:30] make the choice
[1:28:31] to read the bible more spend more time
[1:28:35] hebrews chapter 2 verse number one
[1:28:38] therefore we ought to
[1:28:39] give the more earnest heed to the things
[1:28:42] which we have heard
[1:28:44] lest at any time we should let them slip
[1:28:48] how shall we escape verse 3 says if we
[1:28:51] neglect
[1:28:52] so great salvation
[1:28:55] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:28:58] the lord and was confirmed
[1:28:59] unto us that heard him
[1:29:03] save yourselves mix the gospel
[1:29:06] with faith you've got to believe what
[1:29:10] you're hearing hebrews chapter 4 verse
[1:29:12] number 2 hebrews chapter 4 verse 2
[1:29:15] for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:29:18] as well as unto them but the word
[1:29:20] preached did not profit them
[1:29:22] why didn't it help some of them right
[1:29:26] because when they heard it they didn't
[1:29:28] believe it they didn't mix it with faith
[1:29:31] it was an intellectual well try to make
[1:29:33] myself better
[1:29:35] you can't make yourself better
[1:29:39] acts chapter 3 going back to our opening
[1:29:41] scripture here acts chapter 3 verse 41
[1:29:44] then they that gladly received the word
[1:29:46] they were baptized
[1:29:50] mix it with faith and get baptized in
[1:29:53] the name of jesus christ
[1:29:54] and that same day there were
[1:29:58] three other hun 3 000 other souls
[1:30:02] that made the same choices we did one
[1:30:04] day amen
[1:30:06] we're one of the few one of the few amen
[1:30:11] i love verse 42 and they continued
[1:30:15] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine
[1:30:18] and in fellowship with one another and
[1:30:21] in the breaking of bread
[1:30:23] and in prayers amen
[1:30:26] they just didn't continue they continue
[1:30:29] steadfastly put
[1:30:32] your faith in jesus christ he's the
[1:30:34] captain of our salvation
[1:30:37] he began a good work he's going to
[1:30:39] finish it amen
[1:30:40] we need to gladly receive the word when
[1:30:43] it comes to us
[1:30:44] and work out our salvation save
[1:30:48] ourselves with the word that's coming
[1:30:50] across the pulpit amen
[1:30:52] god sent a message in this hour to get
[1:30:55] us ready
[1:30:56] we need to take that message and save
[1:31:00] ourselves
[1:31:02] know a lot of believers don't continue
[1:31:06] steadfastly like they should
[1:31:09] they feel like they've met all the main
[1:31:12] requirements
[1:31:13] yeah they just want to continue
[1:31:17] ever so often here and there a little
[1:31:20] bit
[1:31:21] here and there this is not the time
[1:31:24] for any of us to take our foot off the
[1:31:26] gas pedal
[1:31:28] the hour is late if we've not received
[1:31:32] the seal of the holy ghost
[1:31:33] we need to be working on saving
[1:31:35] ourselves
[1:31:40] we need to keep pressing into
[1:31:42] sanctification
[1:31:44] we need to be looking at the things that
[1:31:46] god's dealing with us about
[1:31:50] amen the coming of the lord
[1:31:54] is near
[1:31:58] first john chapter 3 verse 1. i'll try
[1:32:00] to get through this i know
[1:32:02] we're near the end but we saw that long
[1:32:05] video
[1:32:07] and i'm not allowing it to have my time
[1:32:15] behold what manner of love the father
[1:32:17] bestowed upon us
[1:32:19] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:32:21] therefore the world knoweth
[1:32:22] us not because it knew him not amen it's
[1:32:25] okay
[1:32:26] people think you're strange because
[1:32:27] you're
[1:32:29] getting baptized in the name of jesus
[1:32:34] beloved now are we the sons of god and
[1:32:37] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:32:38] but we know that when he show up here we
[1:32:40] shall be like him for
[1:32:41] we shall see him as he is and if you
[1:32:43] truly believe this
[1:32:45] if you have this hope inside of you
[1:32:49] this confidence this expectation
[1:32:53] every man that have this hope in him
[1:32:56] purifieth
[1:32:57] himself he's saving himself
[1:33:03] even as he is
[1:33:06] pure even as he is saved he's saving
[1:33:10] himself amen that's why we don't want to
[1:33:13] feel like we're being
[1:33:14] belittled here when we hear the word and
[1:33:17] the word is telling us
[1:33:18] that we need to to depress in we need to
[1:33:20] do more we need to
[1:33:22] save ourselves yes we're saved but we
[1:33:24] need to continue
[1:33:26] saving ourselves because it is he that
[1:33:28] endure to the end the same shall be
[1:33:30] saved
[1:33:31] today is the day of salvation not back
[1:33:33] then when i got baptized
[1:33:35] today is the day of my salvation
[1:33:41] we need to continue to play our part
[1:33:48] whatever it is that god speaks to us
[1:33:54] a number of scriptures i'm going to pass
[1:33:58] but i want to read revelation chapter 19
[1:34:00] verse 7 very familiar let us
[1:34:02] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:34:06] him for the marriage lamb of
[1:34:08] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:34:09] and his
[1:34:11] wife saved yourself
[1:34:14] yes amen he made herself
[1:34:18] ready she did she was the only one
[1:34:22] out of everybody that heard the word she
[1:34:24] was the only one to obey all the word
[1:34:28] the rest of them only took part of the
[1:34:30] word right
[1:34:32] right the foolish virgins
[1:34:35] they were even clean people right right
[1:34:40] we need to be serious about the word god
[1:34:42] is serious about the word
[1:34:43] his wife is serious about the word amen
[1:34:48] god played his part by giving us a
[1:34:50] fivefold ministry
[1:34:52] we've got to play our part by believing
[1:34:55] taking the word
[1:34:57] that god gave us through the fivefold
[1:34:59] ministry
[1:35:00] and save ourselves with that word start
[1:35:03] doing it
[1:35:04] don't mouth cherry pick you know more
[1:35:07] smorgasbord
[1:35:08] do what i want take what i want not what
[1:35:10] i want
[1:35:11] that is not how you work out your
[1:35:13] salvation there is no fear and trembling
[1:35:15] in that
[1:35:17] the fear and trembling is i need all the
[1:35:20] word right
[1:35:21] if i don't feel comfortable with this i
[1:35:22] need to get serious because god is part
[1:35:24] of the word
[1:35:25] that's fear and trembling that's how you
[1:35:27] work out your salvation
[1:35:30] amen
[1:35:33] now for those of you who have received
[1:35:36] the seal of the holy ghost
[1:35:39] then we must keep our shoulder to the
[1:35:41] wheel in this hour
[1:35:44] we need to continue serving the lord
[1:35:47] with all the things that he shows us
[1:35:52] matthew chapter 28 verse 20 jesus said
[1:35:57] teaching others to observe
[1:36:00] all things whatsoever i command you
[1:36:05] and along with you always even to the
[1:36:06] end of the world we
[1:36:09] have to teach others
[1:36:12] to observe everything that god showed
[1:36:15] you personally
[1:36:16] it's kind of hard for you to show
[1:36:20] for you to tell somebody something when
[1:36:22] god hasn't showed you yet
[1:36:24] right but if god showed you something
[1:36:28] you can share it with somebody amen
[1:36:30] because he has
[1:36:32] he's he's commanded you to do it
[1:36:35] whatsoever i have commanded you
[1:36:39] we need to keep going keep teaching
[1:36:43] to the end jesus said lord i am with you
[1:36:46] to the end amen we can say amen to that
[1:36:51] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14
[1:36:56] for the love of christ constrains us to
[1:37:00] do this
[1:37:01] that's right to share the gospel with
[1:37:03] others
[1:37:04] it's the love of christ because we thus
[1:37:07] judge
[1:37:08] that if one died for all then we're all
[1:37:10] dead
[1:37:11] dead to our old sinful selfish
[1:37:15] self-centered ways of living
[1:37:18] verse 15 and that he died for all
[1:37:21] that they which live should not
[1:37:24] henceforth
[1:37:25] live unto themselves anymore amen
[1:37:29] but unto him that died for them and rose
[1:37:31] again
[1:37:33] so we got to switch who we're living for
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:36] amen amen we need to continue
[1:37:41] working for the lord jesus wants us to
[1:37:43] keep teaching
[1:37:45] first corinthians chapter 15 verse 58
[1:37:48] therefore my beloved brethren be ye
[1:37:51] steadfast
[1:37:53] unmovable always abounding
[1:37:56] in the work of the lord amen
[1:37:59] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:38:02] is not in vain in the lord
[1:38:08] if you're doing it in the name of the
[1:38:10] lord you're not going to lose a reward
[1:38:12] right i'd rather mess up
[1:38:16] greatly trying
[1:38:20] and not trying at all
[1:38:23] whoa that's way too quiet
[1:38:26] that's way too quiet for that statement
[1:38:32] i'd i'd rather be looked at
[1:38:35] as messing up
[1:38:38] but getting back up and trying again
[1:38:42] and having to be so perfect and get
[1:38:44] nothing done
[1:38:47] i only got a little bit time left
[1:38:50] i'm giving it all i got i don't even
[1:38:53] know what reward i got when i get on the
[1:38:55] other side brother ron
[1:38:56] i have no idea it may be
[1:38:59] only this right it'll be the grace of
[1:39:02] god to make it brother bruce
[1:39:05] but the thing is i i i don't even i
[1:39:09] can't even think well it's going to be
[1:39:10] just to this this this big
[1:39:13] all i know is this is the only chance i
[1:39:15] have to do something about it
[1:39:17] and i don't care how i look how i fail
[1:39:20] what happens i'm just going to get up
[1:39:22] and i'm going to keep going because he
[1:39:24] is my reward amen
[1:39:27] amen he's our reward amen
[1:39:32] our last scripture hebrews chapter 6
[1:39:34] verse 9
[1:39:38] this is for us who have the holy spirit
[1:39:40] we need
[1:39:41] to save ourselves
[1:39:46] because there's many other words jesus
[1:39:49] said many things to say unto you but you
[1:39:50] can't bear but after the holy spirit
[1:39:52] comes
[1:39:52] right you better stomach it
[1:39:55] hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 but beloved we
[1:39:58] are persuaded
[1:40:00] something better of you
[1:40:04] the things that go along
[1:40:08] with salvation
[1:40:11] though we thus speak
[1:40:15] now what are what are these things let's
[1:40:17] what are they
[1:40:18] let's read about them for god is not
[1:40:21] unrighteous
[1:40:23] to forget your work
[1:40:27] and labor of love
[1:40:32] which ye have shown toward his name
[1:40:37] in that ye have ministered to the saints
[1:40:41] and do minister amen
[1:40:45] those are the things that god expects
[1:40:49] out of us
[1:40:51] we all have a work to do yes we are all
[1:40:54] ministers
[1:40:58] that's right
[1:41:01] it's just where you want to allocate
[1:41:05] your time
[1:41:08] i do know this god
[1:41:11] is persuaded better things of us god
[1:41:14] expects us to be working for him
[1:41:19] and we desire that every
[1:41:22] one of you do show
[1:41:26] the same diligence to the full assurance
[1:41:29] of
[1:41:29] hope unto the end
[1:41:33] well brother john i'm just going to be
[1:41:36] honest with you
[1:41:38] it was the end for me a long time ago
[1:41:47] i think it was the end for a lot of us
[1:41:49] many times
[1:41:52] all we need is more holy ghost
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:58] the holy ghost doesn't run out of energy
[1:42:04] it doesn't run out of octane right
[1:42:07] it's got just as much joy today as the
[1:42:09] day we felt it
[1:42:10] it's got just as much peace just as much
[1:42:13] power
[1:42:15] we just need to get filled back up yes
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:19] there's joy in sharing jesus with
[1:42:21] somebody
[1:42:23] amen amen
[1:42:27] and god desires that every one of us
[1:42:29] show the same
[1:42:30] diligence of hope to the end
[1:42:35] look at verse 12 that ye be
[1:42:38] not slothful but
[1:42:41] followers of them who through faith and
[1:42:43] patience
[1:42:44] inherit the promises
[1:42:48] well the promise is unto you
[1:42:51] and to your children
[1:42:55] we just got to get the gospel we can't
[1:42:57] be slothful we need
[1:42:58] to save ourselves from being thoughtful
[1:43:03] we need to save ourselves from being
[1:43:05] slothful
[1:43:07] because there's more things that god
[1:43:10] wants us to be doing
[1:43:16] i don't want to be lazy
[1:43:20] i want to be serving the body
[1:43:24] and i'm talking about not only this body
[1:43:28] but the body who's not saved yet
[1:43:32] they're still part of the body just
[1:43:34] somebody's got to get the truth to them
[1:43:36] so they can get into the body that's a
[1:43:39] work that's a labor
[1:43:41] we don't want to be thoughtful in that
[1:43:43] in fact jesus said
[1:43:45] or the bible says maybe james they that
[1:43:47] win souls
[1:43:48] is wise it's a wise thing
[1:43:52] to do amen that means it's unwise not to
[1:43:55] do it
[1:43:59] amen let's stand together god wants us
[1:44:02] to save
[1:44:03] ourselves you don't have to preach
[1:44:07] you don't have to minister
[1:44:12] but we do have to serve
[1:44:15] we do have to wash some dirty feet
[1:44:19] we do have to help somebody along the
[1:44:20] way
[1:44:22] it's the plan of salvation
[1:44:27] for a lost soul we all
[1:44:30] can be saving ourselves from our
[1:44:33] condition
[1:44:37] saving ourselves from where we're at
[1:44:40] to where god is calling us to be so no
[1:44:43] matter where if
[1:44:44] if you haven't repented repent if you
[1:44:46] haven't been baptized be baptized
[1:44:49] if you haven't received the holy ghost
[1:44:52] get more serious about cleaning up your
[1:44:55] life
[1:44:56] so god can come and fill that precious
[1:44:59] vessel of yours
[1:45:00] right if you've got the holy ghost then
[1:45:04] amen get more get serious about using
[1:45:08] that vessel
[1:45:09] for the lord amen because that's what
[1:45:12] sanctification is all about it's set
[1:45:15] aside
[1:45:16] for service after you get the spirit
[1:45:19] you can't help there's something inside
[1:45:21] of you it's persuaded better things
[1:45:24] share the gospel with somebody every
[1:45:26] single day
[1:45:28] what a difference it would make it would
[1:45:31] help your
[1:45:33] it would help you uh it would help you
[1:45:36] somehow
[1:45:37] spiritually he was saying 200 and
[1:45:39] something percent
[1:45:41] just sharing your faith
[1:45:44] amen don't let this be the only place
[1:45:47] you get serious with god
[1:45:51] people talk about god all day long don't
[1:45:53] they brother
[1:45:54] and they're not serious about god it's
[1:45:56] not about talking about god it's about
[1:45:58] being serious about god
[1:45:59] amen take time to get serious with god
[1:46:03] and save yourself no matter where you're
[1:46:05] at with god save yourselves
