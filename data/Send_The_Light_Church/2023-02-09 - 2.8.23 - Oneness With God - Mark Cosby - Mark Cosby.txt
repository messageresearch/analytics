and Savior Jesus Christ says once again it's an honor privilege to be here just thank you brother John for the opportunity and um this is about our heads and word of prayer before we open up the holy word dear Lord Jesus we uh discounted a honor privilege to to be in your presence Lord just to being your house Lord and we all come for one reason and that is to meet with you Lord May each believer that will be here tonight there will be live streaming lore just have a testimony they met with God that they heard personally what God had for them and Lord as your Prophet said we come to church to see where we're at with you Lord may we each come with that direct motive Lord just to see where we're at with you Lord I pray Lord as we open the word Lord may you just bring it to life send your Holy Spirit Lord and let's bring the words to life off the very page of your word Lord help us to receive the engrafted word that's able to save our souls and Lord just bless this service from the opening prayer to the ending prayer Lord move your unworthy servant out the way Lord and may your voice be heard Lord throughout the congregation throughout the live stream we ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen so we want to turn to Genesis 11. and we'll read verses uh one and five through seven so Genesis 11 verses 1 and then five through seven very familiar scripture and the whole Earth was of one language in one sweet speech so we see at one point the Earth uh every man and woman was in in Oneness we're gonna see that wasn't a type of Oneness that God was looking for they were in unity but not the type of unity God desired his plan his perfect purpose I'm gonna go to verse five and the Lord came down to see the city in the tower which the children of men build it and the Lord said behold the people is one so we notice right there's a a Unity but not the type of unity that is like the body of Christ's Unity and they have all have one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do verse 7. go to let us go down there and confound their language they may not understand one another's speech and that's why we have so many languages now today but God can still speak in any language to any believer anywhere across the world let God bless his word and you may be seated so uh the title of our little message is we uh Oneness with God so I think it's going to be a little serious um it's just so I was just the studying I just realized how much it is until the being one with God it's just so much and it's such a beautiful thing that God desires us to be one with him so he's going to speak Oneness with God how important it is for each one of us to be one with God on a daily basis let's go to Genesis chapter one and we'll actually uh forgive me sister Amanda let's go Genesis 1 verses 15. let's try let's start with verse 15 first and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the Earth Verse 18 and tour over the day and other the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw it was good so we notice in these scriptures that they have to work in continuity they have to work in Oneness in order for it to be played out properly so God even created everything in one it has to work in accordance together in a Unity so we see God knows what he's doing when God does something it does not return void it's going to come out how it's set to be how he had it in his mind he had that there were thoughts in his mind and he expressed it and it became light so let's go to verse verse 20. and God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and the file that may fly upon the earth and the open firmament of heaven and God created the whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind in every winged foul after his kind and God thought it was good and God said and God blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply fill the waters in the scene that the foul multiply in the earth in the evening in the morning were the fifth day for verse 24 and God so that the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and the Beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and God made the beasts of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw it was good now verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea see see Brother Joseph didn't know that that that verse was in it was in the sermon after dominion over the fish of the seed over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth so we see at one point that man before the fall was in Oneness with God see now if if we went into a jungle and saw a lion we would probably want to do that because it might attack you but at one point Adam could pet a lion pet a tiger and no fear would be in there and so we're going see God is trying to take us back to that so when Jesus came on the Earth and died and rose again he put it in place so we could get back to how we were before the fall see God had when Adam fell God already had a plan to bring man back to Oneness with him it took thousands of years but that's how it had to be in order for it to be fulfilled so we have to strive for that Oneness we have to look and we have to every day we have to say Lord I need to be one with you I need to have the mind of Christ because Adam at one point had the mind of Christ every day before the fall but when sin crept in it made it so that now we have to fight to achieve this Oneness with God every day it's a battle a battle of Faith every day so let's go to Genesis 2. and we'll read verses eight through nine so it says and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put a man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of Garden in the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil notice he distinctly um separated these two trees from the other trees and we know we know what that is where those two trees are and we'll go to verse 15 though and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou Mays freely eat so every man and woman on this Earth today has a choice of what tree they eat from every day you have that choice and at the day of judgment um when other when the the great white Throne judgment no one can say they didn't have a choice no one can say that God didn't give them a chance he presents it to you do you want the tree of knowledge or of life and you have to you need if you want to be one with God you have to eat off the tree of life because that's the only thing that can bring you to Oneness with God because God doesn't mix good and evil together God is good end of the story so let's go to verse 18 and the Lord said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him and out of the ground the Lord God form every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and notice that Adam had the mind of Christ and that's what he named each animal that Adam named that's what God wanted because they were one and when we can get in in the Supernatural the in the spirit be in in one with God then his thoughts will become our thoughts because it's no more your thoughts taking over but it's a mind of Christ taking over you and that's what the Holy Spirit was sent for and I'm getting a little ahead of myself um let's keep going amen verse 20 and Adam gave name Saul Catalan to the father of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called a woman because she had taken out of the man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife there shall be one flesh so it's a beautiful type of the church in Christ being one that's what we're trying every day one we're trying to be Oneness with God and they were both naked and the man and his wife were not ashamed so we noticed in the beginning God created a Oneness for mankind to be in but in order for him to for this attributes to be manifested of him being a savior A Healer a deliverer how many can testify that he's delivered you amen he had to let man fall he didn't have to force man to make this decision but he gave man three more agency just as he's given each one of us free more agency and man chose the sin obviously because Adam was a type so Adam So Adam that's what his Calvary was Eve so he loved Eve so much he was willing to sacrifice everything and when she has a beautiful type of Christ giving his all for us that we may become one with him but in order for Adam to be redeemed Christ had to come in order for Adam to get back for Adam's race to get back to Oneness Christ had to come and live in a body of Flesh a tabernacle of Flesh and he did it so we could become one with him he showed us that you can live a life of an overcoming through the power of God through the power of the father he showed us how to do it and he's our perfect example for a reason and we have to follow that example if you want to be one with God follow the example of Jesus Christ because it will lead you to Oneness in fact he said I'm the way I'm the door no man can come unto me unless the father draw him amen so I got a couple quotes you mind if I read some quotes if Jesus said go back to the beginning there was only one pair of anything on Earth there was one Adam one Eve and they were joined by God Alone one female horse one male horse one female parent one male at the beginning as he told us to go back there was only one pair of anything is that true congregation says amen then we find out everything in the beginning was running in perfect order and harmony with God nothing was out of cater amen everything in heaven still is in order all the stars the galaxy the solar system this imagines one thing gets off a cater it will cause catastrophic events happening so just imagine if you imagine having there's there has to be perfect order you don't see some of the angels that say holy holy holy someone were over there saying I want to roast for lunch today no they're in Perfect Harmony because that's the way God created them too now listen do you see one Interruption spoils the whole entire program now when human beings is running in continuity with god with one man and one woman this woman sinned and throw the whole Earthly program out of continuity with God therefore one word added to this book or one word taken from it throws a Christian out of continuity continuity with God so if we come into service and don't receive and accept all the word then we are therefore thrown out of continuity with God because our our spirit has to agree with every word and stamp it with the amen it has to you can't just pick and choose with a pitchfork you got to rate the word in amen therefore one way one word added to this book or one word taken from it there was a Christian out of continuity with God throws a church out of continuity with God there's a family out of continuity with God so if you want God to do Mighty things in your family you got to make sure that you're in continuity with him you have to it's no other way God's only one who can can protect the family restore a family he's in a restoration business every every believer can be thrown out notice that he said every believer can be thrown out by not accepting every word of God so we have if you want to be one with God you have to accept every word no matter how hard it is to accept it or not because you need that word it's going to get you to the next level that God is calling you to which he's calling you to a deeper Oneness a deeper Unity with him a deeper personal walk with him the more personal we can get the more God can reveal to us the more God can use us in a way he couldn't use us um three months down the road a year down the road see God has has a vision to use us and we have to distrust in that Vision wherever he takes us that he's going to give us the the words that we need the maturity that we need oh everything that we need he's going to give us at the perfect time amen that was from uh marriage and divorce secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people notice that now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get get it back again who's thankful that there's there's a way back amen oh my oh my when this is Rich to me just even think of a see what was God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that then he would never be able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior you say how do you know he was because I've had that experience amen he's a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it only through Christ how could he be a son only through Christ how could he be a Healer only through Christ so we see that's why our life has to be engulfed in Christ surrounded in Christ see all things are wound up in that one person Jesus Christ oh my amen that was from Christ The Mystery of God revealed like one more quote now when Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of the devil the holy image of God left them their Fellowship was broken with God their Fellowship of Oneness with God was broken the very minute they listened to the LIE of the devil that broke their fellowship and notice right here he says and the very minute that you so the moment that you and I listen to the LIE of the devil it'll break our fellowship with God and the crazy part is we might not recognize it at that very moment just like when Samson he didn't recognize that he broke the fellowship of God by not listening to the commandment and and telling his secret and he didn't realize until his eyes were put out because he got up like nothing happened and they put his eyes out and then he had to say once more Lord he got in that condition because he wasn't spiritually aware he didn't give his heart to God he gave it to Delilah and we got to make sure that we're giving our heart to God every day it's not a One-Shot deal brother Brandon even said that there's many doors of your heart that you haven't opened to God yet so every day we've got to give our heart to God and open those doors that we have not opened yet that's the very minute that you go from the presence of God notice that like she did when you fail to take God's word just as it is it's good Isaiah 28. so we wanted to see how important it is for us is to be in Oneness with God no matter the situation you're going through no matter the struggles we got to strive to be one with God because if we keep our eyes on Christ everything else is going to fall in place he promised it in his word that it would take place and we have to believe that this word can directly help us not just in the physical but also in here in the soul amen so Isaiah 28 verses 10 through 18. so this is probably a very familiar scripture as well to us so it says for preset must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here little and they're a little so we gotta we can't just take scriptures out we want we gotta the word has to dovetail from Genesis Revelation that's how God made his word too he's not a man that would lie verse 11. for with staring lips and other tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith he may cause the weary to rest and it's not talking about a vacation rest but it's talking about a inner man rest the Holy Ghost is at rest and we gotta that's the type of rest that we need because a vacation can come and go and you wish you were back there but that Holy Ghost rest is there it's personally there for you to whom he said let me finish with uh William calls to worry to rest this is their refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the Lord was upon them precept upon precept upon precept blind upon line upon line here little and they're little that it may go and fall back or and be broken and snared and taken so at the end of the day there'll be no excuse why we didn't make it because God has placed it plainly lying upon the line precept upon precept he's not trying to trick us he's just he's not an author of confusion the scripture tells us in fact he wants you to live a Victorious Life he wants you to overcome any and everything that the devil throws at you but if we're not in Oneness and continuity with God then we can never overcome the enemy in his Wicked tricks see you can't fight the enemy with flesh and blood he'll laugh right in your face because he knows you can but see his his job is to get you away from that Oneness with God we must strive like I said Oneness with God on a daily basis but like I said before the fall Adam and Eve have that Oneness we have to like Christ said go back to the beginning and see that with the recognize with everything was in order everything moves smoothly but when Adam and Eve got out of order that's when trouble happened and when we get out of order that's when trouble trouble that's when trouble will happen as well so I'm so thankful that he made it possible for us to get back to that but remember this Satan will fight tooth and nail for us not to be in unity with God he will because he knows if we can get Unity with God he's powerless and we have to remember what Jesus said he said power is given to me in heaven and in Earth so there's no demon there's no sickness there's no nothing that can stop you only thing that can stop you is yourself from being one with God if Satan can get you to compromise see Satan wants you see if he can't get you to disbelieve God or or all the word he wants you to disbelieve this a portion of it he wants you to compromise with the word and when he gets you to compromise you will lose your Oneness with God at that very moment until you get back to the word so it's so important for us to be one with the word we have to submit ourselves to the word of God even though we don't want to our flesh doesn't want to we got to bury that man bury that that Wicked Man our flesh God made God Made You to thirst after him and God made the church knows that to be Oneness under his Dominion that's what he made the bride for to be Oneness under his Dominion but the devil makes them Oneness under his Dominion notice that if we look in history all the dictators Hitler was able to get Germany to be in Oneness with him but the reason why that Oneness did not stay because it was not of God and it broken disbanded and just how this how he God disbanded the Tower of Babel he did the same thing to Hitler and all the dictators disbanded them even though they had Unity for a second Satan thought he had it but God disbanded it because it wasn't in the play it wasn't pleasing to God so we can't just we're not going to agree on everything you might like different foods I might different foods you might like a different song I like a different song but the thing is we got to lay aside those things and come agreement upon the word of God that's what's important that's that's that's what how they're one according to Upper Room every one mind one body one Spirit they're in agreement that they knew that this that Jesus that he promised this promise and they were tearing on they were tearing for that promise amen amen God made a man to thirst that was from the Oneness of unity 1958 God made a man to thirst but to thirst after him that's why there's a thirst place in a man but the Devil comes along and perverts that cause the people to thirst after him with the things of the world the Bible said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of the father is not in you and then you see the devil created the devil is not a Creator he's just a perverter of the original creation and what is this sin is righteousness perverted amen as I was I was just we were just studying I was I think I was it was Tuesday and I was reading I forgot I think it was in John I was reading and I was just I was in the Brows in the break room and I was just like just I just want to get up and click my heels just reading the word I was like man just God wants this Oneness it's so beautiful and I was just like let me let me not let me add two crazy people might think I'm a little crazy but it's okay though but I was just just guys just showing me how important it is for us to be one if we want the body of Christ to work the way it's supposed to work we have to be one with God first God's Gonna teach us unity and Oneness amen amen we'll go to John chapter 15. so now in the Tower of Babylon if you'll notice at the tower it was the beginning of Babylon which I'll speak on later this week the Lord will Babylon the very city was patterned out of heaven and in there had the river Euphrates falling right by the throne in the garden swinging garden and that's the pattern off of Heaven of the River of Life that flows off the throne and you see the achievement that men was doing was making a pattern perverted see even denominations they'll take a truth of God then they'll start to pervert it because they stop right there and God can't reveal anything more to them and the same thing can have we could become a domination with ourselves see we gotta let the spirit let the spirit lead and guide you into all truth not just the truth that you want to and settle right there I'm good enough but let God lead you into all truth because if if we were if it was our time if it was our time to go God would have taken us up he would have called us off the scene but there's more word that God wants to reveal to you that you can walk in but you have to want that you have to yearn for that because each time we follow the god with God's word he reveals it to us we become more one with him notice that I just love that let's go to John 15 like I said before in reverses sorry verse one I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that bearth fruit he purchased it that it may bring forth more fruit amen now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you so you have to receive that word it can only clean you if you receive just like a pardon it's not a pardon unless received as a pardon so you got to receive that word and let it wash you let it cleanse you it says abide in me and I in you notice that's Oneness right there as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine so we cannot bear fruit unless we abide in Jesus Christ we cannot have life and unless we recognize that life comes from him everything that we have all that any good that's in US comes from Jesus Christ I don't care how good of I remember before I gave my heart to the Lord I thought I was a good person I thought it was a good Joe but that's not to get the job done because just because there's been many good people that can go to hell I'm sorry to say it is many good people there's religions out there that would probably outshine any America any American out there just the things they do even some brother Bram said some Heathen tribes um if if a woman had sex before marriage they would kill her because that's how sacred it was to them so it's not just about how good your morals is or how good your integrity is but it's about once again abiding in Christ Oneness with Christ because if that is not your main target main goal all those other things aren't going to do you any good because even the Rich Young Ruler was a good man he followed the he followed the Commandments but Jesus gave him this trying to give him this revelation and he couldn't receive it because he was so in love with the world and the goods and so he probably he probably lived a good life after that but we find out where his destination was it was hell so he's a good man he probably even gave to the poor so let's go to verse five let's finish verse four abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me so Jesus is telling us right there you cannot be you can't bear fruit unless you abide in him unless you're one with him it's the only way it's only life he's the only way he said before verse five I am the vine you are the branches knows the branches are connected to the life he that abideth in me and I in him same bringeth forth fruit for without me you can do nothing that's why it's so important to go on to get the Holy Ghost because if you don't have the Holy Ghost you can never become one with God for without me knows he said for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch in his withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you he shall ask what you will so you hit his word has to abide in you and then you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall be my disciples so the Lord is calling us to bear fruit when you plant a tree brother John an apple tree you expect it one day to grow into maturity into what bear fruit so same thing with God he expects us to to grow into maturity and start bearing fruit and that fruit isn't for yourself but it's for others that's what eternal life is is living for others and we gotta get that we got to get in that vision of that Oneness and unity if we can get that Oneness in unity with God that we can work together because that's what God is trying to get his people to be in one Accord one mind one Spirit one body so he can use us because we're an invincible Army because what God has done it's God's powers that makes us Invincible nothing that we can do no seminaries that we can go to but it's God everything's God at the beginning the end of the day is all God says Heron is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples as a father had loved me so I have loved you and he's he's calling us come continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love no it's a stipulation we have to keep the Commandments keep his word in order to abide in his love it's like I always use this example it's like you wanting to get fit lose weight and not do the things you need to do guess what's going to happen you're not going to get there if you if you want to lose 50 pounds if you want to uh shaping up tone up and you're going to the gym once every two months guess what's going to happen you're not going to do it you're not going to lose weight so the same thing you want to take it with spiritual eyes if we're not feeding on the word for not praying if we're not Desiring to be one with God thirsting hungering you've got to have a desperation to do that though you can't see you can't just have it up here but it has to be a hungering because how many people at the on a day of judgment had the knowledge that they needed to have a personal walk with God but they thought that they could go through a back door and what God desired was not just to do those Mighty Works in them but to have Oneness with them that's what God is Desiring in his he created us to be one with him he didn't create us to go do our own thing so it says verse 11. these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you that your joy might be full so I want you to notice that so if we're not keeping his Commandments for not reading like we need to for looking at our problems for looking at all these things in the cares of life is overwhelming us then of course your joy is not going to remain you have to do what Jesus has given us direct Commandments what to do to keep this Joy we got to look to him we got to be one with him we got to do what he's telling us to do it's it's so hard but it's so simple at the same time we just make it hard because we don't bury our dead men every day we don't bury this flesh every day now if we were to bury this flesh every day it'll be a lot easier for us to keep that joy to abide in his love but if we're just doing it every other day every other week I don't care how hard it is I don't care what you're going through keep your eyes on Jesus he promised him he meant he made a way for you his blood shed made a way for you so these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you thing is he wants to give you the joy it's your strength the joy of the Lord is your strength don't ever forget that this is my uh this is my commandment that ye love one another notice that's Unity absolutely and this doesn't say this is my commandment that you love one another only if they love you or when they do good to you or they buy you Christmas gifts it doesn't say any of that and it says that you love one another as I have loved you think about Jesus loved Jesus knew all the faults that the disciples had he knew that Peter was gonna um curse curse and then deny him he knew Judas was gonna uh sell them for silver or silver right gold silver silver but he still loved them he didn't have respect for persons but he loved them so he's telling us do the same thing but the thing is your human love cannot get it done that's why brother Branham said lay everything aside until you receive perfect love because our love can never get the job done it's it can only go so far so I love that song Love of God so it says greater love hath no man than this this is eternal life right here that a man laid down his life for his friends and knows right here how many wants to be a friend of God you are my friends if notice that if you do whatsoever I command you and that's why Abraham could be called a friend of God because he took God at his word and believed it did he have did he have mistakes yes do we have mistakes yes so we're just like Abraham and he's a father of our faith and he was called a friend of God because he was obedient to the Commandments of God so we want to follow on the same footsteps of Abraham and be obedient to the voice of God let's go to John 17. and we'll go to verse verse one I I I really love this I love the word I love this chapter right here I I love it these words fake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh notice that that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they may know the the only true God in Jesus Christ whom thou sent Oneness notice that Oneness when one with God we were we can fill eternal life which is what living for others because you're going to have a revelation that they might know the the only true God and what was Jesus a servant he didn't care what he had to go through but he wanted to see his disciples see he saw that perfect say that glorified body he saw the finished product of what they were going to be so he knew he had to die for them to get to that point so when he died it made a way that we could have a intimate personal relationship with him and he and he he's trying to show us and tell us what it is I've glorified thee on Earth and we got to make sure that our life is glorifying God the way we think the way we conduct ourselves the way we speak the way we Act because if Jesus's mission was to glorify the father and to do what the father told him to do he said I do nothing but the father shows me notice he just wanted to do what the father he had such a hungering and thirsting to do exactly what the father said we've got to have the same exact uh desire and Desperation to exactly what Jesus is telling us to do as well I have glorified thee on Earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do I don't know if tomorrow's promised or how long we're going to be in this Earth but the end of our life can we say the same testimony I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do and now oh Father glorify glorify thou me with thy own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was in the mind of God I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy word now they have known that all things what Surah whatsoever thou has given me are of thee amen for I have given unto them The Words which thou gave us me and they have received them so we got to make sure each time we're coming to service we're receiving the words that God has for us and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did Ascend me love is right here I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thy in all our mind all our all our mind are thine in thine are mine now that's a little tongue twister and I'm glorified in them and now I am no more I love it I am glorified in them Christ the hope of glory the Christ revealed the mystery in you him being glorified through you I love that that's what Jesus wants is to be glorified through our vessels he wants to use our hands our feet our eyes our lips to be to glorify himself to others and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world I come to thee Holy Father keep through thy own name Those whom thou has given me given me that they may be one notice that whom thou has given me that they may be one amen I swear Oneness that's what God desire Oneness he says as we are notice that while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come I to thee in these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I said before we can't let trials we can't let the cares of this life overcharge us because the minute that we do that we lose the joy we start to lose the Oneness with God he gave us a perfect formula and we're going to read that a little later says I have given them verse 14 Thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world we not we are not of this world we're not we're here to be Witnesses ambassadors we're here to bring people to Unity I pray that I would just take them out the world but thou shall keepeth them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth that's what we said before you've got to receive you gotta accept all the word of God you got to eat eat the book because all this word is truth only thing this word is going to do for you is help you I promise you it's going to help you it may not feel like it may not feel as if it's helping right now but it is helping it's like when brother Brandon would take that castor oil it helped may not taste good it made a burn or it would but it helped and the word of God not only helps but it restores you it brings you to a finished product because we're going to a finished product whether we like it or not we're going to a finished product that God has thou has sent me into the world even so I've also sent them into the world so the things that we're going through the trials the tribulations they're for a reason perfecting of our faith so we can get christ-like character and that's why if you look how Paul he said I glory in my persecutions I glory in my trials afflictions weapons and if we would more just look to God during the trial instead of how hard it is because God it says brother brother John read this uh in Philippians 2 says do all things without murmurings and disputings notice that it says do all things not just the things that you want to but all things see if we looked at this price we had so many afflictions oh we can probably go to our life and to see all the things we've been through or even right now we might be through some hard times but if we can keep our eyes on the Oneness with God keep our eyes at Lord I'm going through these things to be closer to to be brought closer to you because your trials only can either they can bring you away from God or closer to God and we look at the children of Israel most of them brought them away from God but not Joshua and Caleb it brought them closer to God Amen and in fact we just see even after the 40 years Joshua and Keith were probably even more in love with God than what they were before as for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth right he's speaking to us he's talking about us neither pray for for I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word he's he's praying for us he's praying for us I'm really one more time neither pray for for I for these alone but for them also We Shall Believe on me through their word ready to know something that they all may be one notice that as thou father are in me and I EnV that they also may be one in US the world may believe that thou has sent me so we could become one with God that's when we become an effective witness in the kingdom of God we have to have Oneness to Be an Effective witness of God when the disciples were witnessing and establing churches they were effective because they were one with God they didn't care about in fact they even sold all they had and they were still one they didn't care what they had to do to get the gospel across the world they were willing to do anything to make help to to be one with God says that they all met we were there verse 22 and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them who amen that they may be I love us one even as we are one notice is how many how much is one Oneness Oneness Oneness Oneness is so important and especially not just when you're wearing a hard time or a trial but even the good times you want that to carry over you want that to be consistent because a lot of times man we have a tendency of calling on God desperately when we're in a time of need but if we can call God in the on the Mountaintop and in the valley we're not the trial wouldn't surprise us because the scripture tells us exactly what a trial does the trying of your faith father I will oh I'm sorry verse 23. i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and if the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou Hast loved me God God loved you so much that he made a plan that he would have to die for you to be one with him tell me if that's not love that's the definition of love right there not even a human definition can describe the love of God it can't even scrape the surface of the love of God not even that love of God song Can scrape the love of God not even if you knew a hundred languages there's over 7 000 different languages that are recorded and even then it still could not escape the love of God father I would they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am notice that's a promise that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou love has been before the foundation of the world o righteous father the world has not known me but I have known thee and these have known that thou have sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that that the love foreth thou has loved me notice that may be in them and I in them I can see why our Prophet said lay everything aside until you get perfect love amen let's go to John 3 30. notice what the the prophet said here John the Baptist he says he must increase but I must decrease so we have to decrease in order for God to increase and when we decrease that's when the Oneness of God Amen happens so the Way Up Is Down so you gotta we gotta humble ourselves it's like Jesus is so through all we read right now Jesus the main theme what Jesus is trying to get to us we have to keep that Oneness with him because he he did all these things that we could have the Oneness and now we have to fight for that Oneness because this is the hardest age we live in but it's not impossible to live in because you got to do it through God he has to be your Source your power source your main power source not not some self-help book some motivational speakers but God has to be your main source if we are so overwhelmed in life's issues so distracted then we're going to lose that Unity with God when you lose that Unity with God you start to lose what your joy and your peace don't let the cares of Life take you away from your personal walk with God it's the only thing that's going to matter at the end of the day remember I do not care how hard it gets you keep your eyes on Jesus he told us in Matthew 6 33 we can all probably quote this but it's it's a lot more than quoting it and living it it's a big difference but it says so we read in this chapter all these things that he knows we have need of he said even he said behold the fowls of the air for they Soul not neither do they reap nor gather into barns check this out yet your heavenly father feedeth him he says are ye not much better than they that's Jesus speaking right that's not me speaking that's Jesus speaking but seek ye first the kingdom of God you might say well brother Mark I've seek in the Kingdom well if you're really seeking the kingdom then you wouldn't be looking and be distracted by the cares of this life you wouldn't be overwhelmed or you would we wouldn't be I hate to say this church wouldn't be empty if we were really seeking God like he's telling us to seek the church wouldn't be empty I know it's hard words but it's the truth and we got to God to seek first the kingdom of God he knows we have need of all these he knows you need strength to to fight through this trial he knows you need all these things uh whatever a car or maybe money to pay the bills or or whatever it is you fill in the blank he knows we have need of all these things but he says and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you he wants to add these things unto you but if we can't be faithful to God how can he be faithful to us I'm saying one more time if we're not faithful to God then how can he be faithful to us he told us in John 17. about the commit following his Commandments and you abide in his love you have joy you have all these things but if we're not following what God is telling us to do then how do we expect God to move in in our situation when Jesus was a walk here to pass by a town because there was so much unbelief there he couldn't do anything so God can't do anything in your life if you're doubting him if you're not seeking him his hands are tied he's not a God who forces himself but he's a God who moves by your faith by your confession by your profession that's the only way that God can move in your life if you profess that he can move you profess as he that he's your healer that he's your deliverer see you can't just get you can't get God because brother John said he's his deliverer or healer you have to claim it personally that when he said blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled you have to claim that for yourself personally that's a promise that God has written to you personally and there's so many promises but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength that's a promise you have to claim you have to wait there's no time limit on how long you have to wait it says wait don't be discouraged don't be dismayed he knows what you have neither Daniel Prayed for 21 days straight and he let that one time discourage him the angel even said God said I heard your prayers from the very first day but there are some things that had had to happen there's some a little roadblocks that had to happen and the same thing maybe you're praying for something for a long time God has heard it from the very first time you prayed it did not fall it did not fall to the ground he knows what you have need of it's just waiting for the perfect timing for it to be fulfilled amen hallelujah amen pray hardest when it's hardest to pray serve when his heart is to serve read when it's hardest to read listen to a tape when it's hard hardest to listen to a tape notice that it's so easy to to read the word of God when all your time is just open it's so easy to pray when you don't have anything really going on is Easy Street it's easy listen to a tape when you're not that busy but I'll tell you what the real Victory is doing it when your time is so eating up but you still make sincere time to God because that's what's gonna get the growth that's where the growth happens when you're doing things when it's hard as to do that's how that growth happens let's go to Luke 21. I feel like I even like even scaved this that's why I could see why the Lord once wants a series because it's so much I just love that that God just wants us to be one with him I just love that so here's another a remedy verse 21 or vert sorry chapter 21 of Luke verse 34. and take heed to yourselves less at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting notice that and drunkenness and the cares of this life and so the day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the if notice that so nobody is excluded for uh having cares of this life troubles problems everybody is going to have those and whether you're serving God or not serving God you're going to have these problems but Jesus is trying for us to take heed so these things don't overwhelm us they don't distract us he's trying to warn us that's what God that's what Jesus is trying to do in his in his exit right here he's trying to warn us of these things that will take you away from the Oneness of God for the snare should compound all of them that dwell on the face of the Earth of the whole earth watch right here is the remedy watch ye therefore and pray always that is the remedy right there you got to be watching and praying always says that ye may be accounted worthy to escape what all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man so right here that's a remedy to any fiery trial you're going through any uh you feel like you can't break through you just keep praying until you have a breakthrough keep praying keep praying so my brother Brandon said neology that's the key amen let's go to Psalms 27. we'll go it's our last scripture then we'll close with a quote I'm going the wrong way so I don't know here maybe somebody here tonight uh I don't know the secrets of your heart but maybe some tonight or maybe going through a struggle but whatever you're going through I love this in Psalms 27. so let's start with verse 1. this is my this is my life the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear so what trial do we have to fear he's our light in our Salvation the Lord is the what the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall not for we give you say like this though fiery trials should just engulf my life against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple Oneness with God that's how you strive for Oneness you got to seek after that Oneness that you may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of your life and behold the beauty of the Lord and inquiring his Temple verse 5. for in the time of trouble knows that for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion but if our eyes are not on Christ how can he hide you because that's where your strength is at is in Christ and if we're not faithful to Christ how do you expect him to hide you in this Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a Rock Amen amen we're going to verse seven or number six and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore I offer in his Tabernacles sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord Praise when it's hardest to praise lift him up when his heart is to lift him up glorify him when his heart is to glorify him we got to praise and worship the Lord I'm our brother Joseph said this statement to me uh I think it was like last last two Saturdays ago a lot of times we just go to God with our needs but let's just go god let's just go to God and just just thank him praise and worship let's just don't even ask anything but that just thank him and praise and worship him I guarantee the atmosphere will just change I'm I remember doing that I was like wow I feel so selfish I was doing it before just go to God and thank him for his goodness praise him for his word his holiness yeah oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou says when thou said it's seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek amen in verse 14 says wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord David's telling us to wait last quote I'll sister show you can come up we got to put this flesh under subjection you control your flesh not your flesh control you remember that God is calling us to a daily Oneness a daily Unity with him and it takes us fully surrendering to him if we don't surrender then we lose our chance to be one with him for the day we need to make it a number one priority to achieve this every day each time you wake up he's inviting God is inviting us to Oneness into Unity don't don't Adam Adam Eve Adam let me cry out to you don't listen to a lie of the devil anymore stay with God's word he's talking to us it's thus saith the Lord stay with his word to separate from it is breaking your fellowship with God God's Oneness by the Holy Spirit but if you say you got the Holy Spirit and it's not in agreeance with the agree with the word then you're not Oneness with God this is God's Oneness when you the spirit that you got agrees with this word and Manifest this word and makes this word power to act the same way it did there let's say it together Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word the whole word and to make it manifest in power there you are that's Oneness with God the power Works in me Works in you we are one Amen brother kid when the power of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in you there is no disagreement the words there praise God it works amen and it makes what it is God made flesh in You by his word amen I'm ready again God made flesh in You by his word the word made Power among you every word amen so this closing thought we gotta strive for that Oneness we want to see unity in the body of Christ we got to be one with God first we got to make sure everything's in order every day we got to be one with God no excuses we just got to do it because I promise you the quicker we get to that the more God can begin to use us and the magnitude that he wants to use us so Oneness is so important even Jesus prayed for us to be one so that's how much you want us to be one let's just rise and maybe it's just a Cheryl can just play something Softly As we just bow our heads in prayer dear Lord Jesus um we just come before you Lord Lord you've been so good unto us Lord we can just we can't even count the times that you've came through for us or to be too many to even write in a book lord God you just showed us your goodness and your mercy and your loving kindness towards us Lord and Lord this this very moment Lord this for the rest of our lives where it's Desiring Lord just to to take you at your word just to be one with you Lord forgive us for the Times Lord we've been difficult we've been stubborn Lord forgive us for the Times where you spoke to us something and we kind of just brushed it off floor God we're just coming before you Lord because we want to be one with you Lord not because uh brother Mark said it or the Pastor said it or some brother said it but Lord because we want to fall more in love with you I want to be used more by you Lord I know I can say Lord that I have failed you Lord many times and being that Oneness Lord I'm sorry we're sorry Lord and Lord we come here together it's United in prayer United in Faith Lord that we want this Unity this to to be in our church to be in our lives to be in our homes our households our children Lord help us Lord because we can't do it without you lord we need your strength we need your power we need your joy and your peace Lord Lord may we be faithful to you Lord no matter the circumstance situation may we be faithful to you and your word because they're one oh God we just want to rededicate ourselves unto you Lord the year is still young Lord there's still time to live a Victorious year Lord may we claim a Victorious life through you lord lord may you just move like you've never moved before in our lives Lord May our faith this arise to the occasion Lord may we take you for every word that you said you are every word is in the Bible from Genesis to revelation we want to stamp it with faith that word is for US Written towards us personally we claim you not only is a Healer but a deliverer but a restorer but a way maker you can make a way where they seemeth no way you can make peace when there can be no peace you're a God that's not bound by human limitations only thing for you to move in our life is for us is to let go and let God have his way may from this day forward we let go and let God have his way Lord may you dismold us and shape us into the image that you called us to be in God we give you full preeminence in these vessels in our lives may you fill us refill us with your Holy Spirit Lord that we may just do and say what you did as you want us to the second the Garden of Eden Adam had the mind of Christ may we strive for that Oneness that they had in the Garden Eden which you're calling us right back to we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] and so needy Lord so needy of you let him know it tonight I am so needy Lord to be more like you share all my rights away share them Lord in this world of sin I am so needy Lord to be pure with them just make love to him I am so needy Lord so needy of you I am so needy Lord to be more like you think of that Oneness share all my rights away my rights away in this world of sin one more time lift it up to him I am so needy Lord we need you Lord so needy of you I am so needy Lord to be more like you see all my rise away in this world of sin I have so needy Lord still be pure with us can we sing more of you
