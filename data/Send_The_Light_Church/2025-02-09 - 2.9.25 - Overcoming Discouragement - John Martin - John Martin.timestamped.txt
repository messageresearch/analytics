[39:27] tooth that needs to be taken care of and
[39:30] these things can cause like a headache
[39:32] can cause pain can cause discomfort and
[39:36] you're and you're if you've been in pain
[39:38] for a long periods of time those of you
[39:40] that have back pains and things it you
[39:43] you just you begin to go crazy
[39:46] honestly um but when you're having um
[39:50] symptoms like this and you you just want
[39:51] to get rid of the the pain in your
[39:54] head and you go for the asper you just
[39:57] you just need some sort of
[39:59] relief uh but the root cause is still
[40:03] there and when it comes to
[40:06] discouragement yes we we want to be
[40:08] encouraged but it's better to get to the
[40:11] root
[40:12] cause because then you can have Victory
[40:15] um and you don't need to be encouraged
[40:18] if you get to the root cause I mean I
[40:20] won't need eventually if I take take
[40:22] care of the absess the pain in my face
[40:24] is going to be gone so I don't need to
[40:27] keep doing aspirin for 3 weeks or um
[40:30] baking soda or whatever just just just
[40:32] take care of the of the issue are you
[40:35] with me all right so we want to talk
[40:38] about the underlying issues there to try
[40:40] to help us down the road now here Joshua
[40:44] is being commissioned by God to go over
[40:47] and take possession of what God had
[40:49] promised their fathers which didn't get
[40:52] to go over simply because they had
[40:56] something in inside of them that would
[40:59] not allow them to go over the promised
[41:01] land which we can't have inside of us
[41:04] and that is simply
[41:06] unbelief and when they faced the Giants
[41:08] they were definitely giant problems it
[41:11] was discouraging to
[41:14] them but God tells them exactly the
[41:17] territory that belonged to them just
[41:21] like he tells
[41:23] us but the rulers
[41:27] they
[41:28] had they actually had to fight to take
[41:31] possession even though God gave it they
[41:33] had to take possession so God wants us
[41:36] to prosper and to be in health and to be
[41:39] happy and to be full of joy and to have
[41:42] this happiness inside of us but we
[41:44] literally it's not going to be given to
[41:47] us we have to take possession of it so
[41:50] it's going to require facing fears
[41:52] facing things it's going to require work
[41:54] it's going to require getting out of our
[41:55] comfort zone to take a hold of what God
[41:58] has already promised
[42:00] us now fighting these giant problems is
[42:04] going to bring bring uh bring us up if I
[42:09] could say it like this all of us to the
[42:11] temptation of
[42:14] discouragement because you know we're
[42:16] we're if we're driving to church and all
[42:18] of a sudden we got a flat tire you know
[42:21] that's going to be
[42:23] discouraging and so we've we've got to
[42:26] look at this flat tire situation and not
[42:29] get
[42:31] discouraged I know it's I'm just but I'm
[42:33] telling you you can take this message
[42:34] you can apply to anything in your
[42:37] life you still got to deal with the flat
[42:39] tire but you don't need to deal with it
[42:41] with discouragement we can't sit here
[42:44] and say well brother John you can't
[42:45] expect us you know to never be
[42:47] discouraged if we get a flat tire what I
[42:49] am telling you is you need to start
[42:51] looking at the flat tire in a way that's
[42:53] without
[42:55] discouragement so
[42:57] God commands them He commands them to be
[43:02] of good
[43:03] courage to be strong to not be afraid
[43:08] and to not be dismayed now this is the
[43:10] Commandment that he gives
[43:12] them and if we take this commandment
[43:15] into our heart when we're facing our
[43:18] situations it is impossible for
[43:20] discouragement to get in there because
[43:23] look Joshua and Caleb were part of the
[43:25] 12 Spies that went over over
[43:27] there but you know they all didn't come
[43:30] back with the same report they saw the
[43:32] same thing but they didn't view it the
[43:33] same way 10 of them VI like the problems
[43:36] that they were having were too too
[43:39] sermonic they were we were grasshoppers
[43:42] in their sight and and it was we we
[43:44] couldn't take the
[43:45] land they came back with a fear they
[43:48] were
[43:50] dismayed they were that means that that
[43:53] dismay it means more to be than
[43:55] discouraged it's a stronger sense of
[43:57] shock or surprise something
[44:00] unexpected and discouragement is a loss
[44:03] of confidence or
[44:05] courage think about that discouragement
[44:07] if you look it up is a loss of
[44:09] confidence or courage basically it's
[44:12] called bad
[44:17] courage so Joshua and Caleb they did
[44:23] have good
[44:25] courage they said we're more than
[44:28] able they didn't look at the
[44:31] problem they looked at the
[44:35] promise and the more of God we can get
[44:37] in our problems the more chance that we
[44:40] can overcome
[44:42] them and the more we try to handle the
[44:45] problems without God you know we're
[44:47] going to be just like those 10 spies
[44:49] scared out of our wits what to
[44:53] do I liked our first song that we sung
[44:55] today I'm Bound for the Promised Land
[44:58] amen now how do we remain strong
[45:02] enough in a state when we're facing our
[45:06] problems how do we stay strong enough
[45:08] when we're facing them how do we not get
[45:11] dismayed or afraid while we're dealing
[45:13] with real problems in life how do we
[45:16] learn to overcome when we come up to the
[45:19] temptation of getting discouraged
[45:21] because of what we're dealing
[45:23] with well God tells Joshua and I believe
[45:26] God is telling us today by meditating on
[45:29] God's word day and night and speak the
[45:34] word speak it don't turn to the left
[45:37] don't turn to the right but remain with
[45:39] what the Bible says
[45:42] amen
[45:44] we we're fighting demonic
[45:50] thoughts and the only thing that can
[45:53] overcome demonic thoughts is the word of
[45:55] God
[45:58] uh Mind Over Matter only works so
[46:02] long because the devil
[46:05] knows how to get to every element on the
[46:08] on on Earth with Humanity except he
[46:11] can't go through the word of God that's
[46:14] why the Bible says submit yourselves
[46:16] therefore unto God resist the devil and
[46:18] he'll flee from
[46:20] you we know courage and confidence are
[46:25] choices
[46:28] and the 12 Spies was a good example of
[46:31] that they're not based on
[46:35] anything courage and confidence is not
[46:37] based on
[46:42] anything
[46:44] discouragement is not based on
[46:48] anything in other words it's not true
[46:51] how many times have you looked at
[46:53] something got discouraged and it wasn't
[46:55] even true
[46:57] it's just an imagination it's something
[46:59] that the devil places in your mind to
[47:01] make it look the way he wants it to look
[47:03] to you like there's
[47:07] giants either you have confidence that
[47:09] you can water ski or you don't have
[47:12] confidence we don't even we don't even
[47:14] know
[47:16] yet we don't know if it's true or if
[47:18] it's an
[47:20] imagination either we have courage to
[47:22] get in the Water behind a boat grab onto
[47:24] the the handles and get up and go or you
[47:28] don't have confidence it's either
[47:31] or but you understand we the devil the
[47:34] way the devil presents to our mind is
[47:36] it's fact I don't I
[47:41] can't so we got to look at the root of
[47:46] discouragement it's something that the
[47:49] devil um makes a picture of in your
[47:53] mind so if courage and confidence are
[47:56] choices
[47:57] they are the way that we think about a
[47:59] situation it's the attitude that we
[48:01] choose about the problem that we're
[48:03] looking at amen so if they are choices
[48:06] then discouragement is also a
[48:10] choice I want to drive that home today
[48:13] discouragement is a
[48:15] choice but you know when the Devil comes
[48:17] to you he does not tell you it's a
[48:19] choice he says it's because of this
[48:21] because of this it's because of the
[48:22] Giants it because what they said how
[48:24] they treated me no discourage me
[48:27] is a choice in
[48:32] life we've heard the saying people can
[48:34] knock me down but they can't keep me
[48:38] down because it's a
[48:41] choice discouragement may be staring Us
[48:44] in the face but we can choose to say I'm
[48:47] not
[48:51] discouraged it's an attitude it's a view
[48:54] of how you're you're staring at the
[48:55] problem
[48:57] and it's it's not well I I think
[48:59] management should take care of this and
[49:01] the and and the husband the wife should
[49:03] take care of this and the teacher should
[49:05] take care of this and the neighbor
[49:07] should take care of this
[49:08] and Verizon should take care of
[49:13] this now your attitude needs to take
[49:15] care of
[49:17] it it needs to start with the right
[49:21] mental attitude will bring any Divine
[49:23] promise why do we need the Divine
[49:25] promises because it we need something to
[49:28] get us to where we want to amen and if
[49:30] the right mental attitude does it then
[49:32] we need to have the right mental
[49:33] attitude when we're staring at
[49:37] problems Proverbs 24:16 for a just man
[49:40] falleth seven
[49:42] times what he what does he do he riseth
[49:46] up again amen but the wicked shall fall
[49:50] into Mischief in other words he doesn't
[49:54] get back up he still dwells ing in this
[49:57] miserable
[50:00] problem so if we want to get
[50:02] up if we want our problem resolve we
[50:05] must first have an attitude in our mind
[50:08] that we're more than able to go through
[50:11] this because God is with me and greater
[50:14] is he that's in me than he that's in my
[50:18] problem there are things in this world
[50:21] that can discourage us but we always
[50:24] must remember that discouragement is
[50:26] nothing but a
[50:29] choice it's not our problems that
[50:31] discourage us but it's our attitude
[50:33] about the
[50:35] problems you know Satan is allowed to
[50:38] present a present a situation to us that
[50:41] looks like Gloom he's allowed to do that
[50:44] that's
[50:46] scripture but we don't have to sit there
[50:48] and say yeah I believe
[50:51] you if I choose to never be discouraged
[50:54] then I will never be discouraged
[50:58] no matter what the problem
[51:01] is
[51:02] job he kept his heart upon
[51:06] God now job's his friend well presented
[51:11] to job that maybe he had an issue a
[51:15] problem going on he was a secret
[51:19] sinner God has you know probably left
[51:21] you that's why you're going through the
[51:23] test that you're going
[51:25] through job's one
[51:27] wife well she said nothing seems to be
[51:31] going your way you might as well just
[51:32] Curse God and
[51:34] die job said you're speaking like a
[51:36] foolish
[51:38] woman job's wife definitely chose to be
[51:42] discouraged dismayed and bothered about
[51:45] the whole situation but job said though
[51:47] he slay me yet will I trust him amen I
[51:51] choose to trust
[51:53] God now if we can actually say that with
[51:56] all of our heart with our situation that
[51:58] we will not spend any time being
[51:59] discouraged looking at our
[52:01] problem because it's just a matter of
[52:03] attitude and if what job went to he
[52:05] could have the right attitude he went
[52:07] through so much more than we've ever
[52:09] gone
[52:12] through I I am Telling You
[52:15] discouragement is nothing but a painting
[52:17] that the devil gives us I'll say take it
[52:20] off the wall and get put it in the
[52:21] garbage don't let it hang in your wall
[52:24] don't let it hang in your in in your
[52:25] rooms and your car at work in your
[52:28] relationships just get the get the get
[52:31] the picture
[52:34] out put up
[52:40] Jesus Psalms 27:1 says the Lord is my
[52:45] light and my
[52:48] shield Whom Shall I
[52:51] Fear the Lord is my strength the
[52:54] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[52:57] afraid now just think about all your
[52:59] situations I don't care if you're
[53:01] bothered by your your wife your husband
[53:04] your your job uh the the government the
[53:07] the the taxes that are due the bills the
[53:11] the car I I you must stand upon the Lord
[53:15] is the answer to the
[53:18] problem God does not want to share his
[53:20] glory with
[53:22] anyone he he wants to be the strength
[53:27] the light and the life of of of of of
[53:30] each and every one of us now when the
[53:33] wicked even my enemies and my foes Came
[53:35] Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled
[53:38] and they
[53:40] fell though a whole should encamp
[53:43] against
[53:44] me I mean all my friends are against
[53:48] me they're not my friends anymore than
[53:50] my
[53:53] enemies though a host should encamp
[53:55] against me my heart shall not fear it's
[53:57] a choice am the war should even rise up
[54:02] against me in this will I be
[54:09] confident his confidence was in God
[54:14] Amen that God was really with him and
[54:19] I'll say it like this in order for God
[54:22] to be with us we can't sit around and do
[54:25] nothing right and expect God to be with
[54:27] us there's a reason we need to pray
[54:31] there's a reason we need to get into the
[54:33] word to meditate upon it day and night
[54:35] there is a reason that we should seek to
[54:37] be in the house of the Lord to get in
[54:39] the prayer rooms to listen to the
[54:42] tapes because there's a part that we
[54:44] need to pray why so that we have faith
[54:47] to believe in the realness of God in our
[54:51] lives it's not just saying well we know
[54:53] God is real no we know he's real
[54:57] here so when discouragement comes when
[55:00] the when the devil plants these thoughts
[55:02] that we can just I shall not be moved
[55:05] I'm not going to fear I'm staying with
[55:07] David I can write my own Psalms
[55:10] today that's why we need to spend time
[55:14] with
[55:15] God Thomas Edison said came face to face
[55:19] with
[55:20] discouragement but he chose to remain
[55:22] positive saying I have not failed I just
[55:25] found 10,000 we ways that the light bulb
[55:28] won't
[55:32] work but he it it took a lot of work now
[55:36] I think he also said uh opportunity lies
[55:40] uh all around us we just don't recognize
[55:42] it because it's camouflage it it's
[55:44] dressed in overalls and it looks like
[55:48] work and and if I could just say this
[55:53] that discouragement is there
[55:57] I mean he could have quit after a
[55:59] hundred times but he didn't he knew he
[56:04] had a vision it was a real
[56:07] vision and we need to have a vision
[56:10] we're more than able to take the land
[56:13] we're more than able to get in the image
[56:14] of Christ we're more than able to
[56:16] overcome these things to get delivered
[56:18] of these things to to to be
[56:20] victorious got to have that Vision
[56:23] Isaiah 12:2 says behold God is my
[56:27] salvation I will trust and not be
[56:31] afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my
[56:33] strength in my song he also has become
[56:37] my
[56:38] salvation therefore with joy shall ye
[56:41] draw water out of the wells of
[56:44] Salvation you got to count it joy that
[56:48] that you're actually laboring right you
[56:50] got to you got to labor you got to draw
[56:52] you got to dig in you got to press in
[56:54] you got to believe you got to get past
[56:55] all these doubt you got to say he is
[56:57] mine God Is Mine peace is mine love is
[57:00] mine I shall not be
[57:01] denied you can't sit there and say oh I
[57:05] deserve to have God just love me again
[57:08] without me loving him without me
[57:10] believing without me
[57:12] trusting in other words if God really
[57:15] wants me to have these promised lands
[57:17] he's going to have to take the Giants
[57:18] out
[57:19] himself God will not honor
[57:23] that he honors faith without Faith it's
[57:26] impossible to please him the reason we
[57:28] got problems is because God wants to see
[57:30] faith in our life wants to see it in
[57:33] manifestation not just I know God I
[57:36] believe God I I now that doesn't mean
[57:38] anything show me it manifest
[57:43] it David said My Help Cometh From The
[57:47] Lord our encouragement comes from the
[57:52] Lord our encouragement comes from the
[57:55] word of God
[57:58] amen Psalms 563 says what time I am
[58:03] afraid I will trust in
[58:07] thee what time is it what are you going
[58:12] through how bad is it you know what at
[58:16] that time I will trust the
[58:19] Lord in God I will praise His
[58:23] word in God I will praise the
[58:29] Bible because that is what gives us
[58:32] encouragement that's what gives us
[58:33] strength that is the only thing that
[58:35] could defeat the Devil in his
[58:38] imaginations is the word of God
[58:40] therefore I will praise the word of God
[58:44] Amen you know a lot of people want to
[58:46] get praise but they don't want to give
[58:49] it a wrong that's the spirit of the
[58:54] devil in God I will put my trust I will
[58:58] not fear what flesh can do unto
[59:01] me you ever been afraid of somebody come
[59:05] on be honest you ever been afraid the
[59:08] way they're acting the way they're
[59:10] they're behaving the way they come
[59:11] across the way
[59:15] they that's just the devil in a human
[59:18] being there nothing but the devil in a
[59:20] human being
[59:22] amen I'm so glad that the god that I
[59:26] know is not like that amen Charles
[59:30] Stanley said nobody else can make us
[59:34] discouraged it is a choice that we alone
[59:37] make when facing
[59:40] disappointments wow I didn't know that
[59:43] quote after I got into this he also went
[59:46] on to say disappointment is
[59:50] inevitable but to become
[59:53] discouraged there is a choice that I
[59:57] make God would never discourage me he
[1:00:01] would always point me to himself to
[1:00:03] trust
[1:00:04] him therefore my discouragement is from
[1:00:08] Satan as you go through your emotions
[1:00:11] that we have hostility is not from God
[1:00:14] bitterness is not from God unforgiveness
[1:00:16] is not from God these are all attacks
[1:00:19] from
[1:00:23] Satan you know a lot of people don't
[1:00:26] recognize the devil in their
[1:00:32] mind most of the time when we Face
[1:00:34] discouragement or become discouraged we
[1:00:36] don't even recognize the
[1:00:38] devil he makes us to get into a feeling
[1:00:41] of being
[1:00:43] trapped looking at the circumstances no
[1:00:45] way out what are we going to
[1:00:48] do I always like how brother Bill used
[1:00:51] to say it he says Satan will come and he
[1:00:53] said there's a fire in the room there's
[1:00:55] no way out
[1:00:57] and God God will say there's a fire in
[1:01:00] the room but there's the
[1:01:02] door God is always made a way of
[1:01:05] Escape but see the way Satan presents
[1:01:07] things is that there's no way of
[1:01:10] Escape they're like
[1:01:12] giants but I'm going to tell you what we
[1:01:16] need to get a relationship with God
[1:01:17] where we can hold to his unchanging hand
[1:01:20] we need more of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:01:22] life we need more of the realness of God
[1:01:24] it needs to can't be some religion
[1:01:26] something we just slap on our bodies
[1:01:28] when we go to church it needs to be
[1:01:30] something on the inside of the inside
[1:01:32] something that holds Us in the middle of
[1:01:33] a trial something that can take the test
[1:01:35] come buy of me gold try it in the fire
[1:01:38] that's what God's looking for in a
[1:01:43] Believer the devil knows how to
[1:01:45] discourage a
[1:01:47] man by simply dropping negative thoughts
[1:01:51] into his
[1:01:53] mind I say it's one of his favorite
[1:01:55] tools
[1:01:58] and if a person is not aware of the
[1:02:00] devil's devices they will often accept
[1:02:02] those thoughts and become affected then
[1:02:05] by
[1:02:07] them so discouragement truly isn't what
[1:02:11] happens to them around them it's what
[1:02:14] they accepted and how their attitude was
[1:02:17] towards
[1:02:18] it a spirit of discouragement is always
[1:02:22] lurking around always looking for
[1:02:26] opportunity no doubt it's never
[1:02:30] enjoyable being with Negative Nancy or
[1:02:32] negative
[1:02:35] Ned but the negativity will not affect
[1:02:38] you unless you allow it
[1:02:41] to now sometimes you may have to step
[1:02:43] away and go
[1:02:49] pray though none go with me though none
[1:02:51] want to have a good attitude I'll still
[1:02:54] have it
[1:02:56] I'm so glad it became a choice I'm so
[1:02:58] glad I didn't have to get 10 people
[1:02:59] around me that believe like I
[1:03:02] do I'm so glad that there was a Joshua
[1:03:04] and a Caleb against 1.8 million
[1:03:10] people and you know what he never
[1:03:12] changed his attitude you notice that for
[1:03:14] 45 years never changed his attitude he
[1:03:18] never allowed the people around him to
[1:03:20] discourage him he never said oh if it
[1:03:23] wasn't for you I'd be in the promised
[1:03:24] land right now he did not even have that
[1:03:28] attitude CU he knew all things work
[1:03:31] together for the
[1:03:34] good don't ever blame someone for your
[1:03:38] discouragements don't try to say someone
[1:03:40] else brought me
[1:03:46] down it's what soul and soul said to me
[1:03:48] it really bothered
[1:03:51] me if this or that wouldn't happen then
[1:03:53] I would
[1:03:58] this is the way they make me
[1:04:00] feel what are you
[1:04:02] doing what are you doing you're giving
[1:04:05] yourself over to somebody
[1:04:10] else look you're the vessel of
[1:04:13] God it's not to the devil because the
[1:04:16] devil will actually use other people to
[1:04:17] get to you but you know what though a
[1:04:21] host should Camp about me I'm not going
[1:04:23] to fear what they're going to say to me
[1:04:24] I'm not afraid
[1:04:27] because I know in whom I
[1:04:32] believe we got to stop giving the devil
[1:04:36] our
[1:04:39] mind if we have to depend on what other
[1:04:42] people think and say about us to feel
[1:04:44] good I'll tell you this we got low
[1:04:48] self-esteem you need to get into the
[1:04:50] altar get a hold of
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:04:53] God the answer to discourage is not
[1:04:56] needing someone else to pick us up from
[1:04:58] negative
[1:05:01] thoughts but by taking responsibility of
[1:05:04] those thoughts in our own
[1:05:06] mind if I accept negativity why do I
[1:05:09] need to depend on somebody else to help
[1:05:11] me get those
[1:05:17] out it's not some song or joke or some
[1:05:20] emotional speech we
[1:05:22] need we don't need anyone to to make a
[1:05:26] choice in our mind we make that
[1:05:33] choice how many times have we heard
[1:05:35] something
[1:05:36] like there's you know there's like five
[1:05:39] people there or 10 or a certain amount
[1:05:42] of people and they're watching something
[1:05:44] and then they're all asked what did you
[1:05:46] see what did you see what did you
[1:05:50] see are you looking through a mind of
[1:05:53] positiveness or a mind of
[1:05:56] negativity are you looking through uh uh
[1:06:00] emotions that are not connected to the
[1:06:03] word or or you're looking through the
[1:06:05] emotions of what you
[1:06:09] want I mean here's the thing I'm sure
[1:06:12] Joshua and Caleb could have came back
[1:06:14] and said you know I these boys they got
[1:06:16] a point they got a point they are giants
[1:06:19] we've never faced this before this is a
[1:06:21] problem we've never faced before the
[1:06:24] problems that we faced before is that
[1:06:25] God took care of the
[1:06:27] Egyptians and that's my my faith can
[1:06:30] only go that far that God's got to just
[1:06:32] you know he's got to take care of the
[1:06:34] problem without me believing
[1:06:38] it you know I'm telling you there's more
[1:06:41] to the Walk of Christ than just
[1:06:42] justification
[1:06:44] friends more than just
[1:06:47] baptism we got to go in and take on the
[1:06:50] image of Christ we got to get in there
[1:06:52] and believe amen that's not happening
[1:07:00] then if I could just speak just a moment
[1:07:03] on the
[1:07:04] promise from from God for us for the I
[1:07:08] say it like this the promised land for
[1:07:10] us is a spiritual promised
[1:07:12] land and God has promised us just like
[1:07:15] he did in type to
[1:07:23] Joshua now our promise
[1:07:26] is that we've been predestinated to be
[1:07:28] in the image of Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ that is our Promised
[1:07:32] Land we know that when he shall appear
[1:07:35] we shall be like him the Bible says the
[1:07:37] whole creation of God is groaning and
[1:07:40] travailing and pain waiting for what the
[1:07:42] manifestation of the sons of God now
[1:07:45] this is our Promised
[1:07:47] Land perfect
[1:07:51] love 1 John 3:13 Marvel not my brethren
[1:07:54] if the world hate you we know that we
[1:07:57] have passed from Death unto life because
[1:07:59] we love the Brethren we're a we've
[1:08:02] gotten to the place that we're able to
[1:08:04] Love Like Jesus loves amen so this is
[1:08:07] the promised
[1:08:09] land now we've called the promised land
[1:08:13] or the Holy Ghost the promised
[1:08:16] land and it is but in
[1:08:20] part remember the prophet said the Holy
[1:08:23] Ghost is is our Josh
[1:08:26] today and Joshua took them into the
[1:08:29] promised land was not the promised land
[1:08:32] are you with me Joshua led the children
[1:08:35] of God into the promised land and the
[1:08:37] Holy Ghost is leading us into the image
[1:08:39] of God when he the spirit of Truth had
[1:08:41] come he will lead and guide you into all
[1:08:43] truth Amen Let us make man in our own
[1:08:47] image this is what's happening to the
[1:08:49] bride the bride is becoming into the
[1:08:52] image of Jesus Christ
[1:08:57] the Holy Ghost leads us to the promised
[1:08:59] land who God is
[1:09:02] now it can get discouraging when the
[1:09:05] devil drops thoughts into our mind that
[1:09:07] we can't
[1:09:10] overcome that we'll never be ready in
[1:09:12] time for the Rapture that we'll really
[1:09:15] never ever get to a spot that we can
[1:09:17] love our
[1:09:18] enemies that we can't really become into
[1:09:21] the image of
[1:09:23] Christ and we can't stop doing the
[1:09:25] things that we're doing or that we can't
[1:09:27] develop the habits to do the right see
[1:09:29] these are thoughts from the devil I
[1:09:31] can't get over this I can't get past
[1:09:35] this these are discouraging thoughts but
[1:09:38] you don't accept
[1:09:40] those it's a choice remember it's a
[1:09:43] choice don't be a doubting Thomas I'm
[1:09:46] not going to believe until I can put my
[1:09:47] finger until this thing is gone from me
[1:09:49] I won't believe or I until I see until I
[1:09:52] see something more manifested in me I
[1:09:54] won't believe no you got to believe
[1:09:58] first you know God he believed first
[1:10:00] before the Earth was
[1:10:03] created he always believes
[1:10:05] first think about this we're all born
[1:10:07] sin shape and iniquity he has this
[1:10:09] Vision I have an expected end for
[1:10:13] you he believes for us all we need to do
[1:10:17] is believe in him that's all we going
[1:10:20] need to do is just believe in
[1:10:23] God I'll just say if we accept these
[1:10:25] kind of
[1:10:27] thoughts it'll get us discouraged it'll
[1:10:30] get us
[1:10:31] dismayed but I'm saying today don't
[1:10:34] accept those thoughts don't even accept
[1:10:37] them in other words recognize that this
[1:10:41] thinking or these thoughts are from the
[1:10:43] devil I like to say it like this it's
[1:10:45] devil
[1:10:48] thinking it's double thinking you ever
[1:10:50] you ever wonder what goes on in hell
[1:10:58] like really what goes on in
[1:11:01] there all you got to do I mean if you
[1:11:04] watch TV you'll
[1:11:08] know you you know all this stuff that is
[1:11:11] evil is getting worse and worse the
[1:11:13] Bible says but you know it all starts
[1:11:15] one place it starts in our head and I
[1:11:18] think we're we're we we are we're so
[1:11:21] gullible sometimes that we actually are
[1:11:23] involved in the devil
[1:11:27] thinking we need to recognize negative
[1:11:29] thoughts and negative thought
[1:11:32] patterns we need to learn to try the
[1:11:35] spirit to see whether it is of god or
[1:11:37] not amen because as that quote we read
[1:11:42] uh God is is not going to put
[1:11:46] discouraging thoughts in me that is not
[1:11:49] going to come from God that's going to
[1:11:51] come from the devil so therefore when we
[1:11:54] have the thought say it this is of the
[1:11:56] devil I'm not going to think it don't
[1:11:58] sit there and ponder it and say Well it
[1:12:00] it's not negative it's not bad it's it's
[1:12:02] not God it's not it's like this
[1:12:05] swissland to where I could just think
[1:12:06] about no it's
[1:12:10] not either you're
[1:12:12] thinking the thoughts of the devil or
[1:12:15] you're thinking the word of God
[1:12:17] am and the devil wants you to say well
[1:12:20] it's okay what you think it's not okay
[1:12:23] what you think because it will as much
[1:12:25] as much as you enjoy yelling at somebody
[1:12:29] throwing something across the
[1:12:32] room putting your fist up at somebody as
[1:12:34] you're driving by whatever it might be
[1:12:37] as as as fulfilling as it may be at that
[1:12:41] moment it will definitely bring you
[1:12:44] down so you can't go by how you're
[1:12:46] feeling at the
[1:12:49] time it's not eing the peaceful fruits
[1:12:51] of
[1:12:52] righteousness remember when you accept
[1:12:54] the devil thinking you're thinking like
[1:12:57] the
[1:12:59] devil so you don't have to wonder how
[1:13:01] the devil thinks you don't we've all
[1:13:04] been guilty of thinking like the
[1:13:08] devil we all been guilty of thinking
[1:13:12] like we're like grasshoppers compared to
[1:13:16] this problem that we're facing that we
[1:13:18] can't overcome these giant problems in
[1:13:20] our mind don't accept those thoughts
[1:13:24] they bring discouragement
[1:13:26] choose to reject those thoughts and that
[1:13:28] type of thinking remember always
[1:13:30] remember that we have a choice we have a
[1:13:34] choice about what we're going to think
[1:13:36] about and I'll say this I'll say
[1:13:40] this don't sit there and think about the
[1:13:42] things for a while and then make a
[1:13:44] decision you'll you'll get
[1:13:47] caught you'll get
[1:13:50] caught the devil knows what he's
[1:13:53] doing has anybody ever G fishing with a
[1:13:56] big sign says don't bite this
[1:14:03] hook no you want to hide the hook you
[1:14:07] want to show the bait you want to make
[1:14:09] it look certain ways you want the
[1:14:11] spinner going you want the smell there
[1:14:13] you want it moving through the the the
[1:14:15] pad the you want it to look appealing
[1:14:18] the devil wants his thoughts to look
[1:14:19] appealing to
[1:14:22] you yeah they they look like this what's
[1:14:24] harmless you can think about this I
[1:14:26] didn't say anything it's all on my mind
[1:14:27] huh oh
[1:14:30] my oh my that's that's exactly what he
[1:14:33] did to the 10 spies he the devil put in
[1:14:35] the mind of the 10
[1:14:38] spies this
[1:14:41] very uh unpredictable no way to overcome
[1:14:48] situation but remember it was they said
[1:14:51] it's a land that flows with milk and
[1:14:53] honey it it's good grapes you know here
[1:14:55] they are let's it's true it's it's
[1:14:59] beautiful but also put along with that
[1:15:03] thought that we can't have
[1:15:09] it don't accept those thoughts don't
[1:15:13] entertain
[1:15:17] them the devil's going to present
[1:15:19] thoughts but we have a choice in our
[1:15:22] thoughts
[1:15:25] he's going to tell you you're doomed
[1:15:26] it's hopeless there's no answer you
[1:15:28] might as well give up in this
[1:15:30] situation you might as well just not
[1:15:32] even put your hard to go into church oh
[1:15:35] there's a good one there's a good one
[1:15:38] you can go but don't put your heart into
[1:15:41] it I'm going to say those thoughts those
[1:15:46] thoughts that there's no answer it's
[1:15:48] hopeless those are Thoughts From Hell
[1:15:51] you ever want to know what's going on in
[1:15:52] hell that's what's going on in hell yeah
[1:15:55] Thoughts From Hell we're in a
[1:15:59] battle and we must be willing to battle
[1:16:03] those thoughts in our
[1:16:06] mind and what it is it's the devil just
[1:16:08] be honest with you nobody wants to
[1:16:10] think that the devil isn't in
[1:16:15] them the devil may not be in your heart
[1:16:18] but he's definitely in your
[1:16:20] head and wants to get in there wants to
[1:16:23] get in the boxing arena with you come on
[1:16:25] let's go at it CU he's been there he's
[1:16:28] he's who's ever who whatever thought is
[1:16:31] going on in your head I'm telling you
[1:16:33] he's fought it with many millions of
[1:16:35] other humans before he ever got to you
[1:16:37] he knows how to battle
[1:16:40] you but God has allowed the devil free
[1:16:44] will to place thoughts in your mind I
[1:16:45] want you to remember
[1:16:47] that as much as we don't want to think
[1:16:49] them God has allowed the devil yep you
[1:16:52] just you go put any thought you want in
[1:16:54] in my children's in my priz you just go
[1:16:56] ahead he doesn't stop
[1:17:00] it and it is our responsibility to cast
[1:17:04] those same thoughts out that the devil
[1:17:06] has given us so God has allowed the
[1:17:09] devil to put the thoughts there and God
[1:17:11] has said to his bride you cast them
[1:17:16] out and the bride will because that's
[1:17:19] the only way she overcomes all
[1:17:22] things 1 Peter chapter 5:8 1 Peter chap
[1:17:25] 5:8 be
[1:17:28] sober be
[1:17:31] vigilant this is how our mind needs to
[1:17:33] be
[1:17:34] now because your adversary the devil as
[1:17:37] a roing lion walketh about seeking whom
[1:17:41] he may devour sinner
[1:17:45] Saint a clean heart not a clean heart
[1:17:49] having a good day having a bad day it
[1:17:51] don't matter the devil is walking around
[1:17:54] seeking may may devour what is the
[1:17:56] answer be
[1:17:57] sober be
[1:18:00] vigilant because not every thought that
[1:18:02] comes in your head is of God every
[1:18:04] thought that you're thinking is not
[1:18:07] right it's about time we accept that and
[1:18:11] you know what it takes to accept that
[1:18:12] truly truly
[1:18:15] humility
[1:18:17] humility that's why God dwells with the
[1:18:20] humble why he resists the proud because
[1:18:23] the proud is always right he's right in
[1:18:25] his own eyes is he thinks he's
[1:18:29] right verse n what's the answer whom
[1:18:33] resist steadfast in the word of God in
[1:18:37] the faith in the word knowing that the
[1:18:40] same things that you're going
[1:18:43] through are the same things that are
[1:18:46] going through in your brethren that are
[1:18:47] around the
[1:18:48] world in other words the devil wants you
[1:18:50] to feel
[1:18:52] isolated nobody has got it like you got
[1:18:57] it I will say this for assurity God has
[1:19:00] never put anything on anybody that they
[1:19:01] couldn't bear because God is faithful he
[1:19:04] won't do that amen and any good parent
[1:19:07] would never put something on their
[1:19:08] children that they couldn't
[1:19:11] handle but now in order for you to
[1:19:14] resist the devil you got to recognize
[1:19:18] him if you're going to sit there and
[1:19:20] allow that thought to be in your head
[1:19:21] yeah yeah they said this they yeah they
[1:19:24] they did this to me yeah they stabbed me
[1:19:27] they did this you're allowing all those
[1:19:29] thoughts then you're going to walk
[1:19:31] around I don't know how to handle this
[1:19:34] because you got the devil
[1:19:38] inside I mean as soon as you recognize
[1:19:41] it get it out resist
[1:19:45] it it's learning how to defeat the Devil
[1:19:48] with the word of
[1:19:52] God we're all in this battle together
[1:19:56] every single person that you know of you
[1:20:00] think about the people in the world they
[1:20:01] don't even know the devil's speaking to
[1:20:03] them and they're actually doing the
[1:20:05] things of the devil living like the
[1:20:08] world beating people up and say they
[1:20:11] deserved it because they said that to
[1:20:13] me right going drinking shooting up I'm
[1:20:17] doing this because you know my husband
[1:20:19] or my wife they did that listening to
[1:20:22] the devil
[1:20:25] and they're blaming it on somebody
[1:20:28] else in other words they don't recognize
[1:20:31] the devil they just recognize the
[1:20:35] person but you know we don't fight
[1:20:37] against flesh and blood Ephesians verse
[1:20:41] chapter 6 verse 10 Ephesians 6 ver10 if
[1:20:43] you want to write it down finally my
[1:20:45] brethren be strong in the
[1:20:48] Lord be strong in the Bible be strong in
[1:20:52] the word not your not just your thoughts
[1:20:56] that but
[1:20:58] strong there's a difference between you
[1:21:02] know I I I look at my stomach I looked
[1:21:04] at my stomach couple of
[1:21:06] times and I think wouldn't it wouldn't
[1:21:10] it be good to exercise a little bit
[1:21:14] John but I'm going to be honest with you
[1:21:16] they weren't strong thoughts because I
[1:21:18] haven't done it
[1:21:21] yet be strong in the Lord and the power
[1:21:24] of His
[1:21:25] might put on the whole armor of God that
[1:21:30] you may be able to stand against the Ws
[1:21:32] of the
[1:21:33] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:21:36] and
[1:21:38] blood think about all the problems that
[1:21:40] we have guaranteed you can identify a
[1:21:43] person to that problem I don't care if
[1:21:46] it's Mom dad kids neighbors I don't care
[1:21:50] whatever your problem there's the person
[1:21:55] and and and if it's not if it's just a
[1:21:57] flat tire eventually you become that
[1:22:01] person the devil knows how to camouflage
[1:22:04] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:22:06] blood but against principalities think
[1:22:09] about this people are fighting against
[1:22:11] principalities the powers and the rulers
[1:22:14] of the darkness of this world against
[1:22:18] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:22:20] right
[1:22:23] here this is is where we're wrestling
[1:22:25] people don't even know they're in a
[1:22:27] battle so what's the answer Paul what's
[1:22:30] the answer he tells the Ephesian church
[1:22:31] that the most Spiritual
[1:22:34] Church wherefore take upon you the whole
[1:22:38] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:22:41] withstand in the evil day right and
[1:22:45] having done all to stand I just wonder
[1:22:48] you know a lot of times we the way we
[1:22:49] think we don't recognize we just we just
[1:22:51] allow oursel to think these things and
[1:22:53] then we wonder why we get down and
[1:22:55] discouraged and
[1:22:57] bothered it's because you didn't put the
[1:23:00] armor on quick you didn't discern quick
[1:23:02] enough that was from the devil that
[1:23:04] thought you want to get in and watch the
[1:23:06] whole
[1:23:08] movie right you want to think the whole
[1:23:10] thing through you want to you want to
[1:23:12] understand from this direction and that
[1:23:13] because he presents it in an exciting
[1:23:15] way because he's presenting it in a
[1:23:18] finger
[1:23:20] pointing and if I can finger point
[1:23:22] enough I'll be able to say you see it's
[1:23:25] their fault I'm discouraged because of
[1:23:29] them therefore I don't feel I need to
[1:23:32] try anymore God understands my situation
[1:23:35] God understands you won't make it into a
[1:23:37] Promised
[1:23:38] Land you need to change your
[1:23:41] attitude look I don't want you to get
[1:23:43] upset at me I want you to get upset at
[1:23:44] the Devil he's the one lying to you not
[1:23:47] me I'm on your
[1:23:49] side he does the same thing to me why we
[1:23:53] need to pray one for another amen God
[1:23:55] commanded Joshua the only answer there
[1:23:58] was to overcome Satan's discouraging
[1:24:00] thoughts was to keep God's promise
[1:24:01] inside of
[1:24:04] him keep it in front of you keep it in
[1:24:07] your head keep it in your thoughts keep
[1:24:08] it in your mind keep it in your heart
[1:24:10] and speak it
[1:24:12] out we sing it I I will not be
[1:24:15] denied that's what you need to tell the
[1:24:18] devil when he lies to you we're more
[1:24:21] than able to take the land
[1:24:24] God is greater inside of me this is the
[1:24:27] battle that's
[1:24:29] happening don't look to the other person
[1:24:32] to change their thought let's say you
[1:24:33] got a you have a problem with a family
[1:24:35] member and this family member is just
[1:24:38] being a little bit out of whack you know
[1:24:41] what I mean by
[1:24:43] that I don't need to go any further you
[1:24:45] know what I'm saying about
[1:24:47] that instead of putting your energy to
[1:24:50] change this person's out of wackness
[1:24:53] into a better whack
[1:25:01] look to the word of God because there's
[1:25:03] an answer in the word of God how to
[1:25:04] handle that problem amen well brother
[1:25:07] John I don't know I I don't know I I you
[1:25:09] nobody told me I my mom and dad never
[1:25:11] told me I don't know how to do that how
[1:25:12] much time have you had to get in the
[1:25:14] word and read it but you refus to do it
[1:25:17] and then you come to church and you want
[1:25:18] to be picked up at church when you won't
[1:25:20] take time at home to get a hold of God
[1:25:24] I'm telling you there's going to be a
[1:25:25] Rapture it's going to happen we're
[1:25:28] either going to be ready or we're not
[1:25:29] going to be ready and there'll be
[1:25:30] nobody's nobody's responsibility but our
[1:25:34] own get into the word there's an
[1:25:38] answer sometimes it's a soft answer and
[1:25:41] sometimes you warn them that are unruly
[1:25:43] you got to have the answer for the
[1:25:48] situation this book of the law shall not
[1:25:51] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[1:25:54] meditate therein day and night that thou
[1:25:59] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:26:01] that is written
[1:26:03] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:26:06] prosperous and then Thou shalt make
[1:26:09] shall thou shal have good
[1:26:12] success a lot of people don't read the
[1:26:14] Bible because it's it's not it's not
[1:26:17] entertaining
[1:26:18] enough not
[1:26:22] enjoyable and some people read it
[1:26:24] because they want to get more
[1:26:26] knowledge and both of those are
[1:26:30] wrong you you you read
[1:26:32] it so you can live it so you can know
[1:26:36] how to live for God so you can know how
[1:26:38] to please him well I already know that
[1:26:41] well then you know what just called God
[1:26:43] a doo bird he don't know what he's
[1:26:45] telling you I don't know what to tell
[1:26:47] you you need to change your
[1:26:50] attitude if the word says it then just
[1:26:52] do it don't say you already know because
[1:26:54] if you already know you'd already live
[1:26:55] it that's it if you already know you
[1:26:58] would already live
[1:27:00] it because some that says they know
[1:27:03] something but they don't live it is
[1:27:04] speaking from the Tree of knowledge of
[1:27:06] Good and Evil it's not the tree of
[1:27:09] life and he said he build his church
[1:27:13] upon the Revelation which comes from the
[1:27:15] Tree of
[1:27:16] Life the only way to overcome the
[1:27:19] thoughts of the devil is by submitting
[1:27:21] to the word of God can you say Amen

[1:28:20] double-minded in other words you allow
[1:28:22] your mind to think think thoughts from

[1:29:12] emotions and those the inner part of
[1:29:14] your being you got to control your
[1:29:17] thoughts change what you're thinking
[1:29:19] about the Bible says he as a man think
[1:29:24] so is
[1:29:25] he so if you're thinking you're broken
[1:29:27] you're
[1:29:29] broken and one of the hardest things to
[1:29:31] do is convince somebody that they've
[1:29:33] been set free when they've been bound so
[1:29:37] long it's a true
[1:29:39] statement now if you never been
[1:29:43] bound what's easy to say I'm
[1:29:48] free and being bound for you know look I
[1:29:53] haven't smoked cigarettes in whatever 40
[1:29:55] years 50 more than
[1:29:58] that I spend a long time
[1:30:02] anyways tried it a couple of times
[1:30:05] because that's what my brother did and I
[1:30:07] want to be cool he was older than
[1:30:09] me one I want to be
[1:30:16] accepted it's so now every time I feel
[1:30:19] it have you ever smoked I gota go oh
[1:30:22] back way back there
[1:30:24] are you a smoker have you ever
[1:30:27] smoked look if if you're
[1:30:30] smoking the Deliverance is much harder
[1:30:34] because you've been bound so
[1:30:38] long than just once or twice
[1:30:45] there God you got to start with your
[1:30:49] thinking that these things are not for
[1:30:51] me
[1:30:54] this drinking is not for me this
[1:30:55] swearing is not for me this pornography
[1:30:58] is not for me I got to start in my mind
[1:31:01] this is not for me this is not of God
[1:31:05] this is not in the
[1:31:06] word I'm changing my
[1:31:09] thoughts get serious with the word of
[1:31:13] God because if you heal your
[1:31:17] thoughts you will heal your
[1:31:20] life too many people you know give me
[1:31:23] this pills give give me some counseling
[1:31:24] give me this give me that and I'll be
[1:31:26] fine that's TR no it ain't when it comes
[1:31:30] to the devil you got to get involved
[1:31:32] with your
[1:31:32] self-will right aspirin aren't going to
[1:31:35] take care of that blessed are they who
[1:31:38] see God's promise in a middle of a
[1:31:40] terrible problem can you say Amen
[1:31:43] blessed are they who see beautiful
[1:31:46] things in Humble places where others see
[1:31:49] nothing Mary condo said discard
[1:31:54] everything that does not spark
[1:31:59] Joy discard everything that doesn't
[1:32:02] spark
[1:32:03] Joy you know here God gave the promised
[1:32:07] land to the children of Israel you just
[1:32:10] got to go now possess it and 10 spies
[1:32:14] have this thought we can't do it but
[1:32:16] they did not disregard that
[1:32:19] thought it didn't spark joy and they
[1:32:22] didn't disregard it
[1:32:24] now I am sure Joshua and Caleb saw the
[1:32:26] same
[1:32:27] Giants
[1:32:30] right but that thought didn't spark joy
[1:32:33] and so they disregarded it you
[1:32:35] understand what I'm trying to say you've
[1:32:37] got to you've got to heal your thoughts
[1:32:40] if you want to you want to have more joy
[1:32:41] in your life you got to get rid of every
[1:32:44] other thought that doesn't spark the
[1:32:47] joy Apostle Paul told the Corinthian
[1:32:50] Church in 2 Corinthians 10:3 we're just
[1:32:52] please bear with me now now we're almost
[1:32:55] done for though we walk in the flesh we
[1:32:57] do not war after the flesh for the
[1:33:00] weapons of our Warfare they're not
[1:33:01] carnal but they're Mighty through God to
[1:33:04] the pulling down of strongholds now
[1:33:06] that's what happens when we're
[1:33:07] discouraged it's a stronghold it can be
[1:33:09] a
[1:33:11] stronghold it's one thing to get as
[1:33:13] discouraging thought it's one thing to
[1:33:15] be in to be set in a in a set mind of
[1:33:20] discouragement discouraging thoughts is
[1:33:23] the root and cause of
[1:33:26] discouragement so if you don't accept
[1:33:27] the thoughts of discour discouraging
[1:33:30] thoughts you won't get discouraged so
[1:33:32] you literally have to work for it you
[1:33:34] have to resist the devil you have to
[1:33:36] submit to the
[1:33:37] truth work there's that work there and
[1:33:40] it's an inner work not an outer
[1:33:44] work an inner work God working on the
[1:33:48] inside amen casting down
[1:33:51] imaginations cast them down
[1:33:55] you got to call it out this is not the
[1:33:56] truth this is absolutely a lie look what
[1:33:59] job had to go through he had to do a lot
[1:34:01] longer than we did and I'm telling you
[1:34:03] he had so many other all so many other
[1:34:06] things to prove to him that it wasn't an
[1:34:09] imagination his kids kept dying things
[1:34:11] kept burning up look at Jonah they that
[1:34:16] uh observe lying vanities forsake their
[1:34:18] own mercies you you you got to just cast
[1:34:21] it down call it out look at it it's of
[1:34:23] God not of God make the decision and
[1:34:25] then go with it don't sit there and
[1:34:27] allow it to be there until it's gone
[1:34:29] don't do
[1:34:30] that you're a
[1:34:33] Believer cast down imagination every
[1:34:35] thought and every High thing that
[1:34:37] exalteth itself against the word of
[1:34:42] God and bring it into
[1:34:45] captivity what what we what into
[1:34:49] captivity every
[1:34:52] thought to The Obedience of the word of
[1:34:57] God now look if we're willing to do that
[1:35:00] we're going to be a happier
[1:35:02] people Joy is g to come in sadness is
[1:35:05] going to get
[1:35:06] out because the devil he does not bring
[1:35:09] good
[1:35:12] thoughts he's a Salesman
[1:35:14] now right he'll say you just drink this
[1:35:17] vodka you're gonna have a good
[1:35:21] time yeah he can do that
[1:35:24] but he's not telling you the whole story
[1:35:26] so he he he's a Salesman it may look
[1:35:29] like it's good but it's
[1:35:31] not and having a Readiness this is that
[1:35:34] be sober be vigilant having a Readiness
[1:35:36] to Revenge all Disobedience when when
[1:35:40] when is this going to happen when
[1:35:42] you fulfill what you're supposed to do
[1:35:46] when you're your personal obedience is
[1:35:50] fulfilled all right two more scriptures
[1:35:52] Philippians 4:7 that were quitting
[1:35:54] no no we're quitting we're never going
[1:35:56] to quit but we'll be finished with
[1:35:58] today's
[1:36:00] service and the peace of God Philippians
[1:36:02] 4:7 and the peace of God which passeth
[1:36:05] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[1:36:08] right and your
[1:36:09] minds through Christ
[1:36:12] Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things
[1:36:16] are
[1:36:19] true now it can't just pass one of the
[1:36:21] test here it's got to pass them
[1:36:25] all whatsoever things are honest
[1:36:28] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:36:31] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:36:34] lovely whatsoever things of a good
[1:36:37] report if there be any virtue if there
[1:36:39] be any praise then think on these things
[1:36:43] so you know I'm going to be honest with
[1:36:45] you I don't think there's anything on TV
[1:36:48] that matches
[1:36:51] this I think God gave Joshua the answer
[1:36:54] which is the word of God meditate upon
[1:36:56] it day and night amen get more of the
[1:36:59] word inside of
[1:37:00] you those things which you have both
[1:37:03] learned and received and heard and seen
[1:37:05] in me do and the God of Peace shall be
[1:37:07] with you
[1:37:13] right you know there's a lot of people
[1:37:15] that want
[1:37:18] peace and all they got to do is truly
[1:37:21] give their mind to the Lord right give
[1:37:24] their mind to the Lord they say oh I
[1:37:25] gave my heart to God why don't I got
[1:37:26] peace give your mind to the Lord Isaiah
[1:37:29] 26:31 with this Thou shalt keep him in
[1:37:32] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:37:35] thee because he trusteth in thee you
[1:37:39] can't just say God's in your heart and
[1:37:40] then you don't keep God in your mind
[1:37:43] you're not really trusting in God then
[1:37:45] this is the answer to help us not to be
[1:37:48] discouraged let's Stand
[1:37:50] Together discouragement is a wrong
[1:37:52] choice that we make in our mind when we
[1:37:55] Face discouraging
[1:37:57] situations choose to build yourself up
[1:37:59] in the Most Holy
[1:38:01] Faith keep reminding yourself of the
[1:38:04] promises of God hold on to your
[1:38:06] beginning confidence steadfast to the
[1:38:08] end stay in the word however much time
